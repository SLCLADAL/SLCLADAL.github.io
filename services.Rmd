When contacting the LADAL team, please provide a description of what you would like to consult us on. This includes information on:

+ **What is your main issue?** (e.g. I am not sure on which statistical test I should use)

+ **What is the data you use?** (e.g. I am working with questionnaire data containing answers to 45 questions from 150 respondents)

+ **What are the variables?** (e.g. My data consists of nominal, categorical, and numeric variables but my dependent variable is numeric)

+ **What is your main question?** (e.g. My main question is if students that have studied abroad have an advantage over students that have not spent any time abroad)

+ **What is your time frame?** (e.g. I would need help within the next three weeks)

+ **What is your budget?** (e.g. I could maximally spend 200$ on this)
