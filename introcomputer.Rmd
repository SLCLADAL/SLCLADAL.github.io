# Introduction

Most people work with computers on a daily basis but almost nobody has been taught how to organize files and folders, how to manage data, and how to avoid data loss. This tutorial gives some general tips on how to keep your computer clean and running smoothly. In addition, we will have a look at how to organize files and folders. Finally, the tutorial will give some pointers about how to deal with and organize data so that they are stored safely and orderly. This tutorial focuses on Windows machines and is intended for people who for anybody including anybody who is less computer savvy. Thus, we will not go over manually optimizing Windows and system options (for those that are more computer savvy, an annoying but still helpful video on how to optimize you Windows and system options for maximum performance can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiA0zRbzko)).

# General tips about using computers 

In the following, we will go over some tips that will increase the speed of your computer. If cared for, even older machines can handle most of our everyday  tasks and fulfill most of our computational needs.


## Basics about folder structure

There are various ways in which you can organize your folders. All of these ways to organize your folders have different advantages and problems but they all have in common that they rely on a tree-structure where more general folders contain more specialized ones. For example, if you want to find any file with as few clicks as possible, the an alphabetical folder structure would be a good solution. Organized in this way, everything that starts with a certain letter will be stored by its initial letter (e.g. everything starting with a "t" such as "travel" under "T" or everything related to your "courses" under "C"). However, organizing your data in an alphabetical way is not intuitive and completely unrelated topics will be located in the same folder.

A more common and intuitive way to organize your data is to separate your data into meaningful aspects of your life such as Work (containing, e.g., *teaching* and *research*), Living (including *rent*, *finances*, and *insurances*), and Media (including *Movies*, *Music*, and *Audiobooks*). 

## Naming conventions 

Folders (as well as files) should be labeled in a meaningful way. This means that you avoid names like *Stuff* or *Document* for folders and *doc2* or *homework* for files. 

Like the different conventions for folders, there are different conventions for files. As a general rule, any special character symbols, such as +, !, ", -, ., ö, ü, ä, %, &, (, ), [, ], &, $, =, ?, ', #, or / but also including white spaces, should be avoided (while _ is also a special character, it is still common practice to include them in file names for readability). One reason for this is that you will may encounter problems when sharing files if you avoid white spaces and special characters. Also, some software applications automatically replace or collapse white spaces. A common practice to avoid this issue is to capitalize initial letters in file names which allows you avoid white spaces. An example would be *TutorialIntroComputerSkills* or *Tutorial_IntroComputerSkills*.

When you want to include time-stamps in file names, the best way to do this is to use the YYYYMMDD format (rather than DDMMYYYY or even D.M.YY). The reason is that if dates are added this way, the files can be easily sorted in ascending or descending order. To elaborate on the examples shown before, we may use *TutorialIntroComputerSkills20200413* or *Tutorial_IntroComputerSkills_20200413*

## Avoid storing data on your Desktop or the C-drive

When you start your computer, different parts of the computer are started at different times with with different priorities. The Desktop is always started with the highest priority which means that if you have a lot of stuff on your desktop, then the computer will load all that stuff once it kicks into action which can cause it to work quite heavily at each start and also slow down quite dramatically. 
This means that you should avoid storing data on any part of your system that is activated routinely. Rather, try to separate things that need to be loaded from things that only need to be loaded if they are actually used. For this reason you should also avoid storing data on your C-drive. In fact, the C-drive should only contain programs as it is activated automatically at each start. 

You can, for example, store all your projects on the OneDrive, Google's MyDrive, or in Dropbox where it is only started once you actively click and open a folder and the files are also backed up automatically.  

If you want to have data accessible via your desktop, you can still do so by using links: place a link to your data (stored on another drive) on your desktop and you can load your data easily without it being activated at every start.

## Tidy your room!

Full bins will also slow down your computer so you should empty it regularly. In addition, your computer will store and collect files when it is running. These files (temp files) also slow your computer down. As such files are redundant, they should be deleted regularly. You can remove such files manually using the *msconfig* prompt but an easier way is to use software to help you with cleaning your computer.

## Software to clean your computer

There are numerous software applications that can help you with keeping your computer clean and up-to-date (you will find a list of software options for PCs  [here](https://blogs.systweak.com/10-best-pc-cleaner-software-to-optimize-your-system/)). We will only look at two options here (The two applications we will discuss are [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/de-de) and [Avira](https://www.avira.com/de)) but a quick Google search will provide you with many different alternatives.

The most widely used program to clean your computer (if you have a PC rather than a Mac) is [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/de-de). There are different versions of CCleaner but the free version suffices to delete any superfluous files and junk from your computer. When using this program you should, however, be careful not to remove information that is useful. For instance, I like to keep all tabs of my current session in my browser an I therefore have to change the default options in *CCleaner* to avoid having to reopen all my tabs when I next open my browser. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0SVQeai5OA) is a short video tutorial on how to use the *CCleaner*.

In addition, the free version of [Avira](https://www.avira.com/de) also has a function that you can use to clean your computer. In fact, *Avira* will also inform you about any software that is out-of-date and other issues. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co3z5cSGG9E) is a short video tutorial on how to use the *Avira* for cleaning your computer and performing an anti-virus scan. 

## The Bus-factor and documentation

Although documentation is not necessary to keep your computer running smoothly, it is highly recommendable to keep track of what you have stored where and what (important) documents or data are. The idea is to keep a log of the contents of folders so that you at a later point in time or someone else can continue your work in case you are run over by a bus (hence the bus factor). 

If you work in a collaborative project, it is especially useful to have a log of where one can find relevant information and who to ask for help with what. Thus, if you have not created a log for on-boarding, the perfect person to create a log would be the last person who joined the project. The log can be stored as a ReadMe on the top level of the project.

ReadMes are files that document contents or procedures of files, folders, and projects and they serve as a guide for people who are new to the project. They can also contain information about Dos and Donts and should be part of the on-boarding process.

## Keep copies

Try to have at least three copies of your project that are in different locations. Although this is just a personal preference, I always safe my projects 

* on my personal notebook
* on at least one additional hard drive (that you keep in a secure location)
* in an online repository (for example, *OneDrive*, *MyDrive*, *GitHub*, or *GitLab*)

Using online repositories ensures that you do not loose any data in case your computer crashes (or in case you spill lemonade over it - don't ask...) but it comes at the cost that your data can be more accessible to (criminal or other) third parties. Thus, if you are dealing with sensitive data, I suggest to store it on an additional external hard drive and do not keep cloud-based back-ups. If you trust tech companies with your data (or think that they are not interested in stealing your data), cloud-based solutions such as OneDrive, Google's MyDrive, or Dropbox are ideal and easy to use options.

# Tips on how to deal with and organize projects

## Project folder design

Store your projects in a separate folder. For instance, if you are creating a folder for a research project, create the project folder within a separate *project* folder that is within a *research* folder. If you are creating a folder for a course, create the course folder within a *courses* folder within a *teaching* folder, etc.


Whenever you create a folder for a new project, try to have a set of standard folders. For example, when I create research project folders,  I always have folders called *archive*, *datatable*, and *images*. When I create course folders, I always have folders called *slides*, *assignments*, *exam*, *studentmaterials*, and *correspondence*. However, you are, of course, free to modify and come up or create your own basic project design. 

Having different sub folders allows you to avoid having too many files and many different file types in a single folder. Folders with many different files and file types tend to be chaotic and can be confusing. In addition, I have one ReadMe file on the highest level (which only contains folders except for this one single file) in which I describe very briefly what the folder is about and which folders contain which documents as well as some basic information about the folder (e.g. why and when I created it). This ReadMe file is intended both for me as a reminder what this folder is about and what it contains but also for others in case I hand the project over to someone else who continues the project or for someone who takes over my course and needs to use my materials.  

## Encryption

As some information is sensitive (especially when it comes to exams and attendance in courses), I encrypt folders and files that contain such information. To encrypt a file or folder I right-click on the file or folder and go to properties > advanced, the I check *encrypt contents to secure data* and confirm the changes by checking *OK*. Then I back-up the encryption key where I check *enable certificate privacy* and create password and store the encrypted file in the original folder. You can find a step-by-step guide on how to encrypt files in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0pN0rN8MEM).

# How to organize data

This section will elaborate on hwo to organize and handle (research) data and introduce some basic principles that may help you to keep your data tidy.

## Never delete data!

The first thing to keep in mind when dealing with data is to keep at least one copy of the original data. The original data shoudl never be deleted but, rather, you should copy the data and delete only sections of teh copy while retaining the orginal data intact.
