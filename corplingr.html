&lt;I&gt; &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Ambulance was crap &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; I know that &lt;#&gt; I don&#39;t need you to tell me &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; You were crap &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; I wasn&#39;t crap in Ambulance &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I was going to say you were good but you wouldn&#39;t have liked it &lt;#&gt; No you weren&#39;t bad in it &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; I think with what I had &lt;,&gt; like I think with everybody what they had to do in the play &lt;,&gt; with the exception of Walker they make a bloody good stab at it &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I think Walker did brilliant &lt;S1A-018$C&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;#&gt; I think Walker was really good &lt;/X&gt; &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I thought Walker was by far the best &lt;#&gt; Honestly &lt;S1A-018$C&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah &lt;/X&gt; &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; But the play would have been so much better with somebody really really good in that part &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I thought he was brilliant in that part &lt;#&gt; I really did &lt;#&gt; I really thought he was brilliant in that part &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; He did it totally differently every night &lt;#&gt; I mean totally differently &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well well I saw it on the last night and I thought it was brilliant &lt;#&gt; Honestly &lt;#&gt; And I wouldn&#39;t lie to you &lt;S1A-018$C&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;#&gt; I mean &lt;/X&gt; &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I thought Nadine was crap &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; No Nadine was great &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; But not in your part &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I thought she was good in that part &lt;#&gt; And she was good in the Who Dunnit like &lt;S1A-018$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Mm &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; That was the first time I spoke to Saibh actually &lt;S1A-018$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; What was that Ron Fine &lt;S1A-018$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I said that was the first time I spoke to you &lt;S1A-018$C&gt;

&lt;#&gt; If you go upstairs &lt;#&gt; Do not waste your time standing round downstairs cos it &#39;s just full of old fogies but &lt;,&gt; uhm &lt;,&gt; och yeah it &#39;s &lt;,&gt; it &#39;s alright &lt;#&gt; I wouldn&#39;t be wild about it &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; But it &#39;s not the case &lt;,&gt; it &#39;s when you get to our stage and you &#39;re single &lt;,&gt; you just have to go where the men are &lt;#&gt; It &#39;s as simple as that right &lt;#&gt; There &#39;s no point going to nice bars &lt;,&gt; well they &#39;re not in the nice bars that you sit in corners and have chats in &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Where are the men &lt;S1A-019$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; No &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I mean you have to just go where the market &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well I mean where are you talking &lt;#&gt; La-Lea &lt;,&gt; Magennis &#39;s and the Welly Park and that &#39;s it &lt;#&gt; Or is there other places &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; More or less &lt;#&gt; Like we were in the Apartment &lt;,&gt; Rosie and I two Friday nights ago &lt;#&gt; And it basically then has the people who didn&#39;t get into La-Lea &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Is that right &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Ah that &#39;s &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; You know that &#39;s what the bars now have kind of thing &lt;#&gt; I have no idea where my future husband is &lt;#&gt; He &#39;ll be dropped out of the sky or something because he doesn&#39;t appear to be out and about &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well he may be where you least expect him &lt;S1A-019$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; He may be &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s what everybody says but uhm &lt;,&gt; like obviously where I least expect him cos he &#39;s not fucking showing anywhere &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well the thing about where you would least expect him &lt;#&gt; In work &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yes well &lt;unclear&gt; several sylls &lt;/unclear&gt; &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; You really just hope and pray he &#39;s not there &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; One of the door &lt;,&gt; new doormen or something &lt;S1A-019$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; I used to think with you know PWC upstairs and everything you were bound to bump into loads and loads of men and people &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Just that somebody would knock over your papers and lift them up for you &lt;S1A-019$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Mmm &lt;#&gt; &lt;unclear&gt; 3 sylls &lt;/unclear&gt; &lt;#&gt; Oh you &#39;ve got your wedding shoes on &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yes &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Very nice &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Och they &#39;re grand you know &lt;#&gt; Actually I like them better now &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Are they comfy &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Aye they &#39;re very comfortable Louise you know because I hadn&#39;t broken them in or anything &lt;,&gt; and uh &lt;,&gt; whatchamacallit &lt;,&gt; then the day of the wedding they were no hassle at all &lt;#&gt; So they &#39;re grand &lt;#&gt; I like them with long trousers cos they &lt;,&gt; I don&#39;t like this bit &lt;#&gt; I don&#39;t like that style of shoe &lt;,&gt; you know with two and and then there back &lt;,&gt; you know backless if you like &lt;#&gt; But like if when you &#39;re standing up &lt;,&gt; and you know &lt;,&gt; so it &#39;s only that bit of the sandal &lt;#&gt; Do you know what I mean &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Aye that &#39;s good &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah I see what you mean &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; So I think that &#39;s fine &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s really nice &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; And if I &lt;,&gt; and that &#39;s a wee bag &lt;#&gt; I bought them &lt;,&gt; that for myself for the wedding &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Oh that &#39;s lovely &lt;#&gt; Is that Monsoon &lt;#&gt; Accessorize &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah &lt;#&gt; And the dress was like that exact colour there but &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; That colour at the back &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; You know the bridesmaid &#39;s dress you wore at Rosie &#39;s &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uhm there &#39;s a dress very similar &lt;.&gt; c &lt;/.&gt; in the colour and slightly similar style in Debenham &#39;s &lt;#&gt; I think that colour &#39;s maybe quite popular now &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Aye because there wasn&#39;t many of it &lt;,&gt; or there wasn&#39;t much of it &lt;#&gt; &lt;mention&gt; Many of it &lt;/mention&gt; &lt;,&gt; what was that about &lt;#&gt; There wasn&#39;t much of it whenever we got those dresses and then all of a sudden &lt;,&gt; A the style and B the colour seems to be all the go &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Seems to be in &lt;S1A-019$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; All the rage cos whenever Lorraine and I went down to Dublin to look for dresses it was effectively the same dress with a slight style change in the detail you know but obviously it was proving popular so uhm &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Right &lt;S1A-019$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Sally-Anne obviously you haven&#39;t sat down since you came home &lt;S1A-019$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh no &lt;S1A-019$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Because if you said earlier on you know the way your house was sitting I don&#39;t know how you got it done so quickly &lt;S1A-019$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well I &#39;ll tell you a wee secret &lt;S1A-019$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Your mummy came up &lt;S1A-019$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; I came home and my mum had washed all the floors for me &lt;S1A-019$B&gt; &lt;#&gt;

&lt;I&gt; &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; &lt;.&gt; Lu &lt;/.&gt; Louise did you hear about the taxi driver last week &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; No &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Telling me that uhm he &lt;,&gt; when Sarah and Monica and Laura got out of the taxi &lt;,&gt; cos they uh Laura was parked on University Avenue so when they got out of the taxi the taxi driver was chatting to me and I was like I was just going bloody great because of course Sarah had been chatting away to him and I was going he &#39;s going to be expecting me to be a friendly girl now as well and I just &lt;,&gt; I I can&#39;t be bothered like &lt;#&gt; But he was really really nice actually &lt;#&gt; He said to me I know a few solicitors cos he &#39;d &lt;,&gt; I &#39;d said something &lt;,&gt; and uhm &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Mhm &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; No cos he &#39;d remember that was the whole laugh &lt;#&gt; He asked what do y&#39;all do &lt;#&gt; And you went oh no blah blah blah and he says okay apart from models remember and that &#39;s how &lt;unclear&gt; 3 sylls &lt;/unclear&gt; Sarah &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Mm &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Oh &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; What do you think we do &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s how the craic started &lt;#&gt; Sorry for interrupting Sally-Anne but &lt;,&gt; cos I know you hate saying that you &#39;re a solicitor cos then you usually get sort of &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; No no no &lt;,&gt; uhm &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Oh I had a car accident &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; I &#39;ve a friend who needs such and such &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; So this guy said uhm &lt;,&gt; he knew a partner out of uhm Anderson and Lowe &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Mhm &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; And I was wondering is it Bill Fitzgerald who I had a case against uhm but it wasn&#39;t &lt;#&gt; And then he said &lt;,&gt; uhm &lt;,&gt; so he told me the name of the guy and I didn&#39;t know him and he said uhm &lt;,&gt; aye and I took a girl uh to a formal &lt;,&gt; my school formal &lt;#&gt; She &#39;s a solicitor now &lt;#&gt; Angie McDonagh &lt;#&gt; Did I tell you this &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;#&gt; You &lt;.&gt; t &lt;/.&gt; &lt;,&gt; you told uhm was it &lt;,&gt; did you tell Aaron Speight or something or Stephan &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; No I did not &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; You did &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Oh I told Stephan maybe at &lt;,&gt; I told Stephan when I was opening the post &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s who it was &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh that was it &lt;#&gt; We were opening the post last week &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; And I just thought &lt;,&gt; &lt;.&gt; co &lt;/.&gt; cos you know the way &lt;.&gt; l &lt;/.&gt; like Angie just always looks so perfect and actually she paid to go to this &lt;unclear&gt; 1 syll &lt;/unclear&gt; &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; He he &#39;s so &lt;,&gt; what was his craic &lt;#&gt; Something like you have to or &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well he said you know och well I mean &lt;,&gt; girls like to be asked like you know uh &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; It &#39;s a bonus for them &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s the main thing &lt;#&gt; It &#39;s a bonus for them to be asked so I mean I figured she wouldn&#39;t mind paying and she didn&#39;t &lt;#&gt; He said so if you see her tell her Obie was asking for her &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Obie &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Obie &lt;#&gt; Obie &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; I just think it &#39;s so funny after you seeing her &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; You see Sally-Anne what you need to say to her &lt;,&gt; next time you &#39;re in the gym and you know she &#39;s walking past you you go &lt;#&gt; Obie was asking for you &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s &lt;.&gt; ex &lt;/.&gt; &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s exactly what I &#39;m &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; You paid to go to a formal with him &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Angie I met this guy who knows you and wait til you hear &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; You paid to go to a formal with Obie &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; It &#39;s just quite funny after you meeting her and everything in the gym and her being so bloody &lt;.&gt; r &lt;/.&gt; rude &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Oh did you meet her &lt;#&gt; I didn&#39;t hear that part of it &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well I met her in the gym &lt;#&gt; I met her a couple of times in the gym and she pretended she didn&#39;t see me &lt;#&gt; Then one day she did see &lt;,&gt; like she was literally walking past me and she had to say something &lt;,&gt; and she went hiya &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; But she would &#39;ve chatted away to you when you were a pupil wouldn&#39;t she &lt;S1A-020$?&gt; &lt;#&gt; Like that &#39;s &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Sure I sat in the same office as her &lt;#&gt; We shared an office and got on &lt;,&gt; I mean we did get on &lt;,&gt; well &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Aw she probably didn&#39;t recognise you &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Huh &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; She probably didn&#39;t recognise you &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Are you being funny &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah &lt;#&gt; Well I mean if you &#39;re sitting in an office same office with someone for two years of course you &#39;re going to recognise them &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Oh sorry &lt;#&gt; Right &lt;#&gt; I was going &lt;,&gt; do you do you think &lt;#&gt; Is it the hair &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s what people say you know when you haven&#39;t seen them &lt;,&gt; or you know oh I didn&#39;t recognise you there &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Mm &lt;#&gt; I don&#39;t really understand that one actually I must say uhm so &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; I know because the irony being &lt;,&gt; I mean we &#39;ve all done it &lt;#&gt; You just think I just can&#39;t be assed talking to that person &lt;#&gt; But it takes more out of you to avoid them than it does to say hello what you doing &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah &lt;#&gt; Mm &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; To actually find out &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; And keep walking &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;#&gt; Exactly &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; But Roisin thinks I &#39;m really odd cos if I see people from school who I haven&#39;t seen in a while my immediate reaction is to duck into the nearest shop &lt;#&gt; I mean that &#39;s just my reaction &lt;S1A-020$?&gt; &lt;#&gt; &lt;unclear&gt; 5 syllables &lt;/unclear&gt; &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well you see it &#39;s hard cos &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; It depends on the person too &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; You see but it &#39;s &lt;.&gt; v &lt;/.&gt; I find it very hard because you &#39;re like all &lt;,&gt; you invariably have to ask them so what are you at or what are you up to &lt;#&gt; And then when they &lt;.&gt; s &lt;/.&gt; ask you what are you up to &lt;#&gt; Oh I &#39;m a solicitor &lt;#&gt; I &#39;ve just bought a house blah-de-blah-de-blah they think then that you &#39;ve &lt;.&gt; a &lt;/.&gt; asked this &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Mhm &lt;S1A-020$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; To tell you &lt;,&gt; for you to tell them all about you &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; &lt;unclear&gt; several sylls &lt;/unclear&gt; &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; So I end up saying then like oh I &#39;m just working away in Belfast &lt;#&gt; So you end up getting nowhere with the conversation anyway cos you &#39;re not telling anything &lt;,&gt; you &#39;re not sharing anything &lt;unclear&gt; 1 syll &lt;/unclear&gt; &lt;#&gt; You &#39;ll not get any back &lt;,&gt; you &#39;re no further forward &lt;#&gt; So hello how are you doing and walk on &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yeah &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Would you get a lot of that &lt;#&gt; As in like you &#39;re the big girl who &#39;s going to Belfast and has got a plan and career and all this kind of stuff &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uhm &lt;,&gt; from people who don&#39;t uh know me &lt;,&gt; and &lt;#&gt; But &lt;,&gt; but it &#39;s actually quite funny because at when I was at that christening last Sunday and there was a &lt;.&gt; gi &lt;/.&gt; uh Felice &#39;s aunt used to teach in our school &lt;,&gt; and actually I &#39;m now realising that it &#39;s not a bad thing you know &lt;,&gt; just well I &lt;,&gt; you know I work hard so I think &lt;,&gt; well I am sort of semi-successful so why should I be putting myself down going &lt;,&gt; do you know what I mean &lt;#&gt; But it &lt;S1A-020$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; It it it &#39;s just it wouldn&#39;t occur to the rest of us to even put in the &lt;mention&gt; semi &lt;/mention&gt; &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; I end up &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; You are successful &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; But I end up like over-compensating saying och I &#39;m just working away &lt;#&gt; Instead of saying yeah work &#39;s going well or whatever &lt;#&gt; But yes &lt;,&gt; they would &lt;S1A-020$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; But you are always better to underplay it &lt;S1A-020$D&gt; &lt;#&gt; Yes &lt;,&gt;

risk another beer or shall we try and &lt;,&gt; ride the bikes down there or do something like that &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Well &lt;,&gt; what about the provisions &lt;#&gt; What time

&lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Just the boat &#39;s arriving you know a few minutes &#39; walk away &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; We should maybe sort of ride down &lt;S1A-005$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Slip him ten Euro for the bedding he said &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Ah we &#39;ll do more than that &lt;#&gt; We &#39;ll give him &lt;,&gt; twenty or something and buy a box of chocolates or something nice wee card or something &lt;S1A-005$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Or we could get him uh &lt;,&gt; uhm a bottle from the &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; Easter egg sort of thing &lt;#&gt; He might not drink for all I know &lt;#&gt; Well he does &lt;#&gt; Does he drink &lt;#&gt; I can&#39;t remember &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; He &#39;s a Mason don&#39;t know that means &lt;#&gt; Masons drink &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I don&#39;t know &lt;#&gt; Freemasons &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; My Da joined the Masons out of respect for my Granda &lt;,&gt; cos my Granda was a mad Mason &lt;#&gt; Like whenever when he died he &lt;,&gt; Dad got all sad and stuff &lt;#&gt; He was always trying his mates were always trying to get him to join for the wrong reasons &lt;,&gt; cos he was doing well in the business and all &lt;#&gt; And he was uh they just want my money and all this shite &lt;#&gt; Fuck them &lt;#&gt; I &#39;m never joining them at all &lt;,&gt; &lt;#&gt; I &#39;m I &#39;m getting blackballed and all &lt;#&gt; But he &#39;s not a very good Mason &lt;#&gt; He &#39;s not very secretive &lt;#&gt; And he &lt;.&gt; le &lt;/.&gt; he leaves &lt;S1A-005$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Uh-huh &lt;S1A-005$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; Did he tell you all of his secrets &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; No he hasn&#39;t but uhm he leaves his books lying about and stuff and you can flick through them bits &lt;#&gt; It &#39;s shite &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; All the secrets is if you &#39;re a Mason and you go to court and the judge is a Mason you &#39;ll get a lighter sentence or you &#39;ll get off with it &lt;#&gt; That sort of way &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s how it works &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Very strange &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; If you &#39;re if you &#39;re &lt;S1A-005$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; And they help each other out in business and all &lt;#&gt; Things like that &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; If you &#39;re if you &#39;re if you &#39;re a car builder like if you &#39;re a car builder like a car mechanic guy or like his Dad you &#39;ve a broken car he &#39;ll give you a really good deal and you &#39;ll &lt;,&gt; if you &#39;re a painter he &#39;ll get a really good deal in paint &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; But it never would &#39;ve worked &lt;#&gt; It never would &#39;ve worked because the only other Mason who was a garage guy in Crossgar Dad absolutely hated him and he hated Dad like &lt;#&gt; The two of them detest each other and &lt;,&gt; they were both Masons &lt;#&gt; My Da was going to think if &lt;unclear&gt; 5 sylls &lt;/unclear&gt; I &#39;ve to

remember &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; He &#39;s a Mason don&#39;t know that means &lt;#&gt; Masons drink &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; I don&#39;t know &lt;#&gt; Freemasons &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; My Da joined the Masons out of respect for my Granda &lt;,&gt; cos my Granda was a mad Mason &lt;#&gt; Like whenever when he died he &lt;,&gt; Dad got all sad and stuff &lt;#&gt; He was always trying his mates were always trying to get him to join for the wrong reasons &lt;,&gt; cos he was doing well in the business and all &lt;#&gt; And he was uh they just want my money and all this shite &lt;#&gt; Fuck them &lt;#&gt; I &#39;m never joining them at all &lt;,&gt; &lt;#&gt; I &#39;m I &#39;m getting blackballed and all &lt;#&gt; But he &#39;s not a very good Mason &lt;#&gt; He &#39;s not very

hasn&#39;t but uhm he leaves his books lying about and stuff and you can flick through them bits &lt;#&gt; It &#39;s shite &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; All the secrets is if you &#39;re a Mason and you go to court and the judge is a Mason you &#39;ll get a lighter sentence or you &#39;ll get off with it &lt;#&gt; That sort of way &lt;#&gt; That &#39;s how it works &lt;S1A-005$B&gt; &lt;#&gt; Very strange &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; If you &#39;re if you &#39;re &lt;S1A-005$C&gt; &lt;#&gt; And they help each other out in business and all &lt;#&gt; Things like that &lt;S1A-005$A&gt; &lt;#&gt; If
