# ATAP{-}

LADAL is part of the [**Australian Text Analytics Platform** (ATAP)](https://atap.edu.au/). The aim of ATAP is to provide researchers with a Notebook environment – in other words a tool set - that is more powerful and customisable than standard packages, while being accessible to a large number of researchers who do not have strong coding skills.

# Tools {-}

```

## AntConc (and other Ant tools){-}

[AntConc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) is a freeware corpus analysis toolkit for concordancing and text analysis developed by Laurence Anthony. In addition to AntConc, Laurence Anthony's [AntLab](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/) contains a conglomeration of extremely useful and very user-friendly software tools, that help and facilitate the analysis of textual data. Laurence has really developed an [impressive, very user-friendly selection of tools](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html) that assist anyone interested in working with language data.

```{r smart, echo=FALSE, out.width= "30%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}

```

## SMARTool{-}

[SMARTool](http://smartool.github.io/smartool-rus-eng/) is a corpus-based language learning and analysis tool for for English-speaking learners of Russian. It is linguist-built and thus informed by modern linguistic theory. SMARTool assists learners with coping with the rich Russian morphology and has user-friendly, corpus-based information and help for learning the most frequent forms of 3,000 basic vocabulary items.

## Applied Language Technology{-}

[Applied Language Technology](https://applied-language-technology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a website hosting learning materials for two courses taught at the University of Helsinki: *Working with Text in Python* and *Natural Language Processing for Linguists*. Together, these two courses provide an introduction to applied language technology for audiences who are unfamiliar with language technology and programming. The learning materials assume no previous knowledge of the Python programming language.

## Cultural Analytics with Python{-}

[Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) is a website established by Melanie Walsh that hosts an online textbook which offers an introduction to the programming language Python that is specifically designed for people interested in the humanities and social sciences.

## GLAM Workbench{-}

The [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/) is a collection of tools, tutorials, examples, and hacks to help you work with data from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (the GLAM sector). The primary focus is Australia and New Zealand, but new collections are being added all the time. 

The resources in the GLAM Workbench are created and shared as Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter lets you combine narrative text and live code in an environment that encourages you to learn and explore. Jupyter notebooks run in your browser, and you can get started without installing any software!

One really great advantage of the GLAM workbench is that it is interactive: if you click on one of the links that says *Run live on Binder*, this will open the notebook, ready to use, in a customised computing environment using the Binder service.

## Programming Historian{-}

The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/) is a collaborative blog that contains lessons on various topics associated with computational humanities. The blog  was founded in 2008 by William J. Turkel and Alan MacEachern. It focused heavily on the Python programming language and was published open access as a Network in Canadian History & Environment (NiCHE) *Digital Infrastructure* project. In 2012, Programming Historian expanded its editorial team and launched as an open access peer reviewed scholarly journal of methodology for digital historians. 

## TAPoR 3{-}

[TAPoR 3, the Text Analysis Portal for Research](http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home) contains a unique, well-curated list of a wide variety of tools commonly used or widely respected groups of tools used by leading scholars in the various fields of Digital Humanities. TAPoR 3 was developed with support from the Text Mining the Novel Project. The tools mentioned in the list provided by TAPoR 3 represent both tried and trusted tools used by DH scholars, or new advancements that offer exciting new possibilities in their field. Curated lists are excellent places to start exploring TAPoR from, and can help with deciding what to include in your own lists.

## Sydney Corpus Lab{-}

The [Sydney Corpus Lab](https://sydneycorpuslab.com/) aims to promote corpus linguistics in Australia. It’s a virtual, rather than a physical lab, and is an online platform for connecting computer-based linguists across the University of Sydney and beyond. Its mission is to build research capacity in corpus linguistics at the University of Sydney, to connect Australian corpus linguists, and to promote the method in Australia, both in linguistics and in other disciplines. We have strong links with the Sydney Centre for Language Research (Computational Approaches to Language node) and the Sydney Digital Humanities Research Group.
