# Concordancing with R

This notebook-based tool accompanies the [*Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory* (LADAL) tutorial **Concordancing with R**](https://ladal.edu.au/kwics.html). 

**Preparation and session set up**

We start by activating the packages we need for this tutorial.


```{r prep2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source='klippy'}
# set options
options(warn=-1)  # do not show warnings or messages
# activate packages
library(quanteda) # for concordancing
library(dplyr)    # for table processing
library(writexl)  # for saving data
```



## Using your own data

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
To <b>use your own data</b>, click on the folder called <b>`MyTexts`</b> (it is in the menu to the left of the screen) and then simply drag and drop your txt-files into the folder. <br>When you then execute the code chunk below, you will upload your own data and you can then use it in this notebook.<br>You can upload <b>only txt-files</b> (simple unformatted files created in or saved by a text editor)! <br>The notebook assumes that you upload some form of text data - not tabular data!

```{r}
# load function that helps loading texts
source("https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/loadtxts.R")
# load texts
text <- loadtxts("notebooks/MyTexts")
# inspect the structure of the text object
str(text)
```

## Creating simple concordances

Now we can extract concordances using the `kwic` function from the `quanteda` package. This function has the following arguments: 

+ `x`: a text or collection of texts. The text needs to be tokenised, i.e. split it into individual words, which is why we use the *text* in the `tokens()` function. 
+ `pattern`: a keyword defined by a search pattern  
+ `window`: the size of the context window (how many word before and after)  
+ `valuetype`: the type of pattern matching  
  + "glob" for "glob"-style wildcard expressions;  
  + "regex" for regular expressions; or  
  + "fixed" for exact matching  
+ `separator`: a character to separate words in the output  
+ `case_insensitive`: logical; if TRUE, ignore case when matching a pattern or dictionary values

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>You can easily change and adapt the concordance. For instance, you can search for a different word or phrase by substituting *the* with the word or phrase as the pattern. Additionally, if you wish to widen the context window, just replace the '5' with '10'. This adjustment will extend the context around the keyword by 5 additional words in both the preceding and following context. </b><br>

```{r basekwic2, message=F, warning=F}
mykwic <- kwic(
  # tokenise and define text
  tokens(text), 
  # define target word (this is called the "search pattern")
  pattern = phrase("the"),
  # 5 words before and after
  window = 5,
  # no regex
  valuetype = "regex",
  # words separated by whitespace
  separator = " ",
  # search should be case insensitive
  case_insensitive = TRUE)

# inspect resulting kwic
mykwic %>%
  # convert into a data frame
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # show only first 10 results
  head(10)
```

## Exporting concordances

To export a concordance table as an MS Excel spreadsheet, we use `write_xlsx`. Be aware that we use the `here` function to  save the file in the current working directory.

```{r eval = F, warning=F, message=F}
# save data for MyOutput folder
write_xlsx(mykwic, here::here("notebooks/MyOutput/mykwic.xlsx"))
```

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>You will find the generated MS Excel spreadsheet named *mykwic.xlsx* in the `MyOutput` folder (located on the left side of the screen).</b> <br><br>Simply double-click the `MyOutput` folder icon, then right-click on the *mykwic.xlsx* file, and choose Download from the dropdown menu to download the file. <br>
