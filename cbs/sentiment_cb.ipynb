The entire Rmarkdown document for the tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/cbs/sentiment_cb.Rmd). SA is a cover term for approaches which extract information on emotion or opinion from natural language (Silge and Robinson 2017). SA have been successfully applied to analysis of language data in a wide range of disciplines such as psychology, economics, education, as well as political and social sciences. Commonly SA are used to determine the stance of a larger group of speakers towards a given phenomenon such as political candidates or parties, product lines or situations. Crucially, SA are employed in these domains because they have advantages compared to alternative methods investigating the verbal expression of emotion. One advantage of SA is that the emotion coding of SA is fully replicable.\n",

Most forms of SA provides information about positive or negative polarity, e.g. whether a tweet is *positive* or *negative*. As such, SA represents a type of classifier that assigns values to texts. As most SA only provide information about polarity, SA is often regarded as rather coarse-grained and, thus, rather irrelevant for the types of research questions in linguistics. \n",

For the Word-Emotion Association Lexicon raters were asked whether a given word was associated with one of eight emotions. The resulting associations between terms and emotions are based on 38,726 ratings from 2,216 raters who answered a sequence of questions for each word which were then fed into the emotion association rating (cf. Mohammad and Turney 2013). Each term was rated 5 times. For 85 percent of words, at least 4 raters provided identical ratings. For instance, the word *cry* or *tragedy* are more readily associated with SADNESS while words such as *happy* or *beautiful* are indicative of JOY and words like *fit* or *burst* may indicate ANGER. This means that the SA here allows us to investigate the expression of certain core emotions rather than merely classifying statements along the lines of a crude positive-negative distinction. \n",
