                "Topic models refers to a suit of methods employed to uncover latent structures within a corpus of text. These models operate on the premise of identifying abstract *topics* that recur across documents. In essence, topic models sift through the textual data to discern recurring patterns of word co-occurrence, revealing underlying semantic themes (Busso et al. 2022; Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003a). This technique is particularly prevalent in text mining, where it serves to unveil hidden semantic structures in large volumes of textual data.\n",
                "\n",
                "Conceptually, topics can be understood as clusters of co-occurring terms, indicative of shared semantic domains within the text. The underlying assumption is that if a document pertains to a specific topic, words related to that topic will exhibit higher frequency compared to documents addressing other subjects. For example, in documents discussing dogs, terms like *dog* and *bone* are likely to feature prominently, while in documents focusing on cats, *cat* and *meow* would be more prevalent. Meanwhile, ubiquitous terms such as *the* and *is* are expected to occur with similar frequency across diverse topics, serving as noise rather than indicative signals of topic specificity.\n",
                "\n",
                "Various methods exist for determining topics within topic models. For instance, Gerlach, Peixoto, and Altmann (2018)  and Hyland et al. (2021) advocate for an approach grounded in stochastic block models. However, most applications of topic models use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003a)) or Structural Topic Modeling (Roberts, Stewart, and Tingley 2016).\n",
                "\n",
                "LDA, in particular, emerges as a widely embraced technique for fitting topic models. It operates by treating each document as a blend of topics and each topic as a blend of words. Consequently, documents can exhibit content overlaps, akin to the fluidity observed in natural language usage, rather than being strictly segregated into distinct groups.\n",
                "\n",
                "Gillings and Hardie (2022) state that topic modelling is based on the following key assumptions:\n",
                "\n",
                "* The corpus comprises a substantial number of documents.  \n",
                "* A topic is delineated as a set of words with varying probabilities of occurrence across the documents.  \n",
                "* Each document exhibits diverse degrees of association with multiple topics.  \n",
                "* The collection is structured by underlying topics, which are finite in number, organizing the corpus.  \n",
                "\n",
                "Given the availability of vast amounts of textual data, topic models can help to organize and offer insights and assist in understanding large collections of unstructured text and they are widely used in natural language processing and computational text analytics. However, the use of topic modelling in discourse studies has received criticism (Brookes and McEnery 2019)  due to the following issues: \n",
                "\n",
                "1. **Thematic Coherence**: While topic modeling can group texts into *topics*, the degree of thematic coherence varies. Some topics may be thematically coherent, but others may lack cohesion or accuracy in capturing the underlying themes present in the texts.\n",
                "\n",
                "2. **Nuanced Perspective**: Compared to more traditional approaches to discourse analysis, topic modeling often provides a less nuanced perspective on the data. The automatically generated topics may overlook subtle nuances and intricacies present in the texts, leading to a less accurate representation of the discourse.\n",
                "\n",
                "3. **Distance from Reality**: Brookes and McEnery (2019)  suggest that the insights derived from topic modeling may not fully capture the \"reality\" of the texts. The topics generated by the model may not accurately reflect the complex nature of the discourse, leading to potential misinterpretations or oversimplifications of the data.\n",
                "\n",
                "4. **Utility for Discourse Analysts**: While topic modeling may offer a method for organizing and studying sizable data sets, Brookes and McEnery (2019)  questions the utility for discourse analysts and suggests that traditional discourse analysis methods consistently provide a more nuanced and accurate perspective on the data compared to topic modeling approaches.\n",
                "\n",
                "This criticism is certainly valid if topic modeling is solely reliant on a purely data-driven approach without human intervention. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to combine data-driven topic modeling with human-supervised seeded methods to arrive at more reliable and accurate topics.\n",

In this step, we ensure that only terms with a certain minimum frequency in the corpus are included (we set the minimum frequency to 5). This selection process not only speeds up the model calculation but also helps improve the model's accuracy by focusing on more relevant and frequently occurring terms.
