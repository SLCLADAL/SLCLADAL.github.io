We can also use `str_squish` to get rid of superfluous white spaces. We will always remove sequences that are defined by a string (a sequence of characters and a regular expression consisting of the regular expression that determines what type of symbol R is supposed to look for and a numerator which tells R how many times that symbol can occur). For example, `%mor:.*` tells R to look for the sequence `%mor:` and any symbol, repeated between zero and an infinite number of times, that comes after the `%mor:` sequence. As this is put into the `str_replace_all` function and applied to the `rawcontent` file, it will replace everything that comes after `%mor:` and the sequence `%mor:` itself.\n",

                "This case study represents a corpus-based study of sociolinguistic variation that aims to answer if swearing differs across social groups. In particular, this case study analyzes if speakers coming from different age groups and genders, i.e. whether old or young or men or women swear more, differ in their use of swear words based on a sub-sample of the Irish component of the [International Corpus of English (ICE)](https://www.ice-corpora.uzh.ch/en.html). The case study represents a simplified version of the analysis of [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384117304357) [@schweinberger2018swearing].\n",
