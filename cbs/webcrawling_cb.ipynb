[The tutorial](https://tm4ss.github.io/docs/index.html) by Andreas Niekler and Gregor Wiedemann is more thorough, goes into more detail than this tutorial, and overs many more very useful text mining methods. An alternative approach for web crawling and scraping would be to use the `RCrawler` package [@khalil2017rcrawler] which is not introduced here thought (inspecting the `RCrawler` package and its functions is, however, also highly recommended). For a more in-depth introduction to web crawling in scraping, @miner2012practical is a very useful introduction.\n",
