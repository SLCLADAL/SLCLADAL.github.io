                "This tutorial introduces basic inferential procedures for hypothesis testing. The tutorial focuses on the implementation of these statistical tests in R, but it also covers the conceptual underpinnings of the most commonly used tests (such as t-tests and $\\chi^2$-tests. The R-markdown document of this tutorial  can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/basicstatz.Rmd). After the session preparation, we start by getting to know how to test if the assumptions fro parametric tests are met - this allows us to ascertain if we should use a parametric or a non-parametric test. The next part of this tutorial then focuses on basic parametric tests such as independent and dependent t-tests while the last part of the tutorial introduces on non-parametric tests such as the $\\chi$^2^ family of tests. \n",

If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).\n"

                "One of the most frequently used statistical test in linguistics is the $\\chi$^2^ test (or Pearsons's chi-square test, chi-squared test, or chi-square test). We will use a simple, practical example to explore how this test works. In this example, we will test whether speakers of American English (AmE) and speakers of British English (BrE) differ in their use of the near-synonyms *sort of* and *kind of* as in \"*He's sort of stupid*\" and \"*He's kind of stupid*\". As a first step, we formulate the hypothesis that we want to test (H~1~) and its null hypothesis (H~0~). The alternative- or test hypothesis reads:\n",
                "\n",
                "H~1~: Speakers of AmE and BrE differ with respect to their preference for *sort of* and *kind of*.\n",

                "The H~0~ claims the non-existence of something (which is the more conservative position) and in our example the non-existence of a correlation between variety of English and the use of *sort of* and *kind of*. The question now arises what has to be the case in order to reject the H~0~ in favor of the H~1~.\n",
                "\n",
                "To answer this question, we require information about the probability of error, i.e. the probability that the H~0~ does indeed hold for the entire population. Before performing the chi-square test, we follow the convention that the required significance level is 5 percent. In other words, we will reject the H~0~ if the likelihood for the H$_{0}$ being true is less than 5 percent given the distribution of the data. In that case, i.e. in case that the likelihood for the H~0~ being true is less than 5 percent, we consider the result of the  chi-square test as  statistically significant. This means that the observed distribution makes it very unlikely that there is no correlation between the variety of English and the use of *sort of* and *kind of*.\n",
