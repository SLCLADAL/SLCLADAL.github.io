Concordancing are central to analyses of text and they often represents the first step in more sophisticated analyses of language data [@stafanowitsch2020corpus]. The play such a key role in the language sciences because concordances are extremely valuable for understanding how a word or phrase is used, how often it is used, and in which contexts is used. As concordances allow us to analyze the context in which a word or phrase occurs and provide frequency information about word use, they also enable us to analyze collocations or the collocational profiles of words and phrases [@stafanowitsch2020corpus 50-51]. Finally, concordances can also be used to extract examples and it is a very common procedure. \n"

The Replication Crisis is a ongoing methodological crisis primarily affecting parts of the social and life sciences beginning in the early 2010s [see also @fanelli2009fraud]. Replication is important so that other researchers, or the public for that matter, can see or, indeed, reproduce, exactly what you have done. Fortunately, R allows you to document your entire workflow as you can store everything you do in what is called a script or a notebook (in fact, this document was originally a R notebook).
