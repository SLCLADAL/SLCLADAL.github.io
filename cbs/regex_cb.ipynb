A regular expression (in short also called *regex* or *regexp*) is a special sequence of characters (or string) for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as very powerful combinations of wildcards or as wildcards on steroids. \n",

Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).\n"
