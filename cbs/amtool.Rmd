This notebook-based tool accompanies the [Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL) tutorial *Analyzing Collocations, N-grams, and Keywords in R*](https://ladal.edu.au/coll.html).

## Using your own data

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
To <b>use your own data</b>, click on the folder called <b>`MyTexts`</b> (it is in the menu to the left of the screen) and then simply drag and drop your txt-files into the folder. <br>When you then execute the code chunk below, you will upload your own data and you can then use it in this notebook.<br>You can upload <b>only txt-files</b> (simple unformatted files created in or saved by a text editor)! <br>The notebook assumes that you upload some form of text data - not tabular data! 
<br>

<br>


```{r}
# load function that helps loading texts
source("https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/loadtxts.R")
# load texts
text <- loadtxts("notebooks/MyTexts")
# inspect the structure of the text object
str(text)
```


We now prepare the table so that we can extract the association measures.


```{r}
# load function that extract association measures
source("https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/prepam.R")
# load texts
colldf <- prepam(text)
# inspect first 10 rows of the data
head(colldf, 10)
```


Next, we select the term that we want to extract collocates of.

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: only execute the following code chunk if if you are interested in the collocates of a specific term! <br>
Do NOT execute the following code chunk if you are interested in ALL collocations in the text (this would be unusual though). 
<br>
</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
</p></span>
</div>

<br>

Replace `YOUR TERM` with the term you are intersted in.

```{r}
colldf %>%
  dplyr::filter(w1 == "YOUR TERM") -> colldf
# inspect
head(colldf)
```


Now, we extract the association measures (if the table has many rows, this may take a few minutes).

```{r}
# load function that extract association measures
source("https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/assocstats.R")
# calculate collocation statistics
assocs <- assocstats(colldf) 
# inspect first 10 rows of the data
head(assocs, 10)
```


## Exporting the association table

To export the table with the association measures as an MS Excel spreadsheet, we use `write_xlsx`. Be aware that we use the `here` function to  save the file in the current working directory.

```{r eval = F, warning=F, message=F}
# save data for MyOutput folder
write_xlsx(assocs, here::here("notebooks/MyOutput/assocs.xlsx"))
```

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>You will find the generated MS Excel spreadsheet named *assocs.xlsx* in the `MyOutput` folder (located on the left side of the screen).</b> <br><br>Simply double-click the `MyOutput` folder icon, then right-click on the *assocs.xlsx* file, and choose Download from the dropdown menu to download the file. <br>
</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
</p></span>
</div>

<br>

## Visualising collocations

Here we will use a simple bar plot to visualize the 20 top collocations. The bar plot uses the *DeltaP12* value but you are welcome to visualize another association measure (simply replace `DeltaP12` with the measure you want to use).

```{r}
# sort the assocs data frame in descending order based on the 'DeltaP12' column
assocs %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-DeltaP12) %>%
  # select the top 20 rows after sorting
  head(20) %>%
  # create a ggplot with 'token' on the x-axis (reordered by 'DeltaP12') and 'DeltaP12' on the y-axis
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(w2, DeltaP12, mean), y = DeltaP12, label = DeltaP12)) +
  # add a bar plot using the 'DeltaP12' values
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  # add text labels above the bars with rounded 'DeltaP12' values
  geom_text(aes(y = DeltaP12 - 0.005, label = round(DeltaP12, 3)), color = "white", size = 3) + 
  # flip the coordinates to have horizontal bars
  coord_flip() +
  # set the theme to a basic white and black theme
  theme_bw() +
  # add axes titles
  labs(x = "Collocate", y = "Association strength")
```


## Exporting images

To export network graph as an png-file, we use `ggsave`. Be aware that we use the `here` function to save the file in the `MyOutput` folder.

The `ggsave` function has the following main arguments:

+ `filename`: File name to create on disk.    
+ `device`: Device to use. Can either be a device function (e.g. png), or one of "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex), "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only). If NULL (default), the device is guessed based on the filename extension  
+ `path`: Path of the directory to save plot to: path and filename are combined to create the fully qualified file name. Defaults to the working directory.  
+ `width, height`: Plot size in units expressed by the units argument. If not supplied, uses the size of the current graphics device.  
+ `units`: One of the following units in which the width and height arguments are expressed: "in", "cm", "mm" or "px".  
+ `dpi`: Plot resolution. Also accepts a string input: "retina" (320), "print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster output types.  
+ `bg`: Background colour. If NULL, uses the plot.background fill value from the plot theme.  


```{r eval = F, warning=F, message=F}
# save network graph for MyOutput folder
ggsave(here::here("notebooks/MyOutput/image_01.png"), bg = "white")
```

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>You will find the image-file named *image_01.png* in the `MyOutput` folder (located on the left side of the screen).</b> <br><br>Simply double-click the `MyOutput` folder icon, then right-click on the *image_01.png* file, and choose Download from the dropdown menu to download the file. <br>
