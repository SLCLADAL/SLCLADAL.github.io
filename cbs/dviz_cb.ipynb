The *basic* framework, the *lattice* framework, and the *ggplot* or *tidyverse* framework. These frameworks reflect the changing nature of R as a programming language (or as a programming environment). The so-called *base R* consists of about 30 packages that are always loaded automatically when you open R - it is, so to say - the default version of using R when nothing else is loaded. The *base R* framework is the oldest way to generate visualizations in R that was used when other packages did not exists yet. However, *base R* can and is still used to create visualizations although most visualizations are now generated using the *ggplot* or *tidyverse* framework. \n",

Thus, ggplots typically start with the function call (`ggplot`) followed by the specification of the data, then the aesthetics (`aes`), and then a specification of the type of plot that is created (`geom_line` for line graphs, `geom_box` for box plots, `geom_bar` for bar graphs, `geom_text` for text, etc.). In addition, ggplot allows to specify all elements that the graph consists of (e.g. the theme and axes).\n",

To elaborate, fifty percent of data points fall within the box while seventy-five percent of data points fall within the whiskers (the lines which look like extended error bars): the box thus encompasses the interquartile range between the first and third quartile. The whiskers show the minimum and maximum values in the data and only outliers (data points that lie 1.5 times the interquartile range or more above the third quartile or 1.5 times the interquartile range or more below the first quartile.
