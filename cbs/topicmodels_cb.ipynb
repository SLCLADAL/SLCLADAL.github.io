Topic models represent a type of statistical model that is use to discover more or less abstract *topics* in a given selection of documents. Topic models are particularly common in text mining  to unearth hidden semantic structures in textual data. Topics can be conceived of as networks of collocation terms that, because of the co-occurrence across documents, can be assumed to refer to the same semantic domain (or topic). This assumes that, if a document is about a certain topic, one would expect words, that are related to that topic, to appear in the document more often than in documents that deal with other topics. For instance, *dog* and *bone* will appear more often in documents about dogs whereas *cat* and *meow* will appear in documents about cats. Terms like *the* and *is* will, however, appear approximately equally in both. \n",
