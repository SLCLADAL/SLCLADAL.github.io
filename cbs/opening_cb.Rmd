**Recording link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLocET9CC-E&t=253s

**Abstract**

In this talk, Stefan gave a brief and relatively practical introduction to an approach called MuPDAR(F) (for *Multifactorial Prediction and Deviation Analysis using Regressions/Random Forests*) that he developed (see @gries2014using, @gries2014subject for the first applications). The main part of the talk involved using a version of the data in @gries2014subject to exemplify how this protocol works and how it can be done in R. Second, Stefan discussed a few recent extensions proposed in  @gries2020theresmore and  @griestamupdar, which have to do with 

(i) how to deal with situations with more than two linguistic choices, 

(ii) how predictions are made, and

(iii) how deviations are quantified. 

Finally, he briefly comment on exploring individual variation among the target speakers (based on @gries2021examining).

**Abstract**

Shana Poplack has set benchmarks for the development of corpora since the early 1980s. Poplack (2015, p. 921) maintains that the “gold standard remains the (standard sociolinguistic-style) ... corpus”. The aim of producing corpora using these principles is to avoid the ‘cherry picking’ approach which dominates much of the theoretical literature. Poplack and her team have created the Ottawa-Hull Corpus which consists of 3.5 million words of informal speech data. This corpus is enormous and beyond the capabilities of a single linguist in a small language community. This talk offers suggestions for corpus development in the field that follow Poplack’s principles, but also shows where compromises can be made. I discuss the method developed during the Gurindji Kriol project called ‘peer elicitation’. It supplements Poplack’s gold standard of naturally occurring speech with semi-formal elicitation to ensure sufficient data for quantitative analyses. </summary>

knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/redfern.jpg")
```

This talk was recorded July 1, 2021, as part of the LADAL Opening Webinar Series 2021.


**Recording on YouTube**: https://youtu.be/g54yLpYefbI

**Abstract**

In this *golden age of Indigenous television* [@sebbens2020golden], it is important to analyze Indigenous-authored drama series, so that we can move beyond ‘a deficit perspective’ [@charity2020racial, 216] in relation to mediated linguistic diversity. This talk presents a corpus linguistic case study of Australian Aboriginal English (AAE) lexis as present in three such Indigenous-authored television series: *Redfern Now*, *Cleverman*, and *Mystery Road*. For television viewers, mediated AAE can be an important source of information, especially if they do not regularly interact with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. This would be the case for many Australians, and even more so for international viewers of Australian television series. All three analyzed series were exported overseas and thus have both Australian and international audiences. Using lexical profiling analysis [AntWordProfiler; @anthony2013antword] in combination with qualitative concordance analysis, the talk identifies and compares the use of AAE lexis across the three series. Analysis of frequency and distribution will pinpoint words that appear to be particularly significant lexical resources in mediated AAE. The talk will be framed through the notion of diversity, as conceptualised in relation to television series. </summary>

An *Open Science Foundation* (OSF) repository containing the R code and data used for the case study in this talk are available [**here**](https://osf.io/5akts/). [Here is a link](https://github.com/vasishth) to the GitHub repo of Shravan Vasishth (Professor for Psycholinguisics at the University of Potsdam) with additional resources on Bayesian statistics.

**Abstract**

Bayesian inference is becoming increasingly popular in linguistic research. In this talk I will compare frequentist (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian approaches to generalized linear mixed-effects regression, which is *de facto* the standard method for testing linguistic hypotheses about linguistic variation. The main advantages of Bayesian inference include an opportunity to test the research hypothesis directly, instead of trying to reject the null hypothesis. One can also use information from previous research as priors for subsequent models, which helps to overcome the recent crisis of reproducibility. This also enables one to use smaller samples. It helps to solve such problems as overfitting, data separation and convergence issues, which often arise when one fits generalized mixed-effect models with complex structure. These advantages will be illustrated by a multifactorial case study of *help* + (*to*-)infinitive in US magazines, as in the example *These simple tips will help you (to) survive the Zombie apocalypse*.</summary>

**Resources**: The materials, including scripts, files, etc., can be accessed via and downloaded from [this GitHub  repository](https://github.com/myrtevos/magnus-jspsych).

**Abstract**

Web-based studies are an increasingly popular and attractive alternative to lab- and field-based studies, enabling remote data collection for a rapidly growing variety of (psycho-)linguistic methods ranging from acceptability judgment tasks and self-paced reading to interactive group designs and the Visual World paradigm. Most platforms for building and hosting online studies are proprietary and subscription-based (e.g., Gorilla, Pavlovia, and FindingFive), but there also exist various free, open-source tools for writing and managing studies on your own server. This talk gives a practical introduction to building and hosting studies using jsPsych [@leeuw2015jspsych] and JATOS [@lange2015jatos], by demonstrating a *speedrun* of the entire process: from an empty file in a code editor, to distributing URLs to participants.</summary>

**Resources**: The materials that are mentioned in this presentation can be accessed via the following url: https://www.qcif.edu.au/training/training-courses/


**Abstract**

The idea that you can duplicate an experiment and get the same conclusion is the basis for all scientific discoveries. Reproducible research is data analysis that starts with the raw data and offers a transparent workflow to arrive at the same results and conclusions. However not all studies are replicable due to lack of information on the process. Therefore, reproducibility in research is extremely important.    
Researchers genuinely want to make their research more reproducible, but sometimes don’t know where to start and often don’t have the available time to investigate or establish methods on how reproducible research can speed up every day work. 
We aim for the philosophy “Be better than you were yesterday”. Reproducibility is a process, and we highlight there is no expectation to go from beginner to expert in a single workshop. Instead, we offer some steps you can take towards the reproducibility path following our Steps to Reproducible Research self paced program. </summary>

## Neurolinguistics of Bilingualism (DeLuca, Voits & Rothman){-}

``` 

This talk was recorded July 28, 2021, as part of the LADAL Opening Webinar Series 2021.


**Recording on YouTube**: https://youtu.be/wVBkUSPQFUw

**Abstract**

Much research over the past two decades shows that bilingualism affects brain structure, function, and potentially domain-general cognition [see e.g., @bialystok2017bilingadapt; @pliatsikas2019understanding]. The specificity of these effects, however, has become the subject of significant debate in recent years, in large part due to variability of findings across studies [see @leivada2020phantom for review]. In this talk, we will introduce our research programs within the [*Psycholinguistics of Language Representation*](https://site.uit.no/polar/) (PoLaR) lab that addresses the juxtaposition of data and argumentation. Our work is guided by the principle that although bilingual effects are existent, they are conditional. In other words, bilingualism per se is not a sufficient condition for relevant effects on neurocognition. We will review our work that is generally designed to test the hypothesis that specific experience-based factors (EBFs) variably affect neural activity and plasticity in brain regions and pathways implicated in language- and executive control across the lifespan. We present results from a series of MRI studies showing a specificity of neural adaptations to different EBFs [@deluca2019immersion; @deluca2019redefining;  @deluca2020duration] in younger adults. We will also present data from older adults, showing similar EBF effects in healthy cognitive ageing [@voitseffects] and with mild cognitive impairment [@voitsbilingualism]. EBFs related to duration of bilingual language use correlate to neurocognitive adaptations suggesting increased efficiency in language control, whereas those related to extent of additional language use correlate with adaptations suggesting increased control demands. Considered together, these data suggest that the brain strives to be maximally effective and efficient in language processing and control, which in turn affects domain-general cognitive processes proportionally to degree of engagement with bilingual experiences. The work in older populations leads to the conclusion that degree of engagement with bilingualism is a catalyst for cognitive/brain reserve and thus has some real-world benefits in aging.</summary>

**Abstract**

Linguists have adopted several methods from data science, but network analysis has been used rather less than others even though it is a useful tool. This presentation will introduce the basics of using network analysis, discussing the types of problems for which the method is useful, the kinds of data which are amenable to analysis, and the graphical outputs which can be achieved. These points will be illustrated with several examples from different areas of linguistic research, as well as with an example with data concerning a social network.</summary>

**Resources**: See [here for a guide on how to use Elpis](https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki).

**Abstract**

Speech recognition (ASR) technologies can be useful to accelerate transcription of language recordings, and to provide new insights into corpora. ASR tools are available now for hundreds of languages from commercial providers and can be trained for languages that are not commercially supported. However, there are significant hurdles to using ASR tools, from the preparation of data through to the training of the systems. This presentation introduces the motivations and process of co-designing Elpis, a speech recognition system built to be usable by ordinary working linguits. We discuss some examples of using Elpis with a range of low-resource language corpora, and how the co-design process can be used to benefit other language technologies.</summary>

**Recording on YouTube**: https://youtu.be/kfb7xLC2nBs 

**Abstract**

Societal big data today provides a large source of language data in naturalistic settings. Such data have substantially enlarged pools of evidence in various fields in social sciences and the humanities. In linguistics, one direct impact has been the emergence of computational sociolinguistics, a field that intersects sociolinguistics with computational techniques.

However, social big data have one major limitation, at least when it comes to computational sociolinguistics. This limitation, quite surprisingly, concerns the lack of social background information. Researchers have no direct access to background information (author’s gender, social layer, education, occupation, etc.), and it is difficult to combine evidence from social media with rich social information for the simple reason that such information is not available for proprietary reasons. If some social information is available, it is often self-reported and therefore prone to inaccuracies. Or, it is ethically unsustainable to link big language data with socio-cultural information (cf. the Cambridge Analytica scandal). 

This talk introduces a method that is being developed in my SOCOS research group. The method builds on social network theory and utilizes freely available interaction data. These data can be quantified easily through a set of algorithms and used as proxies for social parameters. One downside is that it requires some degree of technical competence to extract these data, which can easily be accomplished through interdisciplinary partnerships in digital humanities environments. </summary>

**Recording on YouTube**: https://youtu.be/JlHchgpzO3o

**Abstract**

This paper explores how corpus technology and DDL pedagogy can support secondary schoolgirls’ reporting of an observed science experiment through a written research report, focusing particularly on how corpora were used to develop receptive and productive knowledge of passive voice constructions. A pre-test of the grammaticality of passive constructions was conducted, alongside a diagnostic pre-instruction written report requiring the retelling of an observed science experiment were collected from 60 Year 9-10 girls at a high school in Australia. During a full 10-week term, students were given guided individual homework tasks and short in-class pair/group DDL activities focusing on passive voice constructions, using freely available online corpus applications such as SketchEngine. Following this treatment, a post-test was conducted while an additional written research report was collected. Questionnaire and interview data was also collected to determine the perceptions of younger female learners and their teachers regarding their engagement with corpora and DDL for improving knowledge and use of passive constructions over time. The data suggest that while the DDL treatment did not result in increased receptive knowledge of the grammaticality of passive voice constructions, their productive use of the passive was significantly improved.  Moreover, when students were given the opportunity to use corpora to check their intuitions in the post-test, they produced accurate responses over 75% of the time. Qualitative stakeholder perceptions of improved disciplinary linguistic knowledge, increased data management skills, and positive engagement with “science” were also found in the survey/interview data, although a number of challenges at the technical and conceptual levels for DDL still remain.</summary>

**Abstract**

Social sciences have opened up to text mining, i.e., a set of methods to automatically identify semantic structures in large document collections. However, the methods have often been limited to a statistical analysis of textual data, strongly limiting the scope of possible research questions. The more complex concepts central to the social sciences such as arguments, frames, narratives and claims still are mainly studied using manual content analyses in which the knowledge needed to apply a category (i.e. to “code”) is verbally described in a codebook and implicit in the coder’s own background knowledge. Supervised machine learning provides an approach to scale-up this coding process to large datasets. Recent advantages in neural network-based natural language processing allow for pretraining language models that can transfer semantic knowledge from unsupervised text collections to specific automatic coding problems. With deep learning models such as BERT automatic coding of context-sensitive semantics with substantially lowered efforts in training data generation comes within reach to content analysis. The talk will introduce to the applied usage of these technologies along with two interdisciplinary research projects studying hate speech and counter speech in German Facebook postings, and information extraction for the analysis of the coverage of protest events in local news media.</summary>

**Abstract**

Our presentation falls into three parts. It begins with Terttu’s brief introduction to the Research Unit for Variation, Contacts and Change in English (VARIENG), its past, present and future, and its current open-access resources.
In addition, the talk presents two short cases studies touching on the methodology of corpus linguistics  from different perspectives. The first one (by Turo) discusses how the availability of massive text archives may hold great promise for corpus linguistic work, but they may also present considerable methodological challenges for users [see e.g. @hiltunen2017evidence]. In focus here are some specific problems related to the diachronic British Library Newspapers database, and how those problems might be addressed in the context of register analysis and the study of linguistic variation.
The second case study (by Aatu) looks into the role of text length in register-internal variation by analyzing a big data sample of social media comments. Different registers seem to exhibit different kinds of internal functional variation by text length (as shown by the illustration). </summary>

**Abstract**

*AntConc* is a widely used desktop corpus tool that has been downloaded over 2.5 million times since its first release in the early 2000s. Today, it is used by researchers, teachers, and learners in over 140 countries and its tutorial videos have been viewed over 500,000 times. AntConc has a relatively easy-to-use design and works especially well with small corpora of under a few million words. However, it begins to struggle when processing larger corpora and offers relatively few statistics for advanced analysis. In this talk, I will introduce a new version of AntConc (version 4.0) that has been built from the ground up to addresses these limitations. The new version includes features that allow the software to be easily extended, and it produces results in a way that allows for smooth data interoperability with other tools and scripts. I will also discuss various issues that need to be considered when developing software for a broad user base, which should be of interest to both users and developers of software tools.</summary>

[Link to the latest issue of CogniTextes](https://journals.openedition.org/cognitextes/1936)

**Abstract**

Computational linguistics offers promising tools for tracking language change in diachronic corpora. These tools exploit distributional semantic models, both old and new. DSMs tend to perform well at the level of lexical semantics but are more difficult to fine-tune when it comes to capturing grammatical meaning.

I present ways in which the above can be improved. I start from well-trodden methodological paths implemented in diachronic construction grammar: changes in the collocational patterns of a linguistic unit reflect changes in meaning/function; distributional word representations can be supplemented with frequency-based methods. I move on to show that when meaning is apprehended with predictive models (e.g. word2vec), one can trace semantic shifts with greater explanatory power than with count models. Although this idea may sound outdated from the perspective of NLP, it actually goes great ways from the viewpoint of theory-informed corpus linguistics.

I illustrate the above with several case studies, one of which involves complex locative prepositions in the Corpus of Historical American English. I conclude my talk by defending the idea that NLP, with its focus on computational efficiency, and corpus-linguistics, with its focus on tools that maximize data inspection, have much to gain from getting closer.

The repository is open access, which means that all information is available to everyone. All postings are accompanied by searchable metadata that identify the researchers, the languages and linguistic phenomena involved, the statistical methods applied, and scholarly publications based on the data (where relevant).

**Abstract**

Many languages have rich inflectional morphology signaling grammatical categories such as case, number, tense, etc. Rich morphology presents a challenge for L2 learners because even a basic vocabulary of a few thousand words can entail mastery of over 100,000 word forms. However, only a handful of the potential forms of a given word occur frequently, while the remainder are rare. Access to digital corpora makes it possible to determine which forms of any given word are of highest frequency, as well as what grammatical and collocational contexts motivate those few frequent forms, facilitating strategically focused language learning tools. Corpus analysis of the frequency distributions of inflectional forms provide linguists with added insights into the function of languages. The results achieved primarily by using correspondence analysis of Russian material are potentially portable to any language with rich inflectional morphology. </summary>

**Abstract**

This talk introduces our new project, Rise of Commercial Society and Eighteenth-Century Publishing, by discussing its premises and a pilot study. Combining historical sociolinguistics with intellectual history, book history and data science, the project studies the eighteenth-century print media and publishing networks that enabled the rise of commercial society and its conceptualization in the eighteenth-century Anglophone world. The chief focus is on Scottish, transatlantic and French influences on British print media.

A key innovation in our project is that we connect the study of eighteenth-century publishing networks with that of language variation and change to gain results that are of interest to both linguists and historians. To do this, we link enriched bibliographic metadata with full-text sources for historical-sociolinguistic analysis. Our main interest is in charting the use and spread of new vocabulary in the networks to better understand how the discourse develops over time. Instead of focusing on well-known authors, we will identify influencers in a data-driven way; these can also be printers or publishers. By combining network analysis with text mining and social metadata on the actors, we are able to conduct large-scale analyses of how linguistic and stylistic changes spread across social groups in eighteenth-century public discourse.

It is also at the centre of major platforms like GitHub and GitLab, used by millions to share and collaborate on code and documents. 

In this workshop, you will learn about:

* The main commands used in a git workflow

* How to publish your work online
* How to collaborate on a GitHub repository

If you would like to follow along, please do the following before attending:

* Install Git on your computer (here are [OS-specific instructions](https://gitlab.com/stragu/DSH/-/blob/master/Git/installation.md))

* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) if you want an alternative)

**Resources**: [Reproducible research: Strategies, tools, and workflows](https://varieng.helsinki.fi/series/volumes/19/flanagan/)

**Abstract**

Scientific progress has long rested on the often unstated assumptions that research is reproducible (i.e., independent analysts can recreate the results claimed by the original authors by using the original data and analysis techniques), replicable (the results claimed by analysts extends beyond the original data to some wider population or phenomenon), and robust (the findings reported by analysts are not ovely sensitive to assumptions in their model). Recently, however, there have been growing concerns about the extent to which current research practices can meet these assumptions. In this talk, I'll present a high-level discussion of these issues, defining the key terms, demonstrating how and why questions have been raised about why work may not be as reproducible, replicable, or robust as we may wish, and offer some tentative suggestions for and examples of improving the reproducibility, replicability, and robustness of linguistic research in the future.

**Resources**: [LADAL tutorial on Phylogentics for language data](https://slcladal.github.io/phylo.html)

**Abstract**

In this talk, we attempt two tasks. Firstly, we dispel some of the mystery around phylogenetic comparative methods and highlight their fundamental relationship to matters of enduring concern in linguistic typology. Secondly, we aim to show how linguists can carry out essential tasks using phylogenetic methods, easily. 

We begin by laying out the historical commonalities between typology and comparative biology, and the breakthrough insight that makes phylogenetic comparative methods distinct. This is followed by an overview of some fundamental phylogenetic concepts and tools. Finally, we illustrate these with a typological case study from the Pama-Nyungan languages. Our talk is accompanied by online interactive materials, demonstrating how phylogenetic comparative methods can be incorporated into everyday typological workflows.

This talk was recorded Nov. 11, 2021, as part of the LADAL Opening Webinar Series 2021.


**Recording on YouTube**: https://youtu.be/YBC_y12bcF8


**Abstract**

In recent years, linguists have focused on reconstructing earlier regional and social varieties of English through the quantitative analysis of emigrant letters and other written documents. As demonstrated in these studies this type of material can provide important, quantifiable data on certain features proper to a particular variety, thus allowing for the reconstruction of some of the features proper to that variety prior to the collection of spoken data.

The aim of this talk is to present the Corpus of Irish English Correspondence (CORIECOR), a corpus of personal letters written between 1750-1940. The corpus contains some 4700 texts (approx. 3 million words), of which 4100 (2.5m words) are correspondence maintained between Irish emigrants and their relatives, friends and contacts. The letters were sent mainly between Ireland and other countries such as the United States, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand, Argentina and Australia, and therefore provide an empirical base for studies of historical change in Irish English and its contribution to other major overseas varieties. In order to explore the use of a corpus like this for the study of Irish English, the talk will show some recent findings.
