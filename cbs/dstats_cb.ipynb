Both classes take the same exam and, after correcting and grading the exams, someone asks you which class performed better. You could of course say something along the lines of *Well, class A had 5 Bs, 10 Cs, 12 Ds, and 2 Fs while class B had 2 As, 8 Bs, 10 Ds, and 4 Fs* but this answer is not really satisfying. Descriptive statistics enable you to summarize complex data sets in very few words and using only very basic, and easy to understand, concepts. And this is what we will be dealing with in the following. \n",

Thus, on a more general note, we will be dealing only with one particular subbranch of statistics. Statistics in general can be defined as a branch of mathematics that deals with data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. As such, statistics can be subdivided into two main areas. *Descriptive statistics* deals with the description of data and their visualization, while *inferential statistics* deals with data analysis and interpretation. Typically, this means testing assumptions about correlations between variables (see for example [here](https://slcladal.github.io/basicstatzregression.html)). As stated above, here, we will be dealing with the description of data, especially with *measures of central tendency*, *measures of variability* and *confidence intervals*.\n",

To illustrate this, imagine you are interested whether the use of discourse particles differs across two corpora. The two corpora represent the speech of the same five speakers but in different situations and the speech thus represents different registers. In a first step, you calculate the relative frequency of discourse particle use and both corpora have a mean of 13.4 particles per 1,000 words. Given the mean, the two corpora do not seem to differ. However, when tabulating and plotting the use of particles by speaker and across these two corpora, it becomes immediately clear that the mean is not the appropriate measure of  central tendency as the distributions are very dissimilar.  \n"
