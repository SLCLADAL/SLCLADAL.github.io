# Analyzing learner language using R


This tutorial is the interactive Jupyter notebook accompanying the [*Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory* (LADAL) tutorial *Analyzing learner language using R*](https://ladal.edu.au/llr.html). The tutorial provides more details and background information while this interactive notebook focuses strictly on practical aspects.

***


**Preparation and session set up**

We set up our session by activating the packages we need for this tutorial.


```{r prep2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source='klippy'}
# activate packages
library(quanteda)
library(dplyr)
library(koRpus)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(hunspell)
library(udpipe)
library(wordcloud2)
library(tokenizers)
```

Once you have initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

If you are using this notebook on your own computer and you have not already installed the R packages listed above, you need to install them. You can install them by replacing the `library` command with `install.packages` and putting the name of the package into quotation marks like this: `install.packages("quanteda")`. Then, you simply run this command and R will install the package you specified.

## Using your own data

While the tutorial uses data from the LADAL website, you can also use your own data. You can see below what you need to do to upload and use your own data.

The code chunk below allows you to upload two files from your own computer. To be able to load your own data, you need to click on the folder symbol to the left of the screen:

![Binder Folder Symbol](https://slcladal.github.io/images/binderfolder.JPG)


Then, when the menu has unfolded, click on the smaller folder symbol (encircled in red in the picture below).

![Small Binder Folder Symbol](https://slcladal.github.io/images/upload2.png)

Now, you are in the main menu and can click on the 'MyData' folder.

![MyData Folder Symbol](https://slcladal.github.io/images/upload3.png)

Now, that you are in the MyData folder, you can click on the upload symbol.

![Binder Upload Symbol](https://slcladal.github.io/images/binderupload.JPG)

Select and upload the files you want to analyze (**IMPORTANT: here, we assume that you upload some form of text data - not tabular data! You can upload only txt and docx files!**). When you then execute the code chunk below, you will upload your own data and you can then use it in this notebook.

```{r}
myfiles <- list.files(here::here("MyData"), # path to the corpus data
                          # full paths - not just the names of the files
                          full.names = T) 
# load colt files
mytext <- sapply(myfiles, function(x){
  x <- scan(x, 
            what = "char", 
            sep = "", 
            quote = "", 
            quiet = T, 
            skipNul = T)
  x <- paste0(x, sep = " ", collapse = " ")
  x <- stringr::str_squish(x)
})
# inspect
str(mytext)
```


**Keep in mind though that you need to adapt the names of the texts in the code chunks below so that the code below work on your own texts!**

***



```{r prep2, message=FALSE} 
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tm)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyr)
library(NLP)
library(openNLP)
library(quanteda)
library(quanteda.textstats)
library(quanteda.textplots)
library(koRpus)
library(koRpus.lang.en)
library(stringi)
library(hunspell)
library(wordcloud2)
library(pacman)
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/entity")
```

Once you have installed R and RStudio and once you have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

**Loading data**

We use 7 essays written by learners from the [*International Corpus of Learner English* (ICLE)](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/icle.html) and two files containing a-level essays written by L1-English British students from [*The Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays* (LOCNESS)](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/locness.html) which was compiled by the *Centre for English Corpus Linguistics* (CECL), Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium. The code chunk below loads the data from the LADAL repository on GitHub into R.

```{r load, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load essays from l1 speakers
ns1 <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/ns1.rda", "rb"))
ns2 <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/ns2.rda", "rb"))
# load essays from l2 speakers
es <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/es.rda", "rb"))
de <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/de.rda", "rb"))
fr <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/fr.rda", "rb"))
it <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/it.rda", "rb"))
pl <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/pl.rda", "rb"))
ru <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/LCorpus/ru.rda", "rb"))
# inspect
ru %>%
  # remove header
  stringr::str_remove(., "<[A-Z]{4,4}.*") %>%
  # remove empty elements
  dplyr::na_if("") %>%
  na.omit %>%
  #show first 3 elements
  head(3)
```

The data inspection shows the first 3 text elements from the essay written a Russian learner of English to provide an idea of what the data look like. 

Now that we have loaded some data, we can go ahead and extract information from the texts and process the data to analyze differences between L1 speakers and learners of English.

# Concordancing

Concordancing refers to the extraction of words or phrases from a given text or texts [@lindquist2009corpus]. Commonly, concordances are displayed in the form of key-word in contexts (KWIC) where the search term is shown with some preceding and following context. Thus, such displays are referred to as key word in context concordances. A more elaborate tutorial on how to perform concordancing with R is available [here](https://slcladal.github.io/kwics.html).


Concordancing is helpful for seeing how a given term or phrased is used in the data, for inspecting how often a given word occurs in a text or a collection of texts, for extracting examples, and it also represents a basic procedure, and often the first step, in more sophisticated analyses. 

We begin by creating KWIC displays of the term *problem* as shown below. To extract the kwic concordances, we use the `kwic` function from the `quanteda` package [cf. @benoit2018quanteda]. 

```{r conc1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# combine data from learners
learner <- c(de, es, fr, it, pl, ru)
# extract kwic for term "problem" in learner data
kwic <- quanteda::kwic(learner,               # the data in which to search
                       pattern = "problem.*", # the pattern to look for
                       valuetype = "regex",   # look for exact matches or patterns
                       window = 10) %>%       # how much context to display (in elements) 
  # convert to table (called data.frame in R)
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # remove superfluous columns
  dplyr::select(-to, -from, -pattern)
# inspect
head(kwic)
```

The output shows that the term *problem* occurs six times in the learner data.

We can also arrange the output according to what comes before or after the search term as shown below.


```{r conc2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# take kwic
kwic %>%
  # arrange kwic alphabetically by what comes after the key term
  dplyr::arrange(post)
```


```{r conc3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# take quick
kwic %>%
  # reverse the preceding context
  dplyr::mutate(prerev = stringi::stri_reverse(pre)) %>%
  # arrange kwic alphabetically by reversed preceding context
  dplyr::arrange(prerev) %>%
  # remove column with reversed preceding context
  dplyr::select(-prerev)
```

We can also combine concordancing with visualizations. For instance, use the `textplot_xray` function from the `quanteda.textplots` package to visualize where in some texts the term *people* and the term *imagination*  occurs.

```{r conc4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create kwics for people and imagination
kwic_people <- quanteda::kwic(learner, pattern = c("people", "imagination"))
# generate x-ray plot
quanteda.textplots::textplot_xray(kwic_people)
```

We can also search for phrases rather than individual words. To do this, we need to use the `phrase` function in the `pattern` argument as shown below. In the code chunk below, we look for any combination of the word *very* and any following word. It we would wish, we could of course also  sort (or order) the concordances as we have done above.


```{r conc5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# generate kwic for phrases staring with very
kwic <- quanteda::kwic(learner,                              # data
                       pattern = phrase("^very [a-z]{1,}"),  # search pattern
                       valuetype = "regex") %>%              # type of pattern
  # convert into a data frame
  as.data.frame()
# inspect data
head(kwic)
```

# Frequency lists

A useful procedure when dealing with texts is to extract frequency information. To exemplify how to extract frequency lists from texts, we will do this here using the L1 data.


```{r fr1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ftb <- c(ns1, ns2) %>%
  # remove punctuation
  stringr::str_replace_all(., "\\W", " ") %>%
  # remove superfluous white spaces
  stringr::str_squish() %>%
  # convert to lower case
  tolower() %>%
  # split into words
  stringr::str_split(" ") %>%
  # unlist
  unlist() %>%
  # convert into table
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # rename column
  dplyr::rename(word = 1) %>%
  # remove empty rows
  dplyr::filter(word != "") %>%
  # count words
  dplyr::group_by(word) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(freq = n()) %>%
  # order by freq
  dplyr::arrange(-freq)
# inspect
head(ftb)
```

We can easily remove stop words (words without lexical content) using the `anti_join` function as shown below.

```{r fr4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ftb_wosw <- ftb %>%
  # remove stop words
  dplyr::anti_join(stop_words)
# inspect
head(ftb_wosw)
```

We can then visualize the results as a bar chart as shown below.

```{r fr5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ftb_wosw %>%
  # take 20 most frequent terms
  head(20) %>%
  # generate a plot
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, -freq), y = freq, label = freq)) +
  # define type of plot
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  # add labels
  geom_text(vjust=1.6, color = "white") +
  # display in black-and-white theme
  theme_bw() +
  # adapt x-axis tick labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=8, angle=90)) +
  # adapt axes labels
  labs(y = "Frequnecy", x = "Word")
```

Or we can visualize the data as a word cloud (see below).


```{r}
# create wordcloud
wordcloud2(ftb_wosw[1:100,],    # define data to use
           # define shape
           shape = "diamond",
           # define colors
           color = scales::viridis_pal()(8))
```



# Splitting texts into sentences

It can be every useful to split texts into individual sentences. This can be done, e.g., to extract the average sentence length or simply to inspect or annotate individual sentences. To split a text into sentences, we clean the data by removing file identifiers and html tags as well as quotation marks within sentences. As we are dealing with several texts, we write a function that performs this task and that we can then apply to the individual texts.

```{r split1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cleanText <- function(x,...){
  require(tokenizers)
  # paste text together
  x <- paste0(x)
  # remove file identifiers
  x <- stringr::str_remove_all(x, "<.*?>")
  # remove quotation marks
  x <- stringr::str_remove_all(x, fixed("\""))
  # remove empty elements
  x <- x[!x==""]
  # split text into sentences
  x <- tokenize_sentences(x)
  x <- unlist(x)
}
# clean texts
ns1_sen <- cleanText(ns1)
ns2_sen <- cleanText(ns2)
de_sen <- cleanText(de)
es_sen <- cleanText(es)
fr_sen <- cleanText(fr)
it_sen <- cleanText(it)
pl_sen <- cleanText(pl)
ru_sen <- cleanText(ru)
# inspect data
head(ru_sen)
```


Now that we have split the texts into individual sentences, we can easily extract and visualize the average sentence lengths of L1 speakers and learners of English.

# Sentence length

The most basic complexity measure is average sentence length. In the following, we will extract the average sentence length for L1-speakers and learners of English with different language backgrounds.

We can use the `count_words` function from the `tokenizers` package to count the words in each sentence. We apply the function to all texts and generate a table (a data frame) of the results and add the L1 of the speaker who produced the sentence.

```{r senl5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract sentences lengths
ns1_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(ns1_sen)
ns2_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(ns2_sen)
de_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(de_sen)
es_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(es_sen)
fr_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(fr_sen)
it_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(it_sen)
pl_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(pl_sen)
ru_sl <- tokenizers::count_words(ru_sen)
# create a data frame from the results
sl_df <- data.frame(c(ns1_sl, ns2_sl, de_sl, es_sl, fr_sl, it_sl, pl_sl, ru_sl)) %>%
  dplyr::rename(sentenceLength = 1) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(l1 = c(rep("en", length(ns1_sl)),
                       rep("en", length(ns2_sl)),
                       rep("de", length(de_sl)),
                       rep("es", length(es_sl)),
                       rep("fr", length(fr_sl)),
                       rep("it", length(it_sl)),
                       rep("pl", length(pl_sl)),
                       rep("ru", length(ru_sl))))
# inspect data
head(sl_df)
```

Now, we can use the resulting table to create a box plot showing the results.

```{r senl8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sl_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(l1, -sentenceLength, mean), y = sentenceLength, fill = l1)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # adapt y-axis labels
  labs(y = "Sentence lenghts") +
  # adapt tick labels
  scale_x_discrete("L1 of learners", 
                   breaks = names(table(sl_df$l1)), 
                   labels = c("en" = "English",
                              "de" = "German",
                              "es" = "Spanish",
                              "fr" = "French",
                              "it" = "Italian",
                              "pl" = "Polish",
                              "ru" = "Russian")) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# Extracting N-grams

In a next step, we extract n-grams using the `tokens_ngrams` function from the `quanteda` package. In a first step, we take the sentence data, convert it to lower case and remove punctuation. Then we apply the `tokens_ngrams` function to extract the n-grams (in this case 2-grams).


```{r ng1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ns1_tok <- ns1_sen %>%
  tolower() %>%
  quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
# extract n-grams
ns1_2gram <- quanteda::tokens_ngrams(ns1_tok, n = 2)
# inspect
head(ns1_2gram[[2]], 10)
```

We can also extract tri-grams easily by changing the `n` argument in the `tokens_ngrams` function.

```{r ng2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract n-grams
ns1_3gram <- quanteda::tokens_ngrams(ns1_tok, n = 3)
# inspect
head(ns1_3gram[[2]])
```


We now apply the same procedure to all texts as shown below.

```{r ng3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ns1_tok <- ns1_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
ns2_tok <- ns2_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
de_tok <- de_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
es_tok <- es_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
fr_tok <- fr_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
it_tok <- it_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
pl_tok <- pl_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
ru_tok <- ru_sen %>% tolower() %>% quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)
# extract n-grams
ns1_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(ns1_tok, n = 2)))
ns2_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(ns2_tok, n = 2)))
de_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(de_tok, n = 2)))
es_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(es_tok, n = 2)))
fr_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(fr_tok, n = 2)))
it_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(it_tok, n = 2)))
pl_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(pl_tok, n = 2)))
ru_2gram <- as.vector(unlist(quanteda::tokens_ngrams(ru_tok, n = 2)))
```


Next, we generate a table with the ngrams and the L1 background of the speaker that produced the bi-grams.

```{r ng4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ngram_df <- c(ns1_2gram, ns2_2gram, de_2gram, es_2gram, 
              fr_2gram, it_2gram, pl_2gram, ru_2gram) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::rename(ngram = 1) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(l1 = c(rep("en", length(ns1_2gram)),
                       rep("en", length(ns2_2gram)),
                       rep("de", length(de_2gram)),
                       rep("es", length(es_2gram)),
                       rep("fr", length(fr_2gram)),
                       rep("it", length(it_2gram)),
                       rep("pl", length(pl_2gram)),
                       rep("ru", length(ru_2gram))),
                learner = ifelse(l1 == "en", "no", "yes"))
# inspect
head(ngram_df)
```

Now, we process the table further to add frequency information, i.e., how often a given n-gram occurs in each the language of speakers with distinct L1 backgrounds.

```{r ng5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ngram_fdf <- ngram_df %>%
  dplyr::group_by(ngram, learner) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(freq = n()) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-freq)
# inspect
head(ngram_fdf)
```

As the word counts of the texts are quite different, we normalize the frequencies to per-1,000-word frequencies which are comparable across texts of different lengths.

```{r ng7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ngram_nfdf <- ngram_fdf %>%
  dplyr::group_by(ngram) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_ngram = sum(freq)) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-total_ngram) %>%
  # total by learner
  dplyr::group_by(learner) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_learner = sum(freq),
                rfreq = freq/total_learner*1000)
# inspect
head(ngram_nfdf, 10)
```

We now reformat the table so that we have relative frequencies for both learners and L1 speakers even if a particular n-gram does not occur in the text produced by either a learner or a L1 speaker.


```{r ng8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ngram_rel <- ngram_nfdf %>%
  dplyr::select(ngram, learner, rfreq, total_ngram) %>%
  tidyr::spread(learner, rfreq) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(no = ifelse(is.na(no), 0, no),
                yes = ifelse(is.na(yes), 0, yes)) %>%
  tidyr::gather(learner, rfreq, no:yes) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-total_ngram)
# inspect
head(ngram_rel)
```

Finally, we visualize the most frequent n-grams in the data in a bar chart.

```{r ng10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ngram_rel %>%
  head(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = rfreq, x = reorder(ngram, -total_ngram), group = learner, fill = learner)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=8, angle=90),
        legend.position = "top") +
  labs(y = "Relative frequnecy\n(per 1,000 words)", x = "n-gram")
```


We can, of course also investigate only specific n-grams, e.g., n-grams containing a specific word such as *public* (below, we only show the first 6 n-grams containing *public* by using the `head` function).

```{r ng12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ngram_rel %>%
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(ngram, "public")) %>%
  head()
```

We can also specify the order by adding the underscore as shown below.

```{r ng15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ngram_rel %>%
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(ngram, "public_")) %>%
  head()
```

# Differences in ngram use

Next, we will set out to identify differences in n-gram frequencies between learners and L1 speakers. In a first step, we transform the table so that we have separate columns for learners and L1-speakers. In addition, we also add columns containing all the information we need to perform Fisher's exact test to check if learners use certain n-grams significantly  more or less frequently compared to L1-speakers. 

```{r ang1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sdif_ngram <- ngram_fdf %>%
  tidyr::spread(learner, freq) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(no = ifelse(is.na(no), 0, no),
                yes = ifelse(is.na(yes), 0, yes)) %>%
  dplyr::rename(l1speaker = no, 
                learner = yes) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_ngram = l1speaker+learner) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_learner = sum(learner),
              total_l1 = sum(l1speaker)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(a = l1speaker,
                b = learner) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(c = total_l1-a,
                d = total_learner-b)
# inspect
head(sdif_ngram)
```

On this re-arranged data set, we can now apply the Fisher's exact tests. As we are performing many different tests, we need to correct for multiple comparisons. To this end, we create a column which holds the Bonferroni corrected critical value (\alpha .05). If a p-value is lower than the corrected critical value, then the learners and L1-speakers differ significantly in their use of that n-gram.

```{r ang3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sdif_ngram <- sdif_ngram  %>%
  # perform fishers exact test and extract estimate and p
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(fisher_p = fisher.test(matrix(c(a,c,b,d), nrow= 2))$p.value,
                oddsratio = fisher.test(matrix(c(a,c,b,d), nrow= 2))$estimate,
                # calculate bonferroni correction
                crit = .05/nrow(.),
                sig_corr = ifelse(fisher_p < crit, "p<.05", "n.s.")) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(fisher_p) %>%
  dplyr::select(-total_ngram, -total_learner, -total_l1, -a, -b, -c, -d, -crit)
# inspect
head(sdif_ngram)
```

In our case, there are no n-grams that differ significantly in their use by learners and L1-speakers once we have corrected for repeated testing as indicated by the *n.s.* (not significant) in the column called *sig_corr*.


# Finding collocations

There are various techniques for identifying collocations. To identify collocations without having a pre-defined target term, we can use the `textstat_collocations` function from the `quanteda.textstats` package [cf. @benoit2021package].

However, before we can apply that function and start identifying collocations, we need to process the data to which we want to apply this function. In the present case, we will apply that function to the sentences in the L1 data which we extract in the code chunk below.

```{r coll5}
ns_sen <- c(ns1_sen, ns2_sen) %>%
  tolower()
# inspect data
head(ns_sen)
```


From the output shown above, we also see that splitting texts did not work perfectly as it produces some unwarranted artifacts like the "sentences" that consist of headings (e.g., *transport 01*). Fortunately, these errors do not really matter in the case of our example.

Now that we have the L1 data split into sentences, we can tokenize these sentences and apply the `textstat_collocations` function which identifies collocations.

```{r coll7, warning=F, message=F}
# create a token object
ns_tokens <- quanteda::tokens(ns_sen, remove_punct = TRUE)# %>%
#  tokens_remove(stopwords("english"))
# extract collocations
ns_coll <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_collocations(ns_tokens, size = 2, min_count = 20)
# inspect data
head(ns_coll)
```



The resulting table shows collocations in L1 data descending by collocation strength.

## Visualizing collocation networks

Network graphs are a very useful and flexible tool for visualizing relationships between elements such as words, personas, or authors. This section shows how to generate a network graph for collocations of the term *transport* using the `quanteda` package.

In a first step, we generate a document-feature matrix based on the sentences in the L1 data. A document-feature matrix shows how often elements (here these elements are the words that occur in the L1 data) occur in a selection of documents (here these documents are the sentences in the L1 data).


```{r dfm1, message=F, warning=F}
# create document-feature matrix
ns_dfm <- ns_sen %>% 
  quanteda::dfm(remove = stopwords('english'), remove_punct = TRUE)
# inspect data
ns_dfm[1:6, 1:6]
```


As we want to generate a network graph of words that collocate with the term *organism*, we use the `calculateCoocStatistics` function to determine which words most strongly collocate with our target term (*organism*).  

```{r dfm3, message=F, warning=F}
# load function for co-occurrence calculation
source("https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/calculateCoocStatistics.R")
# define term
coocTerm <- "transport"
# calculate co-occurrence statistics
coocs <- calculateCoocStatistics(coocTerm, ns_dfm, measure="LOGLIK")
# inspect results
coocs[1:10]
```



We now reduce the document-feature matrix to contain only the top 20 collocates of *transport* (plus our target word *transport*).


```{r dfm4}
redux_dfm <- dfm_select(ns_dfm, 
                        pattern = c(names(coocs)[1:10], "transport"))
# inspect data
redux_dfm[1:6, 1:6]
```




Now, we can transform the document-feature matrix into a feature-co-occurrence matrix as shown below. A feature-co-occurrence matrix shows how often each element in that matrix co-occurs with every other element in that matrix.

```{r dfm6}
tag_fcm <- fcm(redux_dfm)
# inspect data
tag_fcm[1:6, 1:6]
```



Using the feature-co-occurrence matrix, we can generate the network graph which shows the terms that collocate with the target term *transport* with the edges representing the co-occurrence frequency. To generate this network graph, we use the `textplot_network` function from the `quanteda.textplots` package.

```{r dfm8, message=F, warning=F}
# generate network graph
quanteda.textplots::textplot_network(tag_fcm, 
                                     min_freq = 1, 
                                     edge_alpha = 0.3, 
                                     edge_size = 5,
                                     edge_color = "gray80",
                                     vertex_labelsize = log(rowSums(tag_fcm)*15))
```


# Part-of-speech tagging

Part-of-speech tagging is a very useful procedure for many analyses. Here, we automatically identify parts of speech (word classes) in the text which, for a well-studied language like English, is approximately 95% accurate.

Here, we use the `udpipe` package to pos-tag text. We test this by pos-tagging a simple sentence to see if the function does what we want it to and to check the output format.

```{r pos2, message=F, warning=F}
# generate test text
text <- "It is now a very wide spread opinion, that in the modern world there is no place for dreaming and imagination."
# download language model (for english) 
m_eng   <- udpipe::udpipe_download_model(language = "english-ewt")
m_eng <- udpipe_load_model(file = here::here("english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe"))
# pos-tag  text
tagged_text <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(m_eng, x = text) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::select(-sentence) 
# collapse into text
tagged_text <- paste0(tagged_text$token, "/", tagged_text$xpos, collapse = " ")
# inspect tagged text
tagged_text
```

The tags are not always transparent, and this is very much the case for the word class we will be looking at - the tag for an adjective is `/JJ`!

The next step, we write a function that will clean our texts by removing tags and quotation marks as well as superfluous white spaces. In addition, we also pos-tag the texts.

```{r pos4, message=F, warning=F}
comText <- function(x,...){
  # paste text together
  x <- paste0(x)
  # remove file identifiers
  x <- stringr::str_remove_all(x, "<.*?>")
  # remove quotation marks
  x <- stringr::str_remove_all(x, fixed("\""))
  # remove superfluous white spaces
  x <- stringr::str_squish(x)
  # remove empty elements
  x <- x[!x==""]
  # postag text
  x <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(m_eng, x) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::select(-sentence) 
  x <- paste0(x$token, "/", x$xpos, collapse = " ")
}
```


Now we apply the text cleaning function to the texts.

```{r pos5, message=F, warning=F}
# combine texts
ns1_pos <- comText(ns1_sen)
ns2_pos <- comText(ns2_sen)
de_pos <- comText(de_sen)
es_pos <- comText(es_sen)
fr_pos <- comText(fr_sen)
it_pos <- comText(it_sen)
pl_pos <- comText(pl_sen)
ru_pos <- comText(ru_sen)
# inspect
ns1_pos
```



We end up with pos-tagged texts where the pos-tags are added to each word (or symbol).

In the following section, we will use these pos-tags to identify potential differences between learners and L1-speakers of English.

# Differences in pos-sequences

To analyze differences in part-of-speech sequences between L1-speakers and learners of English,, we write a function that extracts pos-tag bigrams from the tagged texts. 

```{r pa1, message=F, warning=F}
# tokenize and extract pos tags
posngram <- function(x,...){
  x <- x %>%
  stringr::str_remove_all("\\w*/") %>%
  quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE)  %>%
    quanteda::tokens_ngrams(n = 2) %>%
    stringr::str_remove_all("-")
  return(x)
}
```


We now apply the function to the pos-tagged texts.

```{r pa3, message=F, warning=F}
# apply pos-tag function to data
ns1_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(ns1_pos)))
ns2_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(ns2_pos)))
de_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(de_pos)))
es_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(es_pos)))
fr_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(fr_pos)))
it_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(it_pos)))
pl_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(pl_pos)))
ru_posng <- as.vector(unlist(posngram(ru_pos)))
# inspect
head(ns1_posng)
```

In a next step, we tabulate the results and add a column telling us about the L1 background of the speakers who have produced the texts.

```{r pa5, message=F, warning=F}
posngram_df <- c(ns1_posng, ns2_posng, de_posng, es_posng, fr_posng, 
                 it_posng, pl_posng, ru_posng) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # rename column
  dplyr::rename(ngram = 1) %>%
  # add l1
  dplyr::mutate(l1 = c(rep("en", length(ns1_posng)),
                       rep("en", length(ns2_posng)),
                       rep("de", length(de_posng)),
                       rep("es", length(es_posng)),
                       rep("fr", length(fr_posng)),
                       rep("it", length(it_posng)),
                       rep("pl", length(pl_posng)),
                       rep("ru", length(ru_posng))),
                # add learner column
                learner = ifelse(l1 == "en", "no", "yes")) %>%
  # extract frequencies of ngrams
  dplyr::group_by(ngram, learner) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(freq = n()) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-freq)
# inspect
head(posngram_df)
```

Next, we transform the table and add all the information that we need to perform the Fisher's exact tests that we will use to determine if there are significant differences between L1 speakers and learners of English regarding their use of pos-sequences.

```{r pa6, message=F, warning=F}
posngram_df2 <- posngram_df %>%
  tidyr::spread(learner, freq) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(no = ifelse(is.na(no), 0, no),
                yes = ifelse(is.na(yes), 0, yes)) %>%
  dplyr::rename(l1speaker = no, 
                learner = yes) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_ngram = l1speaker+learner) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total_learner = sum(learner),
              total_l1 = sum(l1speaker)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(a = l1speaker,
                b = learner) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(c = total_l1-a,
                d = total_learner-b)
# inspect
head(posngram_df2)
```

On this re-arranged data set, we can now apply the Fisher's exact tests. As we are performing many different tests, we need to correct for multiple comparisons. To this end, we create a column which holds the Bonferroni corrected critical value (\alpha .05). If a p-value is lower than the corrected critical value, then the learners and L1-speakers differ significantly in their use of that n-gram.

```{r pa8, message=F, warning=F}
sdif_posngram <- posngram_df2  %>%
  # perform fishers exact test and extract estimate and p
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(fisher_p = fisher.test(matrix(c(a,c,b,d), nrow= 2))$p.value,
                oddsratio = fisher.test(matrix(c(a,c,b,d), nrow= 2))$estimate,
                # calculate bonferroni correction
                crit = .05/nrow(.),
                sig_corr = ifelse(fisher_p < crit, "p<.05", "n.s.")) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(fisher_p) %>%
  dplyr::select(-total_ngram, -a, -b, -c, -d, -crit)
# inspect
head(sdif_posngram)
```


We can now check and compare the use of the the pos-tagged sequences that differ significantly between learners and L1 speakers of English using simple concordancing. We begin by checking the use in the L1-data.

```{r pa9, message=F, warning=F}
# combine l1 data
l1_pos <- c(ns1_pos, ns2_pos)
# combine l2 data
l2_pos <- c(de_pos, es_pos, fr_pos, it_pos, pl_pos, ru_pos)
# extract PRP_VBZ
PRP_VBZ_l1 <-quanteda::kwic(quanteda::tokens(l1_pos), 
                            pattern = phrase("\\w* / PRP \\w* / VBZ"), 
                            valuetype = "regex",
                            window = 10) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # remove superfluous columns
  dplyr::select(-from, -to, -docname, -pattern)
# inspect results
head(PRP_VBZ_l1)
```

We now turn to the learner data and also extract concordances for the same pos-sequence.

```{r pa10, message=F, warning=F}
# extract PRP_VBZ
PRP_VBZ_l2 <-quanteda::kwic(quanteda::tokens(l2_pos), 
                            pattern = phrase("\\w* / PRP \\w* / VBZ"), 
                            valuetype = "regex", 
                            window = 10) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # remove superfluous columns
  dplyr::select(-from, -to, -docname, -pattern)
# inspect results
head(PRP_VBZ_l2)
```


# Lexical diversity

Another common measure used to asses the development of language learns is vocabulary size. Vocabulary size can be assessed with various measures that represent lexical diversity. In the present case, we will extract

* `TTR`: *type-token ratio*
* `C`: Herdan's C (see @tweedie1988lexdiv; sometimes referred to as LogTTR)
* `R`: Guiraud's Root TTR (see @tweedie1988lexdiv)
* `CTTR`: Carroll's Corrected TTR 
* `U`: Dugast's Uber Index (see @tweedie1988lexdiv)
* `S`: Summer's index
* `Maas`: Maas' indices

The formulas showing how the lexical diversity measures are calculated as well as additional information about the lexical diversity measures can be found [here](https://quanteda.io/reference/textstat_lexdiv.html).

While we will extract all of these scores, we will only visualize Carroll's Corrected TTR to keep things simple. 

\begin{equation}
  CTTR =  \frac{N_{Types}}{\sqrt{2 N_{Tokens}}}
\end{equation}

However, before we extract the lexical diversity measures, we split the data into individual essays.

```{r ld1, message=F, warning=F}
cleanEss <- function(x){
  x %>%
  paste0(collapse = " ") %>%
  stringr::str_split("Transport [0-9]{1,2}") %>%
  unlist() %>%
  stringr::str_squish() %>%
  .[. != ""]
}
# apply function
ns1_ess <- cleanEss(ns1)
ns2_ess <- cleanEss(ns2)
de_ess <- cleanEss(de)
es_ess <- cleanEss(es)
fr_ess <- cleanEss(fr)
it_ess <- cleanEss(it)
pl_ess <- cleanEss(pl)
ru_ess <- cleanEss(ru)
# inspect
head(ns1_ess, 1)
```

In a next step, we can apply the `lex.div` function from the `koRpus` package which calculates the different lexical diversity measures for us.

```{r ld2, message=F, warning=F}
# extract lex. div. measures
ns1_lds <- lapply(ns1_ess, function(x){
  x <- koRpus::lex.div(x, force.lang = 'en', # define language 
                       segment = 20,      # define segment width
                       window = 20,       # define window width
                       quiet = T,
                       # define lex div measures
                       measure=c("TTR", "C", "R", "CTTR", "U", "Maas"),
                       char=c("TTR", "C", "R", "CTTR","U", "Maas"))
})
# inspect
ns1_lds[1]
```

We now go ahead and extract the lexical diversity scores for the other essays.

```{r ld4, message=F, warning=F}
lexDiv <- function(x){
  lapply(x, function(y){
    koRpus::lex.div(y, force.lang = 'en',  segment = 20, window = 20,  
                    quiet = T, measure=c("TTR", "C", "R", "CTTR", "U", "Maas"),
                    char=c("TTR", "C", "R", "CTTR","U", "Maas"))
  })
}

# extract lex. div. measures
ns2_lds <- lexDiv(ns2_ess)
de_lds <- lexDiv(de_ess)
es_lds <- lexDiv(es_ess)
fr_lds <- lexDiv(fr_ess)
it_lds <- lexDiv(it_ess)
pl_lds <- lexDiv(pl_ess)
ru_lds <- lexDiv(ru_ess)
```

In a next step, we extract the CTTR values from L1-speakers and learners and put the results into a table.

```{r ld5, message=F, warning=F}
cttr <- data.frame(c(as.vector(sapply(ns1_lds, '[', "CTTR")), 
                     as.vector(sapply(ns2_lds, '[', "CTTR")), 
                     as.vector(sapply(de_lds, '[', "CTTR")), 
                     as.vector(sapply(es_lds, '[', "CTTR")),
                     as.vector(sapply(fr_lds, '[', "CTTR")), 
                     as.vector(sapply(it_lds, '[', "CTTR")), 
                     as.vector(sapply(pl_lds, '[', "CTTR")), 
                     as.vector(sapply(ru_lds, '[', "CTTR"))),
          c(rep("en", length(as.vector(sapply(ns1_lds, '[', "CTTR")))),
            rep("en", length(as.vector(sapply(ns2_lds, '[', "CTTR")))),
            rep("de", length(as.vector(sapply(de_lds, '[', "CTTR")))),
            rep("es", length(as.vector(sapply(es_lds, '[', "CTTR")))),
            rep("fr", length(as.vector(sapply(fr_lds, '[', "CTTR")))),
            rep("it", length(as.vector(sapply(it_lds, '[', "CTTR")))),
            rep("pl", length(as.vector(sapply(pl_lds, '[', "CTTR")))),
            rep("ru", length(as.vector(sapply(ru_lds, '[', "CTTR")))))) %>%
  dplyr::rename(CTTR = 1,
                l1 = 2)
# inspect
head(cttr)
```

We can now visualize the information in the table in the form of a dot plot to inspect potential differences with respect to the L1-background of speakers.


```{r ld7, message=F, warning=F}
cttr %>%
  dplyr::group_by(l1) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(CTTR = mean(CTTR)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(l1, CTTR, mean), y = CTTR)) +
  geom_point() +
  # adapt y-axis labels
  labs(y = "Lexical diversity (CTTR)") +
  # adapt tick labels
  scale_x_discrete("L1 of learners", 
                   breaks = names(table(cttr$l1)), 
                   labels = c("en" = "English",
                              "de" = "German",
                              "es" = "Spanish",
                              "fr" = "French",
                              "it" = "Italian",
                              "pl" = "Polish",
                              "ru" = "Russian")) +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 15)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# Readability

Another measure to assess text quality or text complexity is *readability*. As with lexical diversity scores, the `textstat_readability` function from the `quanteda.textstats` package provides a multitude of different measures (see [here](https://quanteda.io/reference/textstat_readability.html) for the entire list of readability scores that can be extracted). In the following, we will focus on Flesch's Reading Ease Score exclusively [cf. @flesch1948new] (see below; ALS = average sentence length).

\begin{equation}
  Flesch =  206.835−(1.015 ASL)−(84.6 \frac{N_{Syllables}}{N_{Words}})
\end{equation}

In a first step, we extract the Flesch scores by applying the `textstat_readability` to the essays.


```{r rd1, message=F, warning=F}
ns1_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(ns1_ess)
ns2_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(ns2_ess)
de_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(de_ess)
es_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(es_ess)
fr_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(fr_ess)
it_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(it_ess)
pl_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(pl_ess)
ru_read <- quanteda.textstats::textstat_readability(ru_ess)
# inspect
ns1_read
```

Now, we generate a table with the results and the L1 of the speaker that produced the essay.
 
```{r rd3, message=F, warning=F}
l1 <- c(rep("en", nrow(ns1_read)), rep("en", nrow(ns2_read)),
        "de", "es", "fr", "it", "pl", "ru")
read_l1 <- base::rbind(ns1_read, ns2_read, de_read, es_read, 
                    fr_read, it_read, pl_read, ru_read)
read_l1 <- cbind(read_l1, l1) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(l1 = factor(l1, level = c("en", "de", "es", "fr", "it", "pl", "ru"))) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(l1) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Flesch = mean(Flesch))
# inspect
read_l1
```

As before, we can visualize the results to check for potential differences between L1-speakers and learners of English. In this case, we use bar charts to visualize the results.

```{r rd4, message=F, warning=F}
read_l1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = l1, y = Flesch, label = round(Flesch, 1))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(vjust=1.6, color = "white")+
  # adapt tick labels
  scale_x_discrete("L1 of learners", 
                   breaks = names(table(read_l1$l1)), 
                   labels = c("en" = "English",
                              "de" = "German",
                              "es" = "Spanish",
                              "fr" = "French",
                              "it" = "Italian",
                              "pl" = "Polish",
                              "ru" = "Russian")) +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 75)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
 
# Spelling errors

We can also determine the number of spelling errors in L1 and learner texts by checking if words in a given text occur in a dictionary or not. To do this, we can use the `hunspell` function from the `hunspell` package. We can choose between different dictionaries (use `list_dictionaries()` to see which dictionaries are available) and we can specify words to ignore via the `ignore` argument.

```{r sp1, message=F, warning=F}
# list words that are not in dict
hunspell(ns1_ess, 
         format = c("text"),
         dict = dictionary("en_GB"),
         ignore = en_stats) 
```

We can check how many spelling mistakes and words are in a text as shown below.

```{r sp3, message=F, warning=F}
ns1_nerr <- hunspell(ns1_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  length()
ns1_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(ns1_ess))
# inspect
ns1_nerr; ns1_nw
```


To check if L1 speakers and learners differ regrading the likelihood of making spelling errors, we apply the `hunspell` function to all texts and also extract the number of words for each text.

```{r sp4, message=F, warning=F}
# ns1
ns1_nerr <- hunspell(ns1_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
ns1_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(ns1_ess))
# ns2
ns2_nerr <- hunspell(ns2_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
ns2_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(ns2_ess))
# de
de_nerr <- hunspell(de_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
de_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(de_ess))
# es
es_nerr <- hunspell(es_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
es_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(es_ess))
# fr
fr_nerr <- hunspell(fr_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
fr_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(fr_ess))
# it
it_nerr <- hunspell(it_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
it_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(it_ess))
# pl
pl_nerr <- hunspell(pl_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
pl_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(pl_ess))
# ru
ru_nerr <- hunspell(ru_ess, dict = dictionary("en_GB")) %>%  unlist() %>% length()
ru_nw <- sum(tokenizers::count_words(ru_ess))
```

Now, we generate a table from the results.

```{r sp6, message=F, warning=F}
err_tb <- c(ns1_nerr, ns2_nerr, de_nerr, es_nerr, fr_nerr, it_nerr, pl_nerr, ru_nerr) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # rename column
  dplyr::rename(errors = 1) %>%
  # add n of words
  dplyr::mutate(words = c(ns1_nw, ns2_nw, de_nw, es_nw, fr_nw, it_nw, pl_nw, ru_nw)) %>%
  # add l1
  dplyr::mutate(l1 = c("en", "en", "de", "es", "fr", "it", "pl", "ru")) %>%
  # calculate rel freq
  dplyr::mutate(freq = round(errors/words*1000, 1)) %>%
  # summarise
  dplyr::group_by(l1) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(freq = mean(freq))
# inspect
head(err_tb)
```

We can now visualize the results.

```{r sp7, message=F, warning=F}
err_tb %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(l1, -freq), y = freq, label = freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(vjust=1.6, color = "white") +
  # adapt tick labels
  scale_x_discrete("L1 of learners", 
                   breaks = names(table(read_l1$l1)), 
                   labels = c("en" = "English",
                              "de" = "German",
                              "es" = "Spanish",
                              "fr" = "French",
                              "it" = "Italian",
                              "pl" = "Polish",
                              "ru" = "Russian")) +
  labs(y = "Relative frequency\n(per 1,000 words)") +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 40)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
