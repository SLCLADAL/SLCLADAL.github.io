# Introduction{-}

This tutorial shows how to generate interactive data visualizations in R. The entire R markdown document for this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/motion.Rmd). Interactive visualization refers to a type of graphic visualization that allows the viewer to interact with the data or the information that is visualized. As such, interactive visualizations are more engaging or appealing compared with non-interactive visualization. However, interactive visualizations cannot be implemented in reports that are printed on paper but are restricted to digital formats (e.g. websites, presentations, etc.).

There are various options to generate interactive data visualizations in R. The most popular option is to create a `shiny` app [@beeley2013web]. This tutorial will not use `shiny` because `shiny` requires that the computation on which the computation that underlies the visualization is performed on a server. Rather, we will use `GooleViz` [@gesmann2011using] for generating interactive visualizations that use the computer  (or the browser) of the viewer to perform the computation. Thus, the interactive visualizations shown here do not require an external server.

## Preparation and session set up{-}

This tutorial is based on [R](@rcran). If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/IntroR_workshop.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # suppress math annotation
# Warning: the following option adaptation requires re-setting during session outro!
op <- options(gvis.plot.tag='chart')  # set gViz options 
# install libraries
install.packages(c("googleVis", "dplyr", "tidyr", "DT"))
```

```{r prep2, echo=F, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
op <- options(gvis.plot.tag='chart')  # set gViz options
```

Once you have installed R  and initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

## Getting Started{-}

To get started with motion charts, we load the `googleVis` package for the visualizations, the `dplyr` and the `tidyr` packages for data processing and also load a data set called `coocdata`. The `coocdata` contains information about how often adjectives were amplified by a degree adverb across time (see below). 

```{r mc1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(googleVis)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(DT)
# load data
coocdata <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/collex_decade.txt", sep = "\t")
# inspect data
head(coocdata, 10)
```

The `coocdata` is rather complex and requires some processing. First, we rename the columns to render their naming more meaningful. In this context we rename the *OBS* column *Frequency* and the *Amp* column *Amplifier*. As we are only interested if an adjective was amplified by *very*, we collapse all amplifiers that are not *very* in a bin category called *other*. We then calculate the frequency of the adjective within each time period and also the frequency with which each adjective is amplified by either *very* or *other* amplifiers. Then, we calculate the percentage with which each adjective is amplified by *very*.


```{r mc3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# process data
coocs <- coocdata %>%
  select(Decade, Amp, Adjective, OBS) %>%
  rename(Frequency = OBS,
         Amplifier = Amp) %>%
  mutate(Amplifier = ifelse(Amplifier == "very", "very", "other")) %>%
  group_by(Decade, Adjective, Amplifier) %>%
  summarise(Frequency = sum(Frequency)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  spread(Amplifier, Frequency) %>%
  group_by(Decade, Adjective) %>%
  mutate(Frequency_Adjective = sum(other + very),
         Percent_very = round(very/(other+very)*100, 2)) %>%
  mutate(Percent_very = ifelse(is.na(Percent_very), 0, Percent_very))
# inspect data
head(coocs, 10)
```

We now have a data set that we can use to generate interactive visualization.

# Interactive Versions of Common Visualization Types



## Scatter Plots{-}

Scatter plots show the relationship between two numeric variables if you have more than one observation per variable level (if the data is not grouped by another variable). This means that you can use scatter plots to display data when you have, e.g. more than one observation for each data in your data set. If you only have a single observation, you could also use a line graph (which we will turn to below).

```{r mc5, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create scatter plot
SC <- gvisScatterChart(coocs, 
                       options=list(
                         title="Interactive Scatter Plot",
                         legend="right",
                         pointSize=10,
                         series="{
                              0: { pointShape: 'circle' },
                              1: { pointShape: 'triangle' },
                              2: { pointShape: 'square' },
                              3: { pointShape: 'diamond' },
                              4: { pointShape: 'star' },
                              5: { pointShape: 'polygon' }
                              }"))
```

If you want to display the visualization in a Notebook environment, you can use the `plot` function .

```{r mc7, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(SC)
```

If you want to display the visualization on a website, you must use the `print` function rather than the `plot` function and specify that you want to print a `chart`.

```{r results='asis'}
print(SC, 'chart')
```

## Line Graphs{-}

# Motion Charts

Motion charts are dynamic charts that are used to explore changes in several variables across time. Motion charts are rendered within the browser using Flash which means that when you create a motion chart using the `plot` function, we new window in your browser will open and display the motion chart.

[Martin Hilpert](https://unine.academia.edu/MartinHilpert) has created a very recommendable screen-cast tutorial on how to create motion charts in R (see below).

  <p>Martin Hilpert's Motion Charts with R Tutorial.</p>
</iframe>

We will continue by generating a motion chart using the `gvisMotionChart` function which takes a data set, an id-variable and a time-variables as its main arguments. In addition, the  `gvisMotionChart` function takes various additional arguments such as what should be shown on the x- and y-axes, if the color or the size of the dots in the motion chart should represent another feature of the data.

```{r mc5, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create motion chart
MC <- gvisMotionChart(coocs, 
                      idvar = "Adjective", 
                      timevar = "Decade",
                      xvar = "Percent_very",
                      yvar = "Frequency_Adjective",
                      size = "Frequency_Adjective")
```

After generating the motion chart, we can plot this map object using the `plot` function if we are in a Notebook environment..

```{r mc7, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(MC)
```

If we want to generate interactive visualizations on websites (such as this website), we use the `print` fucntion rather than the `plot` function and sepcify that we want to print a `chart`.

```{r results='asis'}
print(MC, 'chart')
```

A browser window should open and and if you accept and execute Adobe Flash, then an interactive motion chart, like the one above, should appear which shows the  frequencies of adjectives across time as well as the percentage with which these adjectives were modified by *very*. You should also be able to hoover over any dot and see which adjective it stands for.

# Interactive Maps

You can also use the `googleVis` package to create interactive maps. In this example, we want to display the average life expectancy across the world for which we load a data set called *gapminder*. In addition, we reduce the data set by only selecting data from 2007 and only the average life expectancy as well as the country.

```{r imap1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data 
mapdata <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/gapminder.txt",
                            header = T, sep = "\t") %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
  filter(year == "2007") %>%
  rename(Country = country,
         Year = year,
         LifeExpectancy = lifeExp)
# inspect data
datatable(mapdata, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), filter = "none")
```

Now that we have data in a format that we can generate an interactive map, we use the `gvisGeoMap` function to create a map object.

```{r imap3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create motion chart object
Geo=gvisGeoMap(mapdata, locationvar = "Country", numvar = "LifeExpectancy", 
               options = list(height = 350, dataMode = 'regions'))
```

Now, we can then simply plot this map object using the `plot` function.

```{r imap5, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(Geo)
```

```{r results='asis'}
print(Geo, 'chart')
```

A browser window should open and and if you accept and execute Adobe Flash, then an interactive motion chart, like the one above, should appear which shows the life expectancy by country. You should also be able to hoover over any country and see its available life expectancy. 

## Session Outro{-}

When cerating interactive maps, it is importnat that you reset the default graphica parametsra s these had to be adapted in the sessions et-up. Therefore, in a final step, we restore the default graphics options.

```{r resetOptions}
## Set options back to original options
options(op)
```
