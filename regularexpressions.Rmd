# Introduction

This section focuses regular expressions and they can be used when working with language data.

# Preparation

As the following sections introduce regular expression using "R", it is necessary to install "R", "RStudio", and "Tinn-R". If these programms (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not installed yet, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, we clean the existign work spece and it is also useful to set certain options so that "R" does, e.g., not automatically convert strings into factors.


```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

```{r regex1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
