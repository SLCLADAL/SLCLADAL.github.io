# Introduction{-}

The data we work with comes in many formats and types. Therefore, this tutorial shows how you can load and save different types of data weh working with R.

```{r diff, echo=FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/g_chili.jpg")
```

This tutorial is aimed at beginners  with the aim of showcasing how to load and save different type of data and data structures in R. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged analysis but rather to show and exemplify how to load and save various different types of data in R.

The entire R Notebook for the tutorial can be downloaded [**here**](https://slcladal.github.io/loading.Rmd).  If you want to render the R Notebook on your machine, i.e. knitting the document to html or a pdf, you need to make sure that you have R and RStudio installed and you also need to download the [**bibliography file**](https://slcladal.github.io/bibliography.bib) and store it in the same folder where you store the Rmd file. <br></p>

## Preparation and session set up{-}

This tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the packages so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install packages
install.packages("xlsx")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("flextable")
install.packages("openxlsx")
install.packages("here")
# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks
remotes::install_github("rlesur/klippy")
```

Now that we have installed the packages, we can activate them as shown below.

```{r prep2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # suppress math annotation
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(flextable)
library(xlsx)
library(openxlsx)
library(here)
# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button
klippy::klippy()
```

Once you have installed RStudio and initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Getting started{-}

Tables are one of the most common and important ways to process, handle, and describe data. This tutorial introduces different types of tables, how to load and save different types of tables, as well as how to modify and process tables and tabulated data.

When working with R, there are different kinds or types of tables that have different characteristics. The most common types of tables in R are:

* matrices
* data frames
* tibbles

Matrices can only contain one type of data and all data points will be converted to the type of scale with the lowest information value. For instance, if at least one variables in a table represents characters (or strings), then all other variables are also converted into characters (although they may be numbers). 

Data frames can contain different types of scales and variables are not converted automatically. In this sense, data frames are more flexible and are preferable over matrices.

Tibbles are the tidyverse equivalent of data frames which offer new functions and possibilities of handling and inspecting the data. . 

# Loading tables into R{-}

There are several different functions that allow us to read tabulated data into R. In our case, we use the `readRDS` function which loads Rdata sets. 

```{r lt1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data with read.delim
mytable <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mld.rda", "rb"))
```


```{r line_0, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
mytable %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  head(10) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::set_table_properties(width = .5, layout = "autofit") %>%
  flextable::theme_zebra() %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12) %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12, part = "header") %>%
  flextable::align_text_col(align = "center") %>%
  flextable::set_caption(caption = "First 10 rows of mytable.")  %>%
  flextable::border_outer()
```


If  the data is stored as a txt-file, there are various functions to read in the data. The most common functions are `read.delim` and `read.table`. 

```{r lt2, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data with read.delim
tab1 <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mlrdata.txt", 
                   sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
tab2 <- read.table("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mlrdata.txt", header = TRUE)
```

To load excel data from the web, you can use the `read.xlsx` function from the `openxlsx` package.

```{r lt3b, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
exceldata <- openxlsx::read.xlsx("https://slcladal.github.io/data/testdata1.xlsx", 
                                 sheet = 1)
```

```{r line_01b, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
exceldata %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  head(10) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::set_table_properties(width = .5, layout = "autofit") %>%
  flextable::theme_zebra() %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12) %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12, part = "header") %>%
  flextable::align_text_col(align = "center") %>%
  flextable::set_caption(caption = "First 10 rows of the exceldata.")  %>%
  flextable::border_outer()
```

To load excel data from your own computer, you can use the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package (which is part of the tidyverse and thus does not need to be installed separately.

```{r excel7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
excelcomp <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "testdata1.xlsx"), sheet = 1)
```

```{r excel8, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
excelcomp %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  head(10) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::set_table_properties(width = .5, layout = "autofit") %>%
  flextable::theme_zebra() %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12) %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12, part = "header") %>%
  flextable::align_text_col(align = "center") %>%
  flextable::set_caption(caption = "First 10 rows of the excelcomp data.")  %>%
  flextable::border_outer()
```
