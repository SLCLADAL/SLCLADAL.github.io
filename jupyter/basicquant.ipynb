                "Perhaps the most trivial and important issues related to the processing and analysis of data are the questions *What is statistics?* and *Why should I use statistics?*. A simple answer to the first question is that statistics is a way to find out about the world around us in quantitative terms. Statistics therefore comprises methods that perform *quantitative analyses*. Quantitative analyses use numeric information to understand the world and they are very important in science (which I take here to refer to any approach that uses the scientific method to gain a reliable understanding of the world around us). The answer to the second question is more complicated but we can say that we use statistics for three main purposes:\n",

As such, statistics comprises methods (quantitative analyses) that we use in science to understand the world around us. Science can be defined as a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe [@wilson1999natural 58]. One of the most fundamental concepts in that definition is the concept of testable explanations. Another name for such explanations is *hypothesis*. Thus, Edward Wilson's definition of science can be rephrased (somewhat crudely) as the methodological testing of hypotheses. This goes to show that hypotheses are at the very heart of the scientific endeavor. \n",

The aim of experiments, in the most basic sense, is to determine if a result differs based on a change in some condition. The experimenter would change the condition only in the test group while not changing it in the control group while everything else remains constant. That way, it is possible to test if the change in the condition is responsible for the change in the outcome. \n",

The most common type of this design are corpus studies in which texts (which encompasses both written and transcribed spoken language) are searched for the occurrence of certain linguistic patterns and then correlated with some other feature, the use of a certain linguistic construction such as a specific suffix or a fixed expression like *in order that* in two different time periods or dialects.\n",

However, even compiling a corpus can be comparatively easy and cheap, for example, if you compile a corpus consisting of a collection of texts that are available online but the costs can be substantive if you, for example, first need to record and transcribe spoken language in the field).\n",

Introspection is, of course, by far the easiest and cheapest way to \"collect data\". Unfortunately, introspection is *subjective* and can be heavily biased by the expectations and theoretical framework of subjects. Nonetheless, introspection can be and is extremely useful in particular regarding hypothesis generation and finding potential predictors for a certain linguistic behavior that can then be tested empirically.\n",

A Likert scale, pronounced /lick.ert/ and named after the psychologist Rensis Likert, and often ranges from *strongly disagree* to *strongly agree* (or analogously from *never* to *very frequently* or *extremely unlikely* to *extremely likely*). Typically, respondents are given 5 or 7 options with the endpoints noted above representing the endpoints and respondents are asked to select the options that best matches their evaluation. \n",

In DCTs, respondents are asked to imagine a certain discourse context or situation and are then asked how they would answer, respond, or express something. While DCTs have been shown to provide data that mirrors real-world behaviors, it is less reliable compared to corpus data as respondents cannot necessarily provide accurate information about their linguistic behavior.\n",

To counter what is called *agreeability effects*, researchers commonly have respondents rate test items (items that contain the phenomenon researchers are interested in) and fillers (items that do not contain what researchers are interested in). Fillers are included to disguise what the questionnaire aim to test so that respondents cannot (unconsciously) try to provide agreeable answers (the answers that researchers hope to get).  \n",

The variables in your hypothesis must be operationalized, i.e., you need to determine what exactly needs to be investigated, what counts, what is measured. In other words, *operationalization* is the measurement of a variable. If possible, a variable should be operationalized so that its measurement is as good as possible reflects the underlying concept. \n",

For instance, one could experimentally investigate which methods lead to better recall of nonsense-syllables (syllables not occurring in the speakers' natural L1) but this would not necessarily allow us to generalize these finding to the \"real\" world. External validity in this context would mean that the findings can also be transferred to other real-world memory tasks, such as vocabulary learning.\n",

In experiments, the independent variable(s) are manipulated to investigate its influence on the dependent variable.
