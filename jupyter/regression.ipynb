We will have a look at two simple examples to understand what the concepts underlying a regression mean and how a regression works. The R-code, that we will use, is adapted from @field2012discovering  - which is highly recommended for understanding regression analyses! In addition to @field2012discovering, there are various introductions which also focus on regression (among other types of analyses), for example, @gries2021statistics,  @winter2019statistics, @levshina2015linguistics, or @wilcox2009basic. @baayen2008analyzing is also very good but probably not the first book one should read about statistics.\n",

The preference for either method is grounded in historical happenstances and the culture of these subdisciplines rather than in methodological reasoning. However, ANOVA are more restricted in that they can only take numeric dependent variables and they have stricter model assumptions that are violated more readily. In addition, a minor difference between regressions and ANOVA lies in the fact that regressions are based on the $t$-distribution while ANOVAs use the F-distribution (however, the F-value is simply the value of t squared or t^2^). Both t- and F-values report on the ratio between explained and unexplained variance.\n",

A relatively small SE value therefore indicates that the coefficients will remain very stable if the same regression model is fitted to many different samples with identical parameters. In contrast, a large SE tells you that the model is volatile and not very stable or reliable as the coefficients vary substantially if the model is applied to many samples. \n",

Such rules of thumb are inadequate because the required sample size depends on the number of variables in a given model, the size of the effect and the variance of the effect. If a model contains many variables, then this requires a larger sample size than a model which only uses very few predictors. Also, to detect an effect with a very minor effect size, one needs a substantially larger sample compared to cases where the effect is very strong. In fact, when dealing with small effects, model require a minimum of 600 cases to reliably detect these effects. Finally, effects that are very robust and do not vary much require a much smaller sample size compared with effects that are spurious and vary substantially.

Imagine you want to climb down from a roof top and you have a ladder. The problem is that you do not know if and how many steps are broken. This is similar to using automated model fitting.

A multiple R^2^-value of 0 would inform us that the model does not explain any variance while a value of .852 mean that the model explains 85.2 percent of the variance. A value of 1 would inform us that the model explains 100 percent of the variance and that the predictions of the model match the observed values perfectly. Multiplying the multiple R^2^-value thus provides the percentage of explained variance. Models that have a multiple R^2^-value equal or higher than .05 are deemed substantially significant [see @szmrecsanyi2006morphosyntactic 55]. It has been claimed that models should explain a minimum of 5 percent of variance but this is problematic as it is not uncommon for models to have very low explanatory power while still performing significantly and systematically better than chance. In addition, the total amount of variance is negligible in cases where one is interested in very weak but significant effects. It is much more important for model to perform significantly better than minimal base-line models because if this is not the case, then the model does not have any predictive and therefore no explanatory power.\n",

Ideally, the difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value should be very small as this means that the model is not overfitted. If, however, the difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value is substantial, then this would strongly suggest that the model is unstable and overfitted to the data while being inadequate for drawing inferences about the population. Differences between multiple and adjusted R^2^-values indicate that the data contains outliers that cause the distribution of the data on which the model is based to differ from the distributions that the model mathematically requires to provide reliable estimates. The difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value in our model is very small (85.2-84.7=.05) and should not cause concern.\n",

The most fundamental difference between logistic and linear regressions is that logistic regression work on the probabilities of an outcome (the likelihood), rather than the outcome itself. In addition, the likelihoods on which the logistic regression works must be logged (logarithmized) in order to avoid produce predictions that produce values greater than 1 (instance occurs) and 0 (instance does not occur).

In contrast to a linear regression, which predicts actual values, such as the frequencies of prepositions in a certain text, a logistic regression predicts *probabilities* of events (for example, being in a relationship) rather than actual values. The center panel shows the predictions of a logistic regression and we see that a logistic regression also has an intercept and a (very steep) slope but that the regression line also predicts values that are above 1 and below 0. However, when we log the predicted values we these predicted values are transformed into probabilities with values between 0 and 1. And the logged regression line has a S-shape which reflects the logistic function. Furthermore, we can then find the optimal line (the line with the lowest residual deviance) by comparing the sum of residuals - just as we did for a simple linear model and that way, we find the regression line for a logistic regression. \n",

If a model contains predictors that have variance inflation factors (VIF) > 10 the model is unreliable [@myers1990classical]. @gries2021statistics shows that a VIF of 10 means that that predictor is explainable (predictable) from the other predictors in the model with an R^2^ of .9 (a VIF of 5 means that predictor is explainable (predictable) from the other predictors in the model with an R^2^ of .8).Indeed, predictors with VIF values greater than 4 are usually already problematic but, for large data sets, even VIFs greater than 2 can lead inflated standard errors ([Jaeger 2013](http://wiki.bcs.rochester.edu/HlpLab/LSA2013Regression?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=LSA13-Lecture6-CommonIssuesAndSolutions.pdf)). Also, VIFs of 2.5 can be problematic [@szmrecsanyi2006morphosyntactic 215] and [@zuur2010protocol] proposes that variables with VIFs exceeding 3 should be removed.\n",

The Gaussian Normal Distribution is very flexible because it is defined by two parameters, the mean (mu, i.e. $\\mu$) and the standard deviation (sigma, i.e. $\\sigma$). This allows the normal distribution to take very different shapes (for example, very high and slim (compressed) or very wide and flat). In contrast, the Poisson is defined by only one parameter (lambda, i.e. $\\lambda$) which mean that if we have a mean of 2, then the standard deviation is also 2 (actually we would have to say that the mean is $\\lambda$ and the standard deviation is also  $\\lambda$ or $\\lambda$ = $\\mu$ = $\\sigma$).

Having only fixed-effects means that all data points are treated as if they are completely independent and thus on the same hierarchical level. However, it is very common that the data is nested in the sense that data points are not independent because they are, for instance produced by the same speaker or are grouped by some other characteristic. In such cases, the data is considered hierarchical and statistical models should incorporate such structural features of the data they work upon. With respect to regression modeling, hierarchical structures are incorporated by what is called *random effects*. When models only have a fixed-effects structure, then they make use of only a single intercept and/or slope (as in the left panel in the figure below), while mixed effects models have intercepts for each level of a random effect. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this would mean that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and/or slope for each speaker (in addition to the overall intercept that is shown as an orange line in the figure below). \n"

Variables with 5 to 10 levels can be used as both.

In mixed-models, hierarchical structures are modelled as *random effects*. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this means that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and/or slope for each speaker. \n",
                "\n",
                "*Random Effects* in linear models can be visualized using two parameters: the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0) and the slope (the acclivity of the regression line). In contrast to linear mixed-effects models, random effects differ in the position and the slope of the logistic function that is applied to the likelihood of the dependent variable.  *random intercepts* (center left panel \\ref{fig:mem02}) or various *random slopes* (center right panel \\ref{fig:mem02}), or both, various *random intercepts* and various *random slopes* (right panel \\ref{fig:mem02}). In the following, we will only focus on models with random intercepts because this is the by far more common method and because including both random intercepts and random slopes requires huge amounts of data. Consider the Figure below to understand what is meant by \"random intercepts\".\n"

To avoid *incomplete information* (a combination of variables does not occur in the data), we tabulate the variables we intend to include and make sure that all possible combinations are present in the data. Including variables although not all combinations are present in the data would lead to unreliable models that report (vastly) inaccurate results. A special case of incomplete information is *complete separation* which occurs if one predictor perfectly explains an outcome (in that case the incomplete information would be caused by a level of the dependent variable). In addition, we make sure that the VIFs do not exceed a maximum of 3 for main effects [@zuur2010protocol] - @booth1994regression suggest that VIFs should ideally be lower than 3 for as higher values would indicate multicollinearity and thus that the model is unstable. The value of 3 should be taken with a pinch of salt because there is no clear consensus about what the maximum VIF for interactions should be or if it should be considered at all. The reason is that we would, of course, expect the VIFs to increase when we are dealing with interactions as the main effects that are part of the interaction are very likely to correlate with the interaction itself. However, if the VIFs are too high, then this will still cause the issues with the attribution of variance. The value of 3 was chosen based on recommendations in the standard literature on multicollinearity [@zuur2009mixedmodels; @neter1990vif]. Only once we have confirmed that the incomplete information, complete separation, and *multicollinearity* are not a major concern, we generate the more saturated model and test whether the inclusion of a predictor leads to a significant reduction in residual deviance. If the predictor explains a significant amount of variance, it is retained in the model while being disregarded in case it does not explain a sufficient quantity of variance.  \n",

However, @zuur2013beginner suggest to use negative-binomial model instead. This is so because the scaling of the standard errors performed by quasi-Poisson models only affects the significance of coefficients (the p-values) but it does not affect the coefficients which, however, may be affected themselves by overdispersion. Thus, the coefficients of Poisson as well as quasi-Poisson models (which are identical) may be unreliable when dealing with overdispersion. Negative binomial models, in contrast, include an additional dispersion or heterogeneity parameter which accommodates overdispersion better than merely scaling the standard errors [see @zuur2013beginner 21].\n"
