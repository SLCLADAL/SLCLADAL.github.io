For example, *Merry Christmas* is a collocation because *merry* and *Christmas* occur more frequently together than would be expected by chance. This means that if you were to shuffle all words in a corpus and would then test the frequency of how often *merry* and *Christmas* co-occurred, they would occur significantly less often in the shuffled or randomized corpus than in a corpus that contain non-shuffled natural speech. \n",
