Using the `bind_tf_idf()` function from the *tidytext* package, we can extract the *term frequency - inverse document frequency*, or tf-idf, scores which represent these relative weights and we can also  report other parameters such as number of occurrences of that word, total number of words and term frequency.\n",

Now, a text that is 100 words long and consist of 50 distinct words would have a TTR of .5 (50/100) while a text that is 100 words long but consist of 80 distinct words would have a TTR of .8 (80/100).
