While the initial example focuses on English, subsequent sections show how easily this approach can be generalized to languages other than English (e.g. German, French, Spanish, Italian, or Dutch). The entire R-markdown document for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/lex.Rmd).\n",

If such dictionaries, that are typically published as books contain translations of words in other languages, they are referred to as lexicons. Therefore, lexicographical references show the inter-relationships among lexical data, i.e. words.\n",

Hence, computational lexicology has been defined as the use of computers in the study of machine-readable dictionaries  [see e.g. @amsler1981structure]. Computational lexicology is distinguished from *computational lexicography*, which can be defined as the use of computers in the construction of dictionaries which is the focus of this tutorial. It should be noted, thought, that computational lexicology and computational lexicography are often used synonymously. \n",

The Word-Emotion Association Lexicon which comprises 10,170 terms, and in which lexical elements are assigned scores based on ratings gathered through the crowd-sourced Amazon Mechanical Turk service. For the Word-Emotion Association Lexicon raters were asked whether a given word was associated with one of eight emotions. The resulting associations between terms and emotions are based on 38,726 ratings from 2,216 raters who answered a sequence of questions for each word which were then fed into the emotion association rating (see @mohammad2013crowdsourcing). Each term was rated 5 times. For 85 percent of words, at least 4 raters provided identical ratings. For instance, the word *cry* or *tragedy* are more readily associated with SADNESS while words such as *happy* or *beautiful* are indicative of JOY and words like *fit* or *burst* may indicate ANGER. This means that the sentiment analysis here allows us to investigate the expression of certain core emotions rather than merely classifying statements along the lines of a crude positive-negative distinction.\n",

In principle, generating translation dictionaries is relatively easy and straight forward. However, not only is the devil hidden in the details but the generation of data-driven translation dictionaries also require a substantial data set consisting of sentences and their translation.

The same procedure can be extended to generate multilingual dictionaries. Problems arise due to grammatical differences between languages, idiomatic expressions, homonymy and polysemy as well as due to word class issues. The latter, word class issues, can be solved by part-of-speech tagging and then only considering words that belong to the same (or realistically similar) parts-of speech.
