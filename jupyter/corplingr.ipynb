                "In the following, we will create many different columns, but we will always follow the same scheme: generate a new column using the `mutate` function from the `dplyr` package and then remove stuff that we do not need by using the `str_remove_all` function from the `stringr` package or just the `gsub` function - which is a simple replacement function. We can also use `str_squish` to get rid of superfluous white spaces. We will always remove sequences that are defined by a string (a sequence of characters and a regular expression consisting of the regular expression that determines what type of symbol R is supposed to look for and a numerator which tells R how many times that symbol can occur). For example, `%mor:.*` tells R to look for the sequence `%mor:` and any symbol, repeated between zero and an infinite number of times, that comes after the `%mor:` sequence. As thsi is put into the `str_replace_all` function and applied to the `rawcontent` file, it will replace everything that comes after `%mor:` and the sequence `%mor:` itself.\n",
