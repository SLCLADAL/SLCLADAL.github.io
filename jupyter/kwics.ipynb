Concordancing are central to analyses of text and they often represents the first step in more sophisticated analyses of language data [@stafanowitsch2020corpus]. The play such a key role in the language sciences because concordances are extremely valuable for understanding how a word or phrase is used, how often it is used, and in which contexts is used. As concordances allow us to analyze the context in which a word or phrase occurs and provide frequency information about word use, they also enable us to analyze collocations or the collocational profiles of words and phrases [@stafanowitsch2020corpus 50-51]. Finally, concordances can also be used to extract examples and it is a very common procedure. \n"
