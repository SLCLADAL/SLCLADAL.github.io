Right Honourable This is only to signify unto his Majesty that by God's favour within two or three days after the date thereof we shall depart from hence so as my next will be from Augusta where there is as you know a feat to be done for which the party is well prepared I leave here (as Sir Dudley Carleton did during the whole time of his negotiation in Piedmont) Gregorio de' Monti to supply the service by continual advertisements upon which point I gave a touch at my leave taking to the Prince desiring him to esteem it as an argument of clear and disumbrageous friendship that we serve ourselves even of his own subjects for Gregorio is a natural Venetian though now many years as it were Englished with singular approvement both of his fidelity diligence and discretion Whereof he hath likewise a testimony from his Majesty under his royal hand sent him in the time of Sir Ralphe Winwoode for his better encouragement after my predecessor and myself had repre_sented his good deservings Now to return to myself I carry in my breast besides that honest business which you know some important commissions from this State which have a silent reflection (though not meant by them) upon our main end These I shall particularize in my letter from Augusta and will end the present with mine humble thanks to Almighty God for the happy news which we have had this week of his Majesty's escape from a painful infirmity The same good God yield him long unto us and to the Christian world And so I rest At your Honour's commandment HENRY WOTTON
