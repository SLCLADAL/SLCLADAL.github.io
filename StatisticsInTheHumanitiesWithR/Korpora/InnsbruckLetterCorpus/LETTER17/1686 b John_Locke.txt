Sir The manner wherewith you continue to speak of the advice I have ventured to send you concerning your son makes me fear that in perusing it you more regard the intention and friendship of the author than the meanness of the thing itself since you so far mistake it as to think that it has laid the debt on your side and such an one as you imagine you can never get out of which when I on the other side consider your favours I conclude I have all the reason in the world to say in your own words that I must forever remain your debtor But to enter into a dispute with you wherein an excess of friendship makes you obstinate I have another reason to suspect that your considera_tion for the person that gave it makes you overlook many things in the advice itself since that I receive not from you any objec_tions about any part of it For though I must own it is according to the best of my skill and though I know the affection I writ it with to be very sincere yet I can by no means fancy my opinion infallible or that it should in all things so exactly jump with yours and madam's that you should find nothing (in what is already put in practice) to be added omitted or altered whereof however you say nothing at all For I doubt not but when I revise the foul copy which I keep by me on purpose I shall myself find occasion for additions or alterations I do not at all wonder that you have not yet found a tutor to your mind and I confess the truth somewhat pleased with it Not that you are hitherto disappointed but that I perceive that you are more curious in your choice than to take up a venture with the first or second that comes in your way 'Tis of great consequence to your son and therfore you cannot be too nice in it If you could get your cousin to Chipley a sober well conditioned young man with moderate learning would do the business but you know his humour and how averse to trouble especially of some kind But as to the law suit I mentioned in my last I conclude upon second thoughts that it is best to let it perfectly alone himself shall of his own accord discourse of his own concerns and give his advice about it and then it would perhaps be not amiss to enquire and reason with him for your own satisfaction of the grounds he proceeds on As to your Carolina affair I remember the owner told me it was a Landgraveship of forty eight thousand acres of land and the privileges thereunto belonging which are to be seen in the Fundamental Constitutions This is enough for your Scotch friend to know to see to what terms he will come which when they are judged reasonable or near the matter the patent now in the executors' hands will be forthcoming time enough if the mice have not eaten it as I believe not in a strong wooden chest where he was wont to keep it and which Adrian had the direction to open which I remember was this You must turn {figure the key with the sun once round and a quarter and then turn it back again half a round and so let it stand For example the key put in at the keyhold a must be turned by b c d quite to b again and from b be turned back again to d and there let stand and then the lid of the chest may be lifted up This I am sure is the just quantity of the motion that the key must have and I think for making it you must begin the motion with the sun but this I do not perfectly remember and therfore nothing must be forced in the case for if the contrary motion from a to d and so round be the way to open it you must do the quite contrary in all things When it is open you will find one turn to lock it as it does other locks This much I remember of the lock itself but where the chest itself is that the executors know I for my part know not This I only know that if you can persuade my cousin somerton and his wife to make use of it and remove thither (which I should advise him to if the plantation flourishes and promises any good) he may have this interest for acceptance As you are content your pictures should remain in the hands of the merchant here that bought them for you till you have informed yourself concerning that sort of merchandise and to what port either london or exeter you were best have them so I find he is not in hast for the slate of the account between you which therefore you need not be at the pains to send till he demand it He hopes as I perceive that this shall not be the last business he shall have with you and therfore expects not to have the just balance returned but an entire sum something near it may serve the turn The rest I perceive he is not troubled should remain as a nest egg till a farther occasion as much as I know of him he is a very fair conditioned man and knows very well your character I am glad to hear my Lady King's son thrives so very well but the Lady I meant is a relation of the Lady that did me the honour to remember to me in your last Pray present my humble service to her and let her know I should be glad if there were anything here for her service My service also to my Valentine Susan and her man Thomas and to all you mention in your last letter Sutton business dissatisfies me mightily If that estate will yield nothing by the year I am of opinion you should sell it and make present money of it at least the very proposition will quicken the man that deceived you and your aunt so scurvily My most humble service to your Lady and little ones I am Sir your most humble servant J L {John_Locke I hope you will talk at large and fully with Adrian He that copied my last long letter mistook in the names of some books which I much desire you to correct and for Bacon to set down Chillingworth and for Tacitus Tully I sent you lately a part of my reasonings de intellectu humano which I hope came safe for you know we are all concerned for our own conceptions how idle soever
