Upon the coming down of your Townsmen to Cam_bridge Captain Langley not knowing how to dispose of them desired me to nominate a fit Captain which I did an honest religious valiant Gentleman Cap_tain Dodsworth the Bearer hereof He hath diligently attended the service and much improved his men in their exercise but hath been un_happy beyond others in not receiving any pay for him_self and what he had for his soldiers is out long ago He hath by his prudence what with fair and winning carriage what with money borrowed kept them to_gether He is able to do so no longer they will pre_sently disband if a course be not taken It's a pity it should be so! For I believe they are brought into as good order as most Companies in the Army Besides at this instant there is great need to use them I have received a special command from my Lord General To advance with what force we can to put an end if it may be to this Work God so as_sisting from whom all help cometh I beseech you therefore consider this Gentleman and the soldiers and if it be possible make up his Company a Hundred and twenty and send them away with what expedition is possible It may through God's blessing prove very happy one month's pay may prove all your trouble I speak to wise men God direct you I rest Yours to serve you Oliver Cromwell 
