To the Worthiest Lady Mistress Magdalen Herbert MADAM Every excuse hath in it somewhat of accusation and since I am innocent and yet must excuse how shall I do for that part of accusing? By my troth as desperate and perplexed men grow from thence bold so must I take the boldness of accusing you who would draw so dark a curtain betwixt me and your purposes as that I had no glimmering neither of your goings nor the way which my letters might haunt yet have I given this licence to travel but I know not whither nor it It is therefore rather a pinnace to discover and the entire colony of letters of hundreds an fifties must follow whose employment is more honourable than that which our State meditates to Virginia because you are worthier than all of that country of which that is a wretched inch for you have better treasure and a harmlessness If this sound like a flattery tear it out I am to my letters as rigid as a Puritan as Caesar was to his wife I can as ill endure a suspicion and misinterpretable word as a fault But remember that nothing is flattery which the speaker believes and of the grossest flattery there is this good use that they tell us what we should be But madam you are beyond instruction and therefore there can belong to you only praises of which though you be no good hearer yet allow all my letters leave to have in them one part of it which is thankfulness towards you Your un_worthiest servant except your accepting have mended him John Donne Micham July 11 1607
