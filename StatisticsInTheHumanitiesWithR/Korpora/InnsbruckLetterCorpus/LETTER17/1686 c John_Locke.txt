Sir Though I have taken so much pains in my business and recovered more of haroll than I expected or I believe I should have done had I been there myself yet it is to be doubted whether you will permit me to give you thanks But whatever right you think you have particularly to do me all the kindness imaginable I crave leave to be sensible of your favours and to be sorry it lies not in my power to make acknowledgments that may bear any proportion with them I could not forbear saying this much to you and send you half a dozen lines of acknowledg_ment after you had spent the greatest part of twelve days in a most troublesome affair of mine And therfore pray pardon me and believe that I have no compliments for you though I have all the true esteem and affection one friend can have for another I fear Mr Stratton is but a slow man of london I put something into one of my letters to you to quicken him Whether you received it or thought fit to make use of it I know not But in good earnest it were better that little tenement were reduced into money than to yield no other income but trouble to me or my friends though I doubt whether chapmen are there to be had I was sorry to hear by yours of 30th August of the death of your man I suppose without the help of instances in your view you know of what value a trusty servant is Though I gave you an account by memorandum that I thought ablele trees were to be got as good or better nearer home than from hence it was not to spare myself the trouble of send_ing them since I have not so much pleasure in anything as when I am doing you some service I have therefore taken order to have some got for you therefore pray take order with Mr Elwill about them for to him they will be consigned With them you will also receive some Muscovy or Russian cabbage seed and some blood red cabbage seed which they look on here as the wholesomest of all and perhaps not without reason for let me tell you this as a thing worth your remembrance that it is one of the best remedies I know against the scurvy Besides boiling of it as we do our cabbage ordinarily they use it here also raw as their constant winter salad having always a store of them for the winter which I am told the gardeners preserve by laying them in straw in deep holes dug into the ground on purpose Their way of using them for salads is this they take a cabbage and slice as much of it off as will serve for the present meal just as you would slice a cucumber Whereby the leaves being cut across fall into little shreds which look handsomely in the dish and dressed with oil and vinegar is no ill salad And if you keep your counsel well I believe be scarce known what it is and the truth is being very wholesome if I were there I would bring it into use under some fine new name for after I had been a little accustomed to it I eat it with pleasure I wonder you had not heard by the 2nd of October of several sorts of seeds sent you by a neighbour of yours and the third book De intellectu humano sent by the same hand Pray when you go to market enquire after them if you have no news of them sooner But to return to the ablele trees pray what do you mean by so great a number of them? It is true they are quickly up but what are they good for when grown? If you cannot learn that the timber is good for something I advise you to plant no more of them than you have need of for some present shade or shelter For if they are not good timber they are not beautiful there is nothing recommends them but their quick growth and for me I little value unless it be some present need things that are soon ripe and soon rotten Indeed I have heard that their boards are almost as good as deal for floorings of rooms and dry uses but I doubt it In a rich soil like yours where all things grow so well I should choose to have a walk up to the front of the house of limes only for beauty two rows of a side and a space between them as broad as the front of your house or ten or fifteen foot broader as I formerly told you But behind the house I would have a walk of the same fashion of elms and on the sides of other useful trees (perhaps oak should be one) which will serve for beauty and use too and pay for their standing Abeles I would only place either where others will not grow or where I have need of a present fence and then I would place oaks amongst them or behind them which is better which might do the business when they are gone but not knowing your design I talk at random though with a good intention Pray remember me to your Spa friends Pray observe nicely without letting them perceive that you do so how I stand in each of their books We had some pleasant scenes here which would come into the history of my travels if I were with you to tell them The promise of lime tree seeds has failed me The seedsman tells me the skipper brings word that he came too late to Norway I fear tis an excuse for I had bespoke them before you writ to me but what remedy? I must be content with a promise for another year I fear by your silence you are not yet provided of a man such as we sought for my young master Let this (if it be so) in the meantime satisfy you that none is much better than an unfit one And if I knew what state he at present was in as to learn_ing I might perhaps think of some way wherein he might under your eye improve sufficiently for his years without almost any trouble to you and so the principles of virtue sense and breeding which are the main business be preserved and nursed up in the way you have begun and not all these as is used be sacrificed to a little Latin under the management of an ill or imprudent tutor unskilled as it often happens in those essential points Though it hath hitherto escaped my pen yet it has been often in my head to enquire what course you took about your water and whether you are supplied from the spring we examined when I was there I have had many projects upon that affair in my head though I never troubled you with any of them hoping that your house is well supplied with good water without them Pray present my humble service to Madam I had designed her a long letter by a Lady of her acquaintaince I parted with not long since at the Brill But finding that other people's letters were refused to be meddled with I thought it good manners not to give the trouble of any of mine so that the two Ladies were excused one from carrying and the other from reading a long letter from me But pray tell her she has no great loss in it For it being past doubt that I am her humble servant with the utmost affection and respect anybody can be I had nothing to add to it but compliments for my being at that distance which permits me not those opportunities of performing those parts of duty and gratitude belong to me and enjoying sometimes at Chipley the company I most desire in the world I am Sir your most obliged and most humble servant J L {John_Locke Pray remember me to young master and my little pretty Mistress J I take it something amiss that you have said nothing par_ticularly of her to me this long time but I am glad to hear from another hand that all your little ones thrive bravely for so I am told in a letter I lately received The news you may believe was very welcome both because I have so much reason to love father and mother and all the family and also I am glad to find that my plain rustic way of feeding and nursing children has not such hardships in it as to hurt even the tender sex For I flatter myself that Madam in breeding her daughters has inclined a little to my method
