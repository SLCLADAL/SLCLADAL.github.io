Sir I take presumption upon the assured promise of your love to write unto you herein a few private lines about myself whereof the scope is this to beseech you that as you have obtained leave for my return home the next spring to the comfortable sight of my gracious master so you will be pleased likewise to deal with his Majesty in my behalf that none may be appointed to succeed me here till my arrival because when I have settled some of my peculiar occasions I shall rather wish to come hither back again than to be onerous to his Majesty at home for without his bounty I cannot live In the meanwhile my Italian ssecretary Gregorio de' Monti (who supplied the place all the while that Sir Dudley Carleton was at Turino and afterwards till my coming) will discharge it with fidelity and discretion being a person of much sufficiency and of twelve years' approvement in the King's service This is my most humble and hearty request unto you about which I have by letter prayed Mr Bargrave to intercede with you for me But having not heard from him I thought fit provisionally to move it by mine own pen having with no man else living communicated these thoughts about which I shall languish to receive a line or two from you And so again Sir I am yours HENRY WOTTON
