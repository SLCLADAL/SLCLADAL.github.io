Gentlemen my very Worthy friends His Majesty open'd this Session with the Speech which I send you inclosed And after that the Lord Chancellour spoke at large but the Copy of it not hauing been communicated to the House of Commons they appointed a Committee to peruse the Lords Journall for it where such things are of course to be entred The Lords have also ordered the Speech to be Printed so that I suppose one way or other I may by the next Post compasse it for you The House of Commons opened their session as is usuall with reading a Bill and that which was pitched upon was the former Bill for regulating the Collection of Hearth mony and then they appointed a day for its second reading The rest of their time was spent in settling the ordinary affaires of their House appoint_ing days for their Grand Committees naming and impowring their Committee of Privileges and renewing the Clause against Bribery or interteinments in order to Elections and lastly in receiving severall Petitions concerning undue Elections What I remarke in the House is that it is much fuller then ordinary and more are still upon the Road and there seems a more then usuall concernment among all men as if some great and I hope good thing were to be expected God in his mercy direct all to the best What I understand thereof I shall from time to time communicate to you remaining Gentlemen &c Your most affectionate Servant Andr Marvell Westm May 23 1678
