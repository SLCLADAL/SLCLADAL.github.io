Sir I must confess I am extremely pleased I have done you any service in reference to your children But do not think that those mighty thanks you heap upon me for it in your last ought to make me forget the solid obligations I have to you For after all that you do or can say in magnifying this essay of mine I must consider it as but a faint offer at some kind of acknowledgment for your favours and I beseeech you to receive it as such from one who wishes for nothing more than the of oppor_tunities of showing how sensible he is of them Upon this confidence and the good success you assure me our method hath hitherto had I venture to trouble you with the remainder of my thoughts on that subject and in this one more long sheet you will find I am come to the end of my tether For having con_ducted my young master to the age when he will be got out of the hands of masters and tutors we are at the bounds of what is said to concern education I do not pretend though I am now come to the conclusion that I have given you a just treatise on this matter There are a thousand other things that may need consideration especially if one should take in the various tempers different inclinations and particular defaults that are to be found in children and prescribe proper remedies to each of them But in this tumultuary draft I have made for your son I have considered him barely as white paper as a piece of wax to be moulded and fashioned and therefore have only touched those heads which I judged necessary to the breeding of a young gentleman of his condition in general And though I have with a great deal of freedom given you my opinion con_cerning all those things that came in my thoughts and appeared material yet I am too sensible of my want of experience in this affair and the oversights I am liable to to think that I have writ approaches anything more perfect even in that kind You must not therefore though I am come to the end look on it as a treatise wich I put into your hands for complete It is well if being writ (as it has been) by scraps at distant times and places it will hold together and be of a piece What parts you find I have either wholly omitted or too slightly touched on I desire you to remind me of For since I shall not scruple to trouble you with anything else on this subject which may at any time hereafter come into my thoughts you may be sure I shall much more readily do so when you shall set me on work or propose any new matter you shall find wanting which your care and concern for your dear little ones cannot (I conclude) fail to suggest to you in abundance it being a fate that usually attends the speculations which contemplative men have pleased them_selves with in their studies to be found very defective when they come to be put in practice As to remedies for peculiar disorders the account you give me of your son makes me think I shall have little to say on that occasion You will not suspect I flatter you when I say his temper is as one could wish and the love of reason he shows in his inquiries and discourses is as much to be preferred to that prattling quickness which we are apt to be delighted in with children as a healthy well made boy is to a gaudy suit and if it were necesssary there I think I could show you that that witty pertness that appears sometimes so early proceeds from a prin_ciple that seldom accompanies a strong constitution of body or ripens into a strong judgment of mind And if you desire to have him a more brisk talker I believe I could teach you the way to make him so But I find you had rather your son should be able and useful when a man the pretty company and diversion to others whilst a child though if that too were to be considered I think I may say there is not so much pleasure to have a child prattle agreeably as to reason well Encourage therfore his inquisitiveness all you can by satisfying his demands and inform his judgment as far as it is capable When his reasons are any way tolerable let him find the credit and commendation of it and when they are quite out of the way let him without being laughed at for his mistake be gently put into the right and can take care as much as you can that in this inclination he shows to reason about everything nobody baulk or impose upon him For when we have all done the right improvement and exercise of that faculty is the highest perfection of a man and furnishes all the true light which our minds can attain unto I have formerly mentioned ’sop's Fables or some such other book of pleasant stories to draw him on with delight in reading I now add that if it be possible you should get it with pictures which will in a temper like his (that if I mistake not is much more pleased with things than names) make the learning of characters and words go down much easier when he sees there is some use of it and that the knowledge of beasts and birds and such other things comes along with it those visible objects children heard talked of in vain and without any satisfaction whilst thet have no ideas of them If therfore ’sop's Fables or some such other book cannot be got with pictures yet at least get him what picturs of animals you can with the names of them which at the same time will encourage him to read and afford him matter of enquiry and knowledge If you find it with difficulty to meet with such a tutor as we desire I do not at all wonder I can only say spare no care nor cost to get such an one All things are to be had that way and I dare assure you that if you get a good one you will never repent the charge but you will always have the satisfaction to think it the money of all others the best laid out But be sure take nobody upon friends or charitable no nor great commendations Inform yourselves throughly whether he be for your purpose and when you find him every way so get him at any rate But whether he be such an one as I have formerly mentioned and your design will need you alone can judge nor will the reputation of a sober man with learning enough (which with others is all usually that is required in a tutor) serve your turn In this choice be as curious as you would be in that of a wife for him For you must not think of trial or changing afterwards that will cause great inconvenience to you and greater to him When I consider the scruples and cautions I here lay in your way methinks it looks as if I advised you to something which I would have you offer at but in effect not do but you know how much I am in earnest in this point only you will understand me aright if you think it a business you ought to be very nice in When you have pitched on one after having had him awhile with you tell me what kind of a man he is I will then the best I can tell you what kind of use you are to make of him As to the business with Stratton I have nothing to say but leave it wholly to your judgment for so as you determine I know it will be well Present my humble service to Madam and tell her I am glad the little ones follow so well the footsteps of their mother that they begin to have a reputation so early I wish her and them health that she may long enjoy that growing satisfaction I wish you with them all happiness and am Sir your most humble servant J L {John_Locke 15th march
