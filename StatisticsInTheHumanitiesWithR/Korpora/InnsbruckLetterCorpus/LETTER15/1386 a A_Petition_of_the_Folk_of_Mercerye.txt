To the moost noble and Worthiest Lordes moost ryghtful and wysest conseille to owre lige Lorde the Kyng compleynen if it lyke to yow the folk of the Mercerye of London as a membre of the same citee of many wronges subtiles and also open oppressions ydo to hem by longe tyme here bifore passed Of which oon was where the eleccion of Mairaltee is to be to the fre men of the Citee bi gode and paisible auys of the wysest and trewest at o day in the yere frelich there nought-withstondyng the same fredam or fraunchise Nichol Brembre wyth his vpberers purposed hym the yere next after John Northampton Mair of the same Citee with stronge honde as it is ful knowen and thourgh debate and strenger partye ayeins the pees bifore purueyde was chosen Mair in destruccion of many ryght For in the same yere the forsaid Nichol with-outen nede ayein the pees made dyuerse enarmynges bi day and eke bi nyght and destruyd the kynges trewe lyges som with open slaughtre some bi false emprisonenment¨ and some fledde the Citee for feere as it is openlich knowen And so ferthermore for to susteyne thise wronges and many othere the next yere after the same Nichol ayeins the forsaide fredam and trewe comunes did crye openlich that no man sholde come to chese her Mair but such as were sompned and tho that were sompned were of his ordynaunce and after his auys And in the nyght next after folwynge he did carye grete quantitee of Armure to the Guyldehalle with which as wel straungers of the contree as othere of with-jnne were armed on the morwe ayeins his owne proclamacion that was such that no man shulde be armed and certein busshment¨ were laide that when free men of the Citee come to chese her Mair breken vp armed cryinge with loude voice sle! sle! folwyng hem wherthourgh the peple for feere fledde to houses and other hidynges as in londe of werre adradde to be ded in comune And thus yet hiderward hath the Mairaltee ben holden as it were of conquest or maistrye and many othere offices als So that what man pryue or apert in special that he myght wyte grocchyng pleyned or helde ayeins any of his wronges or bi puttyng forth of whom so it were were it neuer so vnpreuable were apeched and it were displesyng to hym Nichol anon was emprisoned And though it were ayeins falshede of the leest officer that hym lust meynteigne was holden vntrewe lige man of owre kyng for who reproued such an officer maynteigned bi hym of wronge or elles he forfaited ayeins hym Nichol and he vnworthy as he saide represented the kynges estat Also if any man bi cause of seruyce or other leueful comaundement approched a lorde to which lorde he Nichol dradde his falshede to be knowe to anon was apeched that he was false to the conseille of the Citee and so to the kyng And yif in general his falsenesse were ayeinsaide as of vs togydre of the Mercerye or othere craftes or ony conseille wolde haue taken to ayeinstande it or as tyme out of mynde hath be vsed wolden companye togydre how lawful so it were for owre nede or profite were anon apeched for arrysers ayeins the pees and falsly many of vs that yet stonden endited And we ben openlich disclaundred holden vntrewe and traitours to owre Kyng for the same Nichol sayd bifor Mair Aldermen and owre craft bifor hem gadred in place of recorde that xx or xxx of vs were worthy to be drawen and hanged the which thyng lyke to yowre worthy lordship by an euen Juge to be proued or disproued the whether that trowthe may shewe for trouthe amonges vs to fewe or elles no man many day dorst be shewed And nought oonlich vnshewed or hidde it hath be by man now but also of bifore tyme the moost profitable poyntes of trewe gouernaunce of the Citee compiled togidre bi longe labour of discrete and wyse men wyth-out conseille of trewe men for thei sholde nought be knowen ne contynued in the tyme of Nichol Exton Mair outerliche were brent And so ferforth falsehede hath be vsed that of tyme he Nichol Brembre saide in sustenaunce of his falshede owre lige lordes wille was such that neuer was such as we suppose He saide also whan he hadde disclaundred vs which of us wolde yelde hym false to his kyng the kyng sholde do hym grace cherise hym and be good lorde to hym And if any of vs alle that wyth goddes help haue and shulle be founden trewe was so hardy to profre prouyng of hym self trewe anon was comaunded to prisone as wel bi the Mair that now is as of hym Nichol Brembre bifore Also we haue be comaunded oft tyme vp owre ligeaunce to vnnedeful and vnleueful dyuerse doynges And also to wythdrawe vs bi the same comaundement fro thynges nedeful and lefful as was shewed whan a companye of gode women there men dorst nought trauailleden barfote to owre lige lorde to seche grace of hym for trewe men as they supposed for thanne were such
