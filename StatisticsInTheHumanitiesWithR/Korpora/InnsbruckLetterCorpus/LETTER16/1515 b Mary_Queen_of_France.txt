Most reverend father in God I recommend me unto you heartily and I thank you for the great kindness that I have evermore found in you My lord I thank you also for your loving letters which you have sent me as hither to my great comfort and in especial for them which you have sent me now of late My lord you remember I doubt not that at my last being at Guildford you desired the king my brother to give unto my trusty and well beloved almoner doctor Denton the prebend in St Stephens which as then the dean of his chapel and now bishop of Lincoln had in possession as then the king's grace shewed me in your presence that he should have it and also you promised me the same and to solicit the king my brother for the performance of his promise Nevertheless I am credibly informed that my almoner is disappointed of the said prebend and that your chaplain hath it of the which I marvel greatly forasmuch as my said almoner hath done me good service in this country to the great honour of the king my brother and mine also and that the promise was made undesired of my behalf for you were the person that only moved the king to give it unto my almmoner and I am assured that his grace would not have varied without he had been persuaded to the contrary My lord forasmuch as I see you benevolent unto me in all my matters and ever hath been since our first acquaintance and now especially I pray you therefore to do so much at mine instance and request to desire your chaplain to resign the said prebend to the behoof and use of my said almoner and I promise you that I will not cease unto (until) I have gotten some promotion of the king my brother or else of some other person for your said chaplain which I trust shall be worth double the value of Saint Stephen's and besides that I shall help that he may have the next prebend hereafter in Saint Stephen's I pray you my lord send me word of your mind and that there be none excuse made for I assure you my lord my promise shall be without any excuse if God send me life I perform as knoweth his grace Amen From Paris the 18th day of February By your loving friend MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE To the most reverend father in God the Archbishop of York
