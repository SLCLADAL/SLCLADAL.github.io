Mr secretary I cam hether to the Hay uppon Monday last whear I was very honorably receaved all the states being assem bled together for that purpose to make as much shew as they could devyse of their good wylles to hir majesty as in many ora tions pagentes and such lyke was expressed besyde the people with great joye cryed  God save the quene God save the quene  in every place of the stretes as I passed The next day all the hole states generall cam to me and ther openly ageyn ther chauncelor Leonius (some call him Longonius) made a longe oratyon in thankes and prayses to the quenes ma jesty for hir great clemency bounty and goodnes shewyd to these porre aflycted countreys attrybuting all their good and hap pines under God to hir majesty only As sone as he had donn than cam comyssioners from partyculer provinces as from Utrycht Geldars and Fresland besides sondry spetyall towens as Anster dam Leydon Auchuson and others all which must nedes use ther gratulacion with oratyons as the other dede and much to the same effect all with thankes and prayse to hir majesty At all this cerymony doing was ther a French secretary sent hether v or vj days before with lettres from the king He sayd yt was about merchantes matters but in dede contrary only to have impeached yf he could this bynding themselves to hir majesty as they doe But the states gave him no audyence all the while alleaging they were occupied about the servyce of the quene of Englond which they wold dyspach before all princes in the world This fellow being present at all this solemne dealing with me tooke yt in such snuffe as he came prowdly to the states and offred his letters saing Now I trust you have donn all your sacrafyces to the quene of Englond and may yeld me some ley sure to rede my masters letters  They so shooke him upp and with such termes naming hir majesty in skorn as they tooke yt as they hurld him his letters and bidd him content himself they wold first dischardge all the least dewtyes whatsoever to hir majesty before they wold hear him So they have every day synce sett about the contract with hir majesty spetyally how to gyve me answere for hir full satysfaction touching ther abyllytye to maynteyn ther warrs whearin I hear credybly hir majesty shalbe well satysfied and further then any of us looked for And both roundlye and frankley they goe to worke that ye shall se they wyll doe indede more than ever they promysed considering her majesties denyall of the souerauntye and name of protector For they meane and must doe it for the hole people wyll have yt that hir majesty shall have in hir handes the hole bestowing aswell of ther money and contrybucions as of ther men of warr and the desire no longer hir good favour to them than they shall deall in all sincerytye with hir Wherein yt apperes that all the comyssioners have wonderfully sett fourth her majesty to them all here and Paull Buys hath donn his parte thorowly so hath Walk also And all thinges alredy are carried on with the most unyversall obedyence of hir majestys name that ever I sawe And flatly yt apperes now they wyll no other authorytye but under hir majesty nor that heir treasure nor lyves shalbe at the dys posing of any but hir majesty which yf you saw that we se here ye would wonder at what these people doe and ar able to doe and yf god had not moved hir majesty to send when she dyd the prince of Parma had byn by this tyme in the best and greatest tounes they have but ye sahll hear others in this and not me And as I wrote before how hir majestyes dealinges here ar alredy blowen into Germany so this day the elector brought me letters agayn newly com there whereby they wryte most honor ably of hir majesty and the duke of Sax geues much better eye than he did synce his wyfes death and lyke to marry ageyn with the hows of Hanalt a great protestant and a great howse He hath sent to speak with Seiguro and very lyke to joyn with the other princes who ar agreed not only to send a messenger to the French king but to lett him now that they will com to the ayd of the king of Navare who ys most iniuiously delt withall by the practyce of the pope and king of Spayn The ellector vowede to me that they have donn more in these causes within this xx dayes synce they understood of her majesties resolucyon agaynst the king of Spayn aswell by Sir Francis Drakes going into the indyes as her sending into these countreys than they have don this x yeres or wold have don this twelmonths yet God send hir majesty to think of his mercyfull dealinges accordingly The king of Denmark also hath joyned and encouraged greatly these princes Hit ys told me by the elector that dyvers of them meane to send hether to me to contragulate hir majestyes gra cious doings toward his countrey I have no other nuesytull these states have fully ended ther consultacions which wylbe to morrow as I hear and wholy with out contradyctyon to be at the devotyon and dispocyon of hir majesty absolutly Of this ye shall hear as sone as I shall know ther further answere Two of our men of warr of Flushing hath taken ij Dunkirk men one sonk and drouned all the souldyers and maryners Thus fare ye well sir this last of December Your assured frend R Leycester Hit ys sayd that the princes ar resolvyd to entreate Cassymere to be generall and shall have xxv=m= men levyed by the princes to goe
