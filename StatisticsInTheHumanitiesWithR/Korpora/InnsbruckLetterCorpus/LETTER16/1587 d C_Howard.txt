Sir I most humbly thank you for your letters I cannot tell what to think of my brother Stafford's advertisement for if it be true that the King of Spain's forces be dissolved I would not wish the Queen's Majesty to be at this charges that she is at but if it be but a device knowing that a little thing maketh us too careless then I know not what may come of it But this I am sure of if her Majesty would have spent but a 1 000 crowns to have had some intelligence it would have saved her twenty times as much Assure yourself he knoweth what we do here and if the army be or do dissolve it is the preparation that her Majesty hath made that is the cause for he cannot abide this heat that is provided for him He did never think that he would thus have provided for his coming but that the number of false alarums that he hath given her Majesty would have made her to have taken no alarum and so to have had the vantage and the chopping up of his friends here I am sure he doth not like and if they be up I wish they should continue so till there be a good peace which I pray to God to send us Sir if your next advertisements do assure the dissolving of the army in Spain then it were good we did so here yet if the Duke of Parma continue his and that there be any doubt of anything intended for Scotland put but three or four more ships to them in the Narrow Seas and I dare assure you it shall beat any power he shall be able to make and impeach him of any attempt in Scotland and I will take upon me the service myself for I assure you it doth grieve me to see her majesty at more charges than is needful and this charge will not be great I would fain keep the Narrow Seas three or four months I persuade myself I shall do some service Upon your next advertisement as the cause upon that shall require I will write to you Sir my good friend my opinion and then you may use it as you shall think best And so I pray you to write me frankly for I do assure you I will take it kindly and friendly at your hands and think myself much beholden unto you for it for I may sometimes upon a good conceit in my opinion make such a journey as I did now to Harwich and yet it may not be so well taken there but I know no cause why it should be but well taken I do assure you on my honour it cost not the Queen's Majesty one halfpenny nor shall not when I make any such journey I will rather spend myself one hundred pounds than to spend her one penny Thus good Mr Secretary I am bold with you as my special good friend and so bid you most heartily farewell and God send you health and strength From the Bear the 24th of January Your assured loving friend to use C Howard
