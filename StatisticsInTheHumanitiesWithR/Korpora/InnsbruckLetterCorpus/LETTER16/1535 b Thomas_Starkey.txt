Syr You wrote before in our pryncys cause of your owne mecyon wherin you schowyd louyngly the daungerys that myght of hys cause folow but the mater hyt selfe as hyt ys here by the kyng most scharply jugyd you dyd not almost touche Wherfor now the kyng as I haue wryt requyryth your lernyd Iugement and that you schold leue your prudent and wytty pollycy tyl you be requyryd The poyntes be thes wych though you ryght wel of your selfe know yet I wyl put them a lytyl aftur my mynd before your yes  An matrimonium cum relicta fratris ab eo cognita sit iure divino licitum In thys and the rest also though the kyngys plesure be you schold gyue place to no mannys persuasyon nor authoryte as I am sure you wyl not yet for the loye that I bere vn to you and for the desyre that I haue that you schold se the Iugyd truth I wyl note certayn placys of weyght aftur myn opynyon in thes thyngys to be consyderyd euer leuyng your owne jugement fre  And fyrst for thys poynt consydur how thys law ys rotyd in nature pondur hyt by thys rule yf hyt seme to you gude al thyng wych byndyth man to the obseruatyon therof al law wryten put asyde for the conseruatyon of the cyuyle polytyke lyfe vnyuer sally conuenyent to the dygyte of the nature of man al such I thynke ys rotyd in the law of nature Apply thys rule wythout affectyon and wyth a ryght ye examine hyt in thys case And then for the second poynt an lyceat dispensare esy I thynke hyt schal be to fynd the popys powar extendyth not therto And though hyt were expedyent for the wordly pollycy for to haue dis pensatyon as hyt was perauenture in the kyngys cause yet hyt ys not expedyent any one man to haue such powar to breke such Law so rotyd in nature and apon thys ground hyt apperyth to me ferther that the pope schold not haue powar not only to dyspense wyth any law so rotyd in nature but also that he hath not powar (nor conuenyent hyt ys that he schold haue) ye though he were made hede of the church powar to dyspense wyth lawys made in general conseyl catholike lawys and vnyuersal groundys ordeyned for the conseruacyon of chrystyan lyfe in al chrystys churche and though he hathe vsyd the contrary hyt was I thynke a mysvse and vsurpyd by the reson wherof now hyt ys spyd now hyt doth fal now hyt ys plukkyd iustely away Loke also and pondur thys whether euer the hole authoryte of makyng of abrogatyng of dyspensyng wyth catholyke lawys and vniuersal groundys of chrystian lyuyng were euer gyuen and trans latyd to the pope by any law wryten in general conseyl wych were necessary to fynd yf we schold attrybute such authoryte as to the emperourys we fynd legem regiam qua potestas senatus and populi erat in principem collata  The second pryncypal mater an superioritas quam multis in seculis romanus pontifex sibi vindicauit sit ex iure diuino Here you must way the placys of the gospel and scripture wherin I thynke you schal fynd non manyfestly prouyng that the commyn placys you know how y=t= they are vnderstood contrary therby dyuerse and many as when the dyscypelys of chryste contendyd for superiorite you know what chryst sayd you know how poule confessyth he knoyeth only christ for heed cyuyle and polytyke hedys he confessyd many sed iure diuino nullum Ferther loke to the begynnyng of the church when the truth therof was bettur knowen than hyt ys nowe In the actys of the apostylys you schal fynd no such thyng and aftur the apostylys days the iiij patriarchys of Jerusalem of Antioch of Constanti nople of rome had among them no superiorite  Loke ferther how the grekys fele from the church catholyke as we cal now chefely for bycause the byschope of rome wold be chefe hede you know what ys to be gyuen to the jugement of the grekys in the interpretatyon of scripture bettur than I dow The contentyon betwyx Petur and Poule takyth away such superi oryte as ys gyuen to the successorys of Petur Pondur why more from the byschope of Antyoche than of Rome such superiorite ys taken a way seyng Petur was byschope of bothe  Thes certayn poyntys I now wryte to you non quia preiudicium aliquod afferrent the kyngys plesure ys that you schold wythout any preiudicial affectyon taken of any man apon one parte or other wyth a sincere mynd and wyth that lyght that god hath gyuen you in scripturys and lernyng gyue your sentence And as touchyng the pollycy of bothe the materys and of bryngyn

reame or no leue that asyde only schow you whether yf the fyrst matrymony were to make whether you wold approue that then or no and the cause why you wold not and thus wey the thyng in hyt selfe as hyt ys in hys owne nature and put a parte feare of al daungerys hope of al gud wych schold succede and hangyth apon worldy pollycy and so clerely wythout affectyon other of kyng or quene breuely gyue

promotyon and profyt to your selfe dyssymbul wyth hym in thes grete and weyghty causys Thus you haue my mynd and the kyngys plesure withal and yf case be that you reche to the jugyd truth you nede not
