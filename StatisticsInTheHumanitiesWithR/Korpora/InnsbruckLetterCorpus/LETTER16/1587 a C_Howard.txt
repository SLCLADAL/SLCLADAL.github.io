My very good Lord I now remain aboard the Bear and as yet the provisions for the ships could not be taken all in by reason of the weather which hath been so tempestuous as that no boats could lie aboard them to put in the same yet I hope that within two or three days all things will be in a readiness Here is a very sufficient and able company of sailors as ever were seen and because their long journeys out of all places of this realm and this bad season makes them unprovided of apparel and such necessaries it were good for their relief to pay them one month's wages before hand Many great charges extraordinary hath grown this quarter which I could hardly have believed unless with mine own eyes and good examination I had seen Wherefore in respect of those causes and for the furtherance of service I am to entreat your good Lordship to give order that the rest of the warrant lately granted for the whole navy may be paid to Mr Hawkyns and 2 000l more upon the old warrant of 29 000l for the furnishing of those extra ordinary charges wherein your Lordship shall further a good service We have entered into sea victuals this day being the 22nd of this instant December and not before for the preserving of the six weeks' victuals And Mr Quarles hath sent down divers supplies more than allowance for the numbers were great before we entered into the six weeks' victuals Wherefore I pray your Lordship that he may be paid the rest of his allowed warrant and that consideration for the rest which I spake to your Lordship for heretofore And so I bid your good lordship most heartily fare well From aboard the Bear the 22d of December 1587 Your Lordship's most assured loving friend to command C Howard
