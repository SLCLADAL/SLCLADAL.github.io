Most Honourable The army of Spain I think certainly to be put either with Norway or Denmark There are divers causes which moveth me so to think The first we understand by divers prisoners which we have taken that generally through all their whole fleet there was no one ship free of sick people Secondly their ships masts sails and ropes were very much decayed and spoiled by our great shot Thirdly at Calais by fire we forced them to cut many of their cables whereby they lost many of their anchors which of necessity they must seek to supply Further if they had had none of these former great causes of distress yet the winds and storm with the wind westerly as it was hath forced them thither And I assure myself that whensoever her Majesty shall hear of their arrival in any of these coasts that her Highness shall be advertised both of their great distress and of no small loss amongst them for I assure your Honour her Majesty's good ships felt much of that storm and lost many of their boats and pinnaces with some anchors and cables yet were we fair by our own shore and the wind right off the land Some amongst us will not let to say that they are in Scotland I cannot think so for that we had no wind whereby they were able to recover any place of the mainland of Scotland without it were some of the out isles which are no meet places to relieve their so many great wants Norway or the out isles of Scotland can relieve them but with water and a few cows or bad beef and some small quantity of goats and hens which is to them as nothing And yet these bad reliefs are to be had but in few places and their roads dangerous The only thing which is to be looked for is that if they should go to the King of Denmark and there have his friendship and help for all their re liefs none can better help their wants in all these parts than he for that he is a Prince of great shipping and can best supply his wants which now the Duke of Medina the Sidonia standeth in need of as great anchors cables masts ropes and victuals and what the King of Spain's hot crowns will do in cold countries for mariners and men I leave to your good Lordship which can best judge thereof We left a pinnace of her Majesty's the Advice and a fine caravel of my own to attend the fleet of Spain when we left them but what is become of them in that great storm or whether they may be stayed in any other country as they may I know not My poor opinion is that it were most meet to send a good ship and some fine bark with some very sufficient person to deal effectually from her Majesty with the King of Denmark as he shall find the cause to require and to send the true report back with all speed possible that they may be the better prevented for no doubt but that which they are able to do they will presently put it in execution The winter will overtake them else in those parts If they stay in the sound this winter I hope many of the Spaniards will seek Spain by land The Prince of Parma I take him to be as a bear robbed of her whelps and no doubt but being so great a soldier as he is that he will presently if he may undertake some great matter for his rest will stand now thereupon It is for certain that the Duke of sidonia standeth somewhat jealous of him and the Spaniards begin to hate him their honour being touched so near many of their lives spent I assure your Honour not so little as five thousand men less than when first we saw them near Ply mouth divers of their ships sunk and taken and they have nothing to say for themselves in excuse but that they came to the place appointed which was at Calais and there stayed the Duke of Parma's coming above 24 hours yea and until they were fired thence So this is my poor conclusion If we may re cover near Dunkirk this night or to morrow morn ing so as their power may see us returned from the chase and ready to encounter them if they once sally that the next news you shall hear will be the one to mutiny against the other which when that shall come to pass or whether they mutiny or no let us all with one consent both high and low magnify and praise our most gracious and merciful God for his infinite and unspeakable goodness to wards us which I protest to your good Lordships that my belief is that our most gracious Sovereign her poor subjects and the Church of God hath opened the heavens in divers places and pierced the ears of our most merciful father unto whom in Christ Jesu be all honour and glory so be it Amen Amen Written with much haste for that we are ready to set sail to prevent the Duke of Parma this southerly wind if it please God for truly my poor opinion is that we should have a great eye unto him From her Majesty's very good ship the Revenge this 10th of August 1588 Your Honour's faithfully to be commanded always FRA DRAKE For that we were very near to set sail I most humbly beseech your Honour to pardon my pen for that I am forced to write the very copy of that letter which I have sent to my Lord Chancellor Since the writing hereof I have spoken with an English man which came from Dunkirk yesterday who saith upon his life there is no fear of the fleet Yet would I willingly see it Your Honour's ever FRA DRAKE
