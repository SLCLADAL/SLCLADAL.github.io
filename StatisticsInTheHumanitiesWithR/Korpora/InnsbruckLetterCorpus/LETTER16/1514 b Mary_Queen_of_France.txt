My most kind and loving brother I recommend me unto your grace as heartily as I can and I thank your grace for your kind letters and for your good counsel the which I trust to our Lord God I shall follow every day more and more How lovingly the king my husband dealeth with me the lord chamberlain with other of your ambas sadors can clearly inform your grace whom I beseech your grace heartily to thank for their great labours and pains that they have taken as here for me for I trust they have made a substantial and a perfect end As touching mine almoner I thank your grace for him Of his demeanour here your grace shall be informed better than I can write as knoweth our Lord Jesu who preserve your grace Amen From Paris the 15th day of November by your loving sister Mary To the King my brother
