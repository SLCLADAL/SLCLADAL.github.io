Gentlemen my very worthy friends Since my last the Bill for wearing of Woollen hath been read the third time past and sent up to the Lords Also the Bill for continuing the new Impost upon Wines and Vinegars hath been read the first time There was moreover a Bill brought in to day and once read for supplying certain defects in the French Prohibition explaining the ships to be subject to seisure which fraudently put in to ports & ly there without apparent necessity and making the Informers part more certain and easy to come by &c They sent also by some of their members to a Conference with the Lords about the Disbanding Bill a Provisio w ch they desired might in lieu of the Lords Amendments be added to the Bill whereby in case any part of the Army can not be disbanded by the last of this Moneth there may be more time allowed so that the whole do not exceed the Terms in the Bill above 30 dayes I heare that the Lords are likely although it comes so neare to their own sense yet to disagree in it The House of Commons haue both to day and yesterday been in Committee about the way of raising the other Monyes After severall debates concerning 200000 li to be raisd on the new foundations since 1656 within ten miles of London of making a second Act for Review of the Poll bill of laying a further Tax upon Land the House hath at last Resolved (Agreeing with the Committee) that the 414000 li and no more shall be raised by the old way of Subsidy And they have appointed to goe againe to morrow into Committee in order to the further consideration of that method & toward prepareing the Bill for that purpose I remaine Gentlemen &c Your most affectionate servant Andr Marvell June 25 78
