therin yit sith your Grace hath had a politique foresight to the provision of the vitail which is the grettest thing that his Grace regardeth his pleasure is according to your moost prudent advice that for to put the mater in the more surtie the said twoo shippis shall in eny wise goo forth and that they shall there continue till halfe the moneth of Septembre be passed after which tyme his

th'Emperors Embassiator vppon the saufconduicte For his Grace thinketh it a great hinderaunce to the comen affeires that th'Em peror shold graunt eny such saufconduicte wherby there shold be eny mutuall entrecors bitwen his subgiettis and theyre comen enemyes and the commoditees of Fraunce having vent and vtter aunce thenemy therby the bettre furnyshed of mony shold be the more able the lenger to mayntayn the warre And so shall hit be the lenger ere he shall incline to eny resonable conditions of peace Wherfore his Grace for his part according to your Gracis politique advice is as yit in mynd neither to ratifie that saufcon duicte nor to graunt eny lyke and is glad that your Grace so shewed vn to th'Emperors embassiator Hit may ferther lyke your good Grace to be aduertised that one Thomas Murner a Frere of Saynt Francisce order which wrote a boke agaynst Luther in defence of the Kingis boke was owte of Almaigne sent in to England by the meane of a simple person an Almaigne namyng hym selfe seruant un to the Kingis Grace and affermyng vn to murner that the King had gevyn hym in charge to desire Murner to cum over to hym into England and by thoccasion therof he is cummen over and hath now bene here a good while Wherfore the Kingis Grace pitiyng that he was so deceived and having tendre respecte to the good zele that he bereth toward the Feith and his good hart and mynd toward his Highnes requyreth your Grace that it may lyke you to cause hym haue in reward one hundred pownde and that he may retourne home wher his presence is very necessary ffor he is one of the chiefe stays agaynst the faction of Luther in that parties agaynst whom he hath wrytten many bokis in the Al mayng tong and now sith his cummyng hither he hath translated in to Latyn the boke that he byfore made in Almaigne in defence of the Kingis boke He is Doctor of Divinite and of bothe Lawis and a man for wryting and preching of great estimation in his cuntre Hit may lyke your Grace ferther to wite that the same simple person which caused Murner to cum in to England is now cum men to the Cort and hath brought with hym a barons son of Almaygne to whom he hath also persuaded that the Kingis Grace wold be glad to haue hym in his service He hath also brought lettres from Duke Ferdinand vn to the Kingis Grace which lettres I send vn to your Grace wherin he desireth the Kingis Highnes to take in to his service and to reteyne with some convenient yerely pention Ducem Mechelburgensem of which request the Kingis Grace greatly merveileth and veryly thinketh that this simple felow which brought the lettres lykewise as he caused Murner to cum hither and persuaded the barons sone that the King wold be glad to haue his service so hath by some simple ways brought the Duke of Mechelborough in the mynd that the Kingis Grace wold at the comtemplatione of Duke Ferdinandis lettres be content to reteign the Duke of Mechelborough with a verly pention The felow hath brought also fro the Duke of Mechelborough lettres of credence written in the Duche tong He bare hym selfe in Almaygne for the Kingis seruant and bosted that he had a yerely pention of his Grace of fiftie markis and that the King had sent hym thither to take vpp seruantz for hym And now he saith he is servaunt vn to th'Emperors Mageste and is going in to Spaigne with lettres to hym and in dede he hath diverse lettres to his Magestie and so was it easie for hym to gete if he entend to deceive and mocke as the Kingis Grace thinketh that he doth For his Grace never saw hym byfore but he vnderstandeth now that byfore this tym he was in England whan th'Emperor was here and slew a man and escaped his way Wherfor his Grace requyreth yours to geve hym your prudent advice as well in a convenient answere to be made both to Duke Ferdinand and the Duke of Mechelborough as also in what wise hit shalbe convenient to ordre this simple fellow that so hath deceived menne in the Kingis name Ferthermore hit may lyke
