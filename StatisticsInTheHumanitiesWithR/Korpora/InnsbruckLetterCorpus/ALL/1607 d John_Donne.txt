To Sir Henry Goodyer This Tuesday Morning which hath brought me to London presents me with all your letters Methought it was a rent day I mean such as yours and not as mine and yet such too when I considered how much I owed you for them how good a mother how fertile and abundant the understanding is if she have a good father and how well friendship performs that office For that which is denied in other generations is done in this of yours for here is superfetation child upon child and that which is more strange twins at a latter conception If in my second religion friendship I had a con_science either errantem to mistake good and bad and indif_ferent or opinantem to be ravished by other's opinions or examples or dubiam to adhere to neither part or crupu_losam to incline to one but upon reasons light in them_selves or undiscussed in me (which are almost all the diseases of conscience) I might mistake your often long and busy letters and fear you did but entreat me to have mercy upon you and spare you for you know our Court took the resolution that it was the best way to despatch the French Prince back again quickly to receive him solemnly ceremoniously and expensively when he hoped a domestic and durable entertainment I never meant to excel you in weight nor price but in number and bulk I thought I might because he may cast up a greater sum who hath but forty small monies than he with twenty Portugueses The memory of friends (I mean only for letters) neither enters ordinarily into busied men because they are ever employed within nor into men of pleasure because they are never at home For these wishes therefore which you won out of your pleasure and recrea_tion you were as excusable to me if you write seldom as Sir H Wotton is under the oppression of business or the necessity of seeming so or more than he because I hope you have both pleasure and business only to me who have neither this omission were sin for though writing be not of the precepts of friendship but of the counsels yet as in some cases to some men counsels become precepts and though not immediately from God yet very roundly and quickly from His Church (as selling and dividing goods in the first time continence in the Roman Church and order in decency in ours) so to me who can do nothing else it seems to bind my conscience to write and it is sin to do against the conscience though that err Yet no man's letters might be better wanted than mine since my whole letter is nothing else but a confession that I should and would write I owed you a letter in verse before by mine own promise and now that you think that you have hedged in that debt by a greater by your letter in verse I think it now most seasonable and fashion_able for me to break At least to write presently were to accuse myself of not having read yours so often as such a letter deserves from you to me To make my debt greater (for such is the desire of all who cannot or mean not to pay) I pray read these two problems for such light flashes as these have been my hawkings in my Surrey journeys I accompany them with another rag of verses worthy of that name for the small_ness and age for it hath long lain among my other papers and laughs at them that have adventured to you for I think till now you saw it not and neither you nor it should repent it Sir if I were anything my love to you might multiply it and dignify it but infinite nothings are but one such yet since even chimeras have some name and titles I am also Yours
