DEAR SIR Since my last I have gotten the abridgment which came to me in quires bound and gilded as the other was and accor_ding to your order have placed it in Sir walter's hands to be conveyed to mrs duke And the other which remains in marble paper I shall also send by him to Mr freke about a fortnight hence when he designs to go out of town if I have no other opportunity by a safe hand in the meantime to convey it to him I have also gotten you a good beaver hat made by the diameter of the inside of the crown of the band exactly according to the dimension marked by the two black pins in your letter of the ninth instant A peruke I have also bought for you pur_suant to your directions in the same letter as near as possible as I could And these together with six flannel shirts (bought and made up by your very good friend Mrs R S ) and a cloak which in the buying and making up I gave her my best assistance I have sent hence by your old friend Adrian who stayed but one day in town and is this day set out from hence towards you and it is possible may be with you as soon (or before) this can come to your hands He promised me to take particular care of them all and to see them safely delivered to you which I hope he will do they being all in my opinion extremely good of the kind and I believe will give content in the wearing By him you will also receive a letter that I had from Mr Stringer in answer to what by your order I writ to him touching your picture by which you will find that he is resolved not to part with it And I would by him also have sent to you a grant of your estate at Beluton and St Thomas to J N as you desire could I have gotten time during his stay here to have done it but now I think I must take a time by your directions and in your presence to do it which if God bless my wife with an happy lying in and no extraordinary business prevent my inclinations do very strongly prompt me to But since there are so many accidents which may contradict my intentions in this par_ticular I dare promise nothing but trust on Providence to send us a happy meeting which I earnestly desire and long for In the meantime give me leave to assure you that I will use all imaginable care and caution to find out the truth of what was done in that affair touching w p and my cousin that in your last you mentioned to me And I will also take care to get ’sop's Fables in Latin English and French with cuts as you have ordered and will wait your further directions for making the best use of them Just now I received the enclosed from my son with his earnest desires that in my next it might be conveyed to you It was in the shape of a letter directed to you but the back part of it for the conveniency of postage I took off and hope you will pardon both him and me for troubling you with it since you will there see what good effects the following of your methods in teaching the child to write as well as all other things hath already produced He begins to be sensible of the great kind_ness you have done him and I hope as he increases in know_ledge he will be no less grateful than him who by all manner of ties you have obliged to be never other than Your most affectionate faithful servant E {Clarke Madam gives her hearty service to you is very well but not yet laid and joins her desires with mine that you will send prints of those copies of which you have already given us a sight the caracter being much better (as I think) than any I can get here etc I have written again to Mr Elwill who hath repeated his promises under hand to me that he will take particular care to send the bags again to Mr Furley wherein the provision for the sheep was sent over etc
