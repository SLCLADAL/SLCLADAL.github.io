RIGHT HONOURABLE Under this date I write two letters unto you whereof the present is the latter and is written to correct the former For whereas in the same I advertised that an execution had been done upon certain mutinous persons of the Holland troops that had fortified themselves against the General on the shore of Dalmatia (which I took from the first voice) there is now (though I am sorry to express it) fresher advice come from the armata that those mutineers were English and of the late arrived under Sir Henry Peyton's conduct to the number of some 150 who demanded the same pay that the foresaid Hollanders had and made that the subject of their division To which the General made answer that he would stand to the contract concluded between the amabassador of this State and their conductor in England and therfore wished them to be quiet which they refusing he landed 200 Albanesi to reduce them by force against whom the English turned their pikes and their shot which the general perceiving he laid the prows of two of his galleys against them and so they yielded Barbarigo upon this forming their process did hang eight of them who are said to be captains lieutenants and corporals and that three of these did die in the Roman faith their names I yet know not which shall be advertised in my next God send the success fairer than the beginning To this I must add that by the letters of Milan arrived at this moment is intimated a secret conjunction between Fraunce and Savoy against the Genovese which if it proceed will inflame this whole country These be resolutions proper for the canicular days which are newly begun with us And so Sir wishing us the continuance of blessed peace at home I humbly rest At your commandments HENRY WOTTON
