Gentlemen my very worthy friends I forgot by reason of my hast to giue you account (what doubtlesse you haue known from other hands) that Sr Rob Sawyer hauing writ a Letter to M r Golsbrough Clerke of the Commons to be read signifying that he was by sicknesse disabled from performing his place and M r Secretary Williamson informing the House that his M ty gaue them leave to chuse a new Speaker M r Seymor was upon Munday last chosen Speaker & approved at the Lords bar by his M ty in the usuall manner To day the House hath not sate Yesterday in the morning they Adjourned early to giue their Committee time till three in the afternoon to forme their three Adresses It was fiue before they had finished and first they reported that concerning Duke Lauderdale The Debate indured till toward nine at night The House was twice divided 152 against 151 and then afterwards 161 against 157 whereby all the words of the whole Adresse were thrown but so that there remains nothing but their first naked vote And how they will dispose now of that is uncertaine for it being late the House Adjourned without coming to any further Resolution The apprehensions of the Hollanders closing up their Peace with France do still continue and rather increase then otherwise I am Gentlemen &c Your most affectionate servant Andr Marvell There was no counsell yesterday So the busines of Angels lights is for to morrow
