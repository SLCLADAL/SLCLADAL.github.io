The obligations and many instances of affection which I have received from your eminency do engage me to make returns suitable to your merits But al_though I have this set home upon my spirit I may not (shall I tell you I cannot?) at this juncture of time and as the face of my affairs now stands answer to your call for Toleration I say I cannot as to a public declaration of my sense in that point although I believe that under my government your eminency in the behalf of catholics has less reason for complaint as to rigour upon men's consciences than under the parliament For I have of some and those very many had compassion making a difference Truly I have (and I may speak it with cheerfulness in the presence of god who is a witness within me to the truth of what I affirm) made a differ_ence and as Jude speaks plucked many out of the fire the raging fire of persecution which did tyrannise over their consciences and encroached by an arbitrariness of power upon their estates And herein is my purpose as soon as I can remove impediments and some weights that press me down to make a farther progress and discharge my promise to your eminency in relation to that And now I shall come to return your Eminency thanks for your judicious choice of that person to whom you have entrusted our weightiest Affair an Affair wherein your Eminency is concerned though not in an equal degree and measure with myself I must confess that I had some doubts of its success till providence cleared them to me by the effects I was truly and to speak ingenuously not without doubtings and shall not be ashamed to give your eminency the grounds I had for much doubting I did fear that Berkley would not have been able to go through and carry on that work and that either the Duke would have cooled in his suit or condescended to his Brother I doubted also that those Instructions which I sent over with 290 were not clear enough as to expressions some affairs here denying me leisure at that time to be so particular as in regard to some circumstances I would If I am not mistaken in the Duke's character as I received it from your Eminency that fire which is kindled between them will not ask bellows to blow it and keep it burning But what I think farther necessary in this matter I will send to your Eminency by Lockhart and now I shall boast to your Eminency my se_curity upon a well builded confidence in the Lord for I distrust not but if this breach be widened a little more and this difference fomented with a little caution in respect of the persons to be added to it I distrust not but that Party which is already forsaken of God as to an outward dispensation of mercies and noisome to their countrymen will grow lower in the opinion of all the world If I have troubled your Eminency too long in this you may impute it to the resentment of joy which I have for the issue of this Affair and `I' will conclude with giving you assurance that I will never be back_ward in demonstrating as becomes your brother and confederate that I am Your servant Oliver P 
