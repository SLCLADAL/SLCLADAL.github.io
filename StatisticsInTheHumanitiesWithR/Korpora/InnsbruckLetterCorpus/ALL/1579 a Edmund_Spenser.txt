GOod Master G I perceiue by your most curteous and frendly Letters your good will to be no lesse in deed than I alwayes esteemed In recompence wherof think I beseech you that I wil spare neither speech nor wryting nor aught else whensoeuer and wheresoeuer occasion shal be offred me yea I will not stay till it be offred but will seeke it in al that possibly I may And that you may perceiue how much your Counsel in al things preuaileth with me and how altogither I am ruled and ouer ruled thereby I am now determined to alter mine owne former purpose and to subscribe to your aduizement beinge notwithstanding resolued stil to abide your farther resolution My principal doubts are these First I was minded for a while to haue inter mitted the vttering of my writings leaste by ouer much cloying their noble eares I should gather a contempt of my self or else seeme rather for gaine and commoditie to doe it for some sweetnesse that I haue already tasted Then also me seemeth the work too base for his excellent Lord ship being made in Honour of a priuate Personage unknowne which of some yl willers might be vpbraided not to be so worthie as you knowe she is or the matter not so weightie that it should be offred to so weightie a Personage or the like The selfe former Title stil liketh me well ynough and your fine Addition no lesse if these and the like doubtes maye be of importaunce in your seeming to frustrate anyparte of your aduice I beseeche you without the leaste selfe loue of your own purpose coun cell me for the beste and the rather doe it faithfullye and carefully for that in all things I attribute so much to your iudgement that I am euer more content to adnihilate mine own determinations in respecte thereof And indeede for your selfe to it sitteth with you now to call your wits and senses togither (which are alwaies at call) when occasion is so fairely offered of Estimation and Preferment For whiles the yron is hote it is good striking and minds of Nobles varie as their Estates Verum ne quid durins I pray you bethinke you well hereof good Maister G and fortwith write me those two or three special points and caueats for the nonce De quibus in superioribus illis mellitissimis longissimisque Litteris tuis Your desire to heare of my late beeing with hir Maiestie muste dye in it selfe As for the twoo worthy Gentlemen Master Sidney and Master Dyer they haue me I thanke them in some vse of familiarity of whom and to whome what speache passeth for youre credite and Estimation I leaue your selfe to conceiue hauing alwayes so well conceiued of my vnfained affection and zeale towardes you And nowe they haue pro claimed in their Title a generall surceasing and silence of balde Rymers and also of the verie beste to in steade whereof they haue by authoritie of their whole Senate prescribed certaine Lawes and rules of Quantities of English Sillables for English Verse hauing had thereof already greate practise and drawen mee to their faction Newe Bookes I heare of none but only of one that writing a certaine Booke called The Schoole of Abuse and dedicating it to Maister Sidney was for hys labor scorned if at leaste it be in the goodnesse of that nature to scorne Suche follie is it not to regarde aforehande the inclination and qualitie of him to whome wee dedicate our Bookes suche mighte I happily incurre entituling My Slomber and the other Pamphlets vnto his honor I meant them rather to Maister Dyer But I am of late more in loue wyth my Englishe Versifying than with ryming whyche I should haue done long since if I would then haue followed your councell Sed te solum iam tum suspicabur cum Aschamo sapere nunc Aulam video egre gios alere Poetas Anglicos Maister E K hartily desireth to be com mended vnto your Worshippe of whome

you Verutamen te solu`m sequar (vt saepenumero` sum pro fessus ) nunquam sane` assequar dum viuam And nowe requite I you with the like not with the verye beste but with the verye shortest namely with a few Iambickes I dare warrant they be precisely perfect for the feete (as you can easily iudge) and varie not one inch from the Rule I will imparte yours to Maister Sidney and Maister Dyer at my nexte going to the Courte I praye you keepe mine close to your selfe or your verie entire friendes Maister Preston Maister still and the reste Iambicum trimetrum VNhappie Verse the witnesse of my
