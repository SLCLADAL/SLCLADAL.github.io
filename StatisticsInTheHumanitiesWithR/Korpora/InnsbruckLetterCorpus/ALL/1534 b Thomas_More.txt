It may like your highnes to call to your gratious remembrance that at such tyme as of your great weightie roome of Chauncellourshipp (vnto the which farr aboue my merites your highnes of your incomparable goodnes exalted me vnto) you were so good and gratious vnto me as at my humble suite to disburden me (giuing me licence with your gratious favoure to bestow the residue of my life to come about the prouision of my soule in the seruice of god) It pleased your highnes further to say vnto me that for the seruice I had done that in any suite I should haue hereafter to your Grace that either should concerne myne honure or appertaine to my profitt (for these verie wordes it liked your high nes to vse to me) I should find your highnes my good and gratious Lord So it is now gratious Soueraigne that worldlie honoure is the thing whereof I haue resigned both the possession and the desire in the surrender of your honorable office and as for worldlie profitt I trust experience proveth and daylie more and more shall proue that I was never verie greedie thereof But now is my most humble suite to your excellent Highnes to beseech it somewhat to tender my poore honestie howbeit principalllie that of your accustomed goodnes no sinister information can otherwise moue your noble Grace to haue any mistrust of my troth and devotion towardes your maiestie then I haue or shall giue iust cause which I hope there is none For in this matter of the Nunne of Canturburie I haue vnto your trustie Counsellour maister Thomas Cromewell by my writing as plainely declared the truth as * I possiblelie * can which my declaration * as I vnderstand * is made knowne to your noble Grace Of all my dealinge with the Nunne whether any other man may paraduenture put any doubt or moue any scruple of any other meaning than I had that can I neither tell nor lieth in my hand to lett but vnto my selfe it is not possible anie part of my demeanour to seem euell And this the clereness of my conscience testifying that in that matter my mynde intent and proceeding was lawfull and good Wherfor most gratious Soueraigne I neither will nor yet can it well become me with your Highnes to reason or argue the matter but in most humble manner prostrate at your Graces feet I beseech your Maiestie with your owne high prudence and accustomed goodnes consider and weigh the matter And if that in your so doing your owne verteous minde shall giue you that notwith standinge your manifold goodnes that your Highnes hath vsed towardes me that I haue most vnnaturallie and vngratefullie digressed from my bounden dewtie of allegeance towardes your Maiestie then desire I no further fauour at your Graces handes then the losse of all I may Let me loose goodes landes libertie and finallie my life Howbeit if in the considering of my cause your high wisdome and gratious goodnes shall perceaue that I haue not otherwise demeaned my selfe then may well stand with my bounden dewtie and faith fullnes towardes your Royall Maiestie then in most humble manner I beseech your noble Grace that the knowledge of your true gratious persuasion in that behalfe may releeue the torment of my present heavines conceaued of the dread and feare (by that I heare a gre vous bill put vp by your learned Counsell vnto your high Court of Parliament against me) lest your Grace might by some sinister information be moued to thincke the contrarie Which if your highnes doe not (as I trust in god and your great goodnes the matter by your wisdome well examined you will not) then in most humble manner I beseech your highnes furthur sith your highnes hath here before of your meere abundant goodnes heaped on me both worship and honoure and sith now I haue left of all such things and nothinge seeke or desire but the life to come and to pray for your Grace the while that it may like your Highnes of your accustomed benignitie somwhat to tender my poor honestie and neuer to suffer any man by meane of such a bill to take occasion against the truthe to slaunder me although this by the perill of their owne soules would doe them more hurt then me for I settle my hart to depend vpon the comfort of the truth and the hope of heauen and not vpon the fallible opinion of some changeable persons And thus most dread and deare soueraigne Lord I beseeche the blessed Trinitie * preserue your noble Grace both bodie and soule and all that are your well willers and amend the contrarie emong whome if euer I be or ever haue bene one then I pray god that he may with my open shame and destruction declare it
