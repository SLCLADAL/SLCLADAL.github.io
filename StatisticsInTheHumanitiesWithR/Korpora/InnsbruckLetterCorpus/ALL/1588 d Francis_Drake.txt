Right Honourable The uncertainty of the reports which daily come unto us out of Calais Dunkirk Ostend Flushing from my Lord of Hun tingdon Scotland and such ships and pinnaces which have been sent out for discovery by my Lord Admiral make me rather to rest upon mine own conjecture than upon any of them they disagreeing so much as they do the one affirming that the Duke of Sidonia with his fleet is coming back again that the Duke of Parma is marching presently to embark to be conducted by him the other affirm ing that it is for certain that the fleet of Spain is past without Scotland for their way homewards Which reports are quite contrary My poor opinion is that if their fleet chance to return it is altogether for that the wind will not permit them good passage to go about the other way at this time of the year because it is most subject to westerly winds This wind that now bloweth if it be not more easterly there than it is here could hardly permit such a fleet for that they shall feel a great wind for to set sail to pass on the back side of Scotland and Ireland which may be the cause that of necessity they must be forced this way for Spain Farther my judgment is that the Duke of Sidonia with his fleet shall needs jump with fair weather the highest of a spring with good wind and the Duke of Parma embarKing all in one day This were very meet for them for if any one of these fail them they shall never perform as much as they have promised to the King their master My reason is this The most part of the ships of the Duke of Parma are small and being pestered with men of war must of necessity have fair weather and as I am credibly given to understand they must have a spring to bring their shipping both out of Dunkirk Nieuport and Sluys Now for the Duke of medina his fleet there is stir it requireth fair weather which when it happen that we should find there he is like God will ing to have unquiet rest And yet with my consent we ought much more to have regard unto the Duke of Parma and his soldiers than to the Duke of Sidonia and his ships for that our sands will take a strong party with us against his great ships under water My poor opinion is that the Duke of Parma should be vigilantly looked upon for these 20 days although the army of Spain return not this way for of them I have no great doubt although there be great cause for us all to watch carefully and defend mightily those many and proud enemies which seek to supplant the most honourable crown of England from our most gracious Sovereign whom God de fend as he hath most graciously done for his great mercy's sake I would advertise your Honour of some defects in her Majesty's army but that my very good Lord the Lord Admiral hath written unto your Honour thereof at large This is my poor opinion of her Majesty's army that the threatening of the enemy will put a great part of their weakness from her Majesty's good subjects and no doubt but they will fight valiantly although I find my Lord Admiral well affected when fair weather is to go for the coast of Flanders yet I would your Honour should animate us for ward for there are many causes that might move us to be there more than we are and much better for us and better service Thus humbly taking my leave of your Honour I rest desiring God to give us all grace to live in his fear so shall we not need greatly to fear the enemy From aboard her Majesty's very good ship the Revenge this 23rd of August 1588 Your Honour's most willing to be commanded FRA DRAKE I have sent to your Honour a copy Englished out of a letter sent from Don Pedro de Valdes to the their victualling and of some discontentment which was between the Duke and him Let me humbly beseech your Honour that we may be put in mind here that it were good we saw the coast of Flanders as often as we might I think it one of the best services we can have in hand It must be known I have written thus much to your Honour God bless us all and give us grace to fear his justice I crave pardon I have no time to read that which I have caused to be written Your Honour's faithfully FRA DRAKE
