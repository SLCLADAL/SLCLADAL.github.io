Dear Sir Soon after the writing of the 5th instant to you I was taken ill of a disease that of late has been almost universal in the town which fell into my eyes and disabled me for all manner of business for a considerable time But I can now inform you that I have spoken with Mr Oakley who tells me that he pursued Adrian's orders with a blind obedience in that affair relating to R B and by letter hath given you a particular account thereof But by his discourse I have reason to doubt that matter was not managed exactly pursuant to the method directed by you but all being over before my return to town I was therby altogether disabled from serving you in that affair as otherwise I should have done Mr Oakley goes not out of town until monday next but gives his service to you and desires to know if you have received his letter As to your affair with Mr Stringer touching your picture I have seriously considered all parts of it and without partiality do assure you that I cannot find anything blameable in any of your proceedings therein and therefore as opportunity serves I will use my utmost skill and interest to make Mr Stringer sensible thereof and put an end to the contest if it be to be done And what further I may be sensible to you in shall at all times be faithfully and willingly performed by Your most affectionate humble servant E {Clarke Your old friend Nath Hodges will be in town the latter end of this week and he shall have the only remaining abr‚g‚ delivered to him as you desire etc Mr Cheswell hath paid all home to Christmas last etc Madam and the young fry are well and give you their best service etc
