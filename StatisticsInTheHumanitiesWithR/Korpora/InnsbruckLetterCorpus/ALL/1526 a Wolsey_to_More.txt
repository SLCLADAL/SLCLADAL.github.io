MASTER MORE Albeit I am very joieuslx that my procedingis devises and conferencis with the Ambassadeurs haue been to the Kingis contentacion with th'Ambassadors in putting ouer without discoraging of the confederatis his Gracis entre in to the liege yet nowe I am in noo smal perplexite howe the same may be continued forasmoch as commissions and auctorites aswel from the Popes Holynes as from the Seniory of Venise be arrived here and howerly the Ambassador of Fraunce lokith for the semblable from his master For nowe if vpon the exhibition of the said commissions I shuld not fal in treaty with them vpon the kingis said entree there might therby be goven vnto them vehement cause of suspition which percase might dryve them the rather in to th'Emperors deuotion and the lesse herafter to esteme the Kingis Highnes Wherfor I purpose if it shal soo stand with the Kingis pleasure wherof I pray you I may be aduertysed by your next lettres after the French Kingis commission shalbe here arryuyd if they vehe mently presse me to begyne to commone with them vpon the Kingis said entre for the avoyding of the said suspition Howbeit aswel for the ordering of matiers bitwen vs and Fraunce as for the assuraunce of the Kingis pention with other thingis that I shal reasonably laye in the waye I dowte not soo to entrete the articules of this newe treatie that the tyme of doing any thing this yere shalbe wel passed or any conclusion may be taken therin in the same And in my poore opinion it shal more stande with the Kingis honnor and reputacion thus to procede with the said Ambassadors thenne not to treate with them considering they be furnished with such commissions as was or is devised and desired by the Kingis Highnes Better it shalbe thus to passe the tyme and dalye with them thenne nowe to make any expresse refusal eyther of the Kingis said entre or else to delay to commone and treate vpon the same nam inter tractandum varia occurrere et incidere possint que rem vt tua prudentia facile perspicit citra suspitionem differe et pro telare queant It is sumwhat to my marvel that the Kingis Hihgnes as I haue by myn other lettres signified vnto you makith difficulte for the lending of the Peter Pumgarnet to the Ambassador of Fraunce considering the manifold good desertis of the said Ambassador and the gret profit and commodite that shal arrise vnto his Grace therby And in my jugement it is not to be suspected or feared that she shall or may be used by the said Ambassador against the Kingis Highnes in any hostilite considering that the suerties shalbe bounde aswel for that point as for her rediliuerey at the yeres ende and then there is more lightlynes of strayter collection with Fraunce thenne of any brech And where as your lettres purpor tith that the Kingis Highnes may haue fyve hundred markis for the loone of the said ship besides the advauntage of his custumes of his owne subgettis and thereunto it is to be considered that the custumes of the straungers amountith far aboue the custumes of his owne subgettis Wherfor for oon hundred pownde payde by the Englishemen the straungers payith nyne hyndred Besides this I suppose if the King haue for the loone of her fyve hundred markis his Grace must newe rigge trymme and tacle her at his owne coste and charge which percase wol surmounte the somme of the said fyve hundred markis wher as the Ambassadour offrith to doo the same at his owne proper exspress cost and charge Moore thenne this I cannot saye remitting al to the Kingis noble pleasour and gratitude most humbly beseching his grace to haue consideration of such good office as the said ambassador hath and dayly may doo for the advauncement of his present affayres I sende unto the Kingis Highnes by my Lord of Exceter berer herof certain of the Crownes of the Roose as be newly stryken and coyned in the Kingis Mynte which be of like fynesse and poise as the Crowne Soleil and as ye doo knowe the same be proclamed to be curraunt after the rate of iiii s vi d apece I trust the facion of them shal please the Kingis Highnes You may shewe vnto his Grace that I wold suffre noon of them to passe out of his Mynte and be curraunt vnto such tyme as his Grace had seene the prynte and facion of the same and his pleasor noti fied vnto me therupon accordingly And where as you haue notified vnto me that the Kingis pleasor is that his Gracis aunswer to Luthers lettre shold be immediately sent forth to the princes of Almayne without abidiging or tarying for the copie therof I thinke therin that meseemeth it is not convenient that this shuld be doon in my poore opinion aswel for that Luther who is ful of sutelte and craft herafter might percase denye that any such lettre hath been sent by hym vnto the Kingis Highnes as that the said answer not having the said copy adioyned therunto shuld be for want therof to the reders and herers therof sumwhat diminute and obscure and not perfitely perceyved by them that shal rede the same
