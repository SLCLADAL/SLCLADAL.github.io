SIR I have seen your last Letter to Mr Secretary as also divers others and although I have no doubt either of your diligence or ability to serve us in so great a Business yet I am deeply sensible that the French are very much short with us in ingenuousness and performance And that which increaseth our sense `of this' is The resolution we `for our part' had rather to overdo than to be behindhand in anything of our Treaty And although we never were so foolish `as' to apprehend that the French and their interests were the same with ours in all things yet as to the Spaniard who hath been known in all ages to be the most im_placable enemy that France hath we never could doubt before we made our Treaty that going upon such grounds we should have been failed `towards' as we are! To talk of `giving us Garrisons' which are inland as Caution for future action to talk of `what will be done next Campaign ' are but parcels of words for children If they will give us Garrisons let them give us Calais Dieppe and Boulogne which I think they will do as soon as be honest in their words in giving us any one Spanish Garrison upon the coast into our hands! I positively think which I say to you they are afraid we should have any footing on that side `of the Water ' though spanish I pray you tell the Cardinal from me That I think if France desires to maintain its ground much more to get ground upon the Spaniard the performance of his Treaty with us will better do it than anything ap_pears yet to me of any Design he hath! Though we cannot so well pretend to soldiery as those that are with him yet we think that we being able by sea to strengthen and secure his Siege and `to' reinforce it as we please by sea and the Enemy `being' in capa_city to do nothing to relieve it the best time to besiege that Place will be now Especially if we con_sider that the French horse will be able so to ruin Flanders as that no succour can be brought to relieve the place and that the French Army and our own will have constant relief as far as England and France can give it without any manner of impediment especially considering the Dutch are now engaged so much to Southward as they are I desire you to let him know That Englishmen have had so good experience of Winter expeditions they are confident if the Spaniard shall keep the field As he cannot impede this work so neither will he be able to attack anything towards France with a pos_sibility of retreat And what do all delays signify but `even this ' The giving the Spaniard opportunity so much the more to reinforce himself and the keeping our men another Summer to serve the French with_out any colour of a reciprocal or any advantage to ourselves! And therefore if this will not be listened unto I desire that things may be considered of To give us satisfaction for the great expense we have been at with our Naval Forces and otherwise which out of an honourable and honest aim on our part hath been in_curred therby to answer the engagements we had made And `in fine ' That consideration may be had how our Men may be put into a position to be returned to us whom we hope we shall employ to a better purpose than to have them continue where they are I desire we may know what France saith and will do upon this point We shall be ready still as the Lord shall asssist us to perform what can be reasonably expected on our part And you may also let the Car_dinal know father That our intentions as they have been will be to do all the good offices we can to pro_mote the Interest common to us Apprehending it is of moment that this Business should come to you with speed and surety we have sent it by an Express Your very loving friend Oliver P 
