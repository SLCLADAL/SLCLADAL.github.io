DEAR SIR Saturday night last I returned hither from the West and found my wife and children well here I was with your cousin Stratton at Sutton Court and at his own house about a fortnight since but could not be so serviceable to you there as I designed by reason he had not nor could not possibly (as he said) make out your accompt for me but promised to return fifty pounds of your money hither to me with the first oppor_tunity and make his accounts perfect agianst my coming again into that country There are generally great complaints of the difficulties to raise money amongst tenants but I meet with none greater than those I have heard from Mr Stratton the tenants thereabouts being much worse than formerly and (as he says) are grown so poor and scarce that unless they are per_mitted to have their rents left in their hands for a considerable time and other advantages besides there is not a tenant to be had for anything in these parts By all which I presume there are some arrears greater than he was willing to tell me the particulars of at that time especially having a prospect that the greatest part of them will be speedily gotten in Mr Stratton hath followed the method I directed and without any difficulty and trouble hath got into his hands your lease to Robert Haroll of the home close at Beluton etc which will be a further security for what remains due from him to prevent him in his design of making such unreasonable advantages upon you as he intended by it My time at present will not permit me to give you a more particular account of your affairs in Somerset but if I can be so happy as to see you this summer as I intended you will then be more fully informed but ever since I fixed my thoughts of that enjoyment everything has seemed to conspire against me in it First many cross accidents in my own affairs have hap_pened besides the death of my Lady King which brought me into a trust for her children And immediately upon that the sickness and death of my Cousin Clarke's lady here he being at that time extremely ill and since dead in the country leaving the care of his estate and four young children upon me hath so much increased my affairs and troubles that at present I can hardly see a way through them But notwithstanding these and many other unexpected misfortunes that have happened yet Madam and I are not totally without hopes of seeing you before we return into the West if there be a possibility of my getting so much time as to come to you which I most earnestly and heartily wish for your friend Mrs R S is just now come in with your letter that came enclosed the last week to her for me and gives you her real love and service but at present the time will not permit me to answer any part of it But you may be certain I will carefully perform what is therein desired and answer it with the first opportunity and for ever remain your most affectionate friend and faithful servant E Madam gives her service to you etc
