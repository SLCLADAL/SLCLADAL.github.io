Gentlemen and my very good friends My Lord Strickland who is one of our Council did impart to us a Letter written from yourselves to him according to your desire therein expressed which occasions this return from us to you As nothing that may reflect to the prejudice of your outward Good either Personal or as you are a Civil Government shall easily pass with us so much less what shall tend to your discouragement as you are Saints to your Congregations gathered in that way of fellowship commonly known by the name of Independents whether of one judgment or other `this' shall be far from being actually discountenanced or passively `left to' suffer damage by any applying themselves to me I do once for all give you to understand that I should thereby destroy and dis_appoint one of the main ends for which God hath planted me in the station I am in Wherefore I desire you in that matter to rest se_cure True it is that two Ministers one Mr Cole and one Mr Pye did present to me a Letter in the name of divers Ministers of Newcastle the Bishoprick of Durham and Northumberland of an honest and Chris_tian purpose the sum whereof I extracted and re_turned an answer thereunto a true Copy whereof I send you here enclosed By which I think it will easily appear that the consideration of my kindness is well deserved by them provided they observe the con_dition `there' expressed which in charity I am bound to believe they will and without which their own consciences and the world will know how to judge of them Having said this I or rather the Lord require of you that you walk in all peaceableness and gentle_ness inoffensiveness truth and love towards them as becomes the Servants and Churches of Christ Know_ing well that Jesus Christ of whose diocese both they and you are expects it Who when He comes to gather His People and to make Himself a name and praise amongst all the people of the earth He will save her that halteth and gather her that was driven out and will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame And such lame ones and driven out ones were not the Independents only and Presbyterians a few years since by the Popish and Prelatical Party in these Nations but such are and have been the Pro_testants in all lands persecuted and faring alike with you in all the Reformed Churches And there_fore knowing your charity to be as large as all the Flock of Christ who are of the same Hope and Faith of the Gospel with you I thought fit to commend these few words to you being well assured it is written in your heart So to do with this that I shall stand by you in the maintaining of all your just privi_leges to the uttermost And committing you to the blessing of the Lord I rest Your loving friend Oliver P 
