Right Honourable and my very good Lord I am very glad of this opportunity that by the hand of a gentleman who doth so entirely honour you both in his continual speech and in his soul I may revive also with your Lordship mine own long devotion even since the time that I did first contemplate your noble virtues when I was a poor student at Altorph which were my happiest days For what have <I> since observed in my employments but a few maxims of State too high for my capacity and too subtle for my nature which was cast in a plainer mould? Is then at least my fortune mended? Alas my dear Lord let me not think of that For when I consider how all those of my rank have been dignified and benefited at home while I have been gathering of cockles upon this lake I am in good faith impatient more of the shame than of the sense of want Yet this is my comfort that my gracious Master (as it hath pleased him to let me know) doth love me And for the rest philosophy shall be my reward which though it cannot keep me from need yet it will teach me not to envy those that abound It was not my meaning when I took this leaf to make myself the subject of my letter unto your Lordship though the remembrance of your ancient favours hath I know not how made my pen so familiar For the public affairs we stand here yet very ambiguously The land was long since quiet but the sea as the more movable element is still in agitation and we are artificially kept at excessive charge by a mad Viceroy and a winking Pope while the King of Spayne in the meanwhile standeth at the benefit of time and fortune ready to authorize or disavow the event according to the success which I take to be the sum of our case but these things will be more particularly delivered to your lordship by this `redeemed Neptune' as I have baptized him for they here think him more than a man that knows so much more than themselves And in truth if any place had been vacant worthy of his sufficiency there wanted no desire to hold him as they have expressed by offers to himself and declared in their letters by him to their ambassador and most of all in the confident communication of their affairs and desires with him which likewise include some hope of their having him again as your Lordship will perceive by the subject of my dispatch to the King which he carrieth I must add hereunto for mine own part that I have been glad of this occasion which hath given me a better taste of him and of his fair and clear dispositions than I could take at a transitory view when I passed my last duty with your Lordship in Canterburie and I am likewise almost not sorry that I have yet not seen a letter which he tells me your Lordship wrote by him unto me For it would have made me the more ashamed to have done him so little service here that had brought me such a favour though I am other_wise not poor of your Lordship's gracious lines whereof I preserve to this hour a great roll and especially one which I long for some hour to show your Lordship because I know in your nobleness you cannot deny it though in my meanness I could never deserve it And here I will end your lordship's trouble with my prayers to our loving God for your happiness Ever remaining Your Lordship's with an honest heart to serve you HENRY WOTTON
