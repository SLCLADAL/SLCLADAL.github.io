To MRS MAGDALEN HERBERT Madam Your favours to me are everywhere I use them and have them I enjoy them at London and leave them there and yet find them at Mitcham Such riddles as these become things inexpressible and such is your goodness I was almost sorry to find your servant here this day because I was loth to have any witness of my not coming home last night and indeed of my coming this morning But my not coming was excusable because earnest business detained me and my coming this day is by the example of your St Mary Magdalen who rose early upon Sunday to seek that which she loved most and so did I and from her and myself I return such thanks as are due to one to whom we owe all the good opinion that they whom we need most have of us By this messenger and on this good day I commit the enclosed holy hymns and sonnets (which for the matter not the workmanship have yet escaped the fire) to your judgment and to your protection too if you think them worthy of it and I have appointed this enclosed sonnet to usher them to your happy hand Your unworthiest servant unless your accepting him to be so have mended him JO DONNE
