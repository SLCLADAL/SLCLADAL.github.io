Sir You have here at length the four th and last book of my scattered thoughts concerning the Understanding and I see now more than ever that I have reason to call them scattered since never having looked them over all together till since this last part was done I find the ill effects of wrting in patches and at distant times as this whole essay has been For there are so many repetitions in it and so many things still misplaced that though I venture it confused as it is to your friendship yet I cannot think these papers in a condition to be showed anyone else till by another review I have reduced them into yet better order Though bateing that and the negligence of the style you will find very little in the argument itself that I think for the matter of it needs altering Of what use it may be to any other I cannot tell but if I flatter not myself I has been of great help to our first enquiry and the search of knowledge ever since has been in my thoughts which is now five or six years For so long ago upon this enquiry which I am not sorry for And if it has cost me some pains in thinking it has rewarded me by the light I imagine I have received from it as well as by the pleasure of discovering certain truths which to me at least were new for being resolved to examine humane understanding and the ways of our knowledge not by others' opinions but by what I could from my own observations collect myself I have purposely avoided the reading of all books that treated any way of the subject that so I might have nothing to bias me any way but might leave my thought free to entertain only what the matter itself suggested to my meditations So that if they at any time jump with others twas not that I followed them and if they differ 'twas not out of contradiction or a mind to be singular My aim has been only truth so far as my shortsighted_ness could reach it and where I have misstated it in part or in the whole I shall be glad to be set right Read it therefore as a friend's act judge of it as a stranger's and let me have your opinion with the greatest freedom than which there can be nothing more obliging to Your most humble servant J L {John_Locke 31st Dec 1686
