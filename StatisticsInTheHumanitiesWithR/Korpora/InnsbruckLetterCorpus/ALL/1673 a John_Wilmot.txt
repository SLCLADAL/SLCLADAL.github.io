Dear Savile Do a charity becoming one of your pious principles in preserv_ing your humble servant Rochester from the imminent peril of sobriety which for want of good wine more than company (for I drink like a hermit betwixt God and my own conscience) is very like to befall me Remember what pains I have formerly taken to wean you from your pernicious resolutions of dis_cretion and wisdom And if you have a grateful heart (which is a miracle amongst you statesmen) show it by directing the bearer to the best wine in town and pray let not this highest point of sacred friendship be performed slightly but go about it with all due deliberation and care as holy priests to sacrifice or as discreet thieves to the wary performance of burglary and shop lifting Let your well discerning palate (the best judge about you) travel from cellar to cellar and then from piece to piece till it has lighted on wine fit for its noble choice and my approbation To engage you the more in this matter know I have laid a plot may very probably betray you to the drinking of it My Lord will inform you at large Dear Savile as ever thou dost hope to out do Machiavel or equal me send some good wine! So may thy wearied soul at last find rest no longer hovering 'twixt th' unequal choice of politics and lewdness! May'st thou be admired and loved for thy domestic wit beloved and cherished for thy foreign interest and intelligence Rochester
