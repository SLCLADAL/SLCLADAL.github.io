To my honoured Friends the Deputy Lieutenants for the County of Suffolk GENTLEMEN Cambridge 10th March 1642 I am sorry I should so often trouble you about the business of money it's no pleasant subject to be too frequent upon But such is Captain Nelson's occasion for want thereof that he hath not wherewith to satis_fy for the billet of his soldiers and so this Business for Norfolk so hopeful to set all right there may fail Truly he hath borrowed from me else he could not have paid to discharge this Town at his departure It's a pity a Gentleman of his affections should be discouraged! Wherefore I earnestly beseech you to consider him and the Cause It's honourable that you do so What you can help to be pleased to send into Norfolk he hath not wherewith to pay a Troop one day as he tells me Let your return be speedy to Norwich Gentlemen command Your servant OLIVER CROMWELL `P S ' I hope to serve you in my return with your conjunction we shall quickly put an end to these businesses the Lord assisting
