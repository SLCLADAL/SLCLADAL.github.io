Of all men I should not trouble you with money matters did not the heavy necessities my Troops are in press me beyond measure I am neglected ex_ceedingly! I am now ready for my march towards the Enemy who hath entrenched himself over against Hull my Lord Newcastle having besieged the Town Many of my Lord of Manchester's Troops are come to me very bad and mutinous not to be confided in they paid to a week almost mine noways provided for to support them except by the poor Sequestrations of the County of Huntingdon! My Troops increase I have a lovely company you would respect them did you know them They are no Anabaptists they are honest sober Christians they expect to be used as men! If I took pleasure to write to the House in bitter_ness I have occasion 'Of' the 3 000 l allotted to me I cannot get the Norfolk part nor the Hertfordshire it was gone before I had it I have minded your ser_vice to forgetfulness of my own and Soldiers' necessities I desire not to seek myself but I have little money of my own to help my Soldiers My estate is little I tell you the business of Ireland and England hath had of me in money between Eleven and Twelve Hundred pounds therefore my Private can do little to help the Public You have had my money I hope in God I desire to venture my skin So do mine Lay weight upon their patience but break it not! Think of that which may be a real help I be_lieve 5 000 l is due If you lay aside the thought of me and my Letter I expect no help Pray for Your true friend and servant OLIVER CROMWELL 'P S ' There is no care taken how to maintain that Force of Horse and Foot raised and a raising for my Lord of Manchester He hath not one able to put_on 'that business ' The Force will fall if some help not all will be lost if God help not!
