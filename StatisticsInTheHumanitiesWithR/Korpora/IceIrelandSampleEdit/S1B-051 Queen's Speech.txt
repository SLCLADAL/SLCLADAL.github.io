<S1B-051 Queen's Speech>  Thank-you Mr Chairman  This uh I think has been a very good idea to have a debate on the Queen 's Speech  and I I look forward to comments made by other participants  The first point I want to make with regard to the Queen 's Speech uh is the what I think is the the insensitivity of the draftsman who placed the reference to Northern Ireland uh within the section of the Queen 's Speech dealing with foreign affairs  Hear-hear  Now this is something to which we take exception  Uh we did manage to uh get it moved  the reference to Northern Ireland moved to the right section of the Queen 's Speech a number of years ago  but there  matters have slid back  on this  And it was for that reason that the Ulster Unionist Party yesterday tabled an amendment to the Humble Address  uh an amendment actually in exactly the same terms as an amendment we tabled twenty years ago  And uh I would invite other Members of the house  uh to subscribe  other Members of this Forum who are also Members of the House of Commons  to consider subscribing their names to that amendment to the Humble Address as a way  means of showing uh our uh  disappointment at the this form of reference  The purpose of the Queen 's Speech is to announce the Government 's legislative programme for the forthcoming year  And as has been mentioned  the only legislative proposal in the Queen 's Speech relating to Northern Ireland uh was the provision for legislation on decommissioning  and we found the reference in the Queen 's Speech not entirely satisfactory  The phrase  They stand ready to introduce legislation to provide for the  decommissioning of firearms  is too passive  and we expected to see a more positive commitment  I do have to say that the Prime Minister in his speech and again the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last night in reply to myself uh did make it clear that they uh do actually intend to introduce legislation  But at the same time uh the Leader of the House was unable to give a date for the Second Reading when asked to do so  And this I found quite disappointing because we 'd been given to understand that the legislation would be introduced and enacted during November  And I think we would need to move rapidly on this  And of course  that would then give us the opportunity in the House to take up some of the points made by Mr McCartney with regard to the very obvious gap in the legislation  namely the failure to provide for the decommissioning of terrorist weapons in Great Britain  And that is an obvious gap and one which I think will have to be addressed  And of course in so doing  we 'll have the opportunity perhaps to have some explanation as to why uh the present draft of the Bill does not contain or provide for such decommissioning  There is another bigger gap in the whole concept of it  The the object of the Queen 's Speech is to announce legislation  And as members of the Forum know there is a whole raft of government legislative proposals for Northern Ireland that weren't in the Queen 's Speech  And these are the proposals that some members will be aware of uh that were referred to in a a letter which we received from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the fourteenth of November  setting out his Northern Ireland legislative programme  Now uh it has come to our party I think other parties too may also have received this  interruption by member  Uh sorry fourteenth of October I should have said  uh setting out his legislative programme  Now the question is  why is there not a proper statement on this  why is there not a proper debate on the Government 's legislative programme for Northern Ireland  Now this might  Mr Chairman be an issue that this Forum could take up  Indeed uh if the Secretary of State we we have asked in the past the Secretary of State to make a statement to the House of Commons containing his legislative programme so that he could be asked questions about it  and he has regularly declined to do so  Perhaps this Forum might like to consider inviting the Secretary of State to come  and explain to the people of Northern Ireland his legislative programme for Northern Ireland  And that is something that we could take up at that stage  I 'll not go through the or touch further on the proposals on this but I think this is a very positive way in which this Forum uh could pursue the matter and I hope that is done  several words   Uh not in the limited time available  I 'm sorry  I have only ten minutes and I am not uh  pre  prepared to to to risk further uh inroads on it  The other issue that comes to mind in connection with the Queen 's Speech and the debate on it is the whole question of uh ceasefire decommissioning and what is to happen to the inter-party talks  Now here I notice uh a  certain movement by the Government uh in a sensible direction  uh and this I 'm here referring to the uh comments made by the Prime Minister in his speech  uh to the House  on Wednesday afternoon  where referring to uh Sinn Fe/in and IRA and the possibility of ceasefires and so on  uh he said that IRA and Sinn Fe/in should be under no illusion that they can join the process until they have demonstrated real commitment to democratic and non-violent methods  Now an emphasis on the need for a real commitment to democratic and non-violent methods is welcome  as indeed was the reference in the subsequent sentence uh by the Prime Minister to soft words not being sufficient  Now however  while that represents a move in the right direction  I don't think it moves far enough  Hear-hear  And I think what we need uh is to have a clearer definition  It might have been possible it might have been justifiable uh in nineteen ninety-four to make working assumptions in the hope that people were moving in the right direction  But having now had clear and irrefutable uh evidence that they weren't moving in the right direction and indeed that the whole ceasefire was duplicitous from the outset then I think we can't just rely on general  statements of that nature  And we need to have a clear definition from the Government as to what is a satisfactory ceasefire  And I think that is necessary  as indeed is a clear response from the Government on the question of decommissioning and as Members  as fellow Delegates know uh we in the Ulster Unionist Party set out our position on this in the paper we published on the thirtieth of September which sets down what I think is the irreducible minimum in terms of uh commitments with regard to that issue  And we need these matters because uh as the Prime Minister said on Wednesday with regard to Sinn Fe/in  of the attitude of Sinn Fe/in is plainly incompatible with joining the talks  They have excluded themselves by their return to violence  Note the past tense  they have excluded themselves  And they  that should be the case  There should not now be any serious suggestion of introducing Sinn Fe/in into the talks  And the talks should go on in their absence  several speakers  Hear-hear  And that is what we earnestly hope will happen  Uh as to whether talks proceeding in the absence of Sinn Fe/in would be successful or not is a matter that time will tell  Uh we are not scared of the prospect of talks  We have confidence in our ability and confidence in our arguments  We are prepared to present the argument for the Unionist case  whatever the context may be  and whether the talks succeed or not depends on the attitude of all the parties concerned  And if it turns out that the Irish Government and Irish Nationalists are not prepared to go on without Sinn Fe/in then the responsibility for the failure in the talks will be theirs  If on the other hand it turns that if they are prepared to go on and to try and seek agreement with us  that is good  And we will see if we can find an agreement with them that protects the democratic rights of the people of Northern Ireland including their right to determine their constitutional destiny  If other parties are not prepared to agree with that well then the responsibility will be with them  But I cannot see any possible good in Unionists volunteering for the blame for failure  if failure occurs let the blame lie with those who have not and are not prepared to acknowledge and respect the democratic rights of the people of Northern Ireland  It is our job to vindicate those rights uh in this Forum and elsewhere  and that the Ulster Unionist Party will do  several speakers  Hear-hear  Dr Paisley  Mr Chairman I don't think we can take any comfort whatsoever today from anything the Prime Minister says  The Prime Minister at this moment is in cahoots with the Republic 's Government to try and find a way to get Sinn Fe/in into these talks  and anybody that knows anything about the political situation in our province today knows that Mr uh Spring is making the running  and that the uh the British Government are simply tagging on  I don't think either that the poor draftsman of this document should be blamed  The Government should be blamed for the position that they have put this in  And if ever there was an insult to the people of Northern Ireland this was the most insulting thing because they said they will maintain close and friendly relations with the Republic of Ireland  a Government that makes a claim against this country  a territorial claim  and yet they were more uh uh keen to get in their last sentence  close and friendly relations with the Republic of Ireland  The Republic of Ireland are beavering away  and the the the British Government are going to go along with an attempt to get Sinn Fe/in into the talks and I don't take any comfort from anything the Prime Minister has said at this juncture  In fact his civil servants are busy talking to these gunmen and terrorists at the present time along with the civil servants of the South of Ireland  And as long as these sort of talks are going on the Prime Minister 's words are meaningless and reek with the the hypocrisy that he used on another occasion uh when he said his stomach would turn over to think of people talking to the IRA when for the past two years before that his civil servants were doing exactly that  So anybody that takes any comfort from anything Mr Major is saying at the present time is a fool  because there 's no comfort for us in that  There 's only one thing that we can do  and that is to make our views known in the clearest possible way  that there is no place for Sinn Fe/in at these talks  Hear-hear  And there 's no place for any parties that persist in holding on to their murder weapons  And this Forum should be aware today  and it is a very important awareness that they should have  that we 're not having legislation for decommissioning  We 're having legislation for an amnesty  That 's what it 's about  an amnesty  I met along with the representatives of the UK Unionists the Secretary of State  We discussed the matter of this legislation  He made it absolutely clear that the deal was done  He made it  like  absolutely clear that the deal was this  that in Northern Ireland the guns would not be handed over to the Government  they 'd be hand over to an independent body who would immediately destroy them  There would be no examination  that there would be an undertaking given that no terrorist who it could be proved from forensic uh prima facie case that they were  engaged in using that gun for a murder that that person could never be brought to any court to stand trial  and he would be absolutely free  The the Secretary of State  Mr Trimble needn't mumble  This is what the Secretary of State told us  And he told us and witnesses  Many people were at that meeting  That 's what he told us  And he also said of course across the water that wouldn't be  because when the guns came in they would examine them and if they could get evidence that they were used against anyone those people would be brought to court  So we have an undermining of the Union in that here where they should be bringing in legislation to defend the Union and maintain it  they 're prepared to sell it out to the IRA and the terrorists  But across the water of course  they 're not going to do that  There 's going to be two laws in this United Kingdom  I must say to this House today that no-one who has committed a crime can  have an amnesty  They have got to be tried for their crime  And I would say one other thing  and I deeply resent it  and we told the Secretary of State this  when Mr McCrea my colleague said to him what about the people whose loved ones were victims to these crimes and were murdered by these weapons  He said sure we have no evidence Willie at the moment against these people  What difference does it make  Well I want to say that that language from the Secretary of State shows the way the British Government are moving  And they are going to move to get Sinn Fe/in in to these talks  I thought that the leader of the Official Unionists today would have spelt out clearly his proposals about a sort of half-way house  that Sinn Fe/in can come in  according to his proposals  they can come in uh to a half-way house and then eventually if they keep certain conditions they can come in to the full house  I don't want  to see Sinn Fe/in in any half-way house or in any full house  because these people have no right to claim to be democrats  no right to claim that they have should have any say whatsoever in the future discussions about this province  But I 'd have the House to note that the Government 's position is  it must be based on a comprehensive political settlement commanding widespread support  Every Unionist should know that the widespread support is only needed among Nationalists  That 's all that 's needed  If they get widespread support among Nationalists  they don't mind  They will go ahead with their particular deal  Uh you 're getting a bit anxious uh Mr Chairman  I see by your face  What time have I to stop  No you 're okay  You 've four  three minutes
