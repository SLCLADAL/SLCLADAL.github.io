very good  Mm  You buy a moped say for about two hundred pound or something  You could uhm spin around in it all week for about a pound   petrol   Are they enjoyable  though  Ah no but it wouldn't it be brilliant like  Save  you legging it in  on your bicycle and  ripping your jeans and  oil on your jeans Ciara  laughter   Yeah   It would  It would be great   Oil from my  tyres   Oil on  my jeans you mean  Your jeans were they  They weren't your jeans  What are you talking about  Don't get ratty now  They were my blue ones that I ruined  and her brown trousers  Gone  Gone  Gone with the wind  But what are you having for dinner Michelle  I 'm actually cooking this evening  to cook  potato   One potato   no I 've a few wee small potatoes and I have coleslaw and tomato  laughter   my God  Michelle  1 word  you 're a  vegetarian  you don't balance out your diet though  That 's a starter I take it   I don't balance out my diet at all no  But uhm  there 's nothing wrong with me  Like I 'm I 'm not  anaemic  Yet but I 'm not anaemic or anything like that  I 'm totally healthy like  You should have more vegetables  No you don't  It 's terrible   Yet    You should you should  substi  if you 're not going to eat properly you should  take vitamin  tablets or something  I know but   No I hate them  shitty things  I can't  I can't swallow them  Iron tablets   Why  You can get it in liquid  form   They 're too big   And as well  as that I 'm so uh uhm  unreliable  I can't uh be relied on to take a tablet every morning like or  or whatever   Cod liver oil   Mm   Aahh  laughter   Aahh  Better be careful  laughter   We 're talking vitamins here now  laughter   We are indeed   We are   We are  We are  Anyway  Let 's quickly change the  subject   Change  the subject there  topic change and all that  I think you should get a good iron tonic into you  I do think  so   Okay mommy   You 're very wishy-washy  Yeah you 're as  white as a sheet   Do you think I   do you  think I look white  Yeah they 're always saying that I 've got very grey circles under my  eyes   Yeah  grey  bluey  It 's hardly surprising considering you live on hot water and crackers  I don't live on hot water and crackers but that 's quite a nice meal actually  laughter   That 's that 's like   cardboard  It is yeah  There 's  cardboard in that   Would  you do  you know what I used to eat all the time now  This is  all I ever used to live on  Do you know them rice cakes  Now this is  cardboard  Them  I used to live on them all the time  Yeah    Cardboard  There 's no calories in those  Ah there 's something like twenty-five calories  Yeah there isn't enough  wh  like you 'd have four a day  No I used to  I used to eat about say I could eat about a good eight in a day  plenty of water as well  That 's when  I was a bit silly   That that 's  two hundred  calories  Michelle   I know  but then like I  You 're supposed to eat a  thousand   I know  but I 'm not I 'm eating a thousand now  I 'm eating  about fifteen hundred two  two thousand   You 're not  I doubt it  I doubt it  But they 're not even tasty   that 's why I  that 's why I went off them  Yeah  Calories   Yeah  Sometimes for a treat I would have banana on top  laughter   Oh my God  A treat  laughter   What did I have today  I 'd a few packets of crisps  Yeah  Bit of chocolate  Yeah I I 'd a Yorkie  Soup  There 's a bit of a Yorkie lying in the kitchen there   biscuit  and raisin  Sandwiches   We 'd sandwiches with lashings of mayonnaise  Youse are terrible  Lashings   Fry up though  was the killer  Oh it was huge  Was it  Mm  It was fabulous  Do you know what I love with a fry what I used to love with a fry up now  was fried bread  slurping noises   Gorgeous   soda bread   With  1 syll   soda  bread fried no   No   Mmm  Oh soda bread  Oh gorgeous  delish  Beautiful  mmm  Mmm  Oh let me see now  Talking of the cinema now  what did I go and see last  th  that youse could go and see  What was it  I saw the Last Seduction  Forrest Gump was the last thing I saw  I saw that as well  What did you think  Alright  I was disappointed  Really  It was a good enough film but very long  very boring  I thought it was going to be funny   It was good enough film  though  laughter   2 sylls  It was quite funny in parts   It was  It was good  It was  a  well-made film like but uhm  too long and too boring for me  I thought it was going to be a laugh a minute  I was crying all the way through  Really  Mm  You were crying all the way through  Screeching  Why  It 's such a tragic story like  Oh Michelle  laughter  It 's a comedy  But it 's not  Do you call that poor girl  going away off and nearly having such a horrible life  Her father abusing her always getting in these abusive relationships then  feeling so down in the dumps that she was going to jump off a building one night  And then  poor wee Forrest Gump who was madly in love with her  not being able to ever have her  And then in the end whenever she 'd done everything else she came back to him crawling back to him using him  used him and abused him  She didn't  She did  She used him and abused him ran off  had her had his child    3 words    I think the  key point to it all is that it 's actually fictitious  Mm  I know it 's fictitious but if it 's going to be a film like you want to be able to  relate or something  I don't know  I don't know if there 's a need to bawling though around the place  No there isn't a  need to be bawling   Well I was crying  I was crying  Did you go with Ronan  Yeah he was laughing at me crying  laughter   I 'm sure everyone else was as well  There was a few other people crying now  I doubt it  laughter   It 's a comedy  Ah it 's not a comedy  a  and what was really stupid was  what the hell was he running for  It 's the only thing he could do  laughter   Like that nobody  would do that  I ran three times around the world just cos I wanted to   3 sylls    But you see he was so pissed off because  his girlfriend  well his girl he loved   And then he got  so ugly  Well then then he became Tom Hanks  so  No well the hair it it looked a bit like John actually the beard and the  long hair  Didn't he  Oh yucky    he was very   Didn't

beautiful  a lovely and short at the back shaped you know  and a bit longer on the top  Very very nice  Suits him now  He 's got gingery gingery-coloured hair and he wears glasses  Now that sounds like pure ugly  combination altogether  But he doesn't  He looks alright now  You wouldn't  I would 've done it free   A grand looking chap  You wouldn't say he 's beautiful or handsome or anything but I really like him  lots   Oh that 's the  main thing  Are you attracted to him   much so   Does he  turn you on Michelle  Yes   Do you  have passionate sex Michelle  laughter   No-one 's going to  you know  you know it won't it won't go past  the four walls   We won't  we won't tell anybody  laughter   Our relationship is very deep  That means you do  laughter   5 words   Is it a deep relationship  Yeah  You 're serious though I mean  Yeah very serious  You 're at the ravishing flesh stage  No we 're we 're at uhm  You 're beyond that stage  Yeah  Well if you 're beyond that  why go on  Because there 's so much more to the the relationship than  Of course of course but is there  more to  sex than  than what  Lust   Course there is  Well what  Ah Olive   Och Sarah now  that 's an awful thing to say  I 'm just asking you  what exactly   That shows  that you 've had some bad experiences in your lifetime  laughter   I feel tragic now   She 's bitter  Don't mind her  She 's bitter   I 'm bitter   Bitter bitter  The bitter pill  There you are  There 's a big pair of scissors on  on that companion set over there  Where  Are they for the fire
