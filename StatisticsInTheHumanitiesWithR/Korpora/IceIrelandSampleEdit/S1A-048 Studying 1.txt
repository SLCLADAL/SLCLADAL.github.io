what  And my older  brother is in  Galway on the dole  and the other older brother is in Cork on the dole  and the younger brother is still in school  Are they older   So you don't have much to live on do you  laughter   my sister 's doing Law in UCC  Oh is she  Yeah  What year  Uhm second year  She repeated fifth year though  and then she repeated Leaving  So she 's about  what  twenty-five  She   Twenty-one  Twenty-one   she 's   And  she repeat fifth year and the Leaving   Jesus   Are you sure   Yeah  But that means she 's only twenty-one  which means that  she    Yeah  she 's only twenty-one right which means that she would have been seventeen in fifth year  She repeated that so she was eighteen  Oh right yeah yeah  And then she did sixth year when she was nineteen twenty twenty-one  Yeah it doesn't really figure  I don't know  I think she was very young or something  Yeah so have you any other questions that  somebody might   Yes  I do  I have plenty  of questions  Uhm  how do you get on with your parents  Do you get on well with your parents  Okay go on   Uhm I usen't to  I used to always get on well with my  Mam  but I usen't get on well with my Dad  But as since I moved out of the house  you know it changes your view on things  And  when you go back to the house it 's different like  Mm   Mm   Yeah  So you know it 's  get on better with him  a lot better now  than I  used to do  Yeah   Yeah and what about your brothers and sisters  Do you get on well with them  Well as I say Michael 's in England so I didn't see him like I don't see him uh hardly ever  Maybe once   But do  you not write to him   Well he doesn't write to me like and  Yeah  And I just don't you know you just don't have time  And is your sister living at home  Well but she 's got a  she 's going out with a Marine an American  Marine  called Bat  And uh he 's  so she 's going out with him  And she 's hardly ever in the house  I don't know  I get on with her a lot better than I do with Michael like  Oh  laughter   Yeah  My brother  But  that 's just probably just she 's she 's around more and she 's younger than he is so you know  She caused a bit of hassle  if you know what I mean  So it 's kind of a  he was a really perfect child  You know what I mean  yeah  Yeah   Yeah yeah yeah   Yeah yeah yeah yeah   And what school did you go to in Dublin  What school  Yeah  I went to Terenure  And then no first of all I went to Ballyroan  That was a primary  school  And then I went to Terenure for six years  That 's secondary  And then  uh I failed  Well I didn't fail the Leaving but I got about fourteen points and  I  needed eighteen to get into  to get into college in UCC  r  did it again  Did the Leaving again in Templeogue which is you know fifth and sixth year  It 's only for those  two years  So I did that and I got the points then  now I 'm here like  Mm   Mm   Mm   And how many points did you get in the Leaving  The second time  Mmm  Twenty-two  Mmm  So  And now why why do you go to UCC  I don't know  UCD like first of all well well UCC supposedly it 's meant to be easier to get into second year Psychology  That 's  what I was told  They let in eighty while Dublin lets in  an awful lot less  That 's what I heard it was meant to be  an awful lot easier  Oh   Yeah  And then moving away from home  I wanted to get away from home as well  Mm mm  And a friend of mine Jason  You know Jason  don't  He was down here and he was saying that it was meant to be  pretty good down here  so I decided to come down anyway  Yeah   Yeah yeah   Mm mm  mm  and do you have any pets at home  laughter  Yeah a dog Roland  Roland  Yeah  What kind of dog  He 's a Golden Retriever  How old is he  Uhm oh God  He 's about  what five six now  Mm I see  Did you meet Snoopy when you came out to my house that time   Your dog   I saw him briefly  Yeah yeah   He was petrified  laughter  1 syll  all night  You know that   Jesus  he frightened me anyway  He virtually ran away the next day because all there were all these people coming down the drive and he was  he was like going nuts  And I was like  shut up Snoopy  Shut up   Yeah  yeah  And he was hiding up on the stairs and everything  He went upstairs   What    what did he look like cos I can't remember him like  I just saw this kind of a  laughter  a blur  He was   He was black and white  He 'd a black patch on one eye   That 's why he 's  called Snoopy yeah  Yeah and a  white patch  on the other eye  He 's real timid like  Real  kind of gentle  He 's too much of a sop actually  And you know all all the woods behind our house  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah  They 've cleared them all away  Wh  Putting  houses there or something   Because they 're putting  houses there yeah  there was about a mile of woods behind our house  So you 're just going to have houses  Did  you ever go up there like as kids  or that  Yeah   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  I went up there  all the  yeah  Aw  You should protest or something like  The Wonder Years   Ah there 's no point like  And they were working at twelve o'clock last night up with bulldozers in the woods  Still clearing the woods like  And when have they cleared it fully yet no  Almost though  I mean there are pheasant uhm sparrowhawks and everything up there  And there 's been no complaints  I don't know if there has or not because see the woods was  privately owned  in the first place  and there was an awful lot of hassle up there with  knackers coming in   Jesus   So it 's up to your  man to let them or not  Yeah  God that 's shit right  Yeah it 's terrible  Uhm  And what do you think of Castlewhite anyway  What 's it like living here  Uh well I was living here last year  And then I 'm back down here for the next few weeks  just to repeat the exams  But it 's real I don't know  it 's clinical  like  It 's real  all the walls are white and it 's  the steel you  know  the steel stairs and everything  It 's real it 's like a hospital  nearly  But you know you 've you 're near the college and  you 've got all the facilities you  need  like a washing-machine and so  on  So it 's grand like  It does  does the job   Mm   Mm   Mm   Yeah   Mm   And is there  no way you 'd consider  getting moving out of here and getting a flat  4
