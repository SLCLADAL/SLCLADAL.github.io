<S2A-032 Investment NI>  Uhm we 've had people in who have uhm products which are in very early stages of development and it 's going to be like three years before they 'll break even you know because their capital costs were so high initially  So they need to know that before they get funding and organise with their bank a huge overdraft  If they weren't able to show like a break-even point they wouldn't be able to get any funding anywhere  People 'll just say och don't be silly  You 're making a loss  you know  But they could show you know with the projected sales income and guaranteed sales in the future actually it would turn into a profit  And also for yourselves I mean if you 're making a loss  by the end of month three or month four it might be very demoralizing  But if you 've worked out your break-even point as month five even you know it 's alright  I expect this  In another month 's time I 'll 've covered all my costs and I 'll actually be in profit  Has everybody got the principle of break even  So guess what you 're going to do now  Have a go at trying to find your break-even point  If you 're charging uhm an hourly rate what you would do in here would be the hourly uhm hourly rate you 're charging  Okay so if it 's fifteen pounds an hour  you work out how many hours you have to do to cover all your overheads  If you 're charging per day you just put your daily figure in there and work out how many days you have to do  to cover all your costs  Say total cost there it 's just again  overheads plus the uh depreciation  and your drawings then you know  That 's it okay  It 's almost the same as that calculation you did a bit a  while ago working out the cost  But now it 's about price Interruption for discussion   Flow forecasting  profit loss account  how to forecast your sales and then we 'll be doing our own profit and loss our own cash flow  Alright  I 'm just finishing off by looking at a few issues  All those costs that you 've looked at last night and tonight uhm we can use these costs  in our cash flow and in our profit and loss accounts  We 'll also have to get our sales projections  but once we 've got that we can pull together our  financial projections  Has anybody uh done a cash flow before  Okay  So a few people have  A cash flow forecast all it is is basically a prediction of what 's going to be flowing into and out of the business okay on a cash basis  So maybe you usually do it from the year or for a year in advance  And it 's just what 's coming into and out of the business  month to month or week to week  Okay what cash is coming in what cash is going out  Profit and loss account I 'm sure everybody 's heard of  slightly different and what it does it summarizes the income and expenditure for a period and it shows you either the profit or the loss you 've made during that period  Cash flow 's just the cash  Profit actually shows uh profit and loss account actually shows you the profit or the loss you 've made  The balance sheet uhm  everybody found the balance sheet  What it is it 's just the finance financial snapshot okay of the business at any given time  It shows the assets and the liabilities for the business  So it shows you like what 's your bank balance what what value are the assets  okay who owns the business as in how much capital there is in it  We won't be doing a balance sheet in this course cos it 's a wee bit more than you need okay but we will be looking at the cash flow and the profit and loss account  Okay so cash flow forecast it 's probably the main uh thing we 'll be spending time on tonight okay  Uhm as we 've said before it 's just a forecast of money coming into and out of the business  What happens you try and look ahead usually the next twelve months  and try to estimate or forecast what 's going to happen  We 'll go from month to month  We 'll look at our sales  We 'll reckon what 're going to be our costs and when are they actually paid out and what 'll happen to our cash  Now why would you want to do a cash flow forecast okay cos a lot of people just want to know about their profit  so why bother about a cash flow  Well it identifies projected bank balances for a start  So it means say uhm you were all looking at your break-even there  say if you 're going to break even in month six  you might have a deficit for each month up to then  But you 'll only know that if you 've done your cash flow and you 've put your figures in and your costs in  So it means you can go to the bank and say  I 'm going to have an  overdra  or I 'm going to be in the red for a few months  but I 've done my cash flow forecasts and look after month six  uh that should be in the black again  It indicates funding requirements  If you can do your forecast and uh you can see what you need when  If you 're going to have a big deficit in month one and month two you might need to go and borrow some money  or you might need to get a friend to lend you some or you might need to put off buying some capital equipment til you 've more money in  It facilitates financial planning  So say uhm a few people say well  I 'm going to really reduce my drawings for the first few months  but if you 've a good cash flow forecast you can say but by month three month four I 'm going to be able to up that because I should have enough money in  So you can do a bit of planning on it  It indicates indicates viability or break-even  Remember that exercise that we 've just done  That will actually show up in your cash flow whenever your costs equal your revenue  And it should show  you can just be able to look it up and where it 's the same that 'll indicate the break-even point  The other thing is it is a requirement of most funders  So if you want to apply for the grant they will actually ask you for a cash flow forecast so that they can see if your business is going to be financially viable or not  If you 're going to the bank as well uhm if you 're just starting off a lot of times you don't have a balance sheet and you don't have a profit and loss account  cos you haven't been in business so they 'll ask you for a cash flow forecast  So it 's a good thing to do and it 's a good thing to know how to do it  Okay so what about a cash flow  I put one on everybody 's desks  Do you all get it  Now this is uhm a typical one from somebody who 's come through the business start programme  I 've amended a few figures but this is pretty typical  So  what do you do  Uhm basically what we 're doing is we 're looking at the total income taking off the total expenditure and we 're going to get a net cash flow every month  So it 's just all the money coming in less all the money going out that 's going to give us a net cash flow  Okay we do that on a monthly basis  And what happens the opening balance right at the start of business will be nothing  You assume you have nothing  It 's a new business  And your closing balance will be the net cash flow  for that month  less the opening balance add on the opening balance  The closing balance this month is going to be the opening balance to the next okay  And we 'll add on the cash flow you know if there 's positive or deduct it if it 's negative and get a closing balance for the next month  All will be revealed  What we 'll do is we 'll go through this and we 'll explain just what everything is okay  let me see  we 'll start by looking at the  see if you look on down it 's called the capital income  Sometimes it 's called capital income and sometimes it 's called funding okay  What would be in that section  would be things like grants  your own investments  Say you 're bringing in computers and stuff into the business you 'd put it in there at the value that it 's worth  So say I 'm bringing in my computer at fifteen hundred pounds I would show my own investment of fifteen hundred pounds in there  Uhm family investment  loans and HP would also go in there too  Okay so say you 're getting HP finance at ten thousand you would put it in okay  And that 's your funding  What it is it 's incomes that 's not through sales  It 's actually capital income  It 's not sales income  Okay so it 's funding or capital income  And after that if you look at the top there  it 's called revenue income that 's actually income from sales  Now in this case if you look it 's just uhm  there 's just the one category  Sometimes if you 're in business and what you do is you would bill  for your services you mightn't get paid immediately  Say the like of me I 'm self-employed  What would happen I would usually write out a bill at the end of the month you know for all the work I have done  Now I would submit that  Now depending who it 's to I mightn't get paid til the next month cos a lot of the businesses have like uhm a cheque run at the end of the next month  So if I submit it tomorrow I won't get paid really the end of June  Okay so when I 'm doing a cash flow then I need to know  sort of when the cash is actually coming in  Sometimes uhm we 've had people and it 's been like three months before they 'll get paid  or they 're on contract where they get paid every six months  so you need to know that  You can put that in  If you were going to do that then you would have another category  in there  alright and you would actually put it in when the money is due in  So even though if you started in April you 've done the work but you 're not going to get paid til June you don't put the money in then til June  Cash sales are very simple  They just go straight in the month they 're done  cos you 're paid immediately  Uhm just on that if you do find that you have problems with people paying you late  there 's now a new thing in where you 're actually entitled to charge interest on overdue accounts  Okay so we have some leaflets up the stairs if anybody 's interested  You 're allowed to charge eight percent actually on overdue accounts  Whether you ever get it or not don't know but it might scare people into paying you quicker  if they think you can charge you  Uhm the next category then  see if you look at the second category down revenue expenditure  And they 're all your running costs that we looked at earlier so there 'd be your fixed overheads and your variable  or sorry your variable costs  or your direct  And you go through uhm the person whose this is they have no materials at all because they were a service industry  But they did have rent and rates eighty pounds a month  They paid twenty-five pounds a month towards their heat and light bill  hundred pounds a month for telephone  forty pounds a month for transport  So you can see all the fixed costs going down there
