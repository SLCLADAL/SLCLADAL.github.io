table  And there was all sorts of goings on  Then she put her dress back on  her hair back up sat up at the bar and ordered a glass of  wine  I remember thinking fair  fair balls to her now really  She could carry it off  And this little black dress  Oh no shook it all about   That 's right   How do they do it   Oh my God   Fionuala do you  remember the night we were in the night we were in the  simultaneous and unclear speech   How do they do it  Do you remember one after the other simultaneous and unclear speech   We were surrounded  There was a crowd of guys  there behind us  One came first and we 'd a perfect view  And then we just had to turn around and  no there were  actually  girls but they  stripped to nothing   A stag party   Were there guys or girls   Girls   Stripped naked  And then the guy was it she got up on his back or he got up on  hers  Oh it was  And the guy  they made him take his trousers off and he had a pair of boxer shorts on him and like it
