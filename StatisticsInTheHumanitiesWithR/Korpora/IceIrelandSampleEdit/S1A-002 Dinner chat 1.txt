girlfriend with him  Mm  She was quite pretty  That pie 's really or that terrine 's really  That is beautiful  Ryan   I know  It 's absolutely gorgeous  I 'm sorry there 's no extra charge for that bit of plastic  Yes why is there a large chunk of plastic in my  laughter  I was pushing it down and broke it off  So does anybody else have the risk of getting this or have I  laughter   I

was put out on Ceefax a few months ago by mistake you know just for a few seconds  The whole you were practising uhm whatever whatever or preparing whatever they were going to say  D 'you like that Seamus  What is that  It 's a bit flavourless  shut up you   the juice the juice   No he meant he meant the juice   Oh the juice  laughter  You were about to get lynched there Patrick  Uh John McBride was in court that day and somebody had managed to see it  or somebody had seen it on  TV  And you know  the word spread round so they all had to stand for a  minute 's silence  cos they thought   Uh-huh right   Oh really   Yeah so they had it all  ready to go  But they 've interviews and everything  I don't think I 'd like someone to come along to me and say  do a wee speech on what you 'll feel when so and so dies  It 'd be a bit hard to put yourself in that position wouldn't it  You mean the interviews for it  are done before   S  Some of the  interviews are done  for it   Apart from the  fact  that no harm to the woman but nobody 'll actually miss her except  her daughter  and her family  Family   Una will  It 's it 's just another old lady who  died   Uh-huh   Mhm  Una was  devastated  yesterday  I 'm not joking you  And   she really was  She was really upset  Una  I don't think devastated is the word  I was just  No I mean there 'll be this national hysteria in the way that there was when Diana  died  But that 's not grief  It 's just hysteria  Mm   Mm  Yeah but they learned their lesson with Diana and it was reinforced with Margaret  Mm  How do you mean  Well with Margaret hardly anybody showed interest  There was hardly anybody there  Did anybody know who she was  They didn't even uhm  belches  Oh I beg your parsnips laughter   Are you going to do this every time somebody says something during the meal  You 're going to wave the tape recorder at them  No I 'm just saying I have to transcribe that laughter   That 's the power of editing  cousin at dinner   We 're not  allowed to  There was a good discussion on this morning about the impact of her on  you know that programme  Seven Days  No  Uhm it 's on every Sunday  It 's very good  Rick  Rick appears on it  very frequently  Is it Ulster   Is it Ulster radio  Mhm  Oh it 's a radio programme  although we don't usually get it since we 're at one o'clock Mass but since I was  at the vigil Mass last night uhm  Yeah we were at the vigil last night  Johnnie kind of lost the plot on the organ a bit so he did  Really   Really  Johnnie  Johnny O'Dwyer  I mean two years ago he was great  but last night it was  What age would he be  Cos Seamus was saying that  didn't he retire  between  when you 'd done your GCSEs and A-levels  He retired in   He retired in eighty-eight  Yeah  Right   Who did   simultaneous speech  Johnnie O'Dwyer Johnnie O'Dwyer  He retired in eighty-eight  Uhm sorry  eighty-nine  Eighty-nine  Mhm  Sorry I just thought you were talking about a priest  the musical guy  Imagine remembering when Johnnie O'Dwyer retired   So that 's at least   at least twelve years ago  And assuming he was sixty-five when he went that would leave him seventy-seven approaching eighty  God    nearly said eighty-nine  wasn't  twelve years ago   can't believe  eighty-nine was twelve years ago  I don't   I don't   I don't think he was sixty-five when he retired   He wouldn't be that age  because he  was in St  Malachy  he was subbing  in St Malachy 's  uhm like  in the last couple of years when I was there  Not at all  He 's not that age   That 's right  He did a lot of subbing there so he did   He 's certainly he 's certainly nowhere near it  Mm  Did he retire in nineteen eighty-eight  Eighty-nine  Just when we did our GCSEs  That 's what people 'll say about you mummy   They 'll say that Mary Reilly  aye she retired last year so she must be sixty-five laughter   I thought there was supposed to be no names mentioned here  I I edit out the names  I 'm only allowed to put in  X  for names so uhm  you can talk about who you want  Are you  is is that thing good enough for this purpose yeah  Have you done this before  because it 's just the grammar we 're looking at  If it was phonetics it wouldn't be   need a  DAT thing  Oh right   The grammar  Yeah  Oh right   So  speak grammatically you  No don't just be natural  No no no no I want as many idiosyncrasies as possible  What  Nothing  Have you graduated yet  Or are you still being  messed around   Fourth of July  No everything 's in  I mean  it 's all  been approved by the  Yeah I know that   You can't call yourself PhD yet can you  Or can you  Well I do  right  Oh well they do in Queen 's  you know   The university  does  The university  several sylls   Once you get your viva over  technically you can  Cos all the communication from Queen 's is   It 's all a matter of form really   It 's quite good that isn't it   Yeah  3 sylls  It 's very nice   4 sylls     1 syll  I just saw  I just saw Uruguay on the uh label and thought I couldn't drive  I couldn't walk go past this  Why   Are you  objecting to me tasting some wine  Absolutely not  Oh it was your face  I was smiling at you  laughing  Well you don't look very kind  It 's nearly  time for you to go to bed   Come here I thought you were grimacing   I know it 's  it 's quite nice to have Joanna at the table with us isn't it   What 's that what 's that horrible  contortion of your face mother if you 're smiling  laughter   I was actually looking for blonde streaks  Aren't they a bit ridiculous  No I like them  I like your roots  laughter   I I I don't see any problem  with them   Yeah why  did you dye them darker than the rest  of them   Yeah  laughter   That 's like Malcolm Dunne  Do you remember Malcolm Dunne said do you remember when we were working in X  he said one day  why is it that girls you know like just get orange and put it round here and then don't put any makeup on the rest of their face  laughter   Malcolm  Cos he thought you know  you know the way people don't rub their makeup in  Uh-huh  He thought that actually  they just put it on round there  and just left the rest  of their face  Uh-huh and left it   This was the owner of Bowler 's  Aye he was more than  2 sylls  He knew how to turn a penny mind you  Mm  Rich man  Malcolm was eighteen and he owned Bowler 's  Oh that was the guy he had the uh personalised van  number   Yes  yes mhm  And then he got the Crinkly Family Funny  Crinkly Family   Fun Park  laughter  simultaneous and unclear speech   The Crinkly Family Fun Park  With the swans  Yeah  I interviewed all the people for there  That 's what  what what is  is that some  leisure thing that 's  now been built at Crinkly Pool or something  They did  they they did away with Crinkly Pool  Oh right did they  And uh  re  replaced it with a sort of leisure park simultaneous and unclear speech   It 's a it 's a paddling pool  It 's not a seawater pool  you can't paddle in it  Cos Crinkly Pool  was seawater wasn't it   They had these  massive swans that you can hire  There 's two pools  There 's a big one with the swans and there 's a wee tiny paddling  pool   And they 've  a train  They got us to like I mean  interview the train driver   Oh hang on  the swan 's a pedalo  Not a  Sorry not a a large flying one squawking bird  laughter   Shane McColl used to go to Crinkly Pool in the summertime  very frequently at night-time with Tommy McDonald  You know Ciara McDonald 's daddy  Yeah  That would be  Niamh 's  grandfather   Niamh 's grandfather  yeah  And he used to pile the car  with all the ones from Drumnisk Park in  front of the Andersonstown Road  And they all went to Crinkly Pool  to swim  At night  Yeah  It would 've been well covered  It was outdoor wasn't it  There was no simultaneous and indistinct speech   All it was was a concrete  hole  that they opened a couple of doors and the sea came in and out  Right   Oh I see right  okay  It wasn't a  a proper heated  swimming pool or anything   Oh I didn't realise that  I thought it was a proper  That was her summer entertainment  Mine was going to the uhm  Was this when you were children like  The park  The Dunville Park with sandwiches with bread and butter and jam and a bottle of water  From the  new Royal  from the new Royal you can see that fountain in the Dunville Park  That 's a lovely piece of architecture  so it is   That 's right  I went on my own   Oh absolutely   I know  every inch   every nook and cranny of it   What   The fountain in the Dunville Park  now I don't think there 'd been water in it for thirty years  Och Seamus there hasn't been water in it in my memory  Oh has there not  Not at all  But you know I was looking at it I was I was just standing out and looking across the Dunville Park from the new place  absol  oh it 's a beautiful place  And the water used to come out  Jill my old next door neighbour  It didn't come out of the top  I think it came from mouths or something  or hands   Right it  didn't come out of the top of the thing no  no  Now I never remember it coming out at all  But  uhm I think Jill might have told me that it came and her memory mightn't 've been right either  But I don't think there was water in that fountain since oh  maybe nearly a century ago  Right   What was significant about Uruguay  It 's Uruguayan wine  Yeah  That 's what I 'm saying  I 'd never seen  a bottle of white from Uruguay so I thought   Oh so that 's why you couldn't pass it  Just I thought  somebody had been there or something  Right okay  No no no no no
