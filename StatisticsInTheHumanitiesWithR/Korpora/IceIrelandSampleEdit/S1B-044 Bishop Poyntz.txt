<S1B-044 Bishop Poyntz>  Samuel Poyntz Church of Ireland Bishop of Connor told his Diocesan Synod in Belfast this morning  he 's a disappointed man  He attempted to set up a body to help Protestant areas uh come up with schemes to seek financial aid from various funds  for example the International Fund  Only a handful  of professional people were prepared to help  Uh the Bishop told his diocese  we have much to learn from the Roman Catholic Church  He also hit out at intolerance  racketeering  the staking out of territory through pavement painting and gable wall murals  He praised cross-community ventures  Obscenity  pornography  bad language  violence all incurred the wrath of the Bishop  So too alienation  not just of the orange green variety  the gap between the haves and the have-nots  Bishop Poyntz when I talked to him this morning didn't draw back from criticism of the Protestant professional classes for their indifference when asked to help the disadvantaged  I 've always felt that there 's a lack of cohesiveness about the Protestant communities in Belfast  Uh the one of the great differences between the Falls Road and the Shankill Road is that the Falls Road is uh has a great community area I think bound together not probably politically but religiously whereas if you go to other areas like the Shankill or other areas there 's a a we 've got that sort of Protestant individualism  And uhm I I  I I see enormous strides being made in other areas  tremendous funds being poured into other areas and quite rightly so too  And it seemed to me that perhaps we weren't getting our act together  And that we should look for uhm uh expertise people like maybe solicitors and bankers and trade unionists and community workers and retired civil servants other people like that who might be help help us and help clergy and parishes uh in formulating schemes and  Yeah I 'm afraid I my my appeal didn't meet with any great uh response  Perhaps uh it 's just uh that we are indifferent or perhaps it 's the difficulty getting people to own an idea  Maybe I didn't sell it properly  How how many replies did you get from professionals  Un  Unfortunately I only had three  Only three  Yes  Now perhaps uh the feeling is or the perception is that Protestant areas generally are or have been better served both in employment and and facilities  Maybe that 's the reason  Well if that 's the the people are completely out of touch  I mean uh the the the unemployment in I in in in our ghetto areas is just as bad as in Belfast as any other area I would say  And it doesn't make any difference whether you 're on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road  uh I I uh or you you 'll find an enormous uh amount of unemployment  Now you you mentioned this uh Roman Catholic community and the  cohesion  and and the efforts to obtain you mentioned grants going to places like Poleglass the New Lodge I think North Howard Street something in the region of fifteen million pounds  y  you 've been saying that you admire their  success  I mean I I I am sure and I accept it is admire and not covet  Yes   Yup   Oh no I it 's it 's quite admire  I feel that they have got their their their act together  And uh look at the scheme in Poleglass valued at five point one million  it it it obviously has  uh involved a lot of people who have got the project right and have thought it out and prepared the whole ground well  I 'm quite certain money is there at the government level but you must get your act together  Yes but but your comments about Protestant disadvantage and the need for uh support both financial and skilled echo the views of uh a man I interviewed the other day former UDA man Glen Barr  You were were at one  with his views on this one   Yes   indeed I would be  Indeed I would be  And I I believe that there 's tremendous goodwill out there  There I I believe I 'm sure there 's goodwill in the government  I 'm sure there 's goodwill in in forms like the  the the Ireland Fund  Uh all sorts of other  funds have got to be tapped  And I 'm I was delighted uh on to see on on yesterday 's paper that uhm there 's another uh substantial sum of money being pumped into making Belfast work  Already a hundred and twenty-four million has been pumped in uhm to to various areas and I 'm delighted that but we must sort of think things through and and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end  th  there 's a psychology in this one Bishop perhaps that has to be looked at and and and it is this  May I put this point to you that uh Protestants perhaps fear  uh that to advance along these lines is to challenge authority and that in some way would diminish loyalty uh to the State and to the Crown  You see it 's all about a statement of nationality and religion and belonging  And some things are said to me in the course of this programme when we talk about grants and disadvantage  if only the other lot knew what side their bread was buttered on they wouldn't be doing this they wouldn't be taking all this money from the State and the Crown  You must be aware of that stream of thinking  There is a sore sense of pride that you don't admit  I 'm quite certain that large numbers of people uh when when they  they had appalling housing on the Shankill Road never admitted that they were in appalling housing twenty and twenty-five years ago  But suddenly as a result of a whole lot of things happening in the outside world they began to see that their lot was just as bad as other people 's lots and so forth  And uhm  I think that we 're now sort of uh uh in we now in a situation where there 's all sorts of alienation  We so often talk about the alienation of the uh Roman Catholic or Nationalist community with Britain but there 's even an alienation now I think between  between Loyalists and Unionists from Britain an an alienation even between the haves and the have-nots  And I think that so often uh in in the Protestant areas especially you find that the the poverty lies behind swathes of area of considerable affluence  And we must be we must be aware of this and we must try and bring uhm a cohesion of the situation whereby something is done to ameliorate this situation  Now let me ask you uh uh briefly about some other aspects of of your address and  uh the moral crusade if I may so describe it  You you uh deliver an attack on obscenity  pornography  lack of privacy but don't  these uh don't those things pale set beside the obscenity of murder  violence  intolerance  bigotry and hate  The real villains of the piece in this community  Well of course obscenity  where does obscenity flourish most  It flourishes in the areas of sexuality  of cruelty and violence  The whole three are connected up together  And indeed uh uh uh very often it is sometimes  uh racketeering and paramilitary racketeering that uh cashes in on the shortcomings of other people  And we have heard of that uh of of them uh pirating uh videos and things like that to sell for their for their own ill-gotten gain and so forth  And uhm I I think that uhm  that that really there 's only a a a a thin paper wall between those three areas of sexuality cruelty and violence  So you you think that there there has to be a reconstruction as it were of moral values in the community  No I think the moral values are there but the facts are that  uhm uh so much has been happening in the community uhm through things like uhm uhm much more of uhm uh use of video and and film and so forth  uh and the cashing in on obscenity  I think that uh the film industry for years was in in some decline and now has uh through through the use of way-out producers have now begun to uhm uh produce  uhm films uh which have been condemned by a large circle of people  I mean Lord Rees-Mogg recently uhm sounded criticism of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's uh Terminator films  And so many other films too seem to highlight violence  I mean you 've only got to go to Silence of the Lambs and so forth  And people are beginning to I think see that the whole swing of the pendulum has gone far too far  and that that it begets violence  Yes I I just been uh  glancing through uh your uh address  Homosexuality I don't think is mentioned is it  Well I there 's a limit to what you can mention  laughter   No it 's just that the Moderator touched  on it  recently and said this this is a sin do not call it by any  other  Would you feel the same  Yeah well I   Yeah   No I think that I wouldn't ah I think that certainly it can be called sin certainly but there 's also a question that people are are are uh find themselves with these genes in their bodies and so forth and they 've got to learn to live with it  It 's only when it 's uh it 's only when it is uhm used wrongly  People cannot alter their genes  They can't alter their balance and so forth  I wouldn't want to go down that road too far but that wasn't  that wasn't the area which I was  dealing with in my address  You you talk about the portrayal of uhm somewhere you mention the portrayal of the the sexual act either on  stage  or or or on films  Yes   Yes privacy I think today is under threat  from all sorts of angles whether you think in terms of bugging devices and uh and uh many other ways and so forth  Is there not an inner sanctuary in a person 's life or in a married couple 's life which ought not to be public property  And I think that there 's nothing wrong with uh as I tried to say this morning there 's nothing wrong in in nudity at all  Nobody 's ever saying anything there 's anything wrong with that  I mean you can look at many ancient uhm  uhm statues in in in Egypt  You can look at many Middle Ages paintings and so forth which focus on human sexuality which can be beautiful and thought to be in good taste  I think that sometimes we Christian people can damage our cause not a little by uh over-reacting to all that nudity thing  The body human body is God-given God-made  It is beautiful but what makes it pornographic is when someone presents it to be nastily suggestive and alluring  And I think that is one of the the great problems is that  people today are stoking the flames of lust uh and sort of giving the impression to get and not to give  Yeah I 'm just wondering cos my last point is I wonder why  uh say a nude statue from ancient Greece would be considered beautiful and in good taste and perhaps a picture of an attractive young lady  in a newspaper would not  Is it because we are wrapping it up in a sort of classic package that it seems okay  Well I think there 's there there is a sort of uh there can be I think an abuse of women to a titillation of of uh making them the object of uhm  the use of men and so forth  I think that uhm  you can uh exploit and dehumanise sex you know  Well that was Bishop Poyntz and uh it 's his Diocesan  uh Meeting today and he spoke to me uh a little before that  Quite a number of issues there for you to think about
