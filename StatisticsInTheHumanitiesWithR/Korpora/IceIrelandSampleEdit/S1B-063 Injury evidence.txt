<S1B-063 Injury evidence>  I swear by Almighty God   That my evidence to this court   That my evidence to this court   Shall be the truth   Shall be the truth   The whole truth   The whole truth   And nothing but the truth   And nothing but the truth   Please state your full name  Harold McBrinn My Lord  Yes you may be seated Mr McBrinn  Mr McBrinn would you just state your occupation and your qualifications to My Lord  Yes uh I I 'm a chartered engineer My Lord  Now can you tell My Lord at the request of Messrs Quinn and Macmillan the plaintiff 's solicitors did you uh visit the Springfield Road in Belfast on the eighth of November nineteen ninety-nine  That 's correct My Lord  And can you tell My Lord  did you go alone or did anyone go with you  Uh no I was on my own  Uh I I called with the uh plaintiff but uh her mother informed me that she was ill at the time and could not attend  And did you have anything uh with you to indicate the uh locus where you were to carry out your inspection  Yes I used uh Mr Ridley 's black and white photographs uh to uh identify the uh location  And did you go to the part of the Springfield Road then shown in those three black and white photographs  That 's correct  Can you tell My Lord  uh did you uh locate the uh depression shown in the uh first of the black and white photographs  Yes the one with the rules in it yes  And can you tell me now did you measure the length width and depth of that depression  Yes it 's uhm  it it it obviously  it it dishes up and down so it 's uh seven to eight inches long  five to six inches wide and I measured the uh depth of the depression with a probe and measured it as an inch deep   And uh  3 sylls  evidence from the photographs but what what part of the footpath was it in in terms of uh location on the footpath  Central  And uh what kind of uh location is this  uh the Springfield Road  The Springfield Road would be uhm a fairly uh heavily pedestrianised area  It would take a lot of pedestrian traffic down into the town  Now can you say anything to My Lord in relation to the nature of the depression depression in terms of how visible or otherwise it is as one walks along  Well it 's  it depends on really the lighting conditions the the you know if it 's a dull day or whatever it is  But I mean it is the same  basically the same colour as the surrounding asphalt  Uh so it uh  it wouldn't be uh  you know it 's  if you 're looking directly at it  as with anything you 'll see it  But if you 're depending on your peripheral vision which is uh what most people do  then it 's difficult to pick up detail  Peripheral vision tends to pick at best a a  a difference in colour  And would you uh have anything to say to My Lord in terms of the effect of this depression for pedestrians walking along the footpath  Well it is  it is a a a sizeable uh depression  It 's uh  at its deepest point it I mean it will  because of the the the situation of the depression it will tend to fill up sort of seasonally and down with mud so it becomes uh uh visually sort of different and a as maybe days change  Uhm but if there 's just soft mud at the bottom of it it could be even more deceptive because the heel will just go straight through it  or the or the toe will go straight through it  So in my view yes it would be a hazard to pedestrians  Miss  2 sylls  described to My Lord that uh her heel or the heel of her shoe which she described to be heeled on a platform uh  so  that the heel of that went into the depression  Yes   Yes  is it the sort of depression that would uhm encompass or capture the the heel in the way she described  Well there is a difference in level of a as I measure it at its deepest point an inch  looking at Mr Ridley 's photograph it appears to be more like just over three quarters of an inch  Uhm I mean that would be enough to arrest any uh approaching foot  Could you uh form any impression in remembering June ninety-nine as to whether this was something which had just happened or something which had been there  I appreciate your just having the black and white photographs  Yes  In June nineteen ninety-nine  Well  uhm I would have uh  I 'd be of the impression that this is actually not something which has come about due to wear and tear  Uhm the general surface of the asphalt in that area uh is uhm  is quite rough uh uh  not the type of smooth surface you would tend to get with a well rolled impacted surface  And uh in my opinion the probably the most likely uhm uh situation is that this depression occurred very shortly after the asphalt was laid  in fact probably uhm within even hours or or certainly days of the asphalt laying and uh that type of depression can come about uhm due to air pockets being left in the asphalt  Sorry due to what  air pockets   Air pockets  If you  if you 're putting a batch of asphalt out on a footpath and then you put another batch out on on on a  on like and making a a momentary joint like a few minutes later or maybe you know if there isn't enough asphalt to complete the patch and you get some more in  what you can do is you can actually form an air  air pocket in around that and uh the uhm the three sort of uh defects which were referred to before if you notice are in a line across the footpath  And uh that would indicate to me  I 'm sorry what did you say  They they appear to be in a line across the footpath  There there are other similar ones across the  footpath   Yeah  there  well there there there are uh lesser uh sort of depressions on the footpath  several sylls  Are you taking that from these photographs   Well from the and I appreciate you 're going on the photographs and then seeing it  some  short time later  how long would it have been there approximately  Yes   I would say it has been there uhm from in around the time the asphalt was laid  Uh  Yes well leaving that aside  When would that have been approximately  In case there 's  there may be evidence  Several  several  years uh  My Lord  I can't say with any sort of exactness but several years I would suggest  It 's not a typical wear and tear type depression  Several years   I 've noted you said that  Well does it get progressively worse as time passes  That to me wouldn't  I would say that that depression formed uh  Within hours or days would you say  Yes within hours or  I would favour hours nearly more than days  It 's the sort of depression which comes if an air pocket if the asphalt is still hot  it will collapse  Yes that 's what I thought you were going to say  If one wanted to repair that defect that 's shown in the black and white photograph and in  several sylls  photograph  Yes  What what 's involved in repairing that  Uhm it 's basically  uh the the proper way to repair it is to cut out a a rectangle around it to give a good key of asphalt uhm around it and then uh basically prime the edge of the the cut out hole and uh re-lay the asphalt  Uh you would only need say a foot square or a foot by eight inches  something like that to  it 's quite isolated the the the fault so it would be really a a very short-time job for an asphalt crew  Thank-you  Mr McBrinn I think you said you were out in November nineteen ninety-nine  Is that right  Uhm I was out on the eighth of November nineteen ninety-nine  Five months or so after Mr Ridley was out  Is that right  Yes I believe he was out on the fifteenth of June nineteen ninety-nine  And uhm I think you said that you thought Mr Ridley 's photographs appeared to show something about three quarters of an inch or thereabouts  Yes  And uhm  did you look at exactly the same  Yes  Depression  Uhm and uhm if you were saying that perhaps it was in inch  there may not be very much in it one way or the other  but you were saying about an inch  Yeah well what you 'll get is you 'll find that the  the bottom of the  as you can see in Mr Ridley 's photographs that the mud will gather and that will either uh build up or clear out as  seasonally  So uh basically what I did just to to test the full depth was just to put a probe down  Was that into the mud  Into the mud yes  So that would account for the perhaps the discrepancy between the two  Oh yes I mean you can get a discrepancy seasonally and it could be less than Mr Ridley 's or it could be more  And uhm the  as far as width is concerned uh  it appears to be uh a nine or ten inch horizontal rule  It appears to be something in the region of what  eight or nine inches across  Unfortunately I don't have the black and white photographs in front of me so I  thank-you  Yes  I mean if you look at the horizontal rule on the right-hand side  it 's about seven and a half inches and on the left-hand side  maybe one and a half to two inches  It dishes down at that point  And as you use the the word yourself it is  it uh forms a dish or a shape of a dish  Most most depressions are  And it would be in the uh shape of a dish both directions  Yes  And that 's quite a contrary uh set of circumstances from say a sudden difference of level which you might get uh from a vertical edge  Yes well as I say most depressions do form a dish of some sort  I mean the only time you 'll really get a vertical edge on a footway is if there 's uh a classical pothole which is normally caused by frost action  by just a sheer  a sheer cut through into the asphalt  That 's a pothole  Yes but it  this is this is a depression  This is  I mean all depressions will be dished  They don't  they don't go in a square  3 sylls   several sylls  difference in level between flagstones  Yes  And uh the likelihood of catching your foot in something is much greater uh when it 's a vertical or a sudden difference of level of land than when it 's dished  Isn't that right  Yes if the vertical surface it 's safe I 'd say  reasonable to say that it 's more chance of trapping a toe for example or a heel  And uh if a department with limited resources tends to concentrate on that type of defect would that be something which you would see as a good thing
