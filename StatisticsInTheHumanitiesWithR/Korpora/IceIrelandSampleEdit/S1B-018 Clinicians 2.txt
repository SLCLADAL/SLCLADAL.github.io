<S1B-018 Clinicians 2>  uh  oh yeah so just in relation to  if you notice that there are like we 'll say that there 's one group member  like when I popped just into yours  Mm  Uh it did seem that Laura  was getting  now this is only the bit I saw  but she was talking a bit more than Ted and she tended to jump in even though you may have directed the question to him  Uh she had  I mean she knew the answer but she tended to kind of jump in  So  you 'd need to watch that she doesn't we 'll say dominate  within the group   Mm   Yeah you know  he improved a lot  though didn't he   Yeah it kind of  changed the other way  6 sylls   Okay  Yeah  But just to kind of try and ensure that it 's balanced like  that everyone gets their their turn or whatever  Okay any other questions now from this morning  What do we do if somebody says  sighs  I don't want to be here  laughter   Mm   Now  who was saying like they didn't want to  be there   Kim  initially didn't know why he was there  and he didn't want to be there  this type  Like so I don't want to be there and everybody seemed like   2 sylls    Okay   Oh so he  was missing woodwork  was it  And then   Was like and then  I said to him don't worry  We won't be doing that again  Do you feel better  said oh yeah I do now   Oh yes the time   There 's a  guy  in my group who  wouldn't  Tom wouldn't miss woodwork either  To   Now what time is he  does he have woodwork at though  What time did I go in at  so it was at eleven forty  He has woodwork at eleven  forty  Oh yeah and we have him down for the  well  we have to change that group anyway  because   Mm   Mm   Especially so  because Ted wants the earlier  would prefer the earlier slot because he has woodwork at twenty past twelve  And then the  well you see the two  there are two people in your group at eleven forty  who go for counselling  at twelve so we need to change that group anyway   Okay  So we could conceivably switch that to five past eleven   And then Fred Lappin has woodwork at twelve forty  no twelve twenty    4 sylls  yeah   Okay   Okay   Twenty   and wasn't impressed  That 's fair enough  I can understand that  Tom O'Byrne has woodwork at eleven forty  Okay so we 'll just have to  your groups 'll stay the same but the timing will be different   possibly  more than likely  Mm   Because uhm it was a bit confusing today because my group was earlier   I was like oh what do you have  at eleven or whatever  And I think  Laura was on about that she had reading with Mr Duffy  And then I was there  oh maybe you 're not going to have it now  I don't know   I think but   Well   Right well I think  that today is all because Melanie brought the people  Mm yeah that was my fault  No it doesn't matter like  but it just meant that you know  it things sort of went  in the order we were  anticipating  Uhm so hopefully Tim Duffy will have the appointment cards for the students  for next week so that they 'll just know the time and they 'll arrive  But we 'll have to give them the updated schedule  Okay uh so then you just need to go and plan yeah  what are you going to do for next week  So for the people who are doing  literacy yeah I mean uh  I can't really say any more than what 's in this  already  so a higher level of particularly phoneme  It was just  2 sylls    In synch   Yeah   Do you know the way when you  I mean that 's a higher level but at the moment  I don't know how much phonemes they know or they don't know about phoneme  several sylls  So I am just going start at  step one  I mean we might fly through step one two and three   Yeah  But I 'm just going to literally start with the alphabet  like   Yeah  because the work kind of up until Christmas really is diagnostic  And it 's a kind of  just finding out at what level they 're operating at  and so that you can kind of pitch your therapy then at  the right  level  Yeah  3 sylls    Yeah   So is step one like alphabet  kind of  grapheme phoneme  correspondence    3 sylls    That 's   yeah  Okay so syllable organisation  your phonemes within clusters  so that 's literacy group one  but literacy group two then however  that 's the same thing but more syllable  Okay so the vocabulary work then  Yeah look at things like  there 's downstairs you know the uh Vanilla Vocabulary I think it 's called  Yeah I looked at the vocabulary maps  That 's another one  so like would I actually start with stuff like that  Oh absolutely  yeah   Yeah  and just get  like just get them working on the English vocabulary and geography vocabulary  or whatever   Yeah  and like using kind of multi-modal   that  It 's not just the written word  You may have pictures to go along with  it  or a story that puts the words in  context  Uhm and as you 're also talking about uhm  like that 's written here  so word families  So you might talk about nouns  adjectives  uhm  words that mean almost the same as  Okay   that  if you 're talking about  uhm let me think  word from geography like exploration  was one of the ones I did last year  So you 've exploration in terms of going to Antarctica  as  an explorer  but  you 've exploration in terms of oil wells and  you know that kind of  thing  that you give them like  the range of meanings for the word  and then maybe if it 's  and if it 's appropriate words that mean almost the same or words that are the  opposite  Oh  okay  So they 're kind of establishing those  links  semantically  Uhm and again anyone get got uh  you got an English book didn't you   Uhm   2 sylls   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Okay   Yeah   Yeah   Mm   Yeah    Okay   Mm   Okay   Yeah   6 sylls   Oh okay  Like should I read the whole book  You know    I 'd say  scan  Yeah  For the word  j  I can't scan  I don't know  I can't do that  Well then pick a chapter  and  Oh hang on it 's the whole of I mean you just got the  the book The Outsiders out  Sorry yeah  Thought you meant a textbook  Then I 'd read the first chapter  Okay   And the last chapter  Yeah exactly  laughter  and see  you know  what kind of  the kind of vocabulary  You 're working on expressive language isn't it  Yeah  I would look at the kind of vocabulary that 's  cropping up  So the vocabulary to watch out for   and can  do they   And I suppose if there 's  any examples of figurative language that I  can  2 sylls    Absolutely  yeah  Okay so it doesn't just have to be like English and  geography words or  whatever  you know  Discu  I suppose having from today hopefully you have  discussed with them  you know  what are the kind of things that they find easy  Which things do they find difficult in terms of subjects  Are there  any subjects  in particular that they like  And you could always kind of take a subject that they like and target the vocabulary  in that   subject  Uh just one thing to do  or another thing to do with vocabulary as well is when you 're teaching it  if you 're going to give  Like giving a definition is really only one way of knowing a word  Okay  So and often then what happened last year was that if you went to the dictionary to define the word  the first definition in the dictionary  wasn't  necessarily the one that you had intended to teach  So  just to watch out for that kind of thing  and  so getting them to use the word in a sentence as well  it 's not enough to just be able to define it  but  can they use it  and just be clear as well yourself about the definition of the  word  like we talked about this morning in relation to the  figurative language   Yeah   Yeah   Okay   Yeah   Yeah   is wrong   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Mm  to take a back seat  Yeah that we had different ideas as to what it meant  Yeah okay   So that 's vocabulary  so there 's yeah Vanilla Vocabulary downstairs and the vocabulary with  what do they call it  Vocabulary maps  Vocabulary maps yeah  There is a programme as well  now I don't know if we have it any more  or maybe they have it in the school  called Inspiration  And it 's just it 's doing that kind of vocabulary mapping on a computer programme   it 's very good cos you can organise  Okay   It 's on computer here is it  I don't  think so   I think  Felice had the programme or something  Yeah and you could get it for a trial  period  or whatever  but then it  goes out  Uh like it self-destructs after however many days  laughter   Yeah   What  Not really  That 's like  laughter  I thought you were  laughter   And this CD  if you do  survive it will self-destruct  laughter  No it 's sort  of it 's    3 sylls  dangerous   It 's all  confidential  laughter  You can only have it for a certain amount of time  No you yeah exactly you can only use if for  thirty  days or whatever  Uhm  okay the expressive language group then uh  that 's you isn't it  Vera  Okay so the figurative language  uhm now uh  And again there is that book downstairs Saying One Thing Meaning  Another  And there 's a I 'm sure there 's another one on figurative language down there as well   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   There 's one about  cartoons   There  is yeah  Yeah maybe that 's  the one I 'm thinking   There 's a few  Yeah there 's other cartoons  there   Yeah  so there 's plenty of  materials  there like whatever  Yeah   Should I be like  like  say for my individual level like I want to be hitting like  say her reader and vocabulary  figurative language  and literacy  Should I be spending ten minutes in each of those four areas  That 's a  Yeah you can decide  to do it like that   Is that what I should be trying to do  or should I be focusing on one  or two a week and  Well I think I 'd like  I 'd leave that up to you to decide  See what you think is  Which is more efficient   Cos I don't want to totally boggle her either  you know   Yeah  exactly  So you don't want to have too much  I think it 's a good idea to actually specify how long you 're going to spend on each  activity  because then you have your session nicely structured and you know how much time you have  cos  the time  of course  is important as  well  And I know today was different but that that you 're ready to  once we have the  room that you 're ready to start so that you know you 've ten minutes for this ten minutes for this  and you 're keeping an eye on the time and you know  okay I have to finish at twenty to twelve  and then you 're ready to finish  Mm   Mm   Yeah
