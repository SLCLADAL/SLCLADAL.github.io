<S2A-004 Heineken Cup>  Well good evening to you Jack  I think little Zach Ward somewhat overcome with emotion  and we all remember that wonderful night in the quarter final in December of nineteen ninety-eight against Toulouse when Andy got the call and he went over had a word with Martin McCall and then the then Chief Constable of what was then the RUC  Sir Ronnie Flanagan said  take my car Andy and off you go to hospital and Zach arrived  Well he 's here tonight  he 's four years and a bit  and his dad is leading Ulster in this their forty-fifth Heineken Cup game and one of the most crucial in which they 've ever played  A big night for Andy Ward  a big night for the faithful who as ever have turned up in their thousands and indeed more than tens of thousands  The referee this evening from France  the man who did the Heineken final in the year two thousand  Monsieur Joel Dumet  He 's been here at Ravenhill before but this is a huge night for both sides  A win for Northampton is a must for them  a win and an impressive win for Ulster will be the only thing that will suffice if Ulster are to progress into the Quarter Finals  something they haven't done since they won the cup away back in nineteen ninety-nine  Good thundering drive by Northampton right from the outset  Vastly experienced pack remember they got  that 's a nice little chip into space  this could be awkward for Ulster  Leslie hesitated slightly the skipper  clever use of the ball  That was Mark Connors the Australian who played in the World Cup final in nineteen ninety-nine and that 's not a bad kick  And Neil Doak  did he let that go over for the twenty-two  Indeed he did  That was a close call Philip  Very close call indeed Jim  and uh obviously Northampton are setting out the stall plenty of variety  We see Connors here actually chipping through uh and the chase is on and Neil Doak did extremely well getting back and just timing that to perfection to touch down  Yeah Nick Beal was right on top of him  So here 's uh David Humphreys  Ulster 's outside half  who 's also the top try scorer for Ulster in the Heineken Cup  The wind just has taken that back and the Ulster side play on again says the referee  Northampton almost claimed that on the ground  Well referee Joel Dumet saying in pretty decent English  you 're coming in from the wrong side  Former Cantabrian Mat Sexton who has been in the middle of the Ulster front row all season  Ulster playing into a  a pretty  pretty stiffish breeze  Back it came  It was uh claimed on the ground by Sexton  oh yeah very definitely offside by Northampton  First uh crucial line out  Wonderful take by Jeremy Davidson  That was magnificent  Rob Kenson does the tidying for Ulster  But Northampton have restricted any Ulster forward movement  That 's a little bit better  away they go  Andy Ward  legs pumping  Humphreys  inside to McMillan  Northampton lining up for the young Ulster flanker  referee I think has given the penalty but he 's playing the advantage  Jeremy Davidson  still playing advantage  Humphreys  Sheldon Coulter  beats the first tackle and the penalty I think is going to be given  Well I think Mr Dumet had to bring it back at some stage  He was giving uh Ulster every opportunity to uh make progress upon the  uh across the game line  Initially started by Andy Ward but great support by the rest of the team  So uh Ulster have this position just on uh the Northampton ten metre line playing into a very stiff breeze  It 'll be interesting just to see what Andy Ward and David Humphreys decide to do  Well tries of course are what Ulster really need as well as a victory but I think three points at this stage might just settle everybody and Ulster would get their noses in front  And certainly during the week Alan Solomons was emphasising  yes we want to qualify but the important thing is to win this game  The the win is is so important Jim  particularly uh at this stage of the season  The points can uh we can look after the points as the match progresses  So if uh David Humphreys can uh retain his composure  relax into this kick and and certainly put three points on the board it will settle this Ulster team down  Well this would take David Humphreys to  by my reckoning  three hundred and twenty Heineken Cup points  He hasn't wasted any time  he 's got right onto that  Touch judges have a good look at each other and decide that was just slightly off-target  Frank Marciano and Stefan Comaret  Certainly had the length with that kick Jim  just a little bit uh off direction but uh David  several sylls  gets his timing right and uh makes very sweet contact   Paul Grayson just indicating that his forwards have got to be behind him  Well he 's really gone for a bit of length  Well taken by Humphreys  There 's an air of confidence about David Humphreys so far this evening  He 's given that a lot of height  He needs red  men in red and white underneath him  Well stripped in by Ulster  James Topping did well  Well rescued by Doak himself  The blue scrum half Topping obliges  Constable  Not sure that Northampton have the straight offside  Better work by the Ulster pack  Good pick-up and drive   Ulster keeping it fairly tight  A bit of fancy footwork there  But the penalty has gone against Ulster for holding on in the tackle  And it may well have been Tony McWhirter the last man up  Yeah I think the problem was there Ulster were trying to keep the ball very tight  use the tight channels and take the uh the confrontation to this Northampton pack  Here we can see Ryan Constable trying to pop a ball uh but Tony McWhirter driving for it  Andy Ward again picking up uh and again it 's uh it 's Mat Sexton going forward not Kempson  And uh here the drive and the momentum  Ulster just trying to recycle the ball quickly and it pops to Tony McWhirter  Unfortunately a little bit isolated uh as James Topping pulls in but unfortunately just holding on that little bit too long  Well the ensuing penalty has been put into touch by uh Paul Grayson  Tony McWhirter  former skipper of the Ireland under twenty-one Triple Crown winning side  That 's not a great line out for Northampton  Andy Ward pulls it in  First knock forward according to Monsieur Dumet was by a green hand which is Northampton and Ulster will get the scrummage so an unchanged Ulster pack from the one that uh gave Cardiff the runaround last week  Joel Dumet not happy that uh Northampton charged in  That 's going to be a free kick cos they 're not observing  several sylls  study and engage rule  That was uh Simon Best who took it on for Ulster  Good call by Humphreys  Didn't make full contact  Now this is uh Northampton 's top try scorer  big Ben Cohen  And big Ben  1 syll  straight into touch  Not the sort of man you want to give the ball to Philip with a bit of room  Definitely not  But uh there 've been uh rumours this week about him uh being coached by NFL and if he shows that skill set I don't think he 'll be moving anywhere outside Northampton  well somebody from the  NFL reckoned that at six feet two and some uh sixteen odd stones he would make the perfect wide receiver  But in American football you don't actually have to kick the ball at all which is maybe not a bad thing  Good take by Longwell  nice variation again by Ulster  Both their jumpers have won their takes out of touch  Here 's Doak  Humphreys  Northampton up very quickly  Shane Stewart 's just got across that game line  Well Northampton really swarming all over Ulster  They 've worked hard on their defence all week  I watched them at the Belfast Harlequins Club just uh yesterday afternoon when they spent most of their session in defence and this is a good drive by Ulster  Neil Doak  now Humphreys  good call  Bryn Cunningham  taken by Jorgensen  And they 've got to come all the way back for the penalty  and it 's a penalty to Ulster  Good control by Ulster  again recycling the ball well  keeping it nice and tight  using the tight channels  And then when the opportunity was right David Humphreys spotted the gap wide and tried to move to Bryn Cunningham  Good work by the Ulster pack  a terrific piece of uh forward driving  And look at the body positions of Ulster  Alan Solomons and Adrian Kennedy will be well pleased with that  Uh Northampton closing Ulster down very quickly indeed  Peter Jorgensen up first and the penalty was given   Obviously a little bit unsettling for David Humphreys there  the ball just knocking down so he just really needs to take his time and compose himself  a very important kick  Not giving himself uh much of a run-up to it  That 's another good strike into a stiffish breeze  Will it hold  It will hold but it hasn't again quite got the accuracy  So two attempts from uh long range  two difficult angles  Humphreys not too far away  Somebody on the mobile phone there I think just uh telling everybody at home what 's happening  Don't know why they 're  not watching this programme  Well here comes Grayson  Once again he 's given that a fair old thump  This time it 's uh Bryn Cunningham  Attempted a dummy which uh just about worked and no more  Good support from Davidson now Humphreys  That 's clever by Humphreys  Well positioned though on the far side  And Nick Beal has given that an absolute wallop  And that is a terrific kick by Beal  Northampton do it seems have the advantage of quite a stiffish breeze  This is the former uh England fullback  capped fifteen times for his country and a member of the World Cup side in uh nineteen ninety-nine  Yeah unfortunately for Humphreys there the ball just didn't really put  uh Doaks under any pressure  Nick Beal was able to uh take his time pick his spot and use the elements to get a very very good and very effective touch kicking  That 's another cracking take by Jeremy Davidson despite the attentions of uh big Steve Williams  current Welsh international  This is another good piece of Ulster forward play  They have the ball in their possession  For Topping to chase the wind might uh take it into touch  Topping was underneath it but so too were three men in green and black  Here comes Colin  Andy Ward with a tackle  Grayson  Leslie the skipper  mis-move Beal this is James Brookes  Coulter went far too high  Grayson at scrum half  Good little spell this  There 's the dangerman taken by Gary Longwell  Tom Smith  wonderful soft hands from the front forward  Smith at scrum half  Grayson on his own  looking for Ben Cohen  Good challenge here goes Humphreys  Came off the Northampton hand  Humphreys might get to this first  Wonderful piece of covering by the England international hooker Steve Thompson  Well great pressure defence by Ulster  Of course Grayson into the option of trying to chip for Ben Cohen  And uh again here we can just see it  it 's it 's Grayson chipping over the top and the ball is just hanging up there  Very very difficult for a winger to judge and there was David Humphreys just picking it up  looking at his options and then chipping it down to touch and it actually came off
