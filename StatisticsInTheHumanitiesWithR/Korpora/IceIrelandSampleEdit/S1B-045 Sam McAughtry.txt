<S1B-045 Sam McAughtry>  Well now uh to return to the house for a moment uhm  presumably uh you had gas lighting  uh in the house at that time  We had gas lighting  Uh I suppose I would put it about nineteen thirty-four  when electrification began  Until then we had gas lighting with mantles everywhere and sometimes no mantle  If the mantle broke you just let the the gas  gutter away there the raw flame  And what about cooking  Was cooking done  by gas   Gas  gas cooker  There were there were little  uh additions  uh for for this came in I would think about nineteen thirty thirty-one  Those men who worked in or about the shipyard  uh they were nearly all labourers in the district where I was born and brought up  We didn't have tradesmen in the shipyard but quite a few worked as labourers in the shipyard  And they would get tradesmen to make little contraptions  a sort of a cross a metal cross with holes drilled into them  which were fitted on to the gas pipe  you lit the gas came through these little holes and you lit them and you had this little burning cross and on top of that you laid your griddle  which was the first gas griddles  Before that  the griddle was used just on the bare flames on the hob  then on the griddle of course you baked your soda bread and potato bread and you baked your tarts and stuff like this you know and uh  that was that was the sort of uhm  cooking and baking and lighting that we had up until about nineteen thirty-four thirty-five when electrification came in  Well now what about heating in the house  Heating in the house just came from the one fire  There was no heating apart from the fire  Uh there were in uh a hot water bottle in bed was the ordinary stone hot water bottle or a hot brick wrapped in a an old cloth socks  You wore  uh very heavy bedclothes  Overcoats on the beds was quite commonplace  We believed in those days that uh weight  was the whole thing and the heavier your bedclothes the warmer you were but uh sleeping in socks wasn't out of the ordinary at all  Well now would you say that the house was cold uncomfortable  Uh most most uncomfortable  I mean tempers were lost  around the fire  The whole family huddled around the fire  It it helped  uh the spirit of a family a good deal  It brought us close together but it caused trouble too  Because when the fire needed coal  it was a certainty that if uh my mother ordered me to go out and get a shovel of coal  and I had a good seat beside the fire when I came back with the shovel of coal somebody 'd pinched it  And I 'd find myself furthest away from the fire sitting on the sofa or somewhere and this this is  laughter  all sorts of rows and arguments about this  But that was the sole source of heat in the house  Uh the upstairs fires were never lit except in sickness  This was an indication of sickness  coughs  Pardon me  a sure indication of sickness in the house was the bedroom fire lit  Well now what about the general overall standard of the housing in in Cosgrave Street  How would you describe Cosgrave Street in terms of other housing in Belfast at that time  I would say it was uh just about  with the exception of an area around Millfield in Belfast  and uh one or two areas  which dated from the original old Belfast from the eighteen hundred thereabouts you know  even earlier than eighteen hundred  the housing in in north Belfast and in particular in the area where I lived it  known as Tiger Bay where I lived must 've been the lowest  uh quality housing in the city  Uh would you describe the houses as being on the whole well-cared for  when you looked at them when you looked at the street from the outside or when you went inside  would you say the houses were well-kept well-cared for  In general no  The the reason for this is that uh  I lived in a Protestant area and people always believe  that Protestants were neat and tidy in their habits  And indeed near the shipyard  you would see houses to this day that were beautifully kept neat and tidy and cleaned and uh kept well-painted every twelfth of July  There was a routine  And to some extent in the area where I lived some repainting went on at the twelfth of July and we had a good many people in the street  who kept their houses neat and tidy but we had an awful lot more who didn't  Uh this ties up with the fact that we were not very well off even by Protestant standards  The streets around us when you left this little area where I lived  you and you were still in Protestant territory but when you went to Adam 's Street  Hogarth Street  Merview Street and the streets closer to Duncairn Gardens from where we were  you were in an area where where shipyard tradesmen were were quite common every seventh or eighth house  And uh this  this was reflected on more uh the people knew  they had more money and they knew where it was coming from  It wasn't much more but it was enough to make that difference  And it it  the people in those houses outside our area kept their houses nice and neat and clean and it had the look of it  But in our area because we weren't all that privileged and because there wasn't work for us  our menfolk tended to be away from home  They worked across the water or they were seafaring like my father and my brother  And with the men out of the house whether that was the reason for the loss of interest in the house I don't know but  all up and down the streets where I lived  were houses that were not cared for at all  Well what about uh the rents that uh you had to pay for for your house  The rent of our house was four and tuppence a week  And that would 've been common for the street  Yeah that would 've been average  Between four to six shillings I would 've thought  Right and what what sort of people apart you mentioned uh seafaring people what other sort of people would 've been living in your street at that time  All sorts of   We had a man  coughs  pardon me we had a man living opposite us who was a bailiff  His job was to throw people out for non-payment of rent  We 'd another man living opposite us who shovelled coal in the uh gasworks  He was a labourer  And uh one night he came back and everybody thought he was drunk and it was the effects of the gas  There had been a gas leak in the gasworks on the Ormeau Road and uh  the his wife thought he 'd been drinking and uh he collapsed and very nearly died  Another man we had was a tailor  He he worked downtown  in a basement and he made uh clothes as a tailor  Uh we had  men there who 'd never worked  You know they just had got out of the habit of working  They just spent their day  mooching around down in the the near near uh  the the shores of Belfast Lough  They had these plots workmen 's plots  where you could grow things  And these men seemed to spend half their time down there  They didn't bother looking too much looking for work  They would live off the proceeds of their son 's wages  and so on  Sometimes the women worked part-time in the mills  There was plenty of work for boys incidentally  because as a uh I was describing the the  great many shops  that were in existence  Uh all the whole streets of Belfast not just the centre but radiating right the whole way out throughout the city were rows and rows of shops thousands of them  all in competition and these shops all employed message boys  It was about a fifty-hour week for about five shillings  The equivalent of twenty-five pence today  And uh unlike nowadays when the housewife is expected to go to a shop or a supermarket  pack her own stuff in a basket  line up  and pay for it  on the way out  in those days they sent boys like us  to knock the customers ' doors  and say  I 'm from such and such a shop  What would you like me to bring you  And she would tell us the order  We 'd go back to the shop pack it up in a basket and carry it out and deliver it to her  So there was plenty of work for the likes of us  And it was useful because  the the money that I would earn as a message boy paid the rent  which was uh quite a help in those days  Well now as far as the interior of the house is concerned  did you have a wireless at that time in the house  I can remember  I can remember the wirelesses coming  They they 're old-fashioned uh  cats whiskers set  crystal set it was called  Now that was the very first form of wireless that uh  reached the common people  And there were very few of those  One man on our street had one and it was a bit of a curiosity  You had to listen to them with earphones  And when the more popular radio came in  it came in rather slowly in our district  but I would put that  at about nineteen thirty-two thirty-three  I remember carrying the wet battery round to be recharged  And I would 've been eleven or twelve  That would 've made it nineteen thirty  two or thirty three  Uh they were quite popular  When hire purchase came in  uh in nineteen thirty-four thirty-five  and offers were made for half a crown down you can buy a  a a radio set  this is when the electrical radios or the the dry battery  was beginning to give way to the electric radio uh  they offered these sets at half a crown down and so much a week  And lots of the people round our district got their husbands to sign for this half a crown deposit  And paid a half a crown got the radio set and of course they couldn't keep up the payments  laughter  And the whole district was was aloud with noise  You know the  they talk about the hills are alive with the sound of music well the streets were alive with these radios  laughter  And uh and they came around and took them all away from them again because they couldn't keep up their payments  Well there wouldn't have been presumably any other kind of uh  electrical or other uh  labour-saving devices in the house at that time  No  In the kitchen for example what what was the kitchen like  I mean could you describe it for us  Well the kitchen there would be a table underneath the window and there was a sofa  on the wall opposite that  The sofa was always drawn up beside the fire alongside the fire  And uh there was always what we called a cabinet and became known later as a sideboard  And that was as you entered the room always  as you entered the room from the hall  Some of the houses had a longish hallway and others like ours had nothing  It just had a little square hallway about five feet square  And you  uh the the stairs ran right into the hallway  so that if you ran too fast down the stairs it just took one step and you were out into the street
