<S1B-080 Student meeting>  now Clinical Medicine though is a bit of a different story  Clinical Medicine  there are  there 's a lot of stuff going on that is problematic  Uhm Orla  who will be listening to this  Can you omit certain bits and pieces of it  It 's all highly confidential and they don't care about the content  It 's just the structural  structure of Hiberno-English  Do we have to be serious about those forms  What do you mean  Adrian  laughter   Okay that 's fine okay that 's fine  Come in  2 sylls  Okay uhm in Medicine I 'm getting hospital IDs  we don't get hospital IDs from Saint James 's  I need to acquire them  We 've been talking a little bit about that before  I 've made progress actually I 've been talking to the CEO in Saint James 's  He was down in Kilkenny  oh yeah yeah we were in Kilkenny you know and he goes oh yeah that 's right  have a chat  so I 'm  getting  I 'm getting progress on that  Sorry   several sylls    several sylls   Sorry  several sylls   Mr Cahill  No that 's Nab  no no no  Fre  Fred O'Regan  Oh yeah  He was on my working group  He 's small and boring  He 's a  very nice man    several sylls    Lesbians  Sh  Right anyway back to the subject at hand  Another problem in Medicine is the  is Simpson  Professor Simpson is determined to introduce a surgery exam by the end of this year in complete contravention  in complete contravention of the college calendar  Now he really is delusional  probably some sort of psychotic break he 's had because he thinks he can just bypass the college calendar  which is absolute rubbish  And it 's something that I will actually have to face him down on and it 's not something I 'm looking forward to because he 's a  I don't  he 's he 's very odd and he 's a bit kind of vindictive  It 's going to be fun  fifth year  sixth year  they 're kind of ticking along  There 's too much focus on  fourth year because they want to fix it therefore fifth year are neglected  Someone has to suffer  Someone has to suffer and sadly people have to suffer  But that 's pretty much it    nursing  the biggest thing from the first years is their classroom size  too small  too crowded  And their schedule  because it 's booked so late they 've early  early starts and late finishes so their day is actually very long  That 's all I 've got from them so far  Mhm  But uhm  the biggest problem with me is actually contacting students  I 've had resistance as I said to you from the tutors already  They don't want me to contact them through classrooms  so they  want me to go through Trinity  and I 'm not authorised yet to access the email listings   several sylls   so hopefully soon  Hopefully soon  hopefully soon  That 'll open up the channel of communication  I 'll be able to get somewhere then  get more topics going  Okay well just get on to Stephanie Brennan and the various course co-ordinators and just try and sort that there out  They know all know about the situation  They all know about me yeah  They all know about you so it 's just really tackle it from there  Well just go  but I mean like  whenever I hit a brick wall what I do is actually I go to the person at the top and then you work your way down from the top  to   Are  you not meant to start from the bottom and work your way up Tom  No but you 'll hit  they 'll just say no and then you 'll you 'll spend  three layers going through   But as you you hit a blank wall  you just go up higher   No but you you just  you you hit resistance  then you hit resistance then you hit resistance  because the one at the top can tell the one at the very bottom  So you don't have to through the whole chain of demand  The one at the top  just says   But could  you not piss a lot of people off when you 're doing it that way  Yeah that 's  that 's what I 've been told  You can piss a lot of people off  you have to  you have to be tactful   Cos like I 'm told I have to go to staff  meetings  school committee  faculty exec   several sylls    That 's for big decisions  but if you 've a problem that needs solved such as getting in contact  with students   Oh yeah that 's fair enough  You just go  straight up   I mean I know that my  I 'm not just doing I can't do my  act out my role when I can't contact the  students  And then they 've heard of me  I know that they know there 's somebody appointed but they 've no contact with  me either   Yeah   Yeah   ge  get on to Stephanie Brennan  anyway  and sort it with her  You you actually are in a unique role by  having  such a lot of people lot of people to deal with   Mm   Yeah  I 've already spoken to a lot of  I was actually   I was lecturing psychiatry students from Pat 's  Brendan 's and uhm Saint Loman 's last week so I spoke to all of them and gave them all my email address like  for any student issues but they haven't got back to me on any yet  So they know about me anyway  There probably won't be very much going on in the School of Nursing that is problematic  Most of your role will be helping out the School of Nursing in the whole faculty  perspective   anyway   Yeah   Once they know   I think  Once they know about me and can contact me it  should be   It 's unfortunate as well  because of nursing you 're going to run into problems with  they 're going to be under pressure from the government to try and get as many nurses in as they can  Yeah  So they 're always going to throw that back to you  Och Jesus  laughter   I suppose it  it 's going to  and obviously you talked before about starting up a nursing society  That 'll all come in time  as they come   That will that will  we 'll we 'll work on that  By the end of this year we 'll have  one set up   Do they want to  go under the therapy society  They 're an awful large crowd  There 's a huge amount  I mean I 've  I 've been given like fifteen like  I 've been given a list of just thirty student reps already  What  Oh wow  That I 've  that are under me  I actually have their names representing midwifery and and I 've thirty names already I 've been given  Mm  And uh that 's not including most of the post-grads  that 's all undergraduates and  How many are there altogether anyway  undergrads  I think it 's fifteen hundred students in total  Oh my God  Oh yeah  There 's going to be there 's going to be over two and a half thousand in four years ' time  There 's fifteen hundred at the moment and there 's thirty reps  the names I 've been given   That 's why  yeah  that 's why it 's very important to get a handle on the whole nurses ' course now  But I 've  I 've already written to Drogheda and the Rotunda  like to the school of whatever  the School of Nursing to let them know about me and try and get the reps  you know  to register with the students union but I 've heard nothing back  Just keep  just just keep plugging on that one but  co-ordinate with Stephanie  Have you have you actually met her yet  Yeah I did  In Kilkenny yeah  Well now get  on the nineteenth of November we 'll be meeting everybody anyway  So get onto them there  anything else  No that 's it for the moment  Your good self Adrian  What 's to report  Big strike in Dental Hospital  Has that started   It 's  in the second week now  Well   How many  There 's talk of it being resolved by next week  There 's going to be a lot of talk on  this matter   Who 's striking  and why  Part-time staff  Uhm  Administration  Or  clinical staff  clinical teachers  Okay  Well not just clinical teachers  all the part-time teaching staff  Uhm  What exactly do they want  They want recognition of  their teaching  They want uh  But all you have to  Certify as uh  do you remember we discussed this in  Kilkenny   Mm  unclear   It wasn't  I wasn't  I wasn't in this group anyway  Yeah but still we all went to the other groups  I remember that yeah  the one about retentions of  part-time staff  was certification of teaching and teaching abilities and all that kind of stuff  They want that  Uhm apparently they 're also getting  which the students don't really know  is that they 're also getting a hundred percent pay increase as well  Yeah   Yeah   Well you see it 's money that uh that really cannot be changed  I mean it goes through  it comes from the Department of Health  their salary as teachers   that really cannot be changed   I don't think it 's our concern though  is it  Those people striking  I mean it 's not like   Yes it is   We can't do anything about it though    several sylls    cos I 'm losing clinics at the moment   you 're affected by it  but us as convenors  we 're not important enough   Orla Orla Orla you 'd be   We are important enough because we make ourselves important enough  Yeah   It 's a huge role  that 's only  You see the thing is is  the thing though is that  the thing that you must appreciate is that when you have a deadlock between the staff and other staff  it 's the students who 'll push the balance  But us sitting here and calculating how the college are going to come up with the funds to  increase their   Next week 's meeting 's in Astronomy   We wouldn't be where we are now actually if I hadn't  if I hadn't been pressing so much and actually surprised myself  every second week  at what I managed to get  You know  No I understand   Yeah  you can't  You can't you can't be successful unless you actually really try  All you can do  is fail  you know  No I 'm not I 'm   I 'm not querying that Tom  I 'm just saying that  as regards the money  I don't think that 's our issue  We can't we can't we can't we can't deal with the money  That money 's fixed  I mean the money   several sylls   in terms of status we can change   several sylls    We have no control over it   But in terms of college and students in college starting industrial disputes  the library dispute last year wouldn't have been solved if it wasn't for last year 's education officer  actually  getting in and talking to the two parties and getting them to talk to each other  So there is an important role for students  and student reps to sort out   Yeah   There was  last year  last year there actually was  several words   several words  say that Orla  I 'm sorry  I 'm sorry  Mea culpa  There was and actually last year  talking about that library debate  there was an ultimatum given by the Students ' Union  and that was finally what solved it interruption - person enters   You made it simultaneous speech   Introductions  This is our crazy postgrad person  Sorry I 'm late but I had to meet somebody else  So  I 'm recording this uhm for college  Do you mind signing a permission slip  Introductions  This is ah  Introductions  I know you  You are a Dent aren't you  That 's the one  You were at Roger Lee 's drinks weren't you business stops; transcription interrupted   We reach  we 'll reach we 'll reach crisis point  we 'll reach crisis point Adrian where when  when do you have to start making up for this time in remedial  As far as I know we 're allowed to miss about four sessions  I think that 's what they 've kind of safeguarded for us before we 've to start doing remedial in the summer  And so how many sessions have you missed so far  Two and three is scheduled for Monday  And does that mean that you can never miss a clinic for the rest of the year  As in like  you know the way it was for no fault of  your own   Yeah  I 'm not actually sure
