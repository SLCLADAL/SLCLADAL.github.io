Is it on  Do you remember that 's where Gerry went and got altitude sickness or  something like that   Oh right   Oh yeah   Yeah  it would probably  uh you you 're supposed to take a week to get

laughter   That 's uhm  I was actually listening to a thing on Radio Four the other day  about this about people who had uh $D is offered wine   Yes please  You 're driving  Aw no  She is  Have you passed your driving test  No I have not  Oh sorry  Right  laughter  And that 'll be a and don't you ask any more questions  about that   Yes well   Mummy you 're sitting in the back  That 's alright  And I 'll sit beside her so she doesn't  get nervous  Mummy 's mummy 's been driving with her  She 's very good  Oh yeah I 've been  I 've been out  with her   Oh no  no no no  We had a bit of an altercation on the last time we  were coming home   I thought you  were out  you went out once and you were back five minutes later  I didn't know you were   you 'd been out again   That was when we were away   She took  a strop  You know when we were away  Not me  Because you were sitting gripping the thing and working the pedals  never said    3 sylls    What you  need 's a Saab  The  old Saab nine hundreds used to have a dummy brake pedal for nervous passengers in the front  the front  laughter  Yeah  Apparently there was some it was some bit of psychology the Swedes invented in the nineteen sixties and seventies  If you were a nervous passenger you had your own brake pedal  I suppose the worrying thing was then you realised it did bugger-all you know  laughter  you were stamping your foot down and absolutely nothing happened  Who   Really   Worry beads would be just as good  That kind of thing or one of those elastic twangers for your  Sure she drove here from uh  from here   That 's what  you know when we were away  She drove from here  the last day   Oh right  I thought you just went out that  that  one time  Ah one   She drove home from Mass Sunday as well sure  Were you not in the car  No  She 's very good  isn 's  she  Walking  Oh right  She 's very good  I 'm sure she 'll I mean she 's not the one I 'm worried about  It 's you  laughter   Och I 'll just walk then  I 'll dander on over  Are you doing it soon  You see my driving instructor he had a diesel car and he changed to a petrol just before my last lesson so I 've had like  and everything was fine but now getting used to the petrol 's really hard  Why is it very  different   Why is it very  different  It is yeah   different   Why   How do you know  Uhm because I 'd I had the  same experience   No but  a diesel you can  you can crawl along and you know if you 're in  traffic  you can crawl along and then just using your clutch  And you  only use your clutch for manoeuvres for anything  You don't need any sort of acceleration  What   Oh really the  It 's it 's not the actual driving that 's hard  it 's starting  It 's like you know   I take it  you don't need the same degree of clutch control on a diesel do you not  No  Oh right  You don't need to use your  2 sylls  as much  you know to move  or to move at the speed you 'd want to move to be doing manoeuvres  I suppose the last couple of cars I 've had have had quite big engines and you don't even need  I mean that car there if you just let the clutch out it 'll go  Right  Is there any need for that  What  makes blowing noise  You 'd think it was hot or something  laughter  Uhm  So no it 's getting used to it starting not actually driving  But  The driving 's fine and the manoeuvres were all fine  Mm   When are doing your test Rowena  I don't know  I 'll make sure I stay off the roads that day  What 'd you say  He 's being rude  She 'll kick him  Don't worry  It 's a pity you weren't home   could take her out   Aye and my  life 'd be at risk  You could take her out  I could actually now cos I have my licence I 've had it uh long enough  How long do you have to have it for before you can take people out  Three years  Do you  Do you  Can you  uh uh I thought so long as you weren't an R driver you could take people out  No you have to have your licence three years  Oh  How long are you home for Patrick  I 'm going back next Sunday  afterno  well  Oh a whole week like  Yeah sure I 'm doing this thing the UYO thing this week but

Were you off  yester  or on Friday  or did you just come up last night   Yeah just the holidays  the holidays are on Friday and Monday down  south   Right   Benjamin 's coming home tomorrow  is he   Today  actually  According to his mum  God did you hear what happened   dropped   You  remember Benjamin of  I don't think Jenna was there that day  No no but  You heard laughter   He he 's a barrister in New York currently  Is he  Well he 's not  At least he 's trying to get  a job   Why does your law degree work  does your law degree work in North America   No he 's got a job  He 's got a job  His mum told me he got a job   No you have to do the Bar exam in over there  Oh right  Well the degree yes certain  5 sylls   The degree works does it  yeah  Cos they accept virtually nothing in North America with regard to medical qualifications  Well you have to have you have to have do your exams  and  then be accepted to the bar  I think the exams are quite involved  Mm   Mm  Yeah I think they  they have like a forty percent  success rate yeah   And Benjamin got them   But anyway I dropped my purse coming out of the Mace the other day and didn't know  God   But uhm  it was the day that I was in work and this guy came up to Winemark  and I was out the back and he said to my manageress Janie do you know this  this girl  And I looked  at it and said that 's my sister  laughter  And he was like oh right  well she dropped her wallet in the Mace  And so I phoned home and told  Una   My staff card was in it   You didn't   you 're very careless with your wallet so you are  But wait to you hear  then uh   I went  to the Whiterock Road one day to get her wallet  But then uhm  What were you doing on the  Whiterock Road in the first place Una   She dropped it outside our door   Mm  What were you doing on the Whiterock Road  And the woman  who lifted it was from the Whiterock   I dropped it outside our door   Oh right and she just took it home with her  She just took it home with her  She didn't know who owned it  Yeah that 's  fair enough  Yeah    And rang  She rang like she rang Jordanstown and everything and they were able to tell me  because there was no home phone number but my student card was there  The same thing happened  though   Wouldn't you  think you 'd learn your lesson  Mrs uhm some woman came to the door yesterday and said hello  Has Una  is Una a doctor  And I was looking at her going oh dear God who is this  And then I was looking more and I thought it was Susan Baxter 's mum you know a girl who used to be in my a girl who used to be in my year at school  And then  then  uh yes she is  and she went oh right yes because that was what threw me  Yeah I got a phonecall telling me that uhm Una had left her her has left her wallet in the Mace uhm  and my number was the only number in it  And I was just standing there going oh right  uhm  Please   Was this on a different occasion  No this was the same day   No this was on Friday  You see I have Benjamin 's number written on his card  I have his home number written on it which I 'd taken and that was the only phone number in the wallet  So  the guy in the Mace phoned that  Right   She said that he seemed very very concerned about it  Really  Was she at our door  2 sylls  yeah  She said that she might 've she thought she might 've seen you at the Stations  And is this Benjamin 's mother  Yes  And you just happened to have his phone number on a bit of paper in  your 	  Uh-huh   Yeah I 've got his his business card and I 'd written down his last time  when he was home at Christmas  we were going out and I wrote it down   And so   That was very considerate of the guy  though just to phone somebody and say  do you know this girl   Yeah   But the reason that he came up to Winemark was because uhm somebody had said that Una worked in Winemark laughter   With my Queen 's staff card  But yeah she  she said that Benjamin would be home on Sunday and that uhm  he 's yes  several sylls   I thought that you knew that but I  And he 's got a job  In America   No sure I haven't seen him since Christmas  He was supposed to come home on  at the beginning of February but  4 sylls  in New York  Well listen  Benjamin  deserves everything because he has done everything he can  You know I mean he he fair play  to him  He 's done everything possible  I don't know   Oh aye   Though mind you I mean a lesser person would 've been home before like twenty the expiry of like a year  He doesn't  give up  He doesn't give up   He 's been looking for a job  It 's all all he was doing he was getting up every morning  and applying for jobs  Just knocking on solicitors ' doors  No like  putting in job applications   No sitting in the library  looking through  Like every day  for a year   Directories and stuff   Where did he get his money from  He had saved up for a house   Of course you must you mustn't call yourself  a solicitor in the States   Well you   we 've  actually no  well  yeah but you don't call yourself a solicitor cos a solicitor is one who solicits  Mm can you not   Attorney   Yeah   laughter   Wait uh but that 's uh we 've changed our name now  We used to be Herriot Coffey Garman Solicitors and now we 're Herriot Coffey Garman Commercial Lawyers  because  we

gainful employment he 's achieved himself over there  Well we don't know  Well we don't know  We haven't  that 's the first  we 've heard of it uhm  Oh I see   I take it you 're not working Seamus
