<S2A-017 Clinton arrival>  There is an extraordinary sense  you 're looking there at the rolling fields of north County Dublin  of occasion and history this morning Brian  Just a few moments ago the army number one band was rehearsing  Amhra/n na bhFiann  making sure everything was right  The President Mary Robinson has arrived  She was just rehearsing walking up to the steps  flanked by the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces  Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon  and the GOC of the Eastern Command  Brigadier General Bill Dwyer  Also the escort of honour  the motorcycle escort which is also drawn from Cathal Brugha Barracks  That normally escorts President Mary Robinson  This morning that will escort President Bill Clinton to the A/ras  You can also perhaps see at the moment the line-up there of the Second Field Artillery Regiment  also you can see the motorcycle escort there  A few moments ago  and you may see again  there 's a large crowd of the public have been allowed in  They 're on the main roof of the departure lounge  They were frisked but they were allowed through because they waited apparently for hours to get in here this morning  We 've just been told by air traffic control that in fact he 's gained some time  There you can see the people who 've come to watch the President here this morning  I think it 's as though they don't care how long they have to wait  They just know it 's an historic occasion which they will remember in ten twenty thirty years  Uhm it 's almost in stark contrast to the atmosphere yesterday at Aldergrove  This is a real sense of occasion  it 's as though the entire Irish nation has come out here this morning to say welcome to President Clinton and his First Lady  There 's  I think we  I 'm going to go straight now Brian actually to Paul Hick who is in air traffic control in Dublin  Paul can you hear me  Yes Miriam  Yeah uhm  Can you give us the whereabouts of where Airforce One is at the moment Paul  he 's just lined up on final approach for the active runway  he 'll be landing in about uh three minutes ' time that 's just slightly behind schedule  Meanwhile we 've uh frozen all normal movement in and out of the airport  The Air Corps have their armed patrols up and uh the Fougas are airborne for the uhm for the official flight  fly-past after uh President Clinton leaves his aircraft  Obviously for not just everybody in the country but for you in air traffic control this is a special day  It is very much yeah  yeah a little bit of  disruption uhm but uh I suppose it is uh an unusual event to have a a president of the US visit us and uh actually I was here in sixty-three when Kennedy uh arrived  Wasn't such tight security then  this thing has probably grown since then  We 're probably seeing  is that Airforce One can we 're seeing at the moment Paul  Uh yes Miriam he 's about uh five miles out now you can see him from the airport and uh he 'll shortly be landing  And uh you 've obviously been in touch with the pilot of Airforce One have you  Yes he 's been working our frequency uh and our radar for about the last thirty forty miles and uh  3 sylls  final for the runway and uh he 'll land shortly  Okay Paul Hick  Thank-you very much  Okay Miriam   Absolutely  It was raining here earlier but the elements have lifted  I think it 's a very happy and special day for everybody and the weather has taken that into account and now the sun is shining here at Dublin  About an hour ago the press corps from the White House arrived in a seven four seven similar to the one coming down now  a hundred and fifty of them  And they 've gone on to the A/ras  person speaks in studio  Yes Proinsias de Rossa  Minister for Social Welfare and Mrs de Rossa will be there  The other six people will be the US ambassador obviously to this country  Jean Kennedy-Smith  the Irish ambassador to the US  Dermot Gallagher and his wife Maeve  the Secretary to the Government  Mr Frank Murray  Secretary to Department of Foreign Affairs  Padraig McKiernan  Army Chief of Staff  Lieutenant General McMahon  Garda Commissioner  Mr Culligan  and then finally Mr and Mrs Roberta and Dennis Sandberg  an  that 's the  they 're the deputy head of the mission here in the US Embassy  That in all will be the greeting party  Just about to touch down  it has in fact touched down  It was a beautiful shot there  Air Force One travelling to north County Dublin  Before the President disembarks  two people will go into the plane  that is Jean Kennedy-Smith the US Ambassador here and the Chief of Protocol here  Mr John Burke from Foreign Affairs  They will both go up and greet the President before he comes down  Out on the tarmac now there is total silence  the anticipation of the arrival  Interestingly a lot of the people who will be coming out with the President have Irish names  A lot of his cabinet have names like Kitty Higgins  Mairead Hail  Kevin O'Keefe  Sean Brophy  Obviously a large Irish-American contingent in his staff  And you could  see that throughout yesterday in the North  particularly in Derry actually where there was singing and dancing  he seemed to relish it  really enjoy it  As well as the President and his staff coming out of the front of the plane  also at the same time you 'll see fourteen people walk out  They are the White House press corps that travel everywhere with President Clinton  President Clinton is of course the fourth president of the United States to fly through Dublin airport  John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the summer of sixty-three  Richard Nixon in the seventies  and then Ronald Reagan  who departed from Dublin airport over ten years ago  person in studio speaks   It also shows how Irish roots have been found in both sides of Congress  Aer Rianta this morning have laid out three hundred feet of red carpet  six hundred crash barriers and a hundred and fifty metres of red rope to prepare for this visit  No absolutely  And reaction obviously to the President 's visit yesterday in Belfast was that he was terribly even-handed up there also  He was very conscious of being even-handed to both communities  And a moment ago there Brian we saw President Mary Robinson and her husband Nick flanked by the Chief of Staff of our Defence Forces  Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon  and the General Officer Commanding Eastern Command Brigadier General Bill Dwyer  Very soon also a flight of Fouga jets  four of them from the Air Corps will fly past in salute  There 's extraordinary atmosphere  total silence out here in Dublin Airport on the tarmac as we await President Clinton  Out of shot at the moment the greeting party has lined up waiting for President Clinton to disembark  Don't worry about those grey clouds  where I 'm looking from on the tarmac the sky is blue  A little earlier Mary Elizabeth Bruton  John and Finola Bruton 's young daughter was practising how she 's going to have her big day and give the flowers to the First Lady  What you can't see at the moment is out of the back of the plane have emerged that press corps and many of the President 's officials  There now is Mary Elizabeth Bruton  Her father there   Although it 's solemn and there is silence Brian  there 's also a lot of anticipation and happiness which you could see there in Finola Bruton 's face  People are very excited about his visit  All his speeches yesterday in Belfast were marked and in Derry by that feeling of hope  the importance that people can take over their own lives  can go forward  can look forward to peace if they 'd just take control of their own lives  I 'm looking and I haven't seen them go in  they haven't gone  no they haven't gone in yet I 've just been told but I have the protocol here and that is apparently what will happen  or is expected to happen I should say  You just saw there Brian a glimpse of the media interest here  There 's a battery of cameras awaiting the President and the First Lady and crews from all over the world as yesterday  Both the communique/ and obviously his extraordinarily successful visit to the North yesterday will have buoyed him up  I 'm sure he was looking forward to coming here anyway but this must make him even more excited about coming  And in both places  we saw it in Derry in particular and later I saw it at the Belfast City Hall  he kept going and talking and shaking hands with people  He almost ignored his Secret Service agents and just wanted to mix with the people  You can see there Brian at the moment Jean Kennedy-Smith and John Burke at the bottom of the steps  Yes   It does though with praise to Foreign Affairs and Aer Rianta seem an extraordinarily well-planned visit and  this  this morning here everything was just very well organised  very well planned and much more relaxed than yesterday at Aldergrove  Later on the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces is going to present a special plaque to the President  It 's an enlarged version of the Defence Forces crest and cap badge and there goes Jean Kennedy-Smith and John Burke up the steps  And I heard her talking this morning on the radio actually about that visit  She was with him in nineteen sixty-three and she said today will make her cry because she will think back to that day  The extraordinary thing about nineteen sixty-three  Brian you were here  obviously I wasn't  was that even now when people watch the footage they cry  It was obviously so emotional  unclear speech from studio   Now it looks like Jean Kennedy-Smith is re-emerging with John Burke  So any moment now we should see President Clinton and Hillary come down those steps  And like John Fitzgerald Kennedy  Bill Clinton has also got a very strong wife who in her  her in her own right there is a lot of public interest in  And as he said yesterday in Derry talking about John Hume  people have been to visit so often from Ireland he felt he had to come to back before any of those came back again  Now here he comes  President Bill Clinton and the First Lady Hillary  Greeting immediately the President Mary Robinson  and her husband Nick  the Taoiseach  Mrs Finola Bruton  Ta/naiste Dick Spring  and his wife Christy Spring who is of course American  Proinsias de Rossa  Minister for Social Welfare  and Mrs de Rossa  This is the Irish ambassador to the United States Dermot Gallagher and his wife  Maeve Gallagher  Secretary to the Government Frank Murray  They 've moved away  but Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs  Padraig McKiernan  and now the Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General McMahon  Garda Commissioner Mr Culligan  and Dennis Sandberg and his wife Roberta  Chief of Staff  GOC Eastern Brigade Bill Dwyer  Now he 's smiling and waving to the crowds who have been waiting patiently on the top of the departure building  He 's coming down now to inspect the guard of honour  consists of one hundred personnel from all ranks drawn from the Second Infantry Battalion based at Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin  This is under the command of Captain Dermot Fell  The defence forces here in large numbers this morning  The twenty-one gun salute  the Second Field Artillery Regiment in McKee Barracks in Dublin  The Star-Spangled Banner plays
