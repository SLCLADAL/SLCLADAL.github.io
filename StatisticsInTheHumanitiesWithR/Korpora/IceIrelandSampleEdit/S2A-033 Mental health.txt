<S2A-033 Mental health>  We have a separate operational programme for the purposes of these initiatives  uhm which will be prepared by Mark Pinkerton 's branch in the T and EA  what we did was sent out a mailshot  which I think most of you should have had uhm we also advertised in the Telegraph asking for people to send in written submissions by the twenty-fifth of August  And I know the time scale is very tight on that and it came at a bad time uhm with people on holidays and all the rest of it but uh we needed responses quickly uhm because the draft OPs have to be in Brussels by the end of September  so we 're really working to the Commission 's timetable and not ours  and I apologise for the rush that uhm appeared to be uhm motivating this whole thing  Uhm what happens is that uh we have taken the submissions that we 've received in writing from people  Now out of  we sent out five hundred mailshots  NICVA also circulated it to their mailing list which is another five hundred  and the ad in the paper was the third strand  Now we 've had sixty submissions overall for all the different interest groups which is quite low but Gerry was telling me that there may have been other motivating factors which maybe stopped people uhm sending in submissions  Apparently there was a note going round to say don't reply because you haven't been given enough time to reply  anyhow  anybody who did write and say we haven't time  they were asked to bring along the submission to these workshops this week  So what we 've done is we 've just pulled out from the list of written submissions that we 've had so far a list of bullet points which you 'll find on uh the sheet marked workshop one  So that 's what the first session uhm really should work itself around  the second part after the coffee break then will be more directed to the actual operational programme  and we 've pulled out a number of points again from the Commission documentation on that  on the sort of things that they would like to see in the operational programme  Uhm and we 've also given you uh a photocopy of the more expanded eligible measures notes from the guidelines for the operational programmes which we may or not work through as you feel appropriate in in that second session  Mark uh is next door  doing the same job so we 're not actually going to uhm you 're not going to see both of us unless he floats uh once he 's done his opening spiel  but he 's done out a few introductory remarks on what an operational programme is so maybe if I just read through those and try and put that in the picture to start with and then we can get down to uhm the workshop one sheet  member states are responsible during the  preparatory phase for negotiating with the Commission national operational programmes  setting out the main priorities  eligible measures  and details of implementation arrangements  But approved by the Commission these operational programmes will provide the basis for the selection of individual projects by the member state authorities  The communications to the member states of which you have received a copy sets out the broad framework for the initiative  Within this framework the member states ' operational programmes are expected to identify specific priorities and types of measures designed to address specific problems  circumstances and target groups  So the Northern Ireland OP has to provide a general  social and economic background uh for the particular target group  describe the local situation in terms of the problems faced by the various target groups  the provision currently being made for them  the gaps in the provision  past successes and failures and so on  and select activities from amongst those set out in the communication  flesh them out and relate them  relate them to the specific needs in Northern Ireland  The Commission has set out a standard framework or checklist for each measure of which you 've received a copy  At all stages you need to bear in mind the general principles set out in the communication  Now the thing that makes these initiatives different from mainstream ESF primarily is the trans-national dimension  uhm so trans-national dimension is vitally important  Innovation the projects all have to be innovatory  Now innovation again was not really defined by the Commission the last time round  It was left up to each individual project bidder to come up with their definition of what was innovatory about their particular project  Now to a certain extent we 've accepted innovation as being innovation in terms of provision within Northern Ireland  So if people were able to tap into good practice in other member states that hadn't been tried here before we accepted that as innovatory  Other member states didn't and in fact  clears throat  the Commission sent round a  a group of consultants very recently  and they took us to task over what we had accepted as innovatory  But again that was within the terms of the old operational programme and it 's up to us to decide at this stage how we define innovation for the next time round  Efficiency of systems and transparency of qualifications  co-ordinated approach and involvement of relevant actors  reinforcement of EU policies and programmes  and flexibility to meet future needs  So again  the OP to a certain extent has to be drawn in fairly broad terms uh so that when it comes to the stage of actually bidding for projects from your end that uh there 's sufficient leeway there to allow what you want to do to be covered by the framework that 's that 's uh agreed by the Commission  Uhm the draft OP once it 's produced  uh and again we hope to do that within the next couple of weeks and get it off to Brussels by the end of September  uhm the final version of that will go to Brussels by the end of October and then there 's a two-month consultation period uhm during which the Commission will uh agree or take issue with what we 've proposed  But the important date to remember is the thirty-first of December because that 's the point at which the monies have to be committed  So the OPs all have to be approved by that stage so we 're working to the end of the year basically  uhm with a call then for projects based on the operational programme in the first quarter of ninety-five  Now is there anything  is that as clear as mud or I know that there 's a lot of European gobbledygook in there uhm that isn't necessarily that comprehensible so if there 's anything you want to ask me before we actually get down to looking at the points that have emerged from the written submissions so far  uhm speak now or forever hold your peace  Who is the we in determining we define innovation  Well the we is the  the operational programme basically  So it 'll be down to Mark 's branch to decide  but the idea for what should be covered by the operation will come from these groups  Okay  And that 's the idea of the we  that people  exactly that people on the ground will have a say in both the the definition of terms within the OP and the general broad thrust of the OP as well  rather than have it written by uhm the background written by a columnist or whoever who are one or two removes from people at the coal face  The idea is that they should be responsive  that the process should be transparent  and that you can all have your say at this stage uhm and hopefully produce an OP then that is responsive to the local need  Now it 's a framework at this stage  It 's it 's just a framework that uh I mean the guts of it are there in that second page the things that have to be covered in the OP and that 's the basic bones  What we want today is flesh to hang on those bones  and again a lot of it  a lot of the points that we 've pulled out uh didn't necessarily come from the submissions from the two groups that are here today  They came from a wider group but there are a lot of sort of uhm cross-activity issues now there are lots of points in common for all the groups who are involved in these programmes  So if there are things there that don't necessarily seem to apply to this particular group uh it 's because we 've taken the wider view and pulled in points from some of the other submissions as well  Freddie has agreed to chair today and Derek has agreed to do rapporteur  Lisa 's operating the tape machine  Now the tape machine is not there for any sinister purpose  It 's really to help at the writing up stage if there are gaps in people 's notes and we just thought it was as well to have a tape backup so I hope nobody has any objection to  And it 's not going any further than the group that 's here and the people who 'll be actually working on the OPs so uhm what you say is between ourselves and nobody will necessarily be identified by anybody else  So I think if nobody has any more questions on the general background to the thing uhm if I maybe hand over to you Freddie  Thanks Dan
