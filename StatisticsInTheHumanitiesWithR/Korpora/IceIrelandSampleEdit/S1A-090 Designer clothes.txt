<S1A-090 Designer clothes>  Thing I liked best in Macy 's was the Calvin Klein department and the Ralph Lauren shop  Oh God we just walked in Rita said oh God  laughter  if I 'd the money  Oh man the most  beautiful clothes   But Ralph Lauren  is  disaster though  Th  there 's some clothes and they 're nice  There 's other clothes and they 're disgusting  And they 're hundreds  of pounds  Like a polo neck thing was a hundred and thirty-five dollars  I mean  where would you  be going   No in the shop   I know   It 's all for  the name like  But that 's what I 'm saying like  it 's not worth it   But some of  the clothes are beautiful there  Oh God  Well you can be sure if I saw a man wearing Ralph Lauren clothes I 'd think twice now  Oh you would not Jenny  Oh I would  Although I saw this pure ponce actually  in uh in Trinity the other day  He was wearing pink jeans right  Big huge baggy thing and he was a pure pole like  And he 'd a belt on him and then this  white  Ralph Lauren polo neck  He was Irish  4 sylls   Oh no   Was he Oriental   Oh what a plonker  A lot of the Oriental  ones would oh  bright clothes and   He paid about fifty pounds here for that  Ralph Lauren  polo neck  Jesus you 'd pay  more than that   A lot of it is to do with to  do with designer labels because most people would be I know people I work with and some of them would buy Gucci labels and Gucci bags and  the  3 sylls  wouldn't be  Like like here you would easily go off and get away with wearing a Dunnes Stores bag  and no-one  would ever  Yeah yeah   Yeah   Sure if you had a Gucci bag here you 'd think you should be out all day  laughter    exactly   Yeah   Walking around with it  Yeah I I don't know  I think as long as whatever you buy is good quality and you 're happy with it that 's all that matters  I like the oul brand names now  I 'd have to  say myself I do  Do you   Jenny takes brand names off things and sticks them on other clothes  I do not   My brothers  used  they too  they used to they used to years ago remember I got this  th  this American couple sent me Lacoste shorts  and  T-shirt  you know  I was only small  I think they were hand-me-downs from their  son or something  I was wearing them anyway cos I was only four  But they were mine  laughter  And Brian my brother take off the crocodiles off them and sewed them onto his things  laughter   Did they   Oh right   Yeah   Yeah   He sewed them  He yeah he took them off  It was the only sewing he ever did in his life was it  it was like a little hole left on my T-shirt  laughter   Sure God love him  the poor man  he got into that habit then  Lacoste that 's okay  That would hardly happen now Ciara  It wouldn't happen now  He 'd get a bash his head  laughter  to pull anything out  Bring it back now  Sew it on  You have a cold Ciara  I have a constant runny nose more or less  In damp weather it 's always worse  Is it blocked as well  Constantly  Well I think the garlic pills now that Maureen got me yesterday  I went into Nature 's Way yesterday and I asked for something for uh  blocked nose  you know  Yeah  Someone that their nose is always blocked and especially at night-time and they gave me garlic capsules and I brought them home and her nose was free this morning  She took one last night  Really  Well I put the Sinex spray as well like  Try them anyway  They 're they 're worth trying sure  I might I wouldn't mind getting it  I thought everything was   2 sylls   cos it 's there all time  It 's only in a dry climate in the night or during the summer when it 's dry  Yeah   Yeah  Or even winter when it 's dry  Mine 's always blocked eternally  And was it kind of freer in America did you notice  A bit freer   it 's not too bad in the summer  It 's always the cold like that brings it on  It 'd be worse or like in the cold days  Yeah yeah yeah yeah   Yeah yeah  mm  So do you miss college now or 'd you rather be working  Oh I do  laughter  I do miss it  You do  I do yeah because  You miss the fourth year project and all that crap  No I don't miss one bit of the study or any of that kind of nonsense but I do miss the companionship  Ah sure God love you  No it 's not the same  You have to make  but of course now wouldn't be the ideal social set-up at work either cos there wouldn't be many people working where I am working  Right  But uhm  it 's just not as easy to have friends around when you 're at work  It really isn't  Of course it 's not  It 's a different set-up altogether  Yeah  Well when you don't have friends anyway Ciara  Like you you know you wouldn't really miss it  laughter  4 sylls  Someone like you some outcast from society do you know  Gail are

ways you know  2 sylls  against all girls  but does  2 sylls  depending on the level too  But  I don't know in secondary school  in some ways it was good I don't know I think I would have been too shy to go to a boy  certainly not for the first two or three years in school I mean I grew up with four brothers and all that and I went to a mixed national school  And I got on grand there  But you know in that kind of few teenage years and  you 're all  awkward  And well I know I was awfully shy  Mm   Yeah   Were you  Oh I was I went through a very shy stage  laughter   Painfully shy  Oh I was awful now  And I went through that stage for about the first two or three years of secondary school  I don't know now would you I think I wouldn't 've been able to cope with the mixed school then  I 'd say I could easily be crushed  Oh God no uh  It  was great craic  Brilliant fun  Re  really really yeah   Could have been the opposite then of course too yeah  I 'd a great ould time now  Sure
