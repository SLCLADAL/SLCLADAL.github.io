done last Sunday  yeah a good bit yeah  Dragged out of our beds  laughter   I got shouted at like all day that oh you were here sure  Ah I got a good bit done like but we 're we 're sort of moving back in so  Was Leslie pissed off  Don't know  Why   Did  you not see him  Aye he 's alright  Yeah  He 's dead-on  Okay  I said to him  he stayed on Monday night actually sure  Mhm  He didn't uh he didn't go home  Right  no everything 's alright  It 's just Leslie  2 sylls   But there 's big big happenings  They 're expecting I don't know ten thousand people in Downpatrick or something  well  maybe three  three  thousand people   Ach your arse   Three  three thousand maybe yeah  laughter  It 's not that many  They 're having big uhm a big event tomorrow  What 's that about  It 's the parade 's tomorrow  It 's not on Monday  Why  Cos it 's I don't know  Cos Monday 's Monday 's a bank holiday but  I suppose they 're maybe expecting more people in on a Saturday  Mm  I don't really know  but  So I 'm working tomorrow and I don't know  really what time we 're getting off  The kitchen 's getting delivered uh tomorrow so we 're going to start putting it together  So that 's what I 'll be doing when I 'm off  Mm   Right  And I 'm going away on Friday morning  so I 'll have to start getting ready for that  When are you back  next Sunday  Which is Easter Sunday  Yep  That 's the day I 'm planning to go away on the bike  Are you  Mhm  Where 're you going  Uh Ring of Kerry and Dingle  Oh who with  With uhm Marilyn on the back  On the back  That 's  a very long ride Janie  Mhm   Mm  It 's a long way  It 's a very long  jaunt   Well  we 've five days like  Oh right  I have to go home  I 'll come back and go straight to work basically  Would you not take more time off no  No I can't  I can't come back from a week 's holiday and take another week  I can't do it  And even if I did I couldn't leave Mum and Dad 'll be half in the middle of  moving and half decorating and all  I 'm busy at the minute  Aye  I know  Go away with us in the summer and then you 'll be alright  Mm I 'll think about it  You still haven't decided yet sure you haven't  Well sure we need to get together and plan stuff like you know  Beale said he seen oh well it 's  maybe it 's news to you as well  he seen a CB five hundred  either ninety-nine or ninety-eight in the paper  Really  It 's yellow though but that 's   2 sylls    I love  yellow  Well it 's got a yellow disc one of the ones with the wee fairing at the front  But it 's  uh thirteen thousand mile one six  How much   Really  One thousand six hundred and he 's going to he 's thinking about buying it for the trip basically you know  Cos  it 'd be cheap for him to  insure  It 's that 's  it 's  best option insurance-wise for just passing his test you know  Right   Uh-huh  So  It 'll be a good bike  It 'll you know I would like to buy one like that  There 's thirteen it 's he would rather have one with low miles lower miles  But it 's not too bad  Well that would be a big  step up for me  even  Why sure yours has got  sixteen thousand hasn't it   Mi  mines  is twenty thousand over  Oh has it  you I don't know you might not like it  It 's got a bit of a fairing at the front  Can you not take that off  He would you can't really no  It 's got a square  it 's got the light and all attached to it  But it 'll be far better for the journey cos you 'll need a wee bit of  protection  So   Mm  That chain I bought wasn't a split link chain  I didn't think it would be  Well I that 's what I asked for  So did you not get it done then  well he hammered out the links right  It 's a rough job actually  I done that before  He no I watched him do it  He did it very very professionally  He knows exactly what he 's at like you  know  He used to race bikes like   said he 'd be  doing working on chains every  every week like  And uh he said he 'd he 'd have it all sort of set up for me next week  And if I go down at five o'clock on Tuesday an hour before the class begins then we can get really stuck into it and he 'll get it sorted then  He says he can just cut off the chain that 's on it  Yeah   Oh very good   Yep  Or whatever  and just put it all on intact instead of  oh no put it on kind of hanging off  Do you know what I mean  laughter   Not really but you 've to get new  you 've got new sprockets haven't you  Hmm  You 've new sprockets  Aye I do aye  Oh that 's alright  But uh I tightened the chain then on Tuesday night just to give me some practice like and uh it 's terrible  Why  The you can feel the the back wheel isn't straight  laughter   But uh   Did  you not do it in his class  Mm  Did you not do it in his class  I did aye  but he was helping me measure it and everything and then  he went off and I finished the job like  laughter   Don't like the sound of that  I know  He 'll maybe well I hope he knows what he 's doing but you 'd maybe be better taking it to  somebody proper to and say right put this chain on for me  No he knows like  Okay  He said see you know when he puts on  this chain he 's going to get it exactly perfect you know for because  he 's saying it 's like one millimetre out  the tyre he said uh you know when he  looked at it there   The tyre aye  the chain wears differently and all  The chain wears badly and  stuff  1 syll   But uhm  just saying I probably won't see you now but in between now and going away cos I 'm just I 'm on every day I think  Yeah   Aye right enough  And unless you come down here I won't see you  I 've to go and collect my tyre at some point but I might  Your what  My tyre  My front tyre  Where did you get it  Uh Killyleagh  You 've ordered it for Killyleagh  Yep  Or he 's got it or what  I ordered it  I 'd better  not forget about it  Do you know he   He gets it in Belfast  Does he  You know that place we went to  get your  Where he buys his tyres  Aye   Really  Gerry 's  So   Och  I don't know  I just I when I was down there I just thought why not like  And the  my mechanics instructor was saying you know you don't really need a new tyre yet  And I was  saying I but   Aye your front 's  not too bad  I plan a few trips like  And he was like well okay if you  And he was looking at it and he saw the wee you know the wee hairs coming off the side the wee rubber  Right  And he was going God you don't take many corners do you  laughter  And he was laughing  4 sylls  people look and see where it 's worn  and see if it 's   Yeah  cos they 're still intact like  Well that 's about it  That 's  Mm  So I won't see you then probably   2 sylls   asking what chocolate  What do you bring back from  Okay   Yeah bring me some chocolate back  Not dark chocolate  Swiss chocolate  Milk chocolate  I 'll see what I can do  And maybe a wee fondue set  Isn't that what they eat  Ah well  supposedly  Well have a great time  Don't go breaking any legs  Naw don't worry about me  I 'm can't it 'll take more than that to break my legs  Don't go arsing around cos  I 'm not even going to play football   4 sylls    Everybody I  know that 's come back from a skiing holiday in the last year or two has come back with something broken  Well I hopefully won't  u  I usually go to play football with my mates from work on Monday night but I 'm not going to go just in case I get injured cos  my  insurance doesn't cover cancellations  I I got the cheapest insurance I can get so  Uh-huh   Yeah  I have to be careful  Okay well have a great time  Okay well make sure and get that bike  done   Enjoy  the apres-ski  laughter   I will    You 'll have  your mobile with you anyway won't you  Where  Wherever you go  No it doesn't work down south  It does now I can tell you  Really  To make a call with it you have to do something  you have to make something silly  Can I receive messages  You can receive  and you can send but you have to put something in front of it and it 's expensive  So  top up before you go  Put about twenty quid in it before you  go  And then uhm  aye ask when you 're in the wherever you are ask somewhere how you do it like  And somebody 'll tell you how you what you put in front of the number to ring somewhere  Mhm   Right   Okay  And I 'll I 'll give you a wee bell send you a text or something  Right okay  But you might not be away even sure you might  Or are you definitely  going   I 'm  definitely going  laughter   Well then you 're going   3 sylls    I could end up  going on my own for God 's sake  You 've decided so you 're going  Well Marilyn uhm has is saying that she 's never been on the back of a bike before and she 's quite a nervous driver and she doesn't want to get on if she 's going to make me  any more nervous  laughter   Well she won't make you nervous but she 'll if she 's  doesn't know how to  lean round corners and all  You need to take her somewhere for a wee trip  Well she might   I know but I want to get the chain on first   sure the  bike 's in proper working order before I do like  Yeah   You do  So some night next week  I 'd say  Right  okay I 'm going to go and try and find somebody to go out with  Okay   Okay  Okay  Right  All the best   Saint Paddy 's   See you later  Bye  See you   See you  Bye
