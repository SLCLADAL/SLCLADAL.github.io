<S1B-009 Education>  Did any of your schools  or the students walk out or anything  Ours tried to  laughter  But I have to say the gates were locked  laughter  There 's another one at one o'clock tomorrow  Tried to walk out today did they  But they were just told to get back to class and to wise up  laughs  basically  Two of my daughters are on opposite sides of this debate in their school  Did you get your letter this morning in the post  There was a letter from Fortwilliam  Is that right  No I didn't I have  I haven't seen it yet  Just to say that the children were obliged to stay in school for health and safety reasons  laughter  It was posted out under parent and guardian names  We sent a letter out too  Well what I want to do uhm  this evening 's session  the uhm there 's a couple of things  First of all I want to pick up pick up on some of the issues that we touched on last week around issues of uhm sort of rights and and diversity and difference  Uhm and so I want to cover some issues around that first of all  some some data and information around that and that 's partly why I gave you this uhm that little questionnaire on ethnic minorities  That was used in a uhm little study that uh I was involved in a couple of years ago  where we certainly got a large number of teachers to try and get a sense of uhm the extent to which uh teachers were aware of uh some of these uh issues related to ethnic minorities  and so uh just wanted to  I gave you that questionnaire  your responses with the primary responses from the larger group of teachers that we uhm we were engaged with  The uhm  and then I want to give the time to talk through some of the stuff that 's coming out of the yellow forms  uh the assignment  uh well the impression I get is that everything 's fine  No problem  laughter  The uh  and then the uhm  uh the the last part of the session I want to start addressing the issue about uhm the role of of uh schools uh in uh addressing reconciliation and tolerance and some of the ways in which that has been addressed over the years  so that 's the sort of agenda for this evening 's session  First of all  is there anything coming out of last week that that anyone wanted to revisit briefly  Uh last week we spent most of the time playing games  laughter  so uhm uh okay so if there 's nothing there  okay what I want to do then in this first session is just look look at some  some issues around uh gender and and and race really  and the first thing I want to look at is  is some issues around gender  By tradition uh gender issues in education have have tended to to revolve around the uhm uh  have tended to revolve around uh the uh the differential and unfair treatment accorded to girls  Uh traditionally it was uh close enough access to uh to girls  with particular aspects of the curriculum uhm uh so there 's actually still  I mean if you look back at uh educational  official documents produced even as late as the nineteen sixties  it really is quite astonishing the uh  the some of the basic taken-for-granted assumptions there were about the type of curriculum that was appropriate for boys and for girls and how different they were and how this wasn't  it was never it didn't appear to be seen as an issue at all  And a lot of the stuff that was written around gender issues in education in the sixties and the nineteen seventies uh revolved around that that particular issue  attempts to try and promote equal opportunities uh for girls and uh and women  Uhm more recently the  that has changed  Uh and in some  respects that has changed in a bizarre way right  in the other direction  uhm it 's now  a lot of the uhm official talk in terms of gender in education being about the under-achievement of boys later in class   So this this is a fairly simple way of analysing a relationship between two variables  This is for all the  the co-ed uh grammar schools in uh ninety-eight ninety-nine  the that 's what the graph is about but but what can we conclude from the graph  Considerably more girls ' schools  that girls are  seem to be achieving more than boys  one two three four  boys ' schools or co-ed schools or whatever are actually  you know the boys are out  the over-achieving girls  And even in three of those cases those three  the difference is relatively small  They 're not that  they 're not that uh widely different from the this uh sort of common common common line  This is the only case where there 's  the proportion of boys is markedly higher than the proportion of girls  And in all the other cases uh the proportion of girls  3 sylls  is higher than the proportion of boys in the picture  Okay so that would suggest  what  several sylls  doing better than boys  you know they 've done better in the results  whatever the underlying reasons for it are  Right okay  so in terms of the co-ed grammar schools the  that evidence suggests that by and large the girls are doing better than the boys  in  2 sylls  education  The uhm  this is the data for uh single-sex grammar schools where the yellow dots are the uhm single-sex girls ' schools and the white dots are the single-sex uh boys ' schools  Uh and you can't obviously put them in the same type of graph because they 're different schools  okay so they 're not  you can't simply compare them in the same the same sort of uh sort of way  So what I 've done is simply to rank order the scores for the uh proportions for the  for the boys and for the girls from the lowest to the highest  Okay so that 's simply the rank order of the girls ' schools  all single-sex girls ' schools from the highest  or uh sorry from the lowest to the highest and the boys ' schools from the lowest to the highest  5 sylls  There 's three more uh girls ' schools which is why the the boys are there and there  what can we tell from that  Girls outperform boys again  Right okay  Is it as simple as that  It 's more  girls ' uh grammar schools are very consistent in high performance  Yeah  So there 's there 's a great consistency in in the in the girls ' schools  So the the lowest is eighty-nine percent  uh the highest one hundred percent  So quite a narrow  uh a narrow sort of variation across them  A much wider variation across the boys ' schools for some reason  Uh anything else   several words   Well that 's just the  I just put these in the the same  the single-sex boys ' schools  this is the one that had the lowest  and  again that 's the one with the highest  I put them in that rank order  Is it the case that all the girls ' schools schools are doing better than all the boys ' schools  Right so that 's   No   No  No it 's four schools  four boys ' schools that are doing better than some of the girls ' schools  Yeah yeah  And those ones aren't  those ones there aren't far off it  No  No  So there 's a degree of overlap as well  So sometimes the way people talk about it it seems that   girls are doing better than boys  the but there 's actually  it 's like any sort of spread I suppose  there is a degree of overlap  That that 's not the very  that 's a very crude way of showing it  But it shows some degree of overlap  So it 's not simply a matter  all girls do better than all boys  Uh there 's  uh there 's it 's a slightly more nuanced picture than than uh than that  This is these are the same data for uh secondary schools in the same year  Uh this is also the co-ed schools  Uh the same principle  this is the scores for the boys  this is the scores for the  for the girls  This time it 's the criterion  it 's the proportion uh passing five or more uh good GCSEs uh at year twelve  Uh uh and this is again it 's the same for the uh co-ed schools  What 's happening  what 's happening there  The same picture  Girls are outperforming boys virtually uh  virtually without exception  There 's a few places where boys are doing better but there 's not that widely different from the  the centre line  Uh the vast majority of the schools are on the other side of the line where the girls are tending to do better  and there 's a lot  there 's an awful lot more of the schools where the girls are doing markedly better than the uhm  than the boys  Okay so in a sense that 's sort of  it 's it 's very similar to the sort of pattern that was found for the uh co-ed uh grammar schools  and then the uh single-sex secondary schools  again rank order uh from lowest to highest uh  3 sylls  for the boys ' schools and for the girls ' schools  There 's not as much difference this time  in the low  much closer  There 's there 's there 's quite a  there 's a reasonable degree of variation across them all  I  mean that fits in with the the high degree of variation we get with the secondary schools more generally  Uhm the uh  the there 's much more overlap  Yeah   Yeah  In terms of the scores  so there 's there 's  some of the the boys ' schools are markedly lower than any of the girls ' schools but not that many of them  uh and there 's not that many of the girls ' schools are above all of the  the boys ' schools  So it 's much more a case of overlap even though there 's sort of a broadly consistent pattern where the girls are on average clearly doing doing better  Now  so so what can we conclude from all of these things in relation to the uh the this sort of data on this uh issue about boys doing better or girls doing better  What would be a a reasonable set of conclusions to take  take out of out of those data  Well using exam results as you know raw data the girls seem to be coming out on average slightly better but there are exceptions to the rule and anybody  3 sylls  co-ed works that way I mean might turn round and say  look well my son or daughter 's going to a single-sex school because of the advantages of that over co-ed  and  look at it that way  Yeah   Yeah yeah  There is I think a widespread  well there appears to be a sort of a popular uh  there 's probably a good number of parents who do want their daughters to go to single-sex schools and their sons to go to co-ed schools which obviously is a mutually contradictory set of aspirations  But uhm  uh uh partly because there is a belief that girls will do better in single-sex schools  uh whereas boys will be civilised in co-ed schools  laughter  Uh I don't know  I don't know about the latter bit of it but uh what 's happening in practice is that girls generally do better regardless  So the evidence doesn't suggest that single-sex schools provide any performance uh any benefit  uhm partly because of this sort of pattern that uhm girls are doing uh doing better  doing better generally  Is there a comparison at all between boys in a single  you know boys in a single-sex and boys in a co-ed  Rather than all pupils in a  I honestly can't remember  The uhm most of the analysis on these things has tended to focus on on girls  Uhm and I wouldn't want to say uh  my suspicion is that statistically it wouldn't make much of a difference
