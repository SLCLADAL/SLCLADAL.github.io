<S2B-014 Cork radio>  Good afternoon  Now this is Anne Ryan at the news desk  And the hour 's top story  Two Cork families have appealed to the public to help in their search for their missing teenage daughters  Donna O'Sullivan reports  The two teenage girls have been missing since Saturday April the thirtieth  but the disappearances are not connected  Thirteen year old Caroline Donoghue from Blackwater Heights in Youghal is known to have left the town in the company of a young man who 's thought to come from Scotland or Northern Ireland  Her parents  David and Betty  have themselves searched the town and also Waterford city  where their daughter is said to have attended a disco and they are now getting increasingly worried  Well we 're extremely concerned you know  'Tis 'tis uh  she 's been gone like with over a week you know  And we 've had no word or phonecall or anything  you know we we 've we 're after we 're after  being trying in Waterford city  with a pile of guest houses  2 sylls  down there  Dunmore East has been tried you know  So we don't know  anything else what to do uh  you know 'tis uh  it 's just getting a bit long now you know  In Fermoy Louise Anne Quirk was last seen twelve days ago in the town 's main street in mid-afternoon  She is sixteen and under a doctor 's care for depression  Her mother Margaret says that Louise may come to some harm  With Louise as she 's so depressed  she could do away with herself  Cos she tried to jump in the river there a while back  but her friend stopped her  You know  And then  she could be with somebody  or she could be on her own  We don't know  We want to know is she  is she with somebody  or is she on her own  The Gardai/ in both Youghal and Fermoy would appreciate any information from the public  And SIPTU representative Anne Egar said that Friday 's Irish Steel talks will be the last chance for the troubled firm to get it right  Reacting to this morning 's news that rationalisation plans will now include the axing of twenty management jobs  Miss Egar said that as yet she had no redundancy proposals on her table  Anne Egar  Well we 've been invited to a meeting on Friday by the new Executive Chairman  to uhm receive proposals uhm as to how to address the the future of the company  And when we receive those proposals we will be spending some time independently assessing them to ensure that they are the correct proposals and this is the correct way to go  Uhm this is the last chance for Irish Steel to survive  The Union initiated the review uhm out of which came the appointment of the Executive Chairman  and we we have to be sure that this time it 's being done in the correct way  Cork farming representatives reacted strongly this morning to plans to cover Ireland in a grand afforestation plan  taking in a massive three hundred and seventy thousand acres  ICMSA National Council member Vincent Crowley said that such a plan could accelerate rural decline stating that existing farms could become more isolated by being hemmed in by trees and that trees did not spend money but farmers did  The new and controversial Public Order Bill has come under yet more criticism  this time from an anti-abortion group  Youth Defence  who say they are now afraid to distribute leaflets on Cork streets because they are constantly being moved on in Dublin  The group said that Ireland would be heading towards a police state if members of the public cannot express their views  The arrest of a member of their organisation recently caused civil liberty groups to decry the Public Order Bill as infringing on the rights of expression of ordinary citizens  And now for national and international news  The Justice Minister Ma/ire Geoghegan-Quinn is thought to be recommending to Cabinet that an internal Garda enquiry should be held into the procedure adopted in the recent investigations in Clare and Galway  Thousands of people are attending the funeral Mass of Father Joe Walsh in Eyrecourt County Galway  Father Walsh was one of three people abducted and killed in Clare and Galway  The funeral Mass is being concelebrated by four bishops and one hundred and twenty priests  Hundreds of people are standing in the rain outside the parish church weeping openly  And finally  the historic moment occurred this morning when  Nensol  Ne  Nelson Mandela was sworn in as South Africa 's first democratically-elected President  Dozens of world leaders  dignitaries and tens of thousands of ordinary South Africans were at the Union Buildings in Pretoria to witness the ceremony  Before Mr Mandela was inaugurated  the former President Frederik de Clerk was sworn in as Deputy President  Nobel Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu  who worked for years against the system of apartheid  was among the religious leaders to lead prayers for the new South Africa  And now for sports news  Over to Pat McAuliffe at the sports desk  Good afternoon  We begin with Gaelic games and the first semi-final of the Martin O'Sullivan sponsored Cork City Division senior hurling championship will take place this evening at Pa/irc Ui/ Rinn  Winners for the past two years Na Phiarsaigh will meet Bishopstown where the throw-in is at seven fifteen  So can the town stop the northsiders  a question I posed to Bishopstown Chairman of Selectors Jim Ryan  Well I would think that any game has to be taken on the day or on the night  The weather is going to have a big influence on  tonight obviously  I would honestly say  yes we have as good a chance  We should have stopped them last year  We were uh held to a draw in the original final when we had a winning from a forty yards free in the last minute and didn't take it  And put up a good display in the final  We were quite happy with  result and we have been improving throughout the year  Uh I would say yes  I 'd imagine you would have a fair idea uh of talking to lads at work et-cetera today and on the phone  as regards your team tonight  So have you any problems  We have uh  two big problems  Our centre back Michael O'Connor is receiving physio  He had to come off at half-time against the Rockies  And uh Trevor Keating  our centre forward  received a hand injury that night  He also had to come off and both  at this stage it would appear that both of them will be unavailable tonight  And the big game this evening starts at seven fifteen at Pa/irc Ui/ Rinn Bishopstown versus Na Phiarsaigh  A result from last night in senior hurling  Middleton eleven points E/ireann 's Own one goal and five points  and in intermediate football league last night Saint Vincent 's defeated Saint Michael 's one twelve to five points  At a function in Jury 's hotel in Cork last night  the eleventh annual Guinness University College Cork Sports Star awards were made  Eleven sports stars were honoured  In rugby John O'Driscoll  in athletics Pat O'Keefe  in soccer William O'Keefe and in polo Conor Walsh  Well there were two awards in hockey  Rachel Kohler was joint winner with uh  winning for the second year in hockey Irish captain  Sarah Kelleher  That 's right  Uhm I received uhm the Jury 's Guinness UCC Sports Award yesterday uhm and it was it was very a proud occasion once  again to receive it  Uhm it 's always nice to get noted for all the work that you 've put in and uhm  UCC have been very good in that regard this year and the last few years and noting as they call excellent sports  people in their college  Uhm in regard like uhm they 've set out to give  bursaries to students and also noted them with awards this year so it 's they 've been great from that regard  And of course it has been a tremendous uh season for youse you see I 've actually seen you winning your uh Munster Cup recently and you won the double  We won the double I think it was the  the double  uh it was never won ever in the history of UCC hockey that any team ever went out to win a double so it has been a historic year for UCC hockey club and and it 's nice to be a part of that  making history for your club and college  And a tremendous uh week for you last week of course  sure I suppose uh highlighting you with the five goals in an international match  That really must be the highlight of your career so far  Yeah it has been uhm  I I 've never scored that many in an international but hopefully maybe I 'll do it again but it was  it was a great week  Uhm our performance over the week improved as a team and uhm it was a great opportunity to get good matches together as a team and and play our own game in our own pattern  The sides weren't as strong as we 'll be coming up against in the World Cup so it allowed us to play our game and our possession hockey  which is one that we won't probably get much to do in the World Cup but it 's good to practise for the times that we do  You 'll hear plenty of that young lady in the World Cup which of course starts in eight weeks ' time  She will lead Ireland and she 's just twenty-three years of age and she already has thirty-five Irish caps  That 's uh young lady there Sarah Kelleher  Well also joint winners in the football awards  Seamus Moynihan from Kerry senior footballer and Cork 's John O'Donovan  while in hurling Waterford and Munster Railway Cup player uh won that  Pat Eaves  and in fencing Isabel Delany was the recipient  In rugby after Sunday 's six six draw the Munster Junior Cup Final replay between Shannon and Cork Constitution will now take place at Thomond Park Limerick tomorrow evening at seven pm  In soccer last night Liverpool scored five goals against Shelbourne 's nil in front of a crowd of nine thousand in a friendly at Tolka Park and West Brom chairman Trevor Summers has ruled out a return to the Hawthornes for Bryan Robson  Robson who joined Manchester United from Albion for one point five million pounds is leaving Old Trafford after twelve years  He played for Albion last night in a testimonial match for his younger brother Gary against Aston Villa but Summers insisted  I want to kill off these rumours about Bryan Robson  I don't believe in having anyone return to a club for a second time  And Birmingham City Managing Director Karren Brady flew to Spain today denying a rift with manager Barry Fry  Fry is understood to be disillusioned with Brady 's style of administration and matters came to a head after several players received unexplained wage deductions before Sunday 's big game at Tranmere  Birmingham won that match two one  but were relegated to division two as
