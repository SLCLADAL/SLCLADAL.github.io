<S1A-100 College plans>  My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me  kind of like a drug dealer  and then they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them  laughter   Like a drug dealer  Only with food   Judith is there something you want to tell us  Yeah I I I 'm a food dealer  laughter   Yeah you look like the type alright  Those eyes are always quite shifty  with a hungry look  laughter  Oh God  I mean I know I 'm sure you  you can't wait  Like what  what 's the accommodation there like  Is it nice or is it  Uh it 's fairly good  it 's better than a lot of places  Uhm you 'd share  everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years  You pay every year then  And you only have to pay rent for the weeks of term which is loads better than getting a flat  because for that you 'd have to pay for the whole  year  And I think you share a kitchen with three other people  which is the least anywhere else would have you  Like in Reading you 'd share with between three and eleven people  Mm   Okay well most places  I remember places where I went to over in Liverpool I remember it was  you shared as well but there was maximum of six I think  It 's not bad but uhm anyway like three is pretty good so  Yeah no three is actually brilliant   Uh so it 's  like they  you sort of have like a bedroom and it 's okay and there 's a room  like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so  Oh cool  It looks pretty good and you can kind of  it 's handy like you can choose between cooking for yourself and going down to the canteen and in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term  Oh right  But like you can  you have both options there anyway so  I just have to keep reminding myself of that  laughter  One of my study incentives  And then is it like  are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well  some of them are ensuite  You kind of apply for it and it 's kind of first come first served so  fingers crossed  for me  Fingers crossed   Yeah so  so hopefully just the three people are alright and they 're not   Exactly  Cos then like with eleven people you 'd be assured to have a few good people there but three people you 're just  Yeah  Fingers crossed  laughter  Nice people  Hopefully  Hopefully  Oh well that 's if I get in at all I mean   Ah you did I 'm sure  You didn't sit my exams  But you 're Judith  You 're smart  Yeah but it was hard  I 'm sure it was but  it 's always you come out thinking I did crap but  you actually did okay  Mm  And you need what  you need one A and four Bs  Two As  Two As and four Bs  Yeah  Let 's see and do they  do the As have to be in like honours subjects  They have to be in history and geography  History and geography  They have to have to be in  That 's a bit pissy that it has to be history and geography  It is a bit pissy really  Can it not just be any subject or  I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you  You 're not meant to know it but  they do sometimes like if you got  like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who  like she was a student there and she was over from Ireland  And like they wanted As in like  biology and chemistry and maths or something  and she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she  they let her in anyway  Sure you never know  Maybe they might  Hopefully  Oh well I 'll just appeal everything I don't like  But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them  But the worst thing is  imagine if you appealed and then the result came back worse  That 's horrible but they only did did that to like eight people and they upgraded a few thousand I think so  Ah right yeah  I think it 's pretty unlikely to happen  cos that 's the one thing I 'd fear about contesting a result  I 'd just be like  and they 'd go back over it with a  even more so   realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like  five minutes or something like that  Yeah   But I mean I think they say they go back over it when you appeal it looking for  extra marks they can give you  not looking for interruption in tape   That was easy to fix  What was it  He just moved it  Oh right  laughter  So do I not  did I not get any hold music no  Uhm no you 're not on hold  You could put me on hold  I just yelled over my shoulder at my dad  That doesn't count as putting you on hold  Fine  Have you ever heard the Specsavers ' hold music  No  It 's like clown music  It 's awful  And then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again  And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched  laughter  And every few seconds it 's interrupted by  welcome to Specsavers  Your call is important to us   That 's just scary  It 's really horrible  I 'm so glad I use Vision Express  Yeah I know  It seems to have paid off as well considering how well you can see a pool table  It 's great  laughter   Pool hustler  No but although I 've never had to ring them  so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well  Yeah they might  And in my mam 's old work it was really bad  It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves and it was really slow and depressing and horrible  Oh God  It was really bad  no that would be alright  Basically there is no good hold music  Except for the lift music  That 's pretty near  The what music  Lift music  Where  In lifts  Not all lifts  Actually I don't think I 've ever been in a lift that had lift music  One thing I hate though  talking lifts  I hate them  where do you get in lifts  I 've never come across any of these things  Have you never heard  seen those talking lifts where it 's  ground floor  first floor  Oh well in airports  Between the  those kind of yokes  Welcome to departures  what do you call  and where else did  was I in one  I think Arnott 's might have them  Really  Yeah  Why don't you go up the stairs  you lazy git  Ah no like we were  I can't remember why we were going up the lift but we went up the lift  I think it 's cos we were going up to the second floor and we were down in the basement and we were just walking by the lifts anyway so it was just like   Isn't that for people in wheelchairs  Well uh  them and the lazy  laughter  Them and the lazy  Yeah  Fair enough  but what were we talking about there  I 've no idea  We were gibbering  Yeah no we kind of got sidetracked there and there 's  there 's something I was going to say  I can't remember now  Uhm  no it 's gone  Aw  It probably wasn't that interesting anyway  That 's possible  well you never know   if I remember it  We were talking about the exams  Yeah no  it wasn't something about  I think it was something about lifts but I can't think of it  what it was now  Oh well  Oh yeah  now I remember  No see once when I was in a lift with my brother  we were in James 's hospital right  Mhm  And while the lift was going down he opened the doors  What a bastard  What the hell did he do that for  He was just like  Rory  I was in here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier and he did that like  and he was just like  oh look at this  this is so cool  That 's like something my brother would do  laughter  And it was just like  then the thing  the lift stopped and it was just like  oh no we 're stuck  we 're stuck  Oh my God  And it was just like  laughter  and he was just there oh Jesus I can't even close them  I was just like  Michael  What an idiot  But he was only pretending he closed the doors  Then the thing started going again and it was just like  you fucking bastard  laughter  That 's horrible  I know cos  like I usually I don't mind small confined spaces but if I was going to be stuck there it would be pretty crazy  That would really be horrible  Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift and they start drinking coffee  I mean wouldn't that be the worst thing you could do when you were stuck in a lift  like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon  Yeah I know  laughter  Yeah I know that would be quite a stupid idea really  so  I 'll never forget that day  It was just like   but  It 's really horrible  It really is  And you wonder why I 'm the bitter middle child  Yeah I 've suddenly realised why you 're so bitter  I mean it couldn't have been because of his laziness because you 're just as lazy  So I didn't know what it was  Or just the fact that everyone calls you Little Rasho  That that that also annoys me actually yeah  So when your sister gets there they 're just going to call her Female Rasho  laughter   Female Rasho  Just like you only wearing Escape for women instead   Is that  is that nice is that nice all that stuff or would you know  Escape for women  Mm  It 's kind of old-womany  It 's not that nice  That wouldn't be nice at all really  Or how about Emporio for women  Is that nice  Hang on no  I haven't smelled Escape for women  I 've smelled Emporio for women and it 's not very nice  God you women really don't  maybe the  maybe it 's the ones where they like do a man and women version  Yeah  The men 's version 's always nicer  I don't know  Ah well  we have nice smells in Boots  Exactly  Ginger and lime  nothing can beat it  Uh no so  what was it but  several sylls  I can't remember what it was now  I really have the memory of  You keep doing that  I really have the memory of a goldfish you know I  I think the exams have done something to you  Yeah they 've just  laughter  ruined my mind forever  School 's over  Don't need that any more  School 's over and it 's destroyed you  Ah so much fun throwing out notes  I just went into a note-cleaning frenzy the other day  threw out everything in about half an hour  Oh I know it 's great
