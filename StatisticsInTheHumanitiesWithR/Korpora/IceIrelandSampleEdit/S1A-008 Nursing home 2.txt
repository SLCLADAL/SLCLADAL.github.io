love to go into  You know  But Pauline look at the shock we got  That Superdrug shop  My  God we went in there on a Saturday and I used to race round  And Jenny Ramsay  used to sample all the sweets  and all  And that just seemed to close up overnight  Was closed   All the bargains   Where 's that  At the bus stop  Do you know where Aer Lingus offices were  Yes  Right below that  And he 'd the drums of loose sugar and flour everywhere  I wonder what happened  Oh the Scoop Shop  Och sorry  Scoop Shop  What did I call it  Superdrug  I wondered what  so was I  I wondered where the Superdrug was gone now  There 's one in Anne Street I think isn't there  Yeah  For I used to get the nuts for the birds and all in it  That 's right  Everybody come  We never could work out what happened  Nor nobody could tell us  It was a nice  kind of a shop   But Lauren  you know what Anna 's opinion of Clarendon is  What  They went over the top  you know the decor and  Oh the decor
