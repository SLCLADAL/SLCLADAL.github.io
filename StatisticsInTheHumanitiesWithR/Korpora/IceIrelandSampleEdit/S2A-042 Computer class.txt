<S2A-042 Computer class>  Now the last day we were discussing uh the application software  So uh what do we understand by  application software  Madeleine  several sylls   Right and what do they do uh Pauline  several sylls   Uh Polly  I wasn't here  several sylls   Well you should know  you should know  What is the  what actually is application software  How would you describe it  Uhm the the uh the software that carries out the different tasks  That 's right  Application software uh enables the computer to carry out a specific task  as opposed to system software uh which is the operating system  So application software  writes on board  enables the computer to carry out a specific task  So as Madeleine mentioned there  we have different types of uh different programmes uh which come under the heading  of application software  We 've word processing  spreadsheets  database  accounts  stock control  payroll  et-cetera  These are all known as business applications  Business applications  Now again under the heading of application software we have uh what is known as package software  application packages which can be bought off the shelf  Now these are programmes that uh are used by uh the general public if you don't need a special programme to carry out the work for you  So that is known as uh uh application packages  writes on board  laughter  Now as well as these application packages uhm we have special-purpose software  Special-purpose application software  Now this is software  application software  which is specially written to suit the needs of a particular company  Specially written to suit the needs of a particular company  Now large  we 'll take large manufacturing companies that uh have we 'll say integrated software especially  uh to meet their needs  That means that some of the application uh programme or software enables the computer to uh cover the task in hand from the time the raw material will come in the door to the time that the manufactured product goes out the other door  So every entry that was made uh using that software will update different files  So this type of software is specially written because the needs of companies vary from one company to another  That is special-purpose  Now we 've dealt with the uhm word processing  So in a nutshell uhm Anna  what are the basic features of a word processor  several sylls   So what kind of editing have we Madeleine  several sylls  insert  okay  several sylls  copying  Copying  And uh also what other features have we Madeleine  Spellcheck  Spellcheck  Right  several sylls   Now what about formatting  Formatting the document Pam  several sylls   So what is involved in formatting our document  several sylls   What does formatting a document mean  Anybody  several sylls   That 's right  Setting margins  top margin  bottom margin  left and right  Setting tabs  uh setting the size of the page  centring  all that  involves formatting the document  It 's the layout of a document  Then we have enhancements as well  which uh Noreen  Enhancements  Bold  Bold print  that 's right  Underlining  Italics  Italics  That 's right  So there are of the  Yes Olwyn  Increase the size of it  That 's right  the size of different fonts  Now always remember that if you change the  the size of the font you must have a printer that is going to print it out successfully  Some printers uh uh will not print it out  So you that 's something that you need to watch  But generally in business if you are doing that kind of work you will have a printer that will print out your different size of fonts  Okay  The uhm actually the printers over across the way don't  2 sylls  don't  Well any dot matrix will  Unless that the program is  the the actual file is missing off the program  Now we 'll take WordPerfect for example  within the WordPerfect programme you 've different files that control different actions  Like for example printing out different uh size uh fonts  underlining  bold print  et-cetera  Different printers you 've a file of printers so WordPerfect controls it as well as the printer  Now if you have a dot matrix printer  most dot matrix printers today will print out the large font  You mightn't get the quality  To get the quality you need a  either a laser printer or an inkjet  So uhm that is another feature of word processor and then of course  uh Breda  anything else  several sylls   Yes well  4 sylls  cover that now  Now any other features now apart from these editing uh features  several sylls   Yeah a word wrap yeah that is  Word wraparound is automatic carriage return  So all word processors have that  Now we have of course we 've mailmerge uh for standard letters and then we have which we went over the last day with uh standard paragraphs which is known as collating or document assembly  Now uh document assembly is the construction of one document from a number of standard paragraphs  Now these paragraphs are stored  They 're stored either in a separate file  some word processors have what is known as a library  other word processors have uh what is known as a glossary  Now there are two meanings to the word glossary  A glossary can be uh like a dictionary to explain different terms  You get a glossary at the end of your book  But a library for stored paragraphs is also known as a glossary  So uh these uh frequently used paragraphs are stored in we 'll say a glossary  writes on board  a library  if your word processor hasn't a glossary or a library you can use a different directory for these stored paragraphs  You can make a directory to put these paragraphs into  Now that is the way you organise your files  especially in business where you are using a hard disc and all your programmes are in different directories  They 're in sub-directories  Now you can have a sub-directory for your documents  for example all your letters and your reports et-cetera  And to distinguish  we 'll say  between reports and letters depending on the type of business you have you can put an extension onto the end of the file name  Now as I said before uh a file name contains uh a maximum of eight characters  You cannot have more than eight characters in a file name  Plus an extension of three characters with a dot between them  So if you want to identify any  your documents in their own directory you could give them a name  and put in your dot  and give them a three letter extension  to identify uhm your document  whatever that may be  You can  uh you could devise or in a company these would be standard  These would be standard practices  and of course then for your standard paragraphs  your frequently-used paragraphs  they could be in a directory of their own  And of course they could have uh the their extension as well  Now uh another day I will uh go through uh the directories with you  As I said uh previously we 'll do that on the computers themselves because in theory  it 's difficult to understand them unless you do them  So uh we 'll do that on the machines  Because there is always a path leading to a directory  If you have  we 'll say a letter  we 'll say a document directory  you could make a sub-directory called a document directory  well you 've to go through the path to lead to that directory if you want to call up the  the directory to see if a certain document is there  So all these uh sub-directories lead from the root directory through another directory  we 'll say through WordPerfect onto a document directory and on through to we 'll say uhm uh paragraph directory you could call it paragraph or something like that  So that 's uh uh uh a job for another day  We 'll do it on the machines  Where you 'll be able to understand it better  again with the application software I think we 've covered uhm most of the features  We covered them the last day anyway uhm as well as the word uh processor we have uhm the spreadsheet  Now we should all know what the spreadsheet is  Jenny would you describe what a spreadsheet is  several sylls   Now I 'm here Jenny and you 're there  I never heard of a spreadsheet  So you 're telling me now what a spreadsheet is  If you could describe it clearly  What about you Noreen  Uhm it 's a it 's a sheet with rows and columns  That 's right  Yeah  several sylls  do whatever you want with  What kind of things would you do Noreen  Uhm analyse the trends or  several sylls   Yeah uhm Belinda  have you anything to add  It 's a worksheet that 's done on a computer  several sylls   yeah  And  several sylls  give you results  you can draw graphs  pie charts  and stuff like that  Right there 's something very important uhm something important that we 're forgetting several people speak simultaneously   Yeah the computer calculates automatically  and at the end of the day  because we are using formulas  this makes it possible to change any figure within the spreadsheet and any total that that figure will affect will change automatically  that is the power of the spreadsheet  Now uhm before we had computers and before we had electronic spreadsheets uh these spreadsheets were done on a large sheet of paper  They were ruled down uh vertically and horizontally and at every intersection a box was formed  Now you can think of that box when you move the cursor in your spreadsheet it 's like a little box  So at every intersection a box is  formed and this box is known as a cell  Every cell has a reference  which is known as the cell address  And when you enter figures into a cell uh and calculate them afterwards  you use a formula to calculate  but you just specify the cell address  You don't ever refer to a figure  You actually calculate the contents of these cells  So this is what makes it possible to change a figure uh that will automatically change the results  Because you 're asking the computer to calculate the contents of the cells  not the figures  not the actual figures  the contents  So whatever you put into these cells is going to be calculated  If you change the figure  the your results are going to change as well  So that is the power of the spreadsheet  It 's known as the what if question  What if this should happen  What if the price of uh we 'll say petrol went up during the coming six months  What effect would this have on our business  if a company are using a spreadsheet to uh budget  we 'll say for the coming six months  and they think that they they have their spreadsheet done  then they hear that the price of petrol is going to go up  The price of petrol is going to increase the price of transport and that is going to affect other uh other areas of their company  So they change the figure for transport for petrol  That changes the figure for transport and any figure any other figures that that will affect uh will change automatically  So as you know already from doing the spreadsheets yourselves you only put in the initial figures  All totals are calculated automatically by the program or by the system  So that was the spreadsheet  Now you can see  well I think everybody here knows what a spreadsheet looks like but read into it  if you are asked questions on a spreadsheet you must be able to answer them clearly  You must be able to define what a spreadsheet is  what it does  and also the power of the spreadsheet  Why we use a spreadsheet  So think of these questions in your own mind  Uh what is it  Why do we use it  What is the purpose of it  What does it do  So think of all these questions that could come up  Who uses a spreadsheet  The features of a spreadsheet  So again we all know that  we know that uh the text is known as labels  figures are uh are known as values  and then of course like the word processor we have editing features as well  Now there 's no need to go into those because we 've been doing those uh for the past few weeks
