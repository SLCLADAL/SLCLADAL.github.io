doing  an outside programme  several sylls    Was it Joe Duffy that does it  Well he met  he met up with this man anyway your man  He was a real Dubliner  and all the rest of it  and  he was going on  And he was really funny  It  was the best laugh  He 'd the whole place laughing you know  He  as I say  he was a better comedian than you would hear on the  or see on the  on the  television  And he was good   Aye   Aye   Yeah  4 sylls    Oh aye   And cleaner  Aye uh-huh  As I say I like funny ones  As you say they were funny  Uh-huh uh  He was at he was at the corner of he was at corner

funny  Oh right  right   Was that  on after twelve o'clock  Uh-huh uh-huh  I missed everything  Aye   Aye  uh-huh simultaneous and unclear speech   There was the loveliest  there was the loveliest film on  and you know what time it finished at  What  What was it   Uh  two forty  the other night   Aye I know uh-huh aye  uh-huh  And uh it was called Stolen Miracle  And it was all about uh uh what do you call it  it was a mother  uh what do you call it she 'd a daughter and then thought they weren't going to have any more children  and  then she was expecting a baby and she was in the hospital and she had she 'd this wee boy  And then of course wasn't the  the baby was abducted  This  this woman came in and then uhm she must have been hanging about and said  oh I 've just taken him up somewhere for a check-up  And she made off and then she was living with uh uh this  uh  ex-con  And uh of course then this big uh TV programme and appeal and all  looking  for the child  You know and then  there 's  the whole story unfolding and how they find  her  And anyway it all ends up well that they get the  the baby back  Somebody had found  And she  this uh she wants she had a  uhm  she had a miscarriage herself  You called her Mary this woman  And Mary had the miscarriage and then you see she always had this in her mind that she  would abduct  a  child if she couldn't have one of her own  And  she 'd gone into a shop you see and she 'd bought this padding and she was  w  walking around you see giving the impression then that she was uh pregnant and all  And then you see when she walked into the hospital and that you see it wasn't suspicious because she had the padding out and all  But there was great continuity in it and a great storyline  And no ould muck in it in any part  It really just flows along  And here 's me I said now  wasn't that a lovely wee film  Uh-huh   Oh for God 's sake aye   Aye   Uh-huh   Aye   Uh-huh   Uh-huh   Aye uh-huh
