Well Ron 's blue uhm  if you ever see books or anything on budgies there are two colours  There 's the green and the blue  So we seem to have picked the most popular   I 'm not I 'm not an expert on budgies   Well I think I 'd need pictures cos they 're always there  But uhm he 's uhm  he 's uhm a sort of a dull green colour but not dull dull  a  sort of nice colour and uhm  No no    Our

 We 've got we 've got pot plants  Yeah  They 're trouble enough  You have to remember to water them  tw  eighteen goldfish up until last year  Pardon  I 'd eighteen goldfish in my other apartment last year but cos I moved house I couldn't bring them  Eighteen goldfish  Do you have to feed them  I 've these wee pellets that you throw in every day  Is that in your pond  Very very swish  A world-famous pond  Is that your world-famous pond  It was in Homes and Gardens  Honestly  Couple of years back  they announced  this competition  You 'd to send in a few photographs of your garden and then you won a prize but then  Excellent   It must be beautiful  After that they asked could they do a photo shoot on it  three men came over and spent the day moving all the pots about  Excellent  So did you buy the did you buy the  issue   Magazine   A couple of copies of it  Excellent  Goodness  I 'm sitting beside a celebrity  Two celebrities in fact  Goodness me  I don't know  I was on the radio in Italy  That 's my claim to fame  What did you do  Just gave an interview  Gave an interview  Well they wanted me to talk about coming from Ireland and all that sort of stuff  Talking in English or talking in  Italian  It was awful  Absolutely  awful  Nightmare   Cos when you hear  cos I didn't think my accent was too bad and then when you hear it on the radio you know your accent in English is different anyway so  several sylls  really embarrassing  It was good fun  It wasn't live  no  No could 've done it live but I said no thank-you  several sylls   They broadcast it in the area around my town  Georgia  Albania and some other obscure place  So there you go  laughter   What sort of a town is it  One of the sort of old towns or fairly modern  it 's Byzantine so it 's it 's pretty old and all all the wee streets are cobbled  It 's not  Is it a wee hilly town or  No it 's really flat and the centre 's very very small so everybody tends to go about on a bicycle which is absolutely manic because the Italians in cars are bad  but  on bicycles they 're even worse  And at crossroads nobody has the right of way well I mean everybody has the right of way  It 's absolutely chronic  Yeah   Last year we touched down in Rimini on the way back from Crete  Mm  But flying down into Rimini the area round there looked really nice  There was all wee sort of hilly towns  the real sort of castles and things  I haven't even been to Rimini yet  What have you been doing  Working away  Well I have been working cos I do  I do loads of kind of   You 're a slogger aren't you  Slog slog slog  Uhm  Are you really up close to Venice then or are you sort of half-way in between Venice and Florence  Have you been to Florence yeah  Uhm I 've been to  I was in Florence last summer and then last Easter  Mm I like Florence  Florence is gorgeous isn't it  Uhm I 'm about  in the train I would say I 'm about I haven't actually been to Venice so I don't really know  I 'm sort of about sixty kilometres away from Venice  eighty kilometres maybe  About fifty miles  several sylls  The same distance  It 's not it 's not that far at all  Mm  Well you should go  I know I should go  That 's a disgrace  I haven't had time  Have you gone to Rome  laughter   Rome 's my favourite city  Have you been  Yeah in April  Oh brilliant  I 'm hoping to go at Easter  Last Easter  There 's just something  about it   So how  many  how many days were you there  I was there when I was at college for about two weeks and then two weeks again in April there  I love Rome  I 'd go back there any time  Is there loads loads to see  You could spend weeks just wandering about it  Honestly  A really nice place  Cos some people say  Well if you like history and all that sort of stuff  and I do I like  a bit of archaeology and all  It helps if you know a bit about the place before you go as well  It 's a really nice city  The people are really friendly  You can just lounge about and wander about the streets and you feel dead safe  It 's a nice place  So it wasn't  you didn't find it dangerous at all  Oh no  Cos you hear all sorts of things  People say you know oh you know be careful when you 're in Rome you know you get pickpockets and  2 sylls  and things and  People say that about anywhere  I was told Venice was going to be smelly and horrible and I thought it was really nice as well  Really  Yeah  That 's good  No matter where you say you 're going to go people try to put you off before you go  Gotta make your own mind up  Did you go to the Coliseum  Jealous people  Jealous people  That 's right  What did I do there  Just spent two weeks wandering the streets  This place called the Spanish Steps  is  really nice  Oh yes yes yes   And just all the students were sitting out there at night-time  Was it not bunged  It can be but  you know it 's nice in the evening because all students go up and sit there and play music  Mm  Bring their guitars up and just burst into song and stuff  Just sit there with the sun going down  It 's really nice
