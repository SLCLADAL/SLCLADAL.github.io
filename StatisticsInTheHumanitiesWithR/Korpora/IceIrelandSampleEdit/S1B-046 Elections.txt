<S1B-046 Elections>  Victory has been sweet for the new rainbow ministers while Fianna Fa/il and the Progressive Democrats now form the opposition  But how long will that state of affairs continue  This morning we talked to PD leader Mary Harney  about the challenges facing the new government  I first asked her if her description of a bright red rainbow of ruin was a bit over the top   I don't believe it is  I think if you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party  it 's very much the policy approach of Democratic Left and the Labour Party and I see very little evidence  of the Fine Gael philosophy of recent years  Uh if you just take the allocation of portfolios for example  uh Fine Gael now have control over just about twenty percent of the spending departments  Uh that 's very serious I believe  Labour have control over the Department of Finance  Education and the Environment  Northern Ireland policy  they 've control over broadcasting  and they will be calling the shots in relation to the divorce referendum  I think  the makeup of the cabinet and the economic programme in particular indicate quite clearly to me that this is very much a left-wing government and it 's not the kind of government that the country needs at the moment  If you take the attitude to state enterprise  it 's the old left-wing doctrine that we have to accept  No privatisation   You 've worked closely with John Bruton in opposition  Do you not have faith in the man to be firm and decisive after your experience working with him on the opposition benches  I had huge regard for John Bruton  We worked very closely together  Uhm I was very disappointed with the way he handled the negotiations for the formation of government  despite the fact that Fine Gael had fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party the Labour Party seemed to call all the shots  Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme  and in the composition of the cabinet  And as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending  And that certainly doesn't indicate to me that Fine Gael is in government with fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party  This is the first inter-party government for for forty years and we 're talking about personal  relationsh  personal relationships being very very important  How do you think Dick Spring and Prionsias De Rossa particularly will get on  Well as we saw at the break of the last government  obviously the unexpected that can cause the biggest problems  And I think that may well be the case with this government too  I think it will  be a question of whether or not trust can be established between the three party leaders  I think Prionsias De Rossa and John Bruton have worked well in opposition  uh so I don't see that as a problem   But I don't   Do you think they work better  better together than uh  than Dick Spring and John Bruton or Dick Spring and Prionsias De Rossa  Certainly that would be my view yes  Uhm and I hope that that changes  Uhm if the three party leaders don't make an enormous effort to work together as a team the government will collapse  Or it won't really exist because  to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work  you can have a lot of progressive legislation  but if the trust is not there from the start  then the government won't survive  Certainly uh we saw evidence of that in the  different governments led by Albert Reynolds  Trust broke down and once it did everything else collapsed   And my advice   Do you think this  government  this government can last for the duration of its three year period   It 's always possible  It 's too early to say  It could collapse very early on  The government has the potential to collapse within a matter of weeks  Now you 've mentioned a couple of fault lines that could develop  What do you think will be the first one  the one that could cause them to collapse in weeks   Well it could it could collapse in the  formation of the budget  Uhm I I anticipate that there 'll be enormous problems between say Prionsias De Rossa who 's in the Department of Social Welfare  who will want to make his mark there and that of his party  and Ruairi Quinn perhaps  Uhm it won't be even to do with financial matters it may well be to do with personality issues as well  Uhm I think there are a lot of difficulties down the road the whole state enterprise area  We have to because of our membership of EU  we have to be responsible  we have to have competitive state enterprises able to compete in the market  I think from the programme for government it 's clear the government don't understand that  and they seem to want to avoid dealing with that  And because of the amount of fudge on  crucial issues  local charges  and I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely  that 's not on the programme for government  There are many many things but as I said earlier  it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem  One issue they 'll have to resolve quite quickly is the position of the European Commissioner and also the Leas Ceann Comhairle  What are your views on the decisions they have to take in these regard in this regard  Well firstly in relation to the Leas Ceann Comhairle  I supported the nominee of Fine Gael in the last occasion because I think it 's important that the opposition has that position  Until recent years the opposition always had that position  I think it would be wrong to remove  Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly  he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion  He 's been very good in the chair  and he 's been very fair to all sides  And if somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant  uhm being removed from that position  And I hope that the government won't proceed with that  And certainly  if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats  In relation to Padraig Flynn  the personality of the Commissioner is not the issue  I was very disappointed for example that Labour and Fianna Fa/il didn't support Peter Sutherland  earlier this year because if they did  he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage  And that would 've been a very prestigious position  for a small country like ours  It 's no longer the case that we could get the presidency of the Commission  And therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner  at this very late stage  have to be sure  that it 's not going to damage the national interest  Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio  and the government would need to be certain  that they could hold that portfolio  if they were going to change the person  And I don't know if they could be certain of that and I think they need to be very careful  It 's not a question of putting in our own  We have to look after the national interest  That 's what must come first  Do you feel hard done by  in the run-up to the formation of this government  I wouldn't call it hard done by but I thought the experience certainly was an interesting one  I 've said to people I learned more in the last two weeks than I 've perhaps possibly learnt in my previous seventeen years in Leinster House  I found the negotiations we had with Fianna Fa/il in nineteen eighty-nine  a lot more open and business like  I found these negotiations insofar as we were involved  uhm very unpleasant  On another issue a very crucial issue of Northern Ireland do you fear that the consensus and unity that seemed to  to unite all politicians is starting to break down slightly given Albert Reynolds ' comments yesterday uh about cross-border institutions   Well I 've already said that those comments were  unwise and insensitive  And I repeat that  I was very surprised  Albert Reynolds was one of the main architects of the Peace Process  He must be aware  of the need for  sensitivity  Albert Reynolds himself was very concerned just over a year ago when a very important document was leaked to a journalist  And he expressed that concern  The problem we have in Northern Ireland is that  t  two divided  communities a divided people  You only bring those people together if we are conscious  of their concerns  And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems  Already we see the reaction among the Unionists  They 're frightened about what 's going to happen  And I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary  And we do need a North South dimension to any settlement  It makes it more difficult  when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds  And I believe  the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging  I hope it 's not going to continue  And I certainly think it 's very unfair on the new government  In a period   Do you  do you think it 's going to cause big problems for John Bruton if the architect of the process is standing behind at him shouting from the sidelines uh  Albert Reynolds has the potential to destroy the process if he continues speaking like this  This is a period of uncertainty because we have a new government  It 's a difficult process anyway  It 's very fragile the Peace Process  It requires great sensitivity on all our parts  I 've given my assurance and that of the Progressive Democrats to the new government that we will support  what they do  And I hope that Fianna Fa/il do likewise   Well that was Progressive Democratic leader Mary Harney  We 'll be returning to the Peace Process a bit later on but joining me now live in studio is the Democratic Left Leader  and the new Minister for Social Welfare Prionsias de Rossa  First of all  congratulations on your new appointment  It 's uh it 's a high-spending department  How do you intend to make your mark   Well uhm I intend to make my uh mark by seeking to implement the programme which we have negotiated with the other parties in government  Uhm we have managed in the course of those negotiations to  negotiate one of the most significant changes in our approach to assisting  uh families uh  ever ever ever achieved and that is in relation to child  benefit  There will be a new uhm  increase in child  b  benefit but also the uh provision of a supplementary child benefit which will uh  replace the child dependence allowance for  social welfare recipients  and uh for low paid  workers the uh F FIS  It will it will it will mean that a lot of people who  previously uhm would lose child support because they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh will no longer do so and it will eliminate a lot of uhm  poverty traps  It it is a major step  forward  Well Mary Harney would say your time the time you have to make your mark could be quite limited could be limited to a matter of weeks
