<S1B-076 Internet cafe>  okay basically we are thinking  you know  an idea we 're  several sylls  doing at the moment is we 're looking for an internet cafe  where we can totally brand it  Yeah  Idea being that we 'd have  The whole cafe 'd be the Monster look and feel  We 'd have  You see cafes 're going to probably be quite strict about how much  you know  we can't paint Trump on the wall or  whatever  but really as much as we can get  I 'm thinking the screensavers would be our home page  We 'd have like our mousemats around the place  some kind of way of getting  you know uh as as good as we can get it within their you know  have as much  Yeah like I mean  yeah like Trump coming out of the wall or posters or some Trump sort of on the ceiling sort of  You know  stuff like that  But it 's going to depend on how much  they 'll allow us to do that  you know the way  I  haven't even met them yet  But I 'm looking to meet them and go in and say  well this this is our ideal situation  It would  the cafe would look like this  have it fully  branded  And they 're obviously not going to go for  as much as we suggest  But  I don't know I don't know how you 'd do it  Is it a  like a photo or if I could bring in some kind of a  three-D thing that I can save onto a disc or something  Yeah   As much  2 sylls  branding stuff as you can get   Yeah   Yeah   Uh-huh   Yeah   We probably wouldn't be able to do anything three-D  with our limited  laughter  But what do you mean  A little model or something  No not even three-D  Sorry uh uh like a   No an even  li  you know those webcam kind of things  Oh right yeah yeah yeah  I don't know  Is that big  cost or   No to  to do that we 'd have to kind of go in  And get a  real camera   Decorate the the  internet  cafe and then film it   Yeah   Or even could we get even a a picture of an internet cafe  any internet cafe and like  superimpose Monster stuff on it   Yeah I got  some pictures which I want to show you because  they 're they 're just from some of those image catalogue sites  And they 're not brilliant but I just want to show you  Mm  And you can say that was  that 's good or bad  So do you have any particular cafe in mind  Or is it  That 's good  Okay cool   Well at the  like what I 'm doing at the moment is just contacting them  I 've rung loads of them and arranged meetings  but I kind of wanted the creative  you know for when I go in and meet them  Yeah  they 're going to be  the ideal one would be something like on Grafton Street or on Dawson Street  They 're two that I 've got meetings with tomorrow and next  week  So  the one in Grafton Street it 's a ground floor  They 'll be big  Have loads of computers  lots of space   Yeah so   Are there any on Dawson Street with   2 sylls    Yeah  there 's one on Dawson Street  It 's called Yeah  It 's at the end near Trinity  Uhm the other thing is it 'll be  we 're looking for one that has come out  that serves food and coffee  Yeah  And maybe has like a cafe area to it for people who are waiting or whatever  Right  Cos we 're going to try and brand  the coffee cups  the bags  The whole kit and caboodle  everything  Serviettes whatever  You name it  You brand it  laughter  God it just makes me feel sick  laughter  You 're worse than McDonald 's  laughter   Cos I was thinking that if we had one in mind that you 'd already approached we could go in and take digital photos of it and then  But that might seem a little bit cheeky  if you  You see I  I don't want really them  to  think that we 're to go in a step ahead of them  You know the way   Yeah   Right yeah fair  enough yeah  Yeah I think I think if we just have  if we can get some photos of the internet of any cafe  and just kind of go well this would  basically is how it how it 'd look   So there 's going to be screensavers  Just so I know  Yeah  Where I can put on  my   Uh  screensavers  mousemats  uhm something on the walls  I don't know if it would be posters or if we  could  3 sylls    Or what what about  you know  those cut-out  cardboard cut-out chunky things  th  those kind of  things yeah   That we  have on the walls here    maybe  ceiling stuff  There 's  Have you seen those dangler things that Fred has of  Buzz Lightyear and  all that  kind of stuff  gets an example   These 're  apparently called danglers   So they have a  a suction cup at one end and then something that dangles down at the other end  No   Oh really   Yeah   That 's cool  I mean if you get little Trumps  like that   Trumps yeah   Yeah that 'd be cool  All that yeah  All that kind of gear  Uhm so do you  want  3 sylls    Things  maybe on the roof  like coming from the roof  and that   What do you  call those  There 's a point of sale  There 's a special name for those things that come from the roof as well  Can't remember what it is  but uhm  The thing about it is  I don't  like uhm  We were  we were going to do this in the Special Olympic Village  you know  you can buy a site basically and you can do it as you want  several sylls  It would be like completely  several sylls  a whole thing it would be like completely  several sylls  into the Monster 's cave kind of thing  Yeah  but I suppose that 's probably going a step ahead cos these cafes aren't going to  completely want to sell out to us  Mm  But uhm same kind of idea  Just as you  like you 're going in  once you 're in there you know straight away it 's Monster and you know  Monster land  You see the brand and you recognise it for the rest of your life  What what  kind of place would it be in the Olympic Village  It wouldn't be an internet cafe  No it was it was an internet cafe we were going to do  I don't think we 're going to do it now because it 's too expensive  especially if we go with this idea  if this works  Uhm the internet village was basically  you can buy an area  any company that is  you know a sponsor like us  You can buy the an area maybe twice the size of this room  and do what you want  So we were going to make it in like have get loads of PCs in there and the internet and have  just the whole Monster branded thing as if you 're like walking into a monster 's house or whatever  And just do what you want   Monster 's house  laughter  Monster world  Uhm so it 'll be that kind of idea but probably not to the same extent  because these internet cafes are going to have their own restrictions   So I suppose it has to be  tastefully  done a bit more so  And do you want me to kind of mock up  what the merchandise would look like  like coffee cups and  I mean don't go into too much effort  but maybe just  so they can   Well we have  we have the coffee cups so we just can take photographs of those and put  them on  some little montage of  different merchandising   Yeah   Yeah   So yeah the cafe part of it would have uhm the coffee cups maybe bags  If you could  put a bag on the counter or something  maybe like serviettes   What do you do in an  interca  in an internet cafe  You eat things and you look at the Web and you write  things down   You look at the  we  I 'll show you one  The one on Dawson Street is actually really good  You walk in the door and basically  and they 've a stand  a counter kind of here  like maybe the size of that desk  Yeah  And behind they 've loads of cookies and popcorn  couple of sandwiches like uhm  you know those orangejuicy milkshake-type things  and then they 've a coffee machine  And then just here they 've maybe four small enough tables  with like two or three stools  Yeah  Around each one  And then all in there 's is like  I 'd say about twenty laptops on uh  on either side  And then in the middle there 's another twenty  Right  and then on the  the wall is all glass so you know  you can have posters or whatever on the glass so that when people are walking by they 'll also see it  We can uhm  branded notepads  and pens at  every work station or whatever  Yeah   Yeah the only like uhm  The thing I don't want to price too much is  too  Free stuff  2 sylls  laughter  Yeah like to always have again Monster pens there  because it it might just work out a waste  I suppose the most important thing is really the stuff on the walls  and  on the computers the  you know the  The screensavers I suppose will just be our  or not the screensavers but the home page  hopefully will be our home page   Yeah   The  Things like that  You know that fly and stuff  points to art on wall  I suppose that would  be like the monster   That 's a  bee Felice  laughter  it 's called a bee   Obviously  Uhm  you know little Trumpy things sitting  around the place   Yeah  Would it would it be the actual Monster dot IE home page   Yeah  You wouldn't have a special splash page for the Monster cafe  Cos that 's  it 's kind of boring to be honest with you  the home page one  I was thinking of the home page just cos people might recognise it  but yeah  Maybe that 's a good idea to have the  the new one  with Jill Branded  You know something with  Something more like the brochure that 's just the bright orange  maybe that as the screensaver  Yeah screensaver  Exactly yeah   That would  be the screensaver  And then that like hopefully we 'd have  the home page as  ours   Behind the  when  it wakes up  Okay   Yeah   And then you can log in to whatever address if you don't want to go to Monster   Yeah I was looking the other day just to try and find pictures of internet cafes  They 're not brilliant  Yeah  But we might be able to use one of them  Yeah I 've got three  So I was thinking it would be good if I could sneak in with a digital camera and kind of take a few photographs of one  but that would probably piss someone off  You see I 'm just  If you go into the one in Dawson Street and then I meet him and go  well  this is our little spy who was in the other day  And I  it might be better  yeah but then when I meet them  Yeah   I could go in some other company
