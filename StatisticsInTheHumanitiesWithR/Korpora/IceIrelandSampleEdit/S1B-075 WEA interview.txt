<S1B-075 WEA interview>  Now if I could start by asking you can you briefly describe  your committee involvement to date  laughter  Not  you don't need to go into any of that but just uh generally where you are at the moment   Right right right  well I  I 've always been involved in community work  uh  voluntary community work  I 'm Chair of Fermanagh Women 's Aid  I have  been since nineteen ninety  two  Founder member of Fermanagh Women 's Network  I 'm  committee member of that  I sit on the Local  Partnership now which is the Local Strategy whatever crowd they call themselves now  It used to be the District Partnership  and it 's the Local Strategy Partnership now  I uhm was chair in within that then there was sub-committees and there was different programmes so there was a victim 's programme and because of my interest in Women 's Aid I was asked would I sit on that  Right   Uh-huh   Okay   Right   Mhm  And then I was asked would I chair it  Right  So I was like a token I felt I was a token woman but there you know or as you know yourself there wasn't  you know  and   In Women 's  Aid  in in I  was asked to chair this new victim a victim 's uhm  Sorry   Oh right  In uh in I I  wrote it down here so I 'd I 'd remember  If you don't mind uh  You 're  fine   Me  reading at it  It was uhm  right I was I uh uh I there was an advisory group set up within the District Partnership and uhm there was about six of us on it  And I was asked to chair  So I said I would chair  and I  didn't have much to do in it but anyway I I  So that that now has been uh  stepped down  Everybody is asked to stand down because the  the new partnership changed  the  District Partner  changed to be the Local Strategy Group  Now they and Omagh and Strabane have jointly come together  Some of their  relatives form a new trauma group you know for with the Lakelands Sperrin Trust  Okay   Right   Mhm  So now I 'm a I 'm a member of that an ordinary member of that  That 's  only a new group  We just have had one meeting  Okay   Right  In that and that 's down in Omagh  And that 's look at all the trauma of the Troubles  that  kind of stuff you know  2 sylls  that at home  with me local uhm  what do you call it  community association like I 'd be involved in that you know and help to run things for kids and different things  In the meantime I 'm trying to get off a couple of me uhm  what do you call it uh  maybe the network now at their AGM I might resign from that cos I 'm in from the very beginning  you know  you you get energy goes up and goes down you  know  But uhm  that 's me involvement in  the community   Right   Right   Mhm   Right   you 'd be quite at quite a regional level really  Aye I think I would  I forgot also that I 'm a member of NIWAF in Belfast The Northern Ireland Women 's Federation  I 'm on  the management board  Oh right   Right so you 're quite involved  then   I would   I would  And when did you become when did you move to  go from say local to regional  When would you say that that  how long have you been involved at a regional level  How many years   In in  well I 'd say in the last four or five  you know  Yeah yeah yeah   Four or five years  Alright  Well I 'll have to tailor this to suit cos I 'm  sort of expecting people to be at local  looking  at going on to  2 sylls   Are you thinking of getting involved in a public body  at all   Yes that 's right   Yeah  I am I 'm looking at the Arts and uhm  I 've wrote it down here somewhere now  Oh well don't worry  It doesn't   It 's uh the  the uhm  where am I now  the Department of  Culture  Arts and Leisures  In my spare spare time I like to paint  laughter   Culture   Right  And I would would 've done different things and  had a few exhibitions over the years  Years ago now  Right  But and then with all the other involvement I kind of but I 'd like to get back into it  But I 'd be interested in that Arts  Council  and stuff like that  So  that 's where Wendy and then maybe drop a few of my other things you know  Right   Right   Right  But I 'll keep on Women 's Aid and I 'll keep on the Victim Support you know  Okay uhm  you see when you became involved in public life  was  there anything that worried you about it  Mm   Och aye  Uhm I had a low self-esteem you know and I thought uh  do I know anything or you know the lack of knowledge  Would I be stupid or would I come out with things you  know and  But I learned just to listen  You know I 'd be a good listener now  Mhm   Right  And uhm  I remember one woman annoying me because she kept repeating what some man said to beside her  Mhm  And then I thought well you know she mightn't be that stupid like you know cos she was agreeing with him you know  And yet I think no that 's not the way I would go  But I would just take into account and listen to what people were doing and different especially this Partnership meeting cos it 's so deep things that they 're talking about and half of them 's all  bullshit for here  laughter  And I did say that one day that a meeting was going on and on  And I says excuse me I said  in my ignorance I says but I have give up my time to come here today  You some of them are there  paid to be there  statutory you know  And I said there 's an awful lot of bullshit being talked about  And they all started to laugh   know  And and the meeting was over in about twenty minutes  after that  Do you know  So like I mean maybe that 's  pa  but I 've got me voice now but then at the very beginning oh it was  you know  Do I know anything or what do I know  laughter  You know that kind of an oul doubting  you know  A lot of women would doubt themselves if they 'd had the capabilities  And then yet  when you get in and you get a bit of training and you  know  I think it 's   Yeah mhm   Right   Right  2 sylls    Yeah   Mhm   What do you think gives it gives you your voice  makes you more  I think you have to be passionate to do it to change things  Is that what motivated you  Mm oh God God  I 'll get onto that in a   How what did what did you hope to get out of the experience  Apart from just changing things  what would you  you yourself  I don't know   I think it came from me schooling  Because I was schooled at a time in the  fif  forty fifties fifties when uhm women weren't you know supposed to look up or do anything  And at school I was told I 'd never amount to anything  laughter  Bad thing  So I think that 's what motivated me then  Uh when I reared me family  star  they started to  to leave the nest I started to look outside and think yeah I could do them things you  know  A bit like your man in the Black you know I could do that you  know  reference to character in 'Boys From the Black Stuff'  But uhm I think it 's being told you 're you 're no good at anything and then knowing rightly you are you know  that 's  that kind of thing  That 's probably motivated me way back to go out and do stuff  Mhm   Right   Mhm   Right  And then I had a passion for for uhm against violence of any kind like in domestic violence we we started up here you know so  Still I 'm in it you know so  That 's I suppose passion for the subjects and passion for to change  things  but also a bit of personal you know I could do I can do better  than  I have been doing you know  Cos I would 've been that type of uh in that era where I left work when I got married had me family didn't go back til work  but did menial jobs like cleaning houses and stuff  And I think of what I did do you know  Uh-huh   Uh-huh   Mhm  Like but anyway  and then I you know thinking I wasn't good enough for a long long time  and then I realised  yeah to develop myself yeah  Right to to to develop yourself   Uhm and you said now you mentioned already you it took a while to develop your voice and that  that you were  really nervous to  speak and that  Uhm what uhm have you any current worries or concern about your role  That 's right   Mm oh yeah   Aye in the Partnership I feel maybe I 'm not speaking out enough because I 'm there to represent women 's groups in Fermanagh  you  And with the new money coming now from peace too it it 's all towards uhm economic you know and there 's no money for groups now or you know it 's very hard to access money  Right   Mhm  And uh I know any of me other community you see there 's seven people from the community on it  There 's seven from the council  And there 's seven from  statutory bodies  Mhm  And there 's another one there 's another one uh business and something  But it 's all geared towards business and stuff  And the lock of pound that they 're throwing out they 're throwing it out through training  Mhm  You know or through sports and stuff like you  know  So I uh I the last partnership that I was on I had a better voice in it  Right   Right  Because it was all working for the community and there was applications coming in and we were sitting going through a stack of applications and you felt you were doing something  You were saying right that wee play group needs something  or that  one there maybe has got money from somewhere else so we we 'll look at it later  You know you  you were kind of given a a role  But this time it 's all more of a talking shop and there seems to be decisions you know made before and brought to the meeting you know to  for  ratification you know that kind of thing you know  So I don't feel as empowered as I did on the but yet I 'm delighted to be in on this victim 's group   several sylls   some group you know  Mhm   Mhm   Mhm   Uhm  Maybe I 'm talking too much  laughter   No no no  Is there any aspects of of the involvement you find psychologically off-putting  Aye now there 's a  Don't don't  3 sylls  you need to answer  straight away or   No I know  I know  Psycho  well I suppose you see you 'd you 'd be  I have been I know I have been used in photographs and there 's even this week 's hair report on hair and makeup but that was me own because I went to for Women 's Aid  But in stuff for the partnership  I would be pulled in for photographs as a token woman
