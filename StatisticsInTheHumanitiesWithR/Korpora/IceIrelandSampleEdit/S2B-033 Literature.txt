<S2B-033 Literature>  An essential component in  the story of Irish expression is the literature produced in this country in the various languages spoken and written here over the centuries  For this programme  which we 've entitled A Quilt of Many Patches I 'm joined by Declan Kiberd who is a lecturer in Anglo-Irish literature  yet one I think who is profoundly suspicious of the very term Anglo-Irish literature  Am I right in saying this Declan  Well yes indeed  I feel about Anglo-Irish literature a little bit the way the Soviet leader Lenin said he felt about theology  that sometimes it seemed a subject without an object  Uhm the term obviously comes from the  Anglo-Irish Ascendancy class in Ireland  who indeed in say the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth century were the main writers of literature in English on the island  But it 's highly problematic  in the nineteenth and twentieth century  clearly ridiculous to describe figures like  Brendan Behan or Seamus Heaney who had nothing whatsoever to do with  the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy  So we really do need another term  The problem is if we use a term like Irish Literature  we have to ask where does that leave writing in the Irish language  Are we sort of appropriating writing in English for Ireland  which would be a very incorrect thing to do  arguably as racist a mistake as the mistake of calling all Irish writing in English Anglo-Irish  So in a way it seems to me to try and get to understand the subject and what it is  Irish writing in English  we 've got to look at all the labels  realising that in a way any label is a barbarism  It 's going to be leaving out things as well as letting things in  But if we could find a more ecumenical term that wasn't banal  I think it would be better  The problem for me with Anglo-Irish  apart from these other questions I 've raised  is that it also  feeds the notion that  Anglo-Irish literature is in some strange way an exotic offshoot  of the English Literature department and the main uh plant from which it derived  And I think that impoverishes our understanding of the ways in which writing in Ireland  has much in common with the writings of many other peoples in other parts of the world like India  Africa and Latin America who 've gone through the whole process of colonisation and decolonisation and with whom we 've everything in common  And I think it would be much more intelligent to study our writings alongside theirs  rather than alongside the great tradition of Jane Austen and imperial England  uhm this polemical piece I 've put together is really a sort of exploration  along those lines uhm uh a looking at each term and a search for a better one musical interlude   To the famous claim that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world  the English writer W H Auden sarcastically replied  Such a description would better fit the secret police  In Ireland however  we do things a bit differently  James Joyce vowed that he would  forge the uncreated conscience of my race  no less  and a contemporary poet such as Seamus Heaney  can hardly appear on television without being asked if he has a solution to the Northern Ireland question  a solution be it added  which has eluded some of the world 's most ingenious politicians for almost a century now  And yet there isn't anything terribly strained or ludicrous  about these connections  between politics and poetry  Our State after all  was founded  by a group of poets and playwrights in the building behind me  the General Post Office in Dublin  over seventy-five years ago  and in its early days that State asked W B Yeats to head up the committee redesigning its coinage  In our own time our banknotes bear likenesses of many writers such as Swift  such as Yeats himself  Under the Brehon laws of ancient Ireland  the  file  or poet  doubled as a  breitheamh  or judge  and he was second only to the chieftain in the political pecking order  He was his leader 's chief adviser  and primary publicist  combining the merchandising opportunism of the ad man with the political guile of a government press secretary  He counselled on war and peace  he named the warrior dead in elegies  The English occupiers of Ireland  sensing the power of these poets  saw them as enemies to be exterminated  The Elizabethan English poet Edmund Spenser  saw to it that Gaelic manuscripts of Munster were cut into little squares to make covers for English language text books  The speech being Irish  he remarked tersely  the heart needs must be Irish  Well Irish literature has in consequence a bit of a labelling problem  not so much an identity but an identification problem  The three centuries between the sixteen hundreds and the nineteen hundreds witnessed the decay of the Irish language and the emergence of an Anglo-Irish tradition  But this tradition passed  like the writings of so many emerging English-speaking peoples through a colonial  and then a semi-indigenous  and finally a national phase  The more debilitated  Irish became  the more did Irish writing in English feed parasite-like  off its ebbing energy  The very richness of Hiberno-English is due in large measure to a Gaelic substratum of syntax and of imagery  In the Dublin of Jonathan Swift  one third of the city was still Irish-speaking  but the changeover to English was happening so rapidly that many people continued to think in Irish while using English words  Swift noted with great interest the spread of Gaelic loanwords among country squires  A word for instance like  spalpeen  which means a travelling  journeyman or a labourer  the kind of person into whom many of the Gaelic poets had turned  In his famous dialogue in Hybernian Stile Swift noted the use of many Gaelic phrases carried over into English  I wonder what is gone with them  meaning I wonder what has happened to them  In the colonial period that followed  English books were seen  not just as story entertainments  but as etiquette manuals  which could teach unruly natives how to live  So people read Jane Austen not just for pleasure  but to study the art of deportment  of correct speech and so on  Austen when she wrote  did so in the knowledge that the values she admired were also embodied in the judiciary  the church  the government of England and so forth  But an Irish writer living under English occupation had no such assurance  Literature was the one remaining institution which kept the ideal of a renovated Irish nation alive  Yet these writers also learned to use texts as blueprints for a remodelled community  for an underground nation  for a Utopian ideal  It was indeed an awesome responsibility  It followed that Irish writers showed scant interest in making realistic portrayals of an environment which they really felt they should be contesting  Hence their love of fantasy  of magical effects  of surreal exaggeration  And yet their soaring imaginations never quite lost touch with the actual  Living in two cultures  Irish and English  for the price of one  kept them alert and it kept them ironical  It gave them a love of wit and of wordplay  and an ironic distrust of all simple labels  Swift admired this new linguistic resourcefulness of the Hiberno-English dialect  but he realised that it might be sneered at in England as a deviation from the human  ie the English norm  This is why all his writings are so obsessed with the difference between official and unofficial culture and why he seems at times more interested in ways of seeing  than in the things seen  So for instance in Gulliver 's Travels  you have a tremendous contrast set up between the massive Brobdingnagians on the one hand and the pygmy-like Lilliputians on the other  giving us a sense of how tremendously precarious really is anybody 's hold on a culture  this was to be of course a feature of all Anglo-Irish writing  ability of the writer to take a stand outside the culture  and to look at man and woman as if they were almost inhuman witnesses of themselves  Now in the eighteenth century the Ireland of Swift and Goldsmith was  often seen as a place of elegance  We still look at it like that today  The exterior serenity  the show of serenity put on by the Anglo-Irish  was particularly notable in their architecture  When you look at Gandon 's Custom House you 're looking at a building  done by a man who literally wanted to build for eternity  but this confidence could never mask an inner sort of insecurity  The Protestant Ascendancy held power but they were only one fifth of the population  constantly in jeopardy  It would be no  exaggeration of language to say that in a sense the Protestant Ascendancy were  the first Provisionals  Uhm Edmund Burke who actually called them a junto of robbers was if you like obsessed as a result by a kind of split in his own personality  between on the one hand  the Irish Burke if you like who sympathised with those who had to live in a revolutionary situation  and on the other hand the English Burke who had a love of order justice and decorum  Uhm this is why of course he understood revolutionary France so well  He saw it really as a metaphor for the  very discontented Ireland in which he had grown up  Swift wanted to facilitate a much smoother relation between England and Ireland in  his writings  but we know from experience that he like all the Anglo-Irish  felt increasingly an Irish person in England and an English person in Ireland  part of a spiritually  hyphenated people  And it was inevitable under these strains  that all of these writers  would eventually veer towards the Irish rather than the English end of the spectrum  Edmund Burke saw a similar significance  in Grattan 's Parliament of seventeen eighty-two  of which Burke wrote  as the English in Ireland began to be domiciliated  they began also to recollect that they had a country   Two generations later another Trinity graduate  Thomas Davis  would recycle that famous phrase  In a speech to Trinity 's Historical Society he told his fellow students  gentlemen you have a country  Before his early death Davis became famous as the author of many patriotic ballads  such as A Nation Once Again  For all that verbiage  deriving from English Romantic kitsch  these ballads provided the basis of a popular Nationalist culture  They make Davis representative of the second phase in Irish writing  the moment when writing in English becomes semi-indigenous  National in content  but still addressing itself in English forms to English liberal wellwishers whose consciences might yet be stirred  And this illustrates one of the great paradoxes of nineteenth-century Irish nationalism  Its message might be Irish but it was always encased in English  People had to learn English if they were to defend themselves in court  or if they were to write threatening letters to their landlords  The situation of the native language was dire indeed  It would only be redeemed  in eighteen ninety-three with the foundation of the Gaelic League  by Douglas Hyde  yet another Trinity graduate  And with that movement  went a literary movement led by Yeats for what Yeats himself called the de-Davisation of Irish literature  This was indeed the beginning of the third phase  the moment when forms as well as themes would become Irish indeed  A flood of translations from Irish  now overwhelmed the book shelves  none more influential than the epic story of Cuchulain  the ancient hero who defended the north single-handed  Intended by the first translator Standish O'Grady as a role model for the demoralised Anglo-Irish aristocracy still reeling from the Land War  Cu/ Chulainn was instead adopted as an exemplar by the clerks and schoolmasters of the Gaelic League  some of whom followed Patrick Pearse in ritual re-enactment of his sacrifice  in the nineteen sixteen Rising  Cu/ Chulainn died strapped to a rock  like Jesus Christ on the Cross  but not before he had beheaded many enemies in classic saga fashion  his combination of pagan aggression and Christ-like passivity  made him a version of the muscular Christians favoured by British public schools in the nineteenth century  The glorious Celtic past allowed to the natives  turned out to be on inspection  a disguised version of the British imperial present
