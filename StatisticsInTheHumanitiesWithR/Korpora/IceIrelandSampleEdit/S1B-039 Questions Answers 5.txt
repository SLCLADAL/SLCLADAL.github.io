<S1B-039 Questions Answers 5>  And that we 're seeing that at at a period when the British Government so far does not seem to be moving with any real speed with any real sense of where it 's going  Uh and it seems to be putting up the question of arms as though it 's a hurdle to be got over before substantive political talks can start  I think anybody with any notion of Irish history can see that there 's been no point in any of the the transitions from armed struggle to politics by any party whether that 's Fianna Fa/il whether it 's more recently uh the Official IRA  whether indeed it 's the Ulster Volunteer Force uhm you know if you if you look in the early part of the century nobody has ever come to a point at which they said right we 're now once and for all and forever giving up the arms and we 're completely political  There 's always been a period in which those questions have been open  It seems to me those questions has to be left open and that political talks should begin in the meantime and it seems to me also that it 's quite urgent that that starts happening now because we really are seeing signs uh that this process could be in trouble  What Enniskillen you think for instance  Well yes I mean uhm clearly the planting of a bomb nobody seems to know quite who has done it  uhm but it it 's a very serious act  It isn't like uhm the the previous terrible shooting in Newry which did have the appearance of being something that nobody had actually planned or set out to do  If you put a bomb somewhere you have to sit down and plan that  We don't know who 's responsible but clearly there are a lot of dark horses around  There are a lot of people who would quite happily disrupt this process uh and really uh you know  it 's   And they  could be coming from anywhere in the spectrum  couldn't they   Could come from  anywhere  I mean even possibly from  from forces of the state  from rogue forces uh in the British state itself  We really don't know uh and we have to be very very careful with that but what seems to be critical is uh that substantive political talks and not just talks about talks begin between the British Government and Sinn Fe/in  With the arms issue at the top of the agenda  With the arms issue there as one of the the uh the parts of the agenda but but again it has to be recognised that the issue of arms is not simply a question of the IRA  The the question of arms is in itself complex  It 's a question uh also of of the president of of of the British Army uhm basically it 's a question of I mean there were photographs in some of the British newspapers over the weekend for instance uh of the UDA uhm out on patrol you know in uniforms with arms  There are arms on a lot of different sides and that process clearly has to be handled with some delicacy but if you simply put up for each side of that this kind of direct hurdle that you must give up the arms before you begin uh substantive political talks then it seems to me that that the process could be in very serious trouble  Nell McCafferty what is your view  You were in Derry over the weekend  What 's the view there  Uh I take it that question refers to the arms held by the IRA  Uh well it it refers  yes it refers to the arms held by the IRA as a prerequisite for involving them in inclusive talks  Sinn Fe/in  It 's uh a silly stance to take in the first place  As we all know  the IRA has no intention of decommissioning arms until a political  solution has been arrived at  It 's a perfectly sensible and serious way to go about matters  First you stop the guns and speaking as a Northerner  sitting down here  it 's a smashing thing to sit in Northern Ireland for the first time in twenty-five years  We 're all happy and we don't believe we 're going to get shot  You then ask yourself why were those guns ever used in the first place how do we avoid it now and you bring about a political solution  And then when the political solution is there you turn round to the British Army and say put away your guns  to the RUC to the IRA and to the Loyalists and that they will do  I don't know anybody wants to start a war  I don't even know anybody insisting at this moment on the decommissioning of arms  The British Government indicated over the weekend they 've changed their stance  that they 'll settle for some kind of uh  suggestion or recognition that of course with the political solution in place the arms will be decommissioned  They 've got that  The IRA I think has  uh  several sylls    Now what they say  what they said is that they would need verification that the arms had been decommissioned  No no they 've gone further beyond that  They want an  indica  indication that such will be done  Just as the IRA wants an indication that the British will decommission their arms and that the RUC will be disarmed  That all sounds perfectly logible logical to me  There 's no need for every  body to get uh upset about it   But but but that equals  a   That actually equals a pacifist state at the end of the day  I mean  Wouldn't it be wonderful  It but have you  can you give an example of it in history  I can't uh I mean the pacifist state business worries me because as you say I was in Derry over the weekend and I saw the future and I did get worried as I say it was  There 's a uh Lundy was being burned  The Unionists were out again celebrating their history or commemorating it  For the first time in twenty-five years the shops remained open  the City Gates remained open  People were walking about  Things were grand  And then the RUC intervened  For example they said to me I couldn't go and watch Lundy as a journalist they wouldn't accept my press card  They said where 's your camera I said I 'm not a photographer they said where 's your dictaphone I said I haven't got a dictaphone and they ordered me to move on in case I 'd be arrested  I said I 'm making a complaint  I ended up down at the police station at nine o'clock in the evening  I walked into the police station and the public area there 's twenty young people there aged from about eighteen to twenty-four  They had been in a minibus  hired a minibus to go across to Donegal to dance because we 're afraid of the drink-driving laws in the North  We 're very conscientious   The RUC   And what about  the drink-driving laws in Donegal  The RUC pulls the minibus in off the road  All the young people are chuntered into the police station  The driver is taken away for questioning they 're sitting there the young people saying why is this being done to us  The driver is released but I looked at the RUC and I looked at the young people as the police said you can go now  And I saw those young people looking at the RUC and saying who are these people  They aren't the ones in charge of us  And I thought back twenty-five years ago I faced the RUC  Then they only had a revolver  These young people faced the RUC on Saturday there 's no IRA no British Army nobody  And they faced an RUC that had revolvers  machine guns  armoured cars  They 're facing what is not a police force but a legalised paramilitary group that does not know how to be a police force so there 's just intent on doing battle  And I said to myself if they don't arrive at a solution  over the next five years  then the next generation is gonna look and say what has been done to us  It is extremely worrying but this I would say  the ceasefire will hold  No problem  There will be no resumption of war  The British Army doesn't want it  The government doesn't want it the British Government  IRA doesn't want it Sinn Fe/in doesn't want it  Ir  Irish Government doesn't want it so would they stop talking about the guns and start for once talking about a solution  Dermot Ahern  What 's your opinion on this  Well you you forgot to mention the people don't want it  I think the people on the ground don't want the war to to resume Nell  I am the people Dermot  laughter  You 're one of the people  You 're one of the people  Uhm just on this issue of the arms uhm I think if you listen to what uh John Bruton and Proinsias de Rossa have said over the last number of days they 've to a certain extent changed their stance  Uh when they were in opposition they were saying that uh you know the arms should be given up before any political talks but uh even Proinsias de Rossa yesterday mentioned this phrase of you know that it 's up to politicians to ensure that the uhm arms remain silent and I think that 's really the the nub of of of what is up to the politicians now because for twenty-five years we 've had this mayhem uh we have to a certain extent convinced those who were perpetrating that uh to come in into the democratic fold and it 's to keep them there and that 's what we should be concentrating keeping them in  in at the talks  And we have to be pragmatic about it  I mean if all the arms are are given up uhm uh that the IRA have and that the the Loyalist paramilitaries have at the moment there 's nothing to stop them from buying more arms uh in the years to come  So you know I think we have to be pragmatic  It is one of the most crucial issues in the whole thing just as the amnesty for prisoners and the re-integration of people who were previously involved in  in violence   But but  who else will go to the talks  The Ulster Unionists say they there 's no way they can go to the table and retain their  credibility  and talk with Sinn Fe/in if they are guns under the table as  they would put it   But if you   Yes but if you listen  to to Roy Magee who who in effect is representing you know the former Loyalist paramilitaries or you know he 's one of the people who has  several sylls   Yeah   Yes  But he makes the point and you you know you might as well be listening to to Gerry Adams speaking when you hear him  Basically he 's saying that you know that there has to be a pragmatic solution in regard to the uh arms both on both sides but that uh it it shouldn't be made a pre-condition because in effect you 're coming to a full stop  You will come to a full stop  I think we have to be pragmatic and I think most of the politicians who were involved in the in the process and I think John Bruton and Proinsias de Rossa now that they 're in government realise that it 's while in opposition you can call for for for these things to be done  In government it 's extremely difficult when when the whole scenario 's explained to them properly  Yes Proinsias de Rossa said the arms should fall silent let them kind of rust away  John Bruton was saying it 's important to resolve this not to get into a standoff about it  He 's a more neutral  But it did that  But in both cases it 's a change  Yeah  Derek Murphy who asked the question  What 's your own opinion  Well I think we 've all appreciated over the last three months the peace that is there now and the potential of the peace in the future and I think to put a prerequisite on it may help to destroy it considering what we saw last night and considering what Fintan O'Toole said about the history  There has been no history of the handing over of arms in the past if you go right back  I think it 's a very sensitive issue and it has to be dealt with that way
