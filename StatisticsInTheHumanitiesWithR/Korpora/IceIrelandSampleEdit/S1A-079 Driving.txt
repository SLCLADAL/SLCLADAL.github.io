<S1A-079 Driving>  Did you drive  I didn't no  I 'm still finding driving very hard to be honest with you  I drove we were going out to dinner the other night  and uhm  I was driving fine  but the the car is old and the gears are very hard to change anyhow  And I can't park at all because  I can't put that  amount  of effort into my hand  I just couldn't we arrived down we were going for dinner uhm  in a wee place down off George 's Street  And 'twas fairly busy and there was a perfect parking space and all I had to do was reverse into it and I couldn't get into reverse  I had to stop in the middle of George 's Street get out of the car  let Daniel move over to the driving seat  laughter   Yeah   And park it  With the entire naturally enough when they saw a woman  driving  the entire  population sitting behind me in the car is going berserk  Like I mean you could 've parked a truck  in  this space but I just couldn't manage the  the  gear change  I 'm not really kind of taking the car out  that much  He had to drive home then as well  I I kind of find that that pulling on it  is just too sore  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah Mam hurt her hand  She fell over a caddy car  She was golfing  Don't ask  laughter  I am telling you it was so embarrassing  Not big enough for her  yeah   Tall  woman  laughter   She is tiny  But anyway she fell over and she couldn't change the gears in the car but she had to drive  So she 'd take Padraig  and she 'd go okay I 'm pressing the clutch and he had to change them  for her   When  we were coming down uhm town that 's what I was  doing  And I was going  press the clutch  1 word   and he cos he  wouldn't be familiar with uh  gearshift  anyhow  because  he 'd normally  drive automatic  And I 'm there going first  That 's not first  laughter   Right   Yeah   Yeah    6 sylls    Yeah  And the gears is going  screech   Yeah  And I 'm going no no no  This is not working at  all  So in the end it was easier for him to drive  Yeah   Yeah or else you 're here trying to steer with your left and reach your right the whole way  over here   Oh yeah   which doesn't  it 's uh driving 's not it 's not that bad now but  I can't park unless I 'm just driving into a big long space which very often in town you 're not going to find something  you can glide into  And I definitely cannot put it into reverse  My hand just I if I can just get my right hand over  But I 've not got a lot of power in my  right hand  I 've to get my right hand over and try and put the car in reverse  laughter  When I thought about it though oh God out in the middle  of George 's Street  I was mortified  I really was embarrassed  And then I was saying that to you we were walking up George 's Street on Friday  I met Daniel after college and and we were just walking back up uhm to Rathmines  We were coming up George 's Street and it was  after five  Like it was a busy time  And uh this motor bike came flying out from the middle of I do not know where right underneath a car  Definitely not yeah   Yeah   George 's Street yeah   Oh was he alright  He wasn't actually  He wasn't too good at all  But the poor girl driving the car was in  bits  Oh she was  absolutely  I felt I mean I know it was terrible for him but I felt so sorry for her  Bits  Oh Jesus   Yeah at least it had happened to him  Yeah she  was just   That 's not  some consolation to  her   Yeah   There was nothing anybody could 've done  It was very  it was wet and oily and it had been raining  It had been that Friday it had been absolutely lashing and it was very wet  the two of them were kind of travelling  but even if they hadn't been  you know  it wouldn't 've really mattered  He just went  he just came directly right under her car  He came off the bike  The bike hit the car  and he came right under her wheels  Oh man  I know  And me being mega cool of course  laughter  I 'm there going  oh God oh God  And I 'm there I 'm kind of  hanging onto Daniel and then I 'm going right right  I 'm a nurse  laughter  Right  we 're going over to have a look  Are are we ready  laughter  You 'd swear I was going in to perform surgery  laughter   And he 's there  am I ready am I ready  and we 're not ready  We 're  not ready  You 're not ready  I can see you 're not ready  Yeah    I felt such an eejit  Thought about  2 sylls  But it 's just  it wasn't even that I didn't really see him go under at all I just heard it  Mm  And it was the most horrific sound  But I think he had so much he had all he had all the gear on all the leather  stuff on  so I think that probably saved him  quite a lot of damage obviously  He he was  sort of conscious  He wasn't really conscious  I 'd say he was fine you know  I 'd say he was  It was a bit horrific now  It was very scary  Oh yeah  You can't imagine I mean she was  she was so hysterical  She really was  I felt really sorry for her  You know and she was kind of there going she  you know saying there was nothing I could do  And there  wasn't  anything she could do  But still like I felt sorry for her  Yeah   Sure you know like if a dog runs out in front of you  And  you run  you know the way dogs come at the side of the car and they just go under  your back wheel  and you can't do anything about and the dog is dead  And you 're here like going but I couldn't do anything  And you feel  so bad   Mm   Yeah oh yeah   You feel  I you 've murdered  something  Yeah  Mm  We were coming up the road  I was bringing my mother up  She wanted to get wallpaper or something a couple of weeks ago  And I was driving up  the main road  laughter  a fairly busy road and this dog was crossing it  Now the dog would 've had time to dance across the road never mind walk across it  My mother  eventually spotted it  I had spotted him from way back but she hadn't spotted it until much much later  She grabs my arm  laughter  on the gear like  I had my  hand sitting on top of  the gear  She grabs my arm and pulls it  laughter  Now my  my gear arm was kind of over on my mother 's lap  And I 'm would you let go  laughter  I see it  It 's fine  And she 's here going nearly cutting the circulation off going  Easy to know she 'd never been a driver like  Oh dear God  3 sylls   Yeah   You 've put me off driving now  Ah no driving 's grand  It 's very nerve-wracking  Ah you get used to it  I remember when I was  like when I was learning how to drive and kind of coming through town and uh  traffic lights of course were the big you know boo-boo  And I 'm there and I 'd see these traffic lights  you know kind of down at the end of the road and they 'd be green  laughter  and of course I 'd speed up  laughter   I didn't want to have to stop cos then the car was going to conk out  So you 'd come haring up to these traffic lights at a ridiculous speed and then they 'd change and then you 've to hit  claps hands  the brakes  laughter  And nearly kill the poor devil that 's beside you  So we were coming up to these traffic lights  My brother was teaching me how to drive  And we were coming up  those the traffic lights were red so I had to stop anyhow  There was a car in front of me  And Tadhg goes  now I 'm coming up I had intentions of stopping obviously this car was stopped in front of me  and Tadhg goes Ais hit the brakes  And I was kind of thinking oh I 'll hit them in a minute  And he goes Ais hit the brakes  And I was still driving on  laughter  Hit the fucking brakes  laughter  And of course then I lammed on the brakes  went into floods of tears got out of the car  in the middle of the street in town going I 'm not driving any more  laughter  being the kind of calm female that I am  We arrived home anyhow  He drove home  neither of us speaking to each other of course  And uhm we we were both still living at home at the time  and that was the end of that  My mother says no way  either one of ye move out of the house  or you stop teaching  her how to drive because it was just causing such  Oh 'tis impossible I think when a member of your family  Yeah  my dad used to get so mad  Yeah   Oh  I wouldn't talk to him and he wouldn't talk to me  And I 'd be going back to Dublin  1 word  in  floods of tears  'Twasn't that bad like  Are you serious   Yeah  Forgotten now   And what and he  used to kind of yell at you or that  And it was  the the brake  thing  I usen't to drive I used to drive on the main road on Sunday morning  There was no cars  Yeah   Yeah  If a car was like  twenty-five hundred yards in front of me  I used to slow down  and pull into the side like  laughter  I 'd be afraid I 'd bash into it  If one came up if one passed me out I 'd go  near  nearly be in the field beside you know  Oh I used to get I still get hysterical but  I don't drive very often  either  3 words    I don't think it 's a good  idea to let a member of your family teach you  Especially a male member  Unless well my Dad taught me and then my mother took over  But I think it 's different for me  I used to drive from Newmarket to Ballybunion which is a good forty miles  Yeah  I 'd just get in the car in Newmarket and they 'd tell me I had to go to Ballybunion  Mm  And in fact it 's such a it 's a desperate road now  It 's the worst road possible  It 's all windy wind  laughter  Windy winds  windy bends  It 's really bad  So there isn't an opportunity to get out of the car and let somebody take over  So you 're  stuck there  You have to drive it  and you 've to cross the main roads  I remember I used to hate that  I used to be so scared  Yeah   Coming from a kind of by-road  onto a   Yeah yeah  coming from a by-road onto a main road  You cross it  And you 'd like you go on the main road for about like that much and then you 've to cross off it  and it 's a blind bend  I still hate that  blind bend  I mean as my mother goes you go up to it  You look as best as you can and you put your foot down and you go  Yeah   Oh God yeah   Yeah like what can you do  Oh yeah  I mean people have got killed on that bend so much  Put your foot down and go  But I think that was how I learned  She just made me  drive  Even at they used make me drive a lot on my own  which I used to hate doing  You know when you 're you 're provisional and you 're not allowed  Mm   Mm  But I remember they used make me drive on my own  up and down the town  And we 're always sent for parts everywhere cos like Dad has a garage  Say he 'd send me off to Charleville like for windscreens and bumpers and  laughter  shit like that  And I 'd be here like driving away like  Hello I 'm from Philip Garavan 's  Looking for a back bumper there please  laughter  Who the hell is this  He still does it  He sends me off for a windscreen  He sent me for a windscreen to Charleville  And I went into this man  Hello I 'm looking for Fergus  He was painting  I didn't presume he was Fergus  He was painting the wall  Looking for Fergus  And he goes yeah  And I just went where 's Fergus  laughter  I am Fergus  I I beg your pardon  I 'm from Philip Garavan 's and I 'm looking for a windscreen  Can you point it out  He put it in the car right in such a way  I was like driving and the car the windscreen was coming that way but if it slipped it was going to cut my jugular  That 's all I could think of the whole way home  And it 's a really bad road  Cos he told me  drive down  1 syll  go on  You 'll be fine  but when you 're coming home make sure you go slow and don't break it
