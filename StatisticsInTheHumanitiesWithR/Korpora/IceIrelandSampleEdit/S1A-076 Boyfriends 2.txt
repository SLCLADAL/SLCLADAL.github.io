to you really  much   Oh I know  sure I haven't seen you in ages  Yeah   sure  between the two of them like I haven't time to do anything  You know what I mean  Because uhm  between meeting him some nights meeting Ciaran some nights  been home at least I mean I haven't been home  I told Jim I was heading home last night  I had to go out to Ciaran 's  So  I was in Ciaran 's  when was it

even half ten  Luckily he 's he has uhm a thing on tonight  and uhm he 's grand  Like that 's fine  Uhm   Yeah yeah   Mm   I rang your home the other night  and  Sue said to me  that uhm she she wasn't going  you were meeting Jim  And she kind of then said  you know  I hear a lot about Jim  And I started going  oh really  Yeah   Yeah  And uhm  I 'd say she kind of half  is wondering too  Oh no she knows  I 've told Sue you know what I mean  Um  Well I haven't told her  I 've just said I 'm very fond of him and we have you know  cos he was even going to on Tuesday  Tuesday night after being in the hospital he was going to call out to my house  Yeah  He was saying oh no would you like to would you go for a drink and now  when his drink is usually a coffee or something  You know what I mean  if we did  go for a drink   And uhm   Yeah   So it  mightn't be Ciaran at the ball  It might be   It might be  Jim   Jim   could be   wouldn't  I mean I don't know  I 'm so I 'm still like I 'm mad about Ciaran  You know what I mean  I really am  And I 'd  I 'd be very upset  and I know he 'd be absolutely devastated completely  Yeah   But you know the way you have kind of break in tape   But I don't  I really don't  I mean when I 'm with Ciaran and  we get on really well and  you  know and  he 'd do the world and anything for me   I know  that  And he 's so good and and everything    Yeah   Mm   Mm   That  top is lovely  Do you like that  Isn't it nice yeah  Yeah it is alright  Pia Bang was it  Yeah  Was it expensive  Eh sixty  odd   Do you  know where I saw a lovely  Where  Uhm thing today  It would be lovely on you actually  You know that shop in Powerscourt  You not  not  Kookai the one next to it  You know  near near  O'Brien 's  There 's this short kind of skirt in there  kind of a satiny finish to it  Real short  wrap around   satin  with kind of big  flowers one or two  and a lovely body to go with it  Really nice  Right   Oh yeah that I know it  Up near O'Brien 's right   Lovely yeah   Yeah   Yeah right   Lovely  Not too expensive  either   How much   I think the skirt is like forty  something and the body is  forty  Yeah gorgeous  dressy   Are you serious   Well what was it  didn't I buy   I 'll have to bring this yoke back  I bought this uhm skirt last week  I was  What 's this yoke  Right this thing is uhm  'twas a skirt I bought right  No it 's a skirt right  uh suede one  Now I bought it the other morning I was coming into work and I was pissed off going into work and I said feck it  I was down in  got the bus in  and getting the other bus up to Baggot Street  I got off the bus  clears throat  and went into Cleary 's  Now you know Miss Selfridge 's there  Thingamajig   Um  So I saw this skirt this suede skirt  And I was in the mood to buy something so I said feck it  What colour  black suede with buttons up the front  Now this skirt is like a belt  seriously  It 's about up to there  Yeah  And uhm  Seriously legs  Now seriously legs cos I  laughter  when I brought it into work I was showing John  And John was saying oh Jesus  He said you 're hardly going to go out in that  And then he was messing he was saying you 'd be dead right  No he but then he was saying you 'd be dead right  Jesus wouldn't I love to wear something like that  Now you know him  Yeah he would  Oh sure Jesus don't talk to me  So he was only in his element and he kept telling me like later on he was saying put on the dress  or put on the skirt  He said give us a laugh you know  Show us  And half loads of the people then were uhm  were coming over and they were saying show us show us the skirt you bought Emma  And I was saying no  no I 'm not showing you this thing  You know  Yeah  So anyway eventually I put it on  I had a dress on and I was pulling up  yanking up the dress  And they 're say oh my God you 're not going to go out in that are you  So I said of course I am  Isn't it grand  Yeah  And no I haven't actually I I think I 'll actually bring it back because I don't think I I would  have the nerve to wear it because I 'd be afraid actually  they have like  you know those clip buttons  laughter  not ones you you know them  You just could rip them off  laughter  And uhm not a bother like you just  clip  it open and and it comes  You wouldn't even have to  if you sat down John was saying try and sit down in it because it 's fairly tight  as well  Mm   So it might all split  Oh everything  The buttons 'd just fly open and it 'd fall off you  And come here does uhm Pete know about Jim and the whole thing  Well do you know was what I was supposed to do  Jim invited me over to London  to to Pete  We were supposed to go there two weeks ago  mm   Yeah  And I couldn't go down  I didn't want to then  because of Ciaran  Cos you know I  I didn't feel right doing that  So but now I would cos we were supposed to go to New York this weekend  myself and Jim  That would be  excellent   Oh I know  it would but I couldn't because of the  the  apartment   That 'd be the job  Uh on the  on budget  Oh yeah well no  It was going to be  what was it sixty quid  the flight  and   Sure  that 's for nothing  Oh I know and then accommodation would be about forty pounds or something like that  that would 've been brilliant  But I can't go so I might like put that off to some time near Christmas or something  If we could get it it 'd be great  Mm  So uhm I think that 's what we 'll do  So it 'd be brilliant wouldn't it  Did I tell you Louisa was out for dinner with Donall last weekend  no  Oh yeah we went to the party anyway  And  he kept saying to me at the party  uhm I think she 's very nice and all  this and   Right   Yeah   Is she good-looking  Ah she 's nice  She is nice  She 's very nice girl  She is she is  Lovely yeah  So anyway uhm  Cute or something or what  I  don't think I 've ever seen her  Yeah   Have you not  I don't know  Maybe I have  She 's speech therapist  Right yeah  Uhm she uhm  they went out for dinner to the Baton Rouge if you don't mind  Oh excuse me  Yeah so I think she 's very keen and I don't know if he 's so keen  or what he 's up to  Cos I  he rang me tonight  Yeah  And I was asking him what 's the story like  And  he was like well I 'm he 's off to Australia in January  Right   Is he really definitely leaving the shop and everything  Definitely  Yeah  He 's leaving  Giving over the car  apartment everything and going off cheffing in Australia  Ah fair play to him  He might as well do something of his own  you know what I mean rather than being in the pharmacy and you know working in there for the family and stuff  And as well he 's kind of obliged to do all sorts of hours  And  he 's rung up and they 're ringing him at every hand 's turn you know  Phoned up the whole time  and   Right yeah   Well then  at that I 'd say like do your own thing and go ahead you know  Yeah  Definitely  Mm  You see you know your own one inside there  Sally right  Yeah  That 's her name  She went out with Jim okay  Right  And she is so possessive of him still  She like if he 's even talking to another girl now it 's off a good while  about a year or so and he like he 's always saying that woman is paranoid  She 's a pain in the arse  Not a pain in the arse like he does like her but uhm  she just gets so paranoid if Jim is talking to another girl or anything you know  even when was it oh Jesus sure do you remember the night last  the two weeks ago when we were out and Michael Kinsella and everything  was out  re  wasn't that great craic   Yeah yeah  Who 's  Geoffrey going out with  I don't know some girl  I don't I 've never seen her  I don't know whether he 's interested or anything  But the party the next night that I was supposed to go to with Jim  in Liam Scanlon 's house  Yeah  Was meant to be  brilliant absolutely fantastic now really really good  This is where someone was rushed off to hospital  Liam himself and then going on the plane in an hour 's time and had to be chauffeur-driven and all this kind of craic  But the party I 'm really sorry I didn't go cos I think myself and Ciaran had a big huge row that night again  Again  Well not again but ah  after this week I mean you could say again like   mean last   So it 's  not very appropriate to say what are you getting Ciaran for Christmas  uh yeah it is
