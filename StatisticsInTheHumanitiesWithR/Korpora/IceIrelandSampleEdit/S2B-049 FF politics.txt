<S2B-049 FF politics>  I want Fianna Fa/il to be a modern party  a progressive party  a party in touch with the people  because that is what it has always been  Fianna Fa/il is unique in its ability to represent people  of every interest or background  We have enabled the Irish people  to bypass the sterility of divisive class politics  no matter how often the leopard tries to change his spots  or its agenda  applause  Instead  instead we have a tradition of consultation with all sections of society  We have to build on that tradition of social partnership  We have to listen  listen to what our people are really thinking and saying  The old certainties are gone  We are living in a complex world  We are a member of an international community  We face challenges  that are complicated  difficult and subtle  challenges that the old certainties won't meet  Yes we have beliefs  and we 'll not abandon them  Yes we have traditions  and we 'll not forget them  And yes we have values  We will not betray those values  applause  But now we need more much more  Fianna Fa/il has a vocation to be the party of modernisation  but still reflecting the deep attachment of the Irish people  to their own identity and ideals  Let me tell you what I believe this party is going to have to show to the country in the next few years  Openness  resolution  creativity  professionalism  and commitment  Openness  is not just in our dealings with media although that is important  We have to have a new openness  in dealing with each other  Because differences of opinion are good for us  It is unrealistic to expect that all members of such a great party  would agree with each other all the time  When I selected my cabinet  I clearly did not select people  who would agree with each other all the time  and they quickly proved me right  laughter  applause  This  this country does not need to speak with one voice  but what we do need  is the openness to listen to the voices we do not agree with  Openness goes further  Openness means not wasting time pretending that problems do not exist  or that mistakes have not been made  We are seeking to do everything  We are not now seeking to do everything on our own  That time is gone  The future is about consensus  about welcoming good ideas no matter where they come from  The future is also about fair dealing  no inside tracks  no privileged circles  the same rules should apply to everybody  and the rewards should go to energy  hard work and professionalism  applause  in  I intend  I intend to demand and apply only the highest standards  Government will be for the benefit of all  It will be progressive  enlightened and socially caring  Providing a fair deal for everybody  It will be characterised by a spirit of reform  Hence the slogan for this A/rd Fheis  A New Beginning  A new beginning in every aspect of our approach within the party  within the Government  within the cabinet  But it cannot be just for this A/rd Fheis  It cannot be just a slogan  Ireland is looking for more from the or  more of that from us  A new Ireland is growing up on all sides  an Ireland that is rightly impatient with slow with slow progress  with complacent ways  with fixed attitudes  This Ireland has new aspirations  new potential  Uh if we are to match those aspirations  then we need a new sense of purpose  a new confidence  a new energy  a brand new beginning  applause  This party  this party is a marvellous national talent bank  No other party has the variety of views  the wealth of experience  the practical understanding that Fianna Fa/il has  No other party  And our talent has been added to lately  And here I must welcome back old friends  who had temporarily left us and who have reappeared at meetings all around this country  applause  But if but if we are a huge talent bank  then we have got to manage that talent properly  That means new structures to make our work more relevant and effective new structures to make Fianna Fa/il the powerhouse of progress at local and national level  Our finances have to be put right  We have the plan to do it  Getting the money in is going to call for a concerted effort on all our parts  Making better use of the money  is going to be a high priority  We are in the business of politics  so we 're going to have to be businesslike  in the way we manage our money  Tighter controls  no lavish spending on advertising that we simply cannot afford  applause  Streamlining the organisation is another priority  Over the next few months the report of the party commission  will be carefully considered by all units of our organisation  We know we need to change  Now we have some suggestions as to what those changes may be  That report  has some new aims for the party  as well as reaffirming and amplifying many of our basic aims  Let me tell you  that I have one simple aim  and I want this party to share it with me  An aim that allows us to give this country  the coherent sustained principled government it needs and deserves  That aim is very clear  Very clear even though very difficult  And it will demand unselfish commitment from each and every one of us  You know what uh that uh aim is  I know what that aim is  That aim is single-party government  applause  I have no difficulty in working with our partners in Government  No difficulty whatsoever  But I will not allow anybody to think  that Fianna Fa/il needs another party to keep it on the right track  applause  I will not allow anybody to think  that Fianna Fa/il needs another party as its conscience  applause  And I will not allow anybody to think  that Fianna Fa/il needs to get its direction  from another party  from any other party  applause  Fianna Fa/il is the biggest most broadly-based party in this State  with a proud history  and with a track record second to none  And Fianna Fa/il must always aim  at providing stable single-party government for this nation  Single-party government must be our alternative  to any incoherent  multi-party  Rainbow Coalition  applause  In the  in the immediate future  we have a number of serious problems  Problems that will not go away  Let me now turn to one of the most important  unemployment  The greatest challenge we face in the nineties  the one that will show if we succeed as a society  is to create more jobs here at home  Jobs for those of our young people who want to work in Ireland  This is an even stiffer task than the one we faced in nineteen eighty-seven of putting the public finances back on the rails and making our economy fundamentally sound  We must start by recognising the size of the problem  Two hundred and eighty thousand of our people are without work  Almost as many over the last ten years  have had no choice but to leave this country in search of work  As a result  families were broken up  and tight-knit communities suffered  Growth in employment in recent good years  just has not been good enough to keep up  with the growth in the labour force  And in the bad years  unemployment has rapidly escalated  Economic growth is not translating into greater employment  It should  but it isn't  but it is not  And indeed with the expert advice that we 're trying to find out and we will find out why is that  So we have got to look at employment afresh  without any of the old assumptions or hopes  Creating employment is a national challenge  not just a challenge for a government  So I have decided to include  not just the social partners  but the political parties as well  through the creation of an all-party committee on employment  That committee is going to call in  outside expertise  listen to representative views and work with the social partners in NESC  In effect the Oireachtas itself  is going to be our employment forum  and final details will be announced in the Da/il next week  applause  but there is going to be a lot more than talk  Action will happen as recommended by the Industrial Review body  and that action will be spearheaded  by a special taskforce  the  let there be no doubt on one thing  an absolute pre-condition of progress is that we maintain our economic fundamentals in good shape  Low inflation  low borrowing  a stable exchange rate  a healthy balance of payments and positive growth  Those are the things we need as a framework of stability  for forward and strategic planning  Fianna Fa/il has shown  it can be done  Look at our record since nineteen eighty-seven  For the past five years we have been able to sustain a growth rate  averaging almost five percent  And we have maintained positive growth in the face of prolonged recession  in Britain and the United States  We will meet any budgetary difficulty that comes along  We will stay on course to achieve a hundred percent debt GNP ratio by nineteen ninety-three  Over time the proportion of national resources  devoted to servicing the debt will come down further  That will let us benefit from reduced interest rate payments  But above all this planned tightly controlled progress  will sustain confidence  because it will show that we are relentlessly resolved to have at all times  a strong and professionally managed economy  We must eliminate the many disincentives to work in both the tax and the social welfare systems  A clear transparent tax system is more equitable than one full of hidden loopholes  The tax reform I began in nineteen eighty-nine is going to continue  with the emphasis shifting in the medium term  to a broadening of the bands  While lower personal taxation is important for competitiveness  Irish people  want a decent quality of public services  We will not implement tax cuts at the expense of essential needs  such as health education housing or provision for the old and the unemployed  applause  As someone who built up and conducted my own business  I am convinced that there is scope for greatly improving efficiency across the public sector  In some cases the best methods are not used  In other cases the public does not get the best value because of the anxiety to achieve this particular objective  and because of insufficient commercial experience  Public servants are not always deployed to best effect  leading to a waste of energy  talent and experience  The Irish people deserve a better deal  Sharpening up the management and delivery of state services is high on my priority list  By continuing to improve our competitiveness  and reducing costs  we improve our attractiveness as a location for investment  We also enable our indigenous industries to improve their performance  We need better linkages with industry to develop sub-supply  for example to the motor industry  and to build up small clusters of firms  exploiting a niche in the international market  We will also enable our indigenous industries such as fishing and forestry to improve their performance  Fianna Fa/il have been particularly successful in promoting tourism  but there is still  great potential for further expansion  The tourism taskforce is the latest initiative  in an unremitting search for new ways of increasing its value and employment potential  We need to remove the obstacles  which prevent or discourage tourists from coming in here in larger numbers  or for longer periods  Like tourism  remote data processing is another example  It is a labour-intensive sector which should be fully exploited  to promote new job opportunities in both urban and rural  areas  Job training and work experience have also a role to play in easing unemployment  as have the new area base schemes  Only last week  we gained EEC approval for new employment and training schemes for up to twenty-five thousand people this year  As I have said unemployment is the problem  It is the problem that is causing potential to be lost and dreams to dissipate  Young lives are being hedged in by hopelessness  Older people are finding themselves unemployed for longer and longer sadder and sadder periods  That is not good enough  Now I am not saying that there is a ready solution a simple solution  But what I am saying  is that we must seek out and act upon every potential opportunity for job creation in both the public and the private sector  We will be seeking out major development projects and proceeding with them  What I am saying  is that we must rely more on ourselves and not on outside forces to solve our problems  And what I am promising this party  applause  and what I am promising this party is that all our policies from now on will be formulated with a focus on employment  Employment  yes that has to be the number one priority for this government and for this party  applause  I want to  to turn now to farming which for Ireland is both an industry and a way of life  Agriculture remains our primary natural resource  It plays a crucial part in the national economy  It produces the vast majority of Ireland 's two billion pound annual trade surplus  CAP reform and GATT talks need to be brought quickly to a satisfactory conclusion  We desperately need a stable framework for the future  So we will be fighting for a balanced outcome that will enable commercial farming to continue while encouraging the small farmer to stay on the land  We 'll be seeking to push forward the policy of rural development under the leader programme  so as to improve the viability of life in our countryside  Given the increasing importance of EEC income supports  we 'll be fighting to get for this country the maximum eligible amount  We 'll be fighting to have it paid to farmers within a reasonable period  And we 'll be fighting against the type of bureaucracy that treats a minor unintended error in an application as if it were a major fraud  applause  Aggressive marketing  has to play a major part in our food industry for the future  Excessive reliance on intervention provides no long-term security  We have got to get out there and sell  Open up or re-open the Middle East markets  That 's why the new Minister for Foreign Affairs was in Iran this week  And as you all know he did not come home empty-handed  applause  But overall  overall the state of our vital beef industry remains a cause for concern  We need regular outlets for our beef as well as our sheep  This country must become a value-added economy  We must redouble our efforts to create a modern processing industry
