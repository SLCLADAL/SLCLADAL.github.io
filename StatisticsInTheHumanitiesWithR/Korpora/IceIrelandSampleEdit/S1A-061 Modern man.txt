<S1A-061 Modern man>  Particularly like uh New West uhm by Este/e Lauder  and uhm  a lot   That 's only a  new one isn't it  Well it it came to Ireland in the last year or so    yes and uh  a lot of girls in fact Leah uhm likes it uhm because she asked me one morning as I was going out to work and I had  cough  positively  bathed my body in it  laughter  Uhm because now because nowadays as you as you  as you know Eleanor uhm  gentlemen in addition to  t  laughter   That 's what I thought   In addition to what Terry  laughter   In addition to using aftershaves they use matching deodorants and also uhm colognes you know which can be used on the arms and on the chest which  Yes Terry  Ter  Terry what part of the country are you from  Well Eleanor I I was originally from  c  I was born actually in Limerick but I 'm from County Clare  Tell us a little bit about County Clare  laughter   Well I I hate the   laughter  I hate the sight of the well  the the scenery is nice  but I found that when I came to Dublin that I I became immediately acclimatised   uh   At  what age did you come to Dublin at  When I was when I was eighteen Eleanor  Was it much of a transgression moving from Sligo to  laughter  It wasn't Sligo  Eleanor it  it wasn't Sligo  It was Clare  And transgression is not the your your your your grammar Eleanor is a little bit faulty there now  laughter   What was I saying  Transition  And and  and and  transition  Well it wasn't because I had been to boarding school uhm for five years so I didn't find  it difficult  to leave home  I I it wasn't that  I I wasn't homesick  Uhm and at that time I enjoyed  very much going down to to the clear air  and  Transition   Where were you at boarding school Terry  Well I boarded in in Limerick which was quite near  It was uhm  uh Saint Munchin 's College which was founded in seventeen  something and uhm  it 's still there  And what what was it did you enjoy it  Did you play games or  Well actually Leah I didn't  clears throat  I didn't play any games but I did act in the school play  in my final year against the the wishes and advice of my beloved parents  Why was that  Because I had a passion for theatre  Leah darling  You 're now in college Terry  What are you studying in college  Well Eleanor I 'm pursuing a modular degree  and I 'm in in my second year  And does that mean you are working at the same time  Well yes it does  I I am of course a civil servant and uhm I 'm I have to confess that that that while of course the the Irish Civil Service is in some ways excellent I find that because I have a creative temperament I find  I find uhm the atmosphere stifling  Stifling  What do you mean by  stifling  That you 're not doing enough work or  Well I find I find uhm that  I I find that  I find that the work  I find the people I work with and the mentality  of the people is very narrow and sort of provincial  Uh there isn't any uhm  uh any uhm  sort of  there 's no  breadth or depth of understanding  And you work is it Monday to Friday  Well Leah I work Monday to Friday  And there are some days I don't quite make it to   laughter  to Friday  but I do my best  w  work Monday to Friday  I now have flexitime but I would 've preferred the old system uhm  To me I  I 'm not a punctual person  neither am I tidy and uhm  found I had it took me  quite a long time to get used to to to uh uh  being in at nine o'clock  And then just when I had got used to that then we changed over to to flexitime  laughter   Eleanor what are you studying  I 'm studying Medicine Leah  And what at the moment you said you are in the hospitals or are you  I 'm in the Mater at the moment  part-time  but we 'll move out full-time in April  Mm hmm   And what type of patients are you seeing at the moment  Are you in rotation or  Post-mortems Leah  laughter   So you 're seeing the dead bodies  yes  And do you like that  Well it 's what I always wanted to do so I suppose  I 'm doing what I wanted to do  Mm hmm and what do you think of that Terry  Would you like to  Well it it immediately it immediately reminds me of necrophilia  But of course Eleanor  uhm I I yes I think I I must admire Eleanor because uhm uhm  she has  laughter  sh  she has immense  skill and talent  And she uhm  she I think the field of medicine is particularly difficult  Uhm uhm I  I wouldn't I I I  I haven't any aptitude for medicine  but if I had the aptitude I I think I would have liked to have done uh to have have worked in some branch of  medicine  But I I I think that of course Eleanor then  clears throat  as well as well  as as as being as being as being a good clinician she also uhm is quite uhm  knowledgeable in knowledgeable in literary matters  cos she has corrected me corrected me numerous times  And and I as a student of English was highly  mortified  laughter   Mm hmm   Well Eleanor what do you think of that  I 'm flattered Leah  laughter   So does Michael tell you such nice things no  laughter   And uhm  were you doing anything nice today  Were you studying or  were you in the library  Today I went oh I didn't tell Terry  what happened last night  coming out of the library  Uhm last night when I was coming out of the library at about  quarter  to ten at night  I was just coming out   you know the main entrance door  The next thing a car passed me with nobody in it  Somebody had left the hand-brake off the car  and it started to roll  And I went oh my God  I could see the car hitting the wall before it actually did  It went back and it hit do you know the entrance post  where you come in with the  big uhm  thing  Well it hit that  And I freaked out I came back here and I was as white as a ghost after it  I was that like  you know I might well just have been walking past and the car  would 've hit me   Oh yeah tell Terry   Yeah   And   you well you didn't think Eleanor that perhaps there might have been a spirit propelling the car  did you  Perhaps one of your post-mortemed patients  laughter   You don't have to be cruel Terry to be kind  laughter   Eleanor you have to be cruel to be it 's  you have to be cruel to be kind in the right measure  laughter   So do you 've any plans for this evening  And plans  for this evening   This evening Leah  you and I are going out  laughter   Oh yeah that 's right  Well Terry  Well Leah and  Leah and Eleanor are going drinking  We don't  we don't know exactly where  but they 're going out  g  girls on the town  and God knows where they will end up    th  I reckon we 'll end up  here   I know  where I 'm ending up tonight  laughter   Yeah  So uhm uhm  what can I say uhm  When uhm  do you go to college at nights Terry  What sort of times are you  at lectures  Well Leah I have lectures on Monday and Wednesday  uhm have two lectures on on Monday one at half past six  one at half past seven  two on Wednesday one at half past six one at half past seven and then at half past eight I have a tutorial  laughter  Eleanor and I  ha  sorry yeah  Have tutorials together  no well we don't we don't actually we don't we don't we don't  Th  the tutorials are very interesting  I have a very nice uh  a very nice  a very nice girl  I won't say her name because you know it isn't you know but she 's a very very nice girl  And uhm   I do  like girls despite the sound of my voice  laughter   Ter   Terry you were describing the modern man to me  Oh yes sorry  Eleanor asked me about the modern well the modern man  The modern man nowadays must have  must be jangling a bunch of keys  Keys of what  The keys  of a motor car  A BMW  Why do you think that he has to have a BMW and keys and money  a  a lady needs to  to be driven around  She she can't be  expect  she can't be expected  to sit on the back of a bicycle  laughter   I don't even get to sit on the back of a bicycle  Well I think that you know a lady needs to be taken out and looked after uhm  Despi  despite what the modern I know there is a  a modern trend towards equality of the sexes and while I am in favour of equality of the sexes I think that  I still believe in the old-fashioned uhm uhm  in the old-fashioned uhm  uhm  standards standards  Like uh think a man should be able to drive   his his girlfriend home   Jangles   laughter   So so you believe  that a man should open a door for a woman and  let her go first and pay for her and stand back and  Well I think  well well one thing I would would want to say about the BM  W and about the car there are some  women  present company excluded of course  but there are some women who judge a man  uh by his car  and I think that that is a  that is quite a mistake  Uhm I think that  uh yes  El  Eleanor do you think money is important  Yes Leah I think money is important to a certain extent yeah  do you mean to sort of live comfortably or to  sort of  show everybody that you have the money  No I mean that a man should be able to give a woman the type of lifestyle that she 's accustomed to  Hmm mm that 's fair enough  Yeah  Yeah I would agree with Eleanor  I think that uhm uhm uhm  where marriage is concerned it 's alright when one is very young and when one has boyfriends  but I think  Uhm is that what you call this Terry  Uh it 's okay when one is young one can  one can have fun certainly  But I think that  uhm like the person whom a girl marries  has to be  she has to be very sure  of of and what what Eleanor says uh you know  the the important like people say the that the money doesn't matter and you know there are plenty of things you can buy without money  But at the same time if you haven't got money  you know  as my father has often said  at the end of the day somebody has to pay  That 's true yeah  Somebody has to pay  And I think that people who don't have there are there is a certain type of parasitically or is it parasitic  male who tend to to latch onto women  You know I mean I mean  I I I present company excluded of course but  that there there are certain types of men who they 're you know they 're kind of sort of fancy men and they they kind of  they 're dressed to the nines  they wouldn't of course be wearing Este/e Lauder or  aftersh  uh uh Este/e Lauder because Este/e wouldn't allow it   wouldn't I I I wouldn't allow it   Especially if you couldn't buy it for them  laughter   But but uhm but but  they they tend to be uhm now I I I 'm not one of those really even though I like to have things done for me but I 'm not really uhm I 'm more of uhm eh what am I I 'm more of I 'm more of an independent  lu   Get up  and go type  Yes I 'm more of an independent get up and go type yes exactly exactly  Thank-you Eleanor  You saved me there now from an embarrassing mm decline
