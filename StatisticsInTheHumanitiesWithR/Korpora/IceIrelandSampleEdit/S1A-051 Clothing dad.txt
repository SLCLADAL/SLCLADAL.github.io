<S1A-051 Clothing dad>  What was it  Oh I I suppose you told them the good news Bronwyn  Which good news  We don't have  instrume  instrumentation week  Yes    I am so delighted   Mmm it 's  brilliant  isn't it   I didn't  even know we were supposed to  have one   Neither did  I  But then when I when I heard somebody say do we have any  instrument  I went oh no does that 'll mean another  week  Oh my God  Yeah   It was supposed to it was supposed to be  Do you remember last year we had to do an extra week after or something  Oh it was uhm it was the time of the anatomy exams  We were all complaining that no  term ended at nine weeks and Catherine said no  It 's ten weeks  Yeah  And that we should be doing ten weeks   yeah God   But   nobody else does  No other Faculty does  No but I mean generally in health science you do do more I mean look the dents were back a week earlier than us this  year  Everyone  does in health science   Yeah yeah   What are the physios doing this year  They 're out in hospitals  Are they  Yeah  Do they observe or do  do they do anything   This is their first  time doing it  I think they were observing before  But what about the OTs  Where are they  They 're out in Rochestown most of the time  Oh yeah they 're out far away aren't they  Anyway a lot of their their stuff they do it in Rehab and CRC and stuff  They don't generally  go  into the hospitals  Yeah   I don't really know what a an occupational therapist does  I know that they 're meant to get you into  They help people with feeding and all that  kind of stuff   Yeah rehabilitation   Yeah get you  back to everyday life  But like what they must have some other job  It 's kind of like a social worker helping them to get dressed helping them to feed  That kind of stuff  I know but there must be something more to it  I can't imagine  you 'd spend all those years training to   But ah you 'd need but you 'd need to know  yeah but you 'd need to know like you know say if a person who 's had a hand injury you 'd need to know  what 's  gone wrong and everything so you 'd know whether to teach them to knit or to sew or to  Yeah   Or what their capabilities are  Yeah  But where where do they work  In in a hospital or  Yeah they work in hospitals   Yeah they work in a hospital  or community health or or stuff like that  I don't think they work in in private practice at all though  It 'd be in the  community health service  No way    Yeah I 'd say you 'd need to be working on part of a team  Yeah yeah I suppose they work in places like Saint  John of God 's   It 's a very academic  uhm  academic course isn't it really  Very  Yeah   It is indeed  yeah  yeah   It 's a  very difficult course   Definitely  No eye-to-eye

to ah what do you call it he used to wear this wig cos he lost his hair through ringworm when he was really young  laughter  he used to uhm so he couldn't really cope with being bald at such a young age  and that so  he got a wig right  And he used to sellotape this wig to his head you know  laughter   double-sided  sticky tape  Uh   Sellotape   Oh my God God  laughter   But anyway one night

No  I can't remember it now completely  But anyway it was this girl she was babysitting  And she was about thirteen fourteen right  Is this supposed to be true like  I don't know  Alright  But let 's say it is  Anyway she was babysitting  And uhm  she was babysitting and uh it was on  speaking in abnormal voice  on Halloween night  laughter   Sorry about that   Possible   Aw transcribe  that one  laughter   Eeek  It was Halloween night right and uhm she was kind of in a rural kind of setting right  Mmm  And uhm she got this phonecall  And uhm it was this stranger and he said uhm I 'm coming to get you right  And she said ah don't be so stupid and she put down the phone  And she sat uh continued to watch TV and stuff like that  And then the phone rang again  And it was  I 'm coming to get you  I 'm coming closer now  I 'm closer   Na na na na na na na na na na na na na  na na na na na  Shut up  I 'm telling a story  laughter   I 'm closer   We 're creating  the scene  But she didn't you know  She just put down the phone and that was fine  And then uhm the electricity went  Get on with it will you  Shut up  I can't go on with it  Excuse me  Anyway the electricity went but she was okay because she had her little dog at her feet  So  she she 'd put down her hand occasionally to to  rub his hair so that he 'd be there right  So she knew he was there   Aw   Oh right   There was a man  biting her ankle all the  time  laughter   Shut up   Shut up  Okay  No so she was safe enough because every time she put down her hand he was there and she 'd have you know rub him and  everything  So the phone rang again and uhm uhm   Oh   You 've forgotten haven't you  No I 'm just thinking  this story doesn't make any sense   She 's giving Toni a dirty look   The man came in  and  killed the dog and   Sure how could he have  2 sylls  without electricity   Do you know the fucking story  I don't  I just thought of it there  He  3 sylls   Oh I heard
