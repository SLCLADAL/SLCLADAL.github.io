slammed after after that you know  And Cara was sitting across the bar talking to someone and Larry went mad  She was sitting across the bar  and she was talking   She was  leaning across the bar talking to some fella all night  And uh Larry was going like Larry just doesn't like her since  I don't know since she threw a wobbler about somebody who doesn't like her  And Tom  I was yeah   Really  That was about the overtime  Yeah about not working being able to work  and stuff  So Lar brought me down to the office and he was so  3 sylls  so  and he was like  you know something I hate

something else  Yeah   Guinness Properties   It 's Guinness  are arranging it anyway  It 's in Italy for a year  I think herself  and Smiley   Yeah   because that 's what John O'Connor did from

in about  July  Yeah  No June or July  Yeah  Beginning of the summer sometime  And he came over there uhm in September  Yeah  And he 's getting on well  He was home for a week  Really  Yeah and went back again  It 's uh yeah you have to have two to three years ' experience minimum and then  Uh-huh  You stay there for a year and then you come home  Very good  I think  the money is  well he 's he 's earning good money he cos they 're paying for cars and stuff as well  It 's not too bad   Oh yeah and they pay for your accommodation too  Yeah  Uhm uh uh uh  what 's her name Cara doesn't want anyone to know  She wanted me to ask Jay to ring her but  and I was like yeah okay  She says do you not want the ah  And I was like no no  But I haven't seen Jay so I haven't asked him  5 sylls  Did I tell you she attacked me on Friday night  No  I went into work  went into work on Friday night and I was standing at the bar myself and Larry and Larry walked off  She comes up to me and she goes  what 's this about you talking to Jay  I want to talk to you for a sec  What she mean about you talking to Jay  She goes  apparently you told Jay that everyone in Pearson 's thought we were back together  And I was like well everyone did think you were back together  She was like  well we 're not  You could 've asked me  And I said but I don't want to get involved  I just asked Jay when I was drunk once  That 's all  I was drunk  I asked him  he said no  that 's all  I said I 'm sick of you and Jay to be honest with you  I don't want to know anything  I don't want to get involved  I told Jay I don't want to get involved  I 'm sick of being in the middle and I 'm sick of the two of you  And she was like oh okay and then she  1 syll  changed well  I don't want there to be any aggro nn nn nn nn neh  Poor oul  Cara  Not in everyone 's good books  Yeah   Well she should stop jumping on top of people  jumping on top of who  Well she ate the face off me  Oh yeah  Well she was always a bit like that though anyway when I was there even  Yeah she was wasn't she  It was Eoin uh Cunningham 's twenty-first  Do you know Eoinie  His twenty-first on Sunday  That 's why  Ruth was out  anyway on Sunday night  His twenty-first on Sunday and they all went out  Benedict and  Sammy  Oh was it   Yeah yeah   Yeah  Benedict  Eoin some of his friends from Courtown  Yeah  Benedict  Eoin  Eithne some of the floor  girls  one of the floor girls  And who else  Muriel and  Rosie were  down there  And they went down to Howl at the Moon afterwards  Yeah   Right   I love Eoin  I think he 's great  Yeah he 's  deadly isn't he  So uh it was supposed to be a big big big thing but he went home on Friday and had it down in Courtown  Yeah yeah   Oh right yeah so  He didn't really yeah cos I thought uh  I 'm surprising John didn't hear about it  or he even didn't say anything  He probably  did   He 's out  of work  Who Eoin  Eoin yeah  He cut his hand with uh  Jesus there 's always something wrong with him  He cut his hand on glass or something  He came back from Spain or Canaries wherever he was and he couldn't walk  He knocked his knees together or something  laughter  And then he used to keep going out playing football and he kept doing it again  So there 's always something wrong with him  Oh yeah that 's right  There was the league   league thing   Yeah yeah  yeah  Poor old boy  Mm  I don't think Jamie was at it  You know Jamie  Jamie he went to the Canaries with  Yeah  Yeah or Greece with or wherever   3 sylls   Apparently Eoin  had to keep an eye on Jamie  Yeah yeah funnily enough  They crashed everything  Crashing motor bikes and  They did not did they  Yeah  I was I haven't been talking to him since he came back  They they were  in lots of he wouldn't tell me but he was uh  intimating implying there was loads of sex  laughter   Who Eoinie  Yeah I was like  any scandal and yeah  going off to have a good time  He 's very funny  He 's he 's very funny you know  I haven't seen him in ages  Yeah  Although I saw him walking down D'Olier Street last week with a sling on his hand  Ruth  told me what happened to him but I don't think I was listening  Oh really   Oh right  What she say happened  She said something to do with broken glass  That it came down and sliced his hand  down on his thumb   Jeez  that 's terrible  Yeah so he 's out of work  Did I tell you  Bill offered me a job  You were saying that yeah  I won't take it I don't think  And those  the waitressing things are  the waitressing jobs are in are what do you call it advertised  in college   Yeah you were  saying that  And are they I 'd oh I just wouldn't be interested Sally to be honest with you  I have my I have my day job and  my night job does me just fine  It 's only part-time  You know what I mean  But it  wouldn't be bad though  The money 'd be very good coming up to Christmas  In the bar   the restaurant   The waitressing oh  the waitressing 'd be good I wouldn't  I if I want to if I want to  work I mean  I 'll work behind the bar but uhm I don't know  It 'll be it I 'd be too busy  I mean if I  if I worked there right I 'd be on at five  six wouldn't be finished til three  I wouldn't be into I wouldn't like  4 sylls    Yeah  I 'm behind the bar and then we 're cleaning up and then you know  getting home from there  It wouldn't be worth it  And then I 'd spend all my money drinking  I know I would  laughter   And then working if you worked in the restaurant you 'd have to work with Rachel and  Samantha   And   yeah I know  Sophie 's leaving  I think Sophie 's left  Yeah John was saying he hadn't seen her in a while  She was just getting fed up  and they were treating her badly you know for someone who 's been  there so long   But that 's  apparently what she did was uh well you know I can't work this day and I can't work that day and basically I can only work Wednesdays  Tuesdays and Wednesdays she used to work or something like that  She did say and  don't think what 's his name  What 's  his name   Mark  wasn't too impressed  Don't think so  So they she she was she was leaving anyway  but they 're kind of  she was  heading towards the sack I think sort of  That 's not fair  She 's been such a good worker   It 's not fair  She 's been there for  ages  Yeah she 's a very good worker  She 's a very good waitress  She 's much better than Rachel  Ah sure Jesus  Rachel 's a brainless twit  Rachel was giving out about Inez the other night about how stupid she was and  how stupid everyone   When did you meet  Rachel  No the other the last night the last time I met her  wherever it was  oh it it was the time we were in uhm Smith 's  with Muriel  Oh right  Yeah  I forgot that Rachel was there  Yeah bitching away of course  Yeah  Apparently Eugene 's finding the manager 's job hard   started as manager   Yeah he started yeah  And he 's not finding it easy at all  I rang up  Saturday  I rang in sick for John you know  I got Eugene  I went hello  Who 's that  And he goes uh  this is Eugene  And I went oh Eugene  It 's Frankie you know John 's girlfriend  And I was like uh look do you remember he was sick yesterday  Well he  you know he 's he 's worse today  He asked me to ring in for you for him  And he was like oh okay yeah okay I 'll just ask Bill  And then he came back and Bill had obviously said it was okay so he went  I was like you know he was back to himself Eugene again  You know  and full of joys  And tell him to get sick in his own time and this sort of stuff  He was really timid you know and he 's he he apparently he 's not taking it well at all  And Friday night he was  they were jammers  And uh Bill and Liam went upstairs to start sit sat down had their dinner and left Liam on his own down there  And he was like  Yeah   I don't believe you  Wh  what is Liam doing now  He 's Liam 's job  Yeah what does Liam do if  he 's   He 's  promotions manager  Thursday is their third anniversary or second anniversary or something  Yeah  And they 're uhm what the second or third  I 've no idea  Yeah and they 're all and Liam is getting in one of those you know  The  ones with the big wheels on them that go down the Mississippi  boats  Or  some uh he 's  hardly getting in a real one  You wouldn't know what he 's doing  Oh the  yeah   Yeah because  uh there 's a   And  they all have to dress up as a  Either Huckleberry Finn  or   Or  Black Mug Mamas or  something like that   Which I  think is terrible  Yeah 'tis  Ah uhm I was saying  Ruth you are not  to dress up like that  It 's very racist to do that   go  I says just wear the dress cos Mammie has a horrible gingham white  and gingham dress  The sleeves come off the shoulders  Big puff sleeves and tie around the back  So just wear that dress  She goes what am I going to do if my face isn't black  They won't know what I am  And I went well yeah it 's a bit of a problem  laughter  So she 's dressing us as uh  Huckleberry Finn I think  Gingham dress yeah   apparently wrote on it uh  you know you 'd to dress up as a black person you know  And he was saying then dress up as a modern black person  but you know wear the shiny tracksuits and the big gold chains and the  runners and stuff  So that 's what Eugene 's dressing up as  Oh God  Liam 'll go spastic  Liam 'll go mad
