<S1B-036 Midnight Court 1>  Brendan Purcell is a Catholic priest  who teaches philosophy at the University College Dublin  Professor Laurence Taylor is an anthropologist and a writer and he works at NUI Maynooth  Lorraine McColgan is a singer and a psychologist  Uhm Michael Commane  uh Lent is beginning  The Pope says that we should intensify our prayer and intensify fasting  Uh do you think he 's going to uh  get a welcome audience from young people here in Ireland who perhaps aren't interested in fasting and praying  Whatever  I certainly can't speak for the Church and I certainly can't speak for the young people of Ireland  laughter  Uhm  fasting never did anybody any harm  That 's the first thing I 'd say  does prayer do anybody  any harm  The other day in West Kerry  a lady around my a woman around my age came to me as the result of a marriage split-up  She said to me one good thing it had done for me  her marriage split-up  it had made her conscious of the psalms  And she went upstairs  and she brought down the Bible  and she start started reading I think it was from psalm a hundred and seventeen  And it did strike me here was a woman in the middle of extraordinary difficulty  and she was  turning to prayer  I think everybody 's prayer is their own  I don't think you can pass an edict and say  this is prayer  I think it 's a very  personal a very private  commodity if I could use that word  Regards fasting  I could do with a bit of it  Will you be fasting for Lent  Well I I 'm often accused of wearing my heart on my sleeve but I 'm making a public national statement here that I 've given up alcohol for lent  laughter   Oh right well we we 'll come back to you at at the end of Lent  and  3 syllables  see how  you 've done   that 's a hard one now Dan Dan where you come from Dan in Kerry    4 sylls     several syllables  yes  I was going to  to say that in West Kerry it 's a difficult thing to do  laughter   Lorraine uh I think you 're a Buddhist aren't you  Uh do you believe in this sort of thing giving up things for Lent and  self-denial and so forth  Okay uh I  suppose   Will  you be doing it  I I won't be following it and while I 've never in childhood I never been  I was brought up as a Catholic and I never followed in any particular then  It never really frightened me or I never felt  never felt any meaning behind it for myself personally  I  and I suppose that 'd be my answer  to the question   But in in your  faith is there a philosophy of self-denial  Are there parts of the year for example  when   There 's  there are yeah  There are reasons behind uh self-denial and there are ritually there would be more ritualistic  pieces that would require it  But I think that the main point is the understanding behind it and that and what that is  And it 's not just denial for the sake of denial where it 's actually a reflection of  the human state and degrees of attachment as  as   You  you almost have to be in  self-denial all the time  It 's an ascetic way of life isn't it  I think that 'd be a bit harsh uh  way to understand it and I think a bit narrow  But I think that is part of life  And I suppose that the underlying philosophy being that  that everybody is seeking happiness and but perhaps doesn't act in ways that promote or invite it  And it 's to lead to a deeper understanding of how to maybe  go up that path   Right  Justine you work in the uh hedonistic atmosphere of uh  Bleak House in Middle Abbey Street where they produce Independent Newspapers  laughter  Will you be giving up anything for Lent  I won't be giving up anything but I 'll be  taking up something  I think the whole idea of fasting for Lent is probably anachronistic and perhaps irrelevant at this stage because  it 's now a way of life to uhm abstain uh uhm you know  this whole idea of the body beautiful  Women particularly I think watch what they eat all the time  I think there are probably better things we can do for Lent  Lent I think uhm you know like Lorraine was saying it 's about concentrating the mind and you know reaching a greater understanding  I would  hope that at the end of it I would have I will uh  well I don't know if it 's if you would consider it good but I 'm going to do something in my life  to make these forty days different to the rest of the year  So what you 're going to do something good for Lent  Is that what   And it it will last for forty days but you 're not telling us  Except for Saint Patrick 's Day  You get an opt-out clause don't you  laughter   You you 're not telling us eh the  full   I I 'll  tell you yeah  I I 'm going to   I 'm going to try  I 'm going to try and pray  Are you   Yeah well that 's really interesting  That 's so the Pope isn't wasting his time when he 's asking you to pray  laughter   He 's wasting his time asking me to fast  not  asking me to pray  Yes but   Yeah but do you think people will listen to the Pope young people   Unfortunately  not not in enough numbers no  I think at at the stage we 're at in our civilisation I think young people aren't listening to authority figures and they 're especially not listening to the Pope  No   Siraj the uh the Catholic Church has reduced the scale of fasting in uh I think in Lent to two days just Ash Wednesday and Good Friday and it 's a rather limited type of fast  You 're a Muslim and you have much more uh serious uh policies in relation to fasting don't you in the  you have Ramadan  it 's far more extensive  Yeah  That 's right   Well it 's for thirty days and it 's a whole month  It is during the day time not night-time so night-time you can eat and drink as much as is possible  drink in terms of soft drinks  laughter   Sure  Uhm but uh no I mean there 's no leniency as such  If you are a Muslim it 's incumbent upon you  It 's one of the five pillars of Islam  uh fasting and prayer uh alms-giving as well as pilgrimage and uh giving up uh giving out a certain amount of your income in in terms of uh     Alms-givers   Siraj many Catholics uh traditional Catholics admire the Muslim faith because it 's taking things quite seriously still  They feel don't you go along with that  the Catholic Church  made a mistake in uh in a sense watering down all the obligations  2 sylls  places on the members of that faith  Oh absolutely   Well I suppose just quibbling would not be right thing to do that  I mean Catholic uh has its own rationale  Islam has its own rationale  I mean five hundred years after Christianity comes Islam  and when you look at the value that Islam uh in a practical sense be it trying to practise them then it 's sense  to   What  benefits does fasting bring to you  It oh not only the food or drink as people relate to it  It 's your conscience  It 's your tongue  It 's your eyes  It 's your ears  So you 're actually purifying  your pollution which you 've accumulated in eleven months  So the twelve months one of the months of the year you 're actually cleaning yourself   4 sylls    It 's like complete  detoxification of the  system   Complete  detox  detoxification   Mentally  and physically  and   Absolutely  and and re-honing your thoughts in your system  It 's a it 's a month of uh  uh so to speak uh of you know a spiritual reward  You read uh Koran  You uhm do a lot of good things  and you basically pause and reflect on towards yourself your family your community and entire globe  and   Brendan  Purcell uh that 's very impressive isn't it  I mean uh why did you guys get rid of the fasting from midnight which used to be there  possibly when  when you were a young fellow  I 'd say   It certainly was  several syllables  But I suppose what they were trying to do  I don't know if it worked uh they were trying to do to was to get back to the basics  several syllables  reliving your baptism  You know you were almost getting reborn again the chance to become a child again and so you went through a kind of ascetic  several sylls  so you could die on Good Friday and rise again with Christ on on on on Easter Sunday  But I I mean you 're asking the others what they would do but  I mean I remember some guy saying to me years ago like you know you know if you 're trying to love your neighbour you know you don't need a hairshirt  And I mean I would strike me as my to take your point about   2 sylls    Yeah but  that 's not that 's not that 's not the question I asked you  I was saying to you did you make a mistake in getting I mean this goes right back to Moses  Moses went up the mountain for forty days and forty nights  Didn't he  Yeah well  6 sylls  I mean that was probably one of the reasons particularly forty days  It wasn't so much that if you like they were trying to get rid of it  They were trying to get people to remember what it was and to choose a bit more  In other words we weren't told we couldn't fast right through Lent  We weren't told we couldn't  2 sylls  People but they really were quite conscious that people were doing a lot of things maybe simply out of tradition  They had to do it  I mean I can remember days when people moved from the Diocese of Cloyne to the Diocese of Cork cos you could have four biscuits more at night-time  Ah come on now  They did it  Yeah  My parents told me that sort of stuff  No I mean people moved around  They did  It 's sort of an  a forerunner of the new licensing laws where  people were  driving over the county line for a drink  Yeah   Absolutely   Absolutely  but I still want to tell you what I 'm going to do during Lent myself and  4 syllables   just similar to Justine  I am I am not a great driver as my insurance company and various people know  And some of the people  2 sylls  already have made a song up for me  uh called the title was Do You Love Everybody When You 're Driving  And so I 'm really going to try and put that into action next well like from Wednesday on is when I 'm driving if people cut out on me cos  4 sylls  I 'm right and they 're wrong  So I really want to make an effort to improve my the way I think of my   2 sylls    Oh yeah  What are you going to do   So the  roads 're going to be safer  I guess so well certainly around me  Professor Laurence Taylor uh you grew up in a a secular Jewish family in New York  Did you go go in for fasting or  is there any  No uh is the the short  answer to that   But there is  is there fasting within the Jewish faith  There is  Yom Kippur   Yom Kippur   Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement  Uhm uhm but uhm as I was saying to you jokingly I think sometimes we  think our whole time on on earth is a penance  laughter  Can seem that way   Only in New York  Uh no no no  laughter  Dublin  Dublin matches it any day of the week I 'd  say   Sure  and what do you think about it  Do you think the Irish young Irish people are into fasting and praying anything like that  Well I think you know well I would say young  uh Irish people uh from my perspective uhm teaching  uh I would say the majority not but a significant minority uh would be  And in answer to the question whether the Pope 's wasting his time talking about it I would say probably not  Uh the evidence is you 're all responding to even uh even a response negative response is a response  Everybody 's thinking about it    Will  you do anything for Lent  Uh   No uh not in particular   several words   I was amazed at the number the people you 'd see on Ash Wednesday  the soot on their  including the Taoiseach  Yeah yeah   Yeah  laughter   He he  appears in Da/il E/ireann  And Brendan mentioned going from Diocese to  Diocese there was a thing in Cork  You know the  the Conny Dodgers  Yeah  There was a biscuit some company in Cork made during Lent and you 're we 're only allowed a certain number  of biscuits  And somebody made  some company bought  they made a big  a really big biscuit  Lapwing bars    They weren't sweets   Yeah  So that fitted the rule  Yeah  You were mentioning that I I think I think fasting is just the I think has to be a personal thing  I don't think you can impose
