<S2B-045 Unionist politics>  Well thank-you very much Mr Chairman  I came to this process back in the dim distant past in June  with no baggage  solely the belief that for future generations to enjoy the citizenship which we 're all currently enjoying  it was time for unionism to engage  To my horror  members  fe  my fears over the process which I had hoped was a mere manifestation of what 's been described as my siege mentality were all but true  Both governments '  members  and just pause and let the full significance of that phrase sink in  both governments  embarked upon our process with a clear outcome in mind  To that end  and that 's the end of the framework documents  both the ground-rule documents and the scenario paper of the sixth of June were produced and laid before us at Stormont as fait accompli  Well those of us who were there know what followed all too well  Late nights  many many hours poring over document after document after document after document  Given the number of trees we kill producing paper  the Green Party must be turning in its electoral grave  but the net result of all that was a little booklet  this book here of forty-four paragraphs  They asked this in the recess  I was asked by an English journalist writing for the Independent paper  whether all the hours of bluster and brinkmanship and steadfast defence of our positions was worth it  And I said yes  of course it was worth it  for the sole reason that the principle that the sovereignty of the process needs to belong to those who are engaged in the process had been defended  And that is the result of the pre-summer bluster at Stormont  The people who are round the table in Castle Buildings have now the chance to determine the outcome of those talks  Not an Anglo-Irish set of procedures designed for an Anglo-Irish outcome  not an Anglo-Irish  straitjack  jacket to put an Anglo-Irish Agreement Mark Two in front of our people  but the chance  it may be a slim chance  but a chance for the delegates of the people of Northern Ireland to have some say for the first time in a generation and a half  of their future  Having come to the foundations of an equitable process  where do we go now  Should we move to substantive talks  And we have clearly pointed the way to that move in our document as issued at the weekend  Should we move to substantive uh talks  let everybody be clear of our objectives  If Ms McWilliams had deemed this chamber with her  her presence now at half past three I would be happy to tell her about our vision  Our vision as Ulster Unionists Mr Chairman  is of a Northern Ireland where all our people from whatever tradition  can live free from the threat of violence  We believe strongly Mr Chairman in a Northern Ireland where democracy not demagoguery rule  a Northern Ireland lifted from the shadow of the gun and at peace with itself  a Northern Ireland secure in a Union which we all cherish  playing a full part in all our nation 's institutions at whatever level  That is the challenge  That is why Ulster Unionists are engaged in the process  That 's why we are encouraged by what progress there has been  The process could have died in June  Allusion has already been made with the bluster over the chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell  The Ulster Unionist party as representatives of the greater number took their position as leaders of the Unionist community seriously  We kept  we kept the process alive  We are here today because of that  leadership stand  Our wish-list of the future cannot come true within the diktat of  of the Anglo-Irish Agreement  That has to go and be replaced with a broad  a broadly acceptable form of government  That 's why we 're here  That is why we 're there  We 're not there to give any credence to the notion that the Irish government has a direct role in our affairs  We are there to underscore some simple realities in the process of Northern Ireland 's body politic  Reality number one is that we deserve the democratic rights accorded to our fellow-citizenships anywhere else in the United Kingdom  Reality number two  and this has been touched on at great length  is that constitutional instability begats perpetual conflict  Irredentist Irish claims have to go  Our government must stand behind our union in the same way it does with the union with Scotland  And the final reality  reality number three  is that we are the sum of our whole  There are enough people of good will in this province to make our province work and work properly  Now that is why we are engaged in the process  and that 's why we are encouraged that we are still here  To bury our heads in the sand  to bluster  to stop at every semi-colon  to read sinister intent into every paragraph and every utterance from either government would be to betray our mandate and to betray the people who sent us here  That 's why we are there  Why are others at Stormont  What do we face  We face an irredentist Irish line  backed to the hilt by malignant mandarins from Iveagh House  We have an SDLP running scared from the Republican Party  and we have  we have I have to say  our own government  so wrapped up in the clothes of appeasement as to be detached from the people it 's meant to be representing and protecting  The scales fell from my eyes  I thought that as a member of the United Kingdom  as a British citizenship  as a British citizen  I could look to my government and say  civis Britannius sum  protect me  represent my my issue  my interests  Certainly not  Certainly not  What do the Irish Government do  What do they do  They support the SDLP to the hilt  And that is why there 's no SDLP representation here today  and that 's why at Stormont the SDLP are dragging their feet at every opportunity  They have no interest in Northern Ireland  they have no interest in any form of government other than government by deceit  the government which has been  practised in this province since nineteen eighty-five  The lack of trust between all the participants here at Stormont and in their province as a whole a major major stumbling block for any progress  The trust that does not exist between the governments and Unionism has been well documented  But what can we do  dis  well that 's in the government 's hands  But the lack of trust between Nationalism and Unionism can be addressed by one single simple move  There are empty seats here aplenty  Where are the SDLP  They 're engaged in a process at Stormont  But let 's members not forget that this talks process  this Peace Process is not a-la-carte  Forum talks  talks forum  those are the same faces of the same coin  If the SDLP don't deem it fit to come to this body to discuss bread-and-butter issues  with their fellow elected representatives  surely the day has to come when we have to ask the question  what is the point attempting to work out complex constitutional issues at Stormont with these people  I 'll leave that hanging  In the order  in order to bridge that gap  in order to bridge the credibility gap which Nationalism and militant Republicanism leaves us  I implore them to come here  Members on this side have made the point very ably today  that there 's no bar on Sinn Fe/in entering this chamber  no bar at all  And quite simply  I lay the gauntlet down  come here  come here now  no ceasefire required  Come here now and try and argue democratically your position  You cannot do it  I would say to  the SDLP  come here and argue your position democratically without the support of the Irish government and without the support of northern militant Republicanism  They won't do it  The sad truth is Mr Chairman  what progress there has been at Stormont has been despite the irredentist claim of the Irish government and despite the total disinterest of Nationalists in an internal Northern Ireland solution  Many many times I an I as a Unionist am berated to look at South Africa  I look at South Africa and what is the lesson  The lesson is without trust there can be no progress  How can there be trust when people won't come here and talk to us  It begs the question  are these people serious about this process or is John Hume and his cohorts more interested in  in pan-Nationalism than they are in a future for us all in Northern Ireland  I want an agreement that threatens no-one  I want to believe the rhetoric coming out of Londonderry  But I wonder  I really wonder if the  if what is on offer from Nationalism is acceptable  If I was to stop being a Unionist then uh the Agreement would threaten no-one  But that 's all that 's on offer  We are offered a neutered Assembly with dangerous dangerous Trojan Horse links with the Irish Republic  We are offered institutions with a sinister dynamism  We are offered a a world vision that plays up false North South links but ignores East West links  It 's only until the reality of the politics of Northern Ireland is grasped by those who are holding up progress can substantial negotiations achieve something  We 're not here  or we 're not at Stormont to block things  We are definitely here as the representatives of the greater number to advance our province and to advance the future of our province  I ask everybody who was elected to join us and do that  We 've shown leadership over the chairmanship of George Mitchell  we 've shown leadership over decommissioning  and we 'll show leadership  as this progress  as this process continues  I hope to God it does progress and if it doesn't  it won't be any fault of Ulster Unionism  Thank-you very much  Thank-you Mr Chairman  First of all let me say  as a believer in unionist unity  I don't intend to use any of my time during this  smeech  to snipe at other Unionists  I don't think that 's a productive use of our time  Mr Chairman  there are those  there are many people in this  in this uh this country who would say that these talks shouldn't be happening  uhm and in one sense I would  tend to agree with them  If this Government was running Northern Ireland as it should be run  there would be no need for any multi-party talks  But unfortunately we don't have such a government  We have a Government that signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement  that gave a foreign government a say in our internal affairs  The poison of that Agreement is still affecting this country day by day  We have a Government that has destroyed local democracy by quangos and putting their placemen in place  For any true Conservative who looks at the record of this government over the last seventeen years  they should regard uh the Conservative government 's role in Northern Ireland as a badge of shame  We need dialogue because the status quo is unacceptable  Now on that one small point I agree with Mo Mowlam  although I would think for very different reasons than she would  she came out with that statement  There is an opportunity in these talks to change things for the better  There is an opportunity to reach an understanding between Unionists and Nationalists  However  for that opportunity to be grasped  I think that we need three things to happen  First of all  we need a change of attitude on behalf of the British government  At times the British government has tended to behave like a  uh like a feudal landlord  The most obvious example of this being the high-handed nature of the government happened over the summer with Drumcree  and Northern Ireland paid a terrible price for that blunder  it is not just a question of Drumcree  This high-handed attitude by the British Government has been seen in these talks  At the start of these talks the British Government came in with a set of rules of procedure and the ground-rules document  which they 'd set forward to establish on these talks  Had these documents been accepted  the effect would have been to give a  to slant the talks in favour of the Nationalists and Republican agenda  And Unionists had to fight for a proper set of procedures line by line and it took a number of weeks  at times change was very slow  It was like drawing teeth  But eventually we were able to get an acceptable form of procedures  and this has been a sign I think of these talks  Every time Unionists have stood up and they have fought for an issue which they have felt to be important  we 've been sniped at by others in saying that this is just a waste of time  But we 've thought long and hard to ensure that these talks were held on a level playing-field  And I think at least as regards to procedures we 've succeeded on that  But there has to be a radical change of attitude from the British government  They 've got to realise that the process is uh owned by all the participants and not just themselves  Secondly there 's got to be a change of  uh  on the stance of the British and Irish governments on decommissioning  If their proposals that they produced at the beginning of this week were accepted  the effect would be to put decommissioning on the long finger so that actual decommissioning not only would never occur  but could never occur  That is an unacceptable position to Unionists
