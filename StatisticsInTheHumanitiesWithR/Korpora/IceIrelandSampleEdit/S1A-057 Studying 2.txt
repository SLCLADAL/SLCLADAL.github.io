<S1A-057 Studying 2>  Is it working  Yeah  sort of so  My name is Mike Murphy and  I 'm a student in UCC College and I 'm here staying in Castlewhite Apartments which are apartments on campus  And uhm I 'm talking to a friend of mine  Aisling  So I 'm just going to ask her a few questions as to what she 's doing down in Cork  although she 's leaving now however  so what 's your name  your full name  Uhm Aisling Ruane  you 're a student in Cork  What are you studying  I 'm studying Arts and I 'm I 'm in first year I did first year last year  uhm studying Philosophy German  Greek and Roman Civilization  and English  are you you 're back doing repeats  Yes I am  I am  I failed uh  I failed Greek and Roman Civilization  uhm because of assignments that I didn't hand up during the year  Not because of the exam really  that  2 sylls    Right   laughter   So  would  you say you 'll get it this time round  I 'd say so  It 's a fairly small course  Actually when I  when I actually did go and do the work  I found out that uh  I could have done it quite quickly in the first place  And what about your social life  Has it been affected from your study  my social life has been hugely  affected  because of my study  I can't go out any more  Anyway all my friends from college have gone back up the country  and they won't be back down til October  Yeah    Are any of those repeating though    No  They all got them  they did  Good  Yeah  it say if you weren't repeating the exams what would you would you do say at the weekends  it 's a Thursday night to go out in Cork usually isn't it  no no no  during college yeah Thursday night  is the  night because all the other  kids go home uhm  uhm at the weekends  But uhm  during the summer it 's more Saturday night  Everybody goes out on a Saturday night  and   Yeah   Yeah   where would you go  Would you  a pub or a  I 'd go to a pub  uh probably until as late as possible and if I really felt like it then I 'd go to a club  But I don't really like any of the clubs in Cork any more   It 's  it 's the type of music they 're playing or  Well   no it 's just it 's just the crowd the crowd  the crowd in all the clubs is just very uhm  oh it 's just all one trend  Like they 're all just  one type of person  There 's no variety and nobody really wants to talk and everybody 's just drinking and dancing  and posing and everything  It 's just no good  you don't really go out any more down in Cork  Uhm I do  I go to the pub until about twelve and I might go up to a party afterwards or  something but I 'm not really into clubs   Oh right yeah yeah  yeah  And  what kind of music do you like so  if  you don't like the music they play in the clubs  Uh   I never said I didn't like the music that  they play in the clubs  No I didn't  I never said I didn't like the music they play in clubs  Oh yes you did  laughter   Well  What kind of music do I like  Well seeing as you don't go to the clubs  what kind  of music  do you  listen to  Uhm   Uhm   I listen to uhm  lots of different kinds of music  I listen to uhm  The Jesus and Mary Chain and  uh Lou Reed and a bit of Leonard Cohen  and then on the other side I listen to Ambient House  uhm Aphex Twin  all that kind of stuff the new wave stuff  What about you Michael  What kind of music sort of music  do you listen to   Well  probably rave  I don't know  usually rave  I like The Doors  and Velvet Underground  as well   I wouldn't  I wouldn't classify The Doors and Velvet Underground as rave  they 're not rave  but I also like them  You know  what I mean   I  see   you 've very diversified music tastes  Yeah   Oh yeah I have  like yourself  you know like yourself  so   Yeah    And what are you doing in college  I 'm studying  main  I 'm trying to become a psychologist so  I 'm mainly interested in Psychology  I 'm also doing Archaeology  Philosophy and Computers  And I failed Computers so I 'm back down  repeating that  and I got fifty-five in Psychology  So I have to do that again cos I needed sixty percent  so I 've to do that again  And what are you going to keep on with Psychology  Wi  with it  Mm  I don't know yet  probably Archaeology  See how it goes  But you weren't that you weren't that interested in Archaeology  were you   Yeah but  in Philosophy don't you need fifty-five  percent  to bring it on  You see I only got forty-six  Yeah   Well it 's only to do honours  If you were to do it as a minor  I think you could do   You can  you  can  do it  Oh then I might hang onto it like  I don't know  I haven't thought about it  I 'm just  interested in the repeat exams at the moment  Yeah   Yeah   Mmm mm Mmm mm  Yeah  And we 're going shopping now in a few minutes  Have you made out your shopping list  I don't make out a shopping list  I just see  you know   Why not  That 's the exact same as Sally  What  That 's the exact same as Sally  She doesn't make one out either  Have you ever heard  her when she goes on about shopping  Really   No  She loves going shopping like  She goes   Yeah  but she nicks everything like  She 's a thief  laughter   She is not a thief  laughter   She is a thief  She goes into the shopping  centres  Have you ever  seen her going into Quinnsworth 's and going  attention shoppers  and all this at the top of her voice and she goes and she takes ages to buy things  She checks all the different prices on all the different products   4 sylls  cheese   Yeah but this is also a woman who threw herself out of a window like  laughter   I suppose so  So I mean  she 's obviously something wrong with her  Yeah  let me think  How what did you did you have a job this summer  Yeah I was working in a drug centre  a drug treatment centre  Yeah  well I 've been working there for the last four years  Oh what was that like   Mm  So I don't know  I 'm got used to it but  yeah it 's grand like  It 's just a matter of  just writing down names and handing them in to the nurse 's station or whatever  Mm    And uh  did you did you not find it depressing  In there  cos people like  they 're all inner city Dublin crowd  the majority of them are  and like  most of them are dead sound  Mm mm  you know it 's interesting enough  But you get a bit of hassle like  once  there someone had just gone at somebody before that  one of the women threw rocks through the window  smashed all the windows  uh like you know  You serious  seriously  And were you inside the building when it happened  Was I inside  yeah  And then there was another one who was in the porch  and she smashed in  She was cut off her course  and she smashed in the window and tried to climb through  and we had to try and kick her out  And she  the security guard ran out into the porch  and he grabbed her like  and she bit into his arm  and he threw her out into the street  and she started threatening us that she 'd inject us with AIDS and all this  my God  So yeah it 's  you know though it 's interesting like  But you  get a bit of hassle the odd  the odd  time  you know  Why what are you  are you working  Yeah   Yeah   I 'm working in a  in a pub in town  in the Blue Note bar in Oliver Plunkett Street  what is it  Are you behind the bar  or are you a lounge girl  Yeah yeah no I 'm behind behind I 'm  behind  the bar yeah  It 's a fairly small pub like  Oh are you   Yeah yeah  so I get to keep the bar by myself  But the only thing is that uhm  sometimes it can get really crowded in there and you 've got to clear the tables and serve at the bar and everything all at the same time like  And what 's the crowd are they old or  young or  middle  young to middle-aged and then some really old  you know  because it used to have it used to have a real  like it used to be a real  prestigious uh pub  It used to have all the legal crowd going in there from the South Mall and everything  and then it just turned into a sort of uh trendy  uh elitist intellectual thing and they all go in there  They think they 're really cool like  Uhm but some of the old guys still go in there who used be  in the legal trade   And  you 're trying to get another job though aren't you   no not any more   Well  you 've been offered one haven't you   yeah  I thought I didn't like working there but now I 've decided that I do  You 've got used to it  Yeah so  I don't know what I 'm going to do about the other job because I told the other man I 'd work for him as well  So  I don't know   And  are you going to hang on to that job for during the year like during college year  I 'd  say so   To get a bit  extra money  Yeah but the only thing is if I could get a day job it would be much better  I mean if I could maybe do afternoons in the Blue Note  But then you see that would clash with my schedule in college  but I don't want any late nights like  working  You know the late nights  I 'm going to spend on going out  Yeah but I mean you 're not going to be studying til after Christmas  You know what I mean  second year   No no  I am this year  No I am this  year like   Yeah you  won't though  You know what I mean  I mean if we had 've  if we had 've studied from Christmas onwards  last year  we would have got As in everything  You know you would 've  Mmm   Mmm I know  but like  but you wouldn't feel comfortable  you wouldn't even   Cos we left it til the last few weeks  Comfortable right say in November if you knew you weren't doing a thing
