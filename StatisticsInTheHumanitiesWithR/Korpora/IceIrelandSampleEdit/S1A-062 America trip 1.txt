then one friend came straight home  and then  one friend was going to Michigan  So she was travelling on her own up to Michigan and I was travelling on my own up to Cape Cod  So I mean I had to figure out the journey all myself  They were going to send me  I think over to New York up to Boston and back down to Cape Cod  Yeah  I said I 'm not doing this  I mean this is too expensive  I wanted to do it the cheapest and the quickest way   the cheapest  being the main thing  I just kind of I looked at the map planned my route made a few phonecalls  So I got the ferry  someone had told me about the ferry  So I got a ferry from Long Island over onto Connecticut  and a bus from Connecticut  through Connecticut through Rhode Island and onto Cape Cod  Three different buses  Yeah
