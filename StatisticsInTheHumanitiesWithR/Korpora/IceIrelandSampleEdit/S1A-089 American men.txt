very cheap to go there  When I was like when you 're in when you 're in San Francisco  it 's  only a flight away  And the flight is fairly cheap so it 's not too bad  Mm   Was it nice  It was lovely  We went to a smaller island now  Now we didn't go to the island Honolulu though   4 sylls  over   Was that was it like  what you see on TV  Well the Honolulu one with the island of Honolulu

oranges  whites  yellows  We 'd loads of the flowers in  you know we 'd a view of the flowers and the weather was lovely and warm and the sea was really warm  And it was  really beautiful and very very very bright green  Really   Was it green   Oh lovely  Moist and there was no  1 syll   And was it expensive  Don't know  I was lucky  laughter   Was it expensive  I think it was fairly expensive  You see because we were camping  but we had the ideal set-up now  you see  Alannah you know  Bernard use to go  out with  She was staying in a youth hostel  first when she came to San Francisco and she knew these crowd  Oh there was a crowd of  2 sylls  over there  So there were Americans and they were English  And one of the English guys  got a job over in this island in  Hawaii  And he knew of a really nice beach and he made sure that we got a we had a  no I think he had a tent  or did we have a tent  Anyway either way  he camped down beside us as well  hi  him and his girlfriend  And we camped beside them on this quiet beach  And then he knew people that were living above us  This guy  he was a an Italian  And he was an artist and he used to have dinner parties  So

laughter   Bummer man  Yeah but the thing is  at the time when we went there there 'd been a big hurricane there  A lot of houses had been destroyed a year before we got there  So there were very few people in the it wasn't in a mess or anything but there were very few people living there  Right  And uhm  there were very few women because there were mainly male construction workers  And  you really got a lot of  like well not bad attention now but if you went down to the village shop or  whatever  you know and you might be sitting outside drinking  There 's little benches  outside  And you might be talking to a man or something about the drinking whatever  oh ah oh I don't know why what a beautiful girl all this kind of stuff  It 's that  And you were sitting out here like  It 's

's  only polite kind of  all this politeness    4 sylls   Yeah  Just say just say you know the way  in Ireland it 's done without being said  Like you know if they like you they don't start describing everything they like about you but in America they all do don't they  You know  they I 'd say like anything at all they just pretend  Yeah   Yeah yeah  laughter   Did you have that
