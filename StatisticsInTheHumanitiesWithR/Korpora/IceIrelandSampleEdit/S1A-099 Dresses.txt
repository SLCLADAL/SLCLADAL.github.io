are cancelled  apart from one so   How many 's at your table now for the ball  how many 's at our table now for the Ball  About seven I think  Seven   Very good  Are you looking forward to it  And then if we can get Declan Neill and them to come on it 'd be grand   You should have come you stupid girl   Why are they not  are they not at your table anyway  What  Are they not at your table anyway  Oh you don't put it down as your table  Do you know what I mean   do you mean seven girls not including them or  You all   Huh  Do you mean seven girls not including them   Uhm no it 's not it 's uhm Charles as well and that  I think that 's including Fintan if we can get him to come but we probably won't be able to  And then it 's like you know we 're trying to get them on  You probably won't be able to get Fintan a ticket  Is that what you said  Yeah  Oh  I know  I don't know what to do like  I don't see how we 're going to get him one  like  It 's really bad  I feel bad saying to him oh we got all of ours but we didn't get yours  It 's like the way it happened like  Yeah   And no-one would be selling one around college or anything would they   Or could  Martin   They 're like  gold-dust  People wouldn't be selling them really  Could you text Martin and ask him to get one  Uhm I don't even have Martin 's number now  And apparently he 's turned off his phone because people keep ringing him   Or get like one of those guys to get him in on the night  You know what I mean  I don't think they could do that  beeping noise  need tickets   I 'd say like if you knew one of the guys who were collecting the tickets  give them the sixty quid  sure they 'd let him in  No like  you can't do that  Why  She 's suggesting in I  2 sylls  Martin one of them give them the sixty quid on the night  laughter  She 's suggesting I bribe Martin and them to let Fintan in on the night  I can't do that  laughter   I 'm telling you why  You could  I couldn't Jesus  laughter  And besides I don't want to ring Martin  That was the last resort   true   He 's still  my last resort   ah it 's a pity isn't it  Uhm I know  I really want him to come  Like I keep saying it like  I don't know  We 'll try and get him an afters ticket maybe   Is Michael Condon going to the afters  yeah  I think so  As far as I know anyway  And you 're still all going to the twenty-first are you  On the twenty-third  Yeah  Uh I think so yeah  Well we we don't know what to do because we 're invited to Sarah 's as well on the same night  And uhm  and we we 're just a bit torn between the two of them  don't not go now  I knew you wouldn't come  Why   tut-tut  I bet you now  you 're not going to come  are you  I don't know  That 's what I 'm saying  We 're torn  Why  Cos I just knew you wouldn't come  She said I knew you wouldn't come  Like we really want to go but I 'm just saying we 're just a bit torn between the other one  Well how about you say to Sarah you were invited to this one first  Well we could but then we were thinking she might think it was a bit bad  We 'd be friendlier with her  You know what I  mean   Does  she know that   Well yeah  Well she 'd know we weren't that friendly with just a random guy  Uhm  and where 's hers on  In Stradbrook  Oh in Stradbrook  laughter  Back to the old days  Yeah I think we 'll end up going to Declan 's though  Do you  yeah   Yeah  I do  Declan 's 'll  be such a laugh  I really think   Well we really want to go to Declan 's like  We 're really pissed off that hers is on  I 'd say we 'll end up in Declan 's  I mean like that was our immediate thing but we feel  a bit bad  so we 'll just have to see  What are you saying yeah  Are you going to come to the Ball  Yeah   laughter  I 'm not going to come to the Ball  You 've got no tickets left   You probably could get afters  No I can't  not if I 'm going to Declan 's as well  Ah not if you 're going to Declan 's as well
