<S1B-004 Sociolinguistics 2>  Pragmatics and conversation then  normally for this class I need a  a board  cos we do a bit of a brain-storming session for this one  uhm thinking about conversation  So uhm we 'll just talk about it first of all then without the board  try and do it without the board  What do you think a conversation consists of  What do you do when you 're having a conversation  Giving and receiving information   Is that just what it 's about  Communicating with each other  You 're communicating with each other  What if you  if I asked you to think about the structure of a conversation  the what  are there rules first of all to having a conversation  Or is it just random  Is it just haphazard  What do you think  Well there is rules because I you know  what I did there was I interrupted you know so you basically you don't interrupt people  that 's that 's  But you did interrupt  didn't you   I know  I did  But I didn't intend to   And I do it all the time  as I 'm doing it now laughter   is it okay to interrupt  You can  you can do it but if if you did do it all the time you 'd have no time to hear each other   Yeah  And it 's also very irritating isn't it as well if you 're on the receiving end of it all the time  Uhm so what do you think  Do you think there are rules to having a conversation  Caroline  you were  I do think there are rules but I don't think they 're actually uhm  they 're sort of like intuitive rules you know  so  we sort of know the rules  Right  Well are they intuitive then or have you learnt them  We 've learnt them but they 've become subconscious   Mm  Okay  Okay  So if we say there are rules  what are the rules to having a conversation  What do you do to begin a conversation  You form a sentence that applies to the person you 're talking to  Okay so very specifically  those are very nice definitions everybody but let 's just be really basic about this  What do you do when you meet somebody for the  You say hello  You say hello  Right uhm  right so you 're walking down University Road and you 've got a class at ten o'clock and you see somebody and it 's five to ten  what do you say  Hi I can't stop   Hi  can't stop  I 've got a class at the moment and my tutor 's really really cross  a really angry person  she 's been really horrible to us if we don't turn up on time  how else do you greet people  How are you doing  How are you doing  You don't have to speak  several sylls    Okay so non-verbally  That 's non-verbal communication isn't it  A head nod the greeting  are there gender differences there  I was just going to say  I don't think women do that as much mmm   Yes  I think again that 's something that boys learn to do  quite young  Uhm back to the adolescent boys again  you know  Carl what do you think  What 's that  listen to him  He 's not listening to me  laughter  Uhm  how do you greet people  What 's the craic  Patrick says you do this kind of a head nod thing  Do you do the head nod thing when you see someone  Yeah  Do you think that 's gender-specific  It depends where you 're seeing them as well because if they 're a wee bit of distance away you would just nod but if they were you know closer to you or right there  you 'd  probably say hi  Yeah   Yeah  Do you know what I mean  There 's no point in going like that  gestures  you know when the person 's right beside you  laughter   But sometimes even that head nod seems not even as much as a head nod  It can even be like a raising of the eyebrows just  you know  laughs  But in somehow it 's it 's a greeting of some sort isn't it  Uhm  what happens if that greeting is absent  several words   So can you just go straight on into the conversation as such then without having a greeting  It depends on your relationship with the person  who it is   It does  later in class   Yeah uhm  so you said about the weather  We 're obsessed with this idea of the weather as well and you kind of feel that you have to comment upon the weather with everybody you meet  Ah it 's cold today isn't it  Yes but it 's not as cold as yesterday   but it 's much colder than it was last week   But that 's something that we all have in common  That 's uh that 's like a a  commun  it 's something that  It 's safe isn't it  Yeah it 's very safe  There 's no real uh opinions as such that people can fall out about  And the the weather for me uh because I live in Belfast is the same as the weather for you because you 're in Belfast as well and it 's  it 's very safe  So what do you think that that strand is that that that goes through that that  You know you feel that you need to   you you don't go straight up and in there  you know that you  you kind of skirt around this initial greeting  th  what this is actually called is phatic communion  Uh  phatic P H A T I C communion not communication  Phatic communion  And phatic communion developed the the idea  3 sylls  from a guy called Malinowski and he talked about phatic communion uhm as being  it 's it 's a bit like a kind of a social nicety  you know  you can talk about your conversation being phatic as it  having no real substance as such  But it is very very pragmatic to be  to use phatic communion  Because when you start off and you you know you 're you 're chatting to somebody and you 're being friendly and you go uhm  hi there  Och hello how are you  Now  when you say to somebody  hi how are you  what do you expect  A response   Fine  How are you   How are you  What if somebody was  if you said to somebody uhm  hi there how are you  How are you  and they said  well actually I 've got a really bad knee at the moment and I was at the hospital last week and you see the x-rays and  and and I had the flu the week before and  So why would you say to them how are you if you weren't expecting a medical report  Just a figure of speech I suppose to ease you into the conversation  It 's phatic communion  That 's what it 's about  It 's the same as  oh hi isn't the weather lovely today  Och isn't it 's a lovely mild day today  And blah blah blah blah  It 's all part of this initial ritual to get the conversation going  And some people are actually more skilled at it than others as well  Right so if that 's that 's the beginning of it  what happens at the end of the conversation  What do you have to achieve at the end of it  Closure  You 've got to say  got to go  cheerio  See you soon  See you soon  What other ways do you say cheerio  Ta-ra   laughs  English man  laughter  Uhm  do you say that  No   what else  I I would say good bye and I 'd stop  or see you later so that they kind of have a you know  several sylls   Yeah  Who would  who would say that closure 's important for them  That they actually like to finalise that that conversation you know so that when you 're parting from somebody you do a final goodbye  cheerio  I 'll see you next week  You leave somebody on a good note so you can approach them again   Yeah  If you walk off in the middle of the conversation you 're going to look a bit weird  Plenty of people do that  Do you not know anybody who does that  People who just like  you 're chatting away and then  I mean there 's a colleague of mine at Jordanstown who does that  She 's absolutely atrocious at closure  She just in the middle of having a cup of coffee would just get up and walk off  And we always  everybody kind of goes you know  uhm  what did I do  you know  did I say  Did I offend her  You know  Just randomly walks off   It depends how many people there are in the conversation like  Because if there 's more than say  well  two people  then you can walk  off and   3 sylls  can start talking  Do you know  I mean if it was just two people you 'd look a bit weird   Yes   Yes   It 's the circumstances again as well and that 's what we were saying  you know  in the in that we always assume there might be six of you in that  so you just got to come back  and you just pick up where you left off   Yeah yeah yeah  That 's true  But if there 's only two of you it 's certainly not appropriate  Unless you 've had an argument  you would but that 's just if you 've had an argument  several sylls    Absolutely Sharon  Absolutely  Indeed  so which do you think is more important then dynamically within the conversation  the greeting or the parting  Or are they just equal   several sylls    I think they 're equal  But if you don't start a conversation nobody 's going to get anywhere   But I still think that a lot of people  you can just  go up to somebody   You could get away with  not starting it but you couldn't get away with you know not finishing  And I think that 's true  I think that 's true  I think what you 're saying is right Sharon  What you  were saying  you know if you don't start it well then you 're not going to get anywhere  but I do think that you can start off by just you know uh  you could walk in and say you know uh to someone  what date does that essay have to be in for  But if you walked off without saying cheerio maybe do your your friends might say  she 's not very friendly is she  You know  So we 've got greetings  we 've got phatic communion and we 've got partings at the other end  What else is going on in a conversation  The actual conversation  in the middle   Yeah  The meat and potatoes of it all  or the vegetables if you 're a vegetarian  what else  What do you do when you 're talking  You take turns  You take turns  Now how does that work  Because you mentioned about interruptions  Mhm  Earlier on  are you violating the speaker 's turn then if you 're you 're interrupting them  You are   several words    That 's a good interruption  but to talk over somebody else  you know sort of is a bad one   Well that 's an overlap  which I 've just done there now  laughs  You become so aware of this don't you  Yeah  If someone was struggling with something and you interrupted to help them  that 's  that could maybe be an interruption   Yeah   several words    Yeah  I mean we ask a lot of questions don't we  Sometimes it 's not just questions  Sometimes it 's just  a lot of it is statement of facts or ideas  expressing your ideas  Uhm sometimes we interrupt  sometimes there are overlaps  When you speak  we start things  we get it wrong  there are lots of pauses  lots of uhms  things like that  What else  Uh-huh uh-huh  Feedback  How do you know when it 's your turn to speak  several sylls  you kind of recognise a pause  and then  Okay so that 's one way  You recognise a pause  The speaker maybe has a breathing pause  or a pause at the end of some sort of clause  and then you know well  this is my turn now  I can jump in here  I can take my turn at this point  How else does it work  You drop the pitch at the end of a sentence  Or in a question perhaps you  raise it   Go up   Uh-huh  Or in a classroom you put your hand up  Okay yeah so very very specifically in that instance
