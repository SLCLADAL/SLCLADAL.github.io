<S1A-059 Glasses 1>  Nice hot chocolate  Pardon  I think I 'm going to make myself some really nice hot chocolate  That sounds very nice  With marshmallows on the top  Would you like a cup of tea  no thank-you  laughter  Okay coffee  nothing at the moment thank-you  Do you know where I first heard about putting the marshmallows on the top  Where  I was in this restaurant in town  and they had hot chocolate  they charged you an extra fifty pence  if you wanted marshmallows on the top  Better off to buy your own  You 'd have about  twenty portions  of marshmallows  Put them in your    We bought some there  We bought some there today and it was sixty-nine p for  A packet  A packet yeah  It 's no laugh  Well you 'd have about ten marshmallow portions  in that packet   Oh but it 's groovy  It 's lovely  Mm  Oh it 's lovely  Would you turn off the television Maura  I  can hear it in here  Mmm   That 's your problem  You don't like watching the box  I don't mind watching the box but not on a permanent basis  like your sister does  What do you mean you don't like watching the box  I love watching the box  I love watching soaps  coughs  what else do I like  I don't actually watch that much  But  what I do watch I really enjoy  I watch soaps and I watch things like what Beverley Hills Cop nine-o-two-one-o and that kind of thing but I mean  apart from that I know  I 'm certainly not glued to it  No   The ones I like are ones like Last of the Summer Wine  you know that one where  it 's a very posh lady  Keeping up Appearances  Don't like  that   And I like  You used to love Spitting Image  Don't like that anymore  Well last week  I think they were going to have Michael Jackson  and   Lisa Presley   Yes  What a combo  Wonder will it last  I wonder if they 're married at all  Oh yeah  Oh yeah I 'd say so  So we 're told at any rate  No they wouldn't get away with that kind of thing  They wouldn't be getting away with it I mean  they wouldn't be getting away with all the appearances and all the  you know all the uh kind of show and everything  They 're definitely married  I 'd say so  Maybe maybe  I wrote a letter to Simon today for Christmas  Did you  Because I don't think he 'll be over before  Would you consider writing  He 's been very good to you  I 've written a letter  Have you  Yeah last week  Right well I 'll get Pat to post mine tomorrow  He 's coming over for Christmas  No he won't be over before Christmas  so I 've written the letter to them  Oh right okay  Anyway how are your glasses  cough  working out  prob  problematic  Well  I find it difficult with the two different sights in the glasses  You feel  that you 're going to fall down when you look down which is the reading part  Yeah   What you have the bifocals  and you look up and it 's for ordinary outdoor walking or driving whatever  I find with my glasses now mine aren't bifocal like yours are  Aren't they bifocal  They are  Mine aren't bifocal but  I find like that  if you wear if they 're for reading and you wear them out  there 's  I don't know it 's sort of like uhm  they 're uncomfortable  Your sight is uncomfortable  Wearing spectacles is definitely  a problem  Why  I keep losing mine  I 've three pairs now  You 're the only one I know  who keeps losing their glasses  I don't know how you manage  laughter  I don't know how you manage to lose them so much  I 'll do like Anna Fitzgibbon and I 'll get myself one of those things  you hang around your neck and the glasses hang on  The only problem is I 'd need three of those  That 's a waste of time  Really is  You know I mean  what you have to do is just  if you had the one pair  probably wouldn't lose them  Well I 've all sorts of problems which are too deep  and too long-winded to go into now  like  watching television  If I lie on the couch I can't see  Oh yeah   What  If I 'm watching television and I lie on the couch with my varifocal glasses I can't see  I 'm  uncomfortable  Mm    And then if I go to look for my ordinary glasses for watching television I seemed to have misplaced them  well I don't lose mine at all  But then again now I only bring them into college  you can't really go too wrong  can you  Well talking about eyes and teeth  I think it 's about time you went for an appointment to the dentist   I haven't  I went last no actually  I don't think it is  I went last  around the time of summer  I went in  September and thankfully there was nothing wrong  Actually  I 'll tell you what  I haven't had a filling  since I 'd say two years now  It 's   I didn't know you went in September  I know there was a bill in for June which you were disputing  and I asked the dentist about it and they said you had definitely been  Did you see the hygienist  Yes  What did she say  She just cleaned my  teeth   She she  didn't say anything  She scraped your teeth  This week when I went to the dentist he said I 'd nothing to have done either  He said I was doing remarkably well considering it was two years since I 'd been with him  That 's crazy  Ah no no in all fairness now I only go about once every  eight months  About once every eight months  Ah sure that 's enough I think really  You haven't had any problem at all with your teeth  Eithne 's supposed to go  Eithne 's supposed to go down to uh Garret Fitzwilliam about hers  And she 's just putting it on the long finger  I mean he may have  the answer for her   I have about five fillings   She was supposed  to go down  Oh she 's  last night  Well she made no effort   Well it 's her business   It is her business to a point  The only thing is that she 's  It 's her business completely  Sh  well if they get really bad and she has to have a lot of work done on them your father 's paying for them cos she doesn't have enough PRSI contributions  By the way talking about PRSI contributions did you organise your tax rebate  No  Well well lucky for you you 're so wealthy you don't have to bother  There 's only a bit I have left to do  Not too much longer  Not too  much longer for what   Ah but it 'll be   It 'll be groovy to be getting all my money in for a change  cos I 've been paying so much tax  It 's not funny at all  Well basically it 's your own fault  Well it is my own fault  But I mean  it 's it 's you know it 's a stupid system that the tax office don't cop on that I 'm only earning twenty pounds a week  and they insist on charging forty-eight percent tax on it  Well that 's the way they work emergency tax  And that 's to make you  get your affairs in order   What exactly is  emergency tax anyway  Exactly what you you 're paying  But why do they call it emergency  You pay  laughter   Emergency tax  when you haven't got your tax free allowances in order  And it makes you go all the faster to  go and get it   So  emergency means quick to the tax Revenue Commissioner 's office and get your tax  free allowance   And full and full  amount  Full amount  Oh cos you end up paying forty-eight percent anyway  Well that 's what I 'm on at the moment  and I really do think it 's crazy  absolutely crazy  Are you working on Sunday night  no  I 've got Vivian to do it for me  which is just as well   Cos I can't keep working  that much  Quite sufficient  It 's absolutely perfect  Yeah one night a week is quite sufficient for you to work   It 's ridiculous if you would even consider working any more than that  Yeah it is you see  And I told  the manager that I couldn't work  more than the one night a week you know  he uh he said yeah fine  And of course  he 's a bit of head like a sieve  and it went in one ear and out the next  And the next week sure wasn't I on  wasn't I on the two nights  You know it 's crazy really I mean if you can't remember that kind of thing  I mean that 's what the manager 's there for  Maura you 're a little insignificant person in their eyes  There 's only twenty of us twenty-five of us in the bar  I 'm twenty I 'm one twenty-fifth of the whole bar  What about all the other people on the staff  Well they 're the other twenty-four  laughter  The team works together  The bar works together and  you know we  You 're talking rubbish  You 're so  insignificant  You do about  six hours work   I do my best   Six hours work per week  laughter  Some day  some day I might do more  I might do more during my summer after my block  Actually I don't know what I 'm going to do for this summer  cos I just can't decide what I 'm going to do  I mean it 's not even near the summer now but like  Earn heaps of money and pay for your fees for your final year  Make my millions  Ah well then you never know  You see that Listermint  Yeah   And Ponds Cream   Now when  you 're going upstairs would you bring them up with you please  because I 'm tired of rubbish being left around the kitchen  Yeah  2 sylls    Okay  Okay   Okay  laughter   That 's all I get is okay  Will you please take those silly curlers out of your hair  laughter  You do that and you 've a perm I don't understand  The perm makes me look like Shirley Temple  Yeah she 's young and cute but  What what else do you want  laughter  Well ah  Well I 've got to have my hair nice for tonight  Tonight 's the big night  Yep  Ah yeah it should be good fun  I 'll probably just sit in and  recover tonight  I beg your pardon  I 'll probably just sit in and recover from my  day work  my hard day 's work  It 's  a tough  old trot  Well if   If we win a Christmas arrangement tonight what will I do with it  Have Christmas early this year   Well if you were to  win uhm you know  if you were to win uhm  a prize like why don't you sell it  laughter   Make some make some money   Who 'd want a Christmas  arrangement  a fresh flower Christmas arrangement now  You never know  I hear of  the   There are an  awful lot of strange people out there  I hear that on the twenty-fourth of November they 're uh introducing Santa in County Meath  Imagine the twenty-fourth of November
