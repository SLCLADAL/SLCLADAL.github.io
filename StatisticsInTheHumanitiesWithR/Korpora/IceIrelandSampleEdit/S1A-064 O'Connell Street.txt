<S1A-064 O'Connell Street>  Whereabouts in O'Connell Street or else out in the airport  That 'd be a nice job  That 'd be a grand job  and they want someone with a knowledge of Dublin and its  at least as a tourist place and I was during the last few weeks I 've been belting round to all the tourist places in Dublin trying trying to get Kilmainham seen there 's Dublin Castle and  do you know places like here where there 's Trinity is  Oh right   several sylls    Do you know where Trinity is anyway   Ah I 've a fair idea yeah  laughter  Tom O'Neill Treacy was up in Dublin and he was ringing  you see cos when we were in college right Miriam was staying out with Jane and Marina and he was ringing and he wanted to know where they  were  and uhm Miriam says  where are you  and he says  I 'm near the Central Bank  right he knew where that was  and Miriam goes  right so  go down to the gates of Trinity and I 'll meet you there  And he says  Trinity where 's that   Yeah   Where 's Trinity   laughter  Tom just turn round about forty-five degrees and it 's looking at you  Swear to God  That was as far as Ben Mill could get as well  Trinity he could find Trinity but  5 sylls   He must be from Cork  You have to be living there to know  No driving-wise  Getting around it like  Long ago they used to say a bike  a bike was the right way  We were at a badminton match the other night  and there was this girl  She 's from Dublin right and we were talking about doing driving tests on the way home  She was saying something about  well you know at least at least it 's so cool like you know when you 're driving round Dublin  doing your driving test you know  you needn't ever go any faster than thirty-five miles an hour  You know when like when you 've got all these tractors and all I suppose on the road at home and I was there going  oh yeah there 's tractors on all the roads  laughter   It still is you know   Tractors  you know back-to-back tractors down the town of Clonmel like  Yeah so then myself and Sharon started rubbing it in and Sharon said  yeah I learnt to drive actually on a tractor  On a what  On a tractor  Can't you imagine Sarah  in her accent saying then I learnt to drive on a tractor  And she was going   The accent wouldn't go with the tractor  And then she went  5 syllables  break in tape   And the other one was there and her chin was kind of hitting the floor you know  and she was saying yeah in a field out the back you know there 's cows watching I had to kind of steer around them  More like the cows were like the bollards  But weren't you rubbing it in  Oh my Lord  And Sharon was saying  well the hardest thing I suppose was learning to drive you know in the middle of a field  laughter  Your woman couldn't believe it  But there 's a driving school in uhm Dublin who they  they have their own town marked out  Really  I 'm sure there is cos they 've got their own  Eimear learnt to drive in Dublin  But yeah but did she learn in in the kind of mock yard track  Oh no no  She learnt in Finglas  Yes they 've got you know and it 's they 've got traffic lights  pedestrian crossings and everything  Do you know the you could come  and all the different things at a roundabout  And you wouldn't you wouldn't be out on the street  Yes  Being a hazard to  to everyone  laughter   But they have people walking across and everything don't they  Yeah they do yeah  Sharon 's from Cork isn't she  Fine woman  But the guards have those as well  In Templemore  Which one  Yeah that 's right  Is it  I want to learn how to put  the old handbrake on  4 syllables     several words    Maybe we should go down there one day   They have a shooting thing and all simultaneous and unclear speech   Did you see Superintendent Jim Fitzgerald  By the way  have ye heard Christy Moore 's The Rose of Tralee song   but but but  but she was giving out about it  Speaking of guards    maybe he has too much uh   I 'm not surprised   There 's something about a flat in Rathmines  You should listen to the words  They 're something else  He goes  he met her like  he says he 's coming in off the boat  and he tells her  3 syllables   go to England  Oh yeah sure she was interviewed  You mean about Brenda Hyland   Yeah  She was interviewed one day on the radio  She 's been on  she   Was she  not happy about it  No well she  wasn't  4 syllables    But she 's  some she 's some fool like  She should just laugh at it  But I thought the funniest line ever  was   Well sure she was laughing   She was laughing at it yeah  Was she  Yeah  But the funniest line I think in the whole thing is when he goes uhm  she stops him anyway and he says  ah go away  Oh would you go away from bothering me from bothering me you know  It would be more in your line now to give me a spin into town in the squad like and this kind of thing  laughter  And then he goes  they were going off someplace anyway uhm but you and your oul pioneer pin and your  fa/inne  and your little white cross for not cursing  laughter   Is that on it too  Oh it 's wicked  and he goes uhm  But is it about the Rose of Tralee   well he means   Well he 's having a dig  at the Rose of Tralee and having a dig at the guards  He 's having a dig at The Rose of Tralee   Yeah  And Brenda Hyland happened to fit the slot  It just so happens that she fitted it you know  She was   Well I swear to God  she 's the most popular Rose of Tralee that ever came out of there  She is isn't she  But and then he says to her that  anyway in the end anyway they go and they find the early houses in Dublin cos he 's come in off the boat from England  and uhm she says  will we go for a pint and  no he says  we 'll go for a pint and she says  oh no I can't drink while I 'm on duty  I 'll have a brandy and a port  and he goes  by Jesus  he says  'twas like throwing water into a barrel of sawdust  Is this the words  the words of the song  The words of the song  It 's thirteen minutes long  hu  It 's some length of a song  I never really heard it  Yeah well it 's supposed it 's supposed to be comic  That was that was the spirit  anyhow when they discussed it one morning on the radio there  that was it   Yeah Ma/ire  said Eugene 's going through a Christy Moore phase at the moment and he sat her down to listen to this song for thirteen minutes  But the words are brilliant like  And he goes  in them in them days he says  you you 'd get a pound for doing a funeral at Newbridge and two pound for a wedding  and a kick in the arse if you hadn't enough wine in the chalice  laughter  This is like the words of it  And he breaks into verses of Ave Maria and everything in the middle of it  Did you hear it Shane  No  It 's a wonder Shane hasn't heard it  It 's a wonder you haven't heard it  Remember the night when we went to see him  Where was it we went to see him  Uhm  Killarney  The eagle something  Gleneagle  Yeah  Yeah cos I remember I fell asleep on the table  I was just flat out  Do you know who I saw on  what day was it  What day was Suzanne 's birthday  Wednesday  I think I saw Joe Connor on Wednesday
