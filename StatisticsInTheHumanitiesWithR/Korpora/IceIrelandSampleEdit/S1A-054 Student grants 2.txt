<S1A-054 Student grants 2>  She did and not only that but she also was sent uh a form about tax which I didn't get  to kind of put down what she 'd been earning and  what  tax she 'd been paying and that so she sent that one off  So I don't understand what the hold-up is at all  Yeah   The poor girl is fed up   Because they are they automatically are  they  just don't send you a bill  They just presume it 's so long coming through right  Right   The poor girl has enough to be worrying about at the moment  Actually yeah  She 's a bit fed up with it now kind of  We have this pathway worn into the Grants Office   You know the way at this stage they you don't even have to check anymore about her name  They just kind of look up and go no  You must feel the same though  I 'm sick of going in there and it 's not their fault  even though they can be so  rude inside   But it is originally  it is the records fault  I 'm sorry I 'd be very rude  I know but you can't be rude to the people in the office cos I have this awful feeling when it did come in they 'd hold it for about two weeks  Yeah but you know I like when you 're kind of lucky enough to get Carol  Yeah  In a good mood  In a good mood  Oh well I haven't   snapped the  head off me one day I went oh  God I 'm really sorry   Really   Yeah one of the girls lifted  me last year because I couldn't remember  I 'm Dublin County Council  and there 's  I don't know  They keep rhyming out if you say Dublin County Council  Then they say  I know one of the the words is Fingal and I haven't figured out what the other two are  so I can't actually tell them what part of Dublin County Council cos I haven't understood what they said  laughter  But  God I left it go the first time they said it to me so I was too embarrassed then  to say  I 'm terribly sorry but I don't know what you 're talking about  then I went back the next term and I said Dublin County Council thinking I 'd get away with that and she asked me what part of Dublin County Council  And I said I didn't know and she honest to God this girl she was  I 'd say maybe twenty-one or twenty-two well she lifted me out of it  To say yeah   Oh you 're not serious  absolute  I died on the spot  The hassle of looking through six pages was just so extreme for her  She 's not a real thin one  is she  oh she 's  Yes  with dark hair  Yeah  Yes  Oh she 's a bitch  Oh good  You 've  had the pleasure   Yeah  laughter  pleasure have you  Oh she 's such a cow  And she screams at you from the other end of the office  yeah  What do you want    4 sylls   It wasn't like that she was anyway discreet about  it  Everybody knew I was an eejit and I didn't know where I came from  laughter   Yeah   Yeah this one 's a mutt  She hasn't a clue where she 's from  And I 'm saying I oh God I don't want the money  It 's not worth it  telephone rings   I 'll get it  That 's probably for Stephanie  Probably but I 'll get it anyway  Is that the phone or the door  That 's Stephanie 's phone  It rings continuously non-stop for Stephanie  Ah yeah  Yes no  What have you got then  Have you bells then you or do you   You 've got bells  Bells outside the door but Stephanie always sticks her head down  Ah right   Stephanie again yeah  Stephanie again  She just opens the door and she automatically presumes it 's for her  Popular lady is she  Yeah  I nearly rammed my fist through the lads ' door today  laughter   And they don't deserve it cos they never  get phonecalls   I didn't realise  it was so loud  They were there and I was too lazy to go out and ring the bell so I just hammered on the door but it came out so loud they came flying up the stairs and I went  phone  laughter   But I felt so stupid going phone  Who actually  who got it installed in the end  The landlord  The landlord out of the good of his heart  Yeah oh my goodness  Yeah and we 'd been really hassled about it like and we just didn't get round to going in  So the lads said one Monday that they were going out about it if we weren't going to go about it so it was in the  following Wednesday  So we thanked the lads and they didn't know anything about it cos they asked me where it came from  laughter   Thanks very much   I was inside then one night  I was on the phone thanks very much for getting the phone  How long have we that  laughter   They hadn't a clue  They didn't know it was there at all  And it rang  It rang one morning and we all just ran around and went went the phone 's ringing and nobody answered it  laughter   It was half eight on a Thursday morning  Yeah  We were in our pyjamas  And we kept screaming Martina  Martine get out of bed  The phone was ringing  And nobody answered it  It just rang on and on  laughter   It was from Telecom though  Yeah  This is the Telecom man speaking  laughter   He said I 'm from Telecom E/ireann  he didn't say anything at first  There was all these noises in the background  She hands me the phone and I 'm here  We thought it was the lads downstairs just doing a mickey  They 'd done something with the wires  Hmm  So they 're  that kind of a gag so  so we 're getting very suspect  Next minute she hands it to me and I 'm going  and this fella goes hello hello and he 's talking to me  laughter   It 's amazing  They do that on phones  I got such a fright  I didn't think he was going to talk at all  2 sylls   Where are they going to college those guys  UCD and  those up above  Are everywhere  There are two girls  They 're  UCD   Are they both  UCD  And then we 've got  Patrick  Patrick Joe Culletton  laughter  His name is Patrick Culletton right  Yeah  But we came and  oh uh the landlord told Dymphna he was Patrick then and the lads told us he was Joe  Because he got drunk one night  And he told them he was Joe but we just can't believe it and we thought that he was drunk  And then she saw his name and she said  he 's Culletton and I 's just going what kind of a weird name was that but it 's Culletton  Well we say Culletton  So we had this thing about it   I said Culletton as well but  there 's two Ts in it  It 's the same difference  I 've never heard of anybody called Culletton before  It sounds like culottes gone wrong like  laughter   You 'd want to be very drunk now to call him that  So we call him Patrick Joe Culletton all the time  Not to his face I take it  We don't call him anything to his face  But what   What 's he doing   Don't know  He 's old  I 've only seen the back of him I haven't seen the front of him yet  You haven't  He 's no great shakes  laughter   You know I met him last night I met him last night  We were that close  I opened the door and there he was looking in at me  laughter   Hello Patrick Joe Culletton  I just said hi  laughter   Hi oh very seductive here all together  Janie I can't believe I was thinking about it afterwards that you didn't like Forrest Gump  I  2 sylls    It 's just your  form  You should a go see it now when you 're in  more  romantic form maybe  Yeah I 'm not   Yeah no I was cos of who I went with okay  Just face it all  togeth  you should go with a group of girls   didn't  Didn't bother me  I still roared  I went to it twice and I cried twice  Yeah   Did people not say no okay it was the person I went first  He said really stupid things and it just made me so mad right  And then you know when something like that happens you just lose the  film   Mm  yeah I think  yeah you have to be kind of with somebody who I mean  I know it was  too far-fetched and silly  It was  Appreciate it   And he ran for three years two months and fifteen days and then he stopped  in the middle of the desert  laughter   He got tired  I 'm tired  I want to go home  laughter   Ah I liked the part  I liked the part where uhm  you know the different parts they had where he kind of met the president and he was  Elvis  Elvis I thought  laughter   The dancing right  He had braces on his legs and this was the way he 's dancing  and that 's how Elvis learned to do his  bandy twist  laughter   The twist  I thought it was very funny   Oh dear  yeah it was funny  and it was it was quite good  It was the more I came out and thought about it afterwards  Yeah  You know made me cranky and we were talking about it coming up the road and we got like a wee bit cranky  No I think it was just my humour  Hmm  It was probably quite a good film  Has she put you off going to see it   want to go and see it   I told you should go and see it  Yeah I said that  If it 's still on by the time I get round to  going   Has it  been to uhm  Rathmines  I think it  has   I thought you  saw it yeah  I remember you

good isn't it  Well  Oh you didn't like it  I didn't particularly enjoy the film but I think to be perfectly honest with you it was more the picture house  that was upsetting  You mean it 's kind of grotty  It 's the smell   The smell   Yeah it 's smelly  And I kept of course me Miss Paranoia here I 'm sitting there like this going God the floor is probably infested  laughter  I mean there
