Actually  I 'll have that too  That 'd be lovely  Okay  We 're all very conformist  aren't we  That 's what we had   That 's what we had in Red tonight Sally-Anne  Oh is it  You gits  laughter  Did you get my text message  Monica I 've got to get your phone  or your mobile number cos I did  I know  Cos they were all talking about  look did you get this from Sally-Anne about Smirnoff and everything  These are lovely  imagine  I don't have your number either  Poisoned   what are the chances   Poisoned  Isn't that really weird  But it 's  probably true actually   I mean  the proper word  poisoned   Did you uh  did somebody tell you that or did you know that  I was typing in Smirnoff earlier  cos I was asking Jennifer which was better  Absolut or Smirnoff  and  uhm Smirnoff came up  poisoned  cos I had the predictive text on  I love your wee bag  several sylls    I meant to ask you by the way Sally-Anne cos I haven't asked you  how did you how did you get on at the cinema  Cos you didn't  Brilliant  I take it you didn't go for a drink or anything afterwards  we disappeared like directly afterwards  cos Tom and Saoirse   Yeah we went to the Errigle   Kevin was there with Leah you see  Oh I don't believe you  Uh-huh  And how  then that 's obviously going well  Oh  2 sylls   Dixie-doo all the way  Who are Kevin and Leah  Do you know my friend Leah   Leah  your friend Leah   That Kevin I lived with in the house we had last year in Stranmillis  Oh right  I didn't know they were  when did they get together  He 's bringing her back Clinique   several sylls    Is this Leah  who Robin 's friendly with  Uh-huh  he uhm he went Fred for three weeks to America and uhm came back with a whole big thing for Leah  Like he 'd he 'd  uh I think they 'd had maybe one date  maximum two  They 'd met uh  they 'd had the first night  several sylls  simultaneous and unclear speech   Magennis 's seems to be a good place  I 'm going starting to go there  Cos I 'm missing out  If you go upstairs  Do not waste your time standing round downstairs cos it 's just full of old fogies but  och yeah it 's  it 's alright  I wouldn't be wild about it  But it 's not the case  it 's when you get to our stage and you 're single  you just have to go where the men are  It 's as simple as that right  There 's no  point going to nice bars  well they 're not in the nice bars that you sit in corners and have chats in  Where are the men   No  I mean you have to just go where the market  Well I mean where are you talking  Magennis 's and the Welly Park and that 's it  Or is there other  places   More  or less  Like we were in the Apartment  Rosie and I two Friday nights ago  And it basically then has the people who didn't get into La-Lea  Is that right  Uh-huh  Ah that 's  You know that 's what the bars now have kind of thing  I have no idea where my future husband is  He 'll be dropped out of the sky or something because he doesn't appear to be out and about  Well he may be where you least expect him  He may be  That 's what everybody says but uhm  like obviously where I least expect him cos he 's not fucking showing anywhere  Well the thing about where you would least expect him  In work  Yes well  several sylls   You really just hope and pray he 's not there  One of the door  new doormen or something  laughter   I used to think with you know PWC upstairs and everything you were bound to bump into loads and loads of men and people  Just that somebody would knock over your papers  and  lift them up for you  Yeah    3 sylls  Oh you 've got your wedding shoes on  Yes  Very nice  Och they 're grand you know  Actually I like them better now  Are they comfy  Aye they 're very comfortable Louise  you know  because I hadn't broken them in or anything  whatchamacallit  then the day of the wedding they were no hassle at all  So they 're grand  I like them with long trousers cos they  I don't like this bit  I don't like that style of shoe  you know with two and and then there back  you know backless if you like  But like if when you 're standing up  and you know  so it 's only that bit of the sandal  Do you know what I mean   Aye that 's good   Yeah I see what you mean   So I think that 's fine  That 's really nice  And if I  and that 's a wee bag  I bought them  that for myself for the wedding  Oh that 's lovely  Is that Monsoon  Accessorize   Uh-huh   And the dress was like that exact  colour  there but  That colour at the back   You know the bridesmaid 's dress you wore at Rosie 's  Uh-huh  Uhm there 's a dress very similar  in the colour and slightly similar style in Debenham 's  I think that colour 's maybe quite popular now  Aye because there wasn't many of it  or there wasn't much of it  Many of it  what was that about  There wasn't much of it whenever we got those dresses and then all of a sudden  A the style and B the colour seems to be all the go  Seems to be in  All the rage cos whenever Lorraine and I went down to Dublin to look for dresses it was effectively the same dress with a slight style change in the detail  you know  but obviously it was proving popular so uhm  Right   Sally-Anne obviously you haven't sat down since you came home  Uh no  Because if you said earlier on you know the way your house was sitting I don't know how you got it done so quickly  Well I 'll tell you a wee secret  Your mummy came up  I came home and my mum had washed all the floors for me  laughter   Mum 's great  Do you remember I was telling you about my mum  had left stuff for Richard   Leaving stuff for Rick   Well we got in  There was this note sitting  A full box of sour cream and chive Pringles  a bottle of of really nice Shiraz  uhm chicken and broccoli lasagne which is his favourite  wedges and chocolate cake  All sitting for him   All for Rick   Mothers are a laugh aren't they  That 's great  Och that 's lovely now  So is he in the house on his own or  So he dropped  me off this   He 's in heaven  by the sounds of it  He 's delighted  Stay away Louise  He 's he 's gone to get a video  He says I 'm going to get a video that you would never watch  So  uhm which will be some sci-fi crap  And uhm  that 's him  Yeah   Enjoy his wine and just  Enjoy his wine  He 'll be  And he 'll not have me there annoying him so he 'll be grand  Where did you get your top Louise  It 's beautiful  Karen Millen  It 's lovely  Very nice   You can always tell  You 'd know to look at it that it was Karen Millen  You see I 've never  it 's one shop I 've never even walked into  Thank-you  Lovely  No I look at that and think I 'll never be like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman  They 'll be telling me to get out  Well I just  half of it wouldn't fit me  you know I wouldn't dream of going into  Karen Millen  The only thing I have noticed is a pair of boots in it which I think are quite nice  Well  do you know that   Aye and I bet you they 're about two hundred quid  Aye their stuff 's so expensive  It depends on what you get   Their sales are  their sales are supposed to be brilliant simultaneous and unclear speech   Is that alright  Are those alright   strong or too  weak or  They 're lovely   Just gorgeous  Perfect  Here cheers folks  Cheers   Cheers   Cheers   Cheers   Thank-you Sally-Anne  This is lovely  Thanks a lot  I 'm really been really looking forward to this  I 'm raring to go  I seriously have this notion  this is just going to be the best night of my life  laughter   Oh Jesus I hope I deliver on that one  No I 'm  Not that  no pressure  No pressure  I 'm back into that hyper mode  I just thought you were very different in the taxi with the taxi driver tonight than you were last week  Can you remember last Friday night  Yeah why what was the taxi driver doing this time  Oh he was just a pain in the arse like   really boring and  talking crap you know what I mean  Talking crap  talking crap  he wouldn't shut up   You know whenever Sarah sort of wants to carry on with the conversation  and  whenever she wants to sort of shut up  Yeah   I went uh-huh  I know  So Angela what are you doing for the rest of the weekend then  Och that 's right yes yes  And then he  several sylls  just continued on with his conversation  He was really a bit of a boring prat like he was
