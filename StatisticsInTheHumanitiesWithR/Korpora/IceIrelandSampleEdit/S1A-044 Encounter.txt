<S1A-044 Encounter>  What 're we now at  Yeah near enough  Cos after him there was a brief fling with a black guy and then Gerry  They 've all been black  2 sylls   Very good  I 've never been out with a black man   There 's a really funny story with the  uhm Jareese  Did I tell you the Jareese story  No  laughter  The one in between Fred and Gerry  laughter  It 's a cracker    Where 's  he from  Uhm America  And uhm  I went in I was going into my favourite  club Q-Bar and went in and I sort of I spotted him first of all  He was at the door doing tickets or whatever and just noticed him  And I thought oh he 's lovely  And the reason why I 'd actually gone there that night was because they had somebody playing trumpet along with the DJ  And I was there for this like big Q-Bar night years before and there was a guy playing violin along with it  And I loved that you  know  So that 's the reason why I went down  And it turned out it was him playing the trumpet  He 's standing on this podium giving it loads with the DJ going on  It was fantastic  And I was going oh my God it 's that guy  So then afterwards he came down and I bumped into him in the crowd and  I don't know we just started chatting and stuff  And he was really sweet  And then he came over again later and we were chatting a bit more  And then he gave me his number and said please call me and I thought well why not  So I arranged this date for me to go and watch him at the Blue Note where he was playing trumpet  So I went along like   Mhm   Is it   Bangkok  Yeah  Right  That was Bangkok  Oh of course like  I mean where else would you get up to that sort of nonsense like  laughter  Fuck  So I went along you know by myself glammed up to the nines  Went into the Blue Note it 's just a smoky jazz place or whatever and sat there and ordered me gin and tonic and just sort of watched him and  whatever  And uhm  and then I met him another night  We went back to the Q-Bar and uh  we were just sitting chatting and stuff  And then we decided  laughter  so funny we decided to like go back to his house  And he 'd never drunk Saeng-Som so I thought right  You 've  got to try  So back to his place and I was still a bit like mm  not too sure you know if I you know I was just playing it cool or whatever  I really fancied him and everything but  So we got back there but I was determined  not to stay for too long  I said oh I 'm only staying for half an hour  And he was trying like he 's got brilliant  uhm movie collection or whatever  And the only I said no something short and the only short thing he had was like the Twin Towers being blown up you know  several sylls  laughter  So we 're sitting watching that right  laughter  And I thought it was fascinating cos I hadn't had a TV in so long  I was going fuck  laughter  Rewind that bit  laughter  Sitting and drinking Saeng-Som  So anyway the next thing was like I just got pissed and I thought oh fuck it  I 'll just stay here  So fell asleep  Right nothing happened  Well we 'd a bit of a snog and a cuddle  And when he got his kit off I just couldn't believe my luck  He was absolutely gorgeous  But by this stage  laughter  I 'd worked out that he was forty-six years old  gasps and laughter  I swear to God I mean he looked about like thirty odd  And he was like fucking married and divorced and had a mad life and all the rest  But uhm  the next thing right then the next day this is the the big point right  It was I just woke up to this  bangs three times  on the door  And I was like what the fuck 's that  And he got up and he went outside and I just heard all this commotion at the door and stuff  And I thought should I get up  And then I just thought  I was just like  let  it go  You know it 's probably his mates or something  you know  So he went off and he didn't come back for about an hour  And I sort of fell asleep again and woke up at about ten o'clock thinking cheeky bastard  You know  he just took off  That 's just really rude  you know  laughter  Aye  So I got up and you know got myself dressed and sorted out  Cheeky fucker  And I was just about to leave when he came back into the room  And he was like  oh my God you 're never going to believe what just happened you know  laughter  And I 'm like  So he said uhm  basically what 'd happened was his ex-girlfriend this Thai girl who he 'd been seeing for one month  who owned  a restaurant you know  Alright  Mm   Let it   Banging on the door   He just left   With his mates   Mhm   Hi  Hi  I didn't know anything about her  Never mentioned her to me  And  they 'd broken up like  a week before  Mhm   Oh fuck   But anyway she called round  Like at least they were broke up  At least they were  laughter  But she knocked on the door like eight o'clock in the morning or something and like I didn't hear any of this  He was going to the door and she was like trying to come in to bring him back this book or  something  And he had said no no no go away  You can't come in  So she of course knew there was somebody there  She came back at nine o'clock  And that that big dush dush dush  noise of banging on door  He opened the door and she shot him with a stun gun  laughter  Bazaam you know like fucking bang  And they 're these things they 're like you know they they put you unconscious for fifteen  seconds  You know  you 're totally out  And apparently like thankfully cos he was dead fit it didn't you know  didn't  work or whatever  He was like really winded but he managed to like grab her  And they were going like this with the stun gun trying to get in to me going let me at her  Let me see her and all this  She was trying to get into the room to get to me  laughter  Can you imagine  Lying in bed with a fucking Saeng-Som hangover and getting stun-gunned in your bed like  laughter  I could 've just  it 's bad enough wakening up  sort of you  don't know some strange bloke running around getting stun-gunned by some psychotic Thai bitch like  It 's just like  laughter  But he had to like wrestle with her and all  And he got her into the lift  And they went down in the lift and all  And he came out and he was going ahh  And the security guards were all standing there just being Thai going uh uh uh and just totally hopeless  Do you know  laughter  God they nearly had to call the police and everything  but they didn't in the end  He managed to calm her down and got her to go away  I was just like phew you know when he told me all this  And I was just like  I was just so hungover and I was just like well  laughter  be thankful she didn't cut your dick off cos that 's what they normally do  Don't think that was a very good response  And he was just going  I feel so cold  I feel so cold  And I was just going  right well see you later  laughter   Mhm   Oh my God   Yeah   Oh my God she was going to get you   Oh I know   And that was the end of that  Och it wasn't really like  I just sort of scampered home  And I was never so glad to get back to me flat like ever  you know  I was  just going like that was just really too much  Or well it could 've been so bad  Like I would just not have appreciated getting stun-gunned  laughter  Do you know what I mean  like really  It 's not on  Do you know  what I mean  I had to go to work later and everything like  It 's fucking not on  So he called and he apologised and all  And I said look you know and I was a bit mm and then I said okay  Look well I suppose you know you haven't been in Thailand very long  you know he 'd only been there four months or whatever  I thought maybe he just doesn't really understand you know  the Thai  women  laughter  basically  So I said alright fair enough  Suppose nobody was more shocked than you were literally  laughter   Mm yeah    3 sylls  shocked   Yeah   Stunned  Stunned  It was shocking  So I invited him over  He came over to my flat and stuff  And that was like you know the first time we had sex  And that was on the Saturday  And then on the Thursday he called me and he said oh I 'm really sorry but uhm  I have a an ex-girlfriend coming over to join me  I think over Christmas actually  She was coming over to join him over Christmas  Another ex-girlfriend  Another ex-girlfriend  And I was just like oh really  Oh really  I was just angry because I was going well if she 's coming on Thursday you must 've known that like last Saturday  No no no she 's just no she 's just called me out of the blue  And I was going oh bullshit  like  Bullshit  Nobody there 's no way you know you 're not going to  know  And he was like oh I 'm so sorry and blah blah blah  And I said like you I said you 're a fucking wanker  First of all I nearly get stun-gunned  and now you 're
