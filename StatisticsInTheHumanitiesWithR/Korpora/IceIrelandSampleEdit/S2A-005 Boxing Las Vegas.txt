<S2A-005 Boxing Las Vegas>  Great venue  Great occasion  Two great fighters  Round two of this uh non-title light middleweight contest  but so much at stake  Americans call it Junior Middleweight  The hundred and fifty-four pound division  Mosley desperate to get back to winning ways after two defeats  by a fairly wide series of margins and one very narrow against Vernon Forrest  Mosley known as Sugar  Sugar Shane Mosley against the man in the red trunks  He was using his head somewhat uh naughtily there  Raul Marquez known as uh  El Diamante  The Diamond  And he is as hard as a diamond  laughter  Marquez hands held very high  This uh  thirty-one year old  it 's his thirty-fifth professional contest remember  But since he lost to Vargos he 's had a series of well fairly nondescript fights against fairly nondescript fighters  And there 's a lot of talk about he 's really just come here for the money and he doesn't have the same burning ambition that Shane Mosley has and that 's could been an an interesting factor Ritchie   Again  the the first minute of this round Marquez starts  to get to work a little bit better  with the long jab and the straight the straight left  And that 's mainly because Mosley 's waiting far too long on the outside  Look it 's better for Marquez again there  That 's literally because Mosley  waited too long and he 's allowing Marquez to work with those nice straight long punches   Well that 's the second time Kenny Bayless has had a little word to uh Raul Marquez  Fast hands once again by Mosley and going into the body  Now one wonders will he be able to carry through the power that he had at lightweight up here to the light middleweight division  He certainly looks solid enough and he doesn't seem to be carrying anything other than muscle  Good fast left hand from Marquez  in the corner where he probably doesn't want to be but he seems happy enough  And Mosley is reading that left of Marquez ' coming over very nicely and he 's slipping inside it  Good solid shot from uh Shane Mosley the Sugar Man  And again great body shot with a right hand  Oh he 's looking so competent Mosley at this stage  Had an iffy start to the round but he 's come back in style   Again great variation of boxing there from Mosley with the upper cuts hooks straight punches as well  powerful shots  He 's looking to step in  and to hurt Marquez  Much better from Mosley  Great reply   Marquez again tried to close the smaller man down  and take away that advantage of Mosley 's greater hand speed but Mosley 's really buzzing now  He looking very confident even at this early stage of the scheduled twelve-rounder  There 's that little clapper board indicates ten seconds to go to the end of the round  And again Mosley gets him  gets outside that southpaw and then comes in with a very good right hand of his own  bell rings  Good finish by Mosley  And doesn't he look strong Ritchie  He looks very compact and and very powerful  cheering and manager 's advice   Bit of action from that round  We 're just listening to some advice from  Shane Mosley 's dad Jack who 's been with him all the way through  Kenny Bayless not altogether happy about the way uh Marquez is behaving himself especially when it comes to breaking when told  Ten seconds out  Let 's go  bell rings   Two absorbing rounds gone and scheduled for ten more  This is the third  The man in the black trunks trimmed with gold Sugar Shane Mosley  won the IDF lightweight title in August of nineteen ninety-eight when he defeated the South African Philip Holiday  Got himself caught there with a good left hand from the man in the red trunks Raul Marquez  And then of course the most  astounding performance of his career came in June two thousand  when he beat the golden boy himself Oscar De La Hoya to take the WBC welterweight title  Marquez not happy indicating I think that Shane Mosley might just have butted him deliberately  And there 's a bit of a  a cut there and it 's a nasty cut  And Marquez saying that that was caused by a butt  Well the doctor 's come over  Well Marquez uh leaving nobody in any doubt at all as to his opinion of what happened there  That was a head butt he said  Don't think Kenny Bayless could disagree with that  Be interesting to have another look at it   Well the heads certainly clashed  It will be interesting to see  When we slow down a little bit we 'll have to have a look because the way he was talking there Marquez he actually thought it was a deliberate butt  I find that hard to believe from uhm a class fighter like Mosley but we 'll just have to wait and see   Well Marquez is the man who 's got the reputation of being something of a real roughhouse fighter  And there again Marquez is not very happy about things  And there 's time out been taken by uh Kenny Bayless   Listen to my command  I will start deducting points if it doesn't stop right now  Understand  Understand  Alright touch gloves   Well Kenny Bayless couldn't be more specific  He 's not liking the way this contest is going  in terms of the uh  little faults by both men  Lot of blood coming down the right-hand side of the face of Raul Marquez  mid-way through this third round  Good left  by Marquez  Good variation by Mosley going down to the body  I think the clashing stars as well means that the heads are going to rub at some stage cos Mosley has definitely got to get on the inside of this guy and so that 's going to bring the heads closer together   And Mosley working very hard to the body  My sympathies to Kenny Bayless  He 's really got his work cut out  with these two  So much at stake especially for uh Mosley  And for a man who wasn't meant to be motivated well Marquez is certainly making a fight of this  And there 's the head rubbing  I don't think that was so much a clash but Marquez very definitely  I 've a feeling trying to get some of his own back with the head  Good right hand came across by Mosley  Didn't quite land on the target  Yeah and again there the  2 syllables  the heads clash but that you know that wasn't deliberate  But they certainly did clash again there so  it 's going to be interesting to see in the replay   Well Marquez has turned away yet again  And he 's not very happy Marquez  Now what is Kenny Bayless going to do about this  Well that 's another head butt  At least uh that was an accidental one  That was uh Marquez was saying that was deliberate  And Marquez now cut very badly over his uh left eye  Well this really is extraordinary  Well  an accidental head butt  And uh the rules are quite specific  If it 's an accidental head butt then the fight has to be stopped  And it may well be be declared a no contest or a technical draw  And Mosley 's not happy with this at all because he hasn't been given the chance to showcase his talents  Marquez I think with a fair degree of uh accuracy claimed that the first butt was deliberate but the second one was accidental  And the contest has been stopped  And Ritchie this is not the uh outcome that we certainly had expected or the one that either fighter would 've wished for  No you you just warming up to be a good contest wasn't it  Was certainly a clash of styles  as I said Mosley had to get inside  I mean heads 're always going to be close in there cos literally the way these both these both guys were boxing  it 's whether that first initial butt was was deliberate is the is the big question which uhm I don't think it was but uh we 'll have to wait and see what  Well I don't suppose we 're ever going to really know but uh what a tragic end to the contest in a way because it was just developing   into a good fight   Well Marquez could not 've continued with uh those eyes especially that left one in that state  That 's a very very nasty cut right on the eyebrow  And the blood was going to stream into his eye and block any sort of vision he had whatsoever  So referee Kenny Bayless had no option but to call this one off  Uh an accidental head butt so the contest has been called off  and we 'll have to see whether it 's going to be uh a no contest  uh or a technical draw  Well Marquez down  Well there 's the bang and that might just 've been the first one  And that 's the one I think that he complained about  Well uh I don't know that he had a great deal of uh justification for that Rich   do you think   No no  well if that was the first butt then I don't think that was deliberate at all  Uh if anything it was Marquez who 's actually coming up with his head  I mean that 's not deliberate butt  That 's just accidental  That 's just the the way the heads 've rubbed and uh  I don't think that was uh deliberate at all   Well the smaller man trying to get inside the uh bigger man  Marquez uh incensed by that uh fairly clearly but I think evidence would suggest that uh it wasn't deliberate  This is the second one  And there was a bang and that was accidental  Now that was accidental  Marquez  can't complain about that whatsoever  And that really was the one that has caused the end of the contest  So uh Marquez ' suspect eyebrows 've gone  He came storming in and there 's the bang  Nothing deliberate  No intent on the part of Mosley whatsoever  But how unfortunate indeed there for both boxers  Yeah it 's unfortunate  And it and it was accidental because there 's Marquez  He 's actually coming forward so it wasn't deliberate at all from Mosley   Gentlemen this bout comes to an end  The official time is two minutes forty-one seconds of round number three  As referee Kenny Bayless calls a halt to the action in the ring  Raul Marquez suffered a wound too difficult for him to continue  Referee stops the bout  Four rounds must be completed to go to a decision  Therefore this contest is called no decision   Well not satisfactory at all  Another couple of rounds it would 've gone to points  But because it happened within four rounds it 's gone to a no decision  And whether they will meet again or not we 'll have to wait and see  And Shane Mosley have to wait may have to wait a while longer for a crack for the second time at Oscar De La Hoya interruption of commentary for studio discussion   The vastly experienced Joe Cortez brings them together  This could be a very interesting contest  Antonio Margarito  the man in the white trunks with that uh green trim  making the second defence of his title  Margarito hasn't lost a contest for some six and a half years  but he 's taking a fair old chance against another very experienced man now thirty-two years old  Eight years older than him  Andrew Lewis from Georgetown in Guyana and now resident in Brooklyn in New York  who 's only once in a good career and that was almost a year ago to the formidable Ricardo Mayorga  who recently deposed Vernon Forrest  So the winner of this  WBO version of the welterweight bout might just get a crack at the ferocious Nicaraguan Ricardo Mayorga in the not too distant future  Interesting contrast of styles  Andrew Lewis one of those nasty awkward southpaws  And Margarito has not been in against too many southpaws  Lewis giving away a little bit of height and a little bit of reach  But Margarito a very very accomplished boxer  Yeah he 's got a nice jab and a nice straight right hand has Ron Margarito  He 's really got to time  the punch to perfection tonight  cos Lewis very quick at the feet  Steps in  Works works his punches in clusters and then he gets out so Margarito 's  got to be very precise and get that timing right with that right hand   Margarito  trained by uh Jose Valdes has come here  of a win last October his first defence against the very good uh Danny Perez won a unanimous decision in Anaheim just outside Los Angeles  With a right hand to the body from uh Margarito  This scheduled remember for twelve three-minute rounds  And Lewis as ever putting the pressure on  He 's a little bit on the short side  but he 's trying to take away that height and reach advantage  That was a good right hand went in by the uh Guyanan  Margarito looks a little bit out of sorts in this opening round Ritchie  Yeah he just got good head movement now and the work on the inside he 's moving his head well  Just occasionally he turns southpawed  It makes me wonder whether he has been a southpaw during his career at some stage  or whether he 's actually comfortable boxing both  orthodox and the southpawed style  But uh now and again when they 're coming close you he change  to that uh  southpaw  Lewis 'll have to look out for that   Well Margarito is fighting a very  interesting contest at this stage  He 's uh  decided to stand and trade  He 's a pretty heavy puncher  He 's won eighteen of his uh twenty-seven victories inside the distance  But Lewis is a very formidable hitter  Twenty-two contests  twenty-two wins I should say and twenty inside the distance  Was another good little left hand coming through from uh Andrew Lewis the former WBA title holder  And with all due respect to the WBO I think the WBA Ritchie would be regarded with uh greater prestige  I think so and I think this is probably uhm a  a stepping stone  Quite well obviously both these guys will be looking at at a future fight with Mayorga  No doubt about that   Interesting opening round that for uh Antonio Margarito  Didn't get it all his own way  And Javier Cavalito I think not altogether happy with that uh  opening three minutes from his man Antonio Margarito  A glance there from Joe Cortez  6 sylls  round Lewis ' corner   2 sylls  saying to Andrew Lewis who 's the best and for quite a while he was the best  Won his WBA title  two years ago stopping James Page  So round two of the scheduled twelve-rounder for the WBO  welterweight title  Antonio Margarito  didn't get uh anything out of his  first attempt to win this title  But then in July of two thousand and one against the uh Puerto Rican Daniel Santos  and it was stopped after one round  cos Margarito had a very bad cut  due to an accidental head butt  A lot of that coming  And that 's good work by Andrew Lewis  And his hands are that little bit faster  And Margarito is a little bit lazy and a little bit slow especially with that left of his Ritchie  Yeah  Margarite  Margarito has got to start uh reading the situation here because Lewis is just  he 's literally bluffing him with that that very light jab that he that he uses  And and it is a distraction really because it 's what 's to follow that  He 's just literally  uh pawing away with that jab very light punches but it 's what 's uh what 's coming after that the twos and threes afterwards that are more significant punches from Lewis   Well this is the man who after ten professional contests moved from Georgetown in Guyana  having held his country 's  domestic title and he moved to Brooklyn in New York  and that 's been a very successful move for him  But he 's now thirty-two years of age  But you 've got to say that in most of the top half dozen divisions in the world seven out of ten boxers are thirty and over so it 's not a young man 's game  That was better from Margarito  More of a slap  But Lewis is looking very confident  He 's holding the hands a little bit on the low side though
