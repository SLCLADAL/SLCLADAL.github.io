<S1B-049 M O Suilleabhain>  And the the music you make   uh  contrasting your music with your your teacher 's  Sea/n O/ Riada  Mm  It seems to me now you 're making a different kind of a statement with your music  He was talking about  it seems to me  the nation  You 're talking about the spirit  You have a wider perspective  So I can see that in the music  you 're you 're  you 're more European than he was  you 've advanced  Would would I be right in that  Well I I 'm not sure it is  Uhm I I think the age that  well I mean the eighties has been  has funnily enough  you know  some of my music when 'twas released in America got put on the New Age rack  And I was  once asked by somebody was I insulted at this  I 'm not really  Do you know I mean most of the New Age stuff one sees is really like horrible  but but I 'm not really  But but there is  there is something of the times that if one  expresses  a time that one lives in and the time we live in now is uh  is actually a searching by all kinds of people for the spirit  Mm  And if for many people uh institutionalised religion has soured for them  or for some reason or another  I think  that they feel for whatever reason they need to go beyond it or  beneath it or  beside it  uhm it 's a time like that and there 's a there is a lot of that I think  of that timelessness in music right now  But I do believe music is political  I do believe that all music all true music  is political  I do think it 's a political statement because it 's a it 's a statement of where you are  at a particular point of time  And I strongly believe that  okay it 's easy to see particularly in  like nationalistic music  you know  And if you pick for example you mentioned O/ Riada if you pick an obvious one there Mise E/ire  Mm   Yeah  Okay you associate it with the images of the film Mise E/ire and all of that and the  words   Well it 's not only the images  The very   1 syll  personality of it   Yes yes  absolutely agree  If it were just the music on its own you still would  feel that   You 'd say  that 's Ireland  Yeah that 's Ireland  That 's right  And it 's uh that particular kind of feeling about Ireland  you know which  one be  describe it as cultural nationalist   You you   also about Ireland  Well it is about Ireland but you know it 's the time  The time is you we we cannot uh afford  to relax into that comfortable feeling of culture and nationalism anymore  Yeah  And I 'm you know like  I would feel part of a generation  which was uh at the uh  at the cutting edge but certainly we were the first ones to bang into the wall of the problem of globalisation and global culture  Mm  And I think rather than resisting this  uhm I think we should help it along  I think we should actively  uhm you know that that concept of the human family as a as a global family  Now where nationalism goes in the middle of all of that I don't know  I don't think it need be thrown out but it 's a kind of a post-nationalism  in a way  that 's the way I would describe it  Because there are European  American influences in your music at least  so it seems to me  Oh there 's no question about that you  know   Jazz  for instance  and  2 sylls  and   Absolutely very much  Absolutely  and the piano of course is a very cosmopolitan  suave instrument  you know  And to play it with uh  to play Irish music on it  you know it 's a bit like  you know playing it with wellingtons on or something  do you know  laughter  Uh that  like there is that  I remember a reviewer once in a UK magazine  uh said that uh when he heard the record I had done said it sounded like a pint of Guinness was pouring into the piano  laughter  And that was a bit mean  there is an Irishness and the Irishness for me in the music  piano music I play is like an anchor  a vital anchor  Mm mm   Yeah  I don't want to leave go of it because if I feel I do  in the context of this globalisation  well I 'm out to sea  laughter  With no  uh and no compass  no sense of where I am  So I do believe in roots   You 're searching in your  I remember uh in the Oilea/n Suite the  Suite Oilea/n  uh put on top of one the pieces a quotation of Nuala Ni/ Dho/mhnaill 's for instance  Uh  Oilea/n 'se/ mo chorp oilea/n mar i muire  My body  is an island in the midst of a vast sea  a lot of your music seems to be  have a kind of a melancholy about the human condition  And it 's uh otherwise its joyful but there 's a melancholia uh going through  it 's in the searching  Am I wrong in that  Yeah   Ah    Uh I I I think that 's true  Ah no I really think it 's true  I remember somebody describing to me once uh saying  that uhm one of  the human being 's most pleasant feelings  is the one of sweet sadness  You know that  combination  of the two  And that  there 's a  uh a melancholic thing about that  There 's also a nostalgic thing  There 's a feeling of  being somewhere other than where you should be and you want to be there  Mm   Yeah  And all of that kind of feeling  Music is a wonderful way of of expressing that  Uh so  you know there 's a wonderful word too in Irish  uaigneas  That 's uh uh people say it 's very difficult to translate  into English  Loneliness is too blunt a word  Mm  And  uaigneas  is something that uh some of us would claim you can hear  even in certain players playing fast music  a reel which is supposed to be joyous  but it 's tinged in some way or other  with this colour of  uaigneas   like the music of Tommy Potts  He was admired so much on the fiddle  yes that 's a wonderful example  I I was just talking to students about that today  I mean there was a passionate and spiritual man you know  And his music is just uh shot through with with spirit  in a most wonderful way  Are you a  religious individual would you say  Uhm I 'm  uhm uhm  Uh no I would think yes  Yes in the sense that I would pray  uh in the sense that I couldn't imagine  life without a belief in a loving God  You know it just doesn't make sense to me  So yes I am religious  In that sense I suppose I 'm very religious  but not necessarily in an institutionalised sense  Uhm  Belief in God   It always seems to me that the very fact of music  is one of the proofs of the existence of God  Well I mean you know I I certainly 'd be the last person to argue against that  On the other hand  I think I can imagine a good musician who said he was  an atheist  Oh yes  You know uh which doesn't necessarily prove that God doesn't exist either  I mean he may be his own  proof of the it he 's the validity of his own argument  Do you know  2 sylls  yeah   I  I  I  that people people can write music and appreciate it both seems to me to be a suggestion that there is something more to the human being  uh than  we can perceive  You know   Well you  know when you really come up against it  It 's when you bring art into the marketplace  You know that 's where the sparks fly you see  because if there is spirit in it and you  there 's  one thing you can't sell it 's that of course even  if you know it 's there  Yeah    Yeah  It 's just unsaleable  Yeah but you 've brought it into the marketplace  Yes I know  I suppose that 's why I 'm saying it because in a way I 'm speaking to some degree from experience  Luckily  not too much into the market as I haven't been faced with  certain problems which would obviously come up if you begin to do that  But I have my toes have dipped into the water  4 sylls   laughter   Yes and uh some of your stuff it seems to me even  3 sylls  is  uh you could sell that as a single   Yeah uh funnily enough it was supposed to 've come out as a single  As it is  it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra  yeah it has it has it it does  You know I don't deliberately write music which is potentially popular  but some of the music I would write or or or work out  on the keyboard or otherwise  happens to be in the realms of popularity  You know I am fortunate or unfortunate whatever way you want to look at it  uh to actually be dealing with those materials of sound  I have friends who  who work  exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible  you know ninety-nine percent of the people  You know when I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless   4 sylls    Like  Well I 'm I 'm thinking actually of an Irish composer called Gerald Barry  in particular  who is a Clare man and who lives in Dublin and who wrote  spent ten years of his life writing an opera  called The Intelligence Park which got its premiere in London and Dublin  this summer  And uh he 's a friend of mine and  he sent me on a a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to  And I think it 's extremely complex music  I I couldn't ask  most of my friends to listen to it  You know  I know they would have a huge problem  But I mean I myself am full of admiration uh for it  But what I 'm saying is that somebody like him and many others work uh with materials of sound which are all fanatically not popular  I mean let me tell you that these are not popular  laughter  under any circumstances  No tunes  Any any marketplace  kn  know in that sense no tunes or  you know uhm no  Do you think a melody should have tunes or  No I don't think so  I I really I I I don't necessarily think so  I I think it 's possible to have  yeah I think it 's possible to have music without  without  tunes   All  your  music has  Oh very yes it 's very melodic   there 's no  question about that yeah  Yeah   Do you think it shouldn't be or  are you striving to go  beyond the melody  I 'm striving to go yes I 'm  no not so much beyond I I would I am  what I do in music seems to be increasingly as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality  And to me music is  a sound that you send out a bit like a scout  to check  the ground  and to clear the overgrowth  and then you enter into the space  It seems to me that when I write music which is worth writing it 's ahead of me  And there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you  you see  This is a very complex statement  Well well I don't know  I mean it 's thinking that music uh is simply uh can be ahead of a person and ahead of society  Yeah that 's something that a painter said to me the other day that when he starts off  with a brush loaded with paint and confronts a canvas he doesn't quite know what he 's going  do  He hopes  that he  starts off very simply  and hopes that he can elaborate  that something will appear  Yeah yeah
