<S1A-001 Riding>  Well how did the riding go tonight  It was good so it was  Just I I couldn't believe that she was going to let me jump  that was only the fourth time you know  It was great  laughter   What did you call your horse  I can't remember  Oh Mary 's Town  oh  And how did Mabel do  Did you not see her whenever she was going over the jumps  There was one time her horse refused and it refused three times  And then  she got it round and she just lined it up straight and she just kicked it and she hit it with the whip  and over it went the last time you know  And Stephanie told her she was very determined and very well-ridden  laughter  because it had refused the other times you know  But Stephanie wouldn't let her give up on it  She made her keep coming back and keep coming back  it jumped it you know  It was good  Yeah I 'm not so sure her jumping 's improving that much  seemed to be holding the reins very tight  Yeah she was  That 's what Stephanie said  She  needed to  give the horse its head  Mm   She wasn't really getting into the jumping position the way she used to  You see we haven't done any jumping for quite a few weeks now  you  know any proper jumping really  And so she probably has lost the  momentum for it or if that 's the right word  Mm   Mm  Did she  she was keen to go in the  the jumping lane  But it 's been going for three four weeks now and there 's only one more week of it left and that 's next Monday  So I said to or Stephanie said there was a new one starting at the end of September  So I said she 'd be far better waiting  for that one  you know and starting anew fresh  Yeah but I mean what is the jumping like  It 's just with uh they do jumps and  whoever 's the best goes top of the league  you know   So  it 's like another lesson but they they do jumping during it  Well that 's the impression I got  I 'm not sure now  We didn't discuss it you know  Well it sounds like more money  Uh six pounds  laughter   Do you not think we 're paying enough  laughter  But Stephanie says that 's for the club  the pony club  although outsiders can jump in it but that there 's a riding school pony league starting at the end of September  for anybody  Right  And so I think she 'll be just far better waiting and sorting that out  Yeah  Mabel said like she would go on Monday and do without her lesson on Tuesday  you know  But I was keeping her going cos I says oh I wouldn't do without mine you see  laughter   Well is she ready for school tomorrow  I think so  She 's her bag packed and  washed out and  her pencil case filled and so on  Is she taking the school bag that uh she had at primary school  Yeah she is  Will it look okay with her new uniform  Well it 's the same colour anyway  laughter   Well that 's good  Well she seems happy enough  I said she didn't have to take it tomorrow  that she could take her you know the wee shoulder bag she has  Mhm  And I said she could just take it tomorrow but she seems to want to take the schoolbag  Aye she 's probably  better   So  although you see I don't think she 's getting any books or anything tomorrow  I think tomorrow 's just to get her locker  sort of show them around  uhm you know their timetable and  give them their timetable and show them where the classrooms are   several sylls    What about this uh  this bus pass  Well  Should she get that tomorrow  She may get it tomorrow she may get it on Thursday  They said when I rang up the Education Board that she would get it on her first day at school  So I don't know if that would count as tomorrow  or Thursday  But again they may organise that tomorrow you know  Mhm   She 's got a a zip on the inside pocket of  her blazer  I  said that  she should have a few pound in there just in case she might get stuck  Yeah   I said to her that she did tell me that  but I said that uhm  she 'll probably be leaving her blazer in the cloakroom  She 'll not be wearing it all the time  And I wouldn't like it to be left down somewhere  with money in it  Well now I think I think she should have  money that she can make a phonecall  and money  in case she loses her bus pass and she has to  pay for the bus home  Well she should have I mean she 'll probably be taking a couple of pound to school everyday anyway  not to spend as such but you know for that reason  to have a couple of pound in her pocket just  Well maybe somewhere in her  pencil case or something   Well she 's well  she 's got a zip in her pocket of her skirt  Well that would do  Yeah so that closes with a zip  She may be taking other things in and out of that all the time  Well I don't know  I mean she 'll have her locker key in it too probably  What about uh Chloe and Penny  They ready  I think they 're ready too  didn't she show you her uniform already  Didn't she try it on   She did yeah  Mhm she looked good  She 's very pleased with it so she is  very pleased  So she has her schoolbag packed with her pencil case and that and her  bits and pieces that she 'll never have out for the first six months you know  laughter  But uhm  she wants to take you know the wee sort of flat schoolbag that she has  Mhm  She wants to take that one  But it falls off her shoulders awfully easy and I 'd rather she 'd take the other wee  rucksacky-type one  because it stays up much better  But she 's insisting on taking the other one  I remember years ago when we had the wee red Escort  we were up at that uh garage at Black 's Road  getting a new tyre  Mhm  And this uh  some friend of your dad 's  was working there  I can't remember his name now  I don't  Andy or Johnny somebody  Ah  Was it Andy  Wasn't Andy no  Anyway he was telling us that uh  Was it not Basil  No  No it wasn't Basil  He was telling us that that morning he 'd just uh  sent his youngest child out to primary school  laughter  with a wee tear in his eye  laughter  And uh we 're doing it now  will you have a wee tear in your eye  Well I won't be seeing her going so  laughter   Mm it seems strange  I have to take Julie down at her usual time and Chloe starts at ten past nine  so I 'll just you know there 's no point in me doing anything else going anywhere else  So I 'll just take her down then  But uh I don't know how long  I 'll be expected to stay  cos I 'll have Monica with me as well  Somehow I don't think it 's going to be a problem for Chloe  laughter  She 's looking forward to it I think  I don't think it 'll be like my first day at school  I don't remember mine  Oh I remember mine  I think I screamed and kicked the whole day  That wouldn't surprise me now  laughter  I don't remember anything about my first day  I I don't remember my first  primary one really at all  Oh I remember sitting beside  a fella called Bernard Bowman  and he was the only friend in the world I had  laughter  for a few weeks  I don't remember  I remember  half-way through P-one  we changed from the old Lambeg school  to the Harmonstown Hill Primary school  And I remember changing over  And I remember before that I remember  walking home from school a couple of times  my mum pushing the big pram  So it must 've been Angeline still in the big pram  She must 've been about three  But they did that then didn't they  They kept you in a big pram for a long time  They did  laughter   Aye that 's what me mum always says about Angeline and all  Yeah  Cos the prams were so big that you could stay in them for ages  You just didn't have a buggy you see  And so   Well I  I sort of way remember  before I started school we used to go down  from Finaghy on the train  to Belfast and walk on round to  my granny 's on the Donegall Road  Mhm  And I think  my mum took the big pram on the train  She did  She told  me   They  slid the doors open  And  uh so there 's was always a   a mail  a mail uh carriage  Yes   A guard   Yeah  And there was these big sacks in it  but you could there 's room to wheel the pram on as well  Yeah  You know  But some of those trains  some of those trains were steam trains you know  Would somebody 've helped youse   Were they  Aye  I didn't think you were that old a puppy  No no there  laughter  there were steam trains yeah big puffers  laughter  And uh  I remember the uh  there was a stationmaster at each station  Yes  And there was always it wasn't just a shelter  It was a  complete   They sold  tickets and everything  Oh yeah they sold tickets but there was a  a fireplace and all  in the  shelter  And you used to come in and it was completely closed in  You opened the door and closed it behind you  Mhm   Uh-huh  And there was seats right round with the fire place in the middle  And then at the end of it  there was a like a little office  and that 's where the uh stationmaster stayed  Mhm  And he gave the tickets out from there and came out and  put more coal on the fire and  and the odd time he had a pot of tea going and you you 'd get people sharing and that so  You called the the guy at Finaghy Gerry  laughter  In fact there was two  uhm two guys  One was this  Gerry was the smaller of the two and the more friendly  the other was a bigger guy  I sort of way remember him because a few times there were  us kids playing around the station and he used to chase you  you know  and of course you never needed chased cos you were such a good child  That 's right  laughter  mm I don't remember  my first experience of going on a train was whenever I was  starting Friends '  Ah I was well used to it before I went to Friends '  No I wasn't  I remember trying to cross the railway lines one day  and I tripped and fell and I looked up and the Dublin Express was heading straight for me  And I had to crawl across the railway lines to get out of the way of the Dublin Express  Tell you I never crossed the railway lines again  Did the driver see you  Did he  No he didn't stop at all  laughter   Did he sound his horn  I don't remember  I  I don't know  I just remember looking up and seeing it coming  and crawling across the railway lines  And I couldn't go home  we  we  I 'd cut my legs and  my socks were covered in oil  And I couldn't go home  laughter  cos my mummy would 've killed me  laughter  never mind the train  I had to turn my socks inside out  and then of course all the oil went into my cuts  laughter  And I had to go round school the whole day  with my socks turned inside out  No
