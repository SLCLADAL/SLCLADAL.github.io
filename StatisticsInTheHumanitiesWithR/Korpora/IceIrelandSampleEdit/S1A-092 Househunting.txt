<S1A-092 Househunting>  But I mean you know  probably for you and Clarisse  the Ormeau Road  would be the best   Well  and even Forestside  you know  Probably   Where is there around  Forestside   It 's  uh well no there 's loads  Is there  Yeah and they 're all like family homes kind of with gardens and garages and shit like that for  well I 've seen them advertised between seventy plus kind of thing  Really  Yeah  God  Which is you know  just up the road really from  Ormeau   Yeah  yeah totally  Yeah  So is Clarisse not  thinking about   What  about Rosetta  Uhm oh I think it will be too expensive round Rosetta  Really  Yeah I mean oh God  sound of crashing and laughter   What happened  there   There 's cardboard  tubes just fell down  laughter  Uhm no is uh  is not sort of a bit more sort of well it 's either Protestant estates or  nice family homes semi-detached with gardens  that are  pretty you know  expensive  You know Mairead 's mum 's kind of style  I  think so anyway like  Right   Right   Okay   Yeah  But I think it 's it 's more Proddy than anything  laughter   Yeah even up around Finaghy you know you 've got your wee pockets and stuff  Yeah I know  But yeah you do just have to to have to be aware  laughter  You don't want to end up in this  Protestant enclave  laughter   No I don't like cos I don't want to you know I want just just want to feel comfortable  you know in the area I 'm in   I know  I know  Absolutely  I know I didn't I didn't want to do the whole sort of  you 've got to be a Protestant to live here kind of  thing you know  I kind of have but I sort of took faith in the fact that you know I 've got a few Catholic friends living round me so that 's  okay  laughter  No but it is I mean I used to live like right off My Lady 's Road  and you know  whenever I first bought a house  And it was so Protestant you know  Yeah   Yeah   Uh-huh   Mm  Unbelievably so  But it just seems to be really really relaxing now which is good  Yeah  So when do you think you 're going to start looking  Are you   3 sylls    Well I phoned  up about uhm a couple today  around  the Finaghy area  but there were both under offer  Uh-huh   Really yeah yeah  And the I I actually went last night to take a peek at one of them  Mhm  Cos it 's not far from here  Mhm  And it looked great  Really  Yeah  God  It was it looked huge  Massive big front garden and back  you know really private back garden patio  Mm  Extended new kitchen out the back  uhm summer seat   see  that 's probably what you 'll find out there cos it 's  you know it 's a bit further outside Belfast so therefore they are going to be cheaper than than the Ormeau Road  Yeah  Do you know what I mean  You 're going to get be able to get bigger houses  Yeah but just now that I 'm used to  living out here you know  what 's  another ten minute walk up the road  Do you  know what I mean   Yeah   Yeah  totally  And Finaghy 's got all the amenities and stuff and it 's  well there 's certain pockets there supposed to be very sort of middle upper class aren't there  You know   Yeah I know  It is  You have to make sure that 's what Clarisse wants as well  I know  Yeah  Oh I know  I 'm just uh I just want to keep looking for maybe a month or two  Mm  And just look and look and see  You know Brendan said just keep looking and see what you expect what you should expect for that kind of money  so that  you know what kind of offer to put in like   So if I get serious about any uh I 'll call on you to come and help me look  Absolutely   Yeah   Och do totally  I 'd love to  Mm have you any free time  Are you on full-time now  Well I 'm on full-time like but uhm  there 's a lot of days  uh like I don't work on Wednesdays and Fridays now  Mhm  But I would work at nights you know to compensate for that  So yeah  What 're you at this weekend  What 're you doing tonight  Uhm we 're just staying in tonight  We 've been for a few pints and  now we 're making food  And we 're going to sit on the settee and read magazines and watch TV  laughter   Charming  Charming I know  But uhm tomorrow night  Daithi/ is no not Daithi/ 's not having a party his friends are having a party  And   Who  Wee Daithi/  Wee Daithi/ yes  Fred and Tom are having a party up on the Antrim Road  and apparently there 's going to be decks and stuff there  So I 'm definitely going to go cos I 'm working from uhm six to eleven tomorrow night  Uh-huh  So I 'm just going to like have a drink here and then go up afterwards  Right  What about you  Well Bad Manners are playing tomorrow night   Yes Saoirse was  saying Jessie 's going  Are you going as  well   And I love them   Jessie 's  not going  Oh is she not  Not as far as I know  Oh I must 've got confused between you and Jessie  laughter   Cos Jessie uhm  was saying she wants to go on a binge on Saint  Paddy 's Day all day  So she wants to save herself Saturday night  Oh yeah that 's right   Ah  Which is just nonsense  It kind of is isn't it  But Bad Manners is on and then Crescent Arts is on after that  I know it is  I know and I was just  torn between   Mm and I was  hoping you 'd go  And I was going to but then we heard about this party and I think it is actually going to be really good  Uh-huh  So it 'd be really good if you could come up afterwards or something  Give me the hold on and  I 'll get a pen   I mean I don't know  the address  I don't  know  I 'll have to tell you tomorrow   Oh you don't know   Well just text it to me tomorrow  Yeah I mean the only thing is it 's on the Antrim Road  But I really do think it 's going to be dead good  How far up  Uhm I really don't know  Mm  Honestly  but uhm  yeah any parties we 've been to you know with them has been just the best  Right  So I mean  we 'll probably get there like while you 're at the Crescent so I 'll text you and let you know anyway whether it 's good or not  Sound  So at least you can come to a party that 's good  laughter  and you might end up in the Crescent  Probably  laughter   And what about Saint Paddy 's day  I figure we 're definitely going to go for a few drinks or something   Like  fiddle-de-dee or  something  What do you think   Well   Mhm  there 's  parades and all on  downtown at  half one  Is there   Yep  What kind of parades  I don't know  Belfast 's biggest parades ever apparently  laughter   Really  laughter   What are people doing  What  Wearing green and being Irish  What do they do  Well Jessie 's trying to get a posse together  to  uhm sort of meet up and  go down town and go round all like the John Hewitt and bars like that you know and listen to fiddle-de-dee  It 's  going to be bunged like but  sure  Right   Yeah   Och yeah I think that 'd be good  Even just a few pints or something to see how long we can last after Saturday night  laughter   aye right enough  Sure we could go straight there from Saturday night  laughter   Well we could do yeah absolutely  Oh God  laughter  No definitely I 'm so up for like going out on Sunday  I 'd kill myself if I didn't  Don't ever not go out on Saint Patrick 's  Day  has to be done  I know   Have you heard from Clarisse recently  No I haven't actually  She doesn't send me emails anymore  laughter   I haven't heard from  her in a week  or something  She was sending me quite regular ones cos I 'm on  email every day you know   I 've  access to it now whereas before it was like once a month you know  Does she write to you   Yeah   Yeah have you been uhm looking at estate agents uhm on the internet  No  Cos they 're really really good  Are they up-to-date  Totally up-to-date  Brilliant  Much better than than the papers and stuff that you get  Oh right  Yeah I must uhm  I 'll email you the addresses of them all   Is it Property News Property News  dot com  They aren't actually that good  Right  Because uhm  I think because they collate so many other estate agents into their newspaper that you know they can be really behind  Mhm  Whereas all the actual specific ones uhm  especially in East Belfast anyway you know Pooler Watson Cowley Groves and and estate agents like that  they 're  always really up-to-date  Mhm   Right  And probably somewhere round the Ormeau Road as well  But I 'll email you the addresses of them anyway so that you can have a look  Okay mhm  That 'll be good  Aye just send it on to me  So what was Clarisse saying  when was it I think it was about a week ago I heard from her  Mhm  I 'm damned if I can remember  laughter  We kind of have wee conversations now like you know  It 's not it 's not tell me about  your whole last month  you know  What 're you doing  yeah  Is she okay anyway  And she 's doing the teaching and all and  Yeah she was saying she missed her  her friends from Maris from the old school that she was working in  Yes  So maybe she doesn't see them so regularly  Yeah cos whenever I was speaking to her on the phone she said she was quite lonely  because  just you know she didn't have people to talk to all day at work  She 's  just kind of doing it by herself  I can totally understand that cos that 's kind of what I 'm doing  laughter  She 's got no no work colleagues anymore  It 's really really weird  you know  Really strange  But uhm  yeah  Mhm   Yeah   Yeah   Is she doing just private then  in in the evening  Huh  Is she doing just private in the evening  I think so yeah  And then all day Saturday apparently  I think so  Seems strange  Mightn't look good on a employment record  as well   I  I  kind of think that she isn't really making the most of it anymore  That she 's just kind of staying there cos that 's what 's familiar  Do you  know what I mean  Yeah
