<S1A-020 Taxi driver>  Lu  Louise did you hear about the taxi driver last week  No  Telling me that uhm he  when Sarah and Monica and Laura got out of the taxi  cos they uh Laura was parked on University Avenue  so  when they got out of the taxi the taxi driver was chatting to me and I was like I was just going bloody great because of course Sarah had been chatting away to him and I was going he 's going to be expecting me to be a friendly girl now as well and I just  I I can't be bothered like  But he was really really nice actually  He said to me I know a few solicitors cos he 'd  I 'd said something  and uhm  Mhm   No cos he 'd remember that was the whole laugh  He asked what do y'all do  And you went oh no blah blah blah and he says okay apart from models remember and that 's how  3 sylls  Sarah  Mm   Oh   Yeah   What do you think we do  laughter   That 's how the craic started  Sorry for interrupting Sally-Anne  but  cos I know you hate saying that you 're a solicitor cos then you usually get sort of  No no no    Oh I had a car accident   I 've a friend who needs such and such   So this guy said uhm  he knew a partner out of uhm Anderson and Lowe  Mhm  And I was wondering is it Bill Fitzgerald who I had a case against uhm but it wasn't  And then he said  so he told me the name of the guy and I didn't know him and he said uhm  aye and I took a girl uh to a formal  my school formal  She 's a solicitor now  Angie McDonagh  Did I tell you this  You  you told uhm was it  did you tell Aaron Speight or something or  Stephan   No I did  not  You did  Oh I told Stephan maybe at  I told Stephan when I was opening the post  That 's who it was   Uh-huh that was it  We were opening the post last week  And I just thought  co  cos you know the way  like Angie just always looks so perfect and actually she paid to go to this  1 syll   He he 's so  what was his craic  Something like you have to or  Well he said you know och well I mean  girls like to be asked like you know uh  It 's a bonus  for them   That 's the main thing  It 's a bonus for them to be asked so I mean I figured she wouldn't mind paying and she didn't  He said so if you see her tell her Obie was asking for her  Obie   Obie  laughter   I just think it 's  so funny after you seeing her   You see Sally-Anne what you need to say to her  next time you 're in the gym and you know she 's walking past you you  go  Obie was asking for you  That 's    That 's exactly what I 'm  You paid to go to a formal with him  Angie I  met this guy who knows you and wait til you hear   You paid to go to a formal with Obie  laughter   It 's just quite funny after you meeting her and everything in the gym and her being so bloody  rude  Oh did you meet her  I didn't hear that part of it  Well I met her in the gym  I met her a couple of times in the gym and she pretended she didn't see me  Then one day she did see  like she was literally walking past me and she had to say something  and she went hiya   she would 've  chatted away to you when you were a pupil wouldn't she  Like that 's   Sure I sat in the same office as her  We shared an office and got on  I mean we did get on  well   Aw she probably  didn't recognise you  Huh  She probably didn't recognise you  Are you being funny  Well I mean if you 're sitting in an office same office with someone for two years of course you 're going to recognise them  laughter   Oh sorry  I was going  do you do you think  Is it the hair  laughter   That 's what people say you know when you haven't seen them  or you know oh I didn't recognise you there  I don't really understand that one actually I must say uhm so  I know because the irony being  I mean we 've all done it  You just think I just can't be assed  talking to that  person  But it takes more out of you to avoid them  than  it does to say  hello what you doing   Yeah    Uh-huh   To actually find out   And keep walking  Exactly  But Roisin thinks  I 'm really odd cos if I see people from school who I haven't seen in a while my immediate reaction is to duck into the nearest shop  I mean that 's just my reaction   5 syllables    Well you see it 's hard cos   It depends on the person too   You see but it 's  I find it very hard because you 're like all  you invariably have to ask them so what are you  at  or what are you up to  And then when they  ask you what are you up to  Oh I 'm a solicitor  I 've just bought a house blah-de-blah-de-blah they think then that you 've  asked this  Mhm   To tell you  for you to tell them all about you    several sylls    So I end up saying then like oh I 'm just working away in Belfast  So you end up getting nowhere with the conversation anyway cos you 're not telling anything  you 're not  sharing anything  1 syll   You 'll not get any back  you 're no further forward  So hello how are you doing and walk on  Yeah   Would you get a lot of that  As in like you 're the big girl who 's going to Belfast and has got a plan and career and all this kind of stuff  from people who don't uh know me  laughter  But  but it 's actually quite funny because at when I was at that christening last Sunday and there was a  uh Felice 's aunt used to teach in our school  and actually I 'm now realising that it 's not a bad thing you know  just well I  you know I work hard so I think  well I am sort of semi-successful so why should I be putting myself down going  do you know what I mean  But it  It it it 's just it wouldn't occur  to the rest of us to even put in the  semi  laughter   I end up   You are successful  But I end up like over-compensating saying och I 'm just working away  Instead of saying yeah work 's going well or whatever  But yes  they would  But you are always better to underplay it  oh absolutely  But you know I do find that it 's all you know oh right and things are going really well and blah-de-blah   several sylls    And what  do you find when you say you 're practice manager  Would you  would you  use that title  I don't   I don't   What do you   People say  well people know that I 've been in a solicitors ' for so long now they  just say  are you still in the solicitors '  And I go yeah  Yeah   Oh right  Right  So you 're actually not even given the chance to say how well you 've done really  No there 'd be very few people who 'd know that I 'm   That 's a shame   Practice manager   Practice manager  Practice manager of one of the biggest commercial law firms in Belfast  I mean that 's a job  I 'd never say that to anybody   I couldn't  I couldn't imagine that you would  Being you  laughter   Well I just say  several syllables   I just work for a solicitors '  I know but sometimes it 's easier isn't it  Well it is and then if they walk away feeling better that 's grand  Sure you know the craic yourself  Have to admit it depends on the person  Like  sometimes if you 've got a real  pain in the arse  who is bumming and blowing about what they 've done and all the rest of it you sort of go   can't stand you anyway so you know if if you ask me what I do I 'll say that I 'm a practice manager you know  It 's  just being really bitchy in that sort of scene or being  really   bitchy but  if they 're  if they 're they 're sort of bumming and blowing and you never really got on with them anyway and they 're just really speaking to you because they can't get away from you or they have to  Yeah   Pain in the ass   Wait til you hear   Yeah   No it 's   No  It 's just protecting yourself   Yeah  Well there 's a barrister that was in my class at Queen 's  What the hell did you call him  Roger Mc  Roger McNamara was it  I 'm not sure  I can't remember  nice enough fella  no social skills I don't think  He 's one of these very  just so  you know big would be coming  walking with his striped umbrella and oh Sarah  Did you ever get into the Institute kind of look  laughter  So I met him  Wait til you hear this right  I met him uhm in the High Court  And this can't be that long ago cos it was the time I was doing that absolutely pish  2 sylls  petition  It was the bane of my life  Oh that one  Right  So  and that 's was what  That must have been either  it must have been just after Christmas I met him  And he said uhm  something about where are you working now  And I said oh I 'm working in  Chapman and Hall  blah-de-blah  And he would be one that I would say you know I 'm working for whoever  Thanks Sally-Anne  Uhm and he 's all oh yes so uh yes you were you know a couple of years behind the rest of us going to the Institute weren't you  And I said yes but I actually worked in a smaller firm and it was invaluable  you know experience and actually it stood to me very well  Sure I always say things work out for a reason  I says so it worked out grand  So that was dead-on  Now I must make the point three or four weeks ago I was coming back from lunch you know up Queen Street so I was at those traffic lights opposite the Centra  and I saw him and I thought I can't be arsed talking to you  But he was waiting to cross the fucking lights as well  So I was standing with the mobile phone and all out  And I could see him like going  you know  looking like this just to make sure it was me  Sarah  Och Roger how are you doing  And you were coming across so sort of  you know  as if you weren't really  trying to ignore  him  Genuine    several sylls  Hello  Uh I haven't just just been looking at you for the last ten minutes  Now wait  This was a classic  How are things going Sarah  I said things are going very well Roger  What about yourself  He says oh I 'm just off to buy a leather jacket  I said oh very good  Are you still at  Chapman and Hall  I said I am  He says yes I think the last time I was speaking to you you were training  I said eight months ago  I said I 've now been qualified for three years and in fact actually I 've just been promoted  laughter  I thought you bastard  You  real stuck up  So I mean I wouldn't be a bit behind the door in that sort of thing  Mm   You should say something like are you still doing really low-quality bar work    Bastard  Exactly  What a git  Well  how stupid  You 'll never instruct him  Well  exactly   Precisely   So then we were crossing the road at this stage and he says yes I 'm just going to buy  He must have been going to Diesel or somewhere to look at this leather jacket  He said I 've decided you know I may go get in with the fashion and uh  something about trendy anyway  I said listen Roger  it takes a hell of a lot more than a leather jacket to make somebody trendy  Ooh   Ooh   Ooh  laughter   Now I 'm not  I wasn't    it takes a hell of a lot more than a leather jacket but sure keep going and see how you get on  Claws out
