<S2A-027 Business law>  Just to recap on Tuesday night  we had a look at our sources of finance  Remember we went through our grants  We went through uhm borrowing  different sources of borrowing  grants uhm and loans and things like that  And then we looked at uhm alternative sources of funding as well  I want to carry on tonight  Uhm and the first thing I want to do is look at the legal aspects of running a business  looking at some of the uhm  legislation that 's involved some of the licences and whatever that you may or may not need to be compliant with  So before we do that I want to have a look at uhm the different types of businesses there are  You have sole trader partnership and limited company  Any limited companies here  Anybody thinking of setting up as a limited company  Not sure  Not sure at the moment  Uhm well we 'll have a look at the difference between sole trader partnership and limited companies  So if you 'd like to take one in turn to pass them round  handouts given out  Sole trader  I would imagine most of you bar the partnerships most of you will probably set up and just trade as a sole trader  Sole trader does not mean that you 're a one-man band  A sole trader is someone in business on his or her own account and who is self-employed  They may or may not employ other people  Sole trader route is often the most appropriate when the business is very small and not expected to grow much  Setting up as a sole trader is perhaps the simplest way of entering into business  From a legal point of view there is nothing you have to do to set up in business  and therefore there 's no costs really  So the advantages are  obviously it 's easy to set up  no legal formalities and therefore no cost  You have total control of the business  Uhm you 're taxed as an individual  that 's not strictly true because you 're actually  you would take will take your drawings from the business every month or every week  and you 're actually taxed uhm at the end of the year so you don't operate PAYE  right the way most employed people do  Uhm so what 'll happen is you will take your drawings every week or every month from the business and you don't pay tax on that  But at the end of the year the business is taxed on its profitability and that profitability will include your drawings figure  you 're actually taxed then as a business  and taxed in a lump sum at the end of the year rather than throughout the year  Alright do you understand  Uhm your accounts do not have to be is that right Shane just before I move on  laughter  Ah no that 's dead-on  Spot-on yeah   Yeah yeah  Thank-you  laughter  Just to keep me right there  Uhm accounts do not have to be disclosed to the public therefore your business remains confidential  The accounts of the business and  2 sylls  and the maintenance are not governed by legal regulations nor an annual audit required  Therefore your accountant 's fees should be lower  which is true  Uhm I mean my first year second year of trading I was a sole trader  Last year we became a limited company  And I 'm dreading the bill that we 're going to get this year compared to last year  Uhm the business is easy to wind up  So again folks you could get up some morning and think no  I don't want to uhm be in business any more  You can pull the plug relatively easily  And again as a proprietor when you draw cash from the business there 's no need to operate PAYE  Everybody 's familiar with the term PAYE Pay As You Earn  Uhm although the Inland Revenue does catch up with you at a later date  So it does pay to you know try and set money aside every month  Losses from the business can be offset against other income and even used to reclaim PAYE paid in previous years  So if all of you are in paid employment at the moment you go off you set up uh uhm as a sole trader you find your first year that you 've maybe made a slight loss in the business which you know it 's is perfectly fine uhm the chances are that you can actually reclaim tax that you have paid through previous employment  You get a tax rebate  And again it 's a fairly easy procedure to turn the business into a limited company at a later date  Uhm as I say we had to become a limited company because one of our customers had stipulated uhm as part of the  contract that we had to become a limited company  and it was quite easy  I mean we got the accountant to sort it out  But it is  very easy procedure to do  Some of the disadvantages are that you 're totally responsible and liable for all business losses  So if the business goes bankrupt so do you  uhm and your creditors will be entitled to seize your personal as well as your business possessions  which is very sad  In effect you are the business  Okay you will find on your chequebooks that it will be your name trading as your business name  So you are the business in effect  Transferring ownership of the business at any stage for example to family members may be more difficult than if they if this were a limited company  And that 's simply because with a limited company you get shares allocated  Okay so it 's everything is very much black and white  Uhm and everybody knows where they stand whereas with uhm sole trader or partnership it 's all very grey  You know it 's all sort of gentleman 's agreement and and whatever  So sometimes it can become more difficult to introduce new partners or you know to  to hand over ownership to somebody else  And again if you wish to expand your business it may be unwise to remain sole proprietor for long as this could inhibit  business growth  As well it can life can be lonely without a partner or fellow director  And again income tax is payable on profits not on the amount withdrawn by the proprietor  And this can be disadvantageous if profits are high enough to attract personal income tax at a higher rate  So that 's some of the advantages and the disadvantages  of uhm sole trader  I 'm going to look at partnership  Partnership is legally the same as sole trader so as a partnership you actually operate the business the same as you would if you were a sole trader  except that two or more people are the proprietors instead of one  A business partnership normally comprises between two and twenty people trading together as one firm and sharing in the profits  And as well as sharing the profits each partner shares unlimited liability for all debts and obligations of the firm and is responsible for the liabilities of his fellow partner or partners as well as his own  That 's the big thing folks  With partnership  with partnerships uhm not only are you liable for your own business debt but also those of your partners  laughter  which is very scary  And I I have seen it happen on several occasions where maybe partners have absconded  They 've ran off and they 've left one person to carry all of the debt  And that person would be responsible not for the debt that he 's in uhm incurred through the business but also the debt that the other partners have incurred through the business as well  So it 's very very scary  although a partnership may  partnership may be entered into without any legal formalities the Partnership Act of nineteen-eighty will be taken to be the partnership agreement unless the partners draw up a separate deed  It is advisable to have some kind of agreement drawn up by your accountant or a solicitor  But the partnership agreement is there to protect you your friendship and your business  It 's really important folks and I 'm sure Shane you would stress to the others that it is really really important to get a partnership agreement drawn up  that all of you know exactly where you stand  And if something should happen and you know you decide to go your separate ways well at least you know your partnership agreement is there to protect you all  protect you and protect the business  Alright so it is important  It 's not that expensive  I mean it 's less than two hundred pounds do you know to get a good partnership agreement drawn up  Alright  A definite must  Uhm some of the advantages  Again very similar to being a sole trader  It 's a good way  first thing is  is that it 's a good way of pooling complementary skills obviously  And I 'm sure all of you you know would agree that you complement each other in in some way  Uhm it 's a good way of starting a business that requires more capital than you have at your disposal  Uhm it can help share the workload and pressures associated with running a small business  Partnerships may be formed quite easily although a comprehensive agreement is a must  And again all of the advantages which relate to sole trader regarding accounts losses PAYE and alteration of legal form also apply to partnership  Risks and liabilities are shared  And again I suppose the obvious one there is that life is less lonely  in a partnership  You know you 've got somebody there to bounce idea  off and and talk to  laughter  you 're laughing uhm and talk things through  Some of the  disadvantages are that each partner is responsible for all business debts even those incurred by another partner  There 's some legal costs involved in drawing up a partnership agreement although it 's not very much  The profits have to be shared as well folks  which is always a downside  Uhm there 's always the risk of a personality clash and incompatibility  Uhm and it says here business partners should be chosen as seriously as marriage ones  And uhm certainly again I 've seen it folks  You know I have seen it with my own eyes where business partnerships have gone awry you know usually within the first year uhm where you know with the best will in the world three people or two people set out you know with the same idea and very very quickly you know they sort of realise well maybe one partner 's not pulling their weight or you know that they have very different visions for the business  and it 's really important that you sit down you know and talk things through uhm right from the beginning you know and realise what the implications are you know that that doesn't happen  coughs  Excuse me  The death or bankruptcy of any one partner unless there 're other  arrangements to the contrary will automatically dissolve the partnership  So again another good reason why you would actually have a partnership agreement in place  It can be difficult to expand the business by introducing new partners  and problems that relate to sole trader uhm to transferring ownership and income tax being payable on profits also apply to partnerships  Lenders prefer limited company structure to cover risk  sometimes not necessarily  Uhm there 's also folks there a limited liability partnership  I don't know Shane if you know if this is in existence in Northern Ireland or if you 've heard of  We don't see  3 sylls  have liability partnerships now  Do they   Yes  basically after all the  several sylls  American firms  several sylls  now  while there 's still partnership  several sylls   Yeah   I mean it is good in that a limited  I wasn't sure whether it had come to Northern Ireland yet or not  I know there was some people said it had and some people you know weren't quite sure  Uhm but certainly limited liability will give you the protection in that it limits your liability towards the  responsibi  what uhm with the responsibility of your partners  But you you still have the benefits of trading as uhm a a partnership  Okay so it might be again something that you maybe think about going down the road of getting a limited uhm limited liability partnership rather than just an ordinary partnership  There 's a couple of web addresses there as well at the bottom if you want to to investigate further  And the final one is limited company  The main point which distinguishes a limited company from other forms of business is that it is regarded as a separate legal entity from the people who own and run it  It is treated as if it were a separate person  So once once my company became limited uhm I was no longer the business in effect  It was no longer Jan Todd trading as IMS on the chequebook  Uhm the company was formed and I then became an employee of that that company 's okay albeit a director but I was then became an employee
