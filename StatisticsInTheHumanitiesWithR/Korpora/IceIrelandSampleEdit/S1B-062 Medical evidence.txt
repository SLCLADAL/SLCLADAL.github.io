<S1B-062 Medical evidence>  Dr Early  Take the Bible in your right hand please and repeat after me  I swear by Almighty God   I swear by Almighty God   That my evidence to the courts   That my evidence to the courts   Shall be the truth   Shall be the truth   The whole truth   The whole truth   And nothing but the truth   And nothing but the truth   State your full name please  Dr Daniel John Early   I 'm handing up to Your Lordship two medical reports by Dr Early  the first dated October seventeenth nineteen ninety-four  the second  September nineteenth nineteen ninety-six  Dr Early will you outline to His Lordship your qualifications and position  I 'm a consultant dermatologist at Craigavon Area Hospital  My qualifications are  Doctor of Medicine and Member of the Royal College of Physicians of London  Now you first examined uh the plaintiff on the fourteenth of October nineteen ninety-four  Is that correct  That is correct  And you ascertained that  you took a history from the plaintiff at that stage  Is that right  That is correct  Could you outline the  several words   You uh reached a diagnosis on the basis of the history taken and your examination of the plaintiff uh at that time  isn't that right Doctor  That is correct  And what was the diagnosis  I felt that he had a  contact dermatitis affecting his hands and forearms  And were you able to attribute that to anything in particular at that time  I thought it was most likely due to uh the wetness  the continuous wetness at work  but also uh possibly due to the  irritan  irritancy of the plasticised PVC paste and uh methylated spirits  How serious was the rash at the time that you examined him initially  It seemed to be quite bad at the time when I saw him in October uh nineteen ninety-four  Uh he had a lot of eczematous dermatitis affecting several fingers  Some of the fingers had deep fissures or cuts in them uh which were making uh bending of the fingers difficult  It was worse on the right hand than on the left hand   Now you re-examined on the thirteenth of September nineteen ninety-six  Is that correct  That is correct  And at that time  on examination uh what did you find  His rash appeared to be much less at that stage  uhm he had some eczematous dermatitis on the sides of his right middle finger  and some on the sides of the left little finger  and the web space between the right ring  right forefinger and middle finger  Otherwise the skin was was uh quite normal  Now at the time of your uh initial inspection you  didn't have access to the plaintiff 's General Practitioner 's notes  Is that correct  Apart from uh referral letters to the Craigavon Area Hospital where I work  Now you you had the entire uh General Practitioner 's notes by the time that you examined on the second occasion  That is correct  And did anything arise from those which had a bearing on your diagnosis and your what your consideration of the plaintiff 's condition  Uhm it was quite clear that Mr Mallory had attended his General Practitioner on a number of occasions with rash on his forearms and hands and uh the General Practitioner had also considered this to be possibly work-related   There was reference in the General Practitioner 's notes to uh other skin uh related problems  That is right  Uhm in I think August nineteen ninety-three he appeared to have a rash on his scalp  Uhm no diagnosis was made by the General Practitioner and he was referred on to Craigavon Area Hospital  And what diagnosis was made there  They made a diagnosis of this being psoriasis affecting his scalp  Did you reach any view as regards that uh that rash and that diagnosis  Uh according to the hospital notes he was reviewed once afterwards uh and the rash on his scalp had improved well  Uhm I can only presume that he may have had psoriasis on the scalp  I personally didn't see it myself   Did it have any bearing on your uh diagnosis of a contact irritant dermatitis caused by substances in work  I don't think the fact that he had psoriasis on his scalp would uhm influence the fact that he could have had an irritant contact dermatitis on his hands  In other words  a separate condition  There were  there was another uh reference in relation to a skin problem uh round about the same time in nineteen ninety-three  Is that correct  I don't think that appears in the General Practitioner notes   Will you just look at your your General Practitioner paragraph A of the General Practitioner 's notes in your second report   And we 're we 're referring to what date  That 's your report of  Sorry what date for the General Practitioner  November twenty-ninth nineteen ninety-three  The reference is Dr Stack  who 's a colleague   3 sylls   at Craigavon Hospital  That 's right   She 's a an associate specialist at Craigavon Area Hospital uh where he had attended with his scalp rash and his hand rash  Now in relation to the scalp rash and hand rash again was that the same attendance  Both were uhm  both were mentioned at the at the first attendance with Dr Stack  Then there 's the second  that first attendance is the twenty-seventh of September nineteen  ninety-three  The plaintiff 's second attendance was November twenty-ninth nineteen ninety-three  That is correct  And what was what was that in relation to  That again uh was a review appointment uh by Dr Stack  She felt that the uh scalp uh psoriasis had cleared well  In fact she said it  cleared  complet  completely  Uhm but at this stage he  uh Mr Mallory was complaining of  or was noted to have scattered eczema on his body  Now there 's reference to that being attributable to using a a perfumed body spray  That is correct  Would that have a bearing on your diagnosis of contact irritant dermatitis especially on the hand  Uh it is difficult to know exactly what was being  what was uh causing this this eczema on his body  I really don't know what this was  Uh he does not appear subsequently on patch testing to be allergic to perfume but I couldn't rule that out  Uh it may be that he is more likely to develop eczema because he has what is known as an atopic tendency  that is he also suffers from asthma   If he does suffer from asthma would that have any bearing on his uh potential for uh contracting a condition such as uh dermatitis  That 's most certainly would have uh an influence  It is well recognised that people who suffer from asthma or hay fever or who have had a past history of eczema are more likely to develop uh contact dermatitis  especially of the irritant type when put in work with skin irritants or wet work   Now at the time that you carried out your uh second examination and prepared the second report you had the benefit of seeing the safety data sheet which had been furnished by the defendant  Is that correct  That is correct  Now these show that the the plaintiff was in uh contact with a number of substances  First of all  methylated spirits  Would methylated spirits be a substance which could cause uh skin problems  Uh  methyla  methylated spirits uh is basically alcohol which would de-fat skin and make it much more likely to develop irritant contact dermatitis  or to even cause it in the first place   What would be the usual way to protect the the user of methylated spirits from uh contracting dermatitis  To wear gloves   Now you also uh had access to the safety data sheet in respect of the plastic paste  Is that right  That is correct  Was there any reference there to their effect on the skin  Yes the data sheet indicated that the  plastici  the plasticiser or PVC was a mild irritant on the skin  and if there was uh skin contact that uh it should be washed off with large amounts of soap and water  It is also suggested in these data sheets that  neopre  neoprene gloves should be worn while working with this substance   Now they 're described as mildly irritant on the skin  That is correct  ho  can you uh describe to or explain to His Lordship how a mild irritant would cause skin trouble  clears throat  Irritant contact dermatitis uh is caused often by the accumulative effect of a number of uh agents acting on the skin over fairly protracted uh periods of time  I would see the irritants here as being firstly wetness at work  uh also the  plasticise  plasticised PVC paste and DIP moulding materials  and also methylated spirits to be cumulative in their effect against the skin  I wouldn't attribute this rash to any particular one of those agents but to the cumulative effect of all of them   The plaintiff uh says that he still  or would say that he still suffers from flare-ups from the rash even now that he 's been moved to a clean dry job  Can you explain that  Uhm once uh hand eczema or irritant contact dermatitis has been established  it is well recognised that flare-ups can occur  often for no good and apparent reason for between nine and eighteen months  after the person is removed from the source of the irritant   What would be the prognosis in this case  I think the prognosis uh generally would be good uhm if this gentleman was removed from wet work  work with skin irritants and potential skin allergens  I think with time his hands should settle back to normal  uh and he  if he was not placed in a similar position would uh  his hands would would revert to normal   Finally the plaintiff was patch tested uhm to see if he was allergic to the substances and this all turned out to be negative  Uh patch testing to all of these substances uh was negative  indicating that he was not or did not seem to be allergic to any of them  I haven't really had an opportunity to read the reports in detail  I 'd quite like to have that opportunity  Uhm so if you would leave further  3 sylls  until after lunch  Yes indeed  Could I ask My Lord  uhm Dr McGillen  several sylls   Yes indeed  I 'd be much obliged
