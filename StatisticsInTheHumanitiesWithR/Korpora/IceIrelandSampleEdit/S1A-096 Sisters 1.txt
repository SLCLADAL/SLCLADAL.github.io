arrangement the girl next door  who who  was to be babysitting for someone else I think cancelled it  And  Oh right   Oh right so she didn't really  need   She said  she was  you know  appreciative

 Yeah I  mean I 've  He 'd probably be fine but she 's just  He probably would but I 'm not in the humour  for any aggravation you know   Yeah I mean Danny  was coming to me that young   Was he

dark-haired  Hmm hmm  And  what about poor Alison  Nobody  So   Alison has nobody on the scene  you know  She 's kind of  she came up here this morning with with Con  because Jennie wanted  was with your man  And  Jennie asked her to take her out for a walk so Allie looked not too hot I thought  She was very kind of  puffy and  her  skin is not so great at the moment  Hmm   Yeah   Yeah   Is it not  Yeah  She looked very tired and  that  but she 's in good enough form  you know  So I don't  I think she 's just going out with some friend  tonight   Yeah   Yeah yeah   Right   You 're not going out yourself  No we 're not  We never do  No we 'll have  sweet Daniel here and  Oh right he 's not socialising either  He 's not this year no no  But we had a little incident with him  Really  Uhm him and  hash right  We have  moved into a delightful and charming new phase  which  I anticipate with leaping heart and  great glee   Are you serious   Oh no   Yeah  how did that come about then  Well just  some some incident happened with Johnny  You know his friend  Johnny  And and  I don't know  He told this to Lara and Lara let it out to Mike  Lara 's a great one for finding these things out and  then kind of saying I 'll tell on you yeah  And they were out somewhere and they  he ate it  John ate it   Right  You can eat it apparently or smoke it  And got into such a state that Danny went out to the phone box and rang Eugene and said I think John is getting the flu  You 'd better come and get him  Hmm   Yeah spilling the beans yeah   Hmm   And where were they  I wasn't really sure  It was all vague  Now I heard  this  the day before yesterday from Mike  Yeah    Who said this thing about John   So that night Danny was going up to stay in John 's and as he was getting out of the car  I said I heard about that incident with the with the dope  I said don't you take anything off him  And his face got really red   I thought oh God  So yesterday when he he came back he said what were you saying to me about John  So  I said I heard about that thing  And his face was really red  And I said did you take any and he said yes  And I said where did you get it  Oh a fella bought it  A fella bought it  And I said  was the fella you  Yes  Yeah yeah   Hmm   Was the fella what  and it was  A fella  A fella  he said  some fella got it and the fella turned out to be him  But  he had gone up to this school in Knocknacarra where if you hang around outside  you 'll get you 'll buy it  Now that I look on as very serious  I mean  getting  a bit off someone is one thing but going  out  Now he had the twenty pounds from you and he had twenty pounds from Mike so he was whizzing around with all this dosh  Hmm   Good Lord   Yeah   Yeah yeah  So I was really annoyed about this  And I gave out stink to him and said he was not to do that again  And he was saying but it 's not as bad as drink and when will you let me  And  And what did he do  Smoke it  Ate it  I said what  what effect  Oh I was just giggling  But he 's bloody bad enough in  the normal state but uh doped  good night  I know at fourteen  sigh  So anyway I said it uhm  I know yeah cos he 's very young to be   At least he admitted it  told you   At least  he admitted it yeah  And then he  kept saying when are you going to let me  I mean the naivety of  mammy  handing and saying now son have your hash  But uhm   Yeah yeah yeah yeah   did you not say  look at Enda  the state of him  with his mind gone  Would it yeah  at that age it does   Oh that would roll off him  You know it doesn't affect most people like  that  Yeah I mean he was just saying  and I was saying you could be getting anything  You haven't a clue what it is  Yeah  So anyway I said it to Jennie and I said do you think that Mike knows he took it and bought it  And she said oh he probably does  And I said do you think he 'd mind  And she said no   any  anyway I decided that I 'd  I I sort of said that to to Ben and I said I 'm not even going to bother ringing him because I you  know I feel he looks on me as old granny  What   God I 'd say he 'd have to do  several sylls   sa  and Ben said look don't be taking what she says  Ring him   I rang him  He did not know and was  most annoyed  So I said well it 's it 's I he  we need to know  He needs to know that we 're both watching him
