<S1B-013 Industrial policy 1>  Uh question three on on Michaelmas term of last year just as a matter of interest there  was uhm  or question four was  evaluate the impact of foreign firms with respect to employment in industrial regions  Now the last day we did the first  uhm we did the questions prior to that about the cause of regional inequalities and whether or not there was a case for regional intervention and uhm  we did some stuff on uhm capital bias and regional bias but you know I think I want to focus on this business of the performance uh of foreign firms and the impact of it  who will start the ball rolling  John what about yourself  I know you have the figures there in front of you  But if I put up the figures first of all  I can put the figures on the slide  and you 'll have a  an impression of them for those of you who haven't got it there  The first slide basically shows uhm  several words  moves OHP  Is it visible at all there  Yeah  Is that okay  Reasonably okay  You have the handout somewhere  You should have the handout down in your notes if you haven't got it there  Basically what slide number one is showing is the distribution of both indigenous and foreign firms in Ireland  Really it 's probably easiest to focus on the summary at the bottom of the page  Uh you recall that we divided the country into western periphery and so-called eastern core  Uh the western periphery being the sort of half-way down the the centre of the map which you have also  and the eastern core being the northeast the  the uhm southeast  Now I think you can use these figures here to answer that question about the impact of foreign firms with respect first of all to employment anyway  So Tom do you want to start the ball rolling  how would you tackle that  well to start with you 'd have to agree with the fact  several sylls  agree with anything  You 'd have to state the fact that foreign firms as it were create more jobs  several sylls  and have consistently done so from nineteen seventy-three to eighty-nine and you could back it up with figures that you 've given us two on the two tables  in comparing the foremost indigenous with foreign firms you could say that the Irish firms as a rule have lost out  But you could counteract that  counteract that by saying the uhm grant system the grant scheme is geared more for foreign industries  multinationals than it is for indigenous industries as a rule  indigen  indigenous industries that exist tend to have been  1 syll  more traditional  They were older and as a result they have lost out through technology and time  Yeah  And consequentially they 've they 've had to  1 syll   But if you were answering the question now would you be more specific  could you  would you be able to be more specific about it  I don't imagine you 'll remember all  all the figures but would you be able to remember any particular figures from the table  Supposing you 're chatting your friend in the buttery this evening or trying to impress your girlfriend about uhm your knowledge  trying to set up an alliance for the future  you 'd like to explain to her that you know so much about uh industrial policy and the impact of it now uhm  Well for the foreign firms  More detail more specific  Right foreign firms just to take the total here have a gain of basically sixty-two thousand jobs in the region of between seventy-three and eighty  and they 've made a loss of twenty-seven thousand  In comparison the Irish firms made a gain of eighty thousand and lost seventy-two thousand so there 's a net change in value there of nine  Are these these ones here  Is that what you 're talking about  I 'm talking about the seventy-three to eighty  Seventy-three to eighty okay  Gains and losses  That one there  Okay yes  The net change  Yeah  No they 're the Irish  Right  And the foreigners  there is a gain  So it 's three times as much  The foreigners are basically creating three times as many jobs  Okay  In the same period in nineteen seventy-three to eighty when granted there was  the economic times during seventy-three to eighty were really poor  Okay right  So you 're  that 's the  unusual  that 's the unusually good time  Yeah  Does uhm  Any any comments on that  Jamie  I 'd be pretty much in full agreement with that one  Yeah  several sylls   Are you familiar with that data  I am familiar with the data  Yeah  Well would you care to comment on the later period  Or any   The uh eighty-two   There for eighty-one now to  eighty-nine   Eighty-nine  right  Well in that period we can clearly see that there 's a  a net change in uh Irish firms  There 's a loss of uhm thirty-seven thousand jobs  a net net loss  whereas with the foreign firms there has been a net gain of a hundred and seventy-nine thousand  Hold on now  Sorry simultaneous unclear   You 've lost me simultaneous unclear   There 's something wrong there  Just it it is just uh turn this thing out  yeah  several sylls  Other way Derek  $A moves slide  That 's better  Okay sorry about that  And we can see that overall there 's been a net loss for Irish firms of uhm thirty-seven thousand jobs in the period whereas the uhm foreign firms only lost three thousand jobs  So obviously they fared relatively better so it 's been a difficult period as a whole  The foreign firms due to you know better competitors and whatnot have succeeded  Not succeeded  have fared better in terms of losing less jobs in what was obviously a difficult period  Okay  I just think the eighty-six  several sylls  the amount of jobs  several sylls  the eighty-six  several sylls  diversified the uhm grant structure  you know  which I think would hit Irish firms more so than the multinationals because they will have the capital anyway  several sylls   Is there anything else though  you 're talking about there the actual volume of numbers now  What about this business of uh regional dispersal  Would anybody care to comment on that  Have the multinationals an impact in dispersing jobs to certain regions  Somebody else somebody else from the people who spoke on that  Who 's going to comment on that  Young ladies present  Just that the multinationals  several sylls  industry throughout Ireland  several sylls   Okay be more specific now   Can you use the data to  to you know be a bit more explicit than saying that multinationals you know dispersed more widely  uh  well three had uh three  several sylls   Go to table eight three  Go to table eight three and four  They 're the two best tables I think  Eight three and four  You should be able to draw conclusions about the dispersal from those and look perhaps at the uhm  at the summary  down at the bottom  the summary of the western periphery and the eastern core  Here  Yeah  So you 're saying there 's a net change of  of minus ten thousand jobs  Irish jobs  several sylls  in the western core and then minus twenty-seven thousand in the east  And you and you go to table eight three first  Yeah  to fieldworker  Are you picking up the sound of the voices do you think sufficiently  Yes  thanks   Go to table eight three first and what would your conclusion be now  Uhm  I 'm trying to get you to be more specific about the regional dispersal of these jobs  Uh well if you 're looking  if the policy aim was to get them to disperse into the western region  Irish firms have a net increase of six thousand two hundred and ten jobs  Right  several sylls   Right  Foreign firms have net change of eighteen thousand  Correct  So the foreign firms really would appear to have had a much greater uh dispersal into the regions  Yeah  And even  what about the eastern core then  Uhm the eastern core from Irish firms had an increase of four thousand nine hundred and foreign firms twenty thousand  Yeah so they are three times better in all parts of the country really  And the same really that  this is really confirming what Tom said earlier really that  however you assess them they seem  whether it 's in terms of jobs themselves or in terms of regional dispersal  they would appear to be doing much better than the Irish firms  Take the eighty-one to eighty-nine period  Would somebody else comment on that now  Eighty-one to eighty-nine period uhm  simultaneous and unclear  This is eighty-one to eighty-nine now  I don't  I think you 're going to have to really study these figures in a bit more detail  Because if you 're to answer that sort of question  it 's not enough to simply say well look foreign firms had an enormous impact and they they dispersed jobs into the regions  That 's not enough really  You have to be much more specific and and give precise evidence for your position  Just as a matter of interest in an exam situation I always feel that  several sylls   No you won't have tables but I mean there are  there 's a small amount of key elements that you should be able to take out of the table I think  to to bolster up your position  Would it be necessary to actually quote figures or would it just be more of a a general ideas of proportions you know  Like if we were saying say  there would you have to quote say the exact figures relating to how many people foreign firms uh were employing on the eastern seaboard or would it just be better to say the uhm that the the Irish firms employ twice as many as the foreign firms or would you actually be looking for figures  Uhm well I think it would help  It would help to give some sort  I mean twice as many could be three as opposed to one and a half you know  It would be useful to have some indication of  several sylls   Of the total numbers  Now the total numbers are not that difficult it seems to me there  I mean this is early on in Michaelmas term right  With respect  the Regional Industrial Policy exams in the summer are only two exams in less than five days ' time  So the idea of studying these figures for summer  Yeah  It 's a bit  Oh it 's a long way ahead  Cos it 's a long way ahead  You 'll have to forgive our lack of acuity at the moment you know  Relatively speaking at the moment our concentration  4 sylls   Well you 're on to other things at the moment simultaneous and unclear   I know and I assume you 're doing your forty hours ' a week study at this stage  At the very minimum yeah laughter   See Jeff is a  Jeff is  he and I you know have often tutored together and we we always said to students twenty hours a week of lectures and classes and twenty hours of study and and serious study  Not talking to girls or boys during these periods  What are you doing at the moment  Are you doing   We 've uh MIS on uh Monday  several sylls   Okay well then I 'm being entirely miserable and I 'm sorry uh to to introduce this uhm this detailed data  No okay well we needn't  obviously I don't expect at this stage that you would but I think  I 'm trying to make the point though that  if you 're going to adopt a position uh you really do need data  and at least in the dim and distant future you will have to  We we know the trends at the moment and then like a few days before the exam we well we can sort of actually learn the figures  several sylls   So is it is it  a case of where like where trends gets you kind of a low two two whereas you know the numbers you get a two one  like that  laughter  simultaneous and unclear   At the end of the day I 'm not very interested in examinations to be honest with you  And neither am I interested in indoctrinating you to particular points that you  I suppose I 'm trying to raise consciousness about uhm the issues and at the end of the day I have said many many times now so far  that you are the people who must draw the judgements  The exam I mean  I don't think the exams are are important really  Uhm  they are well they are important from your point of view I suppose they are  the vast majority of people doing uhm Regional Industrial Policy do relatively well  I think  So I don't think that should be the focus of your attention  Rather it 's the material and whether you can be interested in it and whether you can relate to it  whether eventually perhaps you can influence change  Maybe that 's the really important issue  It 's a matter of being fairly critical of it and rather than making a very general statement to say well you know foreign companies are  Because there is a perception that foreign firms are bad news  I 've had that uh feeling myself for many years that well  all these multinationals are really bad news  They come into Ireland and other countries  especially less developed countries  and they uhm they milk the place of its of its grants and so on and its tax incentives and then when the going gets rough they leave  But when I  I did research on this thing and that that those tables I 've given you are based on some of that research  uh I did have to change my mind and at least I had to recognise that multinationals were you know creating quite a lot of jobs
