<S2A-038 Geography lecture>  I just wanted you to have the correct equation  I know you 're not going to be doing anything in particular with it but  That 's very uhm  it 's kind of hard to see is it  And for those of you who are not familiar with this symbol  that 's the partial differential  It 's like DY DX  Okay for those of you who 've done that  It means the change in something  It means a partial derivative  I just wanted to do that because I didn't want you to have something that was all wrong in your notes  People who just came in this is the correction for that temperature equation that I gave you two lectures ago  So you can write it down correctly and put it back in where the other one is  and do what you like with it after that  we finished up talking the last day about the actual mechanics  I 'm sorry I 'm just going to shut the door  several sylls  Of how  the mechanics of how the GCM works  And today we 're going to look a little bit at the results of those GCM  simulations  You 'll remember that the way it 's done is that we run a controlled simulation  is a simulation of the climate unperturbed more or less as it is now supposedly  and then we run a perturbation simulation  So we have a control and a perturbation  And in our case the perturbation simulation we 're going to be looking at is the double carbon dioxide simulation  And once you have those two then you compare them to see what you think is going to happen  the results from the different GCMs produce different temperature changes  So let 's have a quick look at just the temperature change which would be  you subtract the control from the perturbation and find the difference  Okay so say your control temperature for the grid box around Cork was about  you know  say an average of ten degrees centigrade for the year  And in your perturbation run for that particular grid point let 's say the temperature was twelve degrees centigrade for the year  Then you have a difference of two degrees  And what you 're looking at is that difference  So now we 're going to look at that average difference for the globe  for a number of different GCMs  Now the way this graph is made up is that these  each dot represents a simulation  a perturbation simulation  These dots are for only halving the carbon dioxide  So they also do perturbation simulations in halved carbon dioxide  just to check and see  Cos it 's interesting  Even though we 're  we don't think that 's going to happen  But it 's interesting to see  to see if the opposite happens to what we expect for a doubling  Okay so it 's a kind of a cross check  These are all the simulations that 'll run for doubled carbon dioxide  There were quite a number run for four times carbon dioxide even though we don't expect that to happen any time soon  And there were just a few done for ten times the carbon dioxide levels we now have  which we obviously don't expect either but  just for  again to learn more about how it works  we will do these very extreme kinds of simulations  These three categories are  energy balance model  radiator convective model  and uhm  global climate model  which are the three types of model we talked about before  Now we 're only going to be really looking at the global climate model results  So if we look at the doubled carbon dioxide which I 've highlighted there in purple  which is where the bulk of the  the simulations the bulk of the experiments have been made  You can see then on the Y axis on the vertical  the change in temperature that those simulations forecast for the entire earth  So this is a mean rise in temperature  So anything below this line is for a cooling  and as you 'd expect  the ones where carbon dioxide was halved showed a cooling  Okay the exact opposite to what we expect for a doubling  The ones where they were doubled showed a rise in temperature anywhere there between zero and up to what 's the highest one there nine point two  nine point five  Four times you can see that they 're a bit higher up  Ten times is very odd they 're scattered but there were only three of them and they were done very early on  with not very sophisticated models  And as you can see there 's only one for each type of model as well so it 's not a lot to be said about that  Let 's come back to these ones  You can see that the range  for the energy balance models which are the very simple ones that don't include clouds and don't include moisture  don't include all the feedback mechanisms which are very important  had very extreme values  right up to nearly ten degrees increase for doubled carbon dioxide  But when you come to a more sophisticated model like the radiator convective model  or even more sophisticated to the to the global climate model  and once you have all of the feedbacks that we 've talked about  coming in to the equation you can see that there 's a much smaller rise in temperature  Okay so the energy balance model is only looking at energy balance  It doesn't look at incoming radiation outgoing radiation no clouds no nothing  Okay whereas here we 're looking at the influence of clouds and you can see that the range is from a very tiny increase up to about five degrees  Okay these are what the GCMs produce  So there 's quite a range of  changes in temperature for a doubling of carbon dioxide  Now since this uh work has been done the  that this graph is based on  you can see that a lot of these are quite early they go up to the last one was about nineteen eighty-three  There have been more experiments done since then and it has narrowed the gap somewhat but it is still very variable  Why then could this be variable  Well it 's for the reasons we talked about the last day  You have different kinds of parameterisations of the physics that are involved  different ways of producing clouds  different ways of dealing with all those sub-grid scale processes  that we really can't look at at a scale of you know five hundred kilometre boxes  And they all do it differently and  there 's really no best one  Like some will do convective clouds better  Those are  like uhm thunder clouds  which are very tall very narrow clouds and they 're very hard to do  And actually that that hasn't been done particularly well by anyone but  you know  some people have a better system for that  Others have a better system for stratus low-level cloud which is that like  you know  heavy low-level raincloud that you get  Some of them will do that very well  But none of them do everything very well  You know some of them will deal with ozone better  some of them will deal with something else better  So that 's why we get this variation in them and there really it really has not been narrowed down much more than that  So we have to just go with that  the experiments that I 'm going to be talking about in more detail today  are all  equilibrium change experiments  You 'll remember the last day we talked about uhm uhm equilibrium change and time dependent change  The equilibrium change is when you double the carbon dioxide  you let the model run  and then you see what the answer is at the end when it 's settled down  You don't look at what happens along  along the way because it 's not realistic anyway  because you 're doubling it instantaneously  So these are going to be all equilibrium change  Now you might well ask  why do they bother doing equilibrium change experiments when they 're not really that realistic  In fact they 're not realistic at all because you have an instantaneous doubling  of carbon dioxide whereas we know that it increases gradually  as people use more and more fossil fuels and so on  Well there are a number of reasons  The first reason is that it uses a lot less computer time  So this is computationally much more efficient  So less computer time  And that is the principal reason  A second reason is that they have compared  the results  from the equilibrium change experiments  and the results from the time dependent experiments  and they found that they can actually scale this answer  So say you 've got an answer of say five degree change for the globe  They can actually match that and say well that means that if would be  you know two and a half after so much time  three degrees after so much time  four degrees after so much time  by comparing it with a time dependent experiment  And so even though they don't run the time dependent experiment they can get  they can get a good rough idea of what the answer from it would be  from the equilibrium change experiment which is much much cheaper to run  so by scaling  we can approximate  to the time dependent experiment  They run very very few of those  because they 're so expensive computationally  The other one is that equilibrium change experiments give you one final answer  Okay for every point on the earth we have one temperature  one precipitation  one pressure  one humidity  and so it 's very easy to compare models  whereas if you 're looking at the time dependent ones it 's much much harder  because you have to compare them at all different times  as the carbon dioxide gradually increases  and the model how the model handles that  So in fact here we have ease of comparison between models  And so it 's also done for that reason  But actually  the real reason is this one  Okay the others are  the others look good but in fact this is the  this is the real real reason  This is why it 's not such a bad idea  but this is the real reason  Okay so that 's why they use these particular ones  We 're going to have a look then  at the kind of results they give us  Now the principal problems with the results we 're going to see  Oh I 'm sorry I shouldn't have moved that clip  several sylls  The principal problems with what we 're going to see  are related to the way in which the model is constructed  first of all  none of these have any chemical reactions in them  So in other words they 'll change the amount of carbon dioxide but they don't take into account other chemical changes that might happen as a result of that  You 'll remember all the different kinds of things we talked about earlier when we were talking about the different types of uhm  greenhouse gases and how they work and so on  You know  we talked about the hydroxyl radical  we talked about solvents  we talked about the whole pile of things  Okay so there 's no chemistry  so that 's obviously a disadvantage right away  Another disadvantage with them is that they only talk about carbon dioxide  The bulk of them don't deal with methane  They don't deal with CFCs  So that the radiation uhm  Changes in the radiation balance caused by the increase in greenhouse gases is done as if it was going to be entirely carbon dioxide  Okay so they don't take into account the others at all  And we saw that the others while they 're quite small can be quite significant because they 're so much stronger  Uhm the other one is that  su  there is also an increase in sulphur compounds in the atmosphere which we haven't talked about but we will be talking about later on  But they don't take those into account and they change the cloudiness  So cloud changes due to sulphur are not accounted for
