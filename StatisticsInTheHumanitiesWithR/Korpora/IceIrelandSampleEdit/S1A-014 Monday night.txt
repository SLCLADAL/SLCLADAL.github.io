Has he got stacks of  1 syll  Has he got money like   I don't  know   I mean  it 's not one of those glass escalators  It 's just  an iron box or something and  a piece of string  or something  No   No it 's just like a wooden   It 's like a wooden lift like  laughter   Sounds safe  It 's quite strange  Should get one of those things you know you get for oul pensioners like you fit on a banister and just sit in it  imitates sound  laughter  Just goes up the stairs  It 'd be mad  several sylls   What happens in his if it breaks down  You can't get  you can't  get up the  top floor   You just have to jump   You 'd have to scale  scaffolding like or something uh outside and climb up the window or something  Mm  So there you go  Well I paid for my flights yesterday  Did you  Yeah  How much was it  Three hundred pound  That 's not bad  Where 'd you get three hundred quid from   Three hundred pound straight to Israel   Cos I had  I 've saved seven hundred pound  But you 've been out on the flipping  I don't know  go out on the  piss  every day for about three months  Yeah   I know I have   I don't quite know  no do you know what 's happened as well cos the bank has given me  an extra  two hundred and fifty pound  last August or September  And I hadn't noticed  that they gave me it  laughter   Oh aye   Well hopefully  you 'll be away by the time they realise   Got a phone  Anybody got a phone  imitates dialling sound  Hello  This is the bank here  laughter   Is that three hundred quid straight to Israel from here  No it 's   was two  hundred no it 's two hundred and twenty from Gatwick and then  I haven't paid for to get over to London yet but then the rest of it was all insurance  And I wanted to get insured for going over to Egypt as well  cos  I want to go over there at some stage  You just go via   Yeah   How long are you going away for  A year  Yeah  A year spot-on like or  Well  Give or take a  few days   Hopefully  I mean I can't well if everything works out I I don't particularly want to come back anyway you know  I want to sort of try to get a job and stuff out there  You know   What  what would your ideal job be  Just doing anything no just doing anything  I mean even like hotel work or  just anything  that pays the rent  Doing bugger-all  several sylls    Is your job being kept open for you  Amazing  If I want to come back  it 'll be a real  laughter  it 'll be like  yeah the job 's and all is still there  even if I don't want to come back I can still renew it and then get another year  You can take up to five years  and still have your job when you  come back   Five years  If you haven't found another job within five years like there must be something  seriously wrong   Yeah I know  I know  Derek 's taking one as well  You were saying  And he 's going to Manchester  It 's just that I couldn't survive  He was going to take it in February and then I said  no way Derek  Don't leave and leave me here on my own you know  It 's a bit of a difference now from him going to Manchester and you going to a kibbutz in Israel like  Yeah but I mean uh  like I didn't want I didn't want him to bugger off and I 'd still be sitting in work  cos  that 's who I sort of like hang about with and stuff  and all   So   You 're  going to bugger off and leave him sitting in work  No cos he 's going exactly the same time as I am  Like will your job still be there when you if if you do come back   They can keep  it open for five years  if you  Yeah  Will they hold it for you   Seriously   I 'm actually still real if a person said  laughter  I 'll I 'll be able to do this job for a lifetime  2 sylls  whistles  5 sylls   Mm  I want to go away as well  when this  job ends  Yeah   Everybody wants to go away like but  But I can't believe like I 've actually  got it organised  I mean  that 's it  All I 've to get back now is like the tickets and  where I 'm going  and then that 's it   Mm   That 's handy  then  Do you know exactly whereabouts this kibbutz is  No you don't I don't know where it is yet   several sylls  Well I mean I can always  yeah  but   You don't know whether it 's like Tel Aviv or  or it could be Beirut   That 's  not in Israel  Is it not  But if it 's a really bad like area  There 's a fella I know in Tel Aviv and you 're under no obligation  to stay  in that kibbutz so he  his sister and her friend went out and he like  set them up in this really good kibbutz and stuff you know  Uhm it was one with swimming pools and  going  trekking and all  Most of them have swimming pools and  all that there   Aye   God   Sounds like  a holiday camp actually  It 's not a holiday camp  I mean you have to work like but  Who does the food and all go for like you  don't don't you isn't that what you do like tend crops and things   Yeah  Drive tractors   Who does the food go to  Does it just go for the people  that you 're going to be working with   It just goes to the people that are there  Yeah  So what 's the the purpose of it then  It 's a self-sufficient society  It 's just to give people a chance to  Live off the land  to like travel  I think that was like a major aspect in setting them up sort of thing  Very impressed  It 's not like religious or anything like that  It 's it 's not secular   Sure they 're going to try and convert you to Jews or   No  no there is ones  there is ones actually that uh  you know they 're set up so you can like learn the Jewish language and all this here and  about the history and all but  I don't don't think so now  Wouldn't fancy it  No I know
