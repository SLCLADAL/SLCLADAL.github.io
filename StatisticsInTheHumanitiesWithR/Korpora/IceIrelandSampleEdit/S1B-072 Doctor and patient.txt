<S1B-072 Doctor and patient>  Uh hello Mr McKenzie  I 'm Doctor McMaster  What can I do for you  Well I 've been to uh to the doctor a few times with this problem  Uh I was about about six months ago I was uh  previously before that about two years when I was doing karate  I uh hurt my right leg  well  I was trying I was trying to kick somebody I think it was  Uh I heard a snap  uh underneath my leg uh  just about in there  Right   Uh how long ago did you say  Two years  you see I was at a doctor six months ago  It had been two years before that  Right  I I went  oh about six weeks after that as it was very painful  Uh doctor told me that it was just a hamstring injury and that people basically got them all the time in sporting activity  and not to worry about it   Okay and  well uh what 's wrong with you now that you come up  Well uh uh another  another six months it didn't get any better  Uh I let it go and it started in colder weather possibly  it was very very sore uh walking up the street and what have you  It was   Your  knee or you leg  Uh in the back of my leg  Right  It 's as if there 's some tendon running down uh underneath  I don't know anything about it obviously but it 's I heard this big snap  But I can't feel anything wrong with my leg  That 's two years ago  That 's two years ago  I came back six months ago  uh and complained of the same uh injury  I was sent to the sports clinic  Uh  I got I got in there  I was  didn't get any help basically at all  Th  they seemed to ignore that I said snap  And actually it was quite funny cos the physiotherapist told me that one of my legs was a centimetre shorter than the other one  And she gave me a a bit of foam  white foam stuff to put in my shoe  She   Uh-huh   Uh  who told you this  It was one of the physiotherapists  Which leg was shorter  The right one  And she said it was it was  I  it was actually a problem with my lower back  It wasn't a problem with my leg  I tried to  pain in my leg   But I   What was what was in  in your legs  She said the pain in your leg was coming from your back  and that 's what she said   Yes she says  my my bottom back was very tight and that was the problem  And it wasn't my leg   You 've had the  pain now for two years haven't  you  And you were last seen six months ago  Yeah   Exactly  So she didn't really  understand that it it was actually I felt something snap in my leg  It wasn't in my lower back   What what   Wh  wh  what 's  actually wrong with you now that you 've come up today  I occasionally feel the pain when I 'm running  Or if I haven't exercised for a while  and I  playing a game of football or something I  uh get sharp pains uh in my legs  So   So is it is it getting worse or is just the fact that it hasn't gone away  It just hasn't gone away and it 's always there  whenever I it 's uh  The last time a few months a a  couple of weeks back  I was playing a game of football  and then I was just  1 syll  in the last minute  And I felt it the whole way through the game  Right so it 's it 's it hasn't actually been getting worse the last couple of days  No it 's it didn't get worse  It 's just that it hasn't gone away  and you 're just concerned   It hasn't gone away  yeah  And it all started two years ago  Nothing before then  Nothing before that time I I actually heard the snap  You 'd say it 's a sharp pain  It 's  very sharp   It is  Wh  where exactly is the pain  Well it 's it 's it 's well above the hamstring  It 's sort of it 's in there  Is it at the back of your leg  Yes at the very back of my leg  Does it move at all  It doesn't move no  It just stay in one place  Stays in the one  place   Does  it go down below the knee  No  Is there any pain in your back at all  No  And any pain in your knee itself  No pain  And it 's all just in the back of your leg  All at the  back of my leg   And  does it only come with movement or do you get it when you 're sitting down at rest  If I had 've been exercising for a while and I was sitting I would feel it for a few weeks after exercising   even sitting down  At times it would be constant and then at times I I forget about it or it wouldn't be  there  But I 'm always aware of it  always   Right and is it constant   Right   Okay  and uh does anything make it go away or anything make it worse  Just as I say exercise makes it  you know  3 sylls    And is there any  way you can get rid of it  Not exercising  not do anything with that leg after a while  til it totally disappears   And  do you 've any pain anywhere else at all in the other leg  No  Back  No  And no pain in your feet at all  No  Do you get any numbness at all or any   3 sylls    No   Not at all  Just one pain  Any weakness in your legs  No  Uh does your leg ever give way from you  No  And you 've no difficulty walking upstairs  No no  Or coming down the stairs  No  Okay and how about bending over or standing up  As a say uh uh possibly after exercising  you know I would feel it more bending over and what have you  But normal as I am now no I never feel it  None at all  None at all  And if you were to if you didn't do any exercise now  would it go away by itself  It would go away  and  possibly in six months ' time I 'll feel it again  I 'll say there 's  that pain again   Then   Right   It 'll just come back on you again  And when did you say it came on the last time  Uh I was exercising a few weeks back  Right so it 's really for the last few weeks you 've had a  problem  So you had it over the last two years on and off  Yes   Yeah  And then six weeks ago it came or  a few weeks ago it came back again  Yes  And it 's really hasn't cleared up yet  You want to get  it checked out  Exactly   I 'd like to know  And it 's a sharp pain  behind the right  leg and behind the right  thigh  Doesn't move anywhere  Aye   No  You 've no pain in your back  No  No pains in the knee  No  No other problems at all  Not at all  You 're generally well  Yes  No other problems with your health  No  Any medication  No medication  And you said a physio told you that your right leg was shorter  She she measured up she seemed to ignore the fact that it was actually a pain in my leg  And I  uh the crux of the matter I think is I felt  I heard and felt something snap  yet  she tried to tell me that uh it was the bother was at base of the back  And she just kept kneading the base of my back until it was sore and telling me that that was the problem   it wasn't   Uh-huh   Uh-huh   And she  you don't  actually believe her then  No I don't believe her at  I 've no confidence  in going up to the sports clinic again  And  2 sylls    Have you worn it  Have you used the foam that she gave you  No I didn't  Uh uh did you not try it at all  I no I didn't  Do you not think it 'd be worth trying  I I I don't think so because uh  it I had never ever any trouble before this  And then I heard the snap  and felt the snap  and I don't think uh now I don't I don't think that after all these years that suddenly  Well I I would think that they should actually give it a  give it a try cos it  it 's certainly going to do no harm  And if it did work at least then  you know it 'd be something simple that would work  Okay  Can I 've a wee look at your knee  Yeah   Aye  Just bend the knee right the way up for me  Okay now just sit down again  It 's alright  Bend the knee right the way back for me  Okay bend it back to your  to touch the back of your thighs  Just bend it down  Bend it right the way back  Now straighten it out for me  Hold it out straight  Now keep it straight  Don't really bend it  Ke  keep it straight  Now just relax the leg  Let me take the weight of it  Let me take the weight of it again  Bend the knee down for me  Okay are you sore anywhere round here  No  So the knee 's perfectly fine  or  Okay  And just relax the leg now for me  How about that  Yup   It 's fine  And turn it round here  It 's fine  now how about in here at the back  That 's fine  How about in here  Fine  Are you tender there at all  No  How about up here  No  Can you just stand up for me  Turn around a minute  point to where exactly it 's sore  Well it is  some in there  Can you point it with one finger  firs  I can't really point it out now  there  Yeah  several sylls   Just bend forward for me  Try and touch your toes  Stand up again  Lean right the way back and turn back  Is that sore  No  Twist down the side  down the other side  Now just stand straight for me again  Just tell me if this hurts anywhere  Did she find the physio  therapist find a sore place in your back  She just said it was tight  She actually made it sore by sticking her her thumbs in it which isn't  I mean here 's what she done  I I think you must 've uh  pulled one of the hamstring 's muscles  what 's happened is whenever you heard the snap it was probably just a few fibres and uh  2 sylls  You haven't actually broken the whole hamstring muscle  Uh it 's just going to be a sprain  And the problem with it is that unless you don't  exercise properly it 's not going to heal up  and you 're going to be left with a weak knee  uh whenever you 're in go and do some uh excessive exercise you 're just going to bring it on again  So what you need to do is do uh gradual exercise to build it up  to full strength again  I think if you if you do that build it up gradually it will take over from the weakness  Yup  And then  once you start getting full exercise you won't have any difficulty with it
