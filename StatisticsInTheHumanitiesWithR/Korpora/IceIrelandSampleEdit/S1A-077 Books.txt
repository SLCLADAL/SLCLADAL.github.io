Plenty of room   Whose house is it in  Tom and Nora   Tom and Nora   Tom and oh  yeah yeah   You should 've  seen us  To get it down we got bamboo sticks  four eh   I 'd to go  out and buy four

we kind of   laughter  it was like a coffin being  lifted  out of a hearse  Oh yeah  laughter   And there was a cardboard box put round it all  as well   How did  they transport it  We did  We transported it  We put it up on the front seat of Mum 's car diagonal across  It just about fitted  We did   Uh uh uh   Dropped the seats in  the Fiesta and put it in  Just went in now  not doing any damage or anything to it  Well it 's beautiful  no I gave them the nicer one  It 's just it 's very full  very wide  That was the  one up  between the piano and the settee  that every one kept banging their head off  Uhm and they have it in just they 've a big  alcove  big high ceiling and their walls are painted kind of a  goldeny yellowy mustardy  sort of a colour  And it just stands  in and fills  where they 're going to put their Christmas tree now I don't know  But that 's  where their Christmas tree went  laughter  I don't think they need a Christmas tree with this cos it 's about the same size  they can just hang the decorations on it  But it  looks fantastic  They 're absolutely beautiful  Course with two of them in the room they were taking over   Yeah   Yeah oh yeah   Mm   But you can actually stand back from it and see it   They can hang their decorations on it   They can put their Christmas decorations on the cheese plant   Really  And they 've nothing else in like they 've  nothing else  to put in the corner and it just looks  fabulous in there  Yeah   So you still you kept the other one  I kept the other one yeah  I might  trim it down  from the top and let it grow out the bottom   Then she went and bought  a new small one  Yeah because the other one had lost a lot of the bottom leaves and was all  straggly and bare at the bottom   Yes I like them but I haven't a place to put them   That 's just going to keep   It 's not  It 's going to grow up I 'll cut the other one at the top and  then the bottom  will grow  and it 'll  fill out the bottom  You see the other one was growing up and then it was coming out of the top  It 'll take over   Will grow out   I 'd hopes of winning the Lotto last night and putting an extension out there
