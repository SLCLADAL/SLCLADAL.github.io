<S1B-073 Museum - Bank>  It 's uhm  archaeology uh uhm  sort of  looking at you know uhm  his life uhm using uhm you know a load of  exhibits  you know  objects  Like uh uhm there 's  I think there 's one uhm  of sort of uh his bell you know  bells and things you know up there and  Right   Mhm   Where where   where did all most of this  this stuff come from  There 's   Uhm it was the  Museum down in Dublin  called  the Irish  the what 's it called again  It 's the uhm  Yeah   And that  It 's the Irish Museum of  it 's it 's the main uh museum down there  It deals with all the you know antiquities  and stuff  I can't remember the name of  it  off the top of my head but uh  Right yeah   I see   And is this is it the is uh  uh exhibition moving on somewhere or is it  it 's just staying here at Queen 's   No well there  there 's uhm  I 'm not too sure whether it 's been extended  here  uh due to popular demand  It 's meant to finish in April  But it 's been  extended to June  So uhm whether it moves on to maybe Armagh  Museum  I 'm not too   That 's the sister museum of  ours  Uhm I don't know whether you know a smaller version of it  will move down there  But because of the a lot of the exhibits are loan  uhm exhibits then  I 'm not too sure whether it will  be travelling   Yeah   I seen that   Right   Yeah   I didn't  I didn't know Armagh was the  sister museum   Yeah it  is  Uh-huh it is  It 's part of  it 's uh it 's part of the Ulster Museum  It 's  uhm you know funded by us  and  you know there 's a separate  uh curator uhm down there but uhm  Oh very good   Right   Right   What about uhm what about this the big  uh dinosaur collection youse had on there  I seen a lot of that  Dinosaurs Alive  Oh yes that 's   Yeah yeah  Is that uh when did that  was that years ago  Uhm two years ago  actually  Two years ago yeah  It was   Two years ago yeah  I remember there  was a lot of noise made at the at the  review yeah   laughter  Oh there was  yeah it was a very good  exhibition  It 's  uhm you know  it 's it 's a travelling one as  well  You know it 's goes all round you know Britain and  that  And uh   Yeah   Right   Yeah yeah for it was  it was very good now  Was very good  It was a good one  have you   So is there  anything else you wanted to know about  Is there anything else  uhm that 's coming anything which I 'm  interested in   Uhm we 've got  a big football exhibition coming  up  in uhm June  Uhm it 's  hundre  it 's to do with uh a hundred years of Association Football  But there 's  also going to  be exhibits on the World Cup and  you know a lot of  uhm ex I think there 's going to be you know you know football shirts and you  know things  to do   there 's a big photography  uhm part of it as well  Yeah   Brilliant   Very good   Oh right yeah   Right   Oh that 'll be very good   I see  And uh it should be  uhm like  the dinosaurs there 's going to be a big activity area you know for kids you know so they can you know come not only and just look at the exhibition  but uhm  you know  to look you know there 's activities  going  on to do with football  Uhm   Is this uh   Mhm   Yeah   That 's very  good  Is it Northern Ireland  Football Association has something to do  with this   Uhm yeah the  Well there it 's really yeah it would be  based on them  but uhm there 's other you know exhibits as well from other clubs in over you know in uh England  Football clubs  Football  clubs  yeah  Very  good  Very good   Hopefully  anyway  I 'm not too I 'm not totally sure but I think that 's the way it 's  it 's leading   When  sorry when uh when is uh  this starting this  on   June   June  the let 's see June the seventeenth  It 's running right  through to January  next year   June   Right this is  1 syll    Is that I think  that might be the start of the World Cup  the very day the World  Cup starts  Mhm mhm   Is that is that the day it  starts   Yeah I think  it is  It 's the fifteenth or the seventeenth  Uh-huh  Very good  Very good  So that 's what that 's the big one for the summer  anyway   I think  I think it 's a nice change to have something like that  something relevant   Mm well  this is the first time a football  exhibition 's  actually been actually has been done  in the museum before  So it 's sort of like a first  for us  Yeah   I think that 's a good idea too cos it 'll start bringing in some young people  into the museum whereas you know  before I think  a lot of young people 'll get bored with it   Mhm mhm  Well that 's what that 's what 's they were trying to do  Trying to bring  yeah trying to bring in sort of a different uhm sort of group of people that  would  usually come you know  Cos most of the time it be  either families you know young children to see the dinosaurs or sort of you know uhm older people who want to come and see the uhm art  exhibitions and that  So uhm it would be bringing a lot  Right   Yeah  that 's right   I was in here I was in here about a year ago  and uhm  I was interested about this you know Irish History  section  upstairs you know  volunteers and stuff you know  Mhm   Mhm mhm   Oh right  Which was very good because when uhm I was studying I studied Irish History A level  Mhm  And uhm when I got round to looking a lot of the stuff was very very  see it was very relevant to what I was studying  You know  like as in  I mean the battles and stuff there  was all  all the gear there you know  And if I had 've knew it was there when I was studying like  I would 've definitely came up you know  It was a bit unfortunate like  But uh  Mhm   Mhm   Mhm mhm mhm   Right  But uhm    How  did you come across it then  Just by  Oh I just I just came in cos I 'm  actually  I 'm a student down in Queen 's you know  so  I just  took a day off or whatever and  took  a dander round you know  so   Just to have a look at it   Right   Uh-huh   Uh-huh  you didn't know what was here before  I hadn't a clue what was here  Hadn't a clue  laughter   Hadn't a clue   Huh  and you were surprised  Yeah I was indeed  I was indeed  I was indeed  And then you get your Visa  you get a Visa card  Mhm  Automatically  when I say   it means you 've to apply for it  You apply for it  I mean medical students and dental students are the only students  You apply for it yeah   Now that 's I 've got a Visa card with the Northern so I have to close that as well  Well what we 've done with others is you can actually we can re-order we can order your new one  And then when you get the new one and you 've paid off the old one just cut it up because it 's the same  At the end of the day  it 's the same sort of central source  Visa  is Visa  Mm   Yeah  But you might as well have a Bank of Ireland Visa because it 's  Because when you graduate then you 're eligible for the Affinity card  Have you seen that  With the Queen 's   The one with  the Queen 's  stuff on it   Yeah mhm  which is  two percent  cheaper  It gives   And does it give money to  Queen 's you know   It gives  four pounds to Queen 's every time somebody takes  several sylls  They 're lovely cards  several syllables   Oh it is  Isn't it very nice  Nice  So only if you 're now  you don't have to be a Bank of Ireland customer  Mhm  You can be a staff member or a graduate  but uhm or or a  several sylls    Because the the Visa card doesn't  actually have any connection to the account sure it doesn't particularly  No   they 're not   Although  we can get it you know set up so it 's cleared from your account  direct debit  That 's true   Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh  uh-huh  Aye normally the Visa card comes out whenever  laughter  there 's no other money about  Exactly  I know exactly   several sylls    And the overdraft 's up   4 sylls   I prefer to choose rather than having just to make it exactly  laughter  What you might find in fourth year or especially final year  you 're  away from home  then you could miss a payment  so  it 's a very handy way of doing it and you  Mm   Mhm    if you do have the loan and everything   And  and you and you have the loan  Exactly  So it would never not be paid  Cos  if it 's Bank of Ireland on this loan we 'd send it back you know so  Mhm   Mhm mhm  So it works out very well  A lot of them have done that  And then when you actually start working you can cancel that  and then decide whether you 're going to pay it yourself  Mhm  And how much you know  They 're great to have  So uhm what was I going to say  Yes about  to opening the account  what way  do you  Mhm   It 's very simple you know  Just fill in  a load  of forms and  laughter  you know  But what we can do I mean you 've two other accounts which must be hard enough to manage  Yeah  laughter   Well it 's just it is  actually  but if uh it 's just that I never got round to changing  I mean over from   Mm   From your home  I know  Well no  wa  it it was uhm I was quite happy  Yes because they 're both there it was  more  awkward even to close them  to go  in and to go and sort of change my student loan just to one I I would 've changed all just to First  Trust  except that I had to  I had the student loans coming to Northern because  Mm   I know   Mhm    Definitely  very complicated  Well   laughter  And then you consider I 've got two accounts in each so  I 've actually got four accounts  laughter   I know  That 's too much to   3 sylls  The last thing you want to do anyway is add another to the collection  No  So really if you were happy enough  Oh yeah I would  just   Now what  we can do and it 's up to yourself some people would like to go in and face-to-face close the account with the other bank  or we have a form which you can fill in or sign here and we can send it to the other bank and they can either debit your account in here or credit depending on  Mhm  What way your account is
