<S1B-074 Residents' Assoc>  Okay well I think we 'll we 'll look maybe at the at the different issues a little bit later on I suppose uh  I 'll just  we 'll fly through the history and then Bob 's got a  present  uhm a further wee thing uh  All I was going to say was  following the site visit  uh Bob uh went there  and all of us went to the Council meeting that night and uh Bob made a  about a ten minute presentation to the Council  the objections that were brought up uh in this presentation were the character of the area the impact on traffic loss of amenities the site itself  the effect on the environment uh the undertaking itself from the developers ' point of view  uh the uh the maps and the inaccuracies on the maps  uh the level of opposition which was unprecedented and uh the state of apartment sales uh you know and the market for apartments at the moment which has obviously gone through its ups and downs and I think it 's really on a down at the moment  we then uh just quickly through the rest of the wee bit of history is uh  in July two thousand and two uhm the Council then  you 've got to remember the planners still hadn't made a decision on it  They had   they had said that they were  going to recommend uh  passing uh approval  They were saying that they would recommend it once council had commented  They still hadn't actually recommended it for uh approval uh or sorry  they hadn't actually approved it  Uh so at that point uh the Council recommended that it goes to the Management Board of the Planning Office  Uh that 's like the hierarchy or the top level in the planning service  Uh and they would look at it you know taking all the evidence uh that has been presented and make uh and uh sort of review what the lower planners had uh you know how they 'd come to their conclusion that it should be passed  uh taking into all the uh to into account all the different uh objections and uh uhm sort of  circumstances I suppose  Uh and it sat there from uh July two thousand and two til uh  towards the end of September two thousand and two whenever Mr Martin intervened  The developer  uh intervened and uh  pulled the application uh on the basis that a decision hadn't  happened that basically time had gone on and that the planners hadn't got to a decision  uh through whatever circumstances it happened  And so he then went to the independent body called the you know the Planning Appeals Commission that you 've all been written to by and uh you know the  in other words the application was in default   clears throat  this pulled it sort of right out of the normal I suppose uh procedures and uh it  it 's now gone to this uh Planning Appeals Commission  obje  the  developer had uh has stated that he wants an informal hearing and as I know you 've probably been written to to be told that it 's on the fifteenth  it is on the fifth of February  uh ten o'clock uhm and that you were given the opportunity then to decide whether you wanted to attend that or whether you wanted to join with others to put forward a a focused opinion uh or you know  your view through a smaller a smaller body  and uh at that  that that point sort of Bob and Bob and myself we decided well we were going to attend  We 'd we 'd gone this far so we were  we just said we would be there and then we decided we would call some sort of a meeting to uhm I suppose to uh  to discuss with you lot uhm the uh the way forward  we uh realise that we have to present a statement of case on the fifteenth of the first uh five pm that day and you just don't get  there 's no grace given  it  it 's supposed to be fifteen hundred words and and I know that Bob has put a bit of work into this  Uh it can be uh you know it 's a document that just is presented uh to the different parties before the meeting  I think two weeks before the meeting  Uh we also see Mr Martin 's uh statement of case as well  and uh those documents then sort of uh are kind of the  the basis on which a discussion or informal hearing takes place chaired by the uh one of the  the uhm commission  uh the Planning Appeals Commission  And it 's a roundtable  supposed to be quite a relaxed atmosphere uh hearing  So it 'll be interesting  clears throat  so uhm  what what I suppose uh just before I ask Bob to talk about his uh  uh the actual you know the bit of work he 's done on uh putting together a statement of case  I suppose what we 're trying to say is that we 're we 're keen to put  to present a clear and reasoned argument in favour of appropriate development and against uh inappropriate uh development  uhm and maybe to consider uh whether we then go towards a compromise  uh in that meeting and we just need to hear your views and and and listen to what you 've to say about that  And also to have an idea of what you 're planning uh you know if any of you have already indicated that you 're going to go to the informal hearing  I suppose for our own idea of what the meeting 's going to be like we 'd like to know that  uhm and uh whether if you if you 've maybe indicated by coming tonight you may be wanting to say that you want to be represented there and if you 're happy for us to do that we would like to know that before we go  also then if you 've just any ideas of the of the way forward towards the fifth of February uh we 're  open to hear all that  Maybe I could open  uh threw it over to Bob here to talk about the statement of case  that bit  The one thing we 're not quite clear about here is what actually happens at this commission at this meeting  And I honestly believe it 's going to be a compromise situation where both sides are going to gradually move towards each other  I don't think we can  stop any development here  That 's the first thing  I don't know what people feel about that but I don't see how we can actually  stop them building a range of houses  Now we 've talked privately amongst ourselves about what we 'd be willing to put up with  and we 're talking about some semi-detached houses  maybe six would fit into there  three nice detached houses or a mixture of bungalows semis or whatever  that type of thing  But that all fits in very nicely with the area  And the one thing that I can't understand about this is this apartment block sitting right in the middle of Gilnahirk  It 's just it 's so absurd  So I mean that 's my opinion at the moment is that we 'll probably to have to go in to negotiate and this  uh neutral guy will just sit there and he 'll try and work between the two of us and see what  see which way we can sort something out  Is that other people 's impression of this  Are you still in a mind to block the thing completely  Could could I just say I don't believe that the Planning Appeals Commission are neutral  Right  I believe that they are in favour of the developer  and  I 'm not  I 'm not entirely sure what the right approach to take is but I wouldn't see it as a neutral party arbitrating between two individuals and coming to some compromise like say six semi-detached or something of that order  I  2 sylls    Right   They 'd certainly  claim to be neutral  They claim to be I mean the  document here here   I wouldn't I wouldn't deny that   Okay mhm  But I I don't believe on the basis of the information that we 've received recently from  Yeah  The Planning Appeals Commission that they are neutral in fact  They seem to be in favour of the development as currently planned  Mm  Is that that recent DOE letter  Uh yes  You see that 's really  that 's still 's from planning  That 's planning office rather than the PAC which is a different body again  The reason that  you 're  I know what you 're saying because we we were a bit confused by that letter when it first came  But I I that letter the recent one that laid out all the conditions do you remember  That 's separate   Yes  Well that that that was  that actually is from the planners  not from the planning appeals  So there is reason to  to hope that they are neutral  Well everything that they have said in the way of their documentation in any of their letters  If you know we we 've sort of  you can visit their website uh which is quite an interesting place to go at PAC  you know  WWW dot PAC NI dot CO dot UK I think it is uh is the website and uh you know gives you  recent it gives you uh recent examples that they 've gone through it gives you  You know so it 's  it 's quite a helpful site uhm and I think that uh they claim to be neutral  Mhm  I 'll give you that to have a read at  This is  the PAC 's  all about the procedures basically  Right okay   Oh yes thank-you  Okay have a do have a look at that and if you hear anything that they 're not independent  laughter  I 'd be interested  Well  several sylls  if it 's an informal meeting and for argument 's sake both sides say come to some kind of agreement  is that then uh enforceable or is that still in  you know  We don't know Bob  We just  don't know  I mean that 's what I what I  I understand what you mean because you were worried that we 'd go and turn up and say  look we 'll put up with three of these and then that happens but other people aren't happy with that  That 's what I 'm slightly concerned that we go with the bottom line to negotiate on  But we 're not even sure if that 's the procedure yet  That 's the trouble  We should maybe try and clarify that a bit more  what the actual meeting 's about   Right  I mean  several sylls    Well I thought it was in the instructions   the chairman issues a report and the  report  becomes binding   Yeah   I think there is a a pretty clear uh outcome from this  I think something like four weeks   there 's a there  they can whoever leads that meeting submits a report with all his findings back to the Planning Appeals Commission  and the planning they look at it for about another two or three weeks and then they issue their decision and their decision is basically like just  I think in any tribunal situation Neil there  it 's  you know  it 's a tribunal and there are findings made  End of story   Yeah  And therefore acted upon  Yup  I think  what 's imperative for us to bear in mind here whether  we 're sort of right on top of the site like yourselves or sort of being affected by a lot of others here with children and increased community safety aspects  That going into this  we need to be seen to be fair-minded  people  and that I think if we do sort of offer alternatives and and show that we 're quite happy that the area be developed but not exploited  You know  I think apartments  fifteen apartments is exploitation whereas maybe three detached dwellings is development  You know and it 's not going to bring in an extra thirty or fifty vehicles going up and down the streets every  morning  and evening  You know that type of thing  And that 's  what  1 syll    Mhm   Yeah yeah   Yeah yeah   Like I 'll treat this with  what you 've said  that 's exactly what I 've got here  is a very positive statement of uh  We agree with modernisation  we agree with development in the Gilnahirk area  We can't not agree with otherwise our houses wouldn't be there  But what we want is reasonable development and that sort of thing  Now what we 've done is  drawn up a statement of case  very much a draft  I 've gone round to photograph a few houses so don't mind  if your house is on it and you don't want it on it please let me know but it 's Gilnahirk Court and Gilnahirk Park  But it 's just to show the type of houses that are there  So there 's an  introduction about the area  The next bit then is what the proposed development is the scale of it  all the sort of problems that we 've seen with the design of it  I 've started to criticise the design of it  I started to look at it and think this is absurd  I mean there 's a playground here across a road from the main place  I mean it 's daft  Lots of silly wee things like that are just  so I 've accused them a little bit of uh  poor quality design and things  ve  very gently  Everything 's done very you know wee kicks on the shins here but all done very  laughter  un  right down underneath the table
