Have you no pepper in this  No and you 're not putting pepper in it either  Take a bit out and put pepper in your own bit then  Don't why you put it in that bowl anyway   You could get woodlice in

hour slagging him off  Oh I thought you meant  I thought you meant Denise 's one  He ended up sleeping in her bed while she slept in yours  laughter  And he came down to me at quarter to ten in the morning and went  uh-huh you haven't seen Denise anywhere have you  laughter  I was uh sorry  no uh   Well I  was too warm  I was in my jeans and my t-shirt and it 's it 's really hard to get to sleep at night here cos it 's roasting now  I sleep with the windows open  still and it 's still too warm  My windows don't open  I don't want to open my windows in case rats run in  from the bins  Martin  That 's the truth  Like I do during the day but not at night  Well whenever Dermot was in that room he kept them open constantly cos it was really damp before he moved in   Who was Dermot  Bouncer from Jameson 's  Jameson 's  Absolute lunatic  Right  And how long did he stay for  He was brilliant   how long  y  nearly   whole year but   Near enough the year  He 's due back soon  Yeah  He 's coming back here  I don't know  Where did he go to  America  Yeah Kobe can actually drive them to the other side of the country  laughter  or the world even  God my brain 's gone   Oh that 's nice  What 's nice  fuck   Does anybody else want some of this  I 'll have a wee bit just to taste it  3 sylls   I wouldn't go that far now  It 's edible  Not whatever I 've been

Seven pound  Oh  Dear God  It was okay like  cos it was like it was only what three fifty each and it was gorgeous  She doesn't like  remember we were going to go to Pizza Hut and you went   4

about flipping health food  Going round the world  laughter  into Italy and  China  The last few days I 've been to Pizza Hut Spuds Super Chef and McDonald 's  Where 's Super Chef  It used to be Bishops  Formerly known as Bishops  Oh right right right yeah I know where you 're talking about  The shop formerly known as Bishops  I liked fish and chips out of Bishops  That night we were

kebab  you wanted to go to Swan Lake  Swan Lake   No I  was saying I couldn't remember what we used to get out of Swan Lake  Oh it was uhm  the gravy chip with peas and mushrooms  and  chicken  Yeah that was it   I knew there was something that we used to go there for  I don't know  Go and investigate Martin  I think it 's just the wind  Did anybody take in the bins no  Yeah uh-huh  Yeah it was just the door closing  Want some   several sylls   Sorry  You want some Jennifer  Ehm  several sylls   Delma  What  Oh fuck it 's alright  laughter  Oh  I thought you 'd got

 I don't care  Well you never know  several sylls   He 's going to ring back  and none of us are going to say that you 're not in   I 'm not I 'm not going to be here  Well then I 'll just not be in  You will  We 'll drag you to the phone  We 'll say phone back  Why don't you come on round  It 's forty-two Haddington Road  If I find somewhere else to stay for the night  I 'll go up and spend the night in Halls with  2 sylls   We 'll tell her she  rang anyway   No  Fionnuala would really appreciate that  Fionnuala 's not here  Where is she  She 's away home  Why  Kicked out of her course   So she didn't actually leave at Christmas  She just waited another two months and got kicked out now  I heard she 'd been kicked out at Christmas   But she would have been kicked out of Halls then too  She wasn't in Halls  She wasn't  in Halls  She 's living down at Fitzgaul  Oh I see   Was  Not any more  They 're both going to do a course in uh in Liverpool I think  What waffle was he talking about a bookies ' course  Well apparently there is some such thing  Very few people get onto it  But I mean  do you not need loads of capital to set up a business  Yeah you would  You would have to   Maybe not loads  Depends how many people lose in the last  the first  couple  of weeks  As long as nobody wins a vast amount you 're okay  Yeah   But he could get uhm one of those  Grant things for setting up your own business  No I was going to say uhm  you know  oh what 's the word franchise  Yeah  From Ladbrokes or  Paddy Power or someone  Yeah  There 's generally enough of them about  And you have to see opportunities though  See an opening in the market and  you go  for it  It 's like I want to open a Mexican restaurant in Belfast  I would love to  Yeah   What 's stopping you  Uh lack of finance  About a hundred and fifty grand  Lack of knowledge about it  I 'd need a few people to go in as partners  But I 'd love to  Like the  have you ever been to the Chiquitas in London  Mhm  Mexican  Aw I love that place  There was one in Greenwich uh  Yeah  Oh what 's it called  no  I can't remember and we were there a couple of times  It 's called Sol something  Or is that the beer they served  laughter  I do tend to get mixed up in these things  No it was  it was Sol but there was  What was that  It was the workmen  I think they 're mad  Where are they working  Are any of them good-looking  Oh now  One of them looks like one of the guys from Boyzone  Rubbish  I swear to God he looks like Keith  Sorry Martin  I 've been wolfing  away at this and  you wanted some   You 're a liar    3 sylls    It 's yours  You finish it if you want to  I 'm just eating it because it 's here  1 syll  do you want some  Just a mouthful  See you   Can't wait til Steven gets home actually cos I don't think he came home last night  Really   Why what makes you think that  Well I was still  Des and I got food  Where  Have a wild guess  Bithika  And then promptly had an argument  So he stomped off to Margaret 's room and then I stomped after him  And then I went to my bed  and he wasn't home in that space of time   Were they not walking up the road with youse or behind youse then  They were  clears throat  wrapped around each other shall we say  whenever I was leaving  And I just went  look we 're going up the road to get food and Steven went right grand  I seen her in the morning  Was she ugly   She could have been an awful lot worse  She was one of these uh  old before her years types  That would suit Steven then  laughter  Considering he 's going bald  No no no no no no  Oh God  laughter   What 's that going business  Well   No no  what cos Steven is more mature than  What do you mean boring  You 're confusing maturity yeah and boring yes  Okay okay  Yeah can we make sure he doesn't listen to this  laughter   Do you want a cigarette  And Delma there had nearly forgotten that the tape was running  I 'm sorry  Cigarette  No thank-you  No I think he  it 's not that he 's boring or old or  Are you going to try and defend Steven  I like Steven  Why laughter and simultaneous unclear speech   He 's harmless  He is  Biggest insult you can give a guy  He 's harmless  Nice   Well  I think that 's nice  laughter   Yeah yeah exactly yeah exactly  That 's the second biggest insult   Or cute   Well I don't I don't know  You must have a different meaning of nice than I do  Nice is boring  Nice is somebody that 's got no other characteristics apart from being  They haven't done anything nasty to deserve to deserve being called nasty  So they 're just nice  A bit like yourself  Martin has his moments simultaneous and unclear speech   You 're going to have to move Martin  Why  So I won't be in the shade  laughter   Well if you come any closer to me I 'll be in the shade  Good  I think you should just both go inside  Did you get another packet of Rolo  Yeah  You 're gonna turn into a fucking packet of Rolo  I haven't opened them yet but I 'll open them now  Hope they 're not soft  Rolo    Why didn't you put them in the freezer  Are they soft  No  Keep going  He might hear you  I 'm getting freckles on my fingers again  laughter   I 've developed a freckle on my finger  A freckle  laughter   Well okay I don't have freckles like you do but  just look there there  a small freckle freckle on finger  But I never had that before  It only appeared a couple of months ago   No but  I got something like that in there about two years ago  Would anyone like a Rolo  No thanks
