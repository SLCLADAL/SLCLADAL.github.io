long and the play is fifty minutes long  Are you going to get paid when you 're going  Uh February this month some time  I think around the  uh seventeenth or something  It means I get to go down and have a free  enjoyable weekend   Oh it 's the arts festival  the arts festival oh yeah  Oh right  Band band money  Oh it 's music art and drama festival  Well my my my earnings  2 sylls   I hate these bloody ten p pieces  Like they really bug me  I always end up with a  pile of them in my pocket   They 're terrible aren't they  And the worst thing is you can't use them in a phone or anything  It 's stupid  And even the phones that you can use them in you don't know  especially when you should be able to put new ten p-s in  Exactly  It 'll take a while for the old ones to really  Do you know what I really hate  Is like people charging fifty-five p for cans now  and twenty-two p for a bag of popcorn  Uh they have twenty p splashed all over them and you go into the shops and you get fifty-five p for a can  It 's outrageous   I have to say  4 sylls    Do you know what happened to me yesterday and it really annoyed me I must say   Your drinks  I 'll take for all of those  No  3 sylls   seventy please altogether  You don't do bottles no  No I 'm sorry  Do you want me to change it  It 's okay  Are you sure  No it 's alright  Sorry about that  Okay  I 'll drop you down the change  Yeah let 's have a look  several sylls   Oh God no no  no no  It 's okay  I don't I don't get to uhm   3 sylls  do this very often  I never drunk a pint in my life   Jennifer look at the size of it  It 's okay Lauri for  God 's sake   Just get a glass  and pour it into the glass  Do you want me to get you a glass   How much is it in a bottle  Just a glass  It 's one twenty  That 's cheap  That is the  cheapest drink you can get   How much is my  Heineken then  Jesus there you go  I mean I 'm used to paying two fifty  Give us a go  One twenty for a  pint    pint of Furstenburg is two twenty  That 's  oh it 's mine was two twenty  Mine 's a pint   Yeah mine  mine is mine is one twenty is it  Oh cos I 've got a pint  Mine is one twenty  sorry  3 sylls   Will I get you a glass and you can pour it into a glass  No  Drink up that pint there now  You 'll be so  stoned   I know  I 'll be ugh  Frankie comes in and sees me with a pint  Let 's take a picture  simultaneous and unclear speech   I 'm only joking  It was grand last night cos I just  had the bottle   Like Eoin 's  parents loved me until they saw me with a pint in one hand and a cigarette in the other and they thought that  was so terrible   Common   Common   It 's interesting how you see that no-one  4 sylls   You find that half the people have  their own conversation   Their own conversation  yeah  And people are just talking  I know we began talking the way you 're talking  laughter   I booked my twenty-first  Oh my God  For when  Are you not twenty-one already  The seventeenth of April   The Portview  3 sylls    Excellent  Can't wait  It 's going to be a real night  Right well I hope  I 've got a big crowd there like  That 's what I 'm hoping  We 'll have to get going on the guest list here  We have to get like invite everybody we know basically  Major prez  Need a band  Well the band are invited  Do you need a band  Uh no uhm  I 'm afraid  uhm I have to have their DJ  If you have it in that big room up in the Portview you have to have the resident DJ  You 're not allowed to bring in your own DJ  and   DJ   Do you have to  What if you  wanted a live band  Could you not just say well I don't want to get any music at all  I want a live band  We could do an  all-in for about   You still have to pay for it  I think  It 's because  I I mean I wanted Ralph to do DJ  Having someone  you know would be good like  And I said you know is there any way I can have anyone else in  Do I have to have uh  2 sylls  She said the reason was because the guy that does the DJ owns all the equipment and the lights and everything in that room so therefore like  if anything goes wrong there like he wants to  be able to use it   He 'd be really good   And you want  to have it in the Portview  Yeah I think that I think that room is really nice like in comparison to most of the rooms I 've been for the twenty-firsts  They 're really like  dingy small rooms and  I like   It 's near  the DART line as well which would be  really handy   It 's on the DART  line which would be handy for everyone  It 's got a bar  It 's got the bar 's really nice  There 's loads of seats  You know I just think it 's a nice place  I got a bar extension til one thirty as well  Excellent  Brilliant yeah  So it 's the seventeenth and it 's a Sunday night so  everybody has to keep it free    4 sylls  DART line it 'll be easy to  2 sylls   anyway  It 's  3 sylls  what  Sorry   Brilliant   Why  5 sylls  the DART  And are your parents going to do all the food or  I might do most of the food myself  Although well we can do it together then  true  I 'm just going to have a walk down and see if Frankie 's here  Okay  several sylls   She could make like a big   laughter  she could make like a big square one or something  The cake  Yeah  I 'm talking about like I wanted a chocolate  cake   Well I don't know  if she she 's skilled in the old cream design or anything you  know just   Oh  nothing to do with cream  I want like something like a chocolate cake  Don't worry about that  We 'll do that  Like I I 'm talking about  just want that a  big chocolate cake  I know but to write on or icing to write on the   You just literally want   Oh I most of the cakes for twenty-firsts are   4 sylls    I know  I do  I mean it 's for myself  a nice one   Yeah   Sure I 'm sure you can eat it all yourself  laughter   You know the chocolate cake from the Wishbone  Yeah  Uh how much were the  the round ones  About seven pounds  Like a black forest gateau for a hundred   Uhm so you 'd be looking  3 sylls  So how much would you pay for it   Disgusting   Disgusting  plastic   Just so I could tell her  I I really don't have a figure in my mind  You see obviously she 's not going to make one big enough  to suit all the people that 's going to be there  Not everybody is going to eat  birthday cake anyway  So if you just have a  you know whatever size one she can make even say for fifty or whatever  We 'll have other desserts as well  We 'll have  pavlova and stuff   She will if you want   That 's for about  fifty people is it  That yeah that kind of thing  I mean there 's going to be  How many people are you inviting  I think there 's going to be around a hundred  You 'd really want one around uh  this size   All the relatives and stuff   Yeah  Wouldn't you  8 sylls   Mm yeah  Just ask her right  I 'm very interested in that kind of a cake cos I know those cakes are beautiful   See any time  we have anything we get  Superquinn to make our cakes right  I mean basically  okay they 're nice  They it 's a fresh cream Madeira cake and there 's mandarins and cream in the centre or whatever  but like they 're just like  they 're horrible like  They 're not like people like get this lump of  cream  stuck on their plate and  everyone kind of gets really sick of that  Most people love chocolate  Oh wow  brilliant idea   Yeah   All your friends will love it  anyway   Yeah   That was my stipulation when I was made have a twenty-first that  I 'd have a chocolate cake   That 's one of your stipulations in friendship as well cos all like  3 sylls    What do you mean made have a twenty-first   I didn't want to have a party   Did you not   No I 'm getting used to the idea now but uhm  And your Mum and Dad suggested it did they  Yeah my Mum and Dad like said they  wanted me to have it because I was the last child  in the  family  They want me to have a wedding and a twenty-first  5 sylls    8 sylls     5 sylls    A what and a twenty-first  A wedding and a twenty-first  Two things  they want me to do  Oh my God   They don't ask for much do they  Well I 'm getting I 'm  kind of getting used  to the idea now  laughter  I well I  you know half of me wants one but then the other half says oh no  It 's such an ordeal and it might not work out and  Which order   It will  They always do   Of course it 'll work out   Work out like a   2 sylls   Sorry  Are you going to make invos up  I don't know  It 's such a it 's such a money racket seriously  Like Dermot 's going to ask this printer at work does he have any  I mean it 's such a  4 sylls   Well we could make invitations  We could  Could we get a calligraphy pen or something and  Do you know when you go to the airport  They even have one  And I 'd say you know the way you make up  a card or   Mm   Stationery  actually and you get something like a hundred of them for three pounds  But that 's just a little tiny card  No you can get actually a sheet  Can you  Yeah  They have one of those in Dun Laoghaire shopping centre haven't they  There 's there 's one for cards  When I was at the airport there 's one for cards and there 's one for stationery sheets  I must look into it
