<S1A-029 Second world war>  so what about  do you remember the first day of the war  I remember the third of September I think it was nineteen thirty-nine  Yeah  And I was working in Enniskillen  Right  And uh in the drapery trade  and the first thing we had to do was take stock and order some utility garments  And they were marked with a round white ring with a V cut out of them  cut out of the ring you understand  Right  uh if anybody purchased one of those garments they had to give us what you call margarine coupons  And it was so many coupons for each garment and they had to be cut out of the book and put into a  you know a drawer or a safe or something  Right  And uhm  sweets were rationed and not that I bought many of them but they were  rationed and we had to give coupons for them  And of course when I went into the shop to get some sweets  and handed in the coupons I thought I had them paid for  laughs   Why  I remember being in Peg Dawson 's in Enniskillen  She 'd a wee sweetie shop  And uh oh she said Mrs Lewis you forgot to pay me  laughs  I thought I 'd paid her with the coupons  I remember that as well  So what like  what would have been an ordinary meal  You know  like with the effects of rationing and stuff like that  Would 've been   Oh rationing  Yes food was rationed  Yeah  And we had ration books  Yeah  And uhm  the coupons were cut out of those also  And when they were done you didn't get any more groceries and you had to live very very meagrely  Right  And uh  What did they entitle you to the  Pardon  What did they entitle you to the  the   the coupons the ration coupons   ma   Whichever so many ounces  so many ounces of each item you know  Aye  of course you can't we can't very well say no  We took our bicycles out and went up to Clones laughter   So what  how then  did you not get married during the war  What  Were you married during the war  The wedding  So what what was that like   how how did  that affect it  Yeah yeah   How did   Yeah well I mean yeah uh I didn't have a wedding dress for the simple reason they weren't making them then  You  had a buy a two-piece suit or something like that  And uh of course the coupons had to be handed in again for those  Uh the material for the dress cost  two pounds fifty  and the making was one fifty which cost me four pounds for my wedding outfit  Mm   so then what about uhm with VE Day coming up now  what about the celebrations back then  The what  The celebrations  Well there wasn't any  None   When the  war ended  When the war ended   No  Not til the war ended  No well  when they  Well when  what was it like then  There was no twelfth of July  There was nothing like that  So then when the war ended  did everyone just go to town  Yes  What was it like  What was the final days like  The final day was  was it May  Yeah it is May  yeah  Uhm nineteen forty-five  she wasn't born  She was coming up  laughter    And were there  did you have like parties in the streets or  there was uhm you know uh celebrations for the the end of the  war  and they were consisted of  you know street  uh  shows and floats and  all that   Right   Mm   Was this  at Maguire 's Bridge or Enniskillen  No Enniskillen  Enniskillen yeah  There was nothing in the Bridge  Right  There isn't isn't yet either  laughs  Do you think there will be  What else was there now  There was no dances  There was no  no social life of any kind  so   That  was during the war  During the war  several sylls   Mhm  so what did you do then  What was  there must have been some sort of  Pardon  Was there any get-togethers or anything like that during the war  A get-together  Yeah  No  Nothing  No  Well you had the black-out  hadn't you   Oh  we 'd the black-out  Aye  And we had to buy black material and drape all our windows with it and you couldn't show one speck of light  The  police would be round after you  You 'd have to have your curtains very full and over the edge of the window in case any light would protrude you know through the corners  Right   Right  And uh that was called the black-out  Mhm  Well now we 'd some fun hadn't we  laughs   Well then what about the evacuees  Was there  evacuees   Oh  evacuees yes  we took in some evacuees  Yeah  They had been lying out on the uhm mountains around Belfast whatever  There was a Divis was it or  Yeah  They 'd been lying out there and they had no home and they 'd no nothing and they hadn't even water to wash  And we took three of them in  And uh my sister and my Nancy Auntie Nan she  uh took them all upstairs and we got a big   you know with the old steam  baths  We filled those up fill it with water for them and we put them in and scrubbed them  and gave them nice clean beds  We 'd  an awful job that and those nights was terrible  Mm   Yeah   How long were they here for  Oh they stayed for weeks  Right  Finally they got tired and wanted to go back to their city life you know  Suppose it would be quiet  would it  laughter  So did you ever keep in touch with them or  Uh for a while and then they faded out  Right right  But they were in every house around you know  They  were in all the  all the neighbours had them  Yeah   Were you asked to actually take children or  Huh  Were you actually asked to take children  or did you offer   Oh yes yes  yeah  The I think it would have been the Council  2 sylls  who come out  There was two or three days I went round myself  Yeah  Alice Dunne and I went round the we went right up to your granny 's  Right  But she wasn't having ay  anything  laughs  Wouldn't take them  They didn't go over to your house  I don't whether you 'd 've taken them or not  laughs   I don't know if we got a lot of people round Newtown   where everybody was taken in   Very good  Very good  And we got quite a good reception  You know they nearly all well they knew all  they knew some of us  in  most of the houses you know  where there was young people running about to dances and things  they  knew who we were  And we cycled all round Newtown up to the border and all round there  back down into Maguire 's Bridge and out in the country  Tom McMurray 's uh  they had uh they had four  Yeah   Yeah   Uh-huh  And Mrs Knowles had two beside us  And uhm now I don't know who else would have had them  I think there  was there was very few houses escaped  You see you more or less had to take them  Yeah  You can't leave them out  So what the were you given any money for taking them and to keep or to keep them or did you have to  take it all out of your own pocket   no we got so much  We got little  we didn't get very much  Right right  And they were ravenous  They were starving  Yeah  Do you remember the first day of the war  I remember coming home from school  I was a pupil in Enniskillen at the time and my mother said to me  they 've declared war and they 're still playing music on the radio  And she seemed a bit horrified that this was all happening at the same time as a war was going to start  laughter   Right right  Was there  what what would 've been the effect on  the whole say for example Newtownbutler  Was there  was there a general sort of outcry or was is all taken in people 's  stride or   Well now  I can't really remember exactly what happened apart from that because I spent most of my day out of the village  Right  And then when I came home I had homework to do and I didn't see much of the other people apart from holiday times  Right right  So well  then after the war started uhm what effects did it would it have had upon social life in the town  Well before the war there wasn't a great deal of social life here  But when the soldiers arrived  the  2 sylls  arrived in Crumlin  at the uh soon after the beginning of the war  They 'd been in Dunkerque and they were supposed to have a rest cure in Crum  Right right  they arrived and they lived in Nissen huts  which weren't awfully comfortable no doubt and the officers lived in the castle  after that they had dances in what is now the Community Centre in Newtownbutler  It was then called the Courthouse  all the local girls of course flocked to the dances  laughs   Yeah  And the social life began to wake up  Well  after about nine months then they departed  I think they went to Madagascar after that  and a lot of them were killed out there  I don't know  what   Right right   Do  people actually keep in touch with  Not now  We  did keep in touch with some of them but not any more  Oh right   Right  So then  after that they were followed by the Berkshire Regiment  and they again had dances  And I think some of them were held at the riding school at Crum  And after they left the Americans arrived  because America came into the war after Pearl Harbor  Right  And that was some time after the actual beginning of the war  So then they again  uh uh lived out in the Nissen huts  But during this time  uh between the  2 sylls  and the Americans  a lot of them used to come into Lurganboy House and they played tennis on the tennis what was then the tennis court  It was flat but I 'm afraid it isn't flat any longer  laughter  But anyway they did play tennis and then we had a few spare rackets  Right  And they really enjoyed themselves  And my mother used to make steak and kidney pies  which seemed to stretch and stretch according to the amount of gravy that was put in  Right  Because uh the meat was rationed  and butter was rationed and margarine was rationed  and there were very few cakes or anything  And sweets were rationed at the time  So whatever they got had to be more or less basic  But they seemed to have enjoyed their visits  Right right  Uh  Basically they were almost like taken in as family almost  Well that was it  Yes  So in between times I did my homework  laughter   Yeah yeah   Nice to fit it in you know  It had to be fitted in as well  Right right  Now what else can I remember  Oh yes there was a canteen  The what is now the Church Hall  had a marketplace underneath where they  graded eggs and the actual Church Hall was  it was then called the Parochial Hall was above the place where they grade the eggs  Mhm  And we played badminton up there  And the Johnson family had a canteen  And a Mrs Kerr who lived somewhere real near Clontivrin  uh ran the canteen and several other local people helped  So the army used to come in and they were supplied with Paris buns  laughter  Some of the local people made cakes and provided food and they had sausages  and uh again there was entertainment of some kind up there  Right  But it made a social gathering  and  we got to know quite a few of these people  And apart from the army  there was an  airforce base up at Killaroo  That 's  where Geoffrey Lewis now lives  lives  That 's all been dismantled  Right   Right   Mhm yeah
