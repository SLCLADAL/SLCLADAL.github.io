<S1B-070 AG Cross exam>  no I I I was anxious to to discover how uh that uh conclusion was reached that this was the first case and with respect I don't think you 've answered it  Maybe it 's a more appropriate one to put it to the official concerned  Was it simply by by his uh uh memory   can I  can I just say  on your views on Mr Fitzsimons and I think this is relevant  uh uh regarding the running of your office  uh an office which you say you were you were in and I accept what you say  from eight a-m onwards every day but uh Mr Fitzsimons found that the procedures for the processing of extradition cases were seriously defective  that there was no way of checking similarity of details  no indexing system which would immediately provide a summary of the file or the nature of the issues covered by it  I mean were you at any stage informed that there were difficulties when putting a serious question about a case which was to be brought to the government  for answer in the Da/il  that an official because of all of these difficulties and because of the uh Dickensian state of the  of the filing system at least in the office uh that  the official simply wouldn't be in a position  Uh given your own argument that you couldn't recollect the case because of workload and so on  so how could this official be  expected to state categorically  supposedly facts about a case which you then accepted as facts without question  Oh yeah  1 syll    Well I mean the the official would have to answer uh just how he went about getting together the information that enabled him to make that statement which turned out to be inaccurate  He will he will answer that for you I 'm sure  Uh I I don't know how but he he 'll answer the question and that 's a matter for him  I think that 's   3 sylls    But what 's  your own understanding of the workings of your office and how decisions were taken  how conclusions were reached   Well there 's I 've  I 've no  difficulty about how decisions were taken  I do take your point that that that the the facilities in the office for retrieving information uh by electronic means and by the use of computers and databases  that system is not there  That infrastructure is not in the office and uh and and that does  undoubtedly hamper a search such as that which was carried out by Mr Russell at my request  But did did you never uh see that as a difficulty up to this  You you you were three years in the office  I 'd never had a difficulty  I 'd I 'd never uh had that difficulty or that lack of  the absence of such a retrievable system had never turned up a difficulty for me before  Uhm uh and I  uh that 's all I can say uh   Can I ask a final question  One final question yes  1 syll   Can I go on Mr Whelehan to uhm the uh  you 've emphasised this morning that uh you you felt you had a majority of government supporting you  Uh you don't seem uh  to attach any importance to the fact that you were uh dealing with a partnership government  i  it seems to me that uhm  and I 'm trying to be objective as an independent I 've no axe to grind with anybody here  but it seems to me that the entire country was aware of the disquiet of the Labour section  the Labour partner in government about your uh proposed uh acceptance of of of the office  even to the extent that they they left government  they walked  they walked out of the Cabinet meeting  Why in those circumstances  in that   and that was a fairly long-running uh context  why did you persist and press ahead  knowing that the stability of the country and the   the stability of the   of the Government  was involved  was at stake  Why did you press ahead with uh your uh seeking of this office  Uh I I I  in a sense sought the office  I made myself available for the office and the Taoiseach indicated that he favoured the appointment and the position was that the majority of the Government favoured the appointment  No    Do you mean sorry can I   I don't wish to interrupt Chairman  But when  you you 've  used this term on a number of occasions  When you 're talking about uh a majority of the government are you talking about the Fianna Fa/il ministers  Yes  One partner  in a  partnership government  No but  well  I wanted  I 'm talking about that  but I 'm talking about the fact that no other minister in the Government  that I can identify expressed to me any reservation or any suggestion that I would not be a satisfactory person to be appointed to that position  Not one  So I  the only  the only influence that could have come to bear on me to declare that I was no longer interested would be newspaper reports attributed to the Ta/naiste uh and  some other members of the Labour party  But not once uh sir did anybody suggest to me that I was unsuitable for high office  judicial office  And it was said in some of these reports that I was a very good Attorney General and they hoped I 'd stay on as Attorney General  they 'd full confidence in me as Attorney General  But for some reason I was unsuitable uh or there were reservations about my suitability for this office  Now if such reservations existed I would think sir that it would be fair uh from any of the people who had reservations to come to me because on a personal level  I had the best of relations with them  And I believe still  still would have the best of relations with them  And I cannot understand to this day why none of them  whoever they were  came to me  the Ta/naiste or anybody else and looked me in the eye and said  we have a difficulty with you for the following reasons  pro  uh they could explain to me what the difficulty was  I would then of course consider it  But uh a vague  campaign if you like or a vague uh repetition of reservations in the press I found absolutely uh abhorrent and it was something to which I would not respond  uh while I accept your understanding that the uh  or your  inability to understand these reservations  surely it was clear to you that there was a serious difference between the two partners in government  that one partner wanted you  You were in effect the political candidate for Fianna Fa/il in that sense  The other partner in government  the Labour ministers did not want you  Regardless of what the reservations were  it was clear to the entire country that they did not want you as President of the High Court and yet you persisted  regardless  4 sylls   1 syll  can we Mr Whelehan just before you respond  I want to point out  this question has been asked on a number of occasions  It 's repetitive and I don't want it to go any further now so this is the last response and I then uh that 's  concluding Deputy Gregory 's questions  Your last response now and a brief response  several sylls  if I got an answer to it  Well the question has been asked on a number of occasions and I did ask at the beginning  I did not want repetition in relation to the questions  A brief reply now Mr Whelehan  If I was acceptable as Attorney General uh and  to the to the government  uh I think that prima facie  holding that position I must be acceptable for appointment to high judicial office  And I think it 'd be a very sad day for this country if there 's an Attorney General appointed to advise the government who does not have suitability to be appointed a Judge of the High Court  When did you acquire  ce  acceptable  3 sylls    And that concludes Deputy Gregory 's  questions now  I now call on Deputy Willie O'Dea Fianna Fa/il to put his questions to Mr Whelehan  Thank-you Mr Chairman  First of all I want to thank you for your attendance here today  Uhm when did the Smyth case first come to your attention   I 'm almost certain that the first time I became aware of the Smyth case was in a report in  the Sunday Independent of it would have been  if my days and dates are correct  the Sunday before the twenty-fifth of October  That 'd be Sunday the twenty-third of October uh and there was a large expose/-type front page uhm article on the subject under the by-line of  a journalist  whose name was  I think  Veronica Guerin  There was no way you could have known about the Smyth case prior to that  No  Because because the file was in the exclusive possession of Mr Russell  Correct  Uhm so therefore uh can I take it as logically following from that that nobody else  for example no member of the Government could have known about it  No  So therefore certain reports that appeared in certain sections of the media to the effect that the reason for the seven-month delay was that Fianna Fa/il ministers were trying to shelter a paedophile  Those reports  you 'd accept that those reports must be completely without foundation  Yes  You state uhm you 've stated in the preamble to your evidence today that you weren't greatly surprised that the Taoiseach didn't mention the Duggan case in his Tuesday speech  Why was that  That was because I had given a very clear account to Mr Fitzsimons spontaneously when he when he reminded me of the Duggan case  that the Duggan case was very much in ease of the allegations  I 'm sorry Mr Chairman I 'm repeating this answer but it 's  in a sense the question is a repeat of a question I 've been asked  The the emergence of the Duggan file gave the lie to the idea that there would be protection afforded to somebody because they were a Catholic clergyman in the office  and secondly  that the Duggan case did not require uh anything like an in-depth study of the extent or possible application of section fifty uh  of the Extradition Act nineteen eighty-seven  The the the Duggan case was a case where  as I think Mr Fitzsimons himself put it  had a perfunctory or casual or trivial or passing uh reference to the section  it did not involve a detailed consideration of the section  you are aware that there was difference of opinion  quite strong difference of opinion between Mr Russell in your office and the new Attorney General  mis  Mr Fitzsimons on the exact relevance of the Duggan case  Are you aware of that  I wasn't aware of that until these  proceedings  But I mean I 'm I 'm I 'm taken by the fact that when I heard that  i  it 's  I don't know what significance it will have for the Committee but it seems to me that I in my own home on the Monday was taking very much the same view of the Duggan case as Mr Russell is supposed to have taken when he was talking with Mr Fitzsimons  Uh and I gave that view uh uh without ever having had contact with Mr Russell about the Duggan case or the  or the Smyth case since I left the office  Uh we both apparently on the same day on the Monday  in different locations  when told about the Duggan case by Mr Fitzsimons  came to broadly similar views as to its relevance  Yes   So therefore there was a difference of opinion  a fairly fundamental difference of opinion about the relevance of the Duggan case between Mr Fitzsimons on the one side and yourself and Mr Russell uh on the other side  That would be a fair  a fair estimation   4 sylls    Yes and when  I gave to Mr Fitzsimons my interpretation of the Duggan case and its its lack of relevance in the context of the Smyth case  he didn't uh  he didn't argue a different point of view with me  And he took on board the two points which I made and he agreed that he would convey to the Taoiseach as I asked him to do  my attitude to the Duggan case  and I gave him a letter uh the following morning recounting what I had said to him  uh just for the record and I 'm very pleased that I did  And that 's the letter which I read to you gentlemen uh this morning when the Committee first sat
