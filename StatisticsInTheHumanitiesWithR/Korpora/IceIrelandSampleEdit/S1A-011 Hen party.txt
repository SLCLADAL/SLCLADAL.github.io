<S1A-011 Hen party>  When I was when I was in Rome like quite a lot of people thought I was American and I 'm like  no  I didn't really  1 syll  English  A lot of people thought I was South  African  South African or Australian I got when I was in America  But this oul one came into the shop where I worked  This was the reason I put on a Yankee accent  Darling sweetie I know you 're speaking English but I just can't understand a word you 're saying  Three people three people thought I sounded American   That 's when you get friends that sort of you know substitute it really really badly after like  five minutes in a different country  And you 're like  what 're you doing  Stop it   Oh that was  me  I was so Yank when I was over there  I was terrible  I was like hi how 's it going ma'am  Aww so cheesy  And you wonder why people laugh at you and point  laughter   Exactly  Well I 've gotten over that at this stage  Don't worry  We 'll we 'll try to bring back that pain and that memory   Could it be the glasses  Could it be that I 'm small  Could it be the like you know  that dandruff issue that I still have going on  you know   You should  use Head and Shoulders instead  It doesn't work girl  It does not work  I 'm just that person  What about a bottle of bleach  Uh I 've  uh I 've thought of it  I 've thought of it  You know shave my head completely and  Oh did you do a Sinead  Mm  Did you do a Sinead  Was that was that your dandruff solution  a Sinead  No actually never ever see it 's really weird I do actually have really bad dry scalp right but uh  I was the only one of the three girls who was ever allowed to have long hair  Which is really cos I really I know it doesn't look but it 's like I 've really  thin hair  really thin kind of hair  It 's not thick   Why was that   Why was that   Cos you were only  Cos my two sisters had like that was like really black and dark and thick  It was like  out to here when they let it grow  It was like you have to  comb it   No woman  no cry hair  Yeah it 's the kind of person people that when you brush their hair like a million of them in the hair brush like you get like so no chance of ever going bald kind of hair styles  And my mam was just couldn't handle having to clean the hair and having to big long hair  Mine doesn't fall out  Yeah  Really but it 's really thin and  manageable  And I kind of looked bald for so long  And I was so bald  I was nearly bald til I was three so my mam was like grow you hair long  So she never cut it  So I was the only one of the three of us who actually was allowed long hair  Yeah   So did you not use that super strength shampoo that was like    not at all   Will kill  all known germs dead  laughter   No no  And it costs ten pound a bottle   I used nothing  uh no  I used nothing that uhm the other two couldn't  cos everything was communal including our clothes  bath water  laughter  you know   Bath  water  laughter   Yeah  Your bath water was communal  laughter   Yes literally in a fight to see who 'd have the first bath on a Saturday night because the  water wasn't changed in between   Have you have you  ever seen the episode of The Young Ones when Neil is the last one to have a bath  No  It was so funny  laughter   What was it like  Thick   It 's like it 's like  it 's like black grunge and dirt  And he 's like yeah I wondered where that went to  And he lifts his bike out of the bath  laughter  That was what your family was like wasn't it wasn't it  Literally it was actually yeah  And we solved  we used to have a row to see who 'd have the first bath and then we 'd be we 'd be tripping down the stairs in our pyjama bottoms  just like Fame because Fame was always on   Did you used to like take straws for the last  for the last bath  Always on  No Fame was always  on   Did youse  all try to be Leroy  I loved Fame  It was my favourite favourite ever  And and we used to always it was our biggest bath our bath night  was always Fame night  And we were like  being good Irish Catholics we always had to have a bath on Saturday cos we went to Mass on Sunday morning  We couldn't go dirty to Mass  Long did that not last  3 sylls  my father the biggest atheist  alien-believing man on the planet  Have to admit when I was away the best idea was Mass on a Saturday  It was just like so fantastic  laughter   Oh I hated it  to be honest like I 'm I 'm I 'm a wee Protestant  2 sylls  so I don't like know anything  And they were like going what 's this  Is this Mass  And everyone 's like no this is the Angelists  So what do you do  You sit there  Do you not sing  It was all in a different language  laughter  We didn't have a fucking clue what  was going on   Really  What language was it in  Was it Latin  It was Latin  And then we were just like we sort of did the  starts singing  ah ah ah ah ah  end of singing  and then we went  there 's only so many times we could do ah ah ah   No cos I know whenever I watch Emmerdale  or  weddings on English television ever I always think well see well I live in Dublin  several sylls  My two best friends in school were like uhm didn't even   2 sylls   originally  It 's okay  You don't need to you don't need to say it  It 's alright   I just don't want  to bring it up because like  like it just makes me feel uncomfortable to chat about it  It was really funny right  laughter  Cara was like uhm  Who  Cara my friend at school  Right  Sound as a pound grand lovely  But Violet Halstead right obviously these two girls are Protestant right but whatever  But Violet was really funny  She was real like  and in our church and in our church and in our church  Fucking ever heard in our church ever again I was gonna like stuff it down her throat  with her orange   Did you beat her  to death with a spoon  No but it was really our church our church  We used to think it was so funny though cos we 'd a Protestant Chaplain in our school as well as a Catholic one right  So when we were doing religion class they were doing religion class as well like  And uhm  but your woman in anyway Miss Peterson  And her name 's Mary right  Because there was only like say seven of them in their class and there were like thirty in our class  they were allowed call her  Mary  And Mary went to their church  So they already knew Mary  We were like oh for fuck sake like Jesus  And you 'd meet her in the corridor and they 're like hi Mary  And I 'm like big teacher pet bitches ugh  You know as if it didn't happen  I was going it was like teachers  us teachers teachers Newman   blah   Privileged   Did she  do that while she was in her prime  with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody  laughter   Anyway it was  just so  Her and her girls   My girls would never do that on me  My only  encounter with people that were but  And I 've never but Cara was in my class still in primary school  And we made our communion and our confirmation and I sat beside Cara  And it never even  occurred  Cara like  And uh it never even occurred to me that she was or wasn't was or wasn't making or doing the same as us because  there was no way she was a weirdo  Like she never felt left out and we never felt like the oh weirdo  Cos there was Mormons like  I 've cousins who actually 're  Jehovah  Witnesses like  That 's a whole different family issue  But uh they are in it like  It doesn't bother me  Like cos I do not consider myself that 's what I was saying earlier on about getting married it 's like I uhm  I was saying about my Dad  You know when the Matrix came out first right  I only watched it  this is gonna sound so freaky and so obviously why we and all my family are doing science right  My Dad is uhm he 's very he 's not he wouldn't be extremely well-educated like he did an apprenticeship  And he 's read a hell of a lot of books a hell of a lot of stuff like you know  He 'd know enough to have a conversation and stuff  And as the years 've gone on he probably hasn't read as much  We probably know as much but for his day he was a very well-read person  And uhm think he read a lot of books about like you know psychology and  you know  mental things and aliens and like you know different theories and religions  several sylls  And one of his best friends from where he worked ended up being uhm  a bishop in a Mormon church like converted over like  And his other best friend  several sylls  the army in the Air Corps actually  And uh as I say he shared a room with like one two three four five six there was six of them in one room  Beside who  later in conversation   We should do the Irish  the Irish version of the Matrix  It 'd be so funny  laughter   Have you ever seen I have this thing on the internet it 's called the Moo Matrix  No  It 's two cows have a fight  and they 're like using their udders doing Matrix-style like shooting milk from their udders like and  2 sylls  gun bullets the matrix going  makes whooshing noise  But it 's like looks like a real live two cows having this martial art fight and using their udders as bullets like churning milk and butter out  And it 's just  funniest thing ever  Aw and like other  Very strange  Other aws are like real  makes moo noise   Did they  makes 'maaw' sound  or like  moo moo moo   Yeah it 's a real moo
