several sylls  He used to be bent away down  he used to be head on the floor and all you know like  Aye it used to be he always into the keep-fit here  He 's not he 's not the one that takes uh over

that too  I was down there on Monday night  too but there wasn't any of them around except uh   Forgot to pay youse for it on Sunday  simultaneous and unclear speech   Sure we all got our letters  Did you not get a letter  I didn't  sure I don't go into it  If youse were doing a collection I 'd give you something  Jesus this is this Christmas over  I 'm talking I 'm not talking about the hamper  I 'm talking about the chair  Youse were going to get a Don Bosco  chair   Not at all  No  Not a wee chair  Sure if somebody 's drunk walk into it piss on it or something  laughter  later on tape   Well I don't know what all they need done  Now they do need  they do need a   Thon carpet is bad  But if they had uh what do you call it some of the chairs cleaned and why they bought them  why they bought them uh covered  upholstered in yon light colour beats me  But it didn't even tone in with the carpet  Well the chairs and the kneelers are very sharp   But the thing is why worry because it 's your money her money my money going into it  And it 's faded anyway   That 's right  And as you say the winos could come in and piddle on it and  that 's it   They piddle  they 've piddled on that carpet and everything else  And then those kneelers which are kneelers  and  then and eighty percent of the people that go in there use them as footrests  Aye   They do  I 've seen young fellas  a big young fella and I I was in there on whatever day it was  and there he was the size twelves the big trainers  And you know he was tall fella  And he 's sitting back here on the chair and he 's the big size twelves are plonked on the kneeler  And he 's going on  reading   Sure they do that on the buses too they do  They plonk their feet up on the seats and people are expected to sit on them  Well wait til I tell you  when I was working in all these educational professions that  I  worked  with  and the coffee tables are down in the staff  room  Sure I was  they 'd no breeding  They 're  sitting drinking  coffee with their feet up on the coffee tables  Aye   Yeah   Yeah   Desperate yeah   Uh-huh yeah  That 's what  uh-huh  th  th  th  they don't care  If it 's not their own they don't care   And I said that there to this  one one day  I said to her you know there 's very few  very little manners no breeding  She says we 're not a lot of  horses  because I said breeding  Mhm   Aye uh-huh  Oh aye yes uh-huh  I was going to say  no you 're well-shoed but  laughter   Uhm Anna for Ardoyne  they should get uh money for restoration  purposes you know because  historical and then heritage or whatever   But they are they are you can get so much but there 's so much  there 's so much to be done   Aye  He has  But you see the thing June  the thing  he says I feel I 've been sent here for a purpose  Father Collins didn't give a piss  He let the Ardoyne  Hall run down and he deprived us all of the Ardoyne because we have  classes and all now   Well the thing is you 'd have made money  too if you 'd bingo or something on  And that 's so run down  that  th  insurance wouldn't insure it  Uh-huh   Aye simultaneous and unclear speech   Did you say it was opened again but closed again  Aye but it was  we were just sitting talking in Bridget Miller 's last  night  as we are now  And uh uh the  somebody says about the insurance  s  I says and Bridget Miller says  but why was it allowed to run down so much  Aye   Aye  Uh-huh   Uh-huh   How did this rector appear out of nowhere and open it  Aye I know   Yeah   Because the people rallied round him  Yeah   Uh-huh   Uh-huh   And Bridget Miller for instance got a huge  top of the working kitchen  and  of course  as usual  the fella put about six foot under that wasn't needed  and  she was left with a shelf  you know a cabinet  What am I going to do with that  All she did  went up to the men working in the hall and says can you use that  They came down with a van and put it up where they were having their wee bar and tea  bar  You know things like that  And it ended up it was a hundred and thirty in the Ardoyne Hall last Friday to have a dinner  And that was to make money  And that  was the centenary dinner  Aye   Yeah   Yeah   Aye  uh-huh   Yeah   I was going to go and then I didn't go it being the Centenary  This man comes along and he puts a bit of effort   4 sylls    Well you see that 's what it is uh-huh   The other man couldn't have cared less  No  Some people are not leaders you see they 're not  But they take your money simultaneous and unclear speech   The bleeding nuns 'll do the same  I know they do  name  nuns are always the worst of the lot because the nuns  any nuns have no sense of value  of money   Well I think it would be more like a chapel if they put in  benches you know like  the pews that they have  You know like the college down there  Now I think it 's a lovely wee chapel  you know with nice pews  Maybe that 's what they have in mind  Sure you don't know what they have  All the people  all they want to do is like  take your money and they 'll do  there 's no suggestions  no nothing  no bother  Sure Sister Maria had like has  what do they call that  several sylls   several sylls   Sure she has that bucked out the back of the chapel and everybody 's turning round looking to see  Aye that 's right simultaneous and unclear speech   One of the priests  there was a visiting priest here one day  He didn't go down   asked for somebody to bring it up  Uh-huh   Wal  Wallace never used it either  Is that right  Well who done that  wa  that was Maria  Yeah  Sure everybody   I never  you turned round  Mm  Well all she 's to do is lift that  no  it 's not fixed is it  No but it 's not a matter of that  It was put there because of one bucking nun 's decision  And right enough it 's odd it 's an odd place to have  it isn't it   It is   And everybody turns  several sylls  oh there 's Molly Murphy  There 's only two practical points that I see in it  And one is yes in this day and age everywhere should be accessible to  uh the  disabled handicapped  whatever whatever  And the second point is it 's badly in need of  a carpet  something done or whatever  Now they couldn't put a wooden one in because you 'd just get a wet day and coming in there  and elderly people would go skidding on  their heads in it   Wheelchairs   They need to get those uh  carpet tiles and if they are destroyed they can be lifted  Aye at the door bit  That 's right  Sure those alcoholics could come into thon corner and they twist up and twist down that much  You know what I mean  Sure nobody 's there uh uh during the day that would stop them doing that Louise  Would you go over  Would you go over   But sure you can't stop them  They piddle over  What do you call him  Mike told me one day I was up and your wee man came in and he was really going berserk  And Mike got up  get him out  get him out  get him out  Somebody else was feeling you know they were feeling you know quite uh  uh  shouldn't be doing that and Mike came in again and just said to this man  he says uhm  I didn't want to be saying  several sylls  he says until I got him out  He says you should have seen the state of this place he says earlier on  Mm you shouldn't  Aye uh-huh   Aye  He says he started from the back  up there and he says he soiled that place and in there and he says  I just don't mean that he wet the place  he says it was unbelievable he says now  but they had a tackle to get that cleaned up  Well I mean if a man was going to stand and piss on you would you go up and say stop piddling  laughter  He 'd turn and piddle on you  If he was in that mood he would have piddled on you  Do you know those  Pat McCartan and I threw him out  Aye  Pat McCartan and me because he was going  this  several sylls  We near lifted the two  And he sang  That 's when he gets really  bad you know he 's desperate   You know what he did  He went to my car and he swung on my mirror to try and break my mirror off  They 're vicious you see  Aye  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  What were you going to say  No do you know that  the one  you know Bridget and the the one that used to be down there you know Bridget that died you know the two alcoholics  Bridget  and her boyfriend  Well her boyfriend went into a confessional up in Saint John 's and did the same thing  Oh aye   Uh-huh right right  Aye  Just used it as a toilet later on tape   Do you remember the other alcoholic used to go in with the ginger hair  What 's this you called him  He 's a big nice  Aye he was nice  Was he an accountant  The big  very handsome well-dressed  well-dr  It was uh-huh  McCloone  McCloone   And he used to talk  he used to talk to the  talk to Jesus  Aye uh-huh  I remember him  And he used to says things awful spiritual  He did  aye   Uh-huh   And awful good  But he his wife died there or there was something  Oh aye  Uh-huh  He was in the doctor 's one time when I was there in he says  you know he says  I 'm up for grabs  laughter   Aye  Did he die  That 's what I was wondering  Did he die   But he was  mind you  I think somebody told me he   He was a good-looking man whenever he cos  I remember being in about  say at from about seven to eight or something you  know  in a Holy Hour  and  wherever he was going or what  he had come in and oh Lord here 's me to myself  oh thank God he must be off the drink  and  like you know clean-shaven  and all  But I 'll tell you he would have come  he would have come out with  he would have come out with thoughts and all that you wouldn't have thought if you 'd even been reading them from a text  Uh-huh   Aye   Aye   Aye uh-huh   He used just to stand and talk to the Blessed Sacrament  and  he 'd give you a spiritual exercise  That 's right
