<S2A-055 Pastry>  First things first  Going to make pastry today  Shortcrust pastry  You have half the quantity of fat to flour  So there 's a little note at the top there  fa  flan cakes  and I have six ounces of  flour and I use self-raising flour  Or you can use half self-raising flour and half plain flour if you want  Or just use plain flour if you 've always used that  I just tend to use self-raising flour  It does rise ever so slightly but makes a slightly lighter pastry I always think  Uhm and half the quantity of that  interruption  I think last  no a couple of years ago  do you remember Sister Teresa 's last year  I started  sh  she always said you could taste the the raising agents in the flour so  and after she said that I started to taste it  And there is a slight  you know  there is a different taste  A man on a galloping horse I don't know if he 'd really notice you know  But if you  if you make pastry at home stick to what you use if you 're doing an apple tart because it 's the same type of pastry  It 's the same type of pastry that you use in savoury pastry also if you 're going to do a quiche and if you 're going to do uhm a savoury mince pie say  The only thing is is that you can add a  uhm a dessertspoonful of castor sugar or icing sugar into this pastry to make it  slight  a little bit sweeter  which just gives it a nice little edge  You can use butter  you can use Churn which is a combination of cream and margarine vegetable oils or you can just use uh the margarine that you use all the time  If you use butter naturally you 'll get a different flavour because butter does give things a lovely flavour  There 's no doubt about it  I 'm using butter because I had uhm I  Mace didn't have a  they haven't had any Churn in for the past couple of days and uhm this was on offer actually Dromona in Mace  the Mace sort for ninety-nine pence which is excellent  noise from audience  I was in Lidl  pronounced L-EYE-DL  pronounced L-ID-L  pronounced L-ID-L  Lidl  pronounced L-EYE-DL  and uhm  I I picked up some of their butter and is it one nineteen  noise from audience  And of course it 's sitting in the fridge and I forgot it  audience discussion  So I 'll just wash my hands and we 'll get going  I 've set  I already put the oven on  set it for two hundred  That oven 's working a bit slow  But if you 're making anything with uhm pastry  if you turn your oven up and put your product in  in a hot oven for even for the first fifteen minutes  ten fifteen minutes  it sets the pastry  gi  makes it gives it a good blast of heat and then what happens it sets it I always think you get a nice sort of uhm  cru  well not a crust on it  It doesn't go  you know crunchy but it just sets it so and then you can lower the temperature to cook the fruit or the meat or whatever you you 're cooking  So normally if I was doing an apple tart I 'd put it in for about fifteen minutes at two hundred degrees centigrade and I have a fan-assisted oven at home  And then what I would do is turn it right down to about uhm  oh about a hundred and sixty and leave it in there for thirty-five minutes or forty minutes really at that  in  but initially that first blast of heat sets  what I would call  sets the pastry  It 's a bit like a Christmas cake  putting the Christmas cakes in at a high temperature  It it it it sets the top of the cake  gives it a nice uhm outer coating let 's say  I wouldn't say crust because you don't want a crust  audience discussion  Any questions so far  Everyone happy   now  Now you can do pastry either by using the rubbing-in method with your fingertips or you can use the food processor  If you use the food processor just pop in your fat  in your flour and pop it in and whiz it up and it churns it up a bit  you can also then add an egg  instead of adding water to it to bind it together you can put an egg in it which gives you a richer pastry  And uhm let 's just turn it out  The knack is  is don't have it whizzing about too much cos then you 're going to overwork the flour  the gluten in the flour  and you 'll get stretchy uh pastry  Leathery pastry  And it has that look on it  uh a stretched look to it even whenever it 's cooked  And it 's really  I think it 's it 's down to a trained eye  the more you make uh pastry and even cakes you you 'll notice these little things  It 's like if you get your ingredients uhm slightly knocked out in cake making you 'll get a different texture of cake  and uh you know the crumbliness of it whenever you cut it can look it also look parched  with the amount of holes  the texture of it  And that 's maybe you get up to the uhm examining levels and entering all your things in for shows  That 's what the examiner 's looking for  no  your presentation yes and things like that but actually it 's the the the texture of it the you know whether you it 's been overworked and one thing and another  And remember whenever we were making scones I sort of said if you ever  if you 're ever wanting to impress give give your visitors the scones you make in the first cut-out because they 're always  the re-rolls have that different look about them and it 's the same with pastry  Actually the first thing you roll out you should actually put that aside to leave it for your top  But what would you be doing  psychologically  oh quick get another plate  you know we 've got to get the filling in  But try and remember to leave that to the side  you know  and then use the next bit underneath for the bottom  Because nobody ever sees the bottom  And in my place whenever you sometimes have to do a patchwork quilt on the top  I 'm not going to say any more  So uhm I I I 'm going to make it by in the food processor but I 'll wait because I 'll do the next time the pastry  I 'll do it in the  stumbles over words  the food processor  and I 'll stick an egg in it and uhm to make it nice and rich  So into our basin  I 've got a pound of self-raising flour already measured out  And I 'm going to add eight ounces of  If you 're using fat straight out of the fridge or out of the freezer and it 's very very hard  use uh use uh a grater and grate it and it means that it 'll mix in uhm  Right there we are  So I 've got eight ounces of fat  several sylls   Just use the largest size the grater  on the grater  and  there we are you can see it comes through little strands  Oh I 'm daft  laughs  Typical of me  Oh gosh there 's not an awful lot of flour  I 've put on the the uhm the box that had half a pound of flour in so I 'll take half of this  Me talking too much again  Oh last week you 'd have roared  Well I well I wasn't roaring  laughs  I was nearly crying  We did muffins last week  as you remember  su  the summer fruit muffins  And on Wednesday the the the girl that 's the manager up in the Holy Trinity Family Centre had been on the course and she 's got a package with uhm  one of those uhm automatic the plugs with the timers on it  And then there was a a thing that you connected to the front door and as soon as the door was opened it let out sort of high-pitched wail  It had uh a personal alarm system which you could either pull from above if you 're being attacked you know that sort of thing  There 's about five things in a pack all for ten pounds  And of course she was demonstrating these and it was wailing and these things were going off and you know that horrible pitch  speech muffled by audience  and I 'm busy doing my muffins at the same time but you know having a nosy at at  she was displaying them at the side of the  och Mary went along to pop these muffins in and got onto the second batch and lo and behold what did I  what had I forgotten to put in  The raising agent  The baking powder  Och if you 'd seen them  laughter  They were like little bricks  laughter  And somebody said och don't worry we 'll eat them  laughter  I says you couldn't eat those  and fair enough oh they were as hard as anything  But if you do want to use that recipe next uhm for the muffins  just use self-raising flour  It 's easier  I tend to try and  sometimes I change the recipe too to  make life easier for myself but then other times I sort of stick to what the recipe says  several sylls  Right  My grated butter and I 'm just going to rub it in  Just using your fingertips  Just rub it through the flour  It doesn't take  very long when you grate it  Until you 've got a mixture that resembles fine breadcrumbs  And as I say if you do have a food processor and it is handy to make pastry in in your food processor  Now I want to add  I 'm going to add a little caster sugar cos sometimes the pastry  sweet pastry for sweet dishes  it is nice just to have a little sweetness in  So about a dessertspoonful  which is only about half an ounce  And for those of you that can't  have to watch the old sugar intake  just don't put it in at all  You know that  It 's quite alright when you bake and cook but just reduce all your sugar right down and don't add extra sugar you know if you 're diabetic and things like that  Now just make a well in the centre  bowl and I 'm going to add  going to add about six dessertspoonfuls of water  So it 'll take quite a bit  interruption from audience  And we 'll just  mix this  Now another reason why your pastry will end up like leather is if you put too much water in  Six ounces of flour would roughly do  you know  if you 're very  you know I should say six ounces because it gives you a little bit to play with  If you were used to making a lot of pastry you know four would be enough for that sort of seven-inch plate really  But if you have any pastry left over you can make a few jam tarts  Now there 's still a few breadcrumbs down at the bottom but if I add more water it 'll make it very  make it too wet and then of course I 'll have to add more flour to absorb the extra uhm liquid  And there 's nothing wrong with that  tha  that happens to us all  But once you get to that stage you know  forget about the spoon or the spatula that you 've been mixing and start using your hands  And just knead the flour together  and bring all the little bits in the bowl into the main centre bowl  And then  and there we are  It comes  comes together  And then what you can do is just give it a quick little knead on a lightly dusted flour board  and that 's another thing  The more flour you use on your board the more flour you 're putting into your pastry  so then you 're upsetting the balance of the the quantity of flour to fat  ha  half-and-half you know  interruption  It happens to us all the first time we use a food processor  You get carried away you have it there and you 're whizzing at it  Oh this is wonderful  And the blades 's whizzing around at such a speed and it 's working away at the flour you know  laughs  And it comes out and you really just have  it 's like a shortbread cos it 's  interruption  You just sometimes just have to put it into your uhm  your flan tin and just use your hands and work it round  It 's very very soft  So right  So that 's our our pastry  Now if we have time  pop it into a polythene bag  flatten it out a little bit more  and pop it into your fridge and rest it for an hour  to even to get it a bit cooler what I would do is flatten it out  put it into your bag and pop it into your freezer for fifteen minutes and turn it after you know seven minutes or so on one side and the heat gets  the cold  the cold uhm gets to  several sylls  It 's just whenever you 're making pastry keep everything cool  you know uhm and and that gives you better pastry at the end of the day  You stay cool  the pastry 'll stay cool  It 's like everything we do  if it starts going wrong  laughter  everything falls apart and we 've all had days like that  I actually think you make the best pastry whenever you 're under pressure
