<S1A-053 Student grants 1>  One plant  One plant  That 's it  They killed my other one   We killed it   Oh girls   I didn't kill it  It was probably a cactus or something  No no it wasn't  But do you know what its name was   What  Mairead   it got a name   Well thank-you very much  laughter  How could you name a plant Mairead   I didn't  It never even had a name  It had  Oh it did yeah because it was a yellow chrysanthemum  It was lovely  It was really  brightened up the place   Oh thank-you very much  I 'm impressed   It was a beautiful plant   Mairead  yeah  But somebody killed it on me    I didn't   I didn't  laughs   You done  You killed it  But not deliberately  She put  a plastic bag on it   What did you do that for  laughter   I 'm bringing up a spider plant from home  I won't go near it  Why did you put a plastic bag on a plant  Because I was going away for two weeks and I was afraid that it would die from lack of water so I put a bag on it so it would condense so it 'd die of lack of oxygen  laughs   Ah well it 's probably a nicer way to go actually  laughs   There was a hole in the bag  It could breathe you know  Well you forgot to tell it obviously  laughs   Yeah the poor plant  Biscuit  Hmmm   brought lots of biscuits   Yeah they 're not the nutty ones though   Oh you should taste the nutty ones  They 're gorgeous  Ah  Sorry they 're not them  laughs   We 'll all cry  Mmm mmm  How 's Roisin  Have you seen her since  Uhm  she 's gone away off home and she won't be in  Well she won't be in tomorrow anyhow for clinic  I don't know then  It depends on how she 's feeling on Friday  The doctor just said it went into spasm and that was all  She was in an awful state  She was yeah  yeah   What happened  to her  Sorry someone please explain  Something happened to her in Twohey 's wasn't it  And she just moved suddenly  all that it is Janie it 's muscular spasm but  It 's literally from being bent over and constant writing  The poor girl  background noise   And she kept saying it doesn't feel like a spasm  I don't know what  A spasm feels like  Yeah and I don't  know what she had visioned but she reckoned this wasn't what a spasm would feel like  I mean I never had   That 's right  I don't know what  I think the girl thought she was dying at one stage  Like it was really bad  She yeah  she was in an  awful state   Yeah   God love her  Hmm  God love her  Yeah I think she was scared  I don't know  So would you be there  Around your neck especially  Specially when you hear so many things about  You know people are telling you about this getting stuck and  2 sylls  you die  And what really scared her then was she went to kind of put her arm forward and the arm locked on her  although I think she thought then  That she was dying  laughs  Yes  Oh God love us  Yeah  Sorry did she choke or something  laughter  No honestly  Did you not see her keel over in the lecture no  her   laughs   Well you could have explained it to me  How did you miss that  Sure isn't spasm  Her neck  What does that mean  Her neck muscles have all gone locked later in tape   No it 's nothing like a cramp  It 's like uhm  Sit very close  Uhm what 's it like  If you 've not had it it 's really kind of hard to  explain it  It 's like something kind of just going  so tight that you can't actually move  You know that it it just locks  You  know if you ever get something locked  Right   Yeah  I suppose like an extremely bad cramp  But it just doesn't really go  But does it hurt  It just comes on you  all of a sudden   Very painful  Yeah it 's painful  laughs   That 's what I wanted to know  Oh it 's very painful  She was nearly crying  wasn't she   She was  actually when we were walking over to the uhm that clinic place   did you say   What did they say  Come back in a week   No you see cos I went up I said to her I  I 've not ever been in the place before  Well I 'd kind of gone in but I 'd not ever had to see anybody and  she kind of said oh sure we 'll probably be waiting here for hours  So I said no we won't  Don't be silly  And she goes oh  you 'd often   Oh   Oh you cow  laughter   What 's wrong  She didn't put the bag back in the bin  and she dropped a teabag on her toe  Oh I thought ye had mice or something  Sorry Janie  Is it burnt  I 'm alright  I 'm really sorry   Finish your story  laughter  I get very frustrated  No so we went in and we  Roisin said to me oh  will you go up to the receptionist  So I said  Sorry

and Language Department in Pearse Street and  thanks a mill  uhm the head of department has asked us to come over  laughs   That was a bit of a lie wasn't it  No it wasn't  Yeah  She would have done if she  knew how badly Roisin was   And if she was there   laughter   Hmm I was only  giving her credit  Roisin was there  Roisin 's face  no thanks  Roisin 's face was really funny  And she looked  they took you in straight away interruption in recording   Fairly fast  But they were nice enough though  They were alright really  Who were  2 sylls   I don't know  some woman  The

bit  Oh year   Oh sorry I 'm going home for the weekend  I thought that 's what  you were talking about sorry   Sorry finish off that discussion   No I 'm looking forward to  my Christmas

laughter   And then my money ran out so I banged down the phone and said shit  And come here to me uhm  is it just yours that 's being held up or is all of that area not through  No I think it 's just mine and all the first years  But you know why yours isn't held  up like   Yeah because college  didn't send in the letter  Yeah cos Peg 's is not through  Really   Really   laughs   I swear to God  I swear I 'm not lying   She really didn't   Hers is probably the  same  They didn't send  it in for ages   No you see  because  I don't know because  like we get  ours is kind of different to yours because you know I was saying that to you we get uhm  kind of forms out that you have to send back in saying that they send you a form out saying oh we are renewing your grant for this year  and fill in the form  And we send the form back in  you know so  Oh do ye do that  Yeah we do that too   We do that though in about like next February like it 'll arrive now at home

doesn't it  It happens   Yeah it does  yeah  Yeah during like the springtime  No what happens is that it comes uhm say mine came  I suppose  mid-September  Oh  And you must send the form that
