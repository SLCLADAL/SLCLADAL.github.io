<S2A-010 Clinton - Daly>  Paul I swear you can almost touch the excitement here at this City Hall  I mean the scenes here are quite amazing  No matter what direction you look all you can see are people  Eamonn Holmes has just given an estimate that there are fifty thousand people here  I think that 's way off beam  very conservative estimate  It seems to me that there 's probably nobody watching us at the moment because the gang 's all here  One person who 's not here just yet  Bill Clinton  he 's on his way  he 'll be very  very soon he 'll be here  But in the meantime there 's been a star-spangled warm-up bill for our star-spangled Bill  We 've had John Anderson 's Big Band rounding off a very big day for John Anderson cos as we all know  he 's the director in UTV  And he 's been calling the shots in our coverage of Bill Clinton 's visit before rushing down here to become the main attraction himself  We 've had Kieran Goss  from Rostrevor  Curtis Stigers is on behind me now  we 're waiting for Van the Man and possibly  that sax duet with the President  The rumour factory 's also been working overtime here  Barbara Streisand 's supposed to be here  Paul Newman  I 'm just waiting for Elvis and Lord Lucan to come on for a duet  But only minutes away from the President 's arrival  so we 're all looking forward to it here so I 'll hand you back to the studio later in broadcast   Well those are the uh pictures that are live at the moment from the City Hall  the John Anderson Big Band playing there and putting people in the mood  And we are still waiting for the star of tonight 's show to arrive  Uh I 'm not sure if he 's actually back in Belfast yet  I 'm sure he must be at this stage  And uh when he arrives into the centre of Belfast he is going to see the biggest crowd of his trip to Ireland so far  Uh those are just remarkable pictures to see the crowd stretching all the way back to Castle Junction there  And uhm those people will have difficulty if they 're trying to see the President through the naked eye  but I do understand that there are big screen monitors all around the whole area  So even though they may be some distance from the action at the front of the City Hall  they will be able to see everything that 's happening on the big screen  You will be able to see it at home as well and uh can I just tell you that if you were expecting to see your favourite programmes you 're not going to miss them  Uh we 're staying on air until a quarter past seven  maybe half past seven and uh after this programme we 'll be joining Emmerdale and you will also see The Bill  uhm tonight 's movie Unlawful Entry you will see at nine o'clock as well  Now it means that the pictures we had hoped to show you live from the Whitla Hall at Queen 's University we will be incorporating into a UTV Live special between half past ten and eleven o'clock tonight  So uh there is uh an undoubted air of expectation and anticipation at the front of the City Hall this evening as we wait for the President of the United States to uh arrive  Ken Reid  the  these are spectacular scenes  This has been a remarkable day  I mean Bill Clinton has come in today and I think he 's touched the population  His message has been so powerful  I have to say that many people were expecting this would be an economic day or a day of economic announcements  It 's been a very political day for peace  He said that the the time for guns  that 's over  He wants everybody to show the courage  to go ahead and to back peace  Uh it 's also uh I think the fact that he visited the Shankill and the Falls  he met the SDLP leader John Hume  he paid great tribute to John Hume  tonight he 'll meet David Trimble and uh he 'll  in fact we hear that David Trimble will be in the car with Bill Clinton leaving the Whitla Hall  Uh he will also meet Gerry Adams again  he 's already shaken hands with him  we 've seen that  So really in political terms Bill Clinton is playing a blinder  And of course he like everybody else would have been touched today by the comments of those two children who read from their letters at Mackie 's this morning  Well I think that  we were saying earlier today  the theme of this has been  to politicians and the people here of the current generation  get on with it  Uh and he 's used the image of children the whole day to show that well it 's this generation we 're talking about  Give a future for your children  It 's been very impressive  Uh I think that nobody could help but be moved by the images that we saw in Mackie 's factory this morning  And of course those are images which uh do not just appeal to a Northern Ireland audience but they would have gone right round the world  I mean  uh one of the things to remember is that this is also aimed at Bill Clinton coming into an election and uh this is really the start of his election campaign  And I have to say the polls in the States show that he has actually a very good chance of being re-elected  Probably better now  Of course the danger with backing something like Northern Ireland is what happens if the thing falls down in the future  So there is a political calculation  Yes okay we can join uh Eamonn Holmes  uh he used to work at UTV with us  now uh GMTV  uh as he brings the people of the City Hall up to date with what 's happening next later in broadcast   Well as we see  the President is now arriving out at the front of the City Hall  John Anderson is going to be cut short this time  Ken what do you reckon  Well I see that Bill Clinton 's coming with uh Eric Smyth who of course is the Lord Mayor of Belfast  very proud moment for him  And Bill Clinton  he 's had an ecstatic reception in Derry and now here in Belfast he 's uh thousands of people  Ivan uh Little said that Eamonn Holmes had said fifty thousand it appears from here anyway  to be much more than that  So it 's uh really a case that Belfast is out in force to welcome Bill Clinton  Truly truly incredible and like a true musician that he is himself he let the band finish   Big day for John Anderson as well  It is yes  Working with you today  That 's right  laughter  Again we see as we have all day the uh  several words  presidential party goes on stage  You 'll notice here that the glass screen has been erected in front of the City Hall  This is some idea of the security precautions that have been taken  Five inches thick I believe  So they say  But uh I don't think it 's affecting anyone 's enjoyment from what we see  And here he is again  Bill Clinton  the man of the people today Eric Smyth speaks, Bill Clinton speaks   Well the Clintons there leaving the stage with uh the Lord Mayor  Eric Smyth  They 're heading off to the Whitla Hall where there is a large political gathering for dinner  They will be uh sitting anxiously waiting because the uh President is running over time  Meeting a few people in the crowd on the way through  but I think it was a very very momentous day and uh tremendous speech once again by the President who must by this stage be absolutely exhausted  Well that is an absolute security man 's nightmare there Ken  Recognise a few famous faces in the crowd there too  I see a few journalists that I would know  But I mean  let  let 's uh just reflect for a minute  I mean uh this is fantastic stuff really  well you can see the reaction  But I have to say Bill Clinton once again said the Americans will admire those who take risks for peace  That 's been his message  Bill Clinton  the peace-maker  And my word  isn't he having an effect there  Uh he uh he 's had a truly wonderful  he seems to be thoroughly thoroughly enjoying himself in Belfast  He must be used to receptions like this  Yes but I this is rather special  I mean I I have seen myself Clinton working in America and  it 's it 's very good  But I mean today  you can see the man  the man is exhausted  Well as we said  it 's been a truly tremendous day  Uh Emmerdale Farm will be following  that 'll be followed by Barrymore My Kind of People  We 'll have highlights of an exceptional day  That 's at half past ten  But from all of us  good-night  John Gates brings the letter over to give to the new Archbishop  who in turn  will present the apostolic letter to Dean McDuff  Now the new Archbishop will be escorted to the chair behind him  the red chair behind him  It 's called the cathedra  that 's the chair which gives a cathedral its name  And by taking his place at the cathedral in Armagh  the Archbishop is symbolically taking his place as bishop of this archdiocese  An archdiocese which includes County Louth  almost all of Armagh  parts of Tyrone  Derry and Meath  Archbishop Daly  is being given a crosier  a gift from the priests of this archdiocese  The crosier like the book of the Gospels which comes next  the two symbols of the office of the Archbishop  The shepherd 's staff  This particular crosier is very old and was given by John Donegan of an old Dublin firm of ecclesiastical metal workers  The wood in the crosier came from the Valley of the Seven Churches at Glendalough  And it was given first to Archbishop Joseph Dickson in eighteen fifty-two   And that there is the book of the Gospels being given to the new archbishop by the Reverend Liam Doherty  Cathal Daly speaks   Monsignor McLarnon the Dean of the archdiocese just greeted and welcomed Archbishop Daly to Armagh  and he 's joined now by the Canons of the Armagh Cathedral  who wear the same robes as the Canons of the Pope 's own cathedral church in Rome  the Basilica of the Saint John Lateran  That dress is unique in the British Isles  Besides the Canons of the cathedrals then there will be representatives of the senate of priests in the archdiocese with whom the new Archbishop will work closely  This shaking of hands is a  a rich means of expression  We shake hands with friends  we embrace those we love  It 's a human thing to communicate something of ourselves by touch  And of course  it is the imposition of hands which is the essential act of making a new bishop  But we 're not making a new bishop today because Doctor Cathal Daly has been a bishop since nineteen sixty-seven and so this ceremony today is  is a more simple and and straightforward affair than the installation thirteen years ago of Toma/s O'Fiaich   These now are the priests who are the elected members of the diocesan senate of priests  The deacons went just before them to make their welcome  And after them will come representatives of religious orders and the lay people of the diocese   Sister Catherine Dwyer from the Convent of the Medical Missionaries of Mary at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda  The last of the representative cross-section of people from within this archdiocese welcoming the new Archbishop  later in broadcast   We now come to the Liturgy of the Eucharist  beginning with the procession and the preparation of the gifts  Four of the six people in this procession were chosen to highlight the geographical spread of the archdiocese  Doctor John Tohill from Magherafelt representing the most northerly parish  Mrs Bridie Magee from Carlingford the most easterly  Barry Grimes from Beragh in Tyrone  the most westerly parish in the archdiocese and Miss Lisa McCarron from Drogheda  representing the most southerly parish  They bear the water  the wine and the flowers to the sanctuary  In the box is the Loughguile Chalice carried by Frank McCloskey  a gift from the Archbishop 's home parish  It is silver made by Sean and Christina Steenson of Glenarm  and the stem contains bog oak from the Antrim Hills  On one side is the Archbishop 's motto  and on the other  a replica of the old church in Loughguile and Lissanoure Lake  The chalice will be used in the consecration  And Frank McCloskey was chosen for the task uh for two reasons  He 's the principal of Saint Patrick 's primary school in Loughguile  and Saint Patrick 's was once two schools  the old Loughguile Primary and the Magherahoney Primary School where Doctor Daly 's father was once principal  And Mr McCloskey is originally from Pomeroy which is within the Archdiocese of Armagh  And the last of the gifts was presented by eleven year old Oonagh Corrigan who 's a pupil at  Mount Saint Catherine 's Primary School in Armagh  She carried the chrism  She 's a member of a long-established Armagh family  and will be confirmed next year during recessional procession   As the procession moves down the aisle the organist plays Come Holy Ghost by J S Bach  This piece inspired by a Lutheran hymn is from the first of the Leipzig Chorales and the fiery musical figures represent the tongues of fire  the manifestation of the Holy Ghost as it descended upon the apostles  This installation has brought together Catholic and Protestant churchmen  British and Irish government ministers  Nationalist and Unionist politicians  It is a positive reflection of what Doctor Daly has said are his priorities  ecumenical dialogue with Protestants  and continuing to work for an end to violence and for justice
