<S2A-041 Latin lecture>  Now the Latin text of St Mark 's Gospel  uh which we are reading in this course  uh is taken from what is known as the Vulgate  La vulgate  in French obviously  Uh that is that is to say the Vulgate edition of the Bible  in this case  uh the New Testament  Uh now the term  Vulgate  is borrowed directly from the Latin  vulgata  which is the perfect participle passive  a feminine of the verb  vulgo vulgare  to publish  to make public  or to make available to the general public  you see  You know the noun  vulgos  which means the general mass of ordinary people  the common mob as  Horace calls them  sigh  The reason why the feminine form  vulgata  is used  is that it agrees of course with the word  editio  understood  vulgata editio  That would be the full title  strictly speaking  uh  for the sake of brevity  the word  editio  is omitted  and so in Latin we speak of the  vulgata  and in English the Vulgate  I 'd like to point out that the term  Vulgate  applies not only to the New Testament  some people uh have the idea that it applies only to the New Testament  but it also applies to the Old  But in this class  in this course  uh we are only concerned with the Vulgate New Testament  or more specifically  with the Vulgate text of the Gospels  Now the Vulgate text of the Gospels is essentially  the correction and adaptation of an existing text in the light of good Greek manuscripts  That 's what the Vulgate means  It 's essentially a correction and adaptation of an existing text in the light of good Greek manuscripts  And this correction and adaptation was carried out by St Jerome  in AD three eighty-three  to three eighty-four  AD three eighty-three to three eighty-four  at the bidding of the Pope of the time  Pope Damasus  D-A-M-A-S-U-S Pope Damasus  Damas I suppose it could be  would it  Tomorrow in fact eleventh of December is his feast day as it happens yes  Uh Jerome anyway was born  uh about three forty  and died in four twenty  Three forty to four twenty  clears throat  And he was secretary to Pope Damasus  and at the time he was the foremost uh biblical scholar in Rome  You may ask why did Pope Damasus feel that this revision was necessary  he felt it was necessary uh  because of the ever-increasing number of variants  in the manuscripts of the Latin Bible  All sorts of people were making their own translations you see  And so uh  they were very many variant forms of  the Gospels say or indeed of the Latin Bible in general  Now though the remaining New Testament books in the Vulgate have often been attributed to Jerome  the extent of his influence on those books is not clear  We 're clear about his influence on the Gospels but we 're not clear about the extent of his influence on the other books of the Vulgate  that is to say the Acts of the Apostles  the Epistles  and the Apocalypse  Very well  now the text which Jerome corrected and adapted is essentially  sorry is generally referred to uh as the Old Latin Text  Old Latin in capital letters you see  Although no manuscript contains the entire Old Latin New Testament  It 's it 's not in any single manuscript  The term Old Latin versions then  refers to the Latin versions of the Scriptures used in the Western Church  uh before the introduction of the Vulgate of St Jerome  The need  of a Latin version of the Bible was felt  earlier in the provinces of the Roman Empire than it was  uh in Rome itself  Because at Rome  Greek was better understood and more generally spoken  Uhm there 's some indication of  such a version in Gaul about the year AD  one seventy-seven  And we we certainly know of the existence of a Latin version in Africa  as early as  AD one eighty  And when we speak of the Old Latin text  what we are really talking about  is a great variety of versions  you see  and a distinction is drawn between the African version  and the European version  which was an Italian version known as the  Vetus Itala  the  Vetus Itala  Uh it was called the  Vetus Itala  because St St Augustine discovered it in uh Milan  in the fourth century  But recent research  suggests a third Old Latin version  this is Spanish  uhm to some extent independent of the other two  Now all of these Old Latin versions are from the Greek  I 'm speaking now of course  about the Old Testament as well as the New because the New was only in Greek  was originally written in Greek  but of course the Old Testament was originally written  in Hebrew at least most of it was written in Hebrew  and then translated into Greek  and then translated into Latin  these old Latin versions  are written in popular Latin  Latin that was suited to the uneducated or lower classes for whom they were intended  And for this reason  they are linguistically important  for the study of the evolution of the Latin language  The first Vulgate bible was produced by Gutenberg at Mainz  in fourteen fifty-two  I might mention that  when St Jerome 's Vulgate uh was first issued  uhm it was met with a storm of protest  People didn't like it  They they were they preferred their old the older version they were accustomed to  The same has has happened to some extent or not as uhm  uh well  the protest wasn't as strong but  uh some people don't like the our modern versions of the Bible  Some are wedded to the older versions like the King James version  and so on and perhaps the same in French  you know  Uhm the Jerusalem Bible for instance was very much criticised  you know  when it came out first  I rather like it as it so happens  Particularly the notes the footnotes in the Jerusalem Bible are really superb  you know  Now so much for the Vulgate then  I just want to say a few words on St Mark 's Gospel which we are directly studying this term  Uh in early times Mark was  uh neglected among the Gospels  And the reason for this is that he was regarded as being merely an abbreviator of St Matthew  since nowadays  the vast majority of Scripture scholars  even among Catholics  accept the view that Mark is the earliest of the synoptics  You know what the synoptics are  The Matthew  and Luke are the three synoptic  evangelists  because they  uhm contain more or less the same material or are parallel  you can study them in parallel  Uh St John 's Gospel on the other hand is not one of the synoptics because he is quite different both in his content and the organisation of his material  since Mark is now regarded as the earliest of the synoptics  the study of Mark  has come  to hold a central position in Gospel research  You see it 's on Mark  that Matthew and Luke build  and it 's Mark whom they interpret  you see  So to do a serious study of Matthew and Luke  it 's necessary to begin by comparing their Gospels with that of Mark  So that among other reasons is why we have chosen to do  take Mark as uhm our text for this term  coughs  Now a word about the authorship of the Gospel  of the so-called Gospel of Mark  The tradition of the Fathers of the Church  you see  agrees that this Gospel was written by Mark the follower of St Peter  we may interpret this traditional connection of Mark  with Peter in this sense  clears throat  that although they did  the material uh didn't derive from Peter  the Gospel circulated in the churches under his patronage as guarantor of his message  In that sense you see  That the Gospel circulated in the churches under Peter 's patronage as guarantor of its message  Now the question arises where was  St Mark 's Gospel written  We can't say precisely where it was written  but what we can say  is that it was written for a gentile community  for a gentile community  of the Roman world  outside of Palestine somewhere outside of Palestine some would say in Rome itself  But at least it was a gentile community  uh somewhere in the Roman world  outside of Palestine  As regards Mark himself he was a man of  little culture as  culture was then understood  for his Greek you see is essentially uhm a non-literary Greek  not very polished  uh full of uh roughnesses  of style  and full of Semitisms  You know that word  You can understand yes  several words   Hebrew indeed  and Aramaic  He would have spoken Aramaic  which was a later form of  Well it was a later dialect a Semitic dialect  Uhm it was the kind of Greek which might have been spoken by the uneducated classes of Rome  you see  Uh because as you know  uh in Rome there were many Greek-speaking slaves  As I 've said earlier  the first Latin uhm translations of the Bible arose in Africa  not in Rome  for the simple reason that in Rome  Greek was very widely understood  There were there was a big  Greek-speaking population there  the Romans  at least the better-off Romans  had their  their uhm children educated by Greek slaves  clears throat  Now just a final word about the theology of Mark  uhm the overriding or the main emphasis in Mark is  to present Jesus to the reader as the Son of God  That 's the key expression the Son of God  Whereas in Matthew  Jesus is presented as the Messiah  The Messiah fulfilling  the hopes and prophesies of Israel  Because  St Matthew 's Gospel  was directed uh  more to a Jewish public  Some would say in fact that  uhm Matthew 's Gospel  was originally written in Aramaic  but that 's a matter of  dispute among scholars  Uh in Mark  the the Messiah  the Messianic aspect of uhm Jesus ' mission is less developed  Uh and an aspect which had more obvious relevance to the gentile world  is given greater prominence  It would mean more for example to gentiles  to the Greek-speaking world  to speak of a Son of God  They could identify with the idea of God and Gods and so forth and a Son of God uh would have meaning for them uh whereas Messiah wouldn't  And hence the title  Son of God  if you have noticed  uh appears in the very first verse of St Mark 's gospel in of chapter one  and again at the very end when Jesus dies  chapter fifteen  We 'll look at it in a moment  Chapter fifteen  verses thirty-seven and thirty-eight  When the centurion says  you remember  surely this man was the son of God  or  was a son of God  Again that uh phrase is  the subject of dispute  Now this recognition of  the divine identity of Jesus is the first move in the spread of Christianity to the nations  to the gentiles you see  The phrase  the nations  in the Gospels and in Scripture generally  is often translated as  to the gentiles   Gente  is the Latin word you see  that 's the word that 's used for the nations  gentes  and it had that specific meaning for Jews  The non-Jews were the  gentes  or the gentiles  Ethne  would be the Greek word  The word which you have in the  expression  ethnic  So those are just a few ideas to put you in the picture first about the Vulgate  and secondly  about St Mark 's Gospel  And it 'll make it more interesting I hope  when you  are reading the Gospel itself  you will see  uhm something of the situation in which it was written and in which it came down to us in Latin  Right now where were we the last day down there at  chapter one  verse nineteen I think
