<S2B-043 QUB Doctorate>  Chancellor  Vice Chancellor  Mr Nesbitt  graduands  ladies and gentlemen  it is with considerable humility that I address you today  I am very honoured that this great university  which I have always held in very high regard  should see fit to confer on me an honorary doctorate  When I consider the list of distinguished people upon whom this honour has been conferred in the long history of the University it does indeed make one very humble  I would like to thank the Chancellor  whom I have known and admired for many years for his conduct of the ceremony  and Mr Nesbitt for his citation  I 'm still blushing and embarrassed  Was totally undeserved  but at the same time very much appreciated  He certainly has done his research unknown to me  I thought today was going to be one of those days when although one was a principal participant all one had to do was to look pleasant and pleased  but no more  However knowing the Vice Chancellor  I should have appreciated that I was unlikely to get away just as lightly as that  A few weeks ago  I received a letter asking me to address the graduands and guests  drawing on my own criteria and experience of life  But firstly  could I congratulate the graduands here today  As the Chancellor said you have worked hard  you have earned your reward  For my part the closest I ever came to attending this great university in an academic sense was to sit my matriculation examination in this very building just down about there  I still remember the place  Like Mr Major  I cannot remember my exact results  laughter  I won't aspire to saying they were good  I know they weren't  however I passed  but instead of progressing to a degree course I went to work as an articled clerk  and in due course uh became a chartered accountant  As a little anecdote of that time  which was toward the end of the last war  as I said we sat the matriculation examination in this hall  it was surrounded by scaffolding  it had a very rough concrete floor  bare walls  the gallery was held up by scaffolding  this platform was not here  there was no heating  we had to wear about three sweaters  a topcoat and gloves with the ink freezing in the inkpots  The biro hadn't been invented then  I can assure you that the conditions today are much more pleasant and it 's much more pleasant to be here in the present circumstances than then  Earlier I congratulated the graduands saying that you had earned your great reward as indeed you have  Probably at this moment you feel as I did when I qualified as a chartered accountant  You feel that the world is your oyster  you can kick it around just as you wish  However it did not take long to realise that the world is a tough  unforgiving and unrelenting master  Today it is probably even more difficult for you  with greater competition to find the fewer jobs that are available  I was delighted to hear the Chancellor say that only nine percent of the graduates of this great university are left as they leave uh the university without employment  Now about some of my criteria for life  First I would like to speak about opportunity and challenge  Mr Nesbitt kindly referred to these uh in his citation  Many of you may be seeking employment in the academic world  and finding that there are dozens of applicants for every position  Similarly with public service  I personally regret seeing so much of our excellent young talent striving for  for positions in the law  the civil service  local government  teaching or academia  and ignoring the more exciting if initially perhaps less secure opportunity that industry can provide  Long gone are the days of the old satanic mills  Today the bulk of our manufacturing industry is highly technical using the most modern techniques and the most modern developments in computer technology and technology generally  Industry needs young graduates like you to cope with modern technology  prepared at first to go onto the factory floor  as a precursor to a career in management  There are probably more opportunities today in manufacturing industry than elsewhere  And it is only by attracting people who have been trained to think  that British industry will be able to compete in the modern world  With sales and marketing  production  engineering  training  administration and general management  the range is tremendously wide  The scope and opportunity for travel is tremendous also  I personally have been privileged to enjoy two careers in my life  one in service industry and the other in manufacturing  My first career as you have heard was in accounting which I thoroughly enjoyed  My second was in manufacturing industry  with all the romance and excitement of machinery and technology  and above all the satisfaction of producing an end product  You have a great advantage if at the outset you know what you want to do and feel that you have a vocation  As Mr Nesbitt said in the citation I knew I wanted to be a chartered accountant  I knew where I wanted to work  but that was just a sort of boyish dream seeing the gilt lettering on the  on the window  However I  cajoled my father who hadn't a clue about accountancy or indeed about  2 sylls  to try to arrange that I got an interview with the principal partner  To his credit  he got me that interview and thereafter it was up to me  Fortunately I succeeded  and was recruited at then the handsome salary of ten shillings a week  which is fifty p in modern parlance  There 's an old cliche/ which says  some people live to work  others work to live  But the more important thing to my mind is that you should enjoy your work  If you resent what you 're doing you will never be a success and my advice is to seek the opportunity to work at a job to which you can relate and which will give you pleasure and satisfaction  You 're going to spend the greater part of your life at work and to do so in a job that you dislike can be nothing else but demotivating and depressing  When in your job  strive to do it well and accept every challenge that comes along  Every challenge that you accept provides an opportunity  an opportunity to prove yourself  and in my own case I do not believe that I ever passed up a challenge  I found it very difficult  Indeed at a late stage in my career and when I decided that the time had come  the time that Mr Nesbitt has referred to the time had come to give myself a little space  I accepted the challenge to privatise Northern Ireland Electricity  At first it was an uphill task  but I have personally taken great satisfaction from the success of the privatisation within the past few weeks  We 've still a lot to achieve in Northern Ireland Electricity uh and a lot to prove  but it has been a great challenge and great satisfaction from it  Nearly thirty years ago  having done my homework  decided that  there was great scope in Northern Ireland for a computer bureau  and I decided that  as an accountant that Northern Ireland needed just such a facility  There were few computers if any  in Northern Ireland at that time  I decided to approach the  the government  I thought it a good idea  They had an enterprise fund at that time with half a million pounds in it  I uh saw the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Commerce  told him what I wanted  he shuffled amongst his papers  produced a green paper and asked me had I read it  And I said no  The green paper was entitled  The Future for Computer Bureaux in Northern Ireland  The decision that that paper came to was that there was no future thirty years ago for computer bureaux in Northern Ireland  And Vice Chancellor it was before your time that the signatories to that White Paper were some notable names from this great university  Uh I will say that they were in the academic world  However  because I was satisfied and had the courage of my own convictions and had done my homework  we proceeded  with the computer bureaux  And that company is still in existence  employs nearly three hundred people in Northern Ireland a day  is owned by an American firm and trades throughout the world  And it gives again great satisfaction and pleasure from seeing its success  But the point I want to make is that if you have the courage of your convictions  go ahead accept the challenge and do the job  Preparing for your graduation you have learned to define objectives  to assess information  to work independently  and therefore using those skills you should be able to recognise opportunity when it presents itself  If you are satisfied that the opportunity presents you with a task which you can do well  that you can enjoy and that will promote you as an individual  grasp it  put your entire self into it and I can assure you that you will receive your recognition and reward  But always remember that you are in a competitive world  If you fail to make the effort necessary  there is always someone else out there waiting to grasp your opportunity  On the other hand never allow failure to divert you  If you fail initially in your objectives use the experience gained  Pick yourself up  dust yourself off  and get on with the next task  The Americans are wonderful at this  They have the ability to drive forward despite setbacks  which perhaps you and I would consider as disasters  From my days as a practising accountant I have always had a great admiration  for a friend and one of my clients  his business failed through no fault of his own  But he picked himself up and set about retrieving it  and is now an international organisation trading throughout the world  Tremendous success has followed the failure  and that man  and that experience in his life benefited him thereafter  In my own career  I 've had a few near-disasters also  In Lamont Holdings which was referred to  I set out with Lamont Holdings to form it into a financial services industry company  in the second half of the seventies  We unfortunately were just ahead of our time  it nearly turned into a disaster  but we re-formed  retrieved the situation  turned it into a textile company and now it employs nearly two thousand people uh here in Northern Ireland  in France and in Great Britain  and is a successful uh public limited company  So as I say nearly a disaster but  by re-forming  again having the courage of your convictions one can take the  accept the challenge and take the opportunity  Now my second point  enthusiasm and commitment  Life can be very boring if you 're not enthusiastic about it  You have worked hard  you 've the ability to communicate  you 've knowledge and you 've achieved the first target in your career  graduation  Now you have to turn all that to your own advantage  In being articulate you have the ability to express yourself  But I 'd urge that when you do so  do it with enthusiasm and conviction  Life is a marketplace  it is necessary to sell your own abilities  and it is only when you 've established a track record of success that people will beat their way to your door  It 's up to you to achieve that record of success  I often think in Britain today that some business people have become somewhat cosy  satisfied with a certain standard of achievement  but not prepared to go that extra mile to obtain the pleasure enjoyment and satisfaction of a further goal or another challenge  Complacency is something you should always be wary of  It will get you nowhere and may indeed lead to failure
