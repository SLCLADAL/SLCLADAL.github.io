it  Later on tonight  whenever I go out for dinner I 'll have a proper nice dinner  without chips   I know   I 've  never been as unhealthy  chips and crisps and I haven't drank vodka in a long time  but mostly the chips and then deep fried fish last night at about two o'clock in the morning  And it was really greasy although it tasted lovely  It it was actually quite nice  Mhm  He 'd been working all weekend doing his writing and I told him keep your head down and we 'll go out for dinner whenever I get back and you can pay saying as you 've just got paid  laughter   Catherine 's not gonna be  at the market next week  Sorry  I 'm gonna be really pissed soon   What  Catherine 's not gonna be at the market next week  I know  Aye she was fed up with the market she was saying  last night  Aye she 's not gonna do it  anymore  It 's not worth it for them  They 're not making enough money   No   No no   It 's not really the sort of  place for sandwiches  Is it  No  There 's so many other things  I don't think  sandwiches  would sell that well so they don't  Yeah   What else is sold at that market  Like I 've never been at it  Think you make the most money out of making pizzas   Tapas and Creole food   Oh right  Olives and cheeses and fish and  Make tons of money making pizzas  Sorry  Huh  You wanna get into food and make I mean make just make pizzas  That 's the thing you make the most money out of  Is that right  Just buying the oven that 's the dearest part of the  pizza thing  isn't it  About five grand  Mhm   Because to make a pizza it costs you like ten p and you sell it for  fucking  two quid  Mm   At least  Two quid  A tenner  Eight quid   You 'd need to have premises as well  You need to have premises then for that as well  Yeah aye she couldn't do it in her house  She 'd be fairly fit running up and down those stairs delivering pizzas  laughter  A queue of people standing outside the Lisburn road  I 'm not sure Domino 's would be too pleased with them  laughter   Aye right enough  Uh but there is nowhere in this country that you can get a nice pizza even in in England  No  unless you go to a restaurant  There 's a nice pizza place in uhm there 's one at Magherafelt  Is there  Does gorgeous pizzas  The Pizza Box yeah  It 's in Maghera as well you see the chain  And I mean they 're lovely  I 've never had a  nice pizza   Rossini 's  is quite nice actually for a pizza  Is it  Mhm  You know that wee place down in  Brunswick Street  I think their pizzas are quite nice   I know but I mean if you 've been to Italy   Oh Little Italy  If you 've been to Italy and had an Italian pizza why can't they just do it over here simultaneous and unclear speech   You see even you know the fast food places in Italy the pizzas are just lovely  Sure remember Leonard and I went to Brindisi  it was shite  laughter  the best thing about it was you just go round the little uhm  sweet shop you 'd have a stand with uhm   Four Star delivery service   I don't like it  Slices of pizza  And they were  out of this world   They 're the best of a bad lot   Is it  From what I can  manage to gather anyway  I got a Domino 's one there  I love their pizzas too just ham and cheese   Do you know what they do wrong here  It was just pure chemicals  They had all this like yellowy stuff  all over it  It was like  what is that  and it tasted sweet  strange  It was very strange  They try too much of the toppings and all and make it too heavy   Mm  Yeah they really are too fattening  It was the best  pizza  I ever had  They usually just had them sitting on the little hot plate  Mmm   Mm  And they used to be rolled over  And Italian women just eat pizzas like a whole pizza and they 're skinny  How does that work  I don't know  I really don't know   Italian women  are not skinny  A lot of them are  It would be nice  A lot of them aren't though as well  I mean whenever  Italian women tend to be very very thin whenever they 're younger  and then when they get  married and have children they turn out to be big mamas  Uh-huh yeah   That 's all the pizzas  laughter   Must be  It just works on them when they 've children   There was three Italians on our street in Australia and all the girls were very very thin up until the age of about twenty-five  and then after that all the mummies were very very big  The daddies weren't funny enough  The daddies were  quite fit still  It was funny  Yeah yeah   That 's just in every culture men age a bit more gracefully don't they  We found out after about two years whenever we moved back here that he was actually related to the Godfather in America was his nephew and he was actually running drugs  We didn't know any of this  Oh my God  There was a whole big furore about a year after we had left the street  And we were very good friends with them  You missed the drama  Missed all the drama indeed later in conversation   Seriously I think my eyes are about that size  They actually don't look bad  My eyes are tiny today  Mm  My eyes are tiny  They 're all stingy  You look  they don't look tiny either  Youse actually don't look  2 sylls   It 's the wonder of makeup  It is  the wonder makeup  I really do feel sorry for guys the next day  Mm   laughter   You can put your slap on and you look  half decent   No but as I said before  they age well  But they don't wear don't wear hangovers well either  laughter   Whenever I met Leonard in Dublin and he had gone for a photo shoot and he had a full face of makeup  Really  What was his photo shoot for  I was going you look well  laughter
