there from last year  Nicked  Oh that 's lovely  4 sylls  We don't nick things in this house  When will we get our Christmas tree  Or is Aisling getting us a Christmas tree  I thought they nicked you a Christmas tree the other day  Yeah they did  Where did they get it  I don't know  It 's probably a twig  Jimmy 's Special Branch  No Toni Toni said she 's an a  a little one at home  Oh well then  Well when are you going to starting selling your  Christmas trees  I have to find out  Supposed to get a phonecall today about it  Who 's selling them  Myself and Jimmy  We 're selling fifty   And is there much profit on them   Nearly double the price you 're paying for them  And where are you going to set up selling them  We 're not  We 're selling them to people we know  There 's only fifty of them   So how much are they going to be  are you going to be selling them for  Between  about seventeen fifty average  And is that  do you get the profit from the ones you sell  We 'll go halves on it  Oh right  We 've an artificial one at home  Except Jimmy 'll probably get a bit more because  he 's driving   We get a fresh one every year  Oh right  God you better get on to Jimmy  But it was my idea  You better get on to him  It 'll be  it 's free delivery  well it 's  yeah it is free delivery like  You can pick the tree up from us for the same price as we deliver it  Uhm you could sell them to all the houses on your road  Walnut Lane isn't it  They they 've already got their Christmas tree in one of their houses  Sell one to Vincent 's hospital  not that they 'd get one from me   Like Thomas is selling turkeys and Freddie   Mm  Four hundred turkeys Freddie sold  Freddie sold four hundred  Mm yeah there 's loads of profit on them  Freddie Hamill  Yeah  Mm  There is huge  An entrepreneur that guy  He 's going to make huge profit  There 's huge profit  Toni was the same as him though  Mm why didn't she do it  Because he was doing it this year  Hm  There is huge profit to be made but it 's  like it 's only a once-off profit at the end of the year  How does Thomas  Oh you have to keep them the whole year do you  No I think they bought them about four or five weeks ago  God I should have get my father to do that  Maybe a bit longer than that  September  How does uhm Thomas look after them when he 's up here  Have you got the space for them  Loads of free sheds  Well then you should do it yourself  forget about your da  Sure I won't be there to feed them or anything  Aye I suppose so  You give him the money for it  I don't know anything about turkeys  Yeah it 's very easy  Easy I 'd say  Get a book  1 syll  one or you  Thomas I think he 's lost  You you 're expected to lose about three percent of what you 've got  Thomas has lost three percent so far  two of them were very small  Who looks after them for him  Or does he go home during the week  The Boxer  Who 's the Boxer  His brother   A friend of his  No  a friend of his called Boxer  Do they go halves halves  You know the way those Meath men have weird names for each other  What 's  what are their names  What was your man with the red hair called  I can't think of it now  It 's five to two  what was it  Aw they 've awful funny names  The Beaker  The Beaker  Yeah  One of them anyway  Mm  Rocky Reynolds  Is he called The Beaker  No  He was in uh Kiely 's the other night  Yeah  He 's unrecognisable actually  He 's lost weight  Mm  He 's grown  Who were those lads there last night  Emmet and  Tom   Emmet  McBride  Oh Emmet  O'Byrne  Who 's Emmet  Who 's he  Is he from Meath is he  He 's a football player  I nearly died cos Finola said that Jimmy had just introduced to her uh a guy from Dunshaughlin called Tom  and I suddenly thought of that guy in the taxi from Cork  Oh  Wasn't his name Tom  Was it  I had sudden  visions of him being Tom   I 've met him already since then   I know you told me  Thanks very much  He was asking for you  Joan had a bit of a scrap  I 'm missing something here  It 's just someone we met in the taxi rank when we were in Cork when we were getting a taxi  I didn't have a fight with him  No but  several sylls  what did he say to you  laughter  It was awful funny  Is he a friend of Jimmy 's  No  Was he not  Just knows Jimmy  Everyone knows Jimmy
