Oh so Seanie wasn't here all week at all  No Seanie was working in Derry  all week so I was in there  And uhm  So when he talks about working hard all week  it  clearly means that you kept him up all night  all week   Yeah   No  he was working hard all week  He didn't get  back til the hotel until quarter past eleven on Thursday night  Imagine  Quarter past  eleven from working  So did you  just come in from Letterkenny then or whatever  Wednesday evening  Yeah  3 sylls    Aye just came in and stayed in then and went out to work then the next day  It was grand  like cos   Oh right

horrible   It 's  did you drive up this  evening aye   Yeah and  it 's fucking minging  I really would  wouldn't couldn't be fucking arsed I think going out in it   I   well if as me and Mary were saying if we go out  it 'll make yourself go somewhere like Lavery 's or the Empire because  you couldn't be bothered queuing outside a  nice bar tonight like   Cos it 's minging   Naw naw   fuck

Sunday   Yeah   I haven't  seen you in damn ages  Aye I 've  3 sylls  last night in Letterkenny just  3 sylls   I 've been out all week so  I have   Oh have  you  Where 've you been  Well Eithne 's been away in Spain    so I don't really like being  out sitting in the house on my  own  once you get out there  it 's it 's a case of you 're stuck there for the night   wouldn't even go to the shop  cos it 's too dangerous to even walk up the Antrim Road  So  I 've been having  well Darren was round on Sunday and Monday and then  Geoff was round on Tuesday  and then I went out for a meal with Luke last night  So I 've just  I 've spent   Oh right   Aye I 'd say that alright   Yeah  Yeah  right   Do you know  what I seen as well  Do you know what 's uhm  you know the Imperial Restaurant in Botanic there  Uh-huh  It 's uh has an offer on  I think it 's between five and half seven  Now don't quote me on that  I 'm not not  too sure of the times  but  it 's only nine quid for a three course meal  Right   That 's brilliant isn't it  Very good isn't it  Is that the one at the top of Botanic  or the one at the    Yeah the  one  you know  turning down onto the Ormeau Road  Oh yes   And the food in there 's lovely  too so it is   Yeah so Seanie  was saying as well  So  might see what the craic is tomorrow maybe  It 's gorgeous   Well I just cooked dinner there now for  Yeah oh well we haven't eaten yet  I don't  I actually don't really fancy going out  for dinner   For Mary  and my stomach is swollen  I cooked like pork and leek sausages with loads of mash  and then I stuffed peppers with  uh  mushrooms and onions and and chorizo sausages  with chilli sauce  It was just too much though  It was lovely  but  just ate so much like   Very good   Very good  My God   Aye but well I haven't eaten  yet  I 'm hungry now but I want something I don't know what I want  Do you know  I don't want   Pizza  Pizza 's always good when you don't know what you want  I 'm not  I have to be really in the mood for pizza  Really  Yes  That 's the one food that I don't have to be in the mood  for   Naw  meat  I don't have to be in the mood for meat  I could eat it three times a day  So could  I  In fact I can't actually have a meal without meat  being present   Yeah   Yeah well I  meat and  uh only chicken as a substitute  Nothing else  I know  Couldn't have anything else  You 're not into your vegetables  either are you   No  fuck  laughter  I 'm eating rabbit food every day at work but there has to be a bit of meat for me to digest the  lettuce  carrots  and a bit of pasta that I take like  Exactly  It 's fucking killing  me  2 sylls  dinners   And the weather 's so depressing    just hate  it feels like winter now  doesn't it   I know  God I   Well I  would prefer if it was fucking freezing than that wet that 's out there  tonight and that  Cos it 's not even well it was a wee bit chilly this evening there getting a bit chilly  but  do you know the way it was pissing down  what day was it  Wednesday down at home I think it was or Tuesday  and  it would 've fucking boiled you alive  outside you know  You know warm  It 's shit like  I know   Yeah   Yeah   I know I know   Well come here  I texted you during the week there   aye  what was that about  Uhm just to see whether you were busy over Halloween but I 'm sure you probably are  Uhm I 'm not actually because  Oh well that week you mean  I 'm not even sure exactly when I 'll need somebody from  Right  But uhm I would need an extra pair of hands  Now because  uh you was quite ambiguous whether you 'd be able to work or not  uhm  I phoned Linda to see if she could get  anybody  So she 's asking a few people this  evening as well   Right well   Aye   Right   That 's  fine sure  But uhm if you were in Belfast I know how you like a wee bit  of extra work  Will you be up here   Aye well I 'll tell you what  the thing is right  I am actually uhm  I am actually  what am I doing  I 'm changing wards  You know that  Aye you said that  in your text yeah   Yeah so ahm   Jesus I 've got a cramp in my foot  Fuck me  Ahm I 'm changing wards so I should have an extra bit of cash coming in  anyway  But the thing is I  I 'm be I will be working  uhm different shifts now  Before I used to do four and a half days a week  half day on Friday  I 'm off the weekend  Next week I work a Sunday  But after that that might be changed  I might have to work  Saturd  long-day Saturdays and  Sundays so   Right   That 's right yes   And will  you be doing night duty now  as well   Well  I will be doing nights but I I don't know if I 'll be doing them for the first two weeks but  like I want them  need the money like  so I mean for   You like doing nights though don't you   And you  like doing them as well  Yeah I don't mind them  So I mean if it 's a case that I am off  say the Monday Tuesday of that week I 'd want to come up and help you  like  Cos I mean I 'd be coming up to Seanie anyway seeing as I have to work the weekend  you know  So come here listen  I 'm getting Friday  Friday the first of November  the night day after Halloween night off  Right   Exactly  So what I 'll do is   Oh are you  Yeah well I 'm supposed to be going uhm  Bob 's supposed to be deejaying on the boat in Derry  That 's right yeah  That 'd  be brilliant   So I think  we 're going into that myself and Seanie like  4 sylls   Cos I I wouldn't mind going down  However the shop won't be closed I 'd say until about  seven  And that 's a bit too late really to go to Derry  Isn't it   I know   Well ah   maybe yeah  Well it depends  Angela   It 'd  more than likely be an all-night affair  But  then I have to be back in Belfast for ten in the morning  Ah   Well I 'm off the next day you see  Then I 'd probably end up  working that Saturday and Sunday maybe or Saturday anyway  So  I might be off the the two days at the start of the week  If I am off anyway any of those couple of days I 'll come up and help you surely  So it just doesn't make sense   Right   Right well  I 'll certainly keep you posted  on the whole thing   Aye and  come here if somebody else  comes up and it 's a definite to do it  uh take them  You know I mean because I won't know until next week what I 'm working anyway  Can you hold on a second  There 's someone at the door   you hold on for two seconds   Yeah yeah  sure  goes to answer door   Sorry about that  You 're alright  Saibh coming to the door  Oh right aye  I was thinking about her coming  up this evening   Yeah  she 's just got a new job so she did  Oh brilliant  At doing what  Uhm uh she 's working for it 's like a paper company or  something like   And she 's in the office doing admin work  but I think there 's the possibility  you know that she 'll she 'll get uhm  what do you call it uh promotion  and  maybe get into her design and stuff like that  Right   Right   Ah excellent  Very good  Tell her  several sylls    Which is good to see  cos like she 's looking a bit unhappy last  week  She 's coming in to see me and it 's it 's really it 's money  You see when you have money worries  Yeah   Oh it 's the  worst thing   There is absolutely  nothing more depressing  Nothing  And nothing can bring you round  Nothing  only money  laughter   Oh nothing because you   ca  you can't actually do anything   I know   You know  you 're so stuck in a rut  and  the bills coming in  and it 's even worse   And it 's   Yeah exactly   It 's not  you can't even go to the shop  and get  yourself something cos you don't have it like  I know   I know exactly   2 sylls    But I  can't wait til after Halloween  Hopefully I 'm going to make my fortune  Exactly Angela  yeah   And then  I 'm off to Brussels on the  eighth or the eleventh of December   That 's right  Excellent  So I 'm looking forward to  that now   You  should be now
