<S1A-055 Hospitals>  that 's her story   I didn't think the father now 'd be inside in  Saint Ita 's like   4 sylls  Did they  Mm  They 're living  They 're living out towards Croke  Mm  They say it 's a very pleasant  place down there is it  I don't know   6 sylls     8 sylls    8 sylls  laughter   Nothing at all to go home for  Is there  laughter   That 's right  I think she  8 sylls   She did  That 's all  There 's a neighbour of ours there  4 sylls  Pat Gorey he 's lives a bachelor  5 sylls   He 's a bachelor farmer down the way you know  Yeah  He 's going back to England  Yeah  several words  A place like Saint Ita 's sure would be ideal for the likes  of him   Yeah   But you know it 's cruel where he 's above in Mallow now like  And he 's in that ward just there 's three beds here  three facing him three behind him and this kind of thing like  Now he has plenty of money like but he wouldn't pay to go into a home  wouldn't pay to have a phone below now    10 sylls    Inside in a nursing home  there 's   They only  want his money  there 's  no care there  There 's no heat out of that  5 sylls  after all  And they 've no  facilities   But sure  8 sylls  No   A lot of  a lot of them now we get  come from Beechwood or  some of these  yeah yeah  And they can't understand  that the measure of care they get  by comparison with paying a wad of money   6 sylls    Mm  For nothing  'Tis only  basically  get them up and feed them  But   Right  You know  Whereas like in our place  they 're  very well treated really   6 sylls    But when you see him above now like he does  four hours sitting out on a chair   Do people have to pay there  Do bachelors have  to pay there Bridie   They  pay on the interest of their money if they have money  On the interest of  the money   On the interest  of the money  Other than that  'tis their pension  laughter  We had we had this fella  in from Dromcolliher  and you see  this rehab  re  in Saint Ita 's now a rehabilitation unit  Mm  And the patients come to us  They 're assessed in rehab and they come then for long stay or home  But this fella you see in rehab they 're treated for six weeks  for six weeks  and the measure of care they get there is unreal  Oh 'tis they 're spoilt rotten  You see see there 's only ten there say ten there  But ehm  and the same amount of staff as in uh uh  fifty people in it  the  laughter  this fella anyway was seen in rehab you see  And he came up to us then long stay  Eh  5 sylls  but  written on his chart  had no say  Never allowed voice his opinion  laughter  with a domineering wife  laughter  So  ehm so we said Mike  how are you  Well was the missus in to you  That so and so you 'd hear  And uhm but anyway  Missus rang  How was he  He 's fine  Well isn't he very bad  Ah no he 's not  He 's good  laughter  Now did he eat his breakfast  laughter  He did  Ah he didn't  laughter  Ah did he  This sort of thing  all that 's wrong with her then  is   Is she 's  afraid he 'd be sent home  She 's no  but she doesn't want to give up the pension book    Isn't afraid he 'll be sent home at all  she couldn't care less  laughter  whether he was at home or abroad  the pension book  the other night she came in  and she had an appointment to see Doctor McDaid  but she couldn't make it then  But this lady that was with her  her husband took a night off  He 's on night shift you know but he  took a night off  to bring  her in  Uh she wanted to see the doctor  And I was saying that that the doctor wasn't on at all now really  and we didn't know like whether that the doctor that 'd be standing in wouldn't know the history or anything  But faith then she contacted him  She rang McDaid anyway but  It was all money anyway and pension book  you see  She was saying  that uh  she was sort of saying  he that he 'd be ready to come home  even as bad and all as he was he 'd be ready to come home  Kind of  he 'll only be in a few days  It isn't worth your while charging like  for  the few days you have him  But she came  laughter  in anyway and she said to me  Mike Mullins isn't inside in his bed at all  And I said no  He 's sitting up in a chair down there  it would be down a good little bit and I had seen him about ten minutes before that  But I said Christ God he could be under the chair or anything do you know  laughter  And I said I 'd go down  Ehm went down anyway with herself and the doxy that comes with her  Sorry nurse to bring you down but we didn't know him  He was so badly looking  laughter  Well look it  I couldn't stop laughing  laughter  I  Oh   Mm  right   Oh I see  laughter    She didn't know her own husband  She didn't know him  He he got so badly looking  Oh right  And like she 'd seen him about two days before that  laughter  He got so badly looking in the two days  And what harm but your man is clean and delighted to be there  And uh he 's so  some street in Kells  where he was born  And where 'd you where 'd you did you meet the missus  Crossing the road  laughter   How did he happen to find her  cross  crossing the road  laughter   There 's some queer ones happening like that now  But uh I told McDaid the day after that she didn't know him  Well look it  well wasn't wasn't he lucky says she  laughter  Says McDaid wasn't he very lucky  But uh ah they 'd make you laugh like  Oh   I 'd  say that  There 's great characters there  like  4 sylls    Oh yeah  And cash is so important to them do you know  I suppose  And still   The pension  that would be a joint pension  Wo  wo  would she be  having the pension brought in from the wife or would it be  I don't know uh whether he made  whether she  yerra she 's a pensionable age too  but a tough nut like  She 'd pull out every stop in the book do you know  laughter  And then you can meet and like just so nice I 'd say now  I 'd say that there were as many as forty  box of chocolates handed in  for ones even that died during the year  They 'd come back  do you know  an awful lot of them come back  You 'd be surprised  how much stuff they 'd give you  Yeah  laughter   Su  su  such a change from what we were growing up with  When you think about it people had bad visions of the  home   You daren't  mention the home now  Oh it 's a hospital now  10 sylls   Saint Ita 's hospital   That it  Saint Ita 's hospital   It was a workhouse one time  Yeah  6 sylls  That 's what it was basically like a workhouse  The graveyard is probably there at the  back  The graveyard at one time   Yes yeah   It 's a famine graveyard   Freddie  7 sylls  to Mullane 's and uh Bernie Mullane 's farm  4 sylls   That would be a farm across the road  Oh yeah on the way to Ardagh  that it   No  I don't think that  No no this now is  4 sylls  graveyard  Right   In  around Saint  Ita 's if you go the back way    several words   And they came the other day I remember the grey donkey  the white donkey inside in the home  When someone died they just threw a sheet over him  brought him out in donkey and car  pulled the lid on the  1 syll  car and  whistle  into the grave   4 sylls    And no  coffin  Nothing  like that   You  remember it  I don't remember but I remember is the the grey donkey inside in the home  Yeah  Yeah  But you remember your man your father talking  about it   several words   They got Mass said there and they  1 syll  now  They 'd no flowers   6 sylls    Oh he he still is    4 sylls    And now the  luxury they die in like  Yeah  But isn't  it only right    I think it 's 'tis geared for death you know like  Mm  That they 're getting no time in a general hospital like we would have  You know  and they have the priest and they have every care really  Yeah like  6 sylls    But it 's very important  Oh it is  I think it 's awful important that people can die with dignity  you know   Yeah and  'tis important to to talk to the relatives and give them a cup of tea and  they  can stay overnight  or you know  whatever   It is    10 sylls    Yeah  5 sylls  twenty-five thousand now  4 sylls   Twenty thousand  with the curtains and  all that  And all that 's going to be repainted now again  They could still close it in two years ' time  Why why would you close it is it  Yerra no but you see that  it would be cheaper now to subsidise patients in a nursing home  as to to be paying staff in a hospital and  paying kitchen staff and all the rest  But  But still  yerra I wouldn't   They haven't  the care  But I uh are are are all these nursing homes the same thing or are there  just good ones and bad ones  are there  Yerra sure there   10 sylls  I haven't a clue like you know  I 'd say the nursing homes really  They 're out to make the money for a start anyway  Sure they 're they 're  they 're not   Uh uh  a lot of them say that they aren't even making money  unless they 're full all the time  That place now in Foynes  Yeah  and the heating and everything  I suppose if if they 're big   But sure one hundred and twenty or one hundred and thirty pound  several words  no matter if they only charged them half inside in Saint Ita 's  it 'd be dearer  than  3 sylls  Saint Ita 's  I suppose Saint Ita 's then is subsidised  by the State is it  provide that   5 sylls    Oh 'tis  Oh it is   I know but if  if they charged them that that bit Tom even for for  several words  Those that are not on the pension they can keep that  several words   Well there shouldn't like she wants  what they do is they they keep some of their their pension and  until they have twelve hundred built up like for  and a person has that much built up  and a lot of them have good lot of money  You know even though they 'd only get maybe a  what do they get back out of the pension  Varying but they could get as much as twenty pound back out of the pension  But you 'd be surprised how that builds up if they 're not smoking  do you know  for the women we 'll say  Right right   But sure there 's some of them there ten or twenty years isn't there  Yeah said you 'd be surprised how it builds up  And then we 'll say a lot of  a lot of them then  would leave a a share of money and wouldn't have much after them  So we give a novena of Mass is said for them while they 're living  And well they 've everything thought of really  But uh   Some of those ones  have fairly big money too  Have they   Oh they do  There 's that Tommy Byrne  4 sylls  He was never poor  He had nearly thousands like you know  laughter  10 sylls  but he started off  and he started saving the day he took the home farm over  You see he didn't drink  10 sylls  He 'd live on the  milk of a cow and and a hen and  you know  and that 'd do him  laughter  In actual fact he never  spent a  bob at all  He lived the life of a pauper  10 sylls  He 'd be as well off spending it  Right   Yeah   Wouldn't he  Yeah  Yeah cos  laughter   When you  think of the way it went for  God 's sake   I know  Aye sure that that 's the point I 'm making  It 's it 's a pity like  I felt sorry in a way for him  And how did it go  my sister got a good lot of it  anyway  The family got bits of it too like  Rosie   Yeah  But wouldn't he be better off spending it on  himself I think basically surely like   Yeah he would  He would   Yeah  You won't have that problem anyway  You needn't worry  laughter   4 sylls  everyone got a thousand from him anyway  Yeah  Like that 's why  2 sylls  he actually starved himself he  did  My brother-in-law went out there  10 sylls  He actually died of starvation  Right   malnutrition  Hypothermia  Hypothermia was it  And his blood sugar was real low  They thought he was after going into a coma with diabetes  yeah  No food  10 sylls   He couldn't get over the luxury when he was inside in the home that time  And it wasn't luxurious at all at that time by comparison  That house wasn't dilapidated  several words  You couldn't drink or  several sylls  The house had gone down so much  You know  that 's the reason  several sylls   roof dropped out eventually that there was  no room left you know   Yeah  the surroundings   Yeah yeah   But wouldn't you think there now he was at school  and everything like  and was educated and everything you 'd kind of think  And was educated   Yeah  But do you  know   Bachelors  they withdraw more and more  You watch there now like  Even do you know you watch Gorey 's and those there as well like  They 've loads of money and yet  But sure  like the people   I I know  that generation  as well of course like  laughter  grew up at an awful bad time like  you see  That 's the other side of that  They grew up in the twenties and thirties and it was really bad
