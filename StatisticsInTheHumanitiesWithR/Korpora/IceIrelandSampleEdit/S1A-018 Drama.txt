<S1A-018 Drama>  Ambulance was crap  I know that  I don't need you to tell me  You were crap  I wasn't  crap in Ambulance   laughter  I was going to say you were good  but you wouldn't have liked it  No you weren't bad in it  I think with what I had  like I think with everybody what they had to do in the play  with the exception of Walker they make a bloody good stab at it  I think Walker did brilliant   I think Walker was really good   I thought Walker was  by  far the best  Honestly  Yeah   But the play would have been so much better with somebody really really good in that part  I thought he was brilliant in that part  I really did  I really thought  he was brilliant in that part   He did it totally  differently every night  I mean totally differently  Well well I saw it on the last night and I thought it was brilliant  Honestly  And I wouldn't lie to you  I mean   I thought Nadine was crap  No Nadine was great  But not in your part  Uh-huh  I thought she was good in that part  And she was good in the Who Dunnit like  Mm  That was the first time I spoke to Saibh actually  What was that Ron Fine  I said that was the  first time I spoke to you  He said that that was the first   I think Melissa  Melissa made a mistake in making Nadine come out of herself you know  On the Who Dunnit night  Och who put the chair there cos I was sitting there  I think Janie was on it   Nadine uhm  Melissa managed to  throw Nadine around the room a couple of nights in a row  and made   her come out of herself which she shouldn't have bothered to do because now she 's too out of herself  What happened  she was before  If you notice  she played that part just the way  her life is  You know   Who who did this  Who 's this  If you 'd noticed her at that drama ball cos she was a fucking wanker just like she was  she was even speaking like the part she played   Who  several sylls   Who are you talking about  Oh Nadine  The first time I met you was at the Who Dunnit night  Well the first time we  spoke  I 'd passed out onto the floor  and youse  you bumped into me I was lying  on the floor   The most hateful woman  several sylls    Aye I  tripped over you  I know  Hello  That 's when I had longer hair  I want to look like King John again  And I thought you were the guy that wrote experiments for insects  Why  Cos everybody referred to you   several sylls    She never told me that   I did tell you that and you were extremely offended  I did write experiments for insects simultaneous and unclear speech   Well maybe you just look a tiny bit like him  So why were you  Why were you  You wish to look like Simon Brown  I think he 's lovely looking  Simon Brown 's a wee frigging wee  I mean  never mind the fact that he is actually a wee poof  Why were you  why are we avoiding the subject of sex which is what we opened with  No   Who was  I 'm not  I would never avoid the subject of sex  Yes you did  several sylls   Why should  what reason do I have for avoiding the subject of sex  Well Coralie was speaking to me  and she was saying  she was saying that  you have this funny problem  You see the thing is I know Coralie would never speak to anybody about anything like that  When she 's drunk she would  She wouldn't   She would  she said to me  she said  this is her word  she said Jane I 'm a woman of the world  a  I 'm telling you I want more out of sex   You know what she said to me  Bob is a tall scallion of a man  A strapping six feeter from the rough end of the trench  I want more out of Donall  That 's actually what she said to me  And I said Donall who  Could you move over  You 're taking up too much of the bed laughter   That 's what she said to me Bob   I 'll make this admission to you  I have a great problem with sex because I haven't the bowels for it  You talk about it too much  Mm  The bowels   Uh oh sorry  That 's another problem I have  I talk all the time as well   Uh I think you 've got it wrong  Uh bowels and sex  unless you 're talking about anal sex   No no no  Whenever I 've got my irritable bowel syndrome my tummy expands  and  and I I just don't like it  I prefer getting my belly kissed  What do you think  Oh aye ah   I just don't like talking about that sort of thing sometimes  What sort of thing  Sex   I know  what you mean  You can talk about it  generally   It 's fine talking about uh sex  generally  but not specifically  Generally   Alright  Alright  The way he does  Men in the drama society and women in the drama society  Let 's go through them all and grade them out of ten  laughs  Right  I 'll go first  For what  For what   For sexual attractivity  And that  has to include personality because we  are  we  are  modern politically correct women   Ah oh yeah I 'll tell you a thing   What   And don't forget  We know everybody so we will know them  I mean we know most people  Okay  Right everyone 'll take one person the other person on the other side of them has to suggest  Okay  But what if you don't know them  Well if you don't know them  You can make up something  See I don't know all the people anyway  Yeah but you know some people  Yeah  Right I 'll go first and do Saibh  Right  No I don't want to go first cos I  Well you do it to Jane  No somebody else start cos  just  You 're stupid  Ha ha  And it has to be female or male or it can be any   It either can be female or male to Donall  No no no no no  It has to be female to Donall and female to Bob  Why  Because  as we said earlier   We 'll run out of people   I think it  no  Look just whatever you want  Okay right  Matt Whelan   laughter   Not to you  I mean I don't mean you know Matt Whelan would you would you jump him  I mean  do you think he 's attractive and stuff  No   Uh yeah  Well I would question   Okay  Do you want me to talk about Matt   Yeah   Me and Brian did this for seven hours one night   Brian who   Okay right well I think Matt   is a really really really sweet guy  I mean he really is  He would never ever do anything to hurt anybody and I know him since primary school and I have never known Matt to say a bad thing about anybody  Brian Ford   that 's beautiful  Honest to God  He would just never  and if he does say a bad thing about anybody he would say it to me  But never to anybody that  that would ever hurt anybody or anything like that  Aww  And he 's I don't know quite whether you know  That 's his best quality  his love for Matt here  I have to  Just throw them at him  What  I uh  What   What sorry you don't like  I really forgot about that  Other people would find Matt attractive or not  I don't know  Each one to his own  Do you think he 's attractive to women  That 's what we 're asking you  You see Matt doesn't go  in for girls  in a big way  I mean he doesn't  I mean the last person Matt was  went out with  Look don't   That girl in the English class he he was after  I know but like he just doesn't bother his arse  I mean  that 's nothing to do with it  Do you think   several sylls     several sylls   No but I 'm just saying  let me talk alright simultaneous and unclear speech   Matt doesn't bother his  I mean he 's so fucking incredibly  stupid   You still  haven't answered the question laughter   He is  He doesn't come on to women  Matt doesn't read people  male or female  very well  Well neither do I  So  He doesn't  But I mean he he   especially girls he doesn't read very well  Matt 's naive in certain ways you know  I mean he really is  and his uh  Matt 's in love at the minute with a  girl  from fucking Cork  I know   From when we were down at Easter   From years ago  Like  Uhm how long has he been in love with her for  I mean God forbid youse would ever say this to him unless he mentions it to you  He mentioned it to me  Well I mean then it 's okay but I don't want  I wouldn't want anyone to know I was talking about this  because it 's  something very very private  Oh yeah   Well you 're horrible talking about it then  laughs   No but see  Donall  Is that on  Course it 's on you idiot  But Donall  I mean laughter   Look wise up don't pretend you didn't know  I swear to God  Is there no light on it or anything  Listen listen  He 's not  as  he 's not as uhm shy as that  Like for example when Jessica  they were all going blah blah blah blah I hadn't a baldy what was going on  but he did    5 sylls    When was this   At the at the uh  what was the play called  The free play  The two people  it was two names  Oh I didn't see it  Larkey and  Little and Grand  Little and Grand  Thank-you  Oh that   Load of oul bollocks  laughter   I wasn't there the night that youse went was I  Well anyway we went to the  party   Yes this was on the  last night  And they were going  they were  you know they were this thing going  on together   Oh when  he met Jessica  And I only caught on  you know  and he said you know how do you say no without saying fuck off  laughter  I know but that 's the truth  Cos that night I 'd set Matt  I mean I 'd completely set him up that night  I went to the party  I went to the party  I was driving  I wasn't drinking  See three months ago I was worse than that   So you needed  a bit of fun  I  And I needed  something to cheer myself up  I know what I 'll do  I 'll get somebody to snog Matt  Now you see Jessica had already said  Jessica had already said  Is this Ron  uh is this Charles 's tape   Aye  Charles has gone   Jessica said to me  there 's two people in this room I 'd snog  I said who are they  She told me who they were  well like what about Matt  No Olwyn had said to me about this this  Tell us who they were  Yes  Ralph  2 sylls  and Matt I think  Yeah well yeah  Yeah  And the other one was you was it  Of course the other one was me  but that 's that 's I mean   She 's going out with Ralph isn't  that 's Ralph she 's going out with  Yeah   several sylls     several sylls    Point is uh  I was sitting talking to Olwyn  Why  I don't know but I  just started talking to her   Talking to Olwyn   Talking to her  And like  well I made a conscious decision a good while ago not to talk to her any more  because  she just annoyed me because I hate girls really flirting with me  Why   Yes she does  And uh it really  it can really annoy me  You know  She doesn't flirt with me  Seriously  I wouldn't be able to tell if someone was  flirting with me   No you wouldn't notice  but Olwyn does in men 's company  That 's fine  A lot of women do   What do you mean I wouldn't know  That 's not a very nice thing  to say   No cos  I don't know when when  I don't know when  it 's when somebody 's flirting with me or not  I really haven't got a clue   I think I 've known two girls liked me in my entire life  But that 's only because I heard people saying  That were what  No it doesn't matter simultaneous and unclear speech   Whether the opposite sex find Matt attractive or not I don't know  I 'm sure they do  I mean he 's not a bad-looking fella simultaneous and unclear speech   Matt is  the whole of him is very attractive  What would you give him  What would you give him  What would I give him  Out of ten  Yeah  Well you see  Five being alright  If we were talking about Mag Jones at the minute the only thing I 'd be talking about was their looks because  she 's fuck-all personality as far as I 'm concerned   But I 'm talking  about personality  If I 'm talking about Matt as a whole I would give him  Well therefore  you know if somebody has no personality then they go down in the marks  basically  cos we 're talking about the whole   Yeah   You know give a general mark  I 'd give Matt a six or a seven  Yeah   Which  Seven  Yeah
