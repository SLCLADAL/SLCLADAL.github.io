<S1B-005 Byzantium 2>  When did that evolve and become statute  or is it just there from  dot you know Christ  You know what I mean  Well no it 's not  just there   Or is it a  fusion of different things  you know   Well it 's  a fusion of different things  alright cos what just  laughter  4 sylls  what does Christ say about divorce  several words  laughter   He actually says that  several words   Yeah he actually says that there shouldn't be any  Mm  Right now the thing to remember is that  Jesus was brought up as a Jew and was acting as a rabbi  a teacher  was actually  answering questions on Jewish law  And does Jewish law allow divorce  The answer to that is yes it does  Really  Alright  The things you learn  laughter   I didn't know that  I didn't either  thought  Jews 'd always been very like  stringently against divorce  Yes  2 sylls    Uhm no there is uh now it it tends to be  very rigorously well  nowadays it 's very rigorously defined because most Jews  traditions that derive to some extent from the Rabbinic  tradition of Judaism which in Jesus ' time equates with the Pharisees  And nowadays if you want to get a  divorce according to  halacha  which is Jewish law you get what 's called a a  get  which is a bill of divorcement  And this bill of divorcement has to be written exactly  thirteen lines I think  Anyway there 's a specific number of lines that it must be written in and it all must be you know done exactly like this  And the nasty part is that only the man can do the divorcing  Alright so   Mm mm sorry I asked  that particular question  He he actually presents the bill of divorcement to  her erstwhile wife  And that 's why in orthodox Jewish communities you get things called  well it would be  agunot  which are chained women  because they 're chained because their husband has  left them but he hasn't actually divorced them according to Jewish law which means that they can't remarry according to Jewish law  Which if you 're a devout Jew  is clearly a problem  Jesus in his teaching was actually more extreme  than the Jewish tradition in which he was sort of operating  Alright  Because he actually said you know they allow  divorce but I say to you there should be no divorce  Now  how quickly did that well I mean then you have to get from the teachings of Jesus to  something that resembles  established Christianity  And I mean that takes three centuries to do roughly  so fast forward to three thirty AD which is a useful point in time but nothing more  And by that stage  Christianity is more prevalent in  the Roman Empire than Judaism  had been  because Judaism constituted approximately one to two percent of the population of the Roman Empire  whereas Christianity in about three thirty constituted approximately ten percent  of the population  nine or ten percent  Peter the  Mm hm  How did the Jews you 've been describing the Rabbi  how come it 's only two percent  It 's a uh well  laughter  Sorry I 'm I 'm  not laughing at the question  The simple answer is Saint Paul  Saint Paul  Saint Paul  Well I mean okay but right  He took up the mantle  And I mean if you actually think about the New Testament  exhibit A  which is  a copy of the Bible  Right  So then  Christ said the word  as a as a Rabbi   1 syll   and Paul interpreted that and changed it into Christianity  That  4 sylls    Yeah   Right well what  right the the this  right if you if  if you look   I know  nothing about the Bible as you  can tell  laughter   Right well  basically the the the Gospels right there are four Gospels  and then there are the Acts of the Apostles  And those  come from well those supposedly recount the mission of Christ on earth and then the Acts of the Apostles curiously enough the disciples afterwards  Then you get all the  epistles and most of the epistles break in tape   But Boswell also stops to wonder what sort of relationship it was  He finds clarification by Basil 's subsequent  career with the hunk approving  Theopolitsis  Theopolitsis is a courtier  sees Basil  and goes  that 's a bit of alright  I 'll have some of that  laughter  and takes him into his service as a groom  And then comes the horse-whisperer episode  when there 's a horse that nobody can calm down and Basil is summoned in to do it and does it  And then he comes to the attention of  of  the Emperor  Michael the Third  Of   Can I ask you Peter in all the literature that 's been written  do they talk about normal sex ever  I mean the the actual sex do they talk about between man men and women  Normal   Uhm  laughter   You know what I mean  Well    2 sylls   accepted  It 's not accepting I mean just I mean is it reported  I mean is it is this absence of  reported sex between this  3 sylls  you know thing  would that be because it just really wasn't talked about at all  Part of it would be that  Could that be just a normal sex thing going on and they didn't talk about that this was what was happening  It 's right on an awful lot of our sources right an awful lot of Byzantine sources are actually religious sources  and curiously enough they don't actually talk about sex very much  So that means that our body of sources sort of  are reduced  There are some sources  from the eleventh and twelfth century I think specifically of what of there are things called the Romances  There are novels  And there 's a thing called  Digenis Akritas which is sort of the  the derring-do  adventures of  well Digenis Akritas means  twice born the border or  And that 's this guy who lives on the eastern frontier and he has a whole series of adventures because his  mummy is a Christian but his daddy is Muslim and that 's he 's born from the two traditions  And he has lots and lots of adventures about getting a girl  and uhm  keeping the girl and almost losing the girl  he rapes an Amazon on the way past  And you know there 's all this  stuff going on  So sometimes they talk about  sex a little bit there but at the same time it tends to be a little bit  elusive  So you tend not to get  you know  they disappeared into the forest  and had sex  You tend not to get that  But I think they   A bit vague  It 's a bit vague  And because maybe because religion a lot of religious  a lot of it when they do talk about like even somebody 's character  and they 're trying to pull them down through their sexual exploits or whatever it 's all negative  Like it 's all the worst of the worst and  intrigue  and mistresses and  You know you don't get a routine just two people having a relationship and going about their business  You know  It 's it 's all the other stuff all  because  maybe because it 's like well religious people generally are   anti-sex  laughter  You know  it 's always got to be involved in some other kind of  plot  or or you know  mystique or something  Mm hm   Religious   Yes   Because the other thing is that obviously within Byzantine culture  there 's actually a very strong tradition that  asceticism is best  and that sort of celibacy and  you know  you only sort of you know did it once a quarter when you lie back and think of Byzantium and you never do it  otherwise  You know   For the sake  of procreation   So there is that  in part that 's probably  a function of the kind of sources that 've survived  Uhm because most of the Byzantine sources that we have  were saved by being kept in their monastery  So they 're actually you know coming from monastic storerooms and things  And so that means that  anything that would be a little bit dubious here  juicy  they wouldn't 've kept  right or might not 've kept  Not having anything explicit as far as heterosexuality is concerned makes it just totally impossible to compare it then you know with homosexuality  I never   3 sylls    It makes it  very very difficult  And  a lot of people would actually say but because  you know  you can't get you know  confessions of a Byzantine lesbian  laughter  confessions of of a Byzantine gay man  right well that means that in actual fact you shouldn't you know I shouldn't be teaching this module  No it 'll be  1 syll  as well  several sylls   Yes probably  And I mean that 's one of the things that that  okay you know  to the extent that there is a political agenda going on in the module  It 's that even though we don't have neat tidy sources that we can just go and look up  and flick over as we go and look there it is and sort of work out that you know seventeen point eight percent  laughter  did such and such two point five percent did such and such and the test sample  is you know  uhm ten thousand people which constitutes so many percent of the total Byzantine population for the thousand years of you know  We don't have any of that  So that means that probably as far as as sort of the  Economic and Social Science Faculty down the road it 's sort of you know oh well it 's all meaningless then  But then  because  it is a kind of  history that should be there  and it was part of experience we actually need to look at how we look at the sources  and then ask the questions of exactly how far can we push  the sources and what sort of questions can we ask them  And that 's  Yeah the thing I  several sylls  A lot of people are ignored and and written out of things  I think in those days it 's just that  sex was just written out  So it wasn't anything to do with homosexuals or heterosexuals  just sex  l  a lot of that is true  part of it where where it sort of  where that argument tends to fall down is that there are collections of what are known as penitentials  And those are the the the penalty rates for all the Christian sins  sometimes they can be quite A explicit and B go into more detail than  you think is   Than you  need to know  laughter   Well than you think is healthy  For some reason Father confessors uhm  I mean some of the famous ones actually come from Ireland uhm  which obviously little Irish monks sitting alone  laughter  on a little island  in the middle of of a  law  decided you know I 've got to do something to kill my time  laughter  And so they write these things that you know and there there 's you know there 's a whole scale of penalties  And you know  oral sex for  the first time  counts for so and so and oral sex you know more than once counts for so much and you know  It 's all  listed out  the Byzantines have penitentials as well  but they tend not to be quite so explicit  or quite so detailed  but at the same time they do actually make distinctions  Uhm and so they will you know they will have penalties for  fornication and penalties for sodomy and penalties for oral sex and  you know  the rest of it  Craggy Rock    4 sylls
