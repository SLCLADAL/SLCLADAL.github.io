<S1B-032 Questions Answers 1>  I don't John because I 'm getting a bit tired of the whole thing at this stage frankly and I think every succeeding clarification uh simply raises further questions which require further clarification and we can if it is going on endlessly so I prefer to leave the firm reconstruction of what happened over those days to a proper inquiry as distinct from bits and pieces coming from various angles  I don't doubt by the way the the the truth of what individuals are saying in terms of their own recollection  It 's very hard to remember what you said an hour ago very often much less what exactly passed nearly a month ago now and I would prefer to leave all that to whatever committee of inquiry is now going to investigate everything  What I what does puzzle me a little bit uhm if Dick Spring was in fact fully aware of all these issues on the sixteenth is why he should actually have pulled out after Geraldine Kennedy 's uhm story broke uh and why as accomplished a politician as he is couldn't have found a way of staying in if he really wanted to  Because when he pulled out he greatly weakened his own bargaining position in terms of a subsequent coalition  His whole strength depends on being able to play Fine Gael off against Fianna Fa/il and once he pulled out from Fianna Fa/il he was then in a much weaker bargaining position and I can't really see why as experienced a politician as as he is would have done that unless he was very confident indeed of his position of three weeks before  But the publication surely of Geraldine Kennedy 's story made it impossible for uh for Labour to continue with the arrangements with Fine  Gael   Oh I I  don't think that anything is impossible for a professional politician if he really puts his mind to it  He can find a rationalisation for almost any posture he wishes to adopt  And Dick  Spring is a very professional politician  It 's the highest compliment I can pay him  Isn't this a   That was my question  You anticipated it  It 's a compliment  Avril Doyle you mightn't necessarily consider that a compliment I suppose would you  I don't and I would have hoped that Professor Joe Lee would be amongst those who believe that the day of the cute hoor in politics is over  I hope to God it 's over   Oh what is all that   That 's only a minor  element of it   They can justify  anything when the occasion demands to me this maxim the cute hoor but let 's leave that there 's a more important issue at stake now  Uh quite frankly  the Fianna Fa/il Labour uh coalition has broken down irretrievably because of the failure to uh expose the existence of the Duggan case  We need a new government in place urgently a stable government as quickly as possible  And today 's revelations about who said what to whom on the sixteenth of uh November in the Taoiseach 's office in the presence of Dick Spring et-al really is only adding further layers of confusion and actually distracting from the main focus of what the politicians certainly those who are negotiating to set up a government should be about  I now would agree that all of today 's confusion added to the layers of confusion we 've had for the last five weeks should immediately go to an inquiry  probably the Committee on Security and Legislation if we ever manage to sort out the whole area of privilege and compellability of witnesses and I have some slight doubts as to what end of that when this piece of legislation is through perhaps this week  But let 's assume we can sort out the whole area of of of of privilege for witnesses other than just Da/il witnesses  uh I think a body such as that should immediately take the layers of confusion sort out and reveal exactly what has gone on  And and could I suggest John that let 's not forget with five weeks ' confusion heaped upon confusion that we still have to be told why it took seven months uh in the Attorney General 's office to sit on the Father Brendan Smyth extradition  We still don't know the very first question the answer to the very first question and we still don't know why Albert Reynolds was prepared in political terms to risk all to bring down his government to appoint Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court  We 've not had an explanation we all have our views and our versions but those two essential questions that precipitated this this political crisis have yet to be answered  And Gerry Collins are you if you 'd been in the Cabinet now do you think this would have happened or do you think your wisdom brought to the occasion would have saved Fianna Fa/il  Uhm I I suppose I could easily say it wouldn't have happened if I were there  I don't know  I would hope not  but what I do want to say now is that for the people who 're watching this programme  the people in the audience  what 's important now is to have a government  My party is not in the position to form a government that 's quite clear  Uh we have nobody who would want to share government with us so therefore we 're out and what I would want to say very clearly very simply  bearing in mind that we 've three hundred thousand people out of work  bearing in mind that there are many people depending on stable government for many different reasons  I want to see a government there and see a government there quickly  Now having got a government established I also want to see the full story come out  and   You 're  with Ray Burke on this are you  I 'm I 'm with everybody who wants to know the full story and of course I saw and heard what Ray Burke said and I support him  as  several sylls    He said  he was sad angry and upset and whoever has been responsible let them pay the price  I want to see the full story out in the open uh I want to make sure that people will have again respect for the democratic institution of of parliament  That I want to see perhaps more than any uh and I think that 's exceptionally important  I want to see the cynics who can easily point the finger all politicians are all the same  I resent that  I 'm not one of those  I wouldn't want to be one of those and I 'm sure the same equally applies to my colleagues here who are members of the Oireachtas  I I want  Do you think Fianna Fa/il is hurting at the moment  Of course it is  Naturally it it 's naturally it 's of course it is hurting  Why shouldn't it be hurting because we 're uh  Especially Fianna Fa/il you think  Especially Fianna Fa/il right now and the country 's hurting as well  And people within Fianna Fa/il are sad uh they 're angry  Yes I am sad I am angry I 'm concerned  Of course I am but I 'm equally determined to ensure that whatever length of time we 're in opposition that we 'll rebuild our party and we 'll be there again for another day  Could I ask Gerry whether he he agrees that Albert has actually burst the party now  I I I I think that question is you know pretty  a left-handed one Avril uh and  I 'm I 'm quoting your  own words to you  I 'm quoting your own words to you   I I accept that I I 'm quite aware  I 'm quite well aware of a statement I made three years or so ago uh about certain difficulties I foresaw for the Fianna Fa/il parliamentary party  Having said what I said then I have not since then repeated that  Uh I regret the way now the position that we 're in and by the way I certainly won no personal satisfaction in saying that I 've been proven right in anything  I don't want that  I wish that weren't so  I wouldn't  want it to be so   But Gerry hold on  You have repeated it since because at the meeting which followed the nineteen ninety-two general election which you described as the greatest political humiliation in the party 's history you said that the slick spin-doctors  the pricey promoters  the media manipulators had had worked to the disadvantage of Fianna Fa/il and that you 'd prefer to see the party going into opposition but it shouldn't have gone into government  I think John it should be very clear and it should be made very clear that the particular comments which you 're attributing to me uh were made at a private meeting of the Fianna Fa/il parliamentary  party   I checked  them with people who were there and  Yes yes I I 'm not saying I 'm not denying the fact that at all at all but what I am saying it was a private party meeting where people have an opportunity of saying exactly what they feel and at that time we had lost ten seats in a general election uh and that to me was quite a disaster in the political sense and was a very bad showing  And yes it is so  It is so that I recommended very strongly and  proposed very strongly that my party would go into opposition at that particular time uh in an effort to benefit from a rest period in opposition but the majority didn't agree with me and I went along with the decision of the  majority   So it 's  going to be allowed to go into opposition  I I most certainly believe yes  I think it 's going to be a great time for my party in opposition  Many of them you know we 'd prefer if we weren't there under the circumstances under which we find ourselves but I am very very uh satisfied to know that we 're going to avail of that time to rebuild our party to strengthen our party to regroup and to put right the wrong  Uh it 's like somebody having a boat and puts the boat on the rocks  If there 's a hole uh in the boat below the water line you bring it into dry-dock unclear simultaneous speech between $B and $D   I 'll put it very simply to you  The fact that the people withdrew their support from it put us on the rocks because we hadn't we had lost our appeal to the electorate and now we 've got to see why uh we 've got to have an in-depth examination as to what went wrong uh and put it right  I 'll come to you Jim in a minute but I want to first of all go to the audience  Sean O'Donoghue who asked the question  Yes  Uhm I just think that uh someone serving a statement and it being returned and backwards and forwards all the time isn't going to help anything and waiting for the Committee isn't going to help much either cos I think that could run and run and run  So the sooner that it 's sorted out the better  I don't know what procedure that will require but the sooner the better I think  Right yes right at the back over here on the left  Yes  Very very briefly uh John  Michael Gleeson an a councillor on behalf of South Kerry Independent Alliance a newly-registered party  It appears to me and to many that I speak with that the truth in this entire issue is becoming a total variable  and people are disillusioned and confused and that 's a very sad thing for politics  That 's point number one and point number two  and I don't want to be hard on Jim Kemmy and he he rationalised his previous statement  but the descent from the moral high ground may prove to be very precarious indeed  Thank-you  centre of the middle row yeah sorry back middle row centre  Yeah  I would like to say Mr Chairman that it is my opinion and I I feel it is the opinion of many people out there looking that with the mess the politicians have allowed themselves to get into and the time that it has taken to sort it out sort themselves out and sort the the others out  that there there  that there is plenty of room why we should be thinking of uh redundancy for the politicians  We we we elected them to run the country and this is what they should be concentrating on doing I think  In any other job in the country if we were trying to sort ourselves out within the job then  1 syll  wouldn't be long making us redundant
