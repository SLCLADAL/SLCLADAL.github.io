coq-au-vin   Oh are you going to make it  But I 've  never made  it before but  got the recipe out of Delia 's  book  So I 'm making that with like  baby boiled potatoes and  butter and  chives kind of thing like  Aw great   Mmm   Oh lovely   That sounds  gorgeous   Just  veg whatever  And then  and then Laura 's making this lovely  like lime  cheesecake which  she 's made  before  It 's got like chocolate chip cookie base and  lovely lime juice  So she 's making that with a bit of fruit and all on the side  She 's making that tonight I think  so   Mmm   Oh  lovely  Aye cos you have to make cheesecake a day in advance for  it to  set don't you  I used to love my mum 's cheesecake  Mm hm   I 've never made one like so I was like going  you know I 'll just you know I 'll make it like you know but I knew I was coming out tonight and all going  laughter   She wanted  to do it because  Superwoman couldn't do it   Because of  the situation   She 's just  yeah  I was saying to her I tried to make it sound like I just I just wanted  to get nearer the action basically  Mm  Which I do  And what about Bronagh then  Are you going to move in with Bronagh  or    don't know  actually either   What 's the  story  I don't know  Cos it could be out of the frying pan into the fire  Her and Bobs are never apart you know  Oh are they not  I 'm not a  nowhere we go out together and have a great night  when  we go out like  But I don't know her very well for  day  in day out like   Mm hm   Mm   I know  But she is the kind of girl you can just say  you know she tells me to shut up and you know if I 'm annoying her the other way round  So it 's not like we 'd be sitting tip-toe around each other or anything you know  You 're not one for tip-toeing around anybody Jennie  I wish you hadn't bought your house and then we could move in together     But  you 're happy on your own and  I 'm still really trying to find my feet  Yeah I know   obviously yeah   I really  am  It 's uh it 's a lot harder than what I thought it was going to be  Do you  know what I  mean  It 's not that I I hate it  I don't hate it  I 'm enjoying it but I know I 've still a lot of  finding to  do  If that makes any sense  Yeah   Yeah   Mm   I know  You think you 're at a certain stage and then something might set you back or   depending  on your moods and your  Yeah   It does  I mean like sometimes you know  I should be out  I should be doing this  I should be at the gym  I should doing this  By the time I get home from work generally  I 'm  just at absolutely  5 sylls   And  it 's a bad rut to be in but  I also blame it on the time of year  This time of year I 'm always like this  Summer I come into my own  but  after the winter I just  mid-winter  Mm   Yeah   Mm   It is depressing like  And everybody 's dying in work at the moment  Die  as in literally dying  There 's a lot of deaths  laughter   They 're not dying with the cold or anything  They 're  just literally passing on to the other side  Yeah  Yeah they 're popping their clogs   Is that tough on you the  ones you know  and like like  Yeah  It is   It 's not you sort of  you do it so often that you don't think about it but at the moment I 'm thinking about it a lot probably  ju  I 've just had a lot of  horrible things happen in work  this past  wee while  with people that I 've really liked  I  I 'm on I 'm going to the Royal Victoria Hospital tomorrow to visit one of them  He 's Tommy  He 's eighty-nine right  He  never had any  3 sylls  and he 's taken up with this uhm one of the another resident Sheila  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Mm hm   What do you mean taken up  He 's having a relationship with her  Oh right  He 's eighty-nine  seventy-five or  seventy-six  She 's an ex-psychiatric  patient  uhm and Tom 's  happy   Fuck   Can I 've  some of these  Work away  And   That 's  amazing like  I know  And are they doing the rumpy-pumpy  They are  Are they  No well orally  laughter  Not so much  the other  They 're definitely at it like  Fuck  And thank God now I have to say I 've never walked in on anything too serious  a lot of the staff have  And what do they think of it like  The staff can't cope with it at all  They  But it 's their lives  They 're adults like you know   Exactly exactly  Oh I know I mean like  the way I should say to them you know  at the end of the day you have to respect your privacy  The  two of them are  sane mind  I mean Sheila gets  psychiatric illnesses but she knows what she 's doing  She 's  not you know  doolally or anything  Yeah   Yes yeah   just horny  laughter   Yeah well  right Sheila doesn't she craves attention  Do  you know what I mean  She 's a lonely person very very quiet  loves doing things for people just loves people in generally  You know  Tommy sort of gives her something to do  Do you know what I mean  laughter  That sounds really bad  But Tommy 's not quite as able as she is  So she helps him walk  and   Right   Yeah  laughter    Eat  this  laughter   I know basically  do you want something to do  laughter   God love her  So I mean like  2 sylls  unbuttoned clothes like  Good on them like  Are you supposed to knock before you go in  Oh yeah  this is the thing right all my staff knock  Right  everybody knocks  but  it 's just part and parcel of  of the procedure  you know  You 're told to knock in on the bedroom door before you walk in  but  they knock and just go  in  instead of waiting   an answer  Do you  know what I mean  So I mean what 's the point in knocking if you 're not going to respect  the  answer that you get in the first place  They  just knock and go in  But in saying that I mean like nine times  nine times out of ten  laughter  If they were  they make a meal out of it  Oh my God some of them are  crying and can't cope  I 'm not I can't work up here  Right   Right   Yeah   Yeah   To say yeah   Yeah   Mm hm   Now they 're probably trying to catch them   That 's terrible  Like I   I 'd like to think  if I was  ninety I 'd still  be  sexually active  Terrible   I say  if I were you   Yeah   Tommy was only out of hospital on Friday with  he has uhm  chronic airways disease right  His breathing is fucked  He smoked all his life and his breathing 's absolutely frigged  He 's  in  3 sylls  like constantly  Yeah   He 's going to die happy then  Yeah he he is  laughter  He 's just out of hospital on Friday  and this happened on Monday night  He went to sit on her bed  and misjudged  laughter  the bed   I thought  you were about to say her face  laughter   He couldn't swing the legs up that high  But Tommy 's tiny like  and  Sheila is huge  That 's the funny thing as well  Sheila  is this big tall huge woman and  Tommy 's  this wee tiny man  He went to sit on the bed anyway and he misjudged where the bed was and fell  Broke his hip  and  fractured his leg in three places  And I just knew I was like   3 sylls    Right   Right   Yeah   Aw shit   So is  that who you 're going to visit  I 've to bring him up jammies and  a card from Sheila and  Is this your day off   Are you happy to do that  Och aye  I couldn't not like Tommy 's so funny  Sister  sister  That 's  what you call him or he calls you  But he calls everybody sister  You know he 's not like  he thinks that you 're a woman of authority or  anything  He calls like if you were to walk in he would say well sister  He 's so funny  Yeah   Yeah   Oh right mm hm   Yeah   All right bro  Yeah that 's what the girls say back to him well brother  Some craic  To me he must 've been a really good-looking man in his day  You  can even see that he was good-looking you know now  He 's got this lovely wee smile  Yeah   Is this the first time it has happened in there  Or have there been others blossoming relationship  There 's somebody well apparently about ten years ago a couple got married  Yeah  But it 's not something that happens every day  Yeah  There 's another case now downstairs  You know the dementia unit  Well there 's a couple   It 's different  now I think  than when I worked there  It was all just one level or something  It was renovated  The top floor is  real elderly and the downstairs is  dementia   Right   And the ones in the dementia unit are  the girls working in the dementia unit are going mad about this other relationship that 's going on  Inappropriate behaviours in public and  all that sort of business  But they 're not in public  They 're in their bedroom like  Because they they 've dementia they don't know where they are or what they 're  doing   Ahh  Yeah so that 's  slightly more complicated cos things could be termed you know  as abuse  or whatever yeah  Abuse   But the person 's not showing any signs of  You know something somebody 's doing something  If  somebody was doing something to somebody that was  being detrimental to that person  they  would show it somehow  whether  it was blinking a lot whether it it was flinching  You  know they would show the stress  You can't  help it  Ehm but you see she 's not  In fact she 's  a  lot happier  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Mm hm   Yeah   Is she going round   Well  Do you know what I  mean  I I it 's  trying to strike a balance between  what 's friendship and  companionship  and  you know a relationship to what 's  inappropriate   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   And having to explain to families as well   What do they say about it  the gentleman you see he doesn't really have dementia   He 's only pretending   No because it 's a elderly mentally infirm unit
