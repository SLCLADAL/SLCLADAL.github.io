<S2A-052 Cooking>  The other one that I 'm using is balsamic vinegar  Now we 've been using it for years  but as well as adding it here to marinate this and to break down the structure  it 's the greatest ingredient to give flavour and also it 'll you 'll find it will change the texture of the meat completely  Put all of those in and then just toss them round and mix them in that  Now if you have time  leave it to sit  even ten fifteen minutes  But if you haven't time it doesn't matter with this dish because this is what I would call an instant marinade and once you 've tossed it round you 'll find even the colour of the meat will have started to change  That 's when we 're ready to cook it  I 'm going to stir-fry this beef and not only is it fast but it 's healthy as well and do you know you 'll need only the tiniest little bit of oil  I 'm cooking this in a wok and as well as that it 's got a non-stick surface on it so you can get away with  even very little  That 's just about half a teaspoonful  Now the secret in the cooking of this is all to do with the temperature  They 'll want the heat that 's coming off this to be as high as you can possibly get it and it 's almost when you see that sort of faint haze coming off the pan  that 's when you 're ready to start and add it  Now a word of advice  don't be tempted to put it all in at once  Once you 've got that faint haze and here it comes  we 're ready to put the beef in  Now look  just a tiny little bit at the time  And you 'll hear that sizzlers of the beef as it goes into the pan  And if you can  just keep going right round the pan little bit at the time and do you know  as it goes into this pan and with the marinade on it  the heat just seals the goodness and the flavour and the texture straight into this all at once  It almost caramelises the beef and turns it a wonderfully sort of goldeny-brown colour  There we go  Just keep popping it in like that right round until you 've got it all in  and as I say this wafer-thin slices will cook for us in no time at all  There we are  The secret of good stir-frying is to keep the meat constantly on the move and keep the temperature as high as you possibly can and make use of the sides of the wok  Keep stirring it right round the sides like that until all this liquid that went in with the meat has gone right into the meat  And that 's what makes the flavour in this dish  Now we 're ready to add the vegetables and there 's really only one main one in this and that 's about two hundred and twenty-five grams of mushrooms  I 've just washed them  cut them up into nice sort of quite thick slices because I find mushrooms just disappear in front of your eyes whenever you 're cooking them  Just toss those round with the beef  and again these will pick up any of these juices that 's coming from the meat  Now it 's time to get the flavour into this one at this stage  and this is a convenient sort of family-style dish  I want to put some chillies into it and it 's the sweet chilli sauce that comes out of a jar and I 've got a couple of tablespoonfuls there  That 's  all goes in at once  As well as that I 'm adding some tomato  It 's the tomato passata again  Couple of tablespoonfuls here  and that 's really smooth sieved tomato paste  That goes in as well and at this stage just toss it all around  I 'm going to add a few spring onions to it for colour  So a good sprinkling of those over the top  to give it a little bit of extra colour and texture as well  Now just allow this all to heat through  and then once the mushrooms are well cooked that 's it ready to serve  Now I like to serve this one I think it 's best of all served with a few lovely sort of crunchy fresh leaves and those simple tortilla corn chips those lovely Mexican ones  The two of those go really well with this hot spicy beef   Often the simplest old-fashioned puddings are best  especially when it comes to getting good nutrition into your kids  and aren't there few of us who don't love a bowl of good creamy rice pudding  This one 's got a few twists in it  It 's a more up-to-date version and I call this a marvellous malted souffle/ rice pudding  Starts off with milk  and the choice of milk is entirely up to you  If you want to follow a sort of a healthy diet well then you can go for the low fat milk  But I 'm using about a litre of the full cream one because I think that gives you a much creamier pudding and one that 's much nicer  In the milk goes  just turn up the heat and then we 're ready for the rice  Now the rice that you use for rice pudding is totally different from the ones that you make your curries with  Even the grain looks different  This is little fat grain  It 's as wide as it 's long  And I 've got about four ounces that 's a hundred and ten grams  It all goes in together  needs a little bit of sugar to sweeten it and I 'm just using about an ounce of a non-refined sort of cane sugar here  Uhm it 's a slightly sort of more golden colour and that too all goes in at once  For flavour  wee tiny bit of vanilla extract and again I find if you 're cooking for a family this vanilla extract just works really well  It 's only a couple of drops of it and that 's all the main ingredients at the start of this rice pudding  Now you need to give it a good stir round  and the way you cook it is very important  because you 've got to bring it right up to boiling point  Now that 's very important to get the grains to start to burst  Once you 've got to that stage  then turn the temperature down and just leave it to simmer for about an hour   And isn't this what good rice pudding is all about  Just look how thick and creamy it has become  Now I 'm going to leave that just to cool down for a few minutes because I 'm moving onto the next stage and that 's the souffle/ part of it  It 's made with three egg whites into a bowl but if you 're beating up egg whites you need to be really careful that the bowl is completely clean  because if there 's even a hint of fat in it you 'll find they 'll not beat up  There 's no sugar in this at all  So just whisk these  just until you get them nice and light  Now that 's going to take about five to six minutes altogether  and once you 've got it to that stage they 're now ready to add to the rice pudding  Now put it all in at once  Don't dilly-dally round with this one because the rice is still slightly warm and so it 's all got to go in together  It 's this egg white that 's going to add the souffle/ part to it and really help it to crunch it  to puff up  So all of that going in  and there 's one other ingredient going in as well and it 's these little chocolate malty sweets  Packet of them here and just crush these slightly when you come to put them in  Now if you put in some whole ones that 's okay but you just want to crush them up slightly because when these come to cook in the oven you 'll find they will break down even more  So in those all go as well at this stage  just lightly chopping through this  as I said  don't mix this too much  as little as you can possibly get away with  until all the egg white is just folded in right throughout the rice pudding  There that looks just about ready  As I say that only takes about a minute and as I said the coarser you leave the sweets  all the better  At this stage just get rid of the spoon  and I 'm going to pour it into an oven-proof dish  Now I 've just lightly greased it  dusted it with a tiny little bit of caster sugar and then just pour that all right into the dish like that  It 'll flatten itself out nice and evenly over the top  and then once you 've done that I 'm just going to cover it with a few flaked almonds  Just about twenty-five grams  lightly dusted over the top and then that 's it ready for the oven  Cooks at two hundred and twenty degrees centigrade  that 's gas mark seven  and it should take about ten minutes   And that 's what I call a marvellously malted souffle/ rice pudding   We 've been eating potato bread for years and do you know the way I normally cook it 's to put it in the pan and fry it in a tiny little bit of oil and then top it with an egg  But here  I 'm going to use it to make a really tasty chicken and ham sandwich  Going to chargrill the potato bread and do you know this is a super bread because it 's a wonderful mixture of buttermilk and potatoes all combined together into a bread and it makes a great basis for this sandwich  The other ingredients that are going with this are chicken fillet  and look  I 've chopped those up into tiny little ribbon strips  I think if it 's something tasty in the form of a sandwich or a snack you 're after  you want all the ingredients to come together nice and quickly and that 's exactly what this one does  The chicken fillets have no oil either and they 're cooking on the grill pan just until they become nice and crispy  And that 'll probably only take with that about five to six minutes  putting some ham with it and it 's the Italian Parma ham  one that 's slightly smoked  one that doesn't even need any cooking  But do you know if you put it onto the grill pan here and just heat it slightly it 'll crisp it up and it 'll add a wonderful texture to the sandwich  I 've just got about three slices there so that 's going on as well  break in recording  other ingredients to go with it are a few black olives  And I love the flavour of black olives with this one  Again they don't need any heating but they 're even nicer if you just heat them up slightly  A few tomatoes and it 's the sunblush tomatoes  so they go on too  Now at this stage we should be ready to turn the potato bread over  Going to leave that for a couple of minutes on either side  And keep turning the chicken  Do exactly the same with the ham and then when everything 's ready it 's time to put this sandwich together  And this one looks absolutely stunning because it 's a layer of potato bread  topped with the griddled chicken  few slices of ham  few black olives and sunblush tomatoes  and then finished off with basil mayonnaise  And that 's mayonnaise just about a spoonful mixed with a teaspoonful of finely chopped basil   Nutritionally potatoes are terrific  They 're loaded with vitamin C and they 'll fill you up and not out  so why not get the kids to eat them more often
