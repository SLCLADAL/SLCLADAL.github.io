<S1A-013 Student chat 2>  There 's a shop on the Dublin Road called Natural Interiors and we keep driving by but we haven't been in it yet  Uh we wanted  we don't  like those curtains  Oh yes Natural Interiors   Beside the Ulster Bank  Yeah that 's it  We don't like those curtains and we actually whenever the curtains are down that 's a really nice area you know just that bay with the  window and all  So we thought well we don't really want that covered up  but we need a bit of privacy so we thought we 'd actually get a screen you know like a standing  screen  and just in the evening whenever we 're in here put the screen up  Uh-huh   Mhm   Or you could  just get uhm  curtains that when you pull them back they go right back  Means like  during the day   And get the  2 sylls    Yeah  aye but it 's still you know I sort of   I 'd want the  view   Martina 's  just anti-curtains  I I 'm not an   several sylls    But your window might not be exactly  the same  if you get that done again it might not be the same shape  What  You know if you get your bay done again  it  mightn't be exactly the same  Like when  we got ours done it wasn't the same angle  Yeah   Wh    How can you get the bay done  How can you  get the bay done   Did you get your windows done   our   Have  you to get your windows done  sometime  I don't yes but I don't know how much it would affect the whole wood there  I don't want rid of that wood really  you know round the  frame   I was thinking  that 's what they did in our house  Took all the wood away  Did they  We had a big you know all the  nineteen twenties stuff  big thick  uh frames   and replaced them with what   They 're the ones  that your  simultaneous and unclear speech  And they were alright for about sixty years  Just modern frames   Oh I don't know  What do you  well see we thought about getting just a screen  You know the way you could use it in other parts of the house as well or  but  we never found one  But just  we keep driving by this  place  you know and they they 've got the the best screens in the window because they 're just plain wooden frames with like a white gauze on them  You know  so they would let in as much light as possible but  it would still give you that wee bit of privacy  You know maybe like us sitting here in the evening time you know we don't want people gawping in  Right   Yeah   Mhm   You know like uhm  like those Japanese things like those with the black and the white  squares   We saw them  yes but they were  how much were they  They were about seven hundred pounds   4 sylls   This was a laugh  You should have seen us  We went into do you know that Tom Washington on  Washington  Place  is it  No it 's not Tom  Tom Rothwell 's place  on  Washington Place  just to get some different ideas of what to do with windows  We hadn't decided on the screen at this stage  We just wanted to look at what like a designy sort of person would have  And oh my God I was  mortified  Saw all this money and your wee man came round and started talking about the design of our house you know sort of  And uh he was talking about being up in  what was it he was saying about  What   Mhm   Yeah   Yes   Mhm   Can't remember but he said  oh we 've just done  we 've we 've we 've actually just done a house  Uh I can show you some photographs of that  And he showed us uh  I mean the room  the one of the downstairs rooms was the size of the downstairs floor basically  laughter   Yeah it was a like a country mansion set in its own grounds and everything  I was just sort of well well this is just uh  what period is the house you know  And I said well it was built nineteen ten  laughter  What 's wrong with you  It 's a it 's a it 's a terrace just off Sunnydale Street you know  laughter  Do you know them  He said well what size is the bay  you know and I sort of said like wall size or something like that  several sylls  Oh it was awful  I was so mortified  I don't think there was any reason to be  The only  reason we were embarrassed was that we couldn't  have afforded anything that he suggested   I know   We knew we didn't have any  money  at all   There 's never anybody  in there  I didn't think that shop was still open  Well they they do all their business over the phone it seems cos your man Tom Rothwell was just sitting there in a big plush chair you know  Oh yes yes yes  yes yes yes we can yeah five thousand yes yes  Was he actually there   On the way out there were a couple in  looking for a wall-hanging  I mean  I think that one there was twenty-nine pounds reduced from something  something roughly the same size  So he was saying to the couple uh  yes well this one might be more in your range  It 's only two to three thousand  Mhm   I know  You 're joking  Yeah well I mean he 's  we sort of Ted had actually had this idea cos he saw these screens you know and I mean that white screen was lovely  It was really you know the one with wee squares in it  And I said God that 's an idea  I never thought of that  So we were uh walking round anyway and we saw these other screens downstairs  And we sort of  3 sylls  that these were the Japanese screens at about seven hundred pounds or whatever  but they were very very heavily decorated  I would have preferred something a bit more plain  So I saw these ones in the corner  and they were beautiful  It was like sort of  just like a thin cast-iron frame   a wee sort of  bobbly thing like  And there was fabric stretched from one end to the other  you know so there was gaps in it  And it was really really lovely just plain  nice lines in it  I said so what about those ones  And he said they were fifteen hundred to two  thousand   Iron   Oh they were  expensive too  And I said my  I said what what  laughter  And he said it 's because of what  well apparently it 's Japanese or Chinese silk or something that the actual material is  you know and that 's why it 's  so expensive   2 sylls    Aye the frame wasn't expensive    several sylls  and all   Well I think  uhm  Spoils had them before  They 're wood and paper  Well we went  those Spoils  but they only had you know the sort of the the pine stuff the like the the wickerwork  And they were charging about sixty pounds for this very shabby-looking wicker type thing  Castle Court   As much as that  I just didn't think it was nice at all  But you see that sort of thing just the plain wooden  frame  with uhm thin material  like gauze or something   3 sylls   Yeah I mean  I have seen   Yeah   It works out cheaper   I 've  seen them somewhere  I think it was Spoils  Mine was  nice  as well  Yeah   Well you see that  Natural Interiors  place it looks as if it 's got some oul rubbish in it cos they have those big  2 sylls    The Natural Interiors on the Dublin Road  They 're nice   Where   I never noticed that  Yeah well they  several sylls  as well  They 've nice stuff though  Yeah they do  They do  Maria had sort of done  oh she 's done all the sort of hanging  3 sylls  stuff and that wickerwork stuff round the house you know  It 's very nice   Tying stuff  with  3 sylls  's always a bit  strange like   Mm mhm   What about the fireplace  What do you think of that  Not really  I mean I really like this kind of  thing  But I mean  like what do you want  I mean there 's  you can have it a big high one  No   No we don't   Do you know what I  want   Like  that line  see that line on the  wall  That could have been the top of the original one  Yeah    No that 's  the damp-proof course  Do you think so   Like you know when  whenever these houses were built  I 'm sure  they were the same as in  our house they  used to be you know ones you could actually walk under  Yeah   I know   Uh-huh  Oh God as big  as that   A priest hole  might have been  Could 've been  laughter   But do you know what I would like to do  I 'd like to just take the whole thing away  And obviously you 'd need a hearth just for fire purposes but uhm  just have a hole-in-the-wall fire  do you know and just  have for an old fireplace  And then we 'd just even have  no  no just nothing  It 's just miss  frame  here and that 's your fire  Oh that 'd be great yes  All in brick   Uh-huh   Are you not going to need to have something on the floor  That 's what I 'm saying you 'd need a hearth for fire purposes or  some  some wee  what do you call them stencils about it or something  As long as there 's something  some  3 sylls    ha  you just  if you just had like uhm  brick  the whole thing brick and actually the brick coming out you could use it as like  I think it actually went away down and in had the TV and all  Yeah   Well I 'm thinking what  else we could do  Yeah I know   several sylls    Even just for that wee bit the brick with the wee  1 syll  on it simultaneous and unclear speech   You 're coming down Sunnydale Street  on your left-hand side  it 's not that far down  And  it 's about the only house that has those kind of curtains  back and it 's   Yeah   Is it Deramore Avenue  or Sunnydale Street  Sunnydale Street   Sunnydale Street  And the bricks are like going right up to the ceiling and it 's all white and bookshelves  and there 's a big  several sylls    Yeah uh  Actually now I 'd even be tempted  just to paint that  to give it a plain colour  cos   You could  sell that fireplace  They are worth a fortune  You 're serious  Well see when they took ours out  and we didn't get any money for them  the  Housing Executive took them out  And like uh  well the one in the parlour  that  was very old  That was a really nice one  It was a bit sort of Art Nouveau and they  took it  That would 've been a packet  Mm   Mhm   Mhm   I wonder is  3 sylls  place  What bit is but that that that whole thing 's  the fireplace  Or just the  That would uhm   Don't know  to be honest with you
