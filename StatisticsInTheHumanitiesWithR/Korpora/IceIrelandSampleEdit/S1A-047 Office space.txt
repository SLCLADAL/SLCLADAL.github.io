<S1A-047 Office space>  I 'm quite pleased  with it now   Yeah  I I am too I  and I I prefer it that you don't have the shelves on the wall on both sides   sides  But unfortunately now I decided that because I haven't enough I think I haven't enough shelves  I 'm going to have them  just small shelves eight inches deep built up from there  to the roof mm yeah   Yeah   Over this press yes  yes  But that 's all  nothing  down  this side so I  should  feel a bit more spacious down there  Yeah   Yeah   Ah I think it 's grand and  I think those  shelves uhm  that you had reservations about up there are fine  aren't they   Mmm   I had  Do you think they are a bit thick   no  they 're grand now that  you 've got the   I think if I get  a few new folders maybe and  tidy up things a bit   Yeah  yeah the  books and now that you 've got them filled with stuff  there  they 're fine  Are you going to extend it as you  said   Mm   Yes   It 's coming out to the end of the desk here  Yes   Yes   yes  the same  depth  the same thing  Oh that 'll be  grand   Mm   And  then Ciaran gave me a very nice poster of the flowers of the Burren  Oh I have that as well  yes   So  I 'm going to maybe put a frame on that and  hang it up   Right  yeah yeah   My sister has that framed at home and  it 's lovely and   Yes   yeah  no it 's  it 's it 's lovely  it 's grand and  bright  and I like the  grey  mind you  I had reservations about the grey but I think it 's nice  'Tis   Indeed   I like it too  yeah  As I said  the computer is  guaranteed untouched by human hand laughs   yes  is this the new one  I couldn't wait to get it   brand new   Oh yeah   I couldn't wait to get it and  now I haven't touched it   What is it   It 's a four eight six  oh right  yes  But uh Michael Miller was supposed to  come here  I couldn't tell you how often he was supposed  to come  It 's now recorded in a corpus of English language that Michael  Miller won't  come and set me  up  but he  he really is bad  I sat here one day waiting for him and he didn't come  so  Yes   Yeah   Right    Yes   he was to come to give you a  demonstration  is it  Yeah  and I mean I  he said it 's plugged in  I said it 's not  I tried to switch it on  so I switched on that button on the  monitor  and nothing  happened  the button is down on the computer per se  down there on the ground  Yeah   Yeah   Oh right  yes  So I didn't I wasn't used to having the computer part of it on the ground  I was used to having them together   Yes  yes   So I really do want him to  come back   But what  what software packages have you  I don't   Word  three point one  I suppose  well it is three point one  I know  Unfortunately I 've three point nought at home  Win  Windows  three point one  yeah  Word for Windows   Word  oh right   Yeah   Right   Windows  point one yeah    I don't  see I 'm a  Mac  so I don't know  it 's Word Word Five I have  Mm   have you  Yeah  But it 's it 's actually very like Mac  if I switched it on  now you 'd see  but I just won't  I want him to come in and show me  I  don't want to be making mistakes  Yes  yeah   Right   yeah  So otherwise I 'm   if I could get a bit of time and tidy the desk and be uhm and  just get it   Well you need time  to  time to get  used to the   You do  you do  yeah  The new computer anyhow  you need  a few hours even if you waste them  Mm   there won't be any time now before Christmas  no  What are you doing for Christmas  Well  Last week 's Guardian was  had a very interesting trip to the Holy Land and Jordan  oh right  how nice  And uhm I was just telling Brian about it at lunch and he said it sounded very good  A very full six-day  trip  with something organised for every  day  including midnight ceremonies in Jerusalem  on Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner   Yes   Right   Yes  oh how lovely    Yes  And uhm  I thought six hundred and something sterling  That 's okay  Wasn't it very good  wasn't it  it is  Have you booked it   it only crossed  my mind  no I haven't booked it   I just thought well   Yes  It 's getting fairly  late by the hour  and you see  Israel and getting a visa  Yeah  You know  and  I have a visa for Damascus on my visa so I don't know if  Yeah   Well yeah  it 's it 's a group  you don't need a visa for Israel   need a visa for Jordan  yes  and a group visa does if they have more than twenty people  cos I was supposed to be going  last  Christmas  yeah yeah  and then the  friend  I was going with  her sister had to be  her sister died  so  it was cancelled and uhm  but we were travelling on a group visa cos we were more than twenty  people  to Jordan and  you don't need one   Israel  but you just have to see to it I think that the Israelis don't stamp your passport  Need a visa for Jordan   Really mm   Mm   Mm   Right   Oh I see   Mm   That they don't  or I 'd never get back somewhere  else again   That 's right  Something like that yeah   I think that the Damascan  yeah there 's just a lot of Arab writing on my passport at the moment  Yes  w  I suppose once I saw that this was there that I could go on  it  then I began to think look I won't go  anywhere  And I also looked into Tenerife  I 'd like  to go  For just go somewhere  And I  began to think maybe I shouldn't bother spending all that much money because I think  I have neglected I used to do Spanish last  year  and I thought maybe if I spent one month in Spain next summer  doing an intensive course  because I 've had to give up  I haven't time to do Spanish this term  It was too intensive and we had too much  homework  So I just couldn't do it at all  Right   Yes   Yeah   Right yeah   Yes   Yeah  yeah yeah   Yes   What tour operator was offering that  Spanish  Spain  Oh sorry the Jerusalem  Uhm it was in the Guardian so it was actually it looked like two girls  There were names that in London  So people in London   No no the yeah   Oh I see  Ah yes I see   I see  Yes yeah  So that 's   Well as  I say just because it was there I thought  well I would go if mother  2

Christmas and I thought  it would be  really very very interesting  Yeah   Were you going from Ireland or England  From England  Oh you can't go from Ireland  From London  But the fares to London are very cheap at that  time of year  as you 're going against the traffic  Staying in London    Yes yeah   That 's right  yeah   You 'd get  there for from Shannon you 'd get there for about seventy pounds  return   Would  you really  You would yeah  Yes   Yeah   I thought it wouldn't be a bad holiday  Uh  uh we 've had quite good weather though so I thought well  I mean I would be going to Galway for Christmas  and  it 's quite I mean it 's pleasant  enough  My sister is a great cyclist  We go out cycling  around  So I thought if the weather was  nice  it would be I would be if I wasn't sick  I was sick last  Christmas  But I 've been sick so I 'm over it  now  So I think that if I went home for Christmas maybe it would be okay  I 'll go cycling go walking and  Trouble is
