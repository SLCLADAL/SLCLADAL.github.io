<S1B-071 TEFL materials>  what was I going to say to you  Well we were just we 're not going to do anything now are we  We 'll plan what we 're going to do    We 'll  plan what we 're going to do  So we 're going  do you have a pen   Jenna   Malcolm Jenna had uhm  Jenna  has a list of stuff that  from the time of Maggie   Jenna has   Jenna is away this evening just   Oh right  A list of stuff what  You know that things that  have to be done in the resources room  Right  From uh from away back a few  years ago   Well we  you and I can work something  out can't we   We can work something out  yeah  what did what did you want to do  You 're going to do  I wanted to do materials development  uh Jenna suggested that I go through those files  Yes  And uh weed out the bad stuff  she never there was no suggestion of me actually  producing materials but I 'd like to produce materials  That 's what   Okay  yes  Right  That 's what I 'd like to do  I don't want to do  several sylls    Yeah cos you 're going to do the  the the videos and things like that   That 's what I mean  Okay  Materials development  Well I 've got a whole heap of stuff that I could add to this uh  those materials  Oh have you  Yeah  Very good  Well I have loads of stuff  You know  all the internet videos  songs  Yeah  Ah right yes   that 'd be very good  And they 'll probably want to emphasise EAP these days  So I think then that you  if you go through the files   So if I get I could  get on with that eh  Okay so  So we 'll make a note of that then Malcolm  Is that alright   sure what they want I 'm sure they don't really want materials development  I 'm sure they just want  materials tidying but  I  I don't want to do that  Yes   Yes   No  tidy up and add new materials  writes   Yeah  No  Yes  What about you Martine  So I think I 'd better start first of all with an inventory  right   Yes   Of books  Of all the books  All the books  including those ones   And then I 'd better take out those trolleys  Yes  And go through all of that again  cos that 's  Go through material and  writes   In a heap  Yes  And then  uhm  Tidy  2 sylls   Sort out course books Malcolm  Or maybe Jenna can do that  What do you mean by sorting them out  See what we have  well that would be part of the inventory  Yes  To see what we have  left of the books up there  Yeah  Ah right  all the books yes   Yeah okay  What  about  nobody 's doing cover so there 's no point in  the  idea was to direct people towards  stuff that they could do while they were on cover  But there 's nobody doing cover so there 's no point in that  Uhm   No   Yeah  Do you know what I mean  The  idea was that we would leave    information for them  Those library books could be  separated   Yeah   The library books could  be separated yeah  I had a  I had an idea the other night about those library books but it 's gone out of my head now  Inventory as well Martine  And do the inventory yeah  That 's a long big process  It is a process  What else  Uhm  Games  All those  game things    3 sylls   games  Cassettes are the big thing  I 'm not going to do them   I know  Well I think maybe Jenna could do the cassettes  phone rings    No no I think Bronagh 's teaching at the moment Sarah  Alright  puts phone down   And then all the catalogues Malcolm  Library books separated   1 syll   Cassettes you think maybe Jenna might  be able to   Yeah   Maybe  Jenna 'll do the cassettes  Maybe Jenna  We 'll put it to her  Yeah  those files  Th  those files for uhm  you know   Class  for me maybe  c  yeah maybe  And then I could look after the the general uhm tidying up of the of the resources room  if I was to if I were to write that down  type it out and give it to Tony as a possible  dr  as a  He he said he wanted he wanted to know hours  Yes   Right  So how many hours would that involve do you think for each of us   How many hours  Like a week we could do hours   Well like at the at the beginning  it  at the beginning it might  Uhm   Sorry Martine  That 'd be a lengthy process that inventory  Yes  The tidying up maybe  I don't know  What is length  What do you think per week  What do you think  I don't know  I I think we can't give him a we can't really see but we could give him a  a minimum number of hours that we would be prepared to do in a week  Right  What do you think  Three hours a week  I 'll do four  Four  That 's a minimum  for the  moment  until we  if we 've to get maybe   Four hours   Uh  I know  I spend hours doing materials Martine  I spend hours in   Well so do I Malcolm  I spend  hours doing you  know  at being in here tidying up and doing all sorts of things  Yes   We can't speak for Jenna  whatever  you know she wants to do  Maybe I I I could do four hours  No    You know   hours one  afternoon  Yeah easily  I could do   I do hours and hours before I go to start work  That 's right   that 's my own that 's  my own choice  Uhm  that 'll be it  That 's all  that  like I mean   In the mornings there when you come in   Uhm   Yeah  I could be  responsible  for for  the for the stationery renewing all the stationery and  stuff like that   Games   Mm   stationery  writes   What about these things here  Malcolm  Huh  What about all of this here  Well they 're they were all  they were all uhm  they somebody started on those and it 's all very good  But I mean is it finished  I don't know  But I think  they could be   And they 're not  used  I mean there should be  an induction  They 're not used  That 's what was in my   Yes  Even for teachers who 've been here for years  Yes  Contracts and things  an induction you  for the future  an  induction for teachers   Yes   Yes  I remember I tried  we tried it before  Remember we   And then  what we have to do then is Malcolm maybe get  put up lists  Lists of what  what we have in the resources room exactly  There used to be a list  There used to be a list  but it 's gone   So  make list available  Yeah  writes  Okay but maybe a list  maybe a  for who  For the resources room  Well it should be in the  library list  And then uhm  make a list out every week of books that are missing off the shelves  yeah  You know  I mean  I mean I 'm I 'm terribly guilty as well  I take books  upstairs and   So do we  can see  Me too  Mhm  okay  But I mean some books aren't really used except  you know on the odd occasions whereas  others are in demand  Yeah  You could uhm  one of us could be the teacher to whom other teachers go if they need  to know if they need a missing book and then the teacher could put out a  Yes that 's what I mean by that  That thinking  But I mean if a teacher needs a book and it 's missing they could  go to  one teacher and then the teacher could be responsible for  enquiring who has it  you know  Oh right   Yes  Something like that  Would you like to do that  not really Martine  I don't  want anything   Say that  again  if I   So if I  say I was looking for a book  Say you have that  book there   So I could  yes I have that book and you 're looking for it  You  could do a wee ask a wee ask around a wee  informal  ask around but uh if it 's missing then  uhm  Yes   Yes   Has to be replaced  Reported anyway missing  Reported yeah  I don't know  Ach no I don't know  What did Tony say there about what does he want Headway  Pre-Intermediate  2 sylls   John knows John   So John had  John wrote it down did he  Okay he 's to order it  So the big thing then the big thing  then is the uh what do you call it  The big  thing is   That 's just fine with me   Nobody uses  these files you see Martine  That 's what I that 's that was my my uh  I think these  these ESERP materials we could get rid of  The ESERP stuff yeah  yeah   They 're not  they 're not here anymore are they  No I think they 're finished  unless  they come back next year  So I   Is there a  But there 's stuff there maybe stuff in  those that can be   Oh yeah  No I mean the files   reused  but I mean in their present form  Yes   Yeah  This here I 'll leave cos that 's nothing to do with me  rubbish  there  Uh but uh  Yeah yeah   So what about all this EAP stuff that we 're supposed to get together  I don't know anything about that  Us  Well if we 're going to be in the resources room  Materials  Yes  What does that involve Martine  Does that involve photocopying the book  Sure that 's a waste of time  That 's   Yes and  it 's a waste of time  Of course it 's a waste of time  That 's what that 's all about there  I could make EAP materials  Develop EAP materials based  on  newspapers and  radio programmes and the internet  Yes   That would be good   stuff   Yes  real stuff  I could I  mean I   Yeah  That would  be good Malcolm  That 's a good  idea   Including  EA  well I don't know  It I mean  you know  that would make  more sense  That  wouldn't it  Yeah yes   Yes   Actually that would be very good for you to do that from the point of  view of your  CV thing  go ahead   Mhm mhm  but I mean uh  anyway  that would be  and some of these files are never used  Yes   Never used  They 're there they 're there from the days of uhm  Maggie Lock  They 're good  They 're  fine   Yes  She 's got some good  things now   They 're great  I mean  but they 're never used which  But what I find Malcolm is that the the teachers just go in and they do their own thing and they don't bother  I do that  We all do it to an extent
