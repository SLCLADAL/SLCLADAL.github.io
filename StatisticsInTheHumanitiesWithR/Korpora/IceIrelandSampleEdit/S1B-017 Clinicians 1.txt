<S1B-017 Clinicians 1>  so we all survived anyway  laughter   Yeah   Yeah   Just  about   Okay uhm so you just need to go through yeah and evaluate your session plans uh written or whatever    When  when do you want them for sorry  Uhm today is it  Well I suppose if you can have them done by this afternoon yeah great  Is that possible  Yeah   Yeah   Okay  so those for this afternoon and then uhm you need to be thinking about for next week okay what you 're going to do  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   So oh just actually to go back to today in terms of the people who are doing groups right uhm  When you did the group rules I  I  Is it safe to assume the rules were generated by both yourselves and the people who were the members of the group  Yeah   Yeah   Yes   Okay and so I 'd recommend that you write them down  uhm  and review them at the beginning of every  group session whatever  Okay   Okay  When you say review them what do you mean  like   Just  go through what the group rules are   Okay  So before we start it just go back  over  uhm the rules we decided on last week  That kind of thing  Okay   Okay   And would you suggest that we uhm  like throughout the weeks you know the way especially these lead-up weeks to Christmas  that we keep reviewing things that we keep saying to them well like this is just the  you know  the beginning  assess  the initial stages of the  therapy  Anything you find now tell me we can and then we can incorporate it into the therapy sessions  each week   Initial stages   Yeah  I  yeah I guess it 's going to depend on what specifically you 're doing  Do you know what I  mean  So that if for example you are doing vocabulary and you decide to do geography words we 'll say whatever  and like you do five words per session  Uh but that yeah you 'd probably have a look if you on your second session you 're go back at what words you did on the previous session  Is that what you mean  No   Yes   No   I mean with things like rules  opinions  approaches to things  that they  like that they know that they can comment on it and  that they can  2 sylls  it   Oh of course  And if so if they  think of any new rules or any rules that they think  aren't  you know necessary  or   Yeah   Anymore  and stuff  right   Absolutely  yeah  Of course they can yeah   Uh and then the other thing actually just  I don't know did anyone find in their groups today that they were maybe one uh participant who was more dominant than another  and  somebody who didn't really get a chance to kind of speak  Did you find that  Mm   No I thought they were all speaking  I don't know cos  Jamie wasn't there  But  I just thought that Michele was very like  whatever you know  type thing  And  you know I did try and include her like all the time uhm  but she was kind of reluctant  then I felt I suppose  the guy    was kind of like  uh you know the cool guy but then again he 's a guy amongst four girls   So I  don't know  I 'll just wait til next week and see really  Okay   Okay   Ah who Glen yeah   Yeah   Yeah I think really that that 's the key thing  isn't it  that this week was quite  unstructured  You 're kind of just getting to  know each other   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah  and they didn't know they were together and  that kind of thing like so   Yeah exactly  So  it 's going to take a while for the group to gel like whatever so I wouldn't give  up hope   Yeah   It 's okay  I haven't  laughter  uhm I wouldn't give up hope yet  It 's yeah I think it 's you know it 's challenging  They 're  a challenging  age group because you know   Yeah   Mm  and there 's  a lot of them and they all talk together  I was lucky with the two thankfully there was only two put into my small group  But I think with the larger groups  yeah we want them to respect you and like you and all that but  I think we still need to hold a slight not even a slight but  you are authority  You you are the person in charge  Like you being kicked that was totally and utterly  unacceptable  I like  I would have  freaked  Not freaked but I would have actually  Yeah   I did   But no I took care of it like  but  it you know it still happened you know  Yeah   But that 's  what I mean I mean what how are we to deal with that I mean  But then   Like how authoritative  How authoritative  yeah can you know   Yeah     Well I  just said to them look straight off that 's not on  It 's not going to happen  It 's  it won't be  That 's not the way it 's going to be and if it continues  you know I 'm going to have to deal with it in another way or whatever  Like  I mean it stops  you know  But it 's just they were just trying to prove a point I 'd say  Mm   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah and I think it is it 's a tricky issues alright  because   Yeah   No cos you  cos you don't are you the therapist or are you kind of a dictator  Exactly and that you kind of assume maybe that at that age they will be able to participate in a  group  without resorting  laughter  to kicking you and kicking each other   Yeah   We had six year olds last year and  they were fabulous like preschoolers even  do you know   Yeah you see like  you don't know I mean  You assume that you kind of treat them in an  you approach  them  with an adult kind of perspective and you think that they should be able to   Yeah   Reciprocate that adult yeah   I still think you should do that though    yeah absolutely uh exactly  but it 's just that then  when they behave like that it 's kind of surprising  because you  think oh  Oh I 'm not saying you shouldn't   Yeah   Because it 's easy just to slip into a teacher kind of a  You yeah and that kind of  dynamic you know of I 'm in charge  And that 's not therapeutic  you  know   Role yeah  Charge yeah  And be quite like yeah you know   That 's  not therapeutic but then I think  we 're just we 're in a school situation  I think I 'm I 'm totally for the  therapeutic  way of approaching of thing  I mean of all the people  I 'd I 'd be very much for that   Oh yeah   And yes but you 're the group 's  leader like  and facilitator   You would still  yeah  You 're a facilitator  Still you mean you need to  make sure   Is there anything  like we could flick through on the group dynamics or anything like  that   Yeah   I wonder  Now I can't think of anything off the top of my head I have to say  But maybe  There should be some somewhere I suppose if you just went  through a book on group therapy   There yeah  on because there should be stuff on group  work we 'll say   Clinical practicum  actually I think there 's one  or two books on that   Michael  2 sylls    And maybe that one I know that you said it 's out I 'll have a look at that one the Wallik and Butler one and see if there 's anything about  Wal   Wallik and Butler  I can't think of the name but do you remember Lisa Marie I gave you the reference  Yup  Uhm and that 's all about  kind of language development in relation to the curriculum  and  the classroom and working with adolescents  Oh   Oh yeah I actually yeah  I had that book   But I think  you were saying all the copies are out  in the libraries   Yeah all the copies  are out when I was looking  I 'm after booking one   Is that the pink one   Yeah  And   I left  I left it in yesterday  It 's there for you  Oh okay  Yeah I didn't see that  3 sylls   Okay I yeah I 'm not that familiar with it but there might be something in  it  or any of the uh kind of clinical practice books  might have stuff on groups   Okay   You know what would be good too    That course that we do  used to do in fourth year  It 's like  the teacher comes in and gives you this picture of all friends playing in the yard and  ye all 've to talk about what it is and it 's giving you  oh what 's the name of the course  The course you do  Uh assertiveness is it  No it 's not assertiveness  It 's like  the new CSPE course that they do for in schools now  SPHC  SPHC yeah  It 's like that but it 's  Mm  Is it civics  Like civics is it    Oh okay   Those books have all are all into how  how  you lead a group and how  I was  that 's where I got that thing over at my  my sister 's big into it  And she 's like Michele the way she 's pure oh I 'm so cool  You get her to do  everything  in the group  You get her to hand out the sheets  You get her to collect the sheets  because  she 's being miss cool because she actually wants attention  She 's  uhm  there 's a niche in her  in her like in her mm  whatever that I  don't I 'll get one off my sister cos my sister is  does that course  so she does   Kind of   Oh right   Mm   Oh okay   Yeah   That 'd be a good book  What 's it called Lisa Marie   But there must  be I 'm sure yeah if you do like  a literature search  or whatever and something came up about  the dynamics  Uhm and try that is it I X quick dot com  There 's a    5 sylls    What is it  IX quick  WWW  dot IX quick  dot  Yeah  I   Q-U-I-C-K   Dot com  Is it IX quick IX  qu  quick  Ah it 's very good  It searches loads of  Yeah   What is it  a search  engine   But it searches about I don't know how many everything   right   It 's a meta  search engine   4 sylls  a train  laughter  Very clever  That 's what I heard about from it as well  Is  1 syll  done with it  Yeah so you can you can just type in group plus dynamics plus  whatever  and  it rates things into in this like there 's stars as to which with the most is the best one  match  3 sylls    That 's great   Oh very  good now   Uhm so yeah I mean there 'd no  shortage of that kind of stuff
