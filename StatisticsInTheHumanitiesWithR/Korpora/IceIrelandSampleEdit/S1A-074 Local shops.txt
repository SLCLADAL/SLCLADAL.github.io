<S1A-074 Local shops>  Well I walked past that you know that shop that you were talking about in Donnybrook  Havana or whatever it 's called  Oh yeah  I walked past that coming back from uhm Mass  They have a gorgeous dress in the window  Th  they have the most  beautifu  they have exactly your style   Yes they have  they have  We saw it the other night yeah  Their their their  the clothes are your style  And in a way some of them are even  magazine style   In fact they had  a couple of browns on  not dissimilar to what you 've on  there 's some lovely stuff  I 'd say it 's very expensive isn't it  Well it 's expensive  No it 's not very expensive but it 's expensive  apparently it 's run by your one who uhm  she was manageress  of the design centre in  the Powerscourt centre   She was manageress   So I believe   I don't know who she is now but I saw that in  the paper   I don't know  her name  several sylls   sneeze   God bless us  They 've lovely stuff  I 'd even wear it myself but they wouldn't have it in my size you know  but they 've a beautiful dress in the window  It 's kind of it 's a bodice kind of thing and it 's purple  It 's lovely very nice   It 's long  Well no it 's dark purple  like a a claret kind of  colour   Purple   Mm   They must 've changed it so from yesterday night  Ah they change these things every so often you know  We were there one night last week you see  But you should have a look  Yeah it 's just it 's out of my way  I mean I 'd  I 'm never walking out that way you know  Mm  So I 'd have to make a concerted effort to pass it  You 'll be pleased to know I wrote to Trish  Did you  Good  Sorry  I was just saying I 've written to Trish  Oh good  You never know we might even get a line back  Well nevertheless now it 's good that you did  I was thinking of doing it myself  last night  At the same time now that you 've covered it so it 's okay  Well I haven't got that much to say to her but just to keep in touch  Well neither do I  laughter   Well nevertheless it 's not so much that but when you 're away it 's nice to get a letter  Well I suppose it 's nice to get a letter when you 're at home as well  less  And I 'll be expecting a postcard  from Paris  From who   From who   Paris  Oh yes  Sure we 'll be only there for uh  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah just a few days yeah mm hmm  Will you be able to count that on your TAB account do you think  Mm  I suppose so  Hope so  What did our Edel ever do with remember she  told to me when she 'd be back from America that they wouldn't take her thing coming through  What did we ever do with her return stub from America  They wouldn't take her what coming through  When she was uh trying to get the TAB counted coming back  from America  They couldn't or they wouldn't take it  did she   Oh I don't know  I 'd never heard about that I haven't a notion  Don't know  I don't know  Has she been home in the last few months no  5 sylls   What is it about ten days or a fortnight  The twentieth   Nearly a  fortnight  The twentieth  a month  This day five weeks is Christmas day  We 'll have our Christmas dinner over  How many shopping days  God  Did you see they were transporting Santa from Switzers to Brown Thomas the other day in town  and all everyone was stopped  They got this crane right  and it was kind of like Santa arriving in Brown Thomas  Because now you 're never gonna guess Dad  Switzer 's window is no more  Oh  Ah it 's it 's horrible  Switzer 's window isn't any more  No because you know they were renovating it or they were redoing it and they can't do the windows  So what they 've done is they have kind of a makeshift one in Brown Thomas windows but it 's crap  Mmm  And it 's terrible  It 's awful because  every year we 've always been awful  So anyway  they were  Santa was arriving in Brown Thomas the other  day    4 words    Who was this now   You mean the  real Santa  Yeah he was arriving yeah  And uhm they got this crane yoke and he he was transported from uhm Switzer 's over to Brown Thomas in the air  In the in the lifted  up and  all the kids could see could they  Yeah   he was arriving  Forget the reindeers  A crane will do nicely  Well I remember a being uh Paddy saying to me one time oh years ago  I was there was a time I think I was saying to her about uhm being out in Baldonnel looking for apples  and eh the way you I only had the two of you at the time  And one of you said to me Edel probably said to me something about uhm how do apples get on trees  How do what  How do apples get on trees  And I said well God puts them there  And she said to me and who 's God  And I I  I was aghast you see at  several sylls  shortly afterwards I mean  They might say the same now if you asked them  but go on  several sylls    Yeah  shortly afterwards  Ciara and that were here  shortly afterwards Ciara and those were here for dinner one night and I was saying this to Ciara and she says but why were you puzzled  For God 's sake I said you 'd think that after being in school for a year she 'd have heard of God even if she didn't hear it at home  She says Maggie she says you 're so old-fashioned  She says we don't teach about God in school  We talk about  baby Jesus in school  So fair enough  And then she went on from that and it must 've been in the Autumn  Later on we were talking about Santa and that  and I was saying about Santa coming down the chimney  And she says gee she says but you 're so old-fashioned  She said we have no chimneys in our house  They hadn't in this scheme  She says all the children in this scheme know  that Santa comes by spaceship  laughter  I wouldn't have thought of it  But no child nobody in the scheme thought that Santa came by chimney   5 words    Baby Jesus  I see   Hard to believe Phil said to me  he says this evening five weeks it 'll be Christmas Eve no Christmas Day he said  I must say I hadn't realised  2 sylls   Well I haven't even thought  about doing anything   And all the work  that 's got to be done before Christmas  I suppose you haven't been in town lately so you haven't seen the Christmas  decorations   No   No bar yesterday  now was the nearest I 've been in you know  But I mean the decorations have been there for the last few weeks   What did Jimmy say to you this morning  He was very conciliatory  actually   Had they  spotted you before you knocked  No I put in the letter before I went out  I thought it was better to continue  Aisling  calling   So I said in the letter I got the biro from you  Mm  So I wrote the letter and put in the thing cos I knew they they usually take a late Sunday morning  Mmm  They 're Donnybrookers in that sense  Mmm  So  Anoth  Another track coming at me now yeah yeah  I put in the letter in the  Letterbox  Letterbox  So I said I 'd call in on my way back  So Aisling said she 'd like to come in as well  Had they found the letter by the time you actually  No actually  They were still in bed then  But it was twelve o'clock and they usually go to half twelve Mass so I thought I was safe enough on ringing the bell  at that stage  but I wasn't  Nell came out in her dressing gown  and your man came out in his bare feet putting on his clothes  Mm mm   Mm  So I look and I 'm sorry to disturb you  Really I I didn't earlier I put in a letter but  I didn't want to disturb you  but I says we 've a bit of a problem  I explained how then  several sylls  to come out and see it so  And he came out in his toes you know  Yeah yes  my only unease about it I thought that they 'd take it fairly well but my only unease was in case he 's keeping these Austin Cambridges as kind of  period items for resale you know  Mm mm mm  Albeit they wouldn't be very usable but  Don't like the look of it  laughter   some people have this  fetish for cars  But  several sylls  he said the right thing to Aisling  Ah he says for God 's sake don't worry about that and so on  He says it 's a good job it wasn't a crash into a car that there was somebody in it  Yeah  He said and he hoped nothing worse happens to her in her driving career  You know he he did very well  Mm mm  So in a sense I was glad she was there  On the other hand I was a bit nervous of her being there in case he got cross  Yes yeah yeah  Cos it would hit her you know  So uh I told him and I showed Jimmy but I says  it is a nuisance and he apologised about it  So I was happy  And we will repay all the cost  several sylls  But it 's not that  She got quite a land alright  She came up to me  2 sylls  and I was asleep  And she was asking she  I don't know what she said to me and I turned and I looked at her and I said what did you say  And she said it again  So I sat up in the bed and I looked at her and I knew it was awfully serious to look at the face  And I said Aisling what 's wrong  I don't know what you 're talking about  And then she said it again  Cos she didn't say anything about a car or having been out  Uh she hit Jimmy is I thought what she said you see you know so   several sylls    That 's  probably what she did say  But uh she sat down on the bed then and she was  not quite shaking but not  do you know yeah  quite shocked  Shocked  mm  So she went over to Edel then in the afternoon  And Edel crashed her car  Totalled   She totalled  her mother 's car  He  her mother 's car was a total write-off  about a month after Louise got her full  driving licence  She went into the back of a car and totalled it  You know well I mean if you think the best type of accident to have at this stage  You know  a car with no-one in it   It 'll make her careful  It 'll make her careful  She admits that she was coming out you see  that car  moves very  the wheel on that you can do an awful lot of things with it that you can't do with mine and she was coming out just that little bit fast and didn't turn the wheel  fast enough  Where my car 's so slow in the off take  that it 'd be less likely to happen you know  Mmm that 's right   Well I I probably was foolish in that but anyhow but I just thought if she  it would give her the feeling if she could take it from the door and do normal driving and come back  when 'tis quiet on a Sunday morning  Ah and you did the right thing certainly  cos she didn't want to go and you called  her again  and she says oh no no  I said Aisling if you don't go now you 'll never go again   No no   When did Trisha ring  She rang during the week this  Tuesday or Thursday   Oh did she  I wasn't talking to her   I wasn't talking to her at all  No I don't think she rang during the week  She did ring during the week  I uh I told you what night she rang  I heard she rang but  Yeah it was it was  it was a day uh weekday  That was a good while ago  Ah it was during last week sometime  I wrote to her on Tuesday  It was Tuesday night I think she rang  It must 've been  I 'd say it was probably Tuesday night alright  And I had actually written to her that day  It would 've been the Wednesday probably because it was the night that I wasn't in  Okay it was probably Wednesday  It might have been Wednesday    3 words    Ah she won't ring tonight so  I don't think she 'll ring tonight  1 word   Next Saturday she 'll ring she won't she 'll probably just ring to say when she 's coming I mean  Oh that 's five or six weeks away  Not at all  'tisn't  It 's only three  Oh no it 's more  You 're right  About four weeks  It 'll be nice for her coming home for her first Christmas  like that then  I always think it is  Mm mm mm   It 's going to be you know the way you normally see on the news all those returning  returning  emigrants and everything  And now it can you 'll be the parents of a returning emigrant and you 'll be  weeping when she 's going again   Yeah yeah   Dublin airport 's always  very nice for those  things   Christmas 's  lovely there  Yeah yeah  They always have lots of light and  And they 've really gone up-market now with those snowmen yokes  You know they 're  nice  Cos do you remember when we were small they had this huge Santa on the front of the building  Do you remember  Aye
