<S2B-003 Mortar bomb>  Police have described as imbeciles the IRA terrorists who launched a mortar bomb attack on a Newry police station  Thirty-three people were injured and a dozen others treated for shock  A soldier remains critically ill  Two other soldiers and two policemen were also hurt  The rest of the injured were all civilians  Three mortars were launched from a lorry by the IRA gang on the police army base in the centre of Newry  Two landed inside injuring five  The third overshot the station and landed in nearby Catherine Street  Over twenty-five were injured here  including a two year old child  It was just about five minutes to nine  I was coming down the stairs of the workshop here and heard a loud explosion  Uh on hearing that I came out onto the street and went round the corner obviously  police barracks wasn't too far away and that was my first suspicion  So at that stage shrapnel started falling down round us here  There was several pieces of metal just fell very close to us here in the vicinity and then there was two further bangs uh uh the third one being the loudest  So we just question asked   Well at that stage when I looked up the street you could see absolutely nothing only dust  and several people came running down the street bleeding heavily  We 're all a bit shaky now  Uh a couple of nuns coming in as well  They were fairly badly shaken as well  Uh they were taken up to the hospital as well for shock uhm  a young fella running down as well  he got caught with glass so he did in his hand uh  His hand just actually opened up like a book  He like he got caught in the middle of it  He 'd a glass through his  A senior police officer in the area says the terrorists hold the people of Newry in complete disregard  This was a completely mindless attack uh this morning which really so easily could have turned into a major disaster  These uhm these imbeciles lobbed what amounts to three gas cylinders across commercial property over the top of uh a very busy street uh towards the police station  Now one of the mortars as you will have noticed behind me uh crashed into the street beside the uh commercial property in between the uh police station and and uh and uh shop  exploded causing fairly severe damage  The other two mortars uh landed inside the base causing uh severe structural damage to the building  Now we totally condemn this uh attack  Those injured  thirty-three in all  were ferried to Daisy Hill Hospital in the town  Newry Council 's vice-chairman talked to some of them  I talked to a woman at seventy years of age who was blown out of her bed  I talked to a young girl about twenty-one that just could not stop crying with shock  I 've talked to a mother of one young boy that has gone to theatre for surgery  It makes me very mad and very angered to think that the people who planted this were bound to know that there would be civilian casualties  The Presbyterian Moderator was also there to give support to the injured  I would utterly condemn those who have been responsible for uh such a callous crime and I would call it a crime  to aim uh mortars at a police station  one doesn't know where they 're actually going to fall and obviously a good many uh civilians along with security forces have been injured today and so we condemn it utterly  Daisy Hill has a disaster emergency plan which swung into operation within minutes of the mortars exploding  The injuries   range from severe life-threatening injuries in the most seriously injured uh to uh shock and uh you know emotional upset  How would you say the hospital coped this morning  I think we coped very well  We were we reacted within a few minutes  We had uh as I say a full trauma team standing by uh of comprising emergency personnel  surgeons anaesthetists  There was an ambulance at the scene when I got there and I was at the scene of the explosion within a few minutes  At least three of those injured  a policeman and two soldiers  were later transferred to hospital in Belfast  One civilian is still being treated at Daisy Hill  Army bomb experts have spent the entire day working on the tipper lorry the terrorists used as a launching pad for their mortars  It was hijacked near Silver Bridge last night and parked on the other side of the base early this morning  It 's not the first time the IRA has attacked this base  In nineteen eighty-five ten mortars were launched at it  killing nine police officers  It was the highest death toll suffered by the RUC since the beginning of the Troubles  Just a short time ago the Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew visited Newry to see for himself the damage caused in this latest attack Patrick Mayhew speaks   Cardinal Cathal Daly has repeated that the IRA campaign is morally sinful and evil  In his first comments since last weekend 's Sinn Fe/in conference he said Sinn Fe/in can play a full part in the political process when the IRA ceases violence  The Cardinal also called for a full investigation into the murder of Roseanne Mallon after the discovery of a camera near the scene of the shooting in County Tyrone  He said serious questions needed to be asked about the circumstances of the killing to allay understandable suspicion  And this afternoon the RUC denied there was photographic evidence about the murder of Mrs Mallon  However a statement says operations carried out by the army are in support of the RUC  They were authorised at senior police level after careful consideration  The RUC says the equipment discovered in County Tyrone is not the property of those who are now holding it  The police say a criminal offence is being committed and they 're not receiving the co-operation that is required  Loyalist paramilitary groups including the UVF and the UFF have attacked Unionist politicians over their public disagreements about the way forward here  In a statement the Combined Loyalist Military Command said what they called the petty bickering and personal acrimony should give way to calm and reasonable debate between the Ulster Unionists and the DUP  The ink was barely dry on the Downing Street Declaration before the cracks started to appear in relations between the DUP and the Ulster Unionists  The DUP roundly rejected the agreement  the Unionists gave it a guarded welcome  And the divisions are still wide  Only this week the DUP told John Major they wouldn't be having anything to do with plans for inter-party talks while the Unionists said they were ready willing and able to talk  The strains between the two Unionist parties have also led to personal attacks  the most controversial  Ian Paisley 's branding of Jim Molyneaux as a Judas  But now the Combined Loyalist Military Command which includes the UVF and the UFF have called for an end to what they call the petty bickering and personal acrimony  They say there 's dismay at the lack of cohesive leadership at what they say is the time of Ulster 's greatest need  David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party is close to Loyalist thinking  I imagine that 's the statement today is not about apportioning the blame to specific people  The realities are of course that uh we have just suffered a relatively acrimonious uh election  We 've had many calls uh  cat calls if you like about one or the other  The reality is while  all that 's going on uh people in this country are burying their dead  or bandaging their wounded and are worrying about the black hole which looks to be the future  Uh we can do much better uh to face the monolith of as Sinn Fe/in would call it  Nationalist Ireland  Unionism must weld together  must get their act together  If anyone looks they 'd be hard pressed to find where where we have been involved in in name-calling  I think we 've got to get back to a more mature relationship where mature people can agree to disagree and agree on the on the higher and the more important points  I see what caused the differences in the past now beginning to unravel  I think that even the most optimistic of  of people cannot believe that the Downing Street Declaration is the way to peace in Northern Ireland  The statement from the Combined Loyalist Military Command also refloats an idea they first suggested several months ago for a forum encompassing all shades of Unionist opinion  Nothing was done about it then and it would appear that the two Unionist parties are divided about its potential value now  I think that if you 're going to have a common approach then obviously you must talk about what that approach is going to be and what your goal is going to be and the best way of  Unionists talking is to talk within some kind of forum  I I would uh doubt if a forum can resolve the problem if the if uh the present situation continues uh uh as I say I believe that it can be resolved without that but we 'll look at that when it  when if it arises  Fire Chiefs believe the deaths of twenty year old Margaret Wilson and thirty year old Kenneth McPeake in a blaze in a flat in Ballymena this morning may have been prevented if a smoke alarm had been fitted to the building  The cause of the fire is still being investigated  The flames were spotted by a passer-by in the flat above commercial premises in Thomas Street just after six-thirty this morning  The fire brigade were on the scene in minutes  Prior to our arrival there was a  a number of people in the street and the young lady who died in this fire was seen at the bedroom window and the  the people were  coaxing this young lady to jump  For some reason she did not jump  The room filled with smoke behind her and she disappeared into the smoke and sadly uh she died in the  in the fire  The dead woman was twenty year old Margaret Wilson who lived at the flat  Thirty year old Kenneth McPeake from Ballykeele in the town was the other victim  Neighbours say the young woman had just moved into the flat about three months ago  They say there appeared to be a party there last night  The deaths have stunned the community  Well I looked out about a quarter to seven  I heard glass breaking  I thought it was windows getting broke  I looked out and it was the place across the street was on fire  And then there was an awful loud bang and the smoke seemed you 'd have thought it was coming out the roof and everywhere you know  It was well gone when I saw it  Nobody could ever  several sylls   The fire brigade believe the fire started in the living-room  The bodies of the two young victims were found upstairs  They did not appear to have been burned but died of smoke inhalation  The Fire Chief at the scene says if the building had been fitted with a smoke alarm they might have had a chance to escape  My advice to people is  get a smoke alarm  test it weekly  have an escape plan for your home  You may be cut off from certain parts of your home in a fire  Have alternative routes to get out  and put it into practice  It is vitally important that we do that  And that 's it from the news desk for now  I 'll be here with more news in about fifteen minutes break in news broadcast   Two Dromore men have appeared in court charged with possession of two rifles in the town last Saturday  Twenty-eight year old Stephen Campbell an unemployed welder of Park Hill and John McEvoy a lorry
