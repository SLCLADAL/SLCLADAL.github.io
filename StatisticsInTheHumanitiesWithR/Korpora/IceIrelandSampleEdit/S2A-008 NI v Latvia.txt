<S2A-008 NI v Latvia >  Has the referee given it  He has  So the  4 sylls  as Michael Hughes lines this one up  Good ball then  And it 's Gray  Philip Gray just couldn't get there with the header  Northern Ireland 's tenth game in group three  Latvia 's twelfth and last  And no wins in those eleven games so far  I think they 've scored just four goals along the way  several sylls  oh he hit it  4 sylls  couldn't find the target  The man who 's got three goals so far in this World Cup campaign  Shake of the head there  Says it all  The ball fell to him but he couldn't find the target  Latvia 've come here very much the underdogs but they feel that Northern Ireland were lucky to get that two one win in Riga back in June  Free kick given  A chance for  the Latvians to move forward  So every green shirt I can tell you is  behind the ball  Tommy Wright lining things up  So will he try it  He does  Well over the top  That is uh Popkovs the number six who plays for  3 sylls  in Sweden  No trouble for Wright  Swirling breeze here in Windsor Park  Not making things easy for the keepers  Aleksejs Sarando  Popkovs gets it through to Babicevs  Wright by Magilton  forward by Taggart  2 sylls  for Gray  They 've had a wrestling with the defender and the free kick given  Northern Ireland just three defeats in group three so far but significantly those were against Denmark  the Republic and Spain the three teams all vying for those two qualifying places for the finals  Sarando  plays that cool  Gives it to  3 sylls  They 've given it away   Lands on the back there of Iain Dowie by Gnedojs  To Michael Hughes  He 's recovered from a knee operation he had this summer  Still playing in the basketball for Strasbourg  Free kick for Hughes  It 's all the way through  And the crowd feeling he might 've been pushed over there  The referee  is having none of it  I don't think Mr Dowie had a case really  Popkovs  2 sylls  couldn't get there  This is Linards who 's looking for Jelisejevs  Couldn't find him   several sylls  And Latvia 's enjoying a bit of possession  This is Babicevs  Too long for Linards  2 sylls  just couldn't keep it in  Nigel Worthington gives it to Tommy Wright  Fleming  And Niall trying to build it back  Stolen by Gray  It 's a free kick for Cousins  laughter  Getting in there before Sarando   6 sylls  beat all of them and the goal kick goes to Northern Ireland  And there you can see it the rain  It it really is coming down here  Torrential rain  coming into the commentary box as well into the lens of our cameraman  It 's a night like this that a commentator 's notes get soaked  I 'll do my best to keep you in touch  Babicevs  gets the free kick  To his right this is Ivanovs  It 's Popkovs  Popkovs  talk about having a pop  He did but it didn't work out  Bit of a  1 syll  keep them in their place at the moment I would think  Tommy Wright  And I believe Nottingham Forest are here watching the keeper tonight  There could be a transfer for Tom very soon  seems to have settled into midfield at the moment  Jimmy Quinn  Good control from Dowie  Kevin Wilson  2 sylls  by Magilton  Dowie lets it go  Dowie  several sylls  cheers and applause  Coming up to ten minutes gone  It 's all been very quiet so far  It 's uh  4 sylls  the number eight  playing as sweeper  as Northern Ireland try to make the breakthrough  Oh that 's a good ball in from Donaghy  Dowie is there  No trouble for Karavajevs  Iain Dowie two goals for Southampton so far this season  several sylls  Worthington good ball in  Couldn't find Hughes  several sylls  Here 's Mal Donaghy  several sylls   Well skid away on the slippery surface  The goal kick  goes to Latvia  Northern Ireland since uh losing eight two to Scotland in nineteen forty-nine  this is their eighty-third World Cup game  and their twelfth World Cup campaign  As you 'll all know they 've qualified for three finals Sweden in fifty-eight Spain eighty-two and Mexico eighty-six  So a very pedestrian start here at Windsor Park  It 's hardly surprising considering the conditions  Worthington pushes it forward  Couldn't find Magilton  Linards  Latvia playing some nice football  Popkovs lets it go all the way through to  Sarando  Popkovs  2 sylls  cross will usually come out  finds Gray  Fleming  several sylls  Fleming again  Gray Gray 's  4 sylls  This is a good one from Northern Ireland  Gray gives it left to Hughes  Wright 's to run at them as he did out in Riga  Magilton  did well to recover  Worthington  several sylls  Referee tonight from Portugal  Pinto Correi/a  Sevlakovs playing snooker taking the goal kicks  Well blocked by Quinn  The ball too long for Michael Hughes  Michael Hughes  twelfth cap for him this evening  Play the other side at twenty-two  years of age  sporting a new short haircut  Long kick from Wright  Looks for Dowie  Got the flick on  several sylls  That 's Ivanovs under a bit of pressure  Wilson to throw in  Worthington  a chance to deliver  He does  Dowie put it in here  Oh what a kick in  It took a deflection  several sylls  Worthington  trying to get a bit of urgency  Hughes  Worthington outside if he needs him  Referee wants a word with  Babicevs  Hughes about to go on a run  and all brought to an end  Worthington gets about Worthington  well into the middle  right across the goal mouth  The Latvians get it out  Mal Donaghy  Taggart  Dowie makes the run on the right  The defender Iain Dowie did very well  to keep the situation   5 sylls  losing out in the end  Babicevs  an aimless ball  Was hoping that uh Ivanovs would 've made some ground on the far side  He didn't  Northern Ireland have it again  Dowie  4 sylls  runs up there at the front being well policed at the moment  Forward by Taggart  Followed by Dowie  This is Magilton 's header  Tommy Wright had to pick it up of course  several sylls  Wilson keeps it in   several sylls  in a moment  Nigel Worthington  Looks like a chance to move forward  Still Dowie to Taggart  Still has it  He hasn't now  Babicevs  Worthington  To Mick Taggart  Quinn lets it go  Fleming  Here 's Quinn  He hit it  Looking for the  3 sylls  is Jimmy Quinn  And it was well worth the effort  but it just wouldn't come down for him  Well clear of the crossbar  Not too much excitement for the fans as yet  Babicevs gives it away  Here 's Worthington  Long long ball  all the way through to Karavejevs  goalkeeper who plays in Cyprus  Here comes Gnedojs  Could be the sign of trouble  several sylls  Dowie to be fair putting himself about  So twenty minutes  on the watch  Still scoreless  as Northern Ireland prepare to take this free kick  Hughes is there  Magilton is there  All the big men are forward  Hughes takes it  It 's off the head of Taggart  Gerry Taggart up there  He 's got two World Cup goals  in this campaign  It wasn't to be that time  Quinn  Magilton  Worthington  run by Ivanovs  Worthington  Philip Gray  run down  After a seven match programme he 's lucky to be alive  He almost lost his left eye in a very bad car crash  just a few months ago after his move to Sunderland for eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds from Luton  Pop  Popkovs  Northern Ireland move forward again  Worthington takes it quickly  Magilton  Mal Donaghy  Gray turned it well  Gave it away though  A chance for Latvia to move forward  Popkovs coming out of this left-hand side  Linards  turned well  Kevin lost his footing and the ball  Dowie wins it back  Gives it to Fleming  It 's down the line  Half-way through the first half it 's still Northern Ireland nil Latvia nil  Kevin Wilson  Oh he 's done well  Dowie almost on his knees  he was on his knees  several sylls  Good ball then from Wilson  There it was off the defender  Hughes thinking about the  2 sylls  with Kevin Wilson  Once again Quinn is up there  Taggart is up there  It 's off the defenders ' heads  Ivanovs kept it in  Number ten that was Worthington bumbling into the back of him  Have to get a new ball  Not often you lose a ball at a World Cup game but there you go  Northern Ireland coming here tonight of course very much the favourites even expecting a win and a convincing win at that  Now we have two balls on the pitch  And in the four games at home Northern Ireland only one win  That was the three nil against Albania  They 've had two draws against Lithuania and Spain  and then that defeat by Denmark  But uh everyone Billy Bingham and his players expecting to win this one but at the moment they 're making heavy weather of it  Taggart  several sylls  take it again  That 's Magilton  several sylls  Giving away the free kick  Magilton looks to take it quickly  Gets it inside  Donaghy  Hits a deflection and another corner kick to Northern Ireland  Mal Donaghy lining one up there  Eighty-fifth cap but still to score at international level  And on a night like this well worth a try  Magilton takes it  Dowie 's at the back  Just couldn't climb high enough Iain Dowie  The long long ball  Dowie up  and off the target  Jelisejevs ' header  Sarando  The ball beats him and Fleming  Northern Ireland settle for the throw in  Sarando one of the men who play in Sweden  Dowie  3 sylls  Magilton  Only Hughes up front at the moment and he finds him  Hughes covered by Ivanovs  The crowd don't like the impact with Hughes  Latvia have it  The chance of a break  Babicevs waits for support  Finds it in Popkovs  Babicevs again comes left to Linards  who 's been quite subdued so far this evening  They really had a good game in Riga  There 's  3 sylls  to Troickis  A long long ball  Fleming gets the header  several sylls  Fleming gets it back   several sylls  Gray making ground  He 's got Gray in the middle  He 's got Dowie in the middle  Gray tried to get back  Ball in  Gray arriving  but no trouble  And Gray looking for his first international goal  And he really is one for the future for Northern Ireland Philip Gray  Now Dowie  Gray again  Plenty of pace  Linards nice control  Donaghy got the touch  Magilton over to Wilson  Donaghy  to Taggart  Lat  Latvians huddle back  allowing Northern Ireland to have a bit of space in mid-field  several sylls  Taggart  giving it away  Now Taggart has to chase all the way back as Ivanovs gets ground  Ivanovs again   2 sylls  Babicevs  Good control to keep the ball  Good ball at the moment for Latvians but all  coming to nothing in the end  It 's all a bit quiet there this evening in that far stand but uh all very quiet as yet for them  Passed over by Jimmy Quinn  who didn't agree with the decision  And now just back in defence  This is number six  Popkovs  Still in the middle  Takes a deflection  And the flag is up though on the far side  Sarando went in there  It wouldn't 've counted  But a warning signal there for Northern Ireland  Sarando plenty of space but off side  Just under a quarter of an hour left of this very dull first half  Still scoreless  Can he change the whole script  Worthington  This is good  Ball went too long  That 's Popkovs taking it away  Dowie scratching his head  Think he 's saying how do we break these fellows down  Northern Ireland finding it difficult  Over by Donaghy  Gray was up there  Dowie gives chase  That 's Ivanovs  Goal kick to Latvia  Gnedojs who plays with uh Helsingborg in the first division in Sweden  This is uh Jelisejevs the sweeper  He plays with KuPS in Finland  Thirty-four year old  The oldest member of the team  several sylls  Latvia have it again with Babicevs  several sylls  Quinn  working hard in mid-field Jimmy Quinn  several sylls  of course  Striker with second division Reading  He 's got six goals in six games this season to his name  There 's one of the first chance of the evening for Northern Ireland  as they try to find a way through  Wilson
