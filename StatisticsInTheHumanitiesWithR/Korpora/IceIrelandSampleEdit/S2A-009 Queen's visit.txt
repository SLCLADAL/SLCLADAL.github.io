<S2A-009 Queen's visit>  Good morning from Belfast  on a cold but bright morning  and you join us live from the new Cross Harbour Bridge  Since January the twenty-second  it 's been open to traffic and up until nine o'clock this morning it was helping thousands of commuters get into work on time  But now people have replaced cars and lorries  There 's an air of quiet expectancy because in a few minutes ' time the official ceremony and the naming of the two Lagan bridges  one road  one rail  will be carried out by Her Majesty the Queen  These two constructions  the largest and most significant transport project ever undertaken in Northern Ireland  have dramatically altered the city skyline and helped to ease Belfast 's congested road network  The Queen is due to touch down around now at Belfast City Airport  She 's then due to travel by car along the Sydenham Bypass towards the east side of the bridge  And while we are waiting for Her Majesty to arrive  let me introduce you to Chris Ryder  who joins me in our commentary box  Well good morning  This uh there 's a very relaxed atmosphere here this morning  uhm there 's a very distinct lack of the oppressive security that has surrounded royal visits in the past  Uhm apart from uh uh police  around the area there are no road blocks through the city and uh there are uh some armed police on rooftops and buildings around  Uhm and there 's no military involved I mean no sight of soldiers anywhere except for half a dozen boats in the river and uh again the uh personnel in those who include many women uh wearing uh life jackets and not flak jackets and there 's no sign of them carrying rifles  Uhm there was uh a fairly intensive security operation overnight  uh when the area was cleared by bomb disposal teams and search dogs and then a a very low-key police presence was put in was put in position to uh uhm guard just the direct vicinity of the bridge where the ceremony is taking place  And uhm the uh  compared to the nineteen seventy-seven Silver Jubilee  there 's a much  a very relaxed time indeed  Indeed these are these are policemen who are in the boats uh in in the water uh around us here  and not soldiers  It 's very obviously an operation that is being looked after by the police   Yeah the uh  there there are a number of women officers on board too  And these are darting boats that are used for waterway patrol by the security forces throughout Northern Ireland  And uh  I also think it is a sign of the times Chris isn't it that that as we look out from our commentary position here uh around the city  life is going on very much as normal  I mean  traffic 's still moving freely over the  the nearby bridges where  Yeah   Yes as one looks out over the Queen Elizabeth Bridge and the uh  the Albert Bridge and all all around the  the main fringes of the city centre here there 's no traffic congestion despite the fact that the Sandy Row Bridge is closed for the  several hours that the ceremony will take  And uh the the uh life goes on very much as normal  Uh we 've got uhm then people who have been invited here onto the bridge to watch the ceremony to see to see Her Majesty the Queen arrive  and uhm it 's notable that they include representatives of the Nationalist minority community  It 's a measure of how things have changed in Northern Ireland really in the last twenty-five years that we can see a a genuine cross-community uh uh attendance here at a function like this today  Four schools have been uh specially invited  Uh they are pupils from Stranmillis Primary in South Belfast  the Edmund Rice primary school  Seaview on the Shore Road and uh Saint Michael 's on the Ravenhill Road  There they are  some of the children from Stranmillis uh waving at our camera as we speak about them  The world 's press is here as well  there 's great interest in this because uh this is the first time in so many years that the Queen has come to Northern Ireland uh at a time of peace and quiet  Uh it 's her eighth visit to the Province  The last time that she was here was in June nineteen ninety-three as guest of honour at the Secretary of State 's garden party at Hillsborough Castle  There are many uh adults here as well  They are people who have come from nearby offices  uh people who are curious and uh who want to see this  this momentous occasion which is unfolding before us  uh this morning as we speak  Yes it 's it 's interesting too that there 's been a lack of controversy about uh  this function  The uh when the Queen arrived in nineteen sixty-six to name the Queen Elizabeth Bridge which is just a hundred yards away uh it was the culmination of of much political wrangling here in the city  The Unionist-controlled Council at that time  wanted to call the bridge after Lord Carson and uhm there was much procedural manoeuvring  in City Hall  At one stage the governor 's secretary uh actually rang uh the town clerk and said that uh it was inappropriate for Her Majesty to be drawn into this political controversy  And when the uh City Council came to decide on the name it was actually a Catholic Republican Labour councillor who seconded the motion that it should be called the Queen Elizabeth Bridge and not the Lord Carson Bridge  And thus  thus uh Her Majesty came in nineteen sixty-six to name the bridge in her honour  And that 's the bridge there just in front of us  uh which is now in fact congested with traffic uh so clearly something is happening not too far away from us  That 's the Queen Elizabeth Bridge there that she opened in nineteen sixty-six  Yes that 's just that 's just uh literally adjacent to us and in between of course we 've now got the new Lagan Weir  which is a central part of clean  the the the policy to clean up the river and and develop the the upper reaches uhm  along the city with  Many people have regarded it as a neglected asset for a long time  It 's it 's also interesting that  that this is now uh this area on on the River Lagan is taking on a new significance as a transport interchange because for many many years uhm all along the quayside here was uh where the overnight  ferries went off to England and Scotland  And this was in the days before air travel  We would have had four boats going out of Belfast every night to uh Scotland and uh Heysham in Liverpool and uhm Ardrossan and uhm the Isle of Man and of course these were a vital lifeline for Northern Ireland in those days because of the uh kind of absence of air travel  but in the nineteen fifties all that declined  As we 've said already the Queen is no stranger to Northern Ireland  Uh she was here within being a few weeks of being crowned and included Northern Ireland on her itinerary during the Silver Jubilee tour in nineteen seventy-seven  So let 's now take a brief look back at some of Her Majesty 's previous visits later in broadcast   We can assume that this is the  the cavalcade  Well it 's certainly the preliminary part of it  Uhm the the uh  the royals will probably be travelling in limousines  the  these appear are  obviously in VIP cars  Perhaps it 's the the Chief Constable the GOC the Secretary of State  In fact there 's the Secretary of State now  Yes he would have been welcoming uh Her Majesty on the tarmac at uh Sydenham  Uh they would obviously be arriving now to get into position  In fact the Queen is just getting out of the car as we speak and uh she is being greeted by the Lord Lieutenant of Belfast  Colonel Helliot Wilson  uh now being introduced to the Lord Mayor of Belfast  Alderman Hugh Smith  And the Queen is here with the Duke of Edinburgh this morning  She 's now meeting Mrs Smith  Mrs Helen Smith  the Lord Mayor 's wife  and is now being introduced to Brian Hanon  chief executive of Belfast uh City Council followed by Joe Hendron the MP for west Belfast  uh beside him is Peter Robinson the MP for east Belfast  Uh two different sides of this bridge uh span two different constituencies  east and uh west of the city  And the traditional posy of flowers as well being presented to the Queen by five year old Charlotte Choppinger  daughter of uh senior executive of the airport known as the Shorts Bombardier group  The Queen is now going to walk uh about eighty yards or so up to the area up to where the plaque will be unveiled and in doing so she is going to be walking past the school children who 've been waiting here uh and also to the people from the nearby offices  She looks well this morning Chris  Yes she looks very relaxed and uh clearly uh the relaxed atmosphere I think has has uh has contributed to the the the gentle informality that we 're now going to see on this visit  Uhm it 's uh not been the practice in the past for the Queen to be uh exposed to a walkabout like this which would be a standard part of royal visits everywhere else  And I think it 's  it 's a reflection of the dramatic changes that there have been in the situation in Northern Ireland in the last six months  She was also insistent that she 'd come here in nineteen seventy-seven during her jubilee tour as well  It  says something of of  of the bravery of the lady  because  she was determined to come  Yeah   Yes when   The Queen has has uh felt a a tremendous uh  affection for the people of Northern Ireland and she has spoken many times of her admiration for the way that they have coped with the difficulties of the conflict uh  in the last twenty-five years  She 's referred to it in many of her Christmas broadcasts and I think there was a feeling that was reinforced by the Secretary of State Roy Mason at the time that it would be a mistake to leave Northern Ireland out of the Silver Jubilee tour round the countryside  And despite all the immense security problems she came and the visit went off without with any major incident whatever   There 's virtually no barrier here at all between Queen and people  just the normal uh crowd  2 sylls  barriers that one would see everywhere and uh there is not the oppressive security that one would have expected in Northern Ireland even when we had prime ministers here in the past doing this sort of thing in the city centre  The security has been much more oppressive  I think that since we are running very much to time we were told that uh the Queen would be here at around ten past eleven or so  uhm that she can take her time as she walks along here and spend time talking to these children  accepting the gifts of flowers as well  Yes we can see the lady-in-waiting there has already relieved her of some of the bundles   Uh we have reporters uh down with the people this morning who have been uh meeting and chatting with the Queen as she has passed by and no doubt we will be able to hear from them later on uh exactly what was said to to the people in in Belfast on the bridge this morning  Yes the Lord Lieutenant appears to be pointing out some of the landmarks  o  on the uh Belfast Lough to Her Majesty  She 'll of course be well familiar with this part of the city  not only having opened the Queen Elizabeth Bridge but  uh back in nineteen fifty-four when she was only had been Queen for two years  she visited the Harland and Wolff shipyard and she launched the Southern Cross which was one of the last big passenger liners ever to be built here in Belfast
