Seriously  I was inside the lectures and I never knew  You were going like  Yeah uhm and your final one is uh  is is a Chaucer  Chaucer tale  several sylls   Another one  Might we get that Chaucer

actually I have the notes here so  Where is the exam on Thursday  1 syll  three  Oh great  Normal like  But it 's an open book anyway  isn't it  so you can actually take the text in with you  You bring the text in with you  Yeah  O'Rahilly gave us handouts like for the rest of the Seafarer  Can we bring them in  Yeah  You can bring in handbook  or handouts and the books  Not your notes though  Not the notes  Not your notes no  laughs   Those who are  those who are supervising it okay  will be the two of us  laughter  Okay my advice to you is  get there early  get a decent seat in by the wall  Fight fight for it if you have to uhm cos I mean that means you won't have anybody on your  on your left  on your right  But there will always  there will have to be a seat between every person   several sylls    Right   Oh yeah   How will they fit us   Will there be room   We 'll try and fit you  So that 's why you need to get there early and get get a decent seat  uh  open book  you can bring in these texts and you can bring in that workbook and you can bring the handouts I gave you  several sylls   You know when he asks about  Beowulf  can you like  use the other elegies and stuff to  It depends on the question  It depends on the question  I mean if it 's first of all women in Beowulf it probably isn't brilliant  Well no actually  good point uhm  If the question comes up which I don't think it will  if women come up  you could bring it in  you could bring in  several sylls  but just to support it  okay  Just say like  This is in Beowulf but the same thing is in  Or or or uhm  also in  1 syll  's Lament we find we find this which backs up or uhm supports this argument  Now the women in Beowulf  it 'd be a gift if you got that  you 'd be lucky if you got that  brilliant  laughter  And uh  Okay what I think  what I think you will get is in Middle English  several sylls  is Orpheo and Mallory  Now the hints she gave out for Orpheo uhm  Now if you if you want to go through these tell me  I I haven't got a watch so somebody tell me when it 's five to three  Uhm possible questions for Orpheo  The differences between Orpheo as king and Orpheo as wild man  What are the differences between them  between Orpheo in in those two roles  Uh okay  The best reply to that  the best reply to that kind of question would be actually to question the question  if you understand that  to turn the question around and say  well actually is there any difference between  you know  is there any difference between Orpheo as a king and Orpheo as wild man  And my feeling on there on that is that really there isn't  because you can back that up by saying uh he still has power in the natural world  he has his harp with him uh which is a symbol of his power and he uses that to  to soothe savage beasts  Also he uses that in his own kingdom as well  uhm that 's what he 's renowned for  he 's renowned for playing  for his playing of the harp  So you can sort of question the question  several sylls  If you get a really narky question you don't want to say  oooh now what shall we do  So you turn the question around and you answer it in a in a very  in a different way  Cos I mean  I know I mean I 've sixty  I 've sixty-seven tutorial people okay  uhm say half  if half of you do Middle English  you know I know that 'll probably not be the case but uhm  and if if most of you do this or a similar question to this and you give me the same type of stuff  the marks will not be as high  Like uhm that 's one thing in the exam in  in in June  You will get a choice of of Old English and Middle English okay and language and society and do two out of three  Uhm now  the highest marks go go for questions that are least answered  you know  So if you see a really weird one  you know  uhm and you think you can handle it  go for it  Get higher marks  Because they the  because those who are correcting it will have nothing to gauge it against  You know what I mean  If if you have something to gauge it against you go  wasn't as good as that one  yeah  You see you 're sort of you 're sort of wondering how good it really is  You know  So that 's that 's that 's why uh the best marks actually go for languages and society  because very few people actually do Dr Farelli 's course and the questions  because they are a bit  they need a lot of  a lot of work  they need some sort of  you go in  you feel good and you can do the question  That 's the only way you 're going to be dealing with Dr Farelli 's questions  Unless you 're actually preparing for the second part of her of her course  That 'll be in February so I 'll talk more about that then  but uhm if there is an internal choice on Thursday  go for the one that you think people won't answer  then you 'll get a higher mark  Uhm uh  Unless you totally flop it  laughs   Well no  you won't   you won't flop it if you have the book in front of you  Oh right  Uhm  oh yeah  I 'm rambling here a bit  Quotations  in the class essay  If you if you want to use quotation marks you have to get it directly out of the book  You have to get the words directly out of the book  The spelling can't be out  But if you don't want to use quotation marks you can paraphrase it to your heart 's delight  And you can say  well uh Orpheo said that  you know  no quotation marks  and that 's it  you 're fine  You sort of  you state what you think he said rather than what he actually did say  you know  but you don't put it in quotation marks  And and and especially in Middle English  you don't have to get close to the spelling at all  You can paraphrase in modern English  And it 's the same it 's the same in the exam  Now uhm a second question for Orpheo  different locations of court and the fairy kingdom and the three  3 sylls  Uhm how are the locations in Orpheo described  The location of the court  the fairy kingdom  and the hovel  how are they described  what differences are there  what similarities  and uhm what does that say about the uhm  about each location  There 's the court  the hovel  and what else  the fairy kingdom  uh the fairy castle  uhm now a third one  The role of music in Orpheo  Very classic one  very classic  Uhm okay  another possible one  depictions of the hero and the heroine  how is Orpheo  how is Orpheo uh portrayed and how is uhm Eurydice portrayed  Uhm okay I haven't  Can they be described as a hero and a heroine  What do you what do you think of their description  Do you think the description of Eurydice just according to her basically  her her outer looks  do you think that 's appropriate to the genre  Do you think it 's appropriate to a romance  And if you don't  you know  tell us why  It would be very interesting to hear it  Uhm  you know uh  How is suspense built up in the poem and sustained  Uh how does the poet how does the poet uh sustain the suspense  like okay there are two  two different  several sylls  uhm when Eurydice had has had her dream  or when the fairy  several sylls  came to visit her  visited her in in her dream  when she wakes up she starts tearing her face  We don't know why  We 're going  what 's happened  We don't know until she tells us  So there 's suspense  We 're waiting along with Orpheo  along with everybody else to find out what exactly happened  Okay so uhm that 's one example of suspense being uh sustained and sort of uh being there  Second one uhm  or a second one  not the second  a another one  uhm would be where uhm Orpheo 's playing his harp for the fairy king and uhm after he 's finished the king says to him  oh that was  man that was brilliant  I 'll give you anything in the  anything in my kingdom  several sylls  and Orpheo says  I want her  And the fairy king says  this can't happen  You 're you 're a minstrel  Come on you 're a scumbag  you know  You 're scum  She 's a queen  What 's what 's the  you can't cross this social class thing  Okay you can't cross the  social  social scale  But but uh we 're sort of wondering like will he will he give in  Will he actually give uh Orpheo back his wife or not  Okay so that 's another bit of suspense there  Okay there are a few more areas as well so try and find them before Thursday  Okay uhm the form of the poem itself  uhm it 's a Breton lai  it 's a romance  What does this  what does this say to you  Uhm what do you expect in in this  What should you expect  And maybe uhm uh  does it actually come  does the poem actually live up to uh the genre  to the form of the poem  to what uhm a romance is  Now if you get that question I will be deeply disappointed  It 's one of those questions  Order   Will the question be subdivided  will it be  No  No  Don't think so  I hope not for your sake  Uhm  several sylls   What if you haven't a clue of it like  Yeah you could maybe know one part of it like  Well yeah  well I mean you do that and then half-way  but I mean don't spend uh  okay if there 's two parts to the question okay and you only do one  you only get  you only get marked out of fifty
