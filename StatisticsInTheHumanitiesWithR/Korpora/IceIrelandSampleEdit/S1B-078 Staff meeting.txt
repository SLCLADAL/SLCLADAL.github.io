<S1B-078 Staff meeting>  So  We 'll start  There was no action sheet for the last day so I just went down through the minutes to see was there anything uhm that needed to be followed up  just the dysphagia policy was to be altered  Did anyone know about that   several sylls  That was just to be put in about contacting pharmacy  Pharmacy yeah  That was all  That 's all  Uhm equipment  Amplifiers  Maria was to talk to Jim O'Connor  Yes uhm I still have to do that so yeah  laughs   And the other thing was the swallow screening test to see how that was going with the training  Uh yeah that 's going well  We 've had two people every day apart from last Monday uhm  and we 're not doing any more now until the sixth  I 've put out a bit of a rota as well uhm  you know to try and get people done  There 's eight more  eight more nurses to be done in Henry Flood but apart from that  once they 're done the whole of Henry Flood will be done  But what I 'm hoping to do is go and arrange to meet the wards ' managers on each ward uh with Rachel Miller to try and explain to them what we 're trying to do and to see if we can get them on board  So it looks like we 're going to have to do something like that in order to get the message across  Uhm I 've made a rota for doing the swallow screening that I emailed round everybody  On the sixth  Oh yeah  laughs  That 'll be a nice to come back present  we we were thinking then about doing some joint training as well  uhm just to make sure it 's standardised because the policy 's changed a bit  So two therapists training then  So the supervisory bit then  you know you were sending supervisors to each ward  Yeah  Is that so so  could we get a call then to go up and supervise somebody doing their their three swallows  Well no I wouldn't I wouldn't agree to do that so much  What what I 've been doing down in Henry Flood has been  I 've asked Elaine and Jim to do the supervised training but if I have a spare half an hour or something or if I 'm waiting to see somebody and I 've to wait for them to get sitting up in bed or something like that and there 's a nurse I 'll say do you want to go and do a supervised training now  You know kind of  fit around my own schedule   Okay yes  Yeah okay  Uhm because strictly speaking the nurses can can   the like the ones that have been using it all the time  can  supervise the new ones  uhm  and I I wouldn't commit to having to go up there the whole time to do the three trainings with every nurse but if you 're hanging around  you know  So I 've done quite a few supervised training before just because I 've been waiting for somebody else or I 've had a half an hour  to spare before I go  and do something else  Uhm so it 's to do that kind of thing and it 's also to kind of keep an eye that people who haven't done training aren't doing the swallow screening  Yeah   Right okay   Yeah yeah okay   I know what you mean  Mm  Uhm  Mm  And just if uhm Rosie Daly has any problems just to like to relay them  that kind of thing  just to keep an eye on things really  Grand  So nothing else on that  Uhm anybody need to add anything else to the agenda simultaneous indistinct   no  I thought I had one  several sylls  simultaneous and unclear   Nothing else  Nothing else to add on then  Uhm okay we 'll push on then  The AHP update I just put that on  in case there was anything  There really wasn't  there wasn't any management team meeting  and when there isn't a management team meeting  there isn't a whole pile it was mostly about the OT service which is down further on  Well it 's actually next on the document anyway  Okay  Uhm it was really Sylvia was just uhm  brought up the fact that there 's now no OT service to general medical and general surgery  and she said that some of  I don't know did you go to speak to her but she said that some of the Physios and some of the OTs  or some of the social workers had been coming to her personally and saying  oh look we 've a patient please you have to do this and she said she 's getting a lot of hassle and she just asked if people could stop doing that please because there 's nothing she can do about it  She said literally they had one basic grade with a waiting list of sixty  and they had to cut it  you know  because  as she said  they have a duty of care to the staff as well  The patients are not going to be seen  there 's going to be no exceptions made because  as she said herself if  if that happens then nothing will change  Uhm the CEO made the decision not to  not to fill any more of the posts uhm and that 's where the problem is  There 's no more funding for those posts and she 's not allowed fill them with agency staff  so she had to make a stand  Uhm so basically it 's going to hold up discharge uhm or else patients will be discharged unsafely  uhm and they 're probably going to come back in through Casualty but that 's probably the only way things 'll change  I think she had people lined up for the four posts but because it was so delayed they 've all since got other jobs  That 's terrible  So it is  I mean she said herself like it 's going to affect all the other services as well  but she 's just asked if you can kind of not be  because I think some of the OTs have got hassle  I don't know from any of the other allied health professions but certainly from doctors and from nurses they 're getting hassle and getting abuse down the phone so she asked that people could maybe just  you know accept the situation and   Stop abusing  Yeah  Well that 's what uh the OT told me to do  She said go and speak to Sylvia about this  Right  I did  Yeah  So  several sylls   I think they 're just totally fed up because  you know the same thing 's happening with dieticians  they 're not allowed fill their posts  Yeah  Uhm particularly with OT though I suppose because they don't have a paediatric one as well it just seems like they 're being completely hard done by  being victimised  How many are they down now  no five  Five right   several sylls   no   No other queries on that now  It 's crazy how that can happen though isn't it  Cos like physio have a full complement of all those  But it it seems to be a bit hit and miss like we were always allowed advertise our posts and there was no problem with  you know if there was a locum available  just put the locum in place  But OTs there was a total  and I think the CEO said that they would stagger the recruitment  but they haven't  Like they 've completely blocked the five posts  They 're not allowed fill them  They 're not allowed get agency staff  It 's crazy  And that was an informed decision  was it  That was the CEO decided yeah  They said that there was no funding  I think it was just unfortunate for them that five kind of five posts came up at the same time  Mm  And they weren't allowed replace any of them  You know it wasn't even like  well you can replace two out of the five it was just no you can't replace any of them  That 's terrible  Until January but if you 've got people lined up they 're not going to wait til January if they 've got something else available  It must be quite stressful for them at the same time  Terrible  That 's what she said  She said there 's a few more thinking of leaving now  Yeah  2 sylls  's leaving  There 's going to be no-one  Because I think up until now it was always community care for OTs was like  oh major stress but now it 's  Mm  It 's not so bad  And I don't think it 's as bad in any other hospital because there isn't the same block on recruitment   Poor Sylvia was nearly crying at the meeting yesterday   Must be awful  several sylls  for Christmas  several sylls   I 'd say there probably just will be enough  Yeah  Alright then simultaneous and unclear   Uhm projects  The dementia support group  Yeah I just asked to put that on  it 's more really Rebecca who 's involved with this than myself  but uhm  The dementia support group is going to be run again I think in   no February  is that the planning time  eight weeks  And just if anyone has any patients that they think would be suitable  for their carers to attend  let us know  Cos we 're looking for names  That 's all really  And we 're hoping to send the letters out in the first week of January so if we could get the names ASAP   Names to Maria or Lisa  Yeah  Okay  Alright then  several sylls   just that myself and Cheryl want to get back going  on that  laughter  Uhm we have  this is the template at the moment so far the draft that Laura 's up done for what we have out but as we said in the last meeting we still don't know what way to give it to them  whether we should try and put it onto something or if we just give it to them plain in poster format  Uhm we were hoping to get feedback and Sybil was saying she has a few GP friends and maybe to get some feedback from them on what they like getting  getting through the door and what they would throw out  if we 're going to be especially laminating everything or putting everything onto it we want it to be worthwhile  moneywise  so uhm we don't want to rush into it  Uhm as I said in the last meeting we have the catchment area of GPs but if we could uhm ask around certainly and get some feedback from people to find out what would be a useful way of giving it to them  I still think it probably needs to go along with  not a training session but some kind of  you actually going to speak to them face-to-face or some little bit more contact cos if that literally just on its own with a letter arrives on the door they 're not going to read it  they 're just going to chuck it in the bin  I would say  Cos they get so much stuff in  Even a personal delivery on it or something  Well there are over three hundred GPs in the catchment area  so I doubt we could do that  Uhm and I suppose we would have to get support if we 're going to be inviting the GPs in  Uhm I don't know how many would show up  If they 're not going to read the poster are they going to drive over to the hospital  What about the GP study days  There was one about three weeks ago  They have one two or three times a year  They are arranged  2 sylls  was at a meeting yesterday somewhere  where was it  several sylls  There was one about three or four weeks ago  Oh  Uhm they 're arranged externally but they 're always held here  Mm  I don't know who arranges them  I should look into that  Do you remember about three weeks ago there were signs up along the corridor  GP study day down at the education centre   Yeah maybe  But I just don't know who organises it
