<S1A-005 Masons>  Right shall we risk another beer or shall we try and  ride the bikes down there or do something like that   Well  what about the  provisions  What time   4 sylls    Is is your  man coming here  Yeah   He said  he would meet us here  Just the boat 's arriving you know a few minutes ' walk away  We should maybe sort of ride down  Slip him ten Euro for the bedding he said  Ah we 'll do more than that  We 'll give him  twenty or something and buy a box of chocolates or something nice wee card or something  Or we could get him uh   bottle from the   Easter egg sort of  thing  He might not drink for all I know  Well he does  Does he drink  I can't  remember   He 's a  Mason don't know that means  Masons drink  I don't know  Freemasons  laughter   My Da joined the Masons out of respect for my Granda  cos my Granda was a mad Mason  Like whenever when he died he  Dad got all sad and stuff  He was always trying his mates were always trying to get him to join for the wrong reasons  cos  he was doing well in the business and all  And he was uh they just want my money and all this shite  Fuck them  I 'm never joining them at all  I 'm I 'm getting blackballed and all  But he 's not a very good Mason  He 's not very secretive  le  he leaves  Uh-huh   Did he tell you all of his secrets  No he hasn't but uhm he leaves his books lying about and stuff and you can flick through them bits  It 's shite  All the secrets is if you 're a Mason and you go to court and the judge is a Mason you 'll get a lighter sentence or you 'll get off with it  That sort of way  That 's how it works  Very strange  If you 're if  you 're   And they  help each other out in business  and all  Things like that   If you 're if you 're if you 're a car builder  like if you 're a car builder like a car mechanic guy or like his Dad you 've a broken car he 'll give you a really good deal and you 'll  if you 're  a painter he 'll get a really good deal in paint   But it never would 've worked  It never would 've worked  because the only other Mason who was a garage guy in Crossgar Dad absolutely hated him and he hated Dad like  The two of  them  detest each other and  they were both Masons  My Da was going to think if  5 sylls  I 've to fucking deal with that guy because he 's a Mason  Fuck that  Really   Now you don't want  any of that   But whenever  Granda died he changed and he  he joined just to sort of respect him or whatever  I mean he 's not a   several sylls    Yeah   He 's not a team player  but  laughter   But  he got  he got these newsletters sent back and uhm there was one lying on the table I looked at flicking flicking through  and there 's Nigel like standing on a barge  laughter   Was he  Was amazing  Of the Leitrim  Brigade or whatever it is  Well guess who 's the head of it if it is  Is it only men  I think Kenny owns those houses over there  He owns everything I think here  Uh I think  it is only men   Uh yeah  it 's a man 's club workingman 's club  But the the I 've always wanted to ask him about the rituals with the  the  sort of joining you know  2 syllables  There 's like rumours and all you have to have sex with a goat  Yeah   It 's all  that thing   You know that  thing like if you 've to ride a goat round the room you know and ride around on its back and all  I 'm like Dad you fucking joined this  laughter   It 's all that silly stuff  You have to be put forward by so many people and then you 've to lift the blackball thing and  all that  You 've three balls and you pick pick  the right one or else you 're not in and all sort of nonsense  It 's just like some  Mhm  And if if anybody doesn't want you they   If you don't pick the right one you 're not in  Something like that yeah  Then you 've to wait a year to try again  It 's all just bollocks  It 's demented  It 's a strange choice for him  to you know to  decide  to do that   I don't agree with it   I don't understand    then like   Uh to respect  your Granda like you know   I know   Maybe something  he thought he had to make up to him or something like that  Something like that  It 's   Tommy  Brick is one of Jimmy 's best friends  Jimmy 's a Catholic in Downpatrick and he 's always attached to the Golf Club or the Cricket Club  Tommy Brick 's sister was sitting or sister or cousin was sitting at the table with us on Thursday night  Was she  Was it Alison  No  Alison 's the sister  Sure I went to school with her   Mhm  Well it must 've been a cousin  Well they 're all Protestants  And the whole the whole Cricket Club is a real Protestant thing like  And Jimmy 's a Catholic and this  They 've never treated right his whole family were never treated right down at the Cricket Club but they were really good cricketers  They were cricket through and through  But  because it 's a real Protestant thing they were never treated with the right respect and all this sort of stuff  uh this 's nothing to  Tommy Brick his Granda died or something  On his deathbed he said to Tommy Tommy never go into never go into Chapel  Never set foot in a Chapel like  That 's my dying wish for you or something like  laughter  And like and Tommy was telling me this  Mm    think you 'd 've better things  to think about when you 're on your deathbed  What the stupid like  I know   Well this is what he said  I said oh so what 'd he do about your wedding and all  He said well he he was in like  He just came in and he stood at the back like which  Did he marry a Catholic  Tommy was marrying Una  He was there cos he 's a best friend like at his  wedding   Mm  oh right right right  imagine lying on your deathbed wanting somebody to do that like  That 's terrible  laughter   It 's typical but it 's terrible  Terribly typical  Remember Louise telling me a story about her Granny when she was in hospital  and uhm   Louise is a Protestant  I only knew that after about four  years after knowing her   Aye  but her Granny 's really really staunch like  And uh she wouldn't she found out what religion the nurses were and all and wouldn't let the Catholic ones come near her  laughter  and all this sort of stuff  Had to move her bed and all because she didn't want to be beside her uh somebody a sick Catholic  The priest came in at one stage or something and like  laughter  you know just  visiting  and she was like oh fucking  Mm   Get thee behind me Satan  She nearly had a  laughter  heart attack like you know   Gear 's got good stories about nurse things  His Granny 's a nurse  Was the  the head nurse in Downpatrick and now she 's off her rocker  laughter  Senile  Crazy woman  Tell the banana one  The banana one 's  fantastic   The banana  one 's fantastic  It 's  like something out of a film  Basically whenever she went nuts they put her in uhm the there 's a wee old peoples ' home  Glasswater Crossword Glass Glasswater Crossroads  You know that  It 's like a wee low white building  Tell it   Crossroads after it 's after Crossgar  It 's  a sort of long house on the right   Oh yeah   It 's not like a  hospital  It 's like a you know  an old folks ' home but it 's very   5 sylls    Well  they brought her in and she was obviously too nuts for the place  Like the it 's full of people that 're just maybe old and maybe can't look after themselves  and that  She 's  seeing things and all you know  And uhm this oul man  her husband had died a couple of years and uhm this oul man came back from hospital  uh uh uh after an operation like  and he was came back to convalesce  And he had a walking stick and her my Granda had a walking stick  And she must 've put two and two together and thought it was him coming in the door late at night  laughter  cos he used to come in late after being in the pub  And uh your man comes in and they go welcome welcome uh Tommy back everybody  And everybody is going oh hello  Welcome back  And she 's marching down the corridor going you 've been out fucking and whoring haven't you you bastard  And the guy goes who 's this  Fuck off  laughter  But uh  they don't have any there 's there 's no uh locks on the doors you know so uhm they 've got panic buttons beside the  beds  So at about three or four in the morning one night and the panic button went off and the nurses run in  They told my parents about this  Total darkness like  They turned the light on  There was some poor wee man lying in bed  My Granny 's sitting on him straddling him  laughter  with her knickers on her head the way that the nurses wear them  laughter  And she 's force-feeding him bananas  Seriously ten banana skins round the bed  And your man was lying there going argh  laughter  hitting the button  And she 's going eat them  And they were right get her out to fuck  She went out  Now now she 's in where the Dunmore Hotel used to be  You know that  uhm Killyleagh Lodge   Converted bungalow   Yeah   Mhm   Uh-huh   Oh that 's just  a normal home too  Is it   I think  it 's a  wee bit it 's a wee bit more hard  it 's a wee bit more hardcore like  But uhm  she thinks I 'm her son  She thinks Da 's her husband sometimes  I haven't seen her she 's it 's uh terrible to say but she 's as good as dead to me   haven't visited her in years  But she 's in the lock up section of it   laughter   Yeah   It 's too  disturbing   Neither has  Dad  Like his own Mum  But uh  It 's too disturbing because  of what she comes out with   It 's it is but it 's  it 's kind of pointless as well because she 's so  crazy   She wouldn't  know  anyway   She doesn't know  if you 're  there or not  so it 's like  Yeah   Yeah  It I know it 's quite harsh to say but  Yeah  You know if someone 's completely  unaware that you 're there  Yeah  From now til the end of her life it 's they 're as good as dead anyway  laughter  But Dad I don't think Dad ever got on  I mean my other  my Mum 's Mum  I love her to death  Like everybody does  Such a lovely wee woman  laughter  Where did the bananas come from like  wha  what was going through her mind like   Who  several sylls    It 's a it 's a home  Sure people 're bringing in fruit for people and stuff   It 's like she was she was back into  she was back into  nurse  nurse mode  You know she was like  feeding time or something  That 's why she 'd
