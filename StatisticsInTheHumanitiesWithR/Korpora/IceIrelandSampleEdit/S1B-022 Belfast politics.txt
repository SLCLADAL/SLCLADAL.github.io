<S1B-022 Belfast politics>  The talks at Stormont  it looked as though the Ulster Unionists were going to go there with the UDP and the PUP and then this bomb  in Market Hill today  Now as I understand it  nobody 's claimed responsibility for this so far but David Trimble of the Ulster Unionists says  kick Sinn Fe/in out of the talks  Ulster Unionists here  Dermot Nesbit why if there isn't a claim  why if there isn't a claim would you say  kick Sinn Fe/in out of the talks  What 's the point  Well the point is very simple  We wish to embark upon a process of discussion among constitutional parties to resolve the difficulty in Northern Ireland  But before you embark upon a consultative process and discussion we must agree the rules of discussion  And we have simply said for one Tony Blair said on Saturday morning that if the IRA or any of the front organisations associated with the IRA was to recommence violence then Sinn Fe/in would be out  The Taoiseach also said this week that he was expecting the whole as he I think he said the Republican Family to abide by the preace  process  How   He used the  phrase Republican Movement  Yes  And that was subsequently queried and there 's a lot of debate now as to whether Sinn Fe/in and the IRA are part of the Republican Movement  Yes  The terminology now is Republican Family   Republican Movement or  Republican Family  But the or   Yeah to get back to the main point  A bomb went off today  Nobody 's claimed it and you say kick Sinn Fe/in out  In  the sentence why  The   The precise process is that we have lodged that Sinn Fe/in should be removed  The Chairman of the talks process will then ask the various parties for their opinion  The Government will then have to make up their mind  And I repeat what Tony Blair has said that if the IRA or any of the front organisation has carried out any act of violence and I think no-one here doubts  that it is not someone from the Republic Movement  It was a very large bomb  The Chief Constable said it was done with great expertise and very  detailed planning  so one  does not doubt that  Mm okay   Right we 'll come back to it  Gentleman beside you just two along  Yes sir  I come from outside Lisburn  The question I would like to ask if given the opportunity  is  can our politicians handle the peace  or are we going to have to suffer their negativity  their play on semantics and their inability  to negotiate on a group to group basis  Yeah but what about the point that the Unionists make  and it 's also been made perhaps with greater force by the UK Unionist party the DUP you cannot go in and you cannot negotiate with people who are either terrorists or friends of terrorists  But sure  the    Do you  not believe that  Sure the Unionists have been doing this  How have they been doing it  Explain   Well they 've been  doing it with the the the two small  uh fringe Loyalist parties  Uh the uh leader of their party  fraternised with persons in Portadown of of uhm  dubious  I think the word you 're looking for is hypocrisy  laughter  Is that the  word you 're looking  Right one second Mo  Uh this gentleman here is that yes sir  Yes yes   Andy Frew Green Party  I think we should recognise that there 's fragmentation on the Loyalist side and on the Republican side  But the question I would like to have answered is can the unionists agree to share power with Catholics and Nationalists or  will they have the British impose a solution with in consultation with the  Irish government   You think that 's a  possibility  I think we have to look to an end-game here instead of shilly-shallying about with with these issues  We shouldn't leave a veto in this process to the last five eejits with some explosives  Alright  This lady  I don't think that I 'm from the Ulster Unionist Party as well David that shilly-shallying about is what we would see as happening today  Today was a very serious day for us  We were trying to look at this process in a in a in a positive manner  And I think for people to say that we 've been negative about this process is just wrong because we have been criticised for being positive about this process  And we have to take David is uh David Trimble is taking this slowly and I think he has every right to take it slowly given what we have suffered this past thirty years  But you see the gentleman over here wants to know how come the Unionists can do business  with the Loyalists  Well for a start-off the Loyalists have now had a three-year cease fire and I know you 're now  going to say   With with  yes  I 'm going to tell you there has been the odd very serious blip  There has indeed but  can I say that they have signed up to the Mitchell principles and there 's been no shilly-shallying about that  And can I also say that they had abject remorse for what they have done over the past years something which the IRA Sinn Fe/in movement have not been able to do  Yeah I I I don't know uhm I 'm going to come to this gentleman over here because I I 'm not sure now  I talked to David Ervine and Gary McMichael today in Talkback  I 'm not sure I know  what was affirmed on behalf of whom  because David Ervine said to me today I think he used the term there there was an assumption  that the UVF were signing up to those  I 'm not sure  I got clarification to the point that I could say to you oh yes they did  What were you going to say sir  Well David I was just going to say uhm it 's a pity that such an ambitious programme is starting by looking back  Now it 's a long way to May  There 're going to be  obstacles  There 're going to be obstacles   No I don't I don't  understa  Now  come  on sir  you  cannot say that  We had the opening of talks at Stormont  There is a big bomb in Market  Hill  today and if you think we can walk away and leave that well I 'm  sorry  you 've got the wrong guy  Sir   No   Right   No   I no I the point I 'm making is we have a commitment to a timetable which leads us to  to May  There 're going to be many people try to derail the Peace Process and the democratic process and is this will test the commitment of everybody politicians and community people alike  And we really have got to steel ourselves for being put under pressure from all directions  And you say that despite what happened today that all the parties should get in there and talk  In spite of it  In spite of  it  Okay yes sir  Yes   I 'm just I 'm very disappointed in the Unionists ' response  It 's something we 've been listening to from day one of the Peace Process  They seem  unwilling to to engage with other people  And and I I have wondered why they 're so frightened of peace because that 's the objective of the talks  to arrive at peace   What view would you what general  view would you hold  Where would your support be  I 'd be a Republican  sympathiser   You 'd be  Republican  Yeah  A Republican sympathiser  So what are you saying that that that the Unionists are just simply trying to shy away from talking to   It 's as simple as that  I think it 's more than that  I think they fear that for the fifty years that they had complete control of this State  when they abused power and that 's it 's historical fact  It 's no longer a debating point  several sylls   But well you can come back in on that later  Let me make the point  They abused the power they had for fifty years  They now seem to have this oh if if anybody else is in control what 'll happen to us  I don't want that happening  I 'd want an equality  I think that should happen before negotiations that all people should have the same rights  And that 's something this State still has to deal with  the question  of equality  Yeah it 's something   It it 's uhm I mean we 'll may get into it in a moment or two and I I I don't uh because Arlene I think you want to come back briefly to answer that  But you we could get into a sticky area about consent  and what people understand by consent  And there are about three different versions of that  Yes you uh briefly Arlene  I just wanted to say that again we 're being attacked for being negative but it it 's our party that is putting forward the adoption of the European Convention on Human Rights into this country  And I just want to make that point clear to everybody  Okay would you would you hold on  I 'll come back to you on this side because I am deserting the good people who are over on this side  And I 'm just going to talk to a couple of ladies here and I 'll be up with you in a second or two  Yes  Okay I 'm Brenda Callaghan from the Northern Ireland Women 's Coalition  And while today was obviously very disappointing and I think a lot of people have been hurt by what happened in Market Hill I think the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are keen to see some sort of political process and progress  And therefore the only way to do that is actually to get in and let 's start talking  And I think that 's the message that 's coming across from everywhere  People are urging the Unionist Family to take some risks for progress and to actually get in there  It 's not good enough to be hanging around their headquarters saying should we or shouldn't we  They have a responsibility to the people they represent to get in there and make their voice heard in the way all the other parties who have an electoral mandate whether they like it or don't have a right to have their voices heard as well  Okay let 's have a view from the reverend gentleman there from Newtownabbey  Yes sir what  The speaker two before who referred to himself as a Republican sympathiser is he prepared  to condemn the bomb in Market Hill  We 've heard no condemnation  from the Sinn Fe/in Republican movement of that bomb uh in in Market Hill taking  place   Right  what is your position on the bomb in Market Hill  If I thought it would stop it I would certainly condemn it  Does that answer  you  We 've had twenty-seven years of condemnation and it has achieved  absolutely nothing  If my condemnation could stop the  whole thing  I could do it  I 'm not speaking of Sinn Fe/in   But why don't you condemn it now  Why  why do you condemn   But Sinn Fe/in have got to show  Sinn Fe/in have got to show that they  are now in favour of peace  And  they 've got to show the same condemnation of any acts of violence from whatever quarter they come from and  I 'd I 'm  happy to see them in the talks  I 'm happy to   But but   It 's   But condemnation  didn't change anything
