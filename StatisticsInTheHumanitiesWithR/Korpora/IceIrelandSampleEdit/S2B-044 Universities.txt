<S2B-044 Universities>  Chancellor of the University  I think your choice was right in the first place  Peter Magee would have  laughter  given us a much better address  Ladies and gentlemen  Chancellor of the university  a long time ago uh Francis Bacon was wise enough to write uh  for knowledge itself is power  A university is a place which garners and stores knowledge  so in that sense it is a powerful place  This knowledge uh be it the know-how to design and build an engine  or the precise location of a particular Byzantine  manuscript in a library somewhere in this world is gathered by those who conduct research and then store it in the form of written publications in the international literature  All university academics worthy of that title are commissioned by their employer  the university  to conduct research as part of their contract and  having practised their particular profession  be that engineering or medicine or whatever  they will become more expert teachers to the several generations of students who will hear them lecture on their subject during their career in the university  Almost by definition  like the rest of the human race  not all academics are equally assiduous or industrious in their research  Some are better than others  some work harder than others  some are more inventive than others and some are just plain more intelligent than others  Not all of these characteristics reside in  any one person but it 's reasonable to assume that promotion up the academic ladder from lecturer to senior lecturer and so on must indicate that a greater proportion of some or all of these assets must be present  and therefore must be needed for and taken into account for uh that advancement  Equally  not all universities contain equality of quality of its academics and so it must be assumed that some universities have smarter professors than others uh viz uh the automatic presumption among the general public that Cambridge University is better than the University of X uh inherently contains that assumption  In recent times uh there has been a considerable upsurge in the numbers of those attending  and academically eligible to attend and study at a university  The Government at Westminster at a stroke of a pen last year uh made universities out of some forty polytechnics and consequently and instantly provided the United Kingdom with greatly improved  stistics  regarding that proportion of its eighteen year old population who will become university graduates  Needless to add  the quality of research at these new universities is not in general up to the standards of the older universities for by definition the staff at these establishments were hired originally on quite different criteria and asked to fulfil a quite different purpose  Incidentally  the original purpose of a polytechnic was to give a good education to those who were mainly aiming at a technical or technician career  and as such individuals are extremely valuable to industry uh  and the professions  not to speak of invaluable  one wonders where and how the government plans to have them educated in this new academic scenario  One can be pretty certain that these new  new universities will not have a long-term wish to have any involvement with the teaching of low-level courses as they would indubitably now see technician courses in their new-found role and environment as a university  In many ways  however this is but an aside to my discussion  The main point of my debate is to ask the question  does the Government wish to have all of these extra university students taught by expert academics in the fashion of the older established universities so the quality of a university degree obtained at either the University of X or at Cambridge University is reasonably comparable  If the answer is yes uh then the ensuing question is  will the Government  aintain  and apply the traditional levels of funding of research to these new universities so that the expert teaching may take place in the traditional fashion  The current answer to these questions is apparently no  Furthermore  it is becoming apparent that the Government is going to selectively fund research at all universities  be they old or new  and thus minimise the extra financial burden caused by the creation of the new universities  The mechanism employed by Government is to query the quality of both the teaching and the research at all universities and then only fund adequately those academic disciplines and departments of any university which is deemed to be above a certain standard  Further  it would appear that the pot of research gold as we might call it  for the totality of all universities is ultimately going to be fixed  and so even the best of the universities in terms of  and due to  its perceived research quality is inevitably going to see a reduction of its Government funding for research  The current position is that the perceived research quality of two cost centres at Queen 's University is graded at the very highest level  where it 's   called grade five  several at grade four  and a very considerable fraction of the remainder at the median grade three  some thirty percent or so are graded two or lower  The funding given by government on the quality research rating criteria is very punitive  as the ratio is set at grade level minus one  thus a department graded two gets a unitary related amount of money for research and one graded five gets four times as much in cash terms  The outcome  as predicted above  is less government funding for research to Queen 's University  There 's also  an  an extra element of funding for development of research areas which is quite unique to the two Northern Ireland universities and but which will exist for only a few years ahead  How should this or indeed any university react to these changing circumstances  Should it bolster those areas and departments which are currently rated most highly  and also those which seem likely to improve their position in any future  uh well in the future research  selectivity assessment exercises  The next one actually is officially forecast to take place in nineteen ninety-five  The consequence of that is  by definition  a withdrawal of financial support to those departments not deemed likely to succeed in these same future research selectivity exercises  The phraseology employed to describe the future of such sections of the university is that they will become quote  teaching-only  unquote  departments  If you remember my previous view that as good research by the academic leads to expertise in teaching then so too by definition does the mere regurgitation of the work of others lead to less able teaching  In short  would you as a parent wish your son or daughter  or you as a graduate wish  to go to a university and study for a degree at a department which is rated at  teaching-only  Potentially  future employers may also ask the graduate not only what grade of honours degree was obtained  but in what quality of department was it studied  The alternative strategy is for the university to attempt to strengthen research in all areas of the university so that each and every one will reach the median research selectivity rating of three  From a financial standpoint having fifty percent of the university graded four and above  and the rest as two or below  is roughly perhaps even exactly the same in financial terms  That will leave the parent or potential undergraduate with a clear decision that the standard of the university in question was evenly spread throughout and the teaching culture and the service teaching sector was at least as good as in the primary discipline  Incidentally  the mean research grade three is supposed to represent research that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in a majority of the sub-areas of activity or to international levels in some  which which nomenclature sounds pretty good as an achievement if it was not for the punitive financial factoring associated with it  sas  tistical  terms Queen 's University had thirty-one of its forty-nine areas  they 're actually called cost centres  rated at grade three or better  However  this particular method of dealing with the financial problem and altering the research profile of a university in effects means removing resources from those departments which have been highly successful with research and distributing it distributing it to those who are not so proficient  which seems scant reward for being successful  However the gardeners among you may tell me that the best way to get a rose to bloom again and again is to prune it as well as to feed it with fertiliser  The audience may well ask why this new system of funding research which is being introduced for the first time is so punitive in arithmetic terms  One would certainly hope that the government teams conducting the selectivity exercise got it absolutely right  for all areas surveyed in all universities  For any mistakes made will inevitably lead to a diminution of academic status in national international terms and a reduced potential for the attraction of further research funds from industry or government  Even a brilliant researcher operating in a cost centre among much less able or industrious colleagues  but who are collectively rated as grade two  will find that the government agencies such as the research councils will tar him with a low grade-point brush  and be much less likely to judge his research application for funding  purely on the merit or quality of that written application  In this situation the loss of self-confidence and esteem to an able academic could be very destructive psychologically and lead ultimately to a significant lowering of his performance in research  The current strategy which this university is adopting is to attempt to have more than fifty percent of its cost centres rated at grade four or better in the next research selectivity rating exercise in nineteen ninety-five  Strong and selective support funding will be applied to assist with that process  By definition that means that quite a few areas of this university will not be assisted financially in this manner and it must be expected that they will fare poorly in the next round of research assessment  Only time will tell if this is the correct strategy for the University to adopt  considering the levels of funding provided by Government  More importantly for the country  is the Government 's strategy correct  However  from the viewpoint of the graduates sitting in front of me and their parents as well  it is important to note that at this point in time you have completed this phase of your education and training in an establishment with a strong research and development record  Further it is a university which quite uniquely and very successfully applies its R and D into the technology transfer mode  In such centres to single out but two  as the Northern Ireland Technology Centre and Questor  Queen 's University serves the local community in a most significant manner  In the Northern Ireland Technology Centre some thirty-three people provide design and development services to local industry  including the design and manufacture of specialist machines for the production environment  Our engineering students uh are taught computer-aided design on the most modern workstations and software in this highly relevant atmosphere  The personnel provide the basis for the advisory service to industry which orchestrates the certification of local companies through the quality assurance British Standard BS five seven five o  And the bottom line is that their external earnings for all this activity is over two million pounds per annum  The Questor Centre is a research partnership between the university and industry  a quite unique one investigating practical solutions to environmental problems  It is based primarily on chemistry but its remit extends significantly into the biological sciences  It is to be hoped that you will  all of you will be successful in your future careers  even in these difficult times with industry in the widest sense of that word in recession  This means that graduate employment is not the bustling exercise that it has been hitherto  I wish you well in your search for the right opening into a career which will bring you satisfaction and advancement  This day is one which marks the successful end of  your of your university degree course  The parents will naturally and rightly feel a glow of pride as you ascend the steps to receive your just award  just reward  and award  Many will have made significant sacrifices to ensure your success on this day  That too is as natural as it is commendable  May I congratulate you all and thank you for your attendance and your attention
