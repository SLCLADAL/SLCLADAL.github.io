<S1B-061 Traffic accident>  How long were you in the right-hand lane before you were hit from behind  Uh I was in the  I was fully in the right-hand lane for quite a few seconds before  But what  a few seconds  A few minutes  It 's about fifty or sixty yards  to travel  Well doing your best  how long  and I appreciate you didn't know this accident was going to occur  how long do you estimate you approximately  you were in the right lane having moved in it  I pulled out of the junction and I just went straight into the right-hand lane and I must have been in the right-hand lane a few minutes  five minutes  I 'm not too sure long it  For five minutes  Or two minutes  just  Two minutes is quite a long  maybe it was  Was there heavy traffic at this time  No there wasn't  Well your estimate is you were in the right lane what for two minutes  Yes  You 've already indicated to His Lordship that it was a distance of some sixty or seventy yards  That 's right  Can you indicate to His Lordship the speed at which you may have been travelling   I was travelling quite slow because I had just  wha  what does that mean approximately  Twenty twenty-five miles per hour  Yes  Because   Now   Oh sorry  When you exited from Jungle Jim 's  were you already moving at that point or had you stopped again at the uh exit to Jungle Jim 's  I was stopped at the junction from Jungle Jim 's  So you you came to the exit  you stopped  you looked to your right  Yes  You saw a car in the distance  you thought you 'd time to get out  you moved across into the outer lane  indicated you were going right  That 's correct My Lord  And what happened then  And you accelerated up to a speed you would estimate perhaps twenty miles an hour  That 's correct   at that speed  one wouldn't have expected  This sounds like a leading question coming interruption of cross-examination and discussion of another case   Apologies  Yes okay  Now Miss  1 syll  you told His Lordship you were established in the right-hand lane  that you were indicating to turn right  uh this was the entrance to the Abbey Centre  Can you tell His Lordship precisely what point perhaps with reference to uh the photographs were you when the collision occurred   Maybe photograph three is maybe the best of the three  subject to any views to the contrary from Counsel  Photograph three  I had pulled into the right-hand lane again  and  the exit here  I had indicated to turn right  and  I was in the midst of turning when the impact hit from behind  Yes   Yes   Well can you just mark on the photograph where where you were when the impact occurred  if you just mark it  You 'd need a pen  Somebody 'll give you a pen uh  Right I thought you uh when you came out you 'd moved into the lane furthest  a  away from yours  Is that right  Yes that 's right  I I I don't  I may show it to Counsel  I don't think she 's marked it correctly  She 's put it in the wrong lane from what she 's said so far  She puts it in the near-side lane instead of the outer lane  Yes My Lord  I think I understand what 's happened  Do you agree it 's wrong on what she 's said so far  I I do My Lord  several sylls   I 'm sorry  several sylls  I believe I know where this misunderstanding  if you just look at the photograph  just  do you see the photograph  Yes  Now when you  just look towards me a moment  You came out from there isn't that right  You came out there  you moved across towards the photographer and you were going to turn into  Yes  Now do you agree you 've marked it in the wrong place  Yes I have  I 've marked  I 've marked where I came out of the junction  Yeah no I  what I asked for was when you were struck  was what I asked you  in the moment of impact where were you  Sorry I was here  Yes well just  if you just would mark it afresh please  Well what I asked you to do was to  is is that meant to be the outline of the front of your car  You 've drawn the line as distinct from an X  You 've just  drawn that in have you  I was  that 's where I was turning into  Yes I appreciate that 's where you were turning in but what I wanted you to mark insofar as you could do so is where exactly your car was when it was struck  I was in the midst of turning when the car  I know that but that could be anywhere from there up into here  Just at the the start  Would you just  the tradition is if you 'd put an X and I appreciate it 's an only an approximation  if you put an X as to where your car was when it was struck rather than that long line  And take your time  get it as accurately as you can  picture is shown   Thank-you  You were already at the junction and ready to turn  several sylls  Now could you describe the actual collision to His Lordship  Repeat the question  Could you describe the actual collision to His Lordship  it may  4 sylls  counsel knows all about it  you can't ask a leading question  He can't say to you for example  if I 'm correct you were sitting at a station and this car came along at twenty miles an hour and crashed into your rear  You can't say that  You have to give the reference not me  And he 's to ask the questions in a particular way  He can't lead you  So that 's why he 's asking you in this rather official way  Ask it again please  Could you describe the collision to His Lordship  My Lord  t  t  turning when uhm  Now were you stationary or moving at the time  wasn't stationary but I was barely at a crawl  I was at a crawling pace  Yes  Indicating to turn right when I was just hit from behind  and the car swung me into the other lane then and we both came to a halt  Which was your car  U UAZ or UIB  UIB  Yes  Following the collision  can you tell His Lordship what you did  Following the collision  we got out of the car  traffic had stopped  and Mr Wheatley got out of his car  And that would be the driver of the other car  indeed  Yes  Both of us asked what happened  I said I didn't know what happened  I I was just turning and I I was  Just just a moment please  You say you both asked what happened  Yes  And what was said then  We were unsure of who caused the accident or what happened  Well if you just tell me first of all what you said and what he said  if anything  I asked what happened and  Mr Wheatley said he didn't know and then he said that we should call for police   Yes  Mr Wheatley went to the car  asked me did we want to move the cars into the side of the road  Yes  To let other drivers past  Yes  I says no  And he said he was rushing  l  already late  he was rushing to get to a football match   Yes  were the police called  Yes My Lord  the police were then called  And  The children then were taken away in the ambulance to Whiteabbey Hospital  Now you 've already told His Lordship that there was some discussion as regards whether or not the cars were moved prior to the arrival of the police  Were the cars moved  indeed not  no  Yes  Would you then tell His Lordship about after the police arrived  several sylls   The police then arrived and called for the ambulance  The children then were taken away in an ambulance to Whiteabbey Hospital  I stayed behind  my partner came up  I phoned for him to come up to see if I could get the car moved  Yes  We then we moved the car and uh I followed on in my partner 's car up to the hospital to see the children   Now how did you feel immediately after the accident  Very shocked and  concerned more about the children   were you experiencing any problems physically at that time  Just stiffness  I had hurt my chest on the  the steering wheel of the car and just  just shock and stress I think  at the point that the impact actually occurred  can you tell us what  what actually happened to you personally in the car interruption in cross-examination as barrister takes instructions   When you came uh to the junction uh and were about to take your left-hand turn on the  2 sylls  Road  did you check your right  Indeed I did  what distance was the car which was now coming down the street the car  what distance was it away from that junction uh when you looked to your right  Uh do you mean from the junction she was at or the one  from the junction you were at  to Mr Wheatley 's car  What distance  approximately  several sylls   Now that 's when you stopped and looked to your right before you exited  That 's what you 're   I 'm not sure My Lord how far back it would have been  how many yards I would be  but I believed he was far enough back he was just  But but but that 's  see you 'll have to give some idea I mean you ran a hundred yards I 'm sure  maybe metres  You know what a hundred yards is approximately  Yes  Well was it half of that or was it a hundred yards or was it twice that  It could have been seventy to a hundred yards  Yes it was  Seventy to a hundred yards to your right  Yes  Yes  when you looked and you saw that car  you then believed that you had room for the manoeuvre  For the  1 syll  to start  you had to pull out onto the  1 syll  Road  Yes that 's correct  You had to change from the left-hand lane to the right-hand lane  Go across the left-hand lane  4 sylls  But do you accept that you have to traverse across two carriageways  Is that right  That 's correct  And had to slow down  Yet you speeded up according to a friend to at least twenty-five miles per hour but by the time you reached the entrance to McDonald 's you had actually slowed your vehicle down to walking or crawling pace  That 's how you described it  That 's correct  And had indicated and then made the manoeuvre to the right  into the Abbey Centre  That 's correct  Now you knew before you pulled out that you had to make a series of manoeuvres  going from the minor road onto the major road and then making a manoeuvre from the major road into the right  Is that correct  That 's correct  Yes  And you felt that the distance of seventy to a hundred yards would allow you to do that  Yes I felt that he was far enough away for me to do that  Yes  I 'd have to suggest to you that the length of time that 's likely for you to have completed that manoeuvre would be something in the region of twelve seconds  2 sylls  ten to twelve seconds  It 's not an exact science but  several sylls  to say that that would be a reasonable time to allow you do to that manoeuvre  Yes  do you disagree or agree with that  I agree with that  And I have to suggest to you that from a distance of a hundred yards to the point of impact  if this man Mr Wheatley had been travelling at twenty miles per hour  it would have taken about fifteen seconds to cover that distance  At twenty-five miles per hour it would have taken twelve seconds  at thirty miles an hour  ten seconds and at thirty-five miles an hour  eight point six seconds  So whatever speed he was travelling at  I have to suggest to you that he would have been arriving at or about the junction about the same time as you made the manoeuvre into it
