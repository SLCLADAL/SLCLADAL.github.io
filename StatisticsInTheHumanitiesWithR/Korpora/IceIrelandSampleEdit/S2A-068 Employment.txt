<S2A-068 Employment>  Thank-you Chairman  And indeed we have had uhm a very interesting  co  very interesting contributions from all who have spoken here  the five Deputies  Deputy Bruton  Deputy Haughey  Deputy Quill  Deputy Power and Deputy Burke  showing the uh extent of interest into this whole arena  Now Deputy Bruton just to to say one thing began and quite rightly some time ago uh when we were dealing with the Apprenticeship Bill in the Da/il and he put to me that there was a need for a White Paper on the whole area of training or the manpower policy and White Paper on training  And certainly I feel uh I felt then and I have done some further work on reflection on it that that point is well put and I hope that we 'll be able to come that uh decision quite soon  I want to now go into the various points which were raised  Deputy Bruton raised the issue of both training for people in employment first of all and then the type of training we were undergoing on the uh various other uh Fa/s uh programmes  I wouldn't like it to be  do we spend money on training for the  umploy  employed at the expense of the unemployed  And I don't think that was what you meant either  I don't think it should be an either or situation for I think we should be very clear that there should be specific needs met for training for employment and the same uh for training for unemployed and they are different kinds of training involved  To deal with the employed  and to answer to other Deputies ' queries and Deputy Burke and Quill and and Bruton  the point was put to me  uh the document I spent all afternoon with IBEC yesterday  at an open forum they held and they presented me with a document at the end which inter-alia uh looked for the setting up of a specific body under IBEC  another organisation which would uh direct and have the policies for training for  employ  people in employment  Uh I was at idem on them on many points but not on that  I was at one with them on the point of we are not spending enough on training for employment and yes it does as you said Deputy Quill and Bruton  it does consolidate existing jobs  So in its own way it 's contributing to  to employment  as well as uh look to the future in innovation and research and management and all the rest of it  So uh also we don't spend either  for on private or public uh enough uh in comparison with other European countries  The uhm Fa/s have set up a special industry division  We haven't been completely satisfied with that in the Department and we have a small study going within a group of our own plus employers  major employers and and smaller employers  They 're coming up with a uhm uh ideas to us  and we 're putting that to the Minister for Finance for the ongoing estimates situation in the end of July and on into the beginning of September  And that will seek to identify both public and private monies for  training for employed people  and to have it worked then into the budget  So just to make the point that we are already working on that  and yes it does need to be done  Uh I think that  just as importantly is the content of training for that type of training  you can talk about training endlessly but it cannot be a passive activity  Clearly it has to be uh a  in which there is an interaction  To deal with another matter which has been risen which is uh education and training and the   the importance of certification  I do agree and we are very  strenuously and robustly seeking to reach an accommodation with our sister department in the Department of Education on the matter and there are difficulties in it  Uh there are difficulties of uh what I call patch politics as to whose terrain you are now stepping on or getting off  But uh be that as it may we are  hope that we can reach uh an agreement with the Department of Education and ourselves to meet the needs of training for those who are in industry  Just before I go on to the main issue which was the whole Fa/s and the Community Employment and various schemes  could I  just address Deputy Power 's point uhm about the Army Apprentice School and some time ago you gave me indeed very valued information about that and about the work that uh you knew was going on in that uh Army Apprentice School  We 've moved on that and I 've had a series of meetings myself directly and the officials with all of the state agencies that was the ESB and Bord na Mo/na and the General Council of County Councils  I 'm meeting the Army people I think within the next two weeks  seeking that each of them will use the infrastructure which they have to increase the number of apprentices in a formal sense  They 've all run them down uh in numbers I mean  not run down obviously the very uh good apprenticeships they give  But they 've run them down number-wise and I 'm seeking to see  maybe a transfer of funding  maybe some other arrangement  sh  we should use the tradition and the infrastructure which they have available for apprenticeships  to use that before we go off helter-skelter after too many other uh schemes  So I have taken your point on board  we spoke of some time ago  and I 'll keep the Committee alerted as to developments in it  And we hope that by September we 'll have reached a composite agreement with the various  including the General Council of County Councils  Now the general debate here today Chairman  'twas was very useful  was on whither goes Fa/s and what is it doing  And what are the value and uh has it done efforts to rationalise itself  And uh to Deputy Bruton I would say that we are addressing the issue of rationalising programmes  That is why we brought SES and CEDP and Teamwork together in the one programme called Community Employment  Now it does not  it 's not an overnight panacea uh to give everybody long-term unemployed uh a guarantee that at the end of their time on Community Employment they will have progressed to a job  But can I just go through the positive points of it  there 's much more training in it than there was in any of the other previous schemes and I myself with responsibility for training am making   devising the formula of the curriculum and the modules for the training in it  in conjunction with Fa/s  a long-term concern was that uh  commun  uh SES and Teamwork and CDP were just for a year  Up to fifty percent of the people who will be on Community Employment will be able to be kept on for two and three years if they 're key  key employees and if they need more training  uh where the Community Employment allows of that  There is far more female involvement  At the last count there was up to forty percent of between the old CDP and what is now the Community Employment there was up to forty percent of female employment on Community Employment  But there needs to be  I take your point  there uh lone parents are allowed if they 're in receipt of the allowance  the uh Lone Parent Allowance and others  But there needs to be much more broadening of it  Those who are not on the register for instance  signing on for credits  women are not allowed uh on to the Community Employment  And there 's a clear   uh uh uh issue of discrimination there  I think we also would need to face up to the fact that that obviously there 's a clear political issue as well  And uh members of the Committee will know to what I refer  So it 's a matter of uh openly addressing an issue such as that  the level of training on them is going to increase  I 'm very uh emphatic that it has  the content of that training has to be proper and it has to be based on proper standards and it has to lead to certification  But there 's a much more important element in it and I  I 'm determined that we 're going to get it  the OECD report and other reports from uhm NESC and from the new forum have said that there needs to be this hand-holding exercise  particularly OECD referred to it very strongly  They said we have to be interventionist in the active labour market  In other words  to take up Deputy Burke 's point and Bruton and and Quill and all of you  there 's no point in putting somebody on a programme and saying  there you are  now you 've got something for twelve months or a year and a half or even two years  And then shunting them out when the programme is over  That way spells increasing cynicism with the type of programme  What we have to have on it and what we have started to do with the new community employment is that there is quite intense uh vocational guidance  there is quite intense uhm counselling  eventually leading to job placement within local areas through the local area partnerships which have been identified  Those of you who come from areas which are local area partnerships and there 'll be more of them know that the mix of industry  the mix of unions  the mix of workers on it  allows of doors to be opened to long-term unemployed which were not previously being done  I know there particular successes in some of the north Dublin area partnerships and I know in some of the Cork ones as well because the presence on them of quite formidable industrialists whether present or of past uh enables as I said doors to be opened for the long-term unemployed which would never have come right for them  It 's easy to say  you say to employers  take on long-term unemployed  there is a  is a resistance there shouldn't be  I think there 's a moral imperative on all of us to do what we can for long-term unemployed and that means employers as well  Be that as it may there 's the resistance to it  where the area partnership involvement by industrialists has allowed as I said the door to be opened in that respect  I freely accept Chairman  that we 're only at the beginning  I Maureen Quill used something and I did feel uh a slight fellow  laughs  feeling with it which was  were we stumbling into changes  good changes with regards to to necessary changes with regard to what uh we 're at with Community Employment and various others  We are feeling our way but I  we 're very clear in the way we want to get to it  We want to see people going into employment at the end of it as much as possible  We want to see proper training  We want to see longer duration  We want to see local uh vocational guidance counselling and active job placement in the local community  And we want to see that in a direct targeted proactive way  We are working our way through that agenda  It 's a massive agenda and it is a huge amount of money being spent on it  And this committee and us and everyone on it has a right to see that it 's spent correctly and I hope that we would have an opportunity to talk about it in a slightly perhaps less uh uh frenetic environment or a less rushed uh timescale  And to go back to Deputy Bruton  I am giving active consideration to a White Paper on training  I think if we could do that and set out where each of our ideas is  are going and what would be the outcome as well as the input into it  we would have come uh quite a bit of the way  It 's been a brief encapsulation of what has been put forward  And just to take up a point yes that Deputy Burke said which was social welfare  uh I agree with you  Uhm there 's a need to look at social welfare and the huge billions which go into that as an active  1 syll  of money rather than a passive sense  Uh and I feel we 'll have to go along that route as well
