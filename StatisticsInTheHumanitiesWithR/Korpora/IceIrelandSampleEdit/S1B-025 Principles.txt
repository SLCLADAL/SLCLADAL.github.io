<S1B-025 Principles>  Frances can I ask you  has everyone got the right to their own opinion  I believe everybody do has uh has the right to their own opinions but when it comes to actually having actions on those opinions and trying to enforce them on other people then you do get a lot of complications with the opinions  Is that the distinction  Uh Edward you were nodding to that  Oh well I would most firmly agree  Uh no-one has the right to uh force their opinions on another person especially as they 're often unproven  and have no substance in scientific fact or reality such as the health fascist groups  Right  Anti-smoking ASH et-cetera  Now we will come to them in a moment  Packie can I ask you does anyone have the right to enforce their opinions on others  I believe people are entitled to their own point of view certainly and their own opinion  But it 's when  they expect other people to have the same view as themselves and I think that 's a problem here in Northern Ireland  People expect people to believe what they believe  And if you don't then you 're seen as different  Isn't this one of the problems though that sometimes there 's a conflict because what you believe in may prevent someone else from believing in what they hold to be true  Andrew Puddephat  where does where does Liberalism uh draw that distinction  Well the right to hold your own beliefs and own opinions is one of the most profound liberal democratic values that goes back several hundred years  And I think the the limit comes when you seek to impose those views on others and in the exercise of your own personal belief seek to restrict the rights of other people to hold their own opinions  And that 's the limit  li  the limits of my right to have my own opinion uh begins that the end of that is where it begins to impinge on someone else 's rights  And therefore that 's the test I think one has to apply   Graham do you do you share what uh Andrew Puddephat 's just said  I don't think we can make windows into men 's hearts as Queen Elizabeth the First said and that would be my opinion  We can't we can't make people think how they how we would want them to think  Gerry what do you think  We can't make people think  Well I  first of all it 's important to have conviction  the best lacking all conviction and the worst full of passionate intensity  was the observation made by Yeats  ma  we have to have personal beliefs  We have to have convictions  The point hinges on how we use those opinions to alter the lives of others  I like to think of conviction as being mainly private that they they would drive me but they wouldn't necessarily upset other people   3 sylls    Uh Edward uh Nesbit can I come to you  Uhm you mentioned earlier about health fascists  Yes  Uh why do you have a problem with health fascists  Well because health fascists are engaged in a crusade of persecution against those who exercise their absolutely legal right to smoke  They do this on a totally unscientific and absolutely unproven basis  And if by my  well I call them fascists because  they  think like fascists they act like fascists they talk like fascists so presumably they are fascists  Why do you call them fascists   Now if you   Right well we 've got someone who beside you who 'd probably take issue with being called a fascist  I don't know what you how you 'd call yourself on this  Well I certainly would refute the fact that I I am seen as a fascist  I work every day in an organisation The Ulster Cancer Foundation that works uh in both trying to put forward the facts of smoking  And I don't believe our listeners this evening have any  uh difficulty in accepting the fact that smoking in this community is dangerous  But what would you try and do with the knowledge you say that you have about smoking  Would you try and ban it in public places  Ban it on  uh uh  the underground or or in trains  Ban it on the yeah   Yes I I believe that uh there are places that smoking should be banned  But I do believe that adults individual adults have a right to smoke if they  so decide  But I do think that there are some people in the community that need protected  If it was an opinion to smoke that was not dangerous but I 'm thinking at the moment of children and smoking  I think our children do have a right to be protected and to be taught and educated  about smoking   Did did  Edward do you do you need to be protected   No no I  am an adult and I am perfectly capable deciding what I shall do  And I don't see that anyone has the right to seek to prevent me from doing or to engage in such activities as to uh constructively deny me the right to attend the cinema constructively deny me the right to earn a living which is what these intolerant fanatics are about  Do you need to be protected   Uhm Myc Riggulsford   what 's your view on this  We should educate people about the things that are going to happen to them if they smoke and the chances of getting cancer  Now you can then decide on the basis of the  that information whether you want to take that risk or not  And that 's up to you   Pastor McKee uh uh do you think this is a matter where we ought to compromise as a society  I think that the answer really is not to to ban smoking uh altogether  The answer is to uhm cause the smokers to uh recognise that we have uh an opinion as well  They are entitled to smoke yes  But if that opinion is going to uh affect my lifestyle and damage me then they 're not entitled to that opinion  Is this the dilemma then for us again if it  affects other people then it 's something that we ought to as a whole look for  I would just like to quote something from uh  Oc  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the United States  Now this bear in mind is not a  2 sylls  group  This is a health fascist organisation who are trying to ban smoking virtually everywhere including the street  We recognise that there is no epidemiological data about workplace ETS  environmentud  but we don't feel it 's necessary to wait for them  And that is their so called proof  Right now Wilson  The issue here  and that seems to be  the issue that seems to be uhm coming to the fore here is precisely how far we as a society are willing to put ourselves in danger in order to defend the individual liberties of others  I personally feel that uh the individual liberty of another to smoke is worth whatever risk I may be putting myself in by sitting in a room with that person  I  think that individual liberties are more important than the  infint  infinitesimal risk from passive smoking  Yes   Yeah  Is that is that the ultimate dilemma then how far the freedom of the individual can be  reconciled with the rights of that individual to harm himself or others  Do you do you accept that  Paul   Yeah that 's  John Stuart Mill 's principle of liberty that we should be free to do what we like ourselves providing we don't infringe the liberties  or  happiness or health of other people  That 's that 's fair  you know   Right   Right   On health grounds you you smoke  I smoke yes  yeah   But  do you eat meat for instance  I 'm keeping away from beef at the moment until they identify the little beasts that 's causing the mad cow disease yeah  But if it 's in the milk we we 've had it anyway  I think   Okay yeah  Does everyone have a right though to eat meat  Some people might believe that it 's morally wrong to uh to kill animals and to eat them  Vivienne what what do you think  Uhm the animal uhm killing business is very cruel  It and it 's very often been muted that if people had to kill  their own food for the table uh there would be vastly more vegetarians in the world   What do you say though to those people in the animal rights movement who uhm set fire to the laboratories for instance or they attack farms and they uhm try and prevent people from from from uh actually processing meat  I can understand it 's just frustration   You can understand their frustration  Yeah I 'm I 'm not advocating it 's right or wrong  I can say I can understand people feeling so passionately like the gentleman here at the front  I mean whether we agree or disagree is neither here nor there but you passionately feel these things  I can understand their frustration   w  what is the  dilemma  Can I ask you Brian  Well I think uh animals well probably most of them were there before we came on earth or evolved were there and they 've got equal rights to us yes   So how does that reflect itself on on how you view people who try and stop people from eating meat  Do you agree with it or disagree with it  Uh I  well I would go even further because I 'm a vegan of thirty years standing and I don't wear or use anything of animal origin  And what I 'm  trying to say rather than forcing people is say well  we have examples going back three generations of vegans who are living quite healthily  and they are frugivores which all of us are by nature  We do not need to eat meat to live healthily   You you 're a  meat-eater Myc  what 's your  view on this   Yes yes  I I I think that 's uh uh a very good point of view  I would I would fight forever for the right for people not to have to eat meat if they don't want to eat meat  But on the other hand I don't think the vegans should be out there uhm causing damage to people who do  And I don't believe the vegans do for that very reason  They 're you know peaceful people who 've decided they 're not going to harm other people   But don't we have a dilemma here  If we believe that animals are equal to people in terms of their rights surely then we can't kill and eat them  Yes I think uh  very logical really because we love animals in so many uh areas with our pets but then all this murder is  uh created in order to eat animals and I think uh every animal has its right to life  its life is valuable to it in the way that ours is  And I don't think the human race has the right to take  animal life   So then we  so then we ought to prevent those who seek to try and kill and process and eat meat  Uhm well I think just with the er example perhaps and and and spreading knowledge about uh alternative ways of living that we don't need to kill animals that uhm animal animals are are beautiful creatures  and  deserve their life   Right   Now we have uh in the audience you you 're a farmer Graham uh Craig as I understand it  Uhm what 's your view to the to the uh uh uh well uh expression of of outrage that animals ought to be killed  Uh I 'm a farmer  I produce both meat uh and uh milk and mutton  And I would just like to  make one point first  There have been attacks on butchers in the east and north Down regions and when I worked in the Farmers ' Union there were numerous cases  came to us of such attacks  As regards animals having rights animals do not have rights since they have don't have souls  Uh they can't think for themselves  However  we as farmers and human beings have responsibilities to raise animals in the most humane way possible  Well why is there a distinction drawn for instance between battering a seal or a a cuddly animal and standing on a beetle  Why if this is a moral absolute is there any difference at all  Uhm Connor you 've got your your hand up again  I think that there is a lack of recognition nowadays that  every animal no matter what size it is  is capable of feeling  every feeling and emotion that humans can  And uh he 's saying over there that animals have no rights because they don't have a soul  I don't know what on earth that 's meant to mean  But that 's it was that kind of argument that was used during the black slave trade and now look at the way we 're looking at it  And I think there is an advancement of what people think of uh animals and uh  the situation should improve  Vivienne what what do you think  Well I think uh Graham is it uh lives in the Dark Ages  I think it 's time he realised there 's a great swell of public opinion  Animals do have rights  Animals the important issue as Connor said there they have feelings  They feel pain  They feel emotions  They feel love hate everything that we feel  And I think it 's time we actually moved out of the Dark Ages and went with the tide of conviction that people feel these days   But what do you think about uh Graham 's conviction  Is he not entitled to hold it  Of course he is but I think it 's slightly antiquated and I think it 's time he knows   Can I also say that nine times out of ten I would say animals are far more uh   You going to say nicer than people  Yeah educated far better than people  I mean they know more they 're more uhm they say they say a year-old calf for instance knows more than six-week-old baby  Right  To me I think animals have more brains than humans  some of them   If they have  if they have more brains and and they have a a personality uh Vivienne why why do you we as a society allow uhm experimentation on them
