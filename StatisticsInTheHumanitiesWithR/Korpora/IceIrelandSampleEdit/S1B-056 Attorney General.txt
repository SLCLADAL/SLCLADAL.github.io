<S1B-056 Attorney General>  As regards to the rush to the Park uh Taoiseach  uhm can I ask you at what stage did you discover that the Labour ministers were absenting themselves  Uh did you proceed to the Park to put Mr Whelehan beyond accountability to this House in the belief that the Labour ministers had merely dropped out to hear the latest from the count centre in Cork  Secondly can I ask you Taoiseach  if you were satisfied that the Minister for Justice was unaware of the existence of these warrants  is it not the case that matters of far less serious import than a child abuser at loose in this jurisdiction would have been drawn to the personal attention of the Minister for Justice and that in this case this information was brought to her desk  And finally Taoiseach can I ask you to answer the question that the people uh of Ireland want to know  which is why you would put your government at risk and your own reputation and future as Taoiseach for the purposes of making Mr Whelehan President of the High Court  And can I ask you if you can recall with me the intervention of the then Attorney General to direct his Senior Counsel to intervene when you were being questioned on the motivation for your decisions as Minister for Industry and Commerce before the Beef Tribunal and that as a result of his intervention the  Cabine  the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality was given rise to which had the effect of saving your political neck  and that the reason  that the reason that you have appointed Mr Harry Whelehan President of the High Court is to repay that debt despite his lamentable performance  unclear simultaneous speech from members  despite his lamentable performance  He should be very careful about such innuendo  Such innuendo should not be  should not happen in this House  An  Taoiseach  I have no  I 've no intention of raising to the bait of such outrageous allegations being made in this House  outrageous  There 's nothing outrageous about it  unclear simultaneous speech  bell rings   several words  question be responded to  unclear simultaneous speech   Resume your seat Deputy Rabbitte  Please resume your seat  unclear simultaneous speech   several words  enquire behind the motivations for your decision as Minister for Industry and Commerce bell rings   That 's why these questions  There are but there are but there are but eight minutes left and there are other Deputies to be accommodated  unclear simultaneous speech   several words  to Galmoy tomorrow  if there is a tomorrow  we 'll be back to Galmoy  please let us hear the Taoiseach   several sylls  Taoiseach 's doing the threatening in this House  I know who 's threatening to look into the backgrounds of Deputy McDowell  Deputy Rabbitte  would Deputy Rabbitte wish to monopolise the remaining seven minutes   An  Taoiseach  I 've no intention as I say as to  to rising  Muffled speech of Deputies in background   An  Taoiseach  To rising to that bait  Determination in all those facts was carried out by one Justice Liam Hamilton and I 'll leave his report intact  Uh in relation to this uh colourful mad rush to the Park if  Deputy Rabbitte and I I I I don't know you must have been out because otherwise I explained in detail to Deputy Mitchell who raised that particular problem or raised that particular aspect of this case  I have said and I  repeat that uh there was no mad rush to the Park as you would suggest in relation to it  that uh the the Secretary of the Government was asked after the Cabinet meeting to make the appropriate uh arrangements for it uh as I say other uhm diaries of of commitments already given had to be taken into consideration and I 'm sure the deputy will appreciate that  that uh Saturday was not suitable uh for  2 sylls  reasons  Saturday was not suitable  There was no mad rush to the Park  The the Government 's Secretary made the appropriate arrangements and we had to comply and indeed make availability  make our availability indeed to dovetail with somebody else 's in  in relation to their particulars  I want to  unclear simultaneous speech  I want to put it on the record that at no time  and I want to say this  unequivocally at no time did I discuss whatever Deputy Rabbitte is trying to infer here I don't know  in relation to somehow uh the former Attorney General involving himself some way or another which I know nothing about and if if Deputy Rabbitte wants to substantiate that I 'll be glad to have it investigated for him  Deputy Bobby Molloy  unclear simultaneous speech    A  Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I have part of an answer  I still have another part of an answer in relation to Deputy Rabbitte and that is the  the whole question again of the role of the Department of Justice  The impression created by today 's media reporting of the role of the Department of Justice in the Smyth extradition case is misleading in that it proceeds on the false assumption that the Department of Justice was in possession of certain essential information  The factual position does not say so  As is normal practice in extradition cases  a copy of the warrants in the Smyth case was sent  unclear simultaneous speech  If I  If I am asked here  I 'm not regulating the questions here  If I 'm asked a question  Deputy Rabbitte has the same right to get a reply as everybody else  as everybody else  the same right  However  unclear simultaneous speech   Too many interruptions from either side of the House please  However  however the  however the information  the information contained in the warrant stated the name of the person sought but without any reference to his being a priest  It gave a previous Northern Ireland address only  and signified the offence by reference to named persons without giving their ages  and relevant provisions of the Offences Against the Persons Act of eighteen sixty-one  indecent assault  against a male  and in one case  a female  unclear simultaneous speech   I have a statement in a half  for a half an hour  I know I put a statement on the record  if Deputy  if Deputy  if Deputy Rabbitte wants the information read out that 's his prerogative  If he wants to ask supplementary questions arising out of the information that 's still his  is his prerogative  I am not going to read the rest  If Deputy Rabbitte is happy with what I 've given him I 'll leave out the other two pages  Deputy Robert Molloy  I call Deputy Molloy if he wishes to uh put a question  2 sylls  Can I ask uh some questions of the Taoiseach please just three points  First of all uh in the Taoiseach 's opinion is the Attorney General responsible for maladministration in his office  That 's one question  Uhm in view of the fact that uh for  some months prior to the President of the High Court being appointed the Taoiseach was well aware uh of the strong opposition of uh his colleagues in the partnership government Labour Party  Why then did he persist in proceeding uhm with that appointment  And also finally could he tell the House uh how he could possibly come to the conclusion that the Labour Party were merely absenting themselves from the Government meeting merely to uhm register their non-participation uh in the decision uh to appoint Harry Whelehan uh as the Attorney General uh when they obviously remained out for the remainder uh of that uh Government meeting  exp  the explanation given Taoiseach in your statement to the House so far is not plausible that you could possibly have come to that decision  An  Taoiseach  Well the indeed uh the explanation as to what went wrong in the system is it may  it 's not plausible it 's not acceptable and I agree with Deputy Molloy in that regard  Uh as uh the question of responsibility I dealt with that very clearly I dealt with responsibility I dealt with accountability and I dealt with culpability  Here today in my statement  here today in relation to many questions as well  respons  responsibility I quoted W T Cosgrave and somebody questioned questioned that here  unclear simultaneous speech  responsibility  the responsibility  several words  to the questions I put  Not the Taoiseach  several sylls  written down on the one page  several sylls   Don't worry about that  Three minutes and I want to accommodate the final Deputy  respons  the responsibility  if people if people don't accept what was there and I accept what Deputy McDowell said but the Constitution hasn't been changed in that regard from an earlier supplementary that he asked  uh the responsibility clearly lies with the government as a whole in relation to what W T Cosgrave has said  that the President of the Executive Council nineteen twenty-four stated given the necessity to have someone to answer for the Attorney General in this House where he was not a member and I quote  in this arrangement the Executive Council has the general responsibility and must be prepared to answer for the Attorney  for the  several words   Deputy McDowell please  it is laid down where the responsibility lies by the very first uh post-independent Irish Government at the time of the Ministers and Secretaries Act  woul   several words   I might add I might add I might add if I was allowed  I might add if I was allowed  that that is seventy years ago  and I think that this House would agree with me  would agree with me  that as part of the strategic management initiative which I 'm undertaking  please  with regard to the strategic management initiative that I have taken  that it is time to look  and it 's in everybody 's interest in this House  it is time to look at the nineteen twenty-four Ministers and Secretaries Act again  Not alone  not alone from a government 's point of view but  but indeed in relation to Secretaries of Departments who are finding themselves in invidious positions regarding decisions taken down the line  I think this is an issue that this Da/il could indeed address and address itself quite profitably in that regard because if my colleague sitting beside me  if my colleague sitting beside me Deputy Bertie Ahern has a hundred  as Minister for the Public Service has a hundred and eighty-seven odd thousand uh employees under his direction  is this House seriously suggesting that any single member of a hundred and eighty-seven thousand who make a mistake that he indeed has to take full responsibility  He he is responsible but he 's not  but he 's not culpable  That 's an exercise that I 'm leaving for a future date in this House  I 'm sorry  That concludes questions  That concludes questions  I must now  several words  The Chair does not have any discretion on that I  I fear  I must now move on to  Leas-Cheann Comhairle you indicated you were calling me  and I would love to facilitate the Deputy   several words   If Deputy Mitchell   several words   Deputy Mitchell if I  if the Deputy would listen to me please  If the Deputy would listen to me  If the Deputy would listen to me   several words   several words  a few minutes to allow one question  If I if I had the discretion I would accommodate the Deputy  several words   I do not  I do not  and I do not have the discretion  By an order of the House of this day I must now call on the Taoiseach to respond to the statement  simultaneous and unclear speech   An  Taoiseach  The House has agreed for  An  Taoiseach  The Taoiseach is agreeing to allowing me  An uh attempt to ask the Taoiseach another question but in fact Mr Reynolds is now due to make a detailed statement   Could I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to allow Deputy Mitchell a final question even though  I have been  answering here for an hour and  fifteen  minutes  Okay is that agreed   Agreed   Ceann Comhairle  Leas-Cheann Comhairle could I ask the Taoiseach  Deputy Mitchell is going to be allowed to ask a question   Can I ask the Taoiseach  On a point of order  Yes Deputy de Rossa  Uh I think it it would be fairer if a spokesperson from each of the parties in opposition were allowed to ask a final question  simultaneous and unclear speech  No I mean fair is fair  If you 're  simultaneous and unclear speech   May I ask the Taoiseach  In relation to page sixteen of his speech in which he says  in my opinion it follows that I personally and the Government as a whole must take some responsibility for the deficiencies in the  in the operation of extradition procedures in the AG 's office as brought to light in the Smyth case  means that he is saying that the Ta/naiste and the Labour Party should share in the guilt of the decision he made last Friday  May I ask him in relation to page twenty of his speech  in which he says  my view of good government is that it must be decisive  is he contrasting this with the Labour Party 's insistence on accountability as indecision and isn't he isn't he in effect getting in his retaliation first so to speak  And finally may I ask the Taoiseach  why is it that none of the seventeen or so existing High Court judges from whom every President of the High Court since nineteen twenty-four was chosen was not suitable for the job on this occasion  An  Taoiseach  I 'm not getting into the latter part of Deputy Mitchell 's question and well he knows it  what I was discussing here in relation to the responsibility of the government as indeed laid down by W T Cosgrave as President of the Executive Council was in relation to the office of the Attorney General  tri  I have time and time again here this afternoon separated the actions of the and the procedures  and the systems and the office  from what the Attorney General himself personally knew and wasn't told in regards to the Smyth uh to the the the whole Smyth case
