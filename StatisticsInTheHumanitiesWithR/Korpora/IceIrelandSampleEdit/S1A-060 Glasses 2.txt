<S1A-060 Glasses 2>  The twenty-fourth of November  wow  Sure we 're only beginning to save up for it now  Crimbo 's only around the corner  Remember in school you used to have Kris Kindle  Uh yeah  I only had it for the one year now you know  Well Eithne had it a number of years  I thought you had it over in Saint Teresa 's   Scoil San Treasa   Oh yeah  maybe that 's right yeah  There was a bit of a problem though in secondary school with it  Got a bit out of hand you know  Some of the presents were too extravagant  People were being put under pressure to buy things that were just too much for them  So  Well you see what happened if  people 's  the generosity was  going overboard  If   They stopped it  and uhm basically because it was getting too expensive and stuff  And uhm  I think they were right   well yeah   All the  all the little children going home I want a big pressie for my Kris Kindle  Well  It got out of hand  There 's  no doubt   Apparently  people started giving each other things like cameras and things  I 'd like that  Mm  I 'm tired  I feel like going to bed now instead of going out tonight  Ah no I 'm I 'm   3 sylls    Ah when I get  out I 'll enjoy it  You will  You might even win your Christmas  your Christmas arrangement  your Christmas ensemble  I 've all this work to do  It 's crazy  I 've so many things to do  Stop moaning and get on with it    But everybody needs to have a little moan on and off  laughter  I do  I do anyway  Everybody needs to let off steam  get things off their chest  Uh   How about a treat  Do you want  a fag  What   No I will not take a cigarette  I have given up cigarettes  It 's a  hard choice  but I 've managed it  No I 've managed it now  So have I   I have about four or five left in a box there  since I 've given them up and I was going to let you have a treat  Yeah  I don't mind you having one or two cigarettes a day  but this thing of puffing permanently into the sky is not on  I don't puff permanently into the sky  almost permanently  laughter   Not nearly  When you were doing your exams you did a fair amount of puffing  Anyway what film did you go and see at the weekend with Dad  I 've forgotten the name of it  Uh  That animated one The Lion King  Did you see that  Ah that was beautiful  Yeah saw that the weekend before last  It was absolutely beautiful  I know  We went to this weekend to see Speed  Was it   I thought that was  really good  I really enjoyed that  It was really action-packed  It was great  It was tense but it was a little bit silly  It went yeah it was  And the romantic bit between uhm your one and your man was just you know  really was crazy  Really was  We 're going to see the Lion King again  We liked it so much  Are you  Yeah  Again  I 'm a child at heart  I 'd watch all the  children 's uh films happily  If this year Scrooge is on at Christmas I 'm taping it  And then anybody tapes over it they 're for the high jump  And   We had  videoed it before  I know and some bright person put something like Neighbours or Home and Away or  Melrose Place  or El Dorado over it  Those great   Those those great soaps  They 're they 're the biz  They 're the best  They give a whole false impression of what life is about particularly university life  Yeah but people always come back to reality after that though  you know  Anyhow I haven't decided what I 'm going to do this weekend  I 'll do something exciting  Have a ball  I 'm only free on Friday night because I 'm working on  the  Saturday  so it 's not too much free time is it  Actually the match is on tonight  I 'd say there 's some people going out tonight  Saturday night   Well for some reason there doesn't seem to be an awful lot of  interest   No  there actually isn't  No there 's not like  there was  well there was more interest for the uh  for the USA  versus Ireland match   Oh  why wouldn't there  Yeah well  Totally different ballgame  Yeah I don't know what it was  See as well it was on on a Saturday night so  you know you 'd think that there 'd be more going out anyway to start with  And then you know  wasn't supposed to be  I was working that night as well and it wasn't supposed to be very good out because it was either over-packed or else it was just  you know it was too young or  Didn't work out at all  They ended up going into town afterwards  and going to a dinner   So at twenty you   so at twenty you consider yourself old  Well there was sixteen and seventeen year olds there  They should 've been home in bed  well they should have been doing stuff like going to the cinema  or  Ah there 'll probably be a fair few people around or  I wonder will Eithne feel she has to go out  Probably not  It 's on at seven  Oh well she 's going to the gym at seven  or half seven   Well  that finishes at  well that doesn't finish until  about half eight  Well she obviously isn't planning on going but somebody will probably tell her today about it   I was thinking about getting contact lenses  laughter  Except for  except for I only wear them for reading  But they 're so cumbersome  They really are  Mmm   If  you were wearing glasses permanently  and you  felt that you know  they were  spectacles were awkward but  you just wear them for study and  and not even for reading but just for study close study  you 'd be mad to get them  Ah yeah   Yeah well  if I was wearing them permanently I 'd uh I 'd definitely get contacts  I always remember one night Rosemary lost her contact lens  in uh one of them in Jury 's  Just as we were going out the front door about twelve o'clock at night  we were all down on our hands and knees looking for the contact lens  And uh visitors  who were staying in Jury 's came in the front door and they all got down and they helped us  And she found it   Mind you   Yeah  you do  Mind you it 's become the thing now to insure your contact lenses so I suppose it 's not too serious if you lose them   What   What  do you want for your dinner  Oh uhm I 'd I 'd like  chicken  Fried rice from Jumbo  Chicken fried rice would be groovy  It would be really really groovy  Yeah that 'd be quite nice  Ah be quite nice really   2 sylls    I don't think  your father would fancy chicken fried chicken flied lice  laughter   That 's the way they say it  Yeah chicken flied lice  I don't think he fancies it  I could get him sliced beef and mushrooms  I think the problem with Dad is that he 's worked so much in hotels  that he just doesn't enjoy  Uh he likes a good piece of roast  medium  done with nice veggies and potatoes  He 's not particularly on for Indian Chinese meals  Does he   Did you get the yoke fixed on the phone  What do you mean  The code switch  Well we 've had one false call today  What  We 've had one false call today  Mm  And it stopped  But basically I think it 's uh  it 's fixed  But the problem is the phone in the hall is as if it was crying  when it rings  Ah it 's terrible  It 's so and you can't like it 's not even a ring anymore  sound of phone   It 's kind of  sound of phone  It isn't it  It 's like a  miniature ambulance   It 's like a person  It 's like a person in pain in the hall  laughter  It actually is  Ah it 's better though I think since he changed the code on it  Yeah  I wonder when will he get his car phone put in  Do you get it put in  Is it not just completely portable  Oh yeah  He 's got to bring it into Donnybrook and get a number for it  Mm anyway I 've a written a letter  to the tax office   Well can I tell you something first   Can I tell you something first  What I fancy is a telephone  whereby whoever rings you has to pay for the call  Well you 'll be a long time getting  getting uh  Be one sure  fire way   Whoever  rings you has to pay for the call  Yeah  But that happens anyway  You mean whoever you ring  Oh gosh I 'm a bit mixed up now  That 's me  laughter  on automation  That was  On automatic  That was the way I was at work on Saturday  Switched onto automatic  that 's the way you get after a while  I have got to go into town and finish the Christmas shopping  Will you come in  some day  Saturday  Well uh   No I haven't done my Crimbo shopping and I don't intend to for a long time yet  Your Christmas shopping  I wasn't talking about your Christmas shopping  I 'm talking about mine
