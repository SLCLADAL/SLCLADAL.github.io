like  that 's not like Miriam  Is she having a fight with Tommy  No I don't think I think any Tommy 's the least of her problems at the moment  Tommy 'd be the most of mine if I had him  laughter   I think Tommy 's the least of her problems  I don't know  Don't know what 's wrong with her  She 's been like this for about a week  Has she gone to college yet  I haven't seen her  Well I was  talking to her on uh  Saturday night and I said do you go to the common room at all  And she went oh no  Excuse me  You know Miriam  Tut tut tut tut   Yeah  I don't imagine that she 'd be like running around making friends with everybody  See that 's her problem  She won't like she doesn't make any friends she won't be able to  she won't stay  She won't stick it out if she 's  no friends   That 's  what I mean  And that I 'm I 'd  walk around the canteen   She 'll go into them drugs  with Tommy  God  What was  I going to say to you  I 'd walk   What  laughter   I walk around the

didn't think he would  Do you know Rose-Marie is supposed to be calling round to me last was supposed to call round to me last night  Yeah I know  but she   But she  didn't  And  I don't think she 's going to call round tonight either  And she can't call round tomorrow cos I 'm working  Mm   Is she is she in Dublin at the moment  She 's doing a computer course for work  Oh really  For how long  A week  Oh really  Well she was that 's strange she didn't call round then  I think it might have been raining  She only lives up the road doesn't she  She only lives out in Ranelagh and that 's only fifteen minutes away  Oh  Oh well I 'm certainly not walking out there  I well I was out there  last week  I was out there last week  Was it last week  Yeah   3 sylls    Mm  Week before last  I was out there  I 'm not walking anywhere  Neither I 'm staying in  Talking of which my boyfriend was supposed to ring me  but he didn't yet  I 've to stay in and do this project and

Angela are coming up tomorrow  Are they  Yeah  Are they going to move up here again  I think if they 're going to move anywhere they 're going to move on the north side cos Caitriona reckons that she won't get a flat on the south side this time of the year  That 's ridiculous  Well that 's Caitriona  It 's not ridiculous  It 's Caitriona  Rose-Marie says that Caitriona is not moving in anywhere until Rose-Marie gets her money back  a  Caitriona owes Rose-Marie two hundred pounds  She 's dead right about that then  So I 'd I 'd I 'd like to be around when Rose-Marie tells Caitriona that she 's not moving anywhere til Rose-Marie gets paid back  laughter   There 'll be war  There 's going to be war  Mm  As long as I 'm not there I don't mind  Yeah I know
