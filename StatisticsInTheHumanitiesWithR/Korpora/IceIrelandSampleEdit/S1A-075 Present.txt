don't know why I 'm doing it  Well I like to  that kind of folk  dance  well I 'm not mad into going up on  stage  in front of a crowd of people but  Yeah   Yeah   Sure it 'll be good craic  It 'll be  yeah I suppose it 'll be a laugh  But do you want to go along  Well listen I 'm not going to force youse to go  But if you want to go it 's six pounds a head and there 's dinner as well  Where is it  It 's on in Monkstown the Irish Cultural Centre  Oh no  Cultu/rlann na hE/ireann   That 's the right place for the Irish  laughter   Well I know  Sarcasm  laughter   Yeah I know I

laughter   No the horse show is on at the moment  An international horse show down in Cavan  Oh right  yeah is he doing stuff down there or what  Yeah  Oh right and  are you planning on going there  I don't know  I might go down for a bit  Are you going down  in the car or  I don't know  Uh probably Sunday evening  4 sylls   Sunday afternoon  Ah well  I 'm leaving it open like  Yeah you know   5 sylls    We 'll tell you   Yeah well like  if you 're coming  if you 're interested    6 sylls   How did your exams go  You 've had exams already  No continuous assessment   the main exams are coming at the beginning of January  in the month of January  Yeah   So how 's chemistry going so far  Uh it 's not very it 's not too bad  I mean there 's some subjects that are absolutely horrible  4 sylls   Quantum mechanics   There 's no chemistry  Ah no no no  there  well we haven't actually started quantum I mean we touched all these things last year but  we  we haven't done it full-time I mean big time this year yet  We were just on inorganic really and organic  Yeah   physical organic and quantum mechanics  Well no actually  he gave us some notes on quantum mechanics but he hasn't gone into it big time yet  He has only given us notes  uh for us to be able to do the mathematics behind it which   4 sylls    That 's just wonderful   so we to understand what 's going on  It 's all  determinants and matrices and all that shit  Yeah  Just for quantum mechanics like you know  I mean   Hey  people I 'm lost  laughter   well there there is  So are we  laughter    you know   Yeah  I know what you mean  All I 'm  saying is  we 're all lost  Yeah mechanics  and  6 sylls    You know I   Oh right  it 's just uhm   well that 's okay  That 's fair enough but the subjects  clears throat  I had exams on on Tuesday one is GLP and the other one was inorganic chemistry  I thought I knew my  inorga  remember  what day was it I was talking to you  Uhm  And you asked me to come  and I said no I 've got exams that time  Was it the night before my exams or two days before that  It was a Thursday or Friday night  Oh right okay  Of last week  Oh right  and I I didn't have time to study or anything  No cos you were having people over and then you had the exams on Monday  And then I had the practice thing on  Monday  as well and all that  So like I was panicking on Monday night  I had only read my inorganic twice so far okay  which was good I suppose considering  laughter  you know  considering  Yup   laughter   Yeah I suppose  But you know and then I started GLP at about a quarter to ten which is for the laboratory practices  And it was the biggest load of waffle I have ever read in my whole entire life  The most uninterestingly stupid subject I 've come across  Mm hmm  It 's just so boring so utterly boring  I can't express it enough  It 's just horrible  and I need   We  have these little notebooks on lab  2 sylls  you know guidelines and that on what to do and  what not to do  5 sylls    Oh well I mean we we had them  in first year as well like  touch flame or don't stick your hand in the flame  That 's fair enough but  Avoid wash bottles  laughter   Oh stop here  I used to adore it  laughter   Wash bottle  technician   Oh  no no  not I just   Qualified after  four years ' experience  Yeah exactly yeah  No I 'm not that bad anymore  I mean I 'm usually pretty busy in the lab  2 sylls  and stuff like that  But I mean the any odd chance just turn around and squish you know  laughter  and I usually get screamed at  But uh what was I saying  oh yeah this subject is so uninteresting  Started reading it at about quarter to ten  ten o'clock  Oh my God there 's no way I can do this  There are twelve lectures I 've to get through  each of them consisting of four pages right  well two pages back and front which is four pages  the whole thing filled out nothing like no gaps or lines or anything like that  In Maggie 's tiny handwriting  laughter   It 's not even that tiny  I just hate the subject so much  I just sit here like scribbling the whole thing down you know  And it 's just everything is so repetitive  yet there are very very subtle differences in each sentence  You know what I mean  And they 're the stupid subtle things I can't remember  laughter  so it makes it pretty difficult  you know  So I did big time waffle in that exam  And in inorganic  which I thought I kind of knew  and I  3 sylls  horrible  but I can kind of consoled myself cos I got my organic results today and I got ninety  Oh my God   Brilliant  That 's just organic  everything else is just  And this is the girl  who used to  hate chemistry   Who used to fail  and used to hate it as well  I actually never passed a chemistry exam in my whole life  Oh no that was history I think  Yeah I never passed a history exam but then in the end I got an honour and  uhm  You got an honour in chemistry didn't you  No  You didn't  And here she is doing chemistry and loving it and getting these really high marks
