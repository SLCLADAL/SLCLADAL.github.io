Definitely get the jacket  That video plus is crap  What is video plus  It 's just  Tracking and stuff no  No it 's uhm  like a memory on the video  You know  when you put the video on and then you have to put on  the video what it is and you press record  In the end of recording the tape it 'll come up like a new screen and you type it in  what  the video is  And then when every time you put that video  it comes up on the screen  It 's crap   2 sylls  Aye it tells you   Oh aye I see   It comes up on the screen what it is   A pen just does the same  laughter   And it doesn't cost
