<S1A-004 Nursing home 1>  Honest to God  I think the young ones  Sure they 're flying on Monday in I think it 's Shannon  This is from Texas  This English girl  The youngest one  the dentist  she 's married to the dentist  Herself and her husband  three children and she 's six months pregnant  Oh God  And where are they going  Coming to Dublin to the mother  or  3 sylls    So oh from  Texas  For one week  Fly in on Monday and they go back on  Easter Monday   You see  the world is small for them  You know America 's a big  Three children and the eldest one 's  the the the eldest one 's five  Sure they think nothing of travelling  In the name of God  I don't know  Especially in these times  I said to the mother I said to her half  2 sylls  Och she says they they love to come home  So they do  They come home every year  sometimes twice a year  And they 're great ones for reunions and and uh trekking to the university  They can't miss it  They 're all like that  even the one that 's at university in Dublin or was  Reunions  Then even Cordelia Nadine in Banbridge  reunions out in Jordanstown  My God I must say  I don't know how they do it    4 sylls    Well the whole thing about it is  that all their family 's over here and they don't want their children to grow up  not knowing who their family is   Oh no well they 'll never  that is perfectly true  Yes  But I thought the time that we 're living in and especially with this Iraq war  And Cordelia says  well I said to them do you not think  and I Madeleine says  och mummy no  We like to come home for a few days  Well sure Lauren  I travelled on an air flight from Newark to  through Shannon to Dublin  about  two years ago  and there was a girl across the flight from me  Fortunately I was on the outside aisle that there was only two seats  in  But she was on the  Aye   Yes   On the other  aisle   In the middle aisle  you know where there 's about  five or six  Well saying that  the hostess was very kind and  God love her the hostess earned her living that day jumping up and down  Yes five seats   Aye  But those children never  Oh was she travelling  with children   She was  travelling with two  children  And we didn't leave America til nine o'clock that night  so we were travelling through the night and the children were all  several sylls   Children    3 sylls     3 sylls    Did they not sleep  No Pauline they didn't  And God I I  I agree with   3 sylls    And she was a girl  the girl got off at Shannon  She wasn't  continuing on to Dublin  Pauline she was weary  even getting   Aye aye   I was saying to uh  I said to Cordelia  what in the name of God this is a new thing flying in by Shannon  Well apparently it was the only flight they could get  And then they 'd  to take a flight from Shannon to Dublin  and this is her idea   several sylls     several sylls  Shannon to Dublin   Well generally Lauren   the flight that I come on  uh when I left America  I  wasn't to get off at Shannon  The  people that were getting  off at  Shannon would get off and we would  sit on   Aye   Aye   Off   Yeah  sit on  But when I was going out to the States  I  went down to Dublin and I got on in Dublin but yes I had to get off  in Shannon and wait for an hour until  the flight you know  But there coming across  I wasn't  off  the flight at all  Uh-huh   Oh Lord right    Aye   Well do you know that one time we had a  a table quiz up here  go back about five years  And Gemma won the first prize and it was Aer Lingus giving a flight from Belfast to Shannon  Now I remember Beezer God rest him  when I came in I said about Gemma winning and Beezer says  God that was great  to tell you the truth I said  I can never see her using it  So it was valid up to about six months  So I said to her one day I said uhm  when are you going to use that  She says  I don't know  if I 'd 've been near you that night I would 've said  don't take that first prize  Go down the line and get something else  But anyway she says  I know what I 'll do with it but she never said  She went up to Father McBurney  his sister 's living in Ennis in County  Clare  and she says Father  there 's a belated birthday present  And he said what  laughter  He said oh Gemma he says  I 'll pay you for those  No she says no problem you know  And do you know  3 sylls  afterwards  several sylls  He said  I got on at International and I sat and I thought to myself  enjoy all this for this is free  Aer Lingus  and he said  4 sylls  he sat back and read from  Belfast to Shannon   Oh good   And he hadn't   he hadn't the bother of  driving or   Correct  And he came back that way  It was a return  Uh he appreciated it  But I couldn't get over these ones but  then I forgot that they give  they can go to Shannon and then they can sit almost probably I don't know  But you know Aer Lingus is doing very badly   several sylls    Mhm  See where they 're taking the shamrock off the  tail and   I think  that 's  I think that 's awfully sad to see that  Yes  Seen that   Uh-huh  Do you not  Yeah  But I mean it 's a State airline and I think it 's an awful shame  why they have to   And why are  they changing  I don't know to be honest with you  You see Ryanair is sweeping them off their feet  And Value and all the rest of it  Now finishing  all that  Tell me  about our Anne  Don't worry about our Anne  we 'll be examining her later  Anne O'Connell  Too much competition going on   Well uhm  we went over to see  her  She can't really join in the conversation  But it 's grand to have two or three people that you can talk with and  she   Aren't youse awful good   Pauline  you need it  and  When you 're visiting anyone sick you need a second or a third one to let the conversation flow  Yes   You 're not   1 syll   in any awkward  silence  You see if you went up on your own to  and talked to Anne  Anne tries to answer you   can't make out what she 's saying  You 're   1 syll    No   Aye   I couldn't   Margaret  O'Dowd has done it  She 's frustrated because she can't make herself  understood  It doesn't work out  too well   Yes   No it 's not  fair to anybody  But is she  I wonder is she still in the same room  She is  It 's a place I don't like  Well now Anita Martin told me there a week ago that they she and Terry were over visiting  and  the nurse came til her and told her that they had found Anne  You know she 's in a room on her own  Aye    She 's got the Zimmer in front of her   And they wouldn't be in  they wouldn't be in and out all that  No  She 'd got along the corridor on the Zimmer and was standing at the outside door  And they were afraid that she was going to speed off like  So I think from that Enda has arranged these classes  Uh she was over for aromatherapy class  in Beech Hall on the Andersonstown  Road they had the uh Bobby Duffy 's  centre  Bobby knows Anne and he 's very fond of her  Yes  Andersonstown   Yes   Excuse me that was in  2 sylls  's house  The day that they bought that house that evening I was up in  several sylls   Is that right  Well do you know I was at school with one of them two of them  3 sylls  Mabel  3 sylls  and then Anita  3 sylls   Anita  several sylls   was Head Girl the year I went to Balmoral   2 sylls   And Mabel was younger than me  And Mabel married  uh  Doctor Sheehy  I remember their names  Anita used to   Aye   Aye  It 's a beautiful house   That 's right  She was his  she was his first wife  That 's  right   She  died when they were quite young  And is Doctor Sheehy married secondly then  Oh he is  I remember well  even to get her to those classes like it 's a very good thing too but it 's sad to see her truthfully and honestly  I 've only been over the once because I 've no  transport   Well Lauren  I haven't saw Anne O'Connell in about two and a half years  Last  time I ever saw her it was in the Royal in the  caring  for the elderly  Aye   Aye   Aye  And today I could  meet no-one and tell them I thought she looked wonderful  Oh I don't  You see I I would agree with  you even when I was there   Because  the girl had no interest  No  I didn't think she could follow  There was another young girl that was her godchild  there   Rachel  was there  Marie 's daughter Rachel  but saying   Yes  The day we were there  Rachel   She loves Rachel  Saying that  Anne wouldn't be enthusing about anybody visiting her  That would be my opinion because I don't think she had  any interest   Excuse me  I agree with you  That 's what  that 's what I thought when I came out  And I said to Margaret O'Dowd  Margaret  we were there  making conversation and the door opens and these three young ones came in  And do you know something it was a joy to see them coming  I thought for young ones it was lovely of them  And then  Margaret O'Dowd  that Rachel one was one of them  and two other lassies  And I said to them  you 're very good coming over  I looked at her and I said  I just said you know Anne Anne Anne has been very good to you  But I said it still is lovely to see  Yes I said I think it 's lovely to see it  Who was it   She was  She 's her grandmother   She brought her everywhere with her when she was a child  But Anne is  and like God help her  like we said to her was she happy  you know  what about the food  She goes   The whole thing about it is  she wouldn't be happy anywhere  Like she she 's not really uh  cou  she couldn't be happy anywhere in the state she 's in  I know like God help her  No Lauren  I think it 's a pity  I think Nazareth  I think Nazareth is the answer  for her   Sure  Nazareth won't take her  Sure I know they won't  But that 's that 's the type of place  But do you know where we went one Sunday afternoon  One Sunday evening  only that we were in a hurry home  you were going to get your front door knocked in  Pam Dwyer brought us up  she 's a friend of a  the Saint John of God place  up the Upper Springfield Road  Aye but sure they don't have nursing care in it  No they don't  That 's the unfortunate thing  There are rooms I   Beechmount 's the only  one  the only place that has all three  uh sections  residential care  nursing home  and EMI which is  elderly   mentally infirm   I would say    Aye    Mental infirm   she brought us up there  You never  once you go into Beechmount  no matter what happens you  you never have to move  You see that 's the thing  That 's the answer  for anybody that would be able to look after themselves that Saint John of God this place is just  it 's over a hundred pounds cheaper than Nazareth  And the rooms are ensuite  And next to their wardrobe you open you think it 's a second wardrobe and when you open it  their hand basin  their cooker  their oven and their microwave  Self-contained   So they have to cook for themselves   That 's because yes  that 's what I 'm saying if you 're able to   don't know   So it 's  something like  it 's not even the same as  3 sylls  you know cos they 've no cooking facilities  They only can make a cup of tea for themselves  And Lauren if you saw this place  Honest to God it is beautiful  But then the  3 sylls  Lauren 's about ten years old  This has only been opened within the last year
