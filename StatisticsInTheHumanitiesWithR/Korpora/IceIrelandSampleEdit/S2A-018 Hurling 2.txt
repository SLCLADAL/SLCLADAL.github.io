<S2A-018 Hurling 2>  Match underway straightaway  Interesting stat from the first half  There were only ten frees in all in spite of the fact that it was a tough first half and there were uh six of them to Galway  four to Kilkenny  The margin  at the moment a mere two points  Kilkenny the leaders  Brendan Keogh then for a revamped Galway side  and it 's showing many switches in attack once again  Ian Burke trying to take the ball up onto his stick kept away by Liam Simpson goes back there to Joe McGrath hooking up with his brother Michael  Eddie O'Connor under the dropping ball in the sunshine at Croke Park out to Liam Keogh on his wingback  2 sylls  the ball to the centre towards P J Delaney  Delaney turning at the target  firing in the shot and putting it over the bar  Looking rapier sharp early on with his second point of the game  So three between them  It 's a perfect start for Kilkenny during the second half and again there 's loads of them there the Galway forwards  When the ball was hit in towards the Kilkenny fullback line they were all over the place  Nobody inside waiting at the edge of the square to contest the ball  Joe Cooney is now at midfield alongside Pat Malone  Michael Coleman is the latest one to be tried on Pat O'Neill  That 's uh four opponents so far that O'Neill has had  And that 's wide by Brendan Keogh  Tom Helebert contesting  breaking down here to the number twelve who 's Joe Cooney  Padraig Kelly  dropped down brilliantly by Bill Hennessey  P J Delaney and Hennessey almost getting in uh one another 's way comes out from Murty Killalea to Joe Cooney  Getting a bit more freedom at midfield  Up towards Brendan Keogh  Referee 's whistle has sounded for that push there on Brendan Keogh by Liam Simpson  Galway will have the free in  Making no mistake with it  Just inside the right-hand post  A superb point now in this final for Joe Cooney  Bill Hennessey over there  that 's uh knocked away from him however  Reaches Michael Coleman  Joe McGrath walloping or Joe Cooney rather walloping it forward first time to the other Joe  Joe Rabbitte  Rabbitte getting free  Looking for a score  Kept away from danger and it 's gone wide  Good defensive play involving Pat Dwyer and Liam Simpson  I think it 's very good play here by uh Pat Dwyer  The ball 's knocked away from Joe Rabbitte and again uh knocked ball here for a wide ball by Galway  Very good defending by Kilkenny and again good at covering off like that  Michael Walsh now getting the great distance into his uh puck out  They were noticing the wind factor at half-time with the uh flags  the Artane Boys ' Band and that 's picked up there by Michael Phelan  The wind very definitely supporting the Cats in this second half  Kilkenny looking for more scores  Gerry McInerney leaves it behind  And that 's uh driven over the bar by P J by P J Delaney  P J Delaney the scorer  To be honest Ger I think Michael Phelan actually picked the ball off the ground for that ball and uh Galway got a bit unlucky there  And they got away with it  It 's back with the action  Michael Coleman being challenged by John Power back there  and coming away for it is Joe McGrath  McGrath trying to turn in for the score  Again it comes off the chest of Michael Welsh  Liam Simpson now  Making the clearance on the out as far as Liam Burke  Across towards Michael Hoppy McGrath  Must get a score here  And he does  First point of the match for Michael McGrath  Two points the difference  the flags flying proudly up on Hill Sixteen  Well here you see Liam Simpson poor clearance really by Liam Simpson and uh gathered by Liam Burke who knocks the ball across quite well and this is what Galway must do  have somebody inside waiting for those balls and Michael McGrath scores a lovely point  John Power has been switched by Kilkenny  He 's right half forward right now  Liam Welsh coming into the centre  Liam McCarthy I should say  McCarthy outside here to Adrian Ronan  Ronan on his way once again  stopped there by  Paul Cooney  Bill Hennessey picking it up  On his left-hand side looking for the score and Bill Hennessey drives it over the bar  A score by Bill Hennessey extending Kilkenny 's lead to three points  in the sixth minute of the second half  Well again great play by Adrian Ronan who uh under pressure spots a loose man outside as Bill Hennessey backing him up very well scores a lovely point  And again uh Kilkenny has switched D J Carey back out on to the half forward line  Now John I 'd say they 'd like to see him getting more involved in the game and uh get a few scores as well  He wasn't that particularly prominent in the first half  had some good moments  Michael McGrath likewise  Playing it inside towards the tall Joe Rabbitte  Looking at the post  Getting the score  A first by Joe Rabbitte  Again the margin two points  They go point for point at either end  Again very good play by Hoppy McGrath who uhm is coming very much more into the game knocks the ball across at Joe Rabbitte who scores a very good point  Michael Welsh 's huge puck out going way down field  John Power  challenged by Gerry McInerney getting it inside towards PJ Delaney  2 sylls  up inside Murty Kellegher coming back needing support  getting it from Sean Tracey  Tracey the Galway fallback  That was Liam Burke having to go in where it hurts to try and make the contact challenge Michael Phelan  and Joe Cooney trying to be clever and take that ball up into his hands didn't succeed  Instead it 's Bill Hennessey for Kilkenny  racing clear of Joe McGrath  Lovely hand pass to his right-hand side and it was read splendidly by Padraig Kelly  Magnificently away by Kelly  The game hotting up even more in this second half  We 're really looking for some excellence from two good teams  But that 's gone wide from Liam Keoghan  Pete Finnerty is about to be introduced into the Galway team  Will he come in at half back  Jarleth Coonan there the team coach getting the word of advice an instruction to the number seventeen  Pat O'Neill  Partially blocked down  Cleared out by Liam Simpson  Joe Cooney challenging for it it 's won by Michael Phelan for Kilkenny  Runs down there  Padraig Kelly  That was a great intervention a few minutes ago there  Kilkenny were being very clever  Nice play but uh Galway had read the intentions well  wouldn  I wouldn't be surprised if Galway introduced Pete Finnerty at right corner back  4 sylls  do a lot of damage and uh Paul  Paul Cooney has been struggling quite a lot there  Michael Phelan  Padraig Kelly  What a game he 's playing  Coming out  winning possession against uh his latest opponent John Power  Joe Rabbitte  at the end of this one  picking it up low  Trying to go by Liam Simpson  Looking for the score and he makes it  There 's only one point between the teams  Rabbitte has suddenly come to life  A second point by Joe Rabbitte  Well it 's great clearance again by Padraig Kelly and Joe Rabbitte is certainly posing problems now for the Kilkenny fullback  Now this is very very difficult angle  Scores a brilliant point  Joe Cooney now to contest for this one  It runs over his head  Runs on towards Liam McCarthy  Sean Tracey  Belting it out of defence  Racing across for possession there  Eddie O'Connor very nearly doing what happened to Tipperary  al  almost two Kilkenny men colliding there  Eddie O'Connor and Liam Keogh  And thankfully there was no accident  But over there right now  this looks a bit ugly  Eddie O'Connor just continued his run that time as he was challenging for that ball with his uh team mate  ran into one of the uh subs or mentors in the Galway team  Finger injury picked up by Joe McGrath of Galway  And once again the medical officer being called on there  So playing in his very first All-Ireland final the man from Kiltormer now is being marked by Willie O'Connor  The battle-scarred Brendan Keogh being marked by Liam Simpson  Galway against the wind have lifted their game somewhat in the second half  Michael Phelan  contesting in there with Joe Cooney  Phelan again  but Padraig Kelly inevitably  like a magnet the ball seems to reach him every time  That 's Tom Helebert  nice ball inside one to trouble the full back  Pat Dwyer  And he coped so well  Then having the vision to spot that Keoghan was unmarked  To the centre of the field  Pat Malone  Really played well in the first half  This is Justin Campbell now  towards Brendan Keogh  Simpson winning the race for Kilkenny  A title now which can go either way  The next ten minutes certainly look as if they will be critical ones  Helebert  This tightly-balanced All-Ireland hurling final  Brendan Keogh taking possession  looking for the equalising score played inside  It 's Eddie O'Connor is there first  Mistakes being made  but it 's uh as you 'd expect in Finals  That 's Liam Burke making a great save and Michael Welsh making amends as well  And Pat O'Neill lifts the siege  Defence has turned into attack but only momentarily as Gerry McInerney is there on the centre half back position for Galway  Not a good clearance  It reaches Bill Hennessey on his left-hand side  firing it in there  A great catch and a fine clearance for the full back Sean Tracey  Justin Campbell once again  Stick is broken  Willie O'Connor getting a half block on that one  Liam Simpson turning on his right-hand side down towards Michael Phelan  Cooney going in there  Just doing enough to keep it away from the Kilkenny men  On towards Michael McGrath  Again a good ball played inside there  Rabbitte trying to get at the end of it to trouble the   trouble the full back  Joe Rabbitte angling for a shot  and they 're level  A succession of points by Joe Rabbitte means that they 're level for the third time in the match  Fourteen points apiece  One eleven to one eleven  And again great play here by Galway and uh you see Michael Welsh here  brilliant save  and uh because the Kilkenny forwards certainly can't get into the game at this stage Ger and the Galway backs are growing in confidence all the time  Galway backs growing in confidence  Galway forwards likewise  Giving as good as they 've been getting and this the save once again from the camera that 's behind the goal  What a wonderful save that was by Michael Welsh  Shades of the dad with that save no doubt  So Willie O'Connor to take the sideline cut  Fumbled  Justin Campbell beaten for it by Michael Phelan  Runs onto Joe Cooney  There were those who said that he wouldn't do the business at midfield but he 's done it  Across towards Eddie O'Connor  A tough tight competitive All-Ireland final  and the issue very much hanging in the balance  Just as Kilkenny try to relaunch their ambitions once again through P J Delaney  And Delaney has just put it to the right and wide  Was only twenty last July  Today playing in his first All-Ireland final  It 's been a long time since we had a draw in the All-Ireland hurling final  But there 's a lot of time still left in this  I make it seventeen minutes to go  Pat O'Neill put under pressure  Broken down by Brendan Keogh picked up by Michael Coleman shouldered by Simpson  several words  And the save is made by Michael Welsh  And that was a save from Liam Burke  Well Burke might have scored against Olly 's son earlier but his dad watched the son make a fine save from point blank range  And again good play by Justin Campbell who spots a loose man across here and uh you know again good save by Michael Welsh with Joe Rabbitte coming in just knocks it off for a sixty-five  But the  so the Galway forwards are certainly getting the openings now and Kilkenny are going to have to tighten up or Kilkenny are going to have to tighten up in defence certainly because Galway are growing in confidence all over the field  And that 's gone over the bar  Joe Cooney  puts Galway  in front  Galway in front by one twelve to one eleven  Joe Cooney 's fourth point of the match  So the contest ferocious as you 'd expect in a final  Won back there again by Padraig Kelly  Knocked away from his own goal by Willie O'Connor  Willie in pursuit here  getting support from Liam Simpson against Justin Campbell  Who 's going to win the All-Ireland of nineteen ninety-three  Runs on to Brendan Keogh  Going to the right  Won't be a score  Tenth wide of the match for Galway and that is four now in the second half  Simpson across towards Eamon Morrissey now operating his right half forward against Padraig Kelly  Trying to uh somehow limit the effectiveness of the Galway number seven  And it 's another wide yet again  It 's becoming very monotonous Jimmy
