<S1A-028 Postgrad study>  wh  were you in today just asking about this  Did you both say tea  Yes  No he I had got the Forum 's money  Uh-huh  Sent me this thing to say that  I was in the top lot of the reserve list  Mhm  And a DENI form  Mhm  And I 'd to fill out the DENI form and I didn't  exactly know who to give it to  So  and there were a few other questions that I had about  cos it says in the thing that you 're registered for a Masters  Mm   Mhm  And then you want to do a  PhD  And I didn't know what  to put down  Masters it says what is the  what type of degree or what type of qualification will you be registering for  Yeah and the standard down   Mhm  And that sort of  I didn't know  whether that was   But you do  register for Masters first and then you change and register for the PhD  Yes but the funny thing is on the form  not to confuse the DENI sort of  administration  you actually put down PhD because that 's what you will be in the  future   Mm   Ultimately  doing  Yes yes   Ultimately  doing  Well not unless you 're actually  1 syll  and get knocked back  What 's he only doing the Masters now  Well he might be if they if they say he isn't good enough  Really  And does he think it mightn't be  Well he didn't get a very good impression from  do you remember a few months ago  No   he had   They have  He tried   To have a first draft in or something  No yeah the first few chapters and then that 's how they decide if you go on to the PhD or not  from  how well you 're getting on  And they didn't think it was very good and he sort of had to start from the beginning again  Oh right   How many more years has he to do  Mm  How many more years like  how much time has he left  He 's   You 'd  wonder how far wrong you could go  No it 's that 's the thing  It does seem very poor that they let them go on so far  before the first bit of criticism   Yeah yeah  yeah  And then do you know what they do  See that 's the problem with PhDs if they 're always saying you you 're not given enough supervision  Like if you 've finished your degree  you know it 's a big big difference  Yeah I think especially   Especially I think in  some of the politics I heard people complaining about  who the supervisors are  Because  it 's different than science cos you 're actually working with someone  Aren't you  Mhm   Yeah but like at the same time  2 sylls  was saying  the guy he 's doing his PhD well wants to do his PhD with  doesn't have much communication with them  And like  the two people that are doing the PhD with him at the minute  one of them has seen him for the first time after fourteen months and the other 's seen him for the first time after sixteen months  which is an awful long time  So they 're not actually doing research that  that person wants done  They 're just sort of working by themselves doing it   I think the difference with maybe sort of things like  sociology  geology you know  you know approaches to things  are pretty much  a matter of form  whereas like say with  biologi  well biochemical stuff like I mean you could take a variety of approaches to sort of  sort out things  laughter  In sociology there 's only one way to go  about it  No that 's nonsense   No no no I know this  yeah I mean that 's the point of the research  But there 's lots of  like I mean say if you were going to analyse a  a rock face I mean there 's probably only one way you can actually analyse it  Uh-huh  Whereas if you were going to make a gene  if you were going to change genes   So that so you mean  that by that that they can work better by themselves  cos they don't need so much help  Yeah  But then I 'm what I 'm saying is  people like Nathan doing politics  I mean he 's just I don't think he  his thesis 's on the UN  Now he doesn't have to do any research for that  What he 's doing   he has to do research  He doesn't do any research himself   He does that  He doesn't  produce any results himself  No  Right  He 's just  analysing  different things  like as if he was doing  a PhD in history  Yeah yeah   And it 's actually his own  personal sort of uh ability to write things up  Uh-huh but the thing is you still  the reason you need supervision is to be given direction to know what way to go and to be said ways to go about this way this way  because you   Or what  avenues you should  research  further  Mhm   Uh-huh yeah   Mhm   Anna Crowley 's is more of a scientific one so she actually has to go along do interviews and then  do her  own research  Yeah   Oh well I suppose I mean if you were going to do that conflict resolution one you would have to sort of take  There you go  Why is there a PhD in conflict resolution  No but your man who was doing research into conflict resolution like I mean I 'm sure you could do a PhD  in   Which  man was doing research in  conflict resolution   the  Serbian guy you were talking about  He wasn't doing research  He was  over here with the UN and he was in Newcastle  Wasn't it Newcastle  Yes   No he was in Birmingham and he  wasn't with the UN  laughter   Right   Right he  wasn't   He was  lecturing  Right  But he was doing  I think he was lecturing on this kind of thing and he was  doing   See  how it could uh be like Western conflict resolution  Mhm   theories  how they would  integrate  Serbian  culture   No not   Yes   Yes  Eastern European  sort of yeah   Yeah so  I mean like  I suppose you could get direction in what type  okay you would need a certain  sample of conflict resolution theories  Yes  And then you would need uhm  information on culture  Mhm  Or  I know what you mean  That 's  4 sylls   He was saying over at Dominic 's  Sorry to talk about something so much  laughter  important  Uhm no  no the guy in lives down the stairs in the flat downstairs in Angela 's house  yawn  his girlfriend 's called Dominic  There was a phonecall for her the other night  and I said that    4 sylls    Mhm Dominique  Dominic   just call her  Dominic   Dominic   Dominic is that not the masculine  But they just called her Dominic  Mhm  And I thought there was another man living downstairs  And he said no  It 's a girl now  And I said oh is that not a man 's name  And he didn't seem to think so  Well I suppose it 's sort of a very  Catholicy name isn't it  Mm  Dominic  Dominic yeah  Saint Dominic  Oh right  I don't know  Maybe Dominique is just some kind of  posh   No  but  no it 's not  No it 's  like Dominique  ique on the end you know  when  you put E on the end of something it 's  makes   feminine   Well it 's not   Yeah   Mm   But that  doesn't change it from  ic to ique   Well right enough because Dominique   No  You see it 's gonna be  Dominique  No it would  It would   Oh yeah well you do get Dominique  as well   Uh-huh  but he was saying Dominic  Yeah  Right cos you can  Dominique  would be   Mm   Dominique or Dominique could  be feminine  Dominic  well not I mean why should you not have androgynous names  I  mean I 've no objection  But he was surprised at me thinking like Dominic  was a man   You know  what I mean  It stands to reason I suppose  Dominique   Mm   Mhm mm   Well did she have a masculine voice as well  Oh I didn't hear her  That was ridiculous  You didn't see it  Oprah  No what  Tell me  tuts and whispers  Oh God it was desperate  Absolutely  desperate  laughter  There was this girl on  This girl who was  twenty-eight  And she said  she 's quite a young  voice  and uh you know  Is that what  several sylls    It was typical American rubbish  Typical   Oh   What like  What did she speak like  No she talks very high like that  Oh I see  Like that  Was it really annoying  it no it wasn't actually  It there were there were other people on who sounded a lot worse than her  And she sounded    3 sylls  the  man sounded worse to me  His voice  was so aggressive and he  just he wouldn't he just  continued interrupting the whole time  Yeah yeah   This this girl came on and she was saying    But   But I  mean that was more his personality rather than the voice  No no no no no no no wait wait til you hear  Just trying to show off as well  This was his little you know he was a real showman about it you know  But this girl was on    Wait  laughter  This girl was on saying people have criticised my voice and everything  I don't think there 's anything wrong with it  I think my voice is fine  uh but it 's supposed to be her flatmate  or her the girl that shared a room with her moved out because of her voice  Now obviously there was a lot more to the girl leaving than just her  voice  And it was really embarrassing cos you 'd this girl stood up and she had a really deep voice and she was saying oh Christy really  used to annoy me and everything  And and Oprah says oh did you leave specifically because of her voice  And she said uhm  well yeah among other things  And it was obvious then it was the other things  But  then so it went on back to this girl later on and this voice coach on  And uh she was saying I think my voice is fine  And he says no uh you could get it a lot more deeper a lot more authoritive  And she was saying well I can make my voice authoritive if I want to  And she could  speak you know more slowly and make her voice deeper  and  everything  And he was going but you can get deeper than that  You can get deeper than that  But she was saying  well it 's fine  And he was saying now say right right  And she was going right right  And he was going good  And she was going but that 's not me  That 's not my voice  And earlier on Oprah 'd been on and she 'd been uhm this girl was saying you know I like my voice  I think it 's fine  It 's me  I 'm bubbly  I 'm outgoing  Mhm   Mm   Yeah   Sure but what  but what
