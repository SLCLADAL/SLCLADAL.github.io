<S1A-094 Health>  Hello  Hi Janice  Och hiya darling  I  was just talking about you  De de deh  singing   Hi   How are you  Finally caught each other yeah  laughter   Flip  laughter   Listen I 'm so sorry  I 've been like up to my eyes running about with Dad and  the hospital and that   I assumed  I assumed you were like  I was like yeah   Yeah so like I like uh  never got a bit a  bit of peace  on Monday when I was up home or at the weekend  sorry  decided to give you a ring then  But it 's uh   Uh-huh   Uh-huh   Yeah that 's okay   How is your Dad  He 's okay  He 's okay  He 's getting out tomorrow  And  they 're going to give him he has a clot in his leg  which is  uh below the knee  He had a couple of clots before  I think it 's basically his medication  Uhm  and I think the kind of bout is double pneumonia and he had it 's really  weakened him  And well he hasn't even been in since the stroke uh which a couple of years back  So uhm he 's  in Dundonald  He 's been up in Dundonald since last uh Friday  So uh  I came up or last Thursday so I came up last Friday  and  stayed to til yesterday  And  I think Juliette might be coming over this weekend  I 'm not sure  Uh-huh   Oh   Uh-huh   Mm mhm   Mhm right   Right   Uh-huh   Uh-huh   Is she  But uh  yeah  he 's okay  He was uh  he  was a bit upset on uh  uhm  first day the Friday because he was shaking as well  The  oul side-effects of the  medication  But it 's you know it 's you know when somebody looks really really frail  and you might say he looked  grey like  and  so he was grey and he couldn't keep his hands steady you know tapping like oh God  You know but  uh but no he he he picked up  You know  he looked  really really well  He was in good spirits like  Cos at the start he didn't want to read books   didn't do  anything which is very unlike him   And  uhm  yeah then that 's   Mhm   Wha    Mhm   Uh-huh   Uh-huh   Mmm   Mm   Oh God   Uh-huh   Mhm   Mm yeah   And have they   have they got rid of the clot or what  Yeah they 're scattering it with  uh injections  Uh so uh  it 's uh they say almost back to normal now  And uhm  yeah he 's he 's but he 's he was in good form when I left you know  And I think Mum was glad Lisa and I were  up for the company  And Lisa distracts her  uhm   Yeah the drugs yeah aye   Mhm   Uh-huh yeah   Yeah  then you 're able to run her to the hospital and that as well  I guess   Well exactly  That 's why I stayed up the  practical that stuff as well you know as well as that yeah  You know so that 's all the   Yeah  Thinking that yeah  Uh-huh  And so he 's still inside then  He 's still in Dundonald yeah  He  should be getting out tomorrow  So  touch wood uhm  that 'll  that 'll all go according to plan like  you know  But uh  Yeah   Mhm   Mhm   Mhm   God he 's really had the time of it hasn't he  He 's just had a crap year you know  His health 's not the best until he goes on dialysis which   3 sylls   these recurring effects   3 sylls   cos his system 's just fucked you  know  On the minimum  And if he 's got he definitely needs dialysis quite  soon  you know you are going to pick up infection  with toxins  and in the blood  It 's  going to be inevitable you know  unfortunately  But uhm he 's got a  bearing up well  Like I mean he was fine cos uh he was out last week doing the gardening and stuff  and you know  going for walks  And he may be overdoing it a bit you  know as well so uh   Yeah   Yeah   Mm   Mm   Mm   Yeah   God shit   Mhm   Yeah  sounds  like you have the cold  I 've got  hay fever  you know   Do you   Oh no  I 'm counting pollen down you  know   Aw shit  yeah I 've  got it   I 'm streaming  with it  I 've had I 've not had it too bad yet  It 's  only really today yesterday and today my eyes were itchy  That 's all I 've had  Yeah   Yeah this is the same  It 's really hit me just coming home there  I  was fine all day  And uhm  it 's one  of those things when you don't think about it  I know it sounds stupid like  but uh   Yeah   Mhm   Yeah well  I think well maybe if you were indoors all day and then you just came out  that 's  probably why  And then the evening I think is worse  And they say  that 's  cos the pollen is settling  Yeah   Yeah   Oh definitely  cos Gary  got a blaster here so uh  So like come here then Lisa has been taken away by the baby  2 sylls   and was  screeching the place down like  I think   Oh cool   I know I phoned a wee while ago and she was howling  laughter   she was   Yeah  been howling for like two or three hours  Think she might 've  6 sylls  laughter   laughter     4 sylls   lying on the sofa  It was like a weight  You know it 's not a  3 sylls  to carry  Mike 's been playing with her  Uh the she was progressing well there but I think she was like going berserk like  No it was her first day at creche today  so   Oh  really   Oh my God   Yeah so  it 's so weird like  Uhm so I had to kind of uh leave her in for a few hours  And I leave her in tomorrow for a couple of  hours  just to get her used to it   And uhm  bring cos uh unfortunately just she 's been up in Belfast this week  She was supposed to have a whole week this week before she goes in next week but  uh  it didn't happen   I wanted rather than just leave her in on Tuesday for the full day  like  bye-bye which 'd be worse for  me  and her  obviously  Yeah so I think that 's put her out of sorts  not going well you know  But uh  heard she was okay great  She was upset for the first couple of hours  but I  hear she 's there she 's off again  baby crying  She was upset for the first couple of hours  but  uh settled in afterwards  So then when I came she was there she was uh asleep on her baby beanbag  laughter   Uh-huh   Yeah yeah uh-huh   Right   Mm   Mhm   Aye   Yeah yeah   Yeah I 'm sure it did yeah    Mhm   Och   Och the wee mite  I know she 's uh  And also as well I 'm getting really worried  Everybody keeps going on how wee she is  laughter  God  She 's not wee  She 's just very fine  but youse  were like that as well  I mean  weren't you  Yeah   Yeah yeah   Yeah no we were sort of all I don't think Juliette was  uhm cos  Mum keeps going calling her big beefy yeah  laughter  Never  never diplomatic mum  on that  front  Uh like Dad was talking about Juliette 's bum veering towards the camera which was so  laughter  like Jesus give it a rest like you know  I hope you don't say that in front of Juliette you know  She was cute  She was a cute  2 sylls  like  But uhm she 's uh  yeah  no I just keep getting paranoid cos of the baby next to her is four months and she 's just like massive compared to her  laughter   Mm   Yes   Mm   Well she 's just a fine wee thing wee delicate sort  of fine  fine-boned and everything like  Yeah   Yeah that 's what the American baby books say is you are blessed with uh what do they call it  Not like a high-maintenance child  It 's something even more euphemistic  uh  with uh uh a child who needs a lot of  laughter  love   Like it 's a screaming small baby   2 sylls   But uhm  Uh-huh   Yeah   Oh God   what 's it like being back at work  I am not back at work yet  They do   Oh  are you not  No they do the creche a week  beforehand so it 's like   Oh so it 's next week  you 're going back  Next week I go back  I 've already had a meeting uhm  an update  meeting so the place hasn't burnt down or anything   there 's just  a lot of budget cuts uhm which is to be expected  uh  And then nobody 's resigned so that 's also a good sign  But uhm  laughter  really sorry actually thinking on the bright side  laughter  But uh  cos that 's uh  that 's the the one two worst things  Uhm but no it 's  it 's going to be a bit strange being back  like you know  It 's   Mhm   Mhm   Mhm   Uh-huh   Mm so Tuesday  you go back or Monday  Tuesday  So  we 're down for Lee 's wedding this weekend  Tuesday   Oh
