<S1B-041 Clerical Habits> background music   Today on Clerical Habits I 've come to Corglass Manse outside Bailieborough in County Cavan  to the home of the Reverend Florence Taylor  Minister of First Bailieborough Coroneary  and Trinity Presbyterian Churches  Florence 's hobby  is keeping horses sound of walking   Well we 're going up now to the stable yard  It was built for me here in part of the old barn  And I 'm going to bring my mare in from the field  She 's out at grass having a little bit of a holiday at the moment  I 'll bring you into the stable  introduce her to you  How many horses do you and your son David have  We have this young mare  a brood mare  an old ex-racehorse and a couple of young stock  three year old and a yearling  So then it it is very much a family interest  Oh very much a family interest  Now this is the stable  a lovely spacious stable   so very much uh purpose-built for  you   Yes   Mhm  very much so in one end you see I 've the barn  How long have you had the interest  Oh since I was a very young child  about I suppose four or five my first  interest in horses  developed   Starting  off with a pony I suppose  No I didn't have a pony of my own  No I didn't  No pony  No pony of my own  I thought most small girls that 's what  what they wanted  laughs  Well you know I used to pray for a pony  every night for years I finished my prayers by praying for a pony  but the pony never came  We weren't a very well-off family so I 'm afraid a pony 's worth  it 'd beyond our means so I just rode on other people 's when I got the chance  Were you self-taught or  No no oh no no I wasn't  No I at the beginning I rode on other people 's but  eventually then I was trained  I was trained by Captain Jeremy Beale who was a member of the British Olympic Team  for a couple of years  I went to him and then I went to Miss Iris Kellett in Dublin for many years  and in Kill in County Kildare  So once it was in the blood it stayed there  It certainly did  Well let 's go and get this mare  or rather  I 'll let you  go and get the mare   Okay will you   Yes I 'll go   stay in because it 's raining  You stay here and I 'll bring her down to you  horse noises  There we are  Now  Are you going to introduce us Florence  Well this is Jenny  Padraig  laughter  Jenny meet Padraig  Shake a hoof   Hello Jenny   We 'll give you a little bit of carrot will we  chew that  She doesn't seem to mind strangers  no she doesn't  She was racing this mare  before I got her she raced  did a few bumpers and a couple of hurdles  so she 's got accustomed to people and being out and about  She 's a six year old little mare  She 's a bay mare  fifteen two hands high so she 's not very big but big enough for jumping  b  black mane and tail of course  She 's by a Northern-based sire  I think he 's dead now perhaps  Wren 's Hill  and out of a chasing-bred mare so she 's got a little bit of both flat and chasing blood in her  and she 's very promising as a show jumper  I thought she might 've done dressage but she 's a bit hot for the dressage a bit excitable  but good for the show jumping I think  Which of the disciplines do you prefer  My late husband was a great horseman and we used to break  in young horses and show them  You know so I love showing a horse  and I love dressage  but three-day eventing would be what we 're interested in mostly you know the dressage cross country and the show jumping  Why is that  Is it a combination of all those skills or  I think so  I I 'm not  not really highly competitive at all you know  I just enjoy working with them  And uhm  well I wouldn't like you to think I didn't try my best  I love things to be done well and properly but I 'm not going to worry if I don't win  as long as the horse goes well as long as I enjoy myself  For me that 's the main thing  What is it about being out there in the open on on horseback that that uh you find so  so enjoyable  It 's hard to say Padraig really  I think with riding  it 's just being at one with your animal  you know having an understanding with an animal and getting the animal to do what you want it to do  And it 's very exhilarating  Racing for example going at high speed on a horse is very very exhilarating  very thrilling  Now you 've spent a lot of your time down  around the Curragh which is  That 's right  One of the  I suppose  the most famous  Stop it Jenny   Yes  Parts of the world for horses and racing  it 's lovely in Kildare  My husband uh was  running a stud there for Paddy Prendergast the late Paddy Prendergast  and I used to ride out for for four years I rode out on the race horses  and that really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring and  the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding  I found it very thrilling  So at that stage you were a wife a mother of two children  And a teacher  laughs   And a teacher  and what was it then that was  within you do you think that was calling you towards the church or was that something that at that stage didn't make itself  evident   No no  that was quite dormant at that stage  totally dormant  I mean of course we were churchgoers and church supporters and so on but  entering the church had never  entered my mind  at that stage  Well Florence uh life took a dramatic turn for you  in nineteen eighty-five when when your husband was killed  very suddenly   That 's right  yes that 's right  uhm it did  Frank was killed in an accident  He was driving home from work one evening and he met an empty turf lorry  And you know how if they 're bringing a very large load of turf  they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with  steel or iron supports  so those hadn't been properly secured  and unfortunately as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car  So that was certainly very unexpected and you know quite a shock  Took me quite a while to get over that  So there you were  unexpectantly  widowed  and two children to  take care of   Mhm yes that 's right   Uh-huh that 's right   Well they were  pretty well grown up at that time  David was in his final year at the Veterinary College so  a bit worried at that time in case it might uh cause him to fail his final exams but fortunately it didn't  He got through  Sheena of course she was in the working in the Northern Bank at that time  She 'd just entered the Northern Bank so  they were both really pretty well advanced as regards both education and age  How did you set about picking up the pieces  Well it took some time  It took quite a few months actually  But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college  I 'd always wanted to  was never able to because of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say  and uhm I just decided this was the chance  I would go back to university  And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I  picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted  And what had you thought to do  Oh yes well I 'd thought of doing either French or music  And as I say I just don't know why I ended up doing theology but I did  I don't think anybody suggested it to me  I presume it was just  God 's prompting if you like but I ended up doing theology  and enjoyed it  And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become  more actively involved in the church  Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy  And uhm I enjoyed doing that  But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time  occupation as I until my final year and then people said  you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church  And then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted  well and good  And that 's just how I did it  So then what was the the next stage in your career  Well uhm I applied then  uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it  and I was  accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation  As you were thinking about the church and what might happen you must 've also had to bear in mind that uh you know you had  two children  who were growing  up  but also you had uh  your horses and you had your other outside interests and how you were going to blend all of those  Mhm   That was difficult  very difficult  I remember at one of my interviews  one of the interviewers suggesting that perhaps I might give up  my horses  And so well I sort of  I just said him I said well have you given up your hobby  He was a very keen golfer actually which of course he hadn't  s  I just said well I I certainly wouldn't dream of giving up either my horses or my dogs  They 're part of my life so  it made it made more difficult  definitely more difficult because you can't just move around the country with a couple of horses and three or four dogs very easily  How long have you been here in Bailieborough now  Just three months  exactly three months  Stop it Jenny  This horse  I think it 's hungry   It could chew my coat yes  laughter   I think she 's she 's uh  telling us something   And her just off the grass yes  I don't know what it is  laughter   So it 's I suppose it 's ideal for you  here is it   It is  Yes it is and it 's very near my own home you see which is eleven miles away  Yes it 's lovely here  Tell us something about the parish here  Well in Bailieborough we have three churches  one just in the town and two in the country  The Manse of course is also in the country  and I 've got about a hundred and thirty families to look after  Quite a number of elderly folk but also  quite a number of young folk children and young married people  This mare is  determined determined to  eat me isn't she or eat my coat  Yes quite a number of young people and children coming on so it 's very promising  for the future I think  We 've a big horse show here in Bailieborough in July and  quite a number of people roundabout interested in show jumping as such and horses  and very good relations with other you know churches in the community which is marvellous too  very very good relationships  This horse is  is hungry
