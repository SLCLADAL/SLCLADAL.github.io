<S2A-022 On the Edge 2>  You had to put an air on of everything 's fine and all and at the same time you 're waiting on a lorry coming up to the door to take your stuff away  Your head at times is ready to blow off your shoulders  but I couldn't show that  Heart scared on the telephone ringing  getting up in the morning early  watching what the postman was putting in getting rid of it before the wife got up out of bed  That 's the insanity of it you know  And thinking whatever you 're doing 's right and everybody else is wrong  I blamed everybody  my wife  you name it I blamed everybody my sisters or my brothers  it 's their fault it was the upbringing I had  But it was my fault  At the end of the day it was me that was writing the dockets it was me that doing the thieving it was me that wasn't bringing my wages home  We were a long long time married  and I can honestly say here and now I don't know why   she put up with me  She started to take severe migraine headaches which she still has to this day  And there was never any money being brought home til her  She could never depend on me for nothing  If she gave me any money to pay anything I would always gamble it away  And this was a pattern I put her through  And at the same time  she 'd the odd wee job  and only for that honestly I don't know where we 'd 've been  because I never brought any money home  I never gave her the only thing I done  was cause her heartache and trouble  I can never remember giving my wife a free week  there was always trouble  always borrowing money always stealing money  I still can't understand why my wife took it  honestly  No other woman under the sun would 've took what my wife took from me  I was in trouble  big trouble  And the longer it went on the bigger the bills got  the bigger the debts became  the more people I hurt  until I just couldn't turn round  One by one my friends caught me on  the banks definitely caught me on  the finance houses knew me  All dried up  All these channels of money seemed to be closed up  And I remember sitting at the door and I went into the house and the wife knew there was something wrong  She said what 's wrong with you  I said I 'm in trouble  She said what what do you mean you 're in trouble  Say I 'm owe an awful lot of people money  And she mustn't 've thought it was so much money that I owed a few quid here you know or there  She said who do you owe  What do you owe  And I couldn't tell her  I was afraid of her dropping  I was afraid of her passing out you know  I said I can't tell you  Said how much money do you owe  And she started to get annoyed  And I plucked courage up and look says I Maria  I 'm going to I 'm going to tell you what money 's owed here  The total sum came to about  seven thousand six hundred quid something like that there  and she couldn't believe it  She couldn't believe it and I got my marching orders  Get out  and take your gambling with you  and don't come back here  because if you go your debts go with you  because there 's no way we can pay that money  absolutely no way we can pay that money  And I remember and it was bucketing out of the heavens  really bucketing out of the heavens  And I said now where do I go now  I couldn't go to none of my friends I owed them all money  And I had no money on my own  I had uh uh  I was just left stranded nowhere to go and my pride wouldn't let me go back to the house  But I remember going to a guy 's flat in Rathcoole  I knew well  God help him he had a problem too he was an alcoholic  But I found him anyway and I found the flat  and asked him could I stay the night  I sat there and I was soaked to the skin  That 's when the whole thing started to come to a head  I realised what a muck I 'd made of my life  All my whole life was mucked up through this gambling  I couldn't even dry my clothes  We 'd no money to put in the gas thing  I got up the next morning  got out  walked all the way home again  went up and rapped the door  The wife opened it  she told me she said you 're not welcome here  get away  go away  I said look pleaded with her let me in  let me in for five minutes  And she  relented  She says it 'll be for five minutes  And I went into the house and I sat down didn't know where to turn til didn't know what to do  Prior til this I remember her sister telling me  she says Andy you know there 's a place that people can help you  But I wasn't listening til her at the time but funny enough the name stuck in my head  Gamblers Anonymous  it stuck in my head  I don't know why but it stuck there  But I kept looking at the phone  kept staring at the phone you know  and I remember going over and lifting the phone  The guy at the other end was  very attentive  listened a lot  asked me says uh  do you gamble he said  And I stopped a minute  See for a compulsive gambler to admit that this has him beat  well that was me admitting it to him  this had me beat  And I say yes I have if truthful  I have been gambling  He said you know  we are on the Stranmillis Road and he gave me the address  He says can you come up to a meeting up here  Says I I 'll go anywhere  and I meant it  I 'll go anywhere  He says you come up here on a Wednesday night at eight o'clock  He said there 's people here that 'll be able to help you  That 's if you want help  And I remember  my sister came down that night  She found out the trouble I was in  She wrote the wife a cheque for a hundred pound  to get her some messages and to get some stuff in the house you know  And we went up together  She was allowed to go on the first night but after that I had to go myself  And I remember I 'm sitting there listening  but I started to hear people that were in dire trouble  worse than me  and yet  they were getting out of their trouble  Things were starting to work out for them  They were starting to smile and I couldn't get over this you know I sees people smiling why are they laughing  And the secretary of the group meeting that night seen the state I was in and took me in til another room  to counsel me  And we got a cup of coffee  and he says calm down  He started to talk to me  And I thought it was a money problem  It 's money I owe this money money money I was always talking about money  He says it 's not money Andy  Money 's not your problem  Gambling 's your problem  Be honest he said look  if you can't be anything be honest  Tell the truth  If you want to progress tell the truth  And I told him  I says yes  I have been gambling  all my life I 've known nothing else but gambling  He said I 'm the same  And if you follow the advice we are giving you  the rest of your life can be okay  You can come round to a normal way of living  And I remember going home oh it was like somebody lifting a big burden on my back  I went home and I told my wife  I said Maria I 've found it  I know now I don't have to gamble  I don't have to  And I was  great form never gambled all that week  went to a couple of meetings that week  This thing was starting to work out  I got a wee job  carrying coal only the heaviest thing I ever carried was pound of sugar  it near murdered me  But the money I was getting  the wife was getting it  and it was going towards paying debts  That 's where all that money was going til  And I 'm feeling great  I 'm feeling great  There 's a door open  There 's a wee light at the end of that tunnel but I can make it bigger   I haven't a bet it 's coming up on ten years now from I 've been in a bookie 's shop  betting horses  or any form of gambling  From I arrested this gambling problem  my whole life could not be better  I 'm not lying awake half of the night now wondering what the postman 's going to put in my letterbox  I 'm not lying  awake at night and wondering now what the phone 's going to ring and who 's going to be demanding money  And I 'm not worrying about bringing money home now  My life has completely changed it 's as simple as that  It 's just a different man
