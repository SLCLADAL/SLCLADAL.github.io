<S2B-029 Employment>  They are uh financially comfortable  They are better off  than they ever thought they would be  They don't feel the sense of being outsiders or being alien that their parents did and their grandparents certainly did  For a lot of them they are glad to be out  and they are quite happy to pull the ladder up behind them and leave the area that they that they grew up in  And I think the middle classes and who can blame them  are pulling the duvet of the quality of their life round them  Every woman 's home is important to her  no matter what class she is  I wonder what you think as you look round here and I wonder what conclusions you 're drawing and I wonder what pigeonhole or little box you 're putting me in  reporter speaks  There are the people with money  there are the people with education  there are people with education and money  there are people with education and no money  uh there are the acquirers  there are the those who live by  the spirit alone  and there are those who are judicious a mixture of all of those  reporter speaks  Indeed it has been  Education has been the releasing of an entire generation and the nineteen forty-seven Education Act has meant that particularly the Catholic  element of society has achieved professional status  has achieved  for the first time I suppose in this century  uh the status of middle class  the professional gloss of middle class  in some cases the money of the middle class and all the aspirations that go with that  I happen to consider that 's a very good thing because it has enriched the life of the entire community narrator   A number of things have changed  First of all  there 's the official awareness of discrimination and the legislation to try to stop that  Now that has benefited professional and managerial people more than working-class Catholics  They 're aware of what they can do  They 're aware of their legal rights  And interviews for professional jobs are more precise and technical than for example taking on someone in a in a non-skilled job  But also there are new empires that have been created such as the Housing Executive  which began with a level playing-field in nineteen seventy-three  And Catholics got in on the ground floor so to speak and have developed with those new empires narrative   I think there 's a a great big lie being told there  And the Protestant work ethic was a nice way of saying that most Protestants were in jobs most Protestants in fact were in business or professions  reporter  There 's no special virtue in being a Protestant  uh as it was thought probably by the same misrepresentation that a Catholic was less likely to be as industrious as a Protestant more indolent  I mean those are in fact unfortunately  lies told about each community  I think Protestants have to accept  there 's no special virtue in being a in a a Protestant when you 're in business  there 's no special virtue in being a Catholic  except I would think that currently since there 's more first-generation Catholics in business and professions they must have what we  termed earlier  a new confidence  I think it would be right to say about Direct Rule  that it has had some very very clear benefits  And one of its strongest benefits is  that the Catholic middle class  have increasingly  accepted opportunities to participate in the business life  in the quasi-political life  I 'm talking about administration and health boards and in education boards  uhm and getting their proper place in the sun  one of the reasons for this is  that unlike in the past where you would have been described as a Castle Catholic  they do not have to work  necessarily in harmony with a Unionist administration  because the Unionists have no power  For a lot of them it 's  it 's quite suitable  Uhm it recognises the the validity of their existence  They have channels of communication  They in many cases don't need the SDLP for those channels of communication  They have other bodies like Chambers of Commerce and so on that they can use  or professional bodies which they can use to meet ministers  Uh you wouldn't be able to do that in other parts of the UK  but ministers here regularly  regularly meet individuals as parts of professional groups  reporter  Well when you say they 're on the other side of the tracks from Andersonstown that 's actually true in in graphic terms  They 've moved across the  the motorway and the railway line uh into South Belfast  For a lot of them they are glad to be out  and they are quite happy to pull the ladder up behind them and leave the area that they that they grew up in  reporter  Certainly when I was growing up in West Belfast there was a mixed community there of uhm people from different backgrounds and professions and so on  Now what happens is  there 's a sort of slamming of doors at five thirty pm every day in West Belfast as the teachers the shopkeepers the doctors the social workers all clear out of the place  and go as you say across the tracks to South Belfast or to North Belfast  so that they simply leave  They work in the place during the day but they don't put anything back into it  And there there is a lot of resentment about these people driving into the areas in the mornings and vanishing in the evening narrative   Well the church was built for three hundred people and it was built mainly for the domestic staff uh who were occupied here in the houses along the main Malone Road  The uh domestic staff who worked in those houses came I think mainly from uh Fermanagh Cavan and Monaghan  At that time three hundred would have been the maximum number in the parish  It also of course consisted of those who were in what was then called the poorhouse  possibly a hundred and fifty or two hundred residents there as well narrative   They are more Catholic than you might expect  There hasn't been the big dropping away in middle-class Catholic areas uh in Northern Ireland that there has been in Southern Ireland  because it 's been a ghetto church  It 's been a ghetto Catholicism  It 's been surrounded by a larger and hostile  religious world or so it 's always felt  Uhm conservatism has kept them from  from uh dropping away from the church  But also there 's a strong attachment to Catholicism as a badge of identity  And it 's something that people are are reluctant to to  to drop  Uh it means a lot to them  And you only have to look at attendance figures in affluent South Belfast compared to attendance figures in Republican West Belfast  They are higher I believe in South Belfast uhm  even proportionately  reporter  More affluent Catholics are as keen on sending their children to Catholic primary schools as ever they were  When it comes to secondary school they 'll they 'll send them quite happily to to Protestant schools for clearly for social and educational reasons because they believe these will be useful  useful places for their kids to go  Uhm I think that means that they they 're still they 're bringing their children up as Catholic  And I suppose that means that as many of the  their children are likely to turn out to be Catholic as  as as any comparable area narrative   Well they meet in golf clubs  Uhm they go to the same restaurants  They behave like middle-class people  I mean I think it should always be remembered that people in the north of Ireland are quite normal people  But the middle class who have more disposable income here than they would have other in other parts of the UK because of the cheap housing and cheap transport that exists here  They can go to golf clubs they can go on holidays  they meet each other they fly on the same package flights  Uhm they arrive in Majorca or in uhm Malaga or other parts  of Europe on the same flights from Aldergrove  So the surprising places they run into each other and they become friends  because they 've met each other on holidays in in in the Mediterranean  I don't think there 's any more warmth towards Protestants among  affluent Catholics among middle-class Catholics than there was among their parents  I don't think there is a unified middle class  I don't think Catholics and Protestants who live side by side on a on a pleasant middle-class street are necessarily much closer together  I don't think they talk about the difficult issues  I don't think they want to  And more and more the Catholic who moves into an affluent area is aware that the Protestants there are moving out  There 's uh the beginning of some sense among uh Catholics who move into what were mixed areas that it isn't going to be a mixed area any more and that in a sense their own success and their own upward mobility has torpedoed what they saw as the solution for them personally uhm that they would be living in a in a mixed area  There 's a  a mutual feeling of distrust there  Uhm the Catholic feels resentment  it seems to me that the Protestants are moving out  The Protestants feel resentment that the Catholics are moving in  Neither can admit  to each other certainly what their real feelings about that are  There has been a great silence among a high percentage of the Protestant middle classes  as to what they wish and feel  The Catholic  middle class if it is to speak out with a voice of courage must at the very least be matched  by those on the other side  Something as simple as the setting up  by the BBC of what was destined to be a community radio station in this area  which was funded generously  radio in background  created a wide appeal  failed to attract the number of Protestant contributors to make it identifiable as a truly cross-community entity  Why was that  I worked there in a freelance capacity  I made programmes on business I made programmes on writing I made programmes on everything from psycho-kinesis to the eleven plus  I rang every articulate person in Derry that I could think of  right across the board  How often how often did I get a polite  a genteel brush-off  I 'd prefer not to thank-you  from the very people whose input would have been so valuable  in creating a climate of change in this little pocket of the Northwest  There is something about the Protestant middle classes that does not wish  to peek over the wall in case what they see might prove too uncomfortable for them narrative   Both middle classes have heavily involved themselves in what I would call charitable and do-gooding works  because these are non-confrontational areas  with objectives that are good by any absolute standard  Uh the areas for confrontation in backing cystic fibrosis or uh or  organising new equipment for the various hospitals or any of the other charitable works uhm enable the middle classes to uhm  uh work together in non-confrontational circumstances and persuade themselves that they are engaged in valuable  community work without getting themselves in that nasty and distasteful business called politics  And insofar as they want to get involved in politics  they want to sup at it with an extraordinarily long and very antiseptic spoon
