<S1A-097 Sisters 2>  Yeah and the night that this 'd happened he had brought  one of the fellas back to stay in Mike 's house  And Mike was saying oh yeah  I 'd like to have these parents coming down to me and all this kind of  thing you know  And you know the guards  and I mean him going out and buying it  He 'd be stupid enough to get  caught  So he was not at all amused  so I was glad of that   Mm    Mm mm   Yeah yeah  and who said that he wouldn't  he wouldn't mind  Jennie said she  well she wasn't saying  that you know to make trouble  she just thought he wouldn't   Yeah yeah  Oh wouldn't she just thought I  would 've thought  I would 've thought  he would 've been concerned   Yeah it 's  a different kind of scene to the  the drink you know  And I don't think he   Yeah yeah  it is really  Yeah  I mean it 's too dangerous when you look at the likes of Bobby Nelson  It is  Oh it 's absolutely frightening absolutely    2 sylls  life  You know  and it 's starting he started on cough bottles kind of  you know   Yeah  at fourteen it 's just  not on  Not on  So anyway but he was like a devil yesterday  Then he announced yesterday he said I 'm going into town to get my ear pierced  And I said you are in your bum going into town to get your ear pierced  Where are you going  And he said oh this place in Nemo 's Arcade  And I said you have to go somewhere hygienic or you 'll get AIDS or something   And Ben   Too young yeah yeah   Mm  would  he not be afraid of that  And Ben said something and he  and he turned round and said I wasn't speaking to  you  in this tone  And I said get up that stairs to your room  I really wanted to thump him  really viciously  I wasn't speaking to  you  So I said get up that stairs  So after a while he called Ben out and said I 'm sorry  It 's just blah blah blah  So anyway  I said   Oh Lord   Yeah yeah   Yeah yeah   Well at  least he did that  Yeah anyway I said uhm  but it 's kind of getting to the point where I 'll say that and he 's going to say no  and then you 'll think what the hell do you do then  I mean he 's really getting quite aggressive you know  quite nasty  at times you know  And kind of  I 'm bigger than you and this kind of thing  So anyway I  then he wanted to talk to me so I came out to the bottom of the stairs and he said he was sorry and all that  And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but  you know you have to be careful and that  So in  the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done  So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as  bedamned you little  shite  laughter  I hope  it 's real sore   Yeah  yeah what do you do then yeah   Yeah yeah yeah  yeah yeah   Mm   Mm mm   And  just one is it  Oh just one  Oh yes of course and the left  If it 's the right one you 're gay  Oh I see  And boy would he not like to be  taken for a gay   Oh I thought  it was only uh that it didn't matter which one  If it was one you were gay  No no the right  one is gay   I see  I see  But real aggressive  Then this morning he and then he starts saying to me uhm will you give me the bus fare tomorrow to go into town  Now he had thirty-five pounds and he had coughed up five on the dope  And I thought I 'd like my frigging job  sweetie giving you your twenty-five  And I said no you can use your own money  And then he marched into   Yeah yeah   Yeah that was for  today was  Oh   Yeah then he  marched into me today saying can I have my pocket money  Like he gets  I think  I forget now I think it 's two pounds  I 'm   I 'm all mixed up with Christmas  And I said no  you 've enough money   really thought you know the cheek  I mean I 'm hardly going to finance anything else  But uhm  he just  got up this morning and he 's permanently wants to have baths  Now when you turn on the water for a bath the radiators have to go off and everyone is fucking freezing   mean you you kind of have to pick your  time  And I said no  I said no you can't have one  It 's too cold  No it isn't cold  It 's not a bit cold   Re   Mm   Mm   Yeah yeah yeah yeah   Yeah yeah   Mm   Mm it is bloody freezing   I was just reading in the paper they 're saying there 's snow coming  I 've kind of believe it  it just  feels like that tonight  Even though the sky is very clear  it just has that really cold feeling   Yeah yeah   Yeah does really   Bitter  But anyway he was just the face of him now would just stop a clock you  know cos he can't have his bath  Like he 's in there every  at least every second day  you know  Oh anyway   Yeah yeah   Yeah yeah yeah  It 's  a bit much alright  It is a bit much  And and  I  certainly would worry about you know  he 's bad enough as he is and he 's going into a phase that will be so difficult with him going out and  that kind of thing  I dread it you know  I really dread it  kind of going  out and vanishing and  hanging  round in gangs and this kind of thing  he was kind of slow to do it but it has happened  now very  very abruptly you know   Yeah   I know I know I know   Yeah yeah   Yeah   I know yeah  suddenly yeah yeah  If he was only kind of really into the study  or that   Oh  not a hope I mean to  kind of hang onto him to do the  He is  To hang onto him to do the Junior Cert and then kind of  at least til he gets over that reasonably you know  It would be some job you know  Yeah  He is bright   Yeah yeah or he might even go on to the Leaving Cert  Oh he 's certainly  I mean go on to do it  Sure he 'll only be fifteen in July when he 'll certainly  but just kind of  even if he kind of went off the rails a bit then and got back  before the Leaving like  There 's after the Junior Cert there 's this uhm  transition year where  they  just kind of do enjoyable things   Mm oh right yeah   Yeah yeah yeah   Yeah yeah  yeah they can go into jobs  and that and get experience   Yeah yeah  but uhm  i  it 's just a whole phase  I 'm not looking forward to you know  I really dread it  you know   I know  I know  Yeah yeah  and probably boys are that bit much more  difficult   Yeah  yeah and more aggressive you  know very aggressive now  You know   Yeah yeah yeah yeah   God doesn't seem any  length since he was a small child sitting on my knee  I know I know  God  he wouldn't sit on it now I 'll tell you  laughter  Look crooked at him he 'd accuse you of being a perv  laughter   Yeah   Oh Lord  it 's the worst really  the worst phase from  when  they kind of start that til when they 're about  eighteen you know   Yeah   Yeah  yeah until you kind of feel  they have to be a bit responsible for themselves   You kind of feel  yeah that really there isn't much more you can  do after that you know  But it 's really   Yeah yeah  but at least he 's staying there tonight now  Is he  Yeah yeah  He is here   does  he want to go to the disco again  Uh no no he 's said he said he wanted to stay there tonight which I  uh stay here  tonight  He 's just gone up to Mike now for a while  but  I was pleased with that you  know  He went last weekend so  I  mean that 'll be it really maybe  maybe once or twice more now before the exam you know  Mm mm   Mm   Yeah   Mm   Yeah yeah  And how 's Sharon  Grand grand  I mean at a  a much easier  phase you know   Mm mm  She 'd probably be easier anyway  I 'd say she would yeah  I 'd say she would I mean   Yeah   She 'd be more into the books and that  She would yeah  I 'd  I mean you never know kind of  They all have their moods and that   Mm   No you don't  I suppose yeah  But no I mean he 's always been sort of difficult  and  cheeky and that  But this kind of  look now that really makes you just boil  laughter  with rage you know  Really kind of trying it out you  know  And I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know  do something or go upstairs or do you know  and he 's going to say  And then what do you do   that  you kind of avoid that because once he realises he can say no and get away with it you 've had it  you know   Yeah yeah   Yeah yeah yeah   Mm   And he 's gonna say no   Yeah   Yeah yeah   What do you do  really   What do  you do  You know   Yeah  ingressive airstream  ingressive airstream   sigh  and I mean uh you see with the others too the whole dope thing is so acceptable  He has seen so much of this you  know  kind of it 's  it 's so much part of life  And Ben was saying he just does not want Sharon getting that  picture you know just  Yeah yeah  he just doesn't want her to kind of view this as sort of  something   Yeah yeah   Yeah I can understand that totally yeah yeah   Yeah as  norm  Yeah yeah  I agree completely   mean I  had no control really over the others  and  I think luckily that Mike has kind of changed his tune to some extent  Yeah   Yeah yeah   He seems to have  How is he   Yeah but he  seems to be fine  Does he  yeah  I rang uhm  the Frankie O'Dea 's boyfriend I think a second night  I don't think I was telling you  and he said she was going to have her sinuses cleared out  Seems to be grand yeah   Oh right   Which is a fairly big thing I  think  and it can be very painful  Ugh   Sounds horrible  yeah   Yeah   I I remember actually when I was in the hospital a woman in the next bed having it and she looked absolutely wretched  I was thinking  I didn't say that to him  Yeah   But I 'm sure it 'll  be good when it 's done   But it probably will  help yeah  So she must be still in or I imagine she 'd have given a call you know  that  So  it might be the beginning of a a kind of a  a change for  her you know   Yeah yeah   It might   Yeah yeah   So I don't think there 's any other news really no  As I said I 'm eating too much  My waistline has gone completely  laughter   I 'm just a lump   Who cares  laughter  Who cares anymore  I don't give a  shite  Well I don't like to be baggy kind of  you know  Not for the sake of appearance but I feel  uncomfortable   no but   Well yeah  when it gets to where  it doesn't feel   When  skirts feel tight and that  You feel well  maybe now for the New Year  I mean that Unislim did marvels for me  you know  The discipline of it   Yeah   Yeah yeah  And also  I mean in the cold everybody eats more  You have to   Well they do  And we 're going out  Ar  Arthur 's great for kind of saying we 'll go for a walk  Cos if it was left to me I 'd stew here  I have six videos from Glen  of some oldies  you know  Yeah yeah
