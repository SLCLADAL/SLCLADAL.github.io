was like  w  had certain jobs and  I can remember the dishes and the hoovering  Those two things Grainne and myself used to have to do  And when we had the TV in the kitchen  Grainne used to always get to do the dishes and like I hated doing the dishes  I hated doing the hoovering too  but at least while she was doing the dishes she could watch TV  But they do them   Yeah  Whereas if I was doing the hoovering like I was all over the house  3 sylls  And  oh I hated it  Well Ryan has to do the hoovering  Ivor has to take out the ashes and put on the fire    There 's the phone   4 sylls

have had  like parent  to teacher sort of where they can talk privately  in Dean 's   Why do they not    Not in the school Dean is in  because  I don't know why  They had one before and  nobody really turned up at it  And uhm  this time it was the parents got on to the teachers because they wanted a private teacher  meeting  In Dean 's school where the parents could talk individually to the teachers   beforehand  like the teachers 'd come in the parents 'd come in but they wouldn't get a chance to talk individually  It was like a group meeting sort of thing  Because   What 's this
