<S2B-025 Frontline 2>  He died a short time later in the hospital  Uhm this happened at quarter past nine  everyone in the family except for me oldest daughter was in the house at the time  Luckily for  for for us Sean was the only one was in the living-room because by by the devastation  we we seen caused by the bullets there was up to sixty armour-piercing rounds fired  anyone that was in the living-room that  that evening uh would 've been killed  In November Bobby Lavery 's home was shot up again  Another son crouched in terror as bullets peppered the shutters  This family lives in darkness and in danger  determined not to move  Bobby has been shaken by the grief  Emotionally  I have been destroyed  And from time to time  you feel like you just want to walk away  You really do  It 's just too much  too much  Mentally the  the pressure was uh can be excruciating at times  Then when you think of all the suffering that everybody 's going through  th  I don't think there 's anybody in the in the Six Counties  who hasn't been affected in some fashion or other  Hundreds of Republican families live on their nerves like this  but they don't ask the IRA to ease up  Why not  Do they think the struggle is really worth it  Or do they think that the IRA wouldn't listen  Well in some places they do   Derry was the second city of the Troubles  Like Crossmaglen it has a Catholic majority but now it suffers only one in fifty of the violent deaths here   There is a sense that old grievances have been settled  Catholics run the town  sharing power in Council with Unionists   Yet once the IRA had the free run of this city  choir music  Father Michael Collins is Parish Priest of the Long Tower Church over the Catholic Bogside  He knows what demotivates people here  and he has seen the change over the years  He remembers the ardent old Republican  who was once enraged by a call in his church for prayers for a dead soldier  He came up into the pulpit  took over the microphone uh and addressed the congregation  very forthrightly on uh  his Republican beliefs  see him outside  the church there on a Sunday morning now twenty-five years later and uh  he 's had a stroke  He 's had uh  bad health for the past while  it is hard to identify  those two  images in one 's mind  a man whose  health is declining and a man who was so full of enthusiasm  uh on that particular morning  But that is  I think symptomatic of everybody  We have all  lived with uh the Troubles for the past twenty-five years  so I think there must be  a certain war-weariness  creeping in and that doesn't just apply to us  It applies to the Provisional IRA and to Sinn Fe/in and to all the Republican movement as well ex-corpus speaker Ð John Major, British Prime Minister   Some Republicans now feel the need of a quieter life and a safer life for themselves and their children  Surely then a compromise like the Joint Declaration should appeal to them   The Declaration assures Nationalists of the right to self-determination for the Irish people as a whole  It says that Britain has no selfish interest in Northern Ireland  but only wants peace here  But if the British really have no interests here why don't they just say they 're getting out  That 's the Republican argument  Republicans may also feel from their own secret contacts with the British  that there 's more to be gained if they just give it another push  The Downing Street Declaration is an elegant document  but does that diplomatic language promise more than is really on offer  I think one of the problems with the the Declaration  is that from the British point of view it addresses the issue  which is significant and welcome  but then it appears to say  you have the right to self-determination but  and goes on to qualify it  My view is you can't have half of a right  or a third of a right  you either have the right  We of course have that right  that 's denied us  by by by uh external impediment  by British interference  How we exercise that right  without internal or external  impediment is just a matter of  common sense  Adams makes it all sound very easy  but that external impediment is the same old promise that while Unionists are in the majority they are safe  For Republicans that means that nothing has changed   The Declaration assures Unionists  that the government will work for agreement without pre-judging or prescribing the result  and that only majority consent in the North can ever bring about a united Ireland  Now that 's fine as far as it goes  but that right of the majority in the North to hold up a united Ireland  was a tripwire for Republicans what they call a Unionist veto  What was different about the document that Gerry Adams signed with John Hume was that it contained the idea of a timeframe  effectively a deadline on the Unionists  to come to agreement  Now that implies a big stick  And a big stick a penalty for not agreeing whatever that was to be  would compel Unionists to compromise  to relax their insistence that Ulster is as British as Birmingham or Finchley  I think without being patronising  you know the Unionists have an understandable and very severe  uh identity crisis  And I and I think  that an an Ireland which we build  has to reflect  the Unionist strand  of our history  So long as it isn't British like  I mean what they would say is there are two nationalities on the island of Ireland  Whereas you know that isn't the case yourself  I don't know that  Well I 'm representing  what they might say   Well I mean  I know but  everybody knows that isn't the case  You can't actually I  I mean you  we don't have two nationalities  We have a  politica  a difference of political allegiance  Those who would have a general notion  of allegiance to Ireland  and those who would have a notion of allegiance towards the union  pipe band   Whatever Gerry Adams thinks about the right of Protestants to imagine themselves to be British  Protestants themselves have little trust  that he understands them at all   Republicans will have to deal with working-class Protestants  but they are clearly in no mood to yield  British  We 've always been British and we always want to be British  They say they want all-Ireland  but they can't be an all-Ireland because the majority of the people in the North  want to stay British  Uh if they don't want to be British  there 's a big there 's twenty-six states down the South for them  Just get out  Well if they don't want to  live under our rule  Now at the end of the day it 's  you say we go back til the majority rules  and until the day  where the vote comes  that they want to make this an all-Ireland  it 's still our country  We own it  That 's it  I 've said that before  If I was a Republican and I didn't  I wanted to be a Republican and they didn't want me to be  I 'd go down the South and be a Republican   Do they not think themselves though that to get out of this deadlock that they have to adapt a bit to the Republican version of what the problem is  and to accept that their leaders will one day have to sit down and talk to Sinn Fe/in  The Provisional IRA 'd have to  not ceasefire not a couple of days they 'd have to say right that 's it  The terrorism 's over  We 're at the table  And that 's it  That 's how they 'd do it  That 's the only way to do it  But you can't come to the table  as in speaking to people at the table and meanwhile somebody 's out putting a car bomb under their motor like  You can't do that  That 's not  it 's not ethical like is it  If the fears of Protestants are so strong  and if even the IRA accept that there can be no settlement unless they agree to it  why doesn't the IRA lift the pressure on them and give them a chance  If Republicans are serious  couldn't more be achieved by a ceasefire  Two British Secretaries of State have negotiated ceasefires with the IRA  William Whitelaw in nineteen seventy-two  and Merlyn Reece in seventy-five  The IRA feel that both were tricks  and they 'll say that 's why they 're wary of calling another   Now that sounds like a handy excuse  but they have other reasons too  There 's one man who should be able to throw some light on this  He 's been a Republican for over forty years  He 's been a member of the Army Council of the IRA  and he 's been a Director of Operations for the IRA  In the seventies he was President of Sinn Fe/in  and he negotiated truce with the British Government   Ruairi/ O/ Bra/daigh leads the Republican Sinn Fe/in  a separate party sidelined by Gerry Adams  who see themselves as the last true Republicans  He tested the will of the British  face-to-face  It was a very rocky uhm progress  First of all the British Government weren't prepared to deliver  on the main issue  They told us of course that uh  British Ministers individually were in favour of getting out of Ireland and we know that the British Cabinet Committee on Ireland had considered the options of British withdrawal  They told us that British ministers individually were in favour of this  but we said uh  what we wanted was a collective decision  and that permanent peace  would be available in return  for this decision of the British government  When it became finally clear that indeed the British were not going to deliver  well then uh the IRA responded with a series of operations  in September  There was a very  sore lesson learned for a great number of years after that  No truces or ceasefires appear to have been considered at all  Ceasefires are dangerous  Volunteers lose their resolve  gun shots  but they are hyped up for war and have nothing to do  The organisation slackens and is vulnerable to spies  Without major concessions the risk isn't worth it  Of course that determination has mellowed a little  The IRA called a ceasefire in April for three days  It wasn't much  The fact is they 're still intensely suspicious of the British  They feel they were conned before  They don't want to be conned again  And some of their closest political allies are telling them that the Downing Street Declaration is a lure without substance speaker in Irish   Bernadette McAliskey as she is rarely heard  in an Irish-language cafe on the Falls Road  Irish speakers  Her commitment to political struggle and her colourful past  make her a popular figure here  She has been working outside the Republican movement  but for the same goals   She 's tough  After the Bloody Sunday killings in Derry as a young MP  in the House of Commons she thumped the Home Secretary Reginald Maudling  clip from nineteen-sixties  Do you intend to apologise to Mr Maudling or   I 'm just sorry I didn't get him by the throat  Well said  The Downing Street Declaration does not provide uh even a hint of a mechanism  which would allow political differences to be discussed or resolved  it 's hard to see what Republicans  were even being asked to settle for other than what the document spelt out  And the Downing Street Declaration to me clearly spelt out  a commitment by the Irish and British Government to continue with Six County solution  and uh to recreate the political structure within it
