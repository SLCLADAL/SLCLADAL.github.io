<S1A-006 Girls' chat 1>  So girls would you like a glass of wine  I 'd love a wee glass of wine  Thanks very much  No I 'll have  whatever  Do you know what I did today  What  Now now this is really really scares him  I was about to make bloody dessert  What simultaneous and unclear speech   I was about to make the bloody dessert and took out the bar of chocolate to make it with which I thought was two hundred and fifty grams  Now we 're talking a big bar of chocolate  here  I actually didn't even check it  I just thought  well I mean  there 's  not going to be any more chocolate in it than that  Yeah   Yeah   But how could you not have checked it  I mean how could could you have thought that you you knew what  I don't know  I mean it was just a   several sylls  yeah yeah   I can understand that  You take that bar and you think you 'd be very used to looking at it  and you just imagine that two hundred and fifty grams is probably like a half of it or  something  as opposed  to you know   Yeah   Yeah    several sylls    You know one of the big bars of chocolate out of Marks  And I thought  Not cooking  No no but it it it 's said to be quality dark  chocolate   Yeah   Oh sorry  Well I thought well there 's not going to be  several sylls  one of those big  I mean  there 's not going to be any more chocolate in it than  that  So of course took it out to do the recipe and looked at the recipe and it said two hundred and fifty grams and it was only one hundred and fifty grams  So  I had to run down to Iceland which all sounds very well but it actually takes twelve minutes to get there and twelve minutes to get back again  And when you 're on a very very bloody  tight schedule   Yeah   Mhm   Oh   Tight schedule   laughter   Twenty-four minutes later I was forty-five minutes over   What what time  what time did you  what time did you have everybody over at  Three o'clock  She told  us three   And by the time  you got went to Mass  was that two  Well I 've been up from nine  o 'clock  uhm and went to half ten  Mass  and then I walked  I walked well ended up walking back from Mass  Oh right   Uh-huh    Well that was  Uh-huh  Really silly  No buses  And I  phoned every taxi company that I 've ever  known of  And they they 'd they 'd all let you go through the spiel  of hello could I have a taxi for this  No but but they let you go through the whole spiel and then they say sorry love we 're fully booked  Why  several sylls    Yeah    several sylls    Why were they booked on a Sunday at half ten  Apparently it 's  Mother 's Day   Oh it 's Mother 's Day  Yeah  I suppose  people are going out and  Oh right   so that was fine but I 'd already bloody well walked for fifty-five minutes to an hour so I wasn't really best pleased at having to walk down again and then back up again  4 sylls  And I was on a very tight  schedule at this stage   Could you not just have  stayed smaller  you know reduced everything a bit  Uh well by half   I didn't know  whether Simultaneous and unclear speech   So then of course Seamus arrived over at a quarter past two  And I opened the door and I was like do you know you 're really early  Lovely yeah  And he said yeah  I said that 's okay as long as you know cos I haven't hoovered or anything yet  So he came in and that was grand  And uhm  why did I start to tell you this  I thought you   several sylls   You were asking about wine  and I said you asked me what  did I want wine or something like that  Making this story up as usual   Yeah well so when I went down to Iceland  laughter  I then thought I 'll buy a big bottle of blackberry and raspberry water for Mary because she 's pregnant  laughter  It occurred to me ten minutes ago  that actually  she had Charles you know  ten months ago now  I mean that 's why I bought it  for pregnant Mary  Are you serious   Oh my God that 's    laughter   laughter  That 's absolutely hilarious  Not for Jessie who might be driving  No no no for pregnant Mary  No I actually think that 's a bit scary simultaneous and unclear speech   But it 's funny the way you can like remember things from you know  the way  it just sticks in you head like that  You just obviously you associate her with being  Uh-huh   Aye with being pregnant  Pregnant or not drinking or something you know  It I mean it only occurred to me cos then I was thinking uh  about five minutes ago I was thinking oh right okay well Mary 's coming round and I wonder what time Charles 'll go to bed at and that  And then I thought yes because she 's had the baby now   seriously concerned now   That 's hilarious  Och your house is just so gorgeous now  You must be just so happy here  It 's really lovely  Och I am  I mean I do I really like it now I must say  Och it 's really really beautiful unclear speech   Well to be honest I think it 's fine  You know it 's not  Greg absolutely loves that clock  Cos it 's not  I think that those uhm  it 's fine you know it 's not about it it 's not what you would choose  yourself  but at the same time it 's not that it absolutely stands out  Yeah   But I don't think that it 's in keeping with  the rest of  the room  Serious   It 's what you find in like a great-auntie 's house or something like  I I laughed the other day girls  Aunt Janice came to get the delivery of this sofa and I came back in again and this  was like this  and this  was like this  Oh really  And everything was angled  laughter  She had gone round the house and angled everything  Oh my God  And I was  2 sylls  cos I have to  I mean like that would drive me mad because it 's actually not quite  Straight  It 's not quite straight  It 's not like I 'm Little Miss Tidy or anything but I don't like things angled  And she 'd gone round and she 'd re-arranged the bottles in the bathroom  And she 'd angled  she 'd angled  something in the kitchen and  and you get uhm you see uhm uh something was angled in the kitchen  you know tonight after she 'd left  Oh just re-arranged like where they where they were like just where they were sitting  She  wanted them more central  Are you serious  Oh my God that 's she just did   What do you mean re-arranged the bottles   Oh right   Mhm  I mean I had two of them sort of over to the side and she wanted them more central than that so I had to go back round the house de-angling  them  It was just it was so funny   Oh that 's hilarious  That 's so funny  And she obviously thought she was like with the delivery people as well because she was afraid of them marking your wall  No but that was great  because   I know  That 's what I 'm saying  You know if Rowena had been here  not that I mean no harm to Rowena but she probably would have been a bit like me it wouldn't have occurred to her probably  Yeah cos it wouldn't actually occur to you I think   4 sylls    No well  it would occur to me now after because the last time  when they brought in the first sofa they actually did scrape it along the  wall  And I can see where the scrape  it isn't it it 's it 's marked the paint but  it 's not  Oh right   Yeah has marked the paint  yeah yeah   Yeah it just has yeah  Mary-Louise that 's an absolutely gorgeous photograph of you two  Absolutely beautiful  I like that one  It 's beautiful of both of you  Whose wedding was that at  I think that was at Colin and Susan 's wedding  Yeah cos you were you were wearing that outfit  Yeah simultaneous and unclear speech   Here I think this is really weird  Was I telling somebody this last night in the pub  Tom O'Donnell was on the phone the other day  and he said  I think this is really weird  I got an invitation to Gene White 's  wedding   Yes you were telling me   Tom  did  Tom O'Donnell did  That was so weird  simultaneous and unclear speech  No I said actually no we didn't  the truth we 're going to be away not that Gene would have known that because you could send somebody an invitation and simultaneous and unclear speech   On the other hand we you know we didn't invite Gene to our wedding and there 's a little bit of that as well  You know there is that bit of you 're not invited to somebody 's wedding you don't invite them to yours you know  No but I think there 's a bit of  there 's a bit more of that than you might  expect actually  And that 's and that 's I mean truly honest to God   4 sylls   after all we didn't invite him and we would have been in Australia anyway  But I thought that was really weird actually that out of the blue  they  suddenly invited Tom O'Donnell  Well maybe yeah   You were going to Australia   Yeah   And is Tom going  What I think 's weird about that  I think so yeah  What I think 's weird about that is that okay he invited Tom which is a bit strange  but Tom was on the stag  but so was Roger  Yeah  Yeah  You know I find that odd   so do I   Did he   unless the invitation  it was before the stag was it  Uhm so Gene might have heard on the stag simultaneous and unclear speech   But Tom Tom was Tom not absolutely amazed to be invited on the stag  Yeah he was   I think I think  he was pretty amazed  But uhm I think that a lot of Tom I mean I think a lot of the reason Roger was invited on the stag was probably cos he knew Dublin as well  I mean  I think that was a large part of it  I think Tom was invited because just for  Yeah   Mhm   Apparently he was in the Morning Star on Christmas Eve  Probably  so they were all chatting about it and Tom and as I say Roger and Donall and you know  But I think that that 's really weird  Isn't it  But they should have a lovely day  Having said that I 'm sure it 'll be a really great day now  Easter Monday is a nice day to book for a wedding you know  Och it 's a pity you 're not  I know it is a pity actually  I would like to be there  Was that your door or was that the settee  See if my settee was making those  kind of noises it 'd be going back  Well unless maybe you have an invitation and it just hasn't arrived  simultaneous and unclear speech   Doreen do you have that shirt in pink  Uh yeah  actually  it 's my mum 's shirt  I bought  it for her uhm and I just thought I 'd wear it  It 's beautiful   It 's absolutely gorgeous   It 's lovely  Uhm unless maybe they have and it just haven't arrived  I don't I don't think so  I don't actually think because he probably  Uhm really I 'm only saying this to you and obviously I 'm not offended or anything  I just thought it was odd simultaneous and unclear speech   We then came home and spent  I went up to bed  and he spent about an hour on the internet trying to book a holiday or something just so that he could kind of say the next day you know  laughter  Then he set his alarm for half six  cos he was going to get up  and go out but his alarm woke Charles  Oh Jesus   Oh no  Oh no  So then he was up  So then he couldn't  you  know he couldn't sort of leave so it was a disaster  Yeah   Disaster  But he cos I cos when he said last night then I was saying I was thinking och no maybe he has something organised cos he was saying aw you know  I knew he didn't but  All in hand girls all in  I I can sort of understand because I kept forgetting  myself that  it was anything to do with me you know  Yeah yeah  unclear speech   were off with your mum and dad and everything today were you  Yes we were up  uhm we went to the Drumnagrey  Oh right unclear speech   Lovely  Was it nice  You may tell Mary Una  You 're on a tape recorder  Mary  but ignore it  Oh right   Just ignore it  Okay Sarah okay laughter   So you you have to sign a contract to say you don't mind your voice  laughter   It 's only sentence construction that I 'll be looking at if the  several sylls   Here you 'll be spotting all our grammatical mistakes  Una 's sending the tape off to MI Five  It 's purely descriptive  You describe how  people speak  And there 's  none of  this you should say this  Oh right   Right   Okay  Here Mary would you like a glass of wine or would you like a cup of tea or  Well seeing as you 're pregnant  laughter   Or would you like a glass of special water  Give her a glass of wine  several sylls   I think I 'll just have a wee small glass  So a small glass of wine and so you want a glass of wine and you want a glass of wine unclear speech   We were out last night  w  we went out with mum and dad uhm sort of taking her out for dinner and then actually we went to the Chelsea  So probably you had obviously gone home and then uhm we met up with uh uh Una and Mary-Louise and Ger and Roger and Lucy  Mummy and daddy were there as well  I mean it was fine  Like the last thing I needed was probably to have another two gin and tonics
