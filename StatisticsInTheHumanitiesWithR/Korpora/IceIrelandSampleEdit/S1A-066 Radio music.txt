without you      Happy now living without you    I mean like it 's grand but at three o'clock in the day you don't need it  No actually it was five o'clock so I put on Bob Marley  laughter   I don't think they appreciated it cos they turned up theirs up louder which wasn't very helpful really  They 're not nice boys  I was thinking they could get a cable in the hole in our window  A hole in what window  There 's a crack in the window  There 's a little  hole   They 're not  putting any cable in through my window  laughter  I 'll break their faces first  I would seriously  You violent little person  Did nobody hear the burglar alarm last night at half past twelve  No  No  Even a little squeak when people turn over in bed  No  I heard you coming back from her room  What time was that at  I didn't come back from her I was not in her bed  laughter  Oh yeah yeah  She stayed there all night  Excuse me Felicia  laughter   She just said she  I didn't come back from her

you were awake  That 's because I was telling Deirdre to shh because I thought she was coming around to wake me  There 's no logic in that Laoise  That isn't   I don't  believe that waiting for her to come to wake me  laughter   I thought it might have been really early I said to wake me whenyou 're going  That 's a cop-out Laoise  It 's not a cop-out  Hm hm  I wasn't   Seeing  as you stayed in bed later than even me  I know  What time did you stay in bed til  About eight  You mean I was in Read 's by the time you were up  You were out of Read 's by the time I was out of my
