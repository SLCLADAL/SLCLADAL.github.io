so   Last week  was that was  Last Friday yeah  That was one of the nights  Which was when was the beginning  Oh the beginning was I 'll tell you when the beginning was way way back  When was it  I can't even hardly remember  Was it the night that I left Annabelle 's uhm   It was the  one of the nights  what was it Mark was out  That was one of the nights  Now the very first one was  The night I went into and met you  And uhm  No that was  I I had been before  that I   met up  with him and stuff uhm  hmm hmm   hmm   When was  that    can't I can't now think right now  I 'll tell  you some other time   Ah he 's very nice   He 's a real pet so he is  Absolute  I really do  like  I must  admit  but I 'm  mad  about Ciaran as well  yeah   yeah   yeah   yeah   So I 'm in a total predicament  I really don't know what to do  He knows about Ciaran  Ciaran doesn't know about him  Dilemma  Dilemma completely  Yeah  And so uhm he was like he 's been I 've been meeting him like all week  me  met him all last week  I 'd say we 've been uh like meeting and he 'd be we we 'd be drinking coffee and whatever you know  Yeah  And uh what else then uhm  then   Well I uhm uhm I  knew I had  you  sussed  Knew it  But uhm I wasn't sure at the same time like  You know  the way  Yeah mm mm   Yeah  oh I know  No I mean I 've been always good friends with with uhm  with Jim right  And even like last Christmas he brought me a present and stuff you  know  for Christmas and I didn't expect anything  and then he did  And then after that we were still always were good friends and we 'd go out and  stuff  And then  when was it just I 'd say it was about uhm it was even about two months ago I 'd say that was probably the first time  Yeah   Hmm   And what does he think about Ciaran and the whole thing  Well he wants to me to finish up anyway  And he wants uhm  yeah he wants me to finish up and  to go out with him   But you 're not going to   I don't know  I 'm half thinking  Are you   But  I 'm half thinking and yet  I 'm not  I mean when I go out with Ciaran I I say no way definitely not  And then when I 'm out with Jim I say definitely yes  You know that way  Mmm  And I 'm totally  I really don't know what to do  I 'm going to go to Ciaran 's ball next Friday  I 'll keep it on til then  and I 'll see how  things go  Yeah  But I am  I really am mad about him inside  You know what I mean  He 's a real pet  And then in work it 's desperate  And nobody knows in work  They kind of suss it   Who kind of susses it  Mark susses it kind of  Now today he didn't  because now he today he he was was off track because uhm Nigel rang and asked said are you coming out cos who is it when they uhm  ring up the girl in the the receptionist says who 's ringing and Nigel said oh this is Nigel  Tell Tara is Tara there  I want to talk to her  Yeah  So uhm I said okay  I said who is it  And she said oh it 's Nigel  And I said oh grand  So Mark is right beside me  So when I was on the phone he said so where are you where do you want to meet  uhm Jim  Jim rang me  He 's from a on a  call-box and he doesn't want to ring you  in work  So he asked me to ring you and he 'll ring me back  So uhm I said I don't mind  I was trying to like not say much  so  that Mark couldn't hear  And  then anyway he said uh what what time and I said I don't mind  I 've to go home first  So Mark sussed it  You know he sussed things  And he says oh Nigel is ringing you  And I said yeah  I  he said are you going for a drink with him  I said I might be  I says why  You know and he was saying oh I see and he was saying Nigel 's a lovely guy  Blah blah blah  So I think he thinks I 'm having  doing you know  Yeah   Yeah   Keep five or six strings  to your bow  If one will forsake you  the other will take you   to your bow   Other will take you   laughter  So that 's the craic there  So even last night I was out after the funeral  We went to the Hibernian Hotel and then afterwards I had to go back to work and Jim rang me there to say will I come down to Searson 's cos there was a crowd of them the family and stuff  Well some of the family his dad and friends of his were going down to Searson 's and see would I go down  So I said first of all I was supposed to be in Ciaran 's at eight o'clock right  This is seven o'clock  and  I 'm still in work  This is seven o'clock yeah  This   Yeah  And I said no I said okay I 'll see  I I I I probably will  So I didn't finish work til half seven  I said ah feck it I 'll go down  I 'll go down uhm just for a while  So when I arrived down sure the dad was there and uhm all the  bro  well a good few of his friends and stuff and we were having great craic  So I didn't arrive  out to Ciaran 's til about half ten  Mm  Now the night before I didn't arrive out to Ciaran 's til one o'clock  And what did Ciaran say  Ciaran was fuming  Wondering where  Fuming  Completely  Wondering where in the name of God I had been  So I just said listen a friend from work his her I actually said her  granny died  I had to go to the  uhm whatever the the Mass  Or no I actually said I was what was it oh yeah I 'd I met her for a drink cos she was  really upset and that 's where I was  So I was supposed to be out in his house at something like nine o'clock and I didn't arrive out til one o'clock  And he had dinner ready and all this kind of stuff  war completely  Were you out with Ciaran last Saturday night  I didn't tell Jim that though  Jim had thought you stayed in  Well cos I was out with Jim during the day  Left Jim  wait and I tell you  Oh wait and I tell you  I was supposed to go for dinner with him that night Jim and a friend of his  There was twenty of them going for dinner in where 's it now in Temple Bar  Elephant and Castle  No no no it 's La Paloma  It 's uhm a a Spanish restaurant down there  And they 'd booked it  They they call it their Christmas party all the guys and and girls  Right   So uhm  anyway I said okay right I would go along  So anyway when I met him uhm we met at what time I left his  left him first of all at something like twelve o'clock and went home  got changed  came back  into town   You left  his place was it  yeah  Left his place  came back  went home  came back into town at three o'clock  met him  We went looking at my dress   long black dress   Jim and yourself   Jim and myself  Where does Jim live  Croydon Park Avenue  Oh right  Hmm  And who does he live with  His dad  Beautiful house  Then his mum lives in North Anglesey Road   don't get on   Even nicer  house  Well they 're separated like for the last ten years or more  Right  But they they get on you know but they don't live together  So anyway when I came into town then Jim and myself went around and we  then we went for something to eat  And then we oh this this new cafe or  place opened  It 's called The River  The River Cafe/  It 'd be like  there 's a place in London  Oh what 's it called  Oh Gumbino 's or something like that  It 's a well-known place  where it 's just like it 's a wine bar right  wine bar  with coffees and 'd be like something like the Shelbourne here right  Uhm like chairs around but much more spacious and everything and there 's a balcony and it 's all old-fashioned  It used to be the old uhm Merchant 's what was it I can't remember  now anyway  It 's just in Temple Bar but it 's completely out of character for Temple Bar  It 's absolutely beautiful now all  stone up the stairs and all this kind of stuff  And uhm so anyway he said come on down here and we 'll go for  go for a coffee or something in in  this new place  So Jim sure knew everyone in the place  Not everyone  He knew the guy on the door  He knew the the guy who runs the place  And went in there and your man sat down down and we were chatting to him and  great craic now  So anyway I  ended up staying there til near eight o'clock  Supposed to be out in Ciaran 's at six  Hmm hmm   So you 're dead meat  already   Dead again  laughter  And am oh stop so we had great oul day there  You 'll have to start deciding soon because you can't  Ciaran will  Oh I know that Ciaran 's going to cop on  And  Jim is going to get pissed off  And I 'm going to lose both of them  And I don't  I really Jeanette I really can't decide which  And that 's the honest  truth  I really like them both  But don't mention a word whatever you say   yeah   hmm   Oh I won't breathe a word  I won't say a thing but I 'm I 'm   Isn't he a dote  I 'm chuffed that I had  it  sussed  I had it decked but I  yeah  Yeah   What do you think of him  Really lovely  Isn't he
