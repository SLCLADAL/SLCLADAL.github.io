<S1A-091 Haircut - Mortgage>  Hello  Hi it 's me  How are you doing  I 'm just doing some work here  transcribing tapes  Oh right  that  interesting  Well   Yes  Right very good  Uhm what what 'd your hair turn out like  Och it 's it 's fine  Is it different or  Quite pleased with it  Well no it 's not very different  It 's just it 's straighter  I 'm thinking of going and getting something  like a colour put in mine  Really  Yeah  What colour would you use  Och well  I don't know  I 'd be tempted to sort of get a blondie thing done  You know like Loretta  Uh-huh  But then I thought that uhm  actually that might just look a bit ridiculous in my hair  but I know if I go they 'll suggest  But you could get a lighter one couldn't you  I mean it wouldn't have to be  blonde or  as light as hers  Yeah    I know but I hate hair that just looks like  it used to be brown and now it 's light brown  you know that kind of a way  So uhm I was thinking that I might get  sort of coppery things coppery tones put into it  But then that might just look ridiculous  So I don't know  Mm    well  What about tonight  Have you any plans  So   Have you seen the TV tonight  What 's on  Oh it 's brilliant  Uhm well there 's Sex and the City and uhm  Is Ally McBeal on or  no  I can't remember  There 's something really  a a really good line-up  Basically I remember thinking I will go home and sit and watch TV  Oh right  Uhm Julie  she wanted to call round last night  Mhm  But then I was out with the others  So uhm I think she might maybe call tonight  Right  She invited me for dinner again last night  Och did she  She said that she 'd made too much  for them  Uh-huh  And anyway I think she just wanted me to come round for something near my birthday  Yes  I felt a bit wick then having to say oh I can't go again  But  What do you mean again  You know the way she invited me before  like ages ago  I mean  like just after I moved in to the house  Oh right   Oh I see right  She invited me  Right  But uhm  I wasn't able to go  Mm  So I just felt a bit  sort of ungrateful that I wasn't able to go again  But I just said  sorry   I 'm sure  she 's not worried  What about you  Uhm I don't know  Peggy 's home just for tonight  Well she  was home yesterday for she and Rosie to look for bridesmaids dresses  for  Rosie  uhm but Rosie 's away down to Carlow today  and Peggy 's staying til tomorrow morning  But she was really  well she was sick last night well she just had a bad cold like so  Oh is she   Oh right   Mhm  well we said we 'd do something tonight anyway so  Mhm  I don't know  I 've texted her but she never  she never looks at her phone or else she never has you know  she never knows who text messages are from  But did you not sign it  Yeah well I did because she never knows  But  she hasn't replied  And she never looks at them it seems  But the thing is she never  she never clears her in-box  so   Yeah   Aye and did you never get her   She  never has any room to get new ones  Yeah  Did you not phone her  No well I I was just  said I 'd talk to her later  Loretta 's going to the Medic Fashion Show  Oh is she  Is Margaret in it  Yes Margaret 's in it yeah  Ah she phoned me there  She needed money but I was  I went back in my office  Told her to wait ten minutes but she didn't so she just  How 're you doing  I 'm fine  How are you  How did it go  Did you go and see Brendan yesterday  I did yes  Did  he call you  He had his  his uh file  It was sitting there with your name on you know just ready to call you basically after that  And   We got in touch with him anyway whether or not he called me  you know  laughter  So  what did he say   Yeah   So  very promising   Very promising  Really   He was  saying that uhm  he thought it would be complicated cos Clarisse is abroad  Excellent   Mm  But uh because I 'm earning enough  I  can just put the mortgage in my  name  or you know organise the mortgage through my accounts or whatever  Mhm   Mhm   Yeah  And if she 's got enough for the deposit  But he wouldn't tell me how much she had  She oh she does  Do you not know how much she has  I haven't a clue  well she 's got five thousand with him  It 'll be about well actually it 'll be about four thousand  laughter   And is that all usable  yes and then she 's got another three thousand in somewhere else  And that was her  resettlement  But she 's got plenty for the  uhm   Uh-huh   Right   Well he said it would be kind of I can't go over a house for seventy-six thousand  Right  Uh judging my salary or whatever  Mhm  And uh the deposit would be about four and legal fees whatever you know  So it 'd probably come up to about five  Yeah  But I can always get a loan anyway you know  But he  said  you know  you can't  you know they won't touch you if you 're getting a loan to pay your deposit  But to come  to him and he can put me in on if we get loans from local banks  Yeah   No  That 's right   Yeah  It 's not uh  you know it doesn't show up or something like that  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah they will like  They really do go through all your all your accounts and make sure you 're sort of  soluble and stuff  talking to non-phone conversational partner  I know Gordon  Well done  So uhm when 're you moving into yours  Well we don't know yet  We 're still doing the whole mortgage application nonsense  laughter   it 'll still be another few weeks like but hopefully really fucking soon  I 'm so  sick of this flat  laughter   Yeah   Yeah   I can't wait to see it  I know  I can't wait for you to see it  Yeah  So have you been looking at places  What 's what 's your limit  Seventy-six  I haven't looked yet    Seventy-six yeah  Right  So I want to look at ones between sixty and seventy-five kind of thing  advertised  so that I can see the difference in  the standard that I 'm getting or whatever you know  Yeah   Yeah yeah totally  Were you still thinking of Ormeau Road  Uh yeah  and maybe like around your area  Yeah I  think you should  cos you 'll probably be I know totally  It 'll probably be a lot better value  you know  because if you 're looking at sort of sixty seventy on the Ormeau Road  I don't really think  you know  the standard that you 're you 're going to  get  is is so good there really  We could be neighbours   Yeah   Yeah   Well there 's also Finaghy as well  I don't mind  like living up around here you know  Really   Oh God are you actually in Finaghy  Well I 'm only five minute walk from Finaghy  God yeah I never really thought about that  That 's  so weird  laughter   Yeah   Yeah yeah  Yeah  Would Clarisse want to live up there  Well I sent her an email just telling her all the craic and told her to  to like let me know  exactly what she 's looking for  you know  I said basically three plus bedroom  hopefully  Ormeau Road maybe Blessington maybe Forestside  as far  out as Forestside but hopefully that area and  if if not you know I 'm I 'm looking kind of around this area too you know  Upper  Lisburn Finaghy  Yeah   Mm   Mhm   Yeah absolutely   I mean even like talking to Brendan and just looking round ourselves we really did see that you know the houses on the Lisburn Road totally unaffordable  Can't even go there   Yeah  And they 're  a big pile of shite anyway  They are  I mean they really are but like Ormeau Road is pretty much getting there you know  They 're just going to be really really out-priced  that you know  not not quite  but   Yeah  well they 're starting to be already  you know   They really  are like ridiculous prices for you know the shittiest little houses  you know  3 sylls    You know  that one we lived  Ava Street  Yeah  I think it went it was advertised for about seventy-five or something  Really  Yeah  It just is mental  And like it 's shitty  I know and that was well I suppose that was what was that three bedrooms  But then  Mairead 's room was in the attic wasn't it  Yeah that was kind  of converted  like but it shouldn't really be a bedroom  you know  You can't stand up in it like  laughter   Mm   Yeah   laughter   That was the one she chose  laughter   I 'll choose the one  I can crawl in and out of  laughter   Mairead is   I know but I really do think like you should have a good look around the Blessington Road cos there are you  know  The reason why there are good bargains there is because of where it is like  Yeah but   Yeah but uhm I mean there are little pockets of  Mm  Of sort of Proddy pockets or whatever you know that I  don't want   There kind of  are but not  definitely not where we 've moved in to you  know  I can't   Yeah  how do you know  Well because I know people who have moved in there quite recently  Ehm  Ronan  Have you ever met Ronan  Uh-huh   Wee Ronan  Wee Ronan yeah  He lives there now  And a girl called Sally who sort of half-caste  She lives there now and she 's Catholic  Right  And you know it 's really really starting to get that way  around  that bit  Maybe not the Cregagh Road  Well definitely not the  Cregagh Road but definitely around  straight off  the Blessington Road  Definitely it 's quite  mixed  But you know not to say that we 'd ever be going to any of the bars there  laughter   Okay   Well no I don't  I wouldn't consider it   Mhm   No  Yes do you know what I mean  You 'd need to have UDA tattooed  across your forehead   What what  part of the road are you on  Can you describe it for me  do you know  like it 's sort of  straight ahead of you know where Worthington Embankment stops   the Blessington  It 's pretty much there  It 's like between  where the gates are to the Oulton Square and where the  BIFHE place  is  It 's pretty much just straight there  you know  You just have to walk about thirty seconds and would be like right at the gates of the Oulton  Square  So it is like straight off Blessington Road and about ten doors down  Yes   Uh-huh   Right right   Uh-huh   That 's only like ten minute walk then from   Road too   From the  Ormeau Road totally yeah  It 's quite a nice walk  if it 's if if it 's during the day like  Through the park lovely   Yeah  I mean you know that 's that 's why  why we took it  I was just wasn't prepared to go any more East Belfast than that  Cos Sarah-Jane 's sister lives sort of round the corner up up uh  My Fair Lady 's Road or something  My Lady 's Road yeah  My Lady 's Road  laughter   Stanley you know Stanley the hairdresser  He lives just off he lives uhm just off My Lady 's Road as well  Yeah  Yeah so it is you know getting to be  a sort of okay area for  people  like us  laughter   Mm   you see I don't have a clue  about  certain areas  You know you could only kind of judge them by  snotty-nosed kids running around   Mm   I know  Well I do   even if you 're thinking about looking at somewhere I 'll tell you what sort of an area it is  cos I  really do know around there really really well  But you need to be right off the Blessington Road  No further in than that like  Right
