<S1A-007 Girls' chat 2>  Hello Pat  How are you honey  Good thanks  How are you  Are you feeling as tired as I am  Not too bad actually although I had that sort of real  you know woke up this morning  knew I had lots to drink  Did you have lots to drink last night  I thought you seemed very sober  well I had lots of wine and everything in the restaurant and then I 'd two more gin and tonics and then I had a couple of drinks before I left the house so I suppose I had  Were the parents with you last night  No no they 're actually away  They 're in  the Caribbean   The Caribbean   Oh very nice $E offers chair to $B   Oh no I 'm quite happy here  Are you sure you don't want a chair  no no I 'm fine  several words   Jessie did you say you wanted water or  I 'll take your raspberry and  your thing for the baby laughter   I went and bought a bottle of water earlier for Mary  cos she 's pregnant  I 'm actually really concerned simultaneous and unclear speech   I think it 's absolutely hilarious  I hope you 're not Mary because  Do you know something that I don't  It 's prophetic  laughs   Doreen don't be saying that to her  Charles would love a little brother or a sister  In a few years  After he 's grown up a bit  Imagine having uh triplets  I wonder how people have those multiple births and actually survive to tell the tale  You couldn't I mean one  person couldn't stay at home with all those children  Sure you couldn't  You couldn't with all the kids  But then think about what it used to be like with your thirteen kids  you know  and everybody just kind of got on with it  Yes I know   I suppose they all looked after each other  That was the thing simultaneous and unclear speech   Oh look at your nails oh my God  They 're absolutely  gorgeous Pat  Oh I got the gel thing  do you know the gel tips you can get  They 're great  Doreen I don't know if they 're going to last cos one cracked  That  one cracked today  getting into  the car  They 're absolutely beautiful   Oh dear   And uhm well it was coming away anyway  Well you can go and get  so you 'll go and get that  one fixed on   That is great  You feel like so glamorous  You want to be sort of tapping the table  Mary-Louise was hilarious because she said all she could hear was this really irritating noise from the end of the table was me going  makes tapping noise   I can't get used to them Pat you know  They look so glam  Well they 're just you know I need to go and paint them again but they 're  I don't know if I 'll live with them from now on unclear speech   Apparently they do all sorts of weird and wonderful things  They do  they do sort of like silk tips and fibreglass and you know  I think you start off with gel  and  then you can sort of  work  your way up  Right   You work your way up   Once you have them done then do you sort of do you need to always like you 'll probably have those for like ten years or something will you  You know do you keep getting topped up   I don't know  Apparently what happens is you keep sort of growing your nails you know so that 's like a  that 's a gel tip there  And then  eventually what 'll happen is my nail will come up  but  they 'll keep putting gel on top of my  nail  so that keeps them strong and then you end up basically with your own set of nails but with a coat of gel over the top like a wee  Right   Right   So that keeps them strong   Cos Saibh McAlister has them and I thought it would just be the same sort of thing  Uhm she 's to go every two weeks to get  Uh what age is Saibh McAlistair to have  gel-tipped nails   I know   And hair extensions  She 's saving up to get hair extensions  in  the summer  No   Una what age is she  She 's doing her GCSEs  She 's working  all day Saturday and all day Sunday in  up in Malone House  What 's her mum thinking of  She 's doing her GCSEs and she 's not very keen  That is unbelievable  I can't get over that  I said how much is it to get your  to get hair extensions  It 's six hundred or something  $A hands present to $B  A little very belated birthday present  Well thank-you very much but you really did not need to  I know I 've been so bad and I just  I just had  laughter  Well I no I just decided it was a good opportunity to see everybody  everybody in the one room and then that was the idea  Aw you 're very kind  And very well organised  You haven't organised  you haven't opened it yet unclear speech   Ooh this is definitely me now  I thought it was very you Pat  Oh it is   I thought  it was gorgeous  that 's beautiful   Oh that 's beautiful   Oh that 's gorgeous  Now Mary-Louise and I can go out and see whose top is lower  laughter  There was one night we were really drunk and we were saying to all the boys  no my top isn't as low  I think you need to put a wee stitch in this flower here actually cos it sort of flops down a bit  Doreen that is gorgeous  Thank-you very much pet  That 's so kind of you  You 're very welcome  And I got you some earrings to go with them  Oh that 's beautiful  Very you   Oh Doreen that is so  several sylls    They are so me Doreen unclear speech   You should come home more often Doreen  Huh  You should come home more often laughter   Oh that 's very nice now  Doreen this is really great  I took my fashion advisor Linda Harney with me today and she was helping me pick out all these  och thanks a million  all these tops and everything  Thank-you  They 're really lovely  Now Pat honestly if you don't   2 sylls  or whatever  I have the receipts  Oh I love them   Well I think I 'll need to be tanned when I wear it unclear speech   Well actually  I 'm getting into this beauty salon thing cos she was telling me that they 're going to get the St Tropez in spray guns  and all you have  to do is stand there  and they 'll spray  you and I was thinking  Is that right   Now that would be good   Apparently the mousse is really good  Right  Apparently it dries a lot quicker than the uhm than the gel simultaneous and unclear speech   Pat are you sure you don't want a chair  No I 'm fine thank-you Jessie  Are you sure  Yeah  A-Wear has gorgeous  absolutely gorgeous stuff  A-Wear is lovely  really really lovely  I think I 've been one time to Forestside in my life  Forestside 's brilliant  Well Linda and I went over to  2 sylls  and uhm  cos I 'd really  dy  I was going to go on Saturday and I thought no I couldn't face it  And then we went over to to  2 sylls  and uh it was fine actually  I was half sort of expecting it was going to be like uh a murder picture  but it was grand  It was really fine  And it 's so nice cos everything 's there  and then  if you have to get a few bits and pieces in Sainsbury 's you 're grand  you can park the car  It was great actually  It was really good  Was it bunged   Yeah everything is there   You 've got Next  you 've got Oasis  you 've got Accessorize  You can actually go and get your  underwear in Marks and Spencer 's  you can get your makeup there  you 've got Martin Ball 's as well  Principles  River Island  Yeah you 've got everything  Dunnes   I was laughing the thing about Susan Harkin last night with your mum 's ring  You know the way Susan doesn't normally get that worked up about things  Oh no  laughter  Oh it was funny  She tried on Doreen 's mum 's ring and she just went oh my God it 's so fabulous  Jarlath  laughter  You know the way that 's quite  you know the way Susan seems to be very unassuming  I have never laughed  Jarlath meanwhile was sitting there with his arm round Mr Martin  Yeah Jarlath and daddy were having some sort of a love-in at the other table later in conversation   big hot date Thursday night  I don't even feel comfortable talking about him on tape  Och don't be stupid  several sylls   No names are mentioned  I know I know  But uhm  What was his name  laughter   Och it was very nice  I just can't  I was saying to Jessie last night I just  you know it was nice  It didn't  I wasn't overly keen about him but I 'm you know quite happy when he said right well what  do it again next week  But Pat you 're never realistically going to be  delighted about it the  first few times so   And how  sorry how did you meet this guy or is he  Who is he  What 's his name  How did you meet him  He 's a big brother of Mary and I 's friend from primary school  Glenda  MacNamara and he gave  apparently he 's been home for years but I 'd always thought he lived in London or Dublin or something  Oh really   Right okay  And he 's been out in McSweeney 's and all the rest and I 've seen him loads  And uhm  we were having a chat about it  we were having a chat about him in Tatu and I said  can't work this guy out  He keeps talking and chatting to me and uhm you know disappearing five minutes later  So we went into Shu and sure  sure enough he came over and it was like chat chat chat for five minutes and then he disappeared  This was the night you were all  this was last weekend  This was last Saturday night  This was the last time we were very drunk and then we decided to drink our cocktails and  3 sylls  all the rest of it  And then he came over at the end and he said   4 sylls  do you want to dance  And I said I thought you were coming over to get me a drink  What are you asking me for a dance for  yeah I really was  I was probably even ruder than  this  And he said oh right well and he got all sort of shy  several sylls  Oh no  would you like to go for a drink sometime  And I said  if I 'm going to give up a night of my evening you know at least you could bring me for dinner  And not just dinner anywhere  somewhere nice  None of this nonsense  Oh God   I can't believe  the poor guy  I 'm surprised he 's going out with you after that  If that was me I 'd be like  And then he said  he said uh  how will I contact you and I said my number 's in the book  I 'm the only MacDuine that 's there or whatever  you know  yeah  But he was nice and he was charming and he was  And did you snog him  I snogged him two bottles of wine and two gin and tonics later  laughter  Yeah  You know though mind you realistically when you got into the restaurant you were hardly going to grab him across the table  No no no  You know so  I don't know  I mean I think I did fancy him but he 's always just Glenda 's older brother  You know older brother  What what age  Thirty-seven  Oh of course  you told me that  But I don't think that 's such a big deal  I don't think  that 's a big deal either Pat   Not if you like somebody  Pat you know  Och it 's not a big deal  He 's eight years older than us  So you know   And he 's a man  So it 's not  you know  I know  But it 's just that if I find that he hasn't had a girlfriend  He can go on forever laughter   But uh  What does he do Pat  He 's an accountant  several sylls   I had an idea that he was a pharmacist but I think that that was just given his surname and Enda simultaneous and unclear speech   He 's Enda MacNamara 's cousin  But apparently  He 's not related to Kim  Well he must be  That 's another brother  But he 's a cousin I mean he 's not a brother  He 's not in Kim 's family he 's in another family  Yeah  Now who 's Kim  This is Kim MacNamara  He 's  friendly with Freddie Hopkins and all that crowd  Freddie   Ah and is he related to  Yeah I think all the dads are brothers  Yeah there 's four of them  There 's four   four dads  So Enda 's dad and Bert 's dad are brothers unclear speech   That 's mad  Och that 's nice Pat  Och Doreen I mean  it 's a bit of interest  Yeah I agree   Yeah exactly   And when the bill arrived I just thought my God  You 're just right  laughter   several sylls  around and all the rest of it  Then I sort of like mumbled thanks and whatever  laughter   Just a mumble of thanks not even like uh  several sylls   We were round with James Brown there this evening and uh I was asking if there would be any single guys at the wedding  And  there 's loads  And are there   Oh happy days  He mentioned at least seven   Jessie  We 're going to get really glam for this wedding   At least seven  Oh happy days
