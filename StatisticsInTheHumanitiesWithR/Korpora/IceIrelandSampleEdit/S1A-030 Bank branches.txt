<S1A-030 Bank branches>  It 's obviously my jealousy that I don't live there but   3 sylls    Just think  Brian if you  your daddy gets an  another promotion  laughter   There 're not the  branches in Londonderry that would be a promotion  Excuse me  Why not  What 's wrong  if the  branch is not in Derry  Because   I just say none of them would actually be a promotion because they 're all you know  What  It 's the grades  They 're all  grades  of management  Mm   And what 's so great about the one in Portadown  It 's because of the grade it 's on  The management 's their own grade  There 's five different  there 's five different grades   laughter  branch size and  number it 's number of customers your  turnover et-cetera et-cetera   Oh how do we how do we grade  Like cows   Well you see yes but you see  but right    5 sylls   or anything  No I can normally cope with picking up a sausage  No to be honest  laughter   No but Brian  the branches  in uhm   Have you tasted  one of the other things yet   Caitri/ona   Excuse  me  Brian Brian in Portadown  how many Ulster Bank branches are there  How many actual  Ulster Banks are there in Portadown  Uhm there I think there 's a sub-office up there but uh  Well that  technically   But you see  technically then that doesn't count because in up in Derry there 's like what there 's like I think there 's four or five  Yes but they 're all separate branches  if you know what I mean   Yeah  yeah  That 's because there 's so many customers they can get in one place  It 's big enough   No no not  that 's why I 'm saying it wouldn't actually be a promotion  I know what you mean  There 's they 're all  over the city   Yes that that 's  what  I mean   Seriously  Mark   can have the last one   Youse are  so many people  Yes I know I don't   several sylls    Well it worked pretty well  several sylls   didn't it  Money suits you    6 sylls    Hey  How many banks are in Ballycastle full stop  Or are there any  A good few  Brian   There 's a  Northern Bank in it but I think it 's  But they all barter like I say  Possibility  laughter  Is there a First Trust  4 sylls   Yes of

engines do they have  Two  I remember going round showing her our fire station  She didn't believe me we had one  laughter   You didn't need one  cos what fireman in their right mind would come to Bally  2 sylls  laughter   I remember when it was  do you remember the bomb in  laughter  Coleraine  Yeah our fire engine had to go over and  help out  the fire at Moore 's in Coleraine  She said   laughter  She says all our fire engines had to go and oh Jesus our two fire engines had to go  and answer  laughter   We have  three actually Laurel  I seen one stayed too in case there was anything wrong in Ballycastle  laughter  Yes  No  No  All three of them went  Well what if there 'd been a fire in Ballycastle  That was a bit unfair  Och that 's  true though   Well there 's  nothing in Ballycastle worth saving anyway  laughter   I wouldn't go as far  as that   Oh they no  they 've a nice Church of Ireland church and they 've a nice Presbyterian  church   They have  two Church of Ireland churches  Do they  There was a Methodist church but it sort of turned into a  Catholic Scouts  laughter and jeers  hall  And is Mark a Methodist  Mm well  somebody has to be    several sylls     What was that Mark   sis  my sister  goes to Kilfennan Presbyterian  Oh Kilfennan sure  Well Mark would you not like to be a Presbyterian   been to   Where 's Kilfennan  Presbyterian  Sorry I 'm uh  It 's in the Waterside  You know the Waterside   It was formerly  Saint James '  Street   Gr  Great  James ' Street  Very good hall beside it  And it it had to close down cos there was the city there 's quite a lot of Presbyterian churches in the city side  And uhm  you know the numbers anyway dwindling  and there wasn't enough  So they moved to the Waterside and  there opened up okay  They 're doing  well   Do you  ever hear what happened to the Minister why he left  No  Is this scandal  Yeah  He got up he called a session meeting for  a quarter past eleven   Ten  yeah all in  On one Sunday  morning   Sunday  morning  And he announced at session that  he was leaving  And he the congregation didn't get into the church til about ten to twelve  He was leaving   And he just got up  in his pulpit   And he  got up in the pulpit and said this is my last Sunday preaching  I am leaving  However  I I would help it if I could take a month 's holiday  and stay in the Manse for another month  laughter  Goodbye  basically   Did they  let him  Yes  Yeah but  I would 've turfed him out on his ear  No just the thing about it was Brian nobody knew he was leaving  until that Sunday  Yeah  He goes   Where was where  was he going  He just decided to leave  I don't suppose then you found out why  Nobody found out  There 's been lots of rumours you know flying about that he was seeing some other woman and  he had a crisis with his faith and everything but nobody  nobody knows why  He 's teaching  in Belfast now Mark  He still goes about   He 'd no need but to desert so quickly  You  know what I mean leaving them in the lurch like that  So  is this recent  Mm   Aye   It was last  summer was it   Think it was  last summer yeah  My granny goes to Kilfennan and she she 's in  she was in a wild way about it cos she thought he was great  And and they haven't found a minister a replacement minister yet  They they had found one  Then the commendation  wouldn't be  unanimous you know  yes  That 's right  That 's right  They wouldn't make a unanimous decision  And he wouldn't come  Mark  because it wasn't a unanimous decision  That 's right   Looks like your ministry can't be  2 sylls   I remember when Downpatrick were choosing their new minister  They came down to this  a woman and a man  And then of the congregation basically voted fifty-one percent for one of them forty-nine percent for the other  laughter  So that 's like neither of them came  And they did find somebody eventually in the end  A women got  forty-nine percent of the vote  No I think she got more than the man  dear   Well that 's  a turn-up for the books  Oh dear  Can't have a woman minister  Forget that  What was that Mark  Why can't we  My cousin 's a woman minister and I 'm proud that she 's a woman minister  2 sylls  women ministers  allowed   I 'm sorry  but women ministers in my eyes are just there to to extend  3 sylls   That 's rubbish  That 's  rubbish   So then  Mark why  why should a man be a minister and a woman  not allowed to be  What 's wrong with women that  what 's so different  Can't have the same  If you remember from Genesis  Yes thank-you Mark  I do  Man Adam was created  and then God took a  rib from Adam  to   create Eve   Oh no   Create Eve   Yes thank-you  Well hold on a minute Mark  When their children came in their children married  and the people they married were already on the earth anyway  No they inter-married  They would 've had to 've inter-married  Mm they did  No you would 've had to 've inter-married if if you if uh unless you believe that Adam and Eve were not the first  and that all uh we are all descendants of Adam and Eve they would they would 've had to 've inter-married  Well if they only had two children and  they were  did they have   They 'd more than two children  No  they had  more than two children  Yeah   It 's just the others were back room players and  never heard about break in conversation   Were Sinn Fe/in boys saying that the Republicans had nothing to do with the attack on the  SDLP Councillor   Crossmaglen  Republicans  in Crossmaglen  I think not  Oh of course   Mm mm   You know just because someone could stand in the middle of the street  and fire a mortar  at the  police  disappear  without no-one in the village seeing anything  it doesn't  mean that  they 're Republican in the village you  know   Yeah    2 sylls    That  place but has got some fortune out of the International Fund for Ireland over the years  Has it yeah  Oh yeah   several sylls     several sylls     several sylls  Derry  since you have  all the  houses have got double-glazed window  Even the army as well   2

population  And we  all know in the census figures Lisburn had a higher population than Londonderry  It is   Well that depends  how you define Londonderry   Yeah  exactly Mark  What do you mean
