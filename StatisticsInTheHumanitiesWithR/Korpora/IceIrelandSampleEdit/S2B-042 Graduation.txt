<S2B-042 Graduation>  Vice Chancellor  honorary graduate  ladies and gentlemen  it is my pleasure and privilege to welcome you all to this graduation ceremony in Queen 's  This is an important occasion for all of us  the Reverend Doctor Hurley  graduands  their relatives and friends  and for staff  as it marks the end of another academic year in Queen 's  This is a happy occasion  a day of celebration to mark the award of degrees to graduates in the Faculty of Education  Queen 's is pleased to play host to everyone today and to entertain you this afternoon at the garden party in the quadrangle  This is a special occasion for different groups of people this afternoon  First of all  could I address a few words to the parents and relatives of today 's graduands  This is a proud and important day for every one of you  a day to celebrate the completion of another stage in your child 's education  a day when you hope that they will soon become financially independent  laughter  The graduands should be grateful for all the support that has been provided to them during the time of their education  not just at Queen 's but also at school  Without the support of their families many student would find it impossible to complete their education successfully  So I hope afterwards that the graduands will remember to thank their parents for the support that they have given them  For many of you that support will continue  maybe not in financial terms  but in continued interest in your future careers  Queen 's graduation ceremonies have been held in this the Sir William Whitla Hall since it opened in nineteen forty-nine  I attended my first graduation ceremony on the seventh of July nineteen fifty-five when I obtained a degree in physiology  The programme for that uh uh date  and I still have my uh sample  uh the programme for that date does not compare with the bright  Technicolor publication that you have all received today  This programme does not even say if there was a graduation address  and I cannot remember if one was given  Clearly it cannot have left a lasting impression on me  laughter  It may well be that the that the parents of some of today 's graduands were students at Queen 's in the nineteen fifties  and will remember taking examinations  attending formal dinners  or graduating in this hall  If you have not had contact with Queen 's in the intervening period you might be surprised at the many changes that have taken place  In nineteen fifty-two  six hundred and twenty-four students started courses in Queen 's  and forty years later in nineteen ninety-two this had increased to just over two and a half thousand  In nineteen fifty-two the total undergraduate population at Queen 's was about two thousand seven hundred  This past year there were eight and a half thousand students as undergraduates and another fifteen hundred postgraduate students giving a total student population in the university of around ten thousand  In nineteen fifty-two there were two graduation ceremonies  This year there will be nine  with a total of two and a half thousand students graduating  This growth of the student population at Queen 's has been accompanied by many other changes to the university  The number of professors has increased  from forty-five to a hundred and twelve  but not in proportion to the increase in students  Most of the old buildings around the quadrangle have been retained  al  their use although their use has changed  The library where you may have studied has been refurbished and is now most impressive but still retains its old character  The old Students ' Union building  where you 'd have met with students from all faculties  played billiards and possibly attended a Saturday night hop  now houses the School of Music  In the last thirty years the University has built much new accommodation for teaching and research within a short distance of this hall  on the Lisburn  Malone and Stranmillis Roads  It 's also purchased in many and and now owns many houses and other buildings in this neighbourhood  All are used by staff and students  The total value of the Queen 's estate is now over two hundred and fifty million pounds  Queen 's is currently engaged in an active programme of refurbishment of buildings to provide the best environment for future students  Queen 's has put a particular effort into the provision of purpose-built residential accommodation for its students  The halls of residence are probably known to many here today  but it is probably not known that in the past five years Queen 's have provided over four hundred new study bedrooms for students  We are proud of this new accommodation  and I am pleased to say that the next eighteen months  we will be providing a hundred and twenty more study bedrooms in refurbished properties in Mount Charles  some two hundred yards from the University  Although there 's been such a marked increase in student numbers  there has been no diminution in the University 's commitment to the maintenance of high quality scholarship and research  When this university was established in eighteen forty-five as the Queen 's College Belfast there were three faculties  in which there were scientific and literary divisions  Medicine and Law  indicating the commitment to education in general and to vocational training  Queen 's has continued to develop its commitment  both to scholarship and to vocational training  although there 's now a closer relationship between them  Education programmes within the University have continued to be developed  to take account of the skills required by our graduates through new courses such as law and accounting  information management  European Community studies  and computer science with business administration  Within degree programmes a wide variety of courses are provided to broaden the training of our students  One example is the non  special  specialist language teaching programme where fourteen language courses ranging from French German and Spanish  to Arabic  Mandarin Chinese and Japanese  are provided at various levels from beginners to post A-level  Last year over twelve hundred students from all faculties  including Medicine and Engineering  took the above courses  Thus Queen 's is moving with the times and responding to the needs of our students to equip them not only with the education but  with the skills they will require in the development of their careers  Turning to the graduands  I offer you my congratulations on the successful completion of your university career  Today marks one of the most important days of your life  the day when your formal education has been completed  and after a few weeks ' well-deserved holiday  you look forward to embarking on your career  Collectively  you 're a high quality workforce who are about to  who are about to embark on the development of future generation of pupils in Northern Ireland and perhaps further afield  We are fortunate that the quality of entrants to the teaching profession in Northern Ireland is still high compared to England and Wales  The entrance requirements for the Bachelor of Education course are as high as those for most other courses in Queen 's or any other university  It is most important that these highly intelligent  well-trained professional teachers are used to maximum effect in their chosen profession  I wish to emphasise to everyone here the most important role that today 's graduands will have in the development of many aspects of the lives of young people in Northern Ireland  and in the future of Northern Ireland itself  It will be your role to teach the children who will be the future students at this and many other universities  and those graduates will in turn contribute to our future  Those pupils who do not go to university require to be educated to the highest possible standard to contribute to the world scene and not just Northern Ireland  The maintenance of our standards not only in education but in many aspects of our lives in the years ahead will be in your hands  Life will not be comfortable or straightforward  Teaching is not an easy option whether you 're teaching a class of five year olds or fifteen year olds  especially if the latter are not interested in education  And it 's easier to lecture to a group of highly motivated university students for a few hours a day than to get a class of young children from nine a-m to four pm  particularly during your first year when you are uh when you are set classes during the day  and preparation work at night  life will seem to be very hard  But look at the satisfaction that will come from teaching  in seeing the development of your pupils until they end up at university even as a professor or a vice chancellor at your old university  Unfortunately you will find that some people do not hold the teaching profession in high regard  I find this impossible to understand as often the children of these critics have benefited from high quality education  The attitude of the public to the teaching profession must be changed  How can this be achieved  It may stem from jealousy arising from the apparently long holidays  but these are required to give you respite from the work of the other nine months  One might expect the government to provide a lead  but this is unlikely as it seems to be against all the professions  medicine  universities and teachers  as you may have noticed from all the changes that have been introduced in these professions in recent years  The solution probably lies in your own hands  by demonstrating to your pupils and to their parents the importance of education  You all will fulfil a most important role not only in the in the education  but also in the development of many generations of students  This is the message you should try to convey to your pupils and their parents but it will not be easy  How do you wish to be remembered uh by your pupils  Children have strong ideas about the kind of teachers they like  Surveys since the nineteen thirties have shown that children prefer teachers who are slightly strict  but not severe not over-severe or permissive  who treat them as individuals  who are fair in their use of punishments and rewards  and who have a sense of humour without being sarcastic  Look back at the teachers who influenced your education  I 'd expect that most of them would have had these qualities  The teachers I can remember forty years later are the ones who influenced me and most would 've had these characteristics  Today does not mark the end of your education  It is only the end of your formal education  Your education will and in fact must continue during your professional life  Continuing education is essential to cope with the advances and changes that will inevitably occur  It is not so long ago that calculations were done with slide rules and log tables  but electronic calculators and computers have replaced them  and who knows what will be available in thirty years ' time  Postgraduate students in Queen 's are now expected to submit their work prepared on a word processor using Harvard Graphics  Will this one day replace handwriting in the school classroom  Will advances in information technology make our libraries redundant or only uh place for storing books while you read the script on laptop computers  But in addition you 'll have to contend with the many changes imposed by a government  which seems determined to introduce reform too rapidly without proper evaluation  and without adequate financial support  I hope that you will all partake of the in-service education opportunities offered through an integrated approach by the faculty of education and the two uh colleges St Mary 's and Stranmillis  Currently about nine hundred teachers are enrolled for the diploma in advanced study of education  the advanced certificate course and the master of education course  This means that members of the faculty of education had developed close contacts with schools over a long period of time which resulted in a coherent and strong informal relationship being developed  It is this relationship that will will facilitate changes in teacher education  This will be the last uh graduation ceremony for the faculty of education to be attended by Doctor Rogers in his position as principal of Stranmillis College  as he will be retiring in the autumn
