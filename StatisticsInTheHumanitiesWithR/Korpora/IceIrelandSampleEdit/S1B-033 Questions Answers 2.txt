<S1B-033 Questions Answers 2>  By redundancy you mean somebody else at the next election  Not no politicians   elections   By  redundancy I mean that we could do with a lot less of them that they 're proving it themselves by the time factor they 're taking sorting themselves out instead of running the country  Right okay centre row here yes  yeah  It 's James Casey Caherciveen  I 'd like to say that it it 's quite obvious that we need the immediate implementation of a Freedom of Information Act and a referendum on cabinet confidentiality  Now as recent as uh December fifth last Eithne Fitzgerald made a statement in Killarney saying that  a document on the formation of a uh Freedom of Information Act was well advanced in the office of the Ta/naiste  So we should not have to wait more than six to eight weeks for that document to come to the Da/il for debate and be passed  Right okay good point that was made here indeed   third row here yeah   Jim Kemmy there has stated that Labour hadn't got anything to lose  But I think that  Labour in fact have an awful lot to lose because it seems to me that what Dick Spring said yesterday he 's pre-judging what is going to come out  at the Committee of Enquiry  Jim Kemmy   Uhm first of all  can I say about Gerry Collins that I agree fully with his objective uhm uh assessment of that  he has a philosophical detachment  to the question which uh I think is uhm I think in his own context  uh extremely magnanimous of him  He hasn't been partisan here tonight at all  Similarly Joe Lee has brought  an academic I suppose  uh viewpoint to bear on it  But as far as I 'm concerned uh I have no axe to grind at all  I think the speaker in in the audience has said that we need more accountability more openness  regard regarding politicians in our country  Even though they are a bit foggied  they are confused by the by the bewildering statements coming out  nevertheless there are better issues or bigger issues involved in this  At the end of the day  I do hope we 'll have a more democratic society  well accountable society  These are the issues that are important  Yeah I do understand people in the audience saying  they 're tired of us  They 're impatient intolerant of us  uh waiting so long to form a government  But don't forget just one week ago  uh two thirds of the Irish people in three separate polls wanted a Labour Fianna Fa/il coalition  and we 've responded to that even though it wasn't a black and white  are now  several sylls  endeavouring to put together a Rainbow Coalition but that is democracy  In your own private life and in your family life none of us are so perfect that our lives are impeccable  And we 've a question on that rainbow uh later on in the programme but now we 're taking two questions uh together  They 're both in a sense linked  Dan Neville has the first  Yes   Thank-you  John  Uh would the panel agree that  it would be appropriate for an incoming coalition to replace Padraig Flynn at this time   Now would the panel agree that it would be appropriate for an incoming coalition to replace Padraig Flynn as the Irish Commissioner in the European Union at this time  And Paul Coughlan has another question  Yes  should the Senate vacancies be filled by Albert Reynolds or should they be left open to be filled by the incoming Taoiseach  Can we take the Padraig Flynn question first Joe Lee   Well I think that the commissionership has always been treated as a political football between the parties  and that uh no appointment that hasn't been dominated by political considerations  has been made to that job so far  It 's quite true that uh Dick Burke was appointed by Charlie Haughey I think  uh on one occasion but  he didn't belong to Fianna Fa/il but that was certainly governed by political considerations  I think that  there has to be an agreement between the parties  as to how commissionerships will be nominated in future  if in fact  Mr Bruton or the Rainbow or whatever comes in now is going to depart from the tradition of political primacy  Uh I don't think that it 's reasonable to expect  a one Taoiseach to say  I am now going to institute  different standards unless there can be cross-party agreement on the procedures for that in the longer term  Uh I think that  it would be unfortunate in many ways if Padraig Flynn were replaced because he does seem to be  doing a very good job  At least that 's the impression we regularly get  that he 's doing a good job  And uh it would be  I think ungracious in a way  At the same time the political reality  is that it has been a political calculation all along and we can well see the attraction to John Bruton of uh withdrawing Padraig Flynn and appointing somebody like say Alan Dukes who uh would certainly do an extremely good job  uh who would uh serve his political  needs by getting rid of somebody who might be a bit awkward at home  And therefore you can sever a bird with the same stone  laughter  But unless there can be cross-party agreement on the procedure  then uh I think probably it will go along the political route John  Jim Kemmy isn't it the case that Dick Spring has already been part of a government which nominated  uh the commissioner in Padraig Flynn  How could he be part of a rainbow who might change his mind now   First of all John I 'm not too sure whether  it 's within the gift of government to change   4 sylls    It 's at a very  advanced stage  He 's been nominated already  He 's been assigned a portfolio and  a very senior one   He has    And also I agree  with what Joe said  After some initial difficulties Padraig Flynn settled in well  And even he was an unlikely person to be in charge  of the social affairs portfolio  By and large his  several sylls  settled in to the job very well and done  fairly well in that area  I wouldn't want to take that from him  Mind you  he 'd be a lofty and loose cannon  on the Fianna Fa/il back benches when he 'd return home   I I I I say Bertie Ahern would prefer  to have him  in Europe as far away as possible from him  laughter  That 's my own view  He 'd have to to win the seat first Jim   Gerry Collins you could you could create a seat for him Gerry by the way  You 're in Europe now  You could design  2 sylls  and he could stand in Limerick West  Well I 'll tell you something I don't think he 'll get elected in West Limerick  laughter  But I I do in fairness want to say that Padraig Flynn has an exceptionally high record  of achievement as Commissioner in the European Union  That is fact  Nobody can take that from him  He 's been extremely successful  uh and that is recognised  Uh he has been reappointed by the  the new Commission President Mr Santer uh to the portfolio which he held an exceptionally important one  Uh and I believe it would be very unwise in the interests of this country to make any attempt to remove him uh from that particular post  Technically it may be possible  but practically I think it would be  extremely unwise  Normally Parliament  would 've no difficulty whatsoever in ratifying Padraig Flynn  And I would think that he above all the new Commissioners coming before the Parliament in early January for ratification would probably get the greatest approval rating of the lot  I say that  and I know because I watch Mr Flynn when he comes to the European Parliament  Uh and I watch how he how how he how he deals with the situation for which he is responsible  He 's doing an excellent job  And from a political point of view a narrow political point of view here at home I think we would be exceptionally foolish and unwise even if we could do it  and I 'm not too sure that we can  but we would be foolish and unwise to interfere with Padraig Flynn 's nomination  And the fact that he 's already been given a very senior post  which by the way there is no guarantee whatsoever that though the person that might replace him would get that particular post because  there is also another matter that must be taken into account in that equation in that the the portfolio that was allocated for the Norwegians if and when they entered and now they haven't that 's there vacant too  So we 'd want to tread carefully uh because you know  Parliament is still to ratify it  Isn't it   There might  be a reshuffle in other words   It would be  it would be very unwise and foolish and I don't think this government should do it  And I believe as well  that Dick Spring having been a party to that decision  a unanimous decision  then I can't see how he could explain how he would walk away from it like now  And what do you make of the argument which some people in Fine Gael might make for instance that Peter Sutherland might 've made a a President of the Commission if Fianna Fa/il had been  uh magnanimous enough to put  a another person in   That my  my my dear  Mr Bowman that was surely nothing other than a political argument put forward for Peter Sutherland because  laughter  exceptionally fine man an exceptionally fine reputation  but no guarantee whatsoever that the other eleven member states at at at Prime Minister or President level would agree to he getting the particular  nomination   Right  Avril Doyle the question we 're on is Padraig Flynn  Should he be retained or replaced if that were possible by any incoming rainbow   Well I 'm not sure what the incoming rainbow actually will do with Padraig Flynn  but uh if he was removed it 's no reflection on Padraig 's ability nor indeed his record  It just reflects the political reality of  government in Ireland  today   Just  for the boys you mean   Indeed it could be part of of negotiation for government  You also mentioned the two vacancies in the Seanad  Uh I I feel they again could be part of discussion  providing Albert Reynolds the uh acting Taoiseach  can leave government and leave office with some dignity  I do not think they should be filled as a last minute rush  as he rushes out the door   So who 's going to make it Avril   you 're having it both ways  You want  the option of putting your person into  Padraig Flynn  and you  think Albert shouldn't fill and take his chance by filling  the two Seanad  3 sylls    Yes I am   Into into the Seanad   They are they are  two issues that are there for discussion by the negotiators of the present  Rainbow Coalition   But I 'm asking for  your opinion tonight  Uh I really don't know  I 'm not party to the discussions  And the discussions are at a critical and very sensitive stage  And what I say tonight and my personal opinion actually could be quite damaging to the overall uh uh resolution uh of of a programme for government with the three parties  So I don't think it 's politic for me to say what I personally would like to do  But I would hope  that Albert Reynolds would have the grace to leave office with dignity rather than spread the jobs round for the boys as he rushes out the door with the key in his hand  And I would just suggest that  you made perhaps the most important point in response to this question in that  rather than Gerry  albeit very temperately uh lecture us on on the political niceties of how this might be handled  The point was  that Europe was calling from head-of-state level down to the ordinary punter calling for Peter Sutherland to be nominated uh as our representative last time round  And the Fianna Fa/il Labour government chose to ignore that
