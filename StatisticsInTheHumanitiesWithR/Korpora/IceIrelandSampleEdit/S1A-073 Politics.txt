<S1A-073 Politics 1>  But uhm  the reality is  that it suited an awful lot of people cos as I said to you the other night there 's no way that the vast majority of Fianna Fa/il TDs could go back to their constituencies  and say that they were going to propose  uhm divorce or abortion or anything else like  They wouldn't get elected themselves  next time  And so it suited  but could Bertie  Bertie is in a personal dilemma   2 words    Though Bertie today went on record as supporting divorce   No he  drew attention to that distinction  but the but the point is  that   That Fianna  Fa/il have decided to put  su  to bring forward divorce legislation and support it  But but nevertheless  there 's no guarantee they will be deliver able to deliver the country on that and  despite all their their their their  their uhm  lip  service and everything  one would still   careful  In order for them to carry divorce in the country they have to change the thing about  the Matrimonial Home Bill  and they still haven't done that   Will you have another drop of wine Bronwyn  It 's there   Yes thanks   Nice isn't it   'Tis yeah   And he said he said it  that the uh yeah he said in great detail which interested me  I was surprised at  how detailed he was and how  informed he was in the sense that he had it so fresh in his mind  But he listed the way they approached the case  Quite different from the last time  Mmm  Because last time  they were not in favour  But it was because  there was an awful lot of things  that weren't attended to which were  cognate to it  But he listed about six things that they 've instituted  which a whole range of ministries  which uh have been designed  to structure the context and the parameters so that in fact the divorce legislation that was brought in wouldn't have the dire effects that some people feared  Mmm  And that this was still ongoing  and that a range of measures had been taken  and that having  1 syll  that way  they were  moving ahead with the divorce legislation in a different  context where they had covered lots of problems  But they haven't covered the matrimonial home thing  They thought they had  covered it  and the court case said  and the courts said no  Now that is also one of the things where they suspect that the Attorney General 's office knew that that piece of legislation was defective  But it didn't suit Matt Russell that it should go through  so he didn't bother changing it  3 sylls  That that it also said  on the other hand  uh shall we say there are more than one lawyer in the Government including Dick Spring  and if they were bloody good lawyers they too should have seen  that as well   Mm  3 words    Including Michael D Higgins   Absolutely  And they didn't see it so they can't blame your man for  everything  I mean  i  if they were doing their work uh they were doing their work these things wouldn't happen  But until such time as they do amend that  even organisations like AIM  the women 's organisations will be against divorce until such time  And they will advise their members to vote against  until such time as they bring that down  because  i  it 's quite dangerous   Oh no   And I think the the that the Government are  trying to resolve that  I think it 's necessary to resolve it too I agree  Where I think they probably will  I don't  think   But they but they if they  bring the divorce in before they amend that it 'll fail again  and then it 'll be gone for a whole  generation  not just ten or five years the next time  Mmm   When is it expected to come back up again  Oh I didn't say that now   4 words    They 're talking in terms of you see  they want it within this   Government   This session  yeah  But that 's only two years  But it would appear  yeah it would appear as if Matt Thingabob has not hasn't been generating any real work with regard to a new bill  Russell  1 syll    Well we don't know  But uhm  uh Bertie is very interesting on that  Hmm  And uh I think very clear  Uh Bruton I thought was  What did  Bruton do   Magnificently  revealing  And how   Can I 've a biscuit   Oh please yes of course  How do you mean he was revealing  What 'd did  he do   On his  thickness you know  On his thickness  laughter   They say he 's a very bright honest man really  Oh I 'm sure  he 's honest  yeah yeah   Well he certainly isn't bright  but he 's not a  good politician though  He 's quite he 's a   1 word    he can  put words together  He can't  because  he didn't take much   Oh God he didn't  He made a holy show  of himself the other day   He can speak much  he can speak much better  than most of them better than Bertie Ahern but anyway  Can he  Oh he can  Sure Bertie Ahern can't speak neither Irish nor English  laughter  He can only speak in Dublin  Excuse me now you  watch out now  you you bogger you you bogger   It wasn't me  That 's all  5 words   laughter   Would you come with me to the pub tonight  laughter  To the  the Crossguns  Would you go into Dub county there or what like  Yeah that 's that 's where  Bertie drinks  It 's a dreadful pub actually now  It was a nice pub at one time  Exactly yeah   Oh you 're shocking  Where was Bruton from  Meath  Meath  Oh Meath right  And he shows it too  laughter  But uhm  What did he do today in his review  He was being interviewed  and he kept on and kept on saying  we can have no discussions with Labour  of any kind  they have declared a position on the principle  of would they  do business with a Government whose ministers  did not were were were collaborators et-cetera  Mmm  In the Taoiseach 's  deception of the Da/il  And he kept on repeating it  that there was no  no way around this and all that  which of course is  And what 's he trying to do  Basically just  highlight   He he he was  he was trying to  ob   Drive  a wedge between Fianna Fa/il and  Labour   Of course yeah  But he was also  doing as the interviewer said to him look he says I mean he says the interviewer says to him  eventually and rightly so  He says what you 're really saying is  that Dick Spring has to declare  he 'll be doing no business with Fianna Fa/il  before you 'll talk to him  and accordingly  if you like if he 's going to stay in Government he has to  kow-tow to you  Mm mm mm mm  Yeah  In other words you 're expecting him to burn his boats and his bridges  and you 're  laying down what the  what what the  what the Labour party thinking should be  before you will deign to talk to them  And of course the interviewer was quite right  But it means is that Bruton now can't  he 's ruled himself out because there 's no question of that  1 word   Mm mm mm   Well to be  I wouldn't think I wouldn't think Dick 'd be going for  uh an alliance with Fine Gael and Bruton  even though Dick might see himself then say in the  Taoiseach 's position  if Bruton was the other  the person   But he  but Bruton   He wouldn't  want to give it to him  But I I wouldn't think Dick 'd like Bruton as Taoiseach  No  But Bruton  4 sylls   But even if and one gets the impression that Fine Gael are anxious to get back into government  by this high-minded drawing a line in the sand et-cetera  there will be no talking  because the principles have got to be  declared  And he kept on repeating this stuff  It really means that he 's shutting himself out from real debate  because of course you 've got  to get around these things   Mm mm   That 's right yeah that 's right   Bertie was away streets ahead  which he is  as well as uhm  several sylls  we  we 're saying quite clearly  we accept we made a mistake  We 're not trying to back out of that  What we are asserting is that we  didn't realise the significance of the information  we hadn't time to assess it  and we did not intentionally  uh try to deceive Labour or the Da/il  But we know now that we have made a mistake in that matter  and we say it 's up to Dick Spring to either to accept  our veracity on that  4 sylls  and we 're just telling him the situation as it is in all honesty   several sylls   But at least  he was handling this thing in a way that real politics has to work  Mmm yeah   He wasn't holier than thou like Bruton has come across as  laughter   Sure Dick Spring in the position he 's in at the moment would be nuts  to say to John Bruton oh dear John  thank-you  laughter  I want to assure you I I 'll have nothing to do with those other  people   Now let 's talk  and the other guy saying you 're only getting two Ministers  laughter  Having the other  having Dick  burning his boats  Oh I 'd say within Fine Gael there 'll be a row about that  Mmm  Cos essentially they 're out in the cold  But they have no real real  charismatic leader   Well if they wanted to be out in the cold it might be a good strategy  but I don't think they do want to be out in the cold  Mm  They 're out in the cold a long time  That 's where they 'll be too  Cos if Labour and Fianna Fa/il can get together satisfactorily  and try to get proper structures into place  they 've money to deliver cos things are on a high in lots of ways  Mm  They 've nothing to do but gain  Tommy McEllistrim put it that way today when he was asked  wa  How interesting he was asked  They were taking Kerry as  as a kind of a sounding board as a constituency some of them  Oh  But so uh and Noel Brasil was kind of saying he wouldn't mind if Fianna Fa/il went into opposition soon  McEllistrim said that was a different head altogether  I think Smith is probably on his last term anyway  That uhm  it would be very  unwise of Bertie  in his view to  leave office at this time if a satisfactory arrangements can be made  It 's a good Government and they 're going ahead with a clear programme so  par  particularly when  we negotiated the structural funds  There 's six billion pounds there over the next few years  Why should we give it  should we give it to another crowd to distribute  laughter  It 's such a  2 sylls  It 's typical  It 's a good time to be there yeah   It 's absolutely typical because there 's another way of looking at it and that is that if Fianna Fa/il ever wanted another chance at all  of getting themselves in order and coming up with a defined definite policy for Fianna Fa/il and  long-term of ever hoping to be the sole Government as a party  again  they should go into opposition  Mm   Maybe  And I don't happen to think that Bertie is a national leader  Now maybe I hope I 'm wrong  but I don't think that he 'll bring the country with him  I think he may be a Dublin guy but he hasn't got what Charlie Haughey had at all  Well I don't think many of them  do to  be honest  Mmm   Do you would you like some tea  Yes please yeah  I think it 's made actually  Yes please  if you would  Will I pour out your water   Will you hand me your cup  I don't believe that old Robert Doherty is on anymore anyways  You you you 're probably right in this in the present circumstances  And if he 's a real problem I mean uh all of them despite themselves have to look at where they 're at and will they be back the next time and things like that  But some of them are coming to the end of their  their sell-by date and things like that  And there 's the fact that they want to hold on and who can blame them as individuals  But when you 're not involved it 's easy to look at the good of the party  And I mean I 'm not involved in that way  And I would I would actually think that from the party  objectively speaking from the party 's point of view  they could  do with a spell if not two in opposition  But Fianna Fa/il have never seen it like  that never   No  I know that  No I know that   But sure  no party likes to be in opposition anyway  Fianna Fa/il particularly  But then they have been in government so often  Yeah  Fine Gael were the ones that were constantly in opposition and they did nicely out of it too  But then they lost their heads when they went ahead and did stupid things like appointing their friends and their relatives and my God they 'd loaded the judiciary with people  friends you know  And the day they were leaving office they filled appointments  Indeedin the day he was leaving office Michael D did precisely that  Michael D was only in the office the first term  I know but the he the day he thought that the Government was dissolved before that morning  he appointed people on to boards  several sylls  Well I don't know why I was left out from a cup of tea  Cos you weren't finished  You were still having you dinner  Well I was chewing the chewing the rag  chewing bits of it  It was a lovely lunch dinner  Thank-you  Well I 'll tell you Bronwyn it 's against my principles to go to a pub on a Sunday night  but by God I 'm going tonight to hear what they all have to say  To stand up for the ould sod  for the oul green party  the soldiers of destiny   Absolutely   You can take it easy and enjoy your papers  Ah no I think she has the bit between her teeth  You 'll be sorry now tonight
