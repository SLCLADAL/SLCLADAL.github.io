<S1A-058 Holistic medicine 2>  She 's able to make all these  concessions to it like  But she 's was saying about the magnets that this guy  who she met at this conference had he goes around he travels around to all these conferences  I think he was American  but he had a rucksack specially made with a magnetic strip in the back so that when he had it the magnet was directly on his spine  And he claimed  this worked that if he didn't have this he wouldn't be able to travel  He wouldn't be able to walk without his spine would seize up  And then she met this other guy  who was doing experiments  Well that 's  still what I thought but this other guy is doing experiments with the different waters  to see  Cos apparently they say if you 're pregnant don't mix the waters  only  drink the north or the south but you don't mix the water from both  Does it work   That 's so psychological   Oh right   Oh   What you mean   When you 're drinking the stuff I don't know  just   So it 's  superior  intelligence if you drink the north  and lower intelligence if you drink the south  kind of thing   Drink     Just normal I think Rachel   No no it 's normal if you drink either   What do you mean north south Dublin   No you see  laughter  you missed the first part  The the huge big magnets she has she puts them  at some stage in the day she puts a glass of water  on the south pole of one and the second glass of water on the north pole of the other  And then she mixes the water and drinks the water  No north and  south   And apparently   That 's Michelle 's fault  It is not  laughter   I want to get out of here as quickly as I can  I don't want to go near the north side  Ah hang on now I just said I 'd just  feel safer  once I 'm on the south side  You 're a snob   Yeah which meant  A down and out snob that 's all  Sorry my mum 's from the north side I can't  laughs   So 's Maire 's  Oh no your dad is  No mum is  My dad 's from the west   My dad 's from the north side   He 's from where  He 's from Crumlin so he 's  a gentleman   Oh  I thought you meant I thought you meant the west of Ireland  It 's not really the south side at all  But Maire doesn't know outside the Pale  you see  Very  limited  No no   Where 's Galway  No I like Galway actually I 've been there  Been there just once   Been there done that   I can find it on the map  It 's the smaller places like  Mayo and that that I can't quite locate  laughter   And what about Tipperary  Where do you think Tipperary is  That 's in the middle isn't it cos it doesn't have a coastline  Mmm yeah not really middle  That 's that 's uhm  what 's the county that Athlone 's in  Offaly  Mm  Yeah  Is it  Yeah course it is  Roisin thinks  laughs   Haven't  a clue   Ah it is  It is  It is  Anyway there 's this guy doing experiments with the different water from the north pole  laughter   From the north south right you put the water the water at the north pole of the magnet and some  water right   He mixes the  penguins with the polar bears  You have two magnets  What  He mixes the penguins with the polar bears  Okay  laughter   You 've two  magnets right  Big round things like that  okay  And you know the way magnets have separate poles  Mm   Mm  Right so on one magnet you leave it with the north pole up and put the glass on top north pole and the other magnet you leave with the south pole up put the glass to the south pole  Mm hmm  So you mix the water in the morning  This guy took the two waters  he 's doing experiments to see of there is a difference like and apparently this is even funnier like it 's not really scientific at all but apparently if you soak bread in north water and then soak bread in south water one goes  laughter   Uh what  One goes  laughter   What  One goes  laughter   She can't get it out  It must be good  It goes mouldy quicker  laughter   The bread  One pole  laughter   So that 's why there 's so much famine in the southern hemisphere  laughter   What 's that got to do with the price of bread  laughter   But anyway   Moving swiftly onwards  Well there 's this woman at work and she 's got really I think it 's arthritis anyway cos her hands it 's awful  It 's really bad I don't know how she works cos she 's a cook  in the canteen like  Mm  And her hands are all  deformed   Tastes  nice  laughter   I don't eat in the  cantee  well I eat in the canteen but I also bring my own food  Is this mine  Is there good variety of food  you can have sausages sausages or sausages  With beans  be  well we never get beans then  Ah no  Deprived  There 's no there 's lasagne or there 's  shepherd 's pie or  uhm chicken  It 's chicken there 's more fat than chicken on and bones and  tendons and  Skin  Ugh yeah  Yuck  Sasha  Did you enjoy that film though  Ah yeah yeah  I thought it was so far-fetched  Yeah but you had to laugh at it cos it was kind of funny  Yeah  I don't know  I didn't think they 'd get together in the end  I didn't think she 'd marry him  Well they kept getting it together  and it went on   And then I always  thought but no well  I always thought when she was with him though that it was because she felt sorry for him and because  she felt kind of more protected   No I thought it wasn't  from the very beginning that it wasn't that was why  Oh when  when they were sitting on the tree  When she  put his hand when she put her hand on his  Yeah   But the whole time even when she said like  you know when they were older and when  he 'd go and visit visit her in college  Yeah  I thought she really treated him like an equal that she didn't feel sorry for him  That 's why she  But then why did she say oh you don't know the meaning  I mean you can't understand  Because he couldn't  No she didn't she didn't mean you can't understand love  We   She did  She said something like  you don't know what it means or   She said something like that  I thought she meant more like you don't know what it means to me  rather than  No I don't  I don't know  I don't know   maybe not to analyse it  2 sylls  this week  Ah well   I always think  I always thought she was just feeling sorry for him and kind of  not all the  time I thought  there was  something there like   No I thought   I thought it was really  really sad when he  looked at his kid and said is he  Yeah  And he didn't want to say is he stupid because  What did he say  Well he  began to say   Is he normal or something   He he said  is he clever or  or is he and he didn't finish it like  Yep  Yeah  She was anorexically thin bones ribs and everything was sticking out all over the place  Disgusting  I thought she was going to throw herself off the building  You see I didn't think they 'd get together  And I thought  that in the end that she 'd throw herself off the building   Pretending to fly  Yeah well  See the shoes  They 're like the  shoes that Teresa wears  There 's this girl that I was in Germany with  she brought five pairs of platforms  Oh God   I don't know how  people walk in those   On on holiday  Well it 's not it was a working holiday but I mean  they were black  They were winter shoes  They weren't you know  they weren't   Did she bring  anything else  well she had  a pair of runners  yeah  One pair one pair of  of platforms were kind of sandaly the other  two were shoes and there was another that wasn't really anything  It was just you know  wa  they were hush puppies and they were bright yellow  laughs  and they were cork cork kind of  heels  And it was they were so strange like  you know uh  I mean the  height  I mean your feet couldn't  possibly  She said I mean she never felt comfortable in anything else  Mm   Yeah   You 're standing on you tippy toes like  laughs   I know I know  Just there that that woman 's shoes reminded me of it  Uh when I was trying on my dress like  Th  you know the way they had loads of shoes  there  I tried on well they only had size five  and I was standing on my  tip toes   Yeah   What size  are you  Don't ask  Well no you look like you 've a big foot  Big foot  Size four  That 's not a size four shoe  It is  Really  Look by comparison with her  laughs   Exactly  Well Rachel 's floppers are an exception  My my flippers you know carry around an ould snorkel there  But anyway  tell us about the dress  Oh the dress it 's uhm  I don't know whether I  I I don't believe you said that Rachel  Cute   It 's what  I don't like that word   I hate it  Thank-you Roisin thank-you thank-you   I hate that word cute and  it 's always being used to describe me and  Okay I may be cute but I mean you know  laughter   There comes a point where everything you touch becomes cute when Rachel seems  no cute describes you /[>  Ah no it 's a lovely  dress  It 's just short  What colour is it  It 's black with a white sort of band there  and white band around the  bottom  It 's real cocktailyish  So it 's all black except the top and the bottom  It just goes  straight  across there and that  Around   Around your shoulders  just around there and this out at the waist  down to the knees  How much is it  It 's kind of expensive is it  Forty-five quid  Though it 's quite quite cheap actually  you know to hire a dress  Where was this  In Belle of the Ball  What 's that what 's that place called  Kildare Street  Wicklow Street  Dawson Street   No between  Kildare Street and Dawson Street  going up to Setanta Place  Oh  It 's a little small one  upstairs   Mm   Blue   Oh yeah I was up there once but they 're all very uhm  worn-looking   Yeah they  no this well I didn't think she uhm  hires many out really  But sure then what 's the  business   Depends on  the time of year though  that you go to them that   Yeah you 'd think though this  would be a really busy time  The dress has been there  okay maybe she 's had it out since I 've seen it but she was going to alter it for me and she was  going to have it ready by Monday  I can take it on Thursday  and I don't have to have it in until like the following Monday  Yeah  So you know where 's her business  I thought these dresses were out  the whole time   So what  is she doing then   presumably   Well she has a  huge collection though doesn't she  Yeah she does  She has quite a lot  But are they old-fashioned like
