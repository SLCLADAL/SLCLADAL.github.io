<S1B-055 Multi-party talks 2>  Mr Chairman  I rise to uh support our party 's amendment and I also would like to say Mr Chairman I not like many other people I don't believe that we have peace  I believe we 're still in a state of war  We 're not fighting the IRA or the  Protestant paramilitaries are not using their weapons the way that they used to use them but they 're using other techniques which is still going on in our province  And in the area that I represent there 's still many people beat up and uh or persecuted because they don't toe the line  And we all know that within the two political parties the uhm the PUP and the UDP there 's still not unity amongst them in their ranks and we know that there 's hard feelings against their leaders and what they 're trying to achieve here and that 's why we have the the the heaval amongst them today because many of them believe that they 're going down the the the wrong road  Now I believe in democracy  Unfortunately  uh Mr Chairman as we all uh uh did not agree to this form of election that the British Government have apposed upon us  we had no other or way to get out of it only fight this election on the uh the way the British Government allowed us to  Unfortunately  me  I mean I must rebuke Hugh Smyth  He keeps telling us that he topped the poll  He didn't top the poll at all  He only got one thousand nine hundred votes  Now you had you had to be about on the ground that day because if you had to go out on the Shankill Road the two paramilitary wings you had that many people on the ground uh nobody could else could move  and yet they did not achieve the vote they 'd expected  When I seen them I said  I said to the my workers  boy well they 'll have about four thousand votes the two  The whole five of them  all my five workers  I 'm not  I 'm being honest about it  My five workers  And uh and all that the team that they had  And the big fancy cars and vans and so on  I don't know where they got the money from like  let me say this  and yet they did not achieve what they want  The Democratic Unionist Party came second with seventeen hundred votes  Pretty good  comparing it with only a small number of people out working and couldn't get all the people that we want  The Ulster Unionists got fourteen hundred  The big UDA we all talk about only got eight hundred votes  with all their fancy  boos from Members  fancy posters and so forth  Will the speaker give way  No I 'm not giving way  are we getting to the point  I never I never interrupted anybody all day  laughter  I was a very good a very good wee boy  and  listened to everybody   several sylls    Yes    Mr  Mr Smyth   Mr Smyth the election was on the thirtieth of May  Today is the fourth of October  Could we stick  to today  We 're told  we 're told Chairman that the Shankill is the heartline of the paramilitary  stronghold  That is nonsense as it 's been said  because the vote shows it  that over three thousand three hundred voted for the democratic parties and only two thousand seven hundred  voted  for these other people  Nonsense   What about Gerry Adams   Well I 'm not worrying Gerry uh Gerry Adams  Gerry Adams is  you know where I stand where Gerry Adams is concerned  Well let me tell you Chairman  Let us be honest  I have been under the boot to these fellas  There 's a man sitting there behind me there  had to come to my house and protest  That 's the type of democratic voting he talked about  And I laugh when I see some of them on the TV who I helped to get bungalows and houses and some of them when they were arrested in jail were glad of my reference to help them get them out  And some of them even  some of them even sent some of them even sent for me to bail them out bail them out  But what they but them people tell me they were under threat  They were told they had to be there  But listen  Chairman  they 've no consent about uh uh uh my wife and my  my little  my two handicapped children which them thugs were outside my house spitting and kicking my door at that day  Well that 's the type of thing we 're talking about  Well we must give these people the  4 sylls  IRA  Now the people of Northern Ireland have spoken  The British Government made this election to suit these people  They were up in Stormont for months beforehand uh talking uh  to anything  They were making deals  And what happened was that the British Government didn't come across with the deal and the poor men behind the bars today are the ones that suffered and are suffering because the deals did not come across  Nonsense  And so therefore these people have let them down because they 've looked after themselves  And let me tell you this uh Mr Chairman  that people  I shouldn't even be here today  That 's true  Because democratically th' election is not right  The people   be here is the people who got the vote and passed the the the quota and should be elected in here  Now in saying that  I would 've been here if I had 've stood in North Belfast where I should 've stooden  but I decided  Mr Smyth this is most entertaining but it 's it 's getting it 's getting a little far away from from the uh from supporting your party 's motion which  we 're coming very close to  Can I say this  Can I say this  That the people of Northern Ireland have spoken  They have said  and we 're the only party have made it very clear that we 're  were at war for decommission  made it very clear to the voters in my area in which I stand up and stood at that election and our people voted according to their conscience and the people say  we want the guns off the streets and we want a democratic politics to work in Northern Ireland  and that 's what the people have said in this election  But unfortunately  unfortunately the British Government and the E/ire Government and other people who who tell the people one thing and then change their mind and do another  they are the ones  they are the ones who are going to bring this process to a  a a halt  For we have made it clear where we stand  Now I believe when peace will come  in righteousness and truth  Hear-hear  I believe  peace will come when men confess  I know men who 're doing time today because they were converted and came to Christ and gave themselves up because of the crime that they have  uh have committed  And you 're going to tell me as our  some of our colleagues have mentioned of policemen and Army people today who are standing with are  are with no arms  no legs  part of their bodies blown up  shot and so forth and them people are saying  oh keep your guns  We want peace on them terms  And everybody knows we remember it during the War and I wasn't there  I wasn't even born probably  But I remember reading and we were told that the Prime Minister come with a bit of paper  Germany will not attack   And they did attack  And what we 're saying is the   Labour Party telling us that  oh we 'll give these people their way and there 'll be peace  For how long Chairman  Another ten fifteen years  Then our children and our grandchildren will see the same thing that we have suffered for twenty-six year in this province because we have a weak government who will not deal with the men of violence and put them out of the systems and out of the road and let the true good honest  Ulster people live in peace both Roman Catholic and  Protes  who wants to live and get on with  their lives in this province  Now the Labour Party said earlier  Does that does that include the Labour Party  The Labour Party said earlier that  several sylls  But he must be to blame  2 sylls  he 's a lot older than me  He 's one of the causes then that he has created in this province for the like of me who knew nothing about it til I was born and reared into the Province  of the the the Troubles of this country  But the  the trouble of this country has not been made by us  It 's been made by those who are enemies against the British way of life in this land and so there Mr Chairman we cannot allow  That 's a very sweeping statement  Are you giving way to Mr Casey  Seeing as this is being recorded I 'd like to know what I 've done that I 'm the cause of all this  unclear simultaneous speech between $A and $D, muffled by noise from Members   Read the rules and see that when the Chairman is standing everybody sits down  Sit down  Sit down  And sit down Mr Smyth too  It 's that kind of scene which I 'm not going to live with  As long as I 'm Chairman and I 'm only Chairman here as long as seventy-five percent of you don't vote me out  I will not have that kind of altercation taking place  You have one more minute Mr Smyth  Thank-you Chairman  Sit down  simultaneous and unclear   Right Mr Smyth  You 've one more minute  Mr Chairman uh uh could I explain myself  Sorry Chairman I want to explain myself  One more minute that 's all  What I what I meant was his generation before my generation herited and passed it on  That 's what I am saying  And he didn't deal with it in his day so he needn't accuse our generation today when their generation didn't deal with it either  That 's what we 're saying  Chairman  let me say this  The people that I represent  have made it very clear to me and I live on the Shankill and I walk up and down it and I meet all sorts of people  from Ulster Unionists  from the  paramilitaries  and I may not agree with them but I 've some good friends and I respect them and they tell me that they don't want to go back to them days and they 're prepared to give up their weapons if their leadership would only lead them and say  we 're giving them up and we 're going to go in to democratic politics and do what the people want  It 's about time that the politicians listened to their people  And that 's what we did at our party  We 're here representing the views of the people and we will not change our minds but we believe that the guns must go for the future of our country  Thank-you very much   Hear-hear  Mr Peter Robinson what I 'm now going to do is to call the three last speakers  who will be who from the Alliance  2 sylls  Mr Robinson  Lord Alderdice and Mr uh Mr Taylor to make the final speeches and then we 'll go to voting on a motion which will require a sixty-six percent vote  uh and will be uh in terms of Rule thirteen-one  the famous Rule thirteen-one  Mr Robinson  On a point of order sir are you calling both amendments  Yes  Thank-you  Mr Chairman uh I was uh only a a young lad of seventeen when what is euphemistically described as the Troubles began uh in Northern Ireland  Uh indeed uh I can recall uh that I had a lot more interest in a a young girl who was only a few months younger than me than I had  i  in politics  Uh I had uh no interest in politics at all uh until a young friend of mine was killed by the Provisional IRA  and it was that action which jolted me uh towards politics and provided the incentive uh and the reason why I entered the political process  Uh I grew up in an area where the Provisional IRA almost on a a weekly basis uh would come in  leave a car bomb outside somebody 's home uh  or go in and shoot someone until eventually people in that area uh like uh areas throughout Belfast as a whole  but the Province in general uh used to put vigilantes out on the streets to protect their own areas  Uh along with many others uh I stood and uh gave up my sleep to stand on the barricades with the vigilantes in my area to stop IRA incursions uh into the district  And eventually those vigilantes uh became more organised informed and eventually became some of the paramilitary organisations that we have in our Province  And many of the people uh who stood along with me at those barricades uh chose the path of going into paramilitary organisations  So I come from a background which understands how many people entered into those Loyalist paramilitary organisations  and I can recognise all too clearly that if there had not been the violence of the Provisional IRA  or if on the other hand there had been proper and effective measures taken by our government  and not just the Conservative and Labour governments but even before that  the Ulster Unionist government at Stormont  if there had been those effective measures I don't believe we would have had the spectre of Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland
