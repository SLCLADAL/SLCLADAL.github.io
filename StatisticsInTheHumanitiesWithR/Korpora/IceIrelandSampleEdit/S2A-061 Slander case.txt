<S2A-061 Slander case>  Can I turn uh My Lord to the Notice for Particulars  uhm page six and also the Replies uh on page fifteen  If it please Your Lordship uhm the  3 sylls  case  You will see My Lord at five three  uhm the words used to make the false accusation are as follows  the girl was in receipt of items bought  petrol was bought at the same time but was not paid for  several sylls  So it wasn't actually the word theft used and in fact the defendant  4 sylls  for this application  there wasn't an accusation of theft made  it was just simply that you drove off  you forgot to pay  2 sylls  Uhm  clears throat  I want to move now  clears throat  uh to line six the defendant cannot say precisely how many other customers were in the filling station when the accusation was made  In the second set of Replies if Your Lordship pleases  if you turn to page twenty-one  she would then say at that stage that she believes that reply one there were at least three or four customers in the premises  And uhm that reply two of the second Replies  she says that she believes  Wha  what was question two  I see the reply  What was question two  I think it was how many people heard  Yes  Uhm it stated approximately the number of customers that the plaintiff believes could have heard the words and uhm she believes that the exchange was a short distance from those other customers so it  the height of her case is that there was publication to three or four people  She doesn't allege any reaction by those people  Turning back to the first set of Replies  uhm she says at seven  several sylls  customers  and at eight  this is dealing with the damage to her reputation  it says her reputation had been damaged and an accusation had been made in that she was a dishonest person who made off without paying for petrol  The plaintiff is a district nurse of unblemished character  enjoys the highest reputation in her neighbourhood and beyond and such words of accusation severely tarnished that reputation  Having said that if you read nine  several sylls  Now if Your Lordship pleases  it doesn't plead uh any adverse reaction spoken to her or of any evidence that she can have of any such incident  So it is  Sorry of any  Of of any such incident  that that any evidence can be given of such as one of the customers telling somebody else and making a comment about it  And as she is a district nurse out and about in the locality  one would have thought if there had been any adverse effect  at least one person would have mentioned it to her  and that of course then would have been pleaded  And at reply eleven  the plaintiff says she was probably kept and detained at the said premises  4 sylls  for about five minutes  So that would appear to be the  the height of  the length of the incident  And she then goes on at reply twelve  several sylls  The Plaintiff was compelled to remain in the premises despite having no wish to do so  And fourteen  it 's not alleged that any words were expressed  several sylls  and her freedom of movement thereby inhibited  if Your Lordship pleases  again turning to the second set of Replies on page uhm twenty-one  uhm reply three if Your Lordship  pleases my question I asked  1 syll  precise particulars of the explanation of the plaintiff  1 syll  of her innocence  This is a matter of evidence  The Plaintiff cannot remember the precise  several syllables  the car registration was written in manuscript on the receipt  several sylls  By reason of these clear assertions of her innocence the Plaintiff made it obvious that she had been quite freely and correctly identified by the two individuals  She provided a full explanation of her innocence and the circumstances in which it was clear to her that the two accusers did not believe her protestations of innocence  But still  if Your Lordship pleases  uhm the words of accusation are as clear as the first reply  petrol was got at the same time but was not paid for  She doesn't allege that her accusers as she describes them went on to say  that 's wrong or we don't accept your explanation  or anything of that nature  several sylls  she believes she was touched on the shoulder  in in my submission  if Your Lordship pleases  in terms of any slander  at most the publication  4 sylls  was three or four people  It appears to have been not one but two sentences set out in the Replies  In my submission it was nothing other than uhm an invitation to the court to infer some damage to her reputation  But we 've got no specific evidence of that and in my submission  it would appear that she may well be be  at at the height of her claim  entitled to nominal damages for the slander  Or if it 's more than that it 'll be something very very modest indeed  And if she establishes uh false imprisonment  uhm the damages to which she 'll be entitled for less than five minutes uh would in my submission be in the order of a few hundred pounds and therefore this is a case which uh clearly uh could rest comfortably in the County Court  Yes  My Lord the jurisdiction for slander in the County Court is three thousand pounds  And my respectful  In slander is it  In slander  That 's the plaintiff 's main cause of action My Lord and I submit that there are several causes of action but the main cause of action here is clearly slander  It is a modest amount My Lord and in my respectful submission there are a number of features in this case which indicate that that modest amount would not be sufficient  I appreciate My Lord that if the matter is remitted to the County Court judge  several sylls  that figure of three thousand pounds  but then for this court to apply My Lord is  for the three thousand pounds uhm could properly uhm compensate the plaintiff in all the circumstances  There are a number of features My Lord in my respectful submission which indicate that the slander in this case is sufficient uhm to keep the matter in the High Court  that there is the  the unchallenged uh pleading that the plaintiff is a lady  forty-six years of age of unblemished character  She 's a district nurse in the locality  the incident occurred close to her home  It was an incident which occurred in full public view  there was no attempt My Lord  nor is it pleaded that there was any attempt by the defendant to bring the plaintiff into a private area to make uhm the assertions to her which were made  Uhm in relation to the assertions which in fact were made My Lord  the reply in relation to the Further and Better Particulars twenty-six indicates a challenge for the purposes of  3 sylls  My Lord  that there were a number of matters which the plaintiff protested uhm in her innocence  in relation to biscuits  in relation to the car registration number  in relation to the coat that she was wearing  in relation to the fact that diesel was taken and not unleaded petrol  In my respectful submission My Lord  3 sylls  the flavour certainly of conversation whereby  or of an incident whereby uhm her protestation of innocence is not immediately accepted uhm and if it is accepted at all  which we say it wasn't  it was very grudgingly accepted  The position My Lord also  There was an apology  Is that right  Well it it is  the defendants drafted it in terms that there was an apology uhm the plaintiff 's case uhm is that an apology in rather grudging terms was made not by the manageress of the shop who was the main accuser  but in fact by the assistant who had come over to her  But she would say that the apology was made at the end of this uh rather lengthy and unpleasant conversation uhm and it was one which was made grudgingly and it was not a fulsome apology as one would have expected  My Lord what I would say in relation to uh the plaintiff 's case in terms of the spread of the slander  it would appear that at its height there may only have been three or four people  The plaintiff can't be absolutely sure for her mind was distracted  and not  to the number of customers about  But if there were only three or four people about  it doesn't mean My Lord of course that those three or four people had not overheard what had been said and not talked among themselves  It 's a small community uhm and the mere fact that the plaintiff cannot give evidence at this stage My Lord that someone had approached her and said oh I heard you were accused of stealing petrol  it 's unlikely in my respectful submission that someone would say that to her  It 's quite obviously  yes My Lord  that someone might know that about her and not say it or be too embarrassed to say it  And so far as the plaintiff 's concerned My Lord  uhm she just simply doesn't know who has heard about this and who may have heard about it  who may have discounted it knowing that she 's a person of unblemished character but who may have certain feelings that there 's no smoke without fire  And in my respectful submission My Lord  if the jurisdiction is only three thousand pounds  as it is  then a case of this nature couldn't be heard properly in the County Court  Uhm there are other factors in the case which may be a few hundred pounds I accept  but added to that and added to the slander My Lord  in my respectful submission this is a case which clearly should be made in the High Court  I face on behalf on the plaintiff My Lord the penalty obviously that if this matter is subsequently adjudicated  that that figure would change within the County Court jurisdiction and of course  several sylls  but in my respectful submission My Lord the case taken at a reasonable height should not be remitted  It 's for the defendant to establish that the case should be remitted  and that a reasonable jury or a reasonable judge could not find for the defendant  uhm such a figure of three thousand pounds  Uh it was a disturbing and unpleasant incident for a lady  a middle-aged lady who is a professional lady in the community and in my respectful submission My Lord  that is a case which should remain in the High Court  And it isn't in my respectful submission even a case in which uhm there may be some doubt as the the level of damage  I would respectfully submit to you My Lord that the case is clearly within the High Court 's jurisdiction   Yeah I 'm just looking at paragraph four of the defence which alleges that the allegations are true in substance and in fact and then goes on to have an apology  I mean is that   I know pleadings in in defamation cases are very odd  Can you do that  Plead  3 sylls  to the fact and an apology at the same time  Yes because the defence in terms is that the conversation did take place  Yes  But the accusation of theft was not made  I see yes  It was an error  it was a mistake was made  Yes  Rather than saying  you you deliberately drove off without paying  Yes  What the defendants were saying was  you drove off by mistake and forgot  Yes I see  Now you were going to say something  I was going to say My Lord that if if the  the plaintiff seriously makes the case that her reputation  her previously unblemished reputation has been tarnished and if she has been embarrassed and distressed and upset as she pleads  one would have anticipated an affidavit appearing from her  for the purposes of this application to set out those issues  Well I think the average juror would accept that she would have been distressed I would have thought  several sylls   Well I think most people  most people would be fairly annoyed I would have thought  They mightn't break down in tears but they 'd be fairly angry I would have thought  Yes but then My Lord moves on to  to what level that is set at  The jury will have the benefit of hearing the evidence of the plaintiff  assessing that  Your Lordship is left with the pleadings and not an affidavit which in my submission if there had been any significant issue  an affidavit would have been available before the Master  And this same point is raised in front of the master  but still there was no affidavit before Your Lordship  Yes well in view of the fact that the limit is three thousand uh pounds I take a view different from the Master  I consider that it 's not likely that this would lie within the jurisdiction of the County Court  Accordingly I reverse the Order of the learned Master  with costs here and below  And while I 'm not hearing the case and having heard the evidence I would have thought it was about five thousand pounds  I don't know if that might shorten the matter but  It might well  it might well be worth a great deal more a great deal less depending what way the evidence goes and what witnesses were called but if I was asked on paper to assess it  I would have thought it was about five thousand pounds  Yeah  I 'll send you my bill  laughter
