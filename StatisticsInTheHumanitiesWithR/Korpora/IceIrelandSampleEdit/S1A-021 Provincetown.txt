<S1A-021 Provincetown>  So Daniel  what about Scotland  It was really really good  Did the weather hold up for you  Not too bad  It drizzled a few days but I mean that 's expected over there  You know  It was very relaxing  And did you find nice places to stay  Actually old sort of taverns and  And the wedding  The wedding was great  Survived  Delighted to be back I 'm sure  Hmm  Delighted to be back  Oh horrible  absolutely horrible  laughter  Words can't describe the depth of my misery laughter   Oh dear  Is it really that bad  laughter  Can't describe the depths laughter   Let 's talk about proportion Later in conversation   I was in Provincetown  Were you never in Provincetown  Is that a gay suburb in  laughter   Provincetown in uhm  Provincetown north of Boston  This guy brought us there  Uh he was plying drink on us  The whole place was given over to gay people  Gay and lesbian people  And uh  Is it Cape Cod  is it Cape Cod Provincetown    Provincetown yeah   Oh I 've been in Provincetown  simultaneous and unclear speech   It 's the sort of place where you see these guys all wearing leather gear you know and they 've chains on them  You see men dressed as women  And uhm he had arranged to meet us in this  like a club  What you  laughter   There were four or five of us  We were drinking in the place and uh  I noticed these people walking hand-in-hand past us  They were similar  same sex  people walking in  There was music and dancing  I like the way you nearly said similar sex there  laughter   But the females  the females went off  females went off into one room and the males went off into another  Really  The funny thing was  several sylls  laughter   All standing looking at each other  And then these guys try to you know they try to get you in to  Discos  sparkly ballroom   One of the guys  you see we were sitting at the bar drinking and one of the guys was balding you see and he was leaning back like and this guy kissed him on the head  Oh no  He was livid  I 'm sure he was  He was raging  So that was Provincetown  We got out of it fast laughter   Oh God  And who 's this that had played the trick on you  It was a chap that we  we stayed with over there in Boston  There 's a lot to be said for reading your guidebook  Hmm  There 's a lot to be said for reading your guidebook  Oh there is  We were totally innocent  But it 's a well-known place actually  Yeah there was somebody  several sylls  and she lived there for like six months or something as part of the community  several sylls   the place is actually called Provincetown rather  than the pub   It 's Provincetown  No it 's Provincetown it 's called  Oh I thought that  laughs    several words    It 's strange how a town like that  it 's strange how it 's totally devoted to this kind of thing now  Then maybe if people don't want to be so overtly gay in in a major city because of the discrimination it 's  maybe easier for them to go   Well that poor guy  that poor guy was killed here because of it  But I think it 's awful it has  to be so closet here  You don't know that though do you   Hmm  You don't know that  It must be though  They must be very sure of it because of  the way it was  reported and stuff  Aye but they can't really say   Yeah  several sylls   But because of the way the newspaper articles are written  I think they must  you know they must be fairly sure  But I think it 's awful that people have to be so covert here  I mean if you walk through Soho in London and there are men holding hands and just  you know  it 's just normal  People just get on with it  Yeah but there 's a hell of a religious background here  you know that it would be  it 's hard to overcome   Oh I know that  I know  simultaneous and unclear speech   It 's quite sad   Probably a bit too close to home as well  Especially for  me  Round the corner  Yeah   Och no but you wouldn't worry about that  No but at the same time it 's  there 's been more and more things in South Belfast  You know  3 sylls   and stuff   Murders and things  Aye  Yeah  That 's what I was saying you know about to you earlier  the guy in our garden last year  A guy in your garden  Yeah   A guy  that was murdered and he was in our back  in our rear yard  Oh I didn't realise that that was so close  to you   Mhm  Yeah  We were overlooking it cos the night  I went out to put  out my bins one night and he would 've been lying in  in the bushes  They got someone for it though   gasp  Oh no   Imagine   And I had no idea  That 's desperate  Oh that 's a horrible thought  But they 're clearing that all out now  They 've diggers and everything in it  you know  to clear it except it 's really heavy vegetation and like that 's where he was found  But then again though  then the house across which is like Serpentine Avenue  several sylls   Aye and then it was burnt down  I can't remember  cos I was  cos I wasn't in Belfast when it happened  It was around Christmas  time  What was burnt down  simultaneous and unclear speech   They tried to burn the house  They tried to burn the house or something  Oh right  But I think there was that much damage they 've knocked the house down and rebuilt it or gutted it or something simultaneous and unclear speech   I always wondered what happened to that house you remember that that girl Maria McConnell was murdered in  Yeah   Mhm   I wonder were they ever able to  Was that the Holy Lands one  Yeah   Yeah   I remember talking to someone one night who lived next door and  you know when the whole thing had happened and they  they moved out  They  just didn't want to be there  Yeah   Horrible thought  But I wonder  you 'd think that they might just have to pull the house down because who really would want to live there  Yeah  People forget though  You 'd get students who would go into it  They wouldn't know   But it 'll turn into  you know sort of one of those things that 'll never be talked about  I think students would move into the house  Yeah I think they would  I think  several sylls   Then again just because something bad happened there doesn't necessarily  you know  Yeah but would you want to be living in it  I 'm not superstitious but I would not want to live in  or I would not want to have as a bedroom a room where someone had been brutally murdered  No I suppose   thought of what went on in that room   Why do you believe in ghosts   well I don't not believe in ghosts  I don't know  I mean some very sensible people have told me that they 've seen ghosts  I hope to God I never see one  laughs   I thought I saw one one time  Did you  It was ridiculous  It was probably just a trick of light  But we were sitting in  yeah  in Donnybrook Street and we had an upstairs flat and   several sylls    Donnybrook  Donnybrook  that 's down off the Lisburn Road yeah  It is yeah  uhm  but it had a big bay window and there was one of the chairs sort of sat facing the bay window and I never sat in that chair  I always sat on the sofa  And this one night I was sitting there  I never pull the curtains  And all the girls  Were you sitting in the dark  I was sitting watching TV  And all the girls were sitting there and they were all chatting away and then I looked up and looked in the window and over my right shoulder there was somebody standing behind me  I looked round  oh my God  and then turned round and there was nothing there  I could see it in the window but there was obviously  I mean it was a trick of the light  You could see the window  You could see the reflection in the window  laughter   What did the person look like  What did the person look like  I don't know  I just know it was a figure standing behind me  I didn't you know I didn't look long enough to see laughter    It could have been somebody standing outside then  No cos we were on the first floor  You know we didn't  Oh right  Right  I think your mind plays tricks  Yeah  See I always  I don't know about that simultaneous and unclear speech   Always close the curtains  Never look in the mirror after twelve o'clock laughter   I 'm always waiting for someone to pop their head up behind me when I 'm brushing my teeth at night  laughter   But would you be worried  Would you be worried  Yeah  They don't do any harm to anybody do they  Ghosts  I always felt better about it after uhm you know the Bruce Willis film  Oh yeah   Sixth Sense   Because they were actually all   ghosts   They were all nice  They just were a bit troubled simultaneous and unclear speech   Och no well she was just troubled you know she was just looking for some kind of resolution  I know what you mean  They weren't these evil spirits  Yeah  Yeah  I always felt a bit better after watching that  I 'd be more scared of a real person than a ghost to be honest  you know  Yeah  If there was somebody in my house   Yeah  Quite right
