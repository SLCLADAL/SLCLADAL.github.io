<S1B-029 Belfast life>  From the earliest days people had very mixed ideas about cities  There are strong hints that the earliest bible writers  neither liked nor trusted city life  At the same time nobody can deny that cities pull together great forces for human advancement  culture and learning law and administration  But maybe the Old Testament Bible writers had an instinct that was right  for cities have much that is sad and sordid  Today these tensions are clearly evident in Belfast  Many marvellous things are happening  In spite of the hammering it has taken  Belfast buzzes  But there 's also squalor and crime and violence and loneliness  So for many people  the big B stings  To help us understand these two faces of the city  I 'm joined today by Father Matt Wallace from St Peter 's Cathedral on the Falls Road  Paul Daragh medical doctor  and Secretary of Townsend Street Presbyterian Church on the Lower Shankill  Brendan Murtagh formerly with the Housing Executive  and Stanley McDowell former Town Clerk of Belfast  Stanley McDowell you would know as much about the city and its administration as anybody else here  Can you tell us what are the key factors that really make up a city 's complex life  Thank-you David  I think before moving to answer that question I would like to pick up the point you made about the Biblical analysis  I 'm conscious that the gospel starts in a garden  but ends in a city  And if you go through to Revelation you 'll find that the culmination of the Biblical record  is in a city  what lessons we draw from that I 'm not quite sure but I think it has a relevance to our discussion  It 's a city of course where the standards are very different from those of Belfast  I think also I would like to say that there are problems in other communities not least in rural communities  And you mentioned squalor crime violence and loneliness and I 'm sure that those pertain in the rural areas  But let 's turn to Belfast  always with the caveat that we mustn't think ourselves peculiar or unique  In the City Council is a very necessary part of the government of the city at a variety of levels  It has an executive role where it provides services for the citizens to allow them to fulfil their interests and follow their pursuits  and enrich their lives  It has an enforcement role which ensures that a minimum standard of public hygiene  is maintained  And you only have to look at uh cities where the infrastructure has failed as in the former Yugoslavia  to realise the importance of that  The council also has a representational role  in making government aware of the needs of the citizens needs in relations to the services which the council itself does not provide  It has a  consultative and ceremonial role  So it undertakes uh a variety of roles  seeking to provide to the citizens  the standards and the environment  which will allow them to do their thing  So it looks after more than graveyards and garbage by a long bit  Oh very much so  Uh I think uh it 's unfortunate that perhaps  those are focused on when there is much which it does to ensure the quality of life so that we can go about  uh confident that public health will as a very minimum   2 sylls    One of  the things that we 'll be exploring in this particular programme is to see just how well they succeed in Belfast  Paul Daragh your work 's in the city  You 're very much a city man  Is your heart in the city  Absolutely  Uh I was born in the city  I had my formative years have been spent in the city  and I 've worked in the city  Uh and though I choose to live outside the city  I spend most of my leisure time actually back working in the city  I think this is a wonderfully optimistic time uh for work in the cities  And uh some allusion there was to the problems of the city  but let 's remember that ninety percent of the population of Western Europe is going to be living in cities  by the turn of this century  It is most important that we enjoy and celebrate  the virtues of the city  the genius  the industry  the vibrancy the excitement  There is so much going on in a city  Yes there are bad things  but there are also good things  And we should also see the city  in relation to all other cities in this world  because many many cities have far worse problems than ours  and survive and continue to to change and improve  Brendan Murtagh uh an optimistic a buoyant mood of the city there  Now your particular interest is housing  And I would think that ninety percent of the people of Europe can't live in cities unless there 's adequate housing for them  And is there a great need for new and better housing in in in Belfast and if it is  suppry  supplied can ordinary people  then find an attractive lifestyle within the city  Yes I think they can  Uhm the  housing problems of Belfast go go back a long way  The industrial revolution led to  the development of a lot of cramped poor  poor quality squalid housing  Now when the uhm major redevelopment programmes and road programmes cleared those houses  in the late seventies and early nineteen-eighties  it replaced them with often unsuitable and substandard housing themselves  Now city planners have learnt from those mistakes in Belfast  and have started to develop a range and quality of housing provision  that is very much suited to the individual needs and aspirations and lifestyles of the citizens of Belfast  The unfitness rate in the city has  uh declined remarkably since the early nineteen-seventies when it was one of the worst in Britain  Now Belfast hosts a wide range of uhm visits from other cities uh throughout Europe  to look at the quality of housing and to see the quality  of life there   Well are are  we really getting on top of it then  I think in terms of uh in I think in terms in the quality and range of housing that we are beginning to see uhm the provision of of housing which is very much suited to the quality of life of people who live in Belfast in particular  And I think that 's important  Matt Wallace uh you 're a priest involved in community work and inevitably your work is amongst the less advantaged people of the city with far fewer choices and ability to make choices  Can they enjoy the city as it is at the moment  Yes I think so David  More and more so they 're adopting a positive attitude  uh towards their environment towards their housing  Uh that 's coupled in it has a lot to do I think with the fact that  this year we 're celebrating the final demise of demise of Divis Flats  Divis is no more  And it has been replaced by quality real good quality  housin  hou  housing which the people uhm are looking after extremely well  It 's great to see them supporting each other so much moving into their new homes and being looking out for each other be supportive of each other  And that coupled with the economic developments that we 've made in those areas through job clubs especially  uh the people the young men and women especially  are now getting  they have an achievement mentality I think which is helping them enormously  For a long time we suffered from uhm  labour immobility in that area because of the sectarian security situation  But now people are moving out now readily moving out of the city centre readily taking up jobs in the city centre wherever they can get them  And uhm there 's probably not a store uh a shop in Belfast where you won't find someone from west Belfast in one way or another working  And that 's a big step forward and as a result  the knock-on  effect of that is they will go go out at night then into the city centre to uh for enjoyment the pictures whatever it may be theatre whatever it is  Even young people are going back more and more city centre  So the consensus seems to be around the table that in spite of all its problems there 's no reason why people in Belfast shouldn't enjoy a very good form of life  Uh I spoke to Methodist Minister Jim Ray of the East Belfast Mission on the Lower Newtownards Road  and asked him if his part of Belfast was buzzing  I think that if you were to look at East Belfast  at this particular season of the year  season of  Orange celebration  you would say it 's certainly it buzzing  There 's a lot of activity around  There 's a lot of people on the streets  There 's a lot of demonstration and celebration  But I think if you look at it in another sense  at the problems  that are underlying  in the East Belfast community they are quite immense   So let 's hear about some of the problems that are there the  the long term and and what caused them in your opinion  Well I think there 's tremendous unemployment  in the three wards surrounding Ballymacarret  I think I 'm right in saying that about fifty  one percent of the working population are unemployed  And that has been largely caused by the demise of the major industries  and I would say in particular  by the demise of the Belfast Shipyard  Because the particular area of East Belfast where we work  was an area where almost all the menfolk living in the area actually worked in the yard  And the yard as you know has contracted from a workforce of around twenty-eight thirty thousand to a workforce of around three thousand  And that of course has decimated then the the uh the the streets uh  made the kind of community life of those streets much less uh confident  Well there is really no confidence about employment  I mean one of the great problems is that young people in particular leaving school  have absolutely no hope of finding jobs  There are of course government schemes  that will provide young people with extra training and support  but in a sense real jobs don't appear to be there  and there 's a very bleak kind of future  And I think that that causes other problems for example  uh the excessive amount of drinking and the development of alcoholism and the uh departure of young people in young men in particular  into the hands of paramilitaries who will use and abuse them   We 're being told by so many people that we 're turning the corner that Belfast 's on the up as a city  Are there any upswings at all in your part of the world at East Belfast   I think there are upswings  I think the upswings that I see  would be first of all that uh certainly people are enjoying a better life in the terms of housing situation in which they find themselves  Uh people  uh are living in very good homes  And one has to praise organisations and  uh institutions like the Housing Executive  who I think in recent years  have really done good work in the provision of very good housing for people  I think at another level  there is for me  a great feeling that in our community  there are many many people and a growing majority of people  who are tired of violence  who are no longer prepared to be sold a lie that they have got to do certain things in order to defend their community  who are willing to recognise that on both sides of the community there are good and decent people  And they are looking to the future  And their hope is that these Troubles will end  that the politicians in Northern Ireland will find a fair and just solution that will rebuild Northern Ireland as a place that 's worth to live  worth living in
