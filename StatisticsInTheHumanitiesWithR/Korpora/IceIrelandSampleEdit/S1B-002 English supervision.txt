<S1B-002 English supervision>  That 's most of one chapter  That 's the chapter on identity  I haven't  got  the Higgins onto it  Okay   Onto it because uhm I haven't finished reading Scenes from a Receding Past  I 've sort of just done about Elizabeth Bowen  several sylls  there 's no actual introduction into that  where 's this going to fit then  Well that 's  I think going to be the first chapter and then I 'm going to have  After an introduction  And then I 'm going to have the gender chapter next  Right so this is  identity  identity  Following on from that   That 's all basically just uhm Irish Ascendancy  identity  This one  Yeah  Scribble here  So hopefully I 'll get the Higgins uhm left in for you some time next week  Okay uhm  Okay  Uhm well obviously then I 'd need to  Read over again  have a look through this  Uh and how 's it going generally  Just in terms of  work you 've already done  and so on   Well uhm  I 've got most of the background work that I want to do now and I 'm trying just to really centre on the texts themselves rather than  Right  Put in too much literary criticism  You know  which we did last week  Get it down onto the text and actually what 's in the book  Uh-huh  Rather than what other people have said about it  so I 've done I think enough background  unless you think I should do some more  uhm  criticisms  Uhm it 's going not too bad except I 'm working full-time now  so it 's a bit uhm  Right   What are you up to  Well I 'm working full-time in Dillon 's now  again  Where  In Dillon 's  Oh right so you 're back there  Back there again for a year or so and uh  well until I have uhm decided what to do  So it 's it 's a bit tough then trying to fit everything in but  Mhm  It will get done  I 'm hoping to get the identity chapter done  or the sorry the gender chapter done  over the next couple of weeks  so  Time 's moving in  4 sylls   Sorry say that last bit again  Time 's moving on I should say  laughter  Uh you know it 's not going  Mhm  To start getting it written  Right so  the setup now is that you 've got the  there 'll be an introduction  there 's this and a draft of the first chapter  Yeah  But you said the  was it  The Higgins isn't  attached  on to that there  I didn't do the Higgins yet  I 've got uhm  I 've got  I read Killachter Meadow  You wanted to add more to this   Yeah  As well so I want to include that  Mhm  But I 'd rather read  finish off Scenes from a Receding Past first  Is that proving useful at all  it is  I 'm enjoying it actually  laughter  I 'm really really enjoying it  It reminds me a lot of Banville  I see wee things in Books of Evidence and stuff  Book of Evidence and stuff  Yeah  Written at the time but it just reminds me of Banville 's language  No I think I mean  well I think it 's a very under-rated novel and uh  I think it 's much much better than Langrishe Go Down  I wouldn't go that far  I prefer Langrishe but the uh  No  I really   I don't like the  fact that it 's only like Imogen 's story and Helen and  Lily  are obviously shoved to the side  Mm   Yeah  I think that 's a failing in it  But  Mm  They 're very different  But it certainly is is proving useful  good  It 'll be particularly useful for the gender chapter I think  Mm  More so than identity  there 's the gender chapter  then then what else  Then the  conclusion  So that 's  that 's probably pretty much it  Cos I I 'm just sort of looking at  thinking in terms of length  and  so on you 've got what   several sylls    Mhm   It 's probably about  four thousand words there I would say  Near it  Yeah that 's probably  it 's not  not too bad  I mean if you 've got a bit more to add to this  Yeah  Then the chapters should be about five thousand each  Yeah  Uhm and everything then in terms of structure and so on it 's all working  Yeah well hopefully  Well you can read through that and see what you think of the structure  I 've really just gone through uhm each book  and  then tried to link up a bit more as I 've gone through them  So I 've started with Bowen and then gone onto Keane  So I 've tried to make a few references in the Keane section to the Bowen books to try and link it up a wee bit  But if you think there 's anything wrong with the structure then you know  tell me  Uh-huh   And I mean you 've finalised  I mean you 're you 're  I mean apart from the Higgins which you 're still working on  you 've finalised the texts  Yeah  So it 's Bowen  Higgins  Banville  No I wasn't going to  Because I 'm going  to  I 've done two uhm texts by Bowen and then two by Keane and then two by Higgins and then The Killachter Meadow as well  Right now  So that 's six nearly seven  The short story was from  several sylls  Unless you think I should include more  No I mean I I just uh  I just wasn't uh  uh  because I haven't seen  Yeah  Anything by you so far you know  I haven't really got a sense of which uh texts you you 're really working on and which ones you 're going to  focus on  right  laughs   That 's basically it isn't it  I think pretty much  what I 'll do is  I mean I 'll I 'll uh get through this  I mean are you in and out through the week or are you  Uhm well Tuesday 's my only day off so it 's really awkward now for getting up to Queen 's  but I mean I can certainly call up and collect that or get my mum to collect it at some stage  Well I mean if it 's easier I can post it out to your home address  Leave it in and I can collect it cos I think I 'll probably be in round about  round Queen 's on Tuesday anyway  Right well I 'll  I mean if it 's not ready on Tuesday  I mean don't worry about it  No I 'll leave it  I 'll leave it in for Tuesday  Right okay  Uh hopefully I 'll have the Higgins up for sometime during the week  then get on to the gender chapter  Right  So I 'm going to work on that during the weekend  Uhm let 's see  I 'm just trying  I 'm thinking about that because I 'm going to be away  Right  From about mid-August through to sometime in early September  Right  And even if I 'm not away I 'm just going to take off because I haven't had a holiday yet and I deserve it  laughter  So uh uhm that means that  let 's see  I have to go away  several sylls  uh  I 'll be  I 'll be around sort of the week of the fifteenth  several sylls   So I mean from now on a a Friday meeting would be difficult for you anyway  Unless I can  I can come up after work but I don't know whether that would suit you or not   I mean why not  why not make it Tuesday then if that 's your day off  Right well it 's just uh whatever really suits you then  Well actually the I mean the earlier  the earlier that things can be cleared up on the week of the fifteenth the better  So that that 's the sixteenth of August then that Tuesday  Right okay  Okay and uhm  right and what I 'll say ten thirty  Yeah that 's fine   And that I mean that would be the  that would be the gender chapter  Yes that 's right  I mean is that  you reckon you 'd be able to get it done by then  Yeah I should  I should be able to get it done by the second  It might not be typed up but it will be written up in some form or another  Now I mean it 's just that that uhm  you know as I was saying I 'll be away from   several sylls    Yeah  no I would like you to see it before  before that time  No I mean I 'll be back in early September so I 'll be able to read things but I mean  Yeah  My main aim is to  get people going so to speak and I 'll have a look at it  Uhm in the introduction do you think I should have a background sort of to the Big House generally  Would that be a good idea  Well I mean explain some more to me about what you mean by what  several sylls   Uhm sort of uhm  the history  Should I introduce the history though  or should I  go right back to Edgeworth and  And even just uhm the history of the political novel  3 sylls  social novel  Or should I just stick to the Big House as a genre  Well I mean I think your  your concern with this is really in terms of the way in which the Big House operates as a true figure  Mm  And the kinds of issues about both social identity and gender  identity  that it raises  uh there are ways in which a political history or a social history of the Big House feed into that  Yeah   Yes  But I think they 're slightly removed  You know in other words I think   Yes  I wasn't sure whether I should  do you know that it would maybe be a bit too much of a tangent maybe  the political  or whether it would be appropriate  You see I think  I mean I think in in talking about this before I mean one of the points  I can't  trying to remember now  actually I was trying to remember as I was walking in this morning  whether it was  whether it was you or somebody else I had been making the point to which is that that one of the things which happens with the Big House  very often  and Aroon in Good Behaviour is the perfect instance of this  uh is that  and uh I mean the the Langrishes are another good instance  that uhm what you have is property ending up in the possession of unmarried women  I was just thinking that  several sylls  and  that point about uhm  that may not strictly speaking be historically accurate  I  mean it 's not the case that the Ascendancy died out because you know no male heirs  were produced  But what that does is actually in literary texts is to dramatise so to speak the end of the line  You know  because the whole point of something like the Big House is to do with property transfer  you know and inheritance  Yeah   Yes yes   Right   And the and the facts of uhm you know the laws of inheritance certainly in the early part of the century  several sylls  When when Big Houses end up with unmarried women  Yes  This is actually kind of metaphorically you know even literally  the end of the line  Right  there 's a case in which  in order to  to in a sense dramatise that notion of a line of inheritance having come to a full stop  writers use women in that way and whether they mean to or not that necessarily provokes questions about gender identity  yes  Does this mean that you know you can't be a proper Ascendancy figure if you 're a woman   2 sylls  the first  most obvious  1 syll  Uhm now that  it seems to me doesn't necessarily have to do with political or legal history of the  Big  House  Though obviously it 's something that involves court  several sylls  Uhm  so if I I think there is a gap in other words between that kind of political legal  history  and the way in which it 's used in  literary works   Yes   Mhm   Right okay
