<S2A-056 Recipes 1>  Hello I 'm Darina Allen  and I absolutely love cooking  and most of us have to cook every day of our lives anyway  So it 's great if you can actually enjoy it rather than being bored by it  and it 's much easier to enjoy your cooking if you know what you 're doing  So during this series of programmes I 'm going to be showing you how to do lots of simple and delicious recipes  using basic techniques which can be used in all kinds of cooking musical interlude   Now I 'm just going to show you how to make one of my favourite starters called crudite/s with garlic mayonnaise  Now crudite/s  simply means raw vegetables in French  So what we need for this are some perfect delicious crisp vegetables  And when I 'm going to make it I just go down to the garden or the greenhouse and choose the vegetables for it very carefully so that they 're very fresh  And the  exactly the same applies if you 're going to a shop or greengrocers  Look at your vegetables  Think flavour while you 're actually choosing them and if you can feel them and pick up and get the crispest  and freshest ones you can  So now I 'm going to show you how to make uh a good homemade mayonnaise  And a lot of people think this might take ages but in fact even if you 're making it by hand you can make a mayonnaise well within five minutes  So all you need are  first and foremost two egg yolks  And I 'll put the egg whites over here cos we 'll keep those and make meringues with them later on  There we are  Two egg yolks  And uhm we 'll put a little  about a quarter teaspoon of salt in there  And  vinegar as well  two egg yolks will take a tablespoon of vinegar  But I 'm actually going to put in a dessertspoon of vinegar at this stage  And also a little bit of mustard cos that 's got an emulsifying quality  And perhaps uhm a little pepper also  There we are  If you wanted to be very smart you could actually use white pepper so you wouldn't have any little black specks in it  And then I 'm doing it in a see-through bowl so that you can see what 's going to happen  And all you need is a little whisk of some kind  Now into that two egg yolks then you would drip  And I  I emphasise the word drip uh eight fluid ounces of oil  And of course the flavour of your mayonnaise will depend on two things  on the quality of your egg yolks and of course the quality of your oil  I 'm using a  very good quality vegetable oil here with a little dash of olive oil in it  So start off now by adding in the oil very gradually little drip by drip whisking all the time  And at the moment it 's quite thin  But in a couple of seconds you 'll see it 'll start to thicken up  you must do it nice and slowly in the beginning because otherwise the egg yolk simply won't be able to absorb the oil  So there we are  It 's getting lovely and thick now  So mayonnaise can be made of course not only by hand but uh in a food   cessor  it can be made even faster  Or else uh if you want to make it in a liquidiser you could make it with a whole egg  And there we are look  That was pretty fast  Now I 've got to add in the last dessertspoon of wine vinegar  In it goes  Now if you like you could actually substitute lemon juice for the vinegar at that stage  And that will slightly thin out the mayonnaise for you  The mayonnaise will keep in your fridge  Homemade mayonnaise like this will keep in your fridge for say five or six days  Uh it doesn't obviously keep indefinitely  But five or six days would be perfect  So now let me just show you how to deal with the garlic  I 've got  two cloves of garlic here  And uh I just usually I don't use a garlic press for this  I usually take my knife and press it down like that  And then the peel will come off quite easily  And then we make it into a paste  So take a little bit of salt  I have a special board for it cos I don't want  everything else to taste of garlic  And take your chopping knife like this  And then put the weight on the tip of your chopping knife  And then make it into a paste like that  There we are  Now for the garlic mayonnaise you can add uhm  as much garlic as you like uhm a large clove of garlic  You can add even one to four cloves of garlic depending on how  strong you like it  But it really should taste quite garlicky  So as soon as you 've made it into a paste pop that into your mayonnaise  In fact I could add a little more as well  And then also add a bit of parsley  Now the parsley is there to make it more delicious and give it a little bit more colour  But you could leave it out if you wanted to  So now that 's  a garlic mayonnaise for you there  Now we have some garlic mayonnaise made up in a in a piping bag here  So let 's look at the first bowl here first  This plate was made actually specially for crudite/s and it has a little bowl attached to the plate in the centre musical interlude   Next I 'm going to show you how to make a completely different kind of starter  I 'm going to do a sorbet  Now a sorbet is actually a water-ice like an icecream but made completely without cream  So you can serve it either as a starter  You can serve it as a dessert for example if you had a very creamy main course or something spicy like a curry  Or else if you are having a rich meal with four or five courses you could serve it in the old-fashioned sort of way where you have a little sorbet just before the main course just to cleanse your palate and make you feel less full  So now it 's very simple  All I need is the juice of the grapefruit and some sugar  And all you 've got to do is to mix the sugar  into the grapefruit  juice like that  And stir it round  Now the pink grapefruit uhm and indeed any grapefruit they uh vary a lot in sweetness  So don't add in all the sugar first  Taste it and see whether it 's going to be sweet enough  this actually needs a bit more sugar because with any sorbet uhm it must taste rather sweeter than you 'd like to eat it before it goes in to freeze because of course it will lose quite a lot of its sweetness in the freezing  And you can make sorbet not only from grapefruit juice but from the juice of practically any fruit uh and you can make it all year round as a result  And of course you can also make uh sorbets from vegetables for example a tomato sorbet or a cucumber sorbet and even a champagne sorbet  So you 've got lots of choice  So I need a little bit more sugar in there  Anything from eight to ten ounces of sugar  And taste again  That 's fine now tasting a little sweeter than I 'd like to eat it at this point  So now uh that part was is very easy  Now there are three different alternatives as far as freezing goes  And if you 're one of those very lucky people who actually has an icecream maker or a sorbetie\re then all you 'd have to do at this point is just take your grapefruit juice uh sweetened grapefruit juice and pop it into your icecream maker  Uh pour it into the barrel  like that with the sugar  And then freeze it for about twenty minutes until it 's quite slushy  So the second alternative is to do exactly as I did  Mix the sugar with the grapefruit juice  And then put it into your freezer or the freezing compartment of your fridge and freeze it for seven or eight hours or even overnight until it 's completely frozen  And if you have a food processor  break it up  and put it into your food processor  There we are  like that  And then whiz it up  Now with this one you 'll get a texture very similar to the texture you get from the sorbet machine  But I usually like to add actually a little egg white in as well just to give it a slightly creamier finish  add just a little the uh about one egg white or  slightly less than one egg white for this quantity down through the funnel there  And then turn it off  and whiz it up  And then you get a very good texture that way as well  And in fact you could put that back into your freezer now and serve it later on  So then the third way  And this is the way most people will want to do it is again grapefruit juice sweetened  And then put it into say a stainless steel bowl into your freezer and leave it there for or the freezing compartment of your fridge  And then leave it there for say five or six hours until it 's just starting to get slightly frozen round the edges  And then take it out  And again I have one at that stage here  Take it out then and get just an ordinary whisk  We 'll pop that underneath  And then break up the slightly frozen crystals around the outside  Now this particular sorbet you get a slightly different texture  You can hear there that it 's quite sort of slushy  there we are  So  uh whisk in the slightly frozen part from the outside and then put it back in your freezer again and leave it there for another couple of hours  And then whisk it up again  Uh you would  I 'd like to serve it with a few little segments of grapefruit round the outside  So uhm I 'm just going to show you how to segment the grapefruit  You take a sort of stainless steel knife preferably with a serrated edge and then cut a nice thick slice off the top of the grapefruit right down as far as the flesh  And then do it over a bowl  Now hold your knife almost perpendicular and saw  don't push   And don't cut too deep like that  the whole way round  And this is exactly the same way that you would segment oranges for a fruit salad or uh if you needed to segment lemons or any of the citrus fruit  So put that out there  and then hold the grapefruit or whatever it is in your the centre of your hand like that  and cut in front of the membrane  And then just slide off the segment just like that  And if you come across a pip every now and then you can take that out  Exactly the same now for any citrus fruit  So that 's a little technique that 's well worth learning  And I 'll use those now you see to put round my little pink grapefruit sorbet  you would also have some cold plates in the fridge so you can put your sorbet on it  Because basically  uhm uh the sorbet melts fairly quickly  ch  plates should be chilled  And I 've got two cold plates here  And I also have some uh sorbet that we froze earlier on  And I 'm just going to show you uh one of the ways we present it on the plate  So now  take some of the segments  the little grapefruit segments  and arrange them around the outside  like that  These are nice actually cos they have  a little  tinge of pink on the outside  There we are  Get them all more or less going in the same direction  Whoops  I 'm going to take that one back  Here we are  like that  Pick nice shaped segments  And one more  There we are  And then  you need  either uhm a spoon or if you have uhm an icecream scoop you could use that and keep it in warm water  And then  get yourself a nice  round scoop of the sorbet  and pop that into the centre like that  And then  you could  decorate it  with a little sprig of fresh mint on top
