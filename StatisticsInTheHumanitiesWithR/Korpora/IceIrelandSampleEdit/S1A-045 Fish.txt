would aye  They 're big aren't they when you see them on the shelves  They 're massive  The head you see that 's really the biggest bit of them  And  then they call that tailing  Uh-huh   Oh yes  You see the boats would come in and sort of just let her tick in at her own leisure and they 'd finish  trawling  And then they 'll tail  And  the boys hate that  for they hate the size of them  And they break the head off for the tail and that 's why they call it tailing  They dinnae call it heading   They call it tailing yeah  And that 's separating  And then you get the head-onners  They 're the bigger dearer ones  They they dinnae touch them and they like working with them  so they do  Mhm   Right tailing uh-huh   So they 're all sort of put into different sizes and  Different categories and different prices  yeah  And  that if when these head-onners come in  the lassies in the factories hate it for the tails were really wee then  That was the weeist of the weeist  For he tried to slap his money on the medium-sized and he 's went for head-onners cos they 've got a bigger  price  so they did  And then there 's a thing too you get all sort of fish  You get  the dogfish  And everybody sort of expect to see bit of dog you know  But  they 're just like uhm in England they call them rock salmon  Uh-huh   Oh aye mhm   Aye   They 're they 're related to the shark

silver hake  It 's lovely  Oh I love hake  Love it  Uh Eddie 's no a fish-eater  Mhm  But if you ever make him a bit of hake he 'll eat that  Mhm  I like a bit of smoked fish  There 's haddock  uh    like haddock Rosemary  It 's uh it 's too dry for me  Aye  It 's what is it uh  2 sylls  expensive ranges of fish  Mhm  But it 's too dry  And that has that the the fingerprint of Jesus  that 's supposed to be the fish  he used  to feed them with the bread  And when you see a haddock there 's a fingerprint and thumb print of Jesus on its shoulders  I 've heard that yes   Mhm I never  knew that   So uh  that 's what the finger and thumb print is  You 'll get it on the haddock  That 's how you know haddock  So that 's the Lord 's fish they always call  after  But  maybe cos I like fatty beef  I do like I like  greasy things and you know  the fat of beef or  2 sylls  off that there I would like  And he 's the same  Mhm
