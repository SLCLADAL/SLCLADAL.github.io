<S1B-059 Budget 1>  At the uh  a  Cheann Comhairle at the outset uh I am honoured uh to probably be the last uh time that an Opposition spokesperson will ever reply to a formal budget debate like today  Cos I think I can take it that after the events of the past fortnight and the succession of leaks this will the be the last time that we 'll go through this charade if budgets are going to be leaked in the way they 've been done in the past while  Now I 'm glad to note that the  that the Government have uh pre-empted their decision to have a constitutional referendum on cabinet confidentiality cos there will be no need to do so if we are to continue on in this particular basis before a budget  And whereas as my party leader said this morning probably in the past that we went to too great a lengths to protect every single aspect of budget day  I think that it would be necessary for people to point out that it is a serious matter when all of the budget is leaked in advance  There are  and even as we sat here today  a Minister of State decided to issue a press release  despite  at eight minutes past four  meaning that the Minister was only on his feet for eight minutes  speaking about the budget and the various matters that are curtained contained therein  Now the Ceann Comhairle did ask that at least members of the House would for the time of the budget not do this  so it is  this was released at four o-eight this evening by the  by a Minister of State and I take it that the Ceann Comhairle will take up to this particular matter in the very near future with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges  I also think  I also would like to say is that I am a person who in many areas of life and when I can laugh at myself and I don't take myself too seriously all of the time  but there is a need  there is a need that when dealing with serious matters of state to treat them as such  cannot  we cannot allow a situation for a government no matter made up of three parties or only  any number of parties to go ahead and have the type of leakages that have occurred in the past while  I would ask the Taoiseach whom I know would share my concerns in this particular regard  to take some action because say it was planned today in the budget that there was to be an increased bank levy  or any other major taxation changes  wouldn't it not  there would be a run on the financial markets and I think ministers those ministers who have recently joined the government should be conscious of that before they step out and start telling their programme managers and advisors as to what is in the budget  This is being looked at from abroad and I will recall and I 'm sure that Ruairi  Deputy Quinn who is a student of history will recall that a British Chancellor of the Exchequer  when walking into the chamber to deliver his budget speech happened to mention some little aspect to a person who went off and told a journalist and arising from same the Chancellor of the Exchequer resigned that evening not that it made any difference at all to the financial markets but on a point of principle  And I hope that this particular budget will be the last time that we 'll go ahead like this  I would be open enough to say is that maybe the spending estimates in the budget could be discussed a long time in advance but we cannot have a situation that we have had for the past while  And may I also say that one of the papers this morning said in giving all the details of the budget  that the Department of Finance was leaking like a sieve  Now I want to say that to my certain knowledge that the public  pensio  public civil servants that are permanent in the Department of Finance or no other government department has been involved in the leaking of this budget at all  Hear-hear  It is a slur  it is a slur on the public servants who 've served this State long and well but particularly on the Department of Finance which if I may say so go to the other extreme  they 'd hardly tell you what day tomorrow was if at all they could avoid it  And I think it is a pity that that has been done and I hope that an opportunity will be taken to correct it  When I was a student  a colleague of mine Deputy Power used to bring me in here to listen to the budget and I used to sit in that gallery up there and I went down to take the notes one day because I was an accountancy  student and uh an usher came along to tell me you can't even take the notes  And that is how serious the change that has taken place  and I don't say this lightly  I don't say that we have to have everything covered up and I 'm all for  openness but in the matter of the budget I ask the Taoiseach not to proceed on this basis any more  Now the Minister  that 's what I 'll say at the outset because I do regard it as serious and I  there are things in life I think I can be flippant about and be good-humoured about but this is not one of those matters and I 'm sure the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are  fully agree with me  Now this budget has been the best heralded of any budget in in the history of the State  It 's more or less as someone some one of the back benchers said uh on my side of the House when Deputy Quinn was talking about uh the twenty ten strategy he said something like about a space odyssey  Well I 'd describe this budget as a little bit like the Star Trek TV uh programme where it comes to the great line  beam me up Scotty  laughter  Now this budget is more like is kind of beam me up Ruairi or beam us up Ruairi into a world of fantasy where nobody is going to pay bills either now or into the future  And I think that if the lessons of the past are not learned by the politicians of today  then we 're all going to pay a heavy price  I 'd like to think is that someone who as maybe good-humoured about certain aspects of my own affairs both political  private and otherwise  I think that I 'd like to think that I paid a heavy enough political price for many years ago warning about the dangers of a government or political parties going down the road from which we did  and it took us a long time to recover from it and I say it with the utmost sincerity and I know that certain members in the opposite side of the House agree with me even though they may not be in a position to do anything about it and that includes certain members of the government  If we go back the road from whence we came we are making a fundamental mistake for which this generation of politicians will not be forgiven by  by anybody  Hear-hear  Now I toyed with a number of options as to how I might open this my particular address on budget day nineteen ninety-five  and option one was that I could   reread into the record of the House the budget statements of the last couple of years by Deputies Bruton  de Rossa and Rabbitte and comparing their then proposals as against what has been offered here today by the Minister for Finance  But I will spare the blushes of the Deputies opposite  not may I say out of any great generosity on my uh behalf  but what useful purpose would it serve  One could argue that as a result of such an expose/ a certain amount of political embarrassment will accrue to the parties now forming the Rainbow Coalition  However it has been decreed from the pinnacle of the high moral ground on Carrantuohill and as enunciated and imprimatured by the high priests of political correctness that it is only Fianna Fa/il who do political U-turns  All other political parties make policy adjustments in the best interests of the country  and never in their own of course  that being the preserve of those uncouth muck-savages  unprincipled and power-hungry members of the Fianna Fa/il party  laughter   Speak for yourself  I also considered a section a second option as to how I would approach my address  This involved my Fianna Fa/il colleagues and I  particularly those who were members of the last government  on a pre-arranged signal from me breaking down in tears and lamenting our luck in being out of government at this particular time  laughter  Because uh whether our opponents inside or outside the House care to acknowledge  it was the policies of Fianna Fa/il led governments since eighty-seven which has put the economy into its healthy state today  Hear-hear  The House will be glad to knew know that I threw out the public crying option as an approach although it had a lot to recommend it  it would be so totally out of tune with our ever so carefully crafted media image of being untruthful  heartless  unprincipled et-cetera  However  I do feel like shedding a tear for the unfortunate Irish taxpayer and the public who in the past couple of months have had it thrust upon them an inter-party Government of such divergent philosophies  policies  and ideas that I find it difficult to imagine any type of coherent medium-term strategy let alone some long-term planning being followed  There are positive aspects to this budget and these I heartily welcome  However  although said previously  I think that it can honestly be stated that on this occasion that rarely if ever in the history of this State has such an opportunity been afforded to any Minister for Finance  I 've some sympathy for the predicament of the present Minister  but not even he can reconcile the irreconcilable  His colleagues have been spending the largesse in advance  As I pointed out on publication of the Book of Estimates they did not provide for expenditures which the Minister and at least some members of the Government know must be paid for in ninety-five  They also point out that over a hundred and eighty million of spending financed by the tax amnesty was included in the nineteen ninety-four based numbers which means that the underlying rate of rise in the ninety-five figures was about six and a half percent  not the announced four point one percent which was done on the twenty-seventh of January  If a government is not prepared to face up to the realities at the outset of its term and make decisions on priorities  what chance is there for tough decision-making as it heads nearer to a general election  Absolutely none is the answer  and that 's another blow for openness transparency and accountability  without any shadow of a doubt the success of the past say eight years has been bought at a high price  It has been bought at a price for a certain number of politicians at least on this side of the House no longer being on this side of the House or in Da/il E/ireann at all  But more than anything else it brought  imposed some  a lot of hardship on some sectors of the Irish community and necessary decisions had to be  made  The irony of the situation now is that the eighty-seven election campaign was run on the basis that we couldn't be trusted to have with an overall majority because we couldn't be trusted with the State 's finances  Without any shadow of doubt the areas of borrowing  interest rates  and inflation are interlinked  Its low interest rates and low inflation are the biggest contributors to economic improvement in that particular period of time  And our record  that of the Fianna Fa/il party in being in government on their own from eighty-seven to eighty-nine with the with the Progressive Democrats afterwards and then with the Labour Party  it was our government our our Fianna Fa/il party led by Fianna Fa/il ministers and Taoisigh that contributed to that success
