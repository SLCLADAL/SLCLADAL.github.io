shitless  Ah you wouldn't  Not really   the man here now  laughter   But it  you you you 'd  No I mean it was scary  now  But you  know you know the way they always do you know chuck chuck chuck up to the top  and then they just  absolutely piss down at  sixty miles an hour  Actually what what was it came up to the top right  went down and then took a sharp like ninety degree left  We thought the thing was going to go right off the edge  Yeah yeah   Yeah  Christ   Mm  It 's going so fast  And then you come down and you just go into a twist  and  upside down and round about  Very fast  No it was very good  I thought it was very good  Right   Were there waterslides and stuff  Love to try the waterslide  Yeah you could get in  It was the same as the roller coaster  It just went down a big thing and just splash into a  pool like  and everybody got soaked  Ha ha   Yeah yeah   I 've seen it on  telly alright  laughter   The waterslide  8 sylls   Do you get many holidays now  like during the year  How many days off  Ah we 're probably entitled to  from working  Yeah  We get a  day and three quarters every month  And can you take them when you like or  Well yeah usually yeah  You 've to to keep   you 've to keep three for  Christmas or something like that  So how many weeks would you get during the summer like  break in recording    Three for  For summer uh you can take off  whatever two two working weeks anyway  That 's only  ten days like  God   Jesus  You can take  three   Four weeks a year   I wouldn't be able  to get used to that  You know the way  as a student now we get  so many holidays  But ah oh my God when I 'm working  two weeks off  Mm right   What 's the toughest is getting up every single day  You know when you 're there you say okay maybe I won't bother  Yeah  That 's the hardest  You have to get up every single morning   I know yeah  I know I know  That 's what I was saying  Like  the night after we met you  Yeah  You know I was thinking God well they have to go to work  I  mean we don't have to go  to our lectures  Mm   Mm  But I mean we did but  laughter  I know the feeling yeah  You don't have to  There 's no   10 sylls    I know  and we 're  paying to be there  Of course it is better to attend your lectures as I do  laughter   Just like to  emphatically state that  point now  and for the record  And uhm  Oh yeah  definitely   No I never miss I think living with Bronwyn  helped me make my nine lectures  Yeah  Last year out in the house I 'd say  ah roll over in bed  And because it was further out  You were further away  as well   The  hassle of  Oh God I 'm never going to make it  The traffic 's going to be awful  Especially for a nine o 'clock lecture you 've to get up even earlier  So I won't bother  But here it 's different  It 's easier  And then if Bronwyn 's up I said oh I feel guilty  I better get up  laughter   Yeah  It 's been good that way  It should only take you five minutes with the wind behind you  Ah a little bit more than five  What does it take you  Mm compare speeds  How long does it take you  How long  does it take you   With the  wind and uhm  traffic lights  and  3 sylls    No on an  optimal day or whatever that means   laughter   Optimal day  All the all the lights and all the wind behind  Yeah  Five minutes yeah  Really  Yeah  No I wouldn't make I 've never  2 sylls  make it in five  On a Saturday of course it 's it 's really quick  because the traffic isn't you know  I 'd be going in at maybe like  like half twelve and the traffic isn't  bad   Yeah  I go in then  Although sometimes  Do you  When there 's football it 's bad enough sometimes  Yeah  Eleven eleven in the morning   I go in for swimming around half  1 syll    I sort of bypass the  rush hour so I go in around a quarter to eight  In oh yeah yeah  Better being on a bike than in a bus anyway  Yeah  Cos you can dodge them  like you can go up on the footpath  You know what I mean  You can hang onto trucks  3 sylls   3 sylls    And slipstream  buses  You hang onto  You don't  I saw these kids one day  They were all on the back of a truck  It was so scary
