<S1A-071 Elocution>  Hey listen RTE/ made a film about my family  laughter  And a very good one it was too  Tell us about it please  laughter  Well as you know by now  my family are totally and utterly  Serial killers  laughter   I 've got a  few quotes   Cornflakes  you know  Rice Krispies  Well I know my Mum 's put an awful lot of work into it but I don't think the rest of the family are as enthusiastic as I am  laughter   That 's one quote from that am  another one  is uhm honey oatmeal lemon  I wonder will it all be worth it  It was in   What was this  You know those face masks  1 syll   Yeah well maybe a kind of natural face mask  You know the kind of  part   In the  video  In the video  You better watch that video again  You 're missing all the good bits  Right yeah  And then  And then Charles is complaining about the the price of uhm  Oh yeah  Ecological washing up liquid  Yes and saying they 're expensive  That 's Charlie isn't it  Charles  Charlie  yeah  Uh actually Charlie Charles is his name now  laughter   Yeah   None of  these events are real or fictitious  Any similarities with even  laughter  3 sylls   There 's a man who watches his films  Yeah the names have been changed to protect the innocent  You know  like the start of the A-team  sings A-team theme song   laughter   To protect the guilty and to show up the innocent  laughter   Yeah do you ever I remember watching  once one of those movies that said you know it 's a life story and it had one of those  laughter  messages at the bottom  w  what  4 sylls  is a story a true story  No names 've been changed or anything and  4 sylls  any similarities of are people living or dead  laughter  Hardly fictitious   Or purely coincidental  but the whole idea of it was a story  Have you been to see the In the Name of the Father yet  No  No  I went to see    Schindler 's List  Yeah  That 's meant to be excellent  Liam Neeson  there 's a hatful of uh nominations for  that   Yeah   Did you want to go and see In the Name of the Father last night  or were you just pretending that you wanted to go to the cinema  Let 's have very very  how about some stagnated speech from Daniella  laughter  See you 're not good at this  no no I  I went out to see  I went  3 sylls    tell the truth  Just because uhm you heard  that I didn't want to go out you said oh I was just going to take you to the cinema  That 's right yeah  I 'll give you  You always do that  Like mothers do when you 're five  I was going to take you to the to the circus and then  4 sylls  and MacDonald 's but you did this  Yeah no uhm I want to go and see that  Oh I  And Wayne 's World too  No Wayne 's World is rubbish  Do you remember when we watched that  in Yvonne 's house and it was rubbish  Wayne 's World  Wayne 's World    Not like it no  No   It was crap   It 's   rubbish  Ah it 's dross total rubbish  Yeah  I think Ted and  thingymajig 's uh   Bill and Ted 's bogus  journey  Yeah  That 's very good actually  That is quite a good movie  Yeah   Yeah  That 's that 's much better  Yeah  Excellent  But sure that was the  Excellent  That was the forerunner  Yeah  And you actually learned a bit of history  That 's right  yeah  was it was very well done  Yeah   But there was a plot behind it  Well  Yeah Wayne 's World   But they were supposed to do  this project  They were supposed to do  a project  yeah so there 's Wayne 's World had no bloody uhm   5 sylls    they all just went around acting the  maggot yeah   Yeah   But I thought I thought the three different endings were really  cool   Oh  yeah that was really good  Which is this  In Wayne 's World there are three different ends  Oh yeah  It finishes and then  1 syll    Here 's the sad end  Here 's the remorseful end  And the Scooby-Doo end  Mmm  But at least in Ted and  Bill and Ted  Bill and Ted 's  Excellent Adventure  they they are able to help themselves in the future  Well if I leave the keys here  That 's right yeah yeah  yeah exactly yeah  laughter   I remember to put them back  I thought it was quite good  I thought it was quite funny uhm  Wayne 's World  Just putting the lid on the margarine  tub   I 'd  give my right eye to get  laughter   We always use Flora cos it 's high in cholesterol and low in polyunsaturates  laughter   That 's Daniella saying that she can read yet again by  3 sylls   I 'd say it 's the other way round  Mm  Very good   That 's the cat meowing  Do you want the cat on the sound  cat meowing   Imitates dog barking  No it 's a bit  very shy cat  It 's quite old now  This cat now she 's fourteen  Yeah and she 's from Boyle  From Boyle County Roscommon  Yeah   Oh  2 sylls  cat   and we got her from my elocution teacher  laughter  Ms Louisa Frankish  What was that  My elocution teacher  Oh right  She had kittens and I remember  Dad and I  laughter    6 sylls    Here her cat  had kittens   I remember   She didn't  teach you much elocution did she  Daddy was collecting me from elocution then  Is is that why we 're doing that today  Why we 're doing this speech because of your  2 sylls  laughter   And he just put the cat in the box and into the van and uh  2 sylls  goes what 's the cat for  Oh I don't like cats  Oh it 's for mother  What 's the cat 's name  Pussy  Pussy cat   Well they  didn't really have a name for it   just like mewie   Puss   What  What 's her name  Your mother always goes  putty   Look look  look it 's up it 's up there pussy see pussy  Ah she does have another name uhm  it 's uh Glenda Glenda  Yeah I remember that I remember when mother was sick and mam was getting me to write a card to her in hospital and uhm she said she said now write I hope that you will be home soon to be with pussy or Glenda whichever you like  And I said which one has the least letters in it  laughter  Well they 're both the same  Ah okay  And then of course you know the animals have  or cats have three names  Their nickname  their real name and the name they know themselves  Oh right   laughter   They must call themselves something  Uhm  Cats aren't that intelligent  despite what you think   How do you know  They probably have yeah  Well that one 's thick  How do you know  Th  the you see it all goes back to the thing about you and colours  I mean is the colour that you see the same colour that I see  it 's not  Yes it is  It 's not  It 's not   How can you prove it  Nobody 's able to prove it   You can't prove that black is black or white is white  Bu  I mean he he could be I I he could think that he 's dressed in green now  Yeah  But he 's actually in  black  to me he 's in black   the only  confusion you get is between red and green you know  No but how can you know   No no no no no no  That 's your conception of black  Yeah okay  It might not be   You see it might not be red to me   it 's uh what you what 's black  Black is only what you think this is   A very dark colour yeah  but you 're  no  it 's  not only your idea  the mental  picture it 's not  it 's not an actual definition   No but   Oh right  so then blind people can  actually see colour  No  In a way   they can have their own conceptions of colours   well no no it 's just  Well take here like like this this this uhm  this beige wall you know  I know that 's the colour beige and every time I 'm referring to it it 's beige and to you it 's always beige as well  Mmm  But to you that beige might look like this black  So you might not see that colour all over this room  whereas I 'd see this colour  Yeah  And then I might see this colour as  as black   so it 's just a label  you have on your  perception of colour   So it 's    Yes   And because everybody keeps calling everybody says you know since you were a child say well that 's silver  Yeah  You always associate silver with that  but you may actually see that as red in your  Yeah  Do you see what I mean  Well it 's silver to me  laughter   6 sylls  Where did I come across that argument  It was  With me actually probably about a week ago  Was it  Yeah  No I 've come across it before too   Oh I remember  I 've seen it  Yeah I know it 's philosophy  Well maybe I uh actually uh I went to a few lectures on it  and he  stood up the top pointing at blackboards and green boards actually yeah  Philosophy   Did you   Yes  Or blackboards or green boards or whatever  That 's like this this here could be a  a uh a box of tissues  Mmm  But I always perceive it as a box of eggs  laughter   It 's yellow in colour yeah  No black  Oh is it  Sorry yeah  laughter   that 's good   Great  laughs  mm  Is this true  A little bit of it yeah  That 's why I always think about you know people they don't they 've no dress sense  colours  Yeah because my mother has a friend and she 's uh she dyes her hair blonde  but the the roots are always black  It 's not Nellie  laughter  But the roots are black down  to there  she just doesn't see  she doesn't seem to see it herself and she 'd wear red and then she 'd wear kind of hairbands that would clash with her like piss-blonde hair  And oh  It 's bottle blonde   Oh can we use a word like that  Can we  laughter  Yes  Can we  That 's allowed  Ah  laughter   It 's a  Mam always reckons that she 's colour blind cos we 'll say different shades of the same colour she always seems to wear together and everything  But you 'd be morto to go out with her like  Therefore she must perceive that two colours must be perceived as the same for her  Mmm   Like  sh  she 's known around Boyle that ah  she 's uhm  known for her like disgusting colours  Like people like say oh look at her today  So she must have a  very severe case of that   Well she 's changed  her colour to red hair today  blonde tomorrow  And piss-blonde the next day by all accounts  isn't it  laughter   Well that 's what I call blonde   You you 've got worse still than you have already  Jeez  5 sylls   No but it 's bottle blonde hair  4 sylls  It 's not natural blonde  It doesn't look like the colour of a  natural blonde   No highlights   Right  Yeah  Okay  There used to be a guy out in  where I used to go to school he used to dye his hair  Really  Blonde yeah  But what I hate is  Barry dyes his hair  Oh my God  Is there anything he doesn't do  A friend of mine dyes his  hair   Yeah   Does he  What colour does he dye it  Well the  colour that it is   Depends  lighter  lighter  He wanted me to he said ah your hair 'd look really good if you if you dyed it  What black  Uhm no uhm kind of  Highlighted  Green  More more red or something  I don't know
