negative  It bloody better be  Well uh  clears throat  the thing is  you sort of think  Everything  and anything  How much did it cost you  It was nothing  It didn't cost you anything  No  I heard it was thirty pounds  Cos I 've to get  one done   That 's  private is it not  That 's if you want it done privately  What 's the difference  between a private and a public AIDS test then  Why do you have to get it done  I 've to get one done in January   Why do you have to get it done   A horrible experience  They made me wait for an hour  It was a horrible experience  for you because the the possibility was there   4 sylls    Where did you get it done  At your doctor  The uh STD clinic  Where 's that  It 's  In the Royal  The Royal yeah  Yeah  Mm  I heard it was thirteen pounds to get it done at the university  Mm you get it done by second year med students then  It 's better than getting  a bill  in the post  They 'd probably give it to you   Well that must be  dear sir just to give you full value for money for your thirty quid  here 's a positive result  We wouldn't like to see you sold short  Nightmare  The worst thing about it was  the fact that I rang up to find if the result was in  and this guy answered the phone and he sounded really cheery  And he went  hello yes and I I I said is my result through yet  He said hold on sir sure  I 'll just go and check  What 's your name and date of birth and all the rest of it  So then he he was so cheerful  and then he went off and he fissled about for about five minutes  And he seemed to be taking ages  And then he came back and he went  yes uhm your results are in  And I thought fucking hell  because he 's got a completely different attitude in his voice here  Complete change  I thought  I have it  So I ran out of the office at two hundred miles per hour  clears throat  said I had had a headache  Straight into the Lagan  Straight into the the car  My feet were like  my legs were like jelly running  out to the car   Why didn't you  wait until they give it to you   several sylls    Can't tell you on the phone   They won't tell you on the phone  Oh right  And so what happened when you arrived  Well when I got there I had to wait for an hour  And I said look  uhm you know I really think it 's a positive result  Can you not let me see somebody and get this over with  And uh she said  you have to wait your turn  And then they called me ahead of somebody else so I thought  well this is it   They 're putting me ahead of some other people  I went in to get the glorious news  And then  the doctor  sort of popped her head round the door  uh first of all before calling me  And then called and then she called me through  And I looked at her  and she went  I says have you got the result  She said it 's there  Tell us for  sake  What  growl  Result  Negative    4 sylls   Jackanory  You go on like a pain in the ass too you can like  Did she tell you or did she hand you a form that said on it  She well the funny thing is  uhm  Or did she invite you to pull a  black curtain   No she just  told me it was negative and that was it
