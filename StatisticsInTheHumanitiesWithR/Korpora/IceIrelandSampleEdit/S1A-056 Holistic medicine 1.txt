<S1A-056 Holistic medicine 1>  What are you going to tell us anyway  Oh the girl from upstairs came down the other night and she said uhm  I got a long-distance phonecall about ten minutes ago  Did you pick up the phone  And I said no  She said well it was either you or the girls next door  She said and if I picked it up as well  Cos you know the way  if the phone rings only the person upstairs can answer it  sigh  uhm I well she thought that I answered   and I didn't  And she was kind of accusing and said she was going to go and tell the landlord  And that only she  heard the phone ring as well and she picked   Mm   What 's the landlord going to do   give out to me  laughter   And then you 'll stand there and say I 'm innocent  Well I mean like it had to be somebody down here  cos we 're the only ones with extensions  So someone was listening to her phonecall  Was that what she was saying  No it rang  and she said that before she got a chance to get to the phone  Yeah  Somebody down here  or answered the phone  and then said that she wasn't there  Oh right  And she was like  And she said that when she had answered it she recognised  the voice and she knew  that she had to ring them back  But otherwise she wouldn't have known  She said the person didn't even go up  to ring her bell to see was she there  And she was going to the landlord straight with it  And I said well it wasn't me  She said well it was either you or the girls next door because  the other girl wasn't there  And she said uhm and they say they didn't do it so it has to be one of you  And I said well look you know I 've been living here  it 's my second year here you know and  you know kind of  if there 's you know there haven't been complaints about it before like  one could  conclude that it wasn't me  So anyway  laughter  she said oh well I don't think it was you she said cos the girls next door weren't very nice to her about it  Anyway she 's going to tell the landlord  She made a  she said she 's living even she 's been living here for the last five years  Oh my God    Can you  imagine  Like this this woman is a  this woman is a full-time  you know  And like wouldn't you think like that by now she 'd have gotten somewhere kind of more  I don't know imagine a place like this  Whoa  That 's a bit long   This place is really nice  I think it 's absolutely  fantastic   Well it  has its disadvantages  You think it 's  what   I think it 's better than most places   I think it 's fantastic  Can I just get a glass of water  Yeah sure  I need to plonk myself over here  1 syll   Okay Michelle  Is the heat on  Yeah  2 sylls   1 syll    Is it still on   Well it 's kind  of warm   Lukewarm   I think it comes on at around five or half five  you

laughter   Do you remember do you remember the place that I stayed in in first year  The place  in Swan Grove  Well the son  do you remember the model  Yeah   No  Oh yeah he was gorgeous   Did you ever call out  laughter  He was lovely  He was also engaged but anyway   laughter  anyway  the parents never cooked for him  They never really ate at all  I don't know what they did but I mean I was the only one  that ever seemed to cook  Oh yeah  fast food kind of thing  But anyway  they just let him do whatever he wanted and they used to buy him paper plates  and paper and you know plastic knives and forks  because he wouldn't wash up  And this was all he had to do then afterwards was  Chips all the time  2 sylls    He was living at home  Yeah this this guy was like twenty-two or three was he  Mm  And uh would put a pizza in the microwave  and eat it off this paper plate  and use the plastic knife and fork and then like just throw it in the bin  Oh God  No washing up  No mess  Nothing  Great idea  They were so they were very tidy weren't they  That 's true  but then like   Oh yeah   The place  was always clean  But I don't think they ever used  the kitchen   But they  smoked well didn't  yeah  I think that was a great idea  Do you want to sit down  Oh come on  I even hate drinking out of those plastic cups in the  the Hamilton   The Hamilton yeah   They 're disgusting  You taste the the the what 's that  stuff   Polystyrene   Okay a mug or two might be nice but plates like you don't need plates  You could throw them away  laughter   You 're

she gets up  Does she  li  uh it 's supposed to be very good for you  Does she have uhm  Yeah it cleanses the system or something I don't know  Flushes  you out   It 's supposed to be  good if you have arthritis  Arthritis  Yeah well rheumatism one of those  That 's the joints and bones one  Just to  lubricate  laughter   Oil the joints  Vaseline  That and uh cod liver oil and  all of  those primrose oil  Yeah   Ah but I mean come off it  how many people are taking all those things  and they still   An awful lot of  people   Yeah but they still end up with  There 's a woman who was in my sign class last year  We all all ended up going out to her house during the summer  And she swears by magnets  By magnets  Magnets she  And what  do you do   What are you  supposed to do with magnets  she 's two big ones right  Now they 're really big heavy like you know the way  when you 're pulling magnets apart there can be a bit of resistance  Mm  Well these are real like strain your muscles and they 're really big strong ones  Uhm she puts them  something like either side of her bed at night or  no she puts them  in the bed at night  with her   Yeah   I 'm in bed with magnets  laughter   Yeah she 's little ones just like  around her legs    1 syll  Cats dogs men even  laughter   around her legs  And then  during the day  or at some stage as well she has two glasses of water and she puts one  on a north  side of a magnet  Puts  the other magnet with the south side with the other glass of water on that  Big tall glass  now  She gets up in the morning and she takes this water and she  drinks half-and-half together  and she drinks the two glasses  like she mixes it all together  and  then drinks a glass in the morning a glass  for lunch a glass in the evening and she swears by it  And she says now  when she first started to tell us this like she also doesn't take any of the red meat wine all the things you 're supposed to  Yeah   Mm   Mm   That 's really  kind of   And where  does she get protein from then   magic stuff   Oh she has  chicken and fish  No it 's all alternative medicine and holistic medicine stuff  She swears by it  And she claims that like she 's very very bad arthritis  and  it 's only because she limits herself so much in her diet  and what she takes in that  Mm   Must work  Does it  She 's able to move  I mean when she first started telling us I thought oh my God she 's loola but like  laughter  but by the time she finished  I was convinced  She claims that like uh Christmas time she 'd half a glass of white wine  Yeah  And she just  st  froze in an instant  Like she couldn't  she 'd a neighbour over or something and uhm they a  a had half a glass together and the neighbour noticed when she stood up that she  Couldn't move  Feeling yeah  And she said now with the water she 'll notice when  if she misses you know if she doesn't drink  her glass   And that could  be psychological as well  Yeah   Absolutely   Yeah well you 're always   Well it could be  but you see then she  we were all I mean we were very sceptical  We were like we were sort of going to her yeah right  She 'd been down to this holistic medicine conference thing in  I think they 're a pack of  Kildare  or Galway  or some  or some place in the country uhm  If you say so Deborah   Outside the Pale  laughter   Outside   Oh yes  see  Somewhere outside Dublin  And uhm  one of the guys there apparently they 're all into the magnetic things  It was actually her reflexologist who   gave her them  She goes for reflexology as well to keep the arthritis  And uhm  this guy who  That 's very yah   Is she old  she 'd be in uh uh uh  I 'd say her late forties early fifties  And she 's riddled with arthritis  already   And she 's  got it very bad like  I mean she lives on her own  Her she 's quite a sad life like  Her fiance/  died she was   Attaching  her magnets  laughter  She was engaged and her  fiance/  died like  She was engaged late in life  and she was living with her mother and her brother and they both died as well like  oh within  no this was like when she was telling us this this was like my mother died my brother died and then my fiance/ died  laughter  I mean it 's tragic like but it 's just  so much that she just  Oh dear   She says laughing   What uh oh  God   If you  can't cope with it  laugh at it   So she lives  on her own like  So she 's able to do all this with her diet like  Mm
