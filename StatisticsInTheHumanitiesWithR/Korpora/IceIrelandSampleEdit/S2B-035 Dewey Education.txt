<S2B-035 Dewey Education>  That was linguist and philosopher  Noam Chomsky  recalling his memory of attending a Dewey progressive school in the nineteen thirties  John Dewey  who was to become one of the most powerful influences on educational thought in the twentieth century  was born in the town of Burlington Vermont in eighteen fifty-nine  His father was proprietor of the local general store  where apparently  locals would foregather from time to time to discuss with equal interest  affairs of both state and locality  According to one apocryphal story  the store window carried the legend  hams and cigars smoked and unsmoked  The intimate small-town ethos of nineteenth-century Burlington played a large part in forming Dewey 's educational outlook in two ways  one negative  one positive  On the negative side he was convinced at a very early stage that the traditional  deskbound approach to schooling  which was typified by the small town and rural schools of his childhood  was futile  This kind of schooling was inadequate for the growing USA  a new society being born out of a simple agricultural economy  which was being transformed by unprecedented industrialisation  immigration  rapid population growth and drastic social change  American speaker   On the positive side  Dewey was convinced that the ordinary contacts of day-to-day community life  be they social  economic  cultural or political  provided real and significant learning situations  For Dewey  politics was not just a matter of national importance removed from the concern of the ordinary citizen  but a matter of vital and immediate interest to the community  He believed that the school should prepare the child for active participation in the life of the community  He believed that education must break down  rather than reinforce  the gap between the experience of schooling and to the needs of a truly participatory democracy  American speaker  musical interlude   Dewey graduated from the University of Vermont in eighteen seventy-nine  After a period spent teaching high school he went to Johns Hopkins University where he gained his PhD degree in eighteen eighty-four  By his middle thirties he was head of the Department of Philosophy  Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of Chicago  It was here in eighteen ninety-six that Dewey established his famous Laboratory School  Dewey 's Laboratory School was not intended to implement a structured pedagogical plan  It was intended as a laboratory in two senses  Firstly  it was intended to facilitate research and experimentation into new principles and methods  And secondly  it was designed to allow the children to take an experimental approach to their own learning  The Laboratory School was to be the testing ground for Dewey 's philosophical ideas and their implementation  American speaker   The furniture of the traditional school tells the story of traditional education  It is a story of submission  immobility  passivity and dependency  American speaker   Dewey 's approach was not a matter of whim or of arbitrary convictions about school design  but a central feature of his philosophy  He wanted the Laboratory School to provide learners with the opportunity to create their own experience  to experiment  to inquire  to create  He wanted a classroom where children could move about  form groups  plan and execute activities  In short  learn for themselves under the direction and guidance of the teacher  American speaker   In the old system  it was the function of teachers to motivate the child  against his or her immediate interests  to learn the established subjects  American speaker   In Dewey 's pedagogy  the teacher has two main functions  The teacher must guide the young through the complexities of life  and give them opportunities to learn in the natural way  that is by solving relevant problems  The teacher must also enable the young to cope adequately with contemporary conditions  and to cope with the new tasks which an unpredictable future will bring  American speaker   The old model of education placed a premium on assignments  on private isolated study and on recitation  The mission of the Laboratory School was to find more effective ways of learning and teaching  to find ways of breaking down barriers between schools and their local communities  and to find subject-matter which would break the hold of traditional rote learning and symbol interpretation  American speaker   This approach to schooling sets the pupils ' experience at nought against the accumulated knowledge of the race  The pupil is made into a passive receptacle whose only function is to receive the structured subject matter which scholars have codified  American speaker   By contrast to the traditional approach  Dewey put the pupil at the centre of education as a wilful  purposive  and active agent in the learning process  American speaker  musical interlude   The Laboratory School operated on three simple principles which informed Dewey 's educational philosophy  The first principle was that the business of the school is to train children in co-operative and mutually helpful living  to help them to grow into community  American speaker   The second principle was that the foundation of all educative activity must be in the instinctive impulsive activities of the child and not in the presentation and application of structured external material  American speaker   This learning is rooted in the community  The individual and society cannot be considered in isolation  one from the other  American speaker   Finally  the Laboratory School promoted the child 's individual tendencies and activities  These were to be organised and directed to promote the idea of co-operative living  The learning process would take advantage of the child 's individual tendencies and activities  to reproduce on the child 's plane the typical doings and occupations of the larger  maturer society  into which the child is finally to emerge  American speaker  musical interlude   In nineteen o-four Dewey was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University  and it was from this base that he articulated and spread the educational ideas which he had developed at the Chicago Laboratory School  They were to make him the most famous and influential educator of the twentieth century  He wrote  lectured and travelled extensively  On his retirement in nineteen thirty  he became Emeritus Professor at Columbia  It is one of the difficulties that Dewey presents to anyone who would present a short pre/cis of his career  that he lived to the age of ninety-three  active to the end  He married for the second time and started a second family at the age of eighty-seven  Although education may be or should be practical it is not the practicality of a narrowly vocational preparation  American speaker   A central concept in Dewey 's philosophy of education  and to this day perhaps the most controversial  is his concept of growth  Dewey does not accept what are called teleological explanations of human effort  These are explanations which place the significance of human effort in the distant future  They attempt to explain present events by future ones  such as  the eventual dictatorship of the proletariat  the eventual attainment of the beatific vision  or whatever  In all cases they invoke some future perfection  both to explain what we are doing now  and to stipulate what we should be doing now  Teleological explanations are especially favoured by educational theorists  From a definition of some manner of idealised future  you can determine what we should be teaching our children in the present  Dewey rejects teleological explanations  He prefers an evolutionary account of human activity which freely acknowledges our ignorance of the future  In Dewey 's account  education is not a preparation for some idealised future  It is simply growth  the continuing reconstruction of our experience  It is not determined by any outside or independent aim or end  American speaker   This is difficult for traditional educators to accept  because they have always looked for the purpose and significance of education outside of the educational process itself  But the growth of which Dewey speaks is not growth towards some predetermined and externally-imposed ideal or end  American speaker   For Dewey  there is no limit in principle to the possibilities of change  development  and evolution  We simply do not know what the future holds musical interlude   The child 's relation to the curriculum is not the subordination of the child to the existing established knowledge  Nor is it the abandonment of established existing knowledge for an anarchic child-centred approach  American speaker   But later the child must come to learn the ways in which human knowledge has been structured into subjects or disciplines  But this is not the starting point  It is a development on the journey  There must first be something in the child 's experience which requires or demands this or that symbol  this or that discipline  this or that subject  before these mean anything to the child  The child 's use of language for instance  must spring from the child 's own experience whether this be actual or imaginative  American speaker   The child 's education  the child 's growth  is a gradual differentiation of this organic experience into what is represented by the traditional categories of knowledge  such as geography  history  mathematics  literature  et-cetera  American speaker   As well as growing up  the child grows out into the world mediated by structured human knowledge  Dewey 's pragmatist philosophy stresses the priority of experience over theory  We learn to think and reason by thinking and reasoning  by tackling real problems which arise in our experience  When we think  we become conscious of a problem or obstacle to our development  We analyse the situation  we identify possible solutions  we compare the implications of the different solutions and we select the best course of action  We implement this in practice   Dewey 's philosophy is about dealing with problems which arise out of real situations  It aims at control  It stresses that solutions to problems are tentative  and are to be judged by their usefulness  Its method is the method of science  It aims at the control of the environment and improvement of the environment by creative and reflective thought  The educational manifestation of scientific method is the project method associated with Dewey and his close follower William H Kilpatrick  The project method certainly does not mean the transcription of so-called information from encyclopaedias and other sources of second-hand information  accompanied by illustrations to be hung on the classroom wall to impress important visitors  The principle value of a project is the experience of doing it  not the end result  In more general terms the practical importance of the result of thinking is subsidiary to the process of thinking  The control and direction of inquiry is central in Dewey 's theory of education  Knowledge begins in doing  It is active  It is in the course of putting ideas to the test of experience that growth occurs  Dewey requires that pupils be given wide opportunities for purposive inquiry  This is as seen in the project method  The pupil learns only by thinking about problems and trying to solve them for himself  American speaker   It is like the difference between studying a map and making a journey  While the map is a useful guide for the traveller  it is not a substitute for the experience of travelling  American speaker   That is to say that solving a problem is making an incoherent situation coherent and integrated  When we solve a problem  we take a selection of apparently incompatible experiences  and transform them into a unified whole  This unified whole is the solution to the problem  American speaker  musical interlude /&>  Dewey is sometimes associated with the worst excesses of so-called progressive education  a do-as-you-please approach  which it must be said exists more often in people 's imagination than in actual classrooms  He was however forced to distance himself on a number of occasions from those who claimed to be his disciples  Referring to the misapplication of the project method he wrote  American speaker   Dewey 's contribution to the development of education in the twentieth century has been incalculable  if not without its controversies  His greatest contribution has been to liberate the education of children from the dead hand of tradition  and from what he himself has called the static cold storage ideal of knowledge  He forged a theory and practice of education which can be relevant to contemporary industrial and social progress  without becoming the slave of either
