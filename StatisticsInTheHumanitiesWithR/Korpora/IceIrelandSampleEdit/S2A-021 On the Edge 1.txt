<S2A-021 On the Edge 1>  It was coming up to the time when we really had to book  And I had said to my husband right  I 'm going to take Darren to the doctor  I 'm going to find out what 's going on and then he 'll get on and get the holiday organised  It was a Monday  We went to the doctor  and he said  that he was worried about it and he said I would like you to go to the Royal and have an X-ray  but I will stay here until I hear from you  And at the time I didn't think anything of it  So we went to the Royal  It was a beautiful afternoon  And sat in the Royal until Darren had his X-ray  And they came out then after a few hours and said that his X-ray was fine and uhm  they would give him some physiotherapy  So they said they would organise it and they would let him know  So we came home  I rang the doctor and at the time the thing I remember most was  when I said to him well they said everything 's fine there was just silence on the other end of the phone  And then he said oh well  that 's okay Angela but if you want to bring him down again you know  Now on the Friday morning  I got this phonecall at home  it was the Royal and that they would like me to bring Darren down again  So I got Darren out of school  and went down  to be met by a consultant  who said that he was very concerned  about the X-ray  That when the X-ray had actually been reported on  they uh weren't happy with the findings  and they would like me to go to Musgrave Park  we made an appointment and went to Musgrave Park  My husband and I both went with Darren  He wasn't unduly concerned I have to say  and took great delight in saying I told you so  I told you there was something wrong with me and you wouldn't listen to me you know while I had all these guilt feelings that you do have  But uhm  never for one minute  expecting to hear what they did actually say  We were told about this swelling that had appeared in Darren 's arm  and that there was cause for concern  He said that he would need treatment to try and reduce the swelling  that the bone was affected but what they hoped to be able to do was to remove the bone  and put in a prosthesis  They said we would have to go to Birmingham for this but before that would happen Darren would have to have some treatment to try and reduce the swelling  Nobody had ever mentioned cancer  Nobody had mentioned tumour  They had just mentioned this swelling   He was very  very upfront about it  more upfront than what we were  I think to him  he didn't actually fully grasp you know what it was going to entail  But after the first bout of chemotherapy he certainly knew what what 'd hit him  Wasn't impressed  uhm didn't like it one bit  and told them so  But they managed to persuade him you know that this would do him good  at the end of it all  I think because he knew he was going to Birmingham and they said he needed a few sessions so he was quite happy to put up with that  But when we went back on the Friday  the swelling in Darren 's arm had actually grown bigger  and there was great concern about this  And we were told we had to go to Birmingham right away  Darren and I flew over  Campbell and Paul stayed behind  is a nightmare  because when you 're split like that and you 're going away  you have absolutely nobody else to uhm  talk to to confer with to  to say what you 're thinking or what you 're feeling  So we went there and Darren was measured for his prosthesis  We then came home again  for Darren to try the the chemotherapy again  It wasn't to be  It I mean chemotherapy just wasn't working at that particular time  So we had to go back to Birmingham  interference  and they would have to operate  Darren had to go to theatre  Campbell flew over on the Wednesday and Paul had to stay with with family  It was a very rough time for him  They  they were quite hopeful  So were we  So was Darren  They had told me they would ring up and they would let me know how things were going  But as the afternoon moved on  that didn't materialize  and I was more and more certain in my own mind that something  quite drastic had happened  So about a quarter to five the staff nurse came and said you know go down to the office and Professor  1 syll  coming up and he 's going to have a word with you  And in fact I was actually Dr Carter who came up  said that he was very sorry  that uhm  this tumour had uh actually got such a hold that it was impossible to save Darren 's arm  And we were absolutely devastated  not as much as what we were later on whenever we discovered the extent of it  I didn't actually realize that they had actually taken his shoulder and his arm  away altogether  That 's absolutely horrendous  to say the least  His dad was brilliant  I went to pieces  He came up from from ICU the next day and was absolutely  brilliant  I don't know where they get the courage from or where they get the energy from  He wanted to see what it looked like  And on the Saturday morning Sister was pulling her hair out because Darren apparently had gone to the loo and started to un-bandage himself to see what what was behind the the this camouflage  Once he seen it he was  I wouldn't say quite happy  but he had actually faced up to it and he knew what was behind it and it was no big problem to him then  We coped  I mean you don't get up in the morning and say oh today I 'm going to cope or you don't go to bed at night and say oh I 've coped today  You carry on because unfortunately  you have to carry on  Darren 's attitude was that he had a lot to do and he was going to get on with it and this having just one arm was not going to stop him  We had very very very mixed emotions  we were very proud of him on one hand  and at other times very angry because we felt he was trying to do too much  He really couldn't deal with people staring at him as if he was uh in his words a freak which had happened actually when when we were in Birmingham and they had  four or five of them had gone out to get videos  and of course there was some in wheelchairs you know there was some on crutches and Darren had the one arm  you know and they had sort of gone along in a line apparently down the road  you know he said that you know he could see the people looking at them  You could see the people looking out the bus windows at them  You could see the cars  And when he came back  and was saying this you know he said oh the freak show has returned  In a way I was very angry that anybody would look on my child as a freak  But in another sense I was very proud you know because he had this this way of dealing with it  People 's reaction affects you a great deal  Some people want to cross the street  Some people drop their head  Some people do ask you how you 're doing how he was doing  And I know it 's very difficult  but it is actually very difficult for you  and in the end you end up  trying to put people at their ease so they can speak to you which makes it doubly hard  Darren made it very easy  for everybody  His friends didn't treat him any differently which I I was very surprised about  The people that he  was close to he continued to be close with  He decided that he wanted to do photography and  went to Rupert Stanley  Set about uhm getting a camera  Didn't want one of these automatic things that did everything  He wanted a camera that he actually had to set up and work the lens and all the rest but with one arm it 's very difficult  But Musgrave Park came up with this shoulder-holster thing that he could put on and he could attach his camera to which then left his hand free  got himself a girlfriend called Sharon  went off to Scotland went to London  He uhm did quite a lot of things became very very positive  We on the other hand sort of struggled from day to day  It was never actually mentioned  You know nobody ever said sort of what the end of result of this was going to be   That Christmas we actually decided right we 're going to have a brilliant Christmas  We organised loads of things absolutely loads of things  We didn't give ourselves any time at all  uhm to think about it  And then in the February of eighty-nine  we got this letter asking us to bring  for Darren to go for a scan  for whatever reason  the hairs on the back of my neck just started to prickle  and I couldn't figure out why because Darren had been going for his chemotherapy  There had never been any mention of going for a scan  And I decided right  I 'm going to find out more about it  So I made an appointment with the consultant  It was absolutely tipping down with rain  It was a Thursday afternoon  And I went  and I met him and I said to him you know why this  And he said well you know Darren 's had an X-ray and things aren't really looking very good  And I said but he 's had his chemotherapy  And he said yes he has  uhm but unfortunately it didn't do the trick  So then I said to him  you know is it is it really that bad  And he said yes  So that was me he had this this woman who was pacing up and down  his floor asking him these questions which he didn't really want to  to be asked and which he certainly didn't want to answer  But this this this parent who who wanted to get to the bottom of it  So then I said to him you know uhm is Darren going to die  And he said yes he is  uhm  he said yes  He says unfortunately Darren is going to die  And I said to him  you 'll most probably not want to answer this but is there a timescale  And he said yes  He said  uhm I would 've would reckon that Darren wouldn't live much  after about eight months  You keep hoping that that they 've made a mistake that it 's somebody else they 're talking about  uhm  they 've got the wrong X-rays they 've got the wrong reports they 've got everything wrong you know that it 's not actually going to happen to your son  The following Tuesday  we took Darren to down to hospital again  He went in  I as usual sat outside  And he came out  and Dr Robertson just said that uhm Darren didn't want any more chemotherapy  And I just looked at him  in amazement  And I never spoke  I never said a word  And he just said you know we 'll send for Darren  uhm for his X-rays and bloods as usual  So we came out and got into the car  and I drove up the motorway like an absolute lunatic  absolute lunatic  shouting at this child you know and why are you not having any more chemotherapy  And he just said well  he said what is the point  He says I have asked them is it going to cure me  He has said no
