<S1A-043 Drinking>  I laughed I I met Tim came up to the town the day  And I says to Tim well what about Jackie  Have you heard any word  He says aye  He says I believe he says Mary  he says got drunk on Saint Patrick 's night  There were at  Are they all away on holidays  or   Well  there there 's Mary and Johnnie and Jackie   Jackie   Johnnie  doesn't drink does he  Or does he  Jackie uh uh Mary only drinks freely when she 's away on holidays or when she 's she 's you know she goes away  Like uh I was telling you about Violet and and Mark Conyngham took her in the wheelchair up to   2 sylls   Aye  well  I was saying I  was saying to Tim   Oh Christ aye   Kraut   Have you heard  that story  No  I was saying to Tim I says well what about them  He says I heard  He says Jackie phoned me last week  He says Mary got drunk  Now she only ever uh ever ever gets drunk when she goes on holidays  And she  laughter  she goes on holidays  Just like you Mary  laughter   She 's too scared  3 sylls  So he says she she got drunk on Saint Patrick 's night  We painted her face green  laughter  And she was sitting in this bar with this paint  laughter  I says cos  This is Paul Duke 's sister and her and her and her her brother-in-law  Oh right  And and thingy  But Mary went away God rest Lilly  Lilly would 've been my best friend  And before Lilly died  two years ago I mean she she started it was just the the start of her being really ill  and they went to Lourdes  And Lilly and Mary  and it was  Paul 's brother uh  Bo  uh Bob was running the trip to Lourdes  And Bob would be very uh  what would you say Bob would  be  pious  Bob would  be very pious  And  he does   Pious   Oh right   That 's Bob  I always think now  Bob Bob wouldn't drink and he doesn't smoke  and  he 'd maybe go to Mass twice a day  And Bob would and  laughter  all the rest of the Dukes would be  would maybe  be a wee bit sort of would enjoy their drink and would be full of the devilment  So Lilly anyway went but she wasn't feeling great so she didn't go out of her hotel all that that much  Mary the next sister up Mary would only ever really take enjoy a drink when she would go away on holidays like that  laughter  So  Mary had been up at the  the Grotto  Mary had been up at the Grotto   3 sylls   done her done her praying done her thingy and come back and done aye exactly and got pissed  laughter  So  Violet next door and big Sam across the street anyway decided that they would go up to the grotto that night and Mary was really that drunk that she couldn't walk  So they put Mary into a wheelchair  laughter   Uh-huh    3 sylls    At Lourdes   laughter   Where 's the nearest pub   Can you see where this story 's going  So aye they were pushing Mary up the hill and Mary was really well on  And they were pushing up pushing that way and this was well on at night anyway  So the the entrance into the bottom of the grotto was locked so they had to push her up to the top up up this hill up to the top of the grotto right  To the grotto  laughter   So right  right   Wait til  you hear  So Sam Violet said that won't take us  You pull her  Devilment  So they were pushing Mary up but Mary was really well pissed  And as I say Bobby is so  really pious  So they they didn't  count on meeting Bobby  They thought Bobby would 've had all his praying done  laughter  So the next thing to came out of the side gate was Bobby you see  And Mary looked up and says oh Jesus Christ there 's our Bobby coming  And Violet says  Mary sit there and don't don't open your mouth  We 'll do the talking for you you see  For Violet and Sam weren't as pissed as  Mary you see   Are they all  sisters and  brother   Well  Violet 's my next door neighbour right  Violet 's your next door neighbour  Yes yes yes   Right  Sam  Conyngham who lives over a few doors  Lilly lived over there  and Mary  So Mary and Lilly were two two sisters and Bobby was Lilly 's twin  brother  And Bobby was organising it  the thingy and Bobby 's the one that doesn't drink  So and he frowns very very badly on anybody that got drunk and smoking sort of  So Violet says we 'll push you up this hill anyway  And and and the next thing that came out of the gate was Bridie and Bobby  And Violet says oh Jesus Christ  Mary there 's your Bobby  And Mary says oh dear God  Violet says Mary sit there and don't don't open your mouth  We 'll do the talking for to  for you 're too drunk  Don't you bother open your mouth  So he came out and he says  what are you doing in that wheelchair  And Violet says och her legs was sore  We decided she wants to do a wee bit of praying and we decided to push her  laughter  So Mary Mary never says a a word you see  And Bobby looked at her very suspiciously anyway and went on down the hill  So they pushed her up round and into the grotto and into where the fountains was  So when I the minute Mary got in you see she was grand  She got up out of the the chair and went into the fountain  And all these German and French  laughter   several sylls   started shouting it 's a miracle  And everybody came over clapped hands  laughter  I says Mary I 'm affronted  several sylls  There 's no cause for affront  she says  2 syllables  So she only she only ever gets drunk when she goes  on holiday   Right   It 's a miracle   What did she  do then  She got back into the wheelchair and  laughter  they pushed her back down the hill  pushed her back back down to the hotel  And uh Tim was saying now I was talking to Tim what was the day I says well Tim I says
