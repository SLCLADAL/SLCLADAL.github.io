<S2A-063 Injury decision>  Bertoni uh seeks damages for personal injuries loss and damage sustained by him as a result of an accident which occurred on the sixteenth of June nineteen ninety-six at about twelve fifteen in the afternoon  Uh Mr Bertoni was born on the eighteenth of January nineteen eighty-two and so was uh about fourteen and a half when when the accident occurred  The claim was brought again the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and it is agreed that uh it is the agency responsible uh for the uh area which exists between uh a uh railing uh at Rosedale uh Street and the uh the peace line which exists uh some distance behind it  The area between the railings and the fence uh is a grassy area and uh as uh appears from the photographs the grass the grassy area in general is uh relatively flat  appears to be relatively well maintained  particularly having regard to where it is located  But at the far side of the grass area  that is the area closest to the peace line itself  there is an area of rougher ground which seems to consist of uh weeds or shrubs which have grown up around the base of the fence  Uh there 's also located uh somewhere there uhm a junction box of some kind which may have belonged to uhm British Telecom  It is uh made of uh metal and it appears one side of it has been pulled away in part uh and uh raised up almost to ninety degrees so that it projects out into uh the grassy area  Immediately below uh this projecting flap uh is a an area of much rougher ground uh when compared uh to the rest of this uh what I might call no man 's land  Uh there appears to be uh bits of bricks  some stones  loose rubble and the ground appears to have been worn away uh immediately uh below the flap  It 's clear that this area was used uh by uh children in the district and there is graffiti on the peace line  the railings have been prised apart in one place at least so as to give access to the area and I am satisfied from the evidence that this was used in a bizarre way as a play area for children in the district  The evidence of Mr Bertoni is that on uh the sixteenth of June he was with his uh uncle  uh Mr Frederick McSweeny who was then about twenty-six or twenty-seven  They had a ball and they were uh playing football of sorts  Uh but his uncle kicked the football towards him whilst he had his back to the uh railings  the ball went over the railings  uh and that he then went uh through a gap in the railings to retrieve the ball  went over to the area of the uh junction box uh doing so at what appears to have been a jogging pace and as he got close to the box  noticed the ball underneath it  stumbled and hit his head uh against the edge of the metal flap and he then sustained a fairly significant injury to the side of his head which has left some permanent scarring  The uh plaintiff uh  is is frank in saying that he 's not absolutely clear what it was caused him to stumble  uh he he thought initially that it was uh some rubble and then answers  in answers given to me uh he said he thought that perhaps it could have been a hole in the ground  I think it 's clear that he doesn't really know what caused him to stumble  I 'm satisfied that this accident uh occurred uh in the way in which the uh plaintiff uh has suggested  But no alternative version of events has been uh given by the defendants for the obvious reason that no representative of the Housing Executive was present and no uh independent witnesses appear to be available  And so to a considerable degree uh the Housing Executive is uh unable to contradict the evidence of the plaintiff  But in any event I 'm satisfied by the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr McSweeny that his general account of what happened is true  In those uh circumstances uh he uh is in law a trespasser on this uh piece of ground occupied uh by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive  It 's necessary therefore to consider the uh extent of the duty of care owed to a person in that position  Uh helpfully the uh duty of care has been defined now by statute and in the Occupiers ' Liability Northern Ireland Order nineteen eighty-seven uh article three uh subarticle three  it is provided as follows  an occupier of premises owes a duty to another not being his visitor in respect of any such risk as is referred to in paragraph one if  he is aware of the danger or has reasonable grounds to believe that it exists  he knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the other is in the vicinity of the danger concerned or that he may come into the vicinity of the danger  in either case whether the other has lawful authority for being in that vicinity or not  And the risk is one against which in all the circumstances of the case he may reasonably be expected to offer the others some protection  Uh paragraph one uh refers to the risk of injury  I 'm satisfied that the uh Northern Ireland Housing Executive had reasonable grounds to believe that the danger existed  The area was maintained by them quite clearly on a regular basis and uh no doubt routine inspections uh occurred because the grass has been kept cut down to uh a reasonable level  again having particular regard to where the area is located  Uh and I 'm satisfied that uh any of their servants or agents going on to the land uh in the ordinary way and uh checking it for uh any dangers would have had no difficulty in discerning that the raised metal flap from this box constituted a danger  I 'm also satisfied uh that the uh Housing Executive had reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff or uh someone of his age and uh experience of life would come into the vicinity uh that is into this area uh which had become something of a playground and that uh he would therefore be in the vicinity of the danger  I 'm also satisfied that the risk uh which was presented by this projecting metal flap was uh one which it was reasonable to expect the Housing Executive to uh prevent uh and to ensure that it didn't uh cause damage to anyone who came on the land  be they trespasser or not  The standard of care uh is uh set out uh in article  subarticle four uh of article three and is stated as follows  where by virtue of this article an occupier of premises owes a duty to another in respect of such as list  and there 's a list is in here  the duty is to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to see that he does not suffer injury on the premises by reason of the danger concerned  Now I 've indicated this was a clearly foreseeable risk and I 'm satisfied that in measuring a standard of care the uh court should keep a balance between the degree of risk and the danger presented by the risk compared with the uh relative cost and convenience of correcting it or removing it  I 'm satisfied that the projecting metal flap presented a high risk of injury to anyone uh close by and that the cost of correcting it would have been completely trivial in in comparison  Uh this is something which could have been corrected by a phonecall to whoever was responsible for putting it there in the first place or by having some fairly simple and uh routine repair uh effected or having the metal flap removed  In those circumstances I 'm satisfied that the plaintiff has established liability against the defendant  It is suggested that he was guilty of contributory negligence in that he failed to take reasonable care for his own safety  I 'm satisfied that the plaintiff uh stumbled when he was not expecting it  even if he is unclear what caused him to stumble  I do not consider that uh a fourteen year old uh jogging uh at a relatively gentle pace across uh a relatively well-maintained green area uh and losing his footing can be said to constitute uh culpable behaviour on his part  In those circumstances uh I 'm not satisfied that the defendant has established that there was any contributory negligence  I shall therefore uh dismiss the appeal  Uhm the plaintiff 's injuries uh are in the form now of permanent scarring  I observed him in the witness box  I note that although the scar is in the hairline that uh it  it 's obvious from a considerable distance and I can see it from the bench uh where he is sitting some perhaps uh twenty-five thirty feet away  In the circumstances I 'm satisfied that the award of the County Court judge was a reasonable award
