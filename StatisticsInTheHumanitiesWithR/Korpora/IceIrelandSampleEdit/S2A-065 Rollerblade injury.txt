<S2A-065 Rollerblade injury>  Now very briefly  reminding again the court first of all that she 's six years of age or six at the time  In relation to your account of how it happened I 'd say to Your Lordship it was a very clear account  the the key to it in one sense is perhaps that last answer which is something that you gave in evidence  5 sylls  She knows that she went into it totally because her foot was in it afterwards so when her father  4 sylls  or her uncle is really it uh is irrelevant at this stage  And she 's given a very clear account which is uh believable  no inconsistencies would and in engineering terms absolutely consistent with how such an accident could happen  So my position is that there 's no dispute really as to how the accident happened  3 sylls  Now these two photographs  when were they taken  They were taken by Mr Robson uhm  yes they 're quite recent  I 'm sorry I apologise to you  Well I mean are they in evidence  That 's my only concern  Are these in evidence  No objection  They 're served under  several sylls  so they  they 're simply to give you a more general view of the area  The importance of them  if there is any importance to them is just the houses close by and the type of the footpath  It is the sort of the area where it would be quite reasonable for children uh rollerskating because its nature is quite  the road really is quite uh safe  So what I 'd say is that what one has here is a very clear danger on the footpath which would be a danger to pedestrians  There 's a clear breach of the duty to maintain  And come back to this issue  Is someone who is injured in such a defect excluded by reason of the fact that she had rollerblades on rather than using the footpath for simply walking  Now in my submission there  there 's no such exclusion involved  The issue is whether the footpath is dangerous  and it was dangerous  It might be different if if the situation was that her injuries were due not to that danger but to the fact for example Your Lordship gave earlier  the fact that one was simply using the rollerblades  in other words they were propelled in such a way that the injuries were so much more serious due to the fact that  several sylls  I 'm not sure what speeds rollerblades do but let 's say you 'd been doing a speed of twenty miles per hour and you 're flying along the footpath at twenty miles per hour and you come to an uncovered  2 sylls  and you 're propelled ten feet or twenty feet through the air and suffer a very serious head injury  well the the reason for that  the injury  the causation in respect of the injury is the fact that you were using rollerblades  But in a case like this where one was using rollerblades as a child at no apparent excessive speed  what really happens is that she simply catches her foot and goes forward and hits her face  The sort of accident that would happen  that could easily have happened if she was running along the footpath running back to her house  had been walking along  Perhaps walking she may not have gone  gone uh gone down so  sharply  One doesn't know  But one 's entitled to walk  one 's entitled to run  A child of that age  six quite often would be running along  going back home  going back to one of those houses  put her foot in this  foot catches equally uh easily as the rollerblade and she falls forward so the mechanism of the injury is absolutely consistent with the the history of the injury and the fact that she was wearing rollerblades has not increased or contributed to the nature or significance of the injury  Uh even if I was wrong in that  my submission would be if one was using rollerblades in a reasonable fashion uh which might increase slightly the the the injuries which one would suffer  that one would not be excluded in these circumstances  we  may I just reread again this note from Lord Justice McCollum   Well I see I follow that quote by saying this decision of the Court of Appeal is binding in this court and accordingly I have to dismiss the plaintiff 's claim  I 'm not sure whether one would interpret that with reluctance or otherwise  I 'm not sure how I 'd interpret Your Lordship  But it  My recollection is  off the record it was with some reluctance  Yes  But what I what I say there is is is  it 's interesting  if one looks just at the previous page  I 'm sorry you 're on the uh   the  you 're on the uh report book  Yes   Just a few lines before you quote uh  uh Lord Justice McCollum 's uh portion where where you referred Lord Justice McDonnell at that stage was hearing the case in the first instance  sta  said to  to Mr Miller  uh I think there is a heavy enough duty imposed on them without requiring them to make pavements up to the standard of cases where skateboards are or can be used  And I wouldn't have any  any uh disagreement with that  Skateboards obviously require perhaps even a greater level  a greater degree of  I mean the two millimetres wouldn't be safe for a skateboard  That 's what I think  So we 're not saying that you have to make the the footpath be safe for skateboards  what we say is you have to make the footpath safe for pedestrians  But if that danger causes injury to use  someone using other  1 syll  then the Department is liable  And I don't take from uh  subject to what Your Lordship finds and what it says on the  1 syll  I don't take from the uh extract from Lord Justice McCollum 's uh notebook uh the uh decision as saying that uh if you 're using a skateboard or if you 're using uh rollerblades or a bicycle that you do not recover  It seems to me to focus again on this question of what is the standard of the care  what is the standard that is required what is the duty duty of safety for pedestrian traffic  But it doesn't go further in my submission to say then that if the Department breaches that duty that then one is excluded from compensation if one is one is using a pogo stick or one is using a skateboard or uh rollerskates or a bicycle or whatever  several sylls  the arguments  4 sylls  that Your Lordship gave  the open manhole  and you 've one child walking  one child running let 's say  one child using their rollerblades even simply because she 's walking on them  several sylls  it 's a dark evening and both of them end up in uhm an uncovered manhole  are we saying that the running child is entitled to recover and the child because she happens to have rollerblades on her feet  is not entitled to recover  In my submission the law couldn't possibly make such an illogical and irrational distinction  I just want to  I was going to read the the the the portion of the  Lord Justice McCollum  the extract  The absolute decision  the nature of the decision is  it is the duty of the Department in relation to the footpath should be safe for pedestrian travel with all the appurtenances that might reasonably be expected to accompany such travel  And I don't disagree with that  That is the duty  There is no duty to make the the footpath safe for all kinds of traffic such as bicycles and  3 sylls  traffic activities which may not be involved in the description of traffic  And again  it 's hard to see what particular dangers uh might be caused by the cyclist that wouldn't affect pedestrians but again I 'm quite prepared  prepared for this case to agree that the duty  in to see whether the footpath was safe or not  one doesn't look at  2 sylls  and bicycles or other appurtenances  One looks at the uh  the question of whether it 's safe for pedestrians  The emphasis is on pedestrian usage and would include all the ancillary activities such as wheeling prams et-cetera  All kinds of pedestrians are taken into account  that is all kinds of pedestrian use that can reasonably be anticipated  And of course one might argue then  certainly nowadays if you consider the view that by considering using rollerblades or little toys on the footpath uh are something which should be reasonably anticipated  One could think of these type of uh  uh you remember the the   horses with green vehicles and children often wanted pulled along by their parents  You don't say that uh if a two year old child happened to be in one of those and it goes into a large obstacle or equipment in the roadway  the child is not entitled to compensation  Well that might fall into the wheeling pram category  laughs  Yes  Where does one  well  3 sylls  can I ask you about the difference between the wheeling  wheeling  that sort of activity for a child and the uh rollerblades  That 's quite right  so  one comes back to this what I say is the core issue if one looks at the  footpath is it safe or not safe for pedestrians  If it 's unsafe for pedestrians  the fact that the accident occurred and the child was wearing  had uh rollerblades on her feet  the accident wasn't caused by those then she should get compensation  This is  this is a  2 sylls  Again  manifestly unsafe were the words I 've been asked to adopt on it but this isn't a really a long distance away from Your Lordship 's example of the uncovered manhole  uh because it is a very clear danger  it 's a significant danger  and if the other girl had tripped on this walking along  if someone tripped walking at the same time then the child  there would be no question whatsoever that she would be entitled to recover  I have had a look  I looked at the usual standard  several sylls  as regards negligence on places on the highways  Interestingly enough  it doesn't appear that this issue has been argued as far as I can see in  in years  No I 'm sure I uh I searched for that at the time of this other case  Although interestingly enough it doesn't  again it doesn't seem to restrict uh  to pedestrians  3 sylls  in the textbooks as persons using the footpath  For example one of the old examples is the old cellar  uhm openings which collapse under someone  Are you saying that if you 're  if you stand on that and it collapses you 're entitled to recover but if you 're standing on it with a pair of rollerblades  you can't recover  My submission is that just is illogical and the only logical and proper approach is uh looking to the question  the first question  is it unsafe in respect of pedestrian  normal pedestrian use  If it is  then one is entitled to recover unless it 's caused or can be put down to the fact that you had rollerblades on your feet which doesn't  which isn't the situation in this case  Uh and uh my submission is that the Court of Appeal decision cannot be interpreted as saying that uh persons uh wearing rollerblades or using skateboards are excluded  It doesn't say that and I think that is  2 sylls  all of us would know better than this short statement from Lord Justice McCollum  I cannot take from that  and my submission is that the court cannot take from that an exclusion which  several sylls  So not to  not to repeat myself but that is the that is the situation from the plaintiff 's point of view or the argument from the plaintiff 's point of view
