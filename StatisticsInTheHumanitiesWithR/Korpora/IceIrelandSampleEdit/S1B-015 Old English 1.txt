think about  what do you think of the of the of the  of the style of lecture  I don't like it  I think it 's boring   You don't like it  It 's boring  I preferred O'Reilly now   I like it   I like her too  I like it  except that like I 'm really exhausted after her lecture simultaneous and unclear   You 're trying to take down the whole story so simultaneous and unclear   Oh yeah  I mean I  I 'm the very same  I mean that first lecture on Julian of Norwich like  Wednesday  I was glad it was going to be on my  left  left-handed  m  I was going like  makes gesture  all the way down  Sure I mean I didn't stop until she 'd finished  Yeah exactly   That 's the same for The Fair Maid of Ascot  I just wanted to get the story  so I know  knew the background  but you know what you 're talking about  And like she 's rambling away talking and you 've to get everything down like  Yeah yeah  She 's really quick alright but she 's like  okay like she goes in and she explains what she 's talking about like  Which I actually prefer it to  1 syll   several words  laughs   I think she 's okay  Uhm no I 'm I 'm finding it difficult to actually understand where she 's coming from and what she 's doing  uhm and how she 's going to examine it at the end  Uhm okay at the  1 syll  exercise after Christmas  You get a passage  a small excerpt from Julian and a small excerpt from Margery okay  Uhm it 's actually printed  There are phrases and sentences that are  that are underlined  Then uhm  okay there are three questions on each  on each passage  Answer them all  Oh  Yeah  Jesus  It 's six questions  unpleasant  okay so some of the questions are uhm  replace uh the word underlined with a modern equivalent  Oh   Oh God   several sylls  just simple stuff like that  Some of them are not so simple  But I mean I mean  six questions  maximum three pages  maximum two and a half pages  How much  can you write in that time  But it   Is it like Middle English language  well it 'll it 'll have to be  Because I mean you 're going you 'll have the book in front of you  Well okay you 're going to have to have the book in front of you  or have to have a text in front of you
