<S1A-038 Going out>  uh yes Angie was on email just saying could they come  and  could I make it late because Garret was working late or something like that  And I was just like well you know I would 've invited them cos I know  they 're  all they 're coming to Amsterdam and all but I really don't have room for them  I 'm sorry  like  And you feel like a shit  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   I know well  you would  but at the end of the day I mean  Saying no   There 's eight people like  you know   That it 's  far too many people and  too many for   It 's too  many for  my table anyway you know  People 'll understand that  It  wasn't the meal that you planned  I mean if you were going to do a buffet or you know  just snack things  grand   Yeah   Yes then  ten twelve people 's  fine you  know but it 's   Exactly but  sit-down three course meal  yeah  I wouldn't attempt ten people  Yes   Yeah  There 's no way  Yeah  laughter  and I love cooking and I would  you know stand for two days cooking  if I  was cooking a big dinner  But  ten people no  Cos I thought about like inviting my mum and dad and my aunties and uncles and all round for dinner   2 syllables   That 's just madness   couldn't do that  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   As long they all fitted around your table then it 's fine  No the most well I suppose you could probably get eight round my table if you borrowed another two and put the  middle bit in   Yes I wouldn't have  that but  That 's just like  But you wouldn't be able   You wouldn't be able to move in the kitchen  Do  you know what I mean  Yeah   I 'm just trying to think where I 'm going to get two more chairs from  You can take two  from my  house  Got some   Have you any foldaway chairs or  No they 're just the big wooden ones  Then there 's no point then  No I don't want you  carrying it  I just  maybe I 'll  ask upstairs or something like that and see if they 've any  I can borrow  a couple of  chairs or  Are you sure   Aye spare ones   Is that the two guys that were at the  party   Yeah  yeah  But then just as I was leaving uh there was a wee email sign and I clicked on it and it was Angie again going  oh can you can you make it at ten o'clock because  you know I A/ine doesn't finish work til nine  and then I 've to go  uh he 's to go and pick her up and bring her back so that 'll be ten  kind of thing  And I was like well that 's a bit late for and it kind of solved my problem of  of having too many people  laughter  anyway  Och well then   It did actually didn't it  I mean if it 's going to be late for everybody  Are you  sure now   Just Linda and  Aidan when they get home from work they want they practically eat immediately  So if they 're going to  be hanging  around  til   Oh right   Oh  that 'll not be fair on them  But you know what  They could have  we could all have our starters you know  in two different sittings or  you know  and that  cut out hassle and all as well like  Mm   Yeah yeah true  Yeah  And that would sort of keep them going until  the main course   Yeah  yeah  Yeah well that would be fair yeah   Cos I mean you wouldn't  want them two sitting starving  That wouldn't be fair on  him  especially after Linda  made the dessert and everything   I 'm going to do   No   But they 're quite   they 're happy to do that at the moment like  anyway  because uhm  I told Linda on Monday that I was thinking of moving out   she 's   Mm   Oh  how did she take that  She was fine about it you know  She was just going but why  you know and she 's like trying to  you know she was very reasonable and all like  she 's just you know going well obviously I don't want you to move out like  You know  we 're  best friends and you know  I hate to think it was  being there  or  you know  And I was going well obviously Linda it 's changed the whole makeup of the house  It used to be all girls  He 's there all the time  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah I suppose he 's there a lot now is he   Is he  You don't even get speaking to Linda  Oh without Aidan  being around   No no  So  I know Doris got pissed off with Tommy being in the house  Och it just happens  It 's not  that you don't like them  or anything you know  but it just happens  It does  I mean   I know  I know   And uh but even with Doris ' situation I mean like she owned the house  Do you know what I mean  And she sort of felt like he was  intruding  almost cos Tommy would 've come round whenever I wasn't there  or I would 've been going to work and he would 've been still in bed and then going on later  I mean he never did anything wrong   Yeah   Yeah that was the same with Murph  you see  Cos Murph was there for fucking months on end as well  But  he  like he never asked to stay and he never you know  I never asked him to either like  you know  With Linda it was all official and above board but Murph was just like slinking  He was there all the time  He used the house more than us like  laughter  He 's getting out of bed when I came home from work looking for his breakfast  laughter   Yeah   Yeah   Jesus  No well at least if Tommy was staying there all day dinner would 've been ready like for everybody coming home  I mean he always did his own share and like cleaned  and everything  But still  whenever  you 're sort of agreeing to  move  in with somebody you sort of just agree to move in with them  You expect   Yeah   Yeah   But I was just  explaining it like you know look I just need a big change  I just want a lot of things in my life to change  at the  moment  And I want to be down near the city centre  where I can walk out my front door go visiting  you know  not be paying a tenner return in a taxi  anywhere any night  You know cos as soon as you go up home  and you 're that far out you don't want to leave  Like you know  that 's you you know  Mm   Yeah   No I know   Although in saying that I mean I only live like   the road  and I still don't go out anywhere  Well I  have to say no  like if I 'm there on a Friday  or a Thursday evening I 'll go late night shopping just to even wander round  the shops  and see people  Do  you know what I mean  Yeah   I know   Yeah   Yeah   never think of doing that like you know  But it I mean  I don't get out because it 's safe as well  Do you know what I mean  Hamill Street 's quite dark  cos  you don't really go out after nine o'clock  I wouldn't go out after nine o'clock on my own  And I wouldn't  dream of walking about   Yeah    Yeah   You got a taxi up here  tonight did you   In the lighter evening I can't wait til the lighter evenings to come in  You know would you believe  I know you 're  Look uh it 's light it 's light  It 's I don't care  laughter  Uhm  you see in the lighter evenings I mean it 'll be great cos I will be able to walk about and stuff  if it 's  I think it 's possibly because I don't really know the area very well either  Mm  You know if I knew it was safe  I know the people that lived there before me said it was safe  Yes  But still  But they were trying to sell their house  you know  But I think it is  Well it is that walkway across that 's that part is not safe  Exactly   Aye College Street North the  big street   Yes  yes  Cos that 's  where the the tech was and all  And I remember like the  uh I went there for  for that mechanics course like and uh  it was  you know everybody was always saying like you know it 's a really dodgy area and  especially when we went round to the wee uh garage  yard bit and all  Uh you know  they were  going don't like you know  don't hang around  Yeah wait  Don't come down early  Like wait til it 's open  actually open like   I know   Oh yes   Yeah   Don't go round there on your own   Yeah   well it 's that 's fair enough cos I mean  there are  so many wee alleys  Do you know what I   There 's  I mean like there 's  the one  before my street  you know the way there 's like a driveway into the  mill  And then there 's the carpark that they could be hiding behind different things and then  there 's  Hamill Street alleyway as well  And plus the other thing is that  uhm   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   It 's  like once it 's light you 'll be fine  Oh God aye  you 'll be  able to see everything  Uhm  I 'm not really looking forward to the homeless shelter being open now  I felt so   1 syll    Yeah   Yeah   It mightn't  affect you too much like cos it is  It is I know it 's on  the main road   Quite a distance  away from you but  that would be dodgy enough now  Like it 's people I don't want people  this sounds awful but I don't want people like lying in my alley  Do you know what I mean   going  to my bin in the morning and  there 's  somebody lying beside  it  That scares me a bit  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   But maybe we 're  sort of  But there is gates and I would assume  that   Under  under-judging them or whatever the word is  Like cos  you know  if their homeless  shelter 's there why would they be lying in your alley like  laughter  They 'd go home like  I know   But  4 sylls    And I keep having these thoughts oh no I 'm going to come home  from work   No but  obviously they 're all they they 're probably majority of them are drunks or  whatever  so they would be hanging around like you know close to  Mm   I know  They 'll find somewhere to hang out which will be probably your walkway or something like that  you know  I hope not  Well that 's where all the wee kids hang out and all  Like wee kids tend to hang out at you know the very top of the street at  College  North  At the  you know at that end  Not at the bottom end where the two pillars are  The other end where the cars 'd be going past  That 's  where  all the youngsters hang out  Junction   Uhm   Yeah
