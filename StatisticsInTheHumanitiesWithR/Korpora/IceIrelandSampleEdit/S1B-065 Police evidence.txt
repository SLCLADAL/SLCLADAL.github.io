<S1B-065 Police evidence>  And what time did you arrive at the scene  Was it soon after the accident happened  It was just shortly before seven pm  And again can you simply describe the scene to His Lordship as to what you found when you were there  Uhm as we drove up Springhill Park from the town centre direction uhm to approaching the junction to our right which would be into the cul-de-sac uhm I observed a large crowd of people gathered around a green Nova car  Uhm when I dismounted my vehicle and was approaching the vehicle uhm I observed a female uhm strike two other females  towards the rear off-side of this this car  Uhm I also noticed that the driver 's door was open and that there was a male person uhm having a dispute with the driver of the vehicle  Uhm fearing for the safety of the driver uhm I went over and advised the people there to stay back and let the police deal with the matter and I escorted the driver of the vehicle into a police vehicle for his own safety  several sylls  identify the two people that were uhm  several sylls   Uhm the  the two ladies were being assaulted by the mother of the defendant and uhm the person I  believed to be the father was the person that was having the the confrontation with the driver of the vehicle  So had you ascertained that it had been an accident that had occurred sometime previously  Yes it was reported to the police as an injury accident and that the offending vehicle had left the scene  Did you speak to the defendant about leaving the scene  Sorry say it again  did you speak to the defendant driver about why he 'd left the scene of the accident  on arrival of the police at the scene  obviously the the driver of the other vehicle had returned and we say  due to the hostile situation at the at the time uhm the police wished to get him offside so  for his own safety and also too  the crowd were quite hostile towards the police initially on arrival  Our uhm main task at hand was to get the sketch and that prepared at the time and to deal with the matter back at the station  And did  sorry did you ascertain from him why he had left the scene of the accident previously  Well he wasn't aware that he had left the scene of the accident  and obviously he 'd left and come back but he wasn't aware that it was reported as a hit-and-run accident  He 'd wasn't aware of that fact  As far as he 's concerned he had spoke to the  the uhm  ascertained the child was okay and as far as he 's concerned there 's no reason why the police would want to speak to him  in relation to this matter  And  3 sylls  any charge in respect of leaving the scene  tha  No there 's no charges made in relation to that  Now did you then speak to the uhm uhm girl that was injured  the young plaintiff and  and and to her mother  Uhm not at the time  Uhm she was receiving medical treatment and it was sometime later on that evening at about twenty past ten that night that I called round to the house again to speak with the parents and to check on the condition of the young girl  And can you recall what was said to you about what happened  the circumstances of the accident  Basically I went uhm into the house identified myself I was the police officer that had been there earlier on uhm informed them of what action the police had taken to date in relation to the accident  namely uhm we had interviewed all the witnesses known to the police at the time and uhm inquired about the condition of the girl and uhm  in fact uhm mentioned to her you know that we had interviewed everyone that we knew that had witnessed the accident or knew anything about the accident  And what was your response  4 sylls   Uhm response  neither the mother nor the father made any indication that they had seen the accident or had been party to anything that happened immediately after the time of the accident  We 've heard the evidence of the mother today where she gives the impression of actually being at the scene of the accident very soon after  She 's given evidence for the position of the defendant 's vehicle on the road et-cetera  Is that the impression that you obtained from her at the time  I certainly got speaking to the both parents in the house that evening uhm  I was of the the belief that uhm the mother was in the house at the time of the accident and was alerted by a neighbour and at no time was any mention made to me of her seeing vehicles on the wrong side of the road or anything else unclear speech from barrister to judge   Uh sorry  did you interview then the daughter in respect of the accident  No she was interviewed by Constable Callan  Did you have a a look at these bicycles that had caused the accident  Yes the bicycle was pointed out to me which was lying in the front garden of the house  Uhm  Were the other bicycles there  I 'm not aware of any other bicycles  I couldn't honestly say whether there was or  several words   I couldn't answer that question  What would you say to His Lordship about the condition of the bicycle that you saw  Uhm the bicycle pointed out to me uhm had substantial damage to the front forks  It was bent back and the front wheel was obviously bent back against the  the frame of the bicycle  Uhm I did check  and I 'm informed by the mother that the brakes weren't working  I did check the brakes on the back wheel which  I found whenever I spun the wheel and checked both  the brake lever  the wheel continued to spin and there was no pads sufficient to slow down the back wheel  Can I just take you back a point  You said that you had been told about the condition of the bike  Who had told you about the condition  Uhm it was the mother of the child who told me when I went to the house  several sylls  then suggested to the mother that she said that you might have told her  No I didn't  No she informed me of the fact of  4 sylls   And what would you also say about the size of the bike  in my view the bike would be for a teenager as opposed to a ten or eleven year old child  Why is that  Because of the size of the frame on the bike  I 'd have presumed it to be used by an older child than the child that was using it  Had you gone down to the scene of the accident where the uhm the accident occurred  down at the junction  down at the junction in the photographs that you 're holding holding there  Yes I was at the scene whenever we initially arrived at the accident  Did you take notice of any tyre tread mark that had been  3 sylls  grass  I I did yes uh-huh  Uhm it was on the grass to the right as you turn into the junction  Uhm yes to the right on on photograph three there just as you turn into the junction  And roughly how far was that on  in to the ground area  Uhm it was on the edge of the grass just where the  the main curve is on the kerb  It would have been in that area there  It just  it 's somewhere round that area of the th' actual kerb where the turn in the kerb is there  From speaking to the parties who gave evidence where did you believe the accident had taken place  that 's where I believe the accident did take place  Did you take a statement from the defendant  No I didn't  I spoke to a witness that was at the scene  Mr McMillan  Thank-you  Constable  the reporting officer was Constable Callan  Is that right  That 's correct My Lord  And he was in charge of investigating the  2 sylls  Is that right  That 's correct My Lord  several words   That 's correct My Lord  you say that uh you were present in the minor 's house after the accident  That was later on  about twenty past ten that evening  That 's uh September ninety-seven  That 's correct My Lord yes  several sylls   several sylls   And uhm do you have a notebook entry there  number seven  Entry number seven  Uhm I don't have everything that was said in my notebook obviously My Lord  as I say I spoke to certain people on that day and ascertained who had seen what in relation to the accident  Do you have the notebook there  I do have   several sylls  the responsibility for the investigation of the facts fell on Constable Callan  That would be correct  He was in charge of investigating the accident  I was just overseeing the investigation My Lord  But it was your  you were involved in relation to the uh  possibility of prosecuting Mrs Hegarty for the assault  Constable Callan was involved in that as well My Lord  Were you present uh during the investigation in relation to the assault  I was yes  That was the following day   I won't read all of it out  but it 's fair to say that you 've dedicated a page and a half to tell setting out the details  the nature of the assault  who was struck on what part of the body  several sylls  Is that correct  That 's correct My Lord  Yes  And then preceding that  you have got a paragraph which says  informed of RTA  of injury RTA  Springhill Park where girl knocked off bicycle  1 syll  offending vehicle alleged to have drove off  eight eight DL o nine six seven  uh Cavalier uh  several sylls  injured party  uh believed a minor  Thomas Sean Maguire  That 's your entry as regards your initial knowledge of the accident  Is that right  That 's correct My Lord  Yes  obviously the report which came into the police station was to that effect  that the child had been knocked off the bicycle and was then taken to the hospital  That was what you had in your mind that you wanted to investigate  Is that right  That 's correct My Lord  Yes  And thereafter then you dedicate some detail to what you saw as regards the assault and uh  several sylls  how you would have identified the assault to the plaintiff  Is that right  That 's correct My Lord  Yes  And thereafter  the  uh injured party  Sean Maguire  one two two Springhill Park who was at home being attended to by ambulance personnel  That 's really all you have in the notebook as regards  3 sylls   Yes that 's correct  I didn't speak to the injured party at the time
