<S2A-057 Recipes 2>  Now we have all our ingredients ready  And I 'm going to show you a marvellous recipe for making homemade soup  And this can be adapted to make all sorts of different soups depending on what you have in your larder  And in fact what it is it 's really a formula  So what I use is one cup of onion  one cup of potato and three cups of any vegetable of your choice and five cups of chicken stock or if you 're really stuck you could use water  But I 've actually chosen to do an onion and fine leek soup  So I will use  one cup of chopped potatoes and  four cups of chopped onions  So what we do is we 'll first and foremost we 'll  melt the butter  So put the butter into the saucepan there  And we 'll get the heat on underneath it  And then  we 'll melt the butter gently  until it actually foams  Now that will take about a minute or so  Now you might say to  yourse  oh yourself well that 's a waste of time  Why can't I just throw in the onions and the potatoes and  put the stock or water in on top of them  Well it 's well well worthwhile  sweating the vegetables first  Because if you don't sweat them you will just have a sort of slightly boiled onion flavour from your soup in the end  So that 's lovely now  You can hear the butter just foaming there  And add in  first your cup of potato  The potato will be the thickener in this soup  And your onions  like that  And then coat them in the butter  Toss them around and coat them in butter  And now I 'm  going to add a little fresh thyme into it as well  If you don't have the thyme leave it out  It 'll be a pure/e of onion soup  And it 'll still be delicious  the vegetables coated there in the butter  And teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves going in  Toss them round  And then don't forget the seasoning  And always season with your fingers rather than throwing it in with a spoon because you 've got much more control if you do it with your fingers  And also the great thing is to get the seasoning in early on so that it 's well absorbed into the soup  You can sort of correct the seasoning at the end but you can never quite make up for the fact that you forgot about it altogether  So now this should be put on a gentle heat  Because the term sweating of vegetables simply means that you cook the vegetables  over a low heat for about say eight or ten minutes until they 're  cooked but not coloured  And then if you actually put a little paper lid or a butter wrapper on top well then that will produce a nice steamy atmosphere in and there and then they 'll sweat better for you  So I have a bit of greaseproof paper here  I 've folded it in half and then into quarters  Then fold it over again  and again  And now you 're making what 's called a paper lid  Into the centre  and then let 's tear off the back part off it there  so that you have a little paper lid which fits down on top like that  Then we put the lid on top  And then make sure that you turn it on to a gentle heat  So that would take five six minutes  while they 're cooking don't try to hurry it up otherwise they will uhm colour on you  That 's not what you want  While they 're cooking I 'll just show you how to chop uhm an onion properly and how and also how to chop a potato  Because you know there 's a right and a wrong way of doing all these things  So the first thing to do is to peel your onion  And make sure you keep the root end intact because that will actually keep the onion together when you 're chopping it  Sharp knife  that 's the other thing  And then cut the onion  like that  to put uh half over there and then put it from you with the root end towards your left hand  And then  like that  not quite the whole way through  And then turn it round and then  slice like that  There we are  Now don't put your fingers out like that  If you do you cut the top off them  Keep them back in  and then  like  there we are  Now chopping a potato is the other thing  Cut a slice off the side of the potato like that  And then  down like that  Now you see you can flip it over  Then cut it down like that  like that  Let 's have a look and see whether these uhm onions are sweated  There we are that 's ready  Put that out there  And now we just add in  chicken stock  That 's nice homemade chicken stock I have there  So bring that up to the boil and cook it until the uh potato will mash off the side of the saucepan  Then you can either serve it like that if you want to if you like a soup with lots of bits in it  Or else you could rub it through a sieve if want to  Or else you could pop it into a liquidiser and pure/e it that way  And I 've already got uhm a soup uh liquidised here  Because I want to just finally taste this soup  So uhm uh what I would add to it if you wanted to make it a tiny little bit richer  I would add just a little tiny drop of cream or some creamy milk  And then of course  most importantly  taste it  Mm hmm that 's very good  I 'm just going to give it another little tiny pinch of salt  That 's super  Now any time I 'm making soup instead of uh just  putting it straight into the bowl I quite like to serve it actually in a soup tureen  Because uh even if uh you 're serving just for a lovely family meal at home if you could put it into a big bowl or soup tureen then somehow or other it makes much more of a sort of occasion of it  And when you 're making homemade soup it 's always worth making at least twice the recipe because you know you can always freeze it anyway  And if you have soup in the house well you 're absolutely never be stuck  Because if you come home weary from shopping or from work all you have to do is heat up a bowl of soup  And it 's cheap and cheerful and absolutely delicious and nutritious  And what more could you ask for musical interlude  The next recipe would be wonderful for a special occasion  It 's called smoked uh salmon timbale with a cucumber and fennel salad  And what we need for this are about six slices of beautifully thin smoked salmon  And what we 're going to do is we 're going to line little ramekins  small ramekins about this size with a little clingfilm first and foremost  Now don't have the little dishes much bigger than this you could use egg cups if you want to  But whatever happens don't make the portions too large cos we 're going to fill this with quite a rich mousse  And then take a thin slice of smoked salmon  line the ramekin with that  just like that  Now I 've already lined another four there  earlier on  the centres of those are going to be filled with this delicious mousse I told you about  And to make the mousse for the centre you need about four ounces of chopped up smoked salmon  It could be from the tail piece or it could be smoked salmon trimmings or you could even use a mixture of smoked trout and smoked salmon  And pop that into a food processor just to uh pure/e it up  And as well as that I would add a little uhm  about an ounce of butter  there we are  And uhm let 's  give that whiz that for a second  there we are  Now the other ingredient that you may not be familiar with here is fresh horseradish  And do you realise that fresh horseradish grows all around the countryside in the ditches wild  And it looks a little bit like dock leaves but the leaves are slightly longer and they 're a darker green  And of course you have to dig it up and it 's the root that you actually eat  So all you have to do is  get the root like that  And then  peel off the  outer skin  Of course give it a good wash and make sure you get the clay off first  And then take a grater  and just grate the horseradish  finely like that  just like that  as much as you want  And I 've already got some grated here so I 'll use this  So about a tablespoon of fresh horseradish if you have it  Now if you haven't got horseradish you can leave it out  But it does give a little zing to this mousse  Tablespoon there we are  And then we 'll also add in  about five fluid ounces of cream  And perhaps  a little uhm tiny  squeeze of lemon juice  But let 's taste it first  Mmm  needs a little drop or two of lemon juice  Do it to taste  Uhm it very seldom needs salt because uh the smoked salmon is usually quite salty  there we are  Final taste make sure it 's okay  that 's delicious  When you 've got the mousse made and when it 's nice and light  just take the little ramekin and fill the centre with the mousse  like that  Not too much in because when it turns out  it wants to be nice and flat on the bottom  That in there  Then fold in  the little pieces of smoked salmon like that  And then clingfilm over the top  And you 'd put those into your fridge  And you could serve them later in the day or they could be made be made a day or two days ahead of time  So I 'll put those into the fridge now  And I 've already got one made here  which I 'll show you how to present in a second  But first and foremost I must make the little cucumber in fennel salad to go round the edge of my plate  Pop that underneath  there we are  Now  so for this salad I 'm going to make uh a little French dressing  This is a classic French dressing which would be one tablespoon  wine vinegar  classic French dressing is one to three usually  So one tablespoon wine vinegar   And about three  tablespoons  sunflower oil  Or it could be a little sunflower oil and olive oil mixed  It 's going to be a light dressing  And uhm  slice your cucumber quite finely  And toss that in there nice thin slices a bit like that  And  toss them round in the dressing  An  apart from that we 'll add  a little salt  a little pepper  and also a little tiny pinch of sugar  like that  And then a little sprinkle of fennel  Now this herb has a mild anis-seedy flavour  And it 's very good with cucumber  And this is what fennel looks like when it 's growing  It 's a  feather  lovely feathery herb  Arrange some of your pieces of cucumber  around the plate like this  This can look very pretty very easily  Lift out the little salmon mousse and pop it into the centre like that  that looks very pretty as it is  But if you like you can garnish it with uhm some little sprigs of parsley or sprigs of chervil  Also you could use if you like  some little herb flowers  So you could use the flowers of the fennel  They would be wonderful  And I have some of those here
