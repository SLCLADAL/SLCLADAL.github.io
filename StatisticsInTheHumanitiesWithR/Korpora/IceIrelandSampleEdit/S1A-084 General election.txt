<S1A-084 General election>  So anyhow  what 's the thing about this  general election thing   I don't know   Look I 'm sorry  about my political ignorance  Do you want a cup cos it 's bigger  No that 's fine  A glass is fine  Why is there a general election  I 'm sorry  I 'm just so stupid when  it comes to things   Well it 's because  was he  is was   all   Screwed  up  laughter   Well yes   Well  yeah  Well I mean that doesn't take a hundred brainy  to figure out   Yeah  is it kind of stemming from the Attorney General isn't  it   And then the   Mm yeah Harry Whelehan   Wha  wha  what  happened the Attorney General  Well Dick didn't want Harry Whelehan  and  Albert did  So while   Oh yes   And then  there 's the thing about the Brendan Smith claims that the Attorney General had  the application   Brendan Smith  the priest guy  he had the application for extradition  Yeah was it for seven months  or something   Seven months  yeah  Yeah  Nothing was done about it  That 's  highly I won't say what that 's  bad now   Yeah  Would you  vote   Excuse me   It 's alright  If we had a general election  would you vote  I 'd have to go home  I  was thinking that today   5 sylls    I would not be bothered  I never vote  My father nearly kills me  I didn't want I said to my mother specifically I never ever was going to vote  But once uh one  when there was some election on some local ah you know these small little things was on uhm  Dad wasn't at home and it was coming up to closing time and we 're always late of course for everything 's kind of  ten to or usually five to whatever the hour  Five past  Five past most of the time yeah  And uhm  Dad wasn't at home so she made she bullied me to come down with her  So I had to vote  I was disgusted  I don't even know how you go about it  No  Sure I hadn't a clue either  I was following her around like a little sheep  laughter   It 's quite easy actually  laughter   It is like but  it 's kind of  But you know it 's a bit unfair if you were illiterate you wouldn't be able to vote  They should have little photographs next to all the names  laughter   They should  It 's a good point  It 's a point  I was thinking like cos like there was fourteen names or something on the  MEP thing  Yeah  And like I mean if you didn't like if you were illiterate how would you manage  That 's  true actually   You 'd have sight  recognition for names  But like  fourteen when  you might have big long lists that are like I mean you wouldn't  Mm   You might not  Yeah sure you probably wouldn't know half them  I don't know half of them and we 're supposed to be literate  But you can read them  Yeah never heard of him  Oh wow   Yeah  they seem to creep  out of   I voted  for all fourteen of mine  They nearly went  stupid waiting outside for me  I said well I 'm here now  I like I arrived in at a minute to the hour  cos I was at work  like I was working nine to nine and we closed at nine  And we got off work early and we drove home  and I was there  and I said I 'm going to vote for everybody and I listed my preferences  laughter   Ah  That was very nice  I was sick  It was very nice yeah  laughter   That was the best trick Caoimhe  It was really sadistic  I was finished at nine   I thought   Talk about  tangent  Can I 've the butter  please   Ah

Diarmuid was out the front door right  But you see maybe he had  I didn't know whether the talking was upstairs or downstairs but the rocking of the bed was definitely downstairs  But anyway  How did you know it was a bed  You know the way if you sat on a bed and went like that  It was that  it was that kind of a sound I 'd say  Well maybe   Maybe it was the sofa  Maybe it was a chair  yeah   it could 've   It could 've been  anything  That doesn't matter  It 's my story  Maybe he was standing on the bed  He was maybe he was trying to come up through the hole to me  laughter   Exactly

in books  like references  And I always thought my God how do you go and find them  So I went down and I screwed all my courage up together and I went down and I asked the Hamilton library desk  they 're all written in a big book all you 've to do is look them up  and they give you the number of the shelf  The shelf in the Berkeley  Do those shelves have numbers   never been there   That 's all there 's to it   Downstairs   Downstairs at the desk like there 're periodicals  A to F and P to Q  and stuff  like that  Wow
