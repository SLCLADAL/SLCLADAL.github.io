See you later babe  Uhm  came home emptied my bag  Don gave me his keys  He stayed over  Uhm  3 sylls  up at his  Went up to the shop and got a couple of pizzas  He 's coming out later on and watch Teachers  Oh wonderful  several sylls   Just you and Don  Just me and Don  Well we 'd usually watch Will and Grace but the series is over  on Living  So it was double bill last week so we had it on nine to ten and then the Teachers and then a video couple of bottles of wine and an oul chat   2 sylls   So I didn't come back here now until it was after six before I got sitting down and having a spliff  And well I was getting up cos Mummy was on the phone so  She was saying about uh Jamie and her being   2 sylls    Oh well  What happened  Jennifer told Mummy and Emma and then they 'd found out independently that the husband 'd another woman  Oh my God  But at the end of the day Sorcha it makes sense   what man  twenty odd years married  you know would why would he need to be on his own  Exactly  Of course  Why would he leave to be on his own   So uhm did they hear any more about who or what or why or  This woman from Lurgan uh   4 sylls    Lurgan  bird  aye   Oh  in the camogie club   4 sylls    Sure Jamie  wouldn't know who that is then  But it wouldn't matter if she did  In Lurgan everybody knows everybody  And is this woman single or has she left her family  Don't know  Don't know what her  4 sylls   Oh poor Jamie  Apparently he 's buying a house in Armagh  Mummy goes well he 's originally from Belfast  His job doesn't tie him to the area  Of course  4 sylls  in the area  You know what I mean  It would 've been better if he had 've just buggered off back to Belfast  Exactly  It 's on  your own doorstep like  But she 's saying she 's apparently she 's Catherine her son who 's twenty-one  came back from Slane really really bad sore throat  Streptococci infection his throat 'd closed up  Took him  to Moy clinic on  Monday  With some girl   Oh dear   Uh-huh  And they gave him nothing  But surely  uh  She says he 's  he 's sweating  It 's just she 's helping him do things  Not even strong enough to bloody change his T-shirt  And he 's sweating  And he 's really really bad and he just can't move like  I think that 's the one then that was  that took it really bad probably  And this has just knocked him for six like  Exactly  sighs  2 sylls  coming uh a long day at Slane and  you you know  run down  and stressed and  that 's  when you get things like that  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah  Yeah so she 's up she was off today then looking after him  He 's in a bad way so  Och poor  Jamie   God  love her like  you know   She must 've  her head wrecked  Yeah  Absolutely wrecked  God love her  And having to come back and say you know in a public job like that as well  you know   Yeah  it 's so she 's just you know like profile job and then people in her staff talking about oh he 's ran away with another woman and  Exactly  And I 'm Mummy 's going oh who would have I think she 's told them all like you know  Yeah  At the end of the day cos you know what they 're like  Sure she 's a  not gossiping but she is to me on the phone  Aye but even if it 's not gossiping people are talking about it  It 's a big deal like  You know what I mean  Over here nobody 'd bat an eyelid like  Yeah  several sylls  tell Don and he 's like what  And I was like  doesn't happen at home  I know  It really doesn't  Generally people 'd  understand like you know  Conor and Estelle especially Estelle  2 sylls  they told me when I was over the last time and  oh  I know   And what 's the story with them  Are they still separated  Yes still separated  And Mummy was going she can't have children  Why Mummy it 's not her fault she can't have children  If he loved her they could adopt  If  he really wanted children of his own they   5 sylls    I know   Sure he 's what  forty odd five  Isn't he  Aye  Fucking hell  If he really wanted children he could 've had them long ago  That 's what I say  So uhm  Uh uh hold on  4 sylls  Think my mobile 's about to go  Ah it 's only John  Alright so how was your day  Not bad  Not bad  That little task was grand  got most of it finished  Ah you see  Sat down and was talking to him  Anyway I don't know  I I was looking to get tomorrow off cos Ciara 's coming home tonight  Oh really  And I forgot to book it off uh I forgot to phone her to see like if she was coming back  But uhm I just uh chanced me arm and uhm  asked him could I go  to be off tomorrow  And he was like  Uhm and he sat for a minute and he goes there 's several reasons and you 'll find out tomorrow  Oh  That sounds like hello what 's happening  Sure  So I don't know  I 've no idea  I 'll tell you tomorrow   no idea   Well why  don't you get Friday off instead  I don't know  No you see we 've our meetings on a Thursday so I think he must be having a  an announcement or something  Shit  So I don't know  It kind of scared me a bit  Well maybe they 've been thought out when you 're getting a pay rise or something or  laughter   I don't think it 's anything as drastic as that  you know  He 's probably he 's going to shift roles you know duties  I think   You never know   Mm   oh then you have to be there  Designate stuff  What what time 's she coming at  She 's coming tonight  Oh tonight  Aye  Bastard  And she 's staying with me  Her and Andrew  Right   had said   You could be  doing with them keys then couldn't you  Don't be worrying  Sure Anthony 's got a set  I

's not getting married any more cos she hasn't heard anything from her  Shit  Mm  Mm  Mm so that 's a bit of scandal  2 sylls  Leah Leah  What do you call her  Excuse me  I can't remember her second name  Mm  She 's already married to an American guy but this is their white wedding  Got you  So it 's not really that major  righty ho mm  And uh are you looking forward to next weekend  God yeah  Is uhm uh we got photographs back from Slane there  I got one there just a week after  Are they good  Uh yeah but I don't remember any of them being taken  laughter   I 've loads  I 've great ones  I 've day ones and night ones  You know tried to get like  Mary and Jim and  and all the couples together  You know  what I mean  You know and uh make sure it was like me and Jules and Leonard or you and me and  you know what I mean you and Anthony and  when youse didn't know they were being taken you  know  Trying to get some good candid shots  Very cool  I 'll get them developed somewhere good this time  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Cool  Those ones in Botanic are  shit for   You need  to go to Jessops  And I know I just cos I was working there doesn't mean I have to plug them  but they  really do have the best machine in Belfast  The big store   3 sylls    So can I get them redeveloped then or  You could  Uhm   Suppose  the negatives would be shite then would they  It 's not so much that the  once the negatives are exposed that 's it  But you can get them to paper develop them  They can tone them up or tone them down  Grand  You know they can do that but it probably cost extra for uhm  Well even at the end of the day half the photographs were shit anyway so  You know what I mean  It 's only the odd one that you might  want to get developed   Yeah yeah that 's  the way that that 's usually the way people use that sort  of system   Grand  I 'm going to have to start using the digital camera a wee bit better  Because like Jules he 's all his stuff on file like and  it 's  far clearer you know  Yeah    Cheaper  Yeah seeing as you have it   He 's very well yeah  Yeah exactly  Must get some pills actually while I  think of them  Did you get that computer sorted thon time  Well Anthony 's still in process  He wanted to stay in his house last night so it 's on hold  Right  Til probably tomorrow I 'll not get looking at it again  Oh just as long as it gets you up and running like you know  Oh it is up and running  Don't you worry  I 'm I 'm working on it  Oh no no as I said I 'm not I 'm not worried like you know  I 'm just  You 're just curious  Just curious yes  indeed indeed   Yeah  it 's great  So I 've got I 've got loads to do  I 'm flat out at work  I 've had a long day  Roasting  Couldn't be fucking assed  And then we

bathroom  You know what I mean  I 'm  obviously I 'll clean the oven  Yeah   That 's it  That 's all you need to do   Fuck the bath  Nobody cleaned it for me  Had to clean it when I moved in  We
