<S2A-044 Education in Irish>  I work in  Institiuid Teangeolai/ochta E/ireann  uhm  in Dublin  And most of my work in the last  twenty years or so  has been uh  a lot of my work has been on Irish in Primary School  I did a series of surveys on  standards of Irish in the nineteen eighties  ninete  late nineteen seventies nineteen eighties  Uhm  uh I did a series of surveys in the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties on Irish in primary school uh and looking at various  variables as well that affected the standard of Irish achieved and so on  uh and in the nineteen nineties I did uh an in-depth study  uh the teaching of Irish  teaching and learning of Irish  in a very small number of  schools which were representative nationally but in which I was able to do much more detailed work because we weren't trying to cover so many schools  and this year we 've done  we 've repeated a survey we did in nineteen eighty-five  uh but on a much bigger scale in the sense that we 've far  we 're collecting a much greater range of data  uhm uh from the pupils themselves about their views on Irish  several words  information  several words  from the parents how they see  the Irish language and how they feel about it being taught in schools and  what kind of supports they give to their children and what kind of  attitude to Irish they they try to develop and so on  And we 've we 've we 've done that survey in in ordinary all-Irish Gaeltacht schools  uh we have a steering committee  Jacqueline is one of the members of of the steering committee in fact  uhm I won't be talking about that survey because we haven't analysed the results yet  but I 'm also  working currently on an evaluation of the modern languages in private project and that report 'll be out shortly  I 'll just give you that to  tell you what my background is  But what I 'm going to be talking about mostly is  the detailed study that we did in in the nineteen nineties uh because  I I 'd like to make a make a point about assessment  I 'm I 'm going to take the word assessment to mean something quite broad  to include  not just assessment of sort of  terminal achievement if you like in the classroom or or classroom assessment by teachers  but to include uh uh you know the evaluation of programmes  language books uh evaluation of uhm  initiatives uh and uh the  interpretation and implementation of the findings  Uh the the general point I want to make is that  I believe the kind of work we did in this particular study I 'm going to be talking about  that the approach we adopted is very valuable  That is  uh we we looked at  the complexity of learning Irish  we didn't just look at the achievement of the pupils  We looked at uh  their own individual opinions  we we uh we studied the class using trained observers  uh what was happening and and so on  We got the views of the parents  I think we 've quite a rich set of data  And as a result of that  we did uh a number of development projects  One of these was to develop a communicative approach to teaching Irish  if you like  a a trial course  for teaching Irish which took account of our findings the kind of things we 'd found in what I call the Twenty Classes Study the in-depth  study  And uh we also went on to develop a content-based approach to teaching  science and art again which we felt was the gap in the programme  And we are currently working on uhm  a programme for for pupils which provides a  direct road and link  for parents so that if the pupil does something in school but has to go home  and do something with the parent and then go back to school  as it were with some information or with some task done  I 'll explain why why we did things  that way  My my general point is that I believe that  collecting rich data  going to the trouble of getting a range of instruments  building up the instruments  collecting rich data  and linking research  and development  is a very productive way to proceed  And I suppose  my general argument would be that  I think that 's what that 's what should happen at a national level in the sense that  beyond our particular research work  research and development work  we we should  be looking way beyond the school all the all the time but trying to bring the world outside into the school if you like  and look at development projects which  which will link  the world outside the school and will in some sense try to find solutions to problems  that children encounter in in in making sense of Irish in in valuing it in uhm  if you like  in in seeing it as being an important thing to learn and so on  So I I 'm talking about ordinary schools by and large even though we 've looked at Gaeltacht schools and all-Irish schools as well  the work I 'm going to talk about here is  work which looked at at ordinary schools for the most part  just looking at our our theme in general uhm  uh politics and  uh uh and language  Th  there 're obviously loads of connections like  in the case of the kind of work I 'm talking about uhm  at the first level we 're looking  I 'm talking about  a rich view of the classroom in the sense of a view which takes account of what 's happening outside  and the difficulties for pupils of seeing the relevance of Irish  so if in that sense  politics with a small P sort of like  the position of the language  the fact that Irish is a minority language  uh whether parents are supportive of Irish  If they are supportive of Irish the extent of which  if you like  communicate that to the child in terms of  how enthusiastic they are about the child 's success and achievements and so on  So politics  2 sylls  if you like  impinges on  the work of the school particularly in the case of Irish but I think in the cases of of lots of subjects but particularly in Irish  Then there there 's secondly  there 's if you like  and of course assessment is terribly important there in  capturing the full complexity of the picture  not simplifying it  not looking at just methods within the class and so on  not looking at teaching methods  and teaching approaches but the whole complexity of of learning and the challenge it poses for the child  the other side of politics is I suppose  sch  all primary school subjects all school subjects have a political dimension in the sense that  how well children do  is of political importance  If children are failing at science for example which is an issue at the moment  in schools in the Republic  uh if children aren't choosing science  you know it has political implications  If science is not taught well it has political implications  If children don't learn to read in their native language successfully  it has implications for poverty and social exclusion and so on  there 's that kind of reciprocal thing  And in case of Irish of course  there is the big political question that we have  a major national aim to promote the wider use of Irish to  try and achieve bilingualism and ultimately achieve  as it were  the full revival of Irish  So that 's there  again as a job for assessment to  communicate what 's happening in the schools  to to the public and the politicians as it were  And thirdly  the politics intervenes in the sense that  we 're looking at how successful  uh uh are the structures and institutions  how successful are are are are the politicians  the powers that be as it were  in providing supports  structures  appropriate  programmes uh to support the learning of Irish  at all stages  we 've politics in there and we have assessment at the centre or evaluation if you like  communicating  between these different domains  if I could just look quickly  what I think  uh this is the Twenty Classes Study I was telling you about  The the data we 're collecting  this this year will bring  this data up to date but I would suspect that a lot of what I 'm saying here will turn out to be  as it was  wh  when we did the study  the  the Twenty Classes Study is was a research study  a detailed research study  and these were development projects which grew out of it and tried to respond to particular problems identified in it  The Communicative Materials Project  these are communicative materials which are still in use in the schools  widely used in the schools because  we still don't have  as it were  uh courses from the publishers  well we we are now getting them finally  but uh there 's a new revised curriculum  for a communicative approach to teaching Irish  Uh and we were asked to do the sort of prototype lessons if you like to illustrate how it could be done  And we used the information we got from the study to tailor it as best we could to what we felt were the needs of the school  This was a programme where  we established  in a number of these national surveys that that  classes which had been taught parts of some subjects through Irish like like  music or uhm  PE for example  would be taught actually through Irish or partly through Irish had a much higher standard of achievement in Irish  So if you like  it 's a it 's one form of content-based teaching that that kind of teaching as far as  And these were ordinary schools  And these schools were almost halfway between what the regular ordinary school would be  what an all-Irish school would be  And we thought that  there there was the anomaly that even though we had these results and we 'd broadcast them quite a few times  there were no proper  materials which would make it easy for  uh a teacher to teach through Irish  we knew that  science was going to be a new primary school  subject  And we we we shortly before it came in we developed  a special course in Irish which would be tailored to uhm  ordinary teachers in ordinary schools  who hadn't previously taught through Irish  We wanted to make the point that it was possible to train  ordinary teachers to teach through Irish  So we did a project which was very successful  we we we simply contacted teachers we we knew about  who who would be prepared to do it  Not all of them were necessarily hugely enthusiastic  Some of them were  others were not particularly  they were prepared to give it a try  And we developed courses in teaching science and art through Irish for third and fourth  1 syll  And that was tremendously successful in the sense that  we showed it could be done  that the teachers were very enthusiastic about it  They did have some reservations about  certain aspects of it  But what we did is  we if you like  we did a little bit of the work for them  we made it easy  We we designed the lessons  We gave all the vocabulary items needed  at the beginning of the lesson  We gave  the phrases they would need  We laid out very clearly what materials they would need and so on  Now the teacher had great flexibility to use that in any way they wanted but  we had done a certain amount of  the kind of dog work if you like  for them  And we subsequently published these uh uh  these books and they 're they 're they 're selling reasonably well
