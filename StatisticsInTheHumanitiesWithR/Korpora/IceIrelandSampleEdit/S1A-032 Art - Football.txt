something   several sylls    Ah well okay I 'm impressed but  see the  the amount of the amount of money they they you kept putting a price on it  Like that 's irrelevant like  But for for looking at it it 's a piece of history too like as well  as a piece of art  You know what I mean   Yeah did youse  any of youse see Superman last weekend no  laughter  What about  Superman   Really  crap  Really crap  Was it  Your man Lex Luther had  all the  the missing  art treasures  Oh aye aye  Full-length Mona Lisa and the arms of Venus de Milo and  He had them all  for his own personal viewing  laughter  Nobody else knew about them like   Crafty   Then again  it 's about a man playing alone and  laughter  an alien playing  You know  it 's a bit dodgy in itself like  Aye  totally

're doing close-ups of him  Aye the body double   Aye   Cost them loads more too like if he was going to do it  You know uh it 'd cost the company more loads more  If he had 've got in for longer  Twenty minutes is  probably   He 's  better than most  To be paying a shite actor like that  laughter   I 'm not going to have a  I 'm not talking about Robert de Niro to you cos you 're just  you
