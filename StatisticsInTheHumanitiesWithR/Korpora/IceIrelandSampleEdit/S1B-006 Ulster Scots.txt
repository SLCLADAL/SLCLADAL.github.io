<S1B-006 Ulster Scots>  Or did you have any quibbles with the way the way that they were said or the way they 'd be pronounced  I just I just didn't actually understand some of it and I didn't actually realise what they were using the word for  Some of the words I 'd never heard of   Were there any words in particular that leapt out at you that you thought  Oh  Not in that chapter because I didn't do it  But in the next chapter  the nouns chapter I did that and about half a dozen of the words which you 'd use a lot like man and son and it was used in the same context as they use them as the in the examples  Mhm  Next page like  drop mouthful plenty  And then the top of page twenty-three the  none of that made sense to me at all  I 'd never heard of half of that stuff  There 's a  lot of stuff that sort of sounds quite familiar but that 's about it  Did anybody else do the chapter on nouns  Well I kind of did but I mean it didn't sound familiar to our kind of names so  I don't think it 's going to be a really useful  uh uhm well I don't think it 's going to be of any use  Uhm you recognise names or different things compared to English but the rest is just Chinese to me   Did everybody notice a dictionary at the back  laughter  It took me a while to work that out  So so far the words are near enough what we would use here apart from  Some of them some of them  Some of them you just recognise them because you might be familiar with the Scottish dialect as well  But there is definitely words there that we would use yeah  in everyday speech  But do you think there have been some of them that have been in the uhm you know have been in the vocabulary but they 've dropped out  You know what I mean more rural  Oh I know what I know what you mean but I  I couldn't I couldn't answer the question  Haven't a clue  Maybe  several sylls   Well for example see the expressions in the nouns  would you use any of them  Or are they are they just  Where are you  What page are you  Uh page twenty-four  There that  it 's that starts after certain nouns and then gives examples  I would use the ones at the bottom there  saying at the at the stair foot and stuff like that there definitely used them before yeah  not very often  And the last one there 's a place under that called Waterfoot  I don't know if that 's anything to do with it or not  laughter   And what about the plurals  Would anybody use any of them  Are they just totally  Och no no  Some of them you would  Like you would use  if you 're describing a number of miles in the plural you would sometimes just say it in the singular  Say something 's thirty mile away instead of saying it 's thirty miles away in Donegal  And it 's the same with years  You know sometimes you would express a a number of years and just say year at the end of it   We 'll move on to the next chapter  Uhm pronouns  Did anybody do pronouns  No  What about the demonstrative pronouns  Does everybody use them  I think they 're near enough pretty universal in Northern Ireland anyway  It 's just it 's just a different pronunciation with the same words that we would use  Aye some of the spellings are a bit confusing  It took me a while to work out what they were trying to trying to get at  I 'm looking at the reflexive pronouns  They 're really  3 sylls  too  Aye we would use ourselves and yourselves and stuff like that there   And indefinite pronouns  I know some of them are definitely used in County Antrim  Like we  we uh you know uhm down kind of Down direction but uhm like there 's fellas I know and they talk about a a body  as in a person but we wouldn't we wouldn't say that  I 've heard it I 've heard it  I wouldn't ever use it myself  Or none of my immediate relations or friends would use that but  several sylls   Mhm  That 's probably a bit of a more old-fashioned thing actually  Aye it 's maybe just more rural areas  3 sylls   Did anybody do the adjectives chapter  I think quite a few of these I wouldn't use myself  Don't know about anybody else but uhm it was it nearly took me to the bottom of page thirty-seven before I found something I would say myself  If you 'd maybe give examples those of you who agree or you know uhm findings that you would say  maybe give examples of this for the benefit of the international students who I 'm sure  I 'm sure it 's not very familiar to them  maybe that example Jessie at the bottom of page thirty-seven you were talking about  Well it 's uhm  It 's an ill burd that fyles its ain nest  I 'll  we 'd use that sort of general  generally  Meaning bad  Mhm  What about the numerals on page forty-four  Does anybody use them  Cos I know we would use a few of them but we wouldn't  necessarily use all of them  Like we would say  nocht  instead of  nought  Or yin or twa  And then the rest of them 's near enough the same  But then you get to a hunder and a thousan you 'd take the  Don't really get the  see like the nocht and the yin and the twa  we don't we don't really use them  Like there 's places right about Antrim they would use that like Rathlin Island and stuff like that but I would never use them  No we wouldn't necessarily use them all the time but it 's just  you know  I don't know say there was Kit-Kats in the fridge or something and there was a packet of them and you went there and somebody said how many 's and you 'd say oh just just the yin left  Would you  would youse use  aye  instead of  always   Or does everybody use the standard English form  Will we go on to the next chapter  Did anybody do verbal forms  By do do you mean read or do you mean  Uh no read over it or  look at or   That 's what I 'm a  that 's what I asked you to do just to look at   I thought they were pretty straightforward to tell you the truth  They were  there was nothing new  It was all quite basic yeah  Yeah  Will we move on then laughter   Adverbs I thought were pretty  What page is that on  Sorry uh  Seventy-three  I thought they were pretty straightforward as well  Bar a few of them like  Did you read the whole book  I just just happened to  2 sylls  I 'm reading it as I go along and then I did adverbs and  whatever the next one is  Conjunctions  I did those  I did conjunctions as well cos it was the shortest chapter  laughs  Well I thought I deserved doing a shorter chapter for adverbs was pretty long  What 's the craic with adverbs then  What 's going on in there  Mm  What 's going on with the adverbs  Och the adverbs they 're straightforward enough  Like we would use them every day  There 's only a wheen that we wouldn't use  Only a wheen  Mm  Only a wheen  laughs  Give over  There was some of them I didn't get at all  What ones  See in seventy-seven  Uh-huh  That wund is byordnar snell  I didn't get it at all  I think I looked looked it up in the dictionary like but I wouldn't use it  Has it got something to do with smell or something  Aye it 's supposed to be unusual  uh seventy-seven  The rest of it was  pretty straightforward I thought  What about the idiomatic expressions on eighty-one  Anybody recognise them or use them or think they were strange or  The only one I think I didn't get was  like the bars o Ayr  We wouldn't use that  That 's a Scoticism because Ayr 's in Scotland  but we 'd probably use something different  And one I couldn't get  I know what it means and I know the context you use it but I couldn't think of anything to translate it was  aince eirant  I know what  I know when to use it but I couldn't tell you how to translate it and it 's not in the back  Where is it  Uh it is eighty-two  See uh where it says region   A 'm no guan doun the toun aince eirant for ti buy saut   1 syll  I didn't get  I know it but I don't know how you translate it  In fact I don't think you ever need it really in spoken English  It 's just like a wee extra insertion I suppose  that you don't really need  every  everybody else sort of find that  familiar enough or not familiar at all   A lot of them I 've heard before but I never use them  I only recognise a couple of them  like  several words  or  when aw said an duin    Would anybody use if you were saying  like it 's  you know if two people fell out over something  would you say  ower the heid of it  no  What is it  Ower the heid of it  Like they fell out ower the ower the heid of  But I 'd say  over the head of  not whatever that is  laughter and unclear speech   That 's the same that 's the same difference only they take one letter out and put another one in  But why  no I wouldn't say  ower the heid  I would say  over the head of   Aye   Mm   There that 's  Pronouncing difference   Will we move on to conjunctions  Would anybody happen to have a hanky  My nose is running  I 'll just sniff  conjunctions I thought they were straightforward enough too  Anybody any problem with them  A lot of them are just you know the same word pronounced slightly differently  Yeah  2 sylls  exactly the same  Do you use  as  for  than   Mm  As  for  than   No  No  Beis  compared with  No  Wouldn't use that either  And I wouldn't use  binna  either  Or  or  for  before  And we wouldn't use  frae  we 'd use  fae  We 'd take the take the R out  for  from   Kis  for  because   Well I suppose if you think about it it 's  you know the way you say  cos   Aye  It 's the same sort of difference only it 's said a different way  I think this is pretty much  What 's the different between T H O and T H O U G H  Cos they 're both said exactly the same way  That 's what I thought  It 's just kind of the same thing  I suppose they have to spell it differently there  Some of their spelling 's exactly the same which is stupid  laughter  But but for 's for  several sylls   What about  while   Where are you  While  Well you say I suppose people here  uh would say while where we might say wile instead of wile  while even  laughter  Somebody help me out here  I can't say the two of them differently so  Say while  I think we 'll move on to prepositions  Aye  Would any  uh before we go on to them  see eighty-six  Uhm  several sylls  uhm we 'd that one the other day you know that uhm  what do you call it  that questionnaire thing we did  You know the way it said uhm  Are you going out and it raining  Would youse use that  Yeah   Yeah   I was just wondering  Cos I just saw that  mother you 're sure surely never going to play tennis and you pregnant  That 's the same sort of idea  I was just wondering you know if anybody would use it  What about the prepositions  which I personally haven't looked at it like
