the classical category goes to the group Anuna  Although best known for their appearance in Riverdance Anuna have already released two albums of their haunting and memorable music  Founded by Michael McGlynn this young group 's repertoire spans twelve centuries of Ireland 's history  from the chants of Irish monks to music by contemporary Irish composers   The second nomination in the classical category goes to Louise Walsh  a young soprano and a Trinity College science graduate from Churchtown Dublin  Studied at the College of Music Dublin and the Royal College of Music Manchester and in July of this year Louise won second prize at the important Belvedere competition for singers in Vienna  at the same time picking up the international media prize and the Frankfurt German prize   The third nominee in the classical category is a young violinist Mairead McCrann  Studied with Brian McNamara at the College of Music Dublin and took a music degree in Trinity College  She was quickly noticed as a player with promise and received an Austrian government scholarship  was awarded the RTE/ Musician of the Future and the IBM instrumental award  Last year Mairead was appointed concert master of the prestigious Austrian Radio Symphony Orchestra   In its long history the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland has been the bedrock of Irish musical life with its public concerts all over the country  its radio and television broadcasts and its recordings  Its growing reputation has been complemented by  international tours  appearances with artists like Luciano Pavarotti and the huge success of the RTE/ Bank of Ireland proms  Well there we are  There are the four nominees  Louise Walsh  Mairead McCrann  and the National Symphony Orchestra all nominated in the classical category  To announce the winner  a man who mixes classical contemporary and folk music to tremendous effect  From the University of Limerick Professor Mi/chea/l O/ Suilleabha/in  Well it 's not very often that we associate commercial or media success with with choral music but all of that I think is  about to change  For their unique achievement in creating a new and original sound and style in choral music  a style which has transcended the established boundaries of classical  traditional  and popular music the nineteen ninety-four classical award goes to the chamber choir Anuna  Thank-you very much  This is a very very special night for myself and all the members of Anuna  I 'd like to thank a couple of people  I 'd like to thank all the parents in particular of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people as well too who are associated with Anuna  we 're a very large group  uh who have stood by us over such a long period of time and helped make this night for us extremely special  Brian Masterson as well for his work uh on our last two albums and I 'd also like to just say that the award itself is extremely special to Anuna who have now been in existence for six years and this is the most flattering award that we could get as it recognises where our roots come from  which is classical music  Thank-you very much  Well of course Anuna so distinguished themselves and indeed us in Riverdance in The Point in the Eurovision Song Contest but as Michael says  their roots are in classical and choral music and we 're now going to hear a setting by Michael McGlynn of The Lord 's Prayer from his Mass in the Byzantine style Anuna sing Pater Noster choir sings   That was Michael McGlynn 's Pater Noster and it was performed of course by Anuna  So there is rock  traditional music  the Hall of Fame award and more to come  Join us after the break  Thank-you very much indeed commercial break   And welcome back  National Concert Hall here and we 're at the tenth National Entertainment awards and you 're very welcome back  Now we are moving into our fifth category this evening  It is the rock music category and again we have four nominations   Just turned twenty-eight this month  Sine/ad O'Connor has been to the fore in international and Irish music since her record debut in nineteen eighty-seven  Her recording of Nothing Compares to You topped the charts in seventeen countries in nineteen ninety and since then she 's released a diverse and sometimes controversial body of work   The second nominees in the rock category are The Cranberries  the Limerick group that conquered America while nobody here was looking  Their first single Linger entered the billboard top twenty and their album Everybody Else Is Doing it so Why Can't We was the most successful debut album ever from an Irish band  having sold two and a half million copies worldwide  Their current album  No Need to Argue has already sold over the million and the band has just finished another record-breaking tour of the USA   Also nominated in the rock category are Blink  the young Dublin pop band who were launched only this year  High energy  fine vocals and memorable tunes  well that 's how one London critic 's described Blink musical interlude   Therapy with a question mark formed in nineteen eighty-nine in Larne Andy Michael and Fyffe came together through what they once described as  a common interest in the theories of noise  and mass anxiety  They made their debut album in nineteen ninety-one and since then have defied easy categorisation  leading to their unique and highly successful approach to rock music  Well there they are  the four nominations  Sine/ad O'Connor  The Cranberries  uh Therapy and Blink  To announce the winner  we have movie buff talent scout Two-FM deejay  Mr Dave Fanning  Thank-you very much Michael  Uhm the winner of this award this year is a band who uh last year got the award as well because they deserved it so much  They proved that the success they had in nineteen ninety-three wasn't a flash in the pan because that debut album which gave them two and a half to three million sales as Brendan just pointed out  actually made it to the number one in the British album charts and Irish album charts this year as well  But it 's the second one that 's done it all for them this time round  Second album is called No Need to Argue and uh within a matter of days it made it into the top ten in America and it 's done extremely well all over the world  One point what million so far  I don't know  Anyway they deserve it  The only thing that went wrong this year was  well went right and wrong  the lead singer got married and she broke her leg as well so  get well soon Dolores  The Cranberries are the winners  Uhm I 'd just like to say thanks to everyone that supported us and helped us along the way and uh apologise about the gigs that were cancelled this week and hopefully we 'll be back in the

their concerts and for their albums  The Red Cow  Harvest Storm and Ireland Angel   Cooney and Begley have been described as The Guns and Roses of Irish music because of their forceful and dynamic style  Seamus Begley embodies the unique West Kerry tradition of accordion playing  and Steven Cooney adds the guitar rhythms  drawing on his background in reggae and on the native instruments of his homeland Australia  Michea/l O'Su/illeabha/in has been to the fore in exploring the range the roots and the possibilities of Irish music  Since his first recording for Gael Linn back in nineteen seventy-five  Michea/l has experimented with traditional and classical forms of music  composing and arranging for a wide variety of instruments and orchestras  Along the way he 's invented a uniquely Irish piano style with his recordings from Virgin and recently he formed a new ensemble called Hiberno Jazz  Righty-ho there we had our four nominations  Sharon Shannon  Cooney and Begley  and Michea/l O'Su/illeabha/in there in the traditional musical category  And here to announce the winner would you welcome please the first lady of traditional music  singer broadcaster Dolly McMahon
