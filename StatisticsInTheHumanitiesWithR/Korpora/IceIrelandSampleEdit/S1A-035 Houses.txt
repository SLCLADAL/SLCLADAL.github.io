<S1A-035 Houses>  You know I saw a house yesterday uhm you know down in Stormont  Uh-huh  You know near  the front of Stormont  the  Upper Newtownards Road  You  know where the Stormont Hotel is  Yeah   Mhm   Mhm  Sort of  or do you not  I know where it is  And there 's a couple of streets there  There 's only two that are nice  But there 's some  Two streets or two houses  Two streets  Two streets that are quite nice  all with nice houses in them  And the one that I saw a house in was Castleview Road it 's  called  And there 's another one beside it called uhm Knockburn Park or something like that and it 's my favourite they had nothing for sale  Castleview Road had two houses for sale  It was one  one of them was  uhm well they were both three-bedroomed semis but one of them was new and one of them was old  And the one that I liked best was an old  the older one  and  I looked it up on the internet and it 's a hundred and ten thousand  Uh-huh   Uh-huh   Oh very good  yeah three bedrooms  three bedrooms totally double-glazed  uh oil-fired central heating and uh  what else did it have  That 's all I can remember  actually of it   Did it have  a roof  A new roof  Did it have a new roof  Yeah  it had a roof  Put it like that  I don't think it would have needed a new roof  What do you mean  If the roof isn't good  that 's like a very important part of any house you buy  Is that right  Yeah  I think the the roof is in in sound order  Why are you taking the piss  I 'm not  Well why have you just mentioned the roof suddenly  It 's not that old a house  Cos you said it  there was a new house and there was an old house and you liked the old house  Yeah  Well from that it sounds like it was older than like in the last twenty years  in which case the roof may be dodgy  No I 'd say the roof was fine  I 'd say the roof was more than fine  But I thought  I thought that price was quite good  compared to   That  is good  Well compared to other places in east Belfast and compared to places in south Belfast  Plus because of the fact that  Sit there  But that 's close to you know the Ulster Hospital  Yeah  So you could get it rented out I 'd say fairly easily and it 's got a good bus route there and uhm it 's nice and close to everything  And it 's close to shops too  Right  So I told Davy about it and I think he 's going round to see it  why does Davy  for you  and Davy to buy together  Well   No well I  I wasn't thinking of buying it  I was just looking at it and then I said to Davy about it because I thought it would be ideal for him  and  he said you know that would allow me to buy my plasma screen TV  laughter   Uh-huh   Is that the only reason he wants a house  That and he wants a stereo  system  that you wave at and it will open up  Look at that dog   I wouldn't mind one of those  It 's about four thousand pounds apparently  Uhm Lisa-Marie and I were in you know the Bang   Oluf  What is it  Olufsen   Yeah  What was that like   I don't really know how to pronounce it  And then  because Roy said that the first thing he wants to do when they get back from honeymoon is buy a new TV for  her  And I said what sort of TV would he want  Like one like that in the shop  It was you know one of the  it wasn't exactly flat screen but you know it was about that wide  Yeah   Yeah  Or not flat screen  What do you call it  Is that what you call it   What do you mean  Plasma  Is that  Yeah  Plasma screen it would probably be  Uhm and she said  oh my God he 'd love that  And we looked at the price  It was three thousand and something  Yeah  like three thousand eight hundred  And there was another one at four  four thousand two hundred and something  I know it 's  3 sylls   And I said would you let Roy spend that amount of  or would Roy spend that amount of money on a TV  And she said  something not very pleasant  I don't know what she said actually  She said yeah he would  And then I asked her would she let him  and she said no  There was actually a lovely one that was  I saw in a  a magazine somewhere  Uhm and you can get it in all different colours  Is that the same one  There was one  the one that was four thousand and something as we were leaving the shop the woman was talking to  or the man was talking to somebody about it  and  I heard him say you can get it in black and  silver  well he went on to say something  but  I don't know what it was  Yeah   Red   Yeah   Yeah  Again that would be perfect in my white room with the red thing from Beaufort and  a red TV screen   The red crocodile sofa   And  Lisa-Marie   A red TV screen  Do you not think that 's overdoing it a bit  And  Lisa-Marie saw this thing in uh  we were in Bollock 's  on  Saturday  Bollock 's   Are you sure you weren't in Bullick 's  We were in Bollock 's  on Saturday   Patricia  You were in Bullick 's  And there was this  cos I was like   That 's near  it 's near the butcher 's  I was looking for stuff to get for  just like stupid wee things to get for Maeve  for going  Cos she 's forever making lists  Is she  hol  like especially on holiday but here like she has a to do to buy  to  think of  to  That 's a bit like myself   To think of  What not to think of  I 'm taking the   Right  Uhm so I got a like this wee  like a child 's notepad but it was really cute  I got her this wee pen and then a Harry Potter uhm like eye  you look into it  It 's only about like that size and you look into it and you can read but except I couldn't read anything  And  Oh that was the one I 've seen before isn't it  I don't know  You could read like  about one of the characters or something   It was like a tail or something  and it sort of went down like that  Like except I just sort of glanced into it  And something else I got  Oh yes you know the Astro Belts  Sweets  Yeah  I got her those too  And it all came to about the grand total of about eight pounds  Did it  Very cheap  that was why we were in  But there was this red uhm like  iguana or something uh or  you know  lizard or something but a huge thing  Not huge  about that sort of size  Was it a dragon  And it sat  And  you know it was to sit on a shelf and it was looking up and you know with its paws down looking up  Lisa-Marie was going oh my God  Wouldn't that just be gorgeous  And I was saying yeah  in the white room with the red sofa and that would just be perfect  Was it a proper  ornament or was  it a plaything  And she saw   No it was a proper ornament  They have ornaments  and stuff  How much was it   Forty-five or fifty or something so  What about in a bathroom  Yeah it would be cool in a bathroom actually  I was thinking on a hearth it would be nice  or  you know on a mantelpiece  Yeah   You know like the bathroom window or something  several sylls   But it was quite hideous but   Cool at the same time  Yeah  What do you think of one of those mirror balls in the bathroom  Do you not think that would be  cool   Yeah  Uhm  Cos can you imagine if you had the lights off if you had the mirror ball up and you had tea lights around the bath  Yeah  Did I ever tell you that Paul likes to take baths in the dark with with candles  I think   several sylls  he 's a big girl 's blouse   Doesn't that disturb you though   He 's not a big girl 's blouse  He 's a bit strange  Mm  Uhm and  are he and his bint okay  Uhm yeah they seem to be  several sylls  was it last night  The night before  He loved her  Do you like her  I don't know her sure  Oh right  I met her once but I don't know  whether I 'd like her   I think you 'd like her  Very genuine  Oh no I must have met her twice  Cos I met her that time with you in that  Mhm  But had I met her before that  Don't know  But I 'd say  I don't think you met her much more than two or three times like  Mm  I think my car 's all ready for the MOT  Here Benjamin what about  you know that film we 're going to  Shawshank Redemption   Have you found the tickets   Yeah I got the  I got the tickets  And what time is it  Three o'clock I think  Right  Is that a problem  No  Could it be a problem  I 'm thinking about when I 'm going to get my hair done  for going out  For going out  For that night  No  For what  To get my hair highlighted  Oh I thought you were making an extra special effort  laughter  Are you kidding me  Mm  To go to Victor 's  Well I mean at the very least you 'll be wearing your cocktail dress   several sylls  curly  Uhm because I wanted to get it done but I don't want to get it done the Saturday before Lisa-Marie 's wedding  Mhm  I don't really know why  Becau  well yeah I do know why  Because sometimes when you first get your hair highlighted it looks really streaky  You know when you after you wash it a bit it sort of blends in a bit more  Sure if you put  well how long does it take  A a couple of hours like it could take three hours  Right well  if you make it for eleven  or so and then I could pick you up from  wherever you are   No I know I 'll pick it in the morning   I know that  but I didn't know what time  I 'm just saying  I was going to get it done this Saturday but then I still have  1 syll   Mm  several sylls   I haven't worked out my outfit at all for that particular date  I 'm a bit concerned about it  Why  I 'm just frightened I won't get an outfit that I like for it  What 's wrong with the suit  several sylls   I 'm just saying  Are you not wearing exactly what you were wearing yesterday  What was I wearing yesterday  Your navy suit and your navy necktie with a white shirt  How do you know that  Cos you 're so predictable  Oh am I  Yip  And what would be wrong with that if I did  Nothing that 's what I 'm saying though but you 've already worked it out then  No I haven't really  She doesn't look very good there does she  A sort of wee surprise  Sure she doesn't  Uhm no  Are you being serious  I don't know  She looks like Tank Girl there   Grainne Grainne  See that was the one I thought you 'd like  Oh right  Grainne got a new phone  She 's going uhm with Orange  Mhm  I said why and she said  it 's forty-five pounds or something for the first month  Mhm  And then fifteen pounds per month after that and I said and what do you get  And she goes what do you mean what do you get  I said do you get like free minutes or free messages  Yeah you get something but I don't know
