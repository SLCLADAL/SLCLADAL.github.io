<S1B-064 Adoption>  The difficulty for children is that at other times they are aware that other foster children are also going to see their parents and that reminds them of their own parental contact and then it will remind them of the fact that they haven't seen their parents and obviously that can be very difficult for them  You hear what Doctor  2 sylls  was saying that if you have it in the setting with the grandparents  uh where there 's an extended family there you have one set of grandparents you maybe have a couple of other grandchildren  if the mother and father don't turn up well then they can be handled within that situation  But if the child is seeing the grandparents and the other children  perhaps it 's not quite so damaging if they don't turn   particularly if it only happened once or twice a year  But equally so he said  one would have to have a situation where they were playing the game  that that the parents did turn up  that they behaved appropriately and that there was some consistency in them turning up  But he said if all things went well  he could see some benefits in having that kind of set-up  Now what 's your view about that  Mhm   To come back to the point I made previously I think there are issues that we really need to assess before we can say definitively  that would be a positive contact for Neil and that really is about Judith uhm accepting  if it happens that Neil has been adopted  accepting his adoptive place and supporting him in that  and being sure that there is no friction between her and her mother  4 sylls  during contact sessions and that the relationships with them  between them themselves are harmonious enough to make sure that contact is good contact  I had understood that the Trust was recommending that there should not be contact  uh post-freeing it should be reduced down and post-adoption there should be no contact  Is that what you 're saying that that 's not the case  that your that your view is that really it should be looked at  Well the Trust is obviously reviewing its position in terms of we did not have that information uhm from Doctor Martin prior to us completing our report  His advice at that stage was that there should be no uhm direct post-adoption contact  In view of what he has said  yes we 're saying we 're willing to revise that and look and see if that sort of contact could be in Neil 's best interest  But the concerns would be one that  she might undermine the placement  I mean there  might be friction with her grandmother or with her mother  Yes My Lord because   There may be ongoing friction between Mrs Brown and Judith  And there is the problem that she doesn't turn up and the child again becomes upset  Yeah I mean that 's the other difficulty that there 's a long pattern of inconsistency and obviously for any child there 's a considerable disappointment when they have the  expectation  particularly seeing a mother and father who are particularly important to them and those people do not appear  Yes   Mrs Rooney the pattern of inconsistency you will maybe accept that it wasn't in any way like Mr Rooney 's inconsistency  That 's a comparison but overall  uhm it 's not been a consistent pattern from Judith  But she has seen Neil consistently from uh the summer of two thousand right through until Mr Rooney came back on the scene at the beginning of summer two thousand and one  I 'm sure there have been prolonged periods of time when Judith has not had contact  And there have been prolonged periods of time when she has had contact  several sylls   That 's correct but there have been prolonged periods of time also when there 's been no contact  Is the quality of the contact very good between Mrs Rooney and her son  Yes I 've seen Judith and Neil together and there certainly is uhm a lot of warmth expressed uhm between mother and son  There certainly is what  A lot of warmth  They were very comfortable with each other  uhm there 's a lot of physical contact  they 're obviously uhm very fond of one another  And I mean is that all the more cause that there 'll be a problem when she doesn't turn up  The child has got a bond with her and then   several sylls   expectation and then she doesn't show  Yes My Lord I think   I think it adds to the child 's disappointment if contact is positive and very positive that uhm when the parent does not turn up and the child 's expectation has been raised for something that they regard as a positive experience and that does not happen  yes I think it does make it a much more damaging experience  But Mrs Rooney had  3 sylls  to the Trust plan to contact the social worker for a contact visit  That had been that  although contact had stopped in the summer of last year it was re-established eventually and Mrs Rooney had turned up for visits  Yes visits only stopped because we had set a clear expectation that Judith had to evidence she was willing to attend appointments consistently and with ourselves before we opened Neil up to any further hurt and disappointment  And it was some considerable time before Judith evidenced that to us and that caused the delay in restarting contact  Well it caused part of the delay in restarting contact because records would indicate that Mrs Rooney was seeking contact with him in early October and that  several sylls  Neil was not available over the Halloween period  So all of the delay in re-establishing contact cannot be laid at Mrs Rooney 's door  I think my understanding my recall is of one cancelled visit by the social worker but I 'm aware that Mrs Rooney was given numerous appointments uhm with the social workers and she didn't attend  I 'm not saying that there weren't delays in terms of sometimes things come up for the Trust uhm and obviously if Neil was on holiday that would have delayed that further  Yes but the fact of the matter is that all of the delay in re-establishing contact was not all Mrs Rooney 's fault  Mrs Rooney could have attended uhm appointments with the social worker quite early in that process on a consistent basis and contact as a result would have resumed at a much earlier stage than that which it did  Is it the Trust 's view  several sylls  but is it the Trust 's view that it would be dangerous to increase contact in case of  6 sylls   Sorry could you repeat that question for me  indistinct   Well the Trust has to look very carefully and to weigh up a balance between developing and the relationship between a mother and child uhm and not setting a child up to be further disappointed  So that is why we had a series of meetings which resulted in contact being increased uhm gradually over a period of time  And as soon as the Trust decided that uh they were going ahead with the Freeing application isn't it the case that the Trust would then revert to that decision  that they don't want to increase the contact because it could lead to expectation  4 sylls   Yes that is the case because the plan is no longer for rehabilitation uhm so yes that is entirely true   Can I ask you a question at all Miss McPeake about adoption for Neil  Do you think uh Neil can wait for further assessments to be carried out  as has been suggested  uhm I think Neil 's waited quite a long period of time already and as Doctor Martin pointed out  the earlier a child is placed in an adoptive home  the more likely it is that that uh placement will be a long-term and successful one  Uh we appreciate the uh Currans are being assessed at the moment  If their assessment is positive  do you think that they will adopt Neil  I believe at this stage the Currans have had a long period of time to consider their commitment to this process and we would not be putting them through the assessment itself which in itself is quite strenuous and quite a stress and strain with them  We would not do that unless we were very sure they were committed to adopting Neil if they are successful  If they are not successful  are there further  are there other prospective adopters available who might consider Neil  Neil has a number of advantages  he has no disability  uhm he is of at least average intelligence  uhm he is of a young age  he has no significant behavioural or emotional problems at this stage so he will be very easy to place in an adoptive home  So you think he 's likely to be adopted   several sylls   adoption  I think   It is extremely likely we will find an adoptive home  I would like to think  well I 'm pretty sure that we will have a choice of several adoptive homes for Neil and we would choose the most appropriate match   You were asked by my learned friend Mrs Stoneley about uhm the presence of other foster children in the home and she suggested to you that that might help him overcome  were he to be in long-term foster care  any difficulties or stigma over having a different name  6 sylls  Is it also possible in your experience that the existence of other children in foster care can increase the sense of insecurity  that they  2 sylls   That 's very much the case  It can also present increasing risk My Lord because very often children come into care and we 're not aware of their backgrounds uhm and many come into care having been severely abused themselves and they frequently act out with other children including other foster children so that can actually present a significant risk to a child who remains in long-term foster care  Well even if he was with the Currans and they were continuing to foster other children long-term  if he were adopted  would he have the security of knowing that he had been adopted  He would have the security of knowing he would be adopted uhm and the Trust would also take the view that the   the the Currans could not continue to be foster carers unless it is approved for a specific child who they may already have placed long-term with them  We would not accept the position where other children were coming and going in that placement  You were asked about uh familial replacement  and I appreciate that Miss Magill will give evidence in view of the overview of this case  That is correct  Do you know if there was a family uh planning meeting held on Christmas Eve nineteen ninety-nine  involving Miss Magill and Mr Daniel Green  Yes I believe at that meeting uhm both the Assistant Principal social worker and the social worker did look at the various family members who could provide a placement for Neil and those were all considered  who is Mr Green  Mr Daniel Green at that time was the the Assistant Principal social worker uhm responsible for Neil 's care  I would have liked to have thought they were going to be made available but  but there also was an assessment  1 syll  on Mr Francis Brown who 's presumably a brother and his partner Miss Sinead Blaney  Yes I believe several members of the Brown family were also assessed  As well as Paula Roberts  That is correct   So far as contact is concerned  if My Lord was minded to grant the Freeing Order  what would the Trust 's plan be in respect of contact with the natural parents during the period between the granting of the freeing order and the making of the Adoption Application  I think our view would be  I mean I have been advised by various experts that at that stage we should be reducing contact uhm and gradually reducing that to the level that it would be post-adoption if it should be post-adoption at all
