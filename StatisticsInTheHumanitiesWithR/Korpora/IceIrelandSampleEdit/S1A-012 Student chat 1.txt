<S1A-012 Student chat 1>  But oh God the place was packed  I mean we sat downstairs  and I couldn't see upstairs but downstairs there wasn't a seat to be got  Honest  to God  It was thronged  Mhm   Dan Simpson was in Derry last night  at  the railway museum  There 's a festival starting this week in  Derry  And uhm  can't remember what it is  some arts thing  going on  uhm that showed a part of the show  Mhm   Mhm   Aye   Oh did it  Mhm  What bit  Och just a wee  it must be a  Uh there was a a fella and a girl on the stage  2 sylls   know  Mhm   A guy with black hair  Aye  And she 'd blonde hair  Mhm  Aye that was the two lead   just all it showed you know  Mhm   he was very good  the fella who played the lead  The the Danny you know like the John Travolta part  1 syll  I can't even remember his name  and like the uh they were all very good but the best you know the acting wasn't that good but you see the singing and dancing was great  You know all  And there was  a a woman who did  she was the choreographer but she also did this part where they go to a dance you  see  And there 's this girl comes in from another school and wins a dance competition and she was  she did the dancing  herself  God she was brilliant  you know they were doing jiving and all this  She was brilliant  And like even the dancers she had the whole lot of them doing it and it was some size of a cast  I 'd say it  was  easy fifty or sixty people you know  Mhm   Mhm   Mhm   Well were there any in the music society your music society  in it   Margaret Bartlett  was in it and then big Jonathan  Kirwin  He was one of the  the the gang you know the male fellas  But uh it was wild funny he came out at one point dressed for the dance you know they 've this high school dance and he 'd like a red blazer with black trim on it and all  He looked like a waiter  laughter  If you 'd seen him this wee thin red tie you know  But as I say like in between the acting and all you couldn't hear the girls at all you know  But uhm it was wild funny because they had all this like  a scenery of you know a just a brick wall  but every time somebody wanted to go off left of the stage they just walked through the wall  There was this like bit of the wall opened up you know  laughter  Well I thought Gerald was going to die laughing  And then they 'd wheel a car on in through the wall you know  that sort of  You know it was wild funny  And then during one bit uhm  they maybe don't have the lights you know to do it right but probably what they meant to do was black out most of the stage and keep the lights on the front where these girls were talking so that the boys behind could clear the stage  but  you could still see them perfectly  And they were chatting away in the middle of this scene and these boys just walked on lifted a table and walked back off again you  know  But uhm  and what and the band and all was brilliant you know the band  was really good   Oh aye   Mm mhm   Mhm   Yeah   Mm   It 's funny that show that they did in the Riverside that put me completely  off that show forever  It was awful   Och it was dreadful  Sure they were only weans  That was wild  Desperate  But it just shows you the interest that show has  We were saying you know  God if Portrush ever did it I mean they would have no problem getting young people  no problem at all  Because I mean it it shows you the interest when you look at the audiences you know  Aye  But uh and then we came out we went  next door into the Linenhall for a drink  And then we ended up we went over to the Strand Road and went into the Strand Tavern  No we were going to go into  the Carrick  the bar  and we looked beside and the Strand Tavern 's beside it and there was a queue coming out the door so we thought oh we 'll go in there  So it was a disco and all  So  we went in there and stayed to the death of it  So I was in here  I came back in about two o'clock  Oh right   I never heard a sound and I went to bed  after  half twelve  and I heard nothing after that  Mm   Oh we just got in we were walking  it was packed sure that tiny wee place you know the upstairs the disco bit  We were trying to sort of get from the front door over to the dance floor you know  and I felt this tap on the shoulder  Who was it but Jerry Jarvis  you know from  the course the journalism course  And uhm I was saying to him about Charlie sending down the bit of him in the Derry Journal and then seeing  his by-line and all in it  this week so  Oh yes uh-huh uh-huh   Uh-huh uh-huh    working with the Derry Journal  And then   Oh aye he only started in June you see  That was it  He was the boy who was in Cookstown  do you remember   I know  mhm  So uhm I was  chat  chatting to him for a wee while  And then we were up dancing and I looked down and who did I see  I thought God  those two are wild familiar looking  these two fellas standing  Who was it  Desmond and Donagh Byrne  standing  I saw  them two  But it was absolutely packed  And funny we parked uhm do you know when you go down the Strand Road to  what do they call it Rock Mills you know the  house  the students ' residence  the  halls of residence and you go up left  It 's not up the Rock Road  I don't know  what what it is  It 's up right up the side of Andy  Cole 's bar there  And I would always if we 're down there I would always park up near the houses in there  We were coming back down the hill and the police there was about six policemen at the bottom of the hill all out with their guns and all and one of them was sitting noting down all this stuff  I don't know what he was writing whether it was the cars or whatever you know  Oh right mhm   Uh-huh   Uh-huh   The side of the road up there or something   Mhm mhm   Aye  Because I was saying it was funny we came over the bridge last night and  nobody  Not a one  You know the way you could never come over that bridge without being stopped  Not searched you mhm   That 's right  But it was good enough good craic you know and  Like we were sitting any time there was a bit of music we were sitting clapping away and like everybody starts clapping along to the music  you  It was good craic  Mhm   Well you 'll have to let Donagh know how it went now  Oh that 's right  But he said he was talking to Jonathan now so  Oh right  what else  And there 's a  Derry 's wine and cheese party 's on next Saturday  So  Jane has tickets to sell but I says I don't know how I got out of that for I got sent raffle tickets but they didn't send me  tickets for the  so I have to buy  because they 've to be in for that  Saturday  so we 're all going to go to that next  Saturday   Oh   Why is she doing it  4 sylls    Uh-huh   Mm where  is that  The White  Horse   The  White Horse  But uhm Jane and Geoffrey and them were up  well Geoffrey was up a couple of years ago when he did a Derry show  and they were saying like it 's really nice  They have like it 's not just wine and cheese they have wine but they have you know  a buffet and then  they 've a band and all  They have they take over like a suite just for themselves so  I didn't think it would be all that  I thought it was just standing about  like  with a glass of wine in your hand making chit-chat you know  So we 'll definitely have to sort out  even if you buy a book and I buy a book  that  would do rightly  Uh-huh   Uh-huh   Mm   And uh it would probably be more of your music society now would go to that  maybe sure Jerry  several sylls    I would think  aye I don't know now if they 'd go or not  Mm  But as I say that 's a a car full we have now  anyway so  and Tyrone 's going to drive next week so  Uh-huh   Very good  I think that 's  that sorted out  there 's some crowd in Derry you know on a night out like that  You  know you think a lot of people come into Portrush  til you see that place just   I mean that 's before even places empty  you  know say about two o'clock or whatever time everybody comes out or half one  It 's some crowd of people  Uh-huh   Aye uh-huh   Well there 's probably as many coming if you were around here when they 're all spilling out too  about half one  and two  o'clock you know   I suppose aye   Maybe it 's  just they all wander about that much  it doesn't  seem like it you know  It was that funny we just saw this queue and went up and said wonder what 's on here you know  We says to these boys at the end of the queue look what 's everybody  They says oh there 's a disco  And we were saying well it must be good for nobody 's queuing in anywhere else you  know  laughter  So we just decided to go in there  And the fella that was playing in the Teen Angel you know he 's sort of like the  the the Frankie Valli type of character you know  He is a boy called John Doherty  DAW HER TEE  or Doherty  DOUGH HER TEE  uhm from Highland Radio  and you see him on the ad  for the Richmond Centre  Aye   Mhm   Oh yes mhm   He was in the Derry Journal  Mhm   Aye  You know the ad for the Richmond  Centre  that 's is usually on at Christmas  He 's in it  So he he just took like one song to sing  And if you 'd seen the boy was doing what Donagh would 've been doing  laughter   Yes   Was it awful  Well he didn't sing that much so I began to think maybe that they took some songs off him because he Donagh had was supposed to be doing five so I began to think maybe your man wasn't very good cos it  he didn't do five songs  One  was from the like like the high school kids came in and did it  But if you 'd seen him  he was about five foot and a wee round weeble man you know  and this short black hair and these shades on him you know  If you 'd seen him  laughter  Such a difference  laughter   Of course  I know  You couldn't imagine it  Honest to God  But as I say he was  only he only came in for the high school dance  He was meant to be like the star who came and sang a few songs  you know  But as I say he didn't sing very much  Donagh 's very good   Complete opposite   Oh aye uh-huh uh-huh   Well maybe  they were left in the lurch  Sure they might 've been  Aye  Couldn't do anything else  But I mean their costumes and all were nice and
