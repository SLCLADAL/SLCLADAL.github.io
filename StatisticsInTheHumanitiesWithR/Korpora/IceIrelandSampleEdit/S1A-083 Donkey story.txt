right  uh sure we heard it before  'Tis only the  the fella that was drawing the blind pension  and the fella that was on unemployment benefit  And the fella drawing the the blind pension  used cycle into town for the the pension  he 'd get off the bike and put the bike inside the ditch then at the outskirts of the town and walk away  And somehow he always found his way to the barrack  He never missed his way  But uh uh as he was going down to the barrack one day he didn't like this fella that was drawing the unemployment  And there was your man and he putting ridge tiles on a roof  Ha ha I have you my man  He said I 'll report you  You are drawing unemployment benefit  I 'll report that I saw you  that you saw me  laughter  cough   And that 's the end of it  Glenda has got her  visa

same place in Killarney   6 sylls    Mm  And she 'll be on a  three-day week  Four-day week isn't it  Four  January   What what is  it now a a a a kind of bed or breakfast or a guest house is it

was Freddie Gavin 's  place there and  and and and  Billy   Freddie Gavin 's is it   laughter   Billy  Mullins  And Carthy 's crowd stuck in it  Was he was  5 sylls   No uh uh Freddie Gavin and Bill Mullins that court case  where they won a court case  It did them no good at all  They got bar of the year last year  for best sales  Oh  Of the year  And when Freddie Gavin went up to collect the prize  you know and  5 sylls  and that   And   in Killarney  And  they had sold  'tis actually the accountant Rosie  laughter  that owns the hotel  Back in Killarney like is it   Lovely  I thought that that they were a  kind of a  front that there was  a a mixture of a group actually   Yeah   Yeah there there  weren't a front actually until last year  Yes they were  They did big repairs  and the accountant  owns eighty percent  They 've  only twenty percent Larry said   And he had them  and he had   5 sylls  laughter   Yeah  Accountants wouldn't be like that Rosie would they  Yeah  laughter   They 're assorted  Are they  laughter    7 sylls   They went on strike anyway  They went on strike  to have the union  recognised by the union  There was two  two uh two weddings   Hm  there was  Glenda came home for the after of a wedding  she came home  3 sylls  we could smell the smell of Deep Heat  Pains in her legs from picketing  laughter   several sylls    they were out two days    8 sylls   And there  was a wedding booked then  A wedding diverted  7 sylls   And there was there some of them then were a kind of inclined to give in   your man  your man   another problem of course    who 's the manager of it then  Is it is it Freddie Gavin  Oh the accountant 's the manager oh Jesus   This accountant  This accountant  Yeah and uh  Ah they 've the money  laughter   And oh they 'd be eating   4 sylls    A pound a week   Oh do they    5 sylls   union in there  So like they get a bit extra now  Like what overtime they did it was  Thanks very much but now they 're paid for  overtime   ah  which is badly needed you know  But they get no recognition for  Sunday or anything you know   we 'd we 'd get  we 'd get time a half now for Sunday and bank holidays and all that  but they don't get a thing  coughs  They get nothing  like that   Right yeah  3 sylls    Mm   'Tis 'tis rough going   Right   I 'd  say nurses are exceptionally well treated though generally speaking in the State by all accounts  Double time and everything   Well   we wouldn't say so   I suppose we are really  laughter   But  by by comparison  with with  with  with most other professionals  Yeah   yerra you would be you would  yeah yeah    6 sylls     only  the only quibble we would have now is that  we 're when you 'd be temporary  you 'd be  on first year 's salary  Oh right right   Oh right   Oh right so you 're actually back on  back on your basic  4 sylls    You 're back just on your basic  And  but last year now it was based on two years for which you had worked two years  We 'll say  two years at random  We 'll say take eighty-six eighty-seven  they 'd think you had worked such a percentage of them  that you 'd start on the fourth  rung of the scale  so I qualified for that  And about twenty pound a week  more  you know  And we got backpay then then but of course we 're getting backpay for a few years and next thing we got none to date since  4 sylls  last January for what you worked you 'll say  We 'll say we only got what one hundred and thirty or forty pound  That 's nothing  laughter  On the social fare well then  Uh last year about November last year they brought out a letter  to say the equal opportunity for men and women and equal pay  and that uh  fill in if I thought I was entitled to something  Sure I didn't know in the hell if I was or wasn't  I filled it in anyway  Didn't we get three hundred and thirty-seven  pounds  And  I got a note then to say that was only half of what I was due  Yeah   Right   Right  I was there was two hundred and something  coming to me  However a week after I got another three hundred and thirty-seven pounds  I bought  a video  and that was it  laughter    4 sylls  was paying big money   The State paid big money there alright  What  The State paid big money on that  That  3 sylls  there a  European case  there  4 sylls   Y    Yeah yeah  and like we wouldn't know except for we got the  notification  There 's no  way I would 've applied for it cos I hadn't a clue  But uhm  so I 'd say I should 've only got two hundred and something the second time  Yeah but  3 sylls    You can't give it back now anyway  laughter   Give them the video instead  The video the video 'd have to be  3 sylls  if they want it  6 sylls  this  equality thing now you know  3 sylls  Michael Noonan  above now watching to make sure anything or mentions it male and female and  everything you know   Yes   Oh yeah  mm  The  several sylls  the women used be packing packing above with us you see  And they used be packing  2 sylls  packing quite often  when the packing was busy  Then it got slack  But the men were in then loading containers  Next thing they put out an argument anyway  10 sylls  laughter   There  was no more about it anyway after that  They wanted equality alright but not not the same work  You see  that 's a different thing altogether  Yeah   I know   Yeah yeah  You you 've a bee in your bonnet anyway about  that   Oh  no because because I think that the whole thing is is is unfair cos the men were doing the heavy work and they were working shifts  and  5 sylls   And why in the hell shouldn't they because they 've the strength  But sure they 're not equal then   if men have strength sure  they shouldn't be equal  But they 're more equal  you see in certain ways   They can't  have it every way like  There is no comparison between like for lifting  now or  You know you know  where you 'd have men in the wards  Really they 're great  Right  sure  7 sylls    Sure I remember  at home  a hundredweight of sugar out of the boot of the car it 'd kill me  And Ken could throw it over his shoulder like  you know   several words    there 's no comparison  And you know it 's wrong really because women 's women 's backs aren't fit for that at all  But sure then 'tis the women who claim to be equal  That 's what I can't understand  They can't have it both   Putting in the same effort   But sure they are   Huh  Putting in the same effort  Different jobs  Yeah but the load of effort is the same  But they put the same amount of work in as a man is  They should be paid in proportion to what they do not in proportion  for equality  with with with the other person  They shouldn't   The fact that you are male and that you have uh more uhm strength in actual fact doesn't make you superior  No no it shouldn't no  So you shouldn't be paid more  They say you shouldn't be paid more for what 's God-given  same as if we 're not  If we were mental handicapped whatever  you don't expect us to work and the whole lot  We should still be paid and should still have the rights  Ah is there  is there uh  Kate Kate   That 's  why the lady 's  several sylls  laughter   Is there a a Mullane one working in the  what do you call uh a kind of a secretary with the nuns down in Rathdrum  No she 's not any more  Deborah  She 's not any more  No  Is she retarded  No  Oh God no I 'd say  She has very thick glasses  She has yeah  Oh is she working any more there  Oh she 's gone about  oh I suppose five or six years  she was with us there like  Yeah  She was secretary  Yeah  And then she went off to  1 syll  Well she was she wasn't paid at all like  She went off to London then  And she was grooming dogs and all the rest  laughter  then she came back and uh she couldn't get another job  And she was doing Fa/s courses and I don't know what she 's doing now  I thought she was still  sure 'twas in our school she was  Yeah  And she 's a pupil of ours Deborah  Yeah  And the aunt you see  Sis  is a Sister of Mercy and that 's why she was there at all like  Her aunt  is one of the nuns inside in Saint Mary 's  By the name of  Mullane is it or is it Nolan  I couldn't tell you  Oh sure  mm  Mm  That was her husband that died  It was Deborah Mullane
