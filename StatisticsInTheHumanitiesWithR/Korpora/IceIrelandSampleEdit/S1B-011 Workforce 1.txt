<S1B-011 Workforce 1>  in conclusion regarding human resource planning  let us consider these   Numero uno   we now have fifty-eight percent of the employed population in services  or service industry  What is a service industry  One example is what I 'm doing today  Education will be a service  so anybody employed in universities  DITs  XYZeds  would be counted to be in  the service industry except  Mr Walsh that  in your case  you 're a public employee so I would probably be categorised as a state employee  Anyhow it 's a technicality  Another service example would be  hotels  of course  Some of you are actually in these  You don't even know the industry you 're in  And that would contrast with people like Walsh 's Bread for example  or Medchem  who make things  so-called industry  That 's quite a high proportion of  people airlines  except when they 're in the public employ  and they 're offering a service  Secondly  the Irish labour market is  characterised by long-term unemployment  Thirdly  give or take  about forty-eight percent unionised  There 's a higher ratio  or a higher proportion of public service employees  are unionised than the private but  if we take the entire workforce we find something in the region of  five hundred thousand people  give or take  are in unions  And out of a workforce of one point three million  given that three hundred thousand are unemployed that translates loosely into a  about a fifty fifty figure  And finally  as us males are all  cough and unclear speech  far more females  have decided to abandon the shackles of previous cultural prisons and have decided to work  at least in the overt workforce  So what might some implications be  Let 's begin with the  the female  for instance  What are the implications of more females in the workforce  If you were a human resource manager sitting at your desk  You 've seen the headline  guru Walsh says more females in workforce  And you say oh my God  what are the implications for  moi   Ronan  Uhm on a very practical aspect I suppose you  would have to hire more part-time staff if your female members become pregnant  And you have to give them your their legal statutory right isn't it three months off isn't it  Fourteen weeks to be  precise  there 's  one practical implication  In other words that someone could look at it and say  well females  some of them get pregnant  therefore I will need to replace them  they will be away for fourteen weeks plus holidays or whatever else therefore I need somebody to replace them in that time  That 's one approach yes  A second  Fourteen weeks aye    What about care facilities  you know   Exactly  what about creche care  or other onsite facilities which  perhaps the female workforce rather than the male workforce  might look for  Don't know what the differences between that might be  but we can explore that off tape  That 's second  Third  7 sylls   Why  Because maybe  10 sylls   And why wouldn't the same flexi-approach apply to men with kids  Speaking as one  laughter  I could do with it  Mm   Tradition  probably  Tradition  that the female is the carer  But the tradition would say that the female stays at home  if she 's got the kid  whereas the male goes to work  Why don't we instead make  have males and females come into work but let 's be more flexible about them  But yes it 's a good point taken from previous examples in literature  And finally the B Com 'd framed analyst says  cos they 've been trained to think analytically and objectively  it mightn't make any difference  Let 's just see  Let 's weigh up all these possibilities  Let 's consider the trends  And let 's take it from there  Because don't forget as  one part of your training suggests which stresses the objective and the analytical and the rational  nothing should surprise you  All females in the workforce  all males  Fifty fifty  Sixty forty  either way  you don't care  You 're a trained manager  You 'll do it no problem  Get out the case analysis  several sylls  suggestions go through it  boom boom  manager 's desk  ten o'clock Wednesday morning  You 're in real trouble if someone asks you for  Wednes  or for Friday morning at ten o'clock cos you 're so used to putting them in on Wednesday at ten o'clock  Anyway  So that 's one set of implications  Number two  2 sylls  might be a set of implications concerning unionisation  Well Mr Walsh apart from the fact that as we 're trained rational managers there mightn't be any  By comparison with our competitor countries ie the United States we 've fifteen percent  or unionised  There may be  given the significant differences  something to take into account  In other words there may be somebody representing the workforce  in the worksite  that you 've to deal with  You as representative of management  they as representative of employees  And if you 've done collective bargaining type situations or if you 've negotiated with one person on behalf of a group then you 're aware of the situation  I saw Ciaran standing up here last week as some kind of class rep  correct or   Situation announcing him  a marketing type thing we 're aware of the class rep type of thing  What if the class rep becomes the shop steward  or whatever or the whatever in future  or is the the equivalent  So however there is some other managerial implications for unionisation  One is collective bargaining  ie that you don't negotiate with every individual in the workforce you  negotiate with one  on their behalf  Second  and fourth  you 'll think of something I presume by May  Long-term unemployment  is something we hear an awful lot about  What are the HR implications  that might arise from having a large number of people  who are long-term unemployed   They may become unemployable  Exactly  There may be a certain set of skills out there that you can't do an awful lot with  and that however you 're put under pressure to do something about in your local area for instance if you 're a large employer  by TDs politicians governments and so on who say let 's go for jobs  Our aim in tourism this year I see  or for nineteen ninety-three ninety-four is thirty five thousand jobs  And then the idea is that the industry fails if it only gets thirty four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine  or something  Rather than starting off with saying  the industry really needs innovative products  say something that Manor House Hotel isn't producing for instance uhm  laughter  a dynamic approach which  if it produces growth in the industry will lead to jobs  maybe thirty five thousand  maybe seventy five thousand  who knows  and so on  And finally the fact that  almost six in ten of the workers  in this  Emerald Isle are in services rather than industry or in the public sector suggests that  because traditionally services are characterised by  rapid turnover  lots of small operations  lots of part-time and contract work  a number of significant HR implications apply  Good so moving right along  Dineen nineteen eighty-seven  has suggested in his wisdom  what we 're seeing is  the rise of atypical unemployment patterns  The fundamental implication of these types of  general things that we 've talked about  such as services  unemploy  services unemployment unionisation and so on  an increase by female participation in the labour force  can be summarised  he says  in one thing  that all of this change is producing  in terms of the labour  a set of atypical employment patterns  mentions four  Firstly there 's been an increase in part-time employment  Secondly  a huge increase in temporary or casual work  Thirdly he can point to a rise in self employment  I think that was more true of the time he was writing  than it is today necessarily  And finally  in terms of being an explosion in government and community schemes  of one which great debate at the moment is whether to pay  double allowances to those on SES schemes on the north side versus the south side of the city  Are you aware of that debate on your local radio station  Yes  Yes they are  laughter  They they told me to say  so let 's look at these  There 's been the criticism  Mr Walsh  that in fact  given macro changes to competitive  situation to the environment  given the single European market  given more macro things outside of the little island we live on  in fact  these are not atypical employment patterns any more  They may have been  even as lately as six years ago when Mr Dineen  excuse me Mr Dineen did his research  However in fact they are today  increasingly a dominant  element  in the working landscape  and therefore a dominant  trend for HR specialists  managers generally and organisations to take account of  In other words that it is now perhaps  certainly among recent graduates  atypical  not to have a temporary  or contract position  In fact what would be  atypical would be to have a permanent job  Pensionable employment and so on  And I 've mentioned before Handy 's  suggestion that there are different forms of time now  Instead of looking at this in terms of the  uh the impact it 's having on the labour force he says let 's have  le  let 's look at it on the impact it 's having on individuals  We all have different times to give to employers  full-time time  temporary-time  gift-time that we give to organisations voluntary societies and so on  and so on  tha  he looks at it in a very different way in his book The Age of Unreason  for those of you who want to look at that  So I think we would agree  that these things are happening  We can all see around  we 've had the example in the Irish university system for instance  that a majority of teaching positions are now filled by contract staff  not by permanent people  That 's just one example  and we can probably think of members of our own families  or other friends who are in these types of situation  The question is  do we agree or not that these are atypical  Is it a cyclical thing that we 're going through  that these are  somewhat dominant now  and once everything gets back together again we go back to the permanent long-term type of situation  Deborah  Uhm we go back to the permanent uhm  6 sylls   Why  Because uhm  15 sylls   Like basketball shoes  fast food and so on  Alright so that 's that 's one interpretation  which I think is somewhat accurate  That there 's a trend out there that we 're copying or somewhat kind of five years behind or three years behind or whatever and  we just latch on  Anybody else with a comment   The companies as well  It 's a lot easier you know they don't have to worry about redundancy packages like that if  5 sylls   Yes  And if your term contract is up like you know  3 sylls   You 're gone  And the company from a cost point of view would be very interested in that obviously  But a company might also from a cost point of view be interested in renting accommodation rather than buying  uh leasing cars  you know they 're  if we take the Atlantic extension  there are a number of things we could do economically that would uh be more efficient  However  as we know the reason we try and lock in assets  fixed or human  is because of  commitment  involvement  We don't get the same type of  rapport with  temporary people as we might get with long-term  At least that 's one argument  But again that 's that 's a second valid point
