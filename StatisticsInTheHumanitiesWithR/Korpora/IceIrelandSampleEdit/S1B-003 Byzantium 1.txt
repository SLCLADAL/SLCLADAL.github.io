<S1B-003 Byzantium 1>  Right because the thing is that there are two ways of trans-literary of getting out of the Greek into English  And one of them it comes out as  speaks Greek  and the other one is  speaks Greek  And it actually means exactly the same thing  And what it actually means is brother-making or perhaps more exactly sibling  Right  And  one of the features of the two traditions that Sean actually identifies is the fact that  Greek  is mentioned in one tradition and not in the other  Or rather  Greek  with  Nicholas Nicholas I think   3 sylls    Yeah  Nicholas  yeah   Nicholas yeah  The fact that there was actually a mention of  3 sylls  went to the church and  the  whole rejoice in the union  Yeah   Does that indicate it that there was  Okay cos who are some of the right what 's actually the story  Who are some of the who are the people that you hopefully have read about  Right so okay we 've got  Michael the Third  Who 's Michael the Third   Emperor   The  Emperor  The Emperor  Can I ask you a quick question  laughter  before you go any further about Michael the Third  When I read uhm  the  1 syll  Tucker what it seemed to say that Michael the Third and Basil were of similar age  Yes  But when I  read the Boswell one  it  seemed to say that  Michael  was younger   He was more  youthful  than Franzo   Mm hm   Not   Yes   right well I mean yes he is  slightly younger  but I mean  but I mean  it 's a it 's it 's less than  sorry it 's less than five years   3 sylls    Cos I thought maybe   Okay  But the other big difference is that  Basil 's big and hunky  whereas  Michael the Third isn't  And so in actual fact he  Basil actually appears older  Okay  Mm   2 sylls   No no no that 's okay  So right one of the people that we 've got is Michael the Third  okay who right one of the traditions in the Byzantine Empire is that they quite often give nicknames to their  emperors  So like you have Constantine the Seventh Porphyrogenitus  Uhm you also have Leo the Sixth The Wise  and you also have Michael the Third who 's known as The Sot  uhm cos apparently he was fond of a jar or two  Okay so well I mean the other thing is that he 's also meant to have been fond of lots of other things  as well yeah   Other things  yeah  laughter   coughs loudly  Meanwhile back at the ranch  So okay we 've got  Basil the First  right well Basil  What do you know about Basil  What does the story say about Basil  Said he came out with a stick and stuff  right one of the things was that he came with a with a stick and a little sort of knapsack or or you know like Dick Whittington with all his worldly goods tied up in a big hanky  Okay  Sort of rags to riches  Yeah   It 's  very much a rags to riches story  I think he slept his way to the top  laughter   Yeah  I think he did too  laughter   He didn't do very well did he  Who else do we who else is involved in the story  Right we 've we 've also heard of Nicholas  Who 's Nicholas  Is that the son of the  he 's the one they found on the church steps  Was that  the monk    4 sylls    Right Nicholas  Nicholas  is the monk who may either be a doorkeeper or an abbot  depending on which story you you know which story you follow  But in the monastery  on the outskirts of Constantinople but within the walls who discovers uhm Basil sleeping on the in the in the porch   Who else is there  Monk yeah    6 sylls  something Basil as well but different   Is that the new  Basil   Yeah is that the  Yes I think  3 sylls    That 's in Lycos  Uh it 's in my head  laughter   He 's the young model isn't he  Sorry  He 's the younger model  Yeah  6 sylls    Younger model   but he 's he 's the one  that Basil is frightened is  Michael the Third is going to replace him  That 's why he was  like   The one  he paraded around in uh   2 sylls   But there 's John  Wasn't there a John  And uhm   Yeah   Yes there 's   John  And who 's John  Yeah   His mother  wanted to form  the spiritual  brotherhood  between  Basil and her son John  Uh   Okay and the widow is called  Danelis  and Danelis is a rich  a rich widow  Uhm just the thing for a young man looking to get ahead  laughter  uhm who has a son John  And she  basically showers wealth and riches on  Basil the First well on Basil before he becomes Basil the First  So those are the  those are the main characters  Uhm there are several other characters that probably ought to be mentioned  Danel   Those pretty women  Women yeah  laughter   Okay can we start with the women  Okay there were two  weren't there two Eudokias   didn't know if that 's right   2 sylls    Right   Either  Eudokia or Eb-do-ki-a  It doesn't  it doesn't  it doesn't  matter that much   Okay   It was very  complicated  One was the wife  of Michael  One was the wife of Michael  And one was the one that Michael actually preferred to  his wife  laughter   It 's the one  that when she married the  m  the master   And he gave  her to  Basil  To Basil  And then there was the other I can't remember the name of the other one now  And then there was a child as well wasn't there  The Basil 's child eventually when he comes into the palace doesn't know whether  it 's his child or the result of of uhm Michael and   4 sylls     4 sylls    Yeah aye  Right yes because the what what actually happens when they get  when they sort of get set up in the palace is that  Michael the Third makes  Basil repudiate his wife Maria  and then  Michael makes Basil marry  Michael 's mistress  Ebdokia Ingerina  Why  Because then  Michael the Third can ignore  his own wife Ebdokia  Decapolitissa  and concentrate his attentions on his mistress who is now  Basil 's wife  Were the mistresses open then  Or do you know like like France is it would be culturally different to be a mistress  Right uhm  Like would they have to be like  was Basil  used as a decoy for Michael to get near his  It 's used as a decoy because whilst normally the people who would be  who would be  the mistresses would probably be known  At the same time it wasn't actually allowed  that means that you  can't be too open about it  and so as Sean actually writes it 's not really a me/nage-a\-trois because there 's four people in it  uhm  and this is part of the problem is that because Basil 's the First 's wife Ebdokia was actually the mistress of Michael the Third  it 's unclear whether Leo the Sixth  who 's the successor to Basil the First was actually Basil the First 's son  or Michael the Third 's son  Yup  See for a culture where you can  get artificial kinship and for the relations to be so strong  and yet you read about the untrust because he wasn't sure that it was son  I think that 's a bit contradictory  Do you know where you can look there 's all these rituals that can make a kin  yet there 's this  was it like even  did he want them dead at one stage or something  Like   Yes  he did  I mean that 's a bit extreme for somebody that you weren't could be your son  Do you know what I mean  Well yes it could be yours  Right the thing is that that Leo the Sixth could be your son but the other thing is that your son  or the person who supposedly is your son has allegedly just tried to kill you  So like the story is that Leo the Sixth attempted to assassinate  Basil the First    5 sylls   So it wasn't just to do with biology then  It was to do with personalities  It was to do with personalities and of course the struggle for power  as  everything normally is  Uhm so it 's not just that he sort of took an extreme dislike  that Basil took an extreme dislike uh to Leo the Sixth  Uhm now  the extent to which he had he had good cause  is unclear as well  And the other thing to remember is that Leo the Sixth is actually  the First 's second son because the first son that he actually hoped would succeed him died young  So there 's also part of a  a sort of  sort of mourning tied up in all that as well  Okay  Right   So when when Basil is trying to uhm  I mean he infers that Michael is homosexual  I mean wouldn't it be more accurate with all these you know women in the picture to kind of say he was bisexual  I mean if you know maybe there was no term for that at that time  Maybe it was just I mean  seen as quite acceptable that he could be with men or women and there wasn't that definition of it  But wouldn't it be more accurate if he  Mm you 're right there  Like I mean if he was homosexual and he had a wife  why have a mistress on  top of that   Exactly  You know  if he maybe if he just  had a wife I would say well I mean it 'd probably  mean because  he was supposed to have a wife in order to  give him  an heir or whatever  But if he also had a mistress I mean that would infer more that he  you know was attracted to this woman and obviously  so   4 sylls     2 sylls    Yeah   Cos I mean the other thing is that that his mistress  he actually had his mistress before he got married  and then his mummy said no you have to get married and you can't marry her  his mummy found him a new wife or you know a  new woman  to be his wife  But then he wouldn't give up the mistress and then that so  And I mean yes probably  the way that we think of  things  it 's it would be more accurate to describe him as as bisexual rather than  as homosexual  Uhm  More acceptable   Mm   You know or if it 's not even about sexuality  It 's about power or you know  something else rather than pleasure  that makes it even  phone rings   Hello  puts phone down  Uhm  yes but then is  sexuality not always about power  Mm   Aye   but part of the problem ends up being  you know this is where it becomes you virtually encounter most directly  the the fact of  the difference between our society where we divide people  you know with monotonous regularity into  you know straights and gays and undecideds or or  homosexuals heterosexuals and bisexuals  or bodysexuals and you know it gets worse  laughter  Don't want to talk about it  and  medieval society where  they actually looked at what  they didn't actually look at the people they actually concentrated on what the people did  And more often than not  admittedly it 's the Church that does the deciding  generally speaking and quite often they decide that everything that isn't  heterosexual intercourse within marriage  is wrong
