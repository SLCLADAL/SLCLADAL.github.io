<S2A-028 Investment Finance>  It 's very simple  You 're buying in products that have a recommended retail price on it  You just put your  your goods or your services out at that rate  However  it 's not usually as straightforward as that  Okay the first one we 're going to look at in any detail uhm is the cost plus pricing method alright  It 's very popular because it 's very simple one to use  What it actually does is if you know your hourly cost  or your product cost you can add a markup  In this case uhm we have on the board it 's a twenty percent markup  So what would happen if you worked out your hourly cost was fifteen pounds  You decide well if I 'm going to mark everything up by twenty percent to give me profit  alright  It would make then your price per hour eighteen pounds  And what you do is every time you charge yourself out you bill yourself eighteen pounds  Okay so it 's your cost plus a markup  And if there 's any direct costs or raw material you need to add those in as well  So that 's your hourly cost  multiply it up by your markup and then add on any raw materials  or extras that you 're charging  so   So that way  you 're only making only three pound an hour then  What it means see in this here  You 've covered all your drawings  what you need to live on right  You 've covered all your costs your overheads  your depreciation  and actually then you 're putting on a wee bit extra to make a profit  Again it can be up to you  It could be a twenty percent markup forty percent markup a hundred percent markup  Okay  Uh if you know your competitors are charging like thirty pounds an hour and your costs 're only ten you are not going to do a ten percent markup  You know you want to get it up there so you might be uh able  to markup two hundred percent  But it 's a very straightforward method  You decide on your markup and you just go through and add it on  Nobody manufacturing sure there 's not  Again it 's just you work up  get a cost for a product and add on your markup and get a selling price  It 's very straightforward  Uhm we 've a case here fifty percent markup 's being added  So if your cost is six pounds fifty percent markup that 's another three pounds  your final goods 'll be sold for nine pounds  If you 're going to go with cost plus pricing there 's a few wee dangers that you need to watch out for  It doesn't take into account market factors such as demand and what customers will pay  So say uhm I was costing fifty pounds an hour  and I decide well I 'm going to put a hundred a hundred percent markup  I 'm going to charge a hundred pounds an hour  Maybe nobody 'll pay that  I need to look at at just what 's out there and what they will pay and what the going rates are in the industry  It also ignores positioning and image  All I can say you know designer jeans  probably cost not a lot more to make than normal jeans but because there 's the you know the imaging you can put a huge markup on that  If you 're just going through your products with twenty percent markup you 'll miss the potential in there  Uhm sometimes costs like depreciation you forget  You know the tendency to do is you buy a product in and it 's ten pounds and you think och I 'll just shove a markup on that  you know twenty percent  But you 've forgotten you 've overheads and you 've depreciation to account for  There 's also lost sales if the pricing 's too high and then lost income if the pricing 's too low  Alright  So just be aware if you 're going to use that very straightforward method but there 's a number of dangers  Uhm Jan was saying about setting your price about you know where once you 've set that uhm customers who  2 sylls  come to the work they expect to maintain that price  from there  on in  Mhm   Mhm cos you 're setting a precedent  If  you put your prices up they might think hey hold on I 'm being taken advantage of here  Yeah you need to be very wary just initially  Yeah   Mhm  When you make a decision about your price you know  Mm yeah   Uhm the second one we 're going to look at is market-led pricing  alright  And it focuses on customers ' needs and wants uhm customer perceptions of your value or product  So that if you sell yourself as I 'm really good I 'm unique I can do all this they may be prepared to pay a bit more  Okay if you know that  you can set your price accordingly  Uhm market demand trends  say you have entered the sunbed industry and you 're the only one in the area  you put your price  Suddenly but loads of people come in  you 're not competitive any more  You may need to lower your price  So you need to look at the market and the demands in it  and also competitors ' prices  Uhm talking about the seaweed bath  say you decide to charge twenty pounds an hour  competitors open next door and they 're charging fifteen you might need to rethink your whole  pricing strategy  So the market-led pricing is looking at factors within the marketplace  and deciding on those  And this is a a pretty common one it 's differential pricing alright  And in this what happens is different margins or markups are used for different products or services  A typical example would be say the airline industry  Say if I went uhm to book a flight to Manchester tonight I go on the website I can maybe get certain prices  But if I go on in a week 's time the prices could be completely different  What happens usually in differential pricing you 'd maybe give discounts to bigger customers  or you might set a low price initially to get some work  or you might say uhm  I think this has potential in it  I 'm prepared to do a bit of  extra for you  and set you know sort of differential pricing depending on the customer or the job or even the timescale  Somebody needs a job done in a hurry you might put your prices up because you know that they 're going to pay extra  So what happens then there 's no one set price in differential pricing  Different prices for different products for different people different times  That would probably apply to you wouldn't it  Mhm  If you think somebody could afford a wee bit more you might   decide   If he was  a millionaire or something  laughter   There was one guy came in and he was living uhm said he lived up Malone Road  And he said you 'd get a  a quote on the phone and then they 'd find out where you lived  and the price would suddenly go up a bit  laughter  He says so I learn never to tell them where I live til I got a price from them  What probably happens in reality is it 's a bit of a mixture of all of those things  What you tend to do is you add on a bit of a markup  You see whether you could get away with a bit more  Alright  And then when it actually comes to it some customers you might give a discount to  or you might charge a bit more depending who they are  So it 's probably a mixture of all three to a certain extent  Again it 's up to yourself which type of pricing policy you use  And as Jan said it 's very important especially when you 're starting off to get the right price for yourself  Do you want to spend five minutes actually thinking now what price you 're going to set for your business whether it 's per hour or per job  or per day  or per session  Just use one of those techniques if you can  As I say usually most people would use some sort of mixture of them all Interruption for discussion   Uhm last thing we 're going to do in this section is a thing called break-even analysis alright  and what it is it 's trying to work out the point in your business where you neither make a profit  or or a loss where you actually break even so that your revenue equals your costs  You need to know this because sometimes what can happen it can take a few months for the business to actually break even  So you can be running at a  uh a loss for a few months  and then you make your profit  If you know when you 're going to break even then it can help you plan financially  But sometimes if you 're going to make a loss for a few months you 're going to need extra funding  You know you might need to go to your bank manager and say look uhm here 's my forecast  I 'm making a loss for three months but I should by month four have turned that around and I should be moving into profit  So you 'll actually need to know at what point in your business you 're going to break even  Okay so your costs are going to cover  or 're being covered exactly by your income  And all of you who love formulas  here 's the best one yet  The break-even point is where your total costs  and what is actually here is overheads that we looked at earlier right you depreciation that we looked at earlier plus your drawings  divided through by your sales price per unit  less any direct  2 sylls  equals  your break-even sales  I know it sounds a bit complicated but what they 're saying here say you 're selling price per unit is  what nine pounds and the raw material for that is a pound  so your total cost here so your depreciation and your overheads plus your drawings  divide that through then by  eight and you get one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five units  So what we 're saying is if we do one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five units we 're going to cover all our overheads our depreciation  and our drawings  At that point you will neither make a loss or a profit  It 'll just exactly cover costs  And that is what 's called the break-even point  Uhm a lot of people get a bit hung up on it cos it looks a bit scary  But it 's it 's basically it 's very simple  What we 're saying is say that product cost us nine or we were selling the product at nine pounds  we 've bought it in at a pound  there 's a difference there of eight pounds profit we 're making on on that one product  So there 's like an eight pounds contribution per product towards covering all our overheads  So how many of these do we need to sell to cover all our overheads  And that 's all it 's doing  It 's working out how many units  at that price will cover all our costs  Alright  So for the like uhm your jobs you might work out  I need to do twenty jobs a year to cover all my overheads and my drawings  Maybe you might need to sell two thousand units if you 're  to cover all your costs  Okay but you do need to know at what point your break-even sales are
