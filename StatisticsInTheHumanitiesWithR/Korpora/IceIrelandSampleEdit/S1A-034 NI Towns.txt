<S1A-034 NI Towns>  You know what it 's like  Lo  Londonderry uhm being a loose definition  until you decide  before you decide what   4 sylls    Yeah because it expands right out   Yes but all the   Are you counting  New Buildings  You 've heard of New Buildings  Yeah   Yes  2 sylls    It 's just that  yeah like  some of   The Evangelist  minister in that used to be Canon Fest  Right well you see but some people  wouldn't define that  as part of the city you see Edward   4 sylls  Alma Mater>   basical  basically the suburbs are not  Could I just make one point  But Lisburn Lisburn Lisburn Lisburn  No hold on    Lisburn Lisburn is not an over  flow of Belfast  Lisburn is a town with a distinct identity  It is  But it is bigger Edward  Edward it 's   No Edward   Will you  catch a grip   Well  Edward  Londonderry it 's bigger  It has been  3 sylls  right   But it 's not an overflow of Belfast  I lived in Lisburn  for a month and I know it has its  own identity   Oh it is  that what it is  He lived in Lisburn   sorry  4 sylls    I did I  6 sylls    Both of  you look  at it too  Bangor 's  an overflow of Belfast too  So technically Bangor Lisburn and Belfast are all sort of  one place  You know what I mean   That 's why I went to Laws for  3 sylls    No no don't  agree with that   Yeah  just they 've all  got their own distinct identity   3 sylls    Oh I don't know about that  you know nothing about  I know Londonderry is bigger than Lisburn  Londonderry has a lot   Londonderry Londonderry 's  an overflow of east Donegal  There you are   Excuse me  laughter   Ha ha ha ha  Luke keep  the  several sylls  east Donegal  Christ   It has a population of one hundred thousand Edward   Londonderry   Yes  And is that according to the  census figures  Aye but sure half half half the people in the Bogside don't fill in the census figures  That 's right   3 sylls  After people   And you 're telling me people from Twinbrook  and Poleglass  Well I think the the people in Twinbrook and Poleglass pale into into insignificance compared to the people in  in Bogside  Twinbrook and Poleglass are as big as the Bogside when you look at the figures of the populations in them  There 's about  there 's about four wards in Lisburn  that are sort of Twinbrook Poleglass and the like  You 're talking ten thousand people now  I 'm not talking ten thousand  people  I 'm talking six thousand   You 're talking no   Six thousand  Yes  Six thousand   No no  Listen   Sh sh   You 've  four wards  four wards  and a rural ward of that kind is roughly fifteen thousand people   No no no listen listen  Please no no listen listen  No  You are wrong  because there are over sixteen thousand electors  in Dunmurry Cross  Thank-you  Right  Look   What is Dunmurry  Cross   And about  Dunmurry Cross is the area which Poleglass and Twinbrook are in  What else is in it  Well practically there 's nothing else apart from Dunmurry which is only a  about a ward and a half  And then you 've got Twinbrook Poleglass the  Couple Area as it 's known   Twinbrook and Poleglass  are wards by themselves  I can remember it from the  boundaries course we did  And there 's only about fifteen hundred electorate in each  Yes but  2 sylls    well how does that square with the fact that there are seven  wards which add up to  over  sixteen thousand people  Mm   It couldn't add up because  there each  ward has  fifteen hundred people in it   There are   Lisburn  that 's  rubbish  Lisburn has thirty Lisburn has thirty Councillors representing  seventy-two thousand electors  There 's no seventy-two thousand electors  Luke go and look at your figures from under the  1 syll  Go and get your Telegraph  from way last year   Aye I remember  them  They were something like sixty-five  Excuse me  I  know   We 're  talking about   6 sylls    They were sixty-eight  You 're going back  to nineteen eighty-nine when they were sixty-five   2 sylls  comes on again   I 'm not  I 'm not   I am going to  the new parliamentary boundary constituencies which has been with  re-drawn to be  exactly the same as Lisburn Council going over it   Luke Luke Luke  Luke  you 're wrong   No Edward  I think  you 're wrong in this sort of thing  You 're not putting forward  Luke Luke 's putting forward some evidence here now  You 're just arguing  You see the sixty-five thousand which were sixty-five thousand   He said sixty-five thousand   He how many times  has he been in Twinbrook and Poleglass  My uncle used to live in Dunmurry  I 've visited those  shitty little areas all the time  I I I   I I 've to say I 'm  extremely proud of the fact that I 've never  laughter  been in Twinbrook or Poleglass  Well I 'm proud that I have cos I represent a party which is non-sectarian and  we go to   Oh yes and  how many Councillors do you have in Twinbrook and Poleglass  laughter   We have more councillors in Dunmurry Cross than your party has pal  In fact we 've more Councillors in that area than your party has in the whole of Lisburn  plus Belfast  plus Newtownabbey  Don't get  that   Plus  others    get so   So if  you 're going to say my party doesn't represent the people well that 's rubbish  laughter  The  Ulster Unionist  Party is the party of the people of Northern Ireland  Unionism   It 's based on a misconception that your party 's defending the Union but it blatantly did not  Remember nineteen eighty-five  Remember  the  3 sylls   betrayal  Remember  remember in nineteen ninety-two their document to the talks  So  It wanted Executive North South institutions  Youse have all tried to hush up that document but it exists  I think you would be surprised what the people of Northern Ireland would accept   Disagree with you  I think you really would later in tape   Edward did you see Prisoner  Friday night  No  Och 've you not seen it  It 's on tonight  Did you not see the one about Sandy  Is tonight Friday   I suppose it is   What  happens  with   Well  they 've got they 're about to hang Sandy  They 've poisoned her  Poisoned her  Who have  Marie got  Kate 's working in hospital and they were burning these drugs which were out of date  And  Marie got Kate to keep some that 'll make Sandy sick  So she 's just like burning them and she slips them in her pocket  And they put it into Sandy 's food then she was sick  she went down to the  Kate got her down to the shower blocks  and and left her there  And Marie arrived with a big noose  ready to hang  her   Right   So  why 're they going to hang her  In the showers   In the showers   Why  Because uhm  she 's uhm sort of putting Marie out  as  top dog  Mm   Sabotage the drug  then the drug thing   And Kate 's  Kate 's afraid that  Sandy 's going to realise that she   And then the drug thing and she hit her too   I think they 're going to kill her  I think she goes out of it cos they  put the  uh Sandy  They put the  noose right round her neck and  they were tying it up   Who   Kate 's a bitch  anyway  Isn't she  Yeah  You see Colleen 's going to be the new deputy governess  She 's a silly cow May  He left her anyway  Mm  5 sylls    Did he leave  her  He left her didn't he  Yeah he left her  He left her a note saying congratulations  4 sylls   And  he went back to where  was it you  call it   Yeah   Did she  turn down the job  She turned down the job before she found out that he had left her  I 'll bet she felt stupid  He thought she was going to accept it you see so he went back  Well he 'd been told that she 'd already accepted by your other  man you know  You know what I think might turn out  what was it the woman they were for hanging  yeah   Sandy  I think they find out that she 's pregnant  Do you think so  Yeah  yeah  yeah by the prison warden  Yeah   Cos there was something said in  I think she dies anyway though  Well I don't know  If she doesn't die I 'll think we 'll find out if if  they get her before she actually  Even if she does die  they can still tell   They can still tell  yeah  Cos she 's about to they just like  tied it up   About that  crooked  Mm  And where was B  Uhm they were down in the rec room  It was recreation time  you see   It 's about  time B got her  That terrible programme with Anderson on it  Yes  And what  the   Excuse  me  Gerry Anderson is from Londonderry  Which says everything about him  The English people don't like him  The Northern Ireland public don't like him   he was very popular on  Radio Foyle which was Londonderry  The Northern Ireland public do like him   It has to be said  his show his  show  Or Radio Station    never ever heard of Radio Foyle  you know  Excuse me but I   Oh I   Well it 's  a branch of Radio Ulster  I 've heard of Radio Foyle right enough  Some people haven't heard of it  How many people listen to Radio Foyle  Well the whole Foyle area basically listens  This is the same  as saying  no who who  who listens to Radio Foyle seriously  Well I  5 sylls    The whole Foyle area  I know that it 's transmitted to the whole Foyle area   all listen   But do  they actually switch in to   6 sylls     8 sylls    They all listen  Wait til you see  does your parents listen  to Radio Ulster at all  Do they listen to Radio Foyle  Ra  Radio Ulster  Wait a minute Alannah  Radio Ulster  Both my grandparents my grandparents listen to Radio Ulster  Thank-you   you see when radio   My parents have  Radio Ulster on  They do have Radio Ulster on  You see that proves my point because when Radio Ulster switches off in the Londonderry area Radio Foyle comes on  So people who listen to Radio Ulster then get Radio Foyle  Yes but not everybody in Londonderry would listen to Radio Foyle or Radio Ulster  Well an awful lot of people  at least we have our own radio  station  6 sylls    Cos it 's but everybody everybody  knows Radio Foyle is a success story  We shouldn't  be criticising it   It is a big  success story  Thank-you Ed  Thank Gerry Anderson  Can I say Gerry Anderson 's programme on Radio Ulster was excellent  It was always good  Sick George Jones was always good  Mm  It was always worth listening to to hear the people ringing in and making fools  of themselves   Yeah   Is that the one whole the supermarket game  No no it 's the other one  You 're thinking of  May McFetridge are you
