<S2B-047 QUB graduation>  Chancellor Vice Chancellor ladies and gentlemen uhm uh  I 'm really a a master of brevity  when I uh have been asked in the past to uh speak for three quarters of an hour I 've spoken for half an hour  When I 've been asked to speak for twenty minutes I speak for fifteen minutes  Now I 've been asked to speak for eight minutes and you can get your stopwatches out  I 'm greatly honoured to be standing here participating in this ceremony with so many young and I hope  hopeful people  I use the word  hopeful  because it 's a word connected to the young  the energetic  those at the threshold  those unfatigued by the stress of living  Hope is the mainstay of the writer  I hope I will finish the novel I 'm writing  I hope someone will publish it  I hope that having got it published the critics will notice its existence  I hope that someone will read it  And then the greatest hope of all  I hope I will one day write another novel  that I will feel the stirrings and anxieties of a new creation in my head  very much like a woman feeling the stirrings and anxieties of new life growing in her belly  I get the feeling that the majority of people think that writing is easy  It 's well for you  they say  just sitting at home writing all day  They seem to think it 's like a holiday  sitting there at the typewriter  inspiration relentlessly driving your fingers over the keys  Of course it 's not like that at all and I hope that any aspiring writers amongst you don't have any notions that it might be  Inspiration never comes unasked for  It never walks in your hall door without knocking and calls yoo-hoo I 'm here  The coupling of the head and the imagination can be quite fierce  quite painful  before the seed of an idea is set in the brain  After the birth  i  the idea which I may say gestates for months indeed sometimes painfully for years  has like an infant to be fed  and cared for  nurtured  clothed and guided through a million pitfalls until it reaches the stage you have all now reached when hopefully it is launched onto the world  At last it takes on its own life and the author is free to start once more to await with hope another birth  One of the few advantages of being a woman in the world of writing is that you recognise so well each symptom  each setback  You can perhaps cope better with your recalcitrant offspring  You know when to coax  when to read the riot act  when to applaud achievement  A novel is not a text  That was to have been my text for this address or small sermon  But when I mentioned it to my daughter who is a university lecturer in Dublin her reply was  but it is  So that put the kibosh on that  In her way  she is right  but also from my point of view  so am I  What I really want to say to you is that you have now after many years been liberated from the world of texts  from the pressures of exams  dissertations  You are now free to read whatever and however you wish  For so many years you 've been guided through the treasure store of our literature  and when I say  our  I mean the gamut of work written in these two islands  from Chaucer  Keats  to Yeats and now Seamus Heaney  Derek Mahon  Michael Longley and so many others  From Rosalinde and the Sentimental Journey through Ulysses  to Ripley Bogle  and even The Commitments  So many words  so many ideas  so many flights of the imagination  It 's a rich and astonishing cultural mixture  It is our luggage that we carry with us all our lives  joyfully  At least  I carry it joyfully  You 've been taught over these last years how to read  how to discover the complexities of a text  how to uncover the mysteries of language  You 've also probably been taught things about those texts that all too often the writers had no notion of themselves when they wrote the sentences on the pages  The author gives birth to the lively infant which grows to become an adult  spirited and free  sometimes even before it has time to grow gracefully old  it becomes a text  prone on the dissecting table  all angles and orifices examined and probed  joints checked  monihored  monitored  theories  judgements  diagnoses  Will the patient live or die  Does the patient deserve to live  or shall we perform solemn euthanasia  Who will we embalm  Who leave to rot  The patient will survive in spite of such treatment  and I believe that the student will also survive to   to perhaps become as reader in the real sense of the word  to perhaps become astonished constantly by what he or she finds between the covers of a novel or a book of poetry  A galaxy of stars  a stony path  a mountain  a time bomb  always truth and always the heart that even the most skilful dissection cannot stop beating  To get back to the beginning  which is what I was always taught you should do at the end of an essay and therefore I suppose it should also be due at the end of an address or sermon  I am hopeful for you  that maybe some of you may with your hope and energy change the world  and on the way to your doing that I hope that you will read more than a few books  Thank-you
