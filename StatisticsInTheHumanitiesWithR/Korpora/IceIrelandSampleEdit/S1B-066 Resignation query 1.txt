<S1B-066 Resignation query 1>  Derek McDowell of Labour asked Mr Russell how he had come to his conclusion that became included in Mr Whelehan 's report to the Government that there was nothing to suggest that Father Smyth 's offences were continuing or were likely to continue either here or in Northern Ireland   Because the facts given to us by the United Kingdom authorities showed  that the offences had ceased  in periods or at periods ranging from twenty-two years to six years previously  The offences had been committed in regard to a single extended family  They did not involve strangers  and they had ceased six years before  There there seemed to be a suggestion  it doesn't appear in that paragraph  but there seemed to be a suggestion that because uh Father Smyth was then resident in County Cavan in a monastery in County Cavan that uh he therefore felt that it was  less urgent as well  several sylls   that 's there also  Uhm why did you conclude that  Why did I  Yes  Because  although I know nothing about Kilnacrott Abbey  the title  suggests to me a closed institution  or an institution where the people uh who uh reside there are not  are not at large to to to  use to use  I 'm sure if I if I paused longer I could think of a better expression than that but uh to I would distinguish uh uh uh clergymen who live in an abbey or a monastery uh from clergymen who live in the community  That is my point  You see  i  it has given rise to some comment that because of the fact that he was a priest that you felt it was less urgent  I knew he was a priest apart from his address because the information given to us said so  I was not relying on the address for that for that uh for that point  I thought in fact he was a monk  since he lived in an abbey  Deputy Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats came back to the issue of the RUC 's interview notes which record Father Brendan Smyth 's admission of guilt for certain offences   Were the notes taken by the RUC officers which you refer to and distinguish from a confession  were they uh detailed notes of interviews by those officers with Father Smyth  I have no idea  Have you ever seen them   Well does it follow from that that uhm that uh the nature of  the the confessional nature of the evidence that was available or referred to in the submission that was made to the Attorney General 's office  that uh no no-one was in a position in the Attorney General 's office to  to work out from the papers that were submitted to them  uhm to what extent these were sketchy admissions or detailed admissions made to the RUC officers  I think that would be a a a fair statement of the situation  Well doesn't it follow from that Mr Russell again  that if you were going to consider the issue of delay that the recollection of Father Smyth and the detail of his confession if there was a confession made  would be central to a decision as to whether uh time  the elapse of time or delay had uh prejudiced uhm uh would or could prejudice uh uhm him in a way that would make him unfair to extradite him  The work I was doing in the Smyth case was attempting to identify from the  I think I could fairly say almost multitude of reported previous decisions of the courts to identify some principles or common threads which could be applied once they had been identified to the facts of the Smyth case  with a view  with a view to finding an answer to the request for extradition  I appreciate that   Yes but uh I 'm asking you uh and I think it 's a fair point  and not a lawyer 's point only  that in order to arrive at a decision as to whether or not someone was prejudiced by the delay the very first thing you would have had to put your mind to was in the  in the context of admissions  the quality and the nature and the detail of those admissions  Well first I think it would be necessary to discover whether the courts regarded admissions in such a case as of major significance in deciding whether twenty-nine years was too long an interval of time  Well I appreciate the the the that uh legal research could go on at one hand but I 'm suggesting to you that the nature of the admissions was something which you would uh have uhm uh oh very  it would be something to which you would attach very heavy weight indeed  because if if these were a flowing account of abusing uh  children in this family in West Belfast uh in which in which uh there was full and frank disclosure  it could hardly be that the that the man could then say but I am prejudiced now uh by by the elapse of time since he wouldn't be in a position to deny it if the if the admissions were were were quoted  The courts have held in some cases that mere elapse of time without any demonstration of prejudice to the wanted person is enough to prohibit a trial  I can appreciate that but I 'm I 'm I 'm saying in this context I don't I don't  certainly I can't recollect any cases which uhm which tend to suggest that uhm that a court would regard uhm the issue of admission or no admission uh as not being the central issue on the question of delay  Well are you aware I would  I am or perhaps you could tell me whether you are aware of any case in which in which the court has decided that that is the situation  No because because I don't believe that anybody  laughter  and as if the Deputies if the Deputies would listen I don't I 'm not aware of any case where somebody  I 'm not aware of any case where somebody who has admitted to a series of sexual offences has ever uh come to a court and said but it 's too late now  Mr Russell agreed with Deputy McDowell that the Smyth case could have been dealt with in twenty-one days by someone who had no other work to do  He also agreed that the substantive cause of delay was due to administrative overload in his office and not to the novelty and complexity of the case   The legal point was important and novel  s  struck me that it was the sort of matter which I should deal with  by reason of its novelty and importance  Yes but is it not the case that the  the vast the vast bulk of the delay that occurred in this case must be attributed not to the complexity of the point which you decided to deal with personally but to your other duties  which  distracted you from that  Yes indeed   Certainly  And uhm I have to suggest to you that uh in that context uh it uhm to say that uh to give to render as an excuse in public  which you didn't  but others have done that uh that this was the first case in which delay had  has arisen uh didn't do justice to the situation because the the the the the  the the substantive cause of the delay was uhm the uh the uh administrative overload on you and your officers  Well uhm certainly the huge volume of work which has to be done in the Attorney General 's office was a a very very significant factor in accounting  for the delay   But it was the   it was the predominant cause in terms of time of the delay isn't that right  I think probably that is the case  When questioned by Deputy Eamon Gilmore of Democratic Left Mr Russell repeated that the Smyth case was indeed an exceptional case in that it raised an exceptionally difficult point of law   Did you at any time uhm mention the case to the Attorney General  No  Why if it was an exceptional case did you not mention it to the Attorney General  Because if I 'd told the Attorney General  there is a case which has come in which raises an exceptional point of law of great difficulty  there was every chance he 'd say to me what 's the answer  to to the question and I wouldn't be able to tell him  That sort of conversation with an Attorney General is a fruitless one  laughter   Deputy Gilmore later said he was surprised that Mr Russell could have had various discussions with the Attorney General about extradition matters generally and extradition legislation in particular without mentioning one exceptionally difficult case  namely the Father Brendan Smyth case   I 'm not at all surprised  I 'll put it to you Mr Russell that uhm the average citizen may well be surprised that uh here the is the uhm officer who has statutory responsibility for extradition  the officer of his office who has the sole responsibility for dealing with it  having a number of conversations and discussions about extradition  you have a problematic case and you never mention it to him  The discussions were as I say on the legislation  the particular case  involving this particularly difficult question of law as I saw it and as I still see it  was not relevant to the legislation  If I raised the uhm fact that I had a difficult case on hands  he might very well have said to me  we  well what is the solution to this case and as I 've said already I wasn't in a position to answer that question  therefore I didn't see much point in in raising it with him  Yes  Deputy Willie O'Dea opened his questions to Mr Russell by asking him how long he had been dealing with extradition law in the Attorney General 's office  Mr Russell replied he thought that ten or fifteen years  He agreed with Mr O'Dea that he was the official who deals with the vast majority of extradition cases  Mr O'Dea then pursued a line of questioning on Mr Russell 's experience in the teaching of law   Were you ever involved in the teaching of law  I was  In what capacity  wa  was a member of the staff of the Law School of Trinity College  Uhm I 've been informed  please correct me if I 'm wrong  that you were actually a Reid Professor of Law at Trinity College  Is that correct   Yes I was   Uh what what  on what basis do Trinity College appoint somebody as Reid Professor  I would like to think merit  Yes  What age were you at the time  Uhm  Uhm  Roughly  Thirty-three I think  apart from uh Mrs Robinson you must have been one of the youngest  profes  Reid Professors of of of criminal law at Trinity College  Mr Russell agreed with Mr O'Dea that his client presented with a diametrically opposed view by two eminent lawyers would be left confused   The fact that there was conflict between  conflict of legal opinion between yourself and Mr Fitzsimons was conveyed to the Taoiseach and the Government on Monday the fourteenth of November  Uh isn't it natural that they would be confused since they 'd be in the same position as as as the client we 've just mentioned  I I suppose so  yes  in determining how the sub-section  should be should be applied uh in the Smyth case it it was and is your view very definite view that the Duggan case is not a conclusive precedent in fact not a precedent at all  It 's not a precedent at all and it gives no assistance whatever in resolving the problem of the twenty-nine year case  In fact you have described it as as  peripheral  unimportant  insignificant  These words which are not intended to cast any  any any  aspersions on the work of the officer who dealt with that case are are accurate I think uh simply because the issue didn't arise in a three and a half year case uh there was another factor also in it uh which I 've mentioned in in in my statement uh  and uh the it was not necessary for the officer to deal with the question  Yes I accept that   Now in view of the doubt and confusion and conflicting legal opinion  wouldn't the Taoiseach and his ministers have been justified in seeking and waiting for a definitive view on the matter  before the Taoiseach goes in to address the Da/il  Certainly if if if if the Government is ever confused about a a a legal question they should uhm clarify their minds before they embark on public utterances  that is if I may be permitted to appear to offer advice to the Government which of course is not my intention  Advice is most welcome  And uh it would be it would be wise to get that definitive opinion in writing wouldn't it  Yes  Uh in other words if the Taoiseach had simply gone into the Da/il on the Tuesday  knowing about the Duggan case  and referred to the matter in a simplified way that it was a precedent and that there was no need  uh that this explanation for the delay didn't carry any weight because the matter  the legal matter had been considered in depth before in the Duggan case  wouldn't he be misleading the Da/il in effect
