<S1B-050 Trinity students>  Student affairs  including clubs and societies  are administered by five groups  the Students ' Union  the Graduate Students ' Union  The Publications Committee  and the Central Societies Committee  who mainly control the cash  The CSC has a budget approaching one hundred and seventy thousand pounds for its eighty plus societies  Its chairperson is Mary Butler  It 's actually  what you might call the governing body of all the student societies in Trinity  It has various functions  basically administration and that  We seek our capitation fee from the Capitation Committee  and then distribute that fairly between the ninety student societies here in Trinity  We also provide facilities  for the societies up here in our offices  act of  what you might call court of appeal if any disputes arrive arise  between societies or   3 sylls    So you 're  in a very  lofty position then  You could call it that I  guess   I mean  you give out the cash  We do indeed yes  What facilities do you offer  Ehm as you can see from the outside office we have  a number of computers  telephone lines  a fax machine  photocopying  stuff like that  which are practical facilities for the societies  We also provide we 've staff members who help do up posters or invitations anything that societies may need to help them function in their day-to-day activities   And uhm  what sort of interest do the students themselves have in this  In the societies  are they  There actually is a great interest  I think  every student going through college will at some stage  join at least one society  if not more  I think Freshers ' Week  is a great week where first years probably join about ten societies and then decide after one year  weedle out the ones they 're interested in    Yeah   What  do you think are the most famous societies   I suppose historically  the Philosophical Society and the Historical Society  What do you think are the liveliest societies   Well the Science Fiction Society would be one of our largest and most  probably one of our most active  In your experience Mary what sort of student comes to Trinity  How would you describe the  kind of  typical Trinity student  I think the image of  the Trinity student has changed a lot throughout the years  I think now there 're more  I think if you go into any school around  the Dublin area or around the country  pick any student  they could be a  a Trinity student  I I don't think there is a typical Trinity student  anymore   Yet the  perception 's often that Trinity is a fairly posh expensive middle-class institution  Well this is it  This is the perception  I think that 's being reinforced somewhat by  you know  even now the the the promotion of the Trinity student being a very posh student  I don't think that 's the case  In my class alone I 'd say  the majority are working-class students  And I think that is the case throughout Trinity as a whole now  It 's it 's not no longer  a posh upper-class student  This is Jimmy Smith the  famous Clare hurler  How are you Jimmy  Very good thanks Brendan   Nice to meet you   Well what 're you  doing in college  Well I 'm I 'm back after thirty-five years in the wilderness  back doing Philosophy   And you 're enjoying  it   Yeah  I love it yeah  It 's grand to be back   Are you a member of  any society yourself  I 'm not really  Now I 'm joining the the Hurling Club here  I see and I 've decided to join it   That brings  back memories alright   That brings  back memories  Yeah it does  It 's nice to see these fellas coming in from the country in here and doing it in their spare time  There 's a lot of hard work here  and this 'd be a great kind of sideline for them during the course of the year  You chose a fairly difficult  subject but I  I suppose a good hurler is capable of doing anything  Ah it 's very I  words    Well you see when you 're training for a number of years and you you   every hurler is a philosopher in his own way  Because everybody you see and uh you meet on the pitch  you have to  you have to size them up  You have to know what they 're thinking  You have to see them  you have to know what they 're thinking before they actually get to the ball  Man is a very young fresher  just trying to get him to join hurling and football clubs like you know  He 's from Wexford so he 's probably no good but we 'll sign him up anyway like  you know  Which part of Wexford are you from  I 'm from  outside New Ross called Campile  And is uh is uh football popular there  Oh it 's fairly fairly popular yeah  GAA is very you know  it 's doing well like  you know what I mean  It 's uh  it 's a fairly good club down there alright  And what 're you going to   which club are you going to join here  Oh I 'll join the both of them and be damned you know uh sort of  the  hurling and football club  Did you   You might get a game with either the  football or the hurling club   It 's uh you never  know you know  It 's uh  There you go lads  We 've got the we 've got the League Cup here the University League which we 've won for the last two years  and which is a great uh achievement for Trinity like because before that uh the club was uh  you know it it was struggling to survive  ne  we didn't have the the members  Uh it 's only in the last few years Mr Kennelly 'll tell you when he came to college  there was there was a very small take  But in the last few years we 've got far more members  And we we ended up beating UCD  which for any Trinity team is the ultimate in success  No matter what you win  if you beat UCD  I mean that is uh that is heaven  And we beat UCD in the in the Fitzgibbon Shield two years ago  and uh it was probably the greatest achievement uh on the field that the club has ever had  I 've just signed up to the fencers  the college fencers  who I didn't know about  I never knew there was fencers until  a couple of weeks ago and I was  laughs  when I was looking them up to help to be involved in this thing that I 'm doing at the moment a a thing for players a show for players  And uhm  I went down and they had so much fun doing it  And there was actually a  uh a woman running the thing and she 's been running it for the last six years  I used the weight room facility in college for exercising  I exercise from physiotherapy that I had to do  And that 's a terrifly  mispronounces  male-dominated  To go into the gym then there I  the stink of male sweat as  laughs  soon as you open the door  And then after that it 's there 's there 's uh burly men there lifting weights  And I mean women really are looked as  You you 're told to use the weight machines because really you 're only down here for toning your muscles  DUCAC ahm  the the retreat for every man in college who feels he 's being harassed or intimidated by us women   that sweating centre of males  happily harassed by women  is administered by Cathy Doyle one of the most popular staff members in Trinity  Cathy talks to Maura Lee about the Central Athletic Committee  The initials  DUCAC stand for  Dublin University Central Athletic Committee  and it is a committee of around twenty people  made up of students and members of staff at the college  Where does DUCAC get its funds from  DUCAC gets  most of its funds  from the Capitation Committee in college  When the students come into college  as well as paying their fees  they pay a capitation fee which is approximately fifty pounds  All these fifty pounds go into a fund  administered by the Capitation Committee  and that money is distributed among five bodies in Trinity  of which DUCAC is one  So basically DUCAC uhm administers funds and controls the clubs  the sporting clubs in college  Is that it  We don't actually control them  they come to us  They apply to DUCAC for grants  so that they can hold their fixtures so they can travel away to  on tours  uhm so that they can host visiting teams in Trinity  so that they could either go to intervarsities  or host intervarsities  And they apply to us for funds  Our committee of twenty people sit down and we discuss the grants  and decide how the money is going to be spent  And then the clubs come back to see how well they got on or how well they didn't get on  laughs  And I administer the money uh distribute it to the to the clubs  So you 're a fairly important lady if you control the money  the purse strings  They think I am  laughter   And which are the bigger clubs   The swimming club is the  for the last few years has been the biggest club  For some reason swimming is very very popular  I would 've thought maybe the football club might 've  been the biggest   The   football club is a big club  It 's one of the older clubs as well in the  ge  in the college  Is it something to do with being around young people that you enjoy  I think that 's it  Yeah I do enjoy being round young people  The one thing I  find very  ah maybe unusual isn't the word  difficult maybe  is that the majority of people that are there are only there for four years  So if you have made very good friends of some students unfortunately they 're gone  Now we do  people I have got friendly with and maybe they 've gone to America and things like that they would still  contact me when they come back into Dublin and things like that  And we would meet  But it 's not maybe like in a workplace  you 'd be working with the same people for fourteen years or fifteen years  There is a turnover all the time of students  Do you see much of a change in the students over the years  Uh they 're more sophisticated  They seem to be more  I feel they 're more dress-conscious  I also think they are more studious  That they had to work so hard to get into college in the first instance I feel they seem to worry more about their exams  In the first term  that is sort of October to December  it 's not important at all  Second term maybe they realise  hey I 've done nothing this year  And then when third term comes you don't see them at all  they realise  I 've exams in May you know  I 'd better get the head down  Where I think maybe ten years ago  the pressure on exams and that  that wasn't there   Colm O'Dwyer you 're the Entertainments Officer of the Students ' Union  what precisely do you do  I run uh  pretty much all the student entertainment that goes on in the college  that 's the uhm  the concerts we 'd have in The Buttery  which is pretty much every night of the week  all the Balls throughout the year  and then I 'd  be in charge I 'm Music Officer for the Trinity Ball  so I 'd organise that end of things for that
