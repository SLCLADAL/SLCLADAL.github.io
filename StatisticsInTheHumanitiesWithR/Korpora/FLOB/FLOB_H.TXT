H01   1 <#FLOB:H01\><p_><tf|>2.1.29 The counties with the greatest increase 
H01   2 in the population count falls into two types. One is the 
H01   3 residential county adjacent to a large urban centre: for example, 
H01   4 Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, and West Sussex in relation to London; 
H01   5 and Hereford & Worcester and Shropshire in relation to the West 
H01   6 Midlands. The second type is made up of <tf_>remoter, mainly rural 
H01   7 districts<tf/>, including much of the South West (Cornwall, Dorset, 
H01   8 Somerset, Wiltshire, and Devon) and East Anglia (Cambridgeshire, 
H01   9 Norfolk, and Suffolk). A ranking of all counties by the 
H01  10 proportionate change in their population count during 1981-91 is 
H01  11 given in Table 5.<p/>
H01  12 <p_><tf|>2.1.30 The district and county patterns make it clear why 
H01  13 the most rapidly growing regions in 1981-91 were East Anglia, the 
H01  14 South West, and the East Midlands (see Table A). These are the 
H01  15 three regions of England which do not include a metropolitan 
H01  16 county. Furthermore, the fastest growing region - East Anglia - 
H01  17 lacks a city in the <tf_>large cities<tf/> category. (It is the 
H01  18 metropolitan counties and <tf_>large cities<tf/> that experienced 
H01  19 the biggest fall in population counts). Wales might seem to be an 
H01  20 exception to this, in that although it also contains no 
H01  21 metropolitan county its count increased by less than 1/2 per cent 
H01  22 over the decade. But industrial South Wales has some similarities 
H01  23 to a metropolitan county.<p/>
H01  24 <h_><p_>Population density<p/><h/>
H01  25 <p_><tf|>2.1.30 The population density of England & Wales as a 
H01  26 whole, as measured by the counts of people present on Census night 
H01  27 1991, was just over 3 persons per hectare. But there is 
H01  28 considerable variation over the country, and England (3 1/2 persons 
H01  29 per hectare) is almost three times as densely populated as Wales. 
H01  30 The most densely populated regions in 1991 were the North West and 
H01  31 South East, with 8 1/2 and 6 persons per hectare, respectively. No 
H01  32 English region is as sparsely populated as Wales overall, the least 
H01  33 densely populated regions being East Anglia, the South West, and 
H01  34 the North, all with fewer than 2 persons per hectare.<p/>
H01  35 <p_><tf|>2.1.32 The metropolitan counties (including Inner and 
H01  36 Outer London) were over eight times as densely populated as the 
H01  37 non-metropolitan counties, with Inner and Outer London the most 
H01  38 densely populated. Of the four most sparsely populated counties in 
H01  39 England & Wales, three were in Wales (Powys, Dyfed, and Gwynedd), 
H01  40 the other being Northumberland.<p/>
H01  41 <p_><tf|> 2.1.33 Despite a fall in the population count in the 
H01  42 1980s, Islington and Kensington & Chelsea remained the most densely 
H01  43 populated London Boroughs, containing over 100 persons per hectare. 
H01  44 Outside London, the greatest densities were in Portsmouth and 
H01  45 Blackpool with over 40 persons per hectare. At the other extreme, 
H01  46 there were 64 districts with densities below 1 person per hectare, 
H01  47 predominantly in Wales, the North, East Anglia, and the South 
H01  48 West.<p/>
H01  49 <p_><tf|>2.1.34 In contrast, population density in terms of the 
H01  50 count of persons present per household space was remarkably uniform 
H01  51 across all areas of England and Wales, ranging from 2.5 persons per 
H01  52 household space in Oxfordshire to 1.9 persons per household space 
H01  53 in Inner London. (The count of household spaces includes all 
H01  54 private living accommodation, whether occupied on census night or 
H01  55 not.)<p/>
H01  56 <p_><tf|>2.1.35 At local government district level, the range of 
H01  57 population densities is only a little wider: 2.6 persons per 
H01  58 household space (Tamforth) to 1.4 persons per household space (City 
H01  59 of London).<p/>
H01  60 <h_><p_>2.2 1991 Census preliminary counts compared with population 
H01  61 estimates<p/><h/>
H01  62 <p_><tf|>2.2.1 Each year, OPCS produces mid-year estimates of the 
H01  63 resident population of England & Wales, of which the mid-1990 
H01  64 estimates are the latest available at national level. The current 
H01  65 series of estimates is based on the 1981 Census results. They have 
H01  66 been updated annually by adding a year to the age of the 
H01  67 population, adding births, subtracting deaths, and making allowance 
H01  68 for migration. Though the 1991 Census will be used as the starting 
H01  69 point for similar estimates through the 1990s, the preliminary 
H01  70 Census results presented here have not been, and cannot be used for 
H01  71 this purpose because of differences in coverage described below. It 
H01  72 will be important, in due course, to compare estimates rolled 
H01  73 forward from 1981 with new results based on the 1991 Census to test 
H01  74 the quality of the estimating procedure, and if necessary make 
H01  75 adjustments. This cannot be cone properly until full Census results 
H01  76 for the <tf_>resident population <tf/> are available. The 
H01  77 preliminary counts represent only the population counted as present 
H01  78 on Census night.<p/>
H01  79 <p_><tf|>2.2.2 There are differences in the treatment of students 
H01  80 and armed forces between the Census and the population estimates. 
H01  81 The estimates count students at their term-time addresses, and 
H01  82 armed forces at their stationed addresses, but the Census question 
H01  83 on term-time address of students will allow figures for students to 
H01  84 be produced on both bases. The OPCS population estimates also allow 
H01  85 for Census under-enumeration, the extent of which will not be 
H01  86 established until the relevant results from the Census Validation 
H01  87 Survey are available in Summer 1992.<p/>
H01  88 <h_><p_>Comparison for England & Wales<p/><h/>
H01  89 <p_><tf|>2.2.3 For the whole of England & Wales, the preliminary 
H01  90 Census count is a little lower (by about 2 per cent) than the 
H01  91 1981-based estimate, after making corrections for definitional 
H01  92 differences between the two figures. The estimated difference is 
H01  93 about 1 million people. This estimate will change when a comparison 
H01  94 with the census count of residents is made.<p/>
H01  95 <p_><tf|>2.2.4 Data on births and deaths are considered to be 
H01  96 reliable; but the international migration figures, based mainly on 
H01  97 data from the sample based <tf_>International Passenger 
H01  98 Survey<tf/>, are less accurate. However, errors in the estimation 
H01  99 of migration flows are not expected to be able to account for more 
H01 100 than about 100,000 people. Other components of the difference 
H01 101 between estimates and Census results include: the number of 
H01 102 households where nobody could be contacted (believed to be around 
H01 103 140,000 when the preliminary counts were compiled), and a change in 
H01 104 the balance between visitors to England & Wales and absent 
H01 105 residents since the 1981 Census. This change is estimated around 
H01 106 -300,000, but this involves a substantial margin of uncertainty. It 
H01 107 is also likely that under-enumeration in the 1991 Census was 
H01 108 greater than in the 1981 Census, when around 1/4 million people 
H01 109 were omitted from the present population. Early indications also 
H01 110 suggest that not everyone present on census night in hospitals, 
H01 111 hotels, and other communal establishments was counted. The size of 
H01 112 the under-enumeration will be estimated when the results of the 
H01 113 Census Validation Survey are available.<p/>
H01 114 <h_><p_>Comparison for districts<p/><h/>
H01 115 <p_><tf|>2.2.5 For sub-national areas, the discrepancies between 
H01 116 rolled forward estimates and the Census preliminary counts are 
H01 117 proportionately larger. This is because there is no satisfactory 
H01 118 method of bringing the two sets of figures on to a comparable base 
H01 119 for small areas. Because of this difficulty, the particular 
H01 120 analysis presented in Table E of the <tf_>1981 Census Preliminary 
H01 121 Report<tf/> is not repeated here. Instead, to give an early 
H01 122 indication of the level of comparability between the Census and the 
H01 123 estimates, Table E below shows a comparison of intercensal 
H01 124 <tf|>changes calculated from the 1981 and extrapolated 1991 
H01 125 estimates, and the increases and decreases recorded in 1981 and 
H01 126 1991 Census preliminary counts (with allowance in both cases for 
H01 127 boundary changes).<p/>
H01 128 <p_><tf|>2.2.6 The table shows that for 319 of 403 districts the 
H01 129 direction of population change is the same when calculated from 
H01 130 both sources, but only 141 districts fall in the same broad band. 
H01 131 For most districts, the increase of the estimated resident 
H01 132 population is greater than that of the preliminary count of the 
H01 133 population present (generally between 2 and 3 per cent). This shows 
H01 134 up in Table E, where the figures for most districts lie below the 
H01 135 diagonal row for cells running from top left to bottom right of the 
H01 136 table. As with the comparison at national level, the reasons for 
H01 137 this are thought to include:<p/>
H01 138 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>a greater number of 'no-contacts' in the 1991 
H01 139 Census compared with 1981;<p/>
H01 140 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>a changed visitor/absent resident balance 
H01 141 compared with 1981 (this cannot be corrected for local areas); and 
H01 142 <p/>
H01 143 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>an increased amount of under-enumeration (eg 
H01 144 missed households and persons missed in enumerated households) 
H01 145 compared with the 1981 Census.<p/>
H01 146 <p_>All these make the 1981 count larger relative to that of 
H01 147 1991.<p/>
H01 148 <p_><tf|>2.2.7 A few districts show significantly different changes 
H01 149 when the Census counts are compared with the estimates. The Census 
H01 150 counts for those districts growing much faster according to the 
H01 151 Census Cambridge, and the Isles of Scilly, will be affected by the 
H01 152 presence of students and visitors respectively - factors which can 
H01 153 be expected to blur the assessment of change in the resident 
H01 154 population since 1981. The districts with substantial deviations in 
H01 155 the other directions are Richmondshire and Purbeck which contain 
H01 156 considerable armed forces populations, the Vale of Glamorgan, and 
H01 157 Hackney.<p/>
H01 158 <h_><p_>3 Future publications<p/>
H01 159 <p_>Population present on Census night<p/><h/>
H01 160 <p_><tf|>3.1 Following this <tf_>Preliminary Report<tf/>, census 
H01 161 reports and tables will be produced by analysis of the data keyed 
H01 162 into the computer directly from forms. Census forms received too 
H01 163 late for the <tf_>Preliminary Report<tf/> will be included in the 
H01 164 final figures. In 1981, the overall difference between the final 
H01 165 figure for the population present on Census night and the 
H01 166 preliminary figure was 0.3 per cent, part of which was due to a 
H01 167 processing error which inflated the final counts.<p/>
H01 168 <h_><p_>Resident population<p/><h/>
H01 169 <p_><tf|>3.2 The main census results will be based not on the 
H01 170 population <tf|>present on Census night, but on the population 
H01 171 <tf|>resident in each area. This is because central government, 
H01 172 local and health authorities, and others generally plan the 
H01 173 provision of services and the allocation of resources for the 
H01 174 resident population. The resident population will exclude visitors 
H01 175 to an area, and include residents who happened to be absent from 
H01 176 the area on census night. The count of residents will also include 
H01 177 imputed details for households where nobody could be contacted, but 
H01 178 where people were believed to live. (An article explaining how this 
H01 179 is being done was published in the Summer 1991 issue of 
H01 180 <tf_>Population Trends - No.64<tf/>).<p/>
H01 181 <p_><tf|>3.3 Census questions can be divided into those to which 
H01 182 the responses are relatively easy to process and those which are 
H01 183 more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to process. In 
H01 184 general, this division determines whether the question is fully 
H01 185 processed (<tf_>a 100 per cent item<tf/>) or whether it is 
H01 186 processed only for a ten per cent sample of the household forms and 
H01 187 a ten per cent sample of persons returned on the forms for communal 
H01 188 establishments (<tf_>a 10 per cent item<tf/>). A detailed list of 
H01 189 the questions is given in Appendix IV, which also contains a list 
H01 190 of the topics for which special volumes will be published.<p/>

H01 210 <h_><p_>Evaluating the results<p/><h/>
H01 211 <p_><tf|>3.5 Final results from the census will inevitably still 
H01 212 contain some inaccuracies, mainly form the following:<p/>
H01 213 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>failure to identify all the living accommodation 
H01 214 in an area;<p/>
H01 215 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>incorrect classification of accommodation as 
H01 216 vacant, and hence failure to include the occupants in the 
H01 217 census;<p/>
H01 218 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>failure to identify all the households in a 
H01 219 building; and<p/>
H01 220 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>incorrect information supplied by people filling 
H01 221 in forms, perhaps through misunderstanding of the form.<p/>
H01 222 <p_><tf|>3.6 The Census Validation Survey will quantify these 
H01 223 inaccuracies. Field work for the survey has already been carried 
H01 224 out in a sample of enumeration districts. In this voluntary survey, 
H01 225 addresses in the sampled enumeration districts were listed for 
H01 226 comparison with the enumerators' records; the accuracy of response 
H01 227 for a sample of 6,000 households was checked by interview; and the 
H01 228 number of households at each sampled address was investigated.
H01 229 
H02   1 <#FLOB:H02\><h_><p_>(c) Disease patterns<p/><h/>
H02   2 <p_>Compared with those in the white population, considerable 
H02   3 variations in the disease patterns amongst the black and ethnic 
H02   4 minority groups have been noted. There are also variations between 
H02   5 the different minority groups. These need to be recognised to 
H02   6 ensure that appropriate services are provided. It is also important 
H02   7 to monitor changes that may occur over time. Apart from the 
H02   8 important implications for the health services needed by the black 
H02   9 and ethnic minority community, these changes may also provide 
H02  10 valuable information about the causation of some diseases.<p/>
H02  11 <h_><p_>Coronary heart disease and stroke<p/><h/>
H02  12 <p_>Balarajan found an excess coronary heart disease mortality (see 
H02  13 Figure 3.6) in those born in the Indian Subcontinent of 36% for men 
H02  14 and 46% for women aged 20-69 years compared with the rates for 
H02  15 England and Wales as a whole in 1979-83; hospital-based studies 
H02  16 have shown an even greater excess risk. Furthermore, in this group 
H02  17 coronary heart disease mortality increased between 1970-72 and 
H02  18 1979-83, and is predicated to rise further due to the effects of 
H02  19 demographic change. The causes of these findings are not fully 
H02  20 understood, but they have important implications for the planning 
H02  21 of services. Research into the causes may help in the development 
H02  22 of health promotion strategies and also throw more light on the 
H02  23 causes of coronary heart disease in general.<p/>
H02  24 <p_>Ethnic differences in conventional risk factors, such as 
H02  25 smoking, raised blood pressure and high serum cholesterol, cannot 
H02  26 adequately explain the data, although other variables, including 
H02  27 hypothyroidism and stress, have been suggested. It has also been 
H02  28 argued that Asians may be predisposed to a physiological 
H02  29 disturbance characterised by insulin resistance that, under certain 
H02  30 conditions, can lead to both coronary heart disease and 
H02  31 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It is interesting that 
H02  32 both disorders may be more common in urban than in rural parts of 
H02  33 India, but further systematic research is required. Furthermore, it 
H02  34 is puzzling that whilst Caribbeans also show abnormalities of 
H02  35 glucose and insulin metabolism, their rates of coronary heart 
H02  36 disease are comparatively low.<p/>
H02  37 <p_>For stroke, on the other hand, Balarajan found that, in those 
H02  38 born in the Caribbean, there was an excess of deaths of 76% for men 
H02  39 and 110% for women compared with the rates for England and Wales as 
H02  40 a whole in 1979-83. There were also increased risks (63% for men 
H02  41 and 39% for women) for those born in the African Commonwealth. The 
H02  42 next highest risk was for those born in the Indian Subcontinent, 
H02  43 with excesses of 53% and 25% for men and women respectively. All 
H02  44 groups experienced a reduction in mortality from stroke between 
H02  45 1970-72 and 1979-83, particularly those from Africa and the 
H02  46 Caribbean. However, those from the Indian Subcontinent experienced 
H02  47 a comparatively small reduction (3% and 25% for men and women 
H02  48 respectively).<p/>
H02  49 <p_>It is not possible to attribute all of the excess deaths from 
H02  50 stroke in those of African origin in this country to higher levels 
H02  51 of blood pressure. Similarly it is difficult to explain the low 
H02  52 levels of coronary heart disease in this group on the basis of the 
H02  53 known distribution of the conventional risk factors.<p/>
H02  54 <h_><p_>Communicable disease<p/>
H02  55 <p_>Immunisation<p/><h/>
H02  56 <p_>Immunisation uptake data are collected according to District 
H02  57 Health Authority (DHA) areas, and are not available according to 
H02  58 ethnic origin. Although Districts with the lowest immunisation 
H02  59 uptake tend to be those with the greatest socio-demographic 
H02  60 problems, there are Districts with significant black and ethnic 
H02  61 communities where immunisation uptake is equal to, or better than, 
H02  62 the national average.<p/>
H02  63 <p_>The Asian community has been particularly affected by rubella 
H02  64 infections in pregnancy. In England in 1991, the lowest ever number 
H02  65 of laboratory confirmed rubella infections in pregnancy was 
H02  66 reported. Of the 16 such infections, six (37%) were in Asian women; 
H02  67 this compares with 19 out of 96 (11%) in the period 1988-90. Of the 
H02  68 25 Asian women infected in the period 1988-91, seven were recent 
H02  69 immigrants who were pregnant on arrival in the UK and had 
H02  70 contracted rubella in their country of origin. Only ten of the 25 
H02  71 cases presented during pregnancy, the remaining 15 being diagnosed 
H02  72 retrospectively following the birth of a congenital 
H02  73 rubella-affected infant. Immigration into the UK before pregnancy, 
H02  74 but after the age at which rubella vaccine is offered at school, 
H02  75 has also contributed to the high rate of susceptibility to rubella 
H02  76 infection in Asian women. The promotion of selective rubella 
H02  77 immunisation in the Asian community therefore needs to be 
H02  78 continued. In the UK the anticipated interruption of rubella 
H02  79 circulation will prevent rubella-susceptible pregnant women from 
H02  80 being exposed to rubella, but elimination of all cases of 
H02  81 congenital rubella will only be achieved when rubella immunisation 
H02  82 programmes are introduced in developing countries.<p/>
H02  83 <h|>Tuberculosis
H02  84 <p_>In the first six months of 1988 nearly 40% of the patients 
H02  85 notified as having tuberculosis were of Indian, Pakistani or 
H02  86 Bangladeshi origin. Although, for these groups, the number of 
H02  87 notifications has declined over the last ten years by an average of 
H02  88 6% per year, this decline is less than that recorded in the white 
H02  89 population, in whom the rate of infection is 25 times lower. The 
H02  90 spectrum of disease also varies with ethnic origin. For example, 
H02  91 those from the Indian Subcontinent have more non-respiratory 
H02  92 disease, particularly tuberculous lymphadenitis and abdominal 
H02  93 tuberculosis.<p/>
H02  94 <p_>The Department of Health (DH) recommends that people coming 
H02  95 from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, and their 
H02  96 children and infants wherever born, should have a Heaf test 
H02  97 followed by BCG vaccination if indicated. New-born babies should be 
H02  98 vaccinated within a few days of birth, without having a Heaf test 
H02  99 performed. There is a need for continuing health education about 
H02 100 tuberculosis directed at black and ethnic minority groups.<p/>
H02 101 <h_><p_>Hepatitis B<p/><h/>
H02 102 <p_>Africa, the Far East and some parts of the Caribbean are areas 
H02 103 of high edemicity for hepatitis B, and more than 8% of their 
H02 104 resident populations carry the virus. The Indian Subcontinent is an 
H02 105 area of intermediate endemicity, and 2-7% of people living there 
H02 106 are carriers.<p/>
H02 107 <p_>In the Far East, many children are infected at birth. On the 
H02 108 other hand, infections in Africa commonly occur in early childhood, 
H02 109 mainly within the household. The extent to which the latter pattern 
H02 110 of transmission will survive migration to the UK is not yet clear. 
H02 111 However, perinatal transmission will continue, because the children 
H02 112 born to infectious carrier mothers are themselves likely to become 
H02 113 infectious carriers unless immunised shortly after birth. Antenatal 
H02 114 clinics in the UK have a screening programme to identify women who 
H02 115 are carriers of the hepatitis B virus, so that their babies can be 
H02 116 immunised. The prevention of perinatal transmission leads to 
H02 117 significant health benefits, as it is people infected as babies who 
H02 118 are most likely to become carriers and be at risk of chronic liver 
H02 119 disease.<p/>
H02 120 <h_><p_>HIV infection and AIDS<p/><h/>
H02 121 <p_>WHO estimates that, during the 12-month period beginning in 
H02 122 April 1991, over one million people world-wide will have been newly 
H02 123 infected with HIV, and that 90% of these infections will have 
H02 124 occurred in the developing countries. Data on reports of HIV 
H02 125 infection and AIDS in this country, published each month by DH and 
H02 126 by the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, reflect the nature 
H02 127 of this global epidemic, a number of the cases reported being of 
H02 128 people infected in, or by people from, countries where prevalence 
H02 129 is already high (see pages 83-88). Fortunately the numbers are 
H02 130 still low, but they underline the importance of the national and 
H02 131 local educational initiatives that were developed with the black 
H02 132 and ethnic minorities in 1991, and which are described on page 
H02 133 92.<p/>
H02 134 <h_><p_>Blood diseases<p/><h/>
H02 135 <p_>Haemoglobinopathies, or defects of haemoglobin production, are 
H02 136 inherited disorders found primarily in the black and ethnic 
H02 137 minorities. They may be divided into two main groups -those caused 
H02 138 by abnormal haemoglobins, for example sickle cell disease, in which 
H02 139 there is a single amino acid change in one of the globin chains, 
H02 140 and the thalassaemias, in which there is an imbalance in production 
H02 141 of globin chains.<p/>
H02 142 <p_>Sickle cell disease primarily affects the Afro-Caribbean 
H02 143 population, although there is also a low incidence in people from 
H02 144 the Mediterranean and Arabia. The estimated number of people with 
H02 145 all types of sickle cell disease in the UK is about 5,000. The 
H02 146 number of cases of beta-thalassaemia major in the UK is estimated 
H02 147 to be about 350. This disorder primarily affects people from the 
H02 148 Mediterranean, the Indian Subcontinent and the Middle East. In view 
H02 149 of the uneven distribution of the different black and ethnic 
H02 150 minority groups across the country (see page 56), there is a 
H02 151 concentration of people with these blood disorders in some areas. 
H02 152 Many of these are in inner cities, often in deprived areas.<p/>
H02 153 <p_>For both sickle cell disease and thalassaemia, the number of 
H02 154 individuals with the trait (carriers) is well in excess of the 
H02 155 number of individuals with the disorder. Although individuals with 
H02 156 the trait do not usually have any clinical problems, if their 
H02 157 partner also has the trait each of their children has a 1 in 4 
H02 158 chance of having the disorder. Screening may be performed before 
H02 159 at-risk individuals plan to have a family, during the early stages 
H02 160 of pregnancy, or soon after birth. Some Districts with a high 
H02 161 proportion of members of the relevant black or ethnic minority 
H02 162 screen all neonates. Opportunistic screening should be undertaken 
H02 163 when at-risk individuals are seen in hospital. Cards stating that 
H02 164 the holder has the disorder or trait are issued to individuals so 
H02 165 identified.<p/>
H02 166 <p_>Where it is relevant, some DHAs provide funds for counselling 
H02 167 centres. These provide advice and education to people who have 
H02 168 haemoglobinopathies or are at risk. Counsellors, usually nurses or 
H02 169 health visitors, also arrange contacts with social workers to 
H02 170 ensure adequate housing, as sickle crises may sometimes be related 
H02 171 to cold or damp. Management of the many and varied clinical 
H02 172 problems associated with the haemoglobinopathies is complex, and 
H02 173 involves not only the patient's general practitioner (GP) but also 
H02 174 hospital consultants in various specialities. The Standing Medical 
H02 175 Advisory Committee has set up a Working Party to look at the 
H02 176 clinical management of sickle cell disease; the first meeting is 
H02 177 due to be held early in 1992.<p/>
H02 178 <h_><p_>Mental health<p/><h/>
H02 179 <p_>There are marked differences in the incidence of mental illness 
H02 180 in the black and ethnic minority groups. The incidence of 
H02 181 schizophrenia appears to be 3-6 times higher amongst Caribbean 
H02 182 people in England compared with that in the general population and 
H02 183 in Caribbeans living in Jamaica. Misdiagnosis has not been 
H02 184 confirmed, although it is difficult to exclude entirely cultural 
H02 185 biases. Alternative explanations include differential psychosocial 
H02 186 stress through the effects of racism, unemployment and possibly 
H02 187 biological correlates. Caribbean people are also more likely to be 
H02 188 admitted to hospital compulsorily, particularly by the police, with 
H02 189 whom they will have had greater contact prior to admission than 
H02 190 matched controls.<p/>
H02 191 <p_>Conversely, studies of hospital admission rates, GP 
H02 192 consultation rates and community surveys suggest that, in general, 
H02 193 Asians have rates of psychiatric morbidity that are similar to, or 
H02 194 lower than, those of the native-born population. However, Ineichen 
H02 195 has pointed out that some of these findings could be due to 
H02 196 reluctance on the part of the Asians to present to conventional 
H02 197 practitioners with mental health problems, or to failure on the 
H02 198 part of GPs to recognise them if they do. A recent survey of mental 
H02 199 health provision in Newham also found that, whilst Asians were 
H02 200 underrepresented amongst those being given mental health care in 
H02 201 the National Health Service (NHS), they were more likely to be 
H02 202 found amongst the clients of voluntary agencies that either 
H02 203 accepted self-referrals or offered a specific service to the Asian 
H02 204 community. Similar agencies for immigrants in other European 
H02 205 countries are now operating.<p/>
H02 206 <h_><p_>Diabetes mellitus<p/><h/>
H02 207 <p_>The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in England in people of 
H02 208 Asian and Caribbean origin is twice as high as it is in the general 
H02 209 population. In Asians alone it is increased fivefold. It is usually 
H02 210 the non-insulin-dependent type of the disease, which occurs at or 
H02 211 after middle age, and is associated with insulin resistance and 
H02 212 central obesity, and with an increased risk of death or disablement 
H02 213 from complications unless well-controlled. There is some scope for 
H02 214 the prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by 
H02 215 controlling obesity, increasing physical activity, and maintaining 
H02 216 an appropriate diet and a healthy lifestyle.<p/>
H02 217 
H02 218 
H03   1 <#FLOB:H03\><p_>Children should have early experiences with 
H03   2 devices, for example, <tf|>toys, which move and store energy. They 
H03   3 should experience natural and manufactured forces which push, pull, 
H03   4 make things move, stop things and change the shape of objects. Such 
H03   5 experiences could include, for example, <tf_>road safety 
H03   6 activities<tf/>. Children should investigate the factors which 
H03   7 affect floating and sinking.<p/>
H03   8 <p_>Children should be made aware of some uses of electricity in 
H03   9 the classroom and in the home and the dangers of misuse. They 
H03  10 should experience play activities with a variety of magnetic 
H03  11 materials and investigate their effects on a range of materials and 
H03  12 for a variety of uses. They should explore the Earth's magnetic 
H03  13 field using a compass. They should experience simple activities 
H03  14 using bulbs, buzzers, batteries and wires. Children should 
H03  15 investigate those materials which conduct electricity and those 
H03  16 which do not.<p/>
H03  17 <p_>Children should have the opportunity to experience the range of 
H03  18 sounds in their immediate environment and to find out about their 
H03  19 causes and uses. They should experience the production of echoes 
H03  20 resulting from the reflection of sound from distant surfaces. They 
H03  21 should investigate ways of making and experiencing sounds by 
H03  22 vocalising and striking, plucking, shaking, scraping and blowing, 
H03  23 for example, <tf_>using familiar objects and simple musical 
H03  24 instruments from a variety of cultural traditions<tf/>. They should 
H03  25 explore various ways of sorting these sounds and instruments. 
H03  26 Children should have opportunities to explore a variety of light 
H03  27 sources and effects related to shadows, reflection and colour.<p/>

H03  31 <p_>The abilities to communicate, to relate science to everyday 
H03  32 life and to explore, are essential elements of a developing 
H03  33 experience of science.<p/>
H03  34 <p_><tf|>Communication: children should have opportunities to 
H03  35 continue to develop and use communication skills in presenting 
H03  36 their ideas and in reporting their work to a range of audiences, 
H03  37 including children, teachers, parents and other adults. In giving 
H03  38 an account, either orally or in written form, they should be 
H03  39 encouraged to present information in an ordered manner. They should 
H03  40 be introduced to the conventions involved in using diagrams, 
H03  41 tables, charts, graphs, symbols and models. Children should be 
H03  42 given opportunities to participate in small group discussions and 
H03  43 they should be introduced to a limited range of books, charts and 
H03  44 other sources from which they can gain information. Children should 
H03  45 use the computer to store, retrieve and present their work and 
H03  46 extend their understanding of information transfer.<p/>
H03  47 <p_><tf_>Science in everyday life:<tf/> as children begin to gain 
H03  48 increasing knowledge and understanding, they should be given the 
H03  49 opportunity to develop further an awareness of the role and 
H03  50 importance of science in everyday life including personal health 
H03  51 and safety and the use of microelectronic devices to control 
H03  52 appliances in the home. This awareness might be developed through 
H03  53 investigations or through case studies, secondary sources of 
H03  54 information, or visits. Industrial contexts should be introduced, 
H03  55 alongside those of domestic and environmental contexts, as 
H03  56 starting-points for children's work in science.<p/>

H03  58 <p_>Detailed provisions<p/><h/>
H03  59 <p_>Children should be encouraged to develop their investigative 
H03  60 skills and their understanding of science in activities which:<p/>
H03  61 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> encourage children to use and develop their 
H03  62 scientific knowledge and understanding.<p/>
H03  63 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> promote the raising and answering of

H03  70 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> build on their existing practical skills.<p/>
H03  71 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> require the deployment of an increasingly

H03  99 <h_><p_>Knowledge and understanding of science<p/>
H03 100 <p_>Detailed provisions<p/><h/>
H03 101 <p_>Children should be introduced to the major organs and organ 
H03 102 systems of mammals and flowering plants. They should investigate 
H03 103 some aspects of feeding, support, movement and behaviour in 
H03 104 relation to themselves and other animals. They should be introduced 
H03 105 to basic ideas about the processes of breathing, circulation, 
H03 106 growth and reproduction. They should investigate the effects of 
H03 107 physical factors on the rate of plant growth, for example, 
H03 108 <tf_>light intensity, temperature and the amount of 
H03 109 fertiliser<tf/>. Children should study the ways in which microbes 
H03 110 can affect health and learn about the factors which contribute to 
H03 111 good health, including the defence systems of the body, diet, oral 
H03 112 hygiene, and exercise. They should be introduced to the fact that 
H03 113 while all medicines are drugs, not all drugs are medicines; and 
H03 114 they should begin to be aware of the catastrophic effect on health 
H03 115 resulting from an abuse of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs.<p/>
H03 116 <p_>Children should investigate and measure the similarities and 
H03 117 differences between themselves, accessible plants and animals and 
H03 118 their fossil counterparts. They should understand that plants and 
H03 119 animals can be preserved as fossils in different ways. They should 
H03 120 have the opportunity to develop skills in identifying locally 
H03 121 occurring species of plants and animals and marking these against 
H03 122 keys, using observable structural features of organisms. They 
H03 123 should be introduced to how information is passed from one 
H03 124 generation to the next.<p/>
H03 125 <p_>Children should explore and investigate at least two different 
H03 126 localities and the ways in which plants and animals are suited to 
H03 127 their location and how they are influenced by environmental 
H03 128 conditions, including seasonal and daily changes, and by 
H03 129 competition for scarce resources. They should detect and measure 
H03 130 environmental changes, using a variety of instruments. They should 
H03 131 develop an awareness and understanding of the necessity for 
H03 132 sensitive collection and care of living things used as the subject 
H03 133 of any study of the environment. They should study aspects of their 
H03 134 local environment which have been affected by human activity, for 
H03 135 example, <tf_>farming, industry, mining or quarrying<tf/>. They 
H03 136 should be encouraged to argue for and against particular planning 
H03 137 proposals in the locality which may affect their environment. They 
H03 138 should study the effects of pollution on the survival of 
H03 139 organisms.<p/>
H03 140 <p_>Children should be introduced to food chains as a way of 
H03 141 representing feeding relationships. They should be introduced to 
H03 142 the role of microbes, and to the importance of warmth, moisture and 
H03 143 air, in the process of decay. They should build on their 
H03 144 investigations of waste materials to include a study of the 
H03 145 significant features of waste disposal procedures, decay processes 
H03 146 and the usefulness of any product(s), for example, <tf_>in sewage 
H03 147 disposal and composting<tf/>.<p/>
H03 148 <p_>Children should have the opportunity to make regular, 
H03 149 quantitative observations and keep records of the weather and the 
H03 150 seasons of the year. This should lead to a consideration of the 
H03 151 water cycle. They should also consider the role of climate on the 
H03 152 productivity of agriculture.<p/>
H03 153 <p_>Children should investigate natural materials (rocks, minerals, 
H03 154 soils), sort them by simple criteria and relate them to their uses 
H03 155 and origins. They should be aware of local distributions of some 
H03 156 types of natural materials (sands, soils, rocks). They should 
H03 157 observe, through fieldwork, how weather affects their surroundings 
H03 158 and how soil develops. They should also consider the major 
H03 159 geological events which change the surface of the Earth and the 
H03 160 evidence for these changes.<p/>
H03 161 <p_>Children should investigate changes that occur when familiar 
H03 162 substances are heated and cooled, and the concepts of 'hot' and 
H03 163 'cold' in relation to their body temperature. Through simple 
H03 164 investigations and by using secondary sources, children should 
H03 165 explore the range of fuels (energy sources) employed, their 
H03 166 origins, and their combustion products. They should find out about 
H03 167 the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources 
H03 168 and the implications of limited global resources for their economic 
H03 169 and efficient use. They should gradually be introduced to the idea 
H03 170 that energy is conserved.<p/>
H03 171 <p_>By making a series of observations children should be given the 
H03 172 opportunity to investigate changes in the night sky, in particular 
H03 173 the position of bright planets and the phases of the Moon. Using 
H03 174 simple equipment to track the path of the Sun and Moon they should 
H03 175 learn about the relative motions of the Earth, Moon and Sun. 
H03 176 Children should use this knowledge and a simple model of the solar 
H03 177 system to explain phenomena such as day and night, year length, the 
H03 178 phases of the Moon, eclipses and the seasons in relation to the 
H03 179 altitude of the Sun.<p/>
H03 180 <p_>Children should work with a number of different everyday 
H03 181 materials grouping them according to their characteristics, 
H03 182 similarities and differences. Properties such as mass ('weight'), 
H03 183 volume, strength and hardness, flexibility, compressibility, and 
H03 184 solubility should be investigated and related to everyday uses of 
H03 185 the materials. They should recognise the properties which enable 
H03 186 classification of materials as solids, liquids or gases. Children 
H03 187 should test the acidity and alkalinity of aqueous solutions using 
H03 188 indicators, some of which may be extracted from plants, and they 
H03 189 should be introduced to the pH scale. They should investigate the 
H03 190 effect of mixing dilute acid and alkaline materials. Children 
H03 191 should know about the dangers associated with the use of some 
H03 192 everyday materials including hot oil, bleach, cleaning agents and 
H03 193 other household materials.<p/>
H03 194 <p_>Children should investigate the action of heat on everyday 
H03 195 materials including those such as baking powder, wood, bread and 
H03 196 clay which change permanently. They should explore the origins of a 
H03 197 range of materials in order to appreciate that some occur naturally 
H03 198 while many are made from raw materials. Children should explore 
H03 199 chemical changes in a number of everyday materials, such as mixing 
H03 200 Plaster of Paris, making concrete and firing clay. They should 
H03 201 explore simple techniques, including evaporation, filtration and 
H03 202 chromatography, for separating mixtures such as muddy water, sea 
H03 203 water, ink and food colourings. Children should investigate the 
H03 204 role of oxygen in combustion. They should have the opportunity to 
H03 205 write simple word equations to describe reactions.<p/>
H03 206 <p_>Children should be given opportunities to compare a limited 
H03 207 range of solids, liquids and gases, to recognise their 
H03 208 characteristics and explore ideas about matter in simple 
H03 209 particulate terms. Experiments on dissolving and evaporation should 
H03 210 lead to developing ideas about solutions and solubility.<p/>
H03 211 <p_>Children should investigate a variety of models which are 
H03 212 self-propelled or driven and in which energy can be stored, 
H03 213 involving motors, belts, levers and gears. They should experience 
H03 214 different types of forces and use measurements to compare the 
H03 215 effects of forces in the context of, for example, <tf_>bridge 
H03 216 building<tf/>. They should investigate the strength of a simple 
H03 217 structure. They should investigate the forces involved in floating 
H03 218 and sinking. They should explore friction and investigate the ways 
H03 219 in which the speed of a moving object can be changed by the 
H03 220 application of forces and the relationship between speed, distance 
H03 221 and time. This work should be set in everyday contexts, for 
H03 222 example, <tf_>road safety, transport (including cycling and 
H03 223 sailing), balancing systems and hydraulic mechanisms in model 
H03 224 making<tf/>.<p/>
H03 225 <p_>Children should have the opportunity to construct simple 
H03 226 circuits. They should investigate the effects of using different 
H03 227 components, of varying the flow of electricity in a circuit and the 
H03 228 heating and magnetic effects. They should record the construction 
H03 229 details of a circuit by drawings and diagrams. They should learn 
H03 230 about the dangers associated with the use of mains electricity and 
H03 231 know appropriate safety measures. They should investigate the 
H03 232 properties of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. They should 
H03 233 begin to investigate simple electronic circuits for measuring, 
H03 234 switching and control. Children should construct circuits which 
H03 235 illustrate AND, OR and NOT gates.<p/>
H03 236 <p_>Children should be made aware of the way sound is heard and can 
H03 237 travel through different materials. They should understand how 
H03 238 musical notes are made and the obtrusive nature of some sounds in 
H03 239 the environment.

H04   1 <#FLOB:H04\><h_><p_>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<p/><h/>
H04   2 <p_>Increasingly stringent demands on UK industry to reduce its 
H04   3 impact on the environment, usually result in the adoption of 
H04   4 end-of-pipe pollution abatement technology, which is low cost and 
H04   5 relatively simple to implement. DTI has, however, recognised that a 
H04   6 better, longer term solution may be to redesign industrial 
H04   7 processes such that they are inherently less polluting. This study 
H04   8 has reviewed the implications of these so called <tf_>cleaner 
H04   9 technologies<tf/> for certain UK sectors which have significant 
H04  10 environmental impact and are vulnerable to emerging and stringent 
H04  11 legislation.<p/>
H04  12 <p_>This study finds that there are many aspects of the 
H04  13 manufacturing process where industry could, in theory, implement 
H04  14 cleaner technologies and practices -ranging from the adoption of 
H04  15 environmentally oriented principles in plant and process design; 
H04  16 through the use of cleaner feedstocks and the better treatment of 
H04  17 waste streams; to fundamental redesign of reactions or processes 
H04  18 such that they produce less waste or use fewer raw materials. In 
H04  19 addition, certain basic technologies ('hub technologies') such as 
H04  20 membrane separation and photo(electro)chemistry, which have 
H04  21 potential for development as cleaner approaches in several of the 
H04  22 sectors considered, have been identified.<p/>
H04  23 <p_>Against this background, study findings indicate only moderate 
H04  24 levels of activity in the conscious development and adoption of 
H04  25 cleaner technologies by UK companies. This partly results from the 
H04  26 fact that forces such as legislation, the influence of customers 
H04  27 and public opinion, which demand environmental responsibility of 
H04  28 the part of industry, are permissive of end-of-pipe technologies. 
H04  29 Where activity in cleaner approaches has been found, the 
H04  30 environmental benefits are rarely either the motivating force 
H04  31 <tf_>or recognised<tf/> by the developer. The aim is usually to 
H04  32 reduce the costs associated with energy and raw materials use and 
H04  33 the disposal or treatment of wastes.<p/>
H04  34 <p_>The concept of cleaner technology is not widely known in UK 
H04  35 industry, particularly among the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises 
H04  36 (SMEs), nor is its potential to yield commercial benefits 
H04  37 recognised. Clarifying this image should be the first stage in 
H04  38 providing stimulus for the uptake of cleaner technologies by 
H04  39 industry. However, if cleaner approaches and the hub technologies, 
H04  40 in particular, are to be developed to provide real benefits to UK 
H04  41 industry, there is also a need to address the shortages of skills, 
H04  42 resources and facilities which always create barriers to the 
H04  43 adoption of unfamiliar technologies by the SMEs.<p/>
H04  44 <h_><p_>1. INTRODUCTION<p/><h/>
H04  45 <p_>The increasing demands on many process industries to reduce 
H04  46 their impact on the environment are frequently met by the 
H04  47 short-term solution of add-on end-of-pipe pollution abatement 
H04  48 technology. In many cases, this merely removes the pollution 
H04  49 substance from one waste stream and transfers it to another. A 
H04  50 longer term approach is to redesign the process such that it is 
H04  51 fundamentally less polluting -it is inherently, a <tf_>'cleaner 
H04  52 technology'<tf/>.<p/>
H04  53 <p_>The report of a recent study for the Department of Trade and 
H04  54 Industry -DTI ('A Review Of Cleaner Technology Projects Supported 
H04  55 By UK Government Departments' by the National Engineering 
H04  56 Laboratory and Warren Spring Laboratory) gives the narrowest 
H04  57 definition of cleaner technology as <tf_>no waste technology<tf/>. 
H04  58 More practically, the technologies which today fall into this 
H04  59 definition are those which are less polluting in terms of the 
H04  60 energy and raw materials used, the emissions from the production 
H04  61 processes involved and the environmental impact of the resultant 
H04  62 products during and after use.<p/>
H04  63 <p_>As environmental issues gain in importance at national and 
H04  64 global levels and increasingly stringent controls are placed on the 
H04  65 polluting activities of many long established industries, cleaner 
H04  66 technologies will have clear long term strategic value both to 
H04  67 companies and to the overall competitive position of individual 
H04  68 countries. In the UK, the Government has been encouraging the 
H04  69 development of cleaner technology solutions to environmental 
H04  70 problems for some years. One of the aims of the Department of the 
H04  71 Environment's (DOE) Environmental Protection Technology scheme, 
H04  72 launched in 1988, was to promote cleaner technology. Within this 
H04  73 scheme, a handbook giving examples of cleaner technology in a wide 
H04  74 range of industries was published in 1989 and grant-aid was 
H04  75 provided to encourage technical innovation in the area of 
H04  76 environmental protection generally. This scheme has now been 
H04  77 broadened with the involvement of the DTI into the Environmental 
H04  78 Technology Innovation Scheme (ETIS). While the DOE will continue to 
H04  79 support new technologies which meet a requirement for environmental 
H04  80 improvements in specific priority areas, DTI will address research 
H04  81 into innovative technologies across the whole range of 
H04  82 environmental problems.<p/>
H04  83 <p_>Responsibility for encouraging and assisting the development 
H04  84 and diffusion of cleaner technologies in UK industry rests with the 
H04  85 Environmental Unit of DTI. In doing so, the Unit aims to focus its 
H04  86 efforts on sectors and processes where the need is most 
H04  87 <}_><-|>accute<+|>acute<}/> and where greatest scope exists for the 
H04  88 development of cleaner technology approaches.<p/>
H04  89 <p_>PA Consulting Group was therefore asked to undertake a study to 
H04  90 review the work being undertaken by industry in the area of cleaner 
H04  91 technology, the relevance of this work to the key environmental 
H04  92 problems and the potential barriers to its uptake and diffusion. 
H04  93 The study itself lasted for 6 months and employed a total team of 
H04  94 20 consultants on a full or part-time basis. Representatives of 44 
H04  95 research organisations and Higher Education Institutes, 80 
H04  96 companies and 30 Trade Associations were interviewed during the 
H04  97 course of the work undertaken, which reviewed activity taking place 
H04  98 worldwide, covering a wide range of technologies and sectoral 
H04  99 issues. Each of the various agencies responsible for the 
H04 100 implementation of national environmental policies in the most 
H04 101 advanced countries has also been contacted and information obtained 
H04 102 about relevant initiatives, studies and legislation through a 
H04 103 series of 53 interviews. This work has been supported by an 
H04 104 extensive review of available literature. (See appendix I). This 
H04 105 report sets out the specific objectives and scope of the work 
H04 106 undertaken, the methods used to address them, study findings and 
H04 107 conclusions.<p/>
H04 108 <h_><p_>4. CLEANER TECHNOLOGY<p/><h/>
H04 109 <p_>Cleaner technologies have long been recognised by institutions 
H04 110 as the best long term response to the damage inflicted by industry 
H04 111 on the environment. They are defined at the most stringent level as 
H04 112 'no waste technologies', but more practicably are recognised as 
H04 113 'low waste technologies'.<p/>
H04 114 <p_>In the context of this study, 'cleaner' or 'low waste 
H04 115 technologies' are taken to mean technologies which are inherently 
H04 116 less polluting in terms of energy and raw materials usage, 
H04 117 emissions (including wastes) from the production processes involved 
H04 118 and the environmental impact of the resultant products and services 
H04 119 during and after use. As such they are distinct from the more 
H04 120 commonly available end-of-pipe technologies which concentrate on 
H04 121 the treatment of wastes produced, rather than on minimising the 
H04 122 production of waste at source. Cleaner technologies will, by 
H04 123 definition, generally involve major changes to the industrial 
H04 124 processes responsible for causing pollution themselves.<p/>
H04 125 <p_>In terms of the overall manufacturing process, the distinction 
H04 126 between the area of application of cleaner technologies and the of 
H04 127 end-of-pipe technologies is sometimes blurred, as is shown 
H04 128 schematically in Figure 4.1. As it applies to the reduced use of 
H04 129 raw materials or energy, or to fundamental process changes to 
H04 130 reduce waste production, the scope of definition of cleaner 
H04 131 technology is clear. However, an area of overlap exists in its 
H04 132 relevance to the <tf|>handling of wastes which are produced. Wastes 
H04 133 can be re-used, recycled, treated, detoxified or disposed. 
H04 134 Recycling and re-use are theoretically means of reducing raw 
H04 135 materials or energy use and as such have relevance within the 
H04 136 concept of cleaner technology -although by some definitions they 
H04 137 are end-of-pipe technologies. For the purposes of this study, the 
H04 138 search for 'cleaner technologies' has included recycling where the 
H04 139 product which is recovered and/or treated is re-used within the 
H04 140 same process from which it was derived. The treatment of wastes and 
H04 141 their use as feedstocks in different processes has largely been 
H04 142 excluded.<p/>
H04 143 <p_>Awareness of the deleterious effect of industry on the 
H04 144 environment has existed at a high level for over a decade 
H04 145 worldwide. However, the focus on 'cleaner technology' as a partial 
H04 146 solution to these problems is a relatively recent development and 
H04 147 there is only a limited amount of published information currently 
H04 148 available which deals with this subject.<p/>
H04 149 <p_>Today, the majority of countries in the developed world have 
H04 150 recognised the importance of the concept of waste minimisation. 
H04 151 Many have set in motion a series of initiatives designed to spread 
H04 152 awareness and information more widely and to support relevant 
H04 153 developments in this area. Two of the most advanced countries in 
H04 154 this respect are probably the Netherlands and the US, which in 
H04 155 addition to maintaining active support individually also cooperate 
H04 156 with each other significantly in this area. Key goals driving the 
H04 157 policies and mechanisms of the Netherlands in the area of cleaner 
H04 158 technology are:<p/>
H04 159 <p_>- the promotion of the development and demonstration of 
H04 160 economically feasible cleaner technologies<p/>
H04 161 <p_>- the promotion of the active transfer of knowledge on cleaner 
H04 162 technologies to potential users<p/>
H04 163 <p_>- the stimulation of cooperation in development.<p/>
H04 164 <p_>Similarly, in the US, the more recent emphasis on 'waste 
H04 165 reduction at source' rather than on waste treatment and disposal 
H04 166 technologies, is reflected in a shift in policies of the 
H04 167 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to encourage 'pollution 
H04 168 prevention'.<p/>
H04 169 <p_>There are a wide variety of EPA programmes currently in place 
H04 170 and directed towards this aim. Elsewhere France, Germany and the 
H04 171 Scandinavian countries have developed policies with similar aims. 
H04 172 In Denmark for instance, the government initiated a 3 year DKK90 
H04 173 million cleaner technology development programme which has now 
H04 174 evolved into the Cleaner Technology Action Plan for the country.<p/>
H04 175 <p_>The European Community currently supports cleaner technologies 
H04 176 through its research programme STEP and, in the past, through the 
H04 177 provision of part funding for demonstration projects under the ACE 
H04 178 scheme. The STEP programme allocates priorities to research 
H04 179 proposals in the order -cleaner technologies, recycling 
H04 180 technologies, end-of-pipe technologies, but its main thrust so far 
H04 181 has been to encourage reductions in the use of energy and raw 
H04 182 materials. In the environment area the EC has tended to bring in 
H04 183 fairly detailed and bureaucratic legislation. This is binding on 
H04 184 the member states and the extra administrative burden required 
H04 185 often falls on the regulatory authorities.<p/>
H04 186 <h_><p_>4.1 CLEANER TECHNOLOGY IN UK INDUSTRY<p/><h/>
H04 187 <p_>The sectors of interest for this study were defined in the 
H04 188 first instance as:<p/>
H04 189 <p_>- chemicals<p/>
H04 190 <p_>- agrochemical products<p/>
H04 191 <p_>- electrical/electronic engineering<p/>
H04 192 <p_>- metal manufacturing<p/>
H04 193 <p_>- metal finishing<p/>
H04 194 <p_>- textiles<p/>
H04 195 <p_>- man-made fibre production<p/>
H04 196 <p_>- food processing<p/>
H04 197 <p_>- non-metallic mineral products<p/>
H04 198 <p_>- paper and printing<p/>
H04 199 <p_>- leather<p/>
H04 200 <p_>- waste incineration<p/>
H04 201 <p_>- oil refining.<p/>
H04 202 <p_>Following analyses carried out in Phase I and described in 
H04 203 Section 3, two sectors -man<?_>-<?/>made fibre production and oil 
H04 204 refining were rejected and of the remainder, chemicals, 
H04 205 electrical/electronic engineering, metal manufacturing and metal 
H04 206 finishing were given priority.<p/>
H04 207 <p_>Prioritisation was decided on the basis of analyses of the 
H04 208 polluting potential, the vulnerability and importance of each 
H04 209 sector in the UK. Oil refining was rejected at this stage because 
H04 210 of the scale and success of effort which has already reduced its 
H04 211 polluting impact and because this sector tends to be dominated by 
H04 212 very large multinational organisations which generally fall outside 
H04 213 the sphere of influence of DTI. <tf_>Petrochemical manufacture<tf/> 
H04 214 is however an area where considerable environmental improvements 
H04 215 could be made and this has been included within the scope of the 
H04 216 work carried out on the chemicals sector. The man-made fibres 
H04 217 sector has similarly been excluded because the most polluting 
H04 218 activities of relevance also fall within the chemicals sector.<p/>
H04 219 <p_>Phase I analyses for the remaining sectors identified the most 
H04 220 polluting sub-sectors or activities within each sector and it is on 
H04 221 these areas that study reviews of cleaner technology have 
H04 222 focussed.<p/>
H04 223 <h_><p_>4.2 THE CHEMICALS SECTOR<p/>
H04 224 <p_>4.2.1 Background<p/><h/>
H04 225 <p_>The chemicals industry is one of the UK's major manufacturing 
H04 226 sectors, employing around 340,000 people. It is a hugely diverse 
H04 227 sector in terms of the number of products, processes and 
H04 228 technologies encompassed with its operations. There are for 
H04 229 instance more than 70,000 known chemicals worldwide and more than 
H04 230 100,000 processes. A further 1,000 new products are added each 
H04 231 year. These range in scale from 100,000's tonnes per annum for 
H04 232 commodity petrochemicals to production quantities measured in 
H04 233 milligrammes (mg) for high value complex chemicals such as 
H04 234 peptides. The value of the products similarly varies from as little 
H04 235 as pounds100/tonne to pounds1,000/mg.<p/>
H04 236 <p_>The main sub-sectors in the chemicals industry and their 
H04 237 relationship to each other are depicted in Figure 4.2.<p/>
H04 238 <h_><p_>4.2.2 Environmental Impact<p/><h/>
H04 239 <p_>Among all the sectors studied, the chemicals sector, in its 
H04 240 entirety, is probably the most polluting and also has considerable 
H04 241 pre-process (cradle) and post-process (grave) impacts (Figure 
H04 242 4.3).<p/>

H05   1 <#FLOB:H05\><h_><p_>Report by the Government Actuary on the drafts 
H05   2 of the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 1991 and the Social 
H05   3 Security (Contributions) (Re-rating) Order 1991<p/>
H05   4 <p_>CHRISTOPHER DAYKIN<p/>
H05   5 <p_>Government Actuary's Department<p/>
H05   6 <p_>February 1991<p/><h/>
H05   7 <p_>To: The Right Hon. ANTONY NEWTON, O.B.E., M.P., Secretary of 
H05   8 State for Social Security<p/>
H05   9 <p_>1. In accordance with Section 63(11) of the Social Security Act 
H05  10 1986 and Sections 121(1), 123(2) and 123A(6A) of the Social 
H05  11 Security Act 1975 I submit the following report on the likely 
H05  12 effect on the National Insurance Fund of the Social Security 
H05  13 Benefits Up-rating Order 1991 and the Social Security 
H05  14 (Contributions) (Re-rating) Order 1991. This report also takes 
H05  15 account of the proposed Social Security (Overlapping Benefits) 
H05  16 Amendment Regulations and the proposed Social Security 
H05  17 (Contributions) Amendment Regulations.<p/>
H05  18 <p_>2. Taken together, the Statutory Instruments provide for the 
H05  19 changes in benefit rates and contributions described below.<p/>
H05  20 <p_>3. <tf_>The Benefits Up-rating Order<tf/> alters the main 
H05  21 social security benefits payable from the National Insurance Fund 
H05  22 from dates in the week beginning 8 April 1991. The standard 
H05  23 flat-rate retirement and invalidity pensions will be increased by 
H05  24 pounds5.10 to pounds52.00 a week for a single person and by 
H05  25 pounds8.15 to pounds83.25 for a married couple, with a similar 
H05  26 increase of pounds5.10 a week for widows' pensions. Unemployment 
H05  27 benefit will be increased by pounds4.05 to pounds41.40 for a single 
H05  28 person and by pounds6.55 to pounds66.95 for a married couple. A 
H05  29 summary of the principal rates of benefit before and after the 
H05  30 changes is given in Appendix 1.<p/>
H05  31 <p_>4. As well as increasing flat-rate pensions, the <tf|>Order 
H05  32 increases by 10.9 per cent the earnings-related additional pensions 
H05  33 of retirement, widow and invalidity beneficiaries who qualified for 
H05  34 these pensions before 8 April 1990. This increase applies to 
H05  35 additional pensions before abatement for any guaranteed minimum 
H05  36 pensions paid from occupational pension schemes where the pensioner 
H05  37 has been contracted-out. However, where a guaranteed minimum 
H05  38 pension in payment includes an amount arising from earnings after 5 
H05  39 April 1988, such amount is required to be increased by 3 per cent 
H05  40 by the occupational scheme and the increase in additional pension 
H05  41 is correspondingly reduced.<p/>
H05  42 <p_>5. The <tf_>Contributions Order<tf/> alters certain 
H05  43 contribution rates and the earnings brackets for the different 
H05  44 rates of employers' contributions from the beginning of the 
H05  45 1991-1992 tax year. It has been assumed that the lower and upper 
H05  46 earnings limits will be altered by amending Regulations to pounds52 
H05  47 and pounds390 as announced. The changes to the Class 1 earnings 
H05  48 limits and earnings brackets, together with the changes to Class 2, 
H05  49 Class 3 and Class 4 limits and contributions, are shown in Appendix 
H05  50 2.<p/>
H05  51 <p_>6. The <tf|>Order also alters the Class 1 secondary rates of 
H05  52 contribution from the beginning of the 1991-92 tax year. The Class 
H05  53 1 primary rates of contribution are unchanged, as are the 
H05  54 allocations from the total rate to the National Health Service, 
H05  55 currently 1.05 per cent from employees and 0.9 per cent from 
H05  56 employers. The rates are shown in Appendix 3.<p/>
H05  57 <p_>7. The current Statutory Sick Pay Bill reduces from 1991-92 the 
H05  58 amount that employers can recover in respect of statutory sick pay 
H05  59 to 80% of the amount paid to employees. The Bill also abolishes the 
H05  60 additional compensation paid to employers in respect of their 
H05  61 liability on statutory sick pay. The financial effect of the Bill 
H05  62 is included in the estimates for 1991-92.<p/>
H05  63 <p_>8. <tf_>Table 1<tf/> shows estimates of income and outgo of the 
H05  64 National Insurance Fund for 1991-92 allowing for the proposed 
H05  65 changes in benefit rates and contributions on the basis of the 
H05  66 working assumptions described in paragraph 9 below. The latest 
H05  67 estimates for the current year 1990-91 are also shown for purposes 
H05  68 of comparison.<p/>
H05  69 <p_><O_>caption&table<O/><p/>
H05  70 <p_>9. The income from contributions and the expenditure on 
H05  71 benefits in the remainder of 1990-91 and in 1991-92 will depend 
H05  72 <tf_>inter alia<tf/> upon the level of unemployment and the rate of 
H05  73 increase of earnings. In accordance with the normal practice, 
H05  74 working assumptions have been given to me by the Government in 
H05  75 regard to these factors. The assumptions I have been instructed to 
H05  76 use for the purpose of the above estimates were set out in the 
H05  77 following terms in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Autumn 
H05  78 Statement:<p/>
H05  79 <p_>(i) the number of unemployed (Great Britain) averages 1.62 
H05  80 million in 1990-91 and 1.75 million in 1991-92;<p/>
H05  81 <p_>(ii) the increase in average earnings on a year earlier is 10 
H05  82 per cent in 1990-91 and 8 1/2 per cent in 1991-92. Figures for 
H05  83 settlements are of course lower than these earnings figures in both 
H05  84 years.<p/>
H05  85 <p_>10. The estimated surplus of pounds1826 million for 1990-91 may 
H05  86 be compared with the estimated deficit of pounds1726 million given 
H05  87 in my report on the Social Security (Contributions) (Re-rating) 
H05  88 Order 1990 (Cm 948).<p/>
H05  89 <p_>11. Subsequent to that report, the Social Security Act 1990 
H05  90 removed certain liabilities from the National Insurance Fund for 
H05  91 financial years from 1990-91 onwards. The Act provided for an 
H05  92 amount equal to the aggregate of all statutory sick pay and 
H05  93 statutory maternity pay paid by employers to be paid out of money 
H05  94 provided by Parliament to the National Insurance Fund, thus 
H05  95 offsetting the corresponding deductions from employers' 
H05  96 contributions to the Fund. The Act also provided for the cost of 
H05  97 industrial injuries benefits to be met out of money provided by 
H05  98 Parliament instead of from the National Insurance Fund. These 
H05  99 changes improved the financial position of the Fund by pounds1288 
H05 100 million and pounds574 million respectively and thus more than 
H05 101 eliminate the deficit shown in my previous report.<p/>
H05 102 <p_>12. I have been advised that the transfer of the balance of the 
H05 103 Redundancy Fund into the National Insurance Fund took place on 31 
H05 104 January 1991. The market value of the assets transferred is shown 
H05 105 in <tf_>Table 1.<tf/> Redundancy payments from the date of the 
H05 106 transfer are included in the estimates of benefit expenditure in 
H05 107 <tf_>Table 1<tf/> and are shown in detail in Appendix 4.<p/>
H05 108 <p_>13. Higher earnings and more contributors increase the 
H05 109 estimated contribution income in 1990-91 by some pounds340 million 
H05 110 and pounds450 million respectively whilst other miscellaneous 
H05 111 changes increase income by pounds70 million in aggregate.<p/>
H05 112 <p_>14. In addition to the effect of the removal of industrial 
H05 113 injuries benefits from the National Insurance Fund, referred to in 
H05 114 paragraph 11, estimated benefit expenditure is pounds571 million 
H05 115 lower than in Cm 948. Unemployment benefit is reduced by pounds161 
H05 116 million due to the lower average numbers unemployed now assumed and 
H05 117 to a lower proportion of the unemployed assumed to be entitled to 
H05 118 benefit. Retirement pension is pounds258 million lower due partly 
H05 119 to a reassessment of the distribution of benefit payment dates and 
H05 120 partly to recent statistics suggesting a smaller take-up of benefit 
H05 121 following the abolition of the earnings rule than was originally 
H05 122 estimated. Other changes, mainly in widows' benefits and invalidity 
H05 123 benefit, reduce estimated benefit expenditure by pounds152 million. 
H05 124 Taking account of all changes to benefit expenditure and increases 
H05 125 of pounds6 million in administration costs and pounds45 million in 
H05 126 parity transfers to Northern Ireland, the overall reduction in 
H05 127 outgo is pounds1094 million.<p/>
H05 128 <p_>15. As a result of the changes described in paragraphs 11 to 14 
H05 129 above and the consequently higher projected level of the Fund, 
H05 130 investment income is estimated to be pounds310 million more than 
H05 131 was shown in my previous report.<p/>
H05 132 <p_>16. The extra expenditure in 1991-92 as a result of the 
H05 133 increases in benefit rates from April 1991 is estimated to be 
H05 134 pounds3221 million. Particulars of the extra cost and of the 
H05 135 expenditure for individual benefits are given in Appendix 4.<p/>
H05 136 <p_>17. <tf_>Table 1<tf/> shows that total benefit expenditure is 
H05 137 estimated to increase by pounds4051 million between 1990-91 and 
H05 138 1991-92, i.e. pounds830 million in excess of the cost of the 
H05 139 uprating. Underlying the benefit estimates are increases in the 
H05 140 numbers of retirement and invalidity pensioners and unemployment 
H05 141 benefit recipients, though the number of widow pensioners is 
H05 142 expected to continue to decline. In addition the continuing 
H05 143 build-up in the numbers of retirement, invalidity and widow 
H05 144 pensioners qualifying for earnings-related additional pensions, as 
H05 145 well as the increasing average amounts of benefit to which they 
H05 146 will be entitled, increases expenditure by about pounds500 million 
H05 147 between the two years.<p/>
H05 148 <p_>18. The financial effects of the provisions in the 
H05 149 <tf_>Contributions Order<tf/> which change earnings brackets and 
H05 150 contribution rates and of the proposed Regulations changing 
H05 151 earnings limits are summarised in Appendix 5. The changes are 
H05 152 estimated to result in a decrease of pounds313 million in 
H05 153 contribution receipts attributable to the National Insurance Fund 
H05 154 and an increase of pounds10 million in the National Health Service 
H05 155 allocation.<p/>
H05 156 <p_>19. The current Statutory Sick Pay Bill reduces the amount of 
H05 157 statutory sick pay that employers recover by an estimated pounds162 
H05 158 million. It also abolishes the additional compensation to employers 
H05 159 thus increasing contribution income by an estimated pounds58 
H05 160 million. The increase in the lower rate of statutory sick pay 
H05 161 increases employers' recoveries from National Insurance 
H05 162 contributions by an estimated pounds9 million. The increase in the 
H05 163 earnings threshold for the higher rate of statutory sick pay is 
H05 164 estimated to reduce employers' recoveries by pounds20 million. The 
H05 165 increase in the rate of statutory maternity pay increases 
H05 166 employers' recoveries by an estimated pounds18 million. In 
H05 167 accordance with the Social Security Act 1990 as amended by the 
H05 168 Bill, an amount equal to the aggregate of statutory sick pay and 
H05 169 statutory maternity pay recovered by employers is payable from the 
H05 170 Consolidated Fund to the National Insurance Fund; in 1991-92 this 
H05 171 is estimated to amount to pounds1128 million.<p/>
H05 172 <p_>20. The reduction in contributions in respect of personal 
H05 173 pensions in 1991-92 consists of the standard contracted-out rebates 
H05 174 and the additional 2 per cent incentive relating to the year 
H05 175 1990-91. The number of personal pensions reached 4.1 million for 
H05 176 the United Kingdom by the end of 1989-90 of which 4 million relate 
H05 177 to Great Britain. It has been assumed that the number will grow 
H05 178 further to 4.4 million for Great Britain by the end of 1990-91. In 
H05 179 addition, it is assumed that 1 million members of contracted-out 
H05 180 schemes will be eligible for the 2 per cent incentive in 1990-91. 
H05 181 Details of the estimated amounts are given in Appendix 7.<p/>
H05 182 <p_>21. <tf_>Table 1<tf/> shows that the total yield of 
H05 183 contributions to the National Insurance Fund, after deductions in 
H05 184 respect of personal pensions, statutory sick pay and statutory 
H05 185 maternity pay, is estimated to increase by pounds2181 million 
H05 186 between 1990-91 and 1991-92. The higher yield in 1991-92 is mainly 
H05 187 due to the assumed increase in the general level of earnings offset 
H05 188 by a higher contribution reduction of some pounds400 million in 
H05 189 respect of personal pensions. Appendix 6 shows an analysis of the 
H05 190 estimated contribution income in 1991-92 by class of 
H05 191 contributor.<p/>
H05 192 <p_>22. If the average number unemployed in 1991-92 were to be 
H05 193 100,000 lower than has been assumed, and if this reduction were 
H05 194 matched by an equal rise in the number working, then it is 
H05 195 estimated that contribution income would be pounds130 million 
H05 196 higher and expenditure on unemployment benefit pounds65 million 
H05 197 lower. Similarly, if the average number unemployed were to be 
H05 198 100,000 higher, and the corresponding assumption made, then the 
H05 199 contribution income in 1991-92 would be pounds130 million lower and 
H05 200 expenditure would rise by pounds65 million.<p/>
H05 201 <p_>23. If the actual increase in earnings in 1990-91 or 1991-92 is 
H05 202 different from that assumed, then the 1991-92 contribution income 
H05 203 will change by the amounts shown in <tf_>Table 2.<tf/> These 
H05 204 figures show the sensitivity of the estimates to the assumptions 
H05 205 made regarding earnings changes.<p/>

H05 210 following proportions of the benefit expenditure during the 
H05 211 year:<p/>

H05 217 <p_>Under the terms of Section 97 of the Police and Criminal 
H05 218 Evidence Act 1984 (the Act), the Police Complaints Authority are 
H05 219 required to make a report to the Home Secretary each calendar year 
H05 220 on the discharge of our functions. We are also required under the 
H05 221 same section to keep under review the working of Sections 84 to 96

H06   1 <#FLOB:H06\><h_><p_>FIRST REPORT<p/>
H06   2 <p_>MICROWAVE OVENS<p/>
H06   3 <p_>The Agriculture Committee has agreed to the following 
H06   4 Report:<p/>
H06   5 <p_>I. INTRODUCTION<p/><h/>
H06   6 <p_>1. We announced our inquiry into the safety of microwave ovens 
H06   7 on 16 March 1990. We were concerned at the disclosure by the 
H06   8 Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), on 4 December 
H06   9 1989, that a sizeable proportion of microwave ovens had 'failed' a 
H06  10 standard test; we were also concerned at the manner in which that 
H06  11 disclosure was handled.<p/>
H06  12 <p_>2. As this was clearly not a food safety problem of the 
H06  13 greatest seriousness, we thought it was appropriate to allow MAFF 
H06  14 and the oven manufacturers time to respond to the events of 
H06  15 December 1989, and then to examine what steps they had taken to 
H06  16 protect the consumer interest.<p/>
H06  17 <p_>3. We have taken evidence from the Government, from the 
H06  18 manufacturers' trade association and from bodies representing 
H06  19 consumers and food retailers and manufacturers. A full list of the 
H06  20 oral and written evidence can be found between pages iv and vi 
H06  21 above.<p/>
H06  22 <p_>4. We acknowledge our debt to our specialist adviser, Mr Harry 
H06  23 Barber, Senior Lecturer in Electronics and Electrical Engineering 
H06  24 at Loughborough University of Technology, in helping us to 
H06  25 understand a sometimes complex subject.<p/>
H06  26 <h_><p_>II. THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM<p/><h/>
H06  27 <p_>5. In themselves, microwave ovens are a safe, convenient and 
H06  28 increasingly popular feature of the modern kitchen. There are about 
H06  29 11 million ovens in domestic use in the United Kingdom and <tf_>no 
H06  30 food poisoning cases have been specifically associated with 
H06  31 them<tf/>. It is well known, however, that there is a relationship 
H06  32 between food safety and good kitchen practice and that pathogenic 
H06  33 micro-organisms present in food can be destroyed if the food is 
H06  34 properly cooked - or not destroyed if it is not. The correct use of 
H06  35 microwave ovens therefore stands on a par with the correct use of 
H06  36 conventional ovens, with one or two significant differences.<p/>
H06  37 <p_>6. With conventional cooking, the heat is transferred through 
H06  38 the surface of the food and is then conducted through the bulk of 
H06  39 the material. the surface temperature cannot be too high, otherwise 
H06  40 the food is burnt, and the whole process takes a considerable time. 
H06  41 long enough for temperature equalisation to take place within the 
H06  42 product. The emphasis is on warming the food to an acceptable 
H06  43 eating temperature and the bacteria are eliminated as an incidental 
H06  44 part of the process. In microwave heating, the electromagnetic 
H06  45 energy is transferred into the body of the product. This rate is 
H06  46 also affected by the position of the product within the oven 
H06  47 cavity, by the characteristics of the oven and by the geometry and 
H06  48 layout of different food items in the package. The inevitable 
H06  49 result is selective heating. The temperature will again equalise 
H06  50 over a period of time but the heating process is much more rapid 
H06  51 and the margin of error between satisfactory heating and 
H06  52 overcooking is therefore much narrower. Hence it is important that 
H06  53 the process be carried out accurately.<p/>
H06  54 <p_>7. A particular fear relating to microwave ovens was raises by 
H06  55 the Chief Medical Officer when he described as <quote_>"plausible, 
H06  56 but unproven"<quote/> the theory that the recent growth in 
H06  57 listeriosis figures was related to the proliferation of 
H06  58 <quote_>"cook-chill meals"<quote/> Cook-chill meals themselves are 
H06  59 prepared in rigorously hygienic conditions, but special problems 
H06  60 might arise if they were stored for too long or at the wrong 
H06  61 temperature. Poor kitchen hygiene might also lead to 
H06  62 micro-organisms being present in some of the 'do-it-yourself' 
H06  63 dishes people put in microwaves. We should emphasise that these are 
H06  64 largely hypothetical problems and that <tf_>efforts to improve the 
H06  65 performance of microwave ovens should be regarded as sensible 
H06  66 precautionary measures rather than a direct response to actual 
H06  67 lapses in food safety standards.<tf/><p/>
H06  68 <p_>8. In this precautionary spirit, MAFF set up a Microwave 
H06  69 Working Party in June 1989, bringing together key bodies (oven 
H06  70 manufacturers, food manufacturers and retailers and consumer 
H06  71 organisations) in <quote_>"a forum for sharing expertise and 
H06  72 developing co-ordinated responses to emerging scientific data on 
H06  73 the performances of microwave ovens"<quote/>. It was, in some 
H06  74 respects, an uneasy coalition of interests and it came unstuck in 
H06  75 acrimonious circumstances a few months later; but we believe that 
H06  76 MAFF's efforts to approach the problems on a collaborative basis 
H06  77 were well founded and we are satisfied that the Working Party is 
H06  78 continuing to play a useful role.<p/>
H06  79 <h_><p_>III. COOKING FOOD TO A SAFE TEMPERATURE<p/><h/>
H06  80 <p_>9. To cook food properly calls for different techniques 
H06  81 depending on what food is involved, but DHSS guidelines stipulate 
H06  82 that, for pathogenic organisms to be destroyed, <tf_>food should be 
H06  83 heated to a minimum of 70<*_>degree<*/>C for two minutes<tf/>. 
H06  84 These figures should not be set in tablets of stone. A higher 
H06  85 temperature for a shorter time or a lower temperature for a longer 
H06  86 time would yield the same result. Nor should the practical 
H06  87 realities of kitchen life be forgotten. How many cooks work with a 
H06  88 thermometer in one hand and a stop-watch in the other? But this 
H06  89 time-temperature profile provides a valuable bench-mark against 
H06  90 which the performance of microwave ovens can be judged.<p/>
H06  91 <p_>10. In the tests undertaken by the Institute of Food Research 
H06  92 of the Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC) which sparked 
H06  93 the controversy of December 1989, a standard amount of energy was 
H06  94 applied to a standard amount of mashed potato in 70 different 
H06  95 models of microwave oven<&|>sic!. In 24 of the models, the lowest 
H06  96 temperature found in the mashed potato after heating was below the 
H06  97 critical temperature of 70<*_>degree<*/>C.<p/>
H06  98 <p_>11. MAFF has been at pains to point out that the object of the 
H06  99 research was <quote_>"to determine the extent of <tf|>variability 
H06 100 of performance in a wide range of ovens, not to test the adequacy 
H06 101 of any particular model"<quote/>. The mashed potato was not stirred 
H06 102 or specially positioned as it would have been by a cook in the 
H06 103 kitchen working to the manufacturer's instructions; and it is very 
H06 104 likely that, if some different test had been selected, different 
H06 105 ovens would have performed differently. In MAFF's words:<p/>
H06 106 <p_><quote_>"Ovens were not judged to have 'passed' or 'failed' and 
H06 107 attempts to use the results in this way are based on a 
H06 108 misunderstanding of the nature of the research".<quote/><p/>
H06 109 <p_>12. We accept this statement - although we would add that MAFF 
H06 110 greatly contributed to the public misunderstanding of the situation 
H06 111 by the clumsy way in which they published the research. We return 
H06 112 to this point later.<p/>
H06 113 <p_>13. The research, then, did not demonstrate the existence of 
H06 114 millions of unsafe microwave ovens. <tf_>Every functioning 
H06 115 microwave oven is capable of cooking food to a safe 
H06 116 temperature<tf/>, just as every functioning car is capable of 
H06 117 getting from London to Birmingham. What it did highlight is the 
H06 118 fact that these aids to fast, convenient food are not quite as 
H06 119 trustworthy or as simple to operate as is popularly supposed. They 
H06 120 vary slightly from model to model. They need to be accompanied by 
H06 121 accurate manufacturer's instructions and similarly accurate 
H06 122 instructions must accompany any prepackaged convenience foods which 
H06 123 they are used to heat. How far these two conditions can be 
H06 124 satisfied was one of the issues we had to address.<p/>
H06 125 <h_><p_>IV. STANDARDISATION<p/><h/>
H06 126 <p_>14. There are currently some 799 models of microwave oven in 
H06 127 use in the UK, some old, some new, some incorporating a turntable, 
H06 128 some not, each configured slightly differently and each competing 
H06 129 in a fast growing market. The difficulties of achieving uniform 
H06 130 standards from such a diverse range of equipment will be 
H06 131 self-evident.<p/>
H06 132 <p_>15. Until 1 September 1990, there was no standardisation of the 
H06 133 declared power output of these ovens. This meant that two different 
H06 134 650-watt ovens might heat food to different temperatures, which 
H06 135 made meaningful food labelling instructions extremely difficult. 
H06 136 Since 1 September 1990 - in response, in part, to the furore of 
H06 137 December 1989 - new models of microwave oven will be rated for 
H06 138 power output according to a single method, the International 
H06 139 Standard IEC 705. Both the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic 
H06 140 Electrical Appliances (AMDEA) and non-AMDEA oven manufacturers have 
H06 141 been persuaded to join the IEC 705 power rating system. We welcome 
H06 142 these developments. they represent a positive step in the right 
H06 143 direction, if not a definitive solution to the problem.<p/>
H06 144 <p_>16. As witnesses were quick to point out, the IEC 705 standard 
H06 145 is anything but perfect. It is based on heating a one-litre water 
H06 146 load, which is practically the last thing anyone would put in a 
H06 147 microwave oven, and calibrates power output rather than testing 
H06 148 temperature measurements in food and their conformity with safety 
H06 149 standards. The methodology behind it is therefore fundamentally 
H06 150 different from the methodology used in the AFRC tests referred to 
H06 151 in the previous section, which was based on re-heating rather than 
H06 152 heating and was a closer simulation of the tasks microwave ovens 
H06 153 are most frequently used to perform.<p/>
H06 154 <p_>17. Other difficulties to which IEC 705 gives rise are:<p/>
H06 155 <p_>(i) it includes no pass or fail criteria;<p/>
H06 156 <p_>(ii) it is an international standard and can only be modified 
H06 157 after extensive international consultations;<p/>
H06 158 <p_>(iii) there are fundamental problems in applying it to models 
H06 159 sold before 1 September 1990.<p/>
H06 160 <p_>18. The IEC 705 standard does, nevertheless, enable important 
H06 161 progress to be made. The declared power output of new domestic 
H06 162 microwave ovens can be measured against that standard and the ovens 
H06 163 'banded' accordingly. MAFF proposed, when announcing the adoption 
H06 164 of the IEC 705 standard on 7 August, that the spectrum of IEC 
H06 165 wattages between 425 and 875 watts should be divided into five 
H06 166 numbered categories - all bands but the first being 75 watts wide. 
H06 167 Research carried out by the industry indicates that these bands may 
H06 168 be too wide, while the Retail Consortium and others wanted to see 
H06 169 fewer bands; discussions are still in progress to determine what is 
H06 170 the optimum number. But the existence of agreed and standardised 
H06 171 bands should make the next hurdle easier, which is labelling food 
H06 172 properly.<p/>
H06 173 <p_>19. In theory, once a microwave oven had been banded 2, say, it 
H06 174 would then be possible for cook-chill meals to carry instructions 
H06 175 indicating how long to cook them in an oven of that type. Simple 
H06 176 numbering systems work well in the case of other domestic 
H06 177 appliances like washing-machines and we believe they would prove 
H06 178 attractive to the consumer in this instance. The National Consumer 
H06 179 Council maintained that <quote_>"microwave labelling instructions 
H06 180 to consumers have improved since December 1989, but there is still 
H06 181 considerable confusion"<quote/>. We agree with this assessment.<p/>
H06 182 <h_><p_>VII. MAFF'S PERFORMANCE<p/><h/>
H06 183 <p_>35. We referred earlier to MAFF's clumsy handling of the 
H06 184 publicity given to the AFRC's research in December 1989. Although 
H06 185 we do not wish to dwell on mistakes made so long ago, there are 
H06 186 clear lessons to be learnt from that experience.<p/>
H06 187 <p_>36. Details of what took place can be found in our evidence. 
H06 188 The AFRC research was undertaken at the behest of a MAFF working 
H06 189 party which contained both oven manufacturers and consumer groups. 
H06 190 As the research entailed testing a large number of microwave ovens, 
H06 191 the AFRC borrowed these from manufacturers, rather than purchasing 
H06 192 them, and MAFF agreed not to name the models used in its eventual 
H06 193 report. It was felt that such an arrangement would save money 
H06 194 without giving unnecessary hostages to fortune. As far as the AFRC 
H06 195 was concerned, the object of the tests was to measure variability 
H06 196 and not assess the efficiency of individual models.<p/>
H06 197 <p_>37. The best laid plans can come unstuck, and this was not a 
H06 198 best laid plan. When the Minister of Agriculture received the AFRC 
H06 199 report, with its apparently damning evidence of erratic performance 
H06 200 by microwave ovens, he was placed under immediate pressure from the 
H06 201 Consumers' Association, who threatened to disclose the report's 
H06 202 findings unless MAFF did so itself. The Minister accordingly 
H06 203 published the report on the day he received it without, for the 
H06 204 contractual reasons referred to in the last paragraph, naming the 
H06 205 ovens used in the study. There followed an undignified 48-hour 
H06 206 hiatus while the Minister withheld the names of the models which 
H06 207 had 'failed' the AFRC test until the manufacturers concerned had 
H06 208 prepared supplementary instructions for those using their ovens. In 
H06 209 the resulting confusion, the seriousness of the threat to food 
H06 210 safety was greatly exaggerated by the media, as could have been 
H06 211 expected.<p/>
H06 212 
H06 213 
H07   1 <#FLOB:H07\>The main changes are described in paragraphs 4 to 13 
H07   2 below.<p/>
H07   3 <h_><p_>Calculation of affordable loan<p/><h/>
H07   4 <p_>4. DOE Circular 12/90 indicated that the 'loan generation 
H07   5 factor' used to calculate the notional 'affordable loan', which 
H07   6 represents the amount by which grant is reduced, would be uprated 
H07   7 to reflect changes in the standard national rate. Regulation 2(5) 
H07   8 accordingly amends Regulation 10 of the principal regulations by 
H07   9 substituting a new factor of 53.35 for owner-occupiers and of 35.37 
H07  10 for tenants.<p/>
H07  11 <h_><p_>Allowances and premiums<p/><h/>
H07  12 <p_>5. All the allowances and premiums set out in Schedule 1 to the 
H07  13 principal regulations are amended to provide an increase in line 
H07  14 with the annual 'Rossi Index' which is applied for the purpose of 
H07  15 uprating housing benefit, community charge bendefit and income 
H07  16 support. The relevant amendments are contained in Regulation 2. The 
H07  17 increased allowances and premiums are reproduced at Annex A to this 
H07  18 Circular.<p/>
H07  19 <p_>6. Regulation 2(13)(d)(vii) also introduces a new premium: the 
H07  20 carer premium. This is available either where a relevant person 
H07  21 and/or his partner is in receipt of invalid care allowance or where 
H07  22 either or both would have been in receipt of that allowance but for 
H07  23 an overlapping benefit. Overlapping benefits include injury 
H07  24 benefit, unemployability supplement, industrial death benefit, war 
H07  25 pension death benefit and training allowance (see the Social 
H07  26 Security (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations 1979 (SI 1979 No.597). 
H07  27 In the latter case the claim for invalid care allowance must have 
H07  28 been made on or after 1 May 1991 and the person in respect of whose 
H07  29 care the allowance has been claimed must be in receipt of 
H07  30 attendance allowance. The new carer premium is pounds10.80 
H07  31 (Regulation 2(13)(f)).<p/>
H07  32 <p_>7. In addition to any relevant personal allowances and 
H07  33 premiums, all applicants are entitled to an additional 'grant 
H07  34 premium'. Regulation 2(4) amends Regulation 8 of the principal 
H07  35 regulations to increase the grant premium from pounds20 to 
H07  36 pounds22. The new figure is based on the increase in the Retail 
H07  37 Price Index over the same period as the Rossi Index on the basis of 
H07  38 which other allowances and premiums have been uprated.<p/>
H07  39 <p_>8. Authorities should note that these regulations introduce 
H07  40 amendments to Schedule 1 of the principal regulations which make 
H07  41 disability premium available in a slightly different way from that 
H07  42 which obtains for housing benefit purposes. The amendments are 
H07  43 designed to reflect the fact that, whilst either member of a couple 
H07  44 may be the claimant for benefit, for grant purposes the applicant 
H07  45 must be a person having the requisite interest in the property 
H07  46 which is the subject of the grant application. Regulation 
H07  47 2(13)(d)(iii), (iv) and (vi) accordingly extends eligibility for 
H07  48 disability premium to cover circumstances where either the relevant 
H07  49 person <tf|>or his partner satisfies the conditions of paragraphs 
H07  50 11(b) and 12(1)(b) of Schedule 1 to the principal regulations. This 
H07  51 means that, where disability premium is allowed in respect of a 
H07  52 partner rather than the relevant person himself, it will also be 
H07  53 available where that partner falls within the rules governing long 
H07  54 term incapacity for work instead of being confined to circumstances 
H07  55 where the partner is in receipt of attendance allowance etc.<p/>
H07  56 <h_><p_>Disregards<p/><h/>
H07  57 <p_>9. The Regulations introduce a number of new or amended 
H07  58 disregards in line with recent changes to housing benefit rules. 
H07  59 These include:<p/>
H07  60 <p_>(i) an extension of the cross references in regulations 22(2) 
H07  61 and 24(2) of the principal regulations to include paragraph 12 of 
H07  62 Schedule 2 in order to ensure that bank charges and commission on 
H07  63 converting earnings paid in overseas currency are deducted in the 
H07  64 calculation of an employed person's earnings or a self-employed 
H07  65 person's net profit;<p/>
H07  66 <p_>(ii) an increase in the lone parent's earnings disregard from 
H07  67 pounds15 to pounds25 (this disregard applies also to lone parents 
H07  68 who are disabled or over 60 who would have qualified for lone 
H07  69 parent premium were a disability premium of one of the pensioner 
H07  70 premiums not applicabe);<p/>
H07  71 <p_>(iii) the introduction of new income and capital disregards in 
H07  72 respect of regular one-off assistance given towards expenditure on 
H07  73 National Health Services under the National Health Service 
H07  74 (Travelling Expenses and Remission of Charges) Regulations 1988 (SI 
H07  75 1988 No. 551) and its Scottish equivalent (as amended) and on 
H07  76 payments and repayments providing equivalent assistance (see 
H07  77 Regulation 2(15)(d) and (16)(g) which insert a new paragraph 44 and 
H07  78 a new paragraph 38 into Schedules 3 and 4);<p/>
H07  79 <p_>(iv) the introduction of new income and capital disregards in 
H07  80 respect of regular or one-off payments made in place of milk tokens 
H07  81 or the supply of vitamins under the Welfare Food Regulations 1988 
H07  82 (SI 1988 No. 536 as amended) and of any payments made by the 
H07  83 relevant Secretary of State under a scheme to assist relatives and 
H07  84 others with prison visits (new paragraphs 45 and 46 and 39 and 40 
H07  85 are inserted into Schedules 3 and 4 respectively of the principal 
H07  86 regulations by Regulation 2(15)(d) and (16)(g));<p/>
H07  87 <p_>(v) a total disregard of regular voluntary and charitable 
H07  88 payments other than those intended for food, ordinary clothing or 
H07  89 footwear, houshold fuel, eligible rent, community charges or water 
H07  90 charges, all of which payments continue to be eligible for a weekly 
H07  91 disregard of pounds10 subject to an overriding pounds10 limit (see 
H07  92 the new paragraph 13 of Schedule 3 to the principal regulations 
H07  93 substituted by Regulation 2(15)(b));<p/>
H07  94 <p_>(vi) an amendment to the disregard provided in paragraph 5(a) 
H07  95 of Schedule 4 to the principal regulations in respect of property 
H07  96 occupied by relatives to ensure that this disregard operates in 
H07  97 relation to a single relevant person as well as to relevant persons 
H07  98 who are members of a family (Regulation 2(16)(a));<p/>
H07  99 <p_>(vii) a disregard of the assets of a business where a 
H07 100 self-employed relevant person has ceased to trade because of 
H07 101 illness or injury but intends to return to that business as soon as 
H07 102 possible (a new sub<?_>-<?/>paragraph (2) to paragraph 8 of 
H07 103 Schedule 4 is added by Regulation 2(16)(b));<p/>
H07 104 <p_>(viii) a total disregard of trust funds (and the value of the 
H07 105 right to receive any payment under the trust) where the funds are 
H07 106 derived from a payment made in consequence of personal injury to a 
H07 107 relevant person except where the value represents funds for 
H07 108 carrying out works which are the subject of the application for 
H07 109 grant (Regulation 2(16)(c) which substitutes a new paragraph 14 in 
H07 110 Schedule 4 to the principal regulations);<p/>
H07 111 <p_>(ix) a total disregard of any arrears of special war widows' 
H07 112 payments which fall to be disregarded under paragraph 42 of 
H07 113 Schedule 3 to the principal regulations (see new paragraph 37 
H07 114 inserted by Regulation 2(16)(g));<p/>
H07 115 <p_>(x) the amendment of the capital disregard contained in 
H07 116 paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the principal regulations to ensure 
H07 117 that the value of the right to receive earnings payable in a 
H07 118 country outside the United Kingdom but on which there is a ban on 
H07 119 transfer of those earnings to the United Kingdom is treated in the 
H07 120 same way as the value of the right to receive other income from 
H07 121 such a country (see Regulation 2(16)(d)).<p/>
H07 122 <h_><p_>Students<p/><h/>
H07 123 <p_>10. The Regulations also contain amendments relevant to the 
H07 124 calculation of students' income designed to take into account the 
H07 125 availability of student loans under the Education (Student Loans) 
H07 126 Act 1990 or the Education (Student Loans) (Northern Ireland) Order 
H07 127 1990 and of Access Fund payments made under the provisions of the 
H07 128 Education (Further and Higher Education Institutes) (Access Funds) 
H07 129 Regulations 1990. In particular, Regulation 2(12)(c) inserts a new 
H07 130 regulation 42A to cover the treatment of student loans. Authorities 
H07 131 should note that not only is any loan actually made to be treated 
H07 132 as income but in addition any loan for which a student is eligible 
H07 133 in accordance with arrangements made under the 1990 Act or Order is 
H07 134 treated as income even though the student may not have acquired the 
H07 135 loan. For this purpose a student is deemed to be in possession of 
H07 136 the maximum loan which would be payable. By virtue of Regulation 19 
H07 137 of the principal regulations, student loans fall to be apportioned 
H07 138 on a weekly basis thus ensuring that the disregards operate in 
H07 139 relation to average weekly income rather than in relation to the 
H07 140 lump sum paid.<p/>
H07 141 <p_>11. Regulation 2(15)(c) provides for an additional disregard of 
H07 142 pounds10 per week in respect of student loan income. This means 
H07 143 that in many cases student loan income or notional income will be 
H07 144 entirely disregarded. Authorities should note, however, that 
H07 145 regular Access Fund payments are to be treated in the same way as 
H07 146 voluntary payments. The disregard mentioned in paragraph 9(v) above 
H07 147 will therefore apply in respect of such payments. Where a 
H07 148 combination of student loan income and income from Access Fund 
H07 149 payments exceeds pounds10 per week the provisions of paragraph 33 
H07 150 of Schedule 3 to the principal regulations will have the effect of 
H07 151 limiting the total disregard to pounds10.<p/>
H07 152 <p_>12. There are two other amendments which affect the calculation 
H07 153 of student income. Regulation 2(12)(a) amends the definition of 
H07 154 grant to exclude hardship payments paid to students under section 
H07 155 100 of the Education Act 1944, sections 131 and 132 of the 
H07 156 Education Reform Act 1988 or section 73 of the Education (Scotland) 
H07 157 Act 1980. Such payments are therefore not taken into account as 
H07 158 part of grant income. In addition Regulation 2(12)(b) increases the 
H07 159 sum to be excluded from the calculation of grant income in respect 
H07 160 of books and equipment from pounds234 to pounds246.<p/>
H07 161 <h_><p_>Miscellaneous<p/><h/>
H07 162 <p_>13. There are also a number of minor amendments of which 
H07 163 authorities will wish to be aware. Regulation 2(3) amends the 
H07 164 definition of non-dependant to exclude not only a relevant person's 
H07 165 landlord/landlady as before but also any members of the 
H07 166 landlord's/landlady's family who may be living in the dwelling 
H07 167 concerned. Regulation 2(10) and (11) introduces amendments to the 
H07 168 provisions on notional income and capital (Regulations 28 and 35 of 
H07 169 the principal regulations) designed to ensure that payments for 
H07 170 water charges made to a third party on behalf of a relevant person 
H07 171 are counted as part of that person's income or capital in the same 
H07 172 way as payments to third parties in respect of food etc. are 
H07 173 counted. For the purpose of these provisions a definition of 'water 
H07 174 charges' is inserted in Regulation 2 of the principal regulations. 
H07 175 Regulation 16 of the principal regulations is amended to make it 
H07 176 plain that 'income' includes capital treated as income, notional 
H07 177 income and acutal or notional income derived from student loans 
H07 178 (see Regulation2(6)). Finally, the provisions of the Enterprise and 
H07 179 New Towns (Scotland) Act 1990, which establishes two new bodies 
H07 180 responsible for training policies and practice, are reflected by 
H07 181 the inclusion of a reference to that Act in those places where 
H07 182 there are references to the Employment and Training Act 1973 which 
H07 183 is no longer relevant in Scotland in relation to certain training 
H07 184 powers.<p/>
H07 185 <h_><p_>The Housing Renovation etc. Grants (Prescribed Forms and 
H07 186 Particulars) (Amendment) Regulations 1991<p/><h/>
H07 187 <p_>14. These regulations make some minor amendments to the 
H07 188 prescribed forms used when applying for grant. The amendments to 
H07 189 the forms used in connection with applications for renovation, 
H07 190 disabled facilities and common parts grants (Forms 1 to 3) are 
H07 191 necessary to reflect the amendments discussed in paragraphs 3 to 
H07 192 13. The amendments to Form 4 (application for HMO grant) correct 
H07 193 errors in questions 2.9 and 2.11 which result in the applicant 
H07 194 being guided to the wrong question (see Regulation 2(10) and 
H07 195 (11)).<p/>
H07 196 <p_>15. The main amendments are necessitated by the introduction of 
H07 197 the new carer premium mentioned in paragraph 6 above. This means 
H07 198 that authorities will need to have information about eligibility 
H07 199 for invalid care allowance. Since question 3.13 on Form 1 and its 
H07 200 equivalents on other forms are the main source of information for 
H07 201 assessing the 'applicable amount' a new question is inserted asking 
H07 202 about this allowance together with a new note, 30A, which advises 
H07 203 applicants to answer 'yes' where they would have been in receipt of 
H07 204 this allowance but for an overlapping benefit. Authorities should 
H07 205 note, however, that they may need to make some additional enquiries 
H07 206 to establish eligibility for carer premium where that eligibility 
H07 207 would depend on the circumstances covered in the new paragraph 
H07 208 14A(2) of Schedule 1 to the Housing Renovation etc. Grants 
H07 209 (Reduction of Grant) Regulations 1990.<p/>
H07 210 <p_>16. Question 3.38 on Form 1 and its equivalents on Forms 2 and 
H07 211 3 are amended to include a question about student loans.

H08   1 <#FLOB:H08\><h_><p_>INLAND REVENUE: PURPOSE AND AIMS<p/><h/>
H08   2 <p_>The following statement of the Inland Revenue's purpose and 
H08   3 aims cover all the work of the Department.<p/>
H08   4 <p_>The Inland Revenue is responsible, under the overall direction 
H08   5 of Ministers, for the administration of income tax, corporation 
H08   6 tax, capital gains tax, petroleum revenue tax, inheritance tax and 
H08   7 stamp duties; and valuation services for revenue and rating 
H08   8 purposes and for Government departments.<p/>
H08   9 <p_>Our purpose is:<p/>
H08  10 <p_>to collect the proper amount of tax due by law, and to value 
H08  11 property accurately<p/>
H08  12 <p_>to advise Ministers on policies for tax and valuation, and when 
H08  13 required to implement Government policies in those areas<p/>
H08  14 <p_>We are continually searching for new and better ways to do all 
H08  15 these things more economically, efficiently and effectively, to 
H08  16 improve our expertise, and to provide a fair and helpful service to 
H08  17 the public.<p/>
H08  18 <p_>In administering the tax system we will aim to:<p/>
H08  19 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>advise the public of their rights and duties<p/>
H08  20 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>treat people equally under the law<p/>
H08  21 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>encourage mutual trust and co-operation between 
H08  22 the Department and the public<p/>
H08  23 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>pursue tax which is properly due under 
H08  24 <}_><-|>the<+|><}/> the law<p/>
H08  25 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>deter and detect evasion<p/>
H08  26 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>value property to professional standards<p/>
H08  27 <p_>In advising Ministers on policy issues we will aim to consider 
H08  28 a range of factors including:<p/>
H08  29 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>estimated cost and yields<p/>
H08  30 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>social and economic considerations<p/>
H08  31 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>the contribution of tax and valuation proposals 
H08  32 to the Government's wider policies<p/>
H08  33 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>effects on compliance costs for taxpayers, and 
H08  34 our own costs<p/>
H08  35 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>scope for consultation with taxpayers and 
H08  36 representative bodies<p/>
H08  37 <p_>We will prepare and publish our overall plans and account fully 
H08  38 for our use of the resources provided by Parliament. We will, 
H08  39 whenever possible, set clear objectives, allocate responsibility to 
H08  40 staff for achieving them, and monitor progress and results.<p/>
H08  41 
H08  42 <h_><p_>HIGHLIGHTS OF 1990/91<p/><h/>
H08  43 <p_>This is our 133rd Annual Report to Parliament. It covers the 
H08  44 year ended 31 March 1991. It records the Department's activities 
H08  45 and performance during the year against the plans and targets we 
H08  46 set out in our Departmental Statement for 1990/91.<p/>
H08  47 <p_>The year began with detailed plans, agreed with Treasury 
H08  48 Ministers, for all the Department's operations, for introducing 
H08  49 independent taxation, and for continuing to implement our 
H08  50 strategies for compliance, information technology and staffing the 
H08  51 Department. Our Management Plan for 1990/91 to 1992/93, published 
H08  52 in February 1990, gave more information about this work. But the 
H08  53 Government's decision to abolish the composite rate tax on bank and 
H08  54 building society interest from 6 April 1991 added a new priority to 
H08  55 our previous plans, It meant we needed to review existing targets 
H08  56 and timetables and add new plans to implement this tax reform.<p/>
H08  57 <p_>The Inland Revenue ended 1990/91 with strong performance and 
H08  58 its operations although the downturn in the economy meant it was a 
H08  59 more difficult year for collection of tax debts. The Department 
H08  60 also made preparations for the abolition of composite rate tax and 
H08  61 other changes to the tax system, to improve and extend our service 
H08  62 to customers, and to reshape the way we organise and manage our 
H08  63 staff and work.<p/>
H08  64 <p_>We comment here on some of the highlights of the year.<p/>
H08  65 <h_><p_>CUSTOMER SERVICE<p/><h/>
H08  66 <p_>During 1990/91 we reviewed, as planned, our service to the 
H08  67 public. We published in February 1991, as part of our Next Steps 
H08  68 action plan, a new customer service plan.<p/>
H08  69 <p_>We have already implemented parts of it. A new version of the 
H08  70 Taxpayer's Charter was published in August 1991. We are 
H08  71 increasingly seeking taxpayer's views by means of customer surveys. 
H08  72 Better measures of performance are being piloted for introduction 
H08  73 in tax offices in 1992/93.<p/>
H08  74 <p_>These plans and initiatives are being developed as part of the 
H08  75 Government's initiatives for improving public services under the 
H08  76 Citizen's Charter. Collecting tax can never be a popular task, but 
H08  77 our aim has always been to carry it out accurately, courteously and 
H08  78 professionally. We owe a responsibility to our customers to give 
H08  79 them a high level of service. Good service also makes sense: we 
H08  80 believe that the highest level of voluntary compliance is achieved 
H08  81 by offering good service to all our customers.<p/>
H08  82 <h_><p_>ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION<p/><h/>
H08  83 <p_>The taxes for which we are responsible are assessed and 
H08  84 collected through the network of local tax and collection offices, 
H08  85 supported by the two Accounts Offices and the Enforcement Office, 
H08  86 and through the specialist offices which deal with claims, 
H08  87 inheritance tax, stamp duties, oil taxation, foreign dividends and 
H08  88 pension funds. In 1990/91 they handled the affair of over 30 
H08  89 million customers (individuals, partnerships, companies and 
H08  90 trusts).<p/>
H08  91 <p_>There were, as expected, further increases in the numbers of 
H08  92 customers we deal with. In particular we received a quarter of a 
H08  93 million more accounts from businesses than in 1989/90.<p/>
H08  94 <p_>Detailed objectives and targets for 1990/91 for the operations 
H08  95 of these offices were agreed and published in the Departmental 
H08  96 Statement last year.<p/>
H08  97 <p_>Offices generally achieved their targets for current work, and 
H08  98 for reducing backlogs, which are vital both for good service to 
H08  99 taxpayers and for the timely flow of tax revenue to the Exchequer. 
H08 100 Collection of tax debts fell short of some of the targets we agreed 
H08 101 last year, largely because of the economic downturn and general 
H08 102 credit conditions, but there was nevertheless, a further reduction 
H08 103 in the amount of tax still uncollected three months after the due 
H08 104 date for payment.<p/>
H08 105 <p_>We attached particular importance to offices keeping on top of 
H08 106 work in 1990/91 because of the changes they were implementing, or 
H08 107 preparing for, in the tax system. Ministers' decisions to introduce 
H08 108 independent taxation and to abolish the composite rate tax made the 
H08 109 tax system more evenhanded, but both changes add to the number of 
H08 110 separate individuals whose tax affairs we have to deal with 
H08 111 directly in one way or another.<p/>
H08 112 <h_><p_>INDEPENDENT TAXATION<p/><h/>
H08 113 <p_>We reported last year the successful completion of the very 
H08 114 large amount of work to prepare for the introduction of independent 
H08 115 taxation on 6 April 1990. But this was by no means the end of one 
H08 116 of the biggest changes since income tax was introduced. The 
H08 117 successful implementation of the new legislation was one of the 
H08 118 priorities we set for tax offices for 1990/91.<p/>
H08 119 <p_>During the year some three quarters of a million tax returns 
H08 120 were received from married women for the first time. All were 
H08 121 examined on time.<p/>
H08 122 <p_>Tax offices were also preparing in 1990/91 for the additional 
H08 123 repayment claims expected to follow independent taxation.<p/>
H08 124 <h_><p_>ABOLITION OF COMPOSITE RATE TAX<p/><h/>
H08 125 <p_>In his Budget speech on 20 March 1990 the then Chancellor of 
H08 126 the Exchequer, the right hon. John Major MP, announced that the 
H08 127 composite rate of tax on interest paid by banks and building 
H08 128 societies would be abolished from 6 April 1991.<p/>
H08 129 <p_>Ministers decided to implement the change by allowing 
H08 130 individual investors to claim payment of interest gross if they 
H08 131 could certify that they did not expect to be liable to tax on their 
H08 132 interest for the year. Others would receive interest after tax and 
H08 133 be entitled to reclaim any tax deducted in excess of their true 
H08 134 liability.<p/>
H08 135 <p_>This was one of the biggest changes in this part of the tax 
H08 136 system for many years, not only for the Department but also for the 
H08 137 financial institutions involved. In 1990/91 over 35 million people 
H08 138 in the United Kingdom (owning between them about 100 million 
H08 139 interest-bearing accounts) were liable to composite rate tax at 22 
H08 140 per cent. Of these over 15 million were either not liable or only 
H08 141 just liable to tax.<p/>
H08 142 <p_>Preparations for the abolition of composite rate tax became our 
H08 143 top priority for 1990/91. In order to meet Ministers' timetable we 
H08 144 had to:<p/>
H08 145 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>devise detailed procedures for deduction of tax 
H08 146 from interest and for enabling non-taxpayers to receive payments of 
H08 147 interest gross by means of a registration scheme<p/>
H08 148 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>publicise the new arrangements<p/>
H08 149 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>develop computer systems and working procedures 
H08 150 to support the new arrangements<p/>
H08 151 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>recruit and provide accommodation for the extra 
H08 152 staff required to run the new system<p/>
H08 153 <p_>Detailed plans for all these areas were drawn up and all of the 
H08 154 action required was completed by the end of the year.<p/>
H08 155 <p_>Extensive <tf|>consultations took place with the British 
H08 156 Bankers' Association and the Building Societies' Association.<p/>
H08 157 <p_>Inland Revenue staff staged 45 <tf|>roadshows in 42 different 
H08 158 towns throughout the country to explain the scheme to the people in 
H08 159 the high street branches of banks and building societies who will 
H08 160 be directly involved in operating it.<p/>
H08 161 <p_>With the help of market research we designed a simple 
H08 162 <tf_>registration form and explanatory leaflet.<tf/> The forms and 
H08 163 leaflets were stocked by the banks and building societies, and were 
H08 164 also sent to every home in the United Kingdom.<p/>
H08 165 <p_><tf_>Television and press advertising<tf/> was timed to 
H08 166 coincide with the delivery of the leaflet. Market research 
H08 167 indicated that by the end of the campaign awareness of the changes 
H08 168 had increased from 20 per cent to 60 per cent amongst those we were 
H08 169 aiming to reach.<p/>
H08 170 <p_>We opened in 1990/91, as planned, 15 of the 24 <tf_>new 
H08 171 offices<tf/> which will deal with the bulk of repayment claims and 
H08 172 recruited over 1,000 of the staff who will work in them.<p/>
H08 173 <p_>We developed and introduced a <tf_>computerised claims 
H08 174 repayment system<tf/> in January 1991. This system, which was 
H08 175 designed for existing claims and those generated by independent 
H08 176 taxation, will be adapted and extended to deal with the expected 
H08 177 increase in claims.<p/>
H08 178 <p_>The abolition of composite rate tax has given us opportunities, 
H08 179 to explore new and more effective ways of communicating with the 
H08 180 public and with the organisations that have to operate tax 
H08 181 procedures; to consider novel staffing arrangements; and to 
H08 182 investigate developments in new technology.<p/>
H08 183 <p_>Until we actually receive the claims next year, we cannot be 
H08 184 sure how many of those entitled to claim repayment of tax on bank 
H08 185 and building society interest will in practice do so, or how 
H08 186 quickly they will put in their claims after the beginning of the 
H08 187 new tax year. The margin of uncertainty is very great. For example, 
H08 188 if the number of people who actually claim is 10 per cent more or 
H08 189 less than the number that we have (with Ministers' authority) 
H08 190 assumed, that will make a difference of something like 
H08 191 three-quarters of a million claims for repayment of tax - 
H08 192 representing several hundreds more or less manyears of work. We 
H08 193 have therefore had to develop and keep up to date flexible 
H08 194 contingency plans for handling either more or fewer claims than 
H08 195 expected.<p/>
H08 196 <h_><p_>COMPLIANCE<p/><h/>
H08 197 <p_>While encouraging voluntary compliance by giving our customers 
H08 198 good service we also have a duty to detect and tackle those who, 
H08 199 either deliberately or through misunderstanding, do not comply with 
H08 200 their obligations, or do not do so fully. Our strategy for 
H08 201 detecting and tackling non-compliance requires an active Inland 
H08 202 Revenue presence in all parts of the tax system. The direct yield 
H08 203 from this work in 1990/91 was pounds3.9 billion, equivalent to the 
H08 204 yield from 2 pence on the basic rate of income tax. This was an 
H08 205 increase of 34% over results in 1989/90, and the largest figure yet 
H08 206 recorded.<p/>
H08 207 <h_><p_>RECEIPTS AND COSTS<p/><h/>
H08 208 <p_>In 1990/91 the Department registered total tax receipts of 
H08 209 pounds82.5 billion (against a forecast of pounds81.9 billion). We 
H08 210 also collected, on behalf of the Department of Social Security, 
H08 211 National Insurance contributions totalling pounds33.4 billion 
H08 212 (against a forecast of pounds33.1 billion).<p/>
H08 213 <p_>The costs of collecting this revenue were pounds1402.1 million 
H08 214 in 1990/91 (pounds1234.3 million in 1989/90). This total includes 
H08 215 pounds46 million (3.3%) for the new arrangements for taxing bank 
H08 216 and building society interest.<p/>
H08 217 <p_>The Department was funded for expenditure of pounds1,408.1 
H08 218 million, of which pounds1,3276.6 million was for our running 
H08 219 costs.<p/>
H08 220 <h_><p_>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY<p/><h/>
H08 221 <p_>The Department's dependence on, and investment in, information 
H08 222 technology (IT) continues to grow. Capital investment in the year 
H08 223 under review was some pounds58 million. The number of terminals in 
H08 224 use is now some 48,000, an increase of 8,000 since our last report. 
H08 225 By the end of 1993/94 it is expected to reach 67,000.<p/>
H08 226 <p_>During the year contracts were signed for a new 'strategic' 
H08 227 terminal which will improve the resilience of the taxes and 
H08 228 collection networks and meet the requirements for network offices 
H08 229 in the 1990s. The new terminal provides local processing power 
H08 230 which, when fully exploited, will be used for a range of functions, 
H08 231 including computer based training, on-line instructions, and office 
H08 232 automation, in addition to the basic work of local offices.

H09   1 <#FLOB:H09\><h_><p_>Licensed firearms<p/><h/>
H09   2 <p_>Due to concern at the cost of administering the firearms 
H09   3 licensing system, a multi-force scrutiny of the subject has been 
H09   4 conducted. Using this research a Joint Working Group involving 
H09   5 ACPO, the Home Office and the Inspectorate produced a best practice 
H09   6 paper, which has been circulated to all forces. It is designed to 
H09   7 streamline the licensing procedures and ensure that a high quality 
H09   8 of service is given to firearms users.<p/>
H09   9 <h_><p_>The use of firearms by police<p/><h/>
H09  10 <p_>I reported last year that 17 forces had introduced Armed 
H09  11 Response Vehicles (ARVs). This number has now increased to 24 
H09  12 forces. The deployment of specialist officers equipped to respond 
H09  13 to armed incidents is necessary to match the rise in the criminal 
H09  14 use of firearms. Apart from operational advantages ARVs:<p/>
H09  15 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>restrict the use of firearms to a smaller cadre 
H09  16 of experienced and better trained officers;<p/>
H09  17 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>reduce abstractions for firearms training.<p/>
H09  18 <p_>During 1991, there were five incidents in which police fired 
H09  19 shots which resulted in death or injury. All these incidents were 
H09  20 referred to the Police Complaints Authority who supervised 
H09  21 investigations into the shootings.<p/>
H09  22 <p_>In two of these cases, the weapons recovered from those shot by 
H09  23 police were incapable of firing ammunition. Individuals who 
H09  24 threaten members of the public or police officers with replica 
H09  25 firearms place themselves in extreme danger. Even under ideal 
H09  26 conditions it is often difficult to distinguish between a replica 
H09  27 and a genuine firearm. At night or in an operational situation it 
H09  28 is virtually impossible particularly as individuals in these 
H09  29 circumstances usually act in a way calculated to indicate that the 
H09  30 weapon is real. I am pleased that the Government are considering 
H09  31 recommendations for extending the range of offences relating to the 
H09  32 misuses of replica firearms.<p/>
H09  33 <h|>Crime
H09  34 <p_>There has been yet another dramatic increase in the number of 
H09  35 recorded crimes. Crime in some force areas increased by as much as 
H09  36 34%. During 1991, approximately 4.2 million offences were recorded 
H09  37 in the provincial police forces, an increase of some 18% over 
H09  38 1990.<p/>
H09  39 <p_>The vast majority of recorded crimes, approximately 94%, was 
H09  40 against property. Of this 30% involved the theft of or from motor 
H09  41 vehicles and 24% were burglaries.<p/>
H09  42 <p_>Crimes involving violence accounted for 5% of the total 
H09  43 offences and there are wide variations in the frequency of 
H09  44 different types of violent crime. For example, whilst offences of 
H09  45 robbery show an increase of 29%, sexual offences, the majority of 
H09  46 which comprise indecent assaults on females, show a comparatively 
H09  47 small increase of 1.7%. However such crimes remain of particular 
H09  48 concern to both the public and the police. This is reflected in the 
H09  49 high overall clear-up rate for these offences.<p/>
H09  50 <p_>The Police Service has never done more to ensure that reported 
H09  51 crime is effectively investigated. This has been achieved by:<p/>
H09  52 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>the continued development of crime management 
H09  53 units;<p/>
H09  54 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>the improvement of administrative and crime 
H09  55 support units;<p/>
H09  56 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>the development of crime intelligence systems;<p/>
H09  57 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>the increasing targeting of criminals.<p/>
H09  58 <p_>Staff from the Inspectorate have conducted a study into the 
H09  59 investigation of offences of domestic burglary in some provincial 
H09  60 forces. The study addressed a number of issues including the 
H09  61 quality of the service provided to the victim of crime. It revealed 
H09  62 discrepancies in the way burglaries were recorded and investigated 
H09  63 and while generally the standard was already high there was scope 
H09  64 for improvement. The findings of this research have been prepared 
H09  65 as a good practice document and circulated to all forces.<p/>
H09  66 <p_>It has been roughly estimated that car crime in the United 
H09  67 Kingdom costs something in the order of pounds1 billion per annum, 
H09  68 although this does not take into account the human cost in terms of 
H09  69 death and injury which result from these offences.<p/>
H09  70 <p_>In the outbreaks of disorder that occurred during the year, a 
H09  71 common factor has often been the criminal use of motor vehicles, 
H09  72 incuding the unlawful taking of high powered cars. Forces have 
H09  73 responded by adopting a wide range of tactics including operational 
H09  74 targeting and the implementation of force wide and inter-regional 
H09  75 initiatives involving crime squads, traffic task force units and 
H09  76 helicopter surveillance. Other specific strategies have been aimed 
H09  77 at developing local authority and inter-agency co-operation to 
H09  78 divert young people from car crime.<p/>
H09  79 <p_>In addition, forces have emphasised the importance of vehicle 
H09  80 security in their crime prevention strategies and many have 
H09  81 undertaken innovative ideas aimed at combating car crime. An 
H09  82 example of this is 'Vehicle Watch'. This initiative has been 
H09  83 adopted by a considerable number of forces throughout the country. 
H09  84 The four Welsh forces have taken this one step further by 
H09  85 introducing an all Wales 'Vehicle Watch' scheme. These efforts will 
H09  86 be continued with national crime prevention strategies being 
H09  87 targeted towards vehicle offences.<p/>
H09  88 <p_>Whilst the potential seriousness of car crime is clearly 
H09  89 recognised by the Service and local initiatives have often proved 
H09  90 successful in combating it, something more than policing 
H09  91 initiatives will be necessary if any significant impact is to be 
H09  92 made in reducing thefts of and from motor vehicles. I welcome the 
H09  93 wide range of initiatives now being taken forward by the Home 
H09  94 Office to tackle this problem.<p/>
H09  95 <p_>Prevention is central to the fight against crime and training 
H09  96 courses provided to police officers at the Home Office Crime 
H09  97 Prevention Centre are desigend to increase the penetration of the 
H09  98 philosophy of crime prevention within the Police Service. In 
H09  99 addition the Safer Cities initiatives demonstrate how local action 
H09 100 can effectively combat crime by way of specific crime prevention 
H09 101 schemes and the development of multi-agency partnerships. I support 
H09 102 the continuing efforts of the Home Office and the police to make 
H09 103 the public more aware of the need to take crime prevention 
H09 104 seriously, although clearly there is still much to be done to 
H09 105 achieve effective and long term practical improvements.<p/>
H09 106 <h_><p_>Child abuse<p/><h/>
H09 107 <p_>The publication 'Working Together' has been revised and updated 
H09 108 in the light of good practice and difficulties experienced in the 
H09 109 past three years. It provides an excellent guide to inter-agency 
H09 110 co-operation for the protection of children from abuse. The joint 
H09 111 investigation of child abuse can be a complex and difficult 
H09 112 responsibility and is not one which all officers would choose or 
H09 113 indeed are suited to undertake. HMIC supports the principle that 
H09 114 such duties whould, wherever practicable, be undertaken by 
H09 115 specialist teams of selected officers who have received joint 
H09 116 training with Social Services. Examination of child abuse 
H09 117 procedures by HMIC will continue to be a priority and liaison will 
H09 118 be maintained with the Social Services Inspectorate to ensure that 
H09 119 the good progress made in inter-agency practice is continued and 
H09 120 that the best interests of children is ensured.<p/>
H09 121 <h_><p_>Serious and organised crime<p/><h/>
H09 122 <p_>Regional Crime Squads, together with their drugs wings, have 
H09 123 continued to provide an effective response to professional 
H09 124 criminals whose activities transcend force, regional and national 
H09 125 boundaries. With the easing of international border controls, the 
H09 126 Police Service finds itself having to respond more and more to 
H09 127 international crime and the expertise of the Regional Crime Squads 
H09 128 in increasingly important.<p/>
H09 129 <p_>Last year, I referred briefly to the review that had been 
H09 130 undertaken in relation to Regional Crime Squads. The 
H09 131 recommendations resulting from this review are intended to provide 
H09 132 a more effective and efficient investigative force capable of 
H09 133 tackling the most serious crime and have been the subject of wide 
H09 134 consultation and comprehensive financial analysis. A tripartite 
H09 135 steering group is currently considering all the implications, with 
H09 136 a view to identifying the appropriate way forward.<p/>
H09 137 <h|>Drugs
H09 138 <p_>The growth in the misuse of drugs in the United Kingdom 
H09 139 continues to be a very considerable cause for concern with major 
H09 140 criminals being drawn into the field by the expectation of high 
H09 141 financial rewards. Whilst some two-thirds of the total drugs 
H09 142 problem is centred in London and the South East, the majority of 
H09 143 conurbations now have well-established drugs communities supplied 
H09 144 by organised distributors.<p/>
H09 145 <p_>Heroin use remains high and in the period January to September 
H09 146 1991 the police seized more heroin than in the whole of 1990. The 
H09 147 increase in the number of seizures of 'Crack' is of particular 
H09 148 concern with intelligence suggesting that this form of drug is 
H09 149 becoming more widely available.<p/>
H09 150 <p_>Seizures of amphetamines confirm them as having the widest 
H09 151 distribution of all drugs. They are particularly attractive to 
H09 152 young people and injection, being a fairly common practice, 
H09 153 presents serious ancillary health risks through intravenous 
H09 154 infection.<p/>
H09 155 <p_>Police seizures of the hallucinogenic derivative MDMA (Ecstasy) 
H09 156 have greatly exceeded those in 1990.<p/>
H09 157 <h_><p_>Seized Assets Fund<p/><h/>
H09 158 <p_>During the early part of the year the Home Secretary announced 
H09 159 the establishment of the Seized Assets Fund financed from the 
H09 160 proceeds of drug trafficking seized under international 
H09 161 confiscation agreements. Of the pounds3.2 million received during 
H09 162 1991/92, pounds1 million has been earmarked to finance 
H09 163 international drug investigations by Police and Customs and 
H09 164 pounds2.2 million has been made available for individual projects 
H09 165 directed against the misuse of drugs. A total of pounds424,000 from 
H09 166 the fund has been made available to 14 police forces to purchase 
H09 167 encrypted radios to assist in anti drugs operations with 
H09 168 pounds81,500 for specialist computer equipment.<p/>
H09 169 <h|>Terrrorism
H09 170 <p_>Terrorist outrages throughout Great Britain continued during 
H09 171 1991, with the IRA displaying no regard for human life in their 
H09 172 quest to inflict damage on a variety of targets.<p/>
H09 173 <p_>There were 59 terrorist related incidents in 1991, most of 
H09 174 which involved the use of incendiary devices. It has been several 
H09 175 years since the terrorists last employed this method to attack 
H09 176 property on the mainland. While the more serious incidents included 
H09 177 the bomb attack at Victoria Station, in which one man was killed, 
H09 178 and the mortar bomb attack on Dowing Street, all caused serious 
H09 179 inconvenience to the public and disrupted normal life.<p/>
H09 180 <p_>Two terrorists were killed while attempting to carry out an 
H09 181 attack in Hertfordshire, when the bomb they were handling exploded 
H09 182 prematurely.<p/>
H09 183 <p_>Notwithstanding the efforts of the IRA, it has been shown that 
H09 184 incresed vigilance and counter measures have thwarted the 
H09 185 terrorists on several occasions. The co-ordinated police approach 
H09 186 to the terrorist campaign has undoubtedly contributed significantly 
H09 187 to the disruption of IRA activities.<p/>
H09 188 <h_><p_>Offending on bail<p/><h/>
H09 189 <p_>My introduction to this report raised the considerable concern 
H09 190 expressed within the Service about offenders who continue to commit 
H09 191 crime while on bail<p/>
H09 192 <p_>Whilst the Police Service acknowledges the pressure that exists 
H09 193 within our already overcrowded prisons, the abuse of the bail 
H09 194 system by some hardened and active criminals causes frustration 
H09 195 both to the public and to the victims of crime.<p/>
H09 196 <p_>I am pleased the Home Office has announced a range of measures 
H09 197 intended to improve bail decisions and so reduce the opportunities 
H09 198 for offending while on bail. Work is also in hand to examine 
H09 199 aspects of police bail. A new working group, including the police, 
H09 200 courts and prosecutors, will take this work forward.<p/>
H09 201 <h_><p_>Victims support<p/><h/>
H09 202 <p_>The police have continued to work closely with members of 
H09 203 Victims Support Schemes to provide reassurance and assistance to 
H09 204 the victims of crime.<p/>
H09 205 <p_>A commitment to the care of victims is an important part of the 
H09 206 police investigation of crime. It can do much to alleviate the fear 
H09 207 and anxieties caused when offences are committed and ensures the 
H09 208 support and co-operation of the general community. Of particular 
H09 209 note is the effort now being made to care for the victims of 
H09 210 domestic violence. Many forces have trained dedicated officers and 
H09 211 are encouraged to work closely with all agencies to provide a 
H09 212 comprehensive system of support to those who suffer from crime.<p/>
H09 213 <h|>Traffic
H09 214 <p_>The new Road Traffic Act, inter alia, contained provisions for 
H09 215 detecting motoring offences by use of unmanned cameras. The current 
H09 216 cost of these cameras is in the region of pounds25,000 and Chief 
H09 217 Officers will need to consider their priorities carefully when 
H09 218 contemplating the purchase of this equipment. The indications are 
H09 219 that the publicity surrounding the installation of these cameras 
H09 220 reduces road accidents.<p/>
H09 221 <p_>The use of information technology is essential if expensive 
H09 222 traffic resources are to be effectively and efficiently used. The 
H09 223 development of computer packages to analyse in detail the causes of 
H09 224 accidents will permit force traffic departments and local police 
H09 225 commanders to work with the local authority and other agencies to 
H09 226 prepare action plans aimed at reducing accidents.<p/>
H09 227 <p_>Safety on the roads affects everyone in society. I regard the 
H09 228 maintenance of road safety and the enforcement of traffic laws as 
H09 229 being important features in the overall provision of a quality 
H09 230 policing service.<p/>
H09 231 
H10   1 <#FLOB:H10\><h_><p_>Expected and reported effects of alcohol<p/><h/>
H10   2 <p_>Although drivers on the whole recognised the impact of alcohol 
H10   3 on driving skills, a sizeable minority appeared sceptical about the 
H10   4 dangers involved. About one in four men drivers and one in seven 
H10   5 women drivers felt that driving when a little over the legal limit 
H10   6 did not increase their risk of being involved in an accident. 
H10   7 Similar proportions agreed that if they felt alright to drive then 
H10   8 it would be safe to do so even if they were <quote_>"a bit over the 
H10   9 limit"<quote/> (Appendix C: Table VII). Relatively few drivers, on 
H10  10 the other hand, thought that they could handle more alcohol than 
H10  11 the average drinker. No more than one in eight drivers took this 
H10  12 view in any of the four main driver groups (Appendix C: Table 
H10  13 VIII).<p/>
H10  14 <p_>The majority of drivers reported what might be described as 
H10  15 positive effects of drinking alcohol. Feeling more relaxed was 
H10  16 claimed by at least two-thirds of drivers across each of the four 
H10  17 groups. Moreover, almost half the younger drivers and one-third of 
H10  18 older drivers reported that drinking alcohol made them feel more 
H10  19 impulsive.(Appendix C: Table IX).<p/>
H10  20 <h_><p_>Attitudes to drinking and driving<p/><h/>
H10  21 <p_>There was strong evidence that drinking and driving attracted 
H10  22 widespread condemnation among the friends and families of the 
H10  23 drivers in the survey. Almost all drivers expected that their 
H10  24 families would disapprove of drinking and driving. On the other 
H10  25 hand, men drivers were less likely than women drivers to expect 
H10  26 that their friends would disapprove of their drinking and driving 
H10  27 (Appendix C: Table X).<p/>
H10  28 <p_>The majority of drivers themselves felt it was clearly wrong to 
H10  29 drive after drinking over the limit. More than four out of five in 
H10  30 each of the main driver groups agreed that it was morally 
H10  31 unacceptable to do so. However, the proportion of drivers whose 
H10  32 attitudes to drinking and driving were more ambivalent was by no 
H10  33 means insignificant. More than one-third of both men and women 
H10  34 drivers felt that it was difficult to avoid some drinking and 
H10  35 driving if they were going to have <quote_>"any kind of a social 
H10  36 life"<quote/>. In addition, almost half the younger men drivers 
H10  37 thought it was likely that they would drive in the next year when 
H10  38 they were over the legal limit. Even among older women drivers this 
H10  39 proportion was more than one in five (Appendix C: Table XI). 
H10  40 Moreover, at least one in four younger male drivers said that 
H10  41 limiting themselves to one or two standard drinks would seriously 
H10  42 affect their enjoyment of social occasions (Appendix C: Table 
H10  43 XII).<p/>
H10  44 <p_>Overall, men drivers most often gave the risk of legal 
H10  45 sanctions as the main reason for cutting down their drinking before 
H10  46 driving. About four out of ten men drivers gave this explanation 
H10  47 compared with about two out of ten women drivers. For women 
H10  48 drivers, general concern about the risk of being involved in a road 
H10  49 accident was the most frequently cited reason for limiting the 
H10  50 amount of alcohol consumed before driving. Less frequently, drivers 
H10  51 gave the risk of injury to themselves as their reason for drinking 
H10  52 less before driving. (Appendix C: Table XIII). Consistent with 
H10  53 their reasons for reducing alcohol consumption before driving, men 
H10  54 drivers appeared more concerned about the impact of conviction on 
H10  55 their personal life than women drivers.<p/>
H10  56 <p_>About three out of ten men drivers compared with two out of ten 
H10  57 women drivers thought that a drink-driving conviction would 
H10  58 <quote_>"almost ruin"<quote/> their lives (Appendix C: Table 
H10  59 XIV).<p/>
H10  60 <p_>The majority of drivers felt that the breathalyser was a fair 
H10  61 test of the amount of alcohol in a driver's blood. But about one in 
H10  62 four men drivers and about one in six women drivers disagreed. A 
H10  63 greater proportion of drivers felt that the breathalyser was not a 
H10  64 fair test of whether someone was safe to drive. About one in three 
H10  65 men drivers and one in five women drivers gave this view (Appendix 
H10  66 C: Table XV).<p/>
H10  67 <h_><p_>Knowledge of the law and police powers<p/><h/>
H10  68 <p_>When asked whether they could state the legal blood alcohol 
H10  69 limit in milligrams (mg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres (ml) of 
H10  70 blood, two-thirds of men drivers but less than half the women 
H10  71 drivers were able to supply a figure. Overall, only a small 
H10  72 proportion of drivers thought the legal maximum limit was higher 
H10  73 than 80 mg/100 ml blood. In contrast to the numbers specifying a 
H10  74 legal blood alcohol limit, rather more drivers were able to 
H10  75 indicate what they thought was the most they could drink without 
H10  76 going over the legal limit. Only about one in twenty men drivers 
H10  77 and one in ten women drivers were unable to say how many units of 
H10  78 beer they thought they could drink without going over the legal 
H10  79 limit. The majority of drivers gave a figure of four units or less 
H10  80 of beer. But while almost all women drivers gave such an answer, 
H10  81 about one in five men drivers said they thought they could drink 
H10  82 five or more units of beer without exceeding the legal limit 
H10  83 (Appendix C: Table XVI).<p/>
H10  84 <p_>On the whole, drivers did not appear confident about their 
H10  85 chances of avoiding detection if they did drink and drive. About 
H10  86 three-quarters of both men and women drivers estimated that their 
H10  87 own chances of being caught were one in 100 or greater (Appendix C: 
H10  88 Table XVII). Similarly, two-thirds of drivers judged that their 
H10  89 risk of being stopped by the police was greater if they had been 
H10  90 drinking than when they were sober (Appendix C: Table XVIII). On 
H10  91 the other hand, about one-third of men drivers, but slightly fewer 
H10  92 women drivers, agreed with the statement that if they drove 
H10  93 carefully after drinking they were not likely to get caught by the 
H10  94 police. (Appendix C: Table XIX). When asked about the penalties for 
H10  95 a first conviction on a drink-driving offence, the most frequently 
H10  96 mentioned sanctions were disqualification, fine and licence 
H10  97 endorsement. Overall, men drivers were more likely to mention 
H10  98 disqualification than were women drivers, nevertheless, about one 
H10  99 in four men drivers failed to recall this mandatory consequence of 
H10 100 conviction (Appendix C: Table XX).<p/>
H10 101 <p_>The majority of drivers recognised that, under the present law, 
H10 102 the police can stop any driver without needing a particular reason 
H10 103 to do so. Although the clear majority of drivers were aware they 
H10 104 were liable to be stopped at any time while driving, there was a 
H10 105 sizeable minority, particularly among older men drivers, who 
H10 106 thought that the police needed to have a specific reason to stop 
H10 107 someone. Three out of ten older men drivers expressed this view. 
H10 108 The majority of drivers also felt (mistakenly, since there need to 
H10 109 be reasonable grounds for suspicion) that the police could 
H10 110 breathalyse any driver without needing to have a particular reason. 
H10 111 Again, the proportion who thought that the police needed to have a 
H10 112 specific reason was highest among older men drivers (Appendix C: 
H10 113 Table XXI).<p/>
H10 114 <p_>Apart from older women drivers, most drivers in the survey knew 
H10 115 personally someone who had been breathalysed at some time and more 
H10 116 than two-fifths of younger men drivers knew someone who had been 
H10 117 breathalysed in the past 12 months. Rather fewer drivers had 
H10 118 themselves ever been breathalysed. Overall, about one in four of 
H10 119 younger and one in six of older men drivers had been required to 
H10 120 take a screening breath test compared with no more than one in 
H10 121 thirty among the corresponding age-groups of women drivers 
H10 122 (Appendix C: Table XXII).<p/>
H10 123 <h_><p_>Self-reported drink-driving<p/><h/>
H10 124 <p_>Analysis of drinking occasions away from home over the 
H10 125 preceding seven days showed that about one in ten men drivers and 
H10 126 about one in fifty women drivers in the survey had driven on one or 
H10 127 more occasions in the previous week after drinking five or more 
H10 128 units of alcohol. Other survey data indicated that rather higher 
H10 129 proportions of both men (22 per cent) and women drivers (five per 
H10 130 cent) had driven after drinking at least five units of alcohol on 
H10 131 one or more occasions over the previous 12 months.<p/>
H10 132 <p_>To sum up, the preceding overview of the general survey 
H10 133 findings provides some grounds for optimism over the extent to 
H10 134 which drivers limit their alcohol consumption before driving. While 
H10 135 drinking away from home was a frequent activity, particularly for 
H10 136 younger male drivers, drivers in general were much less likely to 
H10 137 drive themselves home after drinking five or more units of alcohol 
H10 138 than after drinking a lower amount. The effects of alcohol on the 
H10 139 risks of being involved in an accident were generally 
H10 140 well-recognised and, on the whole, drivers expressed strongly 
H10 141 negative attitudes to drinking and driving and were well-informed 
H10 142 about the legal limit and the number of drinks which would keep 
H10 143 them on the right side of the law. Drivers also appeared not to 
H10 144 underestimate police powers and, on the whole, they revealed 
H10 145 favourable attitudes to the main roadside screening device - the 
H10 146 breathalyser. Drivers did not appear to underestimate the chances 
H10 147 of being caught or minimise the consequences of detection and 
H10 148 conviction.<p/>
H10 149 <p_>There were, nevertheless, some findings which give rise to 
H10 150 concern. A minority of drivers, for example, indicated that they 
H10 151 had driven after drinking five or more units at least once in the 
H10 152 preceding week. A larger proportion felt safe to drive even if they 
H10 153 were over the legal limit. More evident still was the belief that 
H10 154 drinking and driving were necessary aspects of drivers' social 
H10 155 lives and almost half the younger male drivers in the survey agreed 
H10 156 that they were likely to drink and drive at least once over the 
H10 157 coming 12 months. About one in three drivers felt that they were 
H10 158 unlikely to be caught driving with illegal BACs if they drove 
H10 159 carefully.<p/>
H10 160 <p_>The next Chapter examines the relationship between police 
H10 161 enforcement practices and respondents' reported drink-drive 
H10 162 behaviour.<p/>
H10 163 
H10 164 <h_><p_>3 Area differences in drink-driving<p/><h/>
H10 165 <p_>Drivers in the survey were assigned to one of three groups 
H10 166 according to the location of interview. Nottinghamshire and Gwent 
H10 167 were combined to form the high-enforcement area. Leicestershire and 
H10 168 Gloucestershire formed the low-enforcement area. Drivers 
H10 169 interviewed elsewhere in England and Wales comprised the 'national' 
H10 170 group. The present and following Chapters examine whether drivers 
H10 171 in the high-enforcement area were less likely to drink and drive 
H10 172 than those in the low-enforcement area and, if so, was this because 
H10 173 they perceived a greater risk of being caught? The extent of area 
H10 174 differences in driver behaviour provides the focus of the present 
H10 175 Chapter. The next Chapter addresses whether any such differences 
H10 176 can be explained by variations in perceived detection risks or 
H10 177 whether other driver characteristics need to be taken into 
H10 178 account.<p/>
H10 179 <h_><p_>Is drink-driving related to police enforcement<p/><h/>
H10 180 <p_>At the beginning of their interviews, drivers were asked about 
H10 181 each drinking occasion away from home during the previous seven 
H10 182 days. Questions covered the numbers and types of drinks consumed as 
H10 183 well as the means of travel away from the drinking location. The 
H10 184 survey findings, based on details of more than 3,000 drinking 
H10 185 occasions, are presented separately for men aged 17-29 and 30-60 
H10 186 and for women aged 17-60 in Tables 2, 3 and 4. These Tables show 
H10 187 how respondents travelled from the drinking location after drinking 
H10 188 (a) four or fewer units and (b) five or more units of alcohol for 
H10 189 each of the three survey areas. Table 2 based on men drivers aged 
H10 190 17-29 shows that the proportion of drinking occasions involving 
H10 191 five or more units of alcohol followed by driving was eight per 
H10 192 cent in the high-enforcement area compared with a much higher 18 
H10 193 per cent in the low-enforcement area, a statistically significant 
H10 194 difference (chi-square = 11.78, 1 d.f., p<0.001, one-tailed test). 
H10 195 The corresponding rate in the 'national' area was 12 per cent.<p/>
H10 196 <p_><O_>table&caption<O/><p/>
H10 197 <p_>Table 3 shows that the figures for older men drivers (aged 
H10 198 30-60) were 11 per cent in the high-enforcement area and again a 
H10 199 much higher 27 per cent in the low-enforcement area, a 
H10 200 statistically significant difference (chi-square = 3.45, p<0.05). 
H10 201 The equivalent rate in the 'national' area was 17 per cent.<p/>
H10 202 <p_>Table 4 shows that for women drivers in the high-enforcement 
H10 203 area only four per cent of drinking occasions involving five or 
H10 204 more units of alcohol were followed by driving, while the 
H10 205 proportion for the low-enforcement area was higher at 11 per cent.
H10 206 
H11   1 <#FLOB:H11\><p_>Management should ensure that there is a documented 
H11   2 training programme encompassing all aspects of QA work including 
H11   3 the development of auditing and inspection skills and communication 
H11   4 techniques. The training programme should, where possible, include 
H11   5 on-the-job experience under the supervision of competent and 
H11   6 trained staff. Attendance at in-house and external seminars and 
H11   7 courses may also be relevant. Development should be continuous and 
H11   8 subject to periodic review.<p/>
H11   9 <p_>The training of QA personnel must be documented and their 
H11  10 competence appropriately endorsed. Records should be kept up to 
H11  11 date and be subsequently archived.<p/>
H11  12 <p_>To enable QA personnel to function effectively, Management 
H11  13 should provide appropriate office facilities with sufficient secure 
H11  14 storage for data and documentation. In addition, where the Testing 
H11  15 Facility uses computerised methods for data collection and storage, 
H11  16 QA personnel should have ready, independent, and at least read-only 
H11  17 access to computer databases.<p/>
H11  18 <h_><p_>4. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE QA PROGRAMME<p/>
H11  19 <p_>(i) The Master Schedule<p/><h/>
H11  20 <p_>GLP Principles require the Testing Facility to maintain a 
H11  21 listing of all studies planned, in progress or completed. This 
H11  22 'Master Schedule' should normally provide the following information 
H11  23 on each study:<p/>
H11  24 <p_>Unique study identification.<p/>
H11  25 <p_>Test substance, test system, and nature of the study.<p/>
H11  26 <p_>Name of the Study Director.<p/>
H11  27 <p_>Start and completion dates.<p/>
H11  28 <p_>The inclusion of further information such as the date of issue 
H11  29 of the final report and the date of archiving can be useful.<p/>
H11  30 <p_>The Master Schedule can be used by QA personnel (and by 
H11  31 Compliance Monitoring Inspectors) to assess the volume of work 
H11  32 being performed by the Testing Facility and by individuals within 
H11  33 it and enables them to maintain awareness of studies planned and in 
H11  34 progress. Management must therefore ensure that QA staff have ready 
H11  35 access to the Master Schedule. Responsibility for maintaining a 
H11  36 Master Schedule rests with Testing Facility Management; however, 
H11  37 this task may be advantageously performed by QA staff.<p/>
H11  38 <p_>GLP Compliance Monitoring Inspectors will wish to identify 
H11  39 studies for which GLP Compliance is claimed. The Master Schedule 
H11  40 should clearly identify these studies. Management are reminded that 
H11  41 GLP studies must be identified as such before they are initiated. 
H11  42 This does not prevent Management from subsequently down-grading or 
H11  43 terminating a GLP study providing its change of status is noted in 
H11  44 the Master Schedule and any data that have been generated are 
H11  45 retained in accordance with GLP Principles.<p/>
H11  46 <h_><p_>(ii) Study Protocol (Plan)<p/><h/>
H11  47 <p_>Management must ensure that the study protocol (sometimes 
H11  48 referred to as the Study Plan) is available to QA before a study 
H11  49 starts. This will permit QA personnel:<p/>
H11  50 <p_>- to assure compliance of the protocol with GLP Principles;<p/>
H11  51 <p_>- to assure the completeness, clarity and consistency of the 
H11  52 protocol;<p/>
H11  53 <p_>- to identify the critical phases of the study and to plan its 
H11  54 QA monitoring programme in relation to the study;<p/>
H11  55 <p_>- to enter the study in the Master Schedule if their 
H11  56 responsibilities include this function.<p/>
H11  57 <p_>To facilitate effective study monitoring, protocol amendments 
H11  58 must be forwarded promptly to QA.<p/>
H11  59 <h_><p_>(iii) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)<p/><h/>
H11  60 <p_>Where QA has, in addition to QA SOPs, involvement with the 
H11  61 production of Testing Facility SOPs or with maintenance of the 
H11  62 Master Schedule this must be detailed in relevant SOPs.<p/>
H11  63 <p_>It is desirable that QA personnel review Testing Facility SOPs 
H11  64 before issue in order to assess their clarity and GLP compliance as 
H11  65 the quality of the documentation has a bearing on the effectiveness 
H11  66 of the QA function.<p/>
H11  67 <p_>Management may charge QA with the responsibility for assuring 
H11  68 that SOPs are periodically reviewed by the relevant personnel; for 
H11  69 assuring that the production and issue of SOPs is controlled to 
H11  70 discourage the taking of unauthorised copies; and for ensuring that 
H11  71 all copies of superseded SOP editions are removed from the working 
H11  72 areas and a copy of each retained in the archives.<p/>
H11  73 <p_>QA should be required to keep readily available copies of all 
H11  74 SOPs relevant to the procedures that it monitors.<p/>
H11  75 <h_><p_>(iv) Planning and Recording of Inspections and 
H11  76 Audits<p/><h/>
H11  77 <p_>QA is responsible for the regular monitoring of the test 
H11  78 facility's operations and procedures and the periodic monitoring of 
H11  79 studies.<p/>
H11  80 <p_>In order to function effectively, QA personnel must document 
H11  81 the schedule of intended audits and inspections for all studies and 
H11  82 processes under surveillance and, subsequently, keep records of all 
H11  83 their activities. It is a Management responsibility to ensure by 
H11  84 reference to such records that QA personnel are properly meeting 
H11  85 their commitments. Such records include a list of the phases that 
H11  86 are to be inspected for each study type or process covered. The 
H11  87 intended frequency of the inspections should also be defined, but 
H11  88 this should not preclude additional inspections if unanticipated 
H11  89 problems arise.<p/>
H11  90 <h_><p_>(v) Objectives of an Inspection<p/><h/>
H11  91 <p_>Management should specify for QA personnel the principal 
H11  92 objectives of their monitoring activities. These will include, but 
H11  93 may not be limited to, assurance that:<p/>
H11  94 <p_>- the protocol and approved amendments are available to 
H11  95 relevant study personnel and that its requirements are being 
H11  96 followed;<p/>
H11  97 <p_>- the relevant SOPs are readily available in the operational 
H11  98 areas; that staff concerned are familiar with their content; and 
H11  99 that the procedures are being performed in accordance with the SOP, 
H11 100 or that deviations have been documented, explained and authorised 
H11 101 by the Study Director or relevant line manager;<p/>
H11 102 <p_>- all data being generated are recorded in accordance with GLP 
H11 103 requirements;<p/>
H11 104 <p_>- the facilities are adequate for the proper conduct of the 
H11 105 procedure and the equipment properly maintained and calibrated;<p/>
H11 106 <p_>- all test systems and specimens, test substances, reagents and 
H11 107 solutions are properly identified and housed or stored to maintain 
H11 108 their integrity;<p/>
H11 109 <p_>- documentation exists showing that all personnel involved in 
H11 110 the study have sufficient training and experience to perform their 
H11 111 duties.<p/>
H11 112 <p_>QA should pay particular attention to the flow of information 
H11 113 and the chain of custody of samples across the interfaces of 
H11 114 contributing disciplines and work groups.<p/>
H11 115 <p_>To assist them in conducting inspections and audits, QA 
H11 116 personnel can prepare checklists to remind them of the specific 
H11 117 aspects which may need to be examined in each case. However, 
H11 118 checklists should not be used in such a way as to exclude 
H11 119 initiative and flexibility of approach.<p/>
H11 120 <p_>Management should ensure QA personnel are informed of 
H11 121 developments or proposed expansions within the organisation it is 
H11 122 monitoring, and of changes in procedures or techniques within 
H11 123 departments.<p/>
H11 124 <h_><p_>(vi) Study-based, Process-based and Facility 
H11 125 Inspections<p/><h/>
H11 126 <p_>QA personnel should be required by Management to conduct 
H11 127 inspections which may be study, process or facility based, as 
H11 128 appropriate.<p/>
H11 129 <p_>- <tf_>Study-based inspections<tf/> are those related to 
H11 130 specific events occurring during a study; they usually include 
H11 131 monitoring of 'critical phases' of the study.<p/>
H11 132 <p_>- <tf_>Process-based inspections<tf/> are those unrelated to 
H11 133 specific studies, and which are carried out periodically. They may 
H11 134 be applied to aspects of studies that are conducted as repetitive 
H11 135 (routine) processes, or where a given type of operation or study is 
H11 136 undertaken in large numbers by the facility and each study is of 
H11 137 such short duration that monitoring of each individually is 
H11 138 impracticable. In such cases, monitoring on a random sample basis 
H11 139 may be appropriate although the basis for such sample monitoring 
H11 140 should be defined.<p/>
H11 141 <p_>- <tf_>Facility inspections<tf/> are those conducted to cover 
H11 142 the general facilities and support services, including 
H11 143 installations, computer systems, staff training, environmental 
H11 144 monitoring and maintenance.<p/>
H11 145 <p_>In some testing facilities, Management require the Archive to 
H11 146 be administered by QA. Where this is so, inspection procedures must 
H11 147 be laid down which ensure that conflicts of interest are avoided. 
H11 148 It is essential to avoid situations whereby QA personnel report the 
H11 149 outcome of Archive inspections only to their own line management or 
H11 150 monitor their own activities.<p/>
H11 151 <h_><p_>(vii) Audits of Data and Financial Reports<p/><h/>
H11 152 <p_>GLP Principles require that Management ensures that raw data 
H11 153 are reviewed by QA personnel. This can be accomplished in a number 
H11 154 of ways. For example, the records may be examined by QA personnel 
H11 155 during process based inspections; during audits of final reports; 
H11 156 or may be reviewed by them at specially conducted data audits 
H11 157 during the live phases of the study.<p/>
H11 158 <p_>Management must ensure that all Final Reports for which GLP 
H11 159 Compliance is claimed are audited by QA and the findings reported, 
H11 160 as appropriate, to Management and the Study Director. This audit 
H11 161 should be conducted at the final draft stage, when all of the raw 
H11 162 data have been gathered together and no major changes are 
H11 163 intended.<p/>
H11 164 <p_>The aims of the final report audit should be to determine 
H11 165 whether or not:<p/>
H11 166 <p_>- the study was carried out in accordance with the protocol;<p/>
H11 167 <p_>- the study has been accurately and completely reported;<p/>
H11 168 <p_>- the report contains all the elements required by GLP;<p/>
H11 169 <p_>- the report is internally consistent;<p/>
H11 170 <p_>- the raw data are complete and compliant with GLP 
H11 171 Principles.<p/>
H11 172 <p_>QA may find it useful in any subsequent discussions which they 
H11 173 may have with Management or the Study Director if their final 
H11 174 report audit has been recorded in sufficient detail to enable the 
H11 175 audit to be reconstructed. Procedures must be established to ensure 
H11 176 that QA personnel are made aware of all additions or changes to the 
H11 177 study data and study report made during the audit phase.<p/>
H11 178 <p_>Before signing the Quality Assurance Statement, QA should be 
H11 179 required to check the Final Report to ensure that all issues raised 
H11 180 in the QA audit have been appropriately addressed, that all agreed 
H11 181 actions have been completed and that no changes to the report have 
H11 182 been made which would require a further audit.<p/>
H11 183 <p_>Any correction or addition to a fully authorised and signed 
H11 184 Final Report must be audited by QA. A revised or additional Quality 
H11 185 Assurance Statement must then be provided.<p/>
H11 186 <h_><p_>(viii) QA Involvement with Computer Systems<p/><h/>
H11 187 <p_>GLP Principles require that procedures exist to ensure that 
H11 188 computer systems that are used in regulatory studies are suitably 
H11 189 designed, controlled, operated and maintained in order to properly 
H11 190 accommodate their intended function.<p/>
H11 191 <p_>Management may consider it desirable to involve QA in an 
H11 192 advisory capacity during the development of the system to ensure 
H11 193 that it complies with GLP Principles. However, QA personnel need 
H11 194 not validate computer systems themselves although they should 
H11 195 assure themselves that the system has been validated and formally 
H11 196 accepted. Management should be aware that computer systems 
H11 197 installed before the facility became GLP compliant must be 
H11 198 evaluated to demonstrate acceptability for continued use under a 
H11 199 GLP regime.<p/>
H11 200 <p_>Once a system has been accepted, QA personnel should be 
H11 201 required to monitor continued effectiveness, including the 
H11 202 performance of staff, and to confirm that adequate documents, 
H11 203 records and procedures exist. This will involve any or all of the 
H11 204 following:<p/>
H11 205 <p_>- Confirmation that adequate SOPs exist and that they are being 
H11 206 followed.<p/>
H11 207 <p_>- Inspection of the system during operation to check accuracy 
H11 208 of data capture and effectiveness of back-up procedures.<p/>
H11 209 <p_>- Inspection of change control procedures for compliance with 
H11 210 SOPs and to confirm that documentation is adequate.<p/>
H11 211 <p_>- Inspection of the computer facility to audit maintenance and 
H11 212 security procedures together with archive procedures and 
H11 213 maintenance of copies against accidental loss of data.<p/>
H11 214 <p_>- Confirmation that users and operators have received 
H11 215 appropriate training and that documentation to that effect 
H11 216 exists.<p/>
H11 217 <p_>- Periodical verification of the integrity of the data 
H11 218 retrieval system.<p/>
H11 219 <h_><p_>(ix) QA Monitoring of Specialist Disciplines<p/><h/>
H11 220 <p_>There are no aspects of a GLP regulated study that are exempt 
H11 221 from the remit of QA. Management must therefore ensure that QA 
H11 222 monitoring extends to all areas including those that are by 
H11 223 convention regarded as professional specialisms. That QA personnel 
H11 224 do not have professional experience in all fields is not relevant 
H11 225 as it is not part of the role of QA to evaluate or confirm 
H11 226 professional judgements. Rather, the function of QA is to assure 
H11 227 that the judgements are made in respect of the correct specimens, 
H11 228 measurements, or observations, that they are properly recorded and 
H11 229 accurately reflected in the Final Report.<p/>
H11 230 <p_>Management must require QA to report to them inconsistencies in 
H11 231 subjective assessments. Management should consider whether a 
H11 232 documented peer-review mechanism in addition to QA is appropriate 
H11 233 or expressly required by a Regulatory Authority for particular 
H11 234 specialisms; QA should have an involvement in such review 
H11 235 mechanisms and their role should be documented.<p/>
H11 236 <h_><p_>5. REPORTING OF AUDIT AND INSPECTION FINDINGS<p/><h/>
H11 237 <p_>Management should require that the conclusions of QA 
H11 238 inspections and audits are reported promptly to them in writing. 
H11 239 The procedures adopted must permit timely and effective corrective 
H11 240 action on any adverse findings. Management should ensure that for 
H11 241 study-based inspections and final report audits, the QA reports are 
H11 242 also sent to the Study Director.
H11 243 
H12   1 <#FLOB:H12\><h|>SUMMARY
H12   2 <p_>1. The growing significance of science and technology (S&T) for 
H12   3 economic growth and the quality of life provides an overwhelming 
H12   4 argument for increased scientific education for all and greater 
H12   5 attention to the development of the next generation of highly 
H12   6 qualified S&T personnel.<p/>
H12   7 <p_>2. Education in S&T has been the subject of a number of 
H12   8 reports, many of which have focused on particular stages or 
H12   9 subjects. In this report we have considered the whole process of 
H12  10 education in S&T, starting in schools and progressing through 
H12  11 higher education into employment, recognising the many interactions 
H12  12 between each of these stages. We have also paid particular 
H12  13 attention to the potential scope for using new technology to 
H12  14 improve teaching quality and productivity so that the costs of the 
H12  15 planned expansion in higher education can be minimised.<p/>
H12  16 <h_><p_>KEY PROBLEMS AND CONSTRAINTS<p/><h/>
H12  17 <p_>3. Many young people give up studying science as soon as they 
H12  18 can. The introduction of the national curriculum and the General 
H12  19 Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) have improved the 
H12  20 situation in that they now have to study science for longer and 
H12  21 courses up to the age of 16 are becoming more attractive. But too 
H12  22 few students are studying S&T subjects beyond the age of 16.<p/>
H12  23 <p_>4. Advanced ('A') level courses in S&T subjects are 
H12  24 unattractive to many young people. They place too much emphasis on 
H12  25 learning facts at the expense of understanding fundamental 
H12  26 scientific principles and the development of scientific skills. The 
H12  27 restricted number of 'A' levels which it is feasible for most 
H12  28 students to take also reduces the scope for arts students to be 
H12  29 scientifically educated and for science students to develop wider 
H12  30 communications and other personal skills.<p/>
H12  31 <p_>5. Higher education courses in S&T are also becoming less 
H12  32 popular. For many students they provide an unsatisfactory 
H12  33 intellectual and educational experience and an inadequate 
H12  34 preparation for future jobs. The factual content which has been 
H12  35 added over the years has become excessive leading to rote learning 
H12  36 and insufficient understanding of fundamental principles.<p/>
H12  37 <p_>6. Many people who would benefit from higher education in S&T, 
H12  38 particularly mature students, cannot do so because of the lack of 
H12  39 recognition given to non traditional qualifications and 
H12  40 insufficient practical support.<p/>
H12  41 <p_>7. Despite the many difficulties of achieving an S&T 
H12  42 qualification, career prospects for scientists and technologists 
H12  43 including relative pay and career development opportunities are 
H12  44 generally not as good as in many alternative jobs. S&T graduates 
H12  45 complain of being bored and under-utilised indicating scope for 
H12  46 higher productivity and pay. The poor image of careers feeds back 
H12  47 into schools, colleges and universities and discourages another 
H12  48 generation of young people from pursuing a scientific education.<p/>
H12  49 <p_>8. The main constraints to progress relate to the perceived 
H12  50 unattractiveness of S&T as a subject in schools and as a potential 
H12  51 career, the rigidities of the 'A' level system, the structure of 
H12  52 S&T degree courses and the barriers to access to higher education 
H12  53 for non traditional applicants.<p/>
H12  54 <h_><p_>PROPOSED SOLUTIONS<p/><h/>
H12  55 <p_>9. The positive changes introduced into schools need to be 
H12  56 built upon with improved facilities and technical assistance for 
H12  57 S&T teachers. Flexibility in teachers' pay needs to be implemented 
H12  58 more effectively at local level to fill vacancies in S&T 
H12  59 subjects.<p/>
H12  60 <p_>10. Post compulsory education should be broadened with 
H12  61 combinations of S&T subjects with economics, languages and other 
H12  62 arts subjects being encouraged. The changes proposed by Schools 
H12  63 Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC) including the concepts 
H12  64 of 'common cores' between Advanced Supplementary level ('AS') and 
H12  65 'A' levels and the development of core skills should be supported 
H12  66 and implemented as quickly as possible. Success in 'AS' level 
H12  67 examinations should become a foundation for higher education and a 
H12  68 more widely used entry qualification.<p/>
H12  69 <p_>11. Access to higher education in S&T subjects should be 
H12  70 widened to prevent the current loss of many potential scientists 
H12  71 and technologists. A number of valuable wider access initiatives 
H12  72 have already been developed but their scale is insufficient and 
H12  73 greater efforts are needed.<p/>
H12  74 <p_>12. A substantial change is needed to the content and structure 
H12  75 of the majority of S&T degree courses to make them more useful and 
H12  76 relevant for students. Courses should focus on the development of a 
H12  77 thorough understanding of fundamental concepts and give more 
H12  78 emphasis to experimental method and the acquisition of the 
H12  79 analytical, communications and other crucial skills needed in 
H12  80 employment. The rote learning of facts should be reduced to provide 
H12  81 scope for these changes.<p/>
H12  82 <p_>13. New learning technologies such as inter-active video 
H12  83 systems, compact discs and computer based learning should be 
H12  84 introduced to facilitate higher productivity in Higher Educational 
H12  85 Institutions (HEIs) and the expansion of student numbers. This will 
H12  86 require pump<?_>-<?/>priming funds for software development.<p/>
H12  87 <p_>14. An optional fourth year of specialised study should be 
H12  88 introduced for chemistry, physics and engineering degrees to 
H12  89 provide a sound base for those wishing to pursue research.<p/>
H12  90 <p_>15. Employment practices also need to be improved. This will 
H12  91 require employers of S&T personnel in both the public and private 
H12  92 sectors to provide better career and personal development 
H12  93 opportunities, and a rate of salary progression which maintains 
H12  94 comparability with other professions.<p/>
H12  95 <h|>PRIORITIES
H12  96 <p_>16. We suggest that, of the proposals for change contained in 
H12  97 this report, priority needs to be given to:<p/>
H12  98 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>increasing the attractiveness of science in 
H12  99 schools by increasing the numbers of qualified S&T teachers and 
H12 100 generating greater enthusiasm and motivation among science 
H12 101 teachers. This might be achieved through greater local flexibility 
H12 102 of pay, better teaching facilities and equipment and the provision 
H12 103 of more technical assistance for S&T teachers.<p/>
H12 104 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>widening post compulsory education by enhancing 
H12 105 the status and currency of 'AS' levels and making them a more 
H12 106 widely used entry qualification for higher education.<p/>
H12 107 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>making S&T degree courses more attractive and 
H12 108 relevant by concentrating on the development of a better 
H12 109 understanding of fundamental concepts, improving analytical and 
H12 110 problem solving skills and reducing the volume of factual learning. 
H12 111 The new three year degree course would need to be complemented by 
H12 112 an optional fourth year leading to a masters degree.<p/>
H12 113 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>making greater provision for access to higher 
H12 114 education for non traditional applicants<p/>
H12 115 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>improving prospects and pay for S&T careers<p/>
H12 116 <p_>17. Our proposals are aimed at shifting the emphasis in 
H12 117 education from processes that dissuade, sift out and exclude to 
H12 118 those that attract, encourage and support. Success in widening the 
H12 119 appeal of S&T education at all levels would generate major benefits 
H12 120 both for the economy and for our general quality of life.<p/>
H12 121 <h|>1. INTRODUCTION
H12 122 <p_>1.1. The significance of S&T for a competitive economy and for 
H12 123 our quality of life is profound. Education and training in 
H12 124 scientific and technical subjects is vital to our well being.<p/>
H12 125 <p_>1.2. This report prepared by the ACOST Manpower and Training 
H12 126 Committee deals with schools, higher education and employment. It 
H12 127 examines the inter-actions between the different elements involved 
H12 128 recognising that changes in one area can affect the system as a 
H12 129 whole. For example, whether pupils study S&T courses at school may 
H12 130 be influenced not only by the attractiveness of these courses and 
H12 131 the quality of the teaching but also by the feedback of information 
H12 132 from employers about S&T career prospects.<p/>
H12 133 <p_>1.3. The country needs to improve the scientific and 
H12 134 technological education of all young people and to increase the 
H12 135 supply of highly qualified scientists and technologists; both these 
H12 136 actions are needed for economic success. We welcome the many 
H12 137 positive steps which the Government, educational institutions and 
H12 138 employers have already taken in recent years to achieve these 
H12 139 objectives. There is general agreement on the need to:<p/>
H12 140 <p_>a. increase the attractiveness, relevance and usefulness of S&T 
H12 141 courses both in schools and HEIs;<p/>
H12 142 <p_>b. increase the numbers studying science after the age of 
H12 143 16;<p/>
H12 144 <p_>c. widen access to S&T courses in HEIs;<p/>
H12 145 <p_>d. improve the attractiveness of S&T careers;<p/>
H12 146 <p_>but the problem is how to achieve these results.<p/>
H12 147 <p_>1.4. The membership and terms of reference of the Committee are 
H12 148 given in Annexes A and B. Supporting evidence and arguments can be 
H12 149 found in the reports of the four Working Groups formed to examine 
H12 150 detailed aspects of the subject. These working papers are available 
H12 151 on request (see Annex D).<p/>
H12 152 <p_>1.5. Working Group A examined schools and education up to age 
H12 153 18, and the influences on young people affecting their choice of 
H12 154 whether to study S&T subjects. Working Group B examined higher 
H12 155 education including access to courses, the content and structure of 
H12 156 S&T degree courses and the range of skills needed in tomorrow's 
H12 157 graduates. Working Group C considered the changing practices of 
H12 158 individual firms in the recruitment and use of S&T graduates, 
H12 159 focusing in particular on career paths and what might be done to 
H12 160 encourage best practice by employers. Working Group D considered 
H12 161 the broader and longer term economic factors affecting the labour 
H12 162 market for highly qualified S&T personnel. In particular it 
H12 163 examined the influence of starting salaries and salary prospects on 
H12 164 career choice.<p/>
H12 165 <p_>1.6. We have been mainly concerned with the improvement of the 
H12 166 educational system in England and Wales particularly in relation to 
H12 167 sixth form education and S&T courses in HEIs. The situation in 
H12 168 Scotland is different and more satisfactory. We have drawn on some 
H12 169 Scottish ideas and experience in formulating our proposals.<p/>
H12 170 <h_><p_>2. SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS<p/><h/>
H12 171 <p_>A high proportion of pupils give up science as soon as they can 
H12 172 legally do so. The introduction of the national curriculum and the 
H12 173 GCSE has improved the situation in that pupils now have to study 
H12 174 science for longer and courses up to the age of 16 are becoming 
H12 175 more attractive. But too few pupils stay in education after the age 
H12 176 of 16 and of those who do, an insufficient and declining number 
H12 177 choose to study S&T. For example the numbers taking 'A' level 
H12 178 physics declined from 44,871 in 1989 to 42,564 in 1990 and those 
H12 179 taking 'A' level mathematics decreased from 82,987 to 77,277. The 
H12 180 numbers taking 'A' level chemistry also fell although only very 
H12 181 slightly from 47,559 to 47,286. There was however an increase in 
H12 182 those taking 'A' level biology from 42,138 to 44,382. What can be 
H12 183 done to make S&T more attractive to young people?<p/>
H12 184 <h_><p_>2.1. Initiatives aimed at increasing awareness of the 
H12 185 benefits of studying S&T<p/><h/>
H12 186 <p_>2.1.1. Because of the declining popularity of S&T courses 
H12 187 various initiatives aimed at making young people aware of the 
H12 188 benefits of studying science have been introduced. The Committee 
H12 189 asked some 250 experts on education how successful these 
H12 190 initiatives have been. The replies are extremely disappointing. 
H12 191 Respondents in schools almost unanimously thought that the 
H12 192 initiatives had achieved little with the possible exception of 
H12 193 Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), Technical and Vocational 
H12 194 Education Initiative (TVEI) and the Engineering Council's 
H12 195 'Neighbourhood Engineers' Scheme. Many schemes merely reinforced 
H12 196 the enthusiasm of pupils already interested in S&T and were 
H12 197 introduced too late in the education process to influence pupils' 
H12 198 decisions. To be timely and effective, initiatives require 
H12 199 sustained guidance and counselling from an early age to the point 
H12 200 of entry to higher education or professional life. Moreover, 
H12 201 non-government initiatives are fragmented; and even taken together 
H12 202 they reach only a fraction of the millions of pupils in the target 
H12 203 age ranges. Television, the one medium that might reach very large 
H12 204 numbers, remains largely untapped.<p/>
H12 205 <p_>2.1.2. The Committee received reports of successful examples of 
H12 206 work experience and work shadowing. However, to be successful, work 
H12 207 experience must be of a high quality; this involves considerable 
H12 208 effort both by the companies concerned and by the teachers. 
H12 209 Speakers from industry and commerce need to be able to convey the 
H12 210 excitement and challenge of careers in S&T. Small scale local 
H12 211 initiatives may be productive, but there is a need to avoid 
H12 212 fragmentation.<p/>
H12 213 <p_>2.1.3. To provide satisfactory work experience in S&T for all 
H12 214 of the nation's 750,000 secondary school pupils in each year group 
H12 215 would be a daunting task. Employers might achieve more by providing 
H12 216 teachers with scientific resources and project materials and 
H12 217 helping teachers deliver the national curriculum by assisting in 
H12 218 the development of attractive and balanced courses.<p/>
H12 219 <p_>2.1.4. We recommend that the Department of Education and 
H12 220 Science (DES) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) should 
H12 221 encourage the development of an effective focus for industry/school 
H12 222 initiatives to provide scope for experiences to be shared, reduce 
H12 223 fragmentation of effort and ensure a more structured and 
H12 224 professional approach.<p/>
H12 225 
H12 226 
H12 227 
H13   1 <#FLOB:H13\>The intention is that <tf|>both parents should feel 
H13   2 that they have a continuing role to play in relation to their 
H13   3 children.<p/>
H13   4 <p_>2.24. Section 2(5) provides that more than one person may have 
H13   5 parental responsibility for a child at the same time and by section 
H13   6 2(6) a person with parental responsibility for a child does not 
H13   7 lose it just because some other person subsequently acquires it. 
H13   8 Thus, the making of a residence order in favour of one parent does 
H13   9 not take away parental responsibility from the other. Nor do the 
H13  10 parent or parents of a child lose parental responsibility when a 
H13  11 third party who is neither parent nor guardian of the child 
H13  12 acquires parental responsibility, as an individual through the 
H13  13 making of a residence order in his or her favour (section 12(2)) or 
H13  14 a local authority, through the making of a care order (section 
H13  15 33(3)) (although the latter also has the power to determine the 
H13  16 extent to which a parent or guardian of the child may meet his 
H13  17 parental responsibility for him once the child is in care (section 
H13  18 33(3)(b))).<p/>
H13  19 <p_>2.25. It is provided by section 2(7) that, where parental 
H13  20 responsibility is shared, each may act independently of the other 
H13  21 in meeting that responsibility. Thus, although the making of a 
H13  22 residence order in favour of one parent may curb the other parent's 
H13  23 ability to act independently to the extent that in practice the day 
H13  24 to day care of the child is largely controlled by the parent with 
H13  25 whom the child lives, at least when the child is with the 
H13  26 non-residential parent he or she may meet his or her parental 
H13  27 responsibility to the full, without the need for consultation with 
H13  28 the other parent. The only restrictions on this are that neither 
H13  29 parent may act independently in matters where the consent of more 
H13  30 than one person is expressly required by statute (section 2(7)), 
H13  31 for example under section 1 of the Child Abduction Act 1984 in 
H13  32 relation to removal of the child from the United Kingdom or under 
H13  33 section 16 of the Adoption Act 1976 in relation to agreement to an 
H13  34 adoption order; nor may either parent act in any way that is 
H13  35 incompatible with any order made in respect of the child ( section 
H13  36 2(8)). Thus, for example, one parent may not remove the child from 
H13  37 the physical care of the parent (or indeed any other person) with 
H13  38 whom the child is to live by virtue of a residence order but could 
H13  39 take the same interest as any other parent in his child's 
H13  40 education.<p/>
H13  41 <p_>2.26. By section 12(2) the making of a residence order in 
H13  42 favour of a person who is neither parent nor guardian of a child 
H13  43 has the effect of conferring parental responsibility on him or her 
H13  44 while the residence order remains in force. However, he or she, 
H13  45 like a local authority with a care order in its favour (see section 
H13  46 33(6)), does not acquire the right to consent or refuse consent to 
H13  47 the making of an application to free the child for adoption or to 
H13  48 the making of an adoption order, or the right to appoint a 
H13  49 guardian. By section 12(1), where a residence order is made in 
H13  50 favour of an unmarried father the court must also make an order 
H13  51 under section 4 giving him parental responsibility; under section 
H13  52 12(4), this must not be brought to an end while the residence order 
H13  53 concerned remains in force. Indeed, if the residence order is 
H13  54 subsequently discharged the order giving him parental 
H13  55 responsibility will continue unless and until it is specifically 
H13  56 revoked. In such cases it will usually be in the child's interests 
H13  57 for his father to retain parental responsibility for him in just 
H13  58 the same way that a married father does.<p/>
H13  59 <p_>2.27. Another effect of a residence order is that no person may 
H13  60 cause the child to be known by a new surname nor remove him from 
H13  61 the United Kingdom without either the written consent of every 
H13  62 person who has parental responsibility for him or the leave of the 
H13  63 court (section 13(1)). This does not, however, prevent the person 
H13  64 in whose favour the residence order has been made from removing the 
H13  65 child for a period of less than one month (section 13(2)). There is 
H13  66 no limit on the number of these short trips, however, and if the 
H13  67 non-residential parent feels that the child is being taken out of 
H13  68 the United Kingdom too frequently or that there is a danger of 
H13  69 abduction he or she should seek a prohibited steps order.<p/>
H13  70 <p_>2.28. A residence order may be made in favour of more than one 
H13  71 person at the same time even though they do not live together, in 
H13  72 which case the order may specify the periods during which the child 
H13  73 is to live in the different households concerned (section 11(4)). A 
H13  74 shared residence order could therefore be made where the child is 
H13  75 to spend, for example, weekdays with one parent and weekends with 
H13  76 the other or term time with one parent and school holidays with the 
H13  77 other, or where the child is to spend large amounts of time with 
H13  78 each parent. This latter arrangement was disapproved of by the 
H13  79 Court of Appeal in <tf|>Riley v <tf|>Riley (1986) 2 FLR 429, which 
H13  80 must now be taken to have been over-ruled by section 11(4), but it 
H13  81 is not expected that it will become a common form of order, partly 
H13  82 because most children will still need the stability of a single 
H13  83 home, and partly because in the cases where shared care is 
H13  84 appropriate there is less likely to be a need for the court to make 
H13  85 any order at all. However, a shared care order has the advantage of 
H13  86 being more realistic in those cases where the child is to spend 
H13  87 considerable amounts of time with both parents, brings with it 
H13  88 certain other benefits (including the right to remove the child 
H13  89 from accommodation provided by a local authority under section 20), 
H13  90 and removes any impression that one parent is good and responsible 
H13  91 whereas the other parent is not.<p/>
H13  92 <h_><p_>Contact orders<p/><h/>
H13  93 <p_>2.29. Unlike the present access order, which normally provides 
H13  94 for a parent to have access to the child, the new contact order 
H13  95 provides for the child to visit or stay with the person named in 
H13  96 the order. The emphasis has thus shifted from the adult to the 
H13  97 child. The new order may provide for the child to have contact with 
H13  98 <tf|>any person, not just a parent, and more than one contact order 
H13  99 may be made in respect of a child. 'Contact' may range from long or 
H13 100 short visits to contact by letter or telephone. It is anticipated 
H13 101 that the usual order will be for reasonable contact, although the 
H13 102 court will be able to attach conditions or make directions under 
H13 103 section 11(7) where necessary. Contact orders, like residence 
H13 104 orders will lapse if the parents subsequently live together for a 
H13 105 period of more than six months (section 11(5) and (6).<p/>
H13 106 <p_>2.30. Contact orders under section 8 must be distinguished from 
H13 107 orders under section 34 for contact with a child in care. Section 8 
H13 108 contact orders cannot be made if the child is the subject of a care 
H13 109 order, because in this case the local authority has a statutory 
H13 110 duty to allow the child reasonable contact with his parents 
H13 111 (whether or not they both have parental responsibility), any 
H13 112 guardian, and any other person with whom the child was to live by 
H13 113 virtue of a residence order in force immediately before the care 
H13 114 order was made. Section 34 contact orders will therefore only be 
H13 115 made if it is necessary to limit, remove or define such contact, or 
H13 116 to provide for contact with some other person. In the case of 
H13 117 private individuals, however, it may sometimes be necessary to 
H13 118 order them to allow reasonable contact, as well as to define what 
H13 119 contact is to be allowed in particularly difficult or contentious 
H13 120 cases. Occasionally, this may be necessary where a child is being 
H13 121 provided with accommodation under section 20 and a dispute arises 
H13 122 as to the contact which the foster parent or children's home should 
H13 123 allow. It should be noted that a section 8 contact order is a 
H13 124 positive order in the sense that it requires contact to be allowed 
H13 125 between an individual and a child and cannot be used to deny 
H13 126 contact. This would require a prohibited steps order.<p/>
H13 127 <h_><p_>Prohibited steps orders<p/><h/>
H13 128 <p_>2.31. Both prohibited steps orders and specific issues orders 
H13 129 are concerned with 'single issues' and are modelled on the wardship 
H13 130 jurisdiction. The purpose of the prohibited steps order, however, 
H13 131 is to impose a <tf|>specific restriction on the exercise of 
H13 132 parental responsibility instead of the vague requirement in 
H13 133 wardship that no 'important step' be taken in respect of the child 
H13 134 without the court's consent. It could, for example, be used to 
H13 135 prohibit a child's removal from the country where no residence 
H13 136 order has been made and therefore no automatic restriction on 
H13 137 removal applies or to prevent the child's removal from his home 
H13 138 before the court has had time to decide what order, if any, should 
H13 139 be made. A prohibited steps order may be made against anyone but 
H13 140 can only prohibit <quote_>"a step which could be taken by a parent 
H13 141 in meeting his parental responsibility"<quote/> for the child. It 
H13 142 could not therefore be used, for example, to restrict publicity 
H13 143 about a child since this is not within the scope of parental 
H13 144 responsibility.<p/>
H13 145 <h_><p_>Specific issue orders<p/><h/>
H13 146 <p_>2.32. Specific issue orders may be made in conjunction with 
H13 147 residence or contact orders or on their own. The aim, however, is 
H13 148 not to give one parent or the other a general 'right' to make 
H13 149 decisions about a particular aspect of the child's upbringing, for 
H13 150 example his education or medical treatment, but rather to enable a 
H13 151 particular dispute over such a matter to be resolved by the court, 
H13 152 including the giving of detailed directions where necessary.<p/>
H13 153 <p_>2.33. Although wardship will still be an available option in 
H13 154 private disputes, the intention is that its use by individuals will 
H13 155 be greatly reduced by the introduction of prohibited steps and 
H13 156 specific issues orders. Local authority use of wardship has been 
H13 157 severely restricted by section 100, which provides that the 
H13 158 jurisdiction cannot be used for the purpose of placing a child in 
H13 159 care, or in local authority accommodation, or under the supervision 
H13 160 of a local authority (section 100(2) and paragraph 3.98 below). 
H13 161 Local authorities will, like anyone else, be able to apply for 
H13 162 specific issue and prohibited steps orders, provided that they 
H13 163 first obtain the court's leave (see paragraph 2.43 below). This 
H13 164 will enable them to resolve certain issues which at present can 
H13 165 only be resolved by making the child a ward of court, such as 
H13 166 whether or not he should have a particular operation. They may 
H13 167 arise where a child is accommodated voluntarily by the authority, 
H13 168 is felt to be in need of a particular course of treatment urgently 
H13 169 and the parents cannot be contacted. If, in all the circumstances 
H13 170 of the case, the decision is likely to cause controversy at some 
H13 171 future date, the local authority should seek a section 8 specific 
H13 172 issue order. Local authorities will not, however, be able to do 
H13 173 this if the child is subject to a care order, as the only section 8 
H13 174 order which may be made in such cases is a residence order. Nor can 
H13 175 they apply for a prohibited steps or specific issue order as a way 
H13 176 of obtaining the care or supervision of a child, nor to obtain an 
H13 177 order that the child be accommodated by them, nor can a prohibited 
H13 178 steps or specific issue order confer any aspect of parental 
H13 179 responsibility upon an authority (section 9(5)(b)).<p/>
H13 180 <p_>2.34. Similarly, a prohibited steps or specific issue order may 
H13 181 not be made <quote_>"with a view to achieving a result which could 
H13 182 be achieved by making a residence or contact order"<quote/> 
H13 183 (section 9(5)(a)). This is to avoid either of these orders being 
H13 184 used to achieve much the same practical results as residence and 
H13 185 contact orders but without the same legal effects.<p/>

H14  92 the requested Party;<p/>
H14  93 <p_>(b) the request seeks restraint or confiscation of proceeds of 
H14  94 an activity, not being an activity referred to in Article 2(a) of 
H14  95 this Agreement, which, had it occurred within the jurisdiction of 
H14  96 the requested Party, would not have been an offence, or would not 
H14  97 have been an activity in respect of which a confiscation order 
H14  98 could have been made; or<p/>
H14  99 <p_>(c) the request relates to an offence in respect of which the 
H14 100 person has been finally acquitted or pardoned, or has served any 
H14 101 sentence imposed and any order made as a result of the conviction

H14 103 <p_>(2) Assistance may be refused if:<p/>
H14 104 <p_>(a) the requested Party is of the opinion that the request, if

H14 106 interest or other essential interest; or<p/>

H14 111 requested Party shall consider whether assistance may be granted

H14 121 not incompatible with that law.<p/>

H14 129 <p_>(4) The requesting Party shall promptly inform the requested

H14 260 
H14 261 
H15   1 <#FLOB:H15\><p_><tf_>Mr. A.J. Beith<tf/> (Berwick-upon-Tweed): I 
H15   2 would like to be clear about what the Chancellor is saying. Is he 
H15   3 saying that the Government will accept a single currency on 
H15   4 conditions that he can now define?<p/>
H15   5 <p_><tf_>Mr. Lamont<tf/>: The Government have made it clear that we 
H15   6 are not prepared to give a commitment to move to a single currency. We 
H15   7 believe that, if monetary union happens, it should be on an 
H15   8 evolutionary basis, driven by the market. This is and always has 
H15   9 been our position. It is the position of the Opposition that is 
H15  10 shrouded in obscurity. When we listened to the right hon. 
H15  11 Gentleman, we heard that he wants to give a commitment to a single 
H15  12 currency without any conditions whatsoever. That appears to be his 
H15  13 position.<p/>
H15  14 <p_><tf_>Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman<tf/> (Lancaster): Would my 
H15  15 right hon. Friend make it clear to the Opposition that their 
H15  16 illusion of a regional policy in an enlarged EC may be a different 
H15  17 kettle of fish from what it used to be. Few, if any, of our regions 
H15  18 would qualify for assistance under regional criteria, and 
H15  19 Opposition Members ought to know that.<p/>
H15  20 <p_><tf_>Mr. Lamont<tf/>: My hon. Friend makes a shrewd point and 
H15  21 is precisely right. Any expansion of regional policy is not likely 
H15  22 to be to the benefit of this country, and I am grateful to her for 
H15  23 drawing our attention to that fact.<p/>
H15  24 <p_>Yesterday, I announced our public spending plans for the next 
H15  25 three years. Once again, we have shown that there is no 
H15  26 contradiction between our prudent policies and high-quality public 
H15  27 services. We have honoured our commitments and allowed expenditure 
H15  28 to rise to meet the unavoidable consequences of the recession. But 
H15  29 neither spending nor the PSBR will rise to the heights of previous 
H15  30 recessions. Government expenditure will peak at 42 per cent. of 
H15  31 GDP, compared to 47.5 per cent. in 1982-83 and a skyscraping 49.25 
H15  32 per cent. - very nearly half the nation's income - under Labour.<p/>
H15  33 <p_>We remain committed to balancing the budget over the economic 
H15  34 cycle. In 1987-88, we repaid debt equivalent to 3 per cent. of GDP, 
H15  35 comparable to our assumption next year of a 3 per cent. PSBR. 
H15  36 Compare that with Labour's peak of 9.5 per cent. - the equivalent 
H15  37 of pounds55 billion today.<p/>
H15  38 <p_>Our objective remains to balance the budget over the cycle. 
H15  39 Just imagine how preposterous a goal that would be for the right 
H15  40 hon. and learned Gentleman to state. Even yesterday, he wanted more 
H15  41 money for training, for transport and for industry. Now that he has 
H15  42 had a day to reflect, the whole House will be waiting for his 
H15  43 answer to some vital questions. Does he accept the pledges made by 
H15  44 Opposition spokesmen to spend more than we plan to? How would he 
H15  45 pay for them? [HON. MEMBERS: <quote|>"Answer."]<p/>
H15  46 <p_>Let us start with the National Health Service. I announced an 
H15  47 increase in plans of pounds1.5 billion for the NHS - pounds1.5 
H15  48 billion which will help the NHS upgrade buildings and hospital 
H15  49 equipment. Spending on hospital and community health services will 
H15  50 rise by more than 5 per cent. in real terms between this year and 
H15  51 next, bringing the total real increase in NHS spending since 1979 
H15  52 to well over 50 per cent. We could not have made our commitment to 
H15  53 the NHS clearer. What a contrast with the Labour party - the party 
H15  54 that cut nurses' pay and, in one year, cut NHS capital spending - 
H15  55 hospital building - by 22 per cent. Fine words but poor action from 
H15  56 the Labour party. So would the right hon. and learned Gentleman 
H15  57 spend more? Now is his chance to tell us how much. [HON. MEMBERS: 
H15  58 <quote|>"Answer."]<p/>
H15  59 <p_>We also announced an extra pounds1.4 billion for British Rail 
H15  60 and London Transport. Next year they will invest more than three 
H15  61 times as much as they did in 1979. If the right hon. and learned 
H15  62 Gentleman were standing here, would he spend more? His hon. Friend 
H15  63 the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) would like 
H15  64 to, but would he? Now is his chance to tell us how much. [HON. 
H15  65 MEMBERS: <quote|>"Answer."]<p/>
H15  66 <p_>What about education? We have more students in higher education 
H15  67 than ever before. Pupil-teacher ratios in our classrooms are at 
H15  68 their lowest ever, and spending per pupil is up more than 40 per 
H15  69 cent. The leader of the Opposition plucked a figure 
H15  70 <}_><-|>our<+|>out<}/> of the air and said that he would spend 
H15  71 pounds2.6 billion more. We he licensed to do that?<&|>sic! Would 
H15  72 the right hon. and learned Gentleman give him the money? If he 
H15  73 would, how much? [HON. MEMBERS: <quote|>"Answer."]<p/>
H15  74 <p_>Next year, the aid budget will increase by 2 per cent. in real 
H15  75 terms. Again that is not good enough for the hon. Member for Cynon 
H15  76 Valley (Mrs. Clwyd). She wants to put it up in a single Parliament 
H15  77 by more than pounds3 billion. Would the right hon. and learned 
H15  78 Gentleman give her the money? Now is his chance to tell us. How 
H15  79 much? [HON. MEMBERS: <quote|>"Answer."]<p/>
H15  80 <p_>In April, the right hon. and learned Gentleman published what 
H15  81 he called a shadow Budget. Why does not he publish a shadow autumn 
H15  82 statement? Then he could give us the answers. He must tell us this; 
H15  83 is the level of spending that we have announced too high, too low 
H15  84 or just about right? Is the level of borrowing too high, too low or 
H15  85 just about right? We have set out our expenditure plans for the 
H15  86 next three years, on which we shall fight the election. The country 
H15  87 wants the same from the Labour party.<p/>
H15  88 <p_>In the document 'Meet the Challenge, Make the Change' the 
H15  89 Labour party promised that it would publish its detailed spending 
H15  90 plans at the time of the election. <}_><-|>now<+|>Now<}/> that the 
H15  91 election is a little closer, the hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. 
H15  92 Cunningham) tells us that it will not publish its plans. What is 
H15  93 the Labour party hiding? We know what it is hiding: the cost of 
H15  94 unaffordable spending plans and the massive increases in taxation 
H15  95 that it knows are needed to pay for them.<p/>
H15  96 <p_>We have costed the hundreds of pledges made by the right hon. 
H15  97 and learned Gentleman and his colleagues, and we know that they add 
H15  98 up to pounds35 billion. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has 
H15  99 never quarrelled with the detail of any of our estimates. The 
H15 100 pounds35 billion of extra spending means pounds35 billion of extra 
H15 101 tax - perhaps not right away. Perhaps he would try to borrow some 
H15 102 more, but he could not delay the evil day for long. Eventually, it 
H15 103 would mean skyscraping taxes, not only for the better-off, but for 
H15 104 everybody. The right hon. and learned Gentleman always forgets that 
H15 105 what the Government give, they first must take away, and a Labour 
H15 106 Government would take away a lot from the British people.<p/>
H15 107 <p_>The right hon. and learned Gentleman claims that he would get 
H15 108 the money from growth. We have heard that one before. That is what 
H15 109 Labour Oppositions always say, but Labour Governments always fail 
H15 110 to deliver, because their policies of intervention and regulation 
H15 111 throttle recovery. Growth would peter out under Labour.<p/>
H15 112 <p_>Even if Labour could somehow spend the growth created by 
H15 113 Conservative policies, the right hon. and learned Gentleman still 
H15 114 would not have the money. He clearly has not read the public 
H15 115 expenditure plans any more carefully than he has read the forecast. 
H15 116 The plans that we have published for the next three years already 
H15 117 take account of growth. Those plans are consistent with our 
H15 118 objective of balancing the budget over the medium term. If the 
H15 119 right hon. and learned Gentleman wants to spend more, he must 
H15 120 either borrow more, or tax more, or both.<p/>
H15 121 <p_>The British people have seen through Labour's deceit. They know 
H15 122 what a Labour Government would mean. Since the war, living 
H15 123 standards have risen half again as fast under Conservative 
H15 124 Governments as under Labour. Since 1979, living standards have 
H15 125 risen by almost 37 per cent. We have cut income tax rates. The 
H15 126 plans that I announced yesterday show that, even when times are 
H15 127 difficult, we will continue to improve public services and to 
H15 128 honour our commitments.<p/>
H15 129 <p_>It is this argument that leads to the right hon. and learned 
H15 130 Gentleman's increasing desperation - a desperation that manifests 
H15 131 itself in his peculiar determination never to have one consistent 
H15 132 policy when he can have two contradictory ones. He thinks that we 
H15 133 should cut interest rates further and faster; but at the same time 
H15 134 says that we should stay in the exchange rate mechanism. We know 
H15 135 that it is our cautious approach that has enabled us to cut 
H15 136 interest rates and keep the pound stable. He wants to increase 
H15 137 spending; but he claims that he will not put up taxes: We know that 
H15 138 it is our firm control of public spending that has enabled us to 
H15 139 cut tax rates. He says that we should improve competitiveness and 
H15 140 strengthen the supply side; but he wants to introduce a minimum 
H15 141 wage and bury business under a mountain of bureaucracy. We know 
H15 142 that low inflation and a more flexible labour market is the way to 
H15 143 create wealth and jobs. He says that there is no recovery. A few 
H15 144 weeks ago on the radio, he said that the recovery would be weak and 
H15 145 faltering. His right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has 
H15 146 told us that the recovery is heading for an inflationary boom. We 
H15 147 know we are headed for sustained, non-inflationary growth.<p/>
H15 148 <p_>A Labour Government would bring higher taxes, higher inflation, 
H15 149 higher interest rates and higher unemployment. Their policies would 
H15 150 leave the nation with no prospect of economic recovery and no hope 
H15 151 of improving the public services. This Government are dedicated to 
H15 152 a sustainable, economic recovery based on stable, low inflation.<p/>
H15 153 <p_>We are dedicated to a tax system that gives people the 
H15 154 incentive to work and the opportunity to save. We are dedicated to 
H15 155 using the fruits of these policies to improve the public services 
H15 156 of the nation - not only providing our health, education and 
H15 157 transport systems with increased resources, but securing improved 
H15 158 performance from them.<p/>
H15 159 <p_>This Government's objectives are shared by the nation, and the 
H15 160 economic policy which serves those objectives deserves the support 
H15 161 of this House. I ask the House to reject the amendment and to 
H15 162 support the Loyal Address.<p/>
H15 163 <p_>5.18 pm<p/>
H15 164 <p_><tf_>Mr. A.J. Beith<tf/> (Berwick-upon-Tweed): There could 
H15 165 hardly be more of a contrast between this year's debate on the 
H15 166 Loyal Address and our debate last year. Hon. Members may have 
H15 167 forgotten in the interval what happened.<p/>
H15 168 <p_>Last year's debate was marked by a speech by the right hon. and 
H15 169 learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe), who was in the 
H15 170 Chamber a moment ago, rather like Banquo's ghost, but has 
H15 171 disappeared, in rather the same way. That speech was probably one 
H15 172 of the most dramatic and remarkable, although it was quiet in 
H15 173 delivery, that many of us have heard in the whole of our time in 
H15 174 this House, because it was the undoing of a Prime Minister.<p/>
H15 175 <p_>The speech pointed to the impossibility of papering together 
H15 176 deep divisions over Europe by the use of sophisticated language. It 
H15 177 blew open those divisions, but did not stop the present Prime 
H15 178 Minister saying, when he spoke as Chancellor in that debate:<p/>
H15 179 <p_><quote_>"I believe that they will vote for the consistency, 
H15 180 courage and conviction with which my right hon. Friend the Prime 
H15 181 Minister has led this country so successfully for so long."<quote/> 
H15 182 - [<tf_>Official Report<tf/>, 14 November 1990; Vol. 180, c. 
H15 183 599.]<p/>
H15 184 <p_>Conservative Members did not wait to find out whether people 
H15 185 would vote for that courage and conviction, but bundled out the 
H15 186 then Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. 
H15 187 Thatcher) pretty quickly once they had had the encouragement of a 
H15 188 Liberal Democrat by-election win and the exposure of the divisions 
H15 189 by the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East.<p/>
H15 190 <p_>In the same debate, the then Chancellor forecast the same 
H15 191 growth that has been forecast today - a growth that did not happen. 
H15 192 It was the beginning of the protracted end of the Government. The 
H15 193 next stage in that process has been a Gracious Speech full of 
H15 194 apologies.

H16   1 <#FLOB:H16\><p_><tf_>Mr. Gummer:<tf/> I refer my hon. Friend to the 
H16   2 reply I gave earlier today to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham 
H16   3 (Mr. Carrington).<p/>
H16   4 <p_><tf_>Mr. Harry Greenway:<tf/> To ask the Minister of 
H16   5 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a further statement 
H16   6 on the recent agreement in the Farm Council on the transport of 
H16   7 horses and other animals.<p/>
H16   8 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maclean:<tf/> The directive on protection of animals 
H16   9 during transport has now been adopted formally by the Council and 
H16  10 will be published shortly. The agreement reflects the deep public 
H16  11 concern in this country over the transport of horses and other 
H16  12 animals and the Government are grateful to all those who gave 
H16  13 support in the negotiations by making their views known to the 
H16  14 Commission and throughout the Community.<p/>
H16  15 <h_><p_>Fishing Grounds (Pollution)<p/><h/>
H16  16 <p_>28. <tf_>Dr. Kim Howells<tf/> To ask the Minister of 
H16  17 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what measures are being taken to 
H16  18 safeguard fishing grounds from pollution originating offshore.<p/>
H16  19 <p_><tf_>Mr. Curry:<tf/> This Ministry works closely with other 
H16  20 Departments in operating a comprehensive range of measures under 
H16  21 the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971 and the Food and 
H16  22 Environment Protection Act 1985 to protect fisheries, and the 
H16  23 marine environment generally, from pollution originating 
H16  24 offshore.<p/>
H16  25 <h_><p_>State Veterinary Service<p/><h/>
H16  26 <p_><tf_>Mr. McAvoy:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16  27 Fisheries and Food when he last met the British Veterinary 
H16  28 Association to discuss the future of the state veterinary 
H16  29 service.<p/>
H16  30 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maclean:<tf/> My right hon. Friend the Minister has 
H16  31 not met the British Veterinary Association specifically to discuss 
H16  32 the future of the state veterinary service.<p/>
H16  33 <p_>However, Ministers and officials have regular contact with the 
H16  34 association and its representatives on a wide range of issues.<p/>
H16  35 <h_><p_>Agriculture Council<p/><h/>
H16  36 <p_><tf_>Mr. Bellingham:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16  37 Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the outcome of 
H16  38 the Agriculture Council held on 18 and 19 November.<p/>
H16  39 <p_><tf_>Mr. Gummer:<tf/> I represented the United Kingdom at this 
H16  40 meeting of the Council together with my hon. Friend the Member for 
H16  41 Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), the Parliamentary Secretary in my 
H16  42 Department.<p/>
H16  43 <p_>There was a discussion of the significant progress that has 
H16  44 been made recently in the discussions towards an agricultural 
H16  45 agreement in GATT. I stressed that genuine reform required 
H16  46 reductions in support over time whatever form such support took, 
H16  47 with only genuine environmental and similar measures being exempted 
H16  48 from the process of reduction. I urged the Commissioner to 
H16  49 negotiate accordingly. Unfortunately he seems to take the view at 
H16  50 present that only direct price support need be subject to reduction 
H16  51 and in particular that any compensation for such reductions need 
H16  52 not be reduced. We shall continue to press our view.<p/>
H16  53 <p_>There were detailed discussions on the arable, tobacco and 
H16  54 sheepmeat dossiers included in the proposed reforms of the common 
H16  55 agricultural policy. On the arable dossier I stressed that payments 
H16  56 on set-aside land must not discriminate against larger producers. 
H16  57 On tobacco we urged the need to scale down support significantly 
H16  58 consistent with the Community's position on health issues. On 
H16  59 sheepmeat, I said that the proposed reductions in headage limits - 
H16  60 maximum payments per producer - were unacceptable to the United 
H16  61 Kingdom and urged that savings be made instead by price cuts or 
H16  62 other means. Discussion will resume at the next meeting on 11-12 
H16  63 December.<p/>
H16  64 <h_><p_>Veterinary Products<p/><h/>
H16  65 <p_><tf_>Dr. David Clark:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16  66 Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement about the technical 
H16  67 competence of the Veterinary Products Committee and of the EC 
H16  68 Veterinary Products Committee to judge the safety and human health 
H16  69 aspects of the use of veterinary products.<p/>
H16  70 <p_><tf_>Mr.Gummer:<tf/> Members of the Veterinary Products 
H16  71 Committee are expert in a number of scientific disciplines relevant 
H16  72 to the consideration of the safety, quality and efficacy of 
H16  73 veterinary medicines. When aspects falling outside their specific 
H16  74 fields of expertise arise, they take advice from the Department of 
H16  75 Health and other suitably qualified experts. Apart from the 
H16  76 Medicines Commission, we are satisfied that no other body of 
H16  77 equivalent competence exists in this country.<p/>
H16  78 <p_>Members of the EC Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products 
H16  79 are officials from member states. They are not required to have 
H16  80 personal scientific expertise in the same way as VPC members, but 
H16  81 draw on expertise available in all member states, including that of 
H16  82 the Veterinary Products Committee.<p/>
H16  83 <h_><p_>Poultry (Rare Breeds)<p/><h/>
H16  84 <p_><tf_>Mr. Ron Davies:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16  85 Fisheries and Food if he will amend the poultry regulations to 
H16  86 ensure that rare breeds, housed and kept separately for breeding 
H16  87 purposes, are defined as individual flocks.<p/>
H16  88 <p_><tf_>Mr. Curry:<tf/> I have no plans to do so.<p/>
H16  89 <h_><p_>Milk Production<p/><h/>
H16  90 <p_><tf_>Mr. Strang:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16  91 Fisheries and Food what is his latest estimate of the total volume 
H16  92 of United Kingdom milk production last year; and what proportion 
H16  93 this represents of total EC milk production.<p/>
H16  94 <p_><tf_>Mr. Curry:<tf/> Total United Kingdom milk production, 
H16  95 including milk fed directly to calves, was estimated at 15,212,000 
H16  96 tonnes during 1990, 13 per cent. of the EC total. Deliveries to 
H16  97 dairies amounted to 14,574,000 tonnes, 13.75 per cent. of the EC 
H16  98 total.<p/>
H16  99 <h_><p_>Animals and Birds (Imports)<p/><h/>
H16 100 <p_><tf_>Mr. Cohen:<tf/> To ask the Minster of Agriculture, 
H16 101 Fisheries and Food what steps he has taken in the light of 
H16 102 recommendations by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee to 
H16 103 restrict the number of United Kingdom ports through which live 
H16 104 animals and birds may be imported.<p/>
H16 105 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maclean:<tf/> The recommendation to consider 
H16 106 restricting the number of ports through which live animals may be 
H16 107 imported was one of a number of recommendations made by the Joint 
H16 108 Nature Conservation Committee in its recent report on trade in 
H16 109 wildlife. As the wildlife trade raises many complex issues which do 
H16 110 not affect the United Kingdom alone, my hon. Friend the 
H16 111 Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment and I 
H16 112 wrote recently to the European Commissioners for agriculture and 
H16 113 the environment drawing the JNCC report to their attention and 
H16 114 pressing for stricter Community-wide controls over international 
H16 115 trade in wildlife. A Commission proposal for a new regulation on 
H16 116 the wildlife trade is expected to be published soon and we shall 
H16 117 take full account of the JNCC advice in the subsequent 
H16 118 discussions.<p/>
H16 119 <h_><p_>Bovine Somatotropin<p/><h/>
H16 120 <p_><tf_>Dr. David Clark:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16 121 Fisheries and Food what tests have been carried out by his Ministry 
H16 122 concerning the safety of bovine somatotropin and food products 
H16 123 derived from it for humans; and if he will make a statement.<p/>
H16 124 <p_><tf_>Mr Gummer:<tf/> It is for licence applicants to undertake, 
H16 125 in accordance with internationally accepted rules of good 
H16 126 laboratory practice, all tests which are considered necessary to 
H16 127 satisfy the licensing authority.<p/>
H16 128 <p_><tf_>Dr. David Clark:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16 129 Fisheries and Food how many applications for the use of bovine 
H16 130 somatotropin he has received in each of the last three years and to 
H16 131 date in 1991; if he will indicate in each case whether the 
H16 132 applications have been refused, and how many are going through 
H16 133 appeal; and if he will make a statement.<p/>
H16 134 <p_><tf_>Mr Gummer:<tf/> No product licence applications were 
H16 135 received during this period. One application for an animal test 
H16 136 certificate was received in 1988: that application is currently the 
H16 137 subject of an appeal to the Veterinary Products Committee which is 
H16 138 minded to advise that it should not be granted.<p/>
H16 139 <p_>In addition, applications to renew ATCs granted before 1988 
H16 140 were received in each of the years identified, and were granted. 
H16 141 Applications to vary these ATCs were received in 1988, two; 1989, 
H16 142 nine; 1990 seven; and 1991 to date, four; and have been granted.<p/>
H16 143 <p_><tf_>Dr. David Clark:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16 144 Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement about the 
H16 145 discussions in the EC about the continuation of the moratorium on 
H16 146 the use of bovine somatotropin after 31 December; and when he 
H16 147 expects a decision to be taken about its continuation.<p/>
H16 148 <p_><tf_>Mr. Gummer:<tf/> Progress made by the Commission with its 
H16 149 report on the future use of BST was raised under other business at 
H16 150 the Agriculture Council on 18-19 November. The Commission indicated 
H16 151 that it expects to report to the Council within the next few 
H16 152 weeks.<p/>
H16 153 <p_><tf_> Dr. David Clark:<tf/> To ask the Minster of Agriculture, 
H16 154 Fisheries and Food if he will list the research that has been 
H16 155 considered by the Veterinary Products Committee concerning the 
H16 156 effect of food produced by the use of bovine somatotropin on human 
H16 157 health; and if he will make a statement.<p/>
H16 158 <p_><tf_>Mr. Gummer:<tf/> The Committee has seen the results of 
H16 159 research into the composition of milk from treated and untreated 
H16 160 cows which identified minute differences in the average content of 
H16 161 lipids, biotin, IGF1 and BST. It has also seen the results of 
H16 162 research into the effect of these four substances on humans and has 
H16 163 taken advice from nutritional experts. It is satisfied that the 
H16 164 widespread use of BST to increase milk yields would not adversely 
H16 165 affect the health of consumers.<p/>
H16 166 <p_><tf_>Mr Ron Davies:<tf/> To ask the Minster of Agriculture, 
H16 167 Fisheries and Food what is his policy on the possible extension of 
H16 168 the present EC ban on bovine somatotropin; and when he expects the 
H16 169 matter to be further discussed at the Council of Ministers.<p/>
H16 170 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maclean:<tf/> The Commission has made no proposals for 
H16 171 arrangements to apply after the current moratorium on the use of 
H16 172 BST expires. If it does, my right hon. Friend will determine his 
H16 173 policy according to the merit of the proposals. Progress made by 
H16 174 the Commission with its report on the future use of BST was raised 
H16 175 under other business at the Agriculture Council on 18-19 November. 
H16 176 The Commission indicated that it expected to report to the Council 
H16 177 within the next few weeks.<p/>
H16 178 <h_><p_>Fishing Vessels<p/><h/>
H16 179 <p_><tf_>Mr. Cohen:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16 180 Fisheries and Food whether he will state the number of draft 
H16 181 proposals he has received from sea fisheries committees to regulate 
H16 182 the use of fixed engines and the number he rejected in respect of 
H16 183 the last 12 months for which data are available.<p/>
H16 184 <p_><tf_>Mr. Curry<tf/> Ministerial confirmation has been sought 
H16 185 for three byelaws made by sea fisheries committees to regulate the 
H16 186 placing or use of fixed engines. One needs to be re-advertised and 
H16 187 we are in active correspondence with the relevant SFC on the other 
H16 188 two on drafting and procedural points respectively. None has been 
H16 189 rejected.<p/>
H16 190 <h_><p_>'Our Farming Future'<p/><h/>
H16 191 <p_><tf_>Dr. David Clark:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16 192 Fisheries and Food how he intends to distribute copies of 'Our 
H16 193 Farming Future' to individual farmers; mad if he will make a 
H16 194 statement.<p/>
H16 195 <p_><tf_>Mr. Gummer:<tf/> Copies of 'Our Farming Future' are 
H16 196 available to farmers on request from the Ministry, particularly 
H16 197 through its regional and divisional offices. Copies have also been 
H16 198 provided to the National Farmers Union.<p/>
H16 199 <p_><tf_>Dr. David Clark:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16 200 Fisheries and Food when he intends to publish the follow-up to 'Our 
H16 201 Farming Future'; and if he will make a statement.<p/>
H16 202 <p_><tf_>Mr. Gummer:<tf/> Decisions on any future statements of 
H16 203 Government policy on agriculture will be taken in the light of the 
H16 204 outcome of negotiations on CAP reform and on the Uruguay round.<p/>
H16 205 <h_><p_>Environmental Health<p/><h/>
H16 206 <p_><tf_>Ms. Walley:<tf/> To ask the Minister of Agriculture, 
H16 207 Fisheries and Food if he will meet the Institution of Environmental 
H16 208 Health Officers to discuss whether meat inspection should remain a 
H16 209 local authority function.<p/>
H16 210 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maclean:<tf/> Our officials and those of the 
H16 211 Department of Health are in regular contact with representatives of 
H16 212 the institution, and have on a number of occasions discussed with 
H16 213 them the future arrangements for meat hygiene enforcement. In 
H16 214 addition, the institution has submitted written evidence to the 
H16 215 review of meat hygiene enforcement in Great Britain and was 
H16 216 represented on the review consultative panel. The views of the 
H16 217 institution will be taken fully into account by the Agriculture and 
H16 218 Health Ministers when a decision is reached on future meat hygiene 
H16 219 enforcement arrangements.<p/>
H16 220 <h_><p_>Dairy Industry<p/><h/>
H16 221 <p_><tf_>Mr. Geraint Howells:<tf/> To ask the Minister of 
H16 222 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he is satisfied with the present 
H16 223 state of the dairy industry; and if he will make a statement.<p/>
H16 224 <p_><tf_>Mr. Curry:<tf/> Dairy farming remains a relatively 
H16 225 profitable sector of United Kingdom agriculture, sustained by 
H16 226 support prices substantially above world market levels. Despite the 
H16 227 existence of quotas limiting production, more than 20 per cent. of 
H16 228 EC milk production in 1990 required subsidised disposal.
H16 229 
H17   1 <#FLOB:H17\><p_>Access is another important principle of the 
H17   2 citizens charter. Services should be run to suit the convenience of 
H17   3 customers, not of staff. Services should be easy to find and to 
H17   4 use. That means flexible opening hours to suit local users, 
H17   5 telephones that are answered promptly, inquiry points that are 
H17   6 helpful, informative and efficient in directing the caller to the 
H17   7 person best placed to help him or her, and signposts to help the 
H17   8 citizen locate whatever he or she wants.<p/>
H17   9 <p_>Inevitably, there will be times when things do not go right. 
H17  10 When that happens, it is not a question of simply saying that money 
H17  11 should be poured into the organisation as a remedy. One of our 
H17  12 primary responsibilities as a Government is to the taxpayer, and we 
H17  13 will not neglect that responsibility. When things go wrong, the 
H17  14 citizen wants to be told fully, honestly and, preferably, there and 
H17  15 then why it has gone wrong.<p/>
H17  16 <p_>For example, most people will not mind waiting a few extra 
H17  17 minutes in a hospital waiting room if they know that the doctor has 
H17  18 been called away to deal with an emergency. They will not put up 
H17  19 with simply being left without being told the reason for being 
H17  20 apparently let down. When things go wrong, people want an apology 
H17  21 properly expressed, and they should be entitled to one. There 
H17  22 should be a well-publicised and readily available complaints 
H17  23 procedure. Lessons should be learned from complaints, so that 
H17  24 mistakes are not repeated.<p/>
H17  25 <p_>People want to have the sense, when things go wrong, and they 
H17  26 complain legitimately, that the system about which they are 
H17  27 complaining is taking some notice of what they are saying. No one 
H17  28 wants to see money diverted from service improvement to the 
H17  29 detriment of the existing service, but where compensation can be 
H17  30 made to increase rather than detract from efficiency, compensation 
H17  31 procedures should be set out.<p/>
H17  32 <p_>I make no apology for setting out in such detail the charter's 
H17  33 principles. They are important, and together they form the charter 
H17  34 standard. How are the public to know who has adopted those 
H17  35 principles and is improving services as a result? Organisations 
H17  36 that can prove that they are living up to the charter standard and 
H17  37 are providing high-quality services that put the customer first 
H17  38 will become eligible for the Charter Mark award. This voluntary 
H17  39 scheme will be an acknowledged and easily recognisable sign of 
H17  40 quality. It will provide an incentive to staff and management alike 
H17  41 to bring about a progressive improvement in the delivery and 
H17  42 quality of their services and to provide value for money through 
H17  43 progressive improvements in service.<p/>
H17  44 <p_>Every public sector organisation that serves the public 
H17  45 directly will be able to apply for the Charter Mark. So, too, will 
H17  46 privatised utilities, such as the water companies or similar 
H17  47 regulator regimes. The award will be within every organisation's 
H17  48 reach, but not necessarily within immediate grasp. It will not be a 
H17  49 soft or easy option. I look forward to announcing the details of 
H17  50 the scheme before long.<p/>
H17  51 <p_>The implementation of the charter is an ambitious task. It is a 
H17  52 programme which has set a lead. No programme so ambitious or 
H17  53 comprehensive has ever been attempted anywhere in the world. Great 
H17  54 interest in the charter has been shown in Europe, north America, 
H17  55 Australia, and elsewhere. We are determined to implement it 
H17  56 successfully. I pay tribute to Sir James Blythe and his fellow 
H17  57 members of the advisory panel for their energetic and imaginative 
H17  58 work in driving the programme forward.<p/>
H17  59 <p_>The real results are the improvements that take place on the 
H17  60 ground locally. It is in the local tax office, the local hospital 
H17  61 and the local school that the citizen will look for improvements 
H17  62 and judge whether the charter is a reality.<p/>
H17  63 <p_>Much has already happened. The next steps programme has played 
H17  64 an important part. In the case of the Benefits Agency, for example, 
H17  65 more telephone calls than previously have been handle in five 
H17  66 languages with specialist help lines, and waiting times have been 
H17  67 reduced by half. The Employment Service achieved more than 95 per 
H17  68 cent. accuracy in its benefits payments in 1990-91. It is 
H17  69 integrating its local office network with benefit offices, to offer 
H17  70 users a one-stop shop. For example, at the Driving Standards 
H17  71 Agency, waiting times for driving tests have been reduced.<p/>
H17  72 <p_>Another example of what has started to happen and will happen 
H17  73 under the citizens charter programme is that, in the national 
H17  74 health service, there will be fixed-time appointments for patients 
H17  75 from April next. No patient should have to wait more than 30 
H17  76 minutes. We want to say a final goodbye to the old arrangement 
H17  77 whereby 50 patients were called for appointments at 9 o'clock in 
H17  78 the morning but many of them were not seen until well into the 
H17  79 afternoon. That is no way to treat people. The patients charter 
H17  80 will put an end to it.<p/>
H17  81 <p_>There will also be guaranteed waiting times for NHS treatment. 
H17  82 Each district health authority will set maximum waiting times for 
H17  83 each specialty, and none of the maximum times can be more than two 
H17  84 years. Once again, waiting times should come down and people should 
H17  85 know they can expect, what standard the local provider of that 
H17  86 service has undertaken to deliver.<p/>
H17  87 <p_>All parents will receive school reports on their child's 
H17  88 progress at least once a year. In the utilities, to take two 
H17  89 examples, East Midlands Electricity has introduced fixed-time 
H17  90 appointments for customers, and SEEBoard has introduced a new, 
H17  91 simple, flat-rate compensation system for its customers.<p/>
H17  92 <p_>We have also taken steps to introduce legislation, where 
H17  93 needed, to take forward work on the charter. The Competition and 
H17  94 Services (Utilities) Bill, published last week, will give customers 
H17  95 a better deal by giving tougher powers to the regulators - allowing 
H17  96 them, for example, to set guaranteed service standards for 
H17  97 individual customers, such as fixed appointment times - no more 
H17  98 waiting for the gas man.<p/>
H17  99 <p_>The regulators will also be able to ensure that compensation is 
H17 100 paid where those service standards are not met, that each utility 
H17 101 has satisfactory procedures for handling customer complaints and 
H17 102 that those procedures are published. As the utilities operate in 
H17 103 the private sector, they are already going fast down that track of 
H17 104 improving customer services. We want that to continue.<p/>
H17 105 <p_>The Local Government Bill, published on 4 November, will 
H17 106 require local authorities to publish information showing what 
H17 107 standard of service they are providing and at what cost. The Audit 
H17 108 Commission and its Scottish equivalent will have powers to report 
H17 109 on the performance of local authorities both individually and 
H17 110 collectively, to which all local authorities would have to respond 
H17 111 publicly.<p/>
H17 112 <p_>The Education (Schools) Bill sets up a framework to implement 
H17 113 the main proposals of the parents charter, published in September. 
H17 114 It will ensure regular and independent inspection of schools, and 
H17 115 that the inspection report is made available to parents. It will 
H17 116 empower the Secretary of State to collect and publish information 
H17 117 about schools. That will be published annually by region and will 
H17 118 include public examination and national curriculum test results, 
H17 119 truancy rates and the first destinations of school leavers. That is 
H17 120 all vital information that parents are entitled to have. Under the 
H17 121 legislation, in future they will have it.<p/>
H17 122 <p_>I shall shortly publish a White Paper entitled, 'Competing for 
H17 123 Quality' which sets out the Government's commitment to improving 
H17 124 public services by expanding choice and competition. That is a key 
H17 125 element of the citizens charter programme. It sets out how, in 
H17 126 setting targets and freeing managers to buy services in open 
H17 127 competition, public services can respond better and more 
H17 128 efficiently to the wishes of their users. Buying services in open 
H17 129 competition is good news for the taxpayers, who will get better 
H17 130 value for money, and for managers and their staff, who can work 
H17 131 together to achieve the best deal for customers. Last, but by no 
H17 132 means least, it is good news for local businesses, giving private 
H17 133 firms new opportunities to market their services in free and open 
H17 134 competition.<p/>
H17 135 <p_>Other legislation will be needed, too, to take forward the 
H17 136 proposals outlined in the charter White Paper. When we are returned 
H17 137 to government, we shall introduce legislation to give the citizen a 
H17 138 right to challenge unlawful industrial action affecting public 
H17 139 services, and legislation to privatise the railways and to 
H17 140 deregulate London buses. We also plan to limit the Post Office 
H17 141 monopoly, to establish a new regulator for postal services, and to 
H17 142 give the Secretary of State powers to set standards and targets for 
H17 143 the Post Office. We plan to extend delegation in the civil service 
H17 144 and to deal with the problems of technical redundancy.<p/>
H17 145 <p_><tf_>Mr. Malcolm Bruce<tf/> (Gordon): Am I to read into what 
H17 146 the Minister says that the Government intend to put more and more 
H17 147 services out to arm's-length agencies which are not effectively 
H17 148 accountable to Ministers, and certainly not accountable to Members 
H17 149 of the House? Does he not think that the citizens of Britain 
H17 150 wouldbe better served if Ministers were more prepared to answer the 
H17 151 questions asked by the House, rather than avoiding them by putting 
H17 152 everything out to agencies?<p/>
H17 153 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maude:<tf/> The hon. Gentleman betrays a woeful 
H17 154 ignorance of how the process works. I am also interested to hear 
H17 155 the devotion of the new-style modern Liberal Democrats to 
H17 156 old-fashioned bureaucracy.<p/>
H17 157 <p_>I commend to the House the programme of putting all the 
H17 158 executive operational parts of the public service of central 
H17 159 Government out to executive agencies under professional chief 
H17 160 executives who are directly accountable to Ministers who are 
H17 161 themselves directly accountable to the House. That will provide 
H17 162 even-better services to the public, because they are accountable 
H17 163 and because they have the freedom to manage. I make no apology for 
H17 164 that programme. I am sorry to hear once again that the Liberal 
H17 165 Democrats seem to be devoted to the process of reaction and 
H17 166 opposition to any progressive improvement or reform.<p/>
H17 167 <p_><tf_>Mr. Harry Barnes<tf/> (Derbyshire, North-East): Do we not 
H17 168 need a Members of Parliament charter, so that, when we send letters 
H17 169 to benefit agencies, instead of their taking ages to answer, we 
H17 170 will begin to get some response? It is said that the citizens 
H17 171 charter allows more information to be generally available to 
H17 172 individuals, but less and less information is available to Members 
H17 173 who ask questions in the House, as areas are hived off to agencies 
H17 174 and privatised, so that the service providers are no longer 
H17 175 democratically accountable. Democratic socialism adds parliamentary 
H17 176 accountability and parliamentary avenues.<p/>
H17 177 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maude:<tf/> Once again, I say that there will be no 
H17 178 reduction in accountability. There is an improvement in 
H17 179 transparency, and we are moving away from the old bureaucratic 
H17 180 culture to which the Opposition, whether Labour or Liberal 
H17 181 Democrat, seem devoted. We can achieve much greater accountability, 
H17 182 efficiency and effectiveness and delivering real and good services 
H17 183 to citizens by moving in the direction of open and accountable 
H17 184 executive agencies than by saying that the man in Whitehall knows 
H17 185 best, and that we shall have a nice pyramid of bureaucracy in which 
H17 186 everyone is concerned about what happens inside the organisation, 
H17 187 but fewer people are concerned with what happens when the service 
H17 188 is delivered to the citizen.<p/>
H17 189 <p_><tf_>Mr James Arbuthnot<tf/> (Wanstead and Woodford): One of 
H17 190 the agencies that serves my constituency is the social security 
H17 191 office at Wentworth house. I have to admit that, even before that 
H17 192 office became an agency, it was extremely good, and answered my 
H17 193 letters within seven days. Its benefit service was exceptional. 
H17 194 Since becoming an agency it has got even better. Payments now go 
H17 195 out within four days of a request being received. That means that 
H17 196 the office deals with the paper work, the calculation, checking and 
H17 197 the provision of a cheque within four days. That is staggering. The 
H17 198 carping from Labour Members should be put down to sour grapes, 
H17 199 because this is something that they did not think of for 
H17 200 themselves.<p/>
H17 201 <p_><tf_>Mr. Maude:<tf/> My hon. Friend's experience of the 
H17 202 improved service provided by the new agencies reflects similar, 
H17 203 widespread experience. I make no apology for saying that the 
H17 204 Government propose to press ahead full steam with the process of 
H17 205 transfering services - the operational parts of central Government 
H17 206 - to executive agencies.<p/>
H17 207 
H17 208 
H18   1 <#FLOB:H18\><p_><tf_>Mr. Illsley:<tf/> I support new clause 1 and, 
H18   2 in view of what I said in Committee, I hope to keep my remarks 
H18   3 brief.<p/>
H18   4 <p_>It is not that some authorities are profligate and overspend; 
H18   5 it is simply that the Government have imposed on them standard 
H18   6 spending assessments which are deliberately low to force them into 
H18   7 a situation where they can easily be charge-capped under the 
H18   8 Government's current criteria. In Committee, the Opposition showed 
H18   9 clearly that the SSAs bore no relation to the needs of any 
H18  10 particular authority.<p/>
H18  11 <p_>I was interested to hear the comments of the hon. Member for 
H18  12 Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) about a newspaper 
H18  13 published by the National and Local Government Officers Association 
H18  14 which I think she said was produced last September. Barnsley is 
H18  15 still making cuts as a result of last year's charge capping of 
H18  16 which the newspaper probably would not be aware.<p/>
H18  17 <p_>New clause 1 requires the Secretary of State to estimate losses 
H18  18 that are likely to be carried forward for the forthcoming year. The 
H18  19 formula as it stands in the Bill simply passes the result of any 
H18  20 charge capping on to the poll tax payer in the following financial 
H18  21 year, and no account is taken of the shortfall despite the fact 
H18  22 that that information is available at the time of the charge 
H18  23 capping. It is nonsense that the Government should force 
H18  24 authorities to issue bills which the Government and the local 
H18  25 authorities know are ridiculous because they do not take account of 
H18  26 the information that is available to the authority at the time. The 
H18  27 public do not want that shortfall being stored up for the following 
H18  28 year.<p/>
H18  29 <p_>For example, in 1990-91 Barnsley allocated 6 per cent. of its 
H18  30 poll tax bill to cover any shortfall in the collection of the tax, 
H18  31 and that was detailed on the bill. There is considerable resentment 
H18  32 among charge payers in my authority because they are expected to 
H18  33 pay pounds16.97 to cover what they look upon as defaulters. 
H18  34 Complaints to me and in the local press are now building up from 
H18  35 people who refuse to pay that sum. They will pay the rest of the 
H18  36 poll tax bill, but they are not prepared to pay for someone who 
H18  37 defaults. They do not realise that similar problems existed under 
H18  38 the rating system. This is causing problems for the local 
H18  39 authority.<p/>
H18  40 <p_>It is not just ordinary working people who object, but the 
H18  41 business community as well - perhaps more so. They tend to look on 
H18  42 people who are unable to pay as shirkers, just as Conservative 
H18  43 Members do, although that is not necessarily the case. One can 
H18  44 imagine the disgust of charge payers in my local authority if they 
H18  45 had to make up a shortfall of more than 6 per cent. That is simply 
H18  46 increasing the number of refusals to pay the poll tax and placing 
H18  47 an extra burden on the local authority. People are deciding to pay 
H18  48 simply a proportion of the poll tax and to withhold the 
H18  49 pounds16.97. Therefore, my local authority is having to send out 
H18  50 extra bills, obtain court orders and all the rest simply because 
H18  51 people are refusing to pay that 6 per cent. It shows that people do 
H18  52 not want such sums stored up for the forthcoming year but would far 
H18  53 rather have their bills sorted out logically in the current year 
H18  54 when the capping is implemented.<p/>
H18  55 <p_>If the Secretary of State is required to lay such an estimate 
H18  56 of losses, the local authority can identify what it will be 
H18  57 required to make up in the following year. It is obviously sensible 
H18  58 for a local authority which knows that it will be short on its 
H18  59 collection funds to take that into account at the time of capping. 
H18  60 It is crazy simply to tell local authorities that, although it is 
H18  61 known that they have a 10 per cent. shortfall in their collection 
H18  62 funds, nothing can be done about it in June, July, August or 
H18  63 September, and it must wait till the following year.<p/>
H18  64 <p_>Again, that reflects on the SSAs, which appear not to have been 
H18  65 altered to any great extent this year compared with last year. My 
H18  66 authority still has the same problems and we shall have similar 
H18  67 problems with capping. All we are doing is building up problems for 
H18  68 the future. We are simply creating a situation in which authorities 
H18  69 that were capped originally will be capped in the future.<p/>
H18  70 <p_>New clause 1 requires the Secretary of State to specify the 
H18  71 proposed increase in the charge. I have some sympathy with that 
H18  72 because charge payers coming to my surgeries do not want to hear 
H18  73 about aggregate external finance or increases in revenue support 
H18  74 grant which, incidentally, are about 1.9 per cent. Most of the 
H18  75 pounds3 billion spoken about this year is coming through 
H18  76 non-domestic rating, not through increases in Government grant. 
H18  77 What they want to know is what the increase will be in pounds, not 
H18  78 in percentages here, there and everywhere.<p/>
H18  79 <p_>New clause 1 also requires a schedule of reductions in 
H18  80 services. Again, I have considerable sympathy with that. I have to 
H18  81 laugh when I hear stories about whisky bottles in cupboards and all 
H18  82 the rest. It is obvious that some Conservative Members are living 
H18  83 in a dream world. My authority comes under the Audit Commission and 
H18  84 is regulated by the same legislation as are all other authorities. 
H18  85 My authority is a diligent one, which abides by the rules and 
H18  86 regulations laid down. Authorities referred to by Conservative 
H18  87 Members do not seem to come under the same legislation. Why are not 
H18  88 complaints made about those profligate authorities? Some of the 
H18  89 stories related by Conservative Members are incredible.<p/>
H18  90 <p_>When an authority sets a sensible budget and when treasurers, 
H18  91 heads of department and all the rest have spent considerable time 
H18  92 determining their budget for the coming year, agonising over it for 
H18  93 two or three months, how can they simply cut pounds10 million off 
H18  94 it, as Barnsley was required to do? Which services should be cut? 
H18  95 My area was not guilty of high spending and there was no waste, yet 
H18  96 cuts had to made in every department - small cuts here, there and 
H18  97 everywhere, except in education, where the cuts were massive. The 
H18  98 hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West, who is no longer in her 
H18  99 place, referred to authorities that had not had to make employees 
H18 100 redundant as a result of charge capping. I assure her that some 
H18 101 education centres in Barnsley were closed as a direct result of 
H18 102 charge capping.<p/>
H18 103 <p_>It is not good enough for the Government simply to tell a local 
H18 104 authority that it is being capped and that, say, pounds10 million 
H18 105 must be taken out of its budget. The Government should be obliged 
H18 106 to indicate to the authority how the pounds10 million might be 
H18 107 saved. But they do not do that. They know that some local 
H18 108 authorities, such as the one in my area, simply cannot cut spending 
H18 109 without reducing services. They know that authorities, in setting 
H18 110 their budgets, have acted responsibly.<p/>
H18 111 <p_>It should be remembered that the Manchesters, the Bradfords, 
H18 112 the Wandsworths and the Westminsters get double the amount of money 
H18 113 that Barnsley gets to provide services at the same level. Why does 
H18 114 Manchester get twice as much as the local authority in my area to 
H18 115 provide the same services? It is absolutely ridiculous.<p/>
H18 116 <p_>The Government are abdicating their responsibility. They do not 
H18 117 know where the cuts could be made. They themselves could not do the 
H18 118 job. The whole idea of charge capping is a sham, because it is 
H18 119 based on the sham standard spending assessment.<p/>
H18 120 <p_>5 pm<p/>
H18 121 <p_><tf_>Ms. Dawn Primarolo<tf/> (Bristol, South): I shall try to 
H18 122 make my comments brief, as other hon. Members wish to take part in 
H18 123 the debate. I shall confine myself to the new clause.<p/>
H18 124 <p_>The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) 
H18 125 said that those who take decisions should be made accountable. That 
H18 126 is exactly what new clause 1 seeks to do. It seeks to make the 
H18 127 Government accountable for what they are forcing upon local 
H18 128 authorities. If the hon. Lady and her colleagues are so keen on 
H18 129 this mechanism, it is odd that they are resisting this new clause, 
H18 130 which specifically addresses the fact that the Bill provides the 
H18 131 Secretary of State with strengthened powers by giving him the 
H18 132 right, in effect, to decide a local authority's poll tax as well as 
H18 133 its budget. That is true of all local authorities that the 
H18 134 Secretary of State chooses to charge-cap.<p/>
H18 135 <p_>This is an ironic twist, bearing in mind what the present 
H18 136 Secretary of State for the Environment wrote to <tf_>The Times<tf/> 
H18 137 in May 1990:<p/>
H18 138 <p_><tf_><quote_>"Local authorities should be free to set and 
H18 139 account for their own budgets."<quote/><tf/><p/>
H18 140 <p_>But the Government are seeking to take that right away from the 
H18 141 local authorities. They know that the task that has been set is 
H18 142 impossible, and they do not wish themselves, as the Government, to 
H18 143 be held accountable for extremely difficult decisions.<p/>
H18 144 <p_>New clause 1 refers specifically to difficulties in respect of 
H18 145 the collection fund. It would oblige the Secretary of State to 
H18 146 specify the services that a local authority area was likely to 
H18 147 lose. If he was unable or was not prepared to identify the cuts, he 
H18 148 would be required to specify the deficit that would have to be 
H18 149 carried forward and would result in an increase in poll tax in the 
H18 150 following financial year. The Government are not prepared to give 
H18 151 an estimate or to take into consideration the difficulties that 
H18 152 local authorities have to face.<p/>
H18 153 <p_>In Bristol, whose council is one of the authorities that the 
H18 154 hon. Lady quoted, the Government are requiring a cut of pounds21 
H18 155 million in the expenditure for next year. Bearing in mind the fact 
H18 156 that the total expenditure figure is pounds62 million, anybody who 
H18 157 believes that a reduction of pounds21 million will be achieved 
H18 158 without loss of services and loss of jobs is clearly living in 
H18 159 cloud cuckoo land. Let us look at the experience in Bristol this 
H18 160 year. Let us consider the information that we should wish the 
H18 161 Secretary of State to take into account when identifying cuts. The 
H18 162 poll tax is proving to be almost impossible to collect. The Audit 
H18 163 Commission, when studying collection and looking at the collection 
H18 164 fund, investigated a number of authorities, of which Bristol city 
H18 165 council was one. Thus we have up-to-date information on the 
H18 166 problems of that local authority.<p/>
H18 167 <p_>In Bristol, administration of the poll tax costs pounds18.22 
H18 168 per head of the adult population. The Audit Commission estimated 
H18 169 that the figure should be pounds14. The difference is accounted for 
H18 170 by the fact that the council had to find new offices for the 
H18 171 increased number of staff needed to deal with the poll tax. That 
H18 172 has been carried forward. In addition, the authority has to pay the 
H18 173 collection charge and giro costs. The administration charge for the 
H18 174 rates was pounds7.35 per head. In addition, as a result of charge 
H18 175 capping, court appeals and the endless rebilling that has been 
H18 176 necessary - <p/>
H18 177 <p_><tf_>Mr. Holt:<tf/> Would the hon. Lady care to say whether she 
H18 178 has paid her own charge this year? If not, by how much does she 
H18 179 estimate she has burdened other people as a result of failure to 
H18 180 conform with the law?<p/>
H18 181 <p_><tf_>Ms. Primarolo:<tf/> I intend to apply to myself the 
H18 182 discipline of sticking to the new clause, even if other hon. 
H18 183 Members cannot do so. I should be happy, at another time and in a 
H18 184 relevant debate, to discuss with the hon. Gentleman the invidious 
H18 185 effects of the poll tax on my constituents and on many others who 
H18 186 are unable to pay. Pensioners, despite an increase in their 
H18 187 pensions, are worse off because they have lost even the small 
H18 188 amount of relief that was available.<p/>
H18 189 <p_><tf_>Mr. Holt:<tf/> Will the hon. Lady give way?<p/>
H18 190 <p_><tf_>Ms. Primarolo:<tf/> No. It is well known in this House 
H18 191 that I am not frightened by the bullying of hon. Members on the 
H18 192 Government Benches. I intend to persist with the speech on new 
H18 193 clause 1 that I rose to make.

H19   5 practical understanding of issues related to training, vocational 
H19   6 education and enterprise development. Second, it will review the 
H19   7 Department's existing research and development priorities and give 
H19   8 views on how best these funds should be applied in future to secure 
H19   9 national policy objectives. Third, beginning this summer, it will 
H19  10 sponsor small seminars to examine emerging issues which will have a 
H19  11 bearing on future policy and practice. These events will bring 
H19  12 together top business leaders, academics and opinion formers who 
H19  13 have an interest in training, education, enterprise and economic 
H19  14 development.<p/>
H19  15 <p_>Over the next two years, the National Training Task Force is 
H19  16 committed to serving as an independent, employer-led advisory body 
H19  17 which can be the standard-bearer for the TEC movement and, more 
H19  18 broadly, for education, training and enterprise development in 
H19  19 Britain. We believe we must be strategic in our thinking and 
H19  20 challenging in our quest for excellence. We must set high standards 
H19  21 and measure our national progress towards securing a workforce 
H19  22 equal to the best in the world. And we must contribute to the 
H19  23 leadership needed to create a public climate in which training and 
H19  24 education are seen as the natural conditions for economic and 
H19  25 environmental well-being.<p/>
H19  26 <p_>We believe that the work which we plan to undertake with TECs 
H19  27 and other relevant organisations over the coming months will both 
H19  28 inform and develop future national goals which are established for 
H19  29 TECs and the training and enterprise system at large. It should 
H19  30 give us the knowledge and expertise to contribute significantly to 
H19  31 the Secretary of State's Strategic Guidance and to national 
H19  32 policy-making more generally.<p/>
H19  33 <p_>The Task Force has a serious and challenging job to do. By 
H19  34 working together with individual TECs, the Group of 10, employer 
H19  35 organisations and other interested parties, I believe we can make a 
H19  36 significant contribution towards enhancing the skills of our people 
H19  37 and the economic prosperity of our communities.<p/>

H19  39 <h_><p_>Examination of Witness<p/><h/>
H19  40 <p_><tf_>SIR BRIAN WOLFSON<tf/>, Chairman, National Training Task 
H19  41 Force, was examined.<p/>
H19  42 <h|>Chairman
H19  43 <p_>289. Sir Brian, welcome to our proceedings this afternoon. We 
H19  44 are very pleased to see you. Could you tell us something of your 
H19  45 relations <tf|>vis-<*_>a-grave<*/>-vis the group of 10 TEC 
H19  46 chairmen? Sometimes it is suggested there is an overlap in 
H19  47 responsibilities. Could you clear that up for us please?<p/>
H19  48 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> Yes, I can. The Group of 10 is 
H19  49 the representative body chosen by the TEC chairs on a revolving 
H19  50 basis, that is to say they agree informally from a region that one 
H19  51 person will represent that region, with an alternative, for 
H19  52 approximately one year, and then it revolves all the time. Its 
H19  53 purpose is to deal with those matters which affect the operational 
H19  54 side of the TEC programme with Government. Where the Task Force is 
H19  55 to do with strategy, quality, measuring and fiduciary 
H19  56 responsibilities, the G10 works on a hands-on, detailed 
H19  57 administrative level, and of course from time to time propositions 
H19  58 for areas of change if they feel it necessary to do so.<p/>
H19  59 <p_>290. You are responsible for objectives and strategy, they are 
H19  60 responsible for the mechanics and the delivery?<p/>
H19  61 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> Correct.<p/>
H19  62 <p_>291. I believe your remit has been extended recently, could you 
H19  63 tell us in what way? How have you met your remit to date and what 
H19  64 are your new responsibilities? Do you see your Task Force being set 
H19  65 up for a period of four years? Is that still the case?<p/>
H19  66 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> Yes. The extended remit is in the 
H19  67 area of broadening the way we tackle the whole training issue. We 
H19  68 do not consider it enough just to have the TECs up and running. 
H19  69 Firstly, they are all pretty new and have a lot of evolution to get 
H19  70 through before we get to where we are going, and there is a lot of 
H19  71 monitoring to be done and new ideas to be tested and looked at as 
H19  72 well. We decided the best way we could involve ourselves in that 
H19  73 exercise was to take three separate parts. The first part was to do 
H19  74 with the oversight of the development of the TECs themselves, and 
H19  75 that would involve visits from Task Force members and other 
H19  76 involvements and checks and balances to see how they were 
H19  77 performing. The second area was to do with the Investors in People 
H19  78 programme, because in a sense we will begin to have accomplished 
H19  79 our mission when the majority of companies in this country are 
H19  80 investors in people companies, when they have signed up to that 
H19  81 degree of commitment to the development of their people. We felt 
H19  82 that was a key area for the Task Force and it was the other side of 
H19  83 the quality of the programme and how it handles those national 
H19  84 companies which cannot be handled in the first instance by the TECs 
H19  85 themselves. The final area is the strategic area where there are 
H19  86 still comparisons and lessons to be learned from what is going on 
H19  87 in other countries. For example, in France and Germany the great 
H19  88 bulk of managers when questioned, if you put them against a wall, 
H19  89 say - and I think this is very significant, particularly in Germany 
H19  90 where 63 per cent of the managers say this is so - the most 
H19  91 important thing in their company is the skill of their workforce. 
H19  92 That says it all when you get down to what comes from the German 
H19  93 Federal Republic. So in the strategic area there are visions still 
H19  94 to be fashioned as to where we need to be in the year 2000, where 
H19  95 we believe this whole programme is going. That is how we broadened 
H19  96 the interaction of the Task Force and made three separate committee 
H19  97 chair-people - Tony Cleaver of IBM takes the TEC part, Allen 
H19  98 Sheppard of Grand Met is doing Investors in People, and Bob Reid, 
H19  99 who should have been with us today, is doing a strategic over-view. 
H19 100 I chair the whole thing with them. So far as your point on time is 
H19 101 concerned, the end of this year will be in fact three years, so we 
H19 102 are 2 1/2 years old now. The great proportion of that 2 1/2 years 
H19 103 was taken up with a people consultation process and the initial 
H19 104 impetus of the whole TEC establishment. We are now moving into a 
H19 105 far more thoughtful - I would not say reflectful but thoughtful - 
H19 106 monitoring phase from which we can learn by some of the mistakes we 
H19 107 shall certainly make, and at the same time begin to put new 
H19 108 leadership positions on the table for the movement to respond to. 
H19 109 So I doubt whether four years will be sufficient. I think if we are 
H19 110 going to have an impact we need the Task Force around yet awhile. 
H19 111 This links back to who is going to own the TEC movement eventually. 
H19 112 Does it belong to the local communities or who? What should the 
H19 113 final relationship be between that movement and Government, which 
H19 114 is still its principal customer?<p/>
H19 115 <p_>292. What has been happening in London? Quite a few of the 
H19 116 London offices do not seem to be up and running yet, do they? Is 
H19 117 there any reason for that?<p/>
H19 118 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> No, not in any direct fault 
H19 119 sense, there is no reason. There is a background reason which I 
H19 120 will share with you. It was felt by those of us involved that one 
H19 121 of the reasons London has always been very difficult to work in and 
H19 122 make resolutions of problems possible was because it is such a 
H19 123 large and complex entity, and that if we should err on the side of 
H19 124 caution we should go for more TECs in the area rather than less. In 
H19 125 fact the more areas we could break it down to, the more handleable 
H19 126 the problem becomes for the individual TECs concerned. In fact all 
H19 127 the London TECs are now on stream or coming in a few months. So 
H19 128 because of the complexities, it took that much longer.<p/>
H19 129 <p_>293. You mentioned the Investors in People programme. As you 
H19 130 know, with the industrial training boards companies achieved 
H19 131 exemption from the levy if they had good training programmes. How 
H19 132 does the IIP differ from that? Is it roughly the same?<p/>
H19 133 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson<tf/>) No, it is not. It is a much 
H19 134 deeper and more total element. It is even more extensive than BS 
H19 135 5750. If I can digress for a moment, one of the great problems with 
H19 136 what we are doing at the moment is whether we are getting value for 
H19 137 money out of what is going on in training which is done by 
H19 138 companies. Only one out of two companies which do have training has 
H19 139 a company plan, and only one in seven which has a company plan has 
H19 140 a feed-back measure, to measure how well they do their training. So 
H19 141 there is a great deal of improvement possible, and the Investors in 
H19 142 People programme goes very deeply into companies' commitment to 
H19 143 training at every level - the measurement of the training, the 
H19 144 effect of the training so you get a feed-back system worthy of the 
H19 145 name and you can see whether you are spending your money wisely and 
H19 146 measuring the individual training growth of all the employees. It 
H19 147 is much broader than any of the industrial training boards are 
H19 148 now.<p/>
H19 149 <p_>294. Do you have the resources to audit all of these companies 
H19 150 adequately?<p/>
H19 151 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> The resources are not yet in 
H19 152 place but we think we will have the resources and that is going to 
H19 153 be very much a 'user pay' scheme. TECs will be charging for the 
H19 154 auditing of the Investors in People programme and at the national 
H19 155 level we will also be charging for the certification that is 
H19 156 carried out under the aegis of the Task Force.<p/>
H19 157 <p_>295. So firms will be charged a fee for the pleasure of being 
H19 158 audited?<p/>
H19 159 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> They will be charged a fee, not 
H19 160 for the pleasure of being audited, but for the pleasure of the 
H19 161 respect and regard that they will have in their communities for 
H19 162 being an Investors in People company.<p/>
H19 163 <p_>296. Are you confident that in times of recession they are 
H19 164 going to come forward in sufficient numbers?<p/>
H19 165 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> Yes. We have done a great deal of 
H19 166 research. The committee that was actually set up was not just 
H19 167 members of the Task Force. It included members of the TUC, it 
H19 168 included members of the CBI, it included members of Chambers of 
H19 169 Commerce. It was a very wide remit that was examined and 
H19 170 consultants were put to work and we have done sample studies of the 
H19 171 whole thing and we are in fact very encouraged indeed by the 
H19 172 response from commerce and industry to the programme.<p/>
H19 173 <p_>297. You will be publishing reports, will you, of these 
H19 174 audits?<p/>
H19 175 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> You mean in the sense of the 
H19 176 report of a company?<p/>
H19 177 <p_>298. Of all the companies - your activity in auditing IIP.<p/>
H19 178 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> We have been publishing gross 
H19 179 numbers but I do not think we will be publishing the dialogue which 
H19 180 takes place between company and the audit individual, because the 
H19 181 idea is that if a company does not pass first time round they will 
H19 182 be counselled as to what they have to do to make sure they get 
H19 183 through next time, and they will be re-checked every two, three or 
H19 184 four years, according to how they feel about it, to monitor how 
H19 185 progress is being made.<p/>
H19 186 <p_>299. How will the public and Parliament know of what progress 
H19 187 is being made in this respect?<p/>
H19 188 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> Because we will be publishing 
H19 189 numbers of those companies who have been qualified to be IIP 
H19 190 companies.<p/>
H19 191 <p_>300. The numbers of companies and the numbers - ?<p/>
H19 192 <p_><tf_>(Sir Brian Wolfson)<tf/> The number of employees that are 
H19 193 fully covered, exactly.<p/>
H19 194 <p_>301. You have an oversight of the TECs. What about the 
H19 195 non-statutory industry training organisations? Do you look at them? 
H19 196 There are a very large number of them. How do they fit in to all 
H19 197 this?<p/>

H20   1 <#FLOB:H20\><h_><p_>EIGHTH REPORT<p/>
H20   2 <p_>The Committee of Public Accounts has agreed to the following 
H20   3 Report<p/>
H20   4 <p_>THE ELDERLY: INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPORTING THE 
H20   5 ELDERLY AND IMPLICATIONS OF PERSONAL PENSIONS FOR THE NATIONAL 
H20   6 INSURANCE FUND<p/>
H20   7 <p_>INTRODUCTION<p/><h/>
H20   8 <p_>1. There are some ten and a half million people over pension 
H20   9 age in Great Britain. Financial support provided by the Department 
H20  10 of Social Security for elderly people cost about pounds26 billion 
H20  11 in 1989-90. In the same year, the cost to the National Insurance 
H20  12 Fund of rebates and incentives for employees opting out of the 
H20  13 state earnings related pension scheme and taking out personal 
H20  14 pensions instead was about pounds2 billion.<p/>
H20  15 <p_>2. On the basis of a Report by the Comptroller and Auditor 
H20  16 General (C&AG), we examined the Department of Social Security on 
H20  17 the adequacy of their information base on the elderly and on their 
H20  18 role in the introduction, monitoring and evaluation of the rebate 
H20  19 and incentives provided for personal pensions. We have considered 
H20  20 the evidence given and our main conclusions and recommendations are 
H20  21 as follows:<p/>
H20  22 <h_><p_>On the Department's information needs about elderly 
H20  23 people<p/><h/>
H20  24 <p_>(i) We note the Department's concern to develop and improve 
H20  25 their data base. We endorse the areas for improvement set out in 
H20  26 the C&AG's Report, and the criteria he has suggested (paragraph 
H20  27 9).<p/>
H20  28 <p_>(ii) We believe that the Department would be right to attach a 
H20  29 high priority to implementing an appropriately designed income 
H20  30 survey without further delay (paragraph 10).<p/>
H20  31 <p_>(iii) We recommend that, in the light of the outcome of their 
H20  32 current study, the Department should examine what further surveys 
H20  33 may be needed to enable them to estimate the extent to which 
H20  34 elderly people leaving residential or institutional care are being 
H20  35 assisted by the Social Fund to live in the community (paragraph 
H20  36 11).<p/>
H20  37 <p_>(iv) We are glad to note that, through their new computer 
H20  38 systems, the Department are seeking improvements to their data base 
H20  39 on existing beneficiaries (paragraph 12).<p/>
H20  40 <h_><p_>On the information needs of elderly people about financial 
H20  41 support available<p/><h/>
H20  42 <p_>(v) We recommend that the Department should give further 
H20  43 attention to tailoring publicity about benefits, and other forms of 
H20  44 financial assistance funded by the Department, to the particular 
H20  45 information needs of elderly people (paragraph 16).<p/>
H20  46 <p_>(vi) We welcome the efforts the Department are making to 
H20  47 improve the publicity given to the Social Fund. The limited 
H20  48 publicity so far provided by the Department about the Independent 
H20  49 Living Fund is, however, unsatisfactory in our view and we 
H20  50 recommend that, as a minimum step, information about the Fund 
H20  51 should be given to all recipients of Attendance Allowance eligible 
H20  52 to apply to the Fund for assistance (paragraph 17).<p/>
H20  53 <h_><p_>On the Department's appraisal of the likely take up of 
H20  54 personal pensions<p/><h/>
H20  55 <p_>(vii) We are glad to note that the Department entirely accept 
H20  56 the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's study and we 
H20  57 also accept their apology for not raising their reservation about 
H20  58 the actuarial calculations when agreeing to the draft report 
H20  59 (paragraph 27).<p/>
H20  60 <p_>(viii) We are concerned that, in taking as their main working 
H20  61 assumption the lowest figure in the Government Actuary's 
H20  62 illustrative range, the Department focused on their own staffing 
H20  63 needs, rather than on the potentially much more significant 
H20  64 implications for the National Insurance Fund. In such 
H20  65 circumstances, in our view, estimates need to be made which take 
H20  66 account of the possible financial implications on a range of 
H20  67 assumptions (paragraph 28).<p/>
H20  68 <h_><p_>On the Department's monitoring and evaluation of the take 
H20  69 up of personal pensions<p/><h/>
H20  70 <p_>(ix) We note that as a result of the higher than expected cost 
H20  71 of the rebate and incentive, and other costs, expenditure on 
H20  72 certain non-contributory benefits has been transferred to the 
H20  73 Consolidated Fund. The effect was that for 1989-90 expenditure of 
H20  74 pounds1,806 million which would otherwise have been borne by the 
H20  75 National Insurance Fund was covered by general taxation, equivalent 
H20  76 to about 1.5p on the basic rate of income tax (paragraph 33).<p/>
H20  77 <p_>(x) We welcome the fact that the Department are commissioning 
H20  78 research into people's attitudes to personal pensions and that they 
H20  79 are asking the government Actuary to advise on the long- and 
H20  80 short-term implications of personal pensions for the National 
H20  81 Insurance Fund (paragraph 34).<p/>
H20  82 <p_>(xi) We recommend that the Department should re-appraise and 
H20  83 update such calculations at frequent intervals, to monitor the 
H20  84 current and projected cost, and the expected long-term savings to 
H20  85 the state pension scheme, and likely consequences of these for the 
H20  86 National Insurance Fund and the taxpayer (paragraph 34).<p/>
H20  87 <h_><p_>THE DEPARTMENT'S INFORMATION NEEDS ABOUT ELDERLY 
H20  88 PEOPLE<p/><h/>
H20  89 <p_>3. To assess whether the financial support they provide for 
H20  90 elderly people is effective, and to evaluate the extent to which 
H20  91 legislation is meeting policy objectives, the Department seek to 
H20  92 obtain adequate information about the expenditure, living standards 
H20  93 and financial circumstances of the elderly people concerned.<p/>
H20  94 <p_>4. The Department have taken several initiatives in recent 
H20  95 years to improve their information about elderly people, but they 
H20  96 recognise that a number of problems remain. They had difficulty in 
H20  97 estimating the number of elderly people likely to benefit from 
H20  98 three new measures of support, namely improved Income Support 
H20  99 Pensioner premiums, the Social Fund, and the Independent Living 
H20 100 Fund. To date, they have only limited information about the impact 
H20 101 of these measures on elderly people. And they have difficulty in 
H20 102 estimating the number of elderly people eligible for Attendance 
H20 103 Allowance.<p/>
H20 104 <p_>5. The Department told us that their data base was very large 
H20 105 and comprehensive and that they were probably better placed than 
H20 106 many other social security schemes in this respect because theirs 
H20 107 is a large, directly administered system. They are working to 
H20 108 improve their surveys and hoping to replace their data on 
H20 109 claimants, which are currently derived from manual counts in local 
H20 110 offices, with better information held on computers. The Department 
H20 111 are seeking, through their new computer systems, to obtain 
H20 112 information on the movement of people on and off benefits, and to 
H20 113 link information about individuals receiving various benefits 
H20 114 through their National Insurance number.<p/>
H20 115 <p_>6. The Department told us that it would be unrealistic, as well 
H20 116 as enormously expensive, to try to build up a data base which would 
H20 117 answer every sort of question about every sort of group quickly and 
H20 118 before new policies were introduced.<p/>
H20 119 <p_>7. In view of the limitations in the Family Income Survey as an 
H20 120 information source for Social Security purposes, we asked the 
H20 121 Department why they were not supplementing the general information 
H20 122 available from the Family Expenditure Survey with a national income 
H20 123 survey geared to their specific information needs. The Department 
H20 124 told us that they were working hard to make a case for such a 
H20 125 survey, which is estimated to cost some pounds2.9 million a year to 
H20 126 run.<p/>
H20 127 <p_>8. We also asked the Department why their local offices did not 
H20 128 record the number of elderly people, among others, helped by the 
H20 129 Social Fund on leaving residential or institutional care to live in 
H20 130 the community. The Department told us that this was not a priority, 
H20 131 given the pressures on their local offices, but that they had set 
H20 132 up a study of the number of people leaving residential care who 
H20 133 might have need for Social Fund community care grants.<p/>
H20 134 <h|>Conclusions
H20 135 <p_>9. We note the Department's concern to develop and improve 
H20 136 their data base. We recognise that they face a difficult task in 
H20 137 addressing some of the limitations in their current information 
H20 138 about elderly people. But it is important for these shortcomings to 
H20 139 be tackled so that the Department can be as clear as possible about 
H20 140 what they are trying to achieve through benefit expenditure and how 
H20 141 successful they are in meeting theses objectives. We endorse the 
H20 142 areas for improvement set out in the C&AG's Report, and his opinion 
H20 143 that an adequate information base should include sufficient, 
H20 144 reliable and timely data. In our view, these criteria are perfectly 
H20 145 reasonable and do not amount to the pursuit of unrealistically 
H20 146 comprehensive data, which we are not recommending.<p/>
H20 147 <p_>10. We believe that the cost of an incomes survey geared to the 
H20 148 Department's specific information needs has to be seen in the 
H20 149 context of expenditure of pounds26 billion for the elderly alone. 
H20 150 We believe that the Department would be right to attach a high 
H20 151 priority to implementing an appropriately designed incomes survey 
H20 152 without further delay.<p/>
H20 153 <p_>11. We believe that the Department should be in a position to 
H20 154 estimate the extent to which elderly people leaving residential or 
H20 155 institutional care are being assisted by the Social Fund to live in 
H20 156 the community. We recommend that, in the light of the outcome of 
H20 157 their current study, the Department should examine what further 
H20 158 surveys may be needed to provide information about elderly people's 
H20 159 requirements in these circumstances. The Department would then be 
H20 160 better able to assess the extent to which the Fund is achieving its 
H20 161 objectives.<p/>
H20 162 <p_>12. We are glad to note that, through their new computer 
H20 163 systems, the Department are seeking improvements to their data base 
H20 164 on existing beneficiaries.<p/>
H20 165 <h_><p_>INFORMATION NEEDS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE ABOUT FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
H20 166 AVAILABLE<p/><h/>
H20 167 <p_>13. Elderly people require information about the support 
H20 168 measures available to help meet their needs. The qualitative study 
H20 169 of elderly people commissioned by the National Audit Office 
H20 170 revealed ignorance or misunderstanding on the part of those elderly 
H20 171 people interviewed about some of the financial support available. 
H20 172 In particular, apart from those receiving help from the Independent 
H20 173 Living Fund, none of the elderly people taking part in the study, 
H20 174 including those receiving Attendance Allowance, had heard of that 
H20 175 Fund.<p/>
H20 176 <p_>14. The Department told us that the existence of the 
H20 177 Independent Living Fund was drawn to the attention of new 
H20 178 recipients of Attendance Allowance on their award notices, but that 
H20 179 more widespread publicity posed problems because the Fund had been 
H20 180 set up on a temporary basis and on a very small scale.<p/>
H20 181 <p_>15. The Department told us that they were planning to improve 
H20 182 the information provided on the availability of Social Fund 
H20 183 community care grants, through the production of a new leaflet. 
H20 184 They are also looking to the results of research currently in hand 
H20 185 to identify what further publicity might be needed.<p/>
H20 186 <h|>Conclusions
H20 187 <p_>16. The provision of information about the availability of 
H20 188 financial support is especially important for elderly people, many 
H20 189 of whom have mobility problems and other disabilities, and so may 
H20 190 have difficulty in obtaining information for themselves. We 
H20 191 recommend that the Department should give further attention to 
H20 192 tailoring publicity about benefits, and other forms of financial 
H20 193 assistance funded by the Department, to the particular information 
H20 194 needs of elderly people, as illustrated in the National Audit 
H20 195 Office study.<p/>
H20 196 <p_>17. We welcome the efforts the Department are making to improve 
H20 197 the publicity given to the Social Fund. The limited publicity so 
H20 198 far provided by the Department about the Independent Living Fund 
H20 199 is, however, unsatisfactory in our view, giving rise to the danger 
H20 200 that many people who may be eligible for help from the Fund may not 
H20 201 hear about it. Consequently, taxpayers' money may not be 
H20 202 distributed in an even-handed manner. This limited publicity is not 
H20 203 acceptable and we recommend that, as a minimum step, information 
H20 204 about the Fund should be given to all recipients of Attendance 
H20 205 Allowance who are eligible to apply to the Fund for assistance.<p/>
H20 206 <h_><p_>THE DEPARTMENT'S APPRAISAL OF THE LIKELY TAKE UP OF 
H20 207 PERSONAL PENSIONS<p/><h/>
H20 208 <p_>18. Since 1988 employees have been entitled to contract out of 
H20 209 the state earnings-related pension scheme and take out a personal 
H20 210 pension from an insurance company, unit trust, bank, or other 
H20 211 approved body. Those who take out such a personal pension, or who 
H20 212 join a newly contracted out occupational pension scheme, benefit 
H20 213 from a flat rate rebate of National Insurance contributions. For 
H20 214 the period to April 1993, the rebate has been set at 5.8 per cent 
H20 215 fo their relevant earnings. For the same period, there is also a 
H20 216 special incentive of 2 per cent of relevant earnings.<p/>
H20 217 <p_>19. In 1986, the Government Actuary advised that there was no 
H20 218 basis for making a firm estimate of the likely number of people 
H20 219 contracting out as a result of the rebate and incentive offered. 
H20 220 But he published illustrative calculations of the possible 
H20 221 long-term savings to the National Insurance Fund based on half a 
H20 222 million, two million and five million contracting out.
H20 223 
H20 224 
H21   1 <#FLOB:H21\>One-year 'access' courses provide a foundation and an 
H21   2 appropriate test before enrolment on a course of higher education 
H21   3 for prospective students who lack the standard entry 
H21   4 qualifications. Polytechnics have close links with commerce and 
H21   5 industry, and many polytechnic students have jobs and attend on a 
H21   6 part-time basis. Similar provision is made in Scotland in the 15 
H21   7 central institutions and a number of further education colleges, 
H21   8 and in Northern Ireland by the University of Ulster.<p/>
H21   9 <p_>Institutes and colleges of higher education, formed by the 
H21  10 integration of teacher training with the rest of higher education, 
H21  11 account for a significant proportion of higher education students, 
H21  12 and other further education colleges run some, usually specialised, 
H21  13 higher education courses.<p/>
H21  14 <h_><p_>Council for National Academic Awards<p/><h/>
H21  15 <p_>An increasing number of students on higher education courses in 
H21  16 Great Britain outside the universities take courses leading to the 
H21  17 qualifications of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). 
H21  18 The Council awards degrees and other academic qualifications 
H21  19 comparable in standard with those granted by the universities. The 
H21  20 courses range from science and technology to the arts, social 
H21  21 studies, business studies and law, but the proportion of 
H21  22 technology, business or other broadly vocational courses is much 
H21  23 higher than in universities.<p/>
H21  24 <p_>Since 1987 institutions running CNAA-approved courses have been 
H21  25 able to apply to have delegated responsibility for approving and 
H21  26 reviewing their own courses. By August 1990 a total of 40 
H21  27 institutions had been accredited by the CNAA for taught degree 
H21  28 courses.<p/>
H21  29 <h_><p_>Vocational Qualifications<p/><h/>
H21  30 <p_>The National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) was 
H21  31 set up in 1986 to reform and rationalise the vocational 
H21  32 qualifications system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The 
H21  33 Council aims to make qualifications more relevant to the needs of 
H21  34 employment by basing them on standards of competence set by 
H21  35 industry. It is establishing a new framework of National Vocational 
H21  36 Qualifications (NVQs) based on defined levels of achievement to 
H21  37 which qualifications in all sectors can be assigned or accredited. 
H21  38 By January 1990 nearly 200 qualifications drawn from 40 different 
H21  39 employment sectors had been accredited. The aim is to have the 
H21  40 framework for levels 1 to 4 (from the most basic level to the 
H21  41 management supervisory level) fully operational by the end of 1992, 
H21  42 and eventually it is expected to extend the framework to cover all 
H21  43 occupational levels up to and including the professions.<p/>
H21  44 <p_>The competence-based system is being extended in Scotland 
H21  45 (which already has its own modular system) through a new system of 
H21  46 Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs) along the lines of NVQs. 
H21  47 SVQs will be accredited by the Scottish Vocational Education 
H21  48 Council (see below).<p/>
H21  49 <h_><p_>Other Examining Bodies<p/><h/>
H21  50 <p_>The Business & Technician Education Council (BTEC) plans and 
H21  51 administers a unified national system of courses at all level for 
H21  52 students in industry, commerce and public administration in 
H21  53 England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Courses leading to BTEC awards 
H21  54 are available at polytechnics, colleges of further and higher 
H21  55 education, and in some schools. The Scottish Vocational Education 
H21  56 Council (SCOTVEC) is the principal examining and awarding body in 
H21  57 the field of further education in Scotland. SCOTVEC is responsible 
H21  58 for administering and developing the non-advanced SCOTVEC National 
H21  59 Certificate and the advanced level Higher National Certificate and 
H21  60 Higher National Diploma.<p/>
H21  61 <p_>Qualifications in a wide range of occupational areas are 
H21  62 offered by the City and Guilds of London Institute, and a variety 
H21  63 of qualifications in commercial and office practice are awarded by 
H21  64 the Royal Society of Arts.<p/>
H21  65 <h_><p_>Teacher Training<p/>
H21  66 <p_>Courses and Qualifications<p/><h/>
H21  67 <p_>Almost all entrants to teaching in maintained and special 
H21  68 schools in England and Wales complete a recognised course of 
H21  69 initial teacher training. Such courses are offered by university 
H21  70 departments of education as well as by many polytechnics and 
H21  71 colleges. Non-graduates usually qualify by taking a four-year 
H21  72 Bachelor of Education (BEd) honours degree. There are also 
H21  73 specially designed two-year BEd courses - mostly in subjects where 
H21  74 there is a shortage of teachers at the secondary level - for 
H21  75 suitably qualified people. Graduates normally take a one-year 
H21  76 Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE), and two-year PGCE 
H21  77 courses are available in the secondary shortage subjects for those 
H21  78 whose first degree in an associated subject included at least one 
H21  79 year's study of the subject they intend to teach.<p/>
H21  80 <p_>Articled teacher courses, offering school-based teacher 
H21  81 training for graduates, were introduced in September 1990. 
H21  82 Trainees, who receive a bursary, take on a progressively greater 
H21  83 teaching load, and formal training is provided both in initial 
H21  84 teacher-training institutions and in school by college tutors and 
H21  85 school teachers. In 1989 the Government introduced a licensed 
H21  86 teacher scheme in England and Wales to assist entry into the 
H21  87 profession for people who may not have formal teacher-training 
H21  88 qualifications but who have relevant qualifications and experience. 
H21  89 Participants generally have to complete a period of two years as a 
H21  90 licensed teacher before achieving qualified teacher status. Support 
H21  91 is also offered for local initiatives to encourage mature people to 
H21  92 return to teaching. In addition, the Government has made it easier 
H21  93 for teachers trained abroad to take up posts in English and Welsh 
H21  94 schools.<p/>
H21  95 <p_>In Scotland all teachers in education authority schools must be 
H21  96 registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. It is 
H21  97 government policy that all entrants to the teaching profession in 
H21  98 Scotland should be graduates. New primary teachers qualify either 
H21  99 through a four-year BEd course or a one<?_>-<?/>year postgraduate 
H21 100 course of teacher training at a college of education. Teachers of 
H21 101 academic subjects at secondary schools must hold a degree 
H21 102 containing two passes in the subject which they wish to teach. In 
H21 103 certain subjects, a relevant specialist diploma has been acceptable 
H21 104 in place of a degree, but this provision is being phased out. 
H21 105 Secondary teachers must undertake a one-year postgraduate training 
H21 106 course. For music and technology, four-year BEd courses are also 
H21 107 available, and for physical education all teachers take BEd 
H21 108 courses.<p/>
H21 109 <p_>In Northern Ireland teacher training is provided by the two 
H21 110 universities and the two colleges of education. The principal 
H21 111 courses are BEd Honours (four years), BA Honours (Education) and 
H21 112 the one-year postgraduate Certificate of Education.<p/>
H21 113 <h_><p_>Measures to Improve Standards<p/><h/>
H21 114 <p_>The Government has taken steps to improve the quality of 
H21 115 teaching by revising selection, training and placement procedures 
H21 116 for new teachers, and by making available more in-service training 
H21 117 opportunities. Management training courses for head teachers are 
H21 118 also being provided. The Government believes that more systematic 
H21 119 planning is required by schools and local education authorities to 
H21 120 match in-service training to both the career needs of teachers and 
H21 121 to the curricular needs of schools. A major new in-service training 
H21 122 programme to improve the quality of teaching in schools and 
H21 123 institutions of further education was introduced under the 
H21 124 Education (No 2) Act 1986 (see p 178).<p/>
H21 125 <p_>Measures to strengthen initial teacher training in England, 
H21 126 Wales and Northern Ireland have included the issuing of criteria 
H21 127 which courses must meet and the establishment of the Council for 
H21 128 the Accreditation of Teacher Education to review courses against 
H21 129 the criteria. The Government intends to establish a national 
H21 130 framework allowing teachers' employers in England and Wales to 
H21 131 appraise the performance of teachers. Local education authorities, 
H21 132 voluntary-aided schools and grant-maintained schools will be able 
H21 133 to decide whether and how quickly to introduce appraisal.<p/>
H21 134 <p_>In Scotland all courses have been revised following 
H21 135 recommendations of working parties on teacher training. All new 
H21 136 pre-service and major in-service courses provided by colleges of 
H21 137 education must be approved by the Scottish Education Department and 
H21 138 a validating body. Local education authorities are to be asked to 
H21 139 implement national guidelines for the introduction of systematic 
H21 140 schemes of staff development and appraisal for teachers. The 
H21 141 Government has taken reserve powers requiring authorities to 
H21 142 operate schemes prescribed by it in the event of a breakdown of 
H21 143 voluntary agreements.<p/>
H21 144 <h_><p_>Adult and Continuing Education<p/><h/>
H21 145 <p_>The scope of adult and continuing education has widened in 
H21 146 recent years. In addition to the development of the individual 
H21 147 through cultural, physical and craft pursuits, it now covers basic 
H21 148 education (for example, in literacy and numeracy); education for 
H21 149 disadvantaged groups and those with special needs, such as ethnic 
H21 150 minorities or disabled people; consumer education; health 
H21 151 education; and pre-retirement education. Continuing education also 
H21 152 includes training for those in employment to enable them to keep 
H21 153 pace with technological change.<p/>
H21 154 <p_>The Government has taken a number of initiatives to improve 
H21 155 opportunities for both adult and continuing education. In 1982 it 
H21 156 launched the Professional, Industrial and Commercial Updating 
H21 157 Programme (PICKUP), designed to help colleges, polytechnics and 
H21 158 universities to meet the need to up-date and broaden the skills of 
H21 159 those in mid-career in industry, commerce and the professions. By 
H21 160 1992 the Government aims to have one in ten of Britain's workforce 
H21 161 attending job skills updating courses every year under PICKUP.<p/>
H21 162 <p_>The availability of open learning opportunities has been 
H21 163 extended with the formation in 1987 of the Open College, an 
H21 164 independent company set up with government support. The College 
H21 165 brings together broadcasters, educationists and sponsors, and 
H21 166 provides vocational education and training courses below degree 
H21 167 level. Over 150,000 people have taken courses since 1987 and the 
H21 168 College has delivered training for about 1,000 firms. Up to 
H21 169 pounds12 million is being allocated by the Government for the 
H21 170 College's commercial activities as well as pounds6 million for 
H21 171 broadcasting. The Open College of the Arts, also launched in 1987, 
H21 172 offers an art foundation course to those wishing to study at 
H21 173 home.<p/>
H21 174 <p_>Apart from provision for mature students at universities, 
H21 175 courses are offered by the Open University, further education 
H21 176 colleges, adult education centres, residential colleges, 
H21 177 extra-mural departments of universities and other bodies such as 
H21 178 voluntary organisations. Most of the provision is made by the local 
H21 179 education authorities in a wide variety of establishments, 
H21 180 including schools used for adult evening classes and 'community 
H21 181 schools', which offer educational, social and cultural 
H21 182 opportunities for the wider community. A majority of courses are 
H21 183 part time. Local authorities also maintain or aid many of the 
H21 184 short-term residential colleges or centres which run courses 
H21 185 lasting between a weekend and a fortnight. Long-term residential 
H21 186 colleges, grant-aided by central government departments, have 
H21 187 courses of one or two years and aim to provide a liberal education 
H21 188 for adults with few or no formal academic qualifications. Most 
H21 189 students admitted are entitled to full maintenance grants.<p/>
H21 190 <p_>University extra-mural departments and the Workers' Educational 
H21 191 Association, the largest recognised voluntary educational body in 
H21 192 Britain, offer extended part-time courses of liberal studies. They 
H21 193 also run short courses for special (including vocational) interest. 
H21 194 Various kinds of education and training are provided by many other 
H21 195 organisations, for example, the National Federation of Women's 
H21 196 Institutes, the Young Men's Christian Association and the 
H21 197 Pre-Retirement Association.<p/>
H21 198 <p_>The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education is a 
H21 199 centre of information, research, development work and publication 
H21 200 for adult and continuing education. It also acts as a channel of 
H21 201 co-operation and consultation for the many interested organisations 
H21 202 in England and Wales. The Institute administers with government 
H21 203 funding the Unit for the Development of Adult Continuing Education, 
H21 204 which undertakes research and development work. The Institute's 
H21 205 counterpart in Scotland is the Scottish Institute of Adult and 
H21 206 Continuing Education.<p/>
H21 207 <p_>The Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit (ALBSU) is the central 
H21 208 focus for adult literacy, numeracy and communications skills in 
H21 209 England and Wales. A three-year literacy and numeracy initiative 
H21 210 was launched in 1989 as a joint venture between the Government and 
H21 211 the BBC. It involves the use of television and radio and specially 
H21 212 printed material to improve the communications skills of an 
H21 213 estimated 6 million adults. New nationally recognised 
H21 214 qualifications in communication and numeracy are being developed, 
H21 215 and a referral service is being created to put people in contact 
H21 216 with 60 new open-learning centres and other local learning 
H21 217 facilities.<p/>
H21 218 <p_>In Scotland the Scottish Community Education Council advises 
H21 219 the Government and promotes all community education matters, 
H21 220 including adult literacy and basic education, and the youth 
H21 221 service.<p/>
H21 222 <p_>In Northern Ireland the Council for Continuing Education 
H21 223 advises the Department of Education on adult and continuing 
H21 224 education matters. The role of the Council is under review.<p/>
H21 225 <h_><p_>Teaching Methods<p/><h/>
H21 226 <p_>The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time 
H21 227 courses of higher education remains a mixture of lectures; 
H21 228 prescribed or suggested reading; seminars and tutorials; essays, 
H21 229 exercises and tests; and, where appropriate, practical work or work 
H21 230 experience. Educational aids are widely used.<p/>
H21 231 
H22   1 <#FLOB:H22\><p_>In correspondence with us, the Department of the 
H22   2 Environment set out the reasoning behind the proposal and the way 
H22   3 in which they saw it being implemented. The new power was to be 
H22   4 aimed specifically at minimising the occasions on which a planning 
H22   5 inquiry or hearing was held when, they said, the written 
H22   6 representations procedure would suffice to ensure that the issues 
H22   7 were properly examined and a correct decision reached. There was no 
H22   8 intention to limit or inhibit the 'reasonable' exercise of the 
H22   9 right to be heard and the new power was not intended as a general 
H22  10 deterrent to the exercise of that statutory right, although it 
H22  11 would encourage a greater public awareness of the resource 
H22  12 implications of the exercise of the right. Policy guidance would 
H22  13 set out the categories of cases which might initially be regarded 
H22  14 as suitable for the written representations procedure, and these 
H22  15 categories would include many of the planning appeals in which a 
H22  16 hearing was offered in response to a party's exercise of the right 
H22  17 to be heard. In addition, the Department proposed to introduce an 
H22  18 'early warning' system for appeals where an appeal party was at 
H22  19 risk of being ordered to pay costs. If one of the parties notified 
H22  20 the Department of their intention to seek their costs because they 
H22  21 considered an inquiry unnecessary, or in certain other cases where 
H22  22 the Department themselves considered an inquiry unnecessary, the 
H22  23 other party would be warned that they might be at risk of an award 
H22  24 of costs if they continued to insist upon the exercise of the right 
H22  25 to be heard. The Department pointed out that, initially, the 
H22  26 provision would apply only to the exercise of the right to be heard 
H22  27 by way of an inquiry, since section 322 of the Town and Country 
H22  28 Planning Act 1990 (the '1990 Act'), giving the power to award costs 
H22  29 at hearings (as distinct from inquiries), was not yet in force. 
H22  30 However, the policy was that section 322 should be brought into 
H22  31 force as soon as practicable.<p/>
H22  32 <h_><p_>1.60 Our views<p/><h/>
H22  33 <p_>Our fundamental objection to clause 24 was that it would, in 
H22  34 our view, act as a strong and general deterrent to the exercise of 
H22  35 the statutory right to be heard. We thought that there might be a 
H22  36 (possibly small) number of cases where, on the documentation 
H22  37 available before the commencement of the inquiry, it would be 
H22  38 feasible to take the view that they could be dealt with 
H22  39 satisfactorily by means of the written representation procedure. 
H22  40 But this did not in our view justify the new provision, the effect 
H22  41 of which we thought would be, and would certainly be perceived to 
H22  42 be, to put every party appealing who insisted on the right to be 
H22  43 heard at risk of being condemned in costs on the basis of 
H22  44 conclusions drawn after the event. While a general discretion to 
H22  45 award costs such as the Secretary of State at present has in 
H22  46 respect of planning inquiries was acceptable, it was wrong in 
H22  47 principle for a statute effectively to confer a right to be heard 
H22  48 with one hand and to attempt to limit its exercise by the proposed 
H22  49 means with the other. The Government's intention not to deter the 
H22  50 'reasonable' exercise of the right to be heard was belied by what 
H22  51 we thought would be the actual effect of their proposals, since, 
H22  52 whether or not that exercise was reasonable, it appeared to us that 
H22  53 nothing could save a party from being condemned in costs if, after 
H22  54 the event, an Inspector had the power to conclude that that party 
H22  55 was mistaken, and that the hearing did not add to what would have 
H22  56 been available to him on the papers.<p/>
H22  57 <h|>1.61
H22  58 <p_>Moreover, the Departmental information relating to the way in 
H22  59 which the proposal was to be implemented accentuated our 
H22  60 misgivings. Their proposals for a warning to be given to parties in 
H22  61 all cases where the other party to proceedings made an application 
H22  62 for costs, or where the Department considered of their own motion 
H22  63 that such an application might be made, could only be regarded as 
H22  64 an extra deterrent in the nature of a threat against the exercise 
H22  65 of the right to be heard. We thought that the unconstrained 
H22  66 expression of the power in the legislation, together with these 
H22  67 glosses upon it, would act as a particular deterrent to small 
H22  68 developers, who, perhaps in some instances without the expertise or 
H22  69 the professional advice available to express themselves fully on 
H22  70 paper, prefer to put their case to an Inspector in person. We 
H22  71 pointed out that no parallel power was proposed for Scottish 
H22  72 legislation because, as we understood, it was not thought to be 
H22  73 needed: there the bringing into force of the provision equivalent 
H22  74 to section 322 of the 1990 Act (power to award costs in respect of 
H22  75 hearings) had been considered sufficient for the purpose.<p/>
H22  76 <h_><p_>1.62 The Government's change of policy<p/><h/>
H22  77 <p_>Our views were conveyed to the Department through interchanges 
H22  78 of correspondence with them, including a letter from our Chairman 
H22  79 to the Minister of Housing and Planning. Our own misgivings about 
H22  80 clause 24 were paralleled by those expressed by both the Bar and 
H22  81 The Law Society. During the Committee stage of the Bill in the 
H22  82 House of Lords, the expressions of concern voiced by some members, 
H22  83 which to a substantial degree reflected our own concern, let to the 
H22  84 Government's undertaking to review the clause in the light of our 
H22  85 observations and the views expressed by members. In the event, the 
H22  86 Government announced their intention at the Report stage not to 
H22  87 proceed with the clause. We were pleased and encouraged that the 
H22  88 Government had listened to criticism of clause 24 and responded in 
H22  89 this way.<p/>
H22  90 <h_><p_>1.63 Award of costs for late cancellations of 
H22  91 inquiries<p/><h/>
H22  92 <p_>In place of the withdrawn proposals, the Government brought 
H22  93 forward a new provision to enable appeal costs to be awarded, at 
H22  94 the Secretary of State's discretion, where the behaviour of either 
H22  95 of the two main parties in appeal proceedings resulted in 
H22  96 cancellation of a local inquiry or hearing after formal notice of 
H22  97 the opening date had been given to the parties. This provision was 
H22  98 designed to enable other appeal parties to recover their abortive 
H22  99 expenditure in preparing for an inquiry or hearing which had had to 
H22 100 be cancelled because one of the principal party's actions. As the 
H22 101 Government put it, the proposal would remedy the absence of 
H22 102 anything in the planning legislation enabling the Secretary of 
H22 103 State to order that 'wasted' costs be recovered from the party 
H22 104 responsible.<p/>
H22 105 <h|>1.64
H22 106 <p_>In principle we welcomed this new provision (now in section 30 
H22 107 of the Act, inserting a new section 322A in the 1990 Act). But we 
H22 108 thought that its implementation would require great care; for 
H22 109 example, there are cases where it is only at a late stage in the 
H22 110 proceedings that the full strength of a local authority's case is 
H22 111 revealed to an appellant, and in such circumstances late withdrawal 
H22 112 could not be described as unreasonable behaviour. The Department 
H22 113 assured us that they were aware of these dangers and that revisions 
H22 114 to the Costs Circular, upon which we would be consulted, would make 
H22 115 clear that an award of costs would only be made if there had been 
H22 116 'unreasonable' behaviour in the particular circumstances of the 
H22 117 case.<p/>
H22 118 <h_><p_>1.65 Conclusion<p/><h/>
H22 119 <p_>The changes in the legislation in passage recorded in the 
H22 120 preceding paragraphs came about because our representations, in 
H22 121 common with representations from other interested bodies, had the 
H22 122 requisite effect and we record this, therefore, as an appropriate 
H22 123 example of the exercise of our advisory function. <tf_>But the 
H22 124 principal reason for setting out in some detail our views on these 
H22 125 legislative proposals is that it enables us to emphasise the value 
H22 126 of the right of an appellant against an administrative decision to 
H22 127 have his case heard if he so wishes and the need for vigilance in 
H22 128 maintaining the unimpaired effectiveness of that right.<tf/><p/>
H22 129 <h_><p_>1.66 Other changes<p/><h/>
H22 130 <p_>A substantial number of matters in the Bill were of interest to 
H22 131 us and will involve the exercise of new regulation-making powers 
H22 132 upon which we expect future consultation. However, our comments 
H22 133 here are confined to those items where we found the need to make 
H22 134 detailed observations to the Department.<p/>
H22 135 <h_><p_>1.67 Simplified Planning Zones<p/><h/>
H22 136 <p_>A provision which caused us some concern stemmed from proposals 
H22 137 put forward in a consultation paper entitled "Simplified Planning 
H22 138 Zones: Streamlining of Procedures", issued by the Department of the 
H22 139 Environment and the Welsh Office in August 1990. Provision for 
H22 140 simplified planning zones (SPZs) was introduced by the Housing and 
H22 141 Planning Act 1986, and is now contained in the 1990 Act. In brief, 
H22 142 an SPZ is an area where an SPZ scheme is in force. Where such a 
H22 143 scheme has been adopted, or approved by the Secretary of State, the 
H22 144 effect is that planning permission is deemed to be granted for 
H22 145 development specified in the scheme or for any development of any 
H22 146 class so specified. An SPZ scheme ceases to have effect at the end 
H22 147 of a period of 10 years after its adoption or approval. The 
H22 148 procedure leading up to the creation of an SPZ had hitherto, under 
H22 149 the 1990 Act, involved the holding of a public local inquiry or 
H22 150 hearing to consider objections in cases where objectors wish to be 
H22 151 heard by an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. The 
H22 152 Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971 applies to such inquiries or 
H22 153 hearings.<p/>
H22 154 <h|>1.68
H22 155 <p_>SPZs have not so far proved very attractive to authorities and 
H22 156 developers. According to research 
H22 157 <}_><-|>commisioned<+|>commissioned<}/> by the Department of the 
H22 158 Environment, received before but published after issue of the 
H22 159 consultation paper, SPZ procedures were widely perceived as 
H22 160 cumbersome and time-consuming, and it was thought that this might 
H22 161 be dissuading some authorities and developers from embarking on 
H22 162 schemes. The Department nonetheless still saw SPZs as a potentially 
H22 163 valuable mechanism for encouraging inner city regeneration. The 
H22 164 consolation paper accordingly put forward proposals for 
H22 165 streamlining the procedures. The salient features were:<p/>
H22 166 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>making public participation before deposit of a 
H22 167 scheme optional;<p/>
H22 168 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>removing the requirement to hold a local inquiry; 
H22 169 and<p/>
H22 170 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>earlier publication of notice of intention to 
H22 171 adopt a scheme.<p/>
H22 172 <h|>1.69
H22 173 <p_>Our main concern with the proposals was that which would remove 
H22 174 the requirement to hold a local inquiry where objectors wish to be 
H22 175 heard. We thought that strong justification would be needed for 
H22 176 such a proposal, bearing in mind particularly the major 
H22 177 implications of SPZ designation, which opened to question the 
H22 178 relaxation of safeguards at the time of initial consideration. The 
H22 179 grant of permission by an adopted scheme can have very wide social, 
H22 180 visual and other environmental impact without the public or any 
H22 181 affected person having a right to object or to a public inquiry 
H22 182 after the scheme has been adopted. We did not consider that the 
H22 183 interest in urban regeneration should be allowed to override 
H22 184 genuine planning objections. Under the new proposals, subject to 
H22 185 the Secretary of State's powers of intervention to direct an 
H22 186 inquiry or to call in a scheme for his own decision, it would be 
H22 187 entirely at the discretion of the authority whether to hold an 
H22 188 inquiry. Their only obligation would be to consider objections and 
H22 189 to publish a reasoned statement of their decisions on objections 
H22 190 and of any modification they proposed. This would leave objectors 
H22 191 with scant redress if they had continuing objections and no 
H22 192 opportunity to air them further. We also 
H22 193 <}_><-|>questoned<+|>questioned<}/> whether it was right in 
H22 194 principle that the decisions whether or not to hold a public 
H22 195 inquiry should lie (subject to the Secretary of State's powers of 
H22 196 intervention) with the authority, since when the authority was 
H22 197 itself the landowner, it would have the major interest in the 
H22 198 proposal for an SPZ and might be thought to have an interest in 
H22 199 avoiding the opportunity for independent scrutiny at a public 
H22 200 inquiry.<p/>
H22 201 <h|>1.70
H22 202 <p_>The Department sought to allay our concerns. While they 
H22 203 remained of the view that there would be cases in which neither the 
H22 204 volume nor the weight of objection justified an inquiry, in the 
H22 205 light of our comments they decided that it would be advisable for 
H22 206 the Secretary of State to issue guidance to planning authorities on 
H22 207 the circumstances in which it would be desirable for a public 
H22 208 inquiry to be held to consider objections to a draft scheme: for 
H22 209 example, where a scheme constituted a substantial departure from 
H22 210 the development plan or raised strategic planning issues; where a 
H22 211 scheme was the subject of substantial local controversy; or where 
H22 212 it involved a substantial area of land in the authority's ownership 
H22 213 and there were objection to the authority's proposals.
H22 214 
H23   1 <#FLOB:H23\>After I had taken up the complaint they reconsidered 
H23   2 and, accepting that they had not explained their policy and 
H23   3 decision to the man, agreed to meet to discuss the matter with 
H23   4 him.<p/>
H23   5 <p_>72. A final case concerned the sea and not the land. A group 
H23   6 who provided a voluntary search and sea rescue facility off part of 
H23   7 the south coast of England complained that they had been unfairly 
H23   8 treated by HM Coastguard, an operational directorate within DTp. 
H23   9 The Coastguard had cancelled an operational agreement under which 
H23  10 the group's main boat was regarded as having the status of 
H23  11 auxiliary Coastguard afloat and was permitted to use VHF channel 
H23  12 zero, the Coastguard's private frequency, when assisting them in 
H23  13 rescue operations. I did not uphold the main complaint but found 
H23  14 shortcomings, for which DTp offered apologies, in the way in which 
H23  15 the Coastguard had handled matters.<p/>
H23  16 <p_>73. This is a convenient point at which to record that two 
H23  17 legislative changes in 1991 had an effect on my jurisdiction. The 
H23  18 Road Traffic Act 1988 was amended by the Road Traffic (Driver 
H23  19 Licensing and Information Systems) Act 1989. The change meant that, 
H23  20 as from 1 April 1991, the Traffic Commissioners, who are outside my 
H23  21 jurisdiction, ceased to be the licensing authority responsible for 
H23  22 the issue of heavy goods vehicle licences but became statutory 
H23  23 advisers to the Secretary of State for Transport, who took on that 
H23  24 responsibility, on all matters concerning lorry and bus drivers' 
H23  25 conduct. The effect as far as I am concerned is to bring some 
H23  26 vehicle licensing matters which were formerly outside my 
H23  27 jurisdiction within it. Secondly, the Road Traffic Act 1991 
H23  28 provides that the Traffic Director for London is subject to my 
H23  29 jurisdiction, though I have not yet had a complaint referred to 
H23  30 me.<p/>
H23  31 <p_>74. The first full year following the introduction by the Home 
H23  32 Office of a new requests/complaints system on 25 September 1990 has 
H23  33 resulted in no obvious change in the numbers of complaints from 
H23  34 prisoners referred to me by Members of the House of Commons. The 
H23  35 number increased slightly over the year before but I only felt 
H23  36 justified in accepting five of them for investigation. The others 
H23  37 were rejected either because there was a lack of any evidence of 
H23  38 maladministration or because the complaint made was one outside my 
H23  39 jurisdiction.<p/>
H23  40 <p_>75. I completed four investigations in 1991, three into 
H23  41 complaints from prisoners in England. One of them was a 
H23  42 particularly wide-ranging complaint, alleging maladministration on 
H23  43 the part of the prison authorities over such matters as the 
H23  44 prisoner's confinement in a segregation unit, a change to his 
H23  45 security classification, the removal of two newspaper cuttings from 
H23  46 his personal property, the disclosure of personal information about 
H23  47 him to fellow prisoners, the denial for more than six months of a 
H23  48 request he had made to receive accumulated visits at a prison 
H23  49 closer to his family, delay in arranging his transfer to another 
H23  50 prison, the mislaying of a petition, and interference with his 
H23  51 property, private cash, earnings and mail. I upheld some parts of 
H23  52 the complaint and the Home Office offered an appropriate remedy. 
H23  53 The two other cases both involved delay in dealing with petitions 
H23  54 submitted by the prisoners concerned. I upheld one of them and 
H23  55 found elements of maladministration in the other. The fourth 
H23  56 complaint was made by a prisoner in Scotland who alleged unfair 
H23  57 treatment by the Scottish Home and Health Department, part of the 
H23  58 Scottish Office, and inaccuracies in a Ministerial letter. I did 
H23  59 not uphold that complaint.<p/>
H23  60 <p_>76. As has been the consistent pattern in recent years, there 
H23  61 was again a steady inflow of complaints about immigration and 
H23  62 related matters. One of the complaints on which I reported during 
H23  63 the year was submitted by the same firm of immigration consultants 
H23  64 as were mentioned in paragraph 63 of my Annual Report for 1990. 
H23  65 This time the consultants contended that, as their client's 
H23  66 passport had been endorsed to give him leave to remain in the 
H23  67 United Kingdom until 31 November 1988, a date which could never 
H23  68 arrive, the client had been granted indefinite leave to remain. I 
H23  69 upheld the complaint of unreasonable delay by the Home Office 
H23  70 before they accepted that the client should be regarded as having 
H23  71 been granted indefinite leave to remain, but found no evidence to 
H23  72 support an accusation of <quote_>"calculated and malicious 
H23  73 delay"<quote/> made by the consultants, an allegation which I 
H23  74 castigated as unworthy.<p/>
H23  75 <p_>77. In another case an Israeli citizen complained after an 
H23  76 interval that he had been kept waiting for excessive periods 
H23  77 between interviews by immigration officers; that an immigration 
H23  78 officer had ignored his request for sustenance; that, following 
H23  79 refusal of leave to land, he had been kept overnight in inadequate 
H23  80 and dirty accommodation, that security staff had ignored his need 
H23  81 for medical attention and that immigration staff who had examined 
H23  82 documents in his baggage had retained two music scores and five 
H23  83 letters from his friends. My investigation revealed conflicting 
H23  84 evidence on nearly all aspects of the complaint, which I did not 
H23  85 find made out, though the Home Office tendered apologies if, as 
H23  86 seemed possible, the complainant had not been offered an evening 
H23  87 meal. In a further case, I did not uphold the main complaint that, 
H23  88 while investigating a man's application for indefinite leave to 
H23  89 remain in the United Kingdom, immigration officers had used racist 
H23  90 and abusive language and had accused the man's wife of lying. 
H23  91 However, I found that in omitting to interview the couple once they 
H23  92 had complained about the officers' conduct to the Home Office, the 
H23  93 Home Office's own investigation had been less thorough than it 
H23  94 should have been. The Home Office have since revised their practice 
H23  95 and the Immigration Service now interview a person who makes a 
H23  96 serious complaint where that is practicable and they judge it right 
H23  97 to do so.<p/>
H23  98 <p_>78. I also completed investigations into two cases in each of 
H23  99 which it was alleged that the Home Office (and also the Foreign and 
H23 100 Commonwealth Office) had mishandled an application for entry 
H23 101 clearance to the United Kingdom made by the spouse of a British 
H23 102 citizen living here. In each case I identified various shortcomings 
H23 103 in the performance of both Departments, for which apologies were 
H23 104 offered. Another type of complaint which I regularly encounter 
H23 105 concerns delays in dealing with applications from persons living in 
H23 106 this country for naturalisation as British citizens. I found 
H23 107 elements of maladministration in each of the two cases on which I 
H23 108 reported in 1991.<p/>
H23 109 <p_>79. Two further reports which I made in 1991 concerned other 
H23 110 areas of the Home Office's very wide-ranging responsibilities. In 
H23 111 the first of them, I found that the Prisons Department had failed 
H23 112 to consult the Department of the Environment and English Heritage, 
H23 113 before erecting additional accommodation at a young offenders' 
H23 114 institute located in an area scheduled as an ancient monument. I 
H23 115 also found that, despite the strong criticism directed at them by 
H23 116 one of my predecessors in 1981 for an earlier failure of this kind 
H23 117 on the same site, the Home Office did not have in place effective 
H23 118 guidance to staff and systematic checks to ensure that such cases 
H23 119 were not mishandled. I strongly criticised the Home Office who 
H23 120 confirmed they were taking various measures to improve and 
H23 121 strengthen their procedures.<p/>
H23 122 <p_>80. The second case concerned alleged delay on the part of the 
H23 123 Home Office in processing a claim for compensation for firearms 
H23 124 surrendered under the Government Buy-In Scheme and the adequacy of 
H23 125 the compensation offered for one of the weapons. I found no undue 
H23 126 delay or material procedural errors on the part of the Home Office 
H23 127 in their processing of the claim. However, as it seemed that one of 
H23 128 the complainant's weapons might have been worth considerably more 
H23 129 than the value suggested by the independent valuation which a 
H23 130 registered firearms dealer had provided to the Home Office I myself 
H23 131 took the trouble to obtain three further paper valuations - the 
H23 132 weapon itself having earlier been destroyed in line with the 
H23 133 requirements of the Scheme. Although those valuations tended to 
H23 134 support the valuation originally tendered by the complainant, the 
H23 135 Home Office declined to give him the benefit of the doubt because 
H23 136 the condition of the weapon, an important factor in reaching the 
H23 137 valuation, could no longer be positively established. As the 
H23 138 destruction of the weapon had made it impossible for me to resolve 
H23 139 the conflicting evidence as to its condition, I was unable to 
H23 140 pursue the matter further on the complainant's behalf.<p/>
H23 141 <p_>81. In my last year's report I referred to an investigation I 
H23 142 had carried out into the mishandling of a couple's concessionary TV 
H23 143 licence application. Responsibility for issuing TV licences and 
H23 144 collecting the revenue was transferred from the Home Office to the 
H23 145 BBC on 1 April 1991 under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 
H23 146 1990. As the BBC are outside my jurisdiction, complaints about 
H23 147 administrative actions taken on such matters after that date will 
H23 148 no longer be subject to an independent investigation by me. There 
H23 149 have been numerous such complaints over the years and one is still 
H23 150 under investigation.<p/>
H23 151 <p_>82. In my last Annual Report I referred to an investigation I 
H23 152 had made into the actions of the Scottish Legal Aid Board. In 1991 
H23 153 the administration of legal aid south of the border has engaged my 
H23 154 attention. The Legal Aid Board have been within my jurisdiction 
H23 155 since they took over responsibility for the administration of legal 
H23 156 aid in England and Wales in April 1989. I have encountered a small 
H23 157 but steady flow of complaints. Two of the cases which I 
H23 158 investigated last year involved the liaison arrangements between 
H23 159 the Board and DSS which continues to be responsible in England and 
H23 160 Wales for the assessment of a legal aid applicant's financial 
H23 161 means. In both those cases poor communication between the Board and 
H23 162 the Department added to the considerable difficulties experienced 
H23 163 by complainants, although I did not find that either complainant 
H23 164 had suffered financial loss as a result of actions taken by the 
H23 165 Board. Both the Board and the Department assured me that energetic 
H23 166 steps are now being taken to improve the necessary links between 
H23 167 them. Regular review meetings to identify and resolve problem areas 
H23 168 have now been introduced.<p/>
H23 169 <p_>83. It emerged during my investigation of a further complaint 
H23 170 that the regulations governing the assessment by the Board of a 
H23 171 solicitor's costs did not provide for a legally aided person to 
H23 172 make representations to the Board about the costs claimed by the 
H23 173 solicitor, even though that person might have a financial interest 
H23 174 in the outcome by virtue of the contribution towards the costs in 
H23 175 an action which he or she could be required to pay. I was glad to 
H23 176 learn from the Chief Executive of the Board that the Civil Legal 
H23 177 Aid (General) (Amendment)(No 2) Regulations 1991 were being 
H23 178 introduced to fill that lacuna.<p/>
H23 179 <p_>84. In paragraph 58 of my Annual Report for 1990 I referred to 
H23 180 the welcome resolution by the coming into operation on 1 January 
H23 181 1991 of section 110 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 of a 
H23 182 longstanding jurisdictional problem which had inhibited the 
H23 183 attempts of my predecessors to investigate complaints against the 
H23 184 administrative actions of court staff in England and Wales. That 
H23 185 section provides, broadly speaking, that I can investigate 
H23 186 administrative actions taken by court or tribunal staff appointed 
H23 187 by the Lord Chancellor unless the actions concerned are taken at 
H23 188 the direction, or on the authority (whether express or implied), of 
H23 189 any person acting in a judicial capacity or in his capacity as a 
H23 190 member of the tribunal. I alluded also to possible jurisdictional 
H23 191 difficulties which might still be encountered but in 1991 at least 
H23 192 they have not materialised. Equivalent actions taken by the staff 
H23 193 of tribunals for which the Lord Chancellor is not responsible 
H23 194 remain outside my jurisdiction. As I understand it, that is not 
H23 195 because it is thought they should so remain but for the want of a 
H23 196 suitable legislative vehicle which will enable the omission to be 
H23 197 remedied. I hope that one will be identified soon for the anomaly 
H23 198 is not one I find easy to explain.
H23 199 
H24   1 <#FLOB:H24\><h_><p_>FIRE PREVENTION<p/><h/>
H24   2 <p_>13.1. Fire prevention activity is concerned not only with 
H24   3 averting fire, but also with protecting people and property from 
H24   4 the effects of fire.<p/>
H24   5 <p_>13.2. Table 13.i shows the number of fatalities, casualties and 
H24   6 people rescued from fires attended by fire brigades for the 
H24   7 calendar years 1985-1989.<p/>
H24   8 <p_><O_>table<O/><p/>
H24   9 <p_>13.3. Table 13.ii shows the estimated value of insured property 
H24  10 lost in fires over the same period.<p/>
H24  11 <p_><O_>table<O/><p/>
H24  12 <p_>13.4. The Home Office administers the Fire Precautions Act 
H24  13 1971, which requires (among other things) fire certificates to be 
H24  14 obtained for larger offices, shops, factories and railway premises. 
H24  15 New requirements for fire precautions in underground railway 
H24  16 stations were introduced in 1989 by means of regulations made under 
H24  17 this Act following the fire at King's Cross in November 1987.<p/>
H24  18 <p_>13.5. The Act is enforced by fire authorities. The Home Office 
H24  19 issues guidance to fire authorities from time to time to assist 
H24  20 them in enforcing the Act effectively and consistently.<p/>
H24  21 <p_>13.6. The Home Office works with the fire insurance industry, 
H24  22 through the Loss Prevention Council and the Fire Protection 
H24  23 Association, to ensure a co-ordinated approach on fire prevention 
H24  24 publicity and education. The Home Office has run television 
H24  25 advertising campaigns in 1989-90 and 1990-91 to encourage the 
H24  26 installation of domestic smoke alarms (see chapter 21).<p/>
H24  27 <p_>13.7. The Home Office runs a fire research programme, 
H24  28 expenditure on which was around pounds1 million in 1989-90. This is 
H24  29 aimed at ensuring that the latest scientific advice is available on 
H24  30 fire prevention issues and on matters affecting the fire service's 
H24  31 operational efficiency and the health of firefighters.<p/>
H24  32 <h_><p_>EMERGENCY PLANNING<p/>
H24  33 <p_>CIVIL EMERGENCIES<p/><h/>
H24  34 <p_>14.1. Arrangements for the handling of civil emergencies in the 
H24  35 UK have traditionally been a matter largely for local decision, 
H24  36 with the emergency services generally being expected to provide the 
H24  37 immediate response. An unprecedented number of major disasters in 
H24  38 recent years has led to a reassessment of the effectiveness of this 
H24  39 decentralised approach. In 1988, the Home Secretary set up a review 
H24  40 of current arrangements. The main conclusion of the review was that 
H24  41 the immediate response to such emergencies should remain at the 
H24  42 local level but that more should be done to encourage and develop 
H24  43 co-ordination between local services. The review also concluded 
H24  44 that better arrangements were needed at national level to oversee 
H24  45 the development of a more co-ordinated approach to emergency 
H24  46 planning and to address practical issues raised by recent 
H24  47 disasters.<p/>
H24  48 <p_>14.2. To help meet these objectives the Home Secretary 
H24  49 appointed a Civil Emergencies Adviser (Mr David Brook CB CBE). His 
H24  50 role is to ensure that local emergency planners work together in a 
H24  51 way that best helps rescue efforts and that ensures best practice 
H24  52 is identified, widely disseminated and acted upon. The Adviser, 
H24  53 supported by a small secretariat within the Home Office, is 
H24  54 currently putting together detailed guidance on the handling of 
H24  55 peacetime disasters. This is based partly on information obtained 
H24  56 during a programme of visits around the country to meet those 
H24  57 involved in handling disasters. The cost of the Civil Emergencies 
H24  58 Adviser and his staff is around pounds200,000 a year.<p/>
H24  59 <p_>14.3. In support of these arrangements, the Emergency Planning 
H24  60 College (formerly the Civil Defence College) has been given an 
H24  61 additional objective: to study questions of peacetime emergency 
H24  62 planning. Consultants have been appointed to consider how the best 
H24  63 to carry this out. (See also paragraph 14.8 below.)<p/>
H24  64 <h_><p_>CIVIL DEFENCE<p/><h/>
H24  65 <p_>14.4. The Government's policy is to secure a basic level of 
H24  66 civil defence preparedness in peacetime which could be enhanced 
H24  67 rapidly if the risk of war increased. Together with the Cabinet 
H24  68 Office, the Home Office co-ordinates policy on civil defence. It is 
H24  69 directly responsible for warning and monitoring arrangements and 
H24  70 also for the monitoring and co-ordination of local authority civil 
H24  71 defence activities (see paragraph 14.10 below). Table 14.i shows 
H24  72 Home office expenditure on civil defence.<p/>
H24  73 <p_><O_>table<O/><p/>
H24  74 <p_>14.5. The scale and extent of measures needed to implement the 
H24  75 Government's policy depend crucially on the level and nature of the 
H24  76 external threat. In October 1990, the Home Secretary announced that 
H24  77 he had initiated a review of the options for the future of civil 
H24  78 defence arrangements in the light of developments in East-West 
H24  79 relations. The outcome of this review, in conjunction with advice 
H24  80 provided by the Civil Emergencies Adviser, will enable him to 
H24  81 consider whether a more coherent approach to emergency planning for 
H24  82 the protection of the public in both peace and war could be 
H24  83 achieved.<p/>
H24  84 <h_><p_>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON CIVIL DEFENCE<p/><h/>
H24  85 <p_>14.6. Table 14.i sets out Home Office central government 
H24  86 expenditure on civil defence, which covers central services and 
H24  87 communications, as well as the cost of the Emergency Planning 
H24  88 College and Warning and Monitoring Organisation. Most of the 
H24  89 expenditure on central services goes on accommodation and capital 
H24  90 costs for regional government headquarters in England and Wales, 
H24  91 the reimbursement of police civil defence costs (mainly in support 
H24  92 of the Warning and Monitoring Organisation), research and 
H24  93 development, and the maintenance and storage of radiation 
H24  94 monitoring and emergency fire service equipment (notably the 
H24  95 so-called 'Green Goddesses'). Following a successful market testing 
H24  96 exercise, which identified significant potential cost savings, the 
H24  97 storage and maintenance of the emergency fire service stockpile is 
H24  98 to be contracted out in spring 1991.<p/>
H24  99 <p_>14.7. The emergency communication network which links regional 
H24 100 government headquarters with local authority emergency centres, 
H24 101 police and fire services is being modernised with the objective of 
H24 102 developing it into a fully automatic system by 1992-93 (see Table 
H24 103 14.ii).<p/>
H24 104 <p_><O_>table<O/><p/>
H24 105 <h_><p_>EMERGENCY PLANNING COLLEGE<p/><h/>
H24 106 <p_>14.8. The Emergency Planning College's main purpose is to 
H24 107 provide training in civil defence for central and local government, 
H24 108 public services, the armed forces, the police, commerce and 
H24 109 industry. Around 2,500 students are expected to attend formal 
H24 110 courses and seminars there during 1990-91. Figure 14.i shows the 
H24 111 backgrounds from which students are drawn. In 1988, following an 
H24 112 internal review, the Home Secretary decided that the College should 
H24 113 adopt a greater analytical and developmental role in relation to 
H24 114 civil defence policy and should concentrate on training senior 
H24 115 staff. As Table 14.iii shows, this change of emphasis has resulted 
H24 116 in a fall in student numbers from a peak of around 3,000 in 
H24 117 1986-87. The measures announced by the Home Secretary following his 
H24 118 review of peacetime emergency arrangements (see paragraph 14.1 
H24 119 above) included a wider remit for the College to address questions 
H24 120 of peacetime emergency. The extra non-tutorial work which this will 
H24 121 involve is expected to lead to a further slight drop in student 
H24 122 throughput over the period 1991-92 to 1993-94.<p/>

H24 124 <h_><p_>UNITED KINGDOM WARNING AND MONITORING ORGANISATION 
H24 125 (UKWMO)<p/><h/>
H24 126 <p_>14.9. A Home Office review of the United Kingdom's warning and 
H24 127 monitoring arrangements in 1987 and 1988 resulted in a number of 
H24 128 detailed studies and technical scrutinies to establish the best way 
H24 129 of modernising the existing system and automating the functions 
H24 130 associated with monitoring. This work will now be taken forward 
H24 131 within the wider context of the review of civil defence (see 
H24 132 paragraph 14.5 above).<p/>
H24 133 <h_><p_>LOCAL AUTHORITY EXPENDITURE ON CIVIL DEFENCE<p/><h/>
H24 134 <p_>14.10. Local authorities are required by the Civil Defence 
H24 135 (General Local Authority Functions) Regulations 1983 to:<p/>
H24 136 <p_><*_>square<*/>prepare plans for wartime emergencies;<p/>
H24 137 <p_><*_>square<*/>provide emergency centres and appropriate 
H24 138 communications;<p/>
H24 139 <p_><*_>square<*/>ensure that key staff are identified, trained and 
H24 140 take part in exercises; and<p/>
H24 141 <p_><*_>square<*/>recruit, train and exercise volunteer members of 
H24 142 the public.<p/>
H24 143 <p_>To assist them in fulfilling their statutory responsibilities, 
H24 144 they receive specific grant payments from the Home Office (mainly 
H24 145 at 100 per cent, but on some items at 75 per cent). In 1986, the 
H24 146 Home Office introduced a planned programme for implementation (PPI) 
H24 147 of the 1983 Regulations. This is a rolling programme, setting broad 
H24 148 priorities and a series of targets for work activity as well as 
H24 149 providing information to allow systematic monitoring by the Home 
H24 150 Office. Priority was initially given to the development of detailed 
H24 151 operational plans. However, in the fourth and fifth years of the 
H24 152 programme (1989-90 and 1990-91) the emphasis shifted towards the 
H24 153 validation and revision of plans, the training of key staff and the 
H24 154 provision of emergency centres. The first two of these activities 
H24 155 will remain the focus of effort in 1991-92. The programme of 
H24 156 construction of new emergency centres has been halted pending the 
H24 157 outcome of the civil defence review, though the Home Office will 
H24 158 continue to pay capital grant at the rate of 75 per cent and issue 
H24 159 credit approvals (loan sanction) for centres already under 
H24 160 construction.<p/>
H24 161 <h_><p_>MONITORING OF PERFORMANCE<p/><h/>
H24 162 <p_>14.11. Plans and facilities at national, regional and country 
H24 163 level are regularly tested to establish the overall level of 
H24 164 preparedness. The Home Office encourages local authorities to test 
H24 165 the effectiveness of their plans and gives practical support in the 
H24 166 planning, conduct and evaluation of regional exercises. During 
H24 167 1990, exercises were held in the North East and London regions and 
H24 168 reports setting out the lessons learned will be circulated to all 
H24 169 local authorities. Within the Home Office, an assessment is made of 
H24 170 individual local authorities' plans by comparing their coverage 
H24 171 with a model outline framework and with operating details distilled 
H24 172 from plans submitted under the PPI initiative. The latest 
H24 173 information available shows that:<p/>
H24 174 <p_><*_>square<*/>77 per cent of authorities assessed have now 
H24 175 produced a comprehensive plan framework with over 50 per cent of 
H24 176 the operating details complete;<p/>
H24 177 <p_><*_>square<*/>18 per cent have a partially completed framework 
H24 178 with between 10 and 50 per cent of the necessary operating details; 
H24 179 and<p/>
H24 180 <p_><*_>square<*/>4.5 per cent have a partially completed framework 
H24 181 with up to 10 per cent of the operating details.<p/>
H24 182 <p_>In the telecommunications field, progress in the programme of 
H24 183 replacement and modernisation of the emergency communications 
H24 184 network is measured by performance indicators based on the numbers 
H24 185 and types of equipment installed. The effectiveness and efficiency 
H24 186 of police civil defence activity is monitored by HM Inspectorate of 
H24 187 Constabulary through the rolling 3-4 year programme of inspection 
H24 188 of all provincial forces which began in July 1990 (see paragraph 
H24 189 4.25).<p/>
H24 190 <h_><p_>COMMUNITY SERVICES<p/><h/>
H24 191 <p_>15.1. The Home Office Voluntary Services Unit (VSU) 
H24 192 co-ordinates the Government's interests in the UK voluntary sector. 
H24 193 Its main objectives are:<p/>
H24 194 <p_><*_>square<*/>to promote voluntary activity and to support a 
H24 195 cost-effective voluntary sector through grant<?_>-<?/>giving and 
H24 196 other means;<p/>
H24 197 <p_><*_>square<*/>to discharge Home Office responsibilities for 
H24 198 charities and charity law; and <p/>
H24 199 <p_><*_>square<*/>to co-ordinate effective arrangements for the 
H24 200 reception and resettlement of refugees.<p/>
H24 201 <p_><O_>table<O/><p/>
H24 202 <p_>The main grants paid by the Home Office are summarised in Table 
H24 203 15.i.<p/>
H24 204 <h_><p_>VOLUNTARY SECTOR GRANTS<p/><h/>
H24 205 <p_>15.2. The VSU can make grants:<p/>
H24 206 <p_><*_>square<*/>to national voluntary organisations whose work 
H24 207 spans the interests of three or more Government Departments;<p/>
H24 208 <p_><*_>square<*/>to support innovatory local projects; and<p/>
H24 209 <p_><*_>square<*/>to assist (with bridging grants on a 
H24 210 'last-resort' basis) organisations working in areas of high social 
H24 211 priority where alternative funds will be available within a short 
H24 212 time.<p/>
H24 213 <p_>15.3. The Women's Royal Voluntary Service (WRVS) has 170,000 
H24 214 members and provides a range of services to the community, 
H24 215 including meals-on-wheels, and hospital and family welfare 
H24 216 services. The grant to the WRVS covers the administrative costs of 
H24 217 the organisation's headquarters and local offices network.<p/>
H24 218 <p_>15.4. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) 
H24 219 is the main umbrella body for voluntary organisations in England 
H24 220 and the main channel of communication between the voluntary sector 
H24 221 and Government. It provides information and advisory services to 
H24 222 its members and to the voluntary sector as a whole. The Home 
H24 223 Office's grant in aid is a contribution towards the organisation's 
H24 224 core costs.<p/>
H24 225 <p_>15.5. Of the other grants, the three main ones are the core 
H24 226 grants to the Community Development Foundation (CDF) - pounds0.9 
H24 227 million in 1990-91; the Volunteer Centre (UK) - pounds0.7 million; 
H24 228 and Community Service Volunteers (CSV) - pounds0.6 million. CDF is 
H24 229 a non-departmental public body which pioneers new forms of 
H24 230 community development; runs demonstration projects in conjunction 
H24 231 with local authorities; and disseminates best practice in community 
H24 232 development. The Volunteer Centre (UK) promotes volunteering and 
H24 233 advises voluntary bodies on best practice in the recruitment and 
H24 234 use of volunteers. CSV recruits volunteers for a wide range of 
H24 235 services in the community.<p/>
H24 236 <p_>15.6 The report of the <tf_>Efficiency Scrutiny of Government 
H24 237 Funding of the Voluntary Sector<tf/>, published in 1990, 
H24 238 recommended that VSU should develop a strategy which would relate 
H24 239 its grant giving much more closely to its own policy objectives. 
H24 240 VSU should in future concentrate its funding on work which supports 
H24 241 the voluntary sector as a whole or promotes volunteering, community 
H24 242 development or self-help.

H25   2 <p_>The Chair of Cardiac Surgery at the Royal Postgraduate Medical 
H25   3 School, University of London is held by <tf_>Professor Ken 
H25   4 Taylor<tf/>. He reviews the progress of cardiac surgery over the 
H25   5 last 30 years and forecasts ways in which it can be assisted by new 
H25   6 drugs and techniques.<p/>
H25   7 <p_><quote_>"There's nothing magical about surgery on the heart but 
H25   8 the heart-lung bypass machine is a unique feature which keeps the 
H25   9 patient alive during the operation by taking over the function of 
H25  10 the heart and lungs."<quote/> Professor Taylor's speciality is the 
H25  11 technology associated with the heart-lung machine.<p/>
H25  12 <p_>In the 1950s open heart surgery was in its infancy. Once a 
H25  13 consensus had emerged in the late 60s of a reasonably reliable and 
H25  14 safe way of using heart-lung bypass machinery, there was an 
H25  15 explosion in the number of operations for valve replacement, 
H25  16 coronary artery surgery and the correction of deformities in the 
H25  17 hearts of babies and young children. In the 70s the emphasis turned 
H25  18 to the development of surgical techniques with a corresponding 
H25  19 reduction in the mortality rate. Within the last ten years there 
H25  20 has been intense activity with new techniques emerging almost every 
H25  21 month and the question has been how to get rid of all the risks 
H25  22 associated with surgery.<p/>
H25  23 <p_><quote_>"The problem now"<quote/>, says Professor Taylor, 
H25  24 <quote_>"is not mortality but morbidity. When blood passes over 
H25  25 artificial materials a cascade of changes takes place, producing 
H25  26 abnormal functions in many bodily systems. The impetus now is to 
H25  27 make the support machinery as near to normal physiology - the way 
H25  28 the body works - as possible."<quote/><p/>
H25  29 <p_>Basic scientific research is being carried out in several 
H25  30 areas. One is the effect on blood cells of artificial materials. 
H25  31 The cells tend to react in a defensive way and cause inflammation 
H25  32 throughout the body. The effects of that inflammation response are 
H25  33 seen in various parts of the body including the lungs, the brain 
H25  34 and in blood-clotting processes. Bio-materials are being developed 
H25  35 which, it is hoped, will not be recognised by blood cells as being 
H25  36 artificial. Drugs to block the inflammatory process are being 
H25  37 developed and the use of Aprotinin in this context, pioneered at 
H25  38 Hammersmith Hospital in 1985, is used in 80% of all heart 
H25  39 operations in Germany. It is now being licensed throughout the 
H25  40 world. <quote_>"It is profoundly effective in its ability to reduce 
H25  41 blood loss following cardiac surgery and consequently blood 
H25  42 transfusion is becoming less necessary, reducing the risk of 
H25  43 transmitting viral diseases."<quote/><p/>
H25  44 <p_>Research is also focusing on brain functions during cardiac 
H25  45 surgery. BHF-funded research has revealed that the eye is a useful 
H25  46 and accurate indicator of cerebral circulation before, during and 
H25  47 after surgery. <quote_>"It's a window on the circulation of the 
H25  48 whole brain"<quote/>, says Professor Taylor. The blood supply to 
H25  49 the retina is an integral part of the brain's own blood supply. 
H25  50 Studies have shown that within a few moments of the patient being 
H25  51 connected to the heart-lung machine, the small blood vessels in the 
H25  52 retina begin to become blocked. To prevent the blockage a new type 
H25  53 of artificial lung is used which reduces the visible abnormality in 
H25  54 the retinal circulation from 100% of patients to less than 50%.<p/>
H25  55 <p_>Professor Taylor says: <quote_>"Any patient of any age anywhere 
H25  56 who has a heart operation goes on a heart-lung machine which has 
H25  57 been developed from research funded by BHF."<quote/> The 
H25  58 Hammersmith team are confident that continuing research in this 
H25  59 area will make cardiac surgery even safer for patients by helping 
H25  60 to achieve bio-compatibility between the artificial lung and the 
H25  61 patient's physiology.<p/>
H25  62 <p_>It has also been discovered that arteries are far stronger than 
H25  63 veins when used in coronary grafting. <quote_>"They seem to last 
H25  64 indefinitely"<quote/>, says Professor Taylor.<p/>
H25  65 <p_>There are now moves towards looking at long-term results in 
H25  66 various categories of patients. A unit set up by the Department of 
H25  67 Health in 1986 at Hammersmith Hospital registers every artificial 
H25  68 heart valve in use in the UK and is able to make comparisons 
H25  69 between the ways different countries use their valves, select their 
H25  70 patients and use their resources.<p/>
H25  71 <p_>Fifteen years ago Professor Taylor received his first research 
H25  72 funding from the British Heart Foundation and eight years ago he 
H25  73 was appointed to the Chair of Cardiac Surgery. He says: 
H25  74 <quote_>"The Junior Research Fellowship option funded by the 
H25  75 Foundation is a superb way of introducing bright young research 
H25  76 trainees to cardiac surgery. I think it's an absolutely excellent 
H25  77 scheme. The techniques which are being pioneered here are being 
H25  78 used in many parts of the world today."<quote/><p/>

H25  80 <h_><p_>Genetics - the medicine of tomorrow<p/><h/>
H25  81 <p_><tf_>Professor John Burn<tf/>, Director of the Northern Region 
H25  82 Genetics Service at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, looks at 
H25  83 30 years of development in one of the most dynamically growing 
H25  84 disciplines in medicine.<p/>
H25  85 <p_>The changing pattern of disease has combined with dramatic 
H25  86 scientific advances over the last 30 years to bring clinical 
H25  87 genetics to the fore. In 1961 centres around the world were rushing 
H25  88 to apply the new technique which made it possible to show that 
H25  89 children with Down's syndrome had an extra small chromosome. In 
H25  90 that year several other syndromes involving heart malformation were 
H25  91 shown to be due to a chromosome fault.<p/>
H25  92 <p_><quote_>"In the 70s new banding techniques made possible the 
H25  93 recognition of faults within chromosomes and cases where the fault 
H25  94 might recur in the family. Meanwhile obstetricians began to develop 
H25  95 in the mid-70s the techniques to allow prenatal diagnosis of these 
H25  96 faults"<quote/>, explains Professor Burn.<p/>
H25  97 <p_><quote_>"In the 60s dozens of new rare diseases were identified 
H25  98 caused by failure of individual genes to produce essential enzyme 
H25  99 catalysts. Since then the chemical pathways of the body have 
H25 100 yielded many of their secrets and we understand more clearly how, 
H25 101 for example, the body handles fats or causes the blood to clot at 
H25 102 the right and wrong times. Very often genetic faults are 
H25 103 discovered, such as the variety of faults in the lipoprotein 
H25 104 receptor, which lead to familial hypercholesterolaemia. The ability 
H25 105 to diagnose and in some cases treat such single gene faults has 
H25 106 been made possible by the revolution in molecular genetics which, 
H25 107 particularly in the 80s, allowed us to study individual genes and 
H25 108 learn all about their structure and function.<p/>
H25 109 <p_><quote_>"A major challenge for our own unit in the coming 
H25 110 decade will be to use these latest techniques alongside traditional 
H25 111 clinical studies to learn why over 4,000 children are born each 
H25 112 year with a malformed heart. Thanks to surgical advances 30 years 
H25 113 ago, we now have a growing number of young adults whose heart 
H25 114 defects have been successfully treated, but many of them fear for 
H25 115 the health of their children. We have traced 750 young adults 
H25 116 operated on around Britain for the most serious heart defects to 
H25 117 see what happened to their children. Four per cent of their 
H25 118 children have heart malformations and the chance is higher if the 
H25 119 mother has the heart defect. This may be because the genes 
H25 120 inherited in the egg play a greater role in the heart development 
H25 121 than those from the father. This variation between the parents is 
H25 122 called imprinting and may be one reason why genetic faults which 
H25 123 cause heart defects do not show themselves every time. Chance 
H25 124 factors may also decide whether someone with a faulty gene will 
H25 125 have a heart defect.<p/>
H25 126 <p_><quote_>"When we identify families with several affected 
H25 127 members we are comparing their DNA to see which genes they have in 
H25 128 common. This process is more feasible when we have a candidate gene 
H25 129 - one which we know can cause the heart to develop incorrectly. Our 
H25 130 main interest at present is in a small area of chromosome 22 which 
H25 131 is usually missing in children with a rare pattern of problems 
H25 132 called Di-George syndrome. This pattern was first recognised in 
H25 133 1965 and combines faults in the immune system and low calcium 
H25 134 levels due to a hormone fault. The heart is often malformed. In 
H25 135 collaboration with colleagues at St Mary's Hospital, London, we are 
H25 136 seeking the faulty gene and using the new genetic techniques to see 
H25 137 whether faults at this point on chromosome 22 can cause similar 
H25 138 heart defects without the other features of the syndrome. This 
H25 139 project, like our 'offspring' study, is funded by the British Heart 
H25 140 Foundation which is the major 'shareholder' in our cardiovascular 
H25 141 research team. Learning why so many children are born with heart 
H25 142 defects will take a long time. Thanks to the vision of BHF we have 
H25 143 made a beginning. I hope the next 30 years will bring us some 
H25 144 answers to the question 'why?' for only then will true prevention 
H25 145 become possible."<quote/><p/>

H25 165 Scotland has a defibrillator, a programme is in hand to improve 
H25 166 further the chances of survival of patients with heart attack.<p/>
H25 167 <p_>Meanwhile, there has been a resurgence of interest in 
H25 168 thrombolytic 'clotbusting' research and treatment in the last ten 
H25 169 years, preliminary clinical tests having first been carried out in 
H25 170 the 40s. While in the United States Professor Fox and colleagues 
H25 171 undertook the original experimental studies with new-generation 
H25 172 thrombolytic agents in 1981. The important 'clotbusters' still 
H25 173 carry a risk of reclosure of the artery after drug treatment and we 
H25 174 need to know more so that the treatment can be maximised and the 
H25 175 harmful effect minimised.<p/>
H25 176 <p_>There is a need now to find out what happens before the vessel 
H25 177 becomes blocked. It is very important that patients at high risk 
H25 178 are identified by their blood-borne markers, the platelets which 
H25 179 clot the blood, in conjunction with the use of electrocardiograms 
H25 180 and angiography. Research is now progressing in the development of 
H25 181 anti-platelet agents.<p/>
H25 182 <p_><quote_>"In 1986 very few people with clear-cut symptoms were 
H25 183 being treated with thrombolytics - only about 4%"<quote/>, says 
H25 184 Professor Fox. <quote_>"Today they are the treatment of choice in 
H25 185 more than 70%. The emphasis on thrombolysis has increased our 
H25 186 awareness of what happens before the clot develops."<quote/><p/>
H25 187 <p_>Of the contribution made by the British Heart Foundation to his 
H25 188 department's work, he says: <quote_>"BHF is not just supporting 
H25 189 research which would otherwise be underfunded; it is permitting the 
H25 190 development of new areas of research. Without this support academic 
H25 191 cardiology in Britain would be in a disastrous 
H25 192 situation."<quote/><p/>
H25 193 <p_>The Cardiovascular Research Unit has been specialising in the 
H25 194 problems of heart disease in Scotland. In 1978 the first inkling 
H25 195 came that diet might in some way affect the incidence of heart 
H25 196 disease and in 1984 a study discovered that people who had less 
H25 197 linoleic acid in their body and diets were more prone to coronary 
H25 198 heart disease. In 1987 firm data from a huge study of 6,000 
H25 199 patients confirmed the theory.<p/>
H25 200 <p_><quote_>"We discovered that people with low levels of linoleic 
H25 201 acid eat less of this essential fatty acid and are more likely to 
H25 202 smoke and drink more. There has been a general change and an 
H25 203 improvement in diet over the last 12 years. Plant oils, such as 
H25 204 those found in sunflower margarine, are rich in linoleic acid and 
H25 205 are much more available - supermarkets have played a big part. The 
H25 206 health education message has got through to the better-educated 
H25 207 sector of the public and we have to hope that it will eventually 
H25 208 filter through to all sectors of the community."<quote/><p/>
H25 209 
H26   1 <#FLOB:H26\><h_><p_>David Skae<p/><h/>
H26   2 <p_>According to Clouston (1911<tf|>b), Dr William MacKinnon, the 
H26   3 first Superintendent of the Royal Edinburgh Asylum, had provided 
H26   4 elementary lectures for medical students during his period of 
H26   5 office. In 1850, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh 
H26   6 passed a motion suggesting that formal instruction in mental 
H26   7 disease should be provided at the Morningside asylum. The impetus 
H26   8 had originated from the East India Company, which required its 
H26   9 doctors to have some knowledge of mental disease. The Asylum Board 
H26  10 of Management eventually approved the scheme, and on 7 May 1853, 
H26  11 David Skae (pictured in Fig. 3.5, p. 47), who had succeeded 
H26  12 MacKinnon, gave his first lecture (Skae, 1853).<p/>
H26  13 <p_>Skae's 1853 course involved a clinical lecture on a Saturday 
H26  14 and thrice-weekly tours of the asylum in the company of one of the 
H26  15 medical officers, who would demonstrate interesting patients, 
H26  16 encountered <tf_>en passant<tf/>. By Clouston's time, at the end of 
H26  17 the decade, Skae was giving two lectures weekly but the asylum 
H26  18 visit had been reduced to one each week. According to Laycock 
H26  19 (1869), Skae's class depended for its numbers upon the army and 
H26  20 navy requirement of certificates of competence in mental disease. 
H26  21 When their respective boards abolished this requirement, the 
H26  22 numbers fell and Skae was forced to abandon the class.<p/>
H26  23 <p_>Skae taught that mental diseases were brain diseases and was 
H26  24 interested in organic disorder, moral insanity, and medicolegal 
H26  25 problems (Skae, 1858, 1860, 1861, 1867; Clouston, 1873<tf|>b). As 
H26  26 indicated above, Skae (1863) felt that his major contribution was 
H26  27 his classification of mental diseases, a system which even his most 
H26  28 sympathetic biographer, Fish (1965), admits was <quote_>"best 
H26  29 forgotten"<quote/>. It is not appropriate to give a detailed 
H26  30 consideration of Skae's system here, but it is worth noting the 
H26  31 clinical significance it held for Clouston (1895), who was to 
H26  32 write:<p/>
H26  33 <p_><quote_>"In large degree it is founded on bodily causation- 
H26  34 'the somato-etiological'. Its great merit is that it helps the 
H26  35 practising physician in his efforts to discover the causes of the 
H26  36 insanity and also assists him in his treatment and prognoses. It 
H26  37 seizes on the bodily and constitutional relationships of the mental 
H26  38 symptoms, and groups the latter accordingly."<quote/><p/>
H26  39 <p_>Skae's classification met with much opposition at the time 
H26  40 (e.g. Tuke, 1870; Crichton-Browne, 1875; <tf_>Journal of 
H26  41 Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology<tf/>, 1877). 
H26  42 Crichton-Browne had pronounced it <quote_>"Philosophically unsound, 
H26  43 scientifically inaccurate and practically useless"<quote/>. Browne 
H26  44 also used the opportunity to castigate the entire Edinburgh School, 
H26  45 and seized upon a remark Clouston had made about the 
H26  46 classification, <quote_>"excluding everything mental"<quote/>. 
H26  47 Crichton-Browne saw this as an example of Morningside's antipathy 
H26  48 to the mental and metaphysical aspects of man. He scoffed that: 
H26  49 <quote_>"The physician who limits himself to the outside view of 
H26  50 humanity must remain below the level of an intelligent 
H26  51 dog"<quote/>. However, despite the hostility and its lack of 
H26  52 general acceptance (Robinson, 1988), Clouston (1876<tf|>a) 
H26  53 continued to defend the classification; as late as 1894, he was 
H26  54 claiming that Skae's system was <quote_>"the most useful yet 
H26  55 devised"<quote/>.<p/>
H26  56 <h_><p_>Thomas Laycock<p/><h/>
H26  57 <p_>The most important figure in Edinburgh psychiatry at this time 
H26  58 was undoubtedly Thomas Laycock, Professor of the Practice of 
H26  59 Medicine (Fig. 24.4). Laycock had been elected to the Chair in 1855 
H26  60 and became the first Englishman to occupy the senior professorship 
H26  61 in medicine at Edinburgh. He had previously worked in York, where 
H26  62 he greatly influenced Hughlings Jackson, the eminent neurologist, 
H26  63 and Danziger (1982) has lauded him as the most original of all the 
H26  64 British mid-century psychologists. Laycock was among the first to 
H26  65 argue that a science of mental life was possible- that the mind 
H26  66 could be studied using the principles of physiology. In his classic 
H26  67 book, <tf_>Mind and Brain<tf/> (1860), he sought to develop a 
H26  68 <quote_>"scientific Cerebral Psychology"<quote/> which would unite 
H26  69 philosophy and physiology. He believed that medicine and biology, 
H26  70 not metaphysics, represented the proper foundation for psychology 
H26  71 (Hearnshaw, 1964). Laycock argued that the mind/body problem was 
H26  72 resolvable in terms of a psychophysical parallelism; that 
H26  73 consciousness could accompany brain processes, but did not interact 
H26  74 with them. An important concept in this grand synthesis was the 
H26  75 reflex, and he was the first thinker to extend the reflex function 
H26  76 to the brain (Smith, 1970, 1981; Jacyna, 1980<tf|>b, 1981). 
H26  77 Clouston (1894<tf|>c) was later to write of him:<p/>
H26  78 <p_><quote_>"He promulgated the law of reflex action of the brain, 
H26  79 and in my opinion anticipated Spencer and Darwin. He was a daring 
H26  80 speculator and thinker. He was not afraid of startling conclusions, 
H26  81 tried to include all mental phenomena, in animals and man, in 
H26  82 health and disease, within his generalizations, and was the most 
H26  83 suggestive writer on the subject at the time."<quote/><p/>
H26  84 <p_>Laycock did much to improve the study of insanity. In 1857, he 
H26  85 obtained a sanction from the university for putting a question on 
H26  86 mental diseases in the MD degree, for the first time in Britain 
H26  87 (Clouston, 1879<tf|>a). In 1861, he instituted an examination for 
H26  88 those studying mental diseases. Seven years later, he called for a 
H26  89 formal course of lectures and examinations for doctors wishing to 
H26  90 pursue an asylum career, in an attempt to improve both the 
H26  91 standards and morale among asylum doctors, but, unfortunately, this 
H26  92 came to nothing (<tf_>Journal of Mental Science<tf/>, 1861; 
H26  93 Laycock, 1866, 1868, 1869).<p/>
H26  94 <p_>Laycock's most important contribution was the introduction of a 
H26  95 specialised course of lectures on 'medical psychology', the first 
H26  96 of its kind within a British university medical school (Smith, 
H26  97 1970). As Laycock wrote (1871):<p/>
H26  98 <p_><quote_>"The rapid development of a new school of cerebral 
H26  99 physiology and pathology (in which I had my share) rendered it year 
H26 100 by year necessary for me to introduce into practice something more 
H26 101 intelligible than the old empiricism as to mental diseases, until 
H26 102 at last at Edinburgh during the Winter session 1857-8 ... I set 
H26 103 apart one lecture in each week for a distinct course of Practical 
H26 104 Psychology. In the Summer of 1858, I was requested by the Senatus 
H26 105 Academicus to give a Summer course of lectures on Medical 
H26 106 Psychology, which I did in the following year (1859). To this 
H26 107 course I subsequently added the practical study of mental diseases 
H26 108 in an asylum."<quote/><p/>
H26 109 <p_>Laycock had intended to use the Morningside asylum for 
H26 110 teaching, but its superintendent, Skae, refused him access; no 
H26 111 doubt Skae was defending his territory, and resented the intrusion 
H26 112 of another lecturer. For his part, Laycock could often be difficult 
H26 113 and quarrelsome; rebuffed by Skae, he took his class to Millholm 
H26 114 Private Asylum in Musselburgh. Clouston recounts that there were 
H26 115 about 40 students, and practice was given in signing lunacy 
H26 116 certificates. However, within a month of the death of Skae in April 
H26 117 1873, Laycock was once again requesting permission to use the 
H26 118 Morningside asylum, and this time, it was agreed that he could 
H26 119 teach during the summer term. When Clouston arrived in August of 
H26 120 that year, Laycock approached him about teaching, and Clouston 
H26 121 (1879<tf|>a) recalled that he <quote_>"made very flattering and 
H26 122 earnest overtures to me"<quote/>. The new superintendent readily 
H26 123 accepted, and the minutes of the University Senate recorded that Dr 
H26 124 Clouston was <quote_>"to receive Dr. Laycock and his class at the 
H26 125 Asylum and to give also Clinical Instruction at visits twice a week 
H26 126 during the Summer session. Dr. Clouston will also give 
H26 127 demonstrations from time to time to Dr. Laycock's class in the 
H26 128 Pathological Anatomy of Insanity and Cognate diseases of the 
H26 129 Nervous System."<quote/> It was also recorded that as a result of 
H26 130 this new university connection, Clouston was to withdraw from the 
H26 131 Extra-Academical School, his place being filled later by Dr Batty 
H26 132 Tuke (Guthrie, 1965).<p/>
H26 133 <p_>Clouston (1879<tf|>a) greatly valued his contact with Laycock, 
H26 134 and in his later writings, frequently referred to him and employed 
H26 135 many of his fundamental ideas. <quote_>"My association with 
H26 136 him"<quote/>, he reminisced, <quote_>"was a source of the utmost 
H26 137 pleasure and much instruction to me"<quote/>.<p/>
H26 138 <h_><p_>Clouston as lecturer in mental diseases<p/><h/>
H26 139 <p_>The 19th century witnessed great changes in the Scottish 
H26 140 university system (Anderson, 1983), which Davie (1961) has seen as 
H26 141 a process of the steady 'anglification' of traditional Scottish 
H26 142 values. Of the many Scottish University Commissions which 
H26 143 deliberated in that century, the one of 1877 recommended the 
H26 144 creation of lectureships. In 1879 the University Senate instituted 
H26 145 a Lectureship in Mental Diseases, the first lectureship at 
H26 146 Edinburgh, and Thomas Clouston was appointed to the post. It is 
H26 147 clear that he was a success in his new position, and contemporaries 
H26 148 were unanimous in their praise of him as a gifted speaker. 
H26 149 Robertson (1928) wrote that he was <quote_>"one of the most 
H26 150 brilliant lecturers we have had at the University"<quote/>. Phrases 
H26 151 such as <quote|>"dazzling", <quote_>"freshness of outlook"<quote/>, 
H26 152 and <quote_>"novelty of phraseology"<quote/> were employed to 
H26 153 describe Clouston in action (Robertson, 1915; <tf|>Lancet, 1915; 
H26 154 <tf_>British Medical Journal<tf/>, 1915; <tf_>Journal of Mental 
H26 155 Science, 1915).<p/>
H26 156 <p_>As his son, Storer Clouston, recalled: <quote_>"It was really 
H26 157 his personality ... that left the deepest impression. His 
H26 158 animation, his slight frame, quivering with energy, the 
H26 159 extraordinarily bright and piercing eyes"<quote/>. An impression of 
H26 160 Clouston's lecturing style can also be gained from his textbook, 
H26 161 <tf_>Clinical Lectures on Mental Diseases<tf/>, which was based on 
H26 162 his talks to students. On one occasion, he proclaimed to them:<p/>
H26 163 <p_><quote_>"I am able to present to you, some of the most 
H26 164 remarkable personages that have ever lived. Here is Jesus Christ, 
H26 165 and here are the Prophet Elias, the Emperor of the Universe, the 
H26 166 Universal Empress, the Empress of Turkey, the only daughter of God 
H26 167 Almighty, Queen Elizabeth, four Kings of England, one King of 
H26 168 Scotland, the Duke of Kilmarnock, the inventor of perpetual motion, 
H26 169 a man who has discovered the new elixir of life ... and a lady who 
H26 170 daily and nightly has delightful conversations with the Prince of 
H26 171 Wales."<quote/> (Clouston, 1896<tf|>a)<p/>
H26 172 <p_>He was evidently something of a showman, on occasions 
H26 173 resembling a ring master in a circus of performing lunatics. In one 
H26 174 lecture, he promised to produce <quote_>"a one legged dressmaker of 
H26 175 40 ... with no personal charms"<quote/>, and in another, fretted 
H26 176 that he had no really good specimens of 'microcephalics' to show 
H26 177 his audience.<p/>
H26 178 <p_>Clouston has left a very clear account of his teaching methods 
H26 179 in <tf_>The Teaching of Psychiatric Medicine<tf/>, originally 
H26 180 delivered to the International Medical Congress in 1881. He wrote: 
H26 181 <p/>
H26 182 <p_><quote_>"My course is a Summer course of 3 months, and by far 
H26 183 the majority of students are in their fourth year ... I give 12 
H26 184 systematic lectures in the University, one a week; the students 
H26 185 come out to the asylum twice a week for clinical instruction and 
H26 186 towards the end of the course I give four systematic demonstrations 
H26 187 from specimens and diagrams, two being macroscopic and two 
H26 188 microscopic, on the pathology of insanity"<quote/> (Clouston, 
H26 189 1881<tf|>c).<p/>
H26 190 <p_>He maintained that illustrative clinical cases would 
H26 191 <quote_>"rouse the attention of every student, in the sultriest day 
H26 192 when it was flagging"<quote/>. The most important part of the 
H26 193 course was the clinical demonstration, which he described as 
H26 194 <quote_>"the backbone of teaching". Clouston had found the Skae 
H26 195 method of wandering around the asylum, in search of interesting 
H26 196 patients, too haphazard and unsystematic. Instead, he preferred to 
H26 197 bring patients into the lecture room and interview them in front of 
H26 198 the students, explaining that <quote_>"I try to direct and 
H26 199 concentrate their attention on the one point to be illustrated by 
H26 200 each case. My object is to create in each student's mind a vivid 
H26 201 sense of the direct connection of brain derangement with ... 
H26 202 mind"<quote/>. Discussion of the case usually occurred after the 
H26 203 patient had left the room. Students were also expected to see 
H26 204 patients on their own, make a diagnosis, and sign a medical 
H26 205 certificate of lunacy.<p/>
H26 206 <p_>Clouston's lecture course was popular with the students and it 
H26 207 was well subscribed. An article in the Edinburgh <tf|>Student 
H26 208 magazine of 1907 gives a mockingly affectionate tribute to Clouston 
H26 209 the lecturer, depicting him in his frock coat and striped 
H26 210 trousers.<p/>
H26 211 <p_><quote_>"Here is Clouston as you see,<p/>
H26 212 <p_>Warbling of Insanity,...<p/>
H26 213 <p_>Thomas, garrulous and kind,<p/>
H26 214 <p_>Gives them Hygiene of the Mind."<quote/><p/>
H26 215 <p_>During his tenure, Clouston also fought to make the study of 
H26 216 mental diseases part of the medical curriculum, and in 1890 he put 
H26 217 this to the Scottish Universities Commission. In 1893, psychiatry 
H26 218 was made a compulsory subject for all medical students by the 
H26 219 General Medical Council, which Clouston (1911<tf|>b) greeted as the 
H26 220 <quote_>"charter for our real and full incorporation into general 
H26 221 medicine".<p/>

H27   1 <#FLOB:H27\><h_><p_>ICI fertiliser sale blocked but Woodchester 
H27   2 purchase given go-ahead<p/>
H27   3 <p_>Rulings on state-owned bids<p/>
H27   4 <p_>By Robert Rice, Legal Correspondent<p/><h/>
H27   5 <p_>ONE takeover bid by a state-owned foreign company was blocked 
H27   6 yesterday and one was allowed, in the first test of the UK 
H27   7 government's new approach to such bids.<p/>
H27   8 <p_>The proposed acquisition of ICI Fertilisers by Kemira, the 
H27   9 Finnish state-owned chemical company, was stopped by Mr Peter 
H27  10 Lilley, UK trade and industry secretary.<p/>
H27  11 <p_>His decision follows a report by the Monopolies and Mergers 
H27  12 Commission that the acquisition raised significant competition 
H27  13 issues and might be expected to operate against the public interest 
H27  14 - partly because of Kemira's ownership by the state.<p/>
H27  15 <p_>Separately, Mr Lilley gave the go-ahead to the acquisition by 
H27  16 Cr<*_>e-acute<*/>dit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, of a 45 
H27  17 per cent interest in Woodchester Investments, an Irish-based 
H27  18 finance company with interests in Britain.<p/>
H27  19 <p_>A monopolies commission investigation had concluded that there 
H27  20 was no justification for blocking the deal on competition grounds. 
H27  21 The secretary of state has no power to act against a merger after 
H27  22 such a ruling.<p/>
H27  23 <p_>Last July Mr Lilley said the government would not allow 
H27  24 Britain's policy of privatisation and competition to be undermined 
H27  25 by <quote_>"nationalisation by the back door"<quote/>.<p/>
H27  26 <p_>ICI said yesterday the decision would further weaken the UK 
H27  27 fertiliser industry. Kemira said the monopolies commission's fears 
H27  28 for competition in the UK fertiliser market were <quote_>"wholly 
H27  29 misplaced"<quote/> and that the decision would hurt UK output and 
H27  30 jobs.<p/>
H27  31 <p_>The commission concluded that the acquisition would lead to 
H27  32 significantly less competition in the UK market. The number of 
H27  33 manufacturers would drop from three to two: Kemira and the 
H27  34 Norwegian-owned Hydro Fertilisers, with two thirds of the market 
H27  35 between them. Other suppliers had small shares and there was little 
H27  36 prospect of new entrants.<p/>
H27  37 <p_>The commission said Kemira's state ownership could worsen the 
H27  38 merger's harmful effects. State ownership might enable Kemira to 
H27  39 withstand downturns in the market better than a private-sector 
H27  40 company and could allow it to keep prices down to enhance its 
H27  41 dominant position.<p/>
H27  42 <p_>The commission said that even if ICI withdrew from the market, 
H27  43 the resulting unemployment and loss of domestic production would 
H27  44 not outweigh the merger's effects on competition.<p/>
H27  45 <p_>Woodchester issued a statement yesterday welcoming Mr Lilley's 
H27  46 decision to approve Cr<*_>e-acute<*/>dit Lyonnais's addition to its 
H27  47 existing 29.8 per cent holding.<p/>
H27  48 <p_>The commission said that the French state could intervene in 
H27  49 Cr<*_>e-acute<*/>dit Lyonnais's business but that in practice it 
H27  50 gave management a high degree of independence.<p/>
H27  51 <p_>Given each company's small share of the UK financial services 
H27  52 market, the commission did not believe that the merger would allow 
H27  53 Cr<*_>e-acute<*/>dit Lyonnais to distort the market.<p/>
H27  54 
H27  55 <h_><p_>ICI may have to withdraw from UK fertilisers<p/>
H27  56 <p_>By Clive Cookson<p/><h/>
H27  57 <p_>ICI, the leading UK chemical company, is contemplating the 
H27  58 complete closure of its domestic fertiliser business, with sales of 
H27  59 pounds450m a year, following the government's decision not to allow 
H27  60 Kemira of Finland to buy it.<p/>
H27  61 <p_>In a statement last night, the company said <quote_>"ICI must 
H27  62 now consider all its options"<quote/> for the fertiliser business, 
H27  63 which has lost a total of about pounds50m over the last five 
H27  64 years.<p/>
H27  65 <p_>The most likely option, according to ICI's evidence to the 
H27  66 Monopolies and Mergers Commission, would be to shut down the 
H27  67 business if the bid were blocked. That would lead to the loss of 
H27  68 540 jobs at ICI's Severnside and Leith fertiliser plants, which 
H27  69 would have been taken over by Kemira, and to an increase of 
H27  70 pounds60m a year in UK fertiliser imports. (ICI's third fertiliser 
H27  71 plant, at Billingham, was not part of the proposed takeover and is 
H27  72 scheduled to close in any case, with the loss of 640 jobs.)<p/>
H27  73 <p_>Norsk Hydro, Europe's largest fertiliser manufacturer, told the 
H27  74 Monopolies Commission that <quote_>"it too had made a bid for ICI's 
H27  75 fertiliser assets and would still be interested if Kemira's 
H27  76 proposal did not go ahead"<quote/>. But Hydro's share of the UK 
H27  77 fertiliser market (19 per cent) is similar to Kemira's (18 per 
H27  78 cent) and it too is a state-controlled company, so the same 
H27  79 objections might apply if ICI agreed to sell the business to the 
H27  80 Norwegian company.<p/>
H27  81 <p_>While ICI considers its options, <quote_>"it will continue to 
H27  82 produce fertilisers at its Billingam, Leith and Severnside sites 
H27  83 ... and to supply these products to farmers,"<quote/> the company 
H27  84 says.<p/>
H27  85 <p_>The short-term commercial outlook for ICI Fertilisers may have 
H27  86 improved with the Gulf crisis because Kuwait, Iraq and some of the 
H27  87 Gulf states are significant exporters of fertilisers. The crisis 
H27  88 has driven up world fertiliser prices without affecting 
H27  89 significantly the cost of raw materials (natural gas and inorganic 
H27  90 materials).<p/>
H27  91 <p_>Senior ICI executives including Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, 
H27  92 were genuinely surprised - and infuriated - by yesterday's 
H27  93 announcement, according to sources in ICI. They say the board will 
H27  94 seriously consider closing the UK fertiliser business.<p/>
H27  95 <p_>The Commission's report says that in January 1990, when the 
H27  96 board considered the various options for ICI Fertilisers and 
H27  97 decided to sell it, <quote_>"continuation of the current mode of 
H27  98 operation was seen as the best fall-back option, if satisfactory 
H27  99 divestment did not prove possible, since the business was forecast 
H27 100 to generate a positive cash flow for a number of years 
H27 101 forward"<quote/>.<p/>

H27 103 <h_><p_>Saatchi urged by big investor to change refinancing 
H27 104 terms<p/>
H27 105 <p_>By Alice Rawsthorn<p/><h/>
H27 106 <p_>SAATCHI & SAATCHI, the troubled advertising group, is under 
H27 107 pressure from one of its largest bondholders to change the terms of 
H27 108 its controversial financial rescue package.<p/>
H27 109 <p_>ESL Partners, a Dallas-based investment company holding 17 per 
H27 110 cent of Saatchi's Euro<?_>-<?/>preference stock, is lobbying the 
H27 111 company, through its advisers SG Warburg in London and Donaldson 
H27 112 Lufkin Jenrette in New York, to renegotiate the package.<p/>
H27 113 <p_>Earlier this week, Warburg met representatives of Lord 
H27 114 Rothschild, whose funds hold 20 per cent of the Europreference 
H27 115 stock. Rothschild is understood to be dissatisfied with the present 
H27 116 terms and may table alternative proposals.<p/>
H27 117 <p_>Given that Saatchi needs to secure the approval of 51 per cent 
H27 118 of all bondholders - and of 67 per cent of those voting - the 
H27 119 combined votes of ESL and Rothschild would be enough to block the 
H27 120 refinancing. This means they are in a strong position to persuade 
H27 121 Saatchi to change the package.<p/>
H27 122 <p_>Mr Edward Lampert, general partner of ESL, said the current 
H27 123 terms of the refinancing were <quote|>"unacceptable" but that he 
H27 124 was convinced it would be possible to produce <quote_>"a better 
H27 125 alternative for the company and its investors"<quote/>.<p/>
H27 126 <p_>ESL is discussing alternatives with Warburg and Donaldson. Mr 
H27 127 Lampert said: <quote_>"Saatchi is a great company. We want to make 
H27 128 sure it not just survives but thrives. Its advisers are creative 
H27 129 and constructive people. I am sure they can come up with a 
H27 130 structure which would be better for the company."<quote/><p/>
H27 131 <p_>The crux of the bondholders' complaints is that under the terms 
H27 132 of the refinancing - in which they swap bonds for a combination of 
H27 133 new ordinary and Europreference shares - they will receive too low 
H27 134 a proportion of the enlarged equity and will forfeit their dividend 
H27 135 income.<p/>
H27 136 <p_>Saatchi and its advisers have argued that, although it would be 
H27 137 technically possible to vary the terms of the refinancing, the 
H27 138 present proposals are the fairest possible package for all classes 
H27 139 of shareholders. Unless Saatchi restructures its finances it will 
H27 140 almost certainly go bankrupt when its current banking facilities 
H27 141 expire in January 1993.<p/>

H27 143 <h_><p_>Profits recovery by Porsche<p/>
H27 144 <p_>By Andrew Fisher <tf_>in Stuttgart<tf/><p/><h/>
H27 145 <p_>PORSCHE, the German luxury sports car manufacturer, continued 
H27 146 to recover in the year ended July, 1990, with a 26 per cent rise in 
H27 147 net profits to DM68.4m ($45m).<p/>
H27 148 <p_>However, it would only commit itself to a forecast of 
H27 149 maintained sales and <quote_>"satisfactory results"<quote/> for the 
H27 150 present 12 months.<p/>
H27 151 <p_>As well as expressing concern about the possible consequences 
H27 152 of the Gulf war, Mr Arno Bohn, the chief executive, said the weak 
H27 153 dollar, now worth around DM1.50, was a considerable burden and 
H27 154 danger for Germany's export-oriented industry.<p/>
H27 155 <p_>Porsche was making more of its purchases on a dollar basis, 
H27 156 mainly of tyres, leather, castings, and plastics.<p/>
H27 157 <p_>He said business was still favourable in Germany, continental 
H27 158 Europe, and Japan. Sales, however, were suffering from economic 
H27 159 weakness in the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia.<p/>
H27 160 <p_>The new luxury car tax in the US was an extra burden for 
H27 161 Porsche.<p/>
H27 162 <p_>Last year's result still leaves Porsche well below the peak 
H27 163 DM120m of 1984-85, before its sales were hit by the 1987 stock 
H27 164 market crash and the weakening dollar.<p/>
H27 165 <p_>But the company has recovered considerably since earnings 
H27 166 slumped in 1987-88 to DM25m after a sharp drop in the previous year 
H27 167 which had prompted Porsche to cut the dividend by DM5 a share.<p/>
H27 168 <p_>Having restored DM1 of the cut last year, it is now adding a 
H27 169 further DM1 to bring the payment on the quoted preference shares up 
H27 170 to DM13 and that on the voting stock - owned by the controlling 
H27 171 Porsche and Pi<*_>e-trema<*/>ch families - up to DM12 for last 
H27 172 year.<p/>
H27 173 <p_>When Porsche ran into difficulties, nearly 70 per cent of its 
H27 174 sales were in the US; last year, the US share was down to 25 per 
H27 175 cent.<p/>
H27 176 <p_>The company, which has upgraded its models and cut production 
H27 177 and costs sharply in recent years, lifted turnover 20.5 per cent to 
H27 178 DM3.05bn.<p/>
H27 179 <p_>Mr Arno Bohn, the chief executive, said that turnover for 
H27 180 1990-91 was expected to be about DM3bn.<p/>
H27 181 <p_>Porsche benefited last year from the strong economy in Germany 
H27 182 and a rise of 45 per cent in export markets outside the US. Sales 
H27 183 in the US fell 15 per cent.<p/>
H27 184 <p_>The company said 70 per cent of its car turnover was achieved 
H27 185 abroad against 76 per cent the previous year.<p_>
H27 186 <p_>In east Germany, 600 Porsches were registered in 1990, around 
H27 187 100 of them new.<p/>
H27 188 <p_>Total production was 32,360 cars, a rise of 7 per cent.<p/>

H27 190 <h_><p_>Prudential sells estate agencies to Woolwich<p/>
H27 191 <p_>By David Barchard<p/><h/>
H27 192 <p_>WOOLWICH, the third-largest UK building society, is to buy 191 
H27 193 estate agency branches from Prudential Property Services. The 
H27 194 purchase will give Woolwich a network of more than 400 branches.<p/>
H27 195 <p_>Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich, said the 
H27 196 society was getting a bargain by buying the Thames and Eastern 
H27 197 regions of Prudential Property Services for pounds20.75m.<p/>
H27 198 <p_>The agencies were placed on the market last November when 
H27 199 Prudential, once the largest estate agency network in the UK, 
H27 200 decided to sell its remaining 500 branches.<p/>
H27 201 <p_>Prudential paid an average of pounds250,000 for each of the 830 
H27 202 branches it purchased at a total cost of more than pounds230m. 
H27 203 However, the chain was hard hit by the downturn in the housing 
H27 204 market after 1988. In 1989, it reported a loss of pounds48.9m.<p/>
H27 205 <p_>Woolwich, which entered the estate agency business only three 
H27 206 years ago, now ranks eighth with a network larger than that of 
H27 207 Abbey National and only slightly smaller than that of Black 
H27 208 Horse.<p/>
H27 209 <p_>The deal implies a cost to Woolwich of about pounds113,000 per 
H27 210 branch, well below the pounds140,000 it takes to start a new one. 
H27 211 Woolwich has written off only pounds19m on goodwill in its purchase 
H27 212 of the entire network, unlike competitors such as Halifax and 
H27 213 Nationwide Anglia which entered the market earlier.<p/>
H27 214 <p_>The purchase reflects Woolwich's policy of increasing its 
H27 215 distribution outlets in the high street. <quote_>"With our building 
H27 216 society branches, we now have 1,000 outlets,"<quote/> Mr Kirkham 
H27 217 said.<p/>
H27 218 <p_>Morgan Grenfell, the City merchant bank, acted as advisers to 
H27 219 Woolwich on the deal. The purchase consists of 260 business units 
H27 220 and includes the lettings, survey, and valuation, operations of 
H27 221 Prudential Property Services, as well as its development, and 
H27 222 planning services in the two regions.<p/>
H27 223 <p_>There is an overlap of only 14 branches between Woolwich's 
H27 224 existing estate agency network and those being bought from 
H27 225 Prudential.<p/>
H27 226 <p_>Mr Richard Groom, Woolwich Property Services managing director, 
H27 227 said his company is considering reviving the original names of some 
H27 228 of the local agencies.<p/>
H27 229 <p_>Prudential's decision to impose a standard corporate branding 
H27 230 and management style on its estate agencies is widely cited as one 
H27 231 of the reasons for the network's poor performance.<p/>

H27 233 <h_><p_>Bardon, Evered to merge in pounds87m deal<p/>
H27 234 <p_>By Andrew Taylor<p/><h/>
H27 235 <p_>EVERED and Bardon Group are to merge, creating one of the UK's 
H27 236 largest quarrying companies. Evered yesterday made an agreed share 
H27 237 offer for Bardon worth pounds87m at last night's closing prices.<p/>
H27 238 <p_>Mr Roy Kettle, Evered's chief executive, said the deal would 
H27 239 make the group the fourth or fifth largest aggregates producer in 
H27 240 the UK, controlling about 6 per cent of market.<p/>

H28   1 <#FLOB:H28\><h_><p_>New order forces the pace of change<p/>
H28   2 <p_>Alan Cane and Louise Kehoe look at the shake-up in the world's 
H28   3 personal computer industry<p/><h/>
H28   4 <p_>The goalposts in the world's $9bn personal computer business 
H28   5 have shifted with a speed which has left the main players shaken 
H28   6 and disorientated.<p/>
H28   7 <p_>A grim certainty is now sinking in that the favourable 
H28   8 conditions of the 1980s, in which the personal computer industry 
H28   9 was born and flourished, will never return. It is forcing the 
H28  10 leading companies to make strategic changes as quickly as corporate 
H28  11 structure and culture will allow. For many, it may not be quick 
H28  12 enough.<p/>
H28  13 <p_>International Business Machines, the world's largest computer 
H28  14 manufacturer and the market leader in personal computers, is 
H28  15 setting the pace. Faced with a sharp decline in market share as Far 
H28  16 Eastern suppliers and others cut into its industry leadership with 
H28  17 high-quality copies of its desk<?_>-<?/>top machines, 'Big Blue' 
H28  18 this week forged a pioneering, 10-year agreement with Intel, a 
H28  19 leading semiconductor company. The deal is to create a complete 
H28  20 microcomputer on a single silicon chip. With this move, IBM is 
H28  21 clearly signalling its intention to own and control tomorrow's 
H28  22 personal computer industry.<p/>
H28  23 <p_>Intel's microprocessors are used in close to 90 per cent to 
H28  24 personal computers. The new single-chip microcomputer will be based 
H28  25 on the most advanced member of this range.<p/>
H28  26 <p_>Increasingly, manufacturing a personal computer involves little 
H28  27 more than assembling microprocessor and memory on printed circuit 
H28  28 boards in a suitable case. Disk drives, keyboards and displays are 
H28  29 bought as standard components. The microprocessor maker, therefore, 
H28  30 not only controls the capabilities of the machine but has the 
H28  31 largest claim on the profits from the system.<p/>
H28  32 <p_>Through its deal with Intel, IBM is tapping into the only 
H28  33 source of real profitability in personal computer hardware and 
H28  34 ensuring that competitors will have to follow its lead - the cost 
H28  35 of designing and manufacturing a competitive microprocessor of the 
H28  36 complexity of the Intel device is likely to prove prohibitive for 
H28  37 all but electronics companies with revenues of about $20bn a 
H28  38 year.<p/>
H28  39 <p_>IBM's latest initiative follows a remarkable bargain struck 
H28  40 earlier this year with its arch rival Apple Computer which could 
H28  41 give it leadership in the fast-growing workstation business, while 
H28  42 helping Apple to a larger share of the corporate pc market.<p/>
H28  43 <p_>Mr Aaron Goldberg, International Data Corporation's pc expert, 
H28  44 sums up the alliance thus: <quote_>"The Apple/IBM agreement is an 
H28  45 excellent example of how the industry's internal power structure 
H28  46 will undergo fundamental change.This elemental change will bankrupt 
H28  47 at least 10 major companies."<quote/><p/>
H28  48 <p_>IBM, however, with total revenues of more than $60bn last year, 
H28  49 is probably the only computer company with financial resources and 
H28  50 marketing muscle successfully to undertake such mould-breaking 
H28  51 initiatives.<p/>
H28  52 <p_>The state of the personal computer business is better 
H28  53 demonstrated by the plight of other large players. Compaq, for 
H28  54 example, the US personal computer company which epitomised meteoric 
H28  55 growth in the 1980s, has been forced to make sweeping changes in 
H28  56 virtually every respect of its business including pricing, 
H28  57 distribution, and customer support. Its plans were made public 
H28  58 yesterday at the end of two weeks in which it reported its first 
H28  59 quarterly loss. It also announced the loss of almost 25 per cent of 
H28  60 its share price, the dismissal of Mr Rod Canion, its founder, 
H28  61 president and chief executive, and the resignation of five other 
H28  62 top executives.<p/>
H28  63 <p_>The reshaping of Compaq involves abandoning many principles on 
H28  64 which the company built its success. It will no longer concentrate 
H28  65 on the top end of the market, representing itself as a quality 
H28  66 alternative to IBM, nor will it sell exclusively through dealers. 
H28  67 Instead it will seek cheaper ways of distributing its products 
H28  68 including mail order, a technique used successfully by companies 
H28  69 such as Dell Computers which compete on price and quality of 
H28  70 support alone.<p/>
H28  71 <p_>That the pc industry is in trouble <}_><-|>in<+|>is<}/> not in 
H28  72 question. Why it should be in such a predicament is another matter. 
H28  73 The problems of the traditional computer industry have been well 
H28  74 rehearsed. Large manufacturers' profitability has been destroyed by 
H28  75 the falling cost of technology leading to increased competition and 
H28  76 moves among customers to systems composed of standard components 
H28  77 from different manufacturers. All this has made the industry's 
H28  78 conventional large, expensive direct sales forces a hopelessly 
H28  79 uneconomic way of distributing small, low-cost computers.<p/>
H28  80 <p_>What has happened to cause today's hiatus? Three things:<p/>
H28  81 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>A sharp fall in growth<p/>
H28  82 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Dramatic price declines<p/>
H28  83 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Customer resistance.<p/>
H28  84 <p_> The personal computer business is now essentially a commodity 
H28  85 business and obeys the commercial rules governing items such as 
H28  86 televisions or video-recorders. Where there are too many suppliers 
H28  87 and too much undifferentiated product, there will inevitably be a 
H28  88 shake-out. So it is proving.<p/>
H28  89 <p_>Sales growth in the industry, which was sustained at an average 
H28  90 annual rate of 20 per cent or so throughout the 1980s, has slowed 
H28  91 abruptly because of the recession in the US, part of Europe and 
H28  92 Australasia. This has masked the fact, however, that the market is 
H28  93 maturing rapidly and in many business sectors is close to 
H28  94 saturation. The replacement market already represents 50 per cent 
H28  95 of business across the board. By 1995 it will represent close to 80 
H28  96 per cent of all pc sales.<p/>
H28  97 <p_>In the US, unit sales are up by perhaps 3 per cent this year 
H28  98 while prices are falling at between 25 and 60 per cent a year. This 
H28  99 pattern is being duplicated in Europe, suggesting the market is 
H28 100 contracting in dollar terms. It is causing chaos in the 
H28 101 distribution channels both in the US and Europe. No dealer can 
H28 102 survive on the discount available from manufacturers. Average gross 
H28 103 profit margins for dealers are coming down from more than 30 per 
H28 104 cent to between 12 per cent and 15 per cent. They either have to 
H28 105 sell in volume or add value through specialised software and 
H28 106 services if they are to survive.<p/>
H28 107 <p_>Prices are being cut savagely, because of the rapidly declining 
H28 108 cost of technology and because of deep discounting to win market 
H28 109 share.<p/>
H28 110 <p_>This week alone, Toshiba of Japan announced price cuts of 30 
H28 111 per cent across its range in the UK; Compaq said it would cut 25 
H28 112 per cent off its notebook computers in the US; while Copam, a 
H28 113 leading Taiwanese maker, said it would sell a top-of-the-line 
H28 114 machine for under pounds2,000. A similar computer from IBM is 
H28 115 listed at more than pounds8,000.<p/>
H28 116 <p_>Of just as much significance is the decline in brand loyalty. 
H28 117 Customers no longer believe they are buying anything extra in 
H28 118 quality or service by purchasing an IBM or Compaq computer raher 
H28 119 than a Copam or Dell. They are buying on price. The move to a 
H28 120 commodity market stocked with generic products which are difficult 
H28 121 to distinguish is virtually complete.<p/>
H28 122 <p_>What are the consequences for personal computer makers of the 
H28 123 new order?<p/>
H28 124 <p_>First, they will have to find ways of taking cost out of the 
H28 125 manufacturing process. Asian manufacturers combining low labour 
H28 126 costs with highly automated assembly have an advantage here, as the 
H28 127 Taiwanese group Copam illustrates.<p/>
H28 128 <p_>Second, they will have to seek economic ways of distributing 
H28 129 products - such as retail chains selling 'own brand' pcs, mail 
H28 130 order like Dell or computer superstores.<p/>
H28 131 <p_>Third, they will have to seek new ways of differentiating their 
H28 132 products from their competitors - through marketing if not 
H28 133 technology.<p/>
H28 134 <p_>Last month's big US personal computer industry show, Comdex, 
H28 135 was marked by an air of desperation as makers attempted to persuade 
H28 136 customers, to little avail, that there were genuine differences 
H28 137 between their products. Performance no longer counts because 
H28 138 everybody is using the same sets of silicon chips.<p/>
H28 139 <p_>There are new technologies in the wings which offer some 
H28 140 possiblity of differentiation - pen-based computers, for example, 
H28 141 or multi-media systems combining video, graphics, sound and 
H28 142 processing in one unit. The speed of technical change is so rapid, 
H28 143 however, that success in any of these technologies is unlikely to 
H28 144 give any one company an advantage for long.<p/>
H28 145 <p_>Industry leaders aim, however, to expand the pc market by 
H28 146 giving the personal computer a much broader appeal. <quote_>"In the 
H28 147 long term there are real growth opportunities in personal 
H28 148 computers,"<quote/> says Mr James Cannavino, head of IBM's personal 
H28 149 computer business. <quote_>"We have only begun to scratch the 
H28 150 surface."<quote/><p/>
H28 151 <p_>Yet to reach a wider audience, he adds: <quote_>"The personal 
H28 152 computer has to compete with the television. We have to make kids 
H28 153 want to turn on the computer rather than picking up the TV remote 
H28 154 control."<quote/><p/>

H28 156 <h_><p_>Fall in consumer spending leaves Whitbread lower<p/>
H28 157 <p_>By Philip Rawstorne<p/><h/>
H28 158 <p_>WHITBREAD, the UK brewer and retailer, yesterday reported its 
H28 159 first fall in profits for 16 years under the impact of the 
H28 160 recession.<p/>
H28 161 <p_>Pre-tax profits for the six months to August 31 fell 7 per cent 
H28 162 from pounds152.8m to pounds142.5m due mainly to the decline, in 
H28 163 real terms, of customer spending. Bad weather and budget tax 
H28 164 increases had added to the difficulties, Mr Peter Jarvis, chief 
H28 165 executive, said.<p/>
H28 166 <p_>Beer volume sales for the industry as a whole were down 7 per 
H28 167 cent - the worst fall for more than 40 years - and the company has 
H28 168 made pounds6m provision against the risk of bad debts among its 
H28 169 pounds180m free trade loans.<p/>
H28 170 <p_>The outlook for such debts appeared to have worsened in recent 
H28 171 weeks and the full year's provision was likely to be greater than 
H28 172 last year's pounds8m, he said.<p/>
H28 173 <p_>Despite the tough trading conditions, Mr Jarvis claimed the 
H28 174 company had shown considerable resilience. It had 
H28 175 out<?_>-<?/>performed the market in managed pubs, restaurants, and 
H28 176 shops.<p/>
H28 177 <p_><quote_>"I am confident that once there is the slightest hint 
H28 178 of sustained economic upturn, we shall return to our pattern of 
H28 179 growth,"<quote/> he said, but he warned that there had been no sign 
H28 180 of recovery in the last two months.<p/>
H28 181 <p_>Turnover for the six months rose by 2.5 per cent to 
H28 182 pounds1.06bn (pounds1.04bn) but trading profit declined 2 per cent 
H28 183 to pounds139m to pounds136m.<p/>
H28 184 <p_>Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 24.68p to 23.32p but 
H28 185 the interim dividend is raised to 4.55p (4.3p).<p/>
H28 186 <p_>The Whitbread beer company lifted turnover to pounds449.4m 
H28 187 (pounds442.8m) but profits, hit by the bad debts charge, were 5 per 
H28 188 cent lower at pounds39.1m, against pounds41.3m.<p/>
H28 189 <p_>Overall volume sales fell by 6 per cent, reflecting the sale of 
H28 190 350 pubs and poorer business in the tenanted and take-home trades; 
H28 191 but volumes in the free trade were more than 6 per cent higher. 
H28 192 Boddingtons bitter sales increased by 40 per cent and Murphy's 
H28 193 stout by 12 per cent.<p/>
H28 194 <p_>Profits from the Pub Partnership leased estate rose from 
H28 195 pounds32.4m to pounds33.7m on turnover pounds15.2m lower at 
H28 196 pounds127.4m.<p/>
H28 197 <p_>The managed retail division increased turnover from 
H28 198 pounds625.9m to pounds665.9m, but profits fell 9 per cent to 
H28 199 pounds61.7m (pounds67.8m).<p/>
H28 200 <p_>Profits were 20 per cent ahead in the Brewer's Fayre and 
H28 201 Beefeater pubs. The acquisition of GrandMet's Berni Inns, now being 
H28 202 absorbed into Beefeater, pushed interest charges up from pounds7m 
H28 203 to pounds17.4m.<p/>
H28 204 <p_>Apart from the budget Travel Inns, where the occupancy rate was 
H28 205 higher than 80 per cent, the hotels division had a difficult period 
H28 206 with profits 35 per cent lower.<p/>
H28 207 <p_>Pizza Hut increased sales and market share but profits fell. 
H28 208 The Threshers off-licence chain improved sales by 3 per cent and 
H28 209 profits by 8 per cent.<p/>
H28 210 <p_>Profits from property disposals increased by pounds4.7m to 
H28 211 pounds17.9m. The company has now sold 500 pubs and another 600 will 
H28 212 be sold in the next six months.<p/>

H28 214 <h_><p_>Stones sign for Virgin<p/><h/>
H28 215 <p_>VIRGIN RECORDS has concluded an agreement with the Rolling 
H28 216 Stones who were previously contracted to Sony Music. The agreement 
H28 217 takes effect in 1993 and is believed to involve payment to the 
H28 218 group of $30m-$40m, writes Michael Skapinker.<p/>
H28 219 <p_>The Rolling Stones have undertaken to produce three new albums 
H28 220 for Virgin. From March 1993 Virgin will also acquire the group's 
H28 221 back catalogue from 1971 onwards.<p/>
H28 222 <p_>Virgin would not disclose details of the agreement but it is 
H28 223 believed the company will retain the rights to the back catalogue 
H28 224 until all advances paid to the Rolling Stones have been 
H28 225 recouped.<p/>
H28 226 <p_>Mr Keith Richards, one of the members of the group, has had a 
H28 227 contract with Virgin as a solo artist since 1988 when the company 
H28 228 released his Talk is Cheap album.

H29   1 <#FLOB:H29\><h_><p_>BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS<p/><h/>
H29   2 <p_>The University stands on a site of about 94 acres (38 
H29   3 hectares), containing both buildings and playing fields, situated 
H29   4 on the northern side of Kingston upon Hull, and easily accessible 
H29   5 from the city centre. Building has followed a master plan prepared 
H29   6 by the Consultant Architect, Sir Leslie Martin. Special facilities 
H29   7 include The Middleton Hall (which seats up to 500 for lectures, 
H29   8 plays and concerts), the Brynmor Jones Library, the Gulbenkian 
H29   9 Audio-Visual Centre and Drama Studio and the Health Centre. The 
H29  10 University Union has its own accommodation in University House, 
H29  11 which also includes the students' refectories and student services 
H29  12 departments, such as the Accommodation, Careers and Counselling 
H29  13 Offices. Staff facilities are available in Staff House. The Union 
H29  14 runs a day nursery in a modern purpose-built building on the edge 
H29  15 of the main site.<p/>
H29  16 <p_>The Halls of Residence, which are mixed-sex, are all within 
H29  17 three miles of the University in the village of Cottingham and 
H29  18 consist of The Lawns complex (Downs, Grant, Lambert, Morgan, 
H29  19 Nicholson and Reckitt) and Cleminson, Ferens, Needler and Thwaite. 
H29  20 The social hub of The Lawns is the Lawns Centre, which provides 
H29  21 catering and other amenities. The other halls in Cottingham are 
H29  22 organised on more traditional lines, and some include facilities 
H29  23 for disabled students.<p/>
H29  24 <p_>The University has pursued a policy of purchasing private 
H29  25 houses and converting them into student houses; there are 1,515 
H29  26 places in student houses, most of which are conveniently near to 
H29  27 the University and within easy reach of the city centre, apart from 
H29  28 a small number in Cottingham.<p/>
H29  29 <p_>There are spacious gardens at the University and at the Halls 
H29  30 of Residence.<p/>
H29  31 <p_>In the University grounds provision is made for rugby, 
H29  32 football, hockey, cricket and tennis. The Boat Club has a boathouse 
H29  33 by the River Hull. The modern Sports Centre containing two large 
H29  34 gymnasia, a sports hall and a number of squash courts provides for 
H29  35 all indoor sports, training activities and dance. A newly created 
H29  36 Fitness Centre, containing saunas, jacuzzi, solaria and weights 
H29  37 areas is due to open in the Autumn of 1991.<p/>
H29  38 <h_><p_>UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS<p/>
H29  39 <p_>GENERAL REGULATIONS<p/><h/>
H29  40 <p_>Regulations for the maintenance of good order and discipline 
H29  41 are promulgated from time to time. It is the duty of all students 
H29  42 to take notice of the Regulations and to know and observe them. 
H29  43 Students on admission must sign a declaration that they will 
H29  44 observe the Ordinances of the University and will conform to all 
H29  45 such regulations as may from time to time be made for the 
H29  46 maintenance of order in the University. Students must also make 
H29  47 themselves conversant with the academic regulations in the 
H29  48 University <tf|>Calendar.<p/>
H29  49 <p_>Regulations relating to Halls of Residence, Student Houses, 
H29  50 Lodgings, Flats, Parking and Traffic, Freedom of Speech, Code of 
H29  51 Discipline and the University Library, have the same force as 
H29  52 University Regulations and any breach of them may be dealt with as 
H29  53 a breach of University discipline.<p/>
H29  54 <h_><p_>GENERAL CONDUCT<p/><h/>
H29  55 <p_>The University expects its students to conduct themselves at 
H29  56 all times in an orderly manner creditable to the good name of the 
H29  57 University. Intentional disruption of any of the University's 
H29  58 activities or functions (including the unauthorised occupation of 
H29  59 University property) is an offence which is subject to University 
H29  60 discipline.<p/>
H29  61 <p_>The conduct of students in lecture rooms and laboratories is 
H29  62 subject to the control and direction of heads of departments and 
H29  63 their authorised agents and misconduct is an offence within the 
H29  64 regulations relating to discipline.<p/>
H29  65 <h_><p_>UNIVERSITY TERMS<p/><h/>
H29  66 <p_>1. The official dates of University terms as published in the 
H29  67 <tf|>Calendar apply to all students. Students must follow 
H29  68 throughout the terms the courses for which they are registered and 
H29  69 attend such classes and such examinations as are required by the 
H29  70 University or by the Dean of the School concerned. No paid work may 
H29  71 be undertaken by a student during term time without the permission 
H29  72 of the Dean of the School, and such work must not conflict with the 
H29  73 student's academic commitments.<p/>
H29  74 <p_>Students (other than new students at the beginning of session 
H29  75 and research students) are required to arrive in Hull not later 
H29  76 than the first day of term and, except with the special permission 
H29  77 of the Dean of the School in which they are registered, may not go 
H29  78 down until the last day. Other than at the beginning of the Spring 
H29  79 and Summer terms the first and last days of term as published are 
H29  80 regarded as travelling days on which no lectures or classes will be 
H29  81 held. In the Spring and Summer terms, teaching will start on the 
H29  82 first Monday of the term. The residence of research students is 
H29  83 governed by the requirements of their Dean of School of Supervisor. 
H29  84 Arrangements for new students at the beginning of session are 
H29  85 notified to them annually.<p/>
H29  86 <h_><p_>Absits and Exeats<p/><h/>
H29  87 <p_><tf_>(a) Permission to go down before the end of Term 
H29  88 (Exeat):<tf/> An exeat will be granted only in special 
H29  89 circumstances. Students must apply to the Dean of the School in 
H29  90 which they are registered, on an official exeat form obtainable 
H29  91 from the receptionist in the Administration Building.<p/>
H29  92 <p_>At the end of the Summer Term final year students may go down 
H29  93 after completing their final <tf|>written examinations, without the 
H29  94 formality of an exeat, <tf_>provided they present themselves for 
H29  95 such oral and other examinations as may be required.<tf/><p/>
H29  96 <p_><tf|>(N.B. Such students should inform themselves of the dates 
H29  97 when their external examiners will be at the University, and before 
H29  98 going down are required to leave particulars of the address at 
H29  99 which they may be contacted, with the secretary of the School.)<p/>
H29 100 <p_><tf_>(b) Temporary Absence during Term (Absit):<tf/> Leave of 
H29 101 absence may be granted during University terms subject to 
H29 102 departmental and other academic requirements. No formal permission 
H29 103 is required for weeks-end leave which does not involve absence from 
H29 104 lectures, classes, or other course commitments, but in all other 
H29 105 cases application must be made to the appropriate Dean of School on 
H29 106 an absit form obtainable from the receptionist in the 
H29 107 Administration Building. Leave for three or more successive nights 
H29 108 will be granted only if it includes a Saturday and Sunday, unless 
H29 109 given on compassionate grounds. Students going on leave are 
H29 110 required to inform either their Supervisor or the receptionist of 
H29 111 the address at which they may be found.<p/>
H29 112 <p_>A student who lives in University or approved accommodation 
H29 113 going on week-end or other leave is required to notify his or her 
H29 114 Warden, Student House Tutor or landlady, of his or her intended 
H29 115 absence and the address at which he or she may be contacted in case 
H29 116 of need.<p/>
H29 117 <h_><p_>REGISTRATION AND PAYMENT OF FEES<p/><h/>
H29 118 <p_>2. Students must register for classes and examinations and pay 
H29 119 any fee prescribed and any other University dues on the dates and 
H29 120 at the times laid down in Official Notices.<p/>
H29 121 <h_><p_>CLASSES AND EXAMINATIONS<p/><h/>
H29 122 <p_>3. Students must follow throughout the terms the courses for 
H29 123 which they are registered and attend such classes and such 
H29 124 examinations as are required by the University or by the Dean of 
H29 125 the School concerned. No student may change his or her course 
H29 126 without the permission of the Deans of the relevant Schools and the 
H29 127 Board of Undergraduate Studies.<p/>
H29 128 <p_>No student may enter for a University examination or an 
H29 129 examination conducted by some other examining body without the 
H29 130 consent of the Dean of his or her School. In the case of external 
H29 131 examination such consent is normally given only if the examination 
H29 132 is for a professional qualification closely related to the 
H29 133 student's course. Consent for entry to examinations is normally 
H29 134 given when a student completes registration at the beginning of 
H29 135 session; unregistered students will not be permitted to sit 
H29 136 examinations without special permission of the Registrar and 
H29 137 Secretary. Students must enter on their registration form 
H29 138 particulars of any external examinations which they propose to take 
H29 139 during the session. University examinations of any kind will in all 
H29 140 cases take priority over any other examinations which a student 
H29 141 wishes to take.<p/>
H29 142 <p_>Students absent from classes owing to illness must report their 
H29 143 absence within the first two days to:<p/>
H29 144 <p_><tf|>(a) The <tf|>appropriate Warden in the case of students 
H29 145 residing in Halls of Residence.<p/>
H29 146 <p_><tf|>(b) The Accommodation Officer in the case of students in 
H29 147 lodgings or private accommodation.<p/>
H29 148 <p_><tf|>(c) The Tutor-in-Charge or the Senior Resident in the case 
H29 149 of students in Student Houses.<p/>
H29 150 <p_><tf|>(d) The Academic Office in the case of all other 
H29 151 students.<p/>
H29 152 <p_>Where an approved course of study in preparation for the award 
H29 153 of a degree requires attendance at practical classes or the 
H29 154 submission of an adequate account of practical work or both, a 
H29 155 candidate must have attended practical classes or have submitted 
H29 156 the written work or both, to the satisfaction of the Dean of the 
H29 157 School concerned, before being allowed to sit the written 
H29 158 examination.<p/>
H29 159 <p_>Students who have been absent due to illness or given temporary 
H29 160 leave of absence must report their return to the University in the 
H29 161 same way as their absence.<p/>
H29 162 <p_>Wardens, the Accommodation Officer, Tutors-in-Charge and Senior 
H29 163 Residents will report the absence and the return of a student to 
H29 164 the Academic Office as soon as possible after the information is 
H29 165 received from the student concerned.<p/>
H29 166 <h|>GOWNS
H29 167 <p_>4. All full-time students reading for a degree or diploma must 
H29 168 wear approved academic dress on ceremonial occasions, at official 
H29 169 interviews with University Officers and members of the academic 
H29 170 staff.<p/>
H29 171 <h|>HEALTH
H29 172 <p_>5. Students, other than those living at home in the district, 
H29 173 are required to bring their National Health Service Medical Cards 
H29 174 to Hull and are advised to register with one of the University 
H29 175 Medical Officers. (Students should note that registering for a 
H29 176 course at the University has nothing to do with registering with 
H29 177 the Health Service, which is an entirely separate procedure.) 
H29 178 Students must inform the Registrar and Secretary, in the manner 
H29 179 prescribed from time to time, of the name of the doctor in Hull or 
H29 180 district with whom they have registered.<p/>
H29 181 <p_>All students are required to send information about their past 
H29 182 and present health on an approved form before their arrival at the 
H29 183 University. All students, prior to arrival at the University, are 
H29 184 provided with a leaflet explaining the facilities available to them 
H29 185 in the University Health Centre. Students will be called for early 
H29 186 examination if the Medical Officer considers it advisable. All 
H29 187 students not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for three 
H29 188 years immediately prior to coming to the University are required to 
H29 189 produce evidence of a satisfactory chest X-ray performed not more 
H29 190 than three months prior to their arrival in Hull. Students unable 
H29 191 to comply with this are required to attend the University Medical 
H29 192 Officer within ten days of registration so that alternative local 
H29 193 arrangements may be made.<p/>
H29 194 <h_><p_>PARKING AND TRAFFIC REGULATIONS<p/><h/>
H29 195 <p_>6.1.0 <tf|>General   Members of the University staff and 
H29 196 registered students may bring vehicles or cycles into the 
H29 197 University grounds and park them there on the conditions specified 
H29 198 in these Regulations. This permission may be withdrawn at any time 
H29 199 and does not imply a guarantee that parking space will be 
H29 200 available.<p/>
H29 201 <p_>2.0 <tf|>Liability   Persons parking vehicles and cycles in the 
H29 202 University grounds do so at their own risk and the University will 
H29 203 not accept responsibility for any loss or damage to them howsoever 
H29 204 caused.<p/>
H29 205 <p_>3.0 <tf|>Applicability   The Traffic and Parking Regulations 
H29 206 apply during both term time and vacations.<p/>
H29 207 <p_>4.0 <tf|>Registration   Persons regularly parking vehicles of 
H29 208 any sort within the University grounds must register such vehicles 
H29 209 with the appropriate member of the Registrar and Secretary's Office 
H29 210 within one week of the beginning of each session. Any newly 
H29 211 acquired vehicles must be registered immediately. When a vehicle is 
H29 212 registered a current parking label will be issued which must be 
H29 213 displayed on the vehicle.<p/>
H29 214 <p_>5.0 <tf|>Traffic<p/>
H29 215 <p_>5.1 Those driving in the University must observe the traffic

H30   1 <#FLOB:H30\><h_><p_>Spongy, morbid and fascinating<p/>
H30   2 <p_>Kate Saunders views the growing process at the Partnership's 
H30   3 Mushroom Farm, Leckford<p/><h/>
H30   4 <p_>It had never occurred to me that people could be passionate 
H30   5 about mushrooms: in my dictionary, a fungus is defined as a 
H30   6 <quote_>"spongy, morbid growth"<quote/>! But having spent a day at 
H30   7 the Leckford Mushroom Farm, I can now understand the appeal of the 
H30   8 tasty fungi.<p/>
H30   9 <p_>In growing rooms <quote_>"as busy as the engine room on the 
H30  10 QEII"<quote/>, according to Mr Michael Ewin, Sales/Administration 
H30  11 Manager, hundreds of thousands of white or chestnut-brown mushrooms 
H30  12 sprout from compost, rapidly increasing in size as they feed on 
H30  13 organic matter.<p/>
H30  14 <p_>In Mr Ewin's office, pictures of button mushrooms (40-60mm in 
H30  15 size), and open and closed cup mushrooms adorn the walls.<p/>
H30  16 <p_><quote_>"Mushroooms are one of the most demanding products of 
H30  17 all,"<quote/> he says. <quote_>"Although anyone can cultivate them, 
H30  18 the critical thing is to grow them to meet the demands of the 
H30  19 market 52 weeks a year. Retailers and wholesalers want quality and 
H30  20 continuity.<p/>
H30  21 <p_>"You also have to be able to cope with the vagaries of the 
H30  22 British consumer - they are unreasonable, and want more mushrooms 
H30  23 on a Saturday, and very few in the early part of the week, for 
H30  24 instance!"<quote/><p/>
H30  25 <p_>Timing has to be perfect. Mushrooms start off in a button 
H30  26 shape, then develop into closed cups. At that point the 'veil', or 
H30  27 mushroom skin around the edge, breaks and they become open cup 
H30  28 mushrooms. Then the fungus turns into a large inverted umbrella 
H30  29 shape. Each stage takes 24 hours, and Leckford growers pick 
H30  30 mushrooms at the level of development required.<p/>
H30  31 <p_>Mr Ewin and Dr Bob Ross, Manager of the Mushroom Farm, have to 
H30  32 be committed to the job. Their products are grown in a controlled 
H30  33 environment, 365 days a year, and they think nothing of popping in 
H30  34 to deal with emergencies or simply to check the mushrooms during 
H30  35 the evenings or even on Christmas Day.<p/>
H30  36 <p_>Engineers, too, live nearby and are always prepared to rush 
H30  37 back to the farm if necessary.<p/>
H30  38 <p_>The sales of mushrooms vary throughout the year, and Waitrose 
H30  39 is a 'major customer'. Demand for mushrooms is much higher in the 
H30  40 winter, as people buy large amounts for stews and casseroles. In 
H30  41 the summer, demand tends to drop slightly.<p/>
H30  42 <p_><quote_>"These days, oyster and shiitake mushrooms are becoming 
H30  43 more popular as additions to summer salads,"<quote/> says Mr Ewin. 
H30  44 <quote_>"I am on the marketing and publicity committee of the 
H30  45 Mushroom Growers' Association, aiming to promote the consumption of 
H30  46 mushrooms within the UK. We produce videos, fact sheets and recipe 
H30  47 leaflets.<p/>
H30  48 <p_>"In these diet-conscious times, people are responding to the 
H30  49 fact that mushrooms are about 90 per cent vegetable protein, high 
H30  50 in amino-acids and low in calories and sugar."<quote/><p/>
H30  51 <p_>Dr Ross and Mr Ewin guided me round the fungoid-smelling 
H30  52 growing rooms to demonstrate the cultivation process.<p/>
H30  53 <p_>The compost used for the mushrooms is processed for up to four 
H30  54 weeks at a local farm before arriving at Leckford. It is then fed 
H30  55 out of the lorries on to a large yellow 'filling machine' which 
H30  56 places a continuous slab of compost on to a tough fabric netting 
H30  57 surface on cables. Mushroom spawn is then planted in the compost 
H30  58 with special applicators. This spawn is made by specialised 
H30  59 producers in lab conditions, and when stuck on to grain, looks as 
H30  60 if the grain fragment is mouldy.<p/>
H30  61 <p_>The net, now loaded with compost and spawn, is winched into the 
H30  62 growing rooms, which are closed up. The temperature is set at about 
H30  63 25C, with high humidity and no fresh air.<p/>
H30  64 <p_>Dr Ross explains: <quote_>"The mycelium, or fungi spore, then 
H30  65 grows through the compost as a white mould. It looks just like 
H30  66 cotton wool. The mould is the fungus that we want - it's the 
H30  67 beginnings of the mushroom.<p/>
H30  68 <p_>"There is an eight-day growth period, and then we put 
H30  69 neutralised peat on top of the compost and mycelium. The grower's 
H30  70 skill comes in deciding whether the fungus is at the right stage of 
H30  71 growth. At this point, we drop the temperature to about 5C, lower 
H30  72 the humidity and introduce fresh air. This dramatic change triggers 
H30  73 off the growth of the fungus and mushrooms begin to 
H30  74 form."<quote/><p/>
H30  75 <h_><p_>Growing stage<p/><h/>
H30  76 <p_>The largest, and cheapest, raw material used in the operation 
H30  77 is water. During the growing stage, mushrooms can be discoloured by 
H30  78 water, but once a 'flush', or batch of mushrooms, is picked, the 
H30  79 peat is watered heavily over about three days.<p/>
H30  80 <p_>The growers' first sight before a flush appears is a tiny white 
H30  81 pinhead, which develops into a larger, dome-shaped head.<p/>
H30  82 <p_>The Leckford farm is not merely a highly efficient mushroom 
H30  83 production unit; research is inextricably bound up with the whole 
H30  84 process, and three smaller growing rooms enable Dr Ross and his 
H30  85 team to experiment with different conditions which could increase 
H30  86 the yield of both ordinary and exotic types of mushrooms without 
H30  87 endangering the crop. A lab is also used to determine the ideal 
H30  88 degree of moistness in compost.<p/>
H30  89 <p_>Dr Ross says: <quote_>"It's said in the industry that once 
H30  90 you're hooked on mushrooms you're never free of them - and I think 
H30  91 that's probably true. I wrote my thesis on the subject of producing 
H30  92 compost for mushrooms 15 years ago, and it is still a much debated 
H30  93 subject today. Compost is such a complex mixture of organic 
H30  94 materials, and its make-up can affect your yield of mushrooms 
H30  95 dramatically."<quote/><p/>
H30  96 <p_>Dr Ross, who has worked at the Mushroom Farm since it opened, 
H30  97 adds: <quote_>"Over the years, mushroom yields have been going up 
H30  98 and up as techniques for growing improve. In the mid-Sixties, a 
H30  99 pound and a half of mushrooms per square foot was considered to be 
H30 100 an excellent yield. Now we consider four and a half pounds in the 
H30 101 same area to be disastrous."<quote/><p/>
H30 102 <p_>Dr Ross will continue his search for the perfect flush. But the 
H30 103 rest of us may well be more tempted to try a tasty new type of 
H30 104 mushroom, freshly plucked from a Waitrose shelf.<p/>
H30 105 <h_><p_>But which type of mushroom, madam?<p/>
H30 106 <p_>Kate Saunders looks at the characteristics of different 
H30 107 varieties stocked by Waitrose<p/><h/>
H30 108 <p_>The biggest-selling mushrooms in Waitrose branches are the 
H30 109 plain, closed-cup type, while open and flat mushrooms are gradually 
H30 110 becoming more popular.<p/>
H30 111 <p_>The more exotic varieties such as oyster, which resemble the 
H30 112 shape of an oyster shell; shiitake, or 'forest mushroom', which 
H30 113 grow on certain types of dead or dying trees in the wild; and 
H30 114 chestnut mushrooms, known for their meaty, strong flavour, are 
H30 115 slower to catch on with customers.<p/>
H30 116 <p_>Mr Alan Wilson, Assistant Central Buyer, fruit and vegetables, 
H30 117 says: <quote_>"We've introduced a distinctive yellow oyster which 
H30 118 is milder in taste than an ordinary mushroom and has a soft and 
H30 119 silky texture. The shiitake variety have quite a strong, almost 
H30 120 musky, taste. We produced a leaflet on mushrooms about two years 
H30 121 ago for our customers which included recipes and information about 
H30 122 the different types. Although people are becoming more educated 
H30 123 about exotic vegetables and Continental cuisine, they still prefer 
H30 124 the more traditional mushrooms."<quote/><p/>
H30 125 <p_>Research by the Mushroom Growers' Association indicates that 
H30 126 <foreign_>agaricus bisporus<foreign/>, the white cap mushroom 
H30 127 including button, closed cup, open cup and open flat, accounts for 
H30 128 about 98.6 per cent of sales.<p/>
H30 129 <p_>Mushrooms are good for you; the shiitake variety were described 
H30 130 as the 'elixir of life' by early orientals. Mushrooms contain more 
H30 131 protein than most other vegetables, and are low in calories with 
H30 132 only traces of sugar. They are also reputed to have diverse medical 
H30 133 benefits such as the relief of gout symptoms. In common with other 
H30 134 vegetables, their full nutritional value is obtained when they are 
H30 135 eaten raw or lightly cooked.<p/>
H30 136 <p_>Shiitake mushrooms are said to be delicious shallow fried or 
H30 137 baked in a little butter or oil and lemon juice to preserve the 
H30 138 aroma and natural juices. They cost more than ordinary mushrooms 
H30 139 because a crop of shiitake is much smaller than a crop of other 
H30 140 types of the fungus.<p/>
H30 141 <p_>Oyster mushrooms are particularly popular in traditional 
H30 142 Chinese and Indian cuisine. They often grow so closely together 
H30 143 that they overlap like tiles on a roof.<p/>
H30 144 <p_>Cultivated oyster mushrooms can be fried, steamed, grilled, 
H30 145 baked or deep-fried, and have a distinctive flavour. They also 
H30 146 taste good raw with fresh herbs, yogurt and cream.<p/>
H30 147 <p_>According to the Mushroom Growers' Association, mushrooms are 
H30 148 the most valuable horticultural crop grown in the UK. About 9 
H30 149 million households bought mushrooms in the 12 weeks ending 
H30 150 mid-September 1990, and about 1.4 per cent of mushrooms sold are 
H30 151 exotic varieties.<p/>
H30 152 <h_><p_>Wild and exotic<p/><h/>
H30 153 <p_>Wild and exotic breeds of the fungi are popular overseas. In 
H30 154 Poland, pickers make a living supplying wild fungi to markets. In 
H30 155 Italy and France, mushroom-seekers wander through the woods in 
H30 156 search of romantically named species including porcini, 
H30 157 chanterelles, shaggy inkcaps, puffballs, honey fungus, hedgehog 
H30 158 fungus and horns of plenty.<p/>
H30 159 <p_>The difficulty in cultivating wild species often lies in their 
H30 160 symbiotic relationship with the natural surroundings.<p/>
H30 161 <p_>In exchange for sugar from the plant, the fungus passes on 
H30 162 minerals and nutrients it has extracted from the soil. This means 
H30 163 that the fungus cannot live without the plant. Truffles, for 
H30 164 instance, are inextricably bound up with the roots of oak trees. 
H30 165 The French have devised a system of planting oaks in suitable 
H30 166 places and inoculating their roots with the crop in order to get 
H30 167 round this problem.<p/>
H30 168 <p_>Different types of mushrooms grow in different ways. While 
H30 169 common mushrooms are induced to 'fruit' by being embedded in moist 
H30 170 peat and chalk, with the humidity and carbon-dioxide concentration 
H30 171 increased, oyster mushrooms fruit when the temperature is suddenly 
H30 172 dropped and the light turned up.<p/>
H30 173 <p_>According to an article in <tf_>The Economist<tf/>, selective 
H30 174 breeding of mushrooms is almost impossible because different 
H30 175 strains cannot be crossed. One scientist is trying to overcome this 
H30 176 by injecting genes directly into the mushrooms - although this is 
H30 177 made difficult by their habit of keeping several nuclei in every 
H30 178 cell.<p/>
H30 179 <h_><p_>If you go down to the woods ...<p/>
H30 180 <p_>Kate Saunders talks to Mr Stanley Carter, retired Director of 
H30 181 Trading, Food, and mushroom expert<p/><h/>
H30 182 <p_>A group of villagers knocked on the door, proudly bearing a 
H30 183 large basket full of mushrooms.<p/>
H30 184 <p_><quote_>"We're just on our way back from the woods, and we 
H30 185 found these,"<quote/> one of them said. <quote_>"Perhaps you'd like 
H30 186 to have a few."<quote/><p/>
H30 187 <p_>Mr Stanley Carter, retired Director of Trading, Food, and 
H30 188 mushroom expert, glanced at the fungi and told his fellow villagers 
H30 189 that they'd better come in.<p/>
H30 190 <p_>A quick look in a reference book confirmed his suspicions. He 
H30 191 says: <quote_>"They'd brought enough of that particular species of 
H30 192 mushroom to poison the whole village. I told them that if they ate 
H30 193 all those they'd probably die!"<quote/><p/>
H30 194 <p_>These days, mushroom-pickers in the same village of Hemingford 
H30 195 Abbots in Cambridgeshire always bring their finds to Mr Carter and 
H30 196 his wife Galina for identification before eating.<p/>
H30 197 <p_>Mrs Carter says: <quote_>"There is a French saying that you 
H30 198 should only accept a mushroom or an identification of a mushroom 
H30 199 from someone you can trust absolutely!"<quote/><p/>
H30 200 <p_>The couple first became interested in mushrooms when two 
H30 201 Russian friends pointed out a beautiful wild mauve mushroom on a 
H30 202 country walk, and suggested that they cooked it. They subsequently 
H30 203 became members of the thriving British Mycological Society.<p/>
H30 204 <p_>Although Mrs Carter says her interest in the fungi is purely 
H30 205 gastronomical, Mr Carter - who first joined the Partnership when he 
H30 206 was 16 - loves to wander through the woods near their home looking 
H30 207 under fallen trees and undergrowth for unusual specimens.<p/>
H30 208 <p_>He is such an expert that he has even had one mushroom named 
H30 209 after him. It is called <foreign_>Physarum bitanicatum Carter et 
H30 210 Nann-Brem<foreign/> (N E Nannenga-Bremekamp being a Dutch colleague 
H30 211 who helped with the discovery).<p/>
H30 212 <p_>Mr Carter recalls: <quote_>"I was climbing a mountain in the 
H30 213 Alps looking for areas where I thought unusual mushrooms might be 
H30 214 found, when I discovered this specimen. I brought it home, studied 
H30 215 it and analysed it. The discovery was verified and published. So 
H30 216 far no one else has found another."<quote/><p/>
H30 217 <p_>Rows of neatly labelled small boxes full of mushroom spores and 
H30 218 hefty tomes on fungi line Mr Carter's study. He also receives 
H30 219 correspondence about mushrooms from all over the world and is 
H30 220 communicating with the Professor of Mycology at Hong Kong 
H30 221 University about one species.<p/>
