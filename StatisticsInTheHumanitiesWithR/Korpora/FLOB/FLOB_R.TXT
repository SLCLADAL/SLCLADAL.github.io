R01   2 <p_>VANNER WAS STAYING OUT LATE to avoid the sexual demands of his 
R01   3 wife. His appetites in that direction had been quashed by the 
R01   4 tension-filled twelve-hour day, the 100-mile there-and-back 
R01   5 journey, the lack of sleep and the skimped meals. Felling drained 
R01   6 as usual, he looked at the pint of lager in front of him that 
R01   7 promised a rare moment of peace in a day that had frazzled his 
R01   8 nerves.<p/>
R01   9 <p_>Toby Beauchamp was staying out late because he always did. He 
R01  10 had only been to bed completely sober once in ten years, and what a 
R01  11 long night that had been. He hated going home early. It shut down 
R01  12 the day and seemed such a waste. How many evenings did he have 
R01  13 left?<p/>
R01  14 <p_>Toby was fifty-five but seemed younger. With his good looks, 
R01  15 his silver hair and white moustache he looked like a man you 
R01  16 vaguely remembered from an early British film comedy. In the bar of 
R01  17 the Fox he was a regular fixture because he lived alone, worked for 
R01  18 himself and did as he pleased.<p/>
R01  19 <p_><quote_>"How did you escape?"<quote/> he asked.<p/>
R01  20 <p_><quote_>"I abseiled out of the bathroom window,"<quote/> Vanner 
R01  21 told him. Vanner was thirty but his plump figure and tired face 
R01  22 made him look older than his years. For most of the time he 
R01  23 operated on the edge of exhaustion and his face was haggard. Toby 
R01  24 always imagined that if Vanner could only arrange enough sleep for 
R01  25 one month his face would probably look quite different.<p/>
R01  26 <p_><quote_>"She's probably put an electronic tagging device on 
R01  27 your ankle. Tell her that a man with a half-million-pound mortgage 
R01  28 deserves a drink in the pub,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
R01  29 <p_><quote_>"I was joking, pal,"<quote/> said Vanner. <quote_>"I'm 
R01  30 still on my way home from work."<quote/> He picked up his drink and 
R01  31 wondered if Suzanne would be asleep. It would depend on how much 
R01  32 wine she had managed to consume during the day. One night, after a 
R01  33 frenetic day in the money market, he had been to see some 
R01  34 pornographic films in the hope that their explicit sexuality would 
R01  35 kick-start his crumbling libido, but they were so lurid that he'd 
R01  36 felt queasy and it was several days before he could think about 
R01  37 women's bodies again.<p/>
R01  38 <p_>The pub in which the two men sat had oak beams and brass 
R01  39 horseshoes and, tonight, a roaring log fire that created the cosy 
R01  40 atmosphere that pubs were supposed to have; it was hardly 
R01  41 surprising that almost everybody in the village was to be 
R01  42 discovered in here at one time or another.<p/>
R01  43 <p_>The landlord, a plump and harassed man named Barry, looked as 
R01  44 if he had spent too much time enjoying his own product, but he had 
R01  45 managed to fit other pleasures into his life too. His fourth wife, 
R01  46 Sylvia, even plumper but less harassed, was herself on her third 
R01  47 surname. From her previous marriage she had brought her two 
R01  48 children to add to Barry's four and now they had more of their own. 
R01  49 This protracted ordeal in motherhood could not entirely eradicate a 
R01  50 flirtatious streak in her nature which was revealed 
R01  51 indiscriminately to any male customer who loitered in her 
R01  52 company.<p/>
R01  53 <p_>It was directed now at a new arrival in the bar, a heavily 
R01  54 built, somewhat untidy man with a boyish face which suggested that 
R01  55 his forty years had been lived at a much slower pace than Paul 
R01  56 Vanner's thirty.<p/>
R01  57 <p_><quote_>"Hallo, Harry,"<quote/> she said. Her upper lip 
R01  58 twitched in what she imagined was a sensuous manner, but to Harry 
R01  59 Grant it looked as if she was hyping herself up before 
R01  60 disembowelling a live snake.<p/>
R01  61 <p_><quote_>"I'll have a bitter,"<quote/> he said. Harry Grant 
R01  62 seldom flirted himself these days, having painfully gathered the 
R01  63 impression over the years that behind every voluptuous woman was a 
R01  64 homicidal maniac claiming to be her husband. <quote_>"Toby? Paul? 
R01  65 Drink?"<quote/><p/>
R01  66 <p_>The two other men at the bar produced empty glasses in a matter 
R01  67 of seconds.<p/>
R01  68 <p_><quote_>"What's the news, Harry?"<quote/> asked Toby Beauchamp. 
R01  69 <quote_>"Are they going to build a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant 
R01  70 on the green?"<quote/><p/>
R01  71 <p_><quote_>"Nothing so exciting, I'm afraid."<quote/> As he was 
R01  72 the district reporter for the county newspaper people expected 
R01  73 Harry Grant to come into the pub to tell them what was going on, 
R01  74 when he had actually come in to find out. <quote_>"The bus service 
R01  75 is going to be cut is the only news I have, but it won't affect you 
R01  76 rich men in your big cars."<quote/><p/>
R01  77 <p_>Harry Grant was always conscious of the wealth that surrounded 
R01  78 him in this village. In the last decade of the twentieth century, 
R01  79 making money had become the most popular activity even among those 
R01  80 people who had no trace of materialism in their characters. Ten 
R01  81 years of Thatcherism, it seemed to him, had killed the public's 
R01  82 interest in leisure and pleasure and focused its attention on the 
R01  83 accumulation of wealth to such an extent that merely to have made 
R01  84 money sent people to bed happy, even after a day in which they 
R01  85 hadn't actually enjoyed themselves. And the most remarkable thing 
R01  86 about this obsession with wealth was that it didn't seem to make 
R01  87 any difference to anyone's life. Harry couldn't tell in the pub 
R01  88 which man earned pounds40,000 a year and which earned 
R01  89 pounds140,000: both had comfortable homes, smart cars, foreign 
R01  90 holidays; both seemed to spend most of their waking hours at work. 
R01  91 Once you made more money than you spent it didn't seem to Harry 
R01  92 Grant to matter what you earned.<p/>
R01  93 <p_><quote_>"Money is no consolation,"<quote/> said Paul Vanner, 
R01  94 <quote_>"if you've got the sex drive of a wether."<quote/><p/>
R01  95 <p_><quote_>"You've bought the Manor House and you've got a 
R01  96 Ferrari. You can't have everything,"<quote/> said Toby 
R01  97 Beauchamp.<p/>
R01  98 <p_><quote_>"If you city slickers had a sex life as well it 
R01  99 wouldn't be fair on the rest of us,"<quote/> said Harry Grant 
R01 100 holding up his beer. <quote_>"I don't think this has matured in oak 
R01 101 vats under the sage eye of the cellar-master."<quote/><p/>
R01 102 <p_><quote_>"I should hope not,"<quote/> Sylvia told him. 
R01 103 <quote_>"It's best bitter."<quote/><p/>
R01 104 <p_><quote_>"Well, pour it back in the horse and give me a lager. 
R01 105 At one time the ale was safer to drink round here than the 
R01 106 water."<quote/><p/>
R01 107 <p_><quote_>"It still is,"<quote/> said Toby. <quote_>"Have you 
R01 108 seen what comes out of your tap these days?"<quote/><p/>
R01 109 <p_>Harry Grant took his new pint of lager and gave Sylvia a 
R01 110 nervous smile. Like many overweight women she dressed in black 
R01 111 which he felt gave her a menacing air.<p/>
R01 112 <p_>He was relieved to hear that it wasn't all gasps of success in 
R01 113 Vanner's bedroom. The wheels seemed to have come off his sex life, 
R01 114 too, and he was sustained by a series of carnal fantasies, the 
R01 115 latest of which had him addressing a roomful of grateful nuns while 
R01 116 standing naked before them on a chair.<p/>
R01 117 <p_>He said: <quote_>"Being a reporter round here is a bit like 
R01 118 being a swimming instructor in the Negev Desert. Why don't any of 
R01 119 you ever do anything newsworthy? Where are the antique auction 
R01 120 rings and the witches' covens? Where's the arson and the 
R01 121 rape?"<quote/><p/>
R01 122 <p_><quote_>"We're deficient in the pillage department 
R01 123 too,"<quote/> said Toby Beauchamp. <quote_>"And quite right. Peace 
R01 124 and quiet is what we want. It's part of the pleasure of living in 
R01 125 Sin."<quote/><p/>
R01 126 <p_>Compton Sinbury- its name abbreviated to Sin by many of the 
R01 127 residents who derived a childish pleasure from telling others where 
R01 128 they lived- lay at the foot of sloping fields where chalk met 
R01 129 sandstone, and was built round an oblong village green. At the top 
R01 130 of the green was the church and at the bottom, facing it across the 
R01 131 grass, was the public house, the Fox. That had been renamed too. A 
R01 132 poor painting of the eponymous beast on a new inn sign had prompted 
R01 133 the customers to refer to it as the Flatulent Ferret. Behind the 
R01 134 public house was a river which meandered across north Hampshire 
R01 135 and, at the corner of the green, passed beneath a medieval 
R01 136 five-arch bridge which carried the people of Compton Sinbury to 
R01 137 both the railway station and a new motorway.<p/>
R01 138 <p_>The green itself with the bridge in the background was a 
R01 139 much-photographed scene of English country life and had adorned 
R01 140 many a magazine cover. The pictures were usually taken when the 
R01 141 cricket team were entertaining visitors on the green; many of the 
R01 142 photographers who arrived to capture this portrait of rural clam 
R01 143 stood far enough back to get the duck pond covered with water 
R01 144 lilies, at the top of the green, into the foreground of their 
R01 145 picture. The ducks had their own tiny house with a roof that 
R01 146 somebody in the distant past had thatched, and the photographers 
R01 147 liked to include that too.<p/>
R01 148 <p_>Compton Sinbury was so old that Iron-Age farmers had built 
R01 149 their huts here centuries before the birth of Christ. In medieval 
R01 150 times they had made glass in the village, using local sand and 
R01 151 wood. Even within living memory the people who didn't work on the 
R01 152 farms were likely to be farriers, wheel-wrights, cobblers, saddlers 
R01 153 or thatchers. But the last thirty years had seen more change then 
R01 154 the previous three hundred. The thud of the hammer in the smithy 
R01 155 had been silenced. The village forge had been replaced by a garage 
R01 156 and petrol station. The muddy rutted streets were now immaculate 
R01 157 Tarmac, and there were Mercedes in double garages where once there 
R01 158 were broughams in barns. The Meadow Estate, an upmarket quadrangle 
R01 159 of modern detached houses, had replaced one of the farms, but 
R01 160 another, Mr Garrity's, still survived on the edge of the village 
R01 161 with a mixture of grazing, cereal and potatoes- the proportions 
R01 162 endlessly juggled to cope with changes in the quotas for milk and 
R01 163 cereals.<p/>
R01 164 <p_>As fewer people could earn a living from the land, the village, 
R01 165 which had once been the home of pioneer peasant farmers, milkmaids 
R01 166 and yokels, was now merely a pleasant place to live and its 
R01 167 popularity affected its prices. The businessmen, lawyers, money 
R01 168 brokers and estate agents had moved in, attracted by the peace and 
R01 169 quiet as much as by whitewashed, timber-framed walls and thatched 
R01 170 roofs. They disappeared in their large cars in the morning and 
R01 171 returned, mysteriously enriched in the evening to drink gins in the 
R01 172 Flatulent Ferret. Their presence, or the presence of their wives, 
R01 173 enlivened the village. The list of activities which appeared from 
R01 174 time to time on the notice-board outside the village hall which 
R01 175 stood next to the church at the top of the green would have kept a 
R01 176 much larger community busy: amateur dramatic society, 
R01 177 flower-arranging circle, women's institute, judo classes, ladies' 
R01 178 tap class, rambling club, art society, writers' circle, chess club, 
R01 179 handbell ringers, young wives group- all these and more helped to 
R01 180 keep boredom at bay.<p/>
R01 181 <p_>In some ways it was a maverick community. When other villagers 
R01 182 in this peaceful part of the world had risen to fight the plans for 
R01 183 a motorway that would cut across southern England missing Compton 
R01 184 Sinbury by no more than a mile, the residents, mostly attuned to 
R01 185 mobility, kept a judicious silence, realizing that London would 
R01 186 soon be less than an hour away in the Porsche. When a small 
R01 187 airfield was mooted for the fields beyond Garrity's farm the 
R01 188 expected outrage never occurred. It was seen not as a noisy 
R01 189 intrusion on the peace of the countryside but as a useful and 
R01 190 easily affordable amenity that might benefit any one of them.<p/>
R01 191 <p_>It was through accepting, even welcoming, change that the 
R01 192 village had survived and prospered. Strangers still arrived with 
R01 193 the hope of separating the residents from some of their money, but 
R01 194 they were no longer itinerant tinkers, knife-grinders and 
R01 195 hurdle-makers; today they were charity collectors or 
R01 196 representatives of firms who built swimming pools. Nobody sat down 
R01 197 on an evening meal of horsebeans and turnips, and no family now had 
R01 198 a pig in the back garden. The original occupants would be amazed to 
R01 199 see that had happened to their dowdy, oil-lit homes. Tastefully 
R01 200 converted, whitewashed and freshly thatched, the cottages, with 
R01 201 roses round the door and luxury bathrooms, now cost exactly a 
R01 202 hundred times more than their first owners had earned in a lifetime 
R01 203 of exploitation. Compton Sinbury prospered today because the 
R01 204 residents prospered.

R02   2 <p_>The House<p/><h/>
R02   3 <p_>It wasn't far from where he lived, just a stop further on the 
R02   4 tube, but he'd not been to the area before. Nor, from the look of 
R02   5 it, had the developers. No wonder it's cheap, he thought.<p/>
R02   6 <p_>The first thing he saw when he came out of the station was an 
R02   7 antiquated sign on a lamppost saying, <quote_>"Stand for 6 licensed 
R02   8 hackney cabs"<quote/>. No cabs, of course, hackney or otherwise. 
R02   9 Just a tired row of shops opposite and a seedy-looking pub on the 
R02  10 corner and a disused laundry with boarded-up windows and a For 
R02  11 Sale notice. It felt closer to Dickens's London than to 
R02  12 Preston's.<p/>
R02  13 <p_>But perhaps that was the fog.<p/>
R02  14 <p_>Not quite the fog of Dickens, or even his own childhood. They'd 
R02  15 cleaned it up since then and taken the soot out. The poisons it 
R02  16 contained were less visible now. But it was still a proper fog, a 
R02  17 city fog, with a whiff of brimstone in it, a hint of the old 
R02  18 buildings and hung in the doorways and fled in ragged wisps from 
R02  19 the car headlights.<p/>
R02  20 <p_>He turned right out of the station, according to William's 
R02  21 instructions, and then right again, and saw the viaduct.<p/>
R02  22 <p_><tf_>Come and look at the place<tf/>, William had said, 
R02  23 <tf_>it's like everyone's dream of a Victorian childhood<tf/>.<p/>
R02  24 <p_>And here it was, the nightmare.<p/>
R02  25 <p_>It spanned the road ahead, the brickwork streaked with dark 
R02  26 tears and three black holes in the middle, one for the traffic and 
R02  27 two smaller ones on each side for pedestrians, and they looked to 
R02  28 Preston like mouths, or nostrils breathing fog.<p/>
R02  29 <p_>It was the monster of his infancy, lying in wait for him all 
R02  30 these years, or a warning sign, saying, Go Back, make your excuses 
R02  31 and leave, exert your free will...<p/>
R02  32 <p_>But he was older now and in another city, and besides, the 
R02  33 wench was dead.<p/>
R02  34 <p_>So he shook off the ghosts and walked on, his footsteps muffled 
R02  35 by the fog, shivering from a chill that wasn't just in the air, 
R02  36 until the nearest mouth engulfed him.<p/>
R02  37 <p_>It was a real Fanny-by-gaslight relic of the old city, 
R02  38 redolent of gin and vomit and brutal crimes, and the fog had crept 
R02  39 in like an old friend and made a dripping urinal of the walls. Only 
R02  40 the graffiti was on the present, but even that had its roots in 
R02  41 ancient hatreds. Troops Out of Ireland. Keep Britain White. Bring 
R02  42 Back Hanging...<p/>
R02  43 <p_><tf_>They should never have abolished it, hanging's too good 
R02  44 for him. A life sentence. He'll be out in ten years...<p/>
R02  45 <p_>Committed to an asylum for the criminally insane...<tf/><p/>
R02  46 <p_>For a moment he thought he saw a figure at the far end, 
R02  47 waiting, but that was from the nightmare, too, just a trick of the 
R02  48 light and the fog.<p/>
R02  49 <p_>There was a significant improvement on the other side of the 
R02  50 viaduct, a Victorian class divide that had survived the years, and 
R02  51 within two blocks he was walking down a tree-lined avenue 
R02  52 composed of tall, detached houses set back from the road behind 
R02  53 fair-sized gardens. He could see from the number of bells beside 
R02  54 each door that they'd nearly all been turned into flats now, or 
R02  55 dentists' surgeries, and some were in urgent need of renovation, 
R02  56 but they still retained some of their former grandeur, or was it 
R02  57 pretension? The make-believe pomp and affected circumstance of 
R02  58 the people for whom they'd been built, the doctors and lawyers and 
R02  59 merchants and administrators of Empire who all, in one way or 
R02  60 another, made their money out of trade but built houses like 
R02  61 miniature castles, or palaces, to reassure themselves that they 
R02  62 were closer to the Barons than to the Peasants, and safe from 
R02  63 both.<p/>
R02  64 <p_>Preston was fascinated by them. As a very young child he had 
R02  65 learned to read from picture books that showed children living in 
R02  66 houses like these, in nurseries with sloping ceilings and toy 
R02  67 yachts and teddy bears on the floor and solid Papas and gentle 
R02  68 Mamas and a view through the window of rooftops and spires, and if 
R02  69 there was a cloud across the moon it was in the shape of a sailing 
R02  70 ship. As an adolescent and well into his twenties he had affected 
R02  71 to despise the whole fairy tale - the people, the properties, the 
R02  72 false virtues, the false security it represented. But now he was of 
R02  73 an age and living in an era whose insecurities craved the 
R02  74 reassurance of nursery images, the illusory solidity of Victorian 
R02  75 values which, if they had never existed, could always be invented. 
R02  76 He was confused by a barrage of conflicting ideologies. The sneer 
R02  77 had turned into a lump in his throat. The contempt into envy.<p/>
R02  78 <p_>The house that William had found was down one of the side 
R02  79 streets and not so majestic, but it still had a fair bit of the 
R02  80 Gothic about it, and the brass knocker on the front door had the 
R02  81 face of an ogre.<p/>
R02  82 <p_>Preston lifted it and knocked.<p/>
R02  83 <p_>Kate answered the door but he heard William's voice, shouting 
R02  84 down the stairs.<p/>
R02  85 <p_><quote_>"Is that Preston? Come in, shut the door on the 
R02  86 fog."<quote/><p/>
R02  87 <p_>It evoked some distant memory but he couldn't quite pin it 
R02  88 down.<p/>
R02  89 <p_>He stepped into the hall.<p/>
R02  90 <p_><quote_>"Bloody hell,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"Take some 
R02  91 heating, this."<quote/><p/>
R02  92 <p_>He stamped his feet on the tiled floor. Original by the look of 
R02  93 it, and so were the banisters, but someone had painted them a kind 
R02  94 of snot green.<p/>
R02  95 <p_><quote_>"What do you think of it?"<quote/> William bounced down 
R02  96 the stairs, a grinning schoolboy again, and he could hear other 
R02  97 voices somewhere in the upper reaches.<p/>
R02  98 <p_><quote_>"He hasn't seen it yet,"<quote/> complained Kate. 
R02  99 <quote_>"Give him a chance."<quote/><p/>
R02 100 <p_><quote_>"He's seen the outside. Wait until you see the 
R02 101 fireplaces."<quote/><p/>
R02 102 <p_>Preston couldn't remember when he'd last seen him so 
R02 103 enthusiastic about anything.<p/>
R02 104 <p_><quote_>"Wait until you see the soot,"<quote/> said a sardonic 
R02 105 but unseen voice, and then a woman emerged from one of the 
R02 106 downstairs rooms off the hallway.<p/>
R02 107 <p_>Preston stopped stamping his feet.<p/>
R02 108 <p_>She was stunning. She had tawny blonde hair down to her 
R02 109 shoulders and a rather thin face with high cheekbones and a wide 
R02 110 mouth. She wore a leather coat and boots and his first thought was 
R02 111 that she looked Slavonic, a Russian or a Pole. His second was that 
R02 112 she was from the estate agent's. His third that he was in love.<p/>
R02 113 <p_>But he was mistaken. She wasn't Russian or Polish, she wasn't 
R02 114 from the estate agent's, and if he was in love, it was the worst 
R02 115 mistake of all.<p/>
R02 116 <p_><quote_>"This is Tess,"<quote/> said William. <quote_>"Louis' 
R02 117 upstairs with the kids."<quote/><p/>
R02 118 <p_>Her handshake was cool and firm and her eyes were grey.<p/>
R02 119 <p_>But Preston had stopped looking.<p/>
R02 120 <p_><quote_>"They're bloody choosing the rooms already,"<quote/> 
R02 121 said another voice, deep and loud, and from somewhere above ceiling 
R02 122 level, and Preston looked up and saw the man who must be Louis, 
R02 123 hanging over the banisters on the landing.<p/>
R02 124 <p_>Was this the ogre? Preston's glance took in the broad 
R02 125 shoulders, a black beard a lean, dark face and a big nose.<p/>
R02 126 <p_><quote_>"Bit premature, isn't it?"<quote/> said Tess.<p/>
R02 127 <p_>And there was a small, uncomfortable silence, or so Preston 
R02 128 imagined, and a chill in the air, but that could have been real.<p/>
R02 129 <p_><quote_>"Preston, Louis,"<quote/> said William, and he was half 
R02 130 bent at the waist, like a supplicant monk, rubbing his hands and 
R02 131 smiling, nervously. He is nervous, Preston thought, he wants us to 
R02 132 like each other.<p/>
R02 133 <p_>Louis came bounding down the stairs. He was as tall as William 
R02 134 and half as wide again, and he exuded a genial, gregarious energy. 
R02 135 He looked at closer quarters, less of an ogre, more like a 
R02 136 Victorian explorer, but was this an improvement? And yet Preston 
R02 137 <tf|>did like him, instinctively, and without his usual reserve. 
R02 138 More than that, he wanted Louis to like <tf|>him, but he didn't 
R02 139 know why.<p/>
R02 140 <p_><quote_>"Come and look at the fireplaces,"<quote/> said 
R02 141 William, and they filed dutifully into the room Tess had just come 
R02 142 out of. Preston looked at the fireplace. A steel grate like a suit 
R02 143 of armour, a long time unsquired, and what looked like a tile and 
R02 144 marble surround, it was difficult to tell, the snot-green artist 
R02 145 had been busy here, too.<p/>
R02 146 <p_><quote_>"We'd be able to have coal fires,"<quote/> said 
R02 147 Kate.<p/>
R02 148 <p_><quote_>"They only allow smokeless fuel these days,"<quote/> 
R02 149 said Preston.<p/>
R02 150 <p_>He knew what he was doing but was incapable of stopping it. It 
R02 151 was the same thing that made him physically shrink into his scarf 
R02 152 and his leather jacket. He felt he was being drawn out of his 
R02 153 comfortless hole into something altogether more vast and impressive 
R02 154 and alarming.<p/>
R02 155 <p_><quote|>"Well?" said William, when they'd seen it all and 
R02 156 adjourned to the pub opposite the station, an old witing room of a 
R02 157 pub that had not yet been converted into a wine bar or a theme park 
R02 158 and was consequently empty. The three children were at a separate 
R02 159 table, grudgingly tolerated by the landlord.<p/>
R02 160 <p_><quote_>"Well it's... big,"<quote/> said Tess.<p/>
R02 161 <p_><quote|>"Big?"<quote/> thundered Louis. <quote_>"Is that all 
R02 162 you can say? It's fantastic."<quote/><p/>
R02 163 <p_><quote_>"Fourteen rooms, three bathrooms, a hundred-foot 
R02 164 south-facing garden..."<quote/> William intoned.<p/>
R02 165 <p_><quote_>"You sound like an estate agent,"<quote/> said Tess.<p/>
R02 166 <p_>William looked stricken. Tess relented.<p/>
R02 167 <p_><quote_>"Sorry, but it's a bit... overwhelming, really. The 
R02 168 work we'd have to do."<quote/><p/>
R02 169 <p_><quote_>"That's why it's so cheap,"<quote/> said Louis. 
R02 170 <quote_>"My God, woman, you were the one who said we needed more 
R02 171 space."<quote/><p/>
R02 172 <p_><quote_>"I said we needed a playroom for the kids and a bit 
R02 173 more garden - not a damn great manse at the arse-end of the 
R02 174 Northern line with its own private wilderness..."<quote/><p/>
R02 175 <p_><quote_>"Where's your sense of adventure?"<quote/><p/>
R02 176 <p_><quote_>"I exhausted it on you, darling."<quote/><p/>
R02 177 <p_>Preston kept his head down and his nose in the beer.<p/>
R02 178 <p_><quote_>"So, I take it we look elsewhere,"<quote/> said Kate, 
R02 179 flatly. She sounded disappointed.<p/>
R02 180 <p_><quote_>"Is it the house - or the whole idea?"<quote/> William 
R02 181 demanded. He looked so crestfallen Preston felt sorry for him. He 
R02 182 wished he could say something encouraging, but he didn't <tf|>feel 
R02 183 encouraged. He was on Tess's side.<p/>
R02 184 <p_>She sat crumbling a beer mat between her fingers. She looked 
R02 185 more out of place in the shabby pub than any of them.<p/>
R02 186 <p_><quote_>"I really like it,"<quote/> said Kate plaintively. 
R02 187 <quote_>"I think we could do an awful lot with it. And think of the 
R02 188 advantages of sharing. Sharing the shopping, 
R02 189 babysitting..."<quote/><p/>
R02 190 <p_><quote|>"Decorating?" said Tess. <quote_>"Mending the 
R02 191 roof?"<quote/><p/>
R02 192 <p_><quote_>"We'd get builders to do that."<quote/><p/>
R02 193 <p_><quote_>"Oh God, you mean we'd have to live with builders as 
R02 194 well?"<quote/><p/>
R02 195 <p_><quote_>"There's nothing wrong with the roof,"<quote/> said 
R02 196 William. <quote_>"Not as far as I know..."<quote/><p/>
R02 197 <p_><quote_>"Anyway, I think we should be more positive,"<quote/> 
R02 198 said Kate. <quote_>"We have to <tf|>make it work."<quote/><p/>
R02 199 <p_><quote_>"Maybe it's just the fog,"<quote/> said Preston. 
R02 200 <quote_>"And seeing it at night..."<quote/><p/>
R02 201 <p_>But no one was listening.<p/>
R02 202 <p_><quote_>"She's just a bloody pessimist,"<quote/> said Louis. 
R02 203 <quote_>"Always looks on the dark side. I think it's great. I think 
R02 204 the house is great, I think the idea's great. My God, we're all 
R02 205 victims in this fucking city. They're all out to screw us. 
R02 206 Plumbers, builders, estate agents, the government, the council, 
R02 207 bloody thieves... We've got to fight back. Otherwise we're just 
R02 208 prey."<quote/><p/>
R02 209 <p_>Preston stared at him in astonishment. Anyone less like prey he 
R02 210 couldn't imagine. He looked as if he'd make a Rottweiler pause for 
R02 211 thought.<p/>
R02 212 <p_><quote|>"Consumers," said Kate, with a shrug, <quote_>"that's 
R02 213 what we are. And they use the whole sham of our so-called 
R02 214 individualism to make it easier to manipulate us. Buy what they 
R02 215 want us to buy, live the way they want us to live. We have to learn 
R02 216 how to live collectively again. I know it's not exactly fashionable 
R02 217 at the moment, but it's the only hope we've got."<quote/><p/>
R02 218 <p_><quote|>"Exactly," said Louis. <quote_>"Collective security. 
R02 219 Fuck the bastards. Especially burglars."<quote/><p/>
R02 220 <p_>He banged the table with his fist and the glasses jumped and 
R02 221 the drink spilled. The landlord glared.<p/>
R02 222 <p_>Preston wondered where the burglars came into it. His face must 
R02 223 have registered his confusion.<p/>
R02 224 <p_><quote_>"We had a break-in last year,"<quote/> said Tess. 
R02 225 <quote_>"That's what this is all about really."<quote/><p/>
R02 226 <p_><quote|>"Bollocks!"<p/>
R02 227 <p_>Tess was undaunted.<p/>
R02 228 <p_><quote_>"The house is full of weapons,"<quote/> she complained.

R03   1 <#FLOB:R03\><h|>Culture
R03   2 <p_>The Irish are keen preservers and promoters of their Celtic 
R03   3 heritage, much of which is recorded (and illustrated) in the famous 
R03   4 (and illuminated) Book of Kelts at Dublin.<p/>
R03   5 <h_><p_>Irish Poetry<p/><h/>
R03   6 <p_>The Irish have a tendency to wax poetical. Foremost among Irish 
R03   7 poets is W.G. Yeats (brother of the more famous Jack Keats). 
R03   8 William Butler Keats (pron. Yates), having a premonition that he 
R03   9 might be killed if he joined the Irish Airforce, very sensibly 
R03  10 became a poet instead. He invented the Limerick and wrote a series 
R03  11 of celebrated odes to Autumn, A Grecian Urn, A Night in Galway, 
R03  12 etc.<p/>
R03  13 <h_><p_>English Playwrights<p/><h/>
R03  14 <p_>All English playwrights since the time of Shakespeare (or 
R03  15 Bacon) have in fact been Irish (see esp. Sheridan, Oscar Wilde, 
R03  16 G.B. Shaw, Samuel <*_>a-grave<*/> Becket).<p/>
R03  17 <p_>Their plays are easily recognisable - if not easily 
R03  18 distinguishable - on account of the distinct traces of Irish Wit.

R03  80 <h_><p_>Great Britain<p/><h/>
R03  81 <p_>IN 1992 Britain is going to 'Enter Europe'. The question has to 
R03  82 be asked: Are we ready? Britain, by an accident of geography, is 
R03  83 not very Continental. Its people are by tradition insular - a 
R03  84 maritime breed (or Boat Race), unversed in the ways of our European 
R03  85 neighbours (driving on the right, not eating a proper breakfast, 
R03  86 etc.). Nevertheless, there are perhaps signs that the gap is 
R03  87 getting narrower.<p/>
R03  88 <h_><p_>Physical Characteristics<p/><h/>
R03  89 <p_>It has to be admitted that Britain possesses less geography 
R03  90 than many other European countries. There are no geysers, no 
R03  91 fjords, no great mountain ranges (with the possible exception of 
R03  92 the Crampons in Scotland) and no truly memorable waterfalls. There 
R03  93 just isn't enough room.<p/>
R03  94 <p_>Instead we have 'The English Countryside', a green and pleasant 
R03  95 belt which surrounds the various dark satanic mills (now closed), 
R03  96 suburban developments, new towns, international airports, and Asda 
R03  97 superstores that take up most of the available space.<p/>
R03  98 <h|>Economy
R03  99 <p_>The British Economy still has many sterling qualities (just), 
R03 100 although the currency was decimated in the 1970s to bring it into 
R03 101 line with European custom.<p/>
R03 102 <h|>Industry
R03 103 <p_>Happily, very little is known about British Industry. The 
R03 104 Conservative Government's recent policy of privation means that 
R03 105 most of the old National Industries (British Steal, the Lost 
R03 106 Office, Telecon, etc.) have been derationalised, and are now 
R03 107 carried on privately.<p/>
R03 108 <h|>Agriculture
R03 109 <p_>It is also a time of change for British farming. Agriculture is 
R03 110 becoming more and more an extension of Big Business.<p/>
R03 111 <p_>British farmers now have less and less time for their 
R03 112 traditional rural pursuits - fox hunting, hare splitting, wool 
R03 113 gathering, and grousing about the weather. Instead they have to 
R03 114 devote their energies to trading livestocks and shares, carrying 
R03 115 filofaxes (esp. the Diary Farmers), fleecing the VAT man, and 
R03 116 cultivating EC subsidies. Some farming does, of course, remain 
R03 117 orrible, but with the emphasis on high-yield crops such as rape, 
R03 118 oats, groats, and pop festivals.<p/>
R03 119 <h|>Politics
R03 120 <p_>British politics are quite as confused as those in the rest of 
R03 121 Europe. Indeed, many European countries have based their own 
R03 122 Parliamentary systems on the British model.<p/>
R03 123 <p_>All British political institutions are divided very neatly (and 
R03 124 sweetly) into <tf|>two parts. This is called the bi-caramel system 
R03 125 of government. It is undoubtedly a good thing as it provides 
R03 126 everyone with cheques, balances, photo-opportunities, caramels, 
R03 127 etc. Also it prevents anything very much from being done.<p/>
R03 128 <h_><p_>The Bi-Caramel System Explained<p/><h/>
R03 129 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> The are <tf|>two Houses in Parliament - the 
R03 130 Lords and the Commons.<p/>
R03 131 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> There are <tf|>two main parties in each House - 
R03 132 conservative and Labour.<p/>
R03 133 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> There are two types of Labour MP - the moderate 
R03 134 and the petulant.<p/>
R03 135 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> There are <tf|>two types of Conservative MP - 
R03 136 the wet(-fish) and the dry(-sherry, please).<p/>
R03 137 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>There are no <tf|>two people who can remember the 
R03 138 name of the Liberal Demagogic Social Party Party (est. membership: 
R03 139 <tf|>two).<p/>
R03 140 <p_>Recently we have had over a decade of Conservative rule (for 
R03 141 full details see <tf_>Our Island's Tory<tf/>). And during this time 
R03 142 Britain has been presided over by the all-too-memorable Mrs 
R03 143 Thatcher (Mrs T., the Iron Tea Lady, the Mother of Parliaments, 
R03 144 etc.) who, as Prime Minister, lived (increasingly out of her depth) 
R03 145 at Number Ten Drowning Street.<p/>
R03 146 <h_><p_>The Royal Family<p/><h/>
R03 147 <p_>Britain's Royal Family is, at present, thoroughly German in 
R03 148 origin and thus indisputably European<p/>
R03 149 <h_><p_>Wales (W. Cwmbyah-my-lord)<p/><h/>
R03 150 <p_>Although fervently Welsh, Wales is also proud of its links with 
R03 151 the other Celtic (i.e. Welsh) peoples in Europe - the Bretons, 
R03 152 Basques, Magyars, Irish, Lapps, etc.<p/>
R03 153 <p_>Often representatives from these kindred peoples are invited to 
R03 154 the great Welsh cultural festivals - or Festiniogs - there to sing 
R03 155 and dance, eat rabbits (covered in melted cheese) and harp on about 
R03 156 the joys of being Welsh.<p/>
R03 157 <h_><p_>Scotland (and, by extension, Northern Ireland)<p/><h/>
R03 158 <p_>Scotland (previously Caledonia stern and wild) is a very rugged 
R03 159 and romantic country, named after the very rugged and romantic Sir 
R03 160 Walter Scot (explorer, bird-painter, and author of the Waverley 
R03 161 novels).<p/>
R03 162 <p_>Scotland has always enjoyed close links with Europe, especially 
R03 163 France (see 'The Auld Appliance' or 'French Connection'). This was 
R03 164 partly for romantic reasons (Mary Queen of Scots was briefly 
R03 165 married to a French Dolphin) and partly to annoy the English.<p/>
R03 166 <h|>Culture
R03 167 <p_>British culture, it must be admitted, has often shown a sorry 
R03 168 tendency to be insular and un-European. Cricket, Carry On Films, 
R03 169 warm beer, afternoon tea, Marmite, the <tf|>Sun, mint sauce, 
R03 170 Gilbert and Sullivan, Jennings and Darbishire, Morecambe and Wise, 
R03 171 Mrs Thatcher; none of these popular British institutions has 
R03 172 succeeded across the channel.<p/>
R03 173 <p_>There are, of course, exceptions. Football, football 
R03 174 hooliganism, Les Rolling Stones, and the comedy specials of Benny 
R03 175 Hill can all claim to have had a profound impact on the Continent. 
R03 176 But such instances are rare.<p/>
R03 177 <p_>The tide of influence has more often run in the other 
R03 178 direction. This is due to Classical Education, the Renaissance, the 
R03 179 Grand Tour, Cook's Tours, Foreign Wars, Foreign Films, native 
R03 180 indolence.<p/>
R03 181 <h_><p_>The English Poets<p/><h/>
R03 182 <p_>England is rightly proud of its poets: Shakespeare (or The Swan 
R03 183 of Bacon), Milton, Wordsridge and Coleworth, Lard George Byron 
R03 184 ('Mad, fat and murderous to know'), Persse Bicy Shelly, Gerard 
R03 185 Mandy Hopkins, the Brownings (Elizabeth, Barrett and Robert), 
R03 186 Alfred Lawn Tennyson, Sir John Bitumen. The list is impressive.<p/>
R03 187 <p_>Although many of the above exhibited a decidedly English 
R03 188 sensibility (i.e. played tennys, wandered lonely as a cloud, lost 
R03 189 things - Paradise, Love's Labour, etc.), often they drew their 
R03 190 subject matter from Renaissance Europe (i.e. Italy) or the 
R03 191 Classical World (i.e. Italy or, perhaps, Greece).<p/>
R03 192 <p_>Many English poets even went so far as to live abroad (i.e. 
R03 193 Italy or, at a pinch, Greece). Some even died there. Elizabeth and 
R03 194 Barrett Browning are buried in Florence (It. <tf|>Ferrara) together 
R03 195 with their pet woolf, Flush. While Shelly, increasingly under the 
R03 196 influence of drink, opprobrium, Byron, etc., drowned his sorrows in 
R03 197 the nearby Gulf of La Speranza. Byron himself died in Greece, 
R03 198 complaining that he felt, <quote_>"hot, shot and dangerously 
R03 199 low"<quote/>.<p/>
R03 200 <h_><p_>Other High Points of British Culture<p/><h/>
R03 201 <p_><tf_>The Plays of Shakespeare<tf/> (aka Francis Bacon, 
R03 202 Christopher Marlowe or what you Will): these very memorable dramas 
R03 203 (tragical, comical, hysterical and pasteurised) contain many famous 
R03 204 parts, including <tf_>Henry IV Part II, Henry VI Parts I to 
R03 205 III<tf/>, 'Parting is such sweet sorrow', <tf_>Henry IV Part 
R03 206 I<tf/>, etc.<p/>
R03 207 <p_><tf_>The Novels of Charles Dickens<tf/>: Dickens was noted for 
R03 208 his vivid descriptions of Dickensian (and hence Victorian) London, 
R03 209 with its smogs, fogs, fugs, Twists, turns, curiously old shops, 
R03 210 etc. His books are all very well written (i.e. in a Copperfield 
R03 211 hand).<p/>
R03 212 <p_><tf_>The Landscapes of Constable<tf/>: John Constable (or P.C. 
R03 213 Turner) was a retired policeman who painted many scenes of a 
R03 214 decidedly rural nature, including <tf_>The Haystack, A View of 
R03 215 Salisbury Cathedral<tf/>, and <tf_>The Mill on the Floss<tf/>.<p/>
R03 216 <p_><tf_>The Buildings of Sir Christopher Wren<tf/>: although best 
R03 217 remembered for designing St. Paul's Cathedral, Wren also founded 
R03 218 the Women's Naval Service. He used to be commemorated on the 
R03 219 farthing, but has since been promoted to the pounds50 note.<p/>
R03 220 <p_><tf_>The Hits of The Beatles<tf/>: The Beatles, with their 
R03 221 so-called 'Mercybeat', rescued post-war Britain from being terribly 
R03 222 dull. Instead they invented 'The Swinging Sixties', even though 
R03 223 they themselves weren't sixty at all, but only teenagers.<p/>
R03 224 <h_><p_>Britain and Abroad<p/><h/>
R03 225 <p_>Over the years Britain has had considerable experience of 
R03 226 dealing with Abroad. This, of course, was especially true during 
R03 227 the Golden Age of the British Empire, when most of the map was 
R03 228 coloured red and the midday sun never set, and the white men 
R03 229 (together with their mad dogs) would carry enormous burdens in the 
R03 230 appalling heat.<p/>
R03 231 <p_>Most of the memorable countries in the British Empire were not, 
R03 232 however, in Europe. New Zealand (NZ), Australia (OZ), the Cook 
R03 233 Islands (where they cooked the unfortunate Captain Cook), the 
R03 234 Gilbert-and-Sullivan Islands, the Easter Islands, the Christmas 
R03 235 Islands, the August Bank Holiday Islands; these were (and, indeed, 
R03 236 are) all in the Antipodes.<p/>
R03 237 <p_>Canada is in North America. India is, of course, in India. 
R03 238 Rhodesia - discovered so providentially by Cecil Rhodes 
R03 239 (<tf|>n<*_>e-acute<*/> Cecil Zimbabwe) - is in Africa. All, alas, 
R03 240 are far beyond the scope of this book.<p/>
R03 241 <p_>Britain, however, does even now retain some decidedly European 
R03 242 possessions:<p/>
R03 243 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Gilbraltar: a small and very British rock on the 
R03 244 southern tip of Spain, garrisoned by British bobbies and Spanish 
R03 245 monkeys.<p/>
R03 246 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Tuscany: a small and very British enclave in 
R03 247 central Italy, garrisoned with British writers and Italian 
R03 248 hill<?_>-<?/>farmers.<p/>

R04   2 <p_>KENNETH ROBINSON offers some useful Anglo-Nippon party 
R04   3 tips<p/><h/>
R04   4 <p_>It is said that the Japanese, who are bringing us a festival 
R04   5 during the next few weeks - including wrestling at the Albert Hall 
R04   6 and robots at the Science Museum - feel closer to Britain at the 
R04   7 moment than to any other country.<p/>
R04   8 <p_>They are not pleased by America's plan to commemorate Pearl 
R04   9 Harbor with an explicit postage stamp showing sinking ships. Nor by 
R04  10 the French prime minister's remarks about <quote_>"little yellow 
R04  11 men who sit up all night thinking of ways to screw the Americans 
R04  12 and the Europeans."<quote/><p/>
R04  13 <p_>Maybe they are warming to us because their bookshops are 
R04  14 currently selling translations of our Debrett's <tf_>Etiquette and 
R04  15 Modern Manners<tf/>. Though the editor of this entertaining work, 
R04  16 Elsie Burch Donald, tells me she had no idea the Japanese had got 
R04  17 hold of it without paying her. And she cannot think what their 
R04  18 tourists will make of our good taste bible if they arrive here 
R04  19 clutching it.<p/>
R04  20 <p_>After dipping into the original English version I suspect that 
R04  21 the Japanese could find our rules for gracious living pretty 
R04  22 aggressive compared with their own life-style of courteous 
R04  23 bowing, enigmatic smiles and shoes left facing backwards on the 
R04  24 door-mat.<p/>
R04  25 <p_>They will discover, for instance, that a well-mannered 
R04  26 English hostess sits at dinner with enough old newspapers under the 
R04  27 table <quote_>"to deal with any broken glass or possibly an 
R04  28 accident with a plate."<quote/><p/>
R04  29 <p_>Debrett, you see, can make the simplest meal seem like a 
R04  30 violent night out. It tells hostesses to keep a footman handy with 
R04  31 a jug of water for any guests choking over her food. And it urges 
R04  32 caution in the serving of cocaine, marijuana or heroin in case it 
R04  33 puts anyone <quote_>"in a difficult position."<quote/><p/>
R04  34 <p_>Like under the table no doubt. If one of those Japanese 
R04  35 visitors found himself in this position he would discover that a 
R04  36 Debrett hostess always <quote_>"delegates a trusted friend to look 
R04  37 after the drunks."<quote/> He could also learn from Debrett that a 
R04  38 man who 'fancies' a guest must never use this vulgar word but must 
R04  39 say to her, instead, <quote_>"Let's get it together"<quote/>. And 
R04  40 on the way home he must be careful, he is told, <quote_>"not to 
R04  41 berate a bus-driver, or to sing, whistle or argue in the 
R04  42 street."<quote/><p/>
R04  43 <p_>If this Debrett guide opens the eyes of Britons who didn't know 
R04  44 it existed, they can now have them opened even more - in Tokyo. It 
R04  45 is here that surgeons are currently employed to create expressions 
R04  46 of greater honesty on businessmen.<p/>
R04  47 <p_>This is reported in a guide to <tf_>Japanese Living<tf/>, 
R04  48 published by Nippon Books to show the British what to expect from 
R04  49 their countrymen. It seems, for instance, that although the 
R04  50 Japanese go bright red when given alcohol, they will leave the 
R04  51 house promptly after drinking green tea. And any hostess would be 
R04  52 happy with a Japanese guest's way of saying <quote_>"Yes, 
R04  53 yes"<quote/> all the evening, meaning that he doesn't agree but 
R04  54 won't argue, and changing the subject frequently so as not to 
R04  55 linger on anything that might give offence. Even when he says to 
R04  56 the hostess <quote_>"You must come to my house,"<quote/> he doesn't 
R04  57 mean anything of the kind. He is just saying that he quite likes 
R04  58 her.<p/>
R04  59 <p_>But however much a Japanese may like a hostess his own guide 
R04  60 book tells him not to ask the size of her bosom, as he would do at 
R04  61 home, or to call her <quote|>"oi" affectionately - meaning 
R04  62 <quote_>"here you"<quote/> - as he would his wife. And, however 
R04  63 great the temptation, he must try not to hold her hand  
R04  64 absent-mindedly long after shaking it.<p/>
R04  65 <p_>Not that he would really want to chat up the typical English 
R04  66 hostess. She is the sort of woman, says his Debrett translation, 
R04  67 who was brought up not to use a loo until the chain had stopped 
R04  68 swinging. At tea-time her sandwiches have never oozed and her 
R04  69 cakes have never crumbled. On Sundays she has always gone to church 
R04  70 in a striking hat and long gloves, smelling ever-so-slightly of 
R04  71 camphor. And when she invites a man home for a late-night cup of 
R04  72 coffee this will <quote_>"not necessarily"<quote/> mean she wants 
R04  73 him so stay for breakfast as well.<p/>
R04  74 <p_>Anyone planning an Anglo-Nippon party during the Japanese 
R04  75 festival could have a lot of fun by handing round these etiquette 
R04  76 books for the two nations. But I feel a little sad for our 
R04  77 illustrious ex-prime minister when I see snide comments about her 
R04  78 by Debrett. It seems that Mrs Thatcher's vowel sounds are 
R04  79 considered just as unspeakably non-U as references to bloater 
R04  80 paste, sandwich spread and individual fruit pies.<p/>
R04  81 <p_>Such things, according to Debrett, should never be mentioned in 
R04  82 polite company. Nor should a true gentleman use phrases like 
R04  83 <quote_>"Suit yourself, I'm sure"<quote/>, <quote_>"That's your 
R04  84 lot, matey"<quote/> or <quote_>"Drop dead"<quote/>.<p/>
R04  85 <p_>I was thinking how useful Debrett could be to the Japanese if 
R04  86 they really sought our help with refined speech when I found, in 
R04  87 their own guide to modern etiquette, how the women are supposed to 
R04  88 deal with male harassment. They are taught to use one very 
R04  89 effective oriental expression.<p/>
R04  90 <p_><quote_>"Knock it off, buster!"<quote/><p/>
R04  91 <p_>And that, I am afraid to <}_><-|> stay <+|>say<}/>, is the 
R04  92 only advice I can offer to you as we tackle the slow merging of 
R04  93 British and Japanese cultures. But let me just warn you that the 
R04  94 Japanese have an ambiguous new word for coffee. In future Debrett's 
R04  95 perfect woman may well be startled by an innocuous late-night 
R04  96 Nippon invitation.<p/>

R04  99 <p_>Are you the type the club doorman shuns? Does the DJ never play 
R04 100 your request? Fear no more. Here's ANNE NIGHTINGALE's guide to 
R04 101 Getting In and Getting Down<p/><h/>
R04 102 <p_>The two done-up-to-nines bimbettes had teetered their way 
R04 103 along the beach to the entrance of The Zap Club, Brighton. It was a 
R04 104 stormy, hot summer night and inside 300 people were thrashing about 
R04 105 to the relentless beat of hard core techno house dance music. (It's 
R04 106 that whoomph whoomph whoomph noise you hear coming from the open 
R04 107 windows of a boy racer's Escort XR3i.)<p/>
R04 108 <p_>The two bimbettes were keen on getting in on all this. But they 
R04 109 were experiencing difficulties in persuading the doorman to let 
R04 110 them in.<p/>
R04 111 <p_>Recently I have taken on the role of Friday night DJ in Arch 
R04 112 One, the alternative, ambient 'Chill-out' room of The Zap 
R04 113 Club.<p/>
R04 114 <p_><tf|>chill-out? Well, I suppose you sweat slightly less to 
R04 115 music that is only running at 101 beats per minute, than you do to 
R04 116 the 182 or so bpm of hard techno which kicks the night away in Arch 
R04 117 Two. The Zap Club 'happens in these arches under the seafront at 
R04 118 Brighton where once seafarin' folk smoked pipes and spun yarns at 
R04 119 angling and sailing clubs. The Zap changed all that, along with The 
R04 120 Ha<*_>c-cedille<*/> in Manchester, The Milk Bar at al in London, 
R04 121 which are the core of Clubland. And they perpetuate the rituals 
R04 122 which go with it. The first of which is: The Art Of Getting In. The 
R04 123 bimbettes were clearly not very experienced in this matter and did 
R04 124 not realise that an Elitist Door Policy was in force. This sinister 
R04 125 euphemism means you don't get in if a) you're wearing a suit, b) 
R04 126 you've got 'bad attitude', c) you're an armed drug dealer with 
R04 127 accompanying Rottweiler, or d) you're simply not cool dead hip 
R04 128 enough.<p/>
R04 129 <p_>I had come to the door of the club to do some serious 
R04 130 chilling-out and wipe the sweat from my brow after slaving over the 
R04 131 Technics 1200 record decks for three hours.<p/>
R04 132 <p_><quote_>"How come they're letting you in?"<quote/> one of the 
R04 133 bimbettes demanded of me.<p/>
R04 134 <p_><quote_>"Just came out for a breath of air,"<quote/> I replied 
R04 135 in a dead cool way.<p/>
R04 136 <p_><quote_>"Oh right,"<quote/> said Bimbette Two. <quote_>"We'll 
R04 137 try that."<quote/> She turned to the doorman. <quote_>"Erm, we just 
R04 138 popped out for some fresh air. Can we come back in?"<quote/><p/>
R04 139 <p_>The doorman retained his impenetrable expression set in granite 
R04 140 but moved his head almost imperceptibly sideways. Bimbette Two 
R04 141 turned again on me.<p/>
R04 142 <p_><quote_>"So why you and not us?"<quote/><p/>
R04 143 <p_><quote_>"Well I work here,"<quote/> I replied.<p/>
R04 144 <p_><quote_>"Wot, bar work?"<quote/> asked Bimbette Two.<p/>
R04 145 <p_><quote_>No, I DJ"<quote/> (it's a newish verb) I said in a 
R04 146 chilled-out manner.<p/>
R04 147 <p_><quote|>"Oh" said the Bimbettes, defeated.<p/>
R04 148 <p_>It's a cruel unfair world in Clubland. You can queue for hours 
R04 149 and they won't let you in. You can say, <quote_>"but it's cost me 
R04 150 37 quid on the train from Birmingham,"<quote/> and they still won't 
R04 151 necessarily let you in. If, however, you say <quote_>"I'm on the 
R04 152 guest list"<quote/> and you <tf|>are on the guest list, you'll be 
R04 153 whisked in, in the time it takes to say <quote_>"extended  
R04 154 re-mix"<quote/>.<p/>
R04 155 <p_>Being got onto the guest list involves a fair amount of 
R04 156 industry, including phone calls, general hustling, grovelling, 
R04 157 pulling strokes or sheer bluff. Saying: <quote_>"I'm a friend of 
R04 158 Boy George,"<quote/> can be effective. Possibly.<p/>
R04 159 <p_>Alternatively, being a Face will get you in. Being a Face means 
R04 160 you are someone who gets regular mentions in the gossip columns of 
R04 161 <tf|>NME and <tf_>Melody Maker<tf/>, there's been a feature about 
R04 162 you in <tf|>i-D magazine and you're in a group that has a 
R04 163 single-syllable name. Viz, Cud, Moose, Top, Ride, Curve, Lush, Bliss, 
R04 164 Bleach or Blur. Blah hasn't yet been invented.<p/>
R04 165 <p_>In this case you can swan in, past the hapless unhip in the 
R04 166 queue, and drink over-priced Sol through the throbbing early 
R04 167 hours. Once you've run the gauntlet of the doorman ('bouncer' in 
R04 168 such an unattractive word), been ticked off the guestlist, another 
R04 169 set of rituals has to be enacted. Clubs revolve around the DJ, a 
R04 170 now quite exalted figure since the original acid-house raves and 
R04 171 not to be confused with radio personalities such as Simon Bates or 
R04 172 Steve Wright In The Afternoon, to give him his real name.<p/>
R04 173 <p_>For a start, club DJs do not speak. Ever. They don't even have 
R04 174 microphones. And you go and ask him/her to play your favourite Top 
R04 175 20 tune at your peril. In fact you go and ask him/her to play 
R04 176 anything at your peril. It's just not done. You actually leave your 
R04 177 DJ absolutely alone because he has his headphones clamped to his 
R04 178 ear and he's working out the next 'seamless mix'. This is in fact 
R04 179 quite tricky as you try to match the next record beat-for-beat 
R04 180 to the one you're playing currently, so no one can spot the join. 
R04 181 Timing is crucial and some goon coming up, prodding you in the ribs 
R04 182 and asking if you're going to <quote_>"play some decent 
R04 183 music"<quote/> can put you right off your groove. But of course an 
R04 184 <*_>e-acute<*/>litist door policy is supposed to eliminate such 
R04 185 insensitive loutism.<p/>
R04 186 <p_>Even more uncool is to ask the DJ what he/she is playing. 
R04 187 Happening DJs generally play unmarked 'white label' 12-inch 
R04 188 pre-release advance copies not yet available to the public. The 
R04 189 unmarked white labels are also to avoid industrial espionage by 
R04 190 rival DJs. Chosen DJs are on record company mailing lists which 
R04 191 require them to return their comments as to the 'floor-filling 
R04 192 potential' of a particular record. You tick the appropriate box 
R04 193 against 'blinder' through to 'crap'. Depending on the response, 
R04 194 record companies follow up with a mail-shot to radio stations in 
R04 195 photo-copied felt pen hyping, sorry extolling the virtues of said 
R04 196 record. <quote_>"Going a storm in the clubs! Guaranteed floor-filler!! 
R04 197 Check all mixes!!! The big summer hit!!!"<quote/><p/>
R04 198 <p_>Not that your cool club crowd is fooled by hype. One wrong 
R04 199 record can be a disastrous 'flaw-klearer'.<p/>
R04 200 <p_>And then there's the club vernacular. The 20K sound rig 
R04 201 discourages discussion on post-constructivism in Soviet art. you 
R04 202 merely pass the comment 'sound' or 'top night' or 'cool' (even 
R04 203 though it isn't) and squeeze your face into some appropriate 
R04 204 expression of appreciation if things are 'going good'.<p/>
R04 205 <p_>The management will be keeping a keen eye on your dancing 
R04 206 expertise. This is the most ritualistic aspect of Clubland. You may 
R04 207 be a floor dancer or a podium dancer who chooses the raised area of 
R04 208 the dance floor to bop the night away amid smoke machines, lasers 
R04 209 and other buzz-creating or energy-expanding devices.

R05   3 <h|>Wednesday
R05   4 <p_>Today is the big day we have all been waiting for. The 
R05   5 <tf_>Daily Telegraph<tf/> coloured map of the world arrives! It 
R05   6 comes with a note from Mr Hurd saying that I should put it up on 
R05   7 the wall behind my desk. He says it will help me to know where all 
R05   8 the places are when the war starts. My first key decision comes 
R05   9 almost immediately. Should I use drawing pins, or blu-tac? I decide 
R05  10 on the latter, as it has always been Mrs Thatcher's favourite 
R05  11 colour! When the map is finally put up, I spend some considerable 
R05  12 period of time studying it. Iraq is really quite big, compared 
R05  13 with, say, Israel. I am glad to see, however, that America is 
R05  14 bigger than both of them!<p/>
R05  15 <h_><p_>Wednesday night<p/><h/>
R05  16 <p_>I get a phone call in the middle of the night on my special 
R05  17 grey telephone hotline. It is Mr Bush. Why do Americans never 
R05  18 remember that we are asleep when they are awake?! He says that he 
R05  19 has had to start the war without me, as he couldn't get through 
R05  20 earlier, and he hopes that that's alright. I tried to think of 
R05  21 something memorable to say, and luckily it came to me in a flash. 
R05  22 <quote_>"Oh yes,"<quote/> I said, but he had already hung up.<p/>
R05  23 <h|>Thursday
R05  24 <p_>We have the first meeting of our new War Cabinet. Me, Douglas, 
R05  25 Mr King, my friend Chris Patten and, of course, Norma Lamont from 
R05  26 next door. Norma kicked things off in great style by telling a joke 
R05  27 about Saddam Hussein and a dead camel. We all laughed although I 
R05  28 did not get the last bit. Then Douglas turned to me and said: 
R05  29 <quote_>"Well, Prime Minister, what are our war aims?"<quote/> 
R05  30 Honestly, Douglas can be very slow sometimes for someone who's been 
R05  31 to Oxford! <quote_>"We are aiming at Iraq of course,"<quote/> I 
R05  32 said firmly, pointing at where it was on the map.<p/>
R05  33 <p_>Then I told them that I had had a very long telephone call from 
R05  34 Mr Bush in the middle of the night. They were very impressed. 
R05  35 <quote_>"Oh yes,"<quote/> I said, <quote_>"it went on for some 
R05  36 considerable period of time."<quote/> My friend Chris smiled and 
R05  37 said: <quote_>"About a minute, I suppose."<quote/>. <quote_>"Oh 
R05  38 no,"<quote/> I said, <quote_>"not that long."<quote/><p/>
R05  39 <h|>Friday
R05  40 <p_>We have had a lot of letters about the war. It is amazing how 
R05  41 many of them forgot to put on the postcode, SW1 1PLC - which you 
R05  42 would have thought was pretty easy to remember!<p/>
R05  43 <h|>Saturday
R05  44 <p_>Today Norman and I had to go to Chequers (Mrs Thatcher's 
R05  45 country house, which she has lent me while I am Prime Minister). 
R05  46 First we had to go back to Graylings - that's our real home in the 
R05  47 country - to fetch some towels and my pocket calculator, which I 
R05  48 left there last weekend. On the way I told Norman about my 
R05  49 top-secret phone call from the President of America. <quote_>"But 
R05  50 you're not to tell anyone,"<quote/> I told her, <quote_>"because it 
R05  51 is still meant to be classified."<quote/> <quote_>"Don't be 
R05  52 silly,"<quote/> she said. <quote_>"It was on the 9 o'clock news 
R05  53 last night."<quote/> I was very annoyed at this 'leak'. In Mrs 
R05  54 Thatcher's day someone would have had to spend more time with their 
R05  55 family over something like this. <quote_>"If it was a 
R05  56 leak,"<quote/> Norman said, <quote_>"I bet it was your friend 
R05  57 Norma. I've never trusted him since that party at Jeffrey Archer's 
R05  58 when he and that actress got stuck in the lift 
R05  59 together."<quote/><p/>
R05  60 <h|>Sunday
R05  61 <p_>Today we had to go to church and be photographed. I wore my new 
R05  62 grey suit. The service was very nice but it went on for a 
R05  63 considerable period of time. The vicar made a special prayer about 
R05  64 peace, and he asked for divine help to strengthen all world leaders 
R05  65 in their efforts for peace. He then gave me a long hard look. I 
R05  66 wonder why? Perhaps he thought my choice of tie (Old Rutlishians - 
R05  67 light grey stripe on dark grey background) was inappropriate.<p/>
R05  68 <h|>Monday
R05  69 <p_>Norman is still in a sulk with me. While I was eating my 
R05  70 Weetabix (2 1/2 today), I told her: <quote_>"If you go on like 
R05  71 this, I shall have to call you Stormin' Norman."<quote/> This was 
R05  72 because of the American in Arabia who has been telling me what my 
R05  73 plans are for the war. She didn't see the joke, unfortunately.<p/>
R05  74 <h|>Tuesday
R05  75 <p_>Today I have to make a Big Speech in the House of Commons. Mr 
R05  76 O'Donnell says that I should speak for some considerable period of 
R05  77 time, and that it is very important that I should not just sound 
R05  78 like a dalek. <quote_>"Not that you do, of course, Prime 
R05  79 Minister,"<quote/> he added hurriedly. <quote_>"Oh yes,"<quote/> I 
R05  80 replied, <quote_>"I am my own man. I will obey."<quote/><p/>
R05  81 <h|>Wednesday
R05  82 <p_>All the papers said that my speech was a great success. One 
R05  83 even said I had been quite like Mr Churchill during the war, 
R05  84 especially in the bit when I said: <quote_>"If something nasty 
R05  85 happened to Mr Saddam then I for one would be quite pleased - oh 
R05  86 yes."<quote/><p/>

R05 109 there night and day glued to the set. I'm sick of it on all the 
R05 110 time ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 111 <p_>She strode purposefully to where Charles was sitting in his 
R05 112 Manfred Mann fin-de-si<*_>e-grave<*/>cle armchair (a gift from the 
R05 113 Armand Hammer Museum of Money in Illinois).<p/>
R05 114 <p_><quote_>"Look at that old general. Yak yak yakety-yak 
R05 115 ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 116 <p_><quote_>"No, no,"<quote/> Charles remonstrated. <quote_>"He's 
R05 117 awfully knowledgeable. I met him once when I was inspecting his 
R05 118 regiment in Amstrad in Germany. The 17th Queen's Own Paranormals. 
R05 119 He's explaining the sort of ground plan thingie."<quote/><p/>
R05 120 <p_>But Diana was not listening and she was in no mood for an 
R05 121 argument.<p/>
R05 122 <p_><quote_>"I for one have had enough of it. People want a change, 
R05 123 a break. Even that awful programme that you and Dr Barkworth did 
R05 124 would be better than this ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 125 <p_><quote_>"IT'S A THING that Dr Barkworth and I did. The ratings 
R05 126 were awfully high ..."<quote/> <quote_>"Who is it calling?"<quote/> 
R05 127 a young female BBC receptionist enquired impersonally.<p/>
R05 128 <p_><quote_>"Er  ...my name is Prince Charles."<quote/><p/>
R05 129 <p_><quote_>"From where?"<quote/><p/>
R05 130 <p_><quote_>"Er  ...Highgrove in Gloustershire. I haven't got the 
R05 131 postcode, I'm afraid."<quote/><p/>
R05 132 <p_><quote_>"No. What company?"<quote/><p/>
R05 133 <p_><quote_>"I'm a prince ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 134 <p_><quote_>"Prince? You want <tf_>Top of the Pops<tf/>. I'll put 
R05 135 you through."<quote/><p/>
R05 136 <p_><quote_>"No, no. Diana wants <tf_>Top of the Pops<tf/>. I want 
R05 137 Mr Botney of the sort of Arts & Architecture bit ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 138 <p_>There was a short silence followed by a piece of music, which 
R05 139 Charles immediately recognised as the 17th-century Italian composer 
R05 140 Badalamenti with his overture <tf_>Il Twin Peaks<tf/>.<p/>
R05 141 <p_>Finally there was a click, and the familiar voice of Mr Alan 
R05 142 Botney, the suave impresario of the airwaves, came on his carphone. 
R05 143 There was traffic noise in the background and it was difficult to 
R05 144 hear Mr Botney clearly.<p/>
R05 145 <p_><quote_>"Your Highness, what a pleasure. Some colleagues and I 
R05 146 were just saying, funnily enough, what a great pleasure it was 
R05 147 working with you and ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 148 <p_><quote_>"That's awfully kind,"<quote/> Charles interposed 
R05 149 impatiently. <quote_>"It's just that I was talking to Diana just 
R05 150 now and she's a terrific fan of the hit parade thing you do, the 
R05 151 <tf_>Top of the Jukebox<tf/>, and she really misses it. What I 
R05 152 thought was ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 153 <p_>Botney jumped in hurriedly. <quote_>"Yes, Sir. You're right, 
R05 154 Sir. We've had a lot of calls on this one."<quote/><p/>
R05 155 <p_>Charles continued: <quote_>"So I thought that since you've had 
R05 156 to take off all these programmes - you know, <tf_>Hallo, Hallo<tf/> 
R05 157 and <tf_>The Blackadder<tf/> ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 158 <p_>Charles read out a list from the <tf_>Sunday Telegraph<tf/> of 
R05 159 television programmes which has been described as 'too sensitive 
R05 160 for transmission'.<p/>
R05 161 <p_><quote_>"I thought,"<quote/> Charles went on trying to 
R05 162 establish his point, <quote_>"this might be just the time to give 
R05 163 the viewers another chance to see my documentary about 
R05 164 architecture. It was terrifically well received ..."<quote/><p/>
R05 165 <p_>There was the sound of a siren, and Mr Botney's voice became 
R05 166 indistinct.<p/>
R05 167 <p_><quote_>"What was that, Sir?"<quote/><p/>
R05 168 <p_><quote_>"<tf_>It Really Is Appalling<tf/>:"<quote/> Charles 
R05 169 repeated the title.<p/>
R05 170 <p_><quote_>"You're right, Sir. I'll do something at 
R05 171 once."<quote/><p/>
R05 172 <p_><quote_>"HE SAID he'd do something at once."<quote/> Charles 
R05 173 and Diana were sitting at Highgrove once more in front of the 
R05 174 Ishiguro 42-inch Videotronic Device. Charles was feeling pleased 
R05 175 with himself. It was so rare for him to influence events so 
R05 176 directly. Mr Botney had promised that the programme would appear 
R05 177 that very night. How had his old friend and mentor Sir Laurens van 
R05 178 der Post described that sensation of achievement? Wasn't it in 
R05 179 Chapter 12 of his classic, <tf_>The Rocks That Speak<tf/>?<p/>
R05 180 <p_><quote_>"Apples fall from a shaken tree, but trees do not fall 
R05 181 from a shaken apple."<quote/><p/>
R05 182 <p_>How very true that was, how very true.<p/>
R05 183 <p_>Diana flicked through the channels with the remote control.<p/>
R05 184 <p_><quote_>"So you're telling me it's on, are you?"<quote/><p/>
R05 185 <p_>Charles nodded.<p/>
R05 186 <p_><quote_>"Oh yes. Myself and Barkworth. It's just what the 
R05 187 country needs. Particularly that bit where we're on the barge in 
R05 188 the Thames and Dr Barkworth asks me what the tall building over 
R05 189 there is. And I smile at him and say 'I don't know, but it Really 
R05 190 Is Appalling'."<quote/><p/>
R05 191 <p_>But what was this, appearing suddenly on the screen? A black 
R05 192 man gyrating in pink trousers amidst a cloud of smoke. He didn't 
R05 193 remember this bit. Was that Barkworth in the baseball cap and the 
R05 194 gold medallion dangling from his chest?<p/>
R05 195 <p_>A BBC Continuity voice announced: <quote_>"And now due to 
R05 196 popular demand, and a very special request indeed, it's ...

R05 198 <p_>Diana squealed with delight and flung her arms around

R05 203 <p_>BY Enid Ryton<p/><h/>
R05 204 <p_>It was a lovely sunny day and Noddy climbed into his car. 
R05 205 <quote|>"Hello," he said. <quote_>"This NUCLEAR POWER 
R05 206 <foreign_>NEIN DANKE<foreign/> sticker wasn't here yesterday. How 
R05 207 strange! I don't remember it being a Citroen Deux Chevaux 
R05 208 either"<quote/>, he thought as he drove along the Old Bruce Kent 
R05 209 Road into Toytown.<p/>
R05 210 <p_>The first person he met was Mr Tubby Bear.<p/>
R05 211 <p_><quote_>"Hello Mr Tubby Bear, you fascist bastard,"<quote/> he 
R05 212 found himself saying. <quote_>"How dare you wear fur? Take 
R05 213 that!"<quote/><p/>
R05 214 <p_>And little Noddy poured red paint all over Mr Tubby Bear.<p/>
R05 215 <p_><quote_>"Gosh. I feel a bit different today,"<quote/> he 
R05 216 thought as he turned the corner and was waved down by WPC Plod.<p/>
R05 217 <p_><quote_>"Where's Policeman Plod?"<quote/> he asked.<p/>
R05 218 <p_><quote_>"He was sent down for racially harassing

R05 220 <p_><quote|>"Golly!" Noddy exclaimed.<p/>
R05 221 <p_><quote_>"Right. You're nicked as well."<quote/><p/>
R05 222 <p_>Oh no! Everything seemed to have changed to poor Noddy.<p/>
R05 223 <p_><quote_>"You have the right to one phone call,"<quote/> said 
R05 224 WPC Plod.<p/>
R05 225 <p_><quote|>"Alright," he said, unable to stop himself picking up 
R05 226 the toy phone. <quote_>"I'll phone Esther. Hello Esther? It's about 
R05 227 Big Ears. He's a perv."<quote/><p/>
R05 228 <p_><quote_>"Good little Noddy,"<quote/> said WPC Plod. 
R05 229 <quote_>"I'm letting you off with a caution."<quote/><p/>
R05 230 <p_>So Noddy went on his way and who should he see next but Sailor 
R05 231 Doll?<p/>
R05 232 <p_><quote_>"Hello, Sailor,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
R05 233 <p_><quote_>"That's it Noddy!"<quote/> interrupted Sally Social 
R05 234 Worker (n<*_>e-acute<*/>e Skittle). <quote_>"That's the last time

R06   1 <#FLOB:R06\><h_><p_>A right royal ragging<p/><h/>
R06   2 <p_><tf_>Are the tabloids swinging towards republicanism? Not while 
R06   3 the royals act as big stick with which to beat the left, says John 
R06   4 Diamond<tf/><p/>
R06   5 <p_>A theory currently going the rounds of the diasporate Fleet 
R06   6 Street is that the Murdoch tabloids have got it in for the royals. 
R06   7 That the glorious republic, when it comes, will be heralded by a 
R06   8 rollicking Ron Spark leader (<quote_>"The <tf|>Sun Says Give Us 
R06   9 Liberty, Folks, or Give Us Death!"<quote/>) is, apparently, finally 
R06  10 proved by the <tf|>Sun's publication, last week, of a photograph 
R06  11 showing the Duke of York as only his mother, his wife and a few 
R06  12 dozen hopeful debs had previously seen him. It was hardly hot news. 
R06  13 The photo was seven years old and those parts of the Duke's 
R06  14 genitalia that weren't covered by the spray from the Canadian river 
R06  15 in which he was <quote_>"... skinny dipping after a hike with old 
R06  16 school pals"<quote/> were obscured with a large crown sketched in 
R06  17 by the <tf|>Sun's art department; even thus coyly displayed, the 
R06  18 picture proved, blustered Neil Thorne MP, that the <tf|>Sun is 
R06  19 determined <quote_>"to undermine the Royal Family"<quote/>.<p/>
R06  20 <p_>Well perhaps it is and perhaps it isn't. <quote_>"Think about 
R06  21 it,"<quote/> says one <tf|>Sun staffer. <quote_>"Rupert Murdoch is 
R06  22 an Australian by birth. Australians tend to resent the royals 
R06  23 family. And Murdoch was a mate of Gough Whitlam whose government 
R06  24 was brought down by the Governor General, which as far as most 
R06  25 Australians are concerned, means the Queen. How could he be 
R06  26 anything other than a republican?"<quote/> This is just the sort of 
R06  27 convoluted conspiracy theory that you'd normally see only in the 
R06  28 tabloids' own opinion columns, but it's a view I've heard from a 
R06  29 number of senior journalists recently. Unfortunately, it ignores 
R06  30 the fact that, although Murdoch had once been a friend of, and had 
R06  31 supported, Whitlam, by the time of Whitlam's fall, the Murdoch 
R06  32 papers in Australia were at the head of the press pack baying for 
R06  33 his blood.<p/>
R06  34 <p_>It ignores, too, the more salient point that Murdoch's 
R06  35 political line has only ever been consistent in terms of its 
R06  36 pragmatism and never in terms of ideology. Indeed, I was told by 
R06  37 one Murdoch manager the other week that there is a move to turn 
R06  38 <tf|>Today into a Labour paper: <quote_>"There's a chance that 
R06  39 Labour will get in at the next election, and it would be useful to 
R06  40 have a sympathetic paper around as a defence against all those 
R06  41 Labour MPs who will be out to get us for winning the last three 
R06  42 elections for the Tories."<quote/><p/>
R06  43 <p_>But the 'Andrew Romps Naked in Lake' story is only the latest 
R06  44 in a series that, the monarchists suggest, is hard evidence of a 
R06  45 tabloid swing towards, at best, a prurient 
R06  46 <foreign|>l<*_>e-grave<*/>se-majest<*_>e-acute<*/> and, at worst, 
R06  47 outright republicanism. Simon Hughes' bill to tax the royal income 
R06  48 got him a useful 'Pay Up, Ma'am' editorial in the <tf|>Sun and a 
R06  49 full page of fence<?_>-<?/>striding punditry in <tf|>Today. Nigel 
R06  50 Dempster signed a front-page splash in the <tf|>Mail announcing the 
R06  51 imminent split up of the Prince and Princess of Wales as 'A Cause 
R06  52 for Concern' and on Sunday the <tf_>News of the World<tf/> showed a 
R06  53 grubby picture of a minor-league royal at a rubber fetishists' 
R06  54 party as evidence of the Windsor family's irredeemable 
R06  55 decadence.<p/>
R06  56 <p_>I wish I could tell you that all of this means our present 
R06  57 Queen will be the last. It doesn't.<p/>
R06  58 <p_>At the most basic level, the tabloids don't want to lose the 
R06  59 royals for the same reason that they don't want to lose Arthur 
R06  60 Scargill, the Bishop of Durham, Myra Hindley or Romping Roger The 
R06  61 Randy Reverend. These figureheads are not just a source of what 
R06  62 passes for news in a newsless newspaper, but moral makers against 
R06  63 which the tabloids may voyeuristically measure their own high 
R06  64 principles and those of their readers. And the royals have a 
R06  65 particular journalistic advantage over every other public figure: 
R06  66 their private lives are precisely that. Each tabloid has its own 
R06  67 Man The Royals Trust or The Woman In The Know, but the fact is that 
R06  68 those who really do know - and they are rarely tabloid journalists 
R06  69 or anything like - don't tell. If they do tell, then they stop 
R06  70 being in the know, which is the last thing they want. Once a 
R06  71 tabloid royal-watcher who had just signed a piece to the effect 
R06  72 that Prince Edward's leaving the Royal Marines was but a step away 
R06  73 from his appearance in the Danny La Rue Follies spent some time 
R06  74 trying to convince me that Edward had been on the phone to him as 
R06  75 soon as the piece appeared congratulating him on his journalistic 
R06  76 acumen. I didn't believe him then, nor would I now.<p/>
R06  77 <p_>Even when the odd scandalous word does creep out of the palace 
R06  78 it's rarely published. There is, for instance, a persistent rumour 
R06  79 regarding the illicit lover apparently maintained by one of the 
R06  80 most senior royal women. It has a much better provenance than most 
R06  81 such rumours, suggesting, as it does, that one of the Mistresses of 
R06  82 the Royal Bedchamber has been working after hours with a pair of 
R06  83 binoculars and a notebook. I have yet to see it in print. Nor, I 
R06  84 imagine, will I unless the parties concerned choose to make it 
R06  85 public.<p/>
R06  86 <p_>The precedent for this sort of secrecy goes back no further 
R06  87 than the abdication crisis of 1935. Then the King's private 
R06  88 secretary met with Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of the <tf|>Times, 
R06  89 and subsequently wrote to Edward that:<quote_>"The silence of the 
R06  90 British Press on the subject of Your Majesty's friendship is not 
R06  91 going to be maintained."<quote/> But it wasn't until the 
R06  92 <tf|>Mirror took the lead from the foreign press that the vague 
R06  93 allusions that had been made thus far became a proper story. 
R06  94 Despite a lengthy hiatus in Fleet Street's royal gossip-mongering 
R06  95 during Victoria's reign there has been a long tradition of the 
R06  96 press stirring the sticky royal pot.<p/>
R06  97 <p_>Then, as now, the press took sides. There have always been, as 
R06  98 far as the press is concerned - and for the totally arbitrary 
R06  99 reasons that papers apply in these matters - good royals and bad 
R06 100 royals. Now we have 'caring' Diana versus 'spendthrift' Fergie, 
R06 101 'Princess Pushy of Kent' versus the 'charitable' Princess Royal. In 
R06 102 1788, during the Regency crisis when papers called, I promise you, 
R06 103 the <tf|>Sun and the <tf|>Star were making uncomfortable waves, 
R06 104 <tf_>The World & Fashionable Designer<tf/> took the side of the 
R06 105 Prince of Wales. He was so impressed that he offered to buy the 
R06 106 paper for pounds4,000 and give Major Topham, its proprietor, a 
R06 107 pounds400 annuity for life. Topham turned down the offer, but was 
R06 108 happy to take a royal subsidy instead.<p/>
R06 109 <p_>So if Buckingham Palace was handing out subsidies today, who 
R06 110 would get them?<p/>
R06 111 <p_>Royalty, as far as the tabloids are concerned, is separate from 
R06 112 politics. Indeed, when Prince Philip attacked double-dealing in the 
R06 113 City a while back, and Princess Anne suggested that working mothers 
R06 114 might not have the best deal in the world, <tf|>Today (which was 
R06 115 then going through its Green Tory Yuppie Phase) announced that it 
R06 116 was not <quote_>"... right for the two royals to tangle in 
R06 117 politics. Neither was elected or chosen in any way for the position 
R06 118 which led to them speaking out. As royals they have a vast public 
R06 119 platform yet no responsibility to go with it."<quote/> Rather like 
R06 120 the tabloid press, in fact. <quote_>"Who is to say,"<quote/> it 
R06 121 went on, <quote_>"that Prince William, currently a mischievous 
R06 122 little boy, will not one day launch into a tirade of repellent 
R06 123 opinions?"<quote/><p/>
R06 124 <p_>But even if the papers can't make the connection between a 
R06 125 constitutional monarchy and the way the country is run, it's by 
R06 126 looking laterally at a tabloid's politics that you can get a handle 
R06 127 on its attitudes towards the royals. This is not to say that the 
R06 128 Tory <tf|>Sun is entirely pro-Queen or the Labour <tf|>Mirror 
R06 129 entirely anti. Rather, look at the Queen and her courtiers as the 
R06 130 executives of The Royalty Corp, a nationalised industry heavily 
R06 131 subsidised by the taxpayer, and the political equation works rather 
R06 132 better.<p/>
R06 133 <p_>Thus the <tf|>Sun, and the <tf_>News of the World<tf/>, its 
R06 134 sister paper, see the royal business as a valuable national asset 
R06 135 and one we should all be proud of, but one which should stand on 
R06 136 its own well-shod feet. As a public utility it should be open to 
R06 137 scrutiny by the public: no activity of its executives should go 
R06 138 unpublished, no boardroom rift between, say, Charles, the deputy 
R06 139 chairman and Diana, vice-president (handshakes) should pass without 
R06 140 comment, no overseas fact-finding mission should be undertaken by 
R06 141 Sarah, vice-president (frocks) unless the <tf|>Sun thinks there is 
R06 142 a good reason for it.<p/>
R06 143 <p_>Despite its declared voting intentions, the <tf|>Mirror has 
R06 144 always been more unashamedly monarchist than its upstart rival. 
R06 145 Partly this is for historic reasons: for decades the <tf|>Mirror 
R06 146 was the only working-class paper and felt it incumbent upon itself 
R06 147 to report respectfully on the bread and circuses that were laid on 
R06 148 for its readers. To continue to corporate analogy, though, the 
R06 149 <tf|>Mirror sees The Royalty Corp as an essential industry and thus 
R06 150 one that can drain the public purse without too many questions 
R06 151 being asked. When Wendy Henry - a Murdoch graduate and thus a 
R06 152 member of the school that believes that the company report should 
R06 153 go into the minutest detail - published a picture in the Mirror 
R06 154 Group's <tf|>People of a princeling taking a leak, Robert Maxwell 
R06 155 sacked her. She had gone too far. While other royalist papers 
R06 156 berated the <tf|>Sun for publishing the naked Andy picture, the 
R06 157 <tf|>Mirror ignored it completely.<p/>
R06 158 <p_>It is only the middle-market tabloids that are unreservedly 
R06 159 royalist. The modern monarchist class-theory suggests that since 
R06 160 Victoria's accession and the subsequent reinvention of a royal 
R06 161 family, which until then had been generally regarded as a bunch of 
R06 162 freeloading foreigners, our monarchy has been, essentially, a 
R06 163 middle-class institution run by the aristocracy for middle-class 
R06 164 consumption. The subsumption of Di and Fergie into that into that 
R06 165 institution, together with the transformation of Edward and Lord 
R06 166 Lindley into ordinary working guys has only served to confirm that 
R06 167 belief. And thus the <tf|>Mail and the <tf|>Express support the 
R06 168 royals not just as a glorious British example to the world, but in 
R06 169 much the same way as they support the CBI or tax relief on 
R06 170 mortgages.<p/>
R06 171 <p_>So, when the <tf|>Mail or, much more rarely, the <tf|>Express 
R06 172 runs a disapprobationary royal story - like Demspter's recent 
R06 173 report of the Wales' decision to use separate osteopaths, it will 
R06 174 be more in sorrow than in anger. The <tf|>Express's job is to 
R06 175 report royalty (it runs rather more straight captioned pictures of 
R06 176 royals opening things and visiting hospital beds than the other 
R06 177 papers) and occasionally to remind royalty of the terms of their 
R06 178 job description. The <tf|>Sun reports rumours of the Princess 
R06 179 Royal's post-marital assignations because the <tf|>Sun will report 
R06 180 rumours of anybody's post-marital assignations; the <tf|>Express 
R06 181 does so, it suggests, because every so often it's necessary to 
R06 182 remind our betters that we commoners have high expectations of 
R06 183 them.<p/>
R06 184 <p_>The monarchy, then, is in no danger from the tabloids - not 
R06 185 even the Murdoch tabloids. For, even if they served no other 
R06 186 purpose, the royals will always function as another big stick with 
R06 187 which to bash the left. Witness the <tf|>Sun, in a rallying 
R06 188 editorial against the <tf_>New Statesman's<tf/> own anti-Jubliee 
R06 189 issue in June 1977: <quote_>"Out of the woodwork they crawl - the 
R06 190 termites of the left. The knockers, moaners and miseries who just 
R06 191 can't bear the thought that this weekend the Queen is the most 
R06 192 popular lady in the land."<quote/><p/>
R06 193 <p_>And the problem for any republicans, hopeful that the 
R06 194 <tf|>Sun's latest subversion will change things, is that she 
R06 195 probably is.<p/>
R06 196 <h_><p_>Has the crack epidemic materialised, asks Vicky 
R06 197 Hutchings<p/>
R06 198 <p_>A paler shade of white<p/><h/>
R06 199 <p_>So what <tf|>is crack? Most people I asked had only a hazy 
R06 200 idea: it's spiked heroin, it's cocaine mixed with sugar or salt, 
R06 201 it's cocaine mixed with some strange chemical, it's a cheaper sort 
R06 202 of cocaine, and, if you believe the <tf|>Guardian, it's cocaine 
R06 203 mixed with water. In fact, it's cocaine heated with bicarbonate of 
R06 204 soda to remove the impurities and produce 'rocks' or 'stones' of 
R06 205 pure crystallised cocaine, which can then be smoked to give a 
R06 206 'high'.<p/>

R07   2 <p_>GOING TO THE PARTY<p/>
R07   3 <p_>OFFICIAL BOOZE UP<p/><h/>
R07   4 <p_>Whilst Geoffrey was being pursued by murderers and discovering 
R07   5 the theft of his television, Sam Turk, the man responsible for this 
R07   6 mystifying harrassment<&|>sic!, was in the back of a luxury car on 
R07   7 his way to Brighton. Starting on the morrow, Brighton was to play 
R07   8 host to a Party Political Conference, or Party Political Piss-up 
R07   9 as the more honest politician would concede.<p/>
R07  10 <p_>There is a similar institution in the world of marketing, it is 
R07  11 called a 'sales conference' which, despite its business-like 
R07  12 title, is a corporate institution whereby the staff get the 
R07  13 opportunity to become legless at the company's expense and the 
R07  14 sales reps have a chance to try and shag the secretaries. Of course 
R07  15 this is denied absolutely when the Inland Revenue queries the 
R07  16 drinks bill. Then much corporate gobbledegook is spouted concerning 
R07  17 'late night policy sessions', 'target dinners' and 'strike-unit 
R07  18 damage control briefings'. None the less, the sales conference is a 
R07  19 piss-up. And why not? It is a small reward, a chance to get out 
R07  20 of the Ford Sierra and into the bar; to get away from the 
R07  21 typewriter and into a little black cocktail number. It forges 
R07  22 <foreign_>esprit de corps<foreign/>. The Japanese have their 
R07  23 company songs and exercise sessions; the British have their eleven 
R07  24 pints of lager and at 3 a.m. attempt to break into the hotel 
R07  25 swimming pool. People need a chance to express themselves.<p/>
R07  26 <p_>Party Conferences are the political world's equivalent of these 
R07  27 fine corporate institutions. The only difference being that they 
R07  28 last a week and provide an excellent opportunity for behind the 
R07  29 scenes wheeler-dealing. This was why Sam Turk was going to 
R07  30 Brighton.<p/>
R07  31 <h_><p_>KILLER ON THE LOOSE<p/><h/>
R07  32 <p_>Sam was not a politician, not in the elected sense anyway. But 
R07  33 he certainly dealt in power. He was a carmaker.<p/>
R07  34 <p_>He worked for Global Motors, a US based multi-national auto 
R07  35 manufacturing company, and he had come to London the previous year 
R07  36 with the declared intention of kicking some English bottoms at 
R07  37 Global Motors UK. The British motor industry, as Sam well knew, was 
R07  38 still residing in the 1920s which, considering the US motor 
R07  39 industry had made it as far as the 1950s, meant that Sam had a lot 
R07  40 of work to do. The Japanese motor industry is, of course in the 
R07  41 1990s. It was Global Motors's secret target that by the year 2015, 
R07  42 they would be in the 1990s too.<p/>
R07  43 <p_>For the moment however cars were not on Sam's mind, but killing 
R07  44 was. In his briefcase lay hidden the most exciting designs that he 
R07  45 had ever come across. However, in order for Sam to realize their 
R07  46 full potential, he needed their creator dead.<p/>
R07  47 <p_><quote_>"D'yah knock out the professor guy?"<quote/> Sam asked 
R07  48 Springer, his loyal Lieutenant of many years.<p/>
R07  49 <p_>Springer winced a little at this abrupt enquiry. He had not 
R07  50 enjoyed the task of organizing a murder one little bit. In fact he 
R07  51 had for the first time in all his loyal service attempted to defy 
R07  52 Sam. It was only after Sam had reluctantly shared the momentous 
R07  53 secrets of the plans with him that Springer had steeled himself to 
R07  54 the task. It was immediately clear to Springer that the good of the 
R07  55 company, indeed the good of the entire economy of the United 
R07  56 States, might be at stake.<p/>
R07  57 <p_><quote_>"I guess he must have bought the farm by now,"<quote/> 
R07  58 Springer replied. He had served in Korea and loved to talk like a 
R07  59 soldier.<p/>
R07  60 <p_>Sam nodded with a grim satisfaction, none the less, he could 
R07  61 not help but feel a pang of something. One wouldn't go so far as to 
R07  62 say it was actual remorse, but it was definitely regret. Sam had 
R07  63 led a pretty rough life in the paranoid world of the US motor 
R07  64 industry and he had done wicked and unpleasant things. But he had 
R07  65 never before had anybody killed.<p/>
R07  66 <p_><quote_>"I can't help feeling that bumping the guy off was 
R07  67 wrong,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
R07  68 <p_>Springer was surprised, it was most unusual for his boss to be 
R07  69 tormented by doubt.<p/>
R07  70 <p_><quote_>"I can get the driver to haul ass to a church boss. It 
R07  71 might be best to let a priest handle this,"<quote/> he said 
R07  72 sympathetically.<p/>
R07  73 <p_><quote_>"I ain't talking morally wrong,"<quote/> said Sam. 
R07  74 <quote_>"We had a serious situation, and we made a move. That's 
R07  75 business, that's what I'm paid to do, my conscience is clear. But 
R07  76 was it the <tf|>right move I ask myself? Death <tf|>is kind of 
R07  77 radical. I still can't believe we couldn'a bought the damn thing 
R07  78 off the little fuck'n' brain box."<quote/><p/>
R07  79 <p_><quote_>"I'm telling you Sir, there's no way he would have 
R07  80 sold,"<quote/> said Springer. <quote_>"We ran a full background 
R07  81 make on the guy, major reconnaissance. He's a public transport nut, 
R07  82 he hates private cars, reckons we should all be sat behind each 
R07  83 other on stinking buses, picking the chewing gum off our 
R07  84 pants."<quote/><p/>
R07  85 <p_><quote_>"Mother of God ain't people sick?"<quote/> said Sam in 
R07  86 disgust. <quote/>"The guy's probably into free love 
R07  87 too."<quote/><p/>
R07  88 <p_><quote/>"I guess he would be at that,"<quote/> Springer 
R07  89 agreed.<p/>
R07  90 <p_><quote_>"You want someone like that having the right to ball 
R07  91 your old lady?"<quote/> Sam was working himself up into a fine 
R07  92 state of self-justification. <quote_>"Smoking his pot and 
R07  93 corrupting college kids? He got what was his. We did the world a 
R07  94 favour."<quote/><p/>
R07  95 <p_><quote_>"We had to do it, Sir,"<quote/> Springer affirmed. 
R07  96 <quote_>"His invention in the wrong hands could take out our entire 
R07  97 operation. They'd be sending Global Motors home in a body 
R07  98 bag."<quote/><p/>
R07  99 <p_>This last analogy was sufficiently ghoulish to reconcentrate 
R07 100 the minds of the two men on the human cost of their business 
R07 101 decisions. They lapsed into a brief silence.<p/>
R07 102 <p_><quote|>"Yeah," said Sam eventually. <quote_>"The little commie 
R07 103 sure had it coming."<quote/><p/>
R07 104 <h|>DELAYS
R07 105 <p_>The knock-on effects of the protest rally which had impeded 
R07 106 Geoffrey's escape continued to paralyse part of London. Traffic 
R07 107 jams are strange things, the resonate. As when a stone is dropped 
R07 108 in a pond, the matter does not end with the initial plop. Six feet 
R07 109 away some frog in a lily gets a series of rhythmic ripples up the 
R07 110 back flap and hops off going <tf|>ribbit and looking for something 
R07 111 semi-aquatic to shag. It is the same with traffic. It's quite 
R07 112 possible for a person to miss a train at Waterloo because half an 
R07 113 hour previously a one-driver bus on the Strand was confronted 
R07 114 with someone who didn't speak English, only had a twenty pound note 
R07 115 and wanted to be taken somewhere that provided traditional English 
R07 116 scenes, haddock and tea-time. Traffic jams never actually end, 
R07 117 they merely expand and contract, merging into one another, 
R07 118 endlessly connected by frustration and grinding synchromesh. There 
R07 119 is a little bit of the very first traffic jam in every one that has 
R07 120 happened since.<p/>
R07 121 <p_>Sam was caught up in the ripple effect. His car, like his 
R07 122 industry, was at a standstill and he was getting impatient.<p/>
R07 123 <p_><quote|>"Jeez," he barked, lowering the electric window which 
R07 124 separated him from the driver. <quote_>"I never seen the city this 
R07 125 bad. It's Sunday goddamit, doesn't anyone in this damn country 
R07 126 worship the lord any more? What the hell's going on?"<quote/> The 
R07 127 driver explained that the traffic was particularly bad that day 
R07 128 because there had been a huge protest rally in Hyde Park and the 
R07 129 effects had fanned out across the city.<p/>
R07 130 <p_><quote_>"A <tf|>protest rally? What, like a hippy 
R07 131 thing?"<quote/> gasped Sam in astonishment. <quote_>"I don't 
R07 132 believe this fucking country! It's like it never left the middle 
R07 133 ages! A <tf|>protest rally! What's there to protest about, there 
R07 134 ain't no war or anything? Sometimes I just want to throw in the 
R07 135 towel. The whole of Eastern Europe comes to its senses and kids in 
R07 136 the West are still shouting about Ho Chi Minh."<quote/><p/>
R07 137 <p_>The driver explained to Sam that the protest was to do with the 
R07 138 suspected new road plans for London and the South-East of 
R07 139 England. Sam knew all about these plans. In his capacity as boss of 
R07 140 Global Motors UK he was on very close acquaintance with Digby 
R07 141 Parkhurst, the Minister for Transport and whole-heartedly 
R07 142 supported his policies. This was something which Digby took great 
R07 143 pleasure in. It did not occur to Digby that it was perhaps a little 
R07 144 unhealthy for a person whose function was to represent the best 
R07 145 interests of the people in the area of transport, to be quite so 
R07 146 close to one of the country's largest car manufacturers.<p/>
R07 147 <p_>Sam was delighted.<p/>
R07 148 <p_><quote_>"A protest about the road plans! Well that's great," he 
R07 149 cried. <quote_>"That is my kind of protest. What is it, they don't 
R07 150 think it's radical enough? I told that stupid son of a bitch 
R07 151 Parkhurst that nobody gives a damn about Nelson's 
R07 152 column."<quote/><p/>
R07 153 <p_>The driver was forced to disillusion Sam as to the political 
R07 154 slant of the march. <quote_>"<tf|>Objecting to roads!"<quote/> said 
R07 155 Sam in astonishment. <quote_>"But that's crazy! What are they gonna 
R07 156 object to next? Food? Don't they want to be able to get from A to 
R07 157 B!"<quote/><p/>
R07 158 <p_><quote_>"I think that they're concerned that there should still 
R07 159 be an A to come from an A to come from and a B to go to 
R07 160 Sir,"<quote/> replied the driver who cherished his 
R07 161 individualism.<p/>
R07 162 <p_><quote_>"What did he say?"<quote/> enquired Sam who, as was his 
R07 163 wont, had only been asking a rhetorical question.<p/>
R07 164 <p_><quote/>"I think he said that he'd better button his lip or get 
R07 165 fired,"<quote/> said Springer, raising the sound-proofed electric 
R07 166 window again.<p/>
R07 167 <p_>Sam looked sadly out at the rag-bag of protestors making 
R07 168 their way home. <quote_>"I don't know,"<quote/> he said wearily. 
R07 169 <quote_>"People. You try to make a better world for them, and what 
R07 170 do they do? Throw ball-bearings under police horses."<quote/><p/>
R07 171 <p_>It was while Sam was having this philosophical ponder on the 
R07 172 ingratitude of 'the little fellow' that Springer's personal phone 
R07 173 rang.<p/>
R07 174 <p_><quote_>"This is it Boss. News from the dead 
R07 175 professor,"<quote/> said Springer.<p/>
R07 176 <p_><quote_>"You got hit-men calling you here? In <tf|>my 
R07 177 car!"<quote/> replied an astonished Sam.<p/>
R07 178 <p_><quote|>"Relax," said Springer. <quote_>"This is a brand new 
R07 179 portable phone, after this call I chuck it in a river."<quote/> He 
R07 180 answered the phone.<p/>
R07 181 <p_><quote_>"What's he say? What's he say?"<quote/> Sam demanded 
R07 182 impatiently. Springer's face had fallen.<p/>
R07 183 <p_><quote_>"He says the Gerbil is still twitching."<quote/><p/>
R07 184 <p_><quote_>"And why did he say that?"<quote/> asked Sam, not 
R07 185 unreasonably.<p/>
R07 186 <p_><quote_>"Because the guy ain't dead yet. They missed 
R07 187 him,"<quote/> Springer admitted.<p/>
R07 188 <p_>Sam grabbed the phone in a fury.<p/>
R07 189 <p_><quote_>"Now listen here, you lazy, Limey fruit!"<quote/> he 
R07 190 shouted. <quote_>"When I employ tradesmen I expect them to get the 
R07 191 job done and get outa my face, not to ring my car to say some 
R07 192 hampster is still doing the rumba. What you doin' you English fuck? 
R07 193 Taking a <tf|>tea-break? On a frigging <tf|>strike? Jesus Christ, 
R07 194 what is it with you English? You can't make cars, you can't kill 
R07 195 people, how the hell d'you ever get yourselves an empire? I'll tell 
R07 196 you how, you got the <tf|>Scots do it for you! That's 
R07 197 how."<quote/><p/>
R07 198 <p_><quote_>"<foreign_>Pardonnez moi, monsieur<foreign/>," said the 
R07 199 impeccably polite French voice of the contract killer on the end of 
R07 200 the line. <quote_>"I'm an Anatole Chiraud of Euro Despatch and I 
R07 201 can assure you that the gerbil which you require to be sedated has 
R07 202 only been briefly mislaid. The contract will be completed as soon 
R07 203 as possible."<quote/><p/>
R07 204 <p_>The line went dead, leaving Sam frustrated and bemused.<p/>
R07 205 <p_><quote_>"A French hit-man?"<quote/> said Sam. <quote_>"What 
R07 206 is he going to do, breathe on the guy?"<quote/><p/>
R07 207 <h_><p_>CONCRETE AND STEEL<p/><h/>
R07 208 <p_>Digby Parkhurst, the Minister for Transport, friend of Sam Turk 
R07 209 and the man at whose image the students had spent the afternoon 
R07 210 chanting <quote_>"Out out out"<quote/>, was preparing for his 
R07 211 departure to the conference at Brighton. He was a little sad 
R07 212 because he was going to have to leave his beloved models behind 
R07 213 him. They were beautiful models, mounted on trestle tables all 
R07 214 through his department, and he loved to touch them. He loved to 
R07 215 feel the long, grey ribbons and stick his fingers in the tiny 
R07 216 little tunnels. The models were of bits of the British Isles, 
R07 217 although a native of those same islands would have been hard to put 
R07 218 to recognize them as such. Hills had been removed, villages 
R07 219 relocated, lochs drained, and in their place were roads - long, 
R07 220 empty, beautiful roads.<p/>
R07 221 
R07 222 
R08   1 <#FLOB:R08\><h_><p_>CHAPTER 7<p/><h/>
R08   2 <p_>The party was quite organized. Milo was bringing all his bright 
R08   3 young literary friends, Sebastian had been alerted, Sergei was 
R08   4 coming with some of his more disreputable cronies, Roger was 
R08   5 bringing Kiki, for a joke, Nicholas was bringing his pocket camera 
R08   6 and a tape recorder, and Alabama and Venice had spent all day 
R08   7 getting ready.<p/>
R08   8 <p_>Oliver surveyed his flat. It did look like a slice of heaven, 
R08   9 with the heavy orange evening sun slanting through the wide 
R08  10 windows. The caterers had surpassed themselves. A great table was 
R08  11 laden with the kind of food so avant-garde that most people didn't 
R08  12 even know what it was called. Oliver hardly knew himself. All he 
R08  13 knew was that it certainly looked far too pretty to eat, which was 
R08  14 the point of food, in his mind. What he had hated most about school 
R08  15 food was not so much that it tasted of old socks, but that it had 
R08  16 looked so ugly. Mealtimes had been a torture to him all through his 
R08  17 childhood.<p/>
R08  18 <p_>In the bathroom, the bath was filled with ice and rows and rows 
R08  19 of Dom Perignon in its elegant green bottles. Not for Oliver the 
R08  20 ignominy of having champagne served with napkins carefully placed 
R08  21 to obscure the label. There was nothing more shabby, in his 
R08  22 opinion.<p/>
R08  23 <p_>Enormous vases of lilies, pale half-open roses, and orchids 
R08  24 were everywhere, their scent mingling with the heady smell of 
R08  25 Floris lamp oil. Oliver put Mozart's piano concerto for two pianos 
R08  26 on the record player. There was something almost unbearably 
R08  27 decadent about a piano concerto for two pianos.<p/>
R08  28 <p_>Oliver gave a great sigh of utter satisfaction He did so love 
R08  29 the moments before a party, when the room was quiet and still, 
R08  30 ready to receive its babel of guests, and the anticipation of the 
R08  31 night to come was a sharp excited thrill in the stomach. He looked 
R08  32 about the room one last time, as if to reassure himself of its 
R08  33 perfection, and went to give himself a final glance in the looking 
R08  34 glass. It pleased him so much that the Crolla shirt he had chosen 
R08  35 so carefully exactly matched the flowers. Really, he did show 
R08  36 flashes of genius sometimes. He smoothed his hair unnecessarily 
R08  37 with a supplicating little gesture. He looked a pictures and he 
R08  38 knew it. He smiled at himself with love.<p/>
R08  39 <p_><quote_>"You are quite to die for,"<quote/> he told his 
R08  40 reflection with feeling. His reflection smiled graciously back, 
R08  41 adept at accepting a compliment.<p/>
R08  42 <p_>And now for the performance to begin. It was going to be quite 
R08  43 a night.<p/>
R08  44 <p_>Alabama sighed, tossed her head a little, frowned twice, and 
R08  45 tried to start from the beginning. Her bed was littered with 
R08  46 clothes. It was too hot for velvet, and the pale chiffon had a mark 
R08  47 on it. The washed linen shirt was just too understated, and the 
R08  48 crushed silk Bruce Oldfield was just too much. Alabama concentrated 
R08  49 as hard as she could. There must be something that was just right. 
R08  50 She sighed again, a little wistfully. She thought of the days when 
R08  51 it had taken her five minutes to get dressed to go out. Those 
R08  52 simple days when it was a matter of which pair of jeans was clean. 
R08  53 She looked rather piteously at her old cowboy boots, scuffed from 
R08  54 years of uncomplaining service, now consigned to the depths of the 
R08  55 wardrobe. It was all very well turning herself into the latter day 
R08  56 answer to Ava Gardner, but no one had warned her about all the work 
R08  57 involved. She drew herself up tall, pausing to admire her silk 
R08  58 underwear. She did look rather fine in it. She couldn't let a small 
R08  59 thing like this defeat her. She was the best playwright of her 
R08  60 generation. She had a double first. She was brilliant. She was not 
R08  61 going to be thwarted by a tiny matter like what to wear. She took a 
R08  62 deep breath, and started again.<p/>
R08  63 <p_>Venice finished painting her lips and pouted at herself in the 
R08  64 glass. She did have the best pout in London. She had much to be 
R08  65 thankful for. She smoothed the perfection of her brow, which ached 
R08  66 a little from all last week. She was almost ashamed to admit that 
R08  67 she found the <tf_>Daily Telegraph<tf/> rather amusing, and that 
R08  68 she didn't miss the <tf|>Mail nearly as much as she had expected. 
R08  69 Perhaps she was a closet intellectual after all. That would be a 
R08  70 thing. Imagine, after all these years, a Venice who minded about 
R08  71 more than finding exactly the right dress to wear to a party. Life 
R08  72 did throw up the most extraordinary surprises, just when one was 
R08  73 least expecting them. Venice looked at her face again, something 
R08  74 she never tired of. It looked rather strange with so little make-up 
R08  75 on. Rather fine, really. Almost ethereal, in fact. Perhaps 
R08  76 intellectual? Venice told herself to stop being fanciful. Enough 
R08  77 was enough, after all.<p/>
R08  78 <p_>It took her hardly a moment to dress. She had decided to strike 
R08  79 a balance somewhere between glamour and utter carelessness. She 
R08  80 still drew the line at wearing jeans to a party, whatever Alabama 
R08  81 said, so she had settled on a little black dress. Venice knew all 
R08  82 about little black dresses and their importance in the history of 
R08  83 seduction. She knew that every girl should have at least one. This 
R08  84 particular one was simple and short and made of material that clung 
R08  85 lovingly to her figure. No jewels, Venice decided firmly, with 
R08  86 hardly a backward glance at her box of baubles, the box which only 
R08  87 a week ago had given her so much pleasure, the box which she could 
R08  88 quite happily gaze at for an hour, when she had an hour to spare. 
R08  89 No jewels, just sheer black stockings and a dash of Chanel N. 5, 
R08  90 and that would do very nicely indeed. Venice looked at her wardrobe 
R08  91 for a moment, with a faint look of longing, running her hand for a 
R08  92 brief forbidden minute along the collection of silks and satins and 
R08  93 rich organza. It was only for a minute. She turned back to her 
R08  94 reflection, thinking that perhaps she looked rather young and slim 
R08  95 and fine, and anyway, some things were more important than 
R08  96 clothes.<p/>
R08  97 <p_>Nicholas sighed heavily, and put one of his old Ella Fitzgerald 
R08  98 records on, to accompany him while he dressed. It fitted his mood 
R08  99 quite perfectly. He had no heart, everyone knew that. So what was 
R08 100 all this, mooning about like a lovesick adolescent? And why was 
R08 101 there a hole where his stomach used to be, even though he had eaten 
R08 102 a whole lobster for lunch, and two helpings of summer pudding, 
R08 103 every time he thought of Alabama? It was getting too ridiculous. He 
R08 104 was the toughest nut in a street of very hard cases, he was the man 
R08 105 who dared people to sue, he was the man who could make and break 
R08 106 reputations and marriages, so what was the matter with him? He 
R08 107 sighed again, and slapped on some of his best aftershave, with a 
R08 108 vain attempt at carelessness. He looked at his collection of suits, 
R08 109 said by some to be the most extensive in London, although he felt 
R08 110 that Sergei might have the edge on him, and wondered which he 
R08 111 should wear for maximum effect. The pun-stripes were too formal, 
R08 112 the cream linen too cricket, the Anthony Price too reminiscent of a 
R08 113 television personality. After some deliberation, he chose a double 
R08 114 breasted Prince of Wales check which he had always been fond of. 
R08 115 That should do, not too sharp, yet modern, with a hint of witty 
R08 116 nostalgia that was so essential these days. Perfect. He brushed his 
R08 117 hair, and shot his cuffs, and fitted his cigarettes into a silver 
R08 118 cigarette case, and told himself for the sixty-fourth time not to 
R08 119 be so ridiculous.<p/>
R08 120 <p_>Milo worked on his book until late. He only needed five minutes 
R08 121 to get ready anyway. He put his head under the tap, and then pulled 
R08 122 on a pair of jeans and a white shirt and had done with it. He was 
R08 123 fond of Oliver, in a wry kind of way, but not that fond. Besides, 
R08 124 there was little point in dressing up. This was Alabama's night. He 
R08 125 didn't want to steal any thunder at all.<p/>
R08 126 <p_>Scattered across London, his literary friends were putting on 
R08 127 much the same uniform. Most of them looked like Montgomery Clift 
R08 128 anyway, so they didn't need any more adornment. That was why they 
R08 129 had been invited, if only they knew it. As it was, they were 
R08 130 looking forward to a good evening. Oliver's parties were famous, 
R08 131 and the Skye sisters were fast becoming legendary, and there was 
R08 132 bound to be an extraordinary amount of material for their next 
R08 133 books.<p/>
R08 134 <p_>Above an off-licence in the King's Road, Sebastian paused in 
R08 135 front of the glass to accompany Eric Clapton in a particularly 
R08 136 gruelling guitar riff. The least one could do for a sound like that 
R08 137 was give it a little respect. Sebastian bowed extravagantly to an 
R08 138 imaginary audience. Too kind, he thought. What a great crowd you 
R08 139 are. Really, it was nothing. He wondered if he should dress up for 
R08 140 this party. King of the social circuit in Oxford, Sebastian had 
R08 141 never been to a really sophisticated London party before. All his 
R08 142 parents' friends were serious financial wizards who occasionally 
R08 143 gave drinks parties on Sunday mornings, and his own friends were 
R08 144 still bringing bottles. What did really sophisticated London party 
R08 145 goers wear? Should he dress up, or down? He didn't quite dare ring 
R08 146 Venice to ask her. He would have to improvise. After some thought, 
R08 147 a tin of Miller Lite, and a couple more guitar solos which sent the 
R08 148 audience wild, he decided on a pair of red trousers belonging to 
R08 149 some obscure military regiment, the 54th dragoons or some such, 
R08 150 which Sebastian was particularly fond of since they were the only 
R08 151 item of clothing he had ever bought in a street market, a white 
R08 152 evening shirt with stick ups, and his leather jacket. This 
R08 153 ensemble, he felt, rather cunningly mixed elements of smartness, 
R08 154 street credibility, and wit. Anyway, it would have to do.<p/>
R08 155 <p_>Max grunted crossly to himself, and wondered again why he had 
R08 156 accepted Oliver's invitation. Curiosity, and ambition, he supposed. 
R08 157 Besides, he hadn't been to a good party for quite a fortnight, and 
R08 158 he rather missed it. How was he going to impress Dent Ludlow? 
R08 159 Should he go for a raw Brando look that Alabama had preferred, or 
R08 160 the smooth sophisticate that impressed the glamorous women? Perhaps 
R08 161 he should simply capitalize on his dark looks. That would do. He 
R08 162 pulled on some black trousers and a black shirt and slicked his 
R08 163 hair back with the Brylcream that had so suddenly come back into 
R08 164 fashion after twenty years of obsolescence. Everyone would keep 
R08 165 saying that black was out, but it suited Max, and he was damned if 
R08 166 he was going to be a slave of fashion. He looked cool in black, he 
R08 167 looked dangerous and <}_><-|>langorous <+|>languorous<}/> and 
R08 168 fierce. He wondered if the leather jacket might be overdoing it. He 
R08 169 decided it was rather, so he compromised with a pair of suede boots 
R08 170 instead. That way, he could at least step on a few toes, if all 
R08 171 else failed.<p/>
R08 172 <p_>Sergei dressed as he dressed for everything, with care and 
R08 173 thought and just the right amount of concentration. He put on a 
R08 174 dark grey suit, and a cream shirt and a blue tie. Everything was 
R08 175 beautifully laundered and pressed, and laid out lovingly by his 
R08 176 man. As usual, he looked immaculate. He looked like what he was, 
R08 177 rich, pampered, tasteful. Of course, being Sergei, he didn't think 
R08 178 that. He was too busy wondering quite what the evening had in 
R08 179 store, and whether his fiendish plan was going to work. He couldn't 
R08 180 help a sneaking desire that it would backfire, and a nasty young 
R08 181 actor would run off with a bimbo, or just not turn up. He couldn't 
R08 182 help feeling that Alabama was worth rather more. He gave himself 
R08 183 the usual cursory glance in the glass, simply to make sure that 
R08 184 everything was quite as it should be.

R09   3 <p_><quote_>"Hamish's firm was overseeing the adoption. He sought

R09   5 was different in those days. He had ideals, he was so kind and so 
R09   6 good-looking, I was sure I could grow to love him. Anyway I'd

R09   8 <p_><quote_>"No wonder Biddy looked so sour at the

R09  10 I was a little orgy bastard? No wonder she loathes me. What chance 
R09  11 did I ever have? Hamish took me on because he had the temporary

R09  14 Daisy. <quote_>"I love you more than anything in the world. Please

R09  16 magazines, she fell towards Perdita, holding out her arms, frantic 
R09  17 to comfort and be comforted. But Perdita, who'd always detested 
R09  18 physical contact, shoved her away.<p/>
R09  19 <p_><quote_>"Don't touch me, you disgusting slag. All those men in

R09  31 <h|>13
R09  32 <p_>For such a solitary and reserved introvert as Ricky France-Lynch 
R09  33 prison was slightly less crucifying than it might have been 
R09  34 because it made him feel in some infinitesimal way that he was 
R09  35 atoning for the terrific wrongs he had done Chessie. Not only had 
R09  36 he killed her child, but he was convinced she'd never intended to 
R09  37 stay with Bart and could now only be miserable living with such a 
R09  38 monster.<p/>
R09  39 <p_>Even while recovering from horrific operations on his right 
R09  40 elbow in the prison hospital, he wrote her endless letters with his 
R09  41 left hand, begging, in a rare dropping of his guard, for her 
R09  42 forgiveness and her return. Chessie answered none.<p/>
R09  43 <p_>The one glimmer of cheer was that Herbert, his father, felt so 
R09  44 sorry for Ricky that he changed his will yet again, leaving 
R09  45 everything to Ricky instead of the local hunt, who were absolutely 
R09  46 furious, which at least meant the bank came sweet and Ricky could 
R09  47 turn his ponies out instead of selling them.<p/>
R09  48 <p_>After the relative freedom of being on remand, where he could 
R09  49 wear his own clothes, have visitors and go for walks outside, his 
R09  50 worst time inside was the month after his conviction when for 
R09  51 twenty-two hours a day with lights out at six, he was 'banged up' 
R09  52 in a tiny cell in Rutminster Prison, with a burglar, a murderer and 
R09  53 a GBH case.<p/>
R09  54 <p_>He was next moved to Greenwood, an open prison on the Rutshire 
R09  55 - Wiltshire border. The drive, with the sun warming the bare trees 
R09  56 and snowy fields sparkling against a delphinium-blue sky, was 
R09  57 tantalizingly beautiful. Near the prison was a large Elizabethan 
R09  58 manor house with ramparts of yew overlooking a great frozen lake, 
R09  59 which belonged to some cousins Herbert had fought with. What would 
R09  60 they think, wondered Ricky, if he climbed over the wall and dropped 
R09  61 in on them for tea?<p/>
R09  62 <p_>The prison governor was a raging snob.<p/>
R09  63 <p_><quote_>"We've got six millionaires, four old Etonians, three 
R09  64 Radleans, two solicitors, an archdeacon and a rock star, the lead 
R09  65 singer of Apocalypse, in at the moment,"<quote/> he told Ricky, 
R09  66 <quote_>"so you're pretty small fry. The rock star gets so much fan 
R09  67 mail, he ought to be sewing his own mail bags. Sorry about your 
R09  68 arm, had business. We'll find you something not too taxing to do, 
R09  69 the library or the art department or a bit of gardening. I'm a 
R09  70 racing man myself, but evidently the Scrubs has got a table 
R09  71 completely set aside for polo players. Never knew there were so 
R09  72 many bad hats in the game."<quote/><p/>
R09  73 <p_>Queueing up for lunch, Ricky felt sick. He dreaded having to 
R09  74 adjust to a new set of people. He'd grown fond of his three 
R09  75 previous cellmates, who'd been very tolerant, when, impossibly run 
R09  76 down, he had kept them awake with his incessant coughing or his 
R09  77 screaming nightmares.<p/>
R09  78 <p_>Nor had he ever been intimidated at Rutminster. Just behind him 
R09  79 in the queue on his first day, however, was a fat little man with 
R09  80 strands of dyed black hair oiled across his bald patch and a puffy 
R09  81 complexion like marshmallow. Flanked by four huge minions, he was 
R09  82 making a lot of noise. Irritated that Ricky was ignoring him, he 
R09  83 poked him in the ribs.<p/>
R09  84 <p_><quote_>Howdya get that?"<quote/> He pointed at Ricky's elbow. 
R09  85 <quote_>"Is that sling 'olding up a limp wrist, or did we 'urt it 
R09  86 raising our glass once too often to our mouth? Drunk driving wasn't 
R09  87 it? I 'ear we plays polo wiv Prince Charles."<quote/><p/>
R09  88 <p_>Ricky said nothing and, deciding against dishcloth-grey 
R09  89 mutton and flooded yellow cabbage, helped himself to mashed 
R09  90 potato.<p/>
R09  91 <p_><quote_>"Off our nosh, are we?"<quote/> went on the fat little 
R09  92 man, drawing so close that Ricky could smell breath like too sweet 
R09  93 cider. <quote_>"Ay suppose we're used to creamed potatoes at Buck 
R09  94 House. Won't be playin' polo for a bit, will we? WILL WE?"<quote/> 
R09  95 his voice rose threateningly.<p/>
R09  96 <p_>For a second Ricky considered ramming the plate of mashed 
R09  97 potato in his face. Instead he said, <quote_>"Why don't you piss 
R09  98 off?"<quote/><p/>
R09  99 <p_><quote_>"Piss orf,"<quote/> mimicked his tormentor, turning to 
R09 100 his four huge minions who shook, with sycophantic laughter. 
R09 101 <quote_>"Oh, we are on 'ooray 'enry, aren't we? Did we pick up that 
R09 102 posh accent from Prince Charles? We better learn some 
R09 103 manners."<quote/> And mindful of his beefy entourage, he punched 
R09 104 Ricky in the kidneys.<p/>
R09 105 <p_>Not for nothing did Ricky have the fastest reflexes in polo. He 
R09 106 was also instinctively left-handed. Next minute a left hook had 
R09 107 sunk into the fat man's marshmallow jaw and sent him flying across 
R09 108 the canteen crashing to the ground. Strolling across the room, 
R09 109 Ricky hauled him to his feet and smashed him against the wall.<p/>
R09 110 <p_><quote_>"Don't ever speak to me like that again,"<quote/> he 
R09 111 said softly, <quote_>"or I'll really hurt you,"<quote/> and dropped 
R09 112 him back on the floor.<p/>
R09 113 <p_>There was a stunned silence. Not a screw nor a minder moved.<p/>
R09 114 <p_><quote_>"More of an 'ooray 'enry Cooper,"<quote/> drawled a 
R09 115 camp cockney voice.<p/>
R09 116 <p_>Everyone cracked up and bellowed with approval as the fat 
R09 117 little man struggled to his feet and shuffled out, threatening 
R09 118 vengeance.<p/>
R09 119 <p_><quote_>"Dancer Maitland"<quote/>, the owner of the camp 
R09 120 cockney voice, held out a long, pale hand to Ricky. 
R09 121 <quote_>"Welcome to Greenwood."<quote/><p/>
R09 122 <p_>Ricky knew nothing of the music business, but the tousled mane 
R09 123 of streaked shoulder-length hair, darkening at the roots scraped 
R09 124 back into a pony tail, and the heavily kohled, hypnotically 
R09 125 decadent, frost-grey eyes hidden behind dark glasses told him at 
R09 126 once that this must be the rock star of whom the governor had 
R09 127 boasted.<p/>
R09 128 <p_>Thin to the point of emaciation, in jeans and a black jersey, 
R09 129 Dancer had a long mournful clown's face, a pointed chin and a big 
R09 130 pale mouth like a lifebelt. Intensely theatrical, giving off a 
R09 131 suggestion of tragi-comic heights, he moved with feet turned out 
R09 132 and pelvis thrust forward with the fluid grace of a ballet dancer. 
R09 133 Gathering up Ricky's plate of cooling mashed potato, he bore it off 
R09 134 to a far table and, sitting down, patted the seat beside him. 
R09 135 Unwilling to be charmed, Ricky sat opposite.<p/>
R09 136 <p_><quote_>"'Ooray 'enry, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray. The 'ole prison will 
R09 137 put up a plaque to you for flooring that fat queen."<quote/><p/>
R09 138 <p_><quote_>"Who is he?"<quote/><p/>
R09 139 <p_><quote_>"You didn't know? Marmaduke Kempton. That's not his 
R09 140 real name. Bent property developer. Terrorized the East End. In 
R09 141 'ere he's a tobacco baron, known as the Duke, carrying on his reign 
R09 142 of terror. Most powerful guy in the nick, or he was till you 
R09 143 floored him. Now eat up your spuds,"<quote/> went on Dancer 
R09 144 reprovingly, <quote_>"although your strength doesn't seem to need 
R09 145 keeping up. The food's atrocious in 'ere, but I've got a pet screw 
R09 146 who smuggles fings in for me."<quote/><p/>
R09 147 <p_>Gazing at the night-black glasses, Ricky said nothing.<p/>
R09 148 <p_><quote_>"We've got Judge Bondage-Smith in common,"<quote/> 
R09 149 drawled Dancer. Ricky looked blank.<p/>
R09 150 <p_><quote_>"He sent me down too - month before you. Made the 
R09 151 same crack about living in the fast lane, 'Who are Apocalypse' 
R09 152 indeed?"<quote/> Dancer peered over his glasses, imitating the 
R09 153 Judge. <quote_>"Fucking 'ell, you'd have thought everyone 'ad 'eard 
R09 154 of us."<quote/><p/>
R09 155 <p_><quote_>"I hadn't,"<quote/> confessed Ricky, straightening a 
R09 156 prong of his fork.<p/>
R09 157 <p_>Dancer grinned. His mouth, with its exquisitely capped teeth, 
R09 158 seemed to light up his sad clown's face like a semicircle of 
R09 159 moon.<p/>
R09 160 <p_><quote_>"You're better looking than Bondage-Smith, so I'll 
R09 161 forgive you. We're in the same dormitory by the way. Very Enid 
R09 162 Blyton - I didn't bag you a bed by the window. The draught'd have 
R09 163 given you earache."<quote/> Then, seeing the wary expression on 
R09 164 Ricky's face, <quote_>"I know you're dyin' to know what I was 
R09 165 brought in for, but it ain't that. Sex offenders and long-term 
R09 166 murderers are all tucked away in another dorm, stockbrokers and 
R09 167 accountants in the next."<quote/><p/>
R09 168 <p_>Encouraged by the slight lift at the corner of Ricky's mouth, 
R09 169 Dancer went on. <quote_>"I was busted smuggling cocaine and heroin 
R09 170 into England. Shame really. I'd gone cold turkey six months before; 
R09 171 gone through all the screaming heeby-jeebies of coming off. I was 
R09 172 just bringing in the stuff for a friend."<quote/><p/>
R09 173 <p_><quote_>"What's it like in here?"<quote/> Ricky removed a long, 
R09 174 dark hair from his potato and put down his fork.<p/>
R09 175 <p_><quote_>"Triffic contacts,"<quote/> said Dancer. <quote_>"My 
R09 176 shares have rocketed. An' the screws'll do anything for a bit of 
R09 177 dosh. You won't have any 'assle with the inmates now you've taken 
R09 178 out the Duke. The Padre's a bugger, literally. Loves converting 
R09 179 straight blokes, so keep your ass superglued to the wall when he's 
R09 180 around."<quote/><p/>
R09 181 <p_><quote_>"You don't seem to eat much either,"<quote/> said 
R09 182 Ricky, looking at Dancer's congealing mutton.<p/>
R09 183 <p_><quote_>"I'm so anorexic I have midnight fasts,"<quote/> said 
R09 184 Dancer.<p/>
R09 185 <p_><quote_>"Have you - er - had lots of hits in the top 
R09 186 twenty?"<quote/><p/>
R09 187 <p_><quote_>"Five number ones, the last one for twelve weeks, and 
R09 188 fourteen weeks in the States,"<quote/> sighed Dancer, shaking his 
R09 189 head. <quote_>"Who are Apocalypse? indeed. My solicitor's comin' in 
R09 190 'ere for a stretch next week. No wonder I didn't get 
R09 191 off."<quote/><p/>
R09 192 <p_>Dancer saved Ricky's sanity. He made him laugh and later he 
R09 193 made him talk about polo, and slowly about Chessie, but never about 
R09 194 Will. In return Dancer was incredibly frank about his own sexuality 
R09 195 and the problems of a deprived childhood, followed by fame and 
R09 196 colossal riches too early.<p/>
R09 197 <p_><quote_>"I was an East End kid. Suddenly we had a break. I was 
R09 198 going everywhere, staying at the best hotels, meeting the best 
R09 199 people, birds throwing themselves at me, smart parties. I got so I 
R09 200 had to be high to go on stage, then I was getting so high on coke, 
R09 201 I started taking heroin to calm me down, and ended up addicted to 
R09 202 that as well.<p/>
R09 203 <p_>"You've gotta talk, Rick. Bottle it up and it comes out in 
R09 204 uvver directions. The night my auntie died, my uncle went straight 
R09 205 up the pub. Two months later, he went off his 'ead, and died of an 
R09 206 'eart attack."<quote/><p/>
R09 207 <p_><quote|>"Thanks," said Ricky.<p/>
R09 208 <p_>Anyone, claimed Evelyn Waugh, who has been to an English public 
R09 209 school, feels comparatively at home in prison. For Ricky it was 
R09 210 better. He'd been bullied at school. Here he was very popular. The 
R09 211 inmates liked him because he didn't show off or drop names or 
R09 212 grumble, and because beneath his aloof, impassive manner, his grief 
R09 213 was almost palpable. Once he started giving racing tips that 
R09 214 worked, even Duke forgave him and started asking him what Prince 
R09 215 Charles was really like, and if he'd ever clapped eyes on Princess 
R09 216 Diana.<p/>
R09 217 <p_>There were terrible moments. He was plagued by feelings of 
R09 218 utter worthlessness. He slept appallingly, still wracked by 
R09 219 insomnia, followed by nightmares. He was consumed with desire for 
R09 220 Chessie. He was crucified by the knowledge that Will's last 
R09 221 terrifying memory must have been Chessie and he screaming at each 
R09 222 other, and being gathered into a car and hurtled to his death.
