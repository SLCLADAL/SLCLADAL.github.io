</[3> <#> Cos apparently they say if you 're pregnant don't mix the waters <,> <{4> <[4> only </[4> drink the north or the south but you don't mix the water from both<S1A-058$A> <#> <[1> Does it work </[1> </{1><S1A-058$A> <#> <[2> That 's so psychological </[2> </{2><S1A-058$A> <#> <[3> Oh right </[3> </{3><S1A-058$X> <#> <[4> Oh </[4> </{4><S1A-058$B> <#> What you mean <,><S1A-058$D> <#>

laughter </&><S1A-058$B> <#> From the north south right you put the water the water at the north pole of the magnet and some <{> <[> water right </[><S1A-058$A> <#> <[> He mixes the </[> </{>

<#> <[> You 've two </[> </{> magnets right <#> Big round things like that <{> <[> okay </[> <,> <#> And you know the way magnets have separate poles<S1A-058$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-058$B> <#> Mm<S1A-058$D> <#> Right so on one magnet you leave it with the north pole up and put the glass on top north pole and the other magnet you leave with the south pole up put the glass to the south pole<S1A-058$B> <#> Mm hmm<S1A-058$D> <#> So you mix the water in the morning <#> This guy took the two waters <,> he 's doing experiments to see of there is a difference like and apparently this is even funnier like it 's not really scientific at all but apparently if you soak bread in north water and then soak bread in south water one goes <&> laughter </&><S1A-058$B> <#> Uh what<S1A-058$D> <#> One goes <&> laughter </&><S1A-058$B> <#> What<S1A-058$D> <#> One goes <&> laughter </&><S1A-058$C> <#> She can't get it out<S1A-058$A> <#> It must be good<S1A-058$D> <#> It goes mouldy

<[> and it went on </[><S1A-058$B> <#> <[> And then I always </[> </{> thought but no well <,> I always thought when she was with him though that it was because she felt sorry for him and because <,> <{> <[> she felt kind of more protected </[><S1A-058$D> <#> <[> No I thought it wasn't </[> </{> from the very beginning that it wasn't that was why<S1A-058$B> <#> Oh when <.> sh </.> when they were

didn't she didn't mean you can't understand love<S1A-058$X> <#> <.> We </.><S1A-058$A> <#> She did <#> She said something like <,> you don't know what it means or <.> some </.> <#> She said

<{> <[> maybe not to analyse it </[> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> this week<S1A-058$D> <#> <[> Ah well </[><S1A-058$B> <#> <[> I always think </[> </{> <,> I always thought she was just feeling

<#> Pretending to fly<S1A-058$B> <#> Yeah well <#> See the shoes <#> <{> <[> They 're like the </[> shoes that Teresa wears <,,> yeah <#> There 's this girl that I was in Germany with <,> she brought
