<S2A-045 Language education><I><S2A-045$A> <#> When I was asked to speak I had a bit of a dilemma because <,> I didn't know exactly whether I should speak in Ulster Scots or in Irish so I decided I 'd speak in English <#> <&> laughter </&> So I 'd like to begin by <,> uh <,> the <,> topic I 've taken is <,> the <,> teacher education for teaching through a target language <#> And I suppose I decided that <,> I would focus <,> situate it in the context of <,> uh <,> general teacher education <,> because in fact <,> for teacher preparation it is a very very uh complex field <#> From my particular experiences that I 've been working in teacher education for <,> thirty-two thirty years which is a long time in different areas <#> I first worked in <,> primary teacher education and then <,> the Irish government took a very intelligent decision and asked me to work in secondary teacher education <#> They closed the college I was working in <,> <&> laughter </&> Carysfort College <#> So that uh <,> over the years I 've been in a lot of schools watching people <,> teaching <,> evaluating their teaching <,> uh seeing how they 're making progress <#> I 've evaluated Irish language teaching <,> geography teaching <,> various things that I knew <,> nothing about but nevertheless that 's the <,> the context of primary teacher education <#> And in fact <,> at the moment uh <,> the whole area of <.> pri </.> of teacher education particularly at primary level <,> it was mentioned earlier today the great shortages of teachers at primary level <#> And you have a kind of a crisis management situation <#> In <,> the British Isles and in the Republic we have <,> new forms of teacher education where we have graduates being converted <,> in a very hurried way into being primary teachers in short courses et-cetera so that uh <,> there is there are difficulties generally with teacher education <#> And there 's quite a lot of <,> work going on in attempts to reform the programmes <#> But <,> what we 're all <,> I suppose <,> I will speak about the various approaches <,> which uh <,> in different ways are <,> available in the area <#> You first of all have the old approach the <,> they used to call it sitting with Nellie <,> where somebody sat in the back of a class and observed what was happening and <,> became an apprentice to a teacher <#> It 's a it 's a craft model which <,> in fact is gaining a certain amount of prominence <,> particularly in Britain <,> more partnership between the schools and the universities and the colleges of education <#> In fact uh in many cases this can become very excessive <,> especially if it becomes very bureaucratised <#> The next one is the <.> const </.> competencies model <,> where you say <,> well these are the things we want teachers to be able to do <#> And again this is a fairly limited approach <#> Uh the reflective practitioner <,> as Hitler said when I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver <,> when I hear the word reflective practitioner sometimes <,> I want to know what people are at <&> laughter </&> <#> Uh basically <,> we 're supposed to reflect on our own <,> performance <,> and thereby <,> after many hours of meditation come up with <,> uh improvement <#> But again it 's very much part of nursing education <,> teacher education <,> you reflect <,> you keep a diary <,> you improve and it does help at times <#> And then you have the technical rationalists <,> applied science <,> approach <,> which is the one really that <,> in a way is the ideal that people would study <#> Whatever they think about educational psychology <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> pupils <,> they will study <,> approaches to <,> language teaching <,> the basics of linguistics et-cetera <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> language teachers <#> They would in a sense bring a scientific approach <,> to what is an art <#> You have the art of teaching and you have the science of teaching <#> Now <,> people like <,> uhm fairer teacher trainers or teacher educators have to <,> pay attention to both <,> not just one <#> Now <,> within the Republic <,> and I suppose in many other places <,> we have <,> uh different forms of preparation for different levels <#> The <.> prep </.> and <,> I suppose we have to make a distinction between training and education <#> It 's a very critical distinction <#> Uh training teachers is one thing <#> It 's very much <,> a bag of tricks <#> They 're able to perform <#> They 're able to manage a class <#> They 're able to <,> to but educating teachers is quite a different <#> And I often feel that <,,> when I was <,> uh growing up <,> we had a name for a teacher <,> we called him the Master <#> Now he wasn't a just a master for nothing <#> He was a master because he was an educated person <,> who had a lot of knowledge and who he was a leader in his community <#> Now in many cases that 's not happening now <#> Uh again <,> training for bilingual teaching or teaching through the target language <,> it is a very complex issue because you have students <,> who are <,> as was mentioned this morning <,> at various levels <,> of development in the language which they 're inclined to be <#> You have the native speakers in your class and you have people who are coming from homes where English is the language <,> and you have people of different levels of intelligence <#> So it 's not an easy task <#> Uh the varieties of learners and learner contexts <#> Now <,> within <,> the organisations which prepare teachers you have the institutional frameworks <,> the colleges of education <,> universities <,> the B-Eds programme <,> three-year programmes <,> sometimes four years <,> PCGE <,> H-Dips <#> And then you have <,> different language teaching institutions and then you have voluntary bodies who prepare <#> Another important aspects of preparing for language teaching is the ongoing <,> in-career or in-service <,> professional development of teachers and this can take place <,> uh <,> through the State <#> The <.> Re </.> the State in the Republic is very remiss <#> In fact have recently <,> uh withdrawn some monies that were supposed to be provided for in-service education <#> And it 's a vital area in the ongoing professional development of teachers <,> whether they be language teachers or history teachers or whatever <#> And then <,> quite uh effective in many cases with regard to <,> modern languages as well as with regard to minority languages are the professional subject organisations <#> We have for instance <&Irish> Comhar na Mu/inteoiri/ Gaeilge </&Irish> <,> the Irish Language Teachers ' Organisation which has a major publication <&Irish> Teagasc na Gaeilge </&Irish> and is a very valuable contributor if only it would have enough members <#> If only the gospel <,> went to a lot of people <#> Now I 'd also argue indeed professional preparation of teachers <,> of language that <,> the whole area of applied linguistics <,> has a vital <,> uh role and <,> as was mentioned earlier this morning <,> there is need for ongoing research <#> Very few of us know what is actually happening in the language classes <,> whether it 's modern language classes <,> the Irish language <#> There is very little observation data available <,> through research <#> There 's uh also action research as I say <#> Teachers working <,> I had a student recently who did a <,> very nice action research uh piece of work on <,> using the concept of multiple intelligences for the teaching of Irish in a disadvantaged area in Dublin <#> And it was most interesting to see how she set out her her research proposal <#> Now like any profession <,> quality <,> how do we achieve quality <#> We were speaking this morning about a shortage <#> We were talking about standards versus people actually being there <#> Uh <,> there is a shortage of Irish language teachers <,> in the Republic particularly at second level <#> It 's one of the areas <,> I know that in our department we 're allowed a quota <#> I think it 's fifteen <,,> <#> Now we could manage forty-five <,> but the State has a limit on the number of people that can actually train <,> in particular areas of the university <#> Within the <,,> teacher training colleges as we used to call them or colleges of education <,> access <,> up to a number of years ago <,> was in a sense <,> both on the basis on exam results and on an interview <#> For financial reasons the interview was abolished with the result that there <,> there is very little control <,,> really of the access <#> It 's purely on the basis of how many As or Bs or whatever you get <#> Personality and other factors which are very important in teaching are not taken into <,> account <#> So that within that process you have the initiation of people <,> the qualification <,> and then the actual specialisation as they go through the profession <#> Various forms of <,> mentoring are being introduced <,> which are highly significant <,> induction programmes <,> and then at primary level the State oversees the first year teaching and register teachers <,> or doesn't register teachers depending on their <#> Now with regard to <,> three basic requirements <,> for anybody hoping to teach through the target language <,> a high degree of confidence in the <.> car </.> in the target language <#> That will usually be achieved <,> through the language departments <,> either French <,> German <,> Irish or whatever or <,> with <,> people who have native speaker confidence <,> uh <&Irish> o/ dhu/chas </&Irish> <,> from birth <,,> <#> Now within the concurrent <,> teacher preparation programmes <,> everybody that 's in the Republic and wants to be a teacher has to <,> uh attend <,> quite a significant number of programmes <,> which would give them a certain competence <,> but <,> motivation is low among the <,> in many cases <#> And sometimes <,> a professional programme which is a short type of programme doesn't give the confidence <,> which would be adequate to teach through Irish in a <,> in a <,> an all-Irish school for instance <#> And another factor that uh <,> I suppose in many cases in teacher training militates against <,> uh <,> quality is the fact that the academic department <,> in a university or in a college of education <,> has a much higher status <,> than the methodology area <#> I think that would be granted <,> and research has shown <#> And that has an effect <,> on the the ways people give <.> a </.> attention to methodology <#> Now one thing that 's coming through in the research throughout Europe is that <,> the actual classroom skills <,> in using the target language <,> are essential <,> and that we don't pay enough attention to that area <#> Now <,> uh <,> a high degree of confidence in classroom skills and in language teaching methodology that is an absolute <&Latin> sine qua non </&Latin> in teaching through the target language <,,> <#> And uh <,> the reality on the ground is that <,> it is difficult <,> to find enough people who have the combination <,> a good subject qualification <,> particularly at second level <#> To find a combination of somebody who 's highly competent and proficient in the language and also has a good subject qualification let 's say in geography or in history or in science <#> And then <,> there is a certain dearth <,> particularly in scientific subjects <,> of texts <,> which are not just translations <,> let 's say in the sciences <#> I was talking recently to a headmaster in an all-Irish school <,> biology <,> physics et-cetera <,,> great difficulty in that sense finding textbooks <,> that are adequate <,,> <#> Now <,> there 're courses throughout the European Union which are dedicated to preparing <,> people for teaching through the target language <,> whether they 're teaching English in <,> Holland or <,,> German in France or whatever <#> Uhm <,> okay another point I want to mention is the <,> significance of placement <#> Sometimes we forget <,> that this <,> idea of placing <,> probationary teachers <,> trainee teachers <,> in schools <,> and the types of schools in which we place them <,> and the degree of care which is necessary uh <,,> to take with students make <,> sure that they 're placed <,> where they get support et-cetera <,> is quite important <#> Now part of <,> training for teaching through the target language is <,> let 's say <,> dealing with <,> uhm materials development <,> adaptation et-cetera so that <,> the actual people who have come through courses will be able to involve themselves in curriculum development development of materials <#> There is other things motivation techniques <#> Uhm <,> what else have I down there <#> Uh use let 's say of <,> all the modern <,> technological resources which are available <,> the video <,> interactive video <,> internet et-cetera which are becoming available and which in many cases are being used but <,> not very frequently <#> Now <,,> just to go back to where I started <#> What is <,> or what constitutes teaching through the target language <#> And I 'm going to <,> put an overhead shortly <#> And I think I 'll get a bit of grace <#> Uhm <,> what is teaching through the target language <#> Uh I have that here on <,> let 's say a recent publication which comes from <,,> the university of some place I can't pronounce in Finland</I>
