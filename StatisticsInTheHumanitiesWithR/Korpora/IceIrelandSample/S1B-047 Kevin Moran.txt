<S1B-047 Kevin Moran><I><S1B-047$A> <#> A household name in <,> in Ireland he starred with the Dubs in the seventy-six All-Ireland Final in their win over old rivals Kerry <#> A couple of years later <,> sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United <#> Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland <,> but sixteen years on and after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad and today Kevin Moran is our guest in the studio <#> Well are you ready for a grilling for an hour you are<S1B-047$B> <#> Looking forward to it Des<S1B-047$A> <#> The uh <,> the move to Manchester United were you worried that it might be a mistake at the time because you were <,> you were you were finished college weren't you and you<S1B-047$B> <#> I was yeah <#> Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over but I just said to myself <,> I 've got to give it a try <#> And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end <#> In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it <#> But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it <#> Just play one game <#> I always remember saying that to people <#> All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah <#> And career-wise it was shaping up well for you then<S1B-047$B> <#> Exactly <#> You know I just I was in Oliver Freeney at the time <#> Do you know there was a good accountancy career ahead of me <#> The Dubs were actually going so well at the time and I 'd no real interest <#> You know I think when I was about seventeen years of age eighteen och that 's <,> that 's when I wanted to go away to Manchester United<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-047$B> <#> But at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less<S1B-047$A> <#> But you know when you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever <#> Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two<S1B-047$B> <#> Uhm I was a little bit bigger than all the others there <&> laughs </&><S1B-047$A> <#> Well were you treated the same as them<S1B-047$B> <#> I was <#> I was treated the same as them <#> Yeah and that <#> And uhm<S1B-047$A> <#> That must have been strange<S1B-047$B> <#> Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it <#> So I said I 'll tell you what <,> you 've got two or three days <#> And the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days <&> laughs </&> <#> So that helped enormously and then after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract <#> <{> <[> And </[><S1B-047$A> <#> <[> What did </[> </{> you do for the two or three <,> just train with them or <{> <[> did you play a match </[><S1B-047$B> <#> <[> No there was a game </[> </{> <#> They 'd organised a game against a university team and uhm I 'd played quite well in it I thought <#> We we beat them I think six-nil or something like that<S1B-047$A> <#> And which team was it <#> The first team or <{> <[> the reserves </[><S1B-047$B> <#> <[> No no </[> </{> this was like uhm <{1> <[1> uh an A team </[1> <#> Over there they 've got an A team like a third team <#> <{2> <[2> Yeah </[2><S1B-047$A> <#> <[1> A youth team </[1> </{1><S1B-047$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1B-047$B> <#> There 'd be a <.> f </.> maybe a few reserve team players in it as well plus youth team players <#> So it was kind of like a very young team and that but very <.> sk </.> <,> I always remember the skill factor in them was <,> amazed me you know because I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were<S1B-047$A> <#> And how many of those other fellas made it<S1B-047$B> <#> Oh <,> you 'd be lucky if you 're talking about one <,> two<S1B-047$A> <#> So probably only you from that team<S1B-047$B> <#> <&> laughs </&> I 'd probably have been the least likely one as well if you were watching that particular game<S1B-047$A> <#> Mm <#> So you came back over and it was kind of a secret at first wasn't it about you<S1B-047$B> <#> It was because when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it <#> I just wanted to go over <,> take in the trial for two or three days <,> come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start <,> continue playing with Dublin and nobody 'd know anything about it <#> I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know<S1B-047$A> <#> You hadn't been there no<S1B-047$B> <#> What people forget is that the great late Billy Behan <,> it was his word really that got me over there<S1B-047$A> <#> Mm<S1B-047$B> <#> You know <#> And his word was that well respected by Manchester United<S1B-047$A> <#> Just to explain to people he was the Irish scout who <{> <[> had sent over </[> all the Irish players in those years<S1B-047$B> <#> <[> That 's right </[> </{><S1B-047$B> <#> That 's right sent over all those Irish players then at the time <#> And I remember uhm it was based on his word really that I think Dave Sexton turned around and went <,> that 'll do he 'll do for us<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah <#> Now <,> you you didn't have that long with the Dubs really sure you didn't <#> <{> <[> You 'd </[> only two or three years<S1B-047$B> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1B-047$B> <#> I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you <#> Uhm but actually when I look back on it it 's only like two or three years really<S1B-047$A> <#> And when you go around Ireland <,> rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career<S1B-047$B> <#> Yeah but not only rural Ireland very much Dublin as well <#> Like uh I 'd I 'd still get more people nearly coming up to me talking about the Dubs and when am I going to come back for the Dubs<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-047$B> <#> Because I think I always wanted to come back for the Dubs <#> I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm but as you say they just uh the soccer career went on and on <&> laughs </&><S1B-047$A> <#> Well we we 've a couple of fellas on the line now to remind you of those uh you 'll need your headphones maybe to hear them <#> Uh uhm we 've Mike Sheehy on the line from Kerry<S1B-047$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-047$A> <#> And who 's a big soccer fan as well <#> Hello Mike<S1B-047$C> <#> Hello Des<S1B-047$A> <#> How are you<S1B-047$C> <#> How are you doing<S1B-047$A> <#> Not bad <#> Now those days uh Moran coming into the team when you were All-Ireland champions <#> You wouldn't have known a lot about him sure you wouldn't<S1B-047$C> <#> No Des <&> laughs </&> <#> Not initially anyway but <,> I I I remember actually seeing him uh in Tralee sometime <#> He played a played a challenge game with Dublin against Kerry in Tralee sometime I 'd say <,> early seventy-six probably you know and I remember I was resting <#> I said I was injured but <&> all laugh </&> we usually took breaks in those days during the winter <#> But I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park <#> I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September <{> <[> and a few </[> other years you know<S1B-047$A> <#> <[> That 's right </[> </{><S1B-047$A> <#> Was that your first ever game for the Dubs<S1B-047$B> <#> That was yeah <#> It was uhm <{> <[> I can remember I think it was to raise </[><S1B-047$C> <#> <[> Hi Kevin </[> </{><S1B-047$B> <#> Hi Mikey <#> How are you doing <#> Nice to talk to you<S1B-047$C> <#> Good good good <#> Same here<S1B-047$B> <#> It was uhm it was to raise funds I think for uh Kerry to go to uh America <&> laughter </&> <{> <[> <#> I was delighted </[> to do that for youse by the way help youse out in some way <#> I can always say there I did something good for Kerry in seventy-six<S1B-047$A> <#> <[> Ah cute Kerrymen </[> </{><S1B-047$A> <#> Was it Jim said <,> your brother I can't <,> I think it was Jim said uh after that that he was glad he went to the bother of going down to watch you cos the way you played he thought you 'd never play for them again<S1B-047$B> <#> That 's right <#> It was me brother Brendan actually said<S1B-047$A> <#> Was it Brendan yeah<S1B-047$B> <#> He said it was the first and only time he thought he 'd ever see me in a blue shirt<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-047$B> <#> But uh I remember that now <#> I played mid-field I think<S1B-047$C> <#> That 's right yeah <#> <{> <[> That 's right </[> <#> Covering every blade of grass<S1B-047$B> <#> <[> And uhm </[> </{><S1B-047$B> <#> That <,> I know because I couldn't catch balls then <#> I had to run around the place you see <#> I I I <,> fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break<S1B-047$C> <#> Yeah that 's right that 's right<S1B-047$B> <#> So the least I could have done was to run around the place<S1B-047$A> <#> Well one man who never had the fitness problems was Jimmy Keaveney <,> <#> Hello Jimmy<S1B-047$D> <#> How are you Des<S1B-047$A> <#> How are you<S1B-047$D> <#> Not too bad<S1B-047$B> <#> Is that Jimmy<S1B-047$A> <#> Are you not working <,> are you not<S1B-047$D> <#> Jeez you 'd do anything for a few bob Mose <#> Do you know that<S1B-047$A> <#> Listen tell us this about uh when this long-haired fella arrived out to training first <#> None of you knew knew him well Jimmy<S1B-047$D> <#> No he arrived up to Parnell Park he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time <#> And he 'd an old donkey jacket on him <,> a Honda fifty and he 'd <,> the arse was out of his trousers <#> Things have changed haven't they<S1B-047$B> <#> I 'll tell you one thing <#> I hate <,> <#> It was never a Honda fifty by the by the way <#> It was a Honda ninety <&> laughter </&><S1B-047$D> <#> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> You wouldn't know how to get onto onto one of them now <&> laughter </&><S1B-047$A> <#> And you were a fairly close-knit team though Jimmy weren't you <#> I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team<S1B-047$D> <#> No <,> one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage <,> and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him <#> He got straight stuck into into the training <#> And like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen <,> Hanahoe <,> and myself to get on with the training and like he at this stage he 's not with the team a wet day <#> But I think it 's something we all appreciated <#> He was like a breath of fresh air coming into the team<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah <#> And and uh the Dublin Kerry rivalry <,> Mike 's still on the line there <#> That was uh there was huge hype in in the country in those days wasn't there<S1B-047$C> <#> Well we enjoyed it like we had great craic out of it <#> We enjoyed the games <#> We won some and we lost some <#> But I think at the end of the day it was the friends we made with the Kerry lads <,> and vice versa with them <,> I think that 's the the enjoyment we got <,> we got mostly out of it as players anyway<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah course you might <,> Kerry got the better of it over the over the three or four years <#> There were highs and lows for the Dubs uh <,> Kevin do you remember the the run in seventy-six the famous <{1> <[1> one </[1> which I was making the point recently that never has a miss been uh <.> show </.> reshown so often <#> I mean you missed <{2> <[2> it </[2> but it 's they <{3> <[3> keep reshowing it </[3><S1B-047$B> <#> <[1> That 's right yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-047$B> <#> <[2> I know </[2> </{2><S1B-047$C> <#> <[3> But Des sorry </[3> </{3> but that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match <,> if you hadn't 've drop-kicked that ball<S1B-047$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-047$C> <#> It probably would 've been one of the greatest goals ever seen in Gaelic football <#> If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it but he drop-kicked and he screwed her off a wee bit <#> You know</I>
