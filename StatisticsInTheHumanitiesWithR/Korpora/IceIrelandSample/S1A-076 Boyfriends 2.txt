bus <&> clears throat </&> and went into Cleary 's <#> Now you know Miss Selfridge 's there<S1A-076$B> <#> <[> Thingamajig </[> </{><S1A-076$B> <#> Um<S1A-076$A> <#> So I saw this skirt this suede

apartment everything and going off cheffing in Australia<S1A-076$A> <#> Ah fair play to him <#> He might as well do something of his own <,> you know what I mean rather than being in the pharmacy and you know working in there for the family and stuff<S1A-076$B> <#> And as well he 's kind of obliged to do all sorts of hours <#> <{1> <[1> And </[1> <,> he 's rung up and they 're ringing him at every hand 's turn you know <#> Phoned up the whole time <{2> <[2> and </[2><S1A-076$A> <#> <[1> Right yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-076$A> <#> <[2> Well then </[2> </{2> at that I 'd say like do your own

Yeah<S1A-076$A> <#> That 's her name <#> She went out with Jim okay<S1A-076$B> <#> Right<S1A-076$A> <#> And she is so possessive of him still <#> She like if he 's even talking to another girl now it 's off a good while <,> about a year or so and he like he 's always saying that woman is paranoid <#> She 's a pain in the arse <#> Not a pain in the arse like he does like her but uhm <,> she just gets so paranoid if Jim is talking to another girl or anything you know <#> And <,> even when was it oh Jesus sure do you remember the night last <,> <.> l </.> the two weeks ago when we were out and Michael Kinsella and everything <{> <[> was out <#> Do you <.> re </.> wasn't that great craic </[><S1A-076$B> <#> <[> Yeah yeah <,> <#> Who 's </[> </{> Geoffrey going out with<S1A-076$A> <#> I don't know some girl <#> I don't I 've never seen her <#> I don't know whether he 's interested or anything <#> But the party the next night that I was supposed to go to with Jim <,> in Liam Scanlon 's house<S1A-076$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-076$A> <#> Was meant to be <,> brilliant absolutely fantastic now really really good<S1A-076$B> <#> This is where someone was rushed off to hospital<S1A-076$A> <#> Liam himself and then going on the plane in an hour 's time and had to be chauffeur-driven and all this kind of craic <#> But the party I 'm really sorry I didn't go cos I think myself and Ciaran had a big huge row that night again<S1A-076$B> <#> Again<S1A-076$A> <#> Well not again but ah <,> after this week I mean you could say again like <,> <#> I <{> <[> mean last </[><S1A-076$B> <#> <[> So
