take the text in with you<S1B-016$A> <#> Yeah <#> You bring the text in with you <#> Yeah<S1B-016$?> <#> O'Rahilly gave us handouts like for the rest of the Seafarer <#> Can we bring them

you is <,> get there early <,> get a decent seat in by the wall <#> Okay <#> Fight fight for it if you have to uhm cos I mean that means you won't have anybody on your <,> on your left <,> to try <,> on your right <#> But there will always <,> there will have to be a seat between every person<S1B-016$?> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1B-016$?> <#> <{> <[> Right </[><S1B-016$?> <#> <[> Oh yeah </[> </{><S1B-016$?> <#> <{> <[> How will they fit us </[><S1B-016$?> <#> <[> Will there be room </[> </{><S1B-016$A> <#> We 'll try and fit you <#> Okay <#> So that 's why you need to get there early and get get a decent seat <#> Uhm <,> uh <,> open book <,> you can bring in these texts and you can bring in that workbook and you can bring the handouts I gave you <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-016$C> <#> You know when he asks about <.> Be </.> Beowulf <,> can you like <,> use the other elegies and stuff to <#> It depends on the question<S1B-016$A> <#> It depends on the question <#> I mean if it 's first of all women in Beowulf it probably isn't brilliant <#> Well no actually <,> hm <,,> good point uhm <#> If the question comes up which I don't think it will <,> if women come up <,> you could bring it in <,> you could bring in <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> but just to support it <,> okay<S1B-016$?> <#> Just say like <,> This is in Beowulf but the same thing is in<S1B-016$A> <#> Yeah <#> Or or or uhm <,> also in <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> 's Lament we find we find this which backs up or uhm supports this argument <#> Okay <#> Now the women in Beowulf <,> it 'd be a gift if you got that <,> you 'd be lucky if you got that <,> brilliant <&> laughter </&> <#> And uh <#> Okay what I think <,> what I think you will get is in Middle English <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> is Orpheo and Mallory <,> okay <#> Now the hints she gave out for Orpheo uhm <#> Now if you if you want to go through these tell me <,> okay <#> I I haven't got a watch so somebody tell me when it 's five to three <#> Okay <#> Uhm possible questions for Orpheo <#> The differences between Orpheo as king and Orpheo as wild man <#> Okay <#> What are the differences between them <,> between Orpheo in in those two roles <#> Uh okay <#> The best reply to that <,> the best reply to that kind of question would be actually to question the question <,> if you understand that <,> to turn the question around and say <,> uhm <,> well actually is there any difference between <,> you know <,> is there any difference between Orpheo as a king and Orpheo as wild man <#> And my feeling on there on that is that really there isn't <,> because you can back that up by saying uh he still has power in the natural world <,> he has his harp with him uh which is a symbol of his power and he uses that to <,> to soothe savage beasts <#> Also he uses that in his own kingdom as well <,> uhm that 's what he 's renowned for <,> he 's renowned for playing <,> for his playing of the harp <#> Okay <#> So you can sort of question the question <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> If you get a really narky question you don't want to say <,> oooh now what shall we do <#> So you turn the question around and you answer it in a in a very <,> in a different way <#> Cos I mean <,> I know I mean I 've sixty <,> I 've sixty-seven tutorial people okay <,> uhm say half <,> if half of you do Middle English <,> you know I know that 'll probably not be the case but uhm <,> and if if most of you do this or a similar question to this and you give me the same type of stuff <,> the marks will not be as high <#> Like uhm that 's one thing in the exam in <,> in in June <#> You will get a choice of of Old English and Middle English okay and language and society and do two out of three <#> Uhm now <,> the highest marks go go for questions that are least answered <,> you know <#> Okay <#> So if you see a really weird one <,> you know <,> uhm and you think you can handle it <,> go for it <#> Get higher marks <#> Because they the <,> because those who are correcting it will have nothing to gauge it against <#> You know what I mean <#> If if you have something to gauge it against you go <,> no <,> wasn't as good as that one <,> no <,> yeah <#> You see you 're sort of you 're sort of wondering how good it really is <#> You know <#> So that 's that 's that 's why uh the best marks actually go for languages and society <,> because very few people actually do Dr Farelli 's course and the questions <,> because they are a bit <,> they need a lot of <,> a lot of work <,> they need some sort of <,> you go in <,> you feel good and you can do the question <#> That 's the only way you 're going to be dealing with Dr Farelli 's questions <#> Unless you 're actually preparing for the second part of her of her course <#> That 'll be in February so I 'll talk more about that then <#> Uhm <,> but uhm if there is an internal choice on Thursday <,> go for the one that you think people won't answer <,> then you 'll get a higher mark <#> Okay <#> Uhm uh<S1B-016$B> <#> Unless you totally flop it <&> laughs </&><S1B-016$A> <#> Well no <,> you won't <.> to </.> <,> you won't flop it if you have the book in front of you<S1B-016$B> <#> Oh right<S1B-016$A> <#> Okay <#> Uhm <,> oh yeah <,> I 'm rambling here a bit <#> Quotations <,> okay <,> in the class essay <#> Okay <#> If you if you want to use quotation marks you have to get it directly out of the book <#> Okay <#> You have to get the words directly out of the book <#> The spelling can't be out <#> Okay <#> But if you don't want to use quotation marks you can paraphrase it to your heart 's delight <#> And you can say <,> well uh Orpheo said that <,> you know <,> no quotation marks <,> and that 's it <,> you 're fine <#> You sort of <,> you state what you think he said rather than what he actually did say <,> you know <,> but you don't put it in quotation marks <#> And and and especially in Middle English <,> you don't have to get close to the spelling at all <#> You can paraphrase in modern English <#> And it 's the same it 's the same in the exam <#> Okay <#> Now uhm a second question for Orpheo <,> uhm <,> different locations of court and the fairy kingdom and the three <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> Uhm how are the locations in Orpheo described <#> The location of the court <,> the fairy kingdom <,> and the hovel <#> Okay <,> how are they described <#> Uhm <,> what differences are there <,> what similarities <,> and uhm what does that say about the uhm <,> about each location<S1B-016$?> <#> There 's the court <,> the hovel <,> and what else<S1B-016$A> <#> Uh <,> the fairy kingdom <,> uh the fairy castle <#> Okay <,> uhm now a third one <#> The role of music in Orpheo <#> Okay <#> Very classic one <,> very classic <#> Uhm okay <,> uhm <,> another possible one <,> uh <,> depictions of the hero and the heroine <#> How <,> how is Orpheo <,> how is Orpheo uh portrayed and how is uhm Eurydice portrayed <#> Uhm okay I haven't <#> Can they be described as a hero and a heroine <#> What do you what do you think of their description <#> Do you think the description of Eurydice just according to her basically <,> her her outer looks <,> do you think that 's appropriate to the genre <#> Do you think it 's appropriate to a romance <#> Okay <#> And if you don't <,> you know <,> tell us why <#> It would be very interesting to hear it <#> Okay <#> Uhm <,> you know uh <#> How is suspense built up in the poem and sustained <#> Uh how does the poet how does the poet uh sustain the suspense <#> Uh <,> like okay there are two <,> two different <unclear> several sylls </unclear> uhm when Eurydice had has had her dream <,> or when the fairy <unclear> several sylls </unclear> came to visit her <,> visited her in in her dream <,> uhm <,> when she wakes up she starts tearing her face <#> We don't know why <#> We 're going <,> hello <,> what 's happened <,> okay <#> We don't know until she tells us <#> So there 's suspense <#> We 're waiting along with Orpheo <,> along with everybody else to find out what exactly happened <#> Okay so uhm that 's one example of suspense being uh sustained and sort of uh being there <#> Second one uhm <,> or a second one <,> not the second <,> a another one <,> uhm would be where uhm Orpheo 's playing his harp for the fairy king and uhm after he 's finished the king says to him <,> oh that was <,> man that was brilliant <#> I 'll give you anything in the <,> anything in my kingdom <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and Orpheo says <,> okay <#> I want her <#> And the fairy king says <,> can't <,> this can't happen <#> You 're you 're a minstrel <#> Come on you 're a scumbag <,> you know <#> You 're scum <#> She 's a queen <#> What 's what 's the <,> you can't cross this social class thing <#> Okay you can't cross the <{> <[> social </[> social scale <#> Okay <#> But but uh we 're sort of wondering like will he will he give in <#> Will he actually give uh Orpheo back his wife or not <#> Okay so that 's another bit of suspense there <#> Okay there are a few more areas as well so try and find them before Thursday <#> Okay uhm the form of the poem itself <,> uhm it 's a Breton lai <,> it 's a romance <#> What does this <,> what does this say to you <#> Uhm what do you expect in in this <#> What should you expect <#> And maybe uhm uh <,> does it actually come <,> does the poem actually live up to uh the genre <,> to the form of the poem <,> to what uhm a romance is <#> Okay <#> Now if you get that question I will be deeply disappointed <#> Uhm <#> It 's one of those questions<S1B-016$?> <#> <[> Order </[> </{><S1B-016$C?> <#> Will the question be subdivided <,> <{> <[> will it be </[> <#> No<S1B-016$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{> <#> Don't think so <#> I hope not for your sake <#> Uhm <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-016$C?> <#> What if you haven't a clue of it like<S1B-016$B?> <#> Yeah you could maybe know one part of it like<S1B-016$A> <#> Well yeah <,> well I mean you do that and then half-way <,> but I mean don't spend uh <,> okay if there 's two parts to the question okay and you only do one <,> you only get <,> you only get marked out of fifty</I>
