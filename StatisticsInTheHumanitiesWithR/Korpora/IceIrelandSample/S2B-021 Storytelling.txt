<S2B-021 Storytelling><I><S2B-021$A> <#> I 'm Liz Weir <,> and over the next few weeks it will be my pleasure to introduce stories and storytellers from far and wide <#> Some of the tales to be told have been around for hundreds of years <,> while others have modern settings <#> And they come not just from Ireland but are from many countries <#> In times past families frequently gathered to listen to stories together <,> with children and adults sharing the same tales <#> The advent of electricity was said to have led to a decline in the tradition <,> as it was no longer necessary to tell stories to keep the darkness away <#> And yet the art of the storyteller is perhaps more important than ever in today 's fast-moving world <#> Over the next few weeks <,> I hope that by listening to the stories <,> and seeing those all-important pictures in the mind 's eye <,> you will have the chance to relax <,> and reflect on times past <,> maybe even to call to mind stories of your own <#> The subject of today 's programme is religion <,> since of all the stories told at local gatherings this is the most frequently heard theme <#> It is ironic that whenever visitors come to Northern Ireland they assume that any mention of religion is taboo <,> and yet they are soon amazed by the fact that the locals make jokes and tell stories on this very subject <#> Perhaps by laughing at ourselves and our prejudices <,> some of the tension can be released <#> And yet not all of today 's stories are humorous <,> nor do they assume that there are only two religions in the world <#> Stories whether they are in the form of a monologue <,> family history or folktale <,> cross all sorts of boundaries <,> and can perhaps lead to more understanding of other people 's lives <#> The late James Young wrote many popular pieces on the Protestant Catholic divide <,> a tradition carried on in recent years by local writers such as Crawford Howard <,> who always says that he manages to offend both sides in the one night <#> It is certainly true that people in this part of the world take their religion very seriously <#> But in our first story <,> written and told by Billy Ritchie we take a look at a day out with a difference<S2B-021$B> <#> <&> speaker recites story </&> The pilgrimage coach came to lift us <,> to take us away down to Thurles <#> And big Mary Rose from the Springfield was right proud of her hair set in curls <#> Well we crowded round <,> some clutching liquor <,> especially bought for the trip <,> with most bottles already sampled by considerably more than a sip <#> In the midst of us there were two strangers <,> who no-one had seen there before <,> and nobody asked for their tickets <,> as we all scrambled in through the door <#> They just seemed to flop on the back seat <,> and soon the coach got underway <#> But we gathered <,> although they were tipsy <,> that their first names were Lily and May <#> They just sat and tippled their whiskey and to tell you the truth so did I <#> By the time we were crossing the border <,> a few of the travellers were high <#> Then some of us started off singing <,> though Lily and May didn't join <,> but they let out a gulder up Billy <,> just as we crossed over the Boyne <#> Soon after we pulled into Dublin a break pre-arranged to have lunch <#> Well Lil and May staggered off gaily <,> and got off with the rest of the bunch <#> Well we straightened up as we assembled though Lil and May cared not the least <,> and they weren't even slightly embarrassed <,> when they came face-to-face with a priest <#> Lil says <,> <&> adopts female Belfast accent </&> hey listen here fella <,> til I put a word in your ear <#> I think you 'd be better to scarper <,> for I doubt if you 'll be welcome here <#> Well the wee priest says <,> <&> adopts male priest's voice </&> pardon me Madam <,> on your state I don't wish to encroach but surely you ought to be sober since you 're just off a pilgrimage coach <#> <&> adopts female Belfast accent </&> Pilgrimage what <,> exclaims Lily <,> as a good look around her she made <#> This morning we set off for Bangor <,> to go to an Orange Parade <#> Well <,> here in amidst the confusion <,> <&> adopts deep female accent </&> what 's all this questions big Mary Rose <,> still under the effects of the liquor <#> You could tell by the red of her nose <#> <&> adopts priest's voice </&> Now calm down says Father John Reilly <#> You ladies just made a mistake <#> Mistake is it bellowed big Rosie <#> She 'll be needing a slap in the beak <&> rhymes with mistake </&> <#> Well you big Fenian hussy yells Lily <,> making to grab Rosie 's throat <#> But wee Father John got between them <,> which only got on both their goat <#> Well you orange bitch you screams Rosie <,> ignoring the priest 's warning call <,> made a charge and they all lost their balance and fell into the Royal Canal <#> That dampened their urge to do battle and hastened an end to their war <#> Rose and Lil had to suffer our laughter while stuck to their oxters in glar <#> And if looks could 've killed <,> I can tell you <,> they 'd 've slaughtered the half of the bus <#> But the miracle was <,> they stopped fighting and directed their venom at us <#> Well we got them fished out and their perfume was Olde Canal Bottom Stink <#> The saga had not helped appearance <,> but it countered effects of the drink <#> They muttered and cursed as we sniggered and called them a fine matching pair <#> Gone was the makeup from Lily <,> and the curls had all left Rosie 's hair <#> Now we share then some lunch and refreshments not to mention a quick change of clothes <#> And soon we were ready for leaving <#> It was then that a problem arose <#> We wanted to make up lost time now but uh what about Lily and May <#> We could not leave them stranded in Dublin <#> It was best that they came all the way <#> Of of this they were somewhat reluctant <,> but against this they balanced their need <#> And not wishing to cause any further delay <,> they made a snap choice and agreed <#> On arrival at our destination <,> they came with us both bold as brass <,> right up to the door of the chapel <,> but drew lines at attending the Mass <#> And when back on the coach home to Belfast <,> reflecting the chain of events <,> Rose and Lil thought the whole thing hilarious <,> and them from both sides of the fence <#> And Rosie got great friends with Lily and Lily became her best pal <,> though Lil often said <,> you 're a Baptist since that episode in the canal <#> And every time Father John Reilly <,> encounters a coach bound for Thurles <,> he always remembers the day that <,> he went for a dip with the girls<&> music </&><S2B-021$C> <#> And my father <,> is from Castlederg as well <#> And we were tracing family history so I went back to my grandmother when she was about ninety <#> Although she was physically frail <,> mentally she was very alert and very sharp <#> And I was sitting with her one day and my father who was nearly seventy at this stage was sitting beside us <,> and she started to relate to me the whole Craig family tree <#> And she got onto the point where she was talking about her own husband Patrick Craig <,> who had a sister called Honour Craig <#> And Honour as a young girl had emigrated and gone to America <#> And in America she 'd married a Jewish man called Mr Simon <#> And Mr Simon and Honour had three boys and the boys were being reared as Catholics at that stage <#> But unfortunately poor Honour and her Jewish husband <,> became victims of the Great Flu and died <#> So that left three orphans <#> And word came back to Castlederg that the three boys were being reared by the Jewish side of the family <#> My granny was a newly-married young woman and she thought that she should send for these boys <#> So she went to the parish priest and asked his advice <,> and <,> should she bring the boys back here and rear them and look after them <#> And he said to her well look Minnie <,> you might have enough of your own in times to come <#> And she did <#> She had twelve <#> And his second piece of advice was <,> sure Minnie aren't they better out there being reared as good Jews and they 'll get a job <,> than being over here as Catholics and might never get work<&> music </&><S2B-021$A> <#> That family story from Jim Craig shows how practical people here can be at times <#> Well there are many examples of relatives marrying into a different religion <#> This is sometimes not talked about until someone goes in search of family history <,> and often people can get a surprise <#> This is the stuff of which good stories are made <#> In almost every culture religious tales make up a sizeable part of any folktale collection <,> from the dream time in Australia to the native American Indian creation myths <#> Ireland is no exception <#> And while it is certainly a long way from the Glens of Antrim to the Holy Land <,> this next story was collected in County Antrim by folklorist Michael J Murphy some forty years ago <,> and it is retold for us now by John Campbell<S2B-021$D> <#> It was <,> the time of the flight into Egypt when uhm <,> when the Blessed Virgin and the child Jesus were on the flight into Egypt <#> They hadn't very much time to get away and they were in a great hurry because all the male children were going to be put to death <#> They had to trick soldiers and everything else to get into Egypt and it was a long journey <#> And they ran out of food she ran out of food for the child and she had ran out of food for herself and everything and eventually they come to a house <#> And when they come to the house uh she knocked at the door <,> and a woman come to the door <#> She discovered <,> that the woman in the house had a baby <,> of the same age <,> as our as the child Jesus <#> So she asked her would she have any food that she could give her some and <,> feed the baby <#> And she said well I have very little but I 'll give you the half of what I 've got <#> So she took them them in and <,> gave her the food for the child <#> And as she was feeding the child <,> uh the Blessed Virgin said to uh the woman in the house <,> hang that pot on the fire and fill it full of pebbles and put water in it <,> and put the lid on it <#> And the woman did what she was told <#> Went out and gathered some pebbles and put them into the pot and filled it up with water <#> Eventually the pot started to boil <#> And when it after it boiled for a while she said to uh the woman of the house now lift off the lid to you see what you have <#> And <,> she lifted off the lid and there it was full of great big floury potatoes broke out ready for <,> the table <#> So they all sat round and had a great feed of potatoes <#> And when she was draining the water off the potatoes water was very scarce <,> uh in that country at that time and still is <,> she said now drain that water into a basin because I want to wash <,> my baby in that water <#> And she did <#> She washed the infant Jesus in the water and when she was finished she told the woman of the house to wash her baby in the water and she did <#> And years and years passed <,> thirty-three in fact <,> and after all that time <,> the penitent thief that hung beside Jesus on the cross on Calvary <,> turned out to be that the penitent thief was the same baby that was washed in the same potato water <,> on that flight into Egypt <#> He 'd given him the strength to repent <,> and eventually get into heaven</I>
