there 's no comparison<S1A-083$E> <#> And you know it 's wrong really because women 's women 's backs aren't fit for that at all<S1A-083$A> <#> But sure then 'tis the women who claim to be equal <#> That 's what I can't understand <#> <{> <[> They can't have it both </[><S1A-083$F> <#> <[> Putting in the same effort </[><S1A-083$E> <#> <[> But sure they are </[> </{><S1A-083$A> <#> Huh<S1A-083$F> <#> Putting in the same effort<S1A-083$A> <#> Different jobs<S1A-083$F> <#> Yeah but the load of effort is the same <#> But they put the same amount of work in as a man is<S1A-083$A> <#> They should be paid in proportion to what they do not in proportion <{> <[> for equality </[> with with with the other person<S1A-083$E> <#> <[> They shouldn't </[> </{><S1A-083$E> <#> The fact that you are male and that you have uh more uhm strength in actual fact doesn't make you superior<S1A-083$A> <#> No no it shouldn't no<S1A-083$F> <#> So you shouldn't be paid more<S1A-083$E> <#> They say you shouldn't be paid more for what 's God-given <,> same as if we 're not <#> If we were mental handicapped whatever <,> you don't expect us to work and the
