<S2B-007 Inside Ulster 1><I><S2B-007$A> <#> Good Evening <#> The UFF has said it killed Bobby Monaghan <,> the Catholic man shot dead in the early hours of this morning in the flat he shared with his girlfriend <#> He 'd lived in the Rathcoole estate on the outskirts of Belfast for six years <#> The local MP says people there are hurt that such a brutal murder should bring shame to their area<S2B-007$B> <#> The gunmen broke into the upstairs flat in Camross Park to carry out the attack <#> Bobby Monaghan was forty-four and worked in the family pub in the docks area <#> He and his girlfriend arrived home from work just after two o'clock this morning <#> Neighbours said they heard footsteps running up the stairs and then Mr Monaghan 's girlfriend pleading with the gunmen not to shoot him <#> After a brief struggle though he was shot and died a short time later <#> The two masked gunmen escaped on foot and later the Loyalist paramilitary group the UFF said it was responsible for the murder <#> The family pub where Mr Monaghan worked with his brothers has been targeted by the UFF <#> In June a rocket attack damaged it and three years ago it was wrecked in an IRA bombing <#> The Monaghan family who are Catholics had moved from Rathcoole to Twinbrook some years ago <#> They say they 're now devastated by the murder of an innocent man<S2B-007$C> <#> It 's desperate <,> desperate <#> The whole family is devastated by it <,> you know <#> Like we 'd be been all been at sea for twenty-one years <#> Robert was at sea for twenty-seven <#> Never drank <#> All he liked was a sing-song <#> Shot dead for what <,> for nothing <#> My God <,> it 's unbelievable<S2B-007$B> <#> Following the last bombing the family says the bar was just getting back to normal<S2B-007$C> <#> We 've got all our mixed community back again <#> The bar 's running doing well and like we 're just <,> as you can see we 're fixing the lounge <#> So I don't know <#> People just won't let decent people live <#> That 's what it 's all about<S2B-007$B> <#> People living near the flat were plainly afraid to talk publicly on the murder <,> but the local MP says that the majority are hurt at the brutal act which has brought shame on their area and are keen that Catholics shouldn't move out<S2B-007$D> <#> I would say to the few Catholics that are there <,> they have lived <,> many of them for twenty-five years and more in the area <,> to be confident that their neighbours <,> that they 've lived with <,> feel deeply hurt that this has happened and that they will be vigilant and care for them and that they should remain<S2B-007$B> <#> Roy Beggs says people in the estate are terrorised by both the UFF and the UVF and that the police there need extra resources to stamp out crime<S2B-007$D> <#> It 's time the Newtownabbey police uh applied for and got greater resources to get Rathcoole properly under control<S2B-007$B> <#> The last murders in Newtownabbey were also carried out by Loyalists who fired shots into a workman 's hut at Rushe Park <#> One Protestant man died immediately and a second man died three weeks later <#> Both lived in Rathcoole<S2B-007$E> <#> Assessors are still calculating the cost of the damage caused by the overnight firebomb attacks in Belfast <#> But it 's estimated it will run into hundreds of thousands of pounds <#> One company says it may have to lay off its employees while its premises are repaired <#> It 's seven months since terrorists have carried out a concerted firebomb attack in the city<S2B-007$F> <#> What 's described as a blast incendiary caused extensive damage to a bicycle and car accessory shop in High Street <#> And just yards away <,> a device started a fire in the Nova shop <#> Its owner says that stock has been destroyed and there 's severe structural damage <#> Also in the city centre a firebomb caused some damage to the Roost Bar which is just off High Street <#> In South Belfast <,> a furniture store at Boucher Crescent was destroyed <,> even though a security guard saw the device ignite<S2B-007$G> <#> I spoke to him this morning <,> very very lucky to survive <#> He says it <,> it just burst into flames <#> He tried to put it out with a CO-two fire extinguisher <,> and basically the the heat and also the fumes uh drove him out of the building at which he called the fire brigade<S2B-007$F> <#> Another fire in the same complex was seen and put out <#> The device which caused it was missed in an earlier search of the premises<S2B-007$H> <#> The police informed us today that even when you 're looking for the incendiaries <,> they 're almost impossible to find <#> Uhm if they want to plant them they 'll plant them places you will not find them<S2B-007$F> <#> Where was this one hidden<S2B-007$H> <#> Inside a mattress <,> actually inside the mattress <#> They 'd sliced the mattress and pushed it far in<S2B-007$F> <#> It 's the first time since the start of the year that firebombs <,> a weapon often favoured by the IRA <,> have been used <#> Businesses say such devices cause damage beyond the cost of replacing stock and repairing buildings<S2B-007$G> <#> It 's just disturbing to think that people can go round doing this <,> taking people 's jobs from them and <,> having people basically be put out of their work overnight <#> I mean that 's what 's happened here <#> We 're back to square one <#> I mean your suppliers in England <,> they 're not the most understanding people you 'll ever meet <#> I mean they don't understand the situation here <#> And when you phone them up to say listen by the way we <,> we can't sort out what credit we have with you whatever whatever <,> they 're going to <,> say you know <,> we can't supply people in Northern Ireland anymore cos the it 's just too risky<S2B-007$F> <#> Once again the police have appealed to people to check their business premises before leaving for the night<S2B-007$E> <#> The police say the thirty-one bomb alerts across Belfast today were a nightmare for shoppers and business people <#> All of the alerts turned out to be hoaxes <,> some were caused by vehicles being abandoned <,> others by warning calls <#> An RUC spokesman said the hoaxes made it almost impossible for the emergency services to function <#> An ambulance transferring a baby between hospitals got stuck in traffic at Broadway <,> and the police had to be called to clear a way for it <#> Controlled explosions were carried out on twelve vehicles abandoned in the south <,> north and west of the city<S2B-007$A> <#> As Sinn Fe/in prepares for its special conference this weekend at which it says it 'll give its definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration <,> the Taoiseach Albert Reynolds has again said that no party or paramilitary organisation can have a veto over political progress <#> And the Republic 's deputy prime minister Dick Spring has repeated that only a permanent cessation of IRA violence would allow Sinn Fe/in to have a place at the conference table<&> Southern reporter not transcribed </&><S2B-007$A> <#> Jim Dougal <,> there are people who have a lot at stake this weekend <#> What do you think it will make clearer for them<S2B-007$I> <#> Well a lot of people have a lot at stake in that uh after all the Declaration is the government 's Declaration <#> John Hume and Gerry Adams have a lot at stake in it because of their talks <#> But it seems that the question this weekend is not if Sinn Fe/in will say yes or no to the Declaration <#> It seems to be from their point of view whether or not the Declaration moves what they see as the Peace Process forward and the answer to that appears to be yes but it doesn't seem to be moving it forward <,> far enough forward should I say uh for the IRA to call an end to violence or even a ceasefire <#> And when you ask Sinn Fe/in about this they say that it 's a matter for the IRA to read their definitive response to the Declaration <,> uh uh they they have no advice for them on it<S2B-007$A> <#> Well is this a watershed <,> or <,> are those who have invested so much going to persevere with Sinn Fe/in and the IRA<S2B-007$I> <#> Well I think it 's always been the case that if this process goes on and on and the uh Sinn Fe/in cannot at the end of the day deliver an end to the IRA campaign that people like John Hume and Albert Reynolds would have to accept uh that it hasn't worked <#> But at the moment I think Albert Reynolds in particular seems to believe uh that there is merit in continuing <#> He talks uh in speeches uh to Nationalists <,> he talks about the benefits of the Declaration and the benefits that there would be of uh a a complete end to violence <#> Now I think that because he 's doing that he seems <,> to think that he can in some way influence the debate which is going on within uh the Republican movement and I think no matter what happens this weekend that that uh is likely to continue<S2B-007$A> <#> Jim Dougal <,> thank-you very much<S2B-007$E> <#> Two judges at the High Court in London have said they intend to refer the ban on Gerry Adams visiting Britain to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg <#> The pressure group Liberty which acted on behalf of the Sinn Fe/in president claims it 's an historic decision against the government which opposed the case being referred to the European Court<S2B-007$A> <#> Two people have been killed in a road accident near Banbridge <#> It happened on the main Belfast to Newry Road <#> A car and a tanker lorry collided near the Rathfriland junction at Banbridge <#> It 's emerged that the local council has been asking for some years for a roundabout to be built at the site of the crash <#> Dot Kirby has been to the scene<S2B-007$J> <#> What remains of a Vauxhall Nova <#> The man and woman inside were killed when it was in collision with a lorry <#> The force carried it two hundred yards underneath the truck <,> then both burst into flames <#> The junction is an accident black-spot<S2B-007$K> <#> You just live in terror <#> You hear a thud <,> awful thud <,> and you just <,> your heart sinks <#> My legs fail me almost <#> I 'm a nurse myself and I am really worried <#> <.> Wu </.> it 's just my my my my my legs just go under me and I think about what <,> what is out here on the road to face<S2B-007$J> <#> Fire crews say it was one of the worst accidents they 've ever been to<S2B-007$L> <#> They discovered in fact the lorry burning fiercely <,> and unfortunately the remains of the car as you see now was <,> bedded underneath the front of the lorry <#> It was really horrendous <#> Uh there was wreckage <,> and uh there <.> w </.> there was a lot of smoke and debris lying about<S2B-007$J> <#> The car was coming from Rathfriland <,> the lorry was heading towards Newry <#> Banbridge District Council have been campaigning for a roundabout at the junction for three years<S2B-007$M> <#> I 'll be pressing for that now with all vigour <#> When you 're here and see what has happened it really comes home to you<S2B-007$J> <#> The Department of the Environment are already planning to make the junction safer <#> They 'll be investigating today 's and earlier accidents to see if any further action is needed <#> But whether a roundabout or anything else man-made would have prevented today 's carnage <,> no-one will ever know<S2B-007$E> <#> The headlines so far this evening <,> <#> The UFF murder a Catholic man while his girlfriend pleads not to shoot <#> A man and a woman are killed as their car and a tanker collide <#> And still to come <,> tuning up in Armagh for a weekend of music and craic<S2B-007$A> <#> The French hotel group Novotel is to cease running the hotel in Belfast International Airport <#> It 's understood the decision was made following a meeting between the company and senior airport managers this morning <#> Our business editor James Kerr reports<&> English reporter </&><S2B-007$E> <#> This weekend Armagh plays host to that traditional music institution <,> the Ulster Fleadh <#> It 's the first time the city has done so and to mark the occasion there 's to be a special concert to highlight shared enjoyment of music that 's frequently thought of in terms of our cultural divide</I>
