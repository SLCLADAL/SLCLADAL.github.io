<S1A-044 Encounter><I><S1A-044$A> <#> What 're we now at <#> June <#> Yeah near enough <#> Cos after him there was a brief fling with a black guy and then Gerry <#> They 've all been black <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear><S1A-044$B> <#> Very good <#> <{> <[> I 've never been out with a black man </[><S1A-044$A> <#> <[> There 's a really funny story with the </[> </{> uhm Jareese <#> Did I tell you the Jareese story<S1A-044$B> <#> No<S1A-044$A> <#> <&> laughter </&> The one in between Fred and Gerry <&> laughter </&> <#> It 's a cracker <#> Oh my <{> <[> God </[><S1A-044$B> <#> <[> Where 's </[> </{> he from<S1A-044$A> <#> Uhm America <#> And uhm <,> I went in I was going into my favourite <,> club Q-Bar and went in and I sort of I spotted him first of all <#> He was at the door doing tickets or whatever and just noticed him <#> And I thought oh he 's lovely <#> And the reason why I 'd actually gone there that night was because they had somebody playing trumpet along with the DJ <#> And I was there for this like big Q-Bar night years before and there was a guy playing violin along with it <#> And I loved that you <{1> <[1> know </[1> <#> So that 's the reason why I went down <#> And it turned out it was him playing the trumpet <#> He 's standing on this podium giving it loads with the DJ going on <#> It was fantastic <#> And I was going oh my God it 's that guy <#> So then afterwards he came down and I bumped into him in the crowd and <,> I don't know we just started chatting and stuff <#> And he was really sweet <#> And then he came over again later and we were chatting a bit more <#> And then he gave me his number and said please call me and I thought well why not <#> So I arranged this date for me to go and watch him at the Blue Note where he was playing trumpet <#> <{2> <[2> So I went along like </[2><S1A-044$B> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-044$B> <#> <[2> Is it </[2> </{2> <,> Bangkok<S1A-044$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-044$B> <#> Right<S1A-044$A> <#> That was Bangkok <#> Oh of course like <#> I mean where else would you get up to that sort of nonsense like <&> laughter </&> <#> Fuck <#> So I went along you know by myself glammed up to the nines <#> Went into the Blue Note it 's just a smoky jazz place or whatever and sat there and ordered me gin and tonic and just sort of watched him and <,> whatever <#> And uhm <,> and then I met him another night <#> We went back to the Q-Bar and uh <,> we were just sitting chatting and stuff <#> And then we decided <&> laughter </&> so funny we decided to like go back to his house <#> And he 'd never drunk Saeng-Som so I thought right <#> You 've <{1> <[1> got to try </[1> this <#> So back to his place and I was still a bit like mm <,> not too sure you know if I you know I was just playing it cool or whatever <#> I really fancied him and everything but <,> <#> So we got back there but I was determined <,> not to stay for too long <#> I said oh I 'm only staying for half an hour <#> And he was trying like he 's got brilliant <.> m </.> uhm movie collection or whatever <#> And the only I said no something short and the only short thing he had was like the Twin Towers being blown up you know <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <&> laughter </&> <#> So we 're sitting watching that right <&> laughter </&> <#> And I thought it was fascinating cos I hadn't had a TV in so long <#> I was going fuck <#> What <&> laughter </&> <#> Rewind that bit <&> laughter </&> <#> Sitting and drinking Saeng-Som <#> So anyway the next thing was like I just got pissed and I thought oh fuck it <#> I 'll just stay here <#> So fell asleep <#> Right nothing happened <#> Well we 'd a bit of a snog and a cuddle <#> And when he got his kit off I just couldn't believe my luck <#> He was absolutely gorgeous <#> But by this stage <&> laughter </&> I 'd worked out that he was forty-six years old <&> gasps and laughter </&> <#> I swear to God I mean he looked about like thirty odd <#> And he was like fucking married and divorced and had a mad life and all the rest <#> But uhm <,> the next thing right then the next day this is the the big point right <#> It was I just woke up to this <&> bangs three times </&> on the door <,> <#> And I was like what the fuck 's that <#> And he got up and he went outside and I just heard all this commotion at the door and stuff <#> And I thought should I get up <#> And then I just thought <#> I was just like <{2> <[2> <,> let </[2> it go <#> You know it 's probably his mates or something <{3> <[3> you know </[3> <,> <#> So he went off and he didn't come back for about an hour <#> And I sort of fell asleep again and woke up at about ten o'clock thinking cheeky bastard <#> You know <{4> <[4> he just took off </[4> <#> That 's just really rude <{5> <[5> you know </[5> <&> laughter </&> <#> Aye <#> So I got up and you know got myself dressed and sorted out <#> Cheeky fucker <#> And I was just about to leave when he came back into the room <#> And he was like <,> oh my God you 're never going to believe what just happened you know <&> laughter </&> <#> And I 'm like <,> what <#> So he said uhm <,> basically what 'd happened was his ex-girlfriend this Thai girl who he 'd been seeing for one month <,> <{6> <[6> who owned </[6> a restaurant you know <#> Alright<S1A-044$B> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-044$C> <#> <[2> Let it </[2> </{2><S1A-044$C> <#> <[3> Banging on the door </[3> </{3><S1A-044$C> <#> <[4> He just left </[4> </{4><S1A-044$C> <#> <[5> With his mates </[5> </{5><S1A-044$B> <#> <[6> Mhm </[6> </{6><S1A-044$B> <#> Hi<S1A-044$D> <#> Hi<S1A-044$A> <#> I didn't know anything about her <#> Never mentioned her to me <{> <[> <#> And </[> they 'd broken up like <,> a week before<S1A-044$C> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-044$B> <#> Oh fuck<S1A-044$A> <#> Fucker <,> <#> But anyway she called round <#> Like at least they were broke up <#> At least they were <&> laughter </&> <#> But she knocked on the door like eight o'clock in the morning or something and like I didn't hear any of this <#> He was going to the door and she was like trying to come in to bring him back this book or <{1> <[1> something <,> </[1> <#> And he had said no no no go away <#> You can't come in <#> So she of course knew there was somebody there <#> She came back at nine o'clock <#> And that that big dush dush dush <&> noise of banging on door </&> <#> He opened the door and she shot him with a stun gun <&> laughter </&> <#> Bazaam you know like fucking bang <#> And they 're these things they 're like you know they they put you unconscious for fifteen <{2> <[2> seconds <#> You know </[2> you 're totally out <#> And apparently like thankfully cos he was dead fit it didn't you know <{3> <[3> didn't </[3> work or whatever <#> He was like really winded but he managed to like grab her <#> And they were going like this with the stun gun trying to get in to me going let me at her <#> Let me see her and all this <#> <{4> <[4> She was trying to get into the room to get to me </[4> <&> laughter </&> <#> Can you imagine <#> Lying in bed with a fucking Saeng-Som hangover and getting stun-gunned in your bed like <&> laughter </&> <#> I could 've just <,> it 's bad enough wakening up <{5> <[5> sort of you </[5> don't know some strange bloke running around getting stun-gunned by some psychotic Thai bitch like <#> It 's just like <#> Fuck <&> laughter </&> <#> But he had to like wrestle with her and all <#> And he got her into the lift <#> And they went down in the lift and all <#> And he came out and he was going ahh <#> And the security guards were all standing there just being Thai going uh uh uh and just totally hopeless <#> Do you know <#> And <&> laughter </&> <,> God they nearly had to call the police and everything <,> but they didn't in the end <#> He managed to calm her down and got her to go away <#> And <,> I was just like phew you know when he told me all this <#> And I was just like <,> I was just so hungover and I was just like well <&> laughter </&> be thankful she didn't cut your dick off cos that 's what they normally do <#> Don't think that was a very good response <#> And he was just going <,> I feel so cold <#> I feel so cold <#> And I was just going <,> right well see you later <&> laughter </&><S1A-044$C> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-044$C> <#> <[2> Oh my God

that<S1A-044$A> <#> Och it wasn't really like <#> I just sort of scampered home <#> And I was never so glad to get back to me flat like ever <{1> <[1> you know <#> I was </[1> just going like that was just really too much <#> Or well it could 've been so bad <#> Like I would just not have appreciated getting stun-gunned <&> laughter </&> <#> Do you know what I mean <#> Really <,> like really <#> It 's not on <#> Do you know <{2> <[2> what I mean </[2> <#> I had to go to work later and everything like <#> It 's fucking not on <#> So he called and he apologised and all <#> And I said look you know and I was a bit mm and then I said okay <#> Look well I suppose you know you haven't been in Thailand very long <#> And <,> you know he 'd only been there four months or whatever <#> I thought maybe he just doesn't really understand you know <,> the Thai <{3> <[3> women </[3> <&> laughter </&> basically <#> So I said alright fair enough <#> Suppose nobody was more shocked than you were literally <&> laughter </&><S1A-044$C> <#> <[1> Mm yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-044$D> <#> <[2> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> shocked </[2> </{2><S1A-044$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-044$D> <#>
