<S1B-052 Potato industry><I><S1B-052$A> <#> I 'd like to <&> cough </&> associate myself sir with your remarks <#> Uh we are indebted as a Forum uh to uh Standing Committee D uh for their work in the agriculture and fisheries field <#> And of course we are indebted to them for this report <#> I 'd like just to make a few remarks upon the importance of maintaining the potato industry in Northern Ireland <#> I had a deputation from young people some in farming and some anxious to go into farming <#> I see some of the delegation actually in the galleries today <,> and they pointed out to me that because of the BSE it is really impossible uh to go into meat production <#> The quota system uh keeps them from entering into dairy farming except they have money to purchase quotas and and uh the seed potato industry and ware industry are the two industries that there is an open door <#> Now <,> it may be an open door but it 's not an open door to fruitful uh occupation <,> because if you take the the price of getting ground and the price of the work and the sowing of the seed there is really no profit in the this business today and that means another door is shut to those young people who want uh to enter into farming <#> Agriculture is of course the basic industry of our economy and any weakening of that basis is a weakening to the whole economy and I think it is a very sad thing the attitude that down through the years DANI has taken to the potato industry <#> I was just thinking today that in the prior Assembly we had a similar crisis because of very bad weather <,> when farmers especially in the South Down area uh seed farmers were almost put out of business and many of them put out of business <#> And we found uh a a a a resistance in every recommendation made to try and ease the plant the the <.> e </.> ease the plight of potato farmers <#> It seems that DANI have an attitude of resistance uh to doing anything really solid financially uh for the potato industry <#> And in fact it was the only meeting of the committee and I happened to be chairing the committee at the time that there was a real bust-up and <.> a </.> and potato farmers and civil servants almost came to fisticuffs uh uh at that particular time because of the attitude of DANI <#> And I think it is it 's a disgrace <,> an absolute disgrace that they can't find sixty-six thousand pounds uh to uh uh to waive the inspection fees for certification <#> I mean I think that 's an absolute disgrace that here is an industry in uh a dire peril of being destroyed and DANI can't raise sixty-six thousand pounds uh which is a very little help but at least it would be something <#> I mean it 's absolutely ridiculous <,> and I think that the baroness who flies the world and tells people in all sections of the world uh what they can do to support industry <,> she should support the industry at home that has been down through the years solidly and quietly doing a very good job of work without one penny piece being received from government <#> Surely now <,> to save this industry and to keep it from going the way that the flax industry went uh she needs to be even-handed and instead of saying to people of different colour of skin <,> different colour <,> uh different uh type of culture <,> oh you 're welcome in Northern Ireland and here 's the money on the table she should look at the colour of the skin of the Ulster farmers and she should do something for them <#> And I hope that today she gets a clear message <,> she gets a clear message uh from this House that charity begins at home and she should start at home to look after the best interests of the Ulster people <#> I salute the young people of Northern Ireland who want to enter into farming and I think that they should be supported but how can they enter into this uh particular uh type of employment when the doors are closed and any door that 's open is not a fruitful door to them <#> So I think the time has now come uh for this Forum to say to the baroness <,> you have got to look at financial support uh for uh the industry <#> How different is the attitude of the Republic 's government uh to its farmers <#> How different <#> And when we think that they have squeezed out of Europe six millions a day <,> when we haven't even got out of Europe what we have paid in by head of our population even to this present day shows how the Republic knows how to exploit its opportunities in Europe and elsewhere for the best interests of its people <#> Surely we should be ahead in this particular field <#> And I trust that today that this report uh will be highlighted by the media who seem to be very good at highlighting differences in this Forum but don't seem to be so great at highlighting those things that we all can agree on and for the are for the betterment of all of the people of Northern Ireland <#> One other thing I might mention before I close I think it 's time we had a farmers ' retirement scheme in keeping with with what is happening in the Continent so that those wanting to leave the farming industry and leave it to the younger elements have an opportunity to leave it supported uh by the years that they have served in their life in farming employment <#> I think that this is a very important debate <#> It 's a pity that we 're not going to have the report of our committee after they visit uh the the uh Loughgall and elsewhere but that 's just one of the happenings that come in political life but this report I trust will be completed eventually because it 's an historic document and it needs to be put on the record what the public representatives of Northern Ireland thought upon this crisis matter at this time <#> Thank-you<S1B-052$B> <#> Thank-you Dr Paisley <#> Mr Kieran McCarthy please<S1B-052$C> <#> Thank-you thank-you very much Mr Chairman<S1B-052$B> <#> I I see you 've only just arrived <#> Would you like me to defer it <,> call you later<S1B-052$C> <#> Oh no <,> Mr Chairman <,> I I 'm quite sure that uh what I have wanted to say would probably have been said already <#> I simply would pay tribute Mr Chairman to our our the chairman of our committee Mr David Campbell and indeed to all the members uh for the very business like and constructive manner in which this report was put together <#> Also uh I would pay tribute as I 'm sure has been paid <,> done before to Mr Barnes and his staff for the all the back-up that he has given to our committee <#> Mr Chairman the potato industry has got to be regarded as very important <#> Certainly from the representations made to our Committee by the people who are engaged in this activity it would appear that very little support has been forthcoming uh from the Department of Agriculture <#> And I 'm sure members of this Forum are angry that this should be the case <,> and indeed Mr Chairman if we look at the very first page of the report <,> comparison is now being made with what happened to our once-thriving flax industry<S1B-052$B> <#> Uh sorry to interrupt you we we did have this already <#> <.> Tha </.> that 's that 's a remark of Mr Donnelly I think about the flax <{> <[> industry </[><S1B-052$C> <#> <[> Exactly </[> </{> <#> Well I think it 's worth uhm it 's worth repeating because if <.> w </.> if we do not do anything now we will in a few years ' time be in the same position as the flax <{> <[> industry and </[><S1B-052$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{> I <.> th </.> I think we all agree with that<S1B-052$D> <#> Exactly <#> Mr Chairman our report says that this must not be allowed to happen <#> Most of the important part points of the the report I 'm sure have been made by other members <,> and the <.> remme </.> recommendations Mr Chairman are reasonable <,> and I 'm sure that this Forum will be fully supportive of the contents of the report and the recommendation <,> the recommendations <#> In conclusion Mr Chairman I have said it before and I say it again <,> the Ulster people <,> the Northern Irish people <,> us <,> as representatives of those people should and could be in charge of our own affairs and undoubtedly would make a better job not only of our potato industry but of everything else to do with Northern Ireland <#> If we could only rise above the prejudices and suspicions <,> and come together <&> boos from other Members </&> to form a partnership administration <#> I hear growls and moans there <#> Well shame on those people that are growling and moaning because we have the we have the power we have the will to get together if they would only catch themselves on and come together <#> It could be done Mr Chairman <#> I 've no doubt that it will be done sometime <#> Let us make it sooner rather than later <#> I appeal to all Members of this elected Forum to put our country before party and then we shall all enjoy <.> pros </.> prosperity and peace <#> Mr Chairman I sincerely hope that the powers that be at this moment in time will read this report and act uh on it immediately <#> Thank-you very much Mr Chairman<S1B-052$B> <#> Thank-you Mr McCarthy <#> Mr Bob McCartney<S1B-052$D> <#> Uh Mr Chairman let me immediately say <,> that the remarks of Mr McCarthy uhm are of considerable interest insofar as as I understand it there are Nationalist potato farmers <,> and it is singularly unfortunate that in the thirst for unanimity and concord uh the representatives largely of that community have chosen to absent themselves so uh really uh I think Mr McCarthy is is really addressing his remarks to the absent members uh and and that is that should be the real object of it <#> Let me let me say Mr Chairman that I would like to join with you and the other members of the Forum in congratulating Mr Campbell and his committee on the excellence of their report <#> Uh the chairman is certainly to be congratulated because he has brought to this a background of farming experience <,> of rational analysis <,> and of uh <,> assiduity and and determination <,> <&> laughter </&> and he is to he is to be be congratulated for doing that <#> He 's also to be <,> he 's also to be congratulated for the the manner in which uh in in in which this report has been put together and and the things it has highlighted <#> But I would like to comment that while these recommendations are all very very important <,> there is perhaps an absence of emphasis on the need for urgency <#> There are some young potato farmers here today whom I have consulted with and I think also Dr Paisley has has mentioned the same issue <#> They are in serious danger of going under <,> financially and professionally and at a time when Baroness Denton and the other Ministers of State are talking about how they are going to divide up the money they 're going to take it from the ACE scheme <,> they 're going to give it to the IDB <#> Some money <,> some substantial immediate funds should be allotted to the preservation of jobs that have been the staple backbone of Northern Ireland 's economy since nineteen twenty-one <#> We are paying out money to attract multinationals and I agree <,> their business and and the the employment they provide is essential <#> But we are ignoring the backbone of this community which has been agricultural and the farmers <,> who have worked for generations <#> What we need is an immediate grant <#> Because it 's rather like saying you know to someone who is drowning in the water <,> Mr Chairman <,> well look don't worry old chap <#> There 'll be a rescue boat along for you next week <#> Or a helicopter in a couple of hours <#> What we require now from the Department is not only to take on the very sensible and acute recommendations of this committee but we need to emphasise the urgency <#> I have a young farmer here this morning who is faced with a dilemma <#> Does he sell some land or does he attempt to persuade his bank manager to give him an increased loan <,> I mean just to keep his business <.> a </.> afloat <#> And he 's a young man in his twenties</I>
