<S1A-091 Haircut - Mortgage><I><S1A-091$A> <#> Hello<S1A-091$B> <#> Hi it 's me<S1A-091$A> <#> Oh hi <#> How are you doing<S1A-091$B> <#> Fine <#> I 'm just doing some work here <,> transcribing tapes<S1A-091$A> <#> Oh right <#> Is <{> <[> that </[> interesting<S1A-091$B> <#> <[> Well </[> </{><S1A-091$B> <#> Yes<S1A-091$A> <#> Right very good <#> Uhm what what 'd your hair turn out like<S1A-091$B> <#> Och it 's it 's fine<S1A-091$A> <#> Yeah <#> Is it different or<S1A-091$B> <#> Quite pleased with it <#> Well no it 's not very different <#> It 's just it 's straighter<S1A-091$A> <#> Right <#> I 'm thinking of going and getting something <,> like a colour put in mine<S1A-091$B> <#> Really<S1A-091$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$B> <#> What colour would you use<S1A-091$A> <#> Och well <,> I don't know <#> I mean <,> I 'd be tempted to sort of get a blondie thing done <#> You know like Loretta<S1A-091$B> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-091$A> <#> But then I thought that uhm <,> actually that might just look a bit ridiculous in my hair <#> So <,> but I know if I go they 'll suggest<S1A-091$B> <#> But you could get a lighter one couldn't you <#> I mean it wouldn't have to be <,> <{> <[> blonde or </[> as light as hers<S1A-091$A> <#> <[> Yeah <,> yeah </[> </{><S1A-091$A> <#> I know but I hate hair that just looks like <,> it used to be brown and now it 's light brown <{> <[> you know that kind of a way </[> <#> So uhm I was thinking that I might get <,> sort of coppery things coppery tones put into it <#> But then that might just look ridiculous <#> So I don't know<S1A-091$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-091$B> <#> Mm <,> <{> <[> oh </[> well <#> What about tonight <#> Have you any plans<S1A-091$A> <#> <[> So </[> </{><S1A-091$A> <#> No <#> Have you seen the TV tonight<S1A-091$B> <#> No <#> What 's on<S1A-091$A> <#> Oh it 's brilliant <#> Uhm well there 's Sex and the City and uhm <#> Is Ally McBeal on or <.> Casu </.> no <#> I can't remember <#> There 's something really <,> a a really good line-up <#> Basically I remember thinking I will go home and sit and watch TV<S1A-091$B> <#> Oh right<S1A-091$A> <#> Uhm Julie <,> she wanted to call round last night<S1A-091$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-091$A> <#> But then I was out with the others <#> So uhm I think she might maybe call tonight<S1A-091$B> <#> Right<S1A-091$A> <#> She invited me for dinner again last night<S1A-091$B> <#> Och did she<S1A-091$A> <#> She said that she 'd made too much <,> for them<S1A-091$B> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-091$A> <#> And anyway I think she just wanted me to come round for something near my birthday<S1A-091$B> <#> Yes<S1A-091$A> <#> So uhm <,> I felt a bit wick then having to say oh I can't go again <,> <#> But<S1A-091$B> <#> What do you mean

wasn't able to go again <#> But I just said <{> <[> sorry </[><S1A-091$B> <#> <[> I 'm sure </[> </{> she 's not worried<S1A-091$A> <#> What about you<S1A-091$B> <#> Uhm I don't know <#> Peggy 's

yesterday<S1A-091$D> <#> I did yes <#> <{> <[> Did </[> he call you <#> He had his <,> his uh file <#> It was sitting there with your name on you know just ready to call you basically after that<S1A-091$C> <#> <[> And </[> </{><S1A-091$C> <#> Aye <#> We got in touch with him anyway whether or not he called me <{1> <[1> you know </[1> <&> laughter </&> <#> So <{2> <[2> what did he say </[2><S1A-091$D> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-091$D> <#> <[2> So <,> very promising </[2> </{2> <#> Very promising<S1A-091$C> <#> Really<S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah <#> <{> <[> He was </[> saying that uhm <,> he thought it would be complicated cos Clarisse is abroad<S1A-091$C> <#> <[> Excellent </[> </{><S1A-091$C> <#> Mm<S1A-091$D> <#> But uh because I 'm earning enough <,> <{1> <[1> I </[1> can just put the mortgage in my <{2> <[2> name </[2> <,> or you know organise the mortgage through my accounts or whatever<S1A-091$C> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-091$C> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$D> <#> And if she 's got enough for the deposit <#> But he wouldn't tell me how much she had<S1A-091$C> <#> She oh she does <#> Do you not know how much she has<S1A-091$D> <#> No <#> I haven't a clue<S1A-091$C> <#> Oh <,> well she 's got five thousand with him <#> It 'll be about well actually it 'll be about four thousand <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$D> <#> And is that all usable<S1A-091$C> <#> Uhm <,> yes and then she 's got another three thousand in somewhere else <#> And that was her <{1> <[1> resettlement </[1> fund <#> But she 's got plenty for the <{2> <[2> uhm </[2><S1A-091$D> <#> <[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1><S1A-091$D> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2> <#> Well he said it would be kind of I can't go over a house for seventy-six thousand<S1A-091$C> <#> Right<S1A-091$D> <#> Uh judging my salary or whatever<S1A-091$C> <#> Mhm<S1A-091$D> <#> And uh the deposit would be about four and legal fees whatever you know <#> So it 'd probably come up to about five<S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$D> <#> But I can always get a loan anyway you know <#> But he <{1> <[1> said </[1> you know <,> you can't <.> ge </.> you know they won't touch you if you 're getting a loan to pay your deposit <#> <{2> <[2> But to come </[2> to him and he can put me in on if we get loans from local banks<S1A-091$C> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-091$C> <#> <[2> No <#> That 's right </[2> </{2><S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$D> <#> It 's not uh <,> you know it doesn't show up or something like that<S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah they will like <#> They really do go through all your all your accounts and make sure you 're sort of <,> soluble and stuff <#> <&> talking to non-phone conversational partner </&> I know Gordon <#> Well done<S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah <#> So uhm when 're you moving into yours<S1A-091$C> <#> Well we don't know yet <#> We 're still doing the whole mortgage application nonsense <&> laughter </&> <#> <{1> <[1> So </[1> it 'll still be another few weeks like but hopefully really fucking soon <#> <{2> <[2> I 'm so </[2> sick of this flat <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$D> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-091$D> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-091$D> <#> I can't wait to see it<S1A-091$C> <#> I know <#> I know <#> I can't wait for you to see it<S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$C> <#> So have you been looking at places <#> <{> <[> What 's what 's your limit </[> <#> Seventy-six<S1A-091$D> <#> <[> I haven't looked yet <#> Mm </[> </{><S1A-091$D> <#> Seventy-six yeah<S1A-091$C> <#> Right<S1A-091$D> <#> So I want to look at ones between sixty and seventy-five kind of thing <{> <[> advertised </[> so that I can see the difference in <,> the standard that I 'm getting or whatever you know<S1A-091$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah yeah totally <#> Were you still thinking of Ormeau Road<S1A-091$D> <#> Uh yeah <,> and maybe like around your area<S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah I <{1> <[1> think you should </[1> cos you 'll probably be I know totally <#> It 'll probably be a lot better value <,> <{2> <[2> you know </[2> because if you 're looking at sort of sixty seventy on the Ormeau Road <,> I don't really think <,> you know <,> the standard that you 're you 're going to <{3> <[3> get </[3> is is so good there really<S1A-091$D> <#> <[1> We could be neighbours </[1> </{1><S1A-091$D> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-091$D> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-091$D> <#> Well there 's also Finaghy as well <#> I don't mind <{> <[> I </[> like living up around here you know<S1A-091$C> <#> <[> Really </[> </{><S1A-091$C> <#> Oh aye <#> Oh God are you actually in Finaghy<S1A-091$D> <#> Well I 'm only five minute walk from Finaghy<S1A-091$C> <#> God yeah I never really thought about that <#> <{> <[> That 's </[> so weird <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah yeah<S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$D> <#> Would Clarisse want to live up there<S1A-091$C> <#> Well I sent her an email just telling her all the craic and told her to <,> to like let me know <,> exactly what she 's looking for <,> <{1> <[1> you know </[1> <#> I said basically three plus bedroom <{2> <[2> hopefully </[2> Ormeau Road maybe Blessington maybe Forestside <,> <{3> <[3> as far </[3> out as Forestside but hopefully that area and <,> uhm <,> if if not you know I 'm I 'm looking kind of around this area too you know <{4> <[4> Upper </[4> Lisburn Finaghy<S1A-091$C> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-091$C> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2><S1A-091$C> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><S1A-091$C> <#> <[4> Yeah absolutely </[4> </{4><S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah <#> I mean even like talking to Brendan and just looking round ourselves we really did see that you know the houses on the Lisburn Road totally unaffordable <#> <{> <[> Can't even go there </[><S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Yeah <#> And they 're </[> </{> a big pile of shite anyway<S1A-091$C> <#> They are <#> I mean they really are but like Ormeau Road is pretty much getting there you know <#> They 're just going to be really really out-priced <.> si </.> that you know <,> not not quite <{> <[> but </[><S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> well they 're starting to be already <,> <{> <[> you know </[><S1A-091$C> <#> <[> They really </[> </{> are like ridiculous prices for you know the shittiest little houses <{> <[> you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-091$D> <#> <[> You know </[> </{> that one we lived <,> Ava Street<S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$D> <#> I think it went it was advertised for about seventy-five or something<S1A-091$C> <#> Really<S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$C> <#> God <#> It just is mental<S1A-091$D> <#> I know <#> And like it 's shitty<S1A-091$C> <#> I know <#> I know and that was well I suppose that was what was that three bedrooms <#> But then <,> Mairead 's room was in the attic wasn't it<S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah that was kind <{1> <[1> of converted </[1> like but it shouldn't really be a bedroom <{2> <[2> you know </[2> <#> You can't stand up in it like <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$C> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-091$C> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-091$C> <#> I know <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$D> <#> That was the one she chose <&> laughter </&> <#> <{> <[> I 'll choose the one </[> I can crawl in and out of <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$C> <#> <[> Mairead is </[> </{><S1A-091$D> <#> I know <#> I know but I really do think like you should have a good look around the Blessington Road cos there are you <{> <[> know </[> <#> The reason why there are good bargains there is because of where it is like<S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Yeah but </[> </{><S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah but uhm I mean there are little pockets of<S1A-091$C> <#> Mm<S1A-091$D> <#> Of sort of Proddy pockets or whatever you know that I <{> <[> don't want </[><S1A-091$C> <#> <[> There kind of </[> </{> are but not <.> spec </.> definitely not where we 've moved in to you <{> <[> know <#> I can't </[><S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> how do you know<S1A-091$C> <#> Well because I know people who have moved in there quite recently <#> <{> <[> Ehm </[> <,> Ronan <#> Have you ever met Ronan<S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Uh-huh </[> </{><S1A-091$D> <#> Yes <#> Wee Ronan<S1A-091$C> <#> Wee Ronan yeah <#> He lives there now <#> And a girl called Sally who sort of half-caste <#> She lives there now and she 's Catholic<S1A-091$D> <#> Right<S1A-091$C> <#> And you know it 's really really starting to get that way <,> <{1> <[1> around </[1> that bit <#> Maybe not the Cregagh Road <#> Well definitely not the <{2> <[2> Cregagh Road but definitely around <.> str </.> straight off </[2> the Blessington Road <,> <#> Definitely it 's quite <{3> <[3> mixed </[3> <,> <#> But you know not to say that we 'd ever be going to any of the bars there <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$D> <#> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1><S1A-091$D> <#> <[2> Well no I don't <,> I wouldn't consider it </[2> </{2><S1A-091$D> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><S1A-091$D> <#> No<S1A-091$C> <#> Yes do you know what I mean <#> You 'd need to have UDA tattooed <{> <[> across your forehead </[><S1A-091$D> <#> <[> What what </[> </{> part of the road are you on <#> Can you describe it for me<S1A-091$C> <#> Uhm <,> do you know <,> like it 's sort of <,> straight ahead of you know where Worthington Embankment stops <,> on <{1> <[1> the Blessington </[1> Road <#> It 's pretty much there <#> It 's like between <,> where the gates are to the Oulton Square and where the <,> uhm <,> BIFHE place <{2> <[2> is </[2> <#> It 's pretty much just straight there <{3> <[3> you know </[3> <#> You just have to walk about thirty seconds and would be like right at the gates of the Oulton <{4> <[4> Square </[4> <#> So it is like straight off Blessington Road and about ten doors down<S1A-091$D> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1A-091$D> <#> <[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2><S1A-091$D> <#> <[3> Right right </[3> </{3><S1A-091$D> <#> <[4> Uh-huh </[4> </{4><S1A-091$D> <#> Right <#> That 's only like ten minute walk then from <,> Ormeau <{> <[> Road too </[><S1A-091$C> <#> <[> From the </[> </{> Ormeau Road totally yeah <#> <{> <[> It 's quite a nice walk </[> <,> if it 's if if it 's during the day like<S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Through the park lovely </[> </{><S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$C> <#> So <,> I mean you know that 's that 's why <,> why we took it <#> I was just wasn't prepared to go any more East Belfast than that<S1A-091$D> <#> No <#> Cos Sarah-Jane 's sister lives sort of round the corner up up uh <,> My Fair Lady 's Road or something<S1A-091$C> <#> My Lady 's Road yeah<S1A-091$D> <#> My Lady 's Road <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$C> <#> Stanley you know Stanley the hairdresser <#> He lives just off he lives uhm just off My Lady 's Road as well<S1A-091$D> <#> Yeah<S1A-091$C> <#> Yeah so it is you know getting to be <,> a sort of okay area for <,> <{> <[> people </[> like us <&> laughter </&><S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-091$D> <#> But I <,> you see I don't have a clue <{1> <[1> about </[1> certain areas <#> You know you could only kind of judge them by <{> <[> <,> snotty-nosed kids running around </[><S1A-091$C> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-091$C> <#> <[> I know <,> <#> Well I do <#> And </[> </{> even if you 're thinking about looking at somewhere I 'll tell you what sort of an area it is <{> <[> cos I </[> really do know around there really really well <,> <#> But you need to be right off the Blessington Road <#> No further in than that like<S1A-091$D> <#> <[> Right </[> </{></I>
