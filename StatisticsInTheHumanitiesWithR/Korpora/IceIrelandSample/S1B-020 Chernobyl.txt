<S1B-020 Chernobyl><I><S1B-020$B> <#> The actual language as I 've said before <,> it was suppressed by Soviet rule and uh <,> you had high levels of retention in uh in the isolated southern provinces and villages because the Soviets didn't <,> weren't really around those isolated areas to actually enforce uhm <,> to actually disapprove of the use of <.> Belar </.> the <.> Ru </.> of the Belarusian language <#> Uh according to the nineteen ninety-nine census <,> about thirty-eight percent of Belarusian residents speak Belarusian in their everyday lives <,> eighty-two percent consider Belarusian their mother tongue <,> so <#> There isn't actually much evidence to say this but I 'd say that <,> that retention of Belarusian is mostly in rural areas where uh the older generations retain the language and there has been a trend for uh younger generations to actually migrate to bigger cities to find more employment <#> So actually coming to the nuclear disaster now after all that <#> Uhm just to give a quick background <#> The failed experiment uhm caused an explosion in the reactor of the Chernobyl power plant on the twenty-sixth of April nineteen eighty-six <#> Uh tonnes of radionuclides of caesium <.> plutonium <,> uranium <,> iodine were released into the atmosphere and spread by prevailing south easterly winds <#> As I said before <,> most of that fallout actually went over Belarus even though the <,> the uh plant was actually located within the Ukraine <#> And just to <.> ex </.> quickly explain uh what radionuclides are <,> they 're unstable particles of radioactivity <,> that when they 're released into the atmosphere they can be absorbed by any living matter <#> For instance uhm plutonium is actually absorbed into the bones instead of calcium <,> so if there 's plutonium in the atmosphere or in the food you 're eating <,> your body will <.> pre </.> will preferentially absorb that and that 's why there has been such an increase in cancers in Belarus and uh so many well-documented uh outbreaks of cancer-related illnesses <#> I 'm not going to go into those illnesses too much because it 's a huge area and that 's what 's usually seen when <,> when you examine the whole Chernobyl uhm event <,> <#> Uhm this is the actual power plant itself <#> Uhm I think this <,> this picture 's interesting because it doesn't really demonise the plant <#> Uhm most of the most of the pictures you see of the actual power plant shows this big crater uhm with just debris everywhere and people in big uhm zipped up suits trying to clean it up <,> and that in a way is kind of <,> it kind of fosters the whole uhm <,> the whole thoughts of paranoia and doom that people have in Belarus associated with the event <,> <#> The actual evacuation uh was co-ordinated by Moscow <#> Immediately when this happened the Soviets uhm heard of it <,> as soon as it happened <,> and they thought that it would be very damaging for their <,> their rule <,> for this to actually emerge as a major disaster in Belarus <#> So they immediately uhm <,> they drafted plans to actually deal with it and uh the following day involved around forty thousand people leaving Prypyat in one thousand one hundred buses within less than three hours <#> Now all the numbers that I 've used for evacuation in this presentation <,> they 're all estimates because there really is <,> there 's no uhm <,> there 's no official figures about where the people went <,> how many of them went <,> and where they went <,> because <#> This could have stopped my project in its tracks because I initially wanted to establish a spatial distribution of evacuees <#> This is impossible because the Soviets were so secretive about their actual research that uh they didn't release any of <,> any of their research documents until the fall of the USSR<&> later in presentation </&><S1B-020$A> <#> I think you need to conclude shortly Sine/ad<S1B-020$B> <#> Okay <#> Uh radiophobia again was a big obstacle for people in the cities uhm and then sort of trends of hypochondria and uh further paranoia started to come out uh among the younger generations and there 's a question <,> did a <.> r </.> <,> did Chernobyl replace the hopelessness <,> hopeless oppression of the Soviet rule in Belarus <#> Uhm just to reiterate again the whole emergency of Chernobyl as an actual feeling of doom and way of thinking among the Belarusian people <#> And just to conclude <,> new cultural patterns <#> Uh adulteration of the environment with radioactivity so the breaking of the bond of people from the <.> la </.> <,> breaking off <,> the bonds of people living with the <,> from the land <#> And then again it 's just a <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> I was talking about before <#> Uhm the dispersion of villages which retained uh traditions and languages <#> Villages were <.> tr </.> <,> villages uh traditionally were the places where people actually uhm practised the old traditions of gathering food and indigenous recipes <,> things like that <#> Uhm the creation of the slums for evacuees who became an ethnic minority in their own country which I think is a fairly unique uh occurrence <#> Uh again a culture of paranoia and doom <#> And finally <,> thousands of children migrating from Belarus each year with leukaemia <#> I haven't mentioned this much because obviously it 's a big area as well <#> But uhm the Belarusian government initially really didn't like this occurrence because it showed up the government as being incompetent and not being able to deal with their own problems <#> And of course the permanently changed demography of the evacuated zones in Belarus which are basically now abandoned apart from a few old people and will gradually dwindle and just overgrow within the next few hundred years <#> That 's the end<&> applause </&><S1B-020$A> <#> Okay <#> Questions <,> comments for Sine/ad<S1B-020$C> <X> <#> The the people that stayed behind in uh in the town <,> like the old ladies and also the uhm <,> uh the the vagabonds and the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> What <,> you know <,> what would they eat <,> how would they live </X><S1B-020$B> <#> Oh there 's <,> I mean <,> if you think about it this was a really productive agricultural area and the produce is still there except it 's unclean <#> I mean there 's <,> there was still animals around <,> there was all sorts of crops<S1B-020$C> <X> <#> Just abandoned </X><S1B-020$B> <#> Yeah <#> Just abandoned because they couldn't actually continue to <.> ex </.> <,> to uhm <,> to export that sort of stuff <,> because if you export grain from the area it 's going to contaminate the rest of the country <#> It 's going to contaminate anywhere that you export it to basically <,> so they have to stop all <,> stop all movement of of produce out of the area <#> So if you looked at it in a <,> in a whole <,> in a real sense <,> it was a really productive area and anyone who didn't have anything <,> they just went there <#> There was loads of food but <,> it <.> wa </.> it 's going to make them sick you know but <,> they didn't see it that way<S1B-020$C> <X> <#> What 's it like now <#> Are they all dead or are they still alive </X><S1B-020$B> <#> Uhm <,> it 's very difficult to <.> act </.> to actually find contemporary sources on the state of the culture in Belarus because <,> as I said before <,> people aren't really interested in this <#> They 're interested in the medical consequences <,> uh bringing children out <,> uh bringing children to different countries to try and make them better and stuff like that <#> Uhm I 'm not really sure what the state of the uh <,> of the contaminated zone is <#> I 'd imagine it 's a it 's a similar <,> similar to what I just illustrated there <#> Some uh old people are returning because they don't want to be relocated in different places and uh just the influx of people who want to <,> opportunists who want to take some fruits of the land<S1B-020$D> <#> Have there been any uhm physical mutations to preceding generations<S1B-020$B> <#> There has yeah <#> And that 's another reason why people kind of are engulfed by a feeling of hopelessness because they see <,> they see uh the fact that if I get married and if I grow up <,> my children probably will be sick or they 'll have genetic mutations <,> things like that <#> So in a way it actually affects the race of the Belarusian people in that in the way that the effects of it will be seen for thousands of years to come<S1B-020$A> <#> Okay <,> are <,> oh<S1B-020$E> <X> <#> Just a quick query <#> You know the way there was this thirty kilometre <{1> <[1> arbitrary </[1> contamination zone <#> To what extent do they know now that they 've actually gone in and looked <,> how much of the area that was deemed uncontaminated it 's now realised that they <{2> <[2> have to evacuate </[2> </X><S1B-020$B> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1B-020$B> <#> <[2> Uhm well there 's six </[2> </{2> <,> there 's six provinces in Belarus and three down in the south <#> They 're the ones that were hit the most badly and <,> I mean really if you want to establish an actual zone of contamination you have to go in there and measure like two <,> tens of metres <#> And since they went <,> since the disaster they 've been sending <.> med </.> <,> they 've been sending groups of scientists into the contaminated zones to actually try and measure this in greater detail <#> But basically they go round and they just <,> they just measure uh and then decide on <,> decide on the basis of how many people are living near a contaminated zone <#> I mean it 's very difficult to actually <,> find a published distribution of contaminated zones <#> They they don't like that sort of thing coming out <#> Uhm they don't really want people to know and<S1B-020$E> <X> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> an awful lot of secrecy around it then still or </X><S1B-020$B> <#> Uhm I 'd say <,> if you <.> re </.> if you went to the government resources probably they would <,> they would be more forthcoming <#> But certainly in in earlier times the Soviets didn't <,> the Soviets were extremely paranoid about any sort of information coming out <#> And uh even you know I 'd say the Belarusian government as well are guilty of damage limitation <#> They 're trying to say <,> no actually you <,> you actually live in a safe area so we won't have to bother moving you <,> you know<S1B-020$F> <#> Is there a time frame for decontamination <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><S1B-020$B> <#> See the thing about all these radioactive nuclides that were expelled <,> as I <#> Remember I said about the half lives <#> Iodine has a half life of a few hours so effectively iodine doesn't exist any more around the plant <#> Something like plutonium could have a half life of twenty-three thousand years <#> So <,> you 're looking at that <,> or at the contaminated zones being <.> ren </.> rendered uninhabitable for the rest of the time that humans are on the earth <,> you know <#> It 's pretty profound<S1B-020$G> <#> What 's the relationship like between Ukraine and Belarus now <,> after that<S1B-020$B> <#> Uhm I think the Ukraine economically did much better after the fall of the USSR because they are much more into capitalist reform <#> Uhm <,> as I said <,> the dictator <,> he just came in <,> and he was a Soviet sympathiser so he didn't want to uhm <,> he didn't want to develop the currency or anything like that <#> The Ukraine were better able to deal with it financially because their evacuations were much more efficient <#> Uhm I 'm not sure what the situation is now but obviously there would be a bit of begrudgery harboured against Ukraine because the <,> Belarus doesn't have any nuclear power plants at all <,><S1B-020$A> <#> Right <,> we 'll have to draw to a close there <#> Uh will you put your disc in <#> Uhm I thought that was <,> was really interesting <,> this notion of an ethnic group being defined by radioactivity rather than by language or dress or anything else it is actually <,> and it is <,> I think it is in many respects <,> the correct use of the term <#> Uhm <,> they 're recognised as a group <#> Do they actually have a name for them<S1B-020$B> <#> Uh they probably have slang names like <,> oh he 's radioactive <#> Keep away from him <,> you know <#> That 's<S1B-020$A> <#> Yeah <#> Cos that 'd be interesting because that 's another thing for an ethnic group is that they have a <,> a name <,> an ethno name<S1B-020$B> <#> They probably have slang names <#> I think they do have slang names <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> Oh he 's radioactive or <unclear> several sylls </unclear> but it haven't looked into it too much <#> I haven't really found information about it<S1B-020$A> <#> The other thing I was interested in is <,> can they marry <,> <#> Or <.> i </.> is it is it impossible<S1B-020$B> <#> Well you 're looking at a sort of a Nazist notion of permission to marry because they 're they 're <.> no </.> they 're not pure you know <#> You can't do that to people<S1B-020$A> <#> No but <,> is there real problems in them<S1B-020$B> <#> Well <,> I mean there is an extent of uh infertility as well as cancers <,> things like that <#> But it 's not <,> it 's not a significant trait of uhm radioactive contamination <#> But it would be a problem to some extent</I>
