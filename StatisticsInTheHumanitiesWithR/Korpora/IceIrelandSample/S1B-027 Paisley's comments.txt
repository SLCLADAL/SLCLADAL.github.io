<S1B-027 Paisley's comments><I><S1B-027$A> <#> Well would you not describe Ian Paisley 's attitude given his weekend speech as intransigent <.> a </.> <.> a </.> as well <#> Uh I mean he <.> b </.> I we have already mentioned that fact that that he was hitting out at members of the Ulster Unionist Party he talked about socialising with the enemy <#> His attitude to people from the Irish government was here <,> I am facing the enemy <#> Was that your attitude<S1B-027$B> <#> Well of course uh they 've made themselves the enemy because of their uhm constitution and so on <#> And uh they they have turned themselves into the enemy <#> What we 're interested in is reaching a situation <,> where they are no longer the enemy but they are uh <.> ou </.> our our neighbours <#> And that 's what we were attempting to raise <#> But <.> m </.> my point about the weekend speech at the DUP conference is confined <,> to the point that he made that Sir Sir Patrick Mayhew was a wicked and vile Secretary of State <#> And one has to ask oneself <,> uh is that <,> accurate <#> Is it true <#> Is he vile and is he wicked because if he 's not then why was the statement made <#> If he is let us have the evidence <#> And uh <,> <.> m </.> <.> m </.> I just don't think you can go round saying that sort of thing about the person who you were going to <,> ask to argue your case for seven and a half billion pounds a year in the cabinet <,> the person who you have to persuade and influence if you want to change government policy <#> And if you go about describing him as <,> <.> w </.> wicked and vile I don't think you 're going to get anywhere<S1B-027$A> <#> Have you have you any reservations about his reported description of Irish Justice Minister Padraig Flynn as Porridge Skin Flynn and uh Foreign Affairs Minister David Andrews as Andrew Liver Republican Salts<S1B-027$B> <#> Well it 's like <,> we 're not interested in some kind of comicuts <#> I mean we 're dealing with serious political issues <,> and personalising thing <,> uh to that extent is not going to to do us any good <#> Our <.> po </.> view on on the Irish ministers and how they performed is is well-known <#> And I 've already indicated that they <,> uh they they exposed themselves as not being able to deliver uh on the promises that they had made <#> And uh that 's where I would <.> pre </.> to leave it <#> Let 's stick to this subject <#> Let 's stick to the issues <,> and not get involved or side-tracked in in in personality <.> co </.> politics <#> It really isn't going to do anybody least of all the Province any good<S1B-027$A> <#> Well that was Reng <&> Reg </&> Empey of the Ulster Unionist Party <#> And with me in the studio is the Alliance leader Doctor John Alderdice <#> Well uh you 've branded these weekend comments as uh foolish unhelpful and unpersuasive <#> I 'm sure <,> you 'd like to amplify that now<S1B-027$C> <#> Well I think they 're rather silly comments apart from the rather childish personalised nature of some of them <#> They 're rather foolish because <,> if you shout abuse at people you 're more likely to get their backs up than to get their co-operation <#> And what we want to see <,> is the co-operation of politicians from the Republic of Ireland to change Articles two and three to change lots of other things as well <#> We want to see human rights respected throughout the island and throughout the islands indeed <#> They 're unhelpful comments because a lot of very good quiet productive work has been done over the last few years to change the views of people uh throughout the island uh <#> Some of us have gone to the Republic on on many many occasions to try to begin to bring a more reasonable view of things and that 's begun to be effective <#> Recent elections of <,> of of Mary Robinson of course in the past week have demonstrated that uh the people of the Republic are beginning <,> to have a much more flexible <.> a </.> and realistic and friendly view towards people in Northern Ireland<S1B-027$A> <#> But Ian Paisley is proud of the fact that he has said so that they didn't run to Dublin <#> And that 's what he 's saying<S1B-027$C> <#> Yes well of course uh <.> f </.> he he did promise that he was going to go to Dublin <#> He gave <.> g </.> gave undertakings that he was going to do to go to Dublin <#> And he 's not going to persuade anybody in Dublin unless he sits down and talks with them <#> That 's the fact of the matter <#> Sure there 's <{> <[> no point </[><S1B-027$A> <#> <[> Well he is prepared </[> </{> to do that if they make some movement<S1B-027$C> <#> Oh yes it 's always somebody else that has to make the movement <#> The reality of course is that a number of of leading Southern politicians now after discussions with some of us <,> uh have been prepared to address the question of articles two and three and the other issues which have got to be addressed as well <#> Uh but that 's not going to be helped by shouting abuse across the border <#> That 's only going to make the hardliners dig in their heels <#> And after the sort of election result we 've had over the last week I think that responsible politicians ought to be welcoming what 's happening in the Republic of Ireland <,> welcoming the changes that 've taken place and beginning to put forward a view of Northern Ireland as a place populated by reasonable and decent people <#> What do you think people in the Republic of Ireland are going to think when they read those sorts of comments from Ian Paisley at the weekend <#> They 'll say they 're a crowd of rascals up there <{> <[> and </[> and of course <.> w </.> we don't want to have anything to do with them<S1B-027$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-027$A> <#> Well <.> i </.> is that not unfair in itself because Ian Ian Paisley <.> a </.> and his party <,> they represent a a substantial slice of the Northern Ireland population and Northern Ireland uh opinion <#> And if I may paraphrase and show what a lot of his supporters and people are saying Ian Paisley is the only man who will keep us out of the clutches of a united Ireland <#> Now you know that 's <{> <[> right </[> <#> You know that 's that 's the gut feeling<S1B-027$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-027$C> <#> Oh I know I know there are people who will say that <#> But I 'll tell you this <,> I know an awful lot of people who will say <,> people from the Unionist community who will say Ian Paisley has wrecked Northern Ireland <#> Ian Paisley 's the man who 's destroyed everything <#> And instead of keeping us in the United Kingdom he 's turned people in Westminster <,> off Northern Ireland <#> They want to be rid of us as soon as possible when they see people like Ian Paisley saying I 'm British and I stand for everything British <#> The truth of it is <,> that there 's no greater friend to those who want to take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom than somebody who makes Northern Ireland people persona not grata in the United Kingdom <#> And this kind of statement does precisely that <#> It doesn't help <#> Doesn't win us any friends<S1B-027$A> <#> Yes but against that uh uh <.> the </.> there is the the the other view that people know where they stand with Ian Paisley <#> <{1> <[1> Well <.> w </.> </[1> yes well I mean <{2> <[2> a lot of people as </[2> we know we know one thing that Ian Paisley 's not going to run us into a united Ireland let 's put it that way <#> They 're not sure about you and the Alliance Party <#> And they 're a bit worried about some of the uh uh Ulster Unionists uh who have been parleying with Dublin <#> And that 's come through in Ian Paisley 's speech <#> Now <,> <.> th </.> those are the facts of life <#> They may be unpalatable to you <#> They may be unpalatable to the Ulster Unionists and us <#> But those are the facts of life<S1B-027$C> <#> <[1> Well do they </[1> </{1><S1B-027$C> <#> <[2> Do they <#> I mean </[2> </{2><S1B-027$C> <#> No I 'm afraid I disagree with you <#> I think there 's about three hundred and fifty thousand people who stood outside the city hall <,> and heard Ian Paisley saying that he was never going to speak to British ministers until the Anglo-Irish Agreement was scrapped <,> and that he was going to destroy it and bring it down to nothing <#> And where are we seven years later <#> Anglo-Irish agreement 's as strong as ever <#> Unless we get some kind of negotiated agreement <,> it 's going to be built upon <#> If there was a Labour administration came in in two or three years time it 'll be it would be strengthened even further <#> And Ian Paisley said he 'll never do this and he 'll never do that and he 'll never do the other thing and he 's ended up doing them <#> When people like myself came out and said the Anglo-Irish Agreement was not a fair thing the way it came about and and it wasn't a good agreement but it is not going to be even suspended <,> uh and we 're going to find we have to go into talks and we have to go negotiate this thing out and we 've stuck with that position over the years and we 've said there have to be compromises and there has to be sharing of responsibility <,> in Northern Ireland and there has to be good relations with the Republic of Ireland <#> And we 've said it for twenty years and we 're still saying it and <{> <[> it 's the truth </[><S1B-027$A> <#> <[> Yes <,> now </[> </{> what whatever your views or members of the public or other politicians ' views <.> o </.> of the Reverend Ian Paisley and very specifically about the strident speech he made at the weekend and the comments he made <,> I mean he 's been around a long time <#> He 's no mug <#> <{> <[> Well that </[> he knows what he 's doing doesn't he <#> I mean he within his own <,> uh bailiwick he knows what he 's about doesn't he<S1B-027$C> <#> <[> I think </[> </{><S1B-027$C> <#> Well <,> that remains to be seen <#> There 's some people who 'd say he 's been around too long <,> <{> <[> and that he </[><S1B-027$A> <#> <[> Well you could </[> </{> say that of <{> <[> several politicians </[> <&> laughs </&><S1B-027$C> <#> <[> And that and that </[> </{> he 's too rooted in the past <,> and that what 's very important is that we look to the future <#> You <.> sh </.> you see you could say about a whole lot of Fianna Fa/il politicians in the Republic of Ireland <,> they know their people <,> they know what their people want they want hard green Nationalism and that 's what they 're going to be giving to them <#> But you see a lot of the people in the Republic of Ireland have thankfully begun to say no <#> We want a more progressive approach <#> We want a more pluralist <,> a more tolerant uh republic <,> which for example uh accepts that Protestants uh have rights uh and that Protestants should play a full part in the Republic of Ireland <#> And of course if that develops as I hope very much that it does and I think it is <.> de </.> developing <,> <#> I don't think the Mary Robinson election was a flash in the pan <#> I think this election has shown that there 's real progress <#> We want to see the same thing happening in Northern Ireland <#> We want to see progressive politics here <#> We want to see pluralism and tolerance throughout the whole island <,> throughout these islands <#> And so while you say <,> that Ian Paisley stands for the views of some people and he does <,> whether or not it 's a <.> g </.> it 's a growing group of people <,> that are looking to the future <,> or a shrinking group of people that are looking to the past <,> well of course that 's going to be a matter for for the listeners to Talk Back and all the other people who vote in elections in Northern Ireland to decide over the next number of years<S1B-027$A> <#> Yes let 's look <.> b </.> briefly uh the situation down at at in the South at the moment is is rather fluid <.> b </.> to put it mildly it looks as though <,> will there be a coalition of some sort <#> Uh we <.> d </.> do you feel I think you do from what you 've been saying that might augur well for the future of talks <,> but but if Ian Paisley for example sticks to his guns and says look unless you give me that guarantee I 'm not doing anything <,> <.> w </.> would you have to consider yourself and the other parties going ahead without Ian Paisley</I>
