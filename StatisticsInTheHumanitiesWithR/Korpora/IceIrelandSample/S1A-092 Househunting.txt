around Finaghy you know you 've got your wee pockets and stuff<S1A-092$A> <#> Yeah I know <#> I know <#> But yeah you do just have to to have to be aware <&> laughter </&> <#> You don't want to end

you know </[1> <#> I kind of have but I sort of took faith in the fact that you know I 've got a few Catholic friends living round me so that 's <{2> <[2> okay </[2> <&> laughter </&> <#> No but it is I mean I used to live like right off My Lady 's Road <{3> <[3> and you know </[3> whenever I first bought a house <#> And it was so Protestant you know<S1A-092$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1>

saying she wants to go on a binge on Saint <{> <[> Paddy 's Day all day </[> <#> So she wants to save herself Saturday night<S1A-092$A> <#> <[> Oh yeah that 's right </[> </{><S1A-092$A> <#> Ah<S1A-092$B> <#> Which is just nonsense<S1A-092$A> <#> It kind of is isn't it<S1A-092$B> <#> Yeah <#> But Bad Manners is on and then Crescent Arts is on after that<S1A-092$A> <#> I know it is <#>

it is actually going to be really good<S1A-092$B> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-092$A> <#> So it 'd be really good if you could come up afterwards or something<S1A-092$B> <#> Right <#> Give me the hold on and <{> <[> I 'll get a pen </[><S1A-092$A> <#> <[> I mean I don't know </[> </{> the address <#> I don't <{> <[> know <#> I 'll have to tell you tomorrow </[><S1A-092$B> <#> <[> Oh you don't know <#> Okay </[> </{> <#> Well just text it to me tomorrow<S1A-092$A> <#> Yeah I mean the only thing is it 's on the Antrim Road <#> But I really do think it 's going to be dead good<S1A-092$B> <#> How far up<S1A-092$A> <#> Uhm I really don't know<S1A-092$B> <#> Mm<S1A-092$A> <#> Honestly <,> but uhm <,> yeah any parties we 've been to you know with them has been just the best<S1A-092$B> <#> Right<S1A-092$A> <#> So I mean <,> we 'll probably get there like while you 're at the Crescent so I 'll text you and let you know anyway whether it 's good or not<S1A-092$B> <#> Sound<S1A-092$A> <#> So at least you can come to a party that 's good<S1A-092$B> <#> Yeah <&> laughter </&> and you might end up in the Crescent<S1A-092$A> <#> Probably <&> laughter </&><S1A-092$B> <#> And what about Saint Paddy 's day<S1A-092$A> <#> Well <,> I figure we 're definitely going to go for a few drinks or something <,> <#> <{1> <[1> Like </[1> fiddle-de-dee or <{2> <[2> something <#> What do you think </[2><S1A-092$B> <#> <[1> Well </[1> </{1><S1A-092$B> <#> <[2> Mhm <,> there 's </[2> </{2> parades and all on <{> <[> downtown at </[> half one<S1A-092$A> <#> <[> Is there </[> </{><S1A-092$B> <#> Yep<S1A-092$A> <#> What kind of parades<S1A-092$B> <#> I don't know <#> Belfast 's biggest parades ever apparently <&> laughter </&><S1A-092$A> <#> Really<S1A-092$B> <#> Yep

together <{1> <[1> to </[1> uhm sort of meet up and <,> go down town and go round all like the John Hewitt and bars like that you know and listen to fiddle-de-dee <#> <{2> <[2> It 's </[2> going to be

long we can last after Saturday night <&> laughter </&><S1A-092$B> <#> Yeah <,> aye right enough <#> Sure we could go straight there from Saturday night <&> laughter </&><S1A-092$A> <#> Well we could do yeah absolutely <#> Oh God <#> Oh God <&> laughter </&> <#> No definitely I 'm so up for like going out on Sunday <#> I 'd kill myself if I didn't <#> Don't ever not go out on Saint Patrick 's <{> <[> Day <#> It </[> has to be done<S1A-092$B> <#> <[> I know </[> </{><S1A-092$B> <#> Have you heard from Clarisse recently<S1A-092$A> <#> No I haven't actually <#> She doesn't send me emails anymore <&> laughter </&><S1A-092$B> <#> I haven't heard from <{1> <[1> her in a week </[1> or something <#> Yeah <#> She was sending me quite regular ones cos I 'm on <.> e </.> email every day you know <#> I can <{2> <[2> I 've </[2> access to it now whereas before it was like once a month you know<S1A-092$A> <#> <[1> Does she write to you </[1> </{1><S1A-092$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-092$A> <#> Yeah have you been uhm looking at estate agents uhm on the internet<S1A-092$B> <#> No<S1A-092$A> <#> Cos they 're really really good<S1A-092$B> <#> Are they up-to-date<S1A-092$A> <#> Totally up-to-date <#> Brilliant <#> Much better than than the papers and stuff that you get<S1A-092$B> <#> Oh right<S1A-092$A> <#> Yeah I must uhm <{> <[> I 'll email you the addresses of them all </[><S1A-092$B> <#> <[> Is it Property News Property News </[> </{> dot com<S1A-092$A> <#> They aren't actually that good<S1A-092$B> <#> Right<S1A-092$A> <#> Because uhm <,> I think because they collate so many other estate agents into their newspaper that you know they can be really behind<S1A-092$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-092$A> <#> Whereas all the actual specific ones uhm <,> especially in East Belfast anyway you know Pooler Watson Cowley Groves and and estate agents like that <{> <[> they 're </[1> always really up-to-date<S1A-092$B> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-092$B> <#> Right<S1A-092$A> <#> And probably somewhere round the Ormeau Road as well <#> But I 'll email you the addresses of them anyway so that you can have a look<S1A-092$B> <#> Okay mhm <#> That 'll be good <#> Aye just send it on to me<S1A-092$A> <#> So what was Clarisse saying<S1A-092$B> <#> Uhm <,> when was it I think it was about a week ago I heard from her<S1A-092$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-092$B> <#> Or so <#> I 'm damned if I can remember <&> laughter </&> <#> We kind of have wee conversations now like you know <#> It 's not it 's not tell me about <{> <[> your whole last month </[> you know<S1A-092$A> <#> <[> What 're you doing </[> </{> yeah <#> Is she okay anyway <#> And she 's doing the teaching and all and<S1A-092$B> <#> Yeah she was saying she missed her <,> her friends from Maris from the old school that she was working in<S1A-092$A> <#> Yes<S1A-092$B> <#> So maybe she doesn't see them so regularly<S1A-092$A> <#> Yeah cos whenever I was speaking to her on the phone she said she was quite lonely <,> <{1> <[1> because </[1> just you know she didn't have people to talk to all day at work <#> <{2> <[2> She 's </[2> just kind of doing it by herself <#> I can totally understand that cos that 's kind of what I 'm doing <&> laughter </&> <#> She 's got no no work colleagues anymore <#> It 's really really weird <{3> <[3> you know </[3> <#> Really strange <#> But uhm <,> yeah<S1A-092$B> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1A-092$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-092$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-092$B> <#> Is she doing just private then <,> in in the evening<S1A-092$A> <#> Huh<S1A-092$B> <#> Is she doing just private in the evening<S1A-092$A> <#> I think so yeah<S1A-092$B> <#> And then all day Saturday apparently<S1A-092$A> <#> Yeah <#> I think so <#> Seems strange<S1A-092$B> <#> Yeah <#> Mightn't look good on a employment record <,> <{> <[> as well </[><S1A-092$A> <#> <[> No <#> I </[> </{> I <,> kind of think that she isn't really making the most of it anymore <#> That she 's just kind of staying there cos that 's what 's familiar <#> <{> <[> Do you </[> know what I mean<S1A-092$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{></I>
