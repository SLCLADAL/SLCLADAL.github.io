<S1A-059 Glasses 1><I><S1A-059$B> <#> Nice hot chocolate<S1A-059$A> <#> Pardon<S1A-059$B> <#> I think I 'm going to make myself some really nice hot chocolate<S1A-059$A> <#> That sounds very nice<S1A-059$B> <#> With marshmallows on the top <,> yum <#> Would you like a cup of tea<S1A-059$A> <#> Uh <,> no thank-you<S1A-059$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> Okay coffee<S1A-059$A> <#> No <,> nothing at the moment thank-you<S1A-059$B> <#> Do you know where I first heard about putting the marshmallows on the top<S1A-059$A> <#> Where<S1A-059$B> <#> I was in this restaurant in town <,> and they had hot chocolate <,> and <,> they charged you an extra fifty pence <,> if you wanted marshmallows on the top<S1A-059$A> <#> Better off to buy your own <#> You 'd have about <,> twenty portions <,> of marshmallows <#> <{> <[> Put them in your <.> pocke </.> </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> We bought some there <[> </{> <#> We bought some there today and it was sixty-nine p for<S1A-059$A> <#> A packet<S1A-059$B> <#> A packet yeah <#> It 's no laugh<S1A-059$A> <#> Well you 'd have about ten marshmallow portions <{> <[> in that packet </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Oh but it 's groovy </[> </{> <#> It 's lovely<S1A-059$A> <#> Mm<S1A-059$B> <#> Oh it 's lovely<S1A-059$A> <#> Would you turn off the television Maura <#> <{> <[> I </[> can hear it in here<S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Mmm </[> </{><S1A-059$B> <#> That 's your problem <#> You don't like watching the box<S1A-059$A> <#> I don't mind watching the box but not on a permanent basis <,> like your sister does<S1A-059$B> <#> What do you mean you don't like watching the box <#> I love watching the box <#> I love watching soaps <,> and uh <&> coughs </&> what else do I like <#> I like <,> I don't actually watch that much <#> <{> <[> But </[> what I do watch I really enjoy <#> I watch soaps and I watch things like what Beverley Hills Cop nine-o-two-one-o and that kind of thing but I mean <,> apart from that I know <,> I 'm certainly not glued to it<S1A-059$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1A-059$A> <#> The ones I like are ones like Last of the Summer Wine <,> uhm <,> you know that one where <,> it 's a very posh lady <,> Keeping up Appearances<S1A-059$B> <#> Don't like <{> <[> that </[><S1A-059$A> <#> <[> And I like </[> </{> <#> You used to love Spitting Image<S1A-059$B> <#> Don't like that anymore<S1A-059$A> <#> Well last week <.> the </.> I think they were going to have Michael Jackson <{> <[> and </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Lisa Presley </[> </{><S1A-059$A> <#> Yes<S1A-059$B> <#> What a combo <#> Wonder will it last<S1A-059$A> <#> I wonder if they 're married at all<S1A-059$B> <#> Oh yeah <#> Oh yeah I 'd say so<S1A-059$A> <#> So we 're told at any rate<S1A-059$B> <#> No they wouldn't get away with that kind of thing <#> They wouldn't be getting away with it I mean <#> They <,> they wouldn't be getting away with all the appearances and all the <,> you know all the uh kind of show and everything <#> They 're definitely married <#> I 'd say so<S1A-059$A> <#> Maybe maybe <#> I wrote a letter to Simon today for Christmas<S1A-059$B> <#> Did you<S1A-059$A> <#> Because I don't think he 'll be over before <#> Would you consider writing <#> He 's been very good to you<S1A-059$B> <#> I 've written a letter<S1A-059$A> <#> Have you<S1A-059$B> <#> Yeah last week<S1A-059$A> <#> Right well I 'll get Pat to post mine tomorrow<S1A-059$B> <#> He 's coming over for Christmas<S1A-059$A> <#> No he won't be over before Christmas <,> so I 've written the letter to them<S1A-059$B> <#> Oh right okay <#> Yeah <#> Anyway how are your glasses <,> <&> cough </&> working out<S1A-059$A> <#> Very <.> prob </.> problematic<S1A-059$B> <#> Hmm <#> Well<S1A-059$A> <#> I find it difficult with the two different sights in the glasses <#> <{> <[> You feel </[> that you 're going to fall down when you look down which is the reading part<S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-059$B> <#> What you have the bifocals<S1A-059$A> <#> Yeah <,> and you look up and it 's for ordinary outdoor walking or driving whatever<S1A-059$B> <#> Well <,> I find with my glasses now mine aren't bifocal like yours are <#> Aren't they bifocal <#> They are <#> Mine aren't bifocal but <,> I find like that <,> if you wear if they 're for reading and you wear them out <,> there 's <,> I don't know it 's sort of like uhm <,> they 're uncomfortable <#> Your sight is uncomfortable<S1A-059$A> <#> Wearing spectacles is definitely <,> a problem<S1A-059$B> <#> Why<S1A-059$A> <#> Ah <,> I keep losing mine <#> I 've three pairs now<S1A-059$B> <#> You 're the only one I know <,> who keeps losing their glasses <#> I don't know how you manage <,> <&> laughter </&> I don't know how you manage to lose them so much<S1A-059$A> <#> I 'll do like Anna Fitzgibbon and I 'll get myself one of those things <,> you hang around your neck and the glasses hang on <#> The only problem is I 'd need three of those<S1A-059$B> <#> That 's a waste of time <#> Really is <#> You know I mean <,> what you have to do is just <,> if you had the one pair <,> probably wouldn't lose them<S1A-059$A> <#> Well I 've all sorts of problems which are too deep <,> and too long-winded to go into now <{> <[> like </[> watching television <#> If I lie on the couch I can't see<S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Oh yeah </[> </{><S1A-059$B> <#> What<S1A-059$A> <#> If I 'm watching television and I lie on the couch with my varifocal glasses I can't see <{> <[> I 'm </[> uncomfortable<S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <,><S1A-059$A> <#> And then if I go to look for my ordinary glasses for watching television I seemed to have misplaced them<S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <,> well I don't lose mine at all <#> But then again now I only bring them into college <,> so <,> you can't really go too wrong <,> can you<S1A-059$A> <#> Well talking about eyes and teeth <,> I think it 's about time you went for an appointment to the dentist<S1A-059$B> <#> Okay <,> <{> <[> I haven't </[> I went last no actually <,> I don't think it is <#> I went last <,> around the time of summer <#> I went in <,> September and thankfully there was nothing wrong <#> Actually <,> I 'll tell you what <,> I haven't had a filling <,> since I 'd say two years now<S1A-059$A> <#> <[> It 's </[> </{><S1A-059$A> <#> I didn't know you went in September <#> I know there was a bill in for June which you were disputing <,> and I asked the dentist about it and they said you had definitely been<S1A-059$B> <#> Did you see the hygienist<S1A-059$A> <#> Yes<S1A-059$B> <#> What did she say<S1A-059$A> <#> She just cleaned my <{> <[> teeth </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> She she </[> </{> didn't say anything <#> She scraped your teeth<S1A-059$A> <#> This week when I went to the dentist he said I 'd nothing to have done either <#> He said I was doing remarkably well considering it was two years since I 'd been with him<S1A-059$B> <#> That 's crazy <#> Barmy <#> Ah no no in all fairness now I only go about once every <,> eight months <#> About once every eight months<S1A-059$A> <#> Ah sure that 's enough I think really <#> You haven't had any problem at all with your teeth <#> <{1> <[1> Eithne 's supposed to go </[1> Eithne 's supposed to go down to uh Garret Fitzwilliam about hers <#> And she 's just putting it on the long finger <#> I mean he may have <{2> <[2> the answer for her </[2><S1A-059$B> <#> <[1> I have about five fillings </[1> </{1><S1A-059$B> <#> <[2> She was supposed </[2> </{2> to go down <#> Oh she 's <,> last night<S1A-059$A> <#> Well she made no effort <,><S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <#> Well it 's her business <,><S1A-059$A> <#> It is her business to a point <#> The only thing is that she 's<S1A-059$B> <#> It 's her business completely<S1A-059$A> <#> <.> Sh </.> <,> well if they get really bad and she has to have a lot of work done on them your father 's paying for them cos she doesn't have enough PRSI contributions <#> By the way talking about PRSI contributions did you organise your tax rebate<S1A-059$B> <#> No<S1A-059$A> <#> Well well lucky for you you 're so wealthy you don't have to bother<S1A-059$B> <#> There 's only a bit I have left to do <#> Not too much longer<S1A-059$A> <#> Not too <{> <[> much longer for what </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Ah but it 'll be </[> </{> <,><S1A-059$B> <#> It 'll be groovy to be getting all my money in for a change <,> cos I 've been paying so much tax <#> It 's not funny at all<S1A-059$A> <#> Well basically it 's your own fault<S1A-059$B> <#> Well it is my own fault <#> But I mean <,> it 's it 's you know it 's a stupid system that the tax office don't cop on that I 'm only earning twenty pounds a week <,> and they insist on charging forty-eight percent tax on it<S1A-059$A> <#> Well that 's the way they work emergency tax <#> And that 's to make you <{> <[> get your affairs in order </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> What exactly is </[> </{> emergency tax anyway<S1A-059$A> <#> Exactly what you you 're paying<S1A-059$B> <#> But why do they call it emergency<S1A-059$A> <#> You pay<S1A-059$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> <,><S1A-059$A> <#> Emergency tax <,> when you haven't got your tax free allowances in order <#> And it makes you go all the faster to <{> <[> go and get it </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> So </[> </{> emergency means quick to the tax Revenue Commissioner 's office and get your tax <{> <[> free allowance </[><S1A-059$A> <#> <[> And full and full </[> </{> amount<S1A-059$B> <#> Full amount <#> Oh cos you end up paying forty-eight percent anyway <#> Well that 's what I 'm on at the moment <,> and I really do think it 's crazy <,> absolutely crazy<S1A-059$A> <#> Are you working on Sunday night<S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <,> no <#> I 've got Vivian to do it for me <,> which is just as well <#> <{> <[> <,> Cos I can't keep working </[> that much <#> Quite sufficient <#> It 's absolutely perfect<S1A-059$A> <#> <[> Yeah one night a week is quite sufficient for you to work </[> </{><S1A-059$A> <#> It 's ridiculous if you would even consider working any more than that<S1A-059$B> <#> Yeah it is you see <#> And I told <,> the manager that I couldn't work <,> uh <,> more than the one night a week you know <#> So <,> he uh he said yeah fine <#> And of course <,> he 's a bit of head like a sieve <,> and it went in one ear and out the next <#> And the next week sure wasn't I on <,> wasn't I on the two nights <#> You know it 's crazy really I mean if you can't remember that kind of thing <#> I mean that 's what the manager 's there for<S1A-059$A> <#> Maura you 're a little insignificant person in their eyes<S1A-059$B> <#> There 's only twenty of us twenty-five of us in the bar <#> I 'm twenty I 'm one twenty-fifth of the whole bar<S1A-059$A> <#> What about all the other people on the staff<S1A-059$B> <#> Well they 're the other twenty-four <&> laughter </&> <#> The team works together <#> The bar works together and <,> you know we<S1A-059$A> <#> You 're talking rubbish <#> You 're so <,> insignificant <#> You do about <{> <[> six hours work </[><S1A-059$B> <#> <[> I do my best </[> </{><S1A-059$A> <#> Six hours work per week<S1A-059$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> Some day <,> some day I might do more <#> I might do more during my summer after my block <#> Actually I don't know what I 'm going to do for this summer <,> cos I just can't decide what I 'm going to do <#> I mean it 's not even near the summer now but like<S1A-059$A> <#> Earn heaps of money and pay for your fees for your final year<S1A-059$B> <#> Make my millions <,> yeah <#> Ah well then you never know<S1A-059$A> <#> You see that Listermint<S1A-059$B> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><S1A-059$A> <#> <[> And Ponds Cream </[> </{> <#> <{> <[> Now when </[> you 're going upstairs would you bring them up with you please <,> because I 'm tired of rubbish being left around the kitchen<S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Yeah <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1A-059$A> <#> Okay<S1A-059$B> <#> <{> <[> Okay </[><S1A-059$A> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{> <&> laughter </&><S1A-059$B> <#> That 's all I get is okay<S1A-059$A> <#> Will you please take those silly curlers out of your hair <&> laughter </&> <#> You do that and you 've a perm I don't understand<S1A-059$B> <#> The perm makes me look like Shirley Temple<S1A-059$A> <#> Yeah she 's young and cute but <#> What what else do you want <&> laughter </&> <#> Well ah<S1A-059$B> <#> Well I 've got to have my hair nice for tonight<S1A-059$A> <#> Tonight 's the big night<S1A-059$B> <#> Yep<S1A-059$A> <#> Ah yeah it should be good fun <#> I 'll probably just sit in and <.> re </.> recover tonight<S1A-059$B> <#> I beg your
