<S1B-055 Multi-party talks 2><I><S1B-055$A> <#> Mr Chairman <,> I rise to uh support our party 's amendment and I also would like to say Mr Chairman I not like many other people I don't believe that we have peace <#> I believe we 're still in a state of war <#> We 're not fighting the IRA or the <.> Pro </.> Protestant paramilitaries are not using their weapons the way that they used to use them but they 're using other techniques which is still going on in our province <#> And in the area that I represent there 's still many people beat up and uh or persecuted because they don't toe the line <#> And we all know that within the two political parties the uhm the PUP and the UDP there 's still not unity amongst them in their ranks and we know that there 's hard feelings against their leaders and what they 're trying to achieve here and that 's why we have the the the heaval amongst them today because many of them believe that they 're going down the the the wrong road <#> Now I believe in democracy <#> Unfortunately <,> uh Mr Chairman as we all uh uh did not agree to this form of election that the British Government have apposed upon us <,> we had no other or way to get out of it only fight this election on the uh the way the British Government allowed us to <#> Unfortunately <,> I <.> me </.> I mean I must rebuke Hugh Smyth <#> He keeps telling us that he topped the poll <#> He didn't top the poll at all <#> He only got one thousand nine hundred votes <#> Now you had you had to be about on the ground that day because if you had to go out on the Shankill Road the two paramilitary wings you had that many people on the ground uh nobody could else could move <,> and yet they did not achieve the vote they 'd expected <#> When I seen them I said <,> I said to the my workers <,> boy well they 'll have about four thousand votes the two <#> The whole five of them <,> all my five workers <#> I 'm not <,> I 'm being honest about it <#> My five workers <#> And uh and all that the team that they had <#> And the big fancy cars and vans and so on <#> I don't know where they got the money from like <#> But <,> let me say this <,> and yet they did not achieve what they want <#> The Democratic Unionist Party came second with seventeen hundred votes <#> Pretty good <,> comparing it with only a small number of people out working and couldn't get all the people that we want <#> The Ulster Unionists got fourteen hundred <#> The big UDA we all talk about only got eight hundred votes <,> with all their fancy <&> boos from Members </&> fancy posters and so forth<S1B-055$B> <#> Will the speaker give way<S1B-055$A> <#> No I 'm not giving way<S1B-055$C> <#> Are <,> are we getting to the point<S1B-055$A> <#> I never I never interrupted anybody all day <&> laughter </&> <#> I was a very good a very good wee boy <{> <[1> and </[1> listened to everybody <#> <{> <[2> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[2><S1B-055$C> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{> <S1B-055$C> <#> <[2> Mr <,> Mr <,> Mr Smyth <,> the <,> </[2> </{2> Mr Smyth the election was on the thirtieth of May <#> Today is the fourth of October <#> Could we stick <{> <[> to today </[> <S1B-055$A> <#> <[> We 're told </[> </{> we 're told Chairman that the Shankill is the heartline of the paramilitary <{1> <[1> stronghold </[1> <#> That is nonsense as it 's been said <,> because the vote shows it <,> that over three thousand three hundred voted for the democratic parties and only two thousand seven hundred <{2> <[2> voted </[2> for these other people<S1B-055$X> <#> <[1> Nonsense </[1> </{1><S1B-055$X> <#> <[2> What about Gerry Adams </[2> </{2><S1B-055$A> <#> Well I 'm not worrying Gerry uh Gerry Adams <#> Gerry Adams is <,> you know where I stand where Gerry Adams is concerned <#> Well let me tell you Chairman <#> Let us be honest <#> I have been under the boot to these fellas <#> There 's a man sitting there behind me there <,> had to come to my house and protest <#> That 's the type of democratic voting he talked about <#> And I laugh when I see some of them on the TV who I helped to get bungalows and houses and some of them when they were arrested in jail were glad of my reference to help them get them out <#> And some of them even <,> some of them even sent some of them even sent for me to bail them out bail them out <#> But what they but them people tell me they were under threat <#> They were told they had to be there <#> But listen <,> Chairman <,> they 've no consent about uh uh uh my wife and my <,> my little <,> my two handicapped children which them thugs were outside my house spitting and kicking my door at that day <#> Well that 's the type of thing we 're talking about <#> Well we must give these people the <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> IRA <#> Now the people of Northern Ireland have spoken <#> The British Government made this election to suit these people <#> They were up in Stormont for months beforehand uh talking uh <,> to anything <#> They were making deals <#> And what happened was that the British Government didn't come across with the deal and the poor men behind the bars today are the ones that suffered and are suffering because the deals did not come across<S1B-055$X> <#> Nonsense<S1B-055$A> <#> And so therefore these people have let them down because they 've looked after themselves <#> And let me tell you this uh Mr Chairman <,> that people <,> I shouldn't even be here today<S1B-055$X> <#> That 's true<S1B-055$A> <#> Because democratically th' election is not right <#> The people <.> sh </.> <.> hood </.> be here is the people who got the vote and passed the the the quota and should be elected in here <#> Now in saying that <,> I would 've been here if I had 've stood in North Belfast where I should 've stooden <#> But <,> but I decided<S1B-055$C> <#> Mr Smyth this is most entertaining but it 's it 's getting it 's getting a little far away from from the uh from supporting your party 's motion which <{> <[> we 're coming very close to </[> <S1B-055$A> <#> <[> Can I say this </[> </{> Can I say this <#> That the people of Northern Ireland have spoken <#> They have said <,> and we 're the only party have made it very clear that we 're <,> were at war for decommission <,> made it very clear to the voters in my area in which I stand up and stood at that election and our people voted according to their conscience and the people say <,> we want the guns off the streets and we want a democratic politics to work in Northern Ireland <,> and that 's what the people have said in this election <#> But unfortunately <,> unfortunately the British Government and the E/ire Government and other people who who tell the people one thing and then change their mind and do another <,> they are the ones <,> they are the ones who are going to bring this process to a <.> s </.> a a halt <,> not us <#> For we have made it clear where we stand <#> Now I believe when peace will come <,> in righteousness and truth<S1B-055$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-055$A> <#> I believe <,> peace will come when men confess <#> I know men who 're doing time today because they were converted and came to Christ and gave themselves up because of the crime that they have <,> uh have committed <#> And you 're going to tell me as our <,> some of our colleagues have mentioned of policemen and Army people today who are standing with are <.> s </.> are with no arms <,> no legs <,> part of their bodies blown up <,> shot and so forth and them people are saying <,> oh keep your guns <#> We want peace on them terms <#> And everybody knows we remember it during the War and I wasn't there <#> I wasn't even born probably <#> But I remember reading and we were told that the Prime Minister come with a bit of paper <,> <quote> Germany will not attack </quote> <,> <#> And they did attack <#> And what we 're saying is the <.> Le </.> <.> La </.> Labour Party telling us that <,> oh we 'll give these people their way and there 'll be peace <,> <#> For how long Chairman <#> Another ten fifteen years <#> Then our children and our grandchildren will see the same thing that we have suffered for twenty-six year in this province because we have a weak government who will not deal with the men of violence and put them out of the systems and out of the road and let the true good honest <.> Up </.> Ulster people live in peace both Roman Catholic and <.> Protes </.> who wants to live and get on with <.> th </.> their lives in this province <#> Now the Labour Party said earlier<S1B-055$X> <#> Does that does that include the Labour Party<S1B-055$A> <#> The Labour Party said earlier that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> But he must be to blame <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> he 's a lot older than me <#> He 's one of the causes then that he has created in this province for the like of me who knew nothing about it til I was born and reared into the Province <,> of the the the Troubles of this country <#> But the <.> pro </.> the trouble of this country has not been made by us <#> It 's been made by those who are enemies against the British way of life in this land and so there Mr Chairman we cannot allow<S1B-055$D> <#> That 's a very sweeping statement<S1B-055$C> <#> Are you giving way to Mr Casey<S1B-055$D> <#> Seeing as this is being recorded I 'd like to know what I 've done that I 'm the cause of all this <&> unclear simultaneous speech between $A and $D, muffled by noise from Members </&><S1B-055$C> <#> Read the rules and see that when the Chairman is standing everybody sits down <#> Sit down<S1B-055$?> <#> Sit down<S1B-055$C> <#> And sit down Mr Smyth too <#> It 's that kind of scene which I 'm not going to live with <#> As long as I 'm Chairman and I 'm only Chairman here as long as seventy-five percent of you don't vote me out <,> I will not have that kind of altercation taking place <#> You have one more minute Mr Smyth<S1B-055$A> <#> Thank-you Chairman<S1B-055$X> <#> Sit down <&> simultaneous and unclear </&><S1B-055$C> <#> Right Mr Smyth <#> You 've one more minute<S1B-055$A> <#> Mr Chairman uh uh could I explain myself <#> Sorry Chairman I want to explain myself<S1B-055$C> <#> One more minute that 's all<S1B-055$A> <#> What I what I meant was his generation before my generation herited and passed it on <#> That 's what I am saying <#> And he didn't deal with it in his day so he needn't accuse our generation today when their generation didn't deal with it either <#> That 's what we 're saying <#> Mr <{> <[> Chairman </[> let me say this <#> The people that I represent <,> have made it very clear to me and I live on the Shankill and I walk up and down it and I meet all sorts of people <,> from Ulster Unionists <,> from the <.> par </.> paramilitaries <,> and I may not agree with them but I 've some good friends and I respect them and they tell me that they don't want to go back to them days and they 're prepared to give up their weapons if their leadership would only lead them and say <,> we 're giving them up and we 're going to go in to democratic politics and do what the people want <#> It 's about time that the politicians listened to their people <#> And that 's what we did at our party <#> We 're here representing the views of the people and we will not change our minds but we believe that the guns must go for the future of our country<S1B-055$X> <#> </[> Thank-you very much </[> </{><S1B-055$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-055$C> <#> Mr Peter Robinson what I 'm now going to do is to call the three last speakers <,> who will be who from the Alliance <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <,> Mr Robinson <,> Lord Alderdice and Mr uh Mr Taylor to make the final speeches and then we 'll go to voting on a motion which will require a sixty-six percent vote <,> uh and will be uh in terms of Rule thirteen-one <,> the famous Rule thirteen-one <#> Mr Robinson<S1B-055$E> <#> On a point of order sir are you calling both amendments<S1B-055$C> <#> Yes<S1B-055$E> <#> Thank-you<S1B-055$F> <#> Mr Chairman uh I was uh only a a young lad of seventeen when what is euphemistically described as the Troubles began uh in Northern Ireland <#> Uh indeed uh I can recall uh that I had a lot more interest in a a young girl who was only a few months younger than me than I had <.> i </.> <.> i </.> in politics <#> Uh I had uh no interest in politics at all uh until a young friend of mine was killed by the Provisional IRA <,> and it was that action which jolted me uh towards politics and provided the incentive uh and the reason why I entered the political process <#> Uh I grew up in an area where the Provisional IRA almost on a a weekly basis uh would come in <,> leave a car bomb outside somebody 's home uh <,> or go in and shoot someone until eventually people in that area uh like uh areas throughout Belfast as a whole <,> but the Province in general uh used to put vigilantes out on the streets to protect their own areas <#> Uh along with many others uh I stood and uh gave up my sleep to stand on the barricades with the vigilantes in my area to stop IRA incursions uh into the district <#> And eventually those vigilantes uh became more organised informed and eventually became some of the paramilitary organisations that we have in our Province <#> And many of the people uh who stood along with me at those barricades uh chose the path of going into paramilitary organisations <#> So I come from a background which understands how many people entered into those Loyalist paramilitary organisations <,> and I can recognise all too clearly that if there had not been the violence of the Provisional IRA <,> or if on the other hand there had been proper and effective measures taken by our government <,> and not just the Conservative and Labour governments but even before that <,> the Ulster Unionist government at Stormont <,> if there had been those effective measures I don't believe we would have had the spectre of Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland</I>
