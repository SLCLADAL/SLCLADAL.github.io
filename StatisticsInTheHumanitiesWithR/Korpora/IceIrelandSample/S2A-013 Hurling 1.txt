<S2A-013 Hurling 1><I><S2A-013$A> <#> Kelly winning the duel there against <,> George O'Connor <#> Advancing <,> by ten metres <#> Good solo run <#> Looking for the last shot now half stopped by Sean Flood <#> Good call by Ted Morrison the goal keeper who came and gathered <,> towards Dermot Prendergast 's wing over there with Hubert Rigney <#> Liam Dunne again <#> He 's having a marvellous match <#> Sean Wickham <,> bidding to keep that ball in play <#> Did so successfully <#> Now Michael Duignan exerting more and more of an influence <,> on the contest round the centre of the field <#> That 's Johnny Pilkington let inside there <#> It 's a brilliant goal <,> <#> Daithi Regan <,> got the final touch <,> after Pilkington delivered the pass inside <#> A lovely piece of wrist action <#> And Offaly get the opening goal of the match <#> Well that 's the kind of goal that Jimmy Barry Murphy was scoring not too long ago <#> I remember one particular match an All Ireland Semi-Final something similar happened <#> Martin Storey on his left-hand side <#> A cross intended for Gary Prendergast <#> Instead it reaches Roy Mannion again <,> tapping it neatly outside <#> Johnny Pilkington brilliantly knocked down <,> by Billy Byrne <#> Runs on to Eamon Sinnott <#> Trying to link up unsuccessfully <#> Links up with Jimmy Houlihan <#> Outside towards Martin Storey <#> It 's just tailing in <,> a nice point <,> a measured build-up <#> For a moment there I thought they were going to take a little bit too <,> long with the build-up <,> but in the end Storey pointed brilliantly<S2A-013$B> <#> That was an excellent point Ger and uh <,> it 's one that Wexford needed badly to keep in touch I think <#> They 've got all the game in the middle of the field and uh <,> they 're all trying <#> Jimmy Houlihan 's moving forward out the field now and try and get more of the play<S2A-013$A> <#> And there 's Storey then with that neat point <,> good distance out <#> And indeed you 'll have noted there in that replay that Houlihan <.> pr </.> picked up an injury <#> Johnny <,> one of the great campaigners <,> denied space over there <,> but recovers well <#> Already picked up two All Ireland medals in eighty-one and eighty-five and runs on neatly to Michael Duignan <#> And it 's over the bar <#> That 's a second point of the match for the St Rynagh 's player <#> Sean Wickham picking it up here <,> <#> Oops <,> doesn't get another chance <#> Roy Mannion really sticking to his <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Leech <#> Across it goes to Martin Storey <#> And Jim Troy is happy and content to see that one go up his stick and up and over the crossbar <#> Martin Storey <,> takes the credit his second point of the game <#> Niall McDonald <#> Sean Flood having some work to do to get under that one <#> In the end it <,> falls favourably for Johnny Pilkington <#> Danny Owen 's got a lovely pickup <,> about thirty metres out <#> Hooks splendidly <#> Over there by Billy Byrne recovers <,> looking for a bit of support <,> finding it from Michael Duignan <#> And that 's the first point to Offaly of the second half <,> <#> Duignan with his third score of the game <,><#> Billy Byrne trying to gather <,> runs on to Dermot Prendergast <,> trying to go by the challenge of Hubert Rigney <#> Just struck a little bit of freedom in there <,> and passed inside <#> George O'Connor maintained the hand passing movement outside to Martin Storey <#> Now he can he complete the movement <#> It 's gone over the bar <#> There were about three hand passes up right across the face of the goal <,> before it eventually reached uh <,> Martin Storey <,> and he got the third point<S2A-013$B> <#> It 's a traditional <.> Wex </.> Wexford score a lot of hand passes as I say Ger out to Martin Storey <#> And he 's been quite impressive when he 's got a chances and again took an excellent score there<S2A-013$A> <#> So each side then having made one change in the <,> forward lines from their starting formations <#> That 's Brian Whelehan half blocked down by Tom Dempsey <#> Martin Storey <,> having got three points in the match so far <#> Ball was touched on the ground <,> and Willy Horgan nipping in quickly <#> In fact he 's going to throw the ball in <#> A disappointed Mark Corrigan looks on <#> And while all that 's happening it 's gone over the bar <#> And it 's John Conran who 's put it over the bar <#> The sub who came on has got his first point <#> George O'Connor again trying to <,> pick this ball up <#> Johnny Dooley working beaverishly hard in the centre <#> Joaquim Kelly likewise <,> trying to go by Sean Flood <#> Tapped forward by Brian Whelehan seemed to have picked up an injuries with <,> playing that ball forward initially <#> And the man lying down <,> needing attention is Joaquim Kelly <,> <#> We mentioned clean catches just a moment ago <#> Our <.> t </.> statistics show that uh Wexford lead in the clean catching department by thirteen four <#> That 's in all sectors of the field <#> So a free then <,> which Johnny Dooley is preparing to take <#> Stopped by Ted Morrissey <#> It 's gone in <#> The second goal for Daithi Regan <#> He scored the first after twenty minutes <#> This latest one has come <,> eighteen minutes into the second half <,><S2A-013$A> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> needing a bit of support still lines being closed down repeatedly and <,> it 's finally <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Kerry gets away only as far as the other midfielder for Clare James Shanahan shuffled outside to Tommy Guilfoyle <#> From a tricky angle Tommy restores Clare 's advantage <#> That 's three points now for <,> Tommy Guilfoyle in this match <,> points set up by the two midfielders <#> In it goes <,> and <,> pursuing it in there was Pat Heffernan <#> Good clearance under pressure by John Russell <#> Only out as far as Garry Kirby <#> Snappy little shot by Garry Kirby <,> over the crossbar <#> Five points his contribution <#> Limerick in front <,> <#> Declan Nash <,> towards Terence Kenny <,> with an exaggerated leap and in the end he failed to hold on to it <,> but there 's a gap <#> Garry Kirby 's there and he 's drilled it over the crossbar <#> And it 's Limerick now with a two-point lead <#> Kirby 's got the last couple of scores <,,><S2A-013$B> <#> Oh he 's very very accurate Ger and give him half a chance anywhere <,> inside a goal he doesn't miss too many chances <#> A lot of the Clare <.> for </.> half backs might clear the ball but they 're leaving the half forwards very very loose with the result that Limerick have now stretched into a three point lead <#> They have a strong breeze behind them they 're looking good<S2A-013$A> <#> Half cut out <,> followed up by Mike Galligan <#> Well this is a critical time in the match for Clare <,> likewise for Limerick <,> because they 've begun to assert themselves <#> And they 've really dominated the exchanges now in the last ten minutes <,> Galligan with his fifth point of the game <#> Ciaran Cary <,> to take that one well out of the danger area <#> A pass up towards Pat Heffernan <,> against Anthony Daly <#> Across <,> brilliantly taken by Galligan <#> Oh that 's a hard won point <#> This is much more like it now from Limerick <,> a pale shadow of their real selves in the first half <#> Accredit that to Clare <#> Ciaran Cary <,> racing forward looking for his first point of the second half <,> hooked splendidly by John Chaplin recovers however <#> He 's got support from Gary Kirby <#> Well that 's a star-studded performance by Gary Kirby in the second half <#> He 's contributed nine points in all <#> Mike Guilfoyle <,> running through the centre <,> to Duffy <#> Hitting it low and Tommy <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> And it 's a goal <,> a goal by Duffy <#> It 's come <,> with eight and a half minutes to go <#> Well what a late finish we 're going to have now to this one<S2A-013$B> <#> It 's a very good goal by Michael Duffy <,> <#> Just gathers it here on to his right hand <#> Hits a low <.> h </.> hard shot <#> Always difficult for a goal keeper <,> the hard ground <#> I think Joe O'Connor puts the Tommy Quaid off there and it bounds into the net <#> And <,> it 's going to be a very close finish now I think<S2A-013$A> <#> Clare with perhaps another chance <,,> got out on this occasion by Mike <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <,> who 's <,> had a storming game in the middle of the field <#> <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S2A-013$B> <#> <[> Clare player was unlucky there </[> </{><S2A-013$B> <#> He just fell over more than anything else but he definitely appealed it <#> And it 's probably <,> a bit harsh <#> But uh <,> Limerick a vital free for Limerick at this stage they were just hanging on <#> And it 's anybody 's game if they get this one <,> just the breathing space they need<S2A-013$A> <#> A minute remaining <#> Gary Kirby <,> who 's contributed nine points in all in this match <,> wind supported <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> That 's point number ten for Gary Kirby <,> who really has been the star of the show from Limerick 's point of view <#> Mike Guilfoyle blocked down brilliantly by Ger Hegarty <#> He 's given them a steely resolve in mid-field since coming in <#> That was a master substitution <,,><S2A-013$B> <#> They they know it well <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> and like now if they were going to have him in midfield Ger and I thought this <,> maybe this was something Clare could have tried <#> He was getting very little of the ball into him and uh <.> s </.> Clare they were lucky to get another score but the ball simply didn't come to them I thought they might have thought of that a bit earlier<S2A-013$A> <#> Duffy <,> the goal scorer across the face of the goal once again <,> drops down here <,,> <#> Hit in uh Tommy Quaid <#> Sees that one go over from Cyril Lyons <#> A point <,> they were looking for the goal <,><S2A-013$A> <#> In towards P J Cuddy it runs on however towards John Fitzpatrick who had such a good game against Wexford last year <#> Ted Morrissey <#> Martin Storey losing the helm at that time and there 's a foul <,> by George O'Connor on uh Niall Rigby <#> That 's going to be some battle in the middle of the field two big strong men<S2A-013$B> <#> Yes indeed and uh in the League Final George O'Connor played with an injury I think in fairness <#> And he wasn't seen at his best but <,> it should be good clash there today <#> Two very big strong men <,> and uh both very important players for their teams <,><S2A-013$A> <#> Rigney the free taker <#> Still no score on the boards <#> In towards PJ Cuddy <#> Seem to be held by Ger Cushe <#> The ball has trickled on and it 's gone in <#> An amazing goal <#> That is an amazing score <#> Only two minutes gone <,> and Laois <,> have gone in front<S2A-013$B> <#> It 's an extraordinary goal <#> As the ball lands in the square <,> it 's a high dropping free right in on top of the square <#> And P J Cuddy certainly seemed to be held by the full back Gerald Cushe <#> And as luck would have it it bounced <,> in towards Ted Morrissey <#> You see just being held there by Phil Dockery <,> Ted Morrissey advanced to meet him <#> Ran off his hurley <,> and just rolled over the line <#> And the umpire was on the spot <,> quick as a flash to give a goal<S2A-013$A> <#> Mickey Sullivan challenging against George O'Connor <#> Georgie making the interception <#> Andy Dunne has missed it <#> It 's run on to John O'Connor <#> Normally we 'd expect to see him at half back <#> To Eamon Sinnott <#> Oh good vision by Sinnott <,> spotting that Martin Storey was unmarked <#> And they 're transferring it into a score now <#> Not on this occasion <#> That 's Cyril Duggan making the <,> intervention <#> Storey again <#> He 's starting so impressively <,> great athleticism <,> good drive and dash <#> On to Jimmy Houlihan <#> And it 's a goal <#> The old one two out of Storey and Houlihan <,> rewarded with a fine goal <,> after eight minutes</I>
