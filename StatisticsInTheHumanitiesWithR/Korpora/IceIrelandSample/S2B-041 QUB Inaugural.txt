<S2B-041 QUB Inaugural><I><S2B-041$A> <#> Don't know why I poured that I won't be able to drink it <#> Vice Chancellor <,> Mrs Beveridge <,> Dean <,> thank-you for your gracious introduction <,> my family and friends <,> colleagues <,> ladies and gentlemen <#> As I sat in front of a blank computer screen the other evening <,> having postponed this joyous occasion for as long as was joy as decently possible <,> I was forcefully reminded of the wise words of Richard Whately <,> the Archbishop of Dublin when this university was in its infancy <,> <quote> preach not because you have to say something but only if you have something to say </quote> <#> This admonition still troubles me I don't mind telling you <#> When I was at school <,> for one reason or another <,> I always seemed to be doing my homework <,> going down the Falls Road in the bus in the mornings <#> I remember well saying to myself <,> it won't be like this when I go to Queen 's <#> When that time duly came and I daily took the bus down the Donegall Road I still seemed to be scrambling to prepare for my tutorials in the mornings on the bus <#> Well I didn't exactly write it coming down in the car but uh enough said <#> Apart from telling you something about me and my recent difficulty <,> this little story illustrates well a truism about people that fits well into the main philosophical part of my lecture later <#> <quote> old habits die hard </quote> <#> I 've attended many inaugural lectures over the years <,> and I 've observed from this habit that there 're are almost as many styles of inaugural lecture as there are lecturers <#> So what do I have to say <#> I propose to speak under three headings <#> First I want to take this opportunity as is traditional <,> to acknowledge some of my many debts <#> Secondly <,> I 'm going to try to communicate my understanding of the enterprise of philosophy as I practise it myself and as I try to inculcate it in my students <#> And finally <,> all too briefly <,> I 'm going to do some philosophy and offer a brief analysis of the topics <.> lis </.> listed in the title from a philosophical point of view <#> First my debts <#> I 'm very aware that I didn't get to be standing up here today without the support of many people <#> And <,> dangerous and invidious though it is <,> I 'd like to single a few of them out <#> To begin with the obvious <,> it 's practically impossible to succeed in academic life these days such are the pressures to pursue research and publish <,> while all the time implementing the government 's insane demands to achieve more and more so-called efficiency gains without neglecting one 's partner and family <#> If it is possible by the way will somebody please let me in on the secret <#> It 's no accident that for several centuries <,> many uh most academics were almost exclusively celibate clerics <#> My long-suffering wife Jean and my children Martin and Eleanor of whom I 'm immensely proud have suffered this neglect with great patience <,> and I wish to record publicly my gratitude for their unfailing support for me and my work <#> During my undergraduate days at Queen 's one larger-than-life figure stands out <#> Father Theodore Crowley was a Franciscan friar and the University 's first professor of Scholastic Philosophy who introduced me in my first year to the pleasures of both <&French> la vie intellectuelle </&French> and equally importantly Nuits-St George <,> St E/milion and other nectarious libations <&> laughter </&> <#> I remember Theodore with deep affection for his love of scholarship and for his irrepressed irrepressible sense of impish fun <#> When later he became my first Head of Department I well remember him saying <,> I don't mind what area of philosophy you work in as long as you do it well <,> and try to publish two articles a year <#> I was fortunate enough to have several outstanding teachers at the University of Michigan <,> including Andreas Papandreou who later made a name for himself in a number of ways <,> Firthjof Bergmann and Alan Wood <#> They all went out of their way to help me and each of them was in his own way a model for me in my later work and I 'm deeply grateful to them all <#> The second professor of Scholastic Philosophy and my Head of Department for over twelve years was James McEvoy <,> who left Queen 's in nineteen eighty-nine to take to take up the prestigious chair of Medieval Philosophy at the Universite/ Catholique de Louvain <,> in Belgium <#> Jim also embodies the very highest standards of scholarship and unfailingly supported me in my philosophical work <#> To him <,> and to my other colleagues in the Department <,> two of whom were also my teachers <,> I owe a great debt of gratitude which I 'm happy to acknowledge publicly today <#> Incidentally <,> and I mention this since some colleagues have wondered about it <,> when I was awarded a Chair it was simply inappropriate to use the title of the Chair previously uh held previously by Professors Crowley and McEvoy since I have never been a Scholastic Philosopher <,> hence the somewhat duller title which I 'm honoured to bear <,> Professor of Philosophy <#> There are other more intangible but all-pervasive debts <#> The one person whose absence on this occasion I regret more than anything else is my late father <#> He would have derived great satisfaction from this occasion <#> And then there 's my mother <#> There 's nothing I can say here about how much I owe her that she doesn't know already <#> I was the first in my family to go to a university <,> but my family 's connection with Queen 's goes back much further than that <#> You may remember Vice Chancellor you were curious when I said I had a long-standing family connection with Queen 's <#> Well with her encouragement the truth can now be told <#> When my mother came from County Leitrim to Belfast as a teenage girl during the war <,> her first job in Belfast was as a live-in domestic assistant in Riddle Hall <,> which in those days was a residential hall for young ladies <#> Of course today the headquarters of the Arts Council <#> So although I was the first to attend university my family connections with Queen 's go back over fifty years <#> Among many many many other gifts <,> I owe my mother a love of books a love of learning and a love of our Irish culture <#> <&Irish> A mha/thair di/lis, go raibh mi/le maith agat </&Irish> </&> Turning now to my second section <#> What is philosophy anyway <#> What is philosophy for in the contemporary university <#> Why should students study philosophy and why should taxpayers subsidise philosophy <#> Now there are many styles of doing philosophy <,> some of them very different from my own <,> but in my view they are all equally valid <,> they are all different ways of doing philosophy <#> We philosophers often have great difficulty in communicating with each other <,> but there should be no room for sectarianism of any kind within philosophy <#> All I can do today is try to communicate to you not just the excitement of philosophical ideas and of following a train of philosophical thought wherever it leads and you never know where it 's going to end up when you embark upon the journey <,> but also why I believe that philosophy is of central importance in a university curriculum <#> Now philosophy like any other university discipline has its own technical language which can sometimes be almost impenetrable <#> A lot of time as I 've said <,> I don't understand half of it myself <#> Ms Boyd in her letter to me about my forthcoming lecture <,> and thank-you Lynne for making all the arrangements <,> charmingly invited me and I quote <,> to strike a balance between something indicating the nature of your own original research and something which would be appreciated by those who are not experts in the subject <#> A lot easier said than done <#> Well I note that professional philosophers are greatly outnumbered in the hall and I 've no doubt that they will find much of the remainder of my talk deeply dissatisfying <#> For most of what I 'll have to say is controversial <,> and I shall not <,> for lack of time <,> be supporting many of my claims and assertions with the kinds of detailed evidence and arguments quite properly demanded of philosophy <#> But I do hope to present some aspects of my practice of philosophy in a jargon-free language that if not exactly appreciated will at least be followed by all the non-philosophers present <#> Even by chemical engineers <#> Some philosophers are of the view that the most fundamental questions are questions of knowledge <#> How can we know things with certainty and how can we know we know <#> Others claim that the most fundamental question of philosophy is the question of being <#> Before going any further they would say we must try to grasp the nature of being <,> of how and why there is something rather than nothing <#> And these questions of epistemology <,> theory of language <,> theory of knowledge sorry <,> and ontology or metaphysics the study of being <,> have always loomed large in Western philosophy <,> uh often taken together <,> and have really dominated European philosophy for the past three hundred and fifty years <#> And Anglo-American so-called analytic philosophy of this generation <,> indeed for most of this century <,> has been bewitched by a debate between realism and anti-realism <#> I 'm not going to take time to try to explain that but it 's a debate <,> it 's a debate about how what is outside our minds is represented by what is in our minds <#> And it 's a debate in which I have not been directly involved <#> Really because I believe it to be quite beside the point <,> for reasons that might become apparent as we proceed <#> I espouse a third view <,> namely that the most fundamental questions of philosophy <,> the questions that most fruitfully provide the starting point for philosophical reflection <,> precisely because of the kind of situated beings we ourselves are <,> are questions of ethics <#> And especially questions of social and public ethics since we humans are all inescapably social beings <#> In the graphic phrase of the novelist St E/xupe/ry <,> human beings are nothing other than a knot of relationships <#> As I think of it and practise it philosophy is above all else about trying to understand the world we live in and the people who inhabit it <,> not least oneself <#> My version of philosophy emphasises the primacy of the political over metaphysics or epistemology <#> In philosophy I use my reason to try to find my bearings in the world <,> to try to orientate myself within the communities in which I 'm immersed <#> And I use that word immersed because I 'm never standing at the side of the pool looking at everyone else who 's in the pool <,> I 'm always immersed in the pool along with everyone else <#> And I also <.> us </.> uh used the word communities in the plural <,> communities in which I 'm immersed <#> Because I <,> like everyone <,> live within and participate in a large number of different communities <,> from those close to my person such as my family <,> this university community <,> which takes up most of my energy these days and this tortured country <,> however this country is to be defined <#> Then moving outwards <,> like ripples in a pool <,> to wider and more distant communities which include places I have never visited <,> places such as Rwanda <,> South Africa <,> Vietnam <#> And the ripples go out as far as the community of all human beings who have lived and who will live <#> Another way of summarising this thought is to say that we are all inserted in history <#> For me the purpose of philosophy is to identify good choices <,> which in turn will help to guide right action <#> Philosophy helps an individual to answer questions such as <,> who am I <#> What am I doing here <,> <#> Is there a purpose in living that will give me satisfaction <#> How should I comport myself vis-a\-vis other people <,> vis-a\-vis other aspects of nature <#> What would be a just or a good or a well-ordered society <#> How do I live a good life as a good citizen <#> How should I contribute to making a good society <#> This all requires the exercise of what Aristotle called practical reason</I>
