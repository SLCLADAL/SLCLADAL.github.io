<S2A-066 Public accounts><I><S2A-066$A> <#> Uhm Chairman <,> I go to <.> th </.> first <,> the first issue I I 'd like to to raise <.> a </.> and that is one that I touched on earlier when we were talking about industrial uhm industrial development and uh I 'm not happy we 've I I 've received an answer from from the the Government <#> This year we 're planning to spend three hundred and forty million pounds on Fa/s schemes of one sort or another <#> And that 's an increase of twenty-five percent <#> At the same time we 're planning to cut the spending we put on industrial support strategies of all sorts by eleven percent <#> And the total amount will be a hundred and fifty million <#> In others <.> ords </.> we 're spending more than two pounds on training and schemes uh for every one we spend on uh industrial development strategies <#> Now I really do question whether this represents the best use of scarce monies available to us <#> Uh and I think the Government is tending to rush along headlong to to commit itself to this spending not only this year but for the next five or six years <#> And any critics or questioning are dismissed as either ill-informed or even in the case of European officials as cheeky <#> Uh I think if we look back on the last National Development Plan <,> we cannot give a clear bill of health to the various Fa/s schemes <#> They didn't succeed in containing the growth of unemployment <#> Nor did they even succeed in containing the growth of long-term unemployment within that group <#> The proportion of long-term unemployed grew within the group despite uhm the the the heavy emphasis on Fa/s schemes <#> And these are now to be increased as I say this year by uh twenty-five percent <#> And it 's not just political critics that are expressing misgivings <#> Uhm the recent uhm <.> th </.> Culliton Report which is I suppose now somewhat old <#> But the Culliton Report uh clearly spelled out huge problems in the area of Fa/s and the priorities it was giving <#> Uh one of the big difficulties it it saw was the uh excessive <.> th </.> <,> the lack of emphasis on training within industry <#> Now only today we see that that has not improved <,> that uh IBEC have produced uh uh uh their proposals highly critical of this this this area of of activity <#> Uh then we had the uh consultants to the NESF who produced uhm a paper showing that the placement rates from many of the uh the Fa/s schemes was extremely poor <#> It was just sixteen percent in the the case of social employment schemes <,> nineteen percent in the case of <.> altern </.> alternant schemes <,> uh sixteen percent also in the case of uh VTOS <#> These are very very poor results for the people who are taking part <#> And these also prove to be the most expensive schemes within the the the various <,> the the Fa/s uhm remit <#> Now there has been some modification in SES but only a slight modification in its new <,> uhm its new CEP uh formation <#> So that you had that group <.> c </.> criticising <#> Then you had most uh recently the ESRI medium-term review which I have here and uh it again was highly critical of of our efforts in this area <#> And they pointed to uhm numerous weaknesses <,> there are still too many Fa/s programmes <,> too many unsuccessful Fa/s programmes <,> uh they went on then to say the huge missing element in in the human resource programme is the focus on targeted <.> ination </.> <,> targeted action on initial education to prevent early failure and dropout <#> Uh they were concerned about the the the the new CEP <,> that it hadn't really uh dealt with the SES <,> uh the weaknesses in the SES <,> uh they went on then to be highly critical of the way in which uh evaluation is is being conducted <,> predominantly where it 's coming essentially from sponsors of of of uh programmes or or doing self <,> uh self-sponsorship <,> uh self self-evaluation <#> Every one of these bodies have put up uh warning signals about uhm the the the area of manpower uh policy and I think it 's not good enough that we haven't had a clear statement in the way of uh a White Paper on manpower policy from Government as to what exactly these schemes are intended to do <,> against what standards should we evaluate them <#> Uh I I think we we 're we 're being less than honest with the public at large and there is now widespread cynicism about a lot of the Fa/s schemes which is is in some cases it 's undeserved but it 's because Government have refused to come clean and deal with these uh cases honestly <#> There are some specific decisions taken in the last year that I 'd have to question <#> The Employment Allowance Scheme <,> it 's still not clear whether this has been axed or put on a drip but it was a very successful scheme <#> The uhm the report that went to the NESF showed that at the end of one year a hundred percent of the people participating were still uh working <,> unlike the SES where there was only sixteen percent <#> It was the cheapest of all the schemes <,> it <.> cre </.> gave people the chance to set up enterprises within three months of becoming unemployed <#> This was the sort of scheme that if we were emphasising entrepreneurship and and and uhm <.> in </.> initiative in our community should have stayed and it 's the one that 's been axed <#> Uh the CEP programme that 's come in <,> it still excludes uhm deserted wives <,> people on deserted wives ' benefit <,> it refuses to give a class-A stamp <,> it 's still very much in the category of scheme and not something that is a foot <,> giving a foothold to get back into the workplace <#> The NESF uhm work which will be shortly published is clearly showing that what 's needed is not these stopgap <.> ste </.> schemes but something that was a clear pathway back into employment and is highly uh questioning the the CEP philosophy <#> Uh I I I again would draw attention to the fact that uh in this year 's estimate we 're cutting back the allocation to training within industry as witnessed by the uh earlier subsections where we dealt with huge cuts in the training elements of the Forbairt budget and the training element of the IDA budget <#> These again are contrary to recommendations that we understood had been accepted by Government <,> that uh there must be increasing emphasis on on training within industry <#> And it is ironic that the <,> the special advisor to the Minister is one of the people who was author of the highly critical report <#> And I think there is the skill and experience within the Department to come up with better and to come up with uh a coherent policy in this area rather than uh building piecemeal one scheme upon the other as we 've had in in recent years <#> And I think that will be my my final uh appeal would be that we would see a coherent policy statement from Government on this area</I><I><S2A-066$B> <#> Chairman <,> just following on from what Deputy Bruton has said <,> uh I 'd like to also draw attention to the whole uh evaluation of uh the various uh Fa/s schemes and training and education uh generally <#> <.> A </.> as has been stated <,> we 've had the National Economic and Social Forum uh report which examined this issue uh or should I say we 've had uh newspaper reports uh of their evaluation of uh these various schemes <#> Uh unfortunately the paper itself uh which dealt with this issue is is is not generally available to the public or indeed to Oireachtas members uh because I <.> s </.> I sought it but I understand that once the final report of the NESF is out <,> uh that this paper then uh could be made available but according to newspaper reports anyway <,> uh there was uh serious uh concern indeed about the uh benefit of uh some of the training uh which we are undertaking at the moment uh particularly uh through Fa/s <#> Uh and uh I think that was probably uhm the start of of this uh general debate <#> Uh I note also uh Minister that you accepted a report from IBEC yesterday uh dealing with this same issue and maybe you might use this occasion to uh respond to their concerns <#> Uh I gather that uh IBEC believe that uh more training and education should be uh given to people already in employment or certainly that seemed to be a a a summary of what the the newspaper said today uh in relation to to that report <#> Uh I certainly raised uhm uh doubts previously about uh our national plan and the uh amount of uh European funding uh going into this whole general area <#> Uh and I do think now that we do need a uhm a a full-scale debate on the issue <#> Uh there 's no doubt that education and training uh generally <.> i </.> <.> i </.> is needed but I do think we need now to examine very carefully uh the whole evaluation process and to see uh exactly what we 're doing <.> a </.> and what our objectives are <#> Uh there is a view that uh there is a view abroad indeed that many of these schemes are simply to take people off the dole queues <#> Now uh I don't go along with that fully but on the other hand uh I think we need to state that uh very uh clearly <,> that we are serious about training and that we are serious about education <#> Uh having said all that I do believe we have come a long way uh in recent years uh and the quality of the schemes uh have improved <#> Uh I remember a few years ago there was a an office procedure and training course uh organised uhm in a centre close to my own constituency and many of the the young girls involved <.> i </.> in that uhm had bananas to use as telephones <#> They didn't actually have uh telephones to apply themselves and they used bananas <.> t </.> as uh an improvisation <#> So presumably <,> <&> laughs </&> presumably we we have moved on uh from that stage uh and uh uh you know many of the the courses are uh much more uh comprehensive indeed but I <.> a </.> <.> a </.> as as Deputy Bruton said previously we <.> de </.> need we do need a full-scale uh evaluation <,> uh we need to uh know where we 're going uh and we need to have a cost-benefit analysis generally uh of this whole <,> uh this whole area <#> There there 's just one uhm technicality I 'd like to raise Minister and that is if if somebody is not drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance <,> uhm very often they 're not eligible for some of the Fa/s schemes <#> Uhm say for example uhm a person where one of the spouses is working and they 're just not eligible for unemployment assistance <,> I think that whole area is uh should be looked at uh from the point of view uh of of giving some of these people uh a chance to participate but uhm and there there are other uhm technical aspects of the schemes which need to be looked at and I 'm sure we can put them uh to you uh in due course but uh I would welcome uh the Minister 's response to the general debate which is now beginning in relation to the whole uh area of <,> uh uh of training and education and the evaluation of the schemes</I>
