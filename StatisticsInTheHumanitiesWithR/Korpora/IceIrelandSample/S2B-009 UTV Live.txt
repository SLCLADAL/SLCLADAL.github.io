<S2B-009 UTV Live><I><S2B-009$A> <#> Relatives of Roseanne Mallon the seventy-six year old Tyrone woman shot dead by the UVF in May <,> have claimed that high-tech army surveillance equipment has been found near the scene of the shooting <#> And they say the killers may have been caught on the cameras <#> The Mallons have called for a full-scale enquiry into how long the cameras had been trained on their home where Miss Mallon was shot <#> And an SDLP councillor has submitted a report to the Dublin government <,> which he says shares his concern over the situation<S2B-009$B> <#> The cameras which appeared to be sophisticated surveillance equipment including a telescopic camera and a tiny wide-angled camera were found in a field overlooking the house where seventy-six year old Roseanne Mallon was shot dead by the UVF in May <#> She 'd been visiting her sister-in-law 's home and the UVF said she wasn't their intended target <#> They said they 'd been trying to kill a relative who 'd been jailed in the eighties <#> Today her nephew Christopher Mallon who didn't want to be identified said the cameras were found purely by chance<S2B-009$C> <#> A neighbour happened to be out <.> th </.> <.> th </.> through the fields for a bit of a dander and he come across suspicious stuff in the hedge <,> and <.> invest </.> investigated it and found out that it was cameras<S2B-009$B> <#> Mr Mallon said the telescopic camera had been dug into the ground and was trained on his house <#> The top of the lens was encased in a camouflaged cover he said <,> and the wide-angle lens had been sealed inside another camouflaged coating <#> Mr Mallon said the equipment which also included a modulator and a transmitter was connected to massive long-life battery packs which had been concealed in the ground <#> He said neighbours were unable to remove the batteries <#> Mr Mallon said his family wanted to know if the cameras had been in place at the time of the murder of his aunt <,> and if the killers had been captured by the equipment<S2B-009$C> <#> I believe that my auntie 's shooting <,> is possibly on film <,> and we want these films released <,> right away <,> because it 's not fair that that 's that this should happen<S2B-009$B> <#> Mr Mallon admitted that the cameras which he said were recovered would not have had an ideal view of his house <,> but he said he believed other cameras may have been hidden in the area <#> But he said that shortly after the cameras on the hill were removed <,> troops saturated the area claiming they 'd received a bomb alert <#> He said that any other cameras in the district could have been removed during that time<S2B-009$C> <#> I would say they 'd be taken away because like you say these people 'll go out round the country and look for more <#> And more likely have been removed<S2B-009$B> <#> The Mallon family have called for a full public enquiry into the situation <#> The Mallon family 's concerns about the cameras are shared by the local SDLP councillor Anthony McGonnell <#> He 's backed their calls for a full public inquiry <,> and he 's gone one step further for he 's raised the issue with the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin<S2B-009$D> <#> They shared my concern very much so <#> Absolutely <#> My main concern <,> would be that they recorded that horrific murder <,> and that there may be vital <.> eviden </.> uh evidence available <,> which would lead to the apprehension of the of the people uhm responsible for that <#> There 's a dirty underworld out there both on the terrorist side and on the security side and <,> it 's murky <,> it 's dirty <,> it 's <,> it 's uhm <,> something that <,> one of these <,> it 's in one of these areas where people seem to be prepared to stoop to any level to get what they want<S2B-009$B> <#> Councillor McGonnell said he wanted the authorities to investigate a label on the modulator bearing the name Torden Security <#> The RUC has still made no comment about the cameras<S2B-009$A> <#> Army bomb experts have defused an incendiary at a Belfast furniture store which was firebombed last week <#> Staff found the device at Fairbanks in Boucher Retail Park around three pm <#> It 's thought it may have been timed to ignite during last week 's attack <,> but failed to go off <#> A number of people are still being questioned following the discovery of a bomb in the New Lodge area of North Belfast <#> The device was spotted by a police patrol at around midnight last night <#> The improvised grenade had been hidden inside a wheelie bin at Hillman Street <#> A command wire led from the bin to an entry behind houses in the street <#> Army bomb experts carried out a controlled explosion to make it safe <#> The Office of Fair Trading has said that there 's no evidence to launch an investigation into the price of bread <#> In a letter to the Northern Ireland Select Committee it says the situation will be monitored but it sees no reason to take the matter further <#> However the General Consumer Council says the matter has not been concluded and the issue is very much alive<S2B-009$E> <#> The General Consumer Council gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Select Committee about the price of bread in the Province on July the thirteenth <#> The delegation was led by its Assistant Director<S2B-009$F> <#> The Council first investigated this issue <,> as far back as nineteen and eighty-nine and that was in response to quite significant numbers of complaints from consumers<S2B-009$E> <#> What did you have to say to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee<S2B-009$F> <#> We presented them with the information which we had obtained <,> that was information based on our own price survey and also on some of the information that had come back to us from the industry <,> where they had pointed out to us that they 'd higher production costs in Northern Ireland <,> there were other disadvantages <,> all of which we accept <#> But on the best information available to us <,> the differential in in producing bread in Northern Ireland <,> at most <,> is between five and six pence <,> and of course that falls a long way short of explaining a difference of anything between seventeen and twenty-four pence<S2B-009$E> <#> But it 's been reported this morning that the Office of Fair Trading will not launch a formal probe into the price of bread in Northern Ireland <,> as it has not yet been given a reason to believe that the difference in bread prices is likely to be attributable to an abuse of a monopoly position or some particular anti-competitive practice<S2B-009$F> <#> Well I think that is <,> it 's a bit misleading <,> in the sense that this morning 's report in the Financial Times suggested that the matter had been concluded <,> and certainly having spoken to the Office of Fair Trading this morning that is not the case <#> Uh <,> their investigations are continuing <#> They have written to <,> as we understand it uh <,> the main interests <,> that 's the bakeries and the retailers <,> and they will be taking a decision later on this year as to what <,> if indeed any action <,> might be necessary<S2B-009$E> <#> So is it fair to say that the issue is still being investigated<S2B-009$F> <#> Very much so<S2B-009$A> <#> The province 's tourism industry is in line for another record year with visitor figures on the increase <#> Tourist Board chiefs say local resorts are benefiting from a huge investment in hotels and attractions <#> UTV Live took a day trip to Bangor<S2B-009$G> <&> phone rings </&> <#> Good afternoon Bangor tourist information <#> Oh I 'm terribly sorry our self-catering accommodation now is fully booked for the month of August <#> There 's nothing now available until September<S2B-009$H> <#> Bangor 's been having a field day since D-Day <#> The success of the commemorative weekend at the end of May has really put the town on the map<S2B-009$G> <#> There 's been a tremendous increase <,> almost a hundred percent increase in the tourist information centre <,> and generally the feel throughout the town is that it is packed <#> A lot of people who came for D-Day have been coming back again <,> day-trippers coming for a week <,> the guest houses are completely booked out this time of year <#> So it 's been extremely successful<S2B-009$H> <#> The development of this marina has played a major part in Bangor 's transformation from an old-fashioned rather crumbling seaside resort to a modern tourist centre <#> But it hasn't come cheap <#> This seafront development has cost nearly twenty million pounds <,> but because it 's proving a major attraction for both yachtsmen and dry land visitors <,> the town and the tourist board thinks it 's money well spent on developing the Province 's tourism infrastructure<S2B-009$I> <#> There 's been huge investment uh by hoteliers locally <,> in their product <,> in the local attractions <#> Over a hundred million pounds of European Union International Fund for Ireland money and uh government money has been invested in the tourism infrastructure in Northern Ireland <,> and that has seen a number of flagship developments whether it is the Navan Centre in Armagh or whether it is the Tower Museum uh in Derry<S2B-009$H> <#> If Bangor 's anything to go by with its hordes of visitors and packed guest houses <,> the Province appears to be on course for a record year in tourism terms<S2B-009$I> <#> Last year was our fifth consecutive record year for tourism <#> We had one and a quarter million visitors <#> Uh we would hope certainly to have an increase on that this year <#> It is however too early to say what our final year-end figures are going to be <#> Obviously the months of August and September are going to be critical to our overall success but we 're reasonably confident that the continued growth in tourism will be uh achieved again this year<S2B-009$H> <#> Visitors are coming to the Province from all over the world <,> but just as important are the local day-trippers <,> who provide the bread-and-butter trade for resorts like Bangor<S2B-009$J> <#> The park here 's been open from the twelfth of June there last year <,> and one of the days we had thirty-two thousand through it <#> Uhm still at the minute we 're still really busy <#> Last weekend there I was in Portrush and I wouldn't compare Portrush with Bangor<S2B-009$H> <#> Well he would say that wouldn't he <#> But all the resorts are proving popular this year and everyone involved with the tourist industry is looking forward to counting the receipts at the end of the season<S2B-009$A> <#> Mackie International of West Belfast is now attempting to win a multi-million pound order for textile machinery in Brazil <#> Yesterday the company signed a contract worth twenty-five million pounds for new water and sewage treatment plants in Argentina <#> It 's understood that if the deal in Brazil is successfully negotiated it 'll be worth over eight million pounds <#> Meanwhile Mackie 's breakthrough into the field of treatment facilities which carries the prospect of a hundred additional jobs has been welcomed by the Economy Minister here<&> English Economy Minister speaks </&><S2B-009$A> <#> And that 's the news for the moment <#> I 'll have more in about fifteen minutes <#> Mike<S2B-009$K> <#> Thank-you Kate <#> Uh coming up <,> a sports reporter and a five year old girl who both have a lot to thank their fathers for <#> The dogs we could all end up calling our best friends <#> The sport and the weather <#> And if you 're in the habit of pinching a parking place reserved for people with disabilities <,> we would like you to meet three students who fancy their chances of making you stop<S2B-009$L> <#> The whole idea is to embarrass the the the offending driver as much as possible and focus the attention on him on uh abusing a facility that really is not for his use <#> Right okay <#> Well I think it would certainly embarrass a lot of people to have that flashing over their heads<&> commercial break </&><S2B-009$K> <#> It 's six sixteen <#> You 're watching UTV Live <,> now I think you 'll enjoy the person you 're going to meet next <#> She has something in common with the person she 's talking to actually <,> because like Stephen Watson she 's had a kidney transplant <#> And like Stephen <,> her father was the donor</I>
