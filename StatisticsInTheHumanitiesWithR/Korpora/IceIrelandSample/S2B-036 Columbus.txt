<S2B-036 Columbus><I><S2B-036$A> So much has been written on Christopher Columbus <,> that the real problem for the historian is to distinguish those few publications that tell us something new about the navigator and his exploits <,> from the myriad of pieces devoted to such futile exercises as claiming a Greek <,> Portuguese or Spanish nativity <,> for a man who was unquestionably Genoese by birth <#> Perhaps the most pointless exercise of all <,> because the most expensive <,> has been the effort sponsored by the National Geographic <,> to track the first Columbus trans-Atlantic voyage <,> to a landfall in the Bahamas <,> other than that suggested by Samuel <.> Eli </.> Elliot Morison in his Columbus biography of nineteen forty-two <#> However <,> in the midst of the plethora of writing which extends to at least one thousand publications over the last twenty-five years <,> it is possible to discern some scholarly progress <,> and that principally derives from the critical editing of the surviving sources that shed light on the career of Columbus <#> The more important sources are those letters <,> about one hundred in number by Columbus himself which have been authenticated <,> as well as miscellaneous notes and organisational material relating to his various voyages <#> Then <,> the copy made by Fra Bartolome/ de Las Casas <,> of the diary kept by Columbus of his first great voyage <#> And then the marginal notes <,> about three thousand in number <,> entered by Columbus on those of his books and maps which have survived to the present day <#> Besides these personal survivals <,> historians have also been able to piece together <,> some details of his activities in the official archives in Genoa <,> Portugal and Spain <#> On the basis of this material <,> historians have been able to establish some unassailable facts <,> although they are not agreed on how this evidence should be interpreted <#> It seems clear that Christopher Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa in fourteen fifty-one <,> into a family of modest circumstances that was associated with the wool trade <#> The young Columbus seems to have been an accomplished sailor in Mediterranean waters <,> and he had become a factor in the Genoese commercial house of Centurione by fourteen seventy-six <#> In that year he appears to been sent by his employers on a commercial voyage <,> bound for Flanders and England <#> The fleet in which he was engaged was attacked by marauders off the coast of Portugal <,> and Columbus was cast ashore <,> and eventually made his way to Lisbon <#> There <,> he together with his brother Bartholomew <,> established a map-selling business <,> and they may also have traded in books relating to navigation <#> Whatever income Columbus derived from this was supplemented by voyaging in Italian and Portuguese employment <#> And in the course of these expeditions Columbus became acquainted with the most remote areas of the Atlantic Ocean then known to Europeans <,> stretching from sub-Saharan Africa to Madeira <,> to the west coasts of England and Ireland and to Iceland <#> In Lisbon also in fourteen seventy-nine <,> he married Dona Felipa Perestrello <,> a member of an old Madeiran family <#> And with her he set up home in Madeira as agent of an Italian company <,> <#> Dona Felipa died in fourteen eighty-five <,> and Columbus returned to Lisbon with his infant son Diego in that year <#> Historians are satisfied that this interlude in Portugal and Madeira <,> fourteen seventy-six to fourteen eighty-five <,> was essential to the development both of Columbus ' expertise as a sailor <,> and his interests as a navigator <#> By that point in his career he was convinced <,> that it was possible to gain access to the coast of Japan <,> by sailing westwards into the Atlantic <,> and he had identified this objective as his life 's ambition <#> Thereafter <,> Columbus set about finding sponsorship for the voyage that he wished to undertake <#> And when he failed to procure this sponsorship in Portugal <,> he went to Spain where he spent six years in penurious pursuit of the Spanish Court <#> Eventually in fourteen ninety-one he had persuaded a group of Spanish noblemen and Italian merchants based in Spain <,> of the viability of his project <#> And so he was able to get together a small exploratory fleet of three ships <,> that made its historic crossing of the Atlantic in fourteen ninety-two <#> The outcome as we all know was to prove a bitter disappointment to Columbus himself <,> <.> bes </.> cause he had discovered not a direct route to the fabled riches of the Orient but rather a series of <.> s </.> of islands previously unknown to Europeans <,> and inhabited by a people who were as alien to Europeans as Europeans were alien to them <#> Although a disappointment to Columbus himself <,> the discovery aroused interest in a previously sceptical Europe <,> and he encountered little difficulty in raising support for the much more elaborate expedition of fourteen ninety-three <,> that is seventeen ships with about one thousand five hundred men <#> This second expedition succeeded in establishing Spanish domination over the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola <,> that 's present day Haiti <,> and in discovering new islands in the Caribbean <#> The desired route to Asia had however still evaded Columbus <#> And his disappointment turned to frustration in fourteen ninety-seven <,> when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama <,> had succeeded in rounding the Cape of Good Hope and crossing from the eastern coast of Africa to India <#> This achievement of da Gama <,> spurred the Spanish authorities to fund yet a third expedition under the command of Columbus who had been idle in Spain since fourteen ninety-six <#> On this third expedition of fourteen ninety-eight the fleet divided <,> with one section sailing due west from the Canaries to Hispaniola <,> while the other section directed by Columbus himself <,> sailed southwards beyond the Cape Verde islands <,> and only then sailed westwards expecting to find a land mass corresponding in size to that of Africa somewhere in mid Atlantic <#> This expedition was fed by the belief that the vast majority of the earth 's surface is covered by land <,> and the discovery of the true extent of the African continent by the Portuguese <,> fostered the notion that a correspondingly large continent existed somewhere in the Atlantic <#> In practice however this last voyage revealed only the island which Columbus called Trinidad <,> off the coast of South America <#> And as he sailed between this island and the continental mainland he recognised <,> from the freshness of the water flowing outwards from the Orinoco river <,> that he was close to a large block of land which he thought might be where the Garden of Eden had been located <#> Columbus did not take time however to put his theory to the test <,> but hastened instead to Hispaniola <,> where he attempted to reassert his authority over the Spaniards he had left in command there <#> This intervention heightened tension in an already unruly situation <,> and provoked a royal inquiry <,> which resulted in Columbus and his brothers being brought back as prisoners to Spain <#> Royal favour ensured that Columbus was quickly released and restored to all his honours and titles <,> except that of Governor of Hispaniola <#> And his fourth and <.> foi </.> final attempt to discover a direct route to Asia <,> was got underway in fifteen hundred and two <#> On this occasion he came within reach of the coastline of Central America <,> and established himself briefly in Jamaica <,> before returning to Spain <#> There in fifteen o-six he died a disillusioned man <,> despite having attained wealth and status for himself and his descendants <,> such as he could not have imagined in fourteen seventy-six <#> Much has been made in popular literature of the Columbus voyages as the culmination of a frenetic period of scientific and technical advances <,> associated with the Renaissance <#> It is true that advances had recently been made in map-making and cartography <,> and we know that Columbus was acquainted with these achievements <,> and that he corresponded with such scholars as the Florentine cosmographer Toscanelli <#> However it was the error of such scholars in grossly underestimating the size of the world <,> rather than <.> s </.> their scientific achievements <,> which convinced Columbus that his objective of reaching Asia by sailing west was a realistic one <#> Of equal importance in fixing his mind the mind of Columbus on his objective of finding a direct route to Asia <,> were the myths <,> fantasies and rumours that circulated freely among the seafaring communities of the Atlantic seaboard <#> Stories of earlier voyages to the west beyond Iceland and Greenland <,> were widespread among the sea-going peoples of Northern Europe <,> and legends of lost islands and even a lost continent in the Atlantic were also widespread <#> These stories would have given confidence to Columbus that his opinions were correct <#> Further proof of a more practical nature would have come from his own witness of flotsam from the western Atlantic <,> thrown up on the shores of the Canary Islands and <.> Mard </.> Madeira <#> Closely related to such proof and certainly of greater significance to Columbus was the evidence that occasioned him to make mention of his visit to Galway <,> which probably took place in fourteen seventy-seven <#> This reference took the form of a marginal note in Latin on Columbus ' copy of Pierre d'Ailly 's Imago Mundi <,> and has been translated into English as follows <,> <quote> Men of Cathay </quote> that is China <quote> have come towards the west <#> Of this we have seen many signs <#> And especially in Galway in Ireland <,> a man and a woman of extraordinary appearance <,> have come to land on two tree trunks </quote> <#> This episode <,> it has been suggested <,> possibly refers to the bodies of two Eskimos in a kayak <,> being carried southward from the coast of Canada in the great outflow from the Davis Strait <,> and then eastwards towards the west coast of Ireland in the Gulf Stream <#> The oriental features of the two Eskimos would 've been proof for Columbus <,> that they were indeed from China <,> which he would 've thought to be in the same latitude as Ireland <#> And this would have been the most potent support for his theory <,> that the distance to Asia was not very great <,> and that it was Asia which <.> w </.> lay westwards from Europe in the Atlantic <#> The way in which Columbus seized upon such chance happenings as evidence to sustain his theory <,> shows again that it was the error of the scientists in grossly underestimating the size of the world <,> which convinced him that his objective was attainable <#> And we can be certain that Columbus was fully informed of the most recent scientific information <,> because this was <.> ver </.> would have been represented on the maps and globes <,> which he and his brother were retailing <#> Columbus would also have been acquainted with the ongoing Portuguese investigation of the west coast of Africa <#> And it may have been the growing evidence <,> in the decades before fourteen ninety-seven <,> that the continent was far larger than the geographers had presumed <,> which convinced him that the shortest route to Asia may lie westwards across the Atlantic rather than around the coast of Africa <#> The desire to reach Asia which motivated Columbus <,> as it did the other explorers of his time <,> was also fed as much by legend and hearsay as it was by scientific evidence <#> Existing European trade with Asia through the Mediterranean <,> made it clear that luxury commodities <,> silks and finely-wrought carpets as well as spices <,> were altogether more plentiful there than in Europe <#> Growing contact with the Muslim populations who had come to dominate the eastern Mediterranean <.> alo </.> as well as the north African coast <,> also demonstrated that these peoples of Asiatic origin had mastered a technology which was with many respects ahead of that prevalent in Europe <#> And what was known from direct contacts was sustained by the information conveyed by such overland explorers of Asia <,> as Marco Polo in the thirteenth century and the Venetian Nicolo\ Conti in the early fifteenth century <#> The reasonably reliable information that could be gleaned from such explorers <,> was supplemented by medieval lore <,> which spoke of a lost Christian people in Asia or eastern Africa <#> And most explorers including Columbus <,> were all too ready to mingle fact with fiction <#> In this way the mercenary motive to reach Asia <,> was supplemented by the strategic one <,> which visualised the Muslim assailants of Christian Europe being encircled by the alliance which European powers would establish with the lost Christians of the East</I>
