<S2A-046 Geography data><I><S2A-046$A> <#> So we need a better way <,> a more straightforward way <,> of answering probability questions when we have normal data which you may have in practice which has some mean and some variance and some standard deviation <#> And in order to talk about this we have to talk about something else <#> And I 'm actually going to leave this sitting on the blackboard there and now we 're going to talk about something else <#> We 're going to talk about <,> you can write this down <,> data transformations <,> data transformations <#> Now what is a transformation <#> A magician throws a whole lot of cards into a hat and then pulls out a rabbit <#> The cards are turned into a rabbit after the transformation <#> Changing something into something else <#> And just as magicians turn people into rabbits and rabbits into cards and cards back into people <,> and all of the rest of it <,> we can change numbers and we can do things with numbers <#> And in order to see what we can do with numbers and what might happen when we do things with numbers let 's take a very simple data set <#> In fact let 's take a data set that we talked about at the very beginning of the course <#> Let 's take the numbers one two three four and five <#> Now there is a data set and let 's consider the properties of that data set <#> Suppose I plot that data set out on a diagram <,> suppose I plot that data set <,> suppose I plot that data set out on a scatter diagram <,> what will I get <#> What I will get <,> this is the number of observations up here <,> what I will get is in this data set I have one value of one <,> one value of two <,> one value of three <,> one value of four <,> and one value of five <#> Very good <#> Is that data normally distributed <#> No way <#> It 's evenly distributed between one and five <#> It 's actually the integer value <,> and the integer value <,> and evenly distributed or uniformly distributed between one and five <#> What is the mean of that data set <#> I 'll assume it 's a population of data <#> What is the mean of that data set <#> The mean of that data set is obviously two and a half or three and a half <#> No the mean of that data set is three <#> James can't add or subtract which is why he teaches statistics as you 've learnt already <#> The mean of that data set is three <#> We also work out the variance of that data set <#> We actually did this away back in about the second lecture and when I worked out the variance of that data set <,> take each reading <,> subtract three <,> square them <,> add them up and divide by the number of readings is five <,> the variance you may recall came out to be two <#> And therefore the standard deviation of the square root of two which is one point four two <,> to two places of decimals <#> So there 's the properties of our data set <#> It 's uniformly distributed <,> this particular data set <,> it has a mean of three <,> it has a variance of two and it has the standard deviation of the square root of two which I think to two places of decimals is one point four two maybe one point four one but not to worry <#> Now I 'm going to start doing things with this data set <#> And the first thing I want to do to this data set <,> to turn it into another data set <,> is I 'm going to subtract the mean from each reading <#> Now the mean is three so I 'm going to subtract three from each of these readings and then I want to look at the data set that I get <#> So <,> subtracting the mean from each reading <,> so I will write minus mu up there to show what I 'm doing <#> One minus three is minus two <#> Two minus three is minus one <#> Three minus three is zero <#> Four minus one is plus one <,> that 's four minus three is plus one and five minus three is plus two <#> If I subtract the mean of my data set <,> if I subtract it from each reading in turn I get another data set which happens to be these five numbers here <#> And indeed if we just go back a little bit <,> when we started to calculate the variance <,> this is actually the first thing we did <,> when we were calculating the variance <,> take each reading and subtract the mean <#> Then we went on and we squared these and added them up and divided by the number of readings <#> So in a way I 've just started doing the same thing as before <#> Anyway we have taken each reading and we have subtracted the mean <#> So in each reading here is X I where the first one is X one and the second one is X two the third one is X three and so on as <,> we discussed before <#> Our new data set here is each X I <,> subtract from it mu <#> And here is my new data set <#> And I want to ask <,> what are the properties of this data set <#> Now first of all <,> if I plot this new data set out as a scatter diagram what do I get <#> I need to put in here minus one and minus two <#> And my new data set looks like that <#> Those purple Xs <#> And the question is <,> how is that new data set distributed <#> And the answer obviously is <,> again it 's uniformly distributed <#> In fact the way in which it is distributed its shape is exactly the same as before <#> What I 've done graphically is I 've taken this data set and I 've <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> each of the Xs over to the left by a factor of three <#> So this one comes over here <,> this one comes over here <,> this one came over here and so on <#> So if I subtract the mean from each value in my data set I do not change the shape of my data set <#> I move all the readings by a certain amount but I don't change the shape <#> Second of all <,> what is the mean of my new data set <#> The mean of my new data set is obviously zero <#> The data readings in effect are now centred over zero <#> So if I subtract the mean <,> if I have a data set and I subtract the mean value from each reading I get a new data set and obviously the mean of that new data set is zero because all the readings have gone down by whatever the mean is <#> Three <#> What is the variance of this new data set <#> Question <#> How spread out are these purple Xs relative to how spread out these white Xs are <#> Answer <#> Exactly the same <#> They 're spread out to the same degree <#> While I 've moved all my readings three steps to the left <,> I haven't changed how the purple Xs are and I look at the purple Xs how they 're spread out relative to each other <,> how they 're spread out around their central value which is zero <,> is exactly the same as how these readings are spread out around their central value <,> which is three <#> And indeed we calculate the variance of these values take each reading and subtract the mean <,> the mean of course is zero now <,> square them and add them up <#> You 'll get four plus one plus zero plus one plus four which is ten and divide by two divide by five the number of readings <#> We finish up again with two <#> And therefore standard deviation <,> maybe I just should check this I I need this a little bit later <#> Look at this <#> Look at this <#> There 's organisation <#> I actually remembered to bring a machine today to do some sums <#> Now <#> One point four one four <#> Okay I 've changed my mind <#> The square root of two is one point four one to two places of decimals <,> so again the standard deviation here is one point four one <#> So what have we proved so far <#> If you have a data set and you subtract the mean of that data set from each reading in that data set you get your new data set <,> your new data set will <,> a <,> have the same distribution as before <,> b <,> the mean of your new data set will be zero and <,> c <,> the degree of spread in your new data set will be the same as before whether you measure that spread by variance or standard deviation <#> Very good <#> Now I 'm going to do something else <#> I 'm going to take each of these readings in this data set that I have created from my original data set and I 'm going to divide each of those readings by the standard deviation <#> Okay <#> Now my standard deviation here is one point four one and this didn't change as I came over here <#> So I 'm going to divide each reading in my second data set by one point four one <#> So basically <,> therefore <,> what I 'm calculating over here on the right is each reading subtract the mean <,> now that 's what went on as we went from the first column to the second column and now <,> to do a further transformation I 'm going to divide each of these readings by the standard deviation which is one point four one <#> So what I will get here is minus two divided by one point four one <,> minus one divided by one point four one <,> zero <,> one <,> divided by one point four one <,> and two <,> divided by one point four one <#> And when I work out what two divided by one point four one is I get one point four one <,> over here <,> one divided by one point four one would be half of this which would be zero point seven zero five <#> This is zero <,> this would be uh <,> sorry that 's minus one point four one <,> minus one point point seven zero five <,> this would be plus zero point seven zero five and this would be plus one point four one <#> So if I take each reading in my middle column and divide by one point four one <,> the data set that I now get is this data set <#> Minus one point four one <,> minus point zero seven five <,> zero plus point zero seven five <,> plus zero point zero seven five <,> and plus one point four one <#> And now I want to ask <,> what are the properties of this data set <,> and of course each reading has originally come from <,> has been derived from <,> one of the readings over here <#> First of all <,> what is the shape of this data set <#> And let 's plot it out <#> I have a reading of zero and I put the Xs up here so that we can compare <#> Now <,> the first reading over there is minus one point four one so I 'll plot out about there <#> The second one minus point seven zero five isn't that what it was <#> Yes <#> Zero <,> plus point seven zero five and plus one point four one <#> So those red Xs simply plot out graphically <,> are a graphical representation <,> of those five numbers we had derived from these five which came originally from these five <#> Now <,> we are asking <,> what are the properties of this data set <#> Question <#> What is the distribution <,> what is the shape of this data set <#> Answer <#> It is still uniformly distributed data <#> It is evenly distributed <,> the readings come at even intervals this time over a scale of minus one point four one to plus one point four one but the shape is still the same <#> You have five readings which are evenly spread <,> one following the next <#> Second question <,> what is the mean of this new data set <#> Answer <,> the mean of those readings is zero <#> These red Xs are still centred over zero <#> The mean is zero <#> What is the standard deviation of these readings <#> What would we expect the variance or the standard deviation of these readings to be</I>
