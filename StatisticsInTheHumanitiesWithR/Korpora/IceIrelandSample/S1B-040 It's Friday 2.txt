<S1B-040 It's Friday 2><I><S1B-040$A> <#> Yeah as to the first point Tom yes we do we find people do get caught up in debt and they tend to borrow to pay the debt and borrow to pay the what they 've borrowed to pay the debt <,> <#> Uh but there the the this MABS programme has been extremely successful and Brendan and and his co-workers are doing wonderful work and there 's a very strong liaison as between themselves and the society <,> <#> But to your second point Christmas uh of course is is is a time a stress <,> is a time of joy but it 's also a time of stress <#> But uhm whereas undoubtedly it is a time where there 's considerable expense placed on parents particularly those on the margin uh all kinds of the obvious types of stress whereby for example kids wanting toys that their mother can't afford and this type of thing <#> Nonetheless <,> it is but one peak in in in a series of peaks that we 're now noticing and <.> tha </.> that are not necessarily new <#> Christmas yes is a big one <,> <#> That 's true <,> <#> But the time of Confirmation and Holy Communion are others <#> Holiday time yet another <,> and an increasingly difficult burden for people to bear is the back-to-school time where they have uh clothes for the children in some cases expensive uniforms and the increasingly expensive uh textbooks uh which themselves uh are seen to be changing at a fairly rapid rate <#> Now I know there 's curriculum development and you need to have changes in text books but <.> th </.> there 's more than that to it <#> So whereas Christmas <,> in some way Christmas is an important time and is a difficult and expensive time for parents uh so also may be the other times <#> But there 's another factor with regard to Christmas that probably makes it more more stressful and that is there 's a tremendous uhm uhm advertising uhm uhm uh stress or campaign <#> Television advertising putting an putting an enormous amount of of of of uhm <,> uh pressure on parents for buying expensive toys for kids and so on <#> The kids see the advertising and so on and this is a change uh that is relatively new and in to to this current generation to an extent compared with say our our own generation where there was not television and there wasn't the same stress and parents are caught in a very very difficult situation <#> It 's very hard for them to deny their children uh toys and and and treats at Christmas and uhm it 's a tough time<S1B-040$B> <#> John Ireland how do you see that <#> Because there are those today expensive expectations aren't there<S1B-040$C> <#> Yeah uh obviously and like what I have seen in the last few years especially from the point of view of commercialism and advertising on TV and radio and the papers and everything is that Christmas is creeping back and back and back <#> Not the joy and the spirit of Christmas but the the sales pitch and buzz of Christmas I mean traditionally the eighth of December <,> the church holiday was sort of the beginning of the Christmas season but now like it has crept back into mid-November<S1B-040$B> <#> As soon as Halloween is over<S1B-040$C> <#> Exactly it 's nearly on you <#> And obviously like it places parents and everybody really in a very difficult position and especially as Cashel said like the the way advertisers especially on television obviously have used you know them <,> the central <,> one of the central points of Christmas that is that children get presents the way they have targeted in on children and obviously like it puts fierce pressure on parents from children <#> And like children 'tis no good explaining to children that Santa hasn't had a pay increase in the last ten years and that he can't afford to bring extra toys <#> I mean like it 's all down to media pressure now and obviously if Johnny next door 's getting a Double Nintendo Super XYZ like the other child wants you know a Treble Nintendo XYZ with Power Rangers on top of it <#> And obviously it 's putting fierce pressure on and I wonder you see we 're probably we 're only now in our second generation of television watchers <#> So obviously like it 's it 's a new pressure I mean people that are sixty years old plus never knew what it was in in when they were children or when they were growing up or what television pressure meant and you see I don't think we 're probably properly educated how to deal with it because I mean people going to secondary school and national school now media studies and everything is only in its infancy <#> So we we don't really know how to cope with pressure <#> I mean when you hear people talking about oh did you see such a thing on television and such a thing was advertised and if children now practically their needs and their wants are dictated to by television rather than what you know that a child we 'll say long ago said I 'd like something because they 'd personally like it <#> Now they like something because it looks glamorous on television it looks good and it 's in a grand box and because the child next door saw it on television and he wants it you know <#> It takes away a bit from the simplicity of Christmas obviously<S1B-040$B> <#> Right <#> We 're going to pick up this discussion again in a few moments <#> You are listening to It 's Friday <#> The good news by the way as well is that he has loaded up <#> The bags are packed <#> I saw him heading off this morning and just getting the last few bits and pieces so he will be calling and uhm I hope you 're good <#> It 's It 's Friday from Cork oh two one three double one two double two if you want to talk with us <#> Right now we take a break<&> later on tape </&><S1B-040$B> <#> Welcome back to It 's Friday <#> Well we 've been talking about money for a while now but the one side of that that 's there that perhaps we should acknowledge as well Brendan Roche is that of giving and the spirit of generosity that pervades the this festive season<S1B-040$D> <#> Yeah I think Tom <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> that the giving aspect here in this country fascinates me always you know I 'm what I 'm twenty-seven years at at the money business now and uh always at Christmas time especially <#> You have this great sense of uh community spirit in the people that if one is down the others 'll see that they won't be down for long <#> And only quite recently now I was walking through a shopping mall here in town and I got a shout from a gentleman and he said you know I 've a beautiful bicycle for a nine year old <#> Almost new <#> Would you be prepared to use it for someone <#> I said no problem <#> I 'll get someone to take that alright <#> And when I collected the bike the on the previous the following night uhm onto the saddle of the bike was strapped an envelope with forty pounds inside it to buy food for people <#> And that 's just one incidence of many many people that come to me <#> And I 'm I 'm not Vincent de Paul as such but I have been established <unclear> several sylls </unclear> as well as being in the money advice and budgeting service for so long that uhm people come to me and say look do you need something for somebody <#> We can give it <#> And I think it 's a great <,> it 's a great sense of community spirit that we have here in this country <#> If you go across the water even you 'll find that you live as an individual <#> And you could be down and out but you stay down and out but here you won't for long if you 'll make it known <#> And as I always say there 's no need for anybody to starve in this country and if your pride won't allow you ask <,> it 's a false pride <,> <#> You must be prepared to get up and ask if you need food<S1B-040$B> <#> Right <#> You obviously experienced that same kind of generosity in the Vincent de Paul Cashel<S1B-040$E> <#> Ah yes we do <#> Christmas uh is a time of generosity as you said at the outset of this part of the discussion <#> People are in a giving mood and we are very fortunate to be beneficiaries of this <#> Uh and and indeed they 're very generous <#> Cork people in particularly I think are very generous to charities like Vincent de Paul <,> Simon <,> Share <,> and and so on <#> And and with good cause <#> We we we 're doing the charities collectively <,> uh I 'm we 're we 're but one <#> We 're we 're perhaps the oldest <,> but uh are doing very good work and doing very essential work <#> Uh some would say we 're doing some of the government 's work in in housing homeless people and feeding hungry people <,> paying off debts to people who are not adequately remunerated or remunerated at all <,> <#> Uhm but nonetheless it it is it is a good time <#> We 're very dependent on people 's generosity through the year but Christmas particularly perhaps twenty twenty-five percent of our total annual income would would arise at at Christmas time as a matter of fact<S1B-040$B> <#> And you were also saying just during the break that there 's a community support network if the family one has spread out a bit and and and been diluted in some way the community support is there<S1B-040$E> <#> I think there is evolving a kind of a different even if slightly more remote support system replacing the kind of the the the extended family of of old to kind of a wider supporting net <,> the community as a whole <#> Uh with uh considerable help I might say of the various uh elements of the media which is making known the the problems of people and giving us an opportunity such as today and many other times of making known the needs of people and what support systems are there <#> So I think there is yeah a looser and a newer kind of network uh that we 're experiencing at the moment<S1B-040$B> <#> One often sees that particularly in rural areas as well John if if there is a particular problem or a difficulty a house fire for example or something like that that there is a great rallying around isn't there<S1B-040$C> <#> Yeah there is obviously like it gets back to probably you know <&Irish> ar sca/th a ce/ile a mhaireann na daoine </&Irish> <,> in everybody 's shadow everybody else lives basically and if 'twas over 'twould be very sad for Ireland for <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> but for the whole country in general if that uhm faded away completely <#> Obviously in a rural setting it 's uh helping neighbours and everything uh isn't to the same degree as it was heretofore because obviously now you 've so much mechanisation and you 've so little you know lack of manpower <#> But still obviously needy causes could as Brendan said once they 're made known but obviously public manifestations like like tragedies or like fires or problems that way are very well helped and obviously at Christmas again like that that is one aspect of Christmas which I I really love and that is the whole aspect Cashel said of giving to charities and everything but it 's also I suppose the basic idea of you know it was the Three Wise Men brought it up started it I suppose with the idea of <.> bringi </.> bringing gifts like <#> And you know I think the most important part living in a rural area anyway 's of giving gifts is I presume it 's not the the value of the gift or the size of the gift <#> It 's just that people are remembered <#> I know some people say oh yeah you give a present to someone at Christmas and that kind of salves your conscience and you don't see them again for twelve months like <#> But I mean right that that could be the case but at least this season the twelve days of Christmas and several days before it are times when people have probably have a chance despite all the hustle and bustle they have a chance to reflect on people you know it 's not someone there now you know someone that I know that maybe I haven't met lately or that I haven't maybe they would just welcome a chat or a small gift or a card and obviously that 's in essence <,> that is the spirit of Christmas not the the value of some huge big consumer item that might be necessary not or might not be necessary <#> The smallest gift <,> and I 've often seen that myself <,> the smallest gift even if 'twas only a card or a letter can be as important to people as as some present worth maybe twenty or thirty pounds you know <#> Just the the very thought of giving something and that the person is remembered</I>
