<S1B-031 Attorney General><I><S1B-031$A> <#> It has never happened before and I have article thirty-five four of the Constitution in front of me and it says that a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and then only on resolutions passed by the Da/il and by the Seanad calling for his removal<S1B-031$B> <#> Okay<S1B-031$A> <#> Now <,> it not only has it never happened before it 's never even been contemplated but the most important thing I think is that stated misbehaviour refers to stated misbehaviour as a judge<S1B-031$B> <#> And he has done nothing as a judge uh to warrant any such move<S1B-031$A> <#> Absolutely not <#> Uhm I mean I mean I was uh fascinated to hear what uh Geraldine had to say about this possibility but uh all I can say is that I would be flabbergasted if there was an attempt to try to remove or impeach uh Mr Justice Whelehan <#> It 's it 's it 's an amazing uh it may well be discussed in Leinster House <#> I don't deny that but it uh just looking at it from my lawyer 's hat on I mean it is an amazing uhm proposition<S1B-031$B> <#> And what about a government <{> <[> quietly asking <,> yes yes Geraldine </[><S1B-031$C> <#> <[> Pat Pat <,> Pat can </[> </{> mind if I just come in on one point<S1B-031$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-031$C> <#> I said you asked me I mean all of the speculation here is centring on Mr Whelehan being uh removing himself or being removed as President of the High Court and you asked me how could this be done <#> There are two ways <#> One is that he 'd resign the other is that he 'd impeach be impeached <#> Now we don't actually know that that <{> <[> they are going to </[><S1B-031$B> <#> <[> That either will occur </[> </{><S1B-031$C> <#> Well uh there 's very strong speculation that the government will be saved <,> that a deal can be done <#> Labour are aware of this <#> Whatever 's being considered uhm uh uh they seem to be interested in and it seems to centre on Harry Whelehan but we don't know that they 're considering impeachment <#> I mean I must say that in reference to what Gerard has said right <#> There are two ways that Harry Whelehan could now not continue in that job<S1B-031$B> <#> Well is there any way uh Gerard in which Harry Whelehan could resign as President of the High Court and remain a High Court judge and they would uhm appoint somebody else as the President <#> That would be a a compromise<S1B-031$A> <#> Well as I read the Constitution the President of the High Court is a separate office and uh I think Mr Justice Whelehan could of course voluntarily resign but may I say this uh that <,> uh again I know these are extraordinary times but the very notion of the government asking a judge to resign uh in these circumstances to do and I don't wish to be disrespectful to either party in government because I recognise the difficulties but effectively to do uh politicians of various ilks a favour uh is again something that is <,> just simply staggers the the lawyer 's imagination <#> Nothing of the kind has ever happened in the history of the State uh<S1B-031$B> <#> Because it would drag uhm a man who was involved in the political arena as uh Attorney General it would drag him back into the political arena and once you 're a judge you 're supposed to be above all that<S1B-031$A> <#> Absolutely <,> absolutely and that is the whole contemplation of article thirty-five of the Constitution and that 's why judges uh they 're subject to certain things that you and I can't do <#> They can't engage in politics uh they have to keep a certain reserve from the rest of mankind <#> But they 're given in return certain guarantees and one of the guarantees is that of independence<S1B-031$B> <#> Okay uh thanks very much Gerard for that for that contribution <#> Geraldine just going back to you about yesterday afternoon <#> Uhm the Taoiseach at several points uh made reference to the file that was seen by only one individual in the Attorney General 's office<S1B-031$C> <#> He did yes<S1B-031$B> <#> Yeah <#> In other words the the sort of cloak that is normally put over the activities of the civil service uh which didn't happen in the case of Brian Cowan recently where an individual uh came forward <#> But uh are we getting to the days where civil servants are going to have to be accountable for their actions and perhaps even in the Da/il<S1B-031$C> <#> Uhm I doubt it Pat <#> In the formal sense I doubt it <#> I doubt that that the government would bring in legislation or change the whole uhm constitutional balance of government for that to happen <#> I think what we 've seen are a few isolated incidents which are I I think <.> un </.> unfortunate because a minister in any department and Mr Reynolds made this clear is the technical and administrative and political head of that department and he is accountable <,> he is publicly elected and accountable to the Da/il for the actions of that department <#> So I actually don't think that we will see a change where civil servants can be named and blamed <{> <[> and I think that it 's a very undesirable </[><S1B-031$B> <#> <[> Because it seems to me that </[> </{> Mr Reynolds you know but Mr Reynolds uhm vindicated the Attorney General the former Attorney General Mr Whelehan now the the President of the High Court vindicated him <{1> <[1> totally </[1> yesterday <{2> <[2> <,> and </[2> and yet he said that there was blame to be attached but he didn't attach the blame except by mentioning that one individual had the file all the time<S1B-031$C> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1B-031$C> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1B-031$C> <#> Yes and that was one of the reasons why the statement as it stood yesterday was that that was the primary reason that it was unacceptable to the Labour Party <#> <{1> <[1> In </[1> in other words having uh having spelt out how this particular Father Smyth case had been handled in the Attorney General 's office <,> having found flaws that Mr in the handle of it which Mr Reynolds found unacceptable <#> <{2> <[2> He </[2> then went on to state in an important line on page eighteen of his statement uh that that nothing emerged that made Mr Whelehan unsuitable for appointment as President of the High Court<S1B-031$B> <#> <[1> Yeah he </[1> </{1><S1B-031$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1B-031$B> <#> So uhm if if a head had rolled in the AG 's office do you think that the Labour Party would have been I mean <{> <[> either the AG 's head </[><S1B-031$C> <#> <[> I don't I got no sense </[> </{> of that over the last number of days because that in a sense would address the handling of of the Father Smyth case and not the goings-on at last Friday 's Cabinet meeting <,> the breach of trust and the fact that Fianna Fa/il uh breached the whole spirit of constitutional government by making a decision uh uh without their coalition partners being present<S1B-031$B> <#> Okay well Geraldine all we can do is wait <{1> <[1> and </[1> see what uh emerges and <{2> <[2> thanks </[2> very much Frank for joining us on the line<S1B-031$C> <#> <[1> Okay Pat </[1> </{1><S1B-031$C> <#> <[2> Thank-you </[2> </{2><S1B-031$D> <#> I 'd just like <,> Hello Pat<S1B-031$B> <#> Yes<S1B-031$D> <#> Can I just make one comment there on what Geraldine was saying<S1B-031$B> <#> Yes<S1B-031$D> <#> You see the problem is that is the system that we operate within <#> I spent five years in the Department of Education and we are still operating a Victorian system of of administration in this country where a file when it came up to me as the Minister for State had to be signed and countersigned by five civil servants on the way up and it is impossible for the Minister to see everything that goes through his department and really this case points to the fact that we must change a very inefficient system of government and it doesn't surprise me in the least that Harry Whelehan uh didn't see this file <#> He should have seen it <#> But the fact of the matter is it 's the system in which we operate which is totally archaic and it <{> <[> needs to be fundamentally changed </[><S1B-031$B> <#> <[> But still </[> </{> <,> given what was stitched into the record by uh was it John Murray about uh the AG and extradition uh it is important that the the former Attorney General Mr Whelehan would have realised that the one thing he had to see were extradition warrants <#> That was the one thing he had to see<S1B-031$D> <#> Correct <#> There there was a very major mistake made and as the Taoiseach said there has to be a fundamental change in that office and indeed in in the whole system that operates <{> <[> within the civil service where you have you have very good </[> where you 've very good and talented civil service who are completely stifled by the system in which they operate<S1B-031$B> <#> <[> We we haven't got to the bottom </[> </{><S1B-031$B> <#> You see what people want to know is did he see every other warrant that arrived around the same time you know or that arrived after <#> Did he see all those warrants and was this the only one he missed or what <#> I mean we haven't really got answers to those questions and until we do this uh this uh this mystery will never be quite uh resolved in the public mind <#> Anyway look Frank uh it 's going to be a long day I suspect so thank-you very much for joining us uh from Leinster House<S1B-031$D> <#> Thank-you<S1B-031$B> <#> All the best <#> And Geraldine Kennedy also talking to us from there and thanks to Gerard Hogan of the Law School in Trinity for clarifying uhm the the lack of precedent in what Geraldine was speculating about <#> It 's twenty-five minutes to twelve</I>
