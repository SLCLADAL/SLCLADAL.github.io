<S1B-061 Traffic accident><I><S1B-061$A> <#> How long were you in the right-hand lane before you were hit from behind<S1B-061$B> <#> Uh I was in the <,> I was fully in the right-hand lane for quite a few seconds before<S1B-061$A> <#> But what <,> a few seconds<S1B-061$B> <#> No <#> A few minutes <#> It 's about fifty or sixty yards <,> to travel<S1B-061$A> <#> Well doing your best <,> how long <,> and I appreciate you didn't know this accident was going to occur <,> how long do you estimate you approximately <,> you were in the right lane having moved in it<S1B-061$B> <#> I just <,> I pulled out of the junction and I just went straight into the right-hand lane and I must have been in the right-hand lane a few minutes <,> five minutes <#> I 'm not too sure long it<S1B-061$A> <#> For five minutes<S1B-061$B> <#> Or two minutes <,> just<S1B-061$A> <#> Two minutes is quite a long <,> maybe it was <#> Was there heavy traffic at this time<S1B-061$B> <#> No there wasn't<S1B-061$A> <#> Well your estimate is you were in the right lane what for two minutes <,> <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> You 've already indicated to His Lordship that it was a distance of some sixty or seventy yards<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes <#> That 's right<S1B-061$C> <#> Can you indicate to His Lordship the speed at which you may have been travelling <,><S1B-061$B> <#> I was travelling quite slow because I had just<S1B-061$A> <#> Well <.> wha </.> what does that mean approximately<S1B-061$B> <#> Twenty twenty-five miles per hour<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$B> <#> <{> <[> Because </[><S1B-061$C> <#> <[> Now </[> </{><S1B-061$B> <#> Oh sorry<S1B-061$C> <#> Sorry <#> When you exited from Jungle Jim 's <,> were you already moving at that point or had you stopped again at the uh exit to Jungle Jim 's<S1B-061$B> <#> I was stopped at the junction from Jungle Jim 's<S1B-061$A> <#> So you you came to the exit <,> you stopped <,> you looked to your right<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes<S1B-061$A> <#> You saw a car in the distance <,> you thought you 'd time to get out <,> you moved across into the outer lane <,> indicated you were going right<S1B-061$B> <#> That 's correct My Lord<S1B-061$A> <#> And what happened then<S1B-061$C> <#> And you accelerated up to a speed you would estimate perhaps twenty miles an hour<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes <#> That 's correct <,><S1B-061$C> <#> Now <,> at that speed <,> one wouldn't have expected<S1B-061$A> <#> This sounds like a leading question coming<&> interruption of cross-examination and discussion of another case </&><S1B-061$A> <#> Apologies<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes okay<S1B-061$C> <#> Now Miss <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> you told His Lordship you were established in the right-hand lane <,> that you were indicating to turn right <,> uh this was the entrance to the Abbey Centre <#> Can you tell His Lordship precisely what point perhaps with reference to uh the photographs were you when the collision occurred <,><S1B-061$A> <#> Maybe photograph three is maybe the best of the three <,> subject to any views to the contrary from Counsel<S1B-061$B> <#> Photograph three <#> I had pulled into the right-hand lane again <{1> <[1> and </[1> the exit here <,> I had indicated to turn right <{2> <[2> and </[2> I was in the midst of turning when the impact hit from behind<S1B-061$A> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1B-061$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><S1B-061$A> <#> Well can you just mark on the photograph where where you were when the impact occurred <#> No <,> if you just mark it <#> You 'd need a pen <#> Somebody 'll give you a pen uh <,> <#> Right I thought you uh when you came out you 'd moved into the lane furthest <.> a </.> <.> a </.> away from yours <#> Is that right<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes that 's right<S1B-061$A> <#> I I I don't <,> I may show it to Counsel <#> I don't think she 's marked it correctly <#> She 's put it in the wrong lane from what she 's said so far <#> She puts it in the near-side lane instead of the outer lane<S1B-061$C> <#> Yes My Lord <#> I think I understand what 's happened<S1B-061$A> <#> Sorry <#> Do you agree it 's wrong on what she 's said so far<S1B-061$C> <#> I I do My Lord <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-061$A> <#> I 'm sorry<S1B-061$C> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> I believe I know where this misunderstanding<S1B-061$A> <#> <.> I </.> if you just look at the photograph <#> Just <,> just <,> do you see the photograph<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes<S1B-061$A> <#> Now when you <,> you <,> just look towards me a moment <#> You came out from there isn't that right <#> You came out there <,> you moved across towards the photographer and you were going to turn into<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes<S1B-061$A> <#> Now do you agree you 've marked it in the wrong place<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes I have <#> I 've marked <,> I 've marked where I came out of the junction<S1B-061$A> <#> Yeah no I <.> w </.> what I asked for was when you were struck <,> was what I asked you <,> in the moment of impact where were you<S1B-061$B> <#> Sorry I was here<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes well just <,> if you just would mark it afresh please <,,> <#> Well what I asked you to do was to <.> m </.> <,> is is that meant to be the outline of the front of your car <#> You 've drawn the line as distinct from an X <#> You 've just <.> d </.> drawn that in have you<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes <#> I was <,> that 's where I was turning into<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes I appreciate that 's where you were turning in but what I wanted you to mark insofar as you could do so is where exactly your car was when it was struck<S1B-061$B> <#> I was in the midst of turning when the car<S1B-061$A> <#> I know that but that could be anywhere from there up into here<S1B-061$C> <#> Just at the the start<S1B-061$A> <#> Would you just <,> the tradition is if you 'd put an X and I appreciate it 's an only an approximation <,> if you put an X as to where your car was when it was struck rather than that long line <#> And take your time <,> get it as accurately as you can <,,><&> picture is shown </&><S1B-061$A> <#> Thank-you<S1B-061$C> <#> You were already at the junction and ready to turn <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Now could you describe the actual collision to His Lordship<S1B-061$B> <#> Sorry <#> Repeat the question<S1B-061$C> <#> Could you describe the actual collision to His Lordship<S1B-061$A> <#> I <,> it may <,> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> <,> counsel knows all about it <,> you can't ask a leading question <#> He can't say to you for example <,> if I 'm correct you were sitting at a station and this car came along at twenty miles an hour and crashed into your rear <#> You can't say that <#> You have to give the reference not me <#> And he 's to ask the questions in a particular way <#> He can't lead you <#> So that 's why he 's asking you in this rather official way <#> Yes <#> Ask it again please<S1B-061$C> <#> Could you describe the collision to His Lordship<S1B-061$B> <#> My Lord <,> I was <.> t </.> <.> t </.> turning when uhm<S1B-061$A> <#> Now were you stationary or moving at the time<S1B-061$B> <#> I was <,> wasn't stationary but I was barely at a crawl <#> I was at a crawling pace<S1B-061$C> <#> Yes<S1B-061$B> <#> Indicating to turn right when I was just hit from behind <,> and the car swung me into the other lane then and we both came to a halt<S1B-061$A> <#> Which was your car <,> U UAZ or UIB<S1B-061$B> <#> UIB<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> Following the collision <,> can you tell His Lordship what you did<S1B-061$B> <#> Following the collision <,> we got out of the car <,> traffic had stopped <,> and Mr Wheatley got out of his car<S1B-061$C> <#> And that would be the driver of the other car<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes <,> indeed<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$B> <#> Both of us asked what happened <#> I said I didn't know what happened <#> I I was just turning and I I was<S1B-061$A> <#> Just just a moment please <,> <#> You say you both asked what happened<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes<S1B-061$A> <#> And what was said then<S1B-061$B> <#> We were unsure of who caused the accident or what happened<S1B-061$A> <#> Well if you just tell me first of all what you said and what he said <,> if anything<S1B-061$B> <#> I asked what happened and <,> Mr Wheatley said he didn't know and then he said that we should call for police <,><S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$B> <#> Mr Wheatley went to the car <,> asked me did we want to move the cars into the side of the road<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$B> <#> To let other drivers past<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$B> <#> I says no <#> And he said he was rushing <,> he was <.> l </.> already late <,> he was rushing to get to a football match <,><S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> Uhm <,> were the police called<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes My Lord <,> the police were then called<S1B-061$C> <#> And<S1B-061$B> <#> The children then were taken away in the ambulance to Whiteabbey Hospital<S1B-061$C> <#> Now you 've already told His Lordship that there was some discussion as regards whether or not the cars were moved prior to the arrival of the police <#> Were the cars moved<S1B-061$B> <#> No <,> indeed not <,> no<S1B-061$C> <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> Would you then tell His Lordship about after the police arrived <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-061$B> <#> The police then arrived and called for the ambulance <#> The children then were taken away in an ambulance to Whiteabbey Hospital <#> I stayed behind <,> my partner came up <,> I phoned for him to come up to see if I could get the car moved<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$B> <#> We then we moved the car and uh I followed on in my partner 's car up to the hospital to see the children <,><S1B-061$C> <#> Now how did you feel immediately after the accident<S1B-061$B> <#> Very shocked and <,> concerned more about the children <,><S1B-061$C> <#> Uhm <,> were you experiencing any problems physically at that time<S1B-061$B> <#> Just stiffness <#> I had hurt my chest on the <,> the steering wheel of the car and just <,> just shock and stress I think<S1B-061$C> <#> Now <,> at the point that the impact actually occurred <,> can you tell us what <,> what actually happened to you personally in the car<&> interruption in cross-examination as barrister takes instructions </&><S1B-061$C> <#> When you came uh to the junction uh and were about to take your left-hand turn on the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Road <,> did you check your right<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes <#> Indeed I did<S1B-061$C> <#> And <,> what distance was the car which was now coming down the street the car <,> what distance was it away from that junction uh when you looked to your right<S1B-061$A> <#> Uh do you mean from the junction she was at or the one<S1B-061$C> <#> Yes <,> from the junction you were at <,> to Mr Wheatley 's car <#> What distance <,> approximately <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-061$A> <#> Now that 's when you stopped and looked to your right before you exited <#> That 's what you 're<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes <,> <#> I 'm not sure My Lord how far back it would have been <,> how many yards I would be <,> but I believed he was far enough back he was just<S1B-061$A> <#> But but but that 's <,> see you 'll have to give some idea I mean you ran a hundred yards I 'm sure <,> maybe metres <#> You know what a hundred yards is approximately<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes<S1B-061$A> <#> Well was it half of that or was it a hundred yards or was it twice that<S1B-061$B> <#> It could have been seventy to a hundred yards <#> Yes it was<S1B-061$A> <#> Seventy to a hundred yards to your right<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes<S1B-061$A> <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> And <,> when you looked and you saw that car <,> you then believed that you had room for the manoeuvre <#> For the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> to start <,> you had to pull out onto the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> Road<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes that 's correct<S1B-061$C> <#> You had to change from the left-hand lane to the right-hand lane<S1B-061$B> <#> Go across the left-hand lane<S1B-061$C> <#> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> <#> But do you accept that you have to traverse across two carriageways <#> Is that right<S1B-061$B> <#> That 's correct<S1B-061$C> <#> And had to slow down <#> Yet you speeded up according to a friend to at least twenty-five miles per hour but by the time you reached the entrance to McDonald 's you had actually slowed your vehicle down to walking or crawling pace <#> That 's how you described it<S1B-061$B> <#> That 's correct<S1B-061$C> <#> And had indicated and then made the manoeuvre to the right <,> into the Abbey Centre<S1B-061$B> <#> That 's correct<S1B-061$C> <#> Now you knew before you pulled out that you had to make a series of manoeuvres <,> going from the minor road onto the major road and then making a manoeuvre from the major road into the right <#> Is that correct<S1B-061$B> <#> That 's correct <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> And you felt that the distance of seventy to a hundred yards would allow you to do that<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes I felt that he was far enough away for me to do that <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> See <,> I 'd have to suggest to you that the length of time that 's likely for you to have completed that manoeuvre would be something in the region of twelve seconds <,> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> ten to twelve seconds <#> It 's not an exact science but <unclear> several sylls </unclear> to say that that would be a reasonable time to allow you do to that manoeuvre<S1B-061$B> <#> Yes<S1B-061$C> <#> Now <,> do you disagree or agree with that<S1B-061$B> <#> I agree with that<S1B-061$C> <#> And I have to suggest to you that from a distance of a hundred yards to the point of impact <,> if this man Mr Wheatley had been travelling at twenty miles per hour <,> it would have taken about fifteen seconds to cover that distance <#> At twenty-five miles per hour it would have taken twelve seconds <,> at thirty miles an hour <,> ten seconds and at thirty-five miles an hour <,> eight point six seconds <#> So whatever speed he was travelling at <,> I have to suggest to you that he would have been arriving at or about the junction about the same time as you made the manoeuvre into it</I>
