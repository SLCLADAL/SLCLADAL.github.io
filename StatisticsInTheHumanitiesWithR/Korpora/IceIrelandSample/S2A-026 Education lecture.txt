<S2A-026 Education lecture><I><S2A-026$A> <#> Yeah <,> I mean <.> thi </.> this is an issue that comes up particularly in in in A-level <#> Once you get beyond the compulsory examination stage the actual numbers who are doing the things can become very important <#> Because <,> it would be possible to construct an argument either way using these data <#> You could argue on the basis of percentages that girls are doing better <#> But you could also argue that boys do better because there 's more of them end up with A-level Physics and various doors <,> whatever that <.> ope </.> that that opens for them <#> Uh sometimes in the rush to uh <,> sort of the moral panic around the under-achievement of boys <,> some of those sorts of subtleties were <,> were often very <,> got lost very quickly <#> There still are quite <,> uh uh quite marked <,> gender differences in terms of subject choice at uhm at A-level stage <#> And also that uh then feeds into quite marked differences in terms of uh subject choice in higher education <#> There 's now many more girls going into or young women going into higher education than young men <#> Uhm <,> but once they graduate <,> uh within a a shockingly short period of time <,> uh the young men are earning a lot more <#> Uhm and it 's not even <,> it 's not even due to the young women taking time off work to have children <,> babies <#> Uh the differential in earnings kicks in before that <#> Uh and it 's part <,> well it 's partly related to discrimination I 'm sure in the labour market <,> uh but it 's partly also related to subject choice that they 're taking and the areas of <,> the occupational areas that they 're <,> they 're going into <#> Uhm so that <,> that sort of difference <,> it 's important to keep that sort of thing in mind just in terms of the the nuances of the patterns of performance <#> And also the consequences of those sorts of choices further down the uh further down the uh the the the line <#> In the sort of broader debate about this uh issue on sort of boys ' under-achievement <,> there 's a variety of <,> of factors that are uh are uh are are sometimes uh linked to this <#> Uh this is uhm a series of factors I just pulled off a uh a CCA document which was distributed to schools I think two three years ago <,> uhm <,> uh which provided some some information on the uh the various possible contributing factors to boys ' under-achievement <#> Uhm and I 've just divided them up into well what I 've described as fundamental factors <,> uh genetic influences <,> puberty or <.> devel </.> body-development <,> uh early-learning or or child-rearing practices <#> Then a attitudes <,> uh explanations based on their attitudes to school <,> the sort of notion that boys have more of an anti-school culture <#> Uhm and then a third one was the school factors <,> to do with uh some of the reasons these things are actually played out in schools <,> differential learning styles or the uh the role of changes in examination format or uh coursework <#> Uh let 's sort of go through each of these in turn <#> First of all the fundamental factors <,> genetic influence of puberty whatever<&> later in class </&><S2A-026$A> <#> I have heard of cases in a <,> in in in an institution not that far away <,> where uhm the <,> there 's a a much lower proportion of men doing the course but they are much more relaxed about doing it because they make it clear that they see themselves being Principals in a relatively short period of time once they 've finished <,> and not having to do very much for that inevitable destination to fall into their lap <#> Uh and uh you know I 've been told that this is a sort of an approach which caused intense irritation <&> laughter </&> among their <,> their their fellow students the women <#> I don't know whether it 's true or not <#> I think it may just be a story <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> Okay <,> so as I say <,> that was some issues around uhm gender <,> uh things <#> The next thing I want to say is just a little bit about some issues around uh race in education <#> This is an issue that uhm really uhm didn't uhm <,> uh uh didn't come up in a big way in Northern Ireland for very many years <,> I think partly because of Catholics and Protestants spent so much time uh uh throwing bricks at each other <,> we we live with this illusion that uh uh even though we were terribly <.> na </.> nasty to uh each other in those terms we were actually very nice to everyone else <#> Uh and it wasn't <,> it wasn't until uhm someone uh started doing some research uh or or work in this area and started actually asking some of the ethnic minority communities uh how they were treated that we discovered that there was quite a lot of racist harassment uhm that was going on uh in in Northern Ireland <#> Uhm and partly as a response to that uh race legislation was brought in uh in the nineteen eighties it was originally <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> nineteen nineties uh to extend some of the uhm anti-discrimination legislation uh on race that had been in <.> no </.> in Great Britain since the nineteen sixties into uh in to Northern Ireland <#> And this was interesting in regard to schools because one of the things that the race legislation brought in was uh uh making it illegal to discriminate on the basis of services <,> which had never been involved in the uh the religion uh legislation <#> The fair employment uh legislation which outlawed discrimination on the basis of religion had always been focused on employment <,> not on the provision of services <#> This was seen as a sort of a very difficult issue to address in religious terms <,> partly because uhm it it could potentially <,> well there was a number of reasons why it was seen as a problem <#> One of the reasons why it was a problem was uh a fear that this would cause all sorts of problems in in country areas because apparently there is a certain tradition in country areas that whenever land is sold <,> it 's sold within a community so local arrangements aren't disturbed <,> but if you were to make uh discrimination on the basis of religion for the <,> for the provision of goods and services illegal <,> that sort of practice would be illegal <#> Uh another example that came up before the ceasefires <,> it was a very real issue for the civil service to try and work out <#> How could you make it legal <,> if you <,> I mean discrimination uh on the basis of religion for services was was illegal <,> how could you make it legal for a taxi-driver to refuse to take someone to a certain area if the taxi driver didn't want to do that for fear that whenever he got there he 'd be shot <#> Because that happened <#> Sometimes people were shot <,> uh taxi drivers were shot after being taken to to a particular area <,> just <,> taxi <,> a lot of taxi companies were linked to uhm one community or the other <#> Uh so all those issues then came up whenever this legislation came in because this made uh the provision <,> uh discrimination in the provision of services illegal and eventually they did extend that uhm <,> they did extend that uh services issue to <,> to religion as well <#> But the other reason why the services thing was important for race concern was that education is a service <,> and ever since this legislation 's been in place <,> uh it has been uh uh uh legally possible for someone from an ethnic minority community to consider the possibility of bringing a school to court if they <,> they feel that they 're given uh <.> u </.> unfair or uh sort of disadvantageous treatment in the provision of an educational service <#> Uhm I don't think it 's actually happened yet <,> I don't <,> I 'm not aware of any cases that it has happened <#> But there <.> a </.> are examples of cases in the South <,> in the Republic of Ireland where in in a sort of an analogous area there have been a <.> la </.> a very large number of of cases in the uhm Travellers <,> Irish Travellers being excluded from pubs <#> There 's an awful lot of publicans have been taken to court uh because they 've excluded Travellers <,> because this is a service uhm and uh there 's been quite a sort of uh heated discussion about that particular issue <#> But anyway <,> in Northern Ireland uhm the uh in terms of uh the numbers of the ethnic minorities they are uh relatively small <#> Uh in total the ethnic minorities constitute less than one percent of the of the uh of the population uh in Northern Ireland <#> This is figures just taken from the two thousand and one census where <,> the total population is one thousand six hundred and seventy <,> nine hundred and forty-two whites <#> Okay <#> And and uh the total ethnic minority population <,> uh well one percent of that would be what <#> Uh seventy-thousand <,> seventy-one thousand <,> uhm <,> and it 's considerably fewer uh in total number of ethnic minorities <#> The largest is the Chinese community <,> there 's a little over four thousand <#> Then <,> well the category 's called mixed <,> uh it 's I 'm not sure what what that means <#> The uhm uh Irish Travellers <,> just over fifteen hundred <,> Indians about fifteen hundred and others and some of the <.> sma </.> small groups <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> So two main <,> two main distinctive ethnic minority groups <,> Travellers and uh Chinese <#> Okay but the numbers of ethnic minorities in total are uh are uh are quite small <#> But nevertheless <,> because this is uh this is uh an issue <,> uhm the uh because of the race legislation and because of the greater awareness of the existence of the ethnic minorities <,> and also because of a greater awareness of the extent of uhm uh of uh racist harassment that uh that was taking place <,> uh the Commission for Racial Equality was established under this legislation as well although this was later subsumed into the Equality Commission <#> Uh and the survey form that I got you to fill out was something that the Commission for Racial Equality asked us to do as a sort of a very quick uh data-gathering exercise just to try and see the extent to which uh uh teachers uh said they were aware of some issues in relation to uhm ethnic uh ethnic minorities <#> If you just take sort of take a look at the questionnaire uh just to go through some of the items <#> Uhm <,> first one <,> did you receive any information on ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland a part of your initial teacher training <#> Any anybody say yes to that <#> Uh in the in the uh the uhm uh the survey we did <,> ninety-six percent said no <#> That sort of fits with uhm sort of your experience <#> Question two <,> have you had an opportunity to gain any information on ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland as part of in-service training <,> <#> Eighty-five percent said no <#> Uh <,> would you like to have an opportunity to gain information on ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland as part of the in-service provision <#> How many said yes <#> Yeah ah cos the <,> what we got was eighty-four percent saying yes to that <#> Uh <,> <.> c </.> question four <,> do you feel schools should provide special support for children from ethnic minority families <#> Should they provide support <#> Yeah ninety-one percent said yes <#> Should Northern Ireland pupils have more opportunity to learn about the cultures of ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland <#> Yeah <#> Ninety-five percent said yes in that <#> Do you feel schools should make special provision for children who may move school on a regular basis <,> for example Traveller children <,> <#> Bit more mix there</I>
