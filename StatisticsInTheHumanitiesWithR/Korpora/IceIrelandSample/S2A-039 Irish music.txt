<S2A-039 Irish music><I><S2A-039$A> <#> I 'm not sure how many of you can understand clearly what I 'm saying <,> uh <,> and <,> from the point of view of the English, and also from the point of view of the actual topic <#> Uh <,> so what I tend to do in a talk like this <,> is to speak at a <,> a general level <,> an overview <,> uh of what we mean by Irish music <#> Some of you may find that you 'll already know some of this <,> and if you do <,> fair enough <,> uh but I hope that there will be aspects of what I 'll say that will be new to everybody <#> Uh <,> people talk about Irish music <,> uh and I think it 's worth uh dwelling for a few moments on what we mean by uh Irish music <#> Uh <,> I think we mean traditional music <,> okay <,> uh and when we talk about traditional music <,> we uh have to ask ourselves what we mean by traditional music <#> I think we all think that we understand what uh traditional music is <#> I think it is difficult to define what traditional music is <,> but it 's relatively easy to identify a number of characteristics uh of traditional music <#> Uh <,> one obvious characteristic is that it 's an aural tradition <,> A-U-R-A-L <,> uh what we mean by that is that it 's transmitted from one generation to another <,> and from one person to another <,> by means of listening <#> Rarely do you see traditional musicians with a music stand uh reading from the music <#> So that 's one uh very important feature of it <#> Uh <,> and I suppose an aspect of that feature is the fact that it 's transmitted from generation to generation <,> uh maybe vertically and horizontally from one person living in one district to another person uh living in another district <,> so you get uh transmission both in time if you like vertically and at the same time uh horizontally if I can use those expressions <#> Uh <,> there <,> I suppose two characteristics <,> it 's aural and it 's transmitted from person to person <#> In the process of transmission it 's very obvious that the music is subject to variation and change <#> And a very simple example of that is that if I pick out twelve people here and transmit a story to you and <,> you and you and you and so on <,> uh we can simulate maybe uh twelve or twenty transmissions if you like of the story <,> and at the end the story will probably be the same <,> in the sense that the essence of the story is the same but the details can have changed quite significantly <#> Uh and we find that there are plenty of examples of that <,> evident in the case of recorded music <,> and indeed in the case of uh music being transmitted uh today from one musician uh to another <#> Uh and because of that then <,> we uh have to come to the conclusion that there may not be one correct uh version of the story or one correct version of the piece of music <#> If you stand up and tell the story or you tell the story well you 'll say well look this is the story as I have it <,> and so it is but it can differ slightly from your story because of your age or your uh country of origin <,> or your language even <,> uh or your experiences and your method of expression and so on <#> However <,> we can still identify definite boundaries within which we 'll say well look that 's a different story <,> that 's come from somewhere else and so on <#> Uh and in the case of music <,> uh that may even be more clearly defined in some respects because we 're governed by uh other factors like metre and vowel length and phrasing and tonality and in musical uh type constraints if you like <#> Uh <,,> now generally speaking when we hear the expression Irish music uh being used today <,> people tend to be thinking of traditional music <,> uh even though strictly speaking I suppose that if we talk about Irish music <,> you can talk about uh the classical music let 's say written by Sea/n O/ Riada <,> you can talk about U2 's music <,> you can talk about a wide range of music if you 're talking about Irish music <#> However it 's generally accepted that when people talk about Irish music they mean traditional music <#> And if you turn on the radio and hear De/ Danann <,> or hear the Chieftains <,> you 'll say that 's Irish music <,> if you hear U2 you 'll say that 's rock and roll <#> You don't say it 's Irish music <#> Uh <,> I know that we could dwell for a long time on the semantics and definitions of those expressions but for our purpose here today I think we 'll just use the expressions as they 're used normally by people <#> Uh <,> in the case of Irish music as we now call it <,> it 's convenient I think for our purpose to divide it into two categories <#> Now there are many ways in which we could divide it but for simplicity we can divide it into the categories of instrumental music and what we call the sean-no/s uh singing which is the uh old Gaelic-style singing <#> I 'll come back to that later and I 'll I 'll give you the uh the Gaelic expression for it <#> The instrumental tradition <,> uh for many people <,> this is the first introduction to what we call Irish music <#> <.> Peop </.> as I said a while ago <,> you turn on the radio <,> and you 'll hear the Chieftains you 'll hear De Danann or something and you 'll say <,> well look <,> that 's Irish music <,> or if you don't know what it is <,> you 'll say look <,> what 's that and somebody 'll tell you <,> it 's Irish music <#> And in ninety-nine percent of the cases it 's going to be instrumental music <,> dance music <#> Okay <#> Uh so it 's not surprising then that we dwell quite a lot on the instrumental music and specifically uh on the dance music <#> And again when people talk about Irish music <,> they generally mean the instrumental dance music <#> Okay <#> So if people talk about Irish music <,> they certainly won't mean U2 <,> they may not mean the sean-no/s singing <,> but almost certainly they 'll mean the uh uh the instrumental dance music <#> Okay <#> So again we 're going to use that expression uh that loosely <#> Uh now the instrumental music is primarily dance music and of course the <,> how do we know it 's dance music <,> well all we have to do is listen to it <#> Somebody here mentioned if you had uh room or space or inclination to dance <,> and the carpet is not the best for dancing I 'm not complaining about the carpet for other purposes <,> but for dancing it 's not the best <#> Uh certainly the dance music is very rhythmic <,> there 's absolutely no doubt about that <#> If you listen to uh traditional music <,> traditional dance music <,> probably the first feature which makes itself so obvious is the rhythm <,> okay <#> And of course <,> dance music must have uh rhythm <#> It 's very energetic <,> uh <,> I think it 's very exciting <,> there are exciting melody lines <,> uh exciting contours to the melody and so on <#> So it 's very very obviously dance music <#> Uh many many traditions uh in various countries have their own individual uh forms of dance music and their own individual dance metres <#> Uh some of those are common across a large number of countries <,> but seeing that we 're talking about this country we 'll stick to uh what we have here <#> Uh <,> and there are various dance rhythms <,> okay <#> Many of you will be familiar with rhythms like the waltz <,> which is one two three one two three <,> like that <,> as distinct from a march <,> which is one two three four <,> and so on <#> Uh so if we can extend that sort of thinking we can identify jigs reels hornpipes slides polkas uh uh set dances <,> maybe waltzes <,> mazurkas and so on <#> Without any doubt the most common uh dance metre is what we call the reel <,> R-E-E-L <,> uh followed by I think the jig <,> J-I-G <,> jig <#> Now within the jig there are a number of different categories <#> I 'll play you some examples of those <,> but if we talk for a moment about uh what the specific metres or specific rhythms uh in these cases are <#> I 'll play two examples here now <#> In the case of the jig <,> for those of you who read music <,> who are interested <,> the jig is a six eight time <,> six quavers in each bar <,> six over eight <,> uh and the rhythm is very clearly dah de de dah de de dah de de dah <,> dey ah de de dah de de dah de de dah <#> Like that <,> okay <#> And as well as having the six notes <,> one two three four five six <,> in in some respects <,> it 's not so much the notes in themselves are important <,> but the meaning that you get from the notes <,> and in particular the rhythm which comes from that <#> Uh and I suppose we can we can use the analogy of speech <,> and certainly the analogy of poetry <,> where you have metres and stresses and so on <#> Uh we have a similar sort of thing in music where we 'll stress particular notes and particular beats <#> In the case of the jig <,> we stress notes one and four <,> one <whispers> two three </whispers> four <whispers> five six </whispers> <,> one <whispers> two three </whispers> four <whispers> five six </whispers> <,> like that <#> <&> speaker does extended example of jig rhythm with voice </&> And if I do that <,> we all know it 's a jig <#> I 'm lilting <,> okay <,> or I 'm humming <,> even though I 'm not playing anything and I 'm not even varying uh the notes <,> I 'm just doing on a note of a one pitch <&> imitates jig rhythm with voice </&> <#> Okay <#> On the other hand <,> well maybe if I play that first for you <,> and see<&> plays jig and reel </&><S2A-039$A> <#> Well suffice it to say that all the other dance rhythms have their own unique uh features <,> and even within the two that I 've uh given you there are many variations <#> That last reel for instance <,> there are many variations possible within that <#> But generally speaking it 's true to say that there will be a one two three four backbeat like that <#> Now <,> I mentioned earlier that it 's dance music uh we 're talking about and if you turn on the radio <,> or you go to a concert <,> uh or you go to a session in the pub <,> the chances are that you 'll come to the conclusion that dance <,> that Irish music is played mostly in a listening environment <#> Okay <#> And that 's true <#> Most of the music is played for listening <#> You get a thousand people going in to a concert hall to sit down to listen to the Chieftains playing dance music <#> Okay <#> Uh and you may <,> if you think about it you may say well look is that somewhat not not strange <,> all this is dance music <,> they spend two hours playing dance music <,> and people sit down listening to them playing dance music <#> Uh and how did that come about <#> Uh <,> in the past <,> there 's no doubt that this music evolved <#> When I say in the past now I mean up to maybe the late forties middle fifties <,> so the first half of this century certainly <,> and before that uh this music was played in people 's houses <,> in people 's homes <,> uh as a form of entertainment and also for house dances <,> okay <#> So much more so in the past <,> this music was played for uh dancing situations <#> It was also played for uh in a listening situation <,> but with the demise of the house dances uh and I suppose the swing in the <,> in social centres from the houses to the pubs uh the music went to the pubs and to the concert halls and to the radio and television and consequently we found that it was being played much more so for listening to <#> Now musicians uh <,> fall into two camps if you like <#> There are musicians who hate playing for dancing <,> and there are musicians who like to play for dancing <#> Now I like to play for dancing but I don't like to do it all the time <#> Okay <#> Because we look at the music differently and we think about the music differently when you 're playing for dancing as distinct from when you 're playing for uh listening to <#> And of course <,> one of the most obvious differences is the question of speed <#> If you 're playing for uh people dancing <,> clearly the dancers will dictate the tempo at which they want to have it <,> and generally speaking <,> the music needs to be played as fast <,> lively <,> strong <,> and rhythmic uh for dancing</I>
