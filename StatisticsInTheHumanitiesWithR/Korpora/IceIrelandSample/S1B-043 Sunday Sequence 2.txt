<S1B-043 Sunday Sequence 2><I><S1B-043$A> <#> Their story begins in Northern Ireland as the elect people <#> What does that do when it comes to looking at memory and how memory is used in telling a story<S1B-043$B> <#> Yes ah yes <#> Well I I think it is that the the story uh has become the story which justifies a position of domination <,> and that 's its purpose <#> I you see I don't think it 's necessarily very important what story groups of people tell <,> it 's the use to which they put the story <#> And the uh use to which the story has been put in the North of Ireland is to justify a position of dominance <#> Now I think there is also a what I called a Catholic Nationalist story <,> which uhm in the course of time came to serve a similar purpose <#> Uh as you say we we 've got the big battalions therefore we have the right to call the tune <#> And my purpose in writing the book was to show that what we have to do with in Ireland is two mutually incompatible and mutually exclusive ideologies <,> what I 've called the Catholic Nationalist one and the Protestant Unionist one <#> Though I 'm perfectly aware of the fact that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group but I 've called them those <#> And that it is really uhm a mistake on the part of liberally-minded people to say <,> let 's ask these two to settle down together and live comfortably together and respect one another <#> They were constructed precisely in order not to live with one another and they were constructed precisely in order to have one group dominate over another <#> Now uh what I have suggested in the book is that you have to try and transcend <,> these two <#> It 's not a question of giving them uh equal respect <,> as is often said by well-meaning people <,> but rather to try and transcend these two uh mutually exclusive ideologies<S1B-043$A> <#> But that must be an extremely difficult thing to do <#> I mean to transcend means that you might have to debunk some of the mythology that has grown up around <,> the Catholic story and the Protestant story <#> And you talk about prophetic voice <#> Do you have a prophetic way in which the Churches could actually do that<S1B-043$B> <#> Yeah I I I I 'm not saying that I do but uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that <,> uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but in fact neither of them does <#> Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features <,> but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming <#> Now we know of course how dangerous <.> li </.> <.> li </.> light uh after the collapse of Stalinism <,> uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this <#> We know how dangerous that is <#> But at the same time what we have in Ireland or have had in Ireland I think of recent generations is uh two uh ideologies which are pretending to a future end that they don't actually believe in any more <#> There 's no future uh in attempting to go back to pre nineteen sixty-seven which is broadly speaking all that Ulster Unionism has to offer <,> uh nor is there a future in Catholic Nationalism <#> And I I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be <,> for us all together <,> uh but has simply continued to mouth <,> ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which won't do it for us<S1B-043$A> <#> But the two protagonists to the conflict might disagree with you uh seriously <#> For example if you walked through the areas of uh uh Loyalist Belfast you 'll see that men will take up the gun to fight for God and Ulster <#> They 'll say that 's our vision <#> We want <,> to to maintain the link with Britain and we want to maintain our Protestant ethos <#> We want <,> to regenerate that ethos with each new generation<S1B-043$B> <#> Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it <.> i </.> it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision <#> And uhm I think uh this is also true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive<S1B-043$A> <#> But has Catholic Nationalism any part to play for example in the struggle that is taking place in Northern Ireland today <#> I mean what <,> uh what kind of primacy do uh the IRA the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism when they have their vision of a united Ireland<S1B-043$B> <#> Well this is is of course a very good question because I think what we 're seeing at the moment is a division isn't it <#> I think that <.> th </.> that the Catholic Church <,> faced with the fact that it is losing ground <,> uhm is I would say reprehensibly accepting patronage uh from government sources <#> And there is a strong anti-clericalism <#> Uh they 're being used in other words to shore up inside the Catholic community uh opposition to the IRA <#> Now inside the IRA there is quite understandably a strong anti-clerical feeling <#> Now uhm I think that uhm <,> the the Catholic Nationalism represented by the official Church organs in say let us say West Belfast has no particular vision for the future <#> Uh I 'm not sure however that the IRA does either because I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are <,> fundamentally at fault because they they are behaving as though the enemy uhm of us all is the British Empire <#> Now the British Empire has disappeared <#> I think there are great forces that uhm are undermining the possibility of the future for all our children <,> in this island <#> But I 'm quite sure that it is not the British Empire <#> And uh in the same way uh I 'm quite sure that the kind of <,> civil and religious liberties that Protestantism has stood for <,> uh are not particularly well defended by a Protestant monarch sitting in uh Buckingham Palace <,> but are preserved by forces that really don't have very much to do with whether you 've a king or a or don't have a king<S1B-043$A> <#> So are you actually saying uh in a sense that uh the stories <,> the two stories one Protestant the other Catholic Nationalist one Protestant Loyalist <,> they 're actually crumbling <#> They 're crumbling now in front of a world which is changing rapidly and the ideologues of both camps aren't prepared to accept that<S1B-043$B> <#> Yeah I think that 's I think that 's true <#> And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group <,> or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group <#> So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say <,> uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine <#> But it 's a very different thing to talk about nineteen sixteen in a beleaguered street in West Belfast <#> In the same way men may talk about the <.> ca </.> the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on <#> But we speak as the dominating sex <#> It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman <#> And it is important however always for the dominating group to listen uh ever more clearly to and ever more attentively to the dominated people <#> Now <,> it 's not always going to be a a nice experience to do so <#> And you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that and it isn't quite like that <#> But you can't do it <#> You must listen <#> Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not <.> ne </.> always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard <#> And as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance <,> down the road <,> that by the articulating of their story as they see it <,> that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling <#> And if we won't listen to them now to the dominating group <,> they won't get through that stage<S1B-043$A> <#> I 'm just wondering whether that paradigm is functional today in Northern Ireland because <,> in a sense the dominant group I 'm talking about Unionists <,> are no longer dominant in any real sense because they don't have any <.> c </.> uh they don't have any control over <,> political power <#> It 's it 's direct rule from Westminster <#> They feel that there is a a democratic deficit <#> They are in the process of creating a new story <#> A new story which evolves around <,> look we 're victims too<S1B-043$B> <#> Yes yes I I I actually tried to talk about that in in this book right that it it must be taken uh uh on board by people particularly the establishment let us say in Dublin <,> uh that the Unionist people <,> are a group of people whose usefulness to their masters if we may put it like that without offensiveness is over <#> And it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have <.> la </.> by and large been <,> that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them then you don't try to win them over as friends <#> Now their usefulness <,> in terms of the old imperial structures <,> is over <#> That 's finished <#> That story is finished <#> They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb <#> Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people <,> on this side of the border to be magnanimous <,> and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly <,> uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment <#> So I take your point entirely<S1B-043$A> <#> And that book by Terence McCaughey Memory and Redemption is published by Gill and Macmillan price twelve pounds ninety-nine <#> As we pointed out at the beginning of the programme the Methodist Conference is currently meeting in Dublin <#> One of the issues discussed on Friday concerned the role of Methodist societies in the local community <#> The conference would like to challenge Methodists throughout Northern Ireland to rediscover their identity as a community church <#> When I spoke to the Reverend David Cooper <,> Secretary of the Methodist Council on Social Welfare I asked him to explain what that challenge involved<S1B-043$C> <#> One of the challenges that that brings to us as Methodists is how do we serve these communities <#> And uh one of the reports before us this year is to seek to help Methodist churches not to be an end in themselves but to be a means to an end in the sense that we want our Methodist churches to serve the community<S1B-043$A> <#> Now you said how we can serve these communities the plural <#> Are you suggesting that you have to serve other Protestant communities in these segregated areas of Northern Ireland<S1B-043$C> <#> Well I I think we have to recognise the fact that there is an increasing number of people within Protestantism who are alienated from the Church</I>
