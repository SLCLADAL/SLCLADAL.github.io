<S1B-054 Water supply><I><S1B-054$A> <#> Would the honourable gentleman give way on this point<S1B-054$B> <#> Yes I will<S1B-054$A> <#> Uh does he not uh agree that the uh Government who seem to be so keen on doing this even without consultation have been putting these points over and over again and putting in some people 's view a one-sided view of the advantage of this to children <#> And uh all we have heard from the Government is a one-sided view of the so-called medical evidence <#> And that has been put and put and put again <,> whereas those that have been opposing it haven't had the same opportunity to put the other side <#> And therefore I think this report wants a thorough discussion of the whole matter <#> And where best to discuss it but at the local government level where you 're nearer to the people and you have the representatives of the people<S1B-054$B> <#> I would accept entirely what the Member has said <#> I I have said that in uh attempting to establish this Commission we want to examine the evidence for and against <#> We want to see it set out clearly side by side so that we can come to an objective decision <#> And that is exactly what the Honourable Member has said and which <,> I agree with him <,> has not been done <#> There has not been equitable consultation and that is exactly what we want to see <#> What I don't want to see us doing is going up to speak to a Minister and have the usual exercise <quote> nice to see you to see you nice <#> Goodbye </quote> <#> We don't want that <#> We want to put forward to him a specific proposal on which we will request him to act to ensure that what we are asking for is done <#> An equitable form of consultation <#> Now we 'll draw attention to the summary of the key recommendations that we have put forward in eight one to eight five <#> We believe that if this is done <,> the decision that we arrive at will be fairly done on the basis of equitable consultation and not in fact on the basis of a motion <#> Thank-you Mr Chairman<S1B-054$C> <#> Thank-you Mr Curran <#> Mr Sam Gardiner<S1B-054$D> <#> Thank-you Mr Chairman <#> May I start by paying tribute to Mr Smyth for his able and wise leadership of the committee <,> to Mr Arnold <,> secretariat and his support <,> for their dedicated work in the overcoming of many obstacles<S1B-054$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-054$D> <#> I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to chair a number of the meetings that dealt with this contentious subject <,> both <.> eviden </.> taking sessions and deliberative sessions <#> So I know only too well the strength and feelings on the subject <,> and the emotions it can stir up <#> Like the Chairman I too was greatly impressed with those who came to testify and it was during this course of oral sessions that my personal views on the subject underwent a change <#> I commend this report to the Forum for its even-handedness and fairness <#> It is a totally balanced piece of work and it is the produce of some hours of agonising for all of us <#> It represents a compromise because as chairman at some of these sessions I can tell you that there was much give and take <#> And it <,> and it is that what makes the report a document that could be subscribed to <#> It is true that everyone did not get everything they wanted but that is the nature of such things <#> The report does set out <,> to <,> uh not to criticise <#> That was not our function <#> Instead we record facts as we saw them <#> If that <,> if if that appears to some as unduly critical so be it <#> But the tenor of the report is really and truly quite mild <#> Our <.> r </.> recommendations are unanimous <#> No-one to my knowledge <.> disa </.> disagreed with our conclusions <#> There are some <,> it is true <,> who have wished that the committee had gone further <#> But there 's only so much you can do to take on board before the boat begins to take in water and we felt that we had reached that point <#> The whole problem as we see it stems from the statutory arrangements and the central focus of the report in this area <#> We feel that the present system has starkly highlighted a democratic decifit <.> decisi </.> <,> deficit <,> at <.> l </.> at least this must be so if heed is not taken to our recommendations <#> Chief among these is the need to take on board <,> <.> chie </.> chief among these is the need to take on board in full measure the views of public representatives <,> and in this case the local authorities <#> Today I make a plead for unity and full-hearted support of this motion from the Forum so that the weight may be added to the sterling efforts of the committee and those who served it <#> That is the tone I <{1> <[1> would like to see </[1> <,> I would like to <{2> <[2> see set </[2><S1B-054$E> <#> <[1> Would Mr Gardiner give way </[1> </{1><S1B-054$E> <#> <[2> Would Mr Gardiner give way </[2> </{2><S1B-054$D> <#> Yes I do<S1B-054$E> <#> Mr Gardiner it 's just to give you the opportunity to come back <#> I I felt rather insulted <,> and I 'm sure he didn't mean it that way by the Labour 's uh representative Mr Curran when he stated that his representative Dr Alan Evans wasn't given an opportunity <#> Would you Mr Mr Gardiner agreeing with me some of the meetings that you chaired and certainly those that I chaired that everyone <,> but everyone <,> be they voting members or not were given equal opportunity to present their case <#> And would you also Mr Gardiner confirm with me that at no time and in fact I went to great lengths to spell it out <,> at no time but no time did we ever criticise any board or in fact any person who came to us be they for or against <#> Would you so confirm<S1B-054$D> <#> Yes Mr Chairman I would agree with those sentiments of Mr Smyth and I 'm sure that colleagues that served on the Health Committee would endorse what he has also said <#> Today I make the plea for unity and full-hearted support of this motion from the Forum so that weight may be added to the sterling efforts of the committee and those who served it and I think that answers uh Mr Smyth and and uh <,> <.> i </.> it 's a message also to Mr Curran <,> that uh uh I should <,> I should just add that the Health and Social Services Councils fully oppose fluoridation and these bodies set up to advise the public also need to be taken seriously <#> I know Mr Chairman it is the mind of the Ulster Unionist party that mass medication should not be added to the water <,> and the people of Northern Ireland be giving a free choice<S1B-054$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-054$D> <#> I commend this report to the Forum and I have great uh pleasure in supporting the motion moved by our chairman of the Health Committee Mr Smyth<S1B-054$C> <#> Thank-you Mr <,> thank-you Mr Gardiner <#> Mr Gregory Campbell<S1B-054$F> <#> Thank-you Mr Chairman <#> Could I join in the tribute paid to the uh chairman of the Health Committee Mr Hugh Smyth and to the secretary Mr Denis Arnold for the uh diligent work that was undertaken to produce this report <#> Uh just to put it in its proper context uh Mr Chairman the issue of the uh possible fluoridation of the water supply came at the very end of the Minister 's consultative uh process <#> Therefore time was running against the committee from the very inception of the project uh and I want to concur with uh both the chairman 's interjection as well as Mr Gardiner 's comments that uh in all the time that I was on the committee at no time did I perceive or see or hear from any Member that there was a a feeling that their views had been overlooked or had not been taken fully into account <#> Uh in fact uh at the last meeting we had uh yesterday I think I made that very point <,> that any views that people had in terms of reservations uh had been fully aired and could be aired on the floor of the Forum today <#> And I think that was uh adhered to by all members <#> Mr Chairman the committee faced uh a most difficult task because the facts of the matter are that the <,> North <,> that Northern Ireland 's dental health is very poor <#> That is a fact that I think is uh admitted by everyone in this debate <#> It is about the only thing that everybody does agree on in this debate but they agree on that <#> But surprisingly enough <,> the dental health of particularly children <,> uh and that is what the the fluoride debate is aimed at at the <.> he </.> dental health of of young people <,> but surprisingly enough the dental health of children in Northern Ireland <,> while it is poor <,> it is not as poor as the dental health of children in some fluoridated areas <#> So even there we get into a dispute about whether or not fluoride uh leads uh unequivocally to better dental health <#> That was one of the the issues that we were faced with <#> The fundamental thing Mr Chairman was that we as a committee <,> uh first of all we received unsolicited uh evidence from those who were opposed to fluoride uh then after opening it up and going <,> such was our <.> en </.> endeavours to try and ensure that we did cover uh uh the issue from either side that we <.> o </.> we opened it up to those who were in favour of fluoride <,> despite the fact that we didn't have to <#> We had advertised <,> and we had received evidence and uh submissions from those who were against <,> but we asked those who were in favour to come forward and then they did <#> Having done that we were then faced with a very difficult task in that we were given evidence of an extremely strong nature against fluoride <.> o </.> on one part of the day and on the same part of that day later on we were given evidence of a very strong nature that was in favour of fluoride <#> So the committee was faced with uh an onerous task of trying to determine uh what would be the best way to establish whether or not this uh Health Committee would join with all of the Health Councils in Northern Ireland who are the uh uh the consumer watchdog in favour uh of uh better representation by the public in terms of uh of the delivery of health services and twenty-five of the District Councils and vote against fluoride or not <#> That was the the task that we were faced with <#> We uh <,> uh in receiving the evidence on either side <,> uh those who were in favour of fluoridation really uh <.> whe </.> when you boil it down they <,> <.> thei </.> their views revolved around this factor that fluoride in the public water supply will improve the dental health of children <#> They they say it will improve the dental health of everyone but basically the problem lies uh with young people <#> Those who were opposed to fluoridation said that there are mixed views <,> that the evidence is at best mixed uh in terms of proving that <#> And that there was very strong uh indications uh that said that the suppression of immune defences would result from fluoridation of the water supply <,> that mottling of teeth would occur and that the brittling of bones would occur uh uh to a greater degree uh in fluoridated water <#> So again the uh <,> the the the disparity that existed between the two sections of evidence became more pronounced <#> For me and I know for virtually everyone on the committee the issue then transcended that of public health of young children in our society <#> It then became uh uh an issue for most of us I think in fact for virtually all of the committee which was do we accept that there will be a project that will affect virtually every man woman and child in Northern Ireland <,> beyond which no person will be able to opt out of <,> because all of us in some way or other are affected by that which comes through the public water supply</I>
