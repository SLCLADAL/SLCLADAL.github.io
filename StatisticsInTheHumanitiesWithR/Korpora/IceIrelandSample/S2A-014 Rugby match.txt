<S2A-014 Rugby match><I><S2A-014$A> <#> Welcome to Lansdowne Road <#> Thank-you Ger uh we are looking down at a Lansdowne Road which has been fairly drenched in the last twelve hours but at the moment <,> mercifully the rain has ceased the ground may have the chance to dry out <#> It 'll be very difficult I should imagine for the players because the wind which was blowing quite strongly is still there <#> It may not be quite as bad <#> But spectators have come from all over for this and the England supporters in huge numbers anticipating as you said that they would be winning their sixteenth Triple Crown today <#> The series goes going back to eighteen seventy-five <,> this the one hundred and fourth in the series <,> England having won fifty-nine games <,> Ireland thirty-six <,> and the draws there have been eight <#> The last one here in nineteen sixty-eight when Ireland and England drew nine all <#> The band waiting for the arrival on the field of the England side led by their captain Will Carling <,> and the Ireland side led by their captain Rob Saunders <#> Very testing and nervy moment and the teams coming out <,> England in their tracksuits and led by their captain Will Carling <,> and Simon Hodgkinson coming out there <,> the man who has kicked so far thirty-eight points in the two matches played <#> Going for the all-time record in the championship of fifty-four points <#> A very strong side and the England subs <,> coming out at the end of the party Michael Skinner the last one out <#> And now Lansdowne Road prepares to welcome this new-look exciting Irish side <,> scorer of four <.> tr </.> fine tries in Cardiff and hoping that they will be able to get some reasonable possession today against this very strong English pack and maybe we 'll see some more exciting action from the Irish backs <#> So the England team and replacements on the field as the band strikes up to welcome the Irish captain led by their captain Rob Saunders <,,> <&> band plays </&> <#> There 's Fitzgerald <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Gordon Hamilton and Keith Crossan in his thirty-fifth international becoming Ireland 's most capped winger <#> Brian Robinson <,> Jim Staples <,> last onto the pitch <#> As the teams will line up and shortly they will be presented to the President of Ireland <,> and <,> as the Irish team just loosen up there the English team in their tracksuits and probably very wisely in their tracksuits <,> keeping out the rather cold wind <,> <#> Uh with me Tony Ward <#> A very nervy moment but uh undoubtedly England starting this game as favourites but Ireland certainly not without a chance<S2A-014$B> <#> Yes I would agree <#> In fact it 's ironic uh we were saying earlier about the weather uh the fact that it 's changing <,> it 's got very very wet but normally that would favour Ireland <#> But the England style of play where they rely very much on the rolling maul <,> obviously it 's literally going to suit them down to the ground <#> Having said that the weather and the slippery ball will also help us to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> them and that 's something we 're going to need to do from the start <#> So it 's a great occasion and uh I certainly know that we 're going to see a very spirited uh display from Ireland<S2A-014$A> <#> Now Her Excellency <,> President of Ireland <,> Mary Robinson <,> has gone to Lansdowne Road and <unclear> several words </unclear> she 's wearing the green of Ireland as the presidential salute is played <,,> <#> Will Carling the England captain presented to Her Excellency and the rest of the England team Jeremy Guscott there <,> Simon Hodgkinson <,,> Rob Andrew <,,> and some of the <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Dean Richards and Peter Winterbottom all there <#> Mike Teague played so well with the Lions <#> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> keeper <#> And and that was the reserves <#> The referee this afternoon Alain Cecillon from France with two French touch judges <#> And Rob Andrew Pat Saunders introduces his players to <,> <#> Not too sure Tony whether it was a good idea for the Irish players to come out without their tracksuits <#> Tony<S2A-014$B> <#> Yeah I reckon it 'll be very cold uh down there <#> Certainly that 's a good idea by the English on their part <,> to come out wearing them because this five minutes uh normally it 's a very nervy time but particularly when it 's as cold as it is out there at the moment it certainly doesn't help<S2A-014$A> <#> Ireland making two changes following their impressive display against Wales with Keith Crossan recalled to the left wing to win his thirty-fifth cap <,> thus becoming Ireland 's most capped winner <#> In the forwards <,> a towering Neil Francis at number five returns after a year out of the team in a bid to counter England 's lineout specialists and captaining the side again is scrum half Rob Saunders in his third international <,> determined that Ireland will produce some of the same play that they showed in Cardiff with more discipline and fewer errors <,,> <#> And England following their comfortable wins over Wales and uh Scotland field an unchanged side in their bid to win the Triple Crown for the sixteenth time <#> The remarkable Simon Hodgkinson again at fullback having kicked a record seven penalties against Wales and a further seventeen points against Scotland <#> They 've given few opportunities to run to their backs <,> halfbacks Hill and Andrew have used the possession to peg back the opposition <#> The strength of the England side of course very much up front with the tall Wade Dooley six foot eight and Paul Ackford six foot six <#> Obvious dangers in the lineout <#> But with five in the side on the wrong side of thirty <#> Maybe this would be their last chance of glory in the championship <,,> <&> Amhra/n na bhFiann plays </&><S2A-014$A> <#> So Lansdowne Road giving a fine rendition of <&Irish> Amhra/n na bhFiann </&Irish> and <.> an </.> earlier it 's given quite uh an enthusiastic rendition of the new song for Ireland to the air of Danny Boy <#> The Ireland team now to play with the benefit of this wind in the first half <#> There is quite a wind blowing downfield from this end as we look at the very fine pitch at Lansdowne Road <#> But it has absorbed a lot of water Tony and uh it 'll be interesting to see what effect it 'll have on the players<S2A-014$B> <#> I think it it <.> sor </.> certainly will get cut up very very quickly and it will be <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> to see if the two games to date there 's a very good <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> I 'll be very surprised if they do certainly in the first half of this game <#> I think they 'll seek to try and wear Ireland down <,> they 'll seek to use the rolling maul <#> So obviously for our part we are going to put it wide and the underfoot the conditions are certainly not going to help us<S2A-014$A> <#> So Ireland having won the toss in this Digital International at Lansdowne Road <#> Referee Alain Cecillon from France prepares to watch Rob Andrew start this international and the only thing they need now is a football <,,> <#> Packed Lansdowne Road <,> tickets at a premium <#> There really wasn't a chance of a ticket <#> A huge crowd has come over from England hoping to see this England side score their first Triple Crown victory since nineteen eighty <#> They 've already beaten Scotland <,> they 've already beaten Wales <#> Can they beat England <#> Can they beat Ireland <#> Rob Andrew then starts this one hundred and fourth international <#> Philip Matthews in possession on his own twenty-two <,> driven back by the England pack but Ireland control it well <#> Rob Saunders waits <,> takes the responsibility himself <#> A lineout fifteen metres inside the Irish half <#> Fine young player is Saunders just twenty-two years of age <,> third international <,> born in Nottingham of Scottish parents <#> And England are the first to vary the lineout <#> Matthews stands back <,> Francis goes in <,> Matthews takes <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> for Ireland <,> Saunders kicks into the twenty-two <#> Hodgkinson challenged by Simon Geoghegan <#> England twenty-two<S2A-014$B> <#> It 's a great start by Ireland and again twice Philip Matthews was involved <#> From the kickoff he set up a good ball for the clearance initially and there again set up a lovely tuck to give Rob Saunders the time to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> down the uh the side of the field <#> Good kicking by Rob Saunders<S2A-014$A> <#> Steve Smith to throw <#> Up towards the front of the lineout <,> Neil Francis standing at two <#> Four is Rigney <#> England win it though <#> Back to Hill <,> to Andrew but the England backs have moved forward <#> Andrew did well <#> When Andrew went to pass there as he was challenged by the Irish back row <#> Will Carling was ahead of him so he had to go for the clearance by the kick <#> Back of the line for Ireland is Gordon Hamilton <,> number seven <#> Brian Robinson just in front of him <,> <#> Smith 's throw <#> Penalty against Ireland in the lineout as there was won by Dean Richards <#> Ireland trying to barge through to prevent the England jumpers <#> Rob Andrew from inside the England half finds a good touch inside the Ireland twenty-two <#> He got a last yard out of that <#> Well I 've said it many times before <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> <#> He plays such a simple and unselfish game <#> He 's a smashing outside man <,> <#> Smith 's throw <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the England side <#> Whistle goes <#> Referee gives the scrum and awards the put-in to England <#> Certainly the two England second rowers liable to cause Ireland some problems in the lineout <#> Now what about the scrums <#> Rob Andrew I think in back <,> in a drop kicking position <,> just out of picture <,> lying very deep as indeed are all the England backs <#> Hill puts in for England <,> dummy run <#> Richards carries at his feet <#> Big drive by the England pack into the Irish twenty-two <#> Scrum turns <,> comes back and it 's a penalty against Ireland in the scrum <#> And whether that was for deliberately wheeling it <,> or for offside I 'm not too sure but the French referee had no hesitation as the English forwards put on the pressure in that scrummage<S2A-014$B> <#> And I think it may have been for offside in the end against possibly Gordon Hamilton but uh I certainly hope that 's not ominous because that didn't look good at all <#> There 's no doubt <,> <.> i </.> it 's not specifically the change of Francis for Galway but the mere fact that we 've changed the pack we 've had for the last two games it naturally it 's going to be uh it 's going to take a little while for this eight to settle down</I>
