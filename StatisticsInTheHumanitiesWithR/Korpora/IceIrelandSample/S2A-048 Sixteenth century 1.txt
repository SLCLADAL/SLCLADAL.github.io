<S2A-048 Sixteenth century 1><I><S2A-048$A> <#> Nobody can afford to govern independently of the great Anglo-Irish houses <#> And the first person to experience this dilemma was the person who welched on the Kildare Pardon in fifteen thirty-seven <,> Lord Leonard Grey or Poor Leonard Grey as he began signing himself self-piteously uh within a few weeks of his appointment to office <#> Think of the situation that confronted Grey when he took up office <,> <#> A lot uhm he had to assume responsibility of the government of the entire island and Cromwell gave him a massive <,> massive army <,> a Tudor juggernaut of conquests that amounted at the very most to guess what <,,> <#> Five hundred men <#> You know uh <,> a little more than uh O'Rourke had <,> a little more than O'Reilly had <,> but less than <.> wha </.> considerably less than what both of them had together and nothing compared to what O'Neill of <,> O'Donnell <,> and Desmond had <#> And in fact he never really kept <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> because letter after letter came from Cromwell asking him to reduce the garrison and by fifteen thirty-eight do you know what he had <#> Two hundred and fifty men <#> Anybody who thinks that the Tudor conquest started in the fifteen thirties has to take into account this scale of failure <#> There just is no force there <#> And just as Cromwell from the safety of Whitehall was insisting that his Irish Lord Deputy maintained this piteously small garrison <,> so he was also intervening in Irish affairs regularly in a way that he wouldn't have interfered with Kildare back in the fifteen twenties <#> How <#> Seeking appointments of his favourites to office <,> uhm asking critical questions of his conduct <,> listening to criticisms arising from Kildare 's own English <,> sorry I should say Grey 's own English councillors in Dublin <,> people like John Alen <,> people like William Brabazon <,> who were running a kind of Underground Railway back to Whitehall telling Cromwell all the bad things that Grey was up to considering <#> Here is an English Lord Deputy <,> unknown in the country <,> who was now forced to govern in the country with a piteously small force <,> and who doesn't even have the same kind of authority amongst the English in Ireland than Kildare would have had <#> That 's the first of his problems <#> There 's another problem too <#> They hadn't gone away you know <#> Sure <,> the House of Kildare went <,> sure <,> uh the Earl of Kildare himself died of sickness of heart in the Tower of London and his son and five of Lord Offaly 's uncles were executed at Tyburn in the summer of fifteen thirty-seven <#> And a few other unfortunates were dragged out and hanged drawn and quartered in Dublin itself <#> But that 's the limit of it <#> They didn't destroy the entire Kildare alliance <#> They didn't even destroy the entire Fitzgerald of Kildare family <#> But all over the country <,> amongst the O'Connors in Offaly amongst the O'Briens in Clare or Thomond amongst the Devlins in Munster <,> and amongst the O'Donnells and the O'Neills in Ulster <#> All the members of the old O'Neill <.> all </.> of the old Kildare alliance remained untouched <#> They 'd taken the head off the hydra if you like but the body remained intact <,> and very upset <#> So all over the country the new English <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> <,> had <,> to deal with a highly unstable <,> volatile <,> potentially hostile political faction <#> That 's another of his problems <#> The third of his problems and it mightn't seem like a problem at first sight but you 'd want to be fairly thick not to see it as so <#> There were people who were willing to help out <#> Yes indeed <#> He was not entirely without friends <#> Indeed <,> leaping to his aid in fifteen thirty-seven <,> there were of course the ancient rivals of the Fitzgeralds of Kildare <,> to wit <,> the old enemies <,> the Butlers of Ormond <#> Don't worry about it <#> We 'll do it for you <#> We know exactly what you need to do in Ireland and what effectively you need to do in Ireland is hand over the reins of power to us <#> We will <,> we suggest that you conquer the midland Irish <#> We suggest that you invade the Gaelic Lordships of South Leinster <#> And I know you can't do it but I 'll tell you what <,> we 'll do it for you <#> Uhm we 'll lead developments <#> What seemed like an offer of support was really a takeover bid <#> So here 's the situation <#> He doesn't have an army <,> he doesn't have money <,> he doesn't have the kind of respect amongst his own councillors that Kildare would have had <#> He has an extremely angry and unstable Geraldine alliance all over the country to deal with and the only people who 've offered to help him are people who want to subordinate him to their own factional agenda <#> Over to you folks <,> <#> Given the circumstances <#> What would you do<&> discussion with students </&><S2A-048$A> <#> Oh there was a way out <#> He did it <#> He made peace with the enemy <#> Not the Butlers <,> but with the Geraldines <#> And in fifteen thirty-seven for the first of three perambulations of the country Grey moved south and made his peace with the greatest surviving remnant of the Geraldine alliance <,> with James Fitzgerald <,> claimant to the earldom of Desmond <#> He 'd no right to it <#> The Earl of Desmond uh the real legitimate Earl of Desmond was skulking in Whitehall uh but James Earl of Desmond or James the claimant of the Earl of Desmond refused to recognise him <#> And you know what <#> The English Lord <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> said that 's fine with me <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> And on the basis of that renewal of a Geraldine alliance with a key member of that alliance <,> Grey succeeded in opening doors all over the country <#> With Desmond 's support he moved westward and northward into Ulster <,> signing indentures with old Geraldines left right and centre <,> assuring them that <,> ah what had happened at Maynooth <,> unfortunate accident <,> fit of pique don't you know <,> and he had no further intention of attacking the Geraldine group and that if they only would do one little thing <,> if they only would uhm surrender <,> to his person <,> the surviving heir to the House of Kildare one Gerald Fitzgerald half-brother to the Thomas Offaly who 'd been spirited away by the Geraldines from Maynooth upon the capture of that castle <,> if they would just see their way in handing him over everything would be hunky-dory <#> He made no further move <,> no further attempt at confiscations <,> no further attempt to arraign people for trial for treason <#> Now look at the advantage of what this <#> What he 's done is he has exploited the vulnerabilities of the Geraldine group <,> they need him <#> And the fact <.> wh </.> that that he was indeed related by marriage as a brother-in-law to Thomas Lord Offaly <,> nevertheless he had him executed <#> The fact that he was related by marriage to the House of Kildare <,> that he could claim to be Geraldine by alliance at any rate helped him in this way <#> He made his peace and they offered him two things <#> They offered him first of all entrance <#> They weren't going to cause all that much trouble for him <#> Uh at least in the immediate future <#> They offered him leverage through the country <#> It was Desmond and Desmond 's allies who gave the bodyguard <,> who gave the safe passage <,> who arranged the movement of the Lord Deputy and his momentous troop of around two hundred and fifty men <,> around the country without any embarrassing hiccups <#> And in this way Lord Leonard Grey managed to constitute the first English viceroyalty in Ireland as something of a figure in the land <#> Okay <#> That 's what he did and that enabled him to cope with well you know the lack of men <,> the lack of money <,> and the dangers of Geraldine instability <#> But it had its downside <,> notice <#> Any suggestions<&> students speak </&><S2A-048$A> <#> Very very cross indeed <#> And by the end of fifteen thirty-seven <,> James Butler <,> heir to the House of Ormond was shrieking that My Lord Deputy is none other but my Lord of Kildare born again <,> that he was in effect a Kildare replacement <#> And there were other people dissatisfied with what Kildare <,> with what Grey had done as well <#> The English councillors <,> both the English Irish who 'd been the authors of those reform tracts I spoke about yesterday and the English-born administrators who 'd come with Grey to Ireland who 'd expected to be getting a piece of the action in the place once they arrived <,> and had expected at the very least to be treated as superior to the defeated Geraldines <,> were deeply disappointed indeed <#> And they too in the person of the people like William Brabazon and John Alen <,> the Lord Chancellor <,> uh began complaining mightily to Thomas Cromwell and to Henry the Eighth of the treasonable goings-on of their own Lord Deputy <#> And by fifteen thirty-eight this combined register of complaint of the House of Butler and of the English councillors within the government administration issued in the establishment of one of those most deadly instruments of Tudor rule <,> a commission of inquiry <#> In fifteen thirty-eight Grey had to face a commission of inquiry headed by Sir Anthony St Leger <,> with two other figures William Cavendish and Thomas Minn who came to investigate a whole raft of things but especially Grey 's conduct in regard to the Geraldines and in regard to the Butlers <#> And they held open sessions and they heard all kinds of evidence and Sir Anthony St Leger took all the evidence carefully and it is preserved and it is a deadly indictment <,> the kind of thing that would nearly send somebody to the block <#> It says that acting ultra-vires acting beyond his powers <,> the Lord Deputy had actually recognised as an earl somebody who was not the legitimate heir to the earldom <#> The Lord Deputy had waived those to the uh and pardoned <,> waived the charges against and pardoned those who had been involved in the Kildare Rebellion and that the Lord Deputy was making his own private treaties with Gaelic Irish Lords to wit O'Neill and O'Donnell <#> Serious stuff isn't it <,,> <#> And in <,> fifteen thirty-eight after the uh close of their enquiries they <,> commissioners return with a big sheaf of material which they presented in whole to Thomas Cromwell <#> Deadly stuff <#> You know what Thomas Cromwell did with it <#> What did Charlie Haughey do with the uh Hamilton Report <,> the Beef Enquiry <#> Put it on a shelf <,> forgot about it <#> And Thomas Cromwell <,> between fifteen thirty-eight and fifteen forty <,> said nothing about it at all <#> Why<&> student speaks </&><S2A-048$A> <#> Yeah <#> I 'll tell you what <#> This guy 's cheap <#> You know <#> This guy he 's not costing me any money <#> There is no trouble <#> I 've got enough troubles of my own handling this king and the one thing that I do know about Ireland is that it 's not giving me grief at this moment <#> So the St Leger report stayed on the shelf <#> Now there was a further problem afflicting poor Leonard Grey <#> He 's one of the few people whose self-pity I do actually respect <#> And the second problem was that the Geraldine alliance was of course a matter of convenience <#> They didn't like him <,> they didn't trust him <,> they knew what he had done in regard to the Kildare family itself <#> They needed him but if they could get in a chance of moving beyond him they would <#> And a key element in this was a refusal of the Geraldine alliance the Geraldine league <,> to hand over the surviving heir <#> Search where he would for him Grey could not find him <#> And matters became a little more tricky when the heir 's mother <,> Eleanor Butler Countess of Fitzgerald <,> did a very brave thing <#> She conducted a diplomatic revolution <#> Now hitherto <,> the principal <.> alli </.> allies Ulster allies of the Kildares <,> a big Ulster Kildare axis <,> was founded on marriage agreements <,> several marriage agreements <,> of the O'Neills of Tyrone with the Fitzgeralds of Kildare <#> Con Bacach O'Neill the chief of the O'Neills married into the Kildare family and even more than that had been recognised as a liege <#> You remember I was saying to you last time round that uh one of the ways in which you could cease to be the king 's Irish enemy and become the king 's English subject was to get a grant of denization <#> <unclear> several syllables </unclear> and was legally regarded as an Englishman <#> That kind of alliance <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Con Bacach uh had been uh cool about the rebellion <#> Sure he 'd come down and rattled his sabre and uh and burned fields in the Pale when the rebellions broke out <,> but once the heavy guns came in <,> once the ordinance was moved in and once Maynooth got shelved he went oh but this wasn't supposed to happen at all at all <,> and <,> on Desmond 's advice in the later fifteen thirties he had uhm <,> he had made his deals <,> he had made his deals with Grey <#> And it was to break up this realignment that Eleanor Fitzgerald had moved <#> You know what she did <#> She got married <#> And who did she marry <#> She married Manus O'Donnell chief of the O'Donnells and the principal regional rival of the O'Neills of Tyrone</I>
