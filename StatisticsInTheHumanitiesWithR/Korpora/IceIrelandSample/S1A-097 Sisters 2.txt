thought he wouldn't <,,> </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah yeah <#> Oh wouldn't she just thought I </[> </{> would 've thought <,> I would 've thought <{> <[> he would 've been concerned </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Yeah it 's </[> </{> a different kind of scene to the <{> <[> the drink you know <#> And I don't think he </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah yeah <,> it is really <,> <#> Yeah </[> </{> <#> I mean it 's too dangerous when you look at the likes of Bobby Nelson<S1A-097$A> <#> It is <#> It is <#> <{> <[> Oh it 's absolutely frightening absolutely </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> <unclear> 2 sylls

get your ear pierced <#> Where are you going <#> And he said oh this place in Nemo 's Arcade <#> And I said you have to go somewhere hygienic or you 'll get AIDS or something <,,> <#> <{2> <[2> And Ben </[2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Too young yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Mm <,> would </[2> </{2> he not be afraid of that<S1A-097$A> <#> And Ben said something and he <.> s </.> <,> and he turned round and said I wasn't speaking to <{1> <[1> you <,> </[1> in this tone <#> And I said get up that stairs to your room <#> I really wanted to thump him <{2> <[2> really viciously </[2> <#> I wasn't speaking to <{3> <[3> you <,,> </[3> <#> So I said get up that stairs <#> So after a while he called Ben out and said I 'm sorry <#> It 's just blah blah blah <#> So anyway <{4> <[4> I said </[4><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Oh Lord </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[3> Yeah yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-097$B> <#> <[4> Well at </[4> </{4> least he did that<S1A-097$A> <#> Yeah anyway I said uhm <,,> but it 's kind of getting to the point where I 'll say that and he 's going to say no <{1> <[1> and then you 'll think what the hell do you do then <,> </[1> <#> I mean he 's really getting quite aggressive you know <{2> <[2> quite nasty <,> at times you know <#> And kind of <,> I 'm bigger than you and this kind of thing <,> </[2> <#> So anyway I <,> then he wanted to talk to me so I came out to the bottom of the stairs and he said he was sorry and all that <#> And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but <,> you know you have to be careful and that <#> <{3> <[3> So in </[3> the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done <#> So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as <{4> <[4> bedamned you little </[4> shite <&> laughter </&> <#> I hope <{5> <[5> it 's real sore </[5><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah <,> yeah what do you do then yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah yeah <,,> yeah yeah </[2>

If it 's the right one you 're gay<S1A-097$B> <#> Oh I see<S1A-097$A> <#> And boy would he not like to be <{> <[> taken for a gay </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Oh I thought </[> </{> it was only uh that it didn't matter which one <#> If it was one you were gay<S1A-097$A> <#> No no the right <{> <[> one is gay </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> I see </[> </{> <#> I see<S1A-097$A> <#> But real aggressive <#> Then this morning he and then he starts saying to me uhm will you give me the bus fare tomorrow to go into town <#> Now he had thirty-five pounds and he had coughed up five on the dope <#> And I thought I 'd like my frigging job <{1> <[1> sweetie giving you your twenty-five </[1> p <#> And I said no you can use your own money <#> <{2> <[2> And then he marched into </[2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah that was for </[2> </{2> today was <{> <[> it <#> Oh </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Yeah then he </[> </{> marched into me today saying can I have my pocket money <#> Like he gets <,> I think <,> I forget now I think it 's two pounds <#> <{1> <[1> I 'm <.> m </.> </[1> I 'm all mixed up with Christmas <,> <#> And I said no <,> you 've enough money <{2> <[2> <,> <#> I </[2> really thought you know the cheek <#> <{3> <[3> I mean I 'm hardly going to finance anything else </[3> <,> <#> But uhm <,> he just <.> k </.> got up this morning and he 's permanently wants to have baths <#> Now when you turn on the water for a bath the radiators have to go off and everyone is fucking freezing <#> <{4> <[4> <,> I </[4> mean you you kind of have to pick your <{5> <[5> time <,> </[5> <#> And I said no <#> I said no you can't have one <#> It 's too cold <#> No it isn't cold <#> It 's not a bit cold <,,> <#> <{6> <[6> <.> Re </.> </[6><S1A-097$B> <#>

<#> <[6> Mm it is bloody freezing </{6> </{6> <#> I was just reading in the paper they 're saying there 's snow coming<S1A-097$A> <#> I 've kind of believe it <,> it just <{1> <[1> feels like that tonight </[1> <#> Even though the sky is very clear <{2> <[2> it just has that really cold feeling </[2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah does really </[2> </{2> <#> Bitter<S1A-097$A> <#> But anyway he was just the face of him now would just stop a clock you <{1> <[1> know cos he can't have his bath </[1> <#> Like he 's in there every <,> at least every second day <{2> <[2> <,,> you know <,,> <#> Oh anyway </[2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah yeah <,> <#> It 's </[2> </{2> a bit much alright<S1A-097$A> <#> It is a bit much <#> And and <{1> <[1> I </[1> certainly would worry about you know <,> he 's bad enough as he is and he 's going into a phase that will be so difficult with him going out and <{2> <[2> that kind of thing <#> I dread it you know </[2> <#> I really dread it <{3> <[3> <,> kind of going </[3> out and vanishing and <,> <{4> <[4> hanging </[4> round in gangs and this kind of thing <#> It <,> he was kind of slow to do it but it has happened <{5> <[5> now very <,> very abruptly you know <#> Yeah </[5><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> I know I know I know </[2> </{2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[3> Yeah yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-097$B> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><S1A-097$B> <#> <[5> I know yeah </[> </{> suddenly yeah yeah <#> If he was only kind of really into the study <{> <[> or that </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Oh </[> </{> not a hope I mean to <{> <[> kind of hang onto him to do the <,> <#> </[> He is <#> To hang onto him to do the Junior Cert and then kind of <,> at least til he gets over that reasonably you know <#> It would be some job you know<S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah <#> He is bright </[> </{><S1A-097$B> <#> Yeah yeah or he might even go on to the Leaving Cert<S1A-097$A> <#> Oh he 's certainly <,> I mean go on to do it <#> <{1> <[1> Sure he 'll only be fifteen in July when he 'll certainly </[1> <,> but just kind of <,> even if he kind of went off the rails a bit then and got back <,> before the Leaving like <#> <{2> <[2> There 's after the Junior Cert there 's this uhm </[2> <,> transition year where <{3> <[3> they <,> just kind of do enjoyable things </[3><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Mm oh right yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[3> Yeah yeah </[3> </{3> yeah they can go into jobs <{> <[> and that and get experience </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{> but uhm <,,> <.> i </.> it 's just a whole phase <{> <[> I 'm not looking forward to you know <#> I really dread it <,> you know </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> I know <#> I know <#> I know <#> Yeah yeah </[> </{> and probably boys are that bit much more <{> <[> difficult </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah and more aggressive you <{> <[> know very aggressive now <,,> </[> <#> You know <,><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah yeah yeah yeah </[> </{><S1A-097$B> <#> God doesn't seem any <.> de </.> length since he was a small child sitting on my knee<S1A-097$A> <#> I know I know <#> <{> <[> God </[> he wouldn't sit on it now I 'll tell you <&> laughter </&> <#> Look crooked at him he 'd accuse you of being a perv <&> laughter </&><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-097$B> <#> Oh Lord<S1A-097$A> <#> So <,,> it 's the worst really <,> the worst phase from <{1> <[1> when </[1> they kind of start that til when they 're about <{2> <[2> eighteen you know </[2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> yeah until you kind of feel <{> <[> they have to be a bit responsible for themselves </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> You kind of feel </[> </{> yeah that really there isn't much more you can <{> <[> do after that you know <#> But it 's really </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{> but at least he 's staying there tonight now <#> Is he<S1A-097$A> <#> Yeah yeah <#> <{> <[> He is here </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Mm <,> does </[> </{> he want to go to the disco again<S1A-097$A> <#> Uh no no he 's said he said he wanted to stay there tonight which I <.> w </.> uh stay here <{1> <[1> tonight </[1> <#> He 's just gone up to Mike now for a while <{2> <[2> but <,> </[2> I was pleased with that you <{3> <[3> know </[3> <#> He went last weekend so <{4> <[4> <,> I </[4> mean that 'll be it really maybe <,> maybe once or twice more now before the exam you know<S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Mm mm </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1A-097$B> <#> <[4> Mm </[4> </{4><S1A-097$B> <#> Yeah yeah <,> <#> And how 's Sharon<S1A-097$A> <#> Grand grand <#> I mean at a <,> a much easier <,> <{> <[> phase you know </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Mm mm </[> </{> <#> She 'd probably be easier anyway<S1A-097$A> <#> I 'd say she would yeah <#> <{> <[> I 'd say she would I mean </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah <,> </[> </{> <#> She 'd be more into the books and that<S1A-097$A> <#> She would yeah <{1> <[1> I 'd </[1> say <#> I mean you never know kind of <#> <{2> <[2> They all have their moods and that </[2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> No you don't </[2> </{2> I suppose yeah<S1A-097$A> <#> But no I mean he 's always been sort of difficult <{1> <[1> <,,> and </[1> cheeky and that <#> But this kind of <,> look now that really makes you just boil <&> laughter </&> <{2> <[2> with rage you know </[2> <,,> <#> Really kind of trying it out you <{3> <[3> know </[3> <#> And I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know <,> do something or go upstairs or do you know <{4> <[4> and he 's going to say </[4> no <#> And then what do you do <#> And <{5> <[5> that </[5> you kind of avoid that because once he realises he can say no and get away with it you 've had it <,> <{6> <[6> you know </[6><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[3> Mm </[3> </{3><S1A-097$B> <#> <[4> And he 's gonna say no </[4> </{4><S1A-097$B> <#> <[5> Yeah </[5> </{5><S1A-097$B> <#> <[6> Yeah yeah </[6> </{6> <#> What do you do <{> <[> really </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> What do </[> </{> you do <#> <{> <[> You know </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <&> ingressive airstream <&> yeah <&> ingressive airstream </&> yeah <,,><S1A-097$A> <#> So <&> sigh </&> <,> and I mean uh you see with the others too the whole dope thing is so acceptable <#> He has seen so much of this you <{1> <[1> know <,> that </[1> kind of it 's <,> it 's so much part of life <#> And Ben was saying he just does not want Sharon getting that <{2> <[2> <,,> picture you know just <,> <#> Yeah yeah </[2> he just doesn't want her to kind of view this as sort of <{3> <[3> something </[3><S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah I can understand that totally yeah yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-097$B> <#> <[3> Yeah as </[3> </{3> norm<S1A-097$A> <#> Yeah yeah <,> I agree completely <#> I <{1> <[1> mean I </[1> had no control really over the others <{2> <[2> and <,,> </[2> I think luckily that Mike has kind of changed his tune to some extent<S1A-097$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$B> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-097$B> <#> He seems to have <#> <{> <[> How is he </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Yeah but he </[> </{> <,> seems to be fine<S1A-097$B> <#> Does he <{> <[> yeah <#> I rang uhm </[> <,> the Frankie O'Dea 's boyfriend I think a second night <#> I don't think I was telling you <,> and he said she was going to have her sinuses cleared out<S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Seems to be grand yeah </[> </{><S1A-097$A> <#> Oh right <,><S1A-097$B> <#> Which is a fairly big thing I <{> <[> think </[> and it can be very painful<S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Ugh </[> </{><S1A-097$A> <#> Sounds horrible <{> <[> yeah </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <,> <#> I I remember actually when I was in the hospital a woman in the next bed having it and she looked absolutely wretched <{> <[> I was thinking </[> <#> I didn't say that to him<S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-097$A> <#> But I 'm sure it 'll <{> <[> be good when it 's done </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> But it probably will </[> </{> help yeah <,> <#> So she must be still in or I imagine she 'd have given a call you know <{1> <[1> that <,,> <#> So </[1> it might be the beginning of a a kind of a <,> a change for <{2> <[2> her you know </[2><S1A-097$A> <#> <[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$A> <#> <[2> It might </[2> </{2> <#> Yeah yeah <,,><S1A-097$B> <#> So I don't think there 's any other news really no <#> <.> A </.> As I said I 'm eating too much <#> My waistline has gone completely <&> laughter </&> <#> <{> <[> I 'm just a lump </[><S1A-097$A> <#> <[> Who cares </[> </{> <&> laughter </&> <#> Who

</{> skirts feel tight and that <#> <{1> <[1> You feel well </[1> maybe now for the New Year <,> I mean that Unislim did marvels for me <{2> <[2> you know <#> The discipline of it </[2><S1A-097$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-097$A> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah <,> <#> And also </[2> </{2> I mean in the cold everybody eats more <#> <{> <[> You have to </[><S1A-097$B> <#> <[> Well they do </[> </{> <#>
