<S1B-002 English supervision><I><S1B-002$A> <#> That 's most of one chapter <#> That 's the chapter on identity <#> I haven't <{> <[> got </[> the Higgins onto it<S1B-002$B> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{><S1B-002$A> <#> Onto it because uhm I haven't finished reading Scenes from a Receding Past <#> I 've sort of just done about Elizabeth Bowen <unclear> several sylls </unclear> there 's no actual introduction into that<S1B-002$B> <#> Where <,> where 's this going to fit then<S1B-002$A> <#> Well that 's <,> I think going to be the first chapter and then I 'm going to have<S1B-002$B> <#> After an introduction<S1B-002$A> <#> Yes <#> And then I 'm going to have the gender chapter next<S1B-002$B> <#> Right so this is <{> <[> identity </[> identity<S1B-002$A> <#> <[> Following on from that </[> </{><S1B-002$A> <#> That 's all basically just uhm Irish Ascendancy <.> iden </.> identity<S1B-002$B> <#> This one<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$B> <#> Yeah <#> Scribble here<S1B-002$A> <#> So hopefully I 'll get the Higgins uhm left in for you some time next week<S1B-002$B> <#> Okay uhm <,,> right <#> Okay <#> Uhm well obviously then I 'd need to<S1B-002$A> <#> Read over again<S1B-002$B> <#> Aha <,> have a look through this <#> Uh and how 's it going generally <#> Just in terms of <{> <[> work you 've already done <,> and so on </[><S1B-002$A> <#> <[> Well uhm </[> </{> I 've got most of the background work that I want to do now and I 'm trying just to really centre on the texts themselves rather than<S1B-002$B> <#> Right<S1B-002$A> <#> Put in too much literary criticism <#> You know <,> which we did last week <#> Get it down onto the text and actually what 's in the book<S1B-002$B> <#> Uh-huh<S1B-002$A> <#> Rather than what other people have said about it <,> so I 've done I think enough background <,> unless you think I should do some more <{> <[> uhm </[> criticisms <#> Uhm it 's going not too bad except I 'm working full-time now <,> so it 's a bit uhm<S1B-002$B> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><S1B-002$B> <#> What are you up to<S1B-002$A> <#> Well I 'm working full-time in Dillon 's now <,> again<S1B-002$B> <#> Where<S1B-002$A> <#> In Dillon 's<S1B-002$B> <#> Oh right so you 're back there<S1B-002$A> <#> Back there again for a year or so and uh <,> well until I have uhm decided what to do <#> So it 's it 's a bit tough then trying to fit everything in but<S1B-002$B> <#> Mhm<S1B-002$A> <#> It will get done <#> I 'm hoping to get the identity chapter done <,> or the sorry the gender chapter done <,> over the next couple of weeks<S1B-002$B> <#> Right <,> so<S1B-002$A> <#> Time 's moving in <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1B-002$B> <#> Sorry say that last bit again<S1B-002$A> <#> Time 's moving on I should say <&> laughter </&> <#> Uh you know it 's not going<S1B-002$B> <#> Mhm<S1B-002$A> <#> To start getting it written<S1B-002$B> <#> Right so <,> the setup now is that you 've got the <,> there 'll be an introduction <,> there 's this and a draft of the first chapter<S1B-002$A> <#> Mhm <#> Yeah<S1B-002$B> <#> But you said the <,> was it<S1B-002$A> <#> The Higgins isn't <{> <[> <,> attached </[> on to that there <#> I didn't do the Higgins yet <#> I 've got uhm <,> I 've got <,> I read Killachter Meadow<S1B-002$B> <#> <[> You wanted to add more to this </[> </{><S1B-002$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$A> <#> As well so I want to include that<S1B-002$B> <#> Mhm<S1B-002$A> <#> But I 'd rather read <,> finish off Scenes from a Receding Past first<S1B-002$B> <#> Mhm <#> Is that proving useful at all<S1B-002$A> <#> Yes <,> it is <#> Yeah <#> I 'm enjoying it actually <&> laughter </&> <#> I 'm really really enjoying it <#> It reminds me a lot of Banville <,> I see wee things in Books of Evidence and stuff <,> Book of Evidence and stuff<S1B-002$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$A> <#> Written at the time but it just reminds me of Banville 's language<S1B-002$B> <#> No I think I mean <,> well I think it 's a very under-rated novel and uh<S1B-002$A> <#> I think it 's much much better than Langrishe Go Down<S1B-002$B> <#> I wouldn't go that far <,> I prefer Langrishe but the uh <{> <[> <#> No <,> I really </[><S1B-002$A> <#> <[> I don't like the </[> </{> fact that it 's only like Imogen 's story and Helen and <{> <[> Lily </[> are obviously shoved to the side<S1B-002$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1B-002$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$A> <#> I think that 's a failing in it <#> But<S1B-002$B> <#> Mm<S1B-002$A> <#> They 're very different <#> But it certainly is is proving useful<S1B-002$B> <#> Yeah <,> good<S1B-002$A> <#> It 'll be particularly useful for the gender chapter I think<S1B-002$B> <#> Mm<S1B-002$A> <#> More so than identity<S1B-002$B> <#> So <,> there 's the gender chapter <,> then then what else<S1B-002$A> <#> Then the <.> con </.> conclusion<S1B-002$B> <#> Right <#> So that 's <,> that 's probably pretty much it <#> Cos I I 'm just sort of looking at <,> thinking in terms of length <{1> <[1> and </[1> so on you 've got what <{2> <[2> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[2><S1B-002$A> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><S1B-002$A> <#> <[2> It 's probably about </[2> </{2> four thousand words there I would say <#> Near it<S1B-002$B> <#> Yeah that 's probably <,> it 's not <,> not too bad <#> I mean if you 've got a bit more to add to this<S1B-002$A> <#> Mm <,> Yeah<S1B-002$B> <#> Then the chapters should be about five thousand each<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$B> <#> Uhm and everything then in terms of structure and so on it 's all working<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah well hopefully <#> Well you can read through that and see what you think of the structure <#> I 've really just gone through uhm each book <{> <[> <,> and </[> then tried to link up a bit more as I 've gone through them <#> So I 've started with Bowen and then gone onto Keane <#> So I 've tried to make a few references in the Keane section to the Bowen books to try and link it up a wee bit <#> But if you think there 's anything wrong with the structure then you know <,> tell me<S1B-002$B> <#> <[> Uh-huh </[> </{><S1B-002$B> <#> Okay <#> And I mean you 've finalised <,> I mean you 're you 're <,> I mean apart from the Higgins which you 're still working on <,> you 've finalised the texts<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$B> <#> So it 's Bowen <,> Keane <,> Higgins <,> Banville<S1B-002$A> <#> No I wasn't going to <#> Because I 'm going <,> I 'm <.> to </.> to do <,> I 've done two uhm texts by Bowen and then two by Keane and then two by Higgins and then The Killachter Meadow as well<S1B-002$B> <#> Mhm <#> Right now<S1B-002$A> <#> So that 's six nearly seven <#> The short story was from <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Unless you think I should include more<S1B-002$B> <#> No I mean I I just uh <,> I just wasn't uh <.> wa </.> uh <,> because I haven't seen<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$B> <#> Anything by you so far you know <,> I haven't really got a sense of which uh texts you you 're really working on and which ones you 're going to <.> fo </.> focus on <#> Uhm <,> right <#> Well <&> laughs </&><S1B-002$A> <#> That 's basically it isn't it<S1B-002$B> <#> Well <,> I think pretty much <#> Uh <,> what I 'll do is <,> I mean I 'll I 'll uh get through this <#> I mean are you in and out through the week or are you<S1B-002$A> <#> Uhm well Tuesday 's my only day off so it 's really awkward now for getting up to Queen 's <#> Uhm <,> but I mean I can certainly call up and collect that or get my mum to collect it at some stage<S1B-002$B> <#> Right <#> Well I mean if it 's easier I can post it out to your home address<S1B-002$A> <#> Oh no <#> Leave it in and I can collect it cos I think I 'll probably be in round about <,> round Queen 's on Tuesday anyway<S1B-002$B> <#> Right well I 'll<S1B-002$A> <#> I mean if it 's not ready on Tuesday <,> I mean don't worry about it<S1B-002$B> <#> No I 'll leave it <,> I 'll leave it in for Tuesday<S1B-002$A> <#> Right okay <#> Uh hopefully I 'll have the Higgins up for sometime during the week <,> then get on to the gender chapter<S1B-002$B> <#> Right<S1B-002$A> <#> So I 'm going to work on that during the weekend<S1B-002$B> <#> Okay <#> Uhm let 's see <,> uh <,> I 'm just trying <,> I 'm thinking about that because I 'm going to be away<S1B-002$A> <#> Right<S1B-002$B> <#> From about mid-August through to sometime in early September<S1B-002$A> <#> Right<S1B-002$B> <#> And even if I 'm not away I 'm just going to take off because I haven't had a holiday yet and I deserve it <&> laughter </&> <#> So uh uhm that means that <,> let 's see <,> I have to go away <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> uh <,> I 'll be <.> ar </.> I 'll be around sort of the week of the fifteenth <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> <#> So I mean from now on a a Friday meeting would be difficult for you anyway<S1B-002$A> <#> Unless I can <,> I can come up after work but I don't know whether that would suit you or not<S1B-002$B> <#> Well <,> <.> w </.> I mean why not <,> why not make it Tuesday then if that 's your day off<S1B-002$A> <#> Right well it 's just uh whatever really suits you then<S1B-002$B> <#> Well actually the I mean the earlier <,> the earlier that things can be cleared up on the week of the fifteenth the better <#> So that that 's the sixteenth of August then that Tuesday<S1B-002$B> <#> Right okay<S1B-002$B> <#> Okay and uhm <,> right and what I 'll say ten thirty<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah that 's fine <,><S1B-002$B> <#> And that I mean that would be the <,> that would be the gender chapter<S1B-002$A> <#> Yes that 's right<S1B-002$B> <#> I mean is that <,> you reckon you 'd be able to get it done by then<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah I should <#> I should be able to get it done by the second <#> It might not be typed up but it will be written up in some form or another<S1B-002$B> <#> Okay <#> Now I mean it 's just that that uhm <,> you know as I was saying I 'll be away from <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-002$A> <#> <[> Yeah <,> no I would like you to see it before </[> </{> <,> before that time<S1B-002$B> <#> Uh-huh <#> No I mean I 'll be back in early September so I 'll be able to read things but I mean<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-002$B> <#> My main aim is to <.> ge </.> get people going so to speak and I 'll have a look at it<S1B-002$A> <#> Uhm in the introduction do you think I should have a background sort of to the Big House generally <#> Would that be a good idea<S1B-002$B> <#> Well I mean explain some more to me about what you mean by what <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-002$A> <#> Uhm sort of uhm <,> the history <#> Should I introduce the history though <,> or should I<S1B-002$B> <#> What <,> go right back to Edgeworth and<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah <#> And even just uhm the history of the political novel <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> social novel <#> Or should I just stick to the Big House as a genre<S1B-002$B> <#> Well I mean I think your <,> your concern with this is really in terms of the way in which the Big House operates as a true figure<S1B-002$A> <#> Mm<S1B-002$B> <#> And the kinds of issues about both social identity and gender <{> <[> identity </[> that it raises <#> So <,> uh there are ways in which a political history or a social history of the Big House feed into that<S1B-002$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-002$A> <#> Yes<S1B-002$B> <#> But I think they 're slightly removed <#> <{> <[> You know in other words I think </[><S1B-002$A> <#> <[> Yes <,> I wasn't sure whether I should <,> </[> </{> do you know that it would maybe be a bit too much of a tangent maybe <,> the political <,> or whether it would be appropriate<S1B-002$B> <#> You see I think <,> I mean I think in in talking about this before I mean one of the points <,> I can't <,> trying to remember now <,> actually I was trying to remember as I was walking in this morning <,> whether it was <,> whether it was you or somebody else I had been making the point to which is that that one of the things which happens with the Big House <,> very often <,> and Aroon in Good Behaviour is the perfect instance of this <,> uh is that <,> and uh I mean the the Langrishes are another good instance <,> that uhm what you have is property ending up in the possession of unmarried women<S1B-002$A> <#> Yeah <#> I was just thinking that<S1B-002$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and <.> tha </.> that point about uhm <,> how <,> that may not strictly speaking be historically accurate <#> <{1> <[1> I </[1> mean it 's not the case that the Ascendancy died out because you know no male heirs <{2> <[2> were produced </[2> <#> But what that does is actually in literary texts is to dramatise so to speak the end of the line <{3> <[3> <#> You know </[3> because the whole point of something like the Big House is to do with property transfer <,> you know and inheritance<S1B-002$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-002$A> <#> <[2> Yes yes </[2> </{2><S1B-002$A> <#> <[3> Right </[3> </{3><S1B-002$B> <#> And the and the facts of uhm you know the laws of inheritance certainly in the early part of the century <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> When when Big Houses end up with unmarried women<S1B-002$A> <#> Yes<S1B-002$B> <#> This is actually kind of metaphorically you know even literally <,> the end of the line<S1B-002$A> <#> Right<S1B-002$B> <#> Now <,> there 's a case in which <,> in order to <,> to in a sense dramatise that notion of a line of inheritance having come to a full stop <,> writers use women in that way and whether they mean to or not that necessarily provokes questions about gender identity<S1B-002$A> <#> Mhm <,> yes<S1B-002$B> <#> Does this mean that you know you can't be a proper Ascendancy figure if you 're a woman <#> <#> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> the first <,> most obvious <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> <#> Uhm now that <,> it seems to me doesn't necessarily have to do with political or legal history of the <{1> <[1> Big </[1> House <#> Though obviously it 's something that involves court <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Uhm <,> so if I I think there is a gap in other words between that kind of political legal <{2> <[2> history </[2> and the way in which it 's used in <{3> <[3> literary works </[3><S1B-002$A> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1B-002$A> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><S1B-002$A> <#> <[3> Right okay </[3> </{3></I>
