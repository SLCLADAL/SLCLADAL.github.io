<S1B-037 Midnight Court 2><I><S1B-037$A> <#> Anne <,> you know uh one of the analysts employed by Sky TV uh Francis Tusa he said <,> I think this morning <,> this is the eighth time I 've heard of this town falling in the south <&> laughter </&> <#> You know <,> it 's uh <,> are we getting a lot of propaganda do you think<S1B-037$B> <#> I 'd say that a lot of the reports we get must carry some kind of a health warning <#> I mean we 're seeing the emergence of all kinds of language <,> decapitation <,> embedded is the big uh<S1B-037$A> <#> Horrible use of <{> <[> language </[><S1B-037$B> <#> <[> Uh </[> </{> <,> uh coming on <,> you know knowing that I was coming on this programme I did a little bit of background research on this whole embedding concept and we 've discovered that uh it was a public relations woman uh <,> she works for Donald Rumsfeld uhm <{> <[> uh </[> who coined this phrase embedded<S1B-037$A> <#> <[> Who coined it </[> </{><S1B-037$A> <#> Well can can you explain to viewers what <{> <[> what 's the </[> difference between an embedded journalist and a non-embedded journalist <#> You 're you 're a non-embedded journalist<S1B-037$B> <#> <[> Tory Clarke apparently is her name </[> </{><S1B-037$B> <#> I think the concept behind or the thinking behind the <.> be </.> the embedded journalists is that uh they <,> they work within the the sort of the army <,> the government structure <#> Apparently there are about two <,> over two thousand journalists working uh in Iraq at the moment and of the two thousand <,> five hundred are embedded <#> That means they 're embedded within the security forces <#> Uhm apparently they 've got to sign a documentation that <,> the sort of the ultimate veto of their copy <,> uh<S1B-037$A> <#> They give editorial <{> <[> control of their of their copy to a military officer </[><S1B-037$B> <#> <[> Control over to the army , over to the army </[> </{> <#> That 's correct<S1B-037$A> <#> That 's disgraceful isn't it<S1B-037$B> <#> So that for me an embedded journalist is a compromised journalist <#> Now I have to be careful and <.> s </.> and say at the same time <,> that you can't say that every journalist that is working uh you know within that military <,> with the confines of the military structure <,> you know <,> are compromised because I know there are people that are trying to get stuff out but I do think that <{> <[> it 's something </[><S1B-037$A> <#> <[> Do you think it 's worse </[> </{> this time than has previously been the case say in Afghanistan or in Gulf War One or <,> you know <,> is the degree of control greater this time<S1B-037$B> <#> I think it perhaps is <#> Apparently the whole of the background to the whole embedded thing was that they were not going to allow the kind of things that happened in Gulf War One happen in Gulf War Two and that apparently<S1B-037$A> <#> Sorry can you <,> can you <,> can you explain that <,> what sort of things<S1B-037$B> <#> That I think that you had too <,> apparently Rumsfeld 's greatest fear is to have <,> or the Pentagon 's greatest fear is to have what they called free-wheeling independent journalists <#> These are the kind of journalists like ourselves or myself and a few other people that kind of wouldn't have a huge big machine behind them <,> but that would go <{1> <[1> out </[1> <#> Mind you it 's getting more difficult to do that now because insurance costs after Nine-Eleven <{2> <[2> are so enormous that you can't do that </[2> </{2> <#> But uh I mean an <.> ind </.> an independent journalist <,> like say for example this morning 's uh London Independent like somebody like Bob Fisk <,> will give you a completely different view and slant on the story <,> <{3> <[3> that you may get from Sky or some of the other </[3><S1B-037$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1B-037$A> <#> <[2> That 's right <,> you can't <,> you can't get insurance <#> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1B-037$A> <#> <[3> Yeah and <,> I think <,> you know </[3> </{3> a lot of people for example in Ireland can get international TV coverage from different channels <#> They 're getting a different picture aren't they uh from the one we 're seeing here in Ireland and in Britain <,> if you switch on say German television <,> or Khalid I think you can get some Arabic TV <#> <{> <[> Is that right </[><S1B-037$C> <X> <#> <[> Well there are </[> </{> some uh Arabic satellite TVs <#> The reality about the media damaging western opinion is very much controlled by uh the dictatorship regimes there and uh well in Iraq uh I don't think you <,> you could believe them <#> They have a very huge uh propaganda machine <#> Uh you will tell <,> they will tell you something and the the reality is something else </X><S1B-037$B> <#> But Khalid for example in America <,> I mean I went to the peace march by the way in in town yesterday and there was an American woman <,> I think she actually appeared <,> Mary van Lieshout on this programme <,> and she spoke about uh very passionately about uh the fact that American public opinion <,> that there 's a lot more people against this war in the United States <{> <[> than has been reflected </[><S1B-037$A> <#> <[> Yes <,> a hundred thousand marched </[> </{> in New York yesterday I believe<S1B-037$D> <#> That 's really true<S1B-037$D> <#> Yeah I 've been reading<S1B-037$A> <#> Mary<S1B-037$D> <#> I 've been reading stories that apparently people are being arrested in America for wearing T-shirts <,> some guy was picked up in a shopping mall for wearing a t-shirt with Give Peace a Chance<S1B-037$A> <#> Do you think we 're getting a true picture <#> You 've actually been to Afghanistan I think haven't you <,> Mary<S1B-037$D> <#> I have indeed yes yeah <#> But just to to follow up on Anne 's point there <,> I was in the States myself a couple of weeks ago and I think that was really apparent when when you look at what was being shown on Fox <,> on CNN <,> versus what I was hearing from people that I was talking with in the States <,> they were two very different things <#> Uhm and there was even a lot of concern about what was being heard on the on the public national radio <#> Uhm you know that it just was not representing the the feelings of the people <#> And American people <,> a lot of them are very frustrated by this<S1B-037$A> <#> Yeah but what of the actual coverage of the war itself <#> What do you think about that <#> I mean when you see pictures of missiles going into uh sites but you don't actually see the the <{1> <[1> incredible </[1> suffering and fear that maybe is being created <{2> <[2> underneath </[2><S1B-037$D> <#> <[1> Yeah I suppose </[1> </{1><S1B-037$D> <#> <[2> Yeah I </[2> </{2> I find that very difficult to watch personally myself to be honest <,> because <,> I think it 's just bringing an infotainment uh kind of angle to the situation <{ <[> and </[><S1B-037$A> <#> <[> Do you think it 's like a form of entertainment almost </[><S1B-037$D> <#> I I do because <,> and and I see how people react to that even sometimes against their better judgement without maybe stopping to think <,> about what they 're actually watching <#> And you know I I 've heard people on the radio too saying you know well I 'm a military strategist so I 'm commenting on that but I 'm <,> you know <,> ignoring almost the human impact <#> Now that I find very difficult to listen to or to watch <#> You know you see people <,> journalists reporting from the various aircraft carriers or wherever they may be<S1B-037$A> <#> But these are the embedded journalists<S1B-037$D> <#> These are the embedded journalists exactly <#> But you know <,> people don't always remember that when they 're watching<S1B-037$A> <#> Yeah they don't uh filter it <,> looking at it from that <{> <[> point of view </[> <#> Terry Leyden uhm you 've built up many contacts in the Arab world over the years <#> What do you feel about what you 're seeing <#> Do you feel that it it 's depersonalised and that it 's not telling us the full story of what 's been done to Iraq<S1B-037$D> <#> <[> Yeah and </[> </{><S1B-037$E> <#> Well the first victim of every war is the truth <#> And this is the situation <#> I 've been watching this on many television stations from Fox to CNN to Sky <#> Every station has a different aspect to the war <#> The war is uh war that should have been prevented <#> Well you know fourteen forty-one <,> the government were totally opposed to the war taking <.> pla </.> place in the first place and we 're not participating in the war <#> But in commenting on the war at this point in time it 's it 's very serious what 's happening at the moment <#> Basra seems to be have been taken on many occasions but seems to be secured as the port city <#> Uh<S1B-037$A> <#> Yeah I mean what what are we to make <#> One day we 're told Basra 's taken <,> or this town Um Qasr has been taken eight <{1> <[1> times </[1> <#> But apparently there 's still resistance going <{2> <[2> on </2> <#> This afternoon they 're saying uh you know they don't want to take Basra <,> because they don't want to put troops into the streets in case they 'd be attacked <#> What do you what do you believe<S1B-037$E> <#> <[1> Yeah well </[1> </{1><S1B-037$E> <#> <[2> I heard </[2> </{2><S1B-037$E> <#> I heard John Simpson this morning from the BBC and he expected it would be a far faster war <,> it would be more settled <,> there would be a better reception from the coalition troops than they 're getting directly from the south of Iraq at the moment<S1B-037$C> <X> <#> Well you have a lot of pockets and these pockets are the members of the Ba'ath parties <,> the Ba'ath party and you know special forces and they share with Saddam the <.> col </.> the collective guilt of killing the people of Iraq <#> I mean </X><S1B-037$A> <#> But do you think they will fight <#> <{> <[> The Ba'ath Party </[><S1B-037$C> <X> <#> <[> Well uh </[> </{> well well those who committed crimes against the Iraqi people <,> the security forces <,> uh those who are uh the special republican guard <,> I believe to a degree many of them they are going to fight for Saddam for a while until they feel it 's uh hopeless <#> Uh I pray that they are not going to obey the order from Saddam to use uh his uh weapons <#> That is uh very vital for the safety of the Iraqis </X><S1B-037$A> <#> <{> <[> Alright <#> Doctor Pasabi <,> yeah </[> </{><S1B-037$E> <#> <[> I think in fairness <,> in fairness </[> </{> I feel that we are getting a good return from giving <,> having <,> having Richard Downes and Mark Little <,> Charlie Bird there in the <{> <[> region </[> <#> Yes they 're not bedded down with any of the groups involved<S1B-037$A> <#> <[> For RTE <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in different parts of Iraq </[> </{><&> several speakers simultaneously - unclear </&><S1B-037$A> <#> Well it would be impossible to bed down Charlie Bird in any case<S1B-037$E> <#> Well I think that 's right but I <.> f </.> <,> in fairness <,> what 's <,> we 're getting I think very balanced views from the war and in fact there <,> there 's total confusion even on the ground out there at this point Eamonn <#> <{1> <[1> The </[1> difference of this war and the Second World War is that we 've now direct access to the battlefield whereas <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and other stations will have it a week later <#> It 'll be all processed <#> I was watching <,> I was watching direct <{2> <[2> I </[2> was watching direct combat this morning on the front line<S1B-037$A> <#> <[1> For sure </[1> </{1><S1B-037$A> <#> <[2> Three </[2> </{2><S1B-037$A> <#> Three journalists have been killed today as well <{> <[> so we <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-037$E> <#> <[> Yeah three <#> Terry Lloyd <,> Terry Lloyd has lost his life </[> </{> <#> Yeah Terry Lloyd has lost his life and other <,> his back-up teams are ordered <,> I watched this morning on one of the major stations the fighting on the ground <,> with the embedded journalists being shown live and it was like a re-enactment of the Second World War<S1B-037$A> <#> You <,> a member of your family is out there <{> <[> in the </[> serving with the allied forces<S1B-037$E> <#> <[> Yeah my my </[> </{><S1B-037$E> <#> Yeah my nephew Sean Leyden joined up after eleven-nine <,> like many young Americans <#> He 's only twenty-seven years of age <#> He 's out there at the moment on the battlefront and we 're all concerned about him <,> as other <,> two young men from from my village <,> Ernie and Brian Mulherne are senior members of the American troops who are now underway at the moment <#> I uh we 're all concerned <#> But we 're also concerned about the uh Iraqis who are dying <,> the children <,> we 're <,> this is a war that should have been prevented <#> And I mean I I say this<S1B-037$A> <#> You say that <,> that 's the second time you 've said that <,> but we 're the only country out of the European Union that hasn't really got a clear position on the war<S1B-037$E> <#> Oh we have a very clear position <#> I mean the resolution<S1B-037$A> <#> Well not as clear as France<S1B-037$E> <#> The resolution <,> no that 's not correct <#> The resolution was passed by the Government by one hundred and two votes in both houses of the Oireachtas to seventy-five which clearly stated that the Government <.> decis </.> will not participate in the coalition 's proposed military action against Iraq <#> It went through on a long resolution <#> <{> <[> I think people should read </[><S1B-037$A> <#> <[> Yeah but <,> come on <,> </[> </{> we 're we 're we 're neutral for the allied forces aren't we<S1B-037$E> <#> No no <#> People should realise that this resolution <,> should read the resolution passed by the Oireachtas <,> the Oireachtas <,> and the government have passed this resolution <#> It 's the view of the Irish people expressing democratically <,> in the Oireachtas <,> and by the government</I>
