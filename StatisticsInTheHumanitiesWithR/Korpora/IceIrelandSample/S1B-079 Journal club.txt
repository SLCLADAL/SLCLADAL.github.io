<S1B-079 Journal club><I><S1B-079$A> <#> I won't go into that <#> It 's all different seconds for each food <#> Posture control and mobility uhm had adequate head trunk and foot control but was unable to walk uhm at the very beginning <#> She was able to roll from supine to prone and to assume the crawling position <#> Uhm at at the very end of the twelve months she walked short distances with a walker <,> wearing her ankle foot uhm brace but her preferred method of ambulation remained crawling on all fours when indoors <#> She began climbing and descending stairs with physical assistance so basically they 're saying everything improved <#> <&> laughter <&> Uhm and it goes on to talk about uhm human social integration is based on verbal communication and strongly modulated by facial expressions and that people uhm <,> basically <,> some people don't know how to accept uhm children who basically <,> they 're saying about her posture was very bad <,> if she was slumped over <,> whereas her posture was much better at the end <#> People were approaching her more and because of her head positioning and because of her facial expressions were normal <#> Uhm <,> so <,> basically recommendations for management <,> uhm therapy with intra-oral appliance <,> the ISMAR <,> had a normalising effect on circum-oral and intra-oral musculature of a twelve year ten month old girl with cerebral palsy and moderate ingestive impairment <#> Gains were made in eating <,> uhm more varied food textures <,> as documented by greater efficiency of eating fluid and viscous foods and by improved skills in spoon-feeding <,> biting <,> chewing <,> straw-drinking <,> and clearing <#> These ingestive skills may form the basis for the marked weight gain during the treatment period <#> Improvement in postural functions <,> ambulations as well as upper extremity functions may be due to the improved nutritional state and-or better positional control <#> Carefully chosen clientele for oral appliance therapy has the potential for making good progress in developmental motor skills <#> So uhm <,> that 's all<S1B-079$B> <#> I wonder will she continue to improve or is it just <,> short-term effects<S1B-079$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-079$C> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> before and after pictures <unclear> several sylls </unclear><S1B-079$A> <#> There 's a picture of her<S1B-079$B> <#> I 'm just wondering would it be generalisable to the entire population <#> The kind of thing behind it in the abstract and on the internet is that therapists don't need to go during daily oromotor therapy because this thing does it itself at night and you just kind of set it for the different parts of the night to do whatever you 're working on <#> And then you don't have to go out and dig out a therapist every day for a year or whatever <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#><S1B-079$C?> <#> What client group<S1B-079$B> <#> Well they always say about it for <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[> but I just wonder would it be generalisable to<S1B-079$C> <#> <[> Cerebral palsy </[> </{><S1B-079$A> <#> I wonder how it feels in the mouth because if they can spit it out so easily <,> you know the way kids are<S1B-079$C> <#> They say it 's really common in European <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> I 'd never heard of it before<S1B-079$A> <#> Yeah <#> Neither had I<S1B-079$B> <#> I suppose the thing I 'd wonder about is the sensory side of things <#> Like what child is going to let you put <,> like especially a child with uhm cerebral palsy that probably has hypersensitivity and probably has bite reflexes and everything else <#> All that would have to be desensitised before you could get near their <,> like that 's one of the main problems of treating them in the first place is getting to their mouth <,> and then to put in an appliance like that <#> Do they remove some teeth for it as well I wonder<S1B-079$?> <#> <{> <[> No </[><S1B-079$?> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1B-079$C?> <#> I wonder <,> you know the way the orthodontic ones would have the strap round the head<S1B-079$B?> <#> The head brace <#> Yeah <,,> <#> Cos they have other little attachments that you can put on extra beads for voice stimulation and all this kind of stuff<S1B-079$A> <#> I suppose adults you 'd wonder if they had let 's say a comorbid <,> say <,> respiratory problem that they wouldn't want something in their mouth <#> Let 's say they had a depression where they wouldn't want this in for six months <,,><&> simultaneous indistinct </&><S1B-079$A> <#> So I think we should get some and try them <,,> on Eve <&> laughter and indistinct speech </&> <,,> <unclear> several words </unclear><S1B-079$C?> <#> Do you want mine<S1B-079$?> <#> Mhm<S1B-079$C> <#> Uh what I thought I would do is just feed back a little bit on the conference that I went to in Australia <,> which I haven't fed back much on <#> Uhm <,> I <,> you know <,> there 's one article <,> not an article just a study that I want to go through as well and then <,> uhm a video <,> client video <#> Uhm it was <,> ran over three days and there was a lot of people there from Australia and South Africa and England and America <,> Europe <,> uhm places like Poland and all sorts of places like that so it was very well attended <#> Uhm it tended to be quite academic in the main speakers <#> They were doing a lot of things that are great from a research point of view but I don't know how much they would be useful for a <.> real </.> realistic treatment setting such as this <#> Uhm and how they go into huge detail <,> uhm so many assessments you 'd need to do and then we 'd need to do all this kind of therapy and uhm <,> you know so that I mean it was very interesting but I don't know how much it would cross over onto uhm our work <#> But what was more interesting was that in the break times every day they had poster sessions and that was more realistic <,> little research projects going on in uhm in settings such as this <#> Uhm and some of them were very different <,> like uhm uh head injuries after a gunshot wounds in South Africa and things like that <,> uhm <,> computer club for people with aphasia <,> internet training for people with brain injury <,> uhm communication activities in hospital settings <#> Uhm and then from Austria to Australia <,> this was quite interesting <,> they did uh face-to-face distance teaching via the internet for people who were in Austria but they were Australian and they wanted to have their speech therapy with with an Australian therapist and it was all done over the internet <#> And they said that they had positive feedback<S1B-079$B?> <#> Is that like a webcam or is it like<S1B-079$C> <#> Yeah<S1B-079$E> <X> <#> The webcam <,> doesn't that slow down images and everything <#> You don't see the here and now </X><S1B-079$C> <#> No <#> It 's like a new method of speech training and like they 'd have very limited amount of time on the computer and then it would be all about going off and doing your own work and coming back and doing more <#> And it 's <,> I suppose the only benefit that I could see is that they didn't have to leave their own house <#> Like there was no kind of <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> Then there was another one <,> tackling public transport and that was really interesting about uhm I think it was an English one where they uh got all the bus drivers from their area and they educated them about aphasia and they they did kind of like a you know a test beforehand about the reactions that people with aphasia got when they got onto the bus and how difficult they found it <,> and then they had uhm the training sessions and the you know gave the handouts about what aphasia is very very simple handouts and then like uhm suggestions about how to make it easier for somebody with aphasia and what aphasia means and everything like that <#> And then the people <unclear> several sylls </unclear> go back to see how they got on and it was very positive <#> Uhm and then there was a group called aphasia group and this was by Deborah Jean Wilson <,> she was a huge big black woman you know with all the robes and everything and she was like <,> all people have a say in the comedy of aphasia <&> all laugh </&> <#> But you know <,> they were <,> I thought all of those things were really good <,> much more interesting than the actual talks themselves <#> So I 'm just going to talk about one of them which is uhm hospital staff perceptions versus speech therapy recommendations about the strategies we give about communication <#> So if we have a patient with aphasia <,> this is what they 've done with somebody with aphasia but if we have somebody you know with Alzheimer 's or any other kind of communication problem and the strategies that we write on the chart are put up beside the bed you know how much are they used really <#> Uhm <,> and you know they just <,> they went through all the strategies and then the nurses had to fill out a form about how useful they thought they were and how often they would use them and if they weren't using them why wouldn't they use them <#> And you 'll find that the staff nurses that have been working on the ward for the longest period of time would use it <,> whereas uhm inexperienced staff wouldn't be bothered using it <#> Uhm and a lot of the time they said it was because a lot of the time the strategies would be put on the chart but not actually explained to them or the strategies would be put up beside the bed but they didn't think it was related to them or they didn't actually have to do anything with them <#> Uhm and sometimes that our even our very simple kind of terminology we 'd use would be lost on them <#> They wouldn't know what you meant <#> Uhm <,> and they felt that they really needed before doing any strategies on the ward with nursing staff they needed to have training <,> uhm and you know getting as to what we meant by getting eye you know eye contact <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> and by when we say use gesture <,> what do we mean by using gesture and all that kind of thing <,> so I thought that was quite interesting especially as we do that a lot and we don't have any nurse training for uhm for the nurses you know to try and explain what we do <#> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> that if anyone wants to approve it <#> Uhm <,> as well then during the breaks they had all these uhm obviously all these people advertising their books and their equipment and everything and there was one thing I thought was quite interesting but I don't know whether it 's available here <,> which is called the National <.> Re </.> Relay Service uhm <,> it 's an Australian service and and what they do is <,> it 's for people who have speech impairment or a hearing impairment <,> uhm to allow them to use the phone like any normal person <#> Uhm and what they do is they ring through to this National Relay Service and then they 've to give the phone number of who they want to uh contact <,> and if they 're deaf <,> uh if the person they want to contact is deaf uhm they have a little like a computer type thing so they can <,> uhm they get the speech back <,> like typed so the person in the relay centre will type out your message <,> it goes to the deaf person 's computer <,> they type back and you get it back in the form of speech via the National Relay Service <#> Or if you have uhm a speech impediment they have uhm you know people with dysarthria and things like that the the people in the Relay Service will be specially trained to try and uhm you know interpret uhm speech impediments or else to kind of you know facilities like <,> before they start the conversation you know <,> <#> What does this mean <#> Uhm what what are you trying to say <#> And is there any long words that you might have difficulties <unclear> several sylls </unclear> or the other person might have difficulty understanding <#> Uhm then they would put the call through and the person uses their own voice but the National Relay Service person says you know this person has uhm a speech impediment <,> please don't hang up the phone <#> You know if you have difficulty understanding I 'll help to translate for you <#> So I thought it was brilliant <#> Uhm and there 's a video on it which illustrates what it 's all about which is a bit corny in times but it 's it 's interesting <#> Do you want to watch it</I>
