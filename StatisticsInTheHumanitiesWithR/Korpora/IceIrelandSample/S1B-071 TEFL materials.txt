<S1B-071 TEFL materials><I><S1B-071$A> <#> Uhm <,> what was I going to say to you<S1B-071$B> <#> Well we were just we 're not going to do anything now are we <#> <{> <[> We 'll plan what we 're

<,> uh </[> </{> Malcolm Jenna had uhm <,> <{1> <[1> Jenna </[1> has a list of stuff that <,> <{2> <[2> from the time of Maggie </[2><S1B-071$B> <#> <[1> Jenna has </[1> </{1><S1B-071$B> <#> <[2> Jenna is away this evening just </[2> </{2> <#> Oh right <#> A list of stuff what<S1B-071$A> <#> You know that things that <.> sh </.> have to be done in the resources room<S1B-071$B> <#> Right<S1B-071$A> <#> From uh from away back a few <{> <[> years ago </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Well we </[> </{> you and I can work something <{> <[> out can't we </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> We can work something out </[> </{> yeah <#> So <,> what did what did you want to do <#> You 're going to do<S1B-071$B> <#> I wanted to do materials development <#> And <,> uh Jenna suggested that I go through those files<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> And uh weed out the bad stuff <#> And <,> she never there was no suggestion of me actually <,> producing materials but I 'd like to produce materials <#> <{> <[> That 's what </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{> yes <,> <#> Right<S1B-071$B> <#> That 's what I 'd like to do <#> <{> <[> I don't want to do <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yeah cos you 're going to do the </[> </{> the the videos and things like that <,><S1B-071$B> <#> Yes <#> That 's what I mean<S1B-071$A> <#> Okay<S1B-071$B> <#> Materials development <#> Well I 've got a whole heap of stuff that I could add to this uh <,> those materials<S1B-071$A> <#> Oh have you<S1B-071$B> <#> Yeah<S1B-071$A> <#> Very good<S1B-071$B> <#> Well I have loads of stuff <#> You know <{> <[> all the internet videos </[> <,,> songs<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yeah <,> <#> Ah right yes </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah <,> that 'd be very good<S1B-071$B> <#> And they 'll probably want to emphasise EAP these days<S1B-071$A> <#> Mm <,> <#> So I think then that you <{> <[> if you go through the files </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> So if I get I could </[> </{> get on with that eh<S1B-071$A> <#> Okay so <#> So we 'll make a note of that then Malcolm<S1B-071$B> <#> Is that alright <#> <{1> <[1> <,> I 'm </[1> sure what they want I 'm sure they don't really want materials development <#> I 'm sure they just want <,> materials tidying but <{2> <[2> I </[2> I don't want to do that<S1B-071$A> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1B-071$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><S1B-071$A> <#> No<S1B-071$B> <#> So <,> tidy up and add new materials <&> writes </&><S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> No<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> Right <#> What about you Martine<S1B-071$A> <#> So I think I 'd better start first of all with an inventory <,> <{> <[> right </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{> <,> <#> Of books<S1B-071$A> <#> Of all the books<S1B-071$B> <#> All the books <,> including those ones<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes <,> <#> And then I 'd better take out those trolleys<S1B-071$B> <#> Yes<S1B-071$A> <#> And go through all of that again <,> cos that 's<S1B-071$B> <#> Go through material and <&> writes </&><S1B-071$A> <#> In a heap<S1B-071$B> <#> Yes<S1B-071$A> <#> And then <,> uhm<S1B-071$B> <#> Tidy <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear><S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah <#> Sort out course books Malcolm <#> Or maybe Jenna can do that<S1B-071$B> <#> What do you mean by sorting them out<S1B-071$A> <#> See what we have <.> li </.> well that would be part of the inventory<S1B-071$B> <#> Yes<S1B-071$A> <#> To see what we have <{> <[> left of the books up there </[> <#> Yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Ah right <,> all the books yes </[> </{><S1B-071$B> <#> Yeah okay <#> <{1> <[1> What </[1> about <,> nobody 's doing cover so there 's no point in <,> <{2> <[2> the </[2> idea was to direct people towards <,> stuff that they could do while they were on cover <#> But there 's nobody doing cover so there 's no point in that<S1B-071$A> <#> <[1> Uhm </[1> </{1><S1B-071$A> <#> <[2> No </[2> </{2><S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> Do you know what I mean <#> <{1> <[1> The </[1> idea was that we would leave <.> in </.> <.> in </.> <,> information for them <#> Those library books could be <,> <{2> <[2> separated </[2><S1B-071$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-071$A> <#> <[2> The library books could </[2> </{2> be separated yeah <#> I had a <.> no </.> I had an idea the other night about those library books but it 's gone out of my head now<S1B-071$B> <#> Inventory as well Martine<S1B-071$A> <#> And do the inventory yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> That 's a long big process<S1B-071$A> <#> It is a process<S1B-071$B> <#> What else<S1B-071$A> <#> Uhm<S1B-071$B> <#> Games<S1B-071$A> <#> All those <{> <[> game things </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[> </{> games <#> Cassettes are the big thing <#> <{> <[> I 'm not going to do them </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> I know </[> </{> <#> Well I think maybe Jenna could do the cassettes <&> phone rings </&><S1B-071$B> <#> Hello <,,> <#> No no I think Bronagh 's teaching at the moment Sarah <#> Alright <&> puts phone down </&><S1B-071$A> <#> And then all the catalogues Malcolm<S1B-071$B> <#> Library books separated <{1> <[1> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[1> <#> Cassettes you think maybe Jenna might <{2> <[2> be able to </[2><S1B-071$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-071$A> <#> <[2> Maybe </[2> </{2> Jenna 'll do the cassettes<S1B-071$B> <#> Maybe Jenna <#> We 'll put it to her<S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> And <,> those files<S1B-071$A> <#> <.> Th </.> those files for uhm <,> <{> <[> you know </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Class </[> </{> for me maybe<S1B-071$A> <#> For <.> c </.> yeah maybe <#> And then I could look after the the general uhm tidying up of the of the resources room<S1B-071$B> <#> So <,> if I was to if I were to write that down <,> type it out and give it to Tony as a possible <{> <[> <.> dr </.> </[> as a <,> a <#> He he said he wanted he wanted to know hours<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> Right<S1B-071$B> <#> So how many hours would that involve do you think for each of us <,> <#> <{> <[> How many hours <#> Like a week we could do hours </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Well like at the at the beginning </[> </{> it <,> at the beginning it might <{> <[> be <#> Uhm </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Sorry Martine </[> </{> <#> That 'd be a lengthy process that inventory<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> The tidying up maybe <,> I don't know <#> What is length <#> What do you think per week<S1B-071$A> <#> What do you think<S1B-071$B> <#> I don't know <#> I I think we can't give him a we can't really see but we could give him a <,> a minimum number of hours that we would be prepared to do in a week<S1B-071$A> <#> Right<S1B-071$B> <#> What do you think <#> Three hours a week<S1B-071$A> <#> I 'll do four<S1B-071$B> <#> Four<S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah <#> That 's a minimum <,> <{1> <[1> for the </[1> moment <,> <{2> <[2> until we <,> if we 've to get maybe </[2><S1B-071$B> <#> <[1> Four hours </[1> </{1><S1B-071$B> <#> <[2> Uh <,> I know </[2> </{2> I spend hours doing materials Martine <#> <{> <[> I spend hours in </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Well so do I Malcolm <#> I spend </[> </{> hours doing you <{> <[> know </[> at being in here tidying up and doing all sorts of things<S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> We can't speak for Jenna <{> <[> whatever </[> you know she wants to do <#> Maybe I I I could do four hours<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah <,> <#> You know <,> two <{> <[> hours one </[> afternoon <#> Yeah easily<S1B-071$B> <#> <[> I could do </[> </{><S1B-071$B> <#> I do hours and hours before I go to start work<S1B-071$A> <#> That 's right<S1B-071$B> <#> Anyway <,> <{1> <[1> that 's my own that 's </[1> my own choice <,> <{2> <[2> Uhm </[2> <,> that 'll be it <#> That 's all <{3> <[3> that <,> like I mean </[3><S1B-071$A> <#> <[1> In the mornings there when you come in </[1> </{1><S1B-071$A> <#> <[2> Uhm </[2> </{2><S1B-071$A> <#> <[3> Yeah <,> I could be </[3> </{3> responsible <{1> <[1> for for </[1> the for the stationery renewing all the stationery and <{2> <[2> stuff like that </[2><S1B-071$B> <#> <[1> Games </[1> </{1><S1B-071$B> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2> <,> stationery <&> writes </&><S1B-071$A> <#> What about these things here <,> Malcolm<S1B-071$B> <#> Huh<S1B-071$A> <#> What about all of this here<S1B-071$B> <#> Well they 're they were all <.> s </.> they were all uhm <,> they somebody started on those and it 's all very good <#> But I mean is it finished <#> I don't know<S1B-071$A> <#> But I think <{> <[> they could be </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> And they 're not </[> </{> used <#> <{> <[> I mean there should be <,> </[> an induction<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> They 're not used <#> That 's what was in my </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> Even for teachers who 've been here for years<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> Contracts and things <#> Uhm <,> an induction you <.> c </.> for the future <,> <{> <[> an </[> induction for teachers <,><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> I remember I tried <{> <[> we tried it before <#> Remember we </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> And then </[> </{> what we have to do then is Malcolm maybe get <,> put up lists<S1B-071$B> <#> Lists of what<S1B-071$A> <#> Of <,> what we have in the resources room exactly<S1B-071$B> <#> There used to be a list<S1B-071$A> <#> There used to be a list <{> <[> but it 's gone </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> So </[> </{> make list available<S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> List <&> writes </&> <#> Okay but maybe a list <,> maybe a <,> mm <,> for who<S1B-071$A> <#> For the resources room<S1B-071$B> <#> Well it should be in the <,> library list<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes <#> And then uhm <,> make a list out every week of books that are missing off the shelves<S1B-071$B> <#> So <,> yeah<S1B-071$A> <#> You know<S1B-071$B> <#> I mean<S1B-071$A> <#> I mean I 'm I 'm terribly guilty as well <#> I take books <{> <[> upstairs and </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> So do we </[> </{> can see <#> Me too<S1B-071$A> <#> Mhm<S1B-071$B> <#> Uhm <,> okay <#> But I mean some books aren't really used except <,,> you know on the odd occasions whereas <,> others are in demand<S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> You could uhm <,> one of us could be the teacher to whom other teachers go if they need <,> to know if they need a missing book and then the teacher could put out a<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes that 's what I mean by that <#> That thinking<S1B-071$B> <#> But I mean if a teacher needs a book and it 's missing they could <{> <[> go to </[> one teacher and then the teacher could be responsible for <,> enquiring who has it <,> you know<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Oh right </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> Something like that<S1B-071$A> <#> Yeah <#> Would you like to do that<S1B-071$B> <#> No <,> not really Martine <#> I don't <{> <[> want anything </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Say that </[> </{> again <#> If <{> <[> if I </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> So if I </[> </{> say I was looking for a book<S1B-071$A> <#> Say you have that <{> <[> book there </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> So I could </[> </{> yes I have that book and you 're looking for it <#> <{1> <[1> You </[1> could do a wee ask a wee ask around a wee <{2> <[2> informal </[2> ask around but uh if it 's missing then <,> uhm<S1B-071$A> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1B-071$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><S1B-071$A> <#> Has to be replaced<S1B-071$B> <#> Reported anyway missing<S1B-071$A> <#> Reported yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> I don't know <#> Ach no I don't know<S1B-071$A> <#> What did Tony say there about what does he want Headway<S1B-071$B> <#> Pre-Intermediate <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> <{> <[> John knows John </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> So John had </[> </{> John wrote it down did he <#> Okay he 's to order it <#> <{1> <[1> So the big thing then the big thing </[1> then is the uh what do you call it <#> The big <{2> <[2> thing is </[2><S1B-071$B> <#> <[1> That 's just fine with me </[1> </{1><S1B-071$B> <#> <[2> Nobody uses </[2> </{2> these files you see Martine<S1B-071$A> <#> That 's what I that 's that was my my uh<S1B-071$B> <#> I think these <.> EA </.> these ESERP materials we could get rid of<S1B-071$A> <#> The ESERP stuff yeah <,> <{> <[> yeah </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> They 're not </[> </{> they 're not here anymore are they<S1B-071$A> <#> No I think they

Yeah<S1B-071$B> <#> This here I 'll leave cos that 's nothing to do with me <,> that <,> rubbish <{> <[> there </[> <#> Uh but uh<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> So what about all this EAP stuff that we 're supposed to get together<S1B-071$B> <#> I don't know anything about that <#> Us<S1B-071$A> <#> Well if we 're going to be in the resources room<S1B-071$B> <#> Materials<S1B-071$A> <#> Yes<S1B-071$B> <#> What does that involve Martine <#> Does that involve photocopying the book <#> <{> <[> Sure that 's a waste of time <#> That 's </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yes and </[> </{> it 's a waste of time <#> Of course it 's a waste of time <#> That 's what that 's all about there<S1B-071$B> <#> I could make EAP materials <#> Develop EAP materials based <{> <[> on </[> newspapers and <,> radio programmes and the internet<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> That would be good<S1B-071$B> <#> Real <,> <{> <[> stuff </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{> real stuff<S1B-071$B> <#> I could I <{> <[> mean I </[><S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yeah <#> That would </[> </{> be good Malcolm <#> That 's a good <{> <[> idea </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Including </[> </{> <.> EA </.> well I don't know <#> It I mean <,> you know <,> <{1> <[1> that would make </[1> more sense <#> <{2> <[2> That </[2> <,> wouldn't it<S1B-071$A> <#> <[1> Yeah yes </[1> </{1><S1B-071$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><S1B-071$A> <#> Yip <#> Actually that would be very good for you to do that from the point of <{> <[> view of your <,> CV thing <,> go ahead </[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> Mhm mhm </[> </{> <,> but I mean uh <{> <[> anyway </[> that would be <,> and some of these files are never used<S1B-071$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><S1B-071$A> <#> Never used <#> They 're there

</[><S1B-071$B> <#> <[> They 're great </[> </{> <#> I mean <,> but they 're never used which<S1B-071$A> <#> But what I find Malcolm is that the the teachers just go in and they do their own thing
