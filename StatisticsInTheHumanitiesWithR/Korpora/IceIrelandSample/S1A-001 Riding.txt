<S1A-001 Riding><I><S1A-001$A> <#> Well how did the riding go tonight<S1A-001$B> <#> It was good so it was <#> Just I I couldn't believe that she was going to let me jump <,> that was only the fourth time you know <#> It was great <&> laughter </&><S1A-001$A> <#> What did you call your horse<S1A-001$B> <#> I can't remember <#> Oh Mary 's Town <,> oh<S1A-001$A> <#> And how did Mabel do<S1A-001$B> <#> Did you not see her whenever she was going over the jumps <#> There was one time her horse refused and it refused three times <#> And then <,> she got it round and she just lined it up straight and she just kicked it and she hit it with the whip <,> and over it went the last time you know <#> And Stephanie told her she was very determined and very well-ridden <&> laughter </&> because it had refused the other times you know <#> But Stephanie wouldn't let her give up on it <#> She made her keep coming back and keep coming back <,> until <,> it jumped it you know <#> It was good<S1A-001$A> <#> Yeah I 'm not so sure her jumping 's improving that much <#> She uh <,> seemed to be holding the reins very tight<S1A-001$B> <#> Yeah she was <#> That 's what Stephanie said <#> <{> <[> She </[> needed to <,> give the horse its head<S1A-001$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-001$A> <#> She wasn't really getting into the jumping position the way she used to<S1A-001$B> <#> Mhm <#> You see we haven't done any jumping for quite a few weeks now <{> <[> you </[> know any proper jumping really <#> And so she probably has lost the <,> momentum for it or if that 's the right word<S1A-001$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1A-001$A> <#> Mm<S1A-001$B> <#> Did she <.> wa </.> she was keen to go in the <,> the jumping lane <#> But it 's been going for three four weeks now and there 's only one more week of it left and that 's next Monday <#> So I said to or Stephanie said there was a new one starting at the end of September <#> So I said she 'd be far better waiting <,> for that one <,> you know and starting anew fresh<S1A-001$A> <#> Yeah but I mean what is the jumping like<S1A-001$B> <#> It 's just with uh they do jumps and <,> whoever 's the best goes top of the league <,> <{> <[> you know </[><S1A-001$A> <#> <[> So </[> </{> it 's like another lesson but they they do jumping during it<S1A-001$B> <#> Well that 's the impression I got <#> I 'm not sure now <#> We didn't discuss it you know<S1A-001$A> <#> Well it sounds like more money<S1A-001$B> <#> Uh six pounds <&> laughter </&><S1A-001$A> <#> Do you not think we 're paying enough<S1A-001$B> <#> I do <&> laughter </&> <#> But Stephanie says that 's for the club <,> the pony club <,> although outsiders can jump in it but that there 's a riding school pony league starting at the end of September <,> for anybody<S1A-001$A> <#> Right<S1A-001$B> <#> And so I think she 'll be just far better waiting and sorting that out<S1A-001$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-001$B> <#> Mabel said like she would go on Monday and do without her lesson on Tuesday <,> you know <#> But I was keeping her going cos I says oh I wouldn't do without mine you see <&> laughter </&><S1A-001$A> <#> Well is she ready for school tomorrow<S1A-001$B> <#> I think so <#> She 's her bag packed and <,> washed out and <,> her pencil case filled and so on<S1A-001$A> <#> Is she taking the school bag that uh she had at primary school<S1A-001$B> <#> Yeah she is<S1A-001$A> <#> Yeah <#> Will it look okay with her new uniform<S1A-001$B> <#> Well it 's the same colour anyway <&> laughter </&><S1A-001$A> <#> Well that 's good<S1A-001$B> <#> Well she seems happy enough <#> I said she didn't have to take it tomorrow <,> that she could take her you know the wee shoulder bag she has<S1A-001$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-001$B> <#> And I said she could just take it tomorrow but she seems to want to take the schoolbag<S1A-001$A> <#> Aye she 's probably <{> <[> better </[><S1A-001$B> <#> <[> So </[> </{> although you see I don't think she 's getting any books or anything tomorrow <#> I think tomorrow 's just to get her locker <,> and <,> sort of show them around <,> uhm you know their timetable and <,> give them their timetable and show them where the classrooms are <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><S1A-001$A> <#> <[> What about this uh </[> </{> this bus pass<S1A-001$B> <#> Well<S1A-001$A> <#> Should she get that tomorrow<S1A-001$B> <#> She may get it tomorrow she may get it on Thursday <#> They said when I rang up the Education Board that she would get it on her first day at school <#> So I don't know if that would count as tomorrow <,> <{> <[> or Thursday </[> <#> But again they may organise that tomorrow you know<S1A-001$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-001$A> <#> She 's got a a zip on the inside pocket of <,> her blazer <#> <{> <[> I </[> said that <,> she should have a few pound in there just in case she might get stuck<S1A-001$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1A-001$B> <#> Well <,> I said to her that she did tell me that <,> but I said that uhm <,> she 'll probably be leaving her blazer in the cloakroom <#> She 'll not be wearing it all the time <#> And I wouldn't like it to be left down somewhere <,> with money in it<S1A-001$A> <#> Well now I think I think she should have <,> money that she can make a phonecall <,> and money <,> in case she loses her bus pass and she has to <,> pay for the bus home<S1A-001$B> <#> Mhm <#> Well she should have I mean she 'll probably be taking a couple of pound to school everyday anyway <,> not to spend as such but you know for that reason <,> to have a couple of pound in her pocket just<S1A-001$A> <#> Well maybe somewhere in her <{> <[> pencil case or something </[><S1A-001$B> <#> <[> Well she 's well </[> </{> she 's got a zip in her pocket of her skirt<S1A-001$A> <#> Well that would do<S1A-001$B> <#> Yeah so that closes with a zip<S1A-001$A> <#> She may be taking other things in and out of that all the time<S1A-001$B> <#> Well I don't know <#> I mean she 'll have her locker key in it too probably<S1A-001$A> <#> Mm <#> What about uh Chloe and Penny <#> They ready<S1A-001$B> <#> I think they 're ready too <#> Chloe <,> didn't she show you her uniform already <#> <{> <[> Didn't she try it on </[><S1A-001$A> <#> <[> She did yeah </[> </{> <#> Mhm she looked good<S1A-001$B> <#> She 's very pleased with it so she is <,> very pleased <#> So she has her schoolbag packed with her pencil case and that and her <,> bits and pieces that she 'll never have out for the first six months you know <&> laughter </&> <#> But uhm <,> she wants to take you know the wee sort of flat schoolbag that she has<S1A-001$A> <#> Mhm<S1A-001$B> <#> She wants to take that one <#> But it falls off her shoulders awfully easy and I 'd rather she 'd take the other wee <,> rucksacky-type one <,> because it stays up much better <#> But she 's insisting on taking the other one<S1A-001$A> <#> I remember years ago when we had the wee red Escort <,> we were up at that uh garage at Black 's Road <,> getting a new tyre<S1A-001$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-001$A> <#> And this uh <,> some friend of your dad 's <,> was working there<S1A-001$B> <#> I can't remember his name now <#> I don't<S1A-001$A> <#> Andy or Johnny somebody<S1A-001$B> <#> Ah<S1A-001$A> <#> Was it Andy<S1A-001$B> <#> Wasn't Andy no<S1A-001$A> <#> Anyway he was telling us that uh<S1A-001$B> <#> Was it not Basil <#> No<S1A-001$A> <#> No it wasn't Basil <#> He was telling us that that morning he 'd just uh <,> sent his youngest child out to primary school <&> laughter </&> with a wee tear in his eye <&> laughter </&> <#> And uh we 're doing it now<S1A-001$B> <#> Ah <,> will you have a wee tear in your eye<S1A-001$A> <#> Well I won't be seeing her going so <&> laughter </&><S1A-001$B> <#> Mm it seems strange <#> I have to take Julie down at her usual time and Chloe starts at ten past nine <,> so I 'll just you know there 's no point in me doing anything else going anywhere else <#> So I 'll just take her down then <#> But uh I don't know how long <,> I 'll be expected to stay <,> cos I 'll have Monica with me as well<S1A-001$A> <#> Somehow I don't think it 's going to be a problem for Chloe<S1A-001$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> No <#> She 's looking forward to it I think<S1A-001$A> <#> Yeah <#> I don't think it 'll be like my first day at school<S1A-001$B> <#> I don't remember mine<S1A-001$A> <#> Oh I remember mine <#> I think I screamed and kicked the whole day<S1A-001$B> <#> That wouldn't surprise me now <&> laughter </&> <#> I don't remember anything about my first day <#> I I don't remember my first <,> primary one really at all<S1A-001$A> <#> Oh I remember sitting beside <,> a fella called Bernard Bowman <,> and he was the only friend in the world I had <&> laughter </&> for a few weeks<S1A-001$B> <#> I don't remember <#> I remember <,> half-way through P-one <,> we changed from the old Lambeg school <,> to the Harmonstown Hill Primary school <#> And I remember changing over <#> And I remember before that I remember <,> walking home from school a couple of times <,> my mum pushing the big pram <#> So it must 've been Angeline still in the big pram <#> She must 've been about three <#> But they did that then didn't they <#> They kept you in a big pram for a long time<S1A-001$A> <#> They did <&> laughter </&><S1A-001$B> <#> Aye that 's what me mum always says about Angeline and all<S1A-001$A> <#> Yeah<S1A-001$B> <#> Cos the prams were so big that you could stay in them for ages <#> You just didn't have a buggy you see <#> <{> <[> And so </[><S1A-001$A> <#> <[> Well I </[> </{> I sort of way remember <,> before I started school we used to go down <,> from Finaghy on the train <,> to Belfast and walk on round to <,> my granny 's on the Donegall Road<S1A-001$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-001$A> <#> And I think <,> my mum took the big pram on the train<S1A-001$B> <#> Yes <#> She did <#> She told <{> <[> me </[><S1A-001$A> <#> <[> They </[> </{> slid the doors open <#> <{1> <[1> And </[1> uh so there 's was always a <,> like <{2> <[2> a mail </[2> <,> a mail uh carriage<S1A-001$B> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><S1A-001$B> <#> <[2> A guard </[2> </{2><S1A-001$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-001$A> <#> And there was these big sacks in it <,> but you could there 's room to wheel the pram on as well<S1A-001$B> <#> Yeah<S1A-001$A> <#> You know <#> <{> <[> But some of those trains </[> <,> some of those trains were steam trains you know<S1A-001$B> <#> <[> Would somebody 've helped youse </[> </{><S1A-001$B> <#> Were they<S1A-001$A> <#> Aye<S1A-001$B> <#> Oh <#> I didn't think you were that old a puppy<S1A-001$A> <#> No no there <&> laughter </&> there were steam trains yeah big puffers <&> laughter </&> <#> And uh <,> I remember the uh <,> there was a stationmaster at each station<S1A-001$B> <#> Yes<S1A-001$A> <#> And there was always it wasn't just a shelter <#> It was a <{> <[> complete </[><S1A-001$B> <#> <[> They sold </[> </{> tickets and everything<S1A-001$A> <#> Oh yeah they sold tickets but there was a <,> a fireplace and all <{> <[> in the </[> shelter <#> And you used to come in and it was completely closed in <#> You opened the door and closed it behind you<S1A-001$B> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><S1A-001$B> <#> Uh-huh<S1A-001$A> <#> And there was seats right round with the fire place in the middle <#> And then at the end of it <,> there was a like a little office <,> and that 's where the uh stationmaster stayed<S1A-001$B> <#> Mhm<S1A-001$A> <#> And he gave the tickets out from there and came out and <,> put more coal on the fire and <,> and the odd time he had a pot of tea going and you you 'd get people sharing and that so <#> You called the the guy at Finaghy Gerry <&> laughter </&> <#> In fact there was two <,> uhm two guys <#> One was this <,> Gerry was the smaller of the two and the more friendly <,> the other was a bigger guy <#> And uh <,> I sort of way remember him because a few times there were <,> us kids playing around the station and he used to chase you <,> you know<S1A-001$B> <#> Hm <,> and of course you never needed chased cos you were such a good child<S1A-001$A> <#> That 's right<S1A-001$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> Mm <,> mm I don't remember <,> my first experience of going on a train was whenever I was <,> starting Friends '<S1A-001$A> <#> Ah I was well used to it before I went to Friends '<S1A-001$B> <#> No I wasn't <#> I remember trying to cross the railway lines one day <,> and I tripped and fell and I looked up and the Dublin Express was heading straight for me <#> And I had to crawl across the railway lines to get out of the way of the Dublin Express <#> Tell you I never crossed the railway lines again<S1A-001$A> <#> Did the driver see you <#> Did he<S1A-001$B> <#> No he didn't stop at all <&> laughter </&><S1A-001$A> <#> Did he sound his horn<S1A-001$B> <#> I don't remember <#> <{> <[> I </[> don't <,> I don't know <#> I just remember looking up and seeing it coming <,> and crawling across the railway lines <#> And I couldn't go home <,> <.> we </.> <.> we </.> I 'd cut my legs and <,> my socks were covered in oil <#> And I couldn't go home <&> laughter </&> cos my mummy would 've killed me <&> laughter </&> never mind the train <#> I had to turn my socks inside out <,> and then of course all the oil went into my cuts <&> laughter </&> <#> And I had to go round school the whole day <,> with my socks turned inside out<S1A-001$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{></I>
