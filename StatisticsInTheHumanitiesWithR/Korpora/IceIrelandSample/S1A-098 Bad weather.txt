</{1><S1A-098$A> <#> <[2> That 's right yes </[2> </{2><S1A-098$A> <#> <[3> And will </[3> </{3> you be doing night duty now <{> <[> as well </[><S1A-098$B> <#> <[> Well </[> </{> I will be doing nights but I I don't know if I 'll be doing them for the first two weeks but <{1> <[1> like I want them <#> I </[1> need the money like <{2> <[2> so I mean for </[2><S1A-098$A> <#> <[1> You like

That 's right yeah <#> That 'd <{> <[> be brilliant </[><S1A-098$B> <#> <[> So I think </[> </{> we 're going into that myself and Seanie like <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1A-098$A> <#> Cos I I wouldn't mind going down <#> However the shop won't be closed I 'd say until about <{1> <[1> seven <,> </[1> <#> And that 's a bit too late really to go to Derry <#> <{2> <[2> Isn't it </[2><S1A-098$B> <#> <[1> I know </[1> </{1><S1A-098$B> <#> <[2> Well ah </[2> </{2> <,> maybe yeah <#> Well it depends <,> <{> <[> Angela </[><S1A-098$A> <#> <[> It 'd </[> </{> more than likely

<{1> <[1> Then I 'd probably end up </[1> working that Saturday and Sunday maybe or Saturday anyway <#> <{2> <[2> So </[2> <,> I might be off the the two days at the start of the week <#> If I am off anyway any of those couple of days I 'll come up and help you surely<S1A-098$A> <#> <[1> So it just doesn't make sense </[1> </{1><S1A-098$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><S1A-098$A> <#> Right well
