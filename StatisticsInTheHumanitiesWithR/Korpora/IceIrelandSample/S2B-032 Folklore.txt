<S2B-032 Folklore><I><S2B-032$A> <#> Hello and welcome to the continuing story of Irish expression <#> In our programmes up to now <,> we 've been concentrating on language <,> and on the linguistic history of Ireland <#> From now on however we 'll be widening the focus a little to include other areas of cultural expression <#> In this programme which we call the folk imagination we 'll be looking at Irish folklore and later on I 'll be talking to Da/ithi O/ hO/ga/in who 'll be discussing the particular role played by folk narrative or storytelling in Irish society <#> The word folklore conjures up many images to many people <,> romantic tales of times past <,> close encounters with the supernatural <,> improbable superstitions and old wives ' tales <#> But we might be hard pushed to provide an adequate definition of the word <#> What exactly is folklore <,> and what do academic folklorists study <#> We asked Se/amus O/ Catha/in of the Department of Irish Folklore in University College Dublin<&> musical interlude </&><S2B-032$B> <#> We 're in the Archive of the Department of Irish Folklore at University College Dublin <,> and here on its shelves you see arranged <,> the bound manuscripts containing the nuts and bolts of Irish folk tradition <#> You might well ask what do you mean by folklore and indeed we are often asked exactly that question <#> The answer we usually give is that <,> folklore is defined by everything that is contained <,> in the handbook of Irish folklore written by Sea/n O/ Su/illeabha/in and published in nineteen forty-two <#> It 's a bit long the definition because it runs to some six hundred and ninety-nine pages <#> It covers fourteen chapter headings with names like <,> settlement and dwelling <,> livelihood and household support <,> communication and trade <,> nature <,> folk medicine <,> mythological tradition <,> historical tradition <,> religious tradition <,> sports and pastimes and much else besides <#> Now the handbook actually describes in a kind of summarised form what is contained in the manuscripts <,> and I want to show you just a small selection of some of that material <#> Here for example <,> is a manuscript <,> from County Galway <#> <.> An </.> this manuscript is contains a description in the English language <,> of <,> various things to do with fishing and boats the parts of them and the names for them <,> <#> Another manuscript here <,> this one from County Cork and <,> in the Irish language <,> contains <,> uh the words of a song here just a little verse of a song in English on this occasion <,> in the middle of this Irish-language account <,> <#> This manuscript up here <,> is from the Barony of Erris in northwest County Mayo and <,> here you see <,> a picture of a spinning wheel <,> with all the various parts named numbered and named and the volume contains copious accounts of <,> the tradition of weaving in that part of Ireland and <,> taken down from the weavers who survived <,> up until the forties and fifties of this century <,> <#> This is another manuscript here dealing with yet another aspect of Irish folk tradition <#> This one in fact describes <,> uh from County Galway again describes uh uh various aspects of <,> the tradition relating to agriculture in Ireland and also it describes a great deal of the folk cures from that part of Ireland <#> And from folk cures we go to children 's games <#> This manuscript is <,> again from County Cork was taken down by a Cork child <,> in the nineteen seventies and here she describes the games <,> that she played and her <,> companions played at that time <,> and with <.> cop </.> gives copious illustrations <,> of <,> how the games were played and descriptions word pictures also of how it was done <#> This manuscript here <,> is in fact not a manuscript at all it 's really <,> a typescript <#> As you can see <,> it contains typewritten material <,> and it comes from <,> the northern part of Ireland <#> We 're looking at material in these pages from County Cavan <,> and also here from County Down <,,> and from County Armagh <#> So that the tradition that was recorded by <,> the kind of people who <,> wrote these manuscripts or typed them up <,> uh covers the whole island of Ireland north and south <#> Well that little sample may have given you some idea of what the scope and range of Irish folk tradition <,> uh was and indeed to some extent still is <#> These accounts and were taken down from people <,> all over Ireland as I said <#> They were taken down by a variety of individuals <,> full-time collectors <,> part-time collectors <,> questionnaire correspondents and so on and so forth <#> Now they would have sat around the hearth with the people <,> that they recorded their material from <,> and I often think of the hearth as being central to the whole to an understanding of what Irish folk tradition in its totality is about <,> because on the one side you have the materials of uh the material <,> tradition as it were <,> the material folk tradition <,> the pots and pans <,> the hearth furniture <,> the chimney <,> the fire <,> the fuels and so on and so forth <,> all of that <#> On the other hand <,> you have <,> the people sitting on their chairs around the hearth doing what people <,> did <,> talking to each other <,> describing times gone by <,> singing songs <,> and of course <,> perhaps uh what is one of the greatest glories of the Irish folk tradition uh uh participating in what we folklorists call folk narrative <,> storytelling in other words <,,><&> musical interlude </&><S2B-032$C> <#> For most of us nowadays <,> our contact with Irish folklore is through the bookshop <,,> through the finely illustrated books <,> that we find there <#> But in fact these stories were once told throughout the whole community <,> by the old people to the young people <,> by the young people to each other <,> by word of mouth <#> The most celebrated character of all was Fionn mac Cumhaill <,> a hero well suited to the Irish temperament <,> for we are told that not only was he a great warrior <,> but he was also a very imaginative <,> and a very clever man <,> <#> The main divisions of folk stories in Ireland <,> are native hero tales <,> adaptations of international folktales <,,> and legends of famous persons and things<S2B-032$X> <X> <#> <&Irish> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> A ra/ le aifreann a le/amh <#> Ta/im </&Irish> </X><&> simultaneous unclear </&><S2B-032$C> <#> As well as these <,> shorter forms of narrative have been much cultivated <,> such as jokes <,> verse anecdotes <,> and accounts of personal experiences<S2B-032$X> <X> <#> <&Irish> <unclear> 8 sylls </unclear> thall thoir <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </&Irish>

<,> are almost exclusively in the Irish language <,> whereas the other genres <,> thrive to an equal extent in English as in Irish<S2B-032$X> <X> <#> And <&Irish> bhuel bhi/ fear amha/in <unclear> 7 sylls </unclear> </&Irish> </X><S2B-032$C> <#> Due to the influence of commercial entertainment and the mass media <,> recent generations have evidenced a marked decline in all forms of oral storytelling <,> except for modern urban legends and a variety of short and rather spontaneous humorous accounts <#> Few of the mythical stories of old Irish literature <,> are found in the folklore of recent centuries <#> But there are some significant exceptions <#> Especially notable is the lore concerning the young hero Lugh who survives the schemes of his tyrant grandfather Balar of the Destructive Eye and slays that formidable opponent <#> This epical story can be proved to have evolved from ancient sources in the Middle East <,> where the Celts picked it up and applied it to their god Lugus <#> It can still be heard told in the north and west of Ireland <#> Other divine personages with vestiges surviving in folklore until recent times <,> are the smith god Goibhniu <,> who is popularly known as the Goba/n Saor <,> and land goddesses such The Hag of Beare <,> <&Irish> Cailleach Bhe/ara </&Irish> whom we are told lived longer than any other person <#> As well as fairy queens such as A/ine who reside in wonderful palaces inside some hill or other <,> <#> People everywhere love stories of great heroes <#> In Ireland our hero tales have been reinforced through the centuries by written texts <#> This is true of all versions of stories from the Ulster Cycle or <&Irish> Rudhraighi/ocht </&Irish> which have been current in folklore <#> Their sources were manuscript retellings which are read out at get-togethers in the evenings <#> Most popular of these stories are descriptions of the youthful deeds of Cu/ Chulainn <,> and of the tragic life of the heroine Deirdre <,> who is deprived of her true love and made to marry the vengeful king Conchubhar Mac Neasa instead <#> Folk accounts of Fionn mac Cumhaill are much more common <,> partly because of the simple and catchy form of his adventures <,> and also because of the large number of late literary texts which focus on him and his warriors <#> The account of his fugitive youth <,> and of how he gained prophetic wisdom <,> through tasting a salmon <,> was known to Irish speakers in every part of the country <#> Another widely-known story <,> tells of an adventure which he and some of his warriors had in a strange house where they encountered <,> time in the person of an old man <,> youth as a beautiful maiden <,> and energy in the form of an aggressive ram <#> Despite his great knowledge <,> Fionn was puzzled <,> until all was explained to him <#> This story closely resembles the literary allegories which scholars were so fond of in medieval Europe <#> That the ordinary people in Ireland appreciated its meaning and developed the characterisation in it <,> shows that the popular imagination <,> can be quite sophisticated <#> Of other epical heroes the most striking is Conall Gulban <,> an important figure of early history whose name and fame were borrowed into a fantastic romance written in or about the sixteenth century <#> This has Conall 's lady love being stolen away from him when he falls asleep on the hill of Howth <#> He sets out to sea to search for her and <,> after travelling much of the world <,> and fighting many battles <,> he returns home to Ireland in triumph <#> Though highly anachronistic it was avidly adopted from manuscript readings by oral tellers <,> and these storytellers streamlined the episodes <,> and re-arranged the plot as they themselves saw fit <#> Many stories have come in to Ireland from abroad <,> having been brought here by sailors <,> merchants <,> missionaries <,> and many other types of people who had business on the Continent and in Britain <#> Since these stories <,> had good plots <,> and since they were full of fantasy and imagination they soon caught on in Irish folklore and became very popular among the people <#> We know these stories as international folktales <#> One very popular genre <,> was the short animal tale <,> which attributes fanciful experiences and often human-like intelligence to the various creatures <#> Some of these tales were aetiological <,> such as how the wren became king of the birds <,> or how the plaice got its crooked mouth <,> but especially popular <,> were the imagined deeds of the clever fox<S2B-032$Z> <X> <#> <&Irish> Bhi/ ri/ in E/irinn fado/ in e/ fhe/in is a bhanri/on <#> Is mac amha/in a bhi/ acu <#> Bhuel ni/ raibh di/omhaointeas maith arsan mhic <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> </&Irish> </X><&> simultaneous unclear </&><S2B-032$C> <#> Wonder tales were in great demand all over the world and they were very popular with Irish storytellers and their audiences <#> These narratives were long and elaborate <,> telling of fantastic events in a world of long ago <,> where the ordinary confines of nature were superseded <#> They were told with great gusto <,> for instance <,> the dragonslayer who rescues a princess and upstages his dishonest rival <,> or the widow 's son who can only save a princess from a giant by finding out where the giant 's heart resides outside of his body </&> <#> Versions of international religious tales tell of adventures in search of salvation <,> of tussles with demons and of various other ways in which man acts out his moral dilemma in concrete terms <#> There are many artistic touches to these <,> such as a man who does penance in a river <,> and his tears of remorse are so bitter that they cut their way through the water and leave holes in the bed of the river beneath <#> Romantic tales <,> also of international origin <,> relate circumstances of coincidence and quick wit in real-life situations <,> while a wide range of humorous anecdotes were told about tricksters and rogues <,> about stupid characters who weren't always so stupid <,> and especially <,> about how Fortune could turn and smile upon the poor and oppressed <,> <#> An oral legend is a story to which a strong amount of belief is attached <#> Some stories of this kind <,> the migratory legends <,> were told in other parts of Europe as well as here <#> Examples are the legend of a river which claims a victim at periodic intervals <,> or that of a sleeping army of old <,> which waits at a hidden location for the appropriate time to return</I>
