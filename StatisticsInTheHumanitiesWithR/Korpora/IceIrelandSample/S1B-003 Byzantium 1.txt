<S1B-003 Byzantium 1><I><S1B-003$A> <#> Right because the thing is that there are two ways of trans-literary of getting out of the Greek into English <#> And one of them it comes out as <&> speaks Greek </&> and the other one is <&> speaks Greek </&> <#> And it actually means exactly the same thing <#> Okay <#> And what it actually means is brother-making or perhaps more exactly sibling <,> making <#> Right <#> Okay <#> And <,> one of the features of the two traditions that Sean actually identifies is the fact that <,,> <&> Greek </&> is mentioned in one tradition and not in the other <#> Or rather <,,> the <&> Greek </&> with<S1B-003$B> <#> Nicholas Nicholas I think <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-003$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <#> Nicholas <{> <[> yeah </[><S1B-003$B> <#> <[> Nicholas yeah </[> </{> <#> The fact that there was actually a mention of <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <,> went to the church and <,> <{> <[> the </[> whole rejoice in the union<S1B-003$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-003$A> <#> Yes <#> Does that indicate it that there was<S1B-003$A> <#> Okay cos who are some of the right what 's actually the story <#> Who are some of the who are the people that you hopefully have read about <#> Right so okay we 've got <,> Michael the Third <#> Who 's Michael the Third<S1B-003$C> <#> The <{> <[> Emperor </[><S1B-003$B> <#> <[> The </[> </{> Emperor<S1B-003$A> <#> The Emperor<S1B-003$B> <#> Can I ask you a quick question <&> laughter </&> before you go any further about Michael the Third <#> When I read uhm <,> the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> Tucker what it seemed to say that Michael the Third and Basil were of similar age<S1B-003$A> <#> Yes<S1B-003$B> <#> But when I <,> read the Boswell one <{1> <[1> it </[1> seemed to say that <,> Michael <,> was younger <,> <#> <{2> <[2> He was more </[2> youthful <{3> <[3> than Franzo </[3><S1B-003$A> <#> <[1> Mm hm </[1> </{1><S1B-003$A> <#> <[2> Not </[2> </{2><S1B-003$A> <#> <[3> Yes </[3> </{3> <#> He <,> right well I mean yes he is <,> slightly younger <,> <{1> <[1> but I mean </[1> but I mean <{2> <[2> it 's a it 's it 's less than </[2> <,> sorry it 's less than five years<S1B-003$B> <#> <[1> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1B-003$B> <#> <[2> Cos I thought maybe </[2> </{2><S1B-003$B> <#> Okay<S1B-003$A> <#> But the other big difference is that <,> Basil 's big and hunky <,> <{> <[> whereas </[> Michael the Third isn't <#> And so in actual fact he <,> Basil actually appears older <#> Okay<S1B-003$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><S1B-003$B> <#> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear><S1B-003$A> <#> No no no that 's okay <#> So right one of the people that we 've got is Michael the Third <,> okay who right one of the traditions in the Byzantine Empire is that they quite often give nicknames to their <,> emperors <#> So like you have Constantine the Seventh Porphyrogenitus <#> Uhm you also have Leo the Sixth The Wise <,> and you also have Michael the Third who 's known as The Sot <,> uhm cos apparently he was fond of a jar or two <#> Okay so well I mean the other thing is that he 's also meant to have been fond of lots of other things <{> <[> as well yeah </[><S1B-003$B> <#> <[> Other things </[> </{> yeah <&> laughter </&><S1B-003$A> <#> <&> coughs loudly </&> Hmm <#> Meanwhile back at the ranch <#> So okay we 've got <,> Basil the First <,> right well Basil <#> What do you know about Basil <#> What does the story say about Basil<S1B-003$C> <#> Said he came out with a stick and stuff<S1B-003$A> <#> Right <,> right one of the things was that he came with a with a stick and a little sort of knapsack or or you know like Dick Whittington with all his worldly goods tied up in a big hanky <#> Okay<S1B-003$B> <#> Sort of rags to riches<S1B-003$C> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><S1B-003$A> <#> <[> It 's </[> </{> very much a rags to riches story<S1B-003$B> <#> I think he slept his way to the top <&> laughter </&><S1B-003$?> <#> Yeah<S1B-003$C> <#> I think he did too <&> laughter </&><S1B-003$D> <#> He didn't do very well did he<S1B-003$A> <#> Who else do we who else is involved in the story <#> Right we 've we 've also heard of Nicholas <,> right <#> Who 's Nicholas<S1B-003$C> <#> Is that the son of the <,> he 's the one they found on the church steps <#> Was that <{> <[> the monk </[><S1B-003$D> <#> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1B-003$A> <#> Right Nicholas <{> <[> Nicholas </[> is the monk who may either be a doorkeeper or an abbot <,> depending on which story you you know which story you follow <#> But in the monastery <,> on the outskirts of Constantinople but within the walls who discovers uhm Basil sleeping on the in the in the porch <#> Okay <,> <#> Who else is there<S1B-003$B> <#> <[> Monk yeah </[> </{><S1B-003$E> <X> <#> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> something Basil as well but different </X><S1B-003$B> <#> Is that the new <{> <[> Basil </[><S1B-003$E> <X> <#> <[> Yeah is that the </[> </{> <#> Yes I think <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <,> </X><S1B-003$A> <#> That 's in Lycos<S1B-003$E> <X> <#> Uh it 's in my head <&> laughter </&> </X><S1B-003$D> <#> He 's the young model isn't he<S1B-003$A> <#> Sorry<S1B-003$D> <#> He 's the younger model<S1B-003$C> <#> <{> <[> Yeah <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-003$A> <#> <[> Younger model <#> Uhm </[> </{> but he 's he 's the one <,> that Basil is frightened is <,> Michael the Third is going to replace him<S1B-003$B> <#> That 's why he was <{> <[> like </[><S1B-003$D> <#> <[> The one </[> </{> he paraded around in uh <{1> <[1> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[1> <#> But there 's John <#> Wasn't there a John <#> <{2> <[2> And uhm </[2><S1B-003$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1B-003$A> <#> <[2> Yes there 's </[2> </{2> <{> <[> John </[> <#> And who 's John<S1B-003$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><S1B-003$D> <#> His mother <,> wanted to form <,> the spiritual <,> brotherhood <{> <[> between </[> Basil and her son John<S1B-003$A> <#> <[> Uh </[> </{><S1B-003$A> <#> Yes <#> Okay and the widow is called <{> <[> Danelis </[> <,> and Danelis is a rich <,> a rich widow <#> Uhm just the thing for a young man looking to get ahead <&> laughter </&> uhm who has a son John <#> And she <,> basically showers wealth and riches on <,> Basil the First well on Basil before he becomes Basil the First <,> <#> So those are the <,> those are the main characters <#> Uhm there are several other characters that probably ought to be mentioned<S1B-003$D> <#> <[> <.> Danel </.> </[> </{><S1B-003$D> <#> Those pretty women<S1B-003$C> <#> Women yeah <&> laughter </&><S1B-003$A> <#> Okay can we start with the women<S1B-003$B> <#> Okay there were two <,> weren't there two Eudokias <,> <#> <{1> <[1> I I </[1> didn't know if that 's right <{2> <[2> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2><S1B-003$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><S1B-003$A> <#> <[2> Either </[2> </{2> Eudokia or Eb-do-ki-a <#> <{1> <[1> It doesn't </[1> it doesn't <,> it doesn't <{2> <[2> matter that much </[2><S1B-003$B> <#> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1><S1B-003$B> <#> <[2> It was very </[2> </{2> complicated <#> One was the wife <,> of Michael<S1B-003$A> <#> One was the wife of Michael<S1B-003$B> <#> And one was the one that Michael actually preferred to <{> <[> his wife </[> <&> laughter </&><S1B-003$D> <#> <[> It 's the one </[> </{> that when she married the <{> <[> <.> m </.> the master </[><S1B-003$B> <#> <[> And he gave </[> </{> her to <,> Basil<S1B-003$A> <#> To Basil<S1B-003$D> <#> And then there was the other I can't remember the name of the other one now<S1B-003$B> <#> And then there was a child as well wasn't there <#> The Basil 's child eventually when he comes into the palace doesn't know whether <,> it 's his child or the result of of uhm Michael and<S1B-003$A> <#> <{> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[><S1B-003$?> <#> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><S1B-003$B> <#> Yeah aye<S1B-003$A> <#> Right yes because the what what actually happens when they get <,> when they sort of get set up in the palace is that <,> Michael the Third makes <,> Basil repudiate his wife Maria <,> and then <,> Michael makes Basil marry <,> Michael 's mistress <,> Ebdokia Ingerina<S1B-003$B> <#> Why<S1B-003$A> <#> Because then <,> Michael the Third can ignore <,> his own wife Ebdokia <,> Decapolitissa <,> and concentrate his attentions on his mistress who is now <,> Basil 's wife<S1B-003$B> <#> Were the mistresses open then <#> Or do you know like like France is it would be culturally different to be a mistress<S1B-003$A> <#> Right uhm<S1B-003$B> <#> Like would they have to be like <,> was Basil <,> used as a decoy for Michael to get near his<S1B-003$A> <#> Yes <#> It 's used as a decoy because whilst normally the people who would be <.> re </.> who would be <,> the mistresses would probably be known <#> At the same time it wasn't actually allowed <#> So <,> that means that you <,> can't be too open about it <#> Uhm <,> and so as Sean actually writes it 's not really a me/nage-a\-trois because there 's four people in it <#> So <,> uhm <,> and this is part of the problem is that because Basil 's the First 's wife Ebdokia was actually the mistress of Michael the Third <,> it 's unclear whether Leo the Sixth <,> who 's the successor to Basil the First was actually Basil the First 's son <,> or Michael the Third 's son <#> Okay <#> Yup<S1B-003$B> <#> See for a culture where you can <,> get artificial kinship and for the relations to be so strong <,> and yet you read about the untrust because he wasn't sure that it was son <,> I think that 's a bit contradictory <#> Do you know where you can look there 's all these rituals that can make a kin <,> yet there 's this <,> was it like even <,> did he want them dead at one stage or something <#> <{> <[> Like </[><S1B-003$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{> he did<S1B-003$B> <#> I mean that 's a bit extreme for somebody that you weren't could be your son <#> Do you know what I mean<S1B-003$A> <#> Well yes it could be yours <#> Right the thing is that that Leo the Sixth could be your son but the other thing is that your son <,> or the person who supposedly is your son has allegedly just tried to kill you <#> So like the story is that Leo the Sixth attempted to assassinate <{> <[> Basil the First <#> So </[><S1B-003$B> <#> <[> <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> </[> </{> <#> So it wasn't just to do with biology then <#> It was to do with personalities<S1B-003$A> <#> Yeah <#> It was to do with personalities and of course the struggle for power <{> <[> as </[> everything normally is <#> Uhm so it 's not just that he sort of took an extreme dislike <,> that Basil took an extreme dislike uh to Leo the Sixth <#> Uhm now <,> the extent to which he had he had good cause <,> is unclear as well <#> Right <#> And the other thing to remember is that Leo the Sixth is actually <,> Basil <,> the First 's second son because the first son that he actually hoped would succeed him died young <#> So there 's also part of a <,> a sort of <,> sort of mourning tied up in all that as well <#> Okay<S1B-003$D> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><S1B-003$D> <#> So when when Basil is trying to uhm <,> I mean he infers that Michael is homosexual <#> I mean wouldn't it be more accurate with all these you know women in the picture to kind of say he was bisexual <#> I mean if you know maybe there was no term for that at that time <#> Maybe it was just I mean <,> seen as quite acceptable that he could be with men or women and there wasn't that definition of it <#> But wouldn't it be more accurate if he<S1B-003$C> <#> Mm you 're right there <#> Like I mean if he was homosexual and he had a wife <,> why have a mistress on <{> <[> top of that </[><S1B-003$D> <#> <[> Exactly </[> </{> <#> You know <{1> <[1> if he maybe if he just </[1> had a wife I would say well I mean it 'd probably <{2> <[2> mean because </[2> he was supposed to have a wife in order to <{3> <[3> give him </[3> an heir or whatever <#> But if he also had a mistress I mean that would infer more that he <,> you know was attracted to this woman and obviously <,> so<S1B-003$C> <#> <[1> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><S1B-003$?> <#> <[2> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2><S1B-003$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><S1B-003$A> <#> Cos I mean the other thing is that that his mistress <,> he actually had his mistress before he got married <,> and then his mummy said no you have to get married and you can't marry her <#> And so <,> his mummy found him a new wife or you know a <{1> <[1> new woman </[1> to be his wife <#> But then he wouldn't give up the mistress and then that so <#> And I mean yes probably <,> the way that we think of <{2> <[2> things </[2> it 's it would be more accurate to describe him as as bisexual rather than <,> as homosexual <#> Uhm<S1B-003$D> <#> <[1> More acceptable </[1> </{1><S1B-003$D> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2><S1B-003$B> <#> You know or if it 's not even about sexuality <#> It 's about power or you know <,> something else rather than pleasure <,> that makes it even <&> phone rings </&><S1B-003$A> <#> Sorry <#> Hello <&> puts phone down </&> <#> Uhm <,> yes but then is <,,> sexuality not always about power<S1B-003$D> <#> <{> <[> Mm </[><S1B-003$B> <#> <[> Aye </[> </{><S1B-003$A> <#> Uhm <,> but part of the problem ends up being <,> you know this is where it becomes you virtually encounter most directly <,> the the fact of <,> the difference between our society where we divide people <,> you know with monotonous regularity into <,> you know straights and gays and undecideds or or <,> homosexuals heterosexuals and bisexuals <,> or bodysexuals and you know it gets worse <&> laughter </&> <#> Don't want to talk about it <#> Uhm <,> and <,> medieval society where <,> they actually looked at what <,> they didn't actually look at the people they actually concentrated on what the people did <#> And more often than not <,> admittedly it 's the Church that does the deciding <,> generally speaking and quite often they decide that everything that isn't <,> uhm <,> heterosexual intercourse within marriage <,> is wrong</I>
