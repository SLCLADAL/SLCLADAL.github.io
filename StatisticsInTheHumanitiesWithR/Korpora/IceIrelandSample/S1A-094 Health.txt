<{1> <[1> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[1> these recurring effects <{2> <[2> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[2> cos his system 's just fucked you <{3> <[3> know </[3> <#> On the minimum <#> And if he 's got he definitely needs dialysis quite <{4> <[4> soon </[4> you know you are going to pick up infection <{5> <[5> with toxins </[5> and in the blood <{6> <[6> <#> It 's </[6> going to be inevitable you know <{7> <[7> unfortunately </[7> <#> But uhm he 's got a <.> bo </.> bearing up well <#> Like I mean he was fine cos uh he was out last week doing the gardening and stuff <{8> <[8> and you know </[8> <,> going for walks <#> And he may be overdoing it a bit you <{9> <[9> know as well so uh </[9><S1A-094$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-094$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2>

cos the pollen is settling<S1A-094$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><S1A-094$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><S1A-094$A> <#> Oh definitely <{1> <[1> cos Gary </[1> got a blaster here so uh <#> So like come here then Lisa has been taken away by the baby <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <{2> <[2> and was </[2> screeching the place down like<S1A-094$B> <#> <[1> I think </[1> </{1><S1A-094$B> <#> <[2> Oh cool

lying on the sofa <#> It was like a weight <#> You know it 's not a <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> to carry <#> Mike 's been playing with her <#> Uh the she was progressing well there but I think she was like going berserk like <#> No it was her first day at creche today <{> <[> so </[><S1A-094$B> <#> <[> Oh </[> </{> really <,> <#> <{> <[> Oh my God </[><S1A-094$A> <#> <[> Yeah so </[> </{> it 's so weird like <#> Uhm so I had to kind of uh leave her in for a few hours <#> And I leave her in tomorrow for a couple of <{1> <[1> hours </[1> just to get her used to it <#> <{2> <[2> <,> And uhm </[2> <,> bring cos uh unfortunately just she 's been up in Belfast this week <#> She was supposed to have a whole week this week before she goes in next week but <{3> <[3> uh </[3> it didn't happen <#> So <{4> <[4> uh </[4> I wanted rather than just leave her in on Tuesday for the full day <{5> <[5> like </[5> bye-bye which 'd be worse for <{6> <[6> me </[6> and her <{7> <[7> obviously </[7> <#> Yeah so I think that 's put her out of sorts <{8> <[8> not going well you know <#> But uh </[8> heard she was okay great <#> She was upset for the first couple of hours <{9> <[9> but I </[9> hear she 's there she 's off again <&> baby crying </&> <#> She was upset for the first couple of hours <{10> <[10> but </[10> uh settled in afterwards <#> So then when I came she was there she was uh asleep
