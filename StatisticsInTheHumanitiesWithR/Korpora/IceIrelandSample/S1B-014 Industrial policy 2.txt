<S1B-014 Industrial policy 2><I><S1B-014$A> <#> Would you have any information to support the view that uhm multinationals essentially employ uh those good employees whereas uhm the Irish firms would have you know middle management and top management would be Irish whereas with the multinationals it would be essentially foreigners who control the upper echelons <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><S1B-014$B> <#> Well there isn't a great deal of of evidence but there is one article which is on your reading list which does help a little <,> and in fact I showed the slide at one of the sessions recently <,> and that article is uhm Kelly <,> on Irish electronics firms in the book uhm Perspectives on Irish Industry by Jim Fitzpatrick <#> And there 's one table in that uhm book which tries to answer that question <#> And it seems to show that uhm multinationals do have a very high proportion of uhm what I think he calls production workers uhm in comparison with other countries <,> and uh a very low proportion in what he calls management and professional categories <#> So but <,> you know that 's the only evidence I have now <#> Now the other evidence that it is available is of course the uhm publications like the Telesis Report in the early nineteen eighties <,> was very strong on that particular issue and uh O'Malley 's book which you hopefully know about or heard about at this stage <#> Uh there 's a few chapters in that uh where he quotes fairly widely from the Telesis Report <,> and the basic conclusion reached is that uhm most multinational firms <,> uh although they may appear to be high-tech industries <,> in fact employ large proportions of semi-skilled or unskilled workers<S1B-014$A> <#> Mm<S1B-014$B> <#> So that is coming through <,> and I <.> th </.> it is a problem<S1B-014$C> <#> Is that not good <#> I mean I I thought that we needed those jobs <#> They 're the industrial jobs that went <#> You know they 're the textiles and the <,> the millions of jobs that went or whatever in the fifties when we lost out to say Taiwan and people who were producing linen <.> man </.> manufactured goods very cheaply <,> so we needed those skills to try and <S1B-014$B> <#> Ah yes <#> You can't say no to them but it it is one of <,> you know it 's <,> obviously you do <#> Do and there are lots of people who are employed in manufacturing who would not be retrainable overnight <#> I mean one has to recognise that <,> that if you lost uh whatever the number we 're talking about is roughly <,> two hundred and ten thousand people employed in manufacturing today <,> now if they were made redundant now and let 's assume that eighty to ninety per cent are in relatively semi-skilled unskilled posts <,> it 'd be a large proportion <,> if they were made redundant tomorrow morning what on earth would one do <#> So you know you can argue that well <,> semi-skilled or unskilled posts are better than no posts <#> <{> <[> But it 's </[> one of the arguments against multinationals that they don't provide the sort of skilled posts that are arguably needed<S1B-014$A> <#> <[> But would you would you </[> </{> <S1B-014$A> <#> Would you also mention the lack of linkage now the uhm repatriation <unclear> several sylls </unclear> foreign firms<S1B-014$B> <#> I think that the uhm the linkages thing is important and is relevant to the question <{> <[> <,> </[> even though it wasn't directly asked in the question was it<S1B-014$A> <#> <[> Would you not say </[> </{><S1B-014$A> <#> You want to incorporate everything though don't you<S1B-014$B> <#> I know<&> later in class </&><S1B-014$B> <#> Yeah there are advantages and disadvantages obviously <#> The multinationals are repatriating a fair amount of the profits alright <#> That said we 've a major problem <#> But on the other hand uhm <,> is that an argument for getting rid of them altogether <#> <{> <[> Once </[> <,> once upon a time I suppose I thought it was an argument but I don't any more<S1B-014$A> <#> <[> No </[> </{><S1B-014$A> <#> No no of course not what I 'm saying like <,> relative to Irish firms it 's more desirable to have an Irish firm employing a thousand people than say a similar foreign firm <#> Is that not what you 'd say<S1B-014$D> <#> In the short term but in the long term when you look at the success of foreign firms you have to say that foreign firms probably were never as successful <,> and those jobs are probably more secure <#> So that as opposed to getting what a thousand Irish getting a thousand Irish jobs as opposed to a thousand foreignary jobs <,> they 're probably more secure in the long term<S1B-014$B> <#> Yeah it 's a very difficult issue <#> What is happening in the last few years <,> it is not entirely obvious <,> it 's not at all obvious in fact from the figures you have but it seems that really since Spain and Portugal joined the European Community <,> which was relatively recent in eighty-six wasn't it <,> that the number of multinationals coming in on an annual basis does not <,> does appear to have dropped <,> so that uh they 're not coming in as rapidly now because of this extra competition from other peripheral <,> desperate <,> if you like <,> countries<S1B-014$A> <#> Does Scotland not have a similar policy did someone say<S1B-014$B> <#> And then Eastern Germany now if you like<S1B-014$A> <#> What 's <,> and Eastern Europe 's going to once they <,> when they join I mean that 's going to get possibly very bad<S1B-014$B> <#> So <,> well that 's the point <,> so that to put all one 's eggs into the multinational basket probably would be misguided now <,> and and it does appear that the IDA and the government are saying look at <,> multinationals have a role but Irish indigenous firms we 've really got to get them out of the dreadful dregs that we 're in<S1B-014$A> <#> Could one not argue also that uhm the net losers in terms of competition for attracting multinational firms is the actual <,> the governments at the end of the day because if each government is competing to get a single multinational firm they 'll have more attractive more lucrative offers in terms of say given factors and stuff you know <#> The gain is the multinationals who at the end of the day can leave just as quickly as they came and the losers are the Irish government<S1B-014$B> <#> There 's a very serious issue there <#> Enormous sums of money are being paid to attract them in really <,> and enormous competition between Scotland and Ireland <,> England and Ireland uhm <,> France and Ireland Portugal <#> They they 're just out there bidding <,> effectively <#> You probably recall occasions when <,> was it Reynolds or was it Bertie Ahern or some of these guys went off to the States you know<&> later </&><S1B-014$B> <#> Now anybody who has <,> what about yourself <#> Have you <,> have you any any comment at all on this the multi <,> we we 're talking about the performance of multinational firms<S1B-014$E> <#> Yeah uh<S1B-014$B> <#> And so we 've talked about employment <,> we 've talked about regional dispersal <#> Linkages <,> I 'd like to come back on linkages but just before we do <,> anything you want to add <#> Or contradict<S1B-014$E> <#> Actually I was just wondering uhm I told you I was reading about this uhm EC legislation whereby EC countries uh are bound uh and they quote that thing about Digital <#> Uh uh I don't know if this is true now or not that Irish and say Scotland at the time it said what they could offer multinational companies coming in wasn't a question because obviously the British government could have offered much more incentives to Digital than we could have and uhm I thought the EEC asked for those other you know<S1B-014$B> <#> You 're quite right <#> Does anybody want to take on that question<S1B-014$A> <#> Well certainly there 's a limit to what the IDA IDA are <,> have been able to offer <#> Isn't that right <#> There 's only so far they can go<S1B-014$B> <#> Well the Irish legislation says a maximum of twenty-five per cent <,> I 'll be showing you some of the stuff today <#> But does anybody <#> His specific point is that the European Community has uhm <,> you called it legislation <,> which limits <#> Anybody want to comment on that no <#> Now we haven't covered it of course well I haven't covered it <#> Well basically just a quick <,> I 'll try to give you a quick answer <#> Uh European Community has what it calls Competition Policy <#> The competition is a critical element <#> It is a critical philosophy <#> Uh free trade <,> free movement of capital and labour <,> free movement of services <#> No tariffs <,> no quotas <,> all <,> you know <,> that is the theory behind the whole idea of the European Union and all these countries are together and there 's supposed to be free movement between the lot of them <#> No barriers <#> And so competition is the critical issue <,> and uh it 's very <.> spe </.> <,> very specifically written into the original European Community Treaty <,> nineteen fifty-six fifty-seven <#> Uh now at the same time as that <.> philos </.> <,> it 's a philosophy basically of the market <,> from market rules they say <,> and it 's a market economy and the European Commission therefore set up a range of directorates and one of the most crucial of all directorates is the competition directorate <#> Uh DG <,> is it DG six or G <#> There there 's twenty-three of them <#> But anyway the competition directorate <,> I can't remember the precise number of it <,> uh is constantly looking around for what they call unfair competition <#> And it 's directly relevant to what we 're talking about really and very the question is very important <#> They are going <,> they 're looking constantly at the incentive packages of all European countries <,> and they 're saying on a regular basis look at <,> this is out of order <#> And that is precisely what they said to us in relation to the export profits tax release scheme which we had operated in this country from fifty-six <,> uh in effect up to ninety-one <#> There were a number of minor changes in the early eighties but let 's for simplicity 's sake <,> from fifty-six to ninety-one and by ninety-one we were ordered effectively by the European Commission to phase it out because it represented unfair competition and it was contrary to the the fundamental competition policy of the European Community <#> Now the difficulty of course is that practically every European country <,> has a regional policy and if you think about it <,> a regional policy which attempts to <,> you know the sixty per cent grant <,> which attempts to move work from one area to another <,> discriminates in favour of one area rather than another <,> is obviously in direct conflict with competition policy <#> So there 's a sort of a <,> and the European Community accepts that regional policy is a critical element <#> So they wrote into the Treaty in fifty-six what they call derogations <#> They said well in cases where there are massive levels of unemployment in a region we will be prepared to allow uhm special incentives provided <,> they have another qualification <,> provided it does not interfere with the market mechanism <#> So it 's always uh there 's always this knife edge and this question mark surrounding whether <,> to try to answer your question <,> whether uhm the European Community can allow all these special incentives <#> But in our case they 've abolished one <,> and they 're always looking at it <#> In the British case for example they abolished the regional employment premium which was giving special <,> in the nineteen sixties and right through into the nineteen seventies the British were giving special employment incentives in a number of northern regions of England <,> and the European Commission ruled at that time that it was anti-competition or anti-competitive and so therefore they effectively said Get rid of it <#> And the British had to get rid of it <#> So that <,> I mean European policy is actually quite important and I 'm going to be <.> define </.> <,> and then when we come back I 'll be dealing with it in a few sessions</I>
