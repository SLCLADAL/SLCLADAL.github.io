<S1B-053 Multi-party talks 1><I><S1B-053$A> <#> Mr Chairman in rising to support uh my party 's motion before the Forum uh today I 'd particularly like to concentrate on the section uh of that motion which condemns the continuing IRA terrorist outrages <,> and calls upon all parties to ensure that there be no participation in the talks <,> by uh parties <,> and a party <.> par </.> in particular which continues to promote any illegal organisation <,> perpetrating such outrages or which fails to totally commit itself to exclusively peaceful means <#> This point is particularly uh dealt with <,> in our party 's paper on addressing decommissioning of the thirtieth of September this year <#> And it 's certainly a point where I have little argument with the points advanced by the leader of the UK Unionist Party Mr McCartney <#> And I 'd refer in particular to Section Five of our document <,> <#> <quote> Sinn Fe/in IRA must completely and unequivocally end its terrorist campaign </quote> <#> This will require more than a mere restoration of the ambivalent nineteen ninety-four ceasefire for there can now be no question of their entry to the process on the basis of that fraudulent ceasefire or any other ambiguous formula <#> The credibility of any ceasefire will largely depend on whether the actions of the paramilitaries concerned are consistent with an ending of terrorism for good <#> The continuation of paramilitary recruitment <,> training <,> targeting and social or economic terrorism would be incompatible with a genuine ending of the terrorist campaign <#> I am glad Mr Chairman <,> that Mr McCartney <,> in his six principles <,> accepts that position put forward by our party on Monday<S1B-053$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-053$A> <#> Sinn Fe/in IRA cannot enter<S1B-053$B> <#> Would Mr Hunter give way just for one moment<S1B-053$A> <#> One moment <,> <#> They cannot enter the talks until such time as we have in the words of the Labour leader at his conference Mr Blair <,> and Sir John Wheeler Security Minister last night <,> an unequivocal ceasefire <#> A ceasefire of nineteen ninety-four type <,> perhaps as advanced by Mo Mowlam the Labour spokesperson <,> is not acceptable <#> We must have an unequivocal ceasefire <,> <#> <{> <[> Only </[> when that point comes in <,> can there be any possibility of looking <,> to see whether or not Sinn Fe/in can in fact then enter the process <#> That remains the consistent position of the Ulster Unionist Party<S1B-053$B> <#> <[> Would you give way </[> </{><S1B-053$B> <#> Would you <,> would you give way <#> On one point <,> <#> The words <,> <mention> complete </mention> <,> and <mention> permanent </mention> are quite different <#> There is no mention in the Ulster Unionist document of a permanent ceasefire <#> When you stop your car at traffic lights you come to a complete stop but it 's not a permanent one<S1B-053$A> <#> Mr Chairman it is a complete and unequivocal end to the terrorist campaign <#> All due respect to my friend but it amounts to the same thing <#> It is an end <#> Now Mr Chairman there are two particular parties <,> that are holding up the advance of the Peace Process <#> The government of the Irish Free State <,> and the Social Democratic and Labour Party<S1B-053$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-053$A> <#> Those remain the two essential problems <#> Our party has sat down with the two governments to discuss aspects of decommissioning <#> We have no regrets for doing that <#> But it 's quite clear that the Irish Government are not interested in pushing forward and advancing peace in Northern Ireland <#> If they were to take a more positive attitude along with the minority population the SDLP who might even help by coming here <,> the the men from Martini who 'll talk to anyone anyplace anytime anywhere <#> Why don't they come along here and discuss the future of our country with their fellow countrymen <#> They 're afraid of that sort of debate <#> But make no mistake about it Mr Chairman our party remains committed to the process we have set out in our document addressing decommissioning <#> There will be no progress until such time as the governments deal properly with the legislation and again until those conditions of entry for Sinn Fe/in IRA are uh <.> a </.> accepted <,> uh both on our terms and indeed then reflected by the views of Mr McCartney <#> And we certainly are glad to see that other parties in this aspect are supporting the policy of our party <#> <{> <[> That 's important </[> <#> Thank-you Mr Chairman<S1B-053$X> <#> <[> Hear-hear </[> </{><S1B-053$C> <#> Thank-you Mr Hunter <#> You you have been commendably brief and thank-you for it <#> Mrs Iris Robinson <S1B-053$D> <#> Thank-you Mr Chairman <#> Uh I 'll try not to be repetitive <#> However <,> there are some points that can sensibly uh be repeated in order that the government <,> who have managed to ignore the majority 's views on most matters over those years know that we still hold firm to the fundamental principles surrounding the entry of Sinn Fe/in IRA to the talks process <#> Mr Chairman if it was left to me there would be no entry <,> under any circumstances to negotiations for Sinn Fe/in IRA <#> Those who are tethered to terrorism should not be allowed to pollute politics <#> They should not be rewarded for stopping their murder campaign <#> Sinn Fe/in IRA are using the political process as an extension of their so-called armed struggle <#> This Provo leopard will never change its spots <,> <#> I am glad that the leadership of my party were not conned by their ceasefire <#> Other Unionists told us that we should give Gerry Adams the benefit of the doubt <#> I would rather give him the benefit of permanent incarceration <#> Another Unionist told the world that he had a feeling in his guts <,> that the IRA ceasefire was for real <#> He should not have confused temporary IRA inactivity with his indigestion <#> This community is already cursing the day that the government elevated terrorists to the role of political agenda-setters<S1B-053$X> <unclear> several words </unclear><S1B-053$D> <#> The idea that the future of this Province should be decided by thugs and gunmen fills me in roughly equal proportions with disgust and horror <,> <#> The Government have forgotten the vile and heinous crimes these people have committed <#> Even when sharply reminded by the IRA in London and Manchester they soon let the deed fade from their minds <#> They the government attempted to justify their surrender to terrorism <.> b </.> <,> terrorism by telling us that the <.> par </.> paramilitary parties would only gain entry on the foot of an absolutely permanent ceasefire <#> They must hand over their illegal weapons <,> we were told <#> But as the months and years pass by this Government have watered these conditions down until they now will welcome the IRA to talks complete with their deadly arsenal <#> What confidence Mr Chairman could the decent people of this country have in such a rotten and iniquitous government <#> What I find even more nauseating is the way that politicians of principle <,> who hold to proper democratic values are portrayed as the villains <#> Those who insist that terrorists should give up their guns are described as wreckers and dishonourable <#> Now the government want to promote legislation to destroy evidence from any weapon that is to be decommissioned <#> The next step no doubt Mr Chairman will be to prevent the RUC from <,> from <.> in </.> pursuing inquiries into the many unsolved murders in our society <#> In other words close the files <,> and I suspect Mr Chairman that may be the case already <#> Mr Chairman <,> after three thousand deaths <,> tens of thousands of people maimed and injured <,> and billions of pounds of damage to the economy <,> I am not willing to grovel at the feet of Gerry Adams<S1B-053$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-053$D> <#> Even if I have to look on at the pathetic <.> go </.> <,> the pathetic spectacle of Her Majesty 's Government bowing and scraping before him <#> If the IRA thought that the Unionist community were as weak and wobbly <,> pliable and puny <,> faint and feeble <,> as some of those who claim to represent them <,> then I hope the lesson of Drumcree has not been lost on them <,> <#> The Unionist people Mr Chairman have had enough <,> and God help the one who tries to push them any further<S1B-053$C> <#> Thank-you Mrs Robinson <,> <#> Mr David Brewster<S1B-053$E> <#> Thank-you Chairman <,> <#> I 've listened to this debate with great interest and it 's certainly been a wide-ranging debate <,> from the broad European approach from my friend Professor Alcock to Mr Paisley 's uh gambit for Unionist unity <#> Now <,> Chairman <,> I think we all agree that we 're not happy with the rate of progress date <#> And whilst we are encouraged that there 's still been some progress we would all like it to have been more <#> Nevertheless there has been some considerable movement <,> uh from where we were in June <,> and I 'm sure Chairman you recall as I do uh in June there were rows about the appointment of the chairman <,> and at that particular uh time I recall that both the Democratic Unionist and the UK Unionist parties came out of uh Stormont Castle and were very negative about the position of the appointment of the chairman <#> Yet the following week they were back in the talks <,> they were accepting the jurisdiction and the chairmanship of Mr Mitchell <#> And on that point as with so many others it appears that our party has been proved right<S1B-053$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-053$E> <#> And Chairman <,> from that point there has definitely been a coming together and a development of some limited progress <,> certainly between the Unionist parties <#> And I 'm quite happy in the light of a very thoughtful and constructive speech today from Mr McCartney to say that in particular I feel that there 's a great deal in common between his party and ours<S1B-053$X> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-053$E> <#> And I have to quail before his justly famous vituperation when I say that that was not always the case <#> Perhaps even in June when he came out on the steps of Stormont Castle and was somewhat uhm disappointed shall we say with our <.> y </.> uh party 's position <#> Well at that occasion Chairman I have to say that uh unfortunately and ungraciously I kept thinking of a brief line from Gilbert and Sullivan and I do apologise to him because clearly this is no longer the case <#> But I couldn't help thinking of that couplet <,> <quote> I grew so rich that I was sent <,> from a pocket borough into Parliament <,> I always voted at my party 's call <,> and I never thought of thinking for myself at all <,> I thought so little they rewarded me <,> </quote> by making me a member of the DUP <,> <&> laughter </&> <#> Fortunately Chairman<S1B-053$B> <#> You must have worked overnight on that one<S1B-053$E> <#> I did <#> I did<S1B-053$F> <#> Don't give up the day job<S1B-053$E> <#> Fortunately Chairman <#> I 'll sing it if you want<S1B-053$C> <#> Next time <,> next time we 'll have to get you to sing Mr Brewster <S1B-053$E> <#> Fortunately Chairman Mr McCartney has seen sense and his very sensible six points today do insofar as they come along with the Unionist Party 's proposals<S1B-053$B> <#> You 've come along with them since they were printed before you produced your document <&> laughter </&><S1B-053$E> <#> That 's interesting <,> <#> That 's interesting <,> I 've I 've only seen them today Chairman and uh certainly insofar as they uh go down the road we want to go they 're not bad <#> But there are some things where perhaps we could see improvement <#> The first thing I see that he seeks a declaration by Sinn Fe/in IRA of a complete and permanent ceasefire <#> Now Chairman it 's already been alluded to by my friend <,> Mr Hunter <,> that we have asked for that <,> and more than that <,> we have said that words are not enough <#> The ceasefire credibly depends on whether their actions are consistent <,> and we are entitled as a party and we will make a judgement on whether any Sinn Fe/in or any other party 's actions are consistent with their words <,> <#> His second point <,> subscription by both Sinn Fe/in and IRA to the Mitchell principles <#> We have also stated that there must quote <,> <quote> be a solemn commitment to the principles in Mitchell on disarmament and decommissioning </quote> <#> And in case there 's any doubt this party does not and will never accept that there is a distinction between Sinn Fe/in and the IRA<S1B-053$B> <#> Hear-hear<S1B-053$E> <#> Thirdly <,> he says a declaration by the two governments that Sinn Fe/in 's entry into the talks at any stage must be preceded by the declaration of a complete and permanent ceasefire <#> And indeed <,> insofar as a government 's declaration is worth anything that would certainly assist <#> But governments ' declarations don't hold a great deal of weight in this country</I>
