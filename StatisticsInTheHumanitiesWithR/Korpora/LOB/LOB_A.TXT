A01   2 *<*'*7STOP ELECTING LIFE PEERS**'*>
A01   3 *<*4By TREVOR WILLIAMS*>
A01   4    |^A *0MOVE to stop \0Mr. Gaitskell from nominating any more Labour
A01   5 life Peers is to be made at a meeting of Labour {0M P}s tomorrow.
A01   6    |^\0Mr. Michael Foot has put down a resolution on the subject and
A01   7 he is to be backed by \0Mr. Will Griffiths, {0M P} for Manchester
A01   8 Exchange.
A01   9    |^Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a large majority
A01  10 of Labour {0M P}s are likely to turn down the Foot-Griffiths
A01  11 resolution.
A01  12 *<*7*'ABOLISH LORDS**'*>
A01  13    |^*0\0Mr. Foot's line will be that as Labour {0M P}s opposed the
A01  14 Government Bill which brought life peers into existence, they should
A01  15 not now put forward nominees.
A01  16    |^He believes that the House of Lords should be abolished and that
A01  17 Labour should not take any steps which would appear to *"prop up**" an
A01  18 out-dated institution.
A01  19    |^Since 1958, 13 Labour life Peers and Peeresses have been created.
A01  20    |^Most Labour sentiment would still favour the abolition of the
A01  21 House of Lords, but while it remains Labour has to have an adequate
A01  22 number of members.
A01  23 *<*6AFRICANS DROP RIVALRY TO FIGHT SIR ROY*>
A01  24 *<*4By DENNIS NEWSON*>
A01  25    |^T*0HE two rival African Nationalist Parties of Northern Rhodesia
A01  26 have agreed to get together to face the challenge from Sir Roy
A01  27 Welensky, the Federal Premier.
A01  28    |^Delegates from \0Mr. Kenneth Kaunda's United National
A01  29 Independence Party (280,000 members) and \0Mr. Harry Nkumbula's
A01  30 African National Congress (400,000) will meet in London today to
A01  31 discuss a common course of action.
A01  32    |^Sir Roy is violently opposed to Africans getting an elected
A01  33 majority in Northern Rhodesia, but the Colonial Secretary, \0Mr. Iain
A01  34 Macleod, is insisting on a policy of change.
A01  35    |^Sir Roy's United Federal Party is boycotting the London talks on
A01  36 the Protectorate's future.
A01  37    |^Said \0Mr. Nkumbula last night: ^*"We want to discuss what to do
A01  38 if the British Government gives in to Sir Roy and the talks fall
A01  39 through. ^There are bound to be demonstrations.**"
A01  40 *<*4All revealed*>
A01  41    |^*0Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide, \0Mr. Julius Greenfield,
A01  42 telephoned his chief a report on his talks with \0Mr. Macmillan at
A01  43 Chequers.
A01  44    |^\0Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at Lancaster House
A01  45 despite the crisis which had blown up. ^He has now revealed his full
A01  46 plans to the Africans and Liberals attending.
A01  47    |^These plans do not give the Africans the overall majority they
A01  48 are seeking. ^African delegates are studying them today.
A01  49    |^The conference will meet to discuss the function of a proposed
A01  50 House of Chiefs.
A01  51 *<*4No secret talks*- Macleod*>
A01  52 *<*4By *6HUGH PILCHER*>
A01  53    |^\0MR. IAIN MACLEOD, *4the Colonial Secretary, denied in the
A01  54 Commons last night that there have been secret negotiations on
A01  55 Northern Rhodesia's future.
A01  56    |^*0The Northern Rhodesia conference in London has been boycotted
A01  57 by the two main settlers' parties*- the United Federal Party and the
A01  58 Dominion Party.
A01  59    |^But representatives of Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the
A01  60 Central African Federation, went to Chequers at the week-end for talks
A01  61 with \0Mr. Macmillan. ^Northern Rhodesia is a member of the
A01  62 Federation.
A01  63    |^\0Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end meeting. ^But he told {0M
A01  64 P}s yesterday: ^*"I have no knowledge of secret negotiations.**"
A01  65    |^He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal
A01  66 Government. ^But the final decision remained with the British
A01  67 Government.
A01  68    |^*4\0Mr. James Callaghan, *0Labour's Colonial spokesman, said Sir
A01  69 Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks by refusing to sit
A01  70 round the conference table.
A01  71    |^\0Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian parties had refused to
A01  72 attend the talks because Sir Roy had found messages sent from the
A01  73 Government were *"unsatisfactory.**"
A01  74    |^African delegates to the talks yesterday called on \0Mr.
A01  75 Macmillan to cease his negotiations with Sir Roy's representative,
A01  76 \0Mr. Julius Greenfield. ^He was at Chequers last week-end.
A01  77    |^They said they regarded with *"growing anger**" the *"gross and
A01  78 unconstitutional**" interference by Sir Roy's Federal Government in
A01  79 the talks. ^Informal talks at Lancaster House will resume today.
A01  80 *<*2DEEP SOUTH SMEARS JACK'S NEGRO*>
A01  81    |^*4P*2RESIDENT KENNEDY *0today defended the appointment of a Negro
A01  82 as his Housing Minister. ^It has aroused strong opposition from the
A01  83 anti-Negro senators of the Deep South.
A01  84    |^The negro is \0Mr. Robert Weaver of New York. ^One of his tasks
A01  85 will be to see there is no racial discrimination in Government and
A01  86 State housing projects.
A01  87    |^Senator Allen Ellender, of Louisiana, sparked off the opposition
A01  88 by telling a television audience it was *"current Washington gossip**"
A01  89 that Weaver once had Communist affiliations.
A01  90 *<*4A letter*>
A01  91    |^*0The Senate Banking Committee, which is headed by another
A01  92 Southern Senator*- Willis Robertson, of Virginia*- met today in closed
A01  93 session to discuss Weaver's appointment.
A01  94    |^Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter to \0Mr.
A01  95 Kennedy saying he had received several complaints about Weaver's
A01  96 loyalty.
A01  97    |^He said these concerned \0Mr. Weaver's alleged association with
A01  98 organisations black-listed by the Government.
A01  99    |^Immediately \0Mr. Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator Robertson
A01 100 saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reported on \0Mr.
A01 101 Weaver.
A01 102    |^He believed he would perform *"outstanding service**" in his
A01 103 post.
A01 104    |^Senator Robertson's committee has to pass \0Mr. Weaver's
A01 105 nomination before it can be considered by the full Senate.
A01 106 *<*4Gold-hunting Kennedy shocks \0Dr. \0A*>
A01 107 *<*6GERMANY MUST PAY*>
A01 108 *<*4Offer of *+357\0m is too small*>
A01 109    |^*6PRESIDENT KENNEDY *4is ready to get tough over West Germany's
A01 110 cash offer to help America's balance of payments position.
A01 111    |^*0He said bluntly in Washington yesterday that the offer*-
A01 112 *+357million*- was not good enough. ^And he indicated that his
A01 113 Government would try to get Germany to pay more.
A01 114    |^He did not mention personal talks with \0Dr. Adenauer, the West
A01 115 German Chancellor. ^But he said discussions *"on a higher level than
A01 116 in the past**" might be useful.
A01 117    |^The President will probably discuss the problem with \0Dr.
A01 118 Brentano, the West German Foreign Minister, who is due in Washington
A01 119 next week.
A01 120    |^A big slice of Germany's *"aid**" is the early payment of a
A01 121 *+210million debt to America. ^United States officials quickly point
A01 122 out that this is money due to America anyway.
A01 123    |^And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim that they cannot
A01 124 pay more than *+357million without upsetting their own economy.
A01 125    |^The Americans say Germany is having it too good and is not paying
A01 126 for the past or for the present.
A01 127 *<*4Tough spot*>
A01 128    |^*0The Adenauer Government flatly rejected attempts by the
A01 129 Eisenhower Government to get them to pay a regular sum towards the
A01 130 cost of keeping American troops in Germany.
A01 131    |^These support costs are a big drain on America's dollar reserves.
A01 132 ^\0Dr. Adenauer's answer is the once-and-for-all cash offer of
A01 133 *+357million.
A01 134    |^President Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the West
A01 135 German Government.
A01 136    |^It will now have to pay more*- and increase taxation to do so*-
A01 137 or run the obvious risks in upsetting the new American administration.
A01 138    |^And, since this is election year in West Germany, \0Dr. Adenauer
A01 139 is in a tough spot.
A01 140 *<*4Waiting*>
A01 141    |^*1Joyce Egginton cables: ^*0President Kennedy at his Washington
A01 142 Press conference admitted he did not know whether America was lagging
A01 143 behind Russia in missile power. ^He said he was waiting for his senior
A01 144 military aides to come up with the answer on February 20.
A01 145    |^This surprising statement was a sharp about-face from his
A01 146 warnings during the Presidential election campaign. ^He claimed
A01 147 slackness in the Eisenhower Administration had caused America to lag
A01 148 behind Russia in nuclear development.
A01 149    |^President Kennedy did his best to avoid giving Pressmen a direct
A01 150 answer.
A01 151 *<*7HORRIFIED*>
A01 152 *<*5That's a Tory doctor's reaction to the new health charges, says
A01 153 George Brown*>
A01 154 *<*7*'PROBE THE DRUG PROFITS AND DON'T TAKE IT OUT OF MOTHERS AND
A01 155 CHILDREN**'*>
A01 156 *<*4By *6HUGH PILCHER*>
A01 157    |^TWO *4men who are poles apart in personality last night dominated
A01 158 Parliament's fiercest battle since the 1959 election*- \0Mr. George
A01 159 Brown and \0Mr. Enoch Powell, the Health Minister.
A01 160    |^\0*0Mr. Brown, passionate and warm-hearted, led Labour's attack
A01 161 on the higher health charges. ^\0Mr. Powell, white-faced and outwardly
A01 162 unemotional, replied with a statistical statement*- and ended by
A01 163 inciting Labour {0M P}s to angry uproar.
A01 164    |^One dealt with the human issue behind the Health Service; the
A01 165 other tried to show that the balance-sheet must always come first.
A01 166    |^The result of the vote was not in doubt. ^For the Tories were
A01 167 massed in answer to their whips to defeat a censure motion on the
A01 168 Government for *"undermining the Health Service**" and placing heavy
A01 169 burdens on those least able to bear them.
A01 170    |^\0Mr. Brown declared that the policy under censure was monstrous.
A01 171 ^It had offended many people far beyond the ranks of Labour
A01 172 supporters. ^The Press, many doctors and public were denouncing the
A01 173 proposals.
A01 174 *<*6THE LETTER*>
A01 175    |^*0He quoted from this letter which \0Mr. Gaitskell had received:
A01 176    |^*1*"My background is a doctor of 68, who has practised medicine
A01 177 for 43 years, chiefly as a panel doctor.
A01 178    |^*"I am a lifelong Conservative. ^I am horrified and amazed by my
A01 179 party's proposal to prostitute the whole principle of the State
A01 180 service and to render that service a hardship to poor people.
A01 181    |^*"After a lifetime of helping others and healing the sick, my
A01 182 considered opinion is that anybody supporting the increased charges is
A01 183 a wicked, old*-.**"
A01 184    |^*0\0Mr. Brown went on: ^*"We are dealing with a noble edifice
A01 185 which needs an imaginative architect to improve it, but it has got a
A01 186 quantity surveyor. ^We have descended from the real problems to
A01 187 fiddling about with bills of cost.
A01 188    |^*"We believe that a comprehensive medical service, free to the
A01 189 patient at the point of need and with one standard for all sick
A01 190 people, is good and attainable.
A01 191 **[END QUOTE**]
A01 192 *<*6DIFFERENT*>
A01 193    |^*0*"We remain for it. ^But the Tories never were.**"
A01 194    |^Interrupted by angry Tories, \0Mr. Brown retorted: ^*"The
A01 195 jackals bay when there is nothing better they can do.**"
A01 196    |^He told them that their conception of social services was wholly
A01 197 different*- fundamentally different from that of Labour.
A01 198    |^They would provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
A01 199 wretched*- but it would not be too comfortable nor too easy to get.
A01 200    |^Answering jeers that it was Labour which first put a ceiling on
A01 201 health spending and started charges, \0Mr. Brown reminded the hostile
A01 202 Government benches that was done in 1950 because of the financial
A01 203 strain of the Korean war.
A01 204    |^In fact, the Tories made it worse now for the sick and needy than
A01 205 Labour had to make it in 1950. ^And as a percentage of social service
A01 206 expenditure, health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per \0cent.
A01 207    |^Then \0Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the unsmiling \0Mr.
A01 208 Powell.
A01 209    |^He demanded that instead of taking it out of the patients \0Mr.
A01 210 Powell should take ruthless action against the drug making industry,
A01 211 whose profits had risen by up to 400 per \0cent. in the last eight
A01 212 years.
A01 213    |^*"\0Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out of mothers,
A01 214 children and sick people than to take on this vast industry,**" \0Mr.
A01 215 Brown commented icily.
A01 216    |^*"Let us have a full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the
A01 217 pharmaceutical industry.**"
A01 218    |^The health of children today owed much to the welfare food
A01 219 scheme. ^It was maintained during the war. ^Now in conditions of Tory
A01 220 affluence it seemed it could not be carried on.
A01 221    |^When \0Mr. Brown sat down Labour {0M P}s cheered for a full
A01 222 minute*- and even his bitterest opponents on defence joined in.
A01 223 *<*6THE CHOICE*>
A01 224    |^*0\0Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving details of plans
A01 225 for improving the hospital service, on which indeed the Government is
A01 226 making progress.
A01 227    |^His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that *"even
A01 228 after the proposed changes the net cost of the service to the
A01 229 Exchequer will have increased over three years by 20 per \0cent.
A01 230    |^*"That cannot continue without either development being limited
A01 231 or an adjustment being made in financing.**"
A01 232    |^The Government decided to adjust the financing*- which \0Mr.
A01 233 Powell claimed was underpinning*- not undermining*- the service.
A01 234    |^Answering the attack on *"economic charges**" for welfare foods,
A01 235 \0Mr. Powell said that all these foods would still be free in families
A01 236 receiving regular National Assistance grants.
A01 237    |^Of the doubled prescription charge his argument was: ^*"It is
A01 238 ludicrous exaggeration to say that by and large a 2\0s. charge is any
A01 239 more of a burden than a 1\0s. charge was in 1949.**"
A01 240 *<*6*'RESIGN**'*>
A01 241    |^*0Uproar from the Labour side grew as \0Mr. Powell made more and
A01 242 more claims with which {0M P}s disagreed.

A02   2 *<*6MAC PICKS HIS MARKET TEAM*>
A02   3 *<*4Our man in Paris is \0No 1 aide to Heath*>
A02   4 *<By *6JOHN DICKIE*>
A02   5    |^\0MR. MACMILLAN *4has picked a strong *"brains trust**" team to
A02   6 negotiate terms for joining the Common Market.
A02   7    |^*0And he has abandoned plans to visit President \de Gaulle this
A02   8 month to smooth the way.
A02   9    |^General \de Gaulle's official welcome last week to Britain's
A02  10 moves towards the Six was taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall,
A02  11 but no more than that. ^So the idea of a personal mission by the Prime
A02  12 Minister to Paris was dropped.
A02  13    |^Instead \0Mr. Macmillan will rely on a hand-picked team under the
A02  14 leadership of Sir Pierson Dixon, Britain's Ambassador to France, to
A02  15 back \0Mr. Edward Heath, Lord Privy Seal, who is charged with the
A02  16 conduct of negotiations with the Six.
A02  17 *<*4In touch*>
A02  18    |^*0At the same time the Prime Minister has offered Commonwealth
A02  19 Governments every facility possible to safeguard their interests.
A02  20    |^Seven Commonwealth countries have told \0Mr. Sandys, Commonwealth
A02  21 Relations Secretary, that they wish to be kept in touch in London.
A02  22    |^Three of them*- Canada, Australia, and New Zealand*- will have
A02  23 strong delegations at an opening meeting in London on Monday.
A02  24    |^Once the Common Market's Council of Ministers draws up the
A02  25 procedure for negotiations in a fortnight's time, these Commonwealth
A02  26 countries can arrange for observers to advise the British negotiating
A02  27 team.
A02  28    |^The team is composed of experienced negotiators in several
A02  29 fields.
A02  30    |^*4Sir Pierson Dixon *0has a wide reputation as a skilful
A02  31 backstage negotiator since his days as Britain's chief {0UN}
A02  32 delegate.
A02  33 *<*4The team*>
A02  34    |^*0Second in command is \0*4Mr. Eric Roll, *053-year-old Deputy
A02  35 Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Fisheries.
A02  36    |^The Foreign Office is represented by *4Sir Roderick Barclay,
A02  37 *0who has taken part in all the detailed Common Market exchanges over
A02  38 the past year with the French, Germans, and Italians.
A02  39    |^Other leading members are: *4Sir Henry Lintott *0from the
A02  40 Commonwealth Relations Office, *4Sir William Corell-Barnes *0(Colonial
A02  41 Office), \0*4Mr. {0G. R.} Bell *0(Treasury), and \0*4Mr. {0G. H.}
A02  42 Andrew *0(Board of Trade).
A02  43    |^They will accompany \0Mr. Heath next month when he goes to
A02  44 Brussels, headquarters of the Common Market Commission, or wherever
A02  45 the Six decide negotiations should be held.
A02  46    |^Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a meeting in
A02  47 Paris between \0M. Couve \de Murville, French Foreign Minister, and
A02  48 \0Mr. Heath.
A02  49 *<*4Selwyn in strikeland*>
A02  50 *<From *6WILLIAM FORREST ACCRA, *4Monday*>
A02  51    |^\0M*0R. Selwyn Lloyd*- a man with troubles enough back home*-
A02  52 seems fated to fly into trouble abroad.
A02  53    |^Last year it was the riots in Istanbul, which enlivened the
A02  54 {0*6NATO} *0Council meeting.
A02  55    |^Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in Ghana coinciding
A02  56 with the meeting of the Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council*-
A02  57 the first to be held in Africa.
A02  58    |^Only a few hours after \0Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation
A02  59 landed at Accra this morning, hundreds of shop assistants demonstrated
A02  60 outside the British-owned Kingsway Stores, the largest in town.
A02  61    |^The stores had been hit by the same strike wave that has
A02  62 paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past week.
A02  63    |^Root of the discontent: The austerity Budget, including a
A02  64 compulsory savings scheme which the Ghana Government introduced in
A02  65 July.
A02  66    |^Ghana's strong man is not here to face the storm. ^President
A02  67 Nkrumah, having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference in
A02  68 Belgrade, has resumed his holiday on the Black Sea and no one here
A02  69 professes to know when he will return.
A02  70    |^But in his absence his chief lieutenants have not let him down.
A02  71 ^The strong arm of authority has been raised against the strikers and
A02  72 is now beginning to tell.
A02  73    |^Today's *1Ghanaian Times *0(motto: ~*"The welfare of the people
A02  74 is the supreme law**") reports: ^*"The Government has been urged to
A02  75 take immediate action to deal ruthlessly with the strikers.**"
A02  76    |^The urge came from a conference of activists of Nkrumah's
A02  77 Convention Party *"after powerful addresses by Comrades Krobo Edusei,
A02  78 Tawia Adamafio,**" and others.
A02  79 *<*4Ultimatum*>
A02  80    |^*0Strong deeds followed strong words. ^In Takoradi a *"limited
A02  81 state of emergency**" was declared, giving the Government adequate
A02  82 power to maintain all essential services and ensure food supplies.
A02  83    |^Thus it becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment for
A02  84 anyone who *"publishes a report likely to cause alarm or prejudicial
A02  85 to public safety.**"
A02  86    |^And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed on anyone
A02  87 convicted of sabotage.
A02  88    |^These stern measures had the desired effect today at Kumasi where
A02  89 the strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre, they
A02  90 are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400 police and 16
A02  91 armoured cars.
A02  92    |^And how did the Government react when the strikers demonstrated
A02  93 in Accra?
A02  94    |^At 9.40 \0Mr. Edusei, Minister of Transport and probably the
A02  95 toughest man in \0Mr. Nkrumah's team, drove up to the Kingsway Stores
A02  96 and faced the demonstrators, most of them shopgirls in overalls.
A02  97    |^*"If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock,**" he told them,
A02  98 *'the police will act.**' ^At five to ten a posse of police arrived
A02  99 and in less than two minutes the crowd had gone.
A02 100    |^If the threatened *"counter-revolution**" was not enough to bring
A02 101 the President back from his travels it might have been thought that
A02 102 the muster from the 13 States of the Commonwealth was an occasion
A02 103 worthy of his presence.
A02 104    |^After all it was \0Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this year the
A02 105 Economic Consultative Council should meet in Accra.
A02 106    |^It has been left, however, to \0Mr. Goka, Ghana's Finance
A02 107 Minister, to do the honours as host, in which capacity he held a

A02 145 *<From *6HARVEY WARD *4Salisbury, Monday*>
A02 146    |^S*2IR *0Roy Welensky said today that he no longer accepted the
A02 147 good faith of \0Mr. Kenneth Kaunda.
A02 148    |^Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister, said that \0Mr.
A02 149 Kaunda's United National Independence Party was a monster as vicious
A02 150 as the Zambia National Congress, which was led by \0Mr. Kaunda until
A02 151 he was outlawed in 1959.
A02 152    |^The record of lawlessness among {0*2UNIP} *0supporters went
A02 153 back a long way, Sir Roy told the Federal Parliament in Salisbury.
A02 154    |^He cited cases in which hundreds of {0*2UNIP} *0supporters had
A02 155 been arrested or convicted since last year on charges of creating
A02 156 disturbances.
A02 157 *<*4Convicted*>
A02 158    |^*0During the first three weeks of the present trouble 287
A02 159 incidents had been reported in Northern Rhodesia.
A02 160    |^More than 500 people*- 167 of them members of the {0*2UNIP}*-
A02 161 *0were convicted last month in the Northern Province alone.
A02 162    |^*"Against this background must be taken \0Mr. Kaunda's repeated
A02 163 statements that all he is doing is in the name of non-violence,**"
A02 164 said Sir Roy.
A02 165    |^*"I am now compelled to say that I don't accept his good
A02 166 faith.**"
A02 167    |^He said \0Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements had stimulated
A02 168 violence, but he had done nothing to stop it.
A02 169    |^*"It is true he made a point of again being absent from Northern
A02 170 Rhodesia when his followers have indulged in such violence.**"
A02 171    |^But Sir Roy pointed out that a few months ago \0Mr. Kaunda said
A02 172 that if {0*2UNIP} *0did not get its way what would happen would make
A02 173 the Mau Mau in Kenya *"seem like a child's picnic.**"

A03   2 *<*6\0MR. TOURE IN ZAGREB*>
A03   3 *<\0PRES. TITO'S POLICY FOR NEUTRALISM*>
A03   4 *<*2FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT*>
A03   5 *<VIENNA, \0*0Jan. 9*>
A03   6    |^President Tito and \0Mr. Se*?2kou Toure*?2 arrived today in
A03   7 Zagreb, where crowds of people welcomed the Yugoslav leader's guest,
A03   8 who is celebrating his thirty-ninth birthday there.
A03   9    |^The state visit of the President of Guinea is evidently regarded
A03  10 by the Yugoslav leader as an emphasis on Yugoslavia's affinity with
A03  11 Asian and African countries and, moreover, an opportunity to underline
A03  12 his support for anti-colonial movements. ^Coming as it did, soon after
A03  13 the conference at Casablanca, the Yugoslav press has written much on
A03  14 the significance of the meeting of leaders of Africa, placing
A03  15 particular stress on the urgency to settle the Congolese and Algerian
A03  16 problems and condemning the *"intervention of colonial and
A03  17 neo-colonial**" Powers.
A03  18    |^\0Mr. Se*?2kou Toure*?2's stay in Yugoslavia is one in the series
A03  19 of forthcoming visits of neutralist leaders from those continents, and
A03  20 President Tito has already indicated that soon he is to travel to some
A03  21 of those countries. ^Today, for example, the Foreign Minister of
A03  22 Indonesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav Foreign
A03  23 Minister.
A03  24 *<*6CONFERENCE FAVOURED*>
A03  25    |^*0In fact such Yugoslav activity has been particularly
A03  26 intensified in the past year or so and though so far, apart from joint
A03  27 action in the United Nations, these exchanges have not been seen on
A03  28 any wider basis, President Tito is known for some time to have
A03  29 favoured a conference of neutralist leaders.
A03  30    |^The wish was particularly apparent in comments on the occasion of
A03  31 the conference in Casablanca and, in particular, in Yugoslav approval
A03  32 of the idea of an inter-African consultative assembly which would
A03  33 coordinate activity on the political and economic sphere; and it is
A03  34 not difficult to see that President Tito would like some such idea
A03  35 extended also to the whole uncommitted world.
A03  36    |^But he now feels, in view of a changed international situation
A03  37 and especially in view of fresh problems facing the new and
A03  38 independent countries of Africa, that the time is ripe to have more
A03  39 frequent consultations between the uncommitted countries and even to
A03  40 work out common stands on various problems facing those nations.
A03  41    |^Two subjects, the Congo and Algeria, are the main topics of the
A03  42 talks in Belgrade*- and on both the two leaders have identical ideas.
A03  43 *<*6LAOS INVITATION TO PRINCE SOUVANNA*>
A03  44 *<REQUEST TO RETURN*>
A03  45 *<*2FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT*>
A03  46 *<SAIGON, \0*0Jan. 9*>
A03  47    |^*0Two emissaries from the Laotian Government of Prince Boun Oum
A03  48 have arrived in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to invite Prince Souvanna
A03  49 Phouma, the former Prime Minister, to return to Laos. ^No details of
A03  50 their mission have been disclosed, but it was reported earlier in Laos
A03  51 that Prince Boun Oum was considering asking Prince Souvanna Phouma to
A03  52 join his Government.
A03  53    |^Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to the mission, but
A03  54 recent statements made by him in Phnom Penh indicate that he still
A03  55 regards himself as the only legal Prime Minister of Laos.
A03  56    |^His policy of strict neutrality from 1951 to 1958 kept the
A03  57 kingdom in peace, though at the cost of virtual partition of the
A03  58 country into the pro-communist north and the pro-western centre and
A03  59 south.
A03  60 *<*6*"LEGAL GOVERNMENT**"*>
A03  61    |^*0Prince Souvanna's former Minister of Information, \0Mr. Quinim
A03  62 Pholsena, who claims to be his representative in Laos, yesterday
A03  63 addressed all officers of the pro-communist forces occupying the
A03  64 province of Xieng Khouang and emphasized that Prince Souvanna's
A03  65 Government was the only legal one in the country.
A03  66    |^Prince Souphannouvong, leader of the pro-communist Neo Lao Haksat
A03  67 Party, also spoke to the officers in the same terms. ^This emphasis on
A03  68 the legality of the former Government suggests that all is not well
A03  69 with the political and military leadership of the pro-communists.
A03  70 ^Most of the province of Xieng Khouang and the tactically useful Plain
A03  71 of Jars, however, appear still to be firmly in their hands.
A03  72    |^The Government has claimed the recapture of Vang Vieng, the
A03  73 pro-communists' former base 60 miles north of Vientiane, but this
A03  74 claim had been made before the end of last month. ^A correspondent who
A03  75 travelled yesterday to within a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by
A03  76 officers that this village was still held by the pro-communists.
A03  77 *<*6NEW IMAGE OF LIBERAL PARTY LEADER FOR CANADIANS*>
A03  78 *<*4From Our Own Correspondent*>
A03  79 *<*2OTTAWA*>
A03  80    |^*0With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica and his
A03  81 Cabinet out in the grass roots making 160 speeches in 80
A03  82 constituencies in 10 days, the Liberal Party are holding a national
A03  83 conference here with some 2,000 delegates, the biggest gathering since
A03  84 1958 when \0Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party leader.
A03  85    |^In some ways it will be a testing occasion for him, although some
A03  86 think his position unassailable simply because there is no one else in
A03  87 sight to supplant him. ^So the conference will concentrate on laying
A03  88 the foundations on which to win the next election.
A03  89 *<*6CONSERVATIVE STOCK LOW*>
A03  90    |^*0The rally comes at a time when in spite of carefully worded
A03  91 statements by the Prime Minister there is an air of electoral
A03  92 expectancy. ^Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on a new
A03  93 Conservative booklet called *1The Record Speaks *0which outlines in
A03  94 some detail the accomplishments of the party since it came to office
A03  95 three and a half years ago. ^Nevertheless there is little illusion in
A03  96 the Conservative Party that their stock at home has fallen in the face
A03  97 of heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy.
A03  98    |^Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative provincial
A03  99 governments, Quebec and New Brunswick, and in the four federal
A03 100 by-elections last October the party fared badly. ^They are now faced
A03 101 with four other by-elections, one at Esquimalt Saanich, British
A03 102 Columbia, one in Leeds, Ontario, and the other two in the Maritimes*-
A03 103 Restigouche Madawaska, New Brunswick, and Kings, Prince Edward Island.
A03 104 ^All four were Conservative strongholds.
A03 105    |^Last September a public poll showed that for the first time since
A03 106 the Administration came to power in 1957 the Liberals were ahead (43
A03 107 per cent were in favour of *"The Grits**" if a federal election had
A03 108 been held last autumn, 38 per cent for the Conservatives and 12 per
A03 109 cent for the {0C.C.F.}). ^However, a separate poll revealed that
A03 110 \0Mr. Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of popularity as an
A03 111 individual leader (for \0Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent, for \0Mr.
A03 112 Pearson 34 per cent).
A03 113    |^How far is \0Mr. Lester Pearson acceptable to the people of
A03 114 Canada as a Prime Minister? ^Many observers at the national rally will
A03 115 be seeking an answer. ^It is difficult for many to see \0Mr. Pearson
A03 116 in the role of a popular orator at the hustings, the spellbinder that
A03 117 \0Mr. Diefenbaker was in the last two campaigns. ^The impression
A03 118 remains that the Liberal leader is still the diplomatist, more at home
A03 119 in the chancery, or the corridors of the United Nations, not the
A03 120 father figure, so necessary in Canadian leadership, or the practical
A03 121 politician, able to talk about sewage problems in Algoma East. ^On the
A03 122 other hand, \0Mr. Pearson excels in meeting people informally, but
A03 123 many still regard him *"as some sort of cross between an egghead and a
A03 124 missionary**".
A03 125 *<*6BOW TIE GONE*>
A03 126    |^*0His party advisers are now trying to correct that image. ^The
A03 127 bow tie has gone; he is having lessons on television techniques and is
A03 128 being coached by speech experts. ^Everything is being done to promote
A03 129 a new image. ^Certainly, he is now a much tougher character
A03 130 politically than when he took over the leadership. ^He was mercilessly
A03 131 trounced by \0Mr. Diefenbaker in the House in those early days. ^It
A03 132 has been a hard road back but now, with plenty of political ammunition
A03 133 given him by the Government in recent sessions, he is leading the
A03 134 Opposition with skill and assurance and is a match for the Prime
A03 135 Minister across the floor.
A03 136    |^\0Mr. Pearson is now talking about *"his new and dynamic
A03 137 liberalism**" and this week will show perhaps how far *"Mike**" will
A03 138 go. ^The main topic under review is unemployment, but there will be 21
A03 139 committees examining subjects ranging from foreign investment in
A03 140 Canada to the problems of the Atlantic provinces.
A03 141    |^However, be this election year or not, \0Mr. Pearson, with his
A03 142 party increasingly confident of return to power, must convey to the
A03 143 nation that he has the stamp of a Prime Minister of Canada.
A03 144 *<*6BONN DOUBTS ON EUROPEAN SPACE PROJECT*>
A03 145 *<\0MR. THORNEYCROFT'S TASK TO REMOVE SCEPTICISM*>
A03 146 *<*4From Our Own Correspondent*>
A03 147 *<*2BONN, \0*0Jan. 9*>
A03 148    |^\0Mr. Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, who arrives in Bonn
A03 149 tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a European space
A03 150 satellite project, will find the Germans interested in the principle
A03 151 of space research, but rather sceptical about British plans for
A03 152 organizing it. ^Stated more bluntly, they are still unconvinced that
A03 153 this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to salve Blue
A03 154 Streak, which was abandoned last summer as a military project; or that
A03 155 the new European space satellite is indeed to be purely scientific in
A03 156 character.
A03 157    |^\0Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to remove these doubts,
A03 158 and to persuade the Federal Government that the financial burden
A03 159 involved is really worth while, at a time when any increase in
A03 160 budgetary commitments would almost certainly involve a corresponding
A03 161 rise in taxation*- something no one is prepared to contemplate in an
A03 162 election year.
A03 163 *<*6DUPLICATED EFFORT*>
A03 164    |^*0The cost of the European satellite project is estimated to be
A03 165 at least *+60\0m. spread over five years. ^A Foreign Ministry
A03 166 spokesman said today that west Germany, mainly for budgetary reasons,
A03 167 had not signed a resolution adopted at an international conference in
A03 168 Geneva last December, which called for the drawing up of a European
A03 169 convention on a space satellite project.
A03 170    |^But, at the same time, there is reason to believe that the
A03 171 Federal Government is not convinced, on the basis of the information
A03 172 it has so far, that such a project would be justified from a
A03 173 scientific point of view; and not merely constitute a *"prestige**"
A03 174 satellite, duplicating to some extent American efforts, as {*1Die
A03 175 Welt} *0suggests today in a highly critical editorial article.
A03 176    |^On the specific question of the use of Blue Streak, \0Mr.
A03 177 Thorneycroft's task will be easier. ^He can point out that this is the
A03 178 only rocket and launcher in Europe to have reached a sufficient stage
A03 179 of development for adaptation as the first stage in putting a heavy
A03 180 satellite into outer space. ^There has also been some talk of adopting
A03 181 another British rocket, Black Knight, for the second stage, but the
A03 182 French have one of their own called Veronique which they would like to
A03 183 see used.
A03 184 *<*6MISSILE FEARS*>
A03 185    |^*0Perhaps one of the main reasons for German misgivings is the
A03 186 fear that the French may not be especially interested in scientific
A03 187 research as such, but more anxious to develop something which could
A03 188 carry an atomic warhead of their own manufacture. ^The Federal
A03 189 Government has made it clear that it would have no part in any project
A03 190 for the development of long-range missiles*- which in any case would
A03 191 contravene the provisions of the Brussels treaty. ^The Foreign
A03 192 Ministry spokesman added today, however, that the Brussels Treaty was
A03 193 irrelevant, because research on the various rocket stages had already
A03 194 been concluded, and only cooperation on the type of capsule was
A03 195 involved.
A03 196    |^A lesser obstacle to German participation is the absence of any
A03 197 Ministry or Minister directly responsible for it*- and therefore of
A03 198 any budget under which funds could be appropriated.
A03 199    |^Meanwhile, Professor Eugen Sa"nger, chairman of the German
A03 200 Society for Rocket and Space Travel, has arrived in London as a
A03 201 representative of the Federal Government, together with experts from
A03 202 other countries, to study Blue Streak. ^He will be taking part in an
A03 203 international conference on the space project which will meet on
A03 204 January 30 in London.
A03 205 *<*6OTHER VENTURES*>
A03 206    |^*0During his two-day stay in Bonn, \0Mr. Thorneycroft will also
A03 207 have talks with Herr Strauss, the Minister of Defence, Professor
A03 208 Erhard, the Minister of Economics, Herr \von Brentano, the Foreign
A03 209 Minister, and \0Dr. Seebohm, the Transport Minister. ^He will discuss
A03 210 various plans for joint research and development of military items,
A03 211 and in particular, it is understood, a vertical take-off fighter
A03 212 aircraft. ^This is expected eventually to replace the Fiat G-91, and
A03 213 the F 104 Starfighter, the backbone of the German Air Force.

A04  12    |^There General \de Gaulle had made clear that he would accept

A04  33 *<*6COMMUNIQUE*>
A04  34    |^*0The joint communique on \0Mr. Kennedy's and \0Mr. Macmillan's
A04  35 third talks*- the first were at Key West, Florida, the second in
A04  36 Washington*- said:
A04  37    |^*"Their discussions covered the major problems, both economic and
A04  38 political, and revealed once again the close agreement of the two
A04  39 Governments in pursuing their common purposes.
A04  40    |^*"Occasion was given to review the need for economic co-operation
A04  41 and expansion in the general interests of developed and underdeveloped
A04  42 countries alike.**"
A04  43    |^It said that the President and Premier noted *"with
A04  44 satisfaction**" the agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective
A04  45 Laos ceasefire, which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement
A04  46 at the Geneva conference.
A04  47    |^*"Particular attention was also given to the nuclear tests
A04  48 conference and to the question of disarmament.
A04  49    |^*"The situation in regard to Germany was reviewed, and there was
A04  50 full agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
A04  51 obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin.**"
A04  52    |^Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch
A04  53 given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with \0Mrs. Kennedy and other guests
A04  54 present, \0Mr. Kennedy and \0Mr. Macmillan met three more times
A04  55 yesterday.
A04  56 *<*6PESSIMISTIC*>
A04  57    |^*0In *6PARIS, \0*0Mr. Dean Rusk, {0U.S.} Secretary of State,
A04  58 gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the 15-nation Nato
A04  59 council. ^Some of his listeners said he was *"rather pessimistic**"
A04  60 and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year.
A04  61    |^From Nato headquarters \0Mr. Rusk went to see President \de
A04  62 Gaulle and informed him of the Vienna outcome. ^Last night \0Mr. Rusk
A04  63 arrived in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
A04  64 fly home with the President.
A04  65    |^In *2DUESSELDORF, *0Chancellor Adenauer said the Vienna talks
A04  66 *"might be the beginning of a slight improvement,**" but no big

A04  71 with President Kennedy, writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow.
A04  72    |^The good beginning made at Vienna must be followed up by new
A04  73 efforts for peace, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
A04  74 declared yesterday.
A04  75    |^Events in Vienna *"gave hope to people of goodwill who hate the
A04  76 cold war, and to all who are striving for a stable peace,**" write the

A04  78 *<*6GOOD BEGINNING*>
A04  79    |^*0*"Thinking over the results of the Vienna meeting, peace-loving
A04  80 people will say *'a good beginning.**'**"
A04  81    |^\0Mr. Krushchov remained at the airport to join President
A04  82 Brezhnev in welcoming \0Dr. Sukarno, President and Prime Minister of
A04  83 Indonesia, who arrived by Boeing 707 jet on a state visit 40 minutes
A04  84 after \0Mr. Khrushchov had arrived from Vienna.
A04  85    |^A cheering, delighted crowd of Indonesian students broke through
A04  86 crash barriers to surround their President on the tarmac for several

A04  88 *<*6FAREWELL SPEECH*>
A04  89    |^*0In *6VIENNA, *0before flying off to Moscow, \0Mr. Khrushchov
A04  90 said he hoped his weekend talks with President Kennedy would help *"to
A04  91 establish an enduring peace between nations.**"
A04  92    |^Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President Schaerf,
A04  93 the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for the hospitality and welcome he
A04  94 had received.
A04  95    |^*"The Soviet Union has always striven and is striving to
A04  96 safeguard an enduring peace for the peoples, to secure an early
A04  97 solution of the disarmament problem, and to bring about a peaceful
A04  98 settlement of international disputes through negotiations,**" he said.
A04  99 *<*4Gaitskell defends Polaris, Nato and himself*>
A04 100 *<From *6GEORGE SINFIELD*>
A04 101 *<*2HASTINGS, *0Monday*>
A04 102    |^*6\0M*2R. GAITSKELL *0today delivered a full-blooded defence of
A04 103 the Polaris missile base. ^And by implication he supported the
A04 104 establishment of sites in Britain for the training of German troops.
A04 105    |^His main theme was that nuclear weapons were necessary to defend
A04 106 Britain, that Britain must depend on Nato and *"the West**" must have
A04 107 nuclear weapons so long as the Soviet Union has them.
A04 108    |^Addressing the annual congress of the National Union of General
A04 109 and Municipal Workers, he said he felt sure the Labour movement was
A04 110 coming round in support of his views.
A04 111    |^Obviously conscious of the fierce and widespread resentment over
A04 112 the {0U.S.} Polaris base in Britain, \0Mr. Gaitskell said that he
A04 113 even noticed that supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were
A04 114 changing their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on to the
A04 115 missile.
A04 116    |^\0Mr. Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could not deny
A04 117 facilities to nations to which it was allied. ^But governments should
A04 118 be free to negotiate and refuse proposals with which they did not
A04 119 agree.
A04 120 *<*4Outdated Thor*>
A04 121    |^*0The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because, he said, they
A04 122 were out of date and vulnerable and would attract enemy action.
A04 123    |^That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine. ^So long as
A04 124 the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons, the West, somewhere, must have
A04 125 them too.
A04 126 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
A04 127    |^It was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory purposes to
A04 128 be under the sea rather than on land. ^This was why the Labour Party
A04 129 did not think it right to oppose the Polaris depot ship.
A04 130 **[END INDENTATION**]
A04 131    |^The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base in the
A04 132 Holy Loch, only 30 miles from Glasgow, a city with two million people.
A04 133 ^It should be sited in a more remote area.
A04 134    |^\0Mr. Gaitskell added that the Scarborough conference decisions
A04 135 did not, in his view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority of
A04 136 party members and still less the party's supporters in the country.
A04 137    |^He was afraid lest the decisions would mean the labelling of the
A04 138 party at a future General Election that it did not *"care about the
A04 139 defence and security of our country.**"
A04 140    |^After saying that \0Mr. Khrushchov believed Russian power to
A04 141 retaliate had stopped a {0U.S.} attack upon the Soviet Union, \0Mr.
A04 142 Gaitskell said that what stopped the Russians in the last resort from
A04 143 aggressive nuclear war was the certainty that they would be
A04 144 annihilated.
A04 145    |^\0Mr. Gaitskell added that agreement with the unilateralists was
A04 146 not possible, though he respected their views.
A04 147    |^He saw by reports that *"those who organise these things**" were
A04 148 recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament to shift
A04 149 the emphasis of their intervention away from straight opposition to
A04 150 the official document on to opposition to the Polaris base.
A04 151 *<*4Nuclear spread*>
A04 152    |^*0To \0Mr. Macmillan, \0Mr. Gaitskell said the Prime Minister
A04 153 should begin to take seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
A04 154 weapons within the Nato alliance.
A04 155    |^*"Let us say to Macmillan that he should press, I hope with the
A04 156 agreement of Kennedy, in talks with the Soviet Union, for the
A04 157 establishment in central Europe of a zone of controlled
A04 158 disarmament.**"
A04 159    |^He thought, he said, that the Soviet Union would be prepared to
A04 160 reach an agreement on a zone of controlled disarmament in Europe.
A04 161    |^\0Mr. Gaitskell concluded, declaring that the present was the
A04 162 beginning of a great period of opportunity for the party. ^It was a
A04 163 great chance that should be grasped.
A04 164    |^Inter-union jealousies prevent the fulfilment of a common policy
A04 165 for wages and other major questions, *4\0Mr. Jack Cooper, *0president,
A04 166 declared when congress opened.
A04 167 *<*4Gap widened*>
A04 168    |^*0He complained that the gap between earnings of manual workers
A04 169 in local government, compared with the average in all industries for
A04 170 men over 21, had widened over the past ten years from 34\0s to 73\0s a
A04 171 week.
A04 172    |^\0Mr. Cooper suggested that the distortion arose from enhanced
A04 173 payments agreed at local level. ^Local negotiations and bargaining by
A04 174 branch officers and shop stewards had come to stay and some way must
A04 175 be found to integrate and co-ordinate their activities in official
A04 176 negotiating machinery.
A04 177    |^The General Council of the Trades Union Congress should therefore
A04 178 consider the matter. ^Consideration should also be given to the
A04 179 regrouping of unions and the modification of their structures to meet
A04 180 the growing concentration of capital.
A04 181 *<*4Common benefits*>
A04 182    |^*0\0Mr. Cooper argued that a common industrial contribution was
A04 183 urgent*- particularly in unions serving workers in the same industry*-
A04 184 along with common benefits paid during strikes and lock-outs.
A04 185    |^Suggesting that a total {0T.U.C.} membership of eight million
A04 186 was a *"poor show**" compared with some countries, he argued that the
A04 187 position needed examination.
A04 188 *<*6*'TAKE POLARIS AWAY**' LETTER*>
A04 189 *<*5Russell plea to President*>
A04 190 *<*4Daily Worker Reporter*>
A04 191    |^B*2EFORE *0President Kennedy met \0Mr. Macmillan yesterday
A04 192 morning he was given the views of a wide section of the British people
A04 193 about Polaris submarine bases in this country.
A04 194    |^An open letter written by Earl Russell hoping that the
A04 195 President's visit to London *"will prove fruitful**" was handed in at
A04 196 the American Embassy by representatives of the Committee of 100.
A04 197    |^Earl Russell, President of the Committee of 100, told Kennedy
A04 198 that he should take notice of *"that very large and growing section
A04 199 which is opposed to the establishment of a Polaris base, whether at
A04 200 Holy Loch or elsewhere on British territory.**"
A04 201    |^He pointed out that already there have been protests but that
A04 202 *"very much larger protests are to be expected and are being
A04 203 planned.**"
A04 204    |^There are three kinds of reasons that justify the protests and
A04 205 these should carry weight with the {0U.S.} Government, Earl Russell
A04 206 suggested.
A04 207    |^*"The first of these reasons is the importance of preserving the
A04 208 hitherto cordial relations between the {0U.S.} and Great Britain,
A04 209 not only in Government circles, but in public opinion.**"
A04 210    |^Earl Russell says it is inevitable, though profoundly
A04 211 regrettable, that the agitation against the Polaris base has generated
A04 212 some antagonism to the policy of the United States.
A04 213    |^The second reason is concerned with doubts as to the safety of
A04 214 the people of Great Britain; *"in a time of crisis it would probably
A04 215 be impossible for the British authorities to exercise any degree of
A04 216 control over the action of Polaris submarines.**"
A04 217 *<*7IN AN HOUR*>
A04 218    |^*0He argues that there is a distinct possibility that so long as
A04 219 there is a Polaris base in Britain the Soviet Union might retaliate
A04 220 against Britain alone.
A04 221    |^*"Such retaliation might, and probably would, destroy the whole
A04 222 population of Britain in the course of, at the most, an hour**"
A04 223 without provoking American retaliation.
A04 224    |^Earl Russell believes: ^*"It is very questionable whether British
A04 225 membership of Nato and British permission of American bases on our
A04 226 territory add anything to the strength of America, while, on the
A04 227 contrary, they impose upon America an onerous obligation which it may
A04 228 prove impossible to fulfil.**"
A04 229    |^The third reason is that the supreme interest for the whole
A04 230 world*- East and West and uncommitted nations*- is the prevention of
A04 231 nuclear war.
A04 232    |^*"A rapidly growing body of opinion in this country believes that
A04 233 Britain could be more effective in preventing a nuclear war as a
A04 234 neutral by helping to suggest agreements which could be accepted by
A04 235 both East and West.**"

A05   6 *<*5Daily Telegraph Political Correspondent*>
A05   7    |^*4T*2HE *0next White Paper on defence, to be published in March,
A05   8 is likely to contain a five-year plan for the three Services. ^Its aim
A05   9 will be to produce superbly equipped, all-Regular forces of about
A05  10 400,000 men.
A05  11    |^The three Services would be *"integrated**" to a greater extent
A05  12 than ever before. ^Short of wearing the same uniform, which is not
A05  13 contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force would become, for
A05  14 practical purposes, a single defence force.
A05  15    |^There would be complete co-operation at all levels in training
A05  16 and operations. ^This would apply also in the command structure and
A05  17 central administrative organisation.
A05  18    |^\0Mr. Watkinson, Minister of Defence, has been working on the
A05  19 plan for some months, with the Prime Minister's approval. ^He has had
A05  20 numerous meetings with the Service Ministers.
A05  21    |^He has also had talks with the Earl of Home, Foreign Secretary,
A05  22 and with other Ministers concerned with overseas aspects of defence
A05  23 policy.
A05  24 *<*6VOLUNTARY FORCES*>
A05  25 *<*4Recruiting Confidence*>
A05  26    |^*0Details of the scheme are now being worked out by the Chiefs of
A05  27 Staff, a process that may take four or five months. ^The scheme will
A05  28 be subject to Cabinet approval.
A05  29    |^\0Mr. Watkinson remains convinced that the policy initiated in
A05  30 1957, in \0Mr. Sandys's time as Minister of Defence, is still correct.
A05  31 ^This was to return to the tradition of all-Regular voluntary forces,
A05  32 with the last National Serviceman out of uniform by the end of 1962.
A05  33    |^The Minister regards the recent trend of recruiting figures as
A05  34 encouraging. ^He is confident the aim can be achieved.
A05  35    |^While the possibility of an eventual return to National Service
A05  36 in some form cannot be entirely discounted, he does not agree that the
A05  37 point has been reached where this need even be considered.
A05  38 *<*6SERVICE CHIEFS*>
A05  39 *<*4No Question of Dispute*>
A05  40    |^*0If National Service is ever resorted to, engagement would
A05  41 probably have to be for three years. ^It is thought this would be the
A05  42 minimum necessary for the extended training modern arms require and to
A05  43 enable each man to serve at least a year overseas.
A05  44    |^There is no truth in suggestions that \0Mr. Watkinson is at odds
A05  45 with the Service chiefs over the decision to dispense with National
A05  46 Service, or over any other aspect of defence policy.
A05  47    |^Criticisms about Army manpower appear to have come mainly from
A05  48 retired officers who have held high positions but are out of touch
A05  49 with the existing situation.
A05  50    |^\0Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support from the
A05  51 {0C.I.G.S.}, Field-Marshal Sir Francis Festing, who believes
A05  52 completely in the principle of an all-Regular army. ^\0Gen. Sir
A05  53 Richard Hull, who is to succeed Sir Francis, is equally convinced
A05  54 \0Mr. Watkinson is right.
A05  55 *<*6COMMAND CHANGE*>
A05  56 *<*4Delay Due to Berlin*>
A05  57    |^*0Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard as from \0Nov. 1.
A05  58 ^The hand-over, due in September, was delayed because of the Berlin
A05  59 crisis.
A05  60    |^\0Mr. Watkinson and his advisers felt the change would be unwise
A05  61 at a moment when attention had to be concentrated on possible need for
A05  62 important military operations.
A05  63    |^For this reason Sir Francis stayed on, and sacrificed his leave.
A05  64 ^Now that the Berlin situation seems more stable, it is felt he can
A05  65 relinquish his duties.
A05  66    |^As a field-marshal, he remains on the Active List. ^He may be
A05  67 asked to take another important post.

A05  76    |^There was a computed 8.4 per \0cent. swing towards the

A05  78 the disappearance of the Progressive party from the House.
A05  79    |^Early results in yesterday's general election showed Nationalists

A05  88 the United party candidate, \0Mr. Plewman, left the Progressives
A05  89 deprived of both their chief figures.
A05  90    |^\0Dr. Verwoerd and the Leader of the Opposition, Sir \de Villiers
A05  91 Graaff, have been returned unopposed. ^The contests were for 86 seats
A05  92 as 70 Nationalists and 20 United party candidates are unopposed.
A05  93    |^Long before polling closed at 8 {0p.m.} it was evident that
A05  94 voters were bored by the Government's frequent appeals to the
A05  95 electorate.
A05  96    |^The election was the fourth in four years. ^In most

A05  99 *<*6MOBILISATION IF NECESSARY, SAYS PREMIER*>
A05 100 *<*2FRESH CHECK ON FALL-OUT ORDERED*>
A05 101    |^*4T*2HE *0Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons last night that
A05 102 he had considered early in the Parliamentary recess whether to
A05 103 mobilise reserves necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on
A05 104 to a war footing. ^He decided that it would be a great error to do so
A05 105 and to recall Parliament.
A05 106    |^But there would be no hesitation in mobilising if a further
A05 107 deterioration in the situation warranted such a step. ^It would have
A05 108 to be accompanied by other measures of a military, economic and
A05 109 political kind.
A05 110    |^\0Mr. Macmillan, who was winding up the foreign affairs debate,
A05 111 said the Government could not be party to accepting as a matter of
A05 112 principle the imposed division of Germany. ^*"We must not be rattled
A05 113 into surrender, but we must not*- and I am not*- be **[SIC**] afraid
A05 114 of negotiation.**"
A05 115    |^\0Mr. Godber, Minister of State, Foreign Office, said earlier
A05 116 that the Government had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess
A05 117 the fall-out position in view of the Russian tests. ^The Council's

A05 122 friends and foes alike, the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony Eden,
A05 123 in his maiden speech in the House of Lords last night, gave a warning
A05 124 that appeasement over Berlin could only lead to war.
A05 125    |^To stand firm, he declared, was not to invite war, but the surest

A05 137    |^It was the end of a rather curious speech in which \0Mr.
A05 138 Macmillan wound up the two-day debate on foreign affairs. ^He began in
A05 139 a low, almost chatty monotone, and his voice never rose to any accent
A05 140 of urgency.
A05 141    |^He passed in rapid review the United Nations Secretariat; nuclear
A05 142 tests; the canard about British interference with the United Nations
A05 143 in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East Asia.
A05 144    |^He spent most of his short half-hour on Berlin. ^He deplored the

A05 151 irrevocable division of Germany.
A05 152    |^Britain could not be a party to an imposed division. ^But
A05 153 negotiation, as the debate had shown, could be undertaken on a variety
A05 154 of bases.
A05 155    |^\0Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliberately refrained
A05 156 during the summer from recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
A05 157 by proclamation, such as would be necessary to bring the British Army
A05 158 of the Rhine on to a fully active footing.
A05 159    |^That would have created a thoroughly undesirable atmosphere of
A05 160 panic. ^He thought that the situation was rather more hopeful.
A05 161    |^The Russians now realised its seriousness. ^The French doubts
A05 162 were more about procedure than about substance.
A05 163    |^The Prime Minister's attitude of studied calm brought down the
A05 164 temperature of the debate, which never at any time rose to fever
A05 165 pitch, to a remarkable degree of sub-normality.
A05 166    |^Throughout \0Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl of Home, Foreign
A05 167 Secretary, was listening in the Peers' Gallery.
A05 168    |^The early speakers in the debate each severely rated the speech
A05 169 of his predecessor. ^These strictures were all too well justified.
A05 170    |^We started with the plaintive wailings of \0Mr. Healey,
A05 171 *"Shadow**" Foreign Secretary, described by \0Mr. Godber, Minister of
A05 172 State, Foreign Office, as *"pedantic and obscure on Berlin, damaging
A05 173 and obscure on the Congo.**"
A05 174    |^In turn, \0Mr. Godber was censured by \0Mr. Shinwell, former
A05 175 Labour Defence Minister, for having read the House an ill-prepared
A05 176 essay.
A05 177 *<*6TOO WIDE A RANGE*>
A05 178 *<*4Free-for-All*>
A05 179    |^*0The trouble about such debates is that they range too widely.
A05 180 ^They remind one of the Rugby match in *"Tom Brown's Schooldays,**" in
A05 181 which all the boys were welcome to take part, and only those who
A05 182 *"really meant business**" removed their jackets.
A05 183    |^Not many metaphorical braces were visible in the early stages of
A05 184 to-night's debate. ^\0Mr. Healey had another tilt at the Prime
A05 185 Minister's golf-course Press conference, which he described as *"a
A05 186 display of flabby and fatuous complacency which takes us straight back
A05 187 to Neville Chamberlain.**"
A05 188    |^A reference to the reunification of Germany brought a bark of
A05 189 ~*"Start another war!**" from \0Mr. Ellis Smith (\0Lab., Stoke on
A05 190 Trent \0S.). ^Then \0Mr. Healey launched out on his pet theme of
A05 191 limitation of armaments in Europe.
A05 192    |^This could, he suggested, be linked with prohibition of the
A05 193 production of atomic weapons in any part of Europe. ^Inspection and
A05 194 control would be much easier to establish in these territories.
A05 195    |^\0Mr. Healey denounced the Government for using double standards.
A05 196 ^Ministers had rebuked the unaligned nations for not condemning the
A05 197 new Russian tests, but they themselves had no condemnation for events
A05 198 in Angola or Algeria.
A05 199    |^It was not for the Government, said \0Mr. Healey, to take up
A05 200 moral attitudes, *"especially when the temple of their religion is the
A05 201 bingo-parlour.**" ^This puzzled such students of comparative religion
A05 202 as had failed to detect this cult.
A05 203    |^But \0Mr. Healey had a partial and limited success. ^He rallied
A05 204 behind him the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last night by his
A05 205 leader, \0Mr. Gaitskell.
A05 206 *<*6SCORN MERITED*>
A05 207 *<*4\0Mr. Godber's Speech*>
A05 208    |^*0\0Mr. Godber's performance merited all the mild scorn heaped on
A05 209 it by \0Mr. Shinwell. ^True, he did tell the House that the Government
A05 210 had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess the fall-out
A05 211 position in view of the Russian tests, and said that the council's
A05 212 findings would be published.
A05 213    |^He was not so happy in his defence of the Government's failure to
A05 214 condemn France for her nuclear tests in the Sahara on the grounds that
A05 215 they were only little ones. ^This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
A05 216 and her illegitimate baby.
A05 217    |^For the most part, \0Mr. Godber muttered his way through a
A05 218 cliche-ridden Foreign Office brief. ^He resembles the elephant seal,
A05 219 an otherwise endearing creature whose articulation is limited, we are
A05 220 told, to a series of heavy sighs.

A06   5    |^*6\0MR SELWYN LLOYD *4may speed up his plans to catch speculators
A06   6 in shares and property.
A06   7    |^*0The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to public opinion over
A06   8 his *"July Budget**" came dramatically in the Commons yesterday.
A06   9    |^\0Mr. Lloyd said on Tuesday that he proposed to deal in his next
A06  10 regular Budget with some profits which now escape tax.
A06  11    |^Sir Edward Boyle, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said
A06  12 yesterday that the Government does not like retrospective legislation.
A06  13    |^He went on to describe the kind of people the Chancellor hopes to
A06  14 tax.
A06  15    |^These are people buying and selling shares within a short period,
A06  16 those *"stagging**" on a new issue and property dealers who form a
A06  17 chain of companies and put one property deal through each.
A06  18    |^*4\0Mr. Harold Wilson, Shadow Chancellor, jumped up to offer the
A06  19 Government an easy passage for such legislation.
A06  20    |^*0*"Why don't you make proposals to legislate in the autumn?**"
A06  21 \0Mr. Wilson asked.
A06  22    |^*"We wouldn't call it an Autumn Budget. ^You can call it a
A06  23 Taxation Management Bill, if you like.**"
A06  24 *<*4Nodded*>
A06  25    |^*0While \0Mr. Wilson was speaking, the Prime Minister and \0Mr.
A06  26 Lloyd had a whispered conversation.
A06  27    |^*4They nodded at each other and Sir Edward rose to say that the
A06  28 Chancellor would bear \0Mr. Wilson's offer in mind.
A06  29    |^*1Guy Eden writes: ^*0Treasury experts are already working on the
A06  30 scheme.
A06  31    |^Profits of genuine investors in industry will not be affected,
A06  32 but only quick in-and-out speculator deals.
A06  33 *<*6FOULKES REFUSES SUICIDE*>
A06  34    |^*6FRANK FOULKES, *4Communist president of the {0ETU}, refused
A06  35 yesterday to *"commit suicide**" at the {0TUC}'s invitation.
A06  36    |^*4He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to
A06  37 the {0ETU}.
A06  38    |^*0In reply to the call for his resignation he said:
A06  39    |^*"Our rules say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to
A06  40 run again for three years.
A06  41    |^*4*"I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire, so this is an
A06  42 invitation from my good friends of the {0TUC} that I should commit
A06  43 hara-kiri.

A06  45 *<*4The terms*>
A06  46    |^*0The other {0TUC} demands:
A06  47    |^Five leading Communists must not hold office for five years;
A06  48    |^Sub-committees set up to strip secretary John Byrne of his powers
A06  49 must disband in ten days.
A06  50    |^*4These the {0ETU} executive rejected as *"wholly
A06  51 unacceptable**" and *"unwarranted interference.**"
A06  52    |^*0But it agreed to *4postpone*0 operation of the sub-committees.
A06  53    |^The union now lays itself open to suspension from the {0TUC}
A06  54 followed by expulsion. ^A {0TUC} committee will decide next month at
A06  55 a special meeting.

A06  57 *<*7BUT *5\0Mr. *7\0K SHOWS HIS TEETH*>
A06  58 *<WARLIKE FLOWS THE NEVA*>
A06  59    |^*6THE *4biggest naval show ever seen on the River Neva was staged
A06  60 yesterday by \0Mr. Kruschev as Russia read his promises of a Communist
A06  61 Utopia by 1980.
A06  62    |^*0Among the 60 ships were rocket-carrying craft ranging in size
A06  63 from torpedo-boats to cruisers, and submarines *"able to strike mighty
A06  64 blows,**" according to a {0TV} commentator.
A06  65    |^The small rocket craft, for destroying big ships, are controlled
A06  66 automatically, even to the preparations for launching their rockets.
A06  67 *<*4Red {0NATO}*>
A06  68    |^Applauding on the river banks at Leningrad were thousands now
A06  69 told that in 20 years they will have free food, housing, light, heat,
A06  70 transport and medical treatment*- all for a working week of 34 to 36
A06  71 hours.
A06  72    |^*0*"The whole naval might of the Soviet Union can be seen here*-
A06  73 a truly inspiring and proud sight,**" said Moscow radio's commentator.
A06  74    |^The parade was reviewed by Marshal Andrei Grechko, commanding the
A06  75 forces of the Warsaw Pact countries*- the Communist *"Nato.**"
A06  76    |^He said rocket-carrying atomic submarines now formed the basis of
A06  77 the Soviet Navy.

A06  79 *<*6LONE TORY {0MP} LASHES PREMIER*>
A06  80 *<*4By *2MICHAEL STEVENSON*>
A06  81    |^*6\0MR. MACMILLAN'S *4announcement in the Commons of his
A06  82 momentous decision to apply for membership of the Common Market
A06  83 provoked a violent personal attack by one*- just one*- of his
A06  84 backbenchers.
A06  85    |^*4\0Mr. Anthony Fell (Yarmouth) called the decision *"shocking**"
A06  86 and added:
A06  87    |^*0*"It is the most disastrous thing any Prime Minister has done
A06  88 for many, many generations.**"
A06  89 *<*6{0MP}*4s *6SHOCKED*>
A06  90    |^*4He concluded: ^*"The best service the Prime Minister can do
A06  91 would be to resign.**"
A06  92    |^*0The outburst shocked {0MP}s of all parties.
A06  93    |^Even close friends were signalling \0Mr. Fell to stop.
A06  94    |^There were loud cries of *"shame**" from all parts of the
A06  95 Conservative side.
A06  96    |^*4\0Mr. Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat down.
A06  97    |^*0A few minutes later, \0Mr. Fell got up and left the chamber.
A06  98    |^He returned five minutes later to stand just inside the doorway
A06  99 looking more composed.
A06 100    |^In the middle of the amazing scene, \0Mr. Macmillan waved his
A06 101 hand at \0Mr. Fell.
A06 102    |^This seemed to infuriate \0Mr. Fell even more.
A06 103    |^*4*"I cannot be told to sit down *0by the Prime Minister.**"
A06 104    |^Protests had been expected from Tory rebels. ^But \0Mr. Fell's
A06 105 attack was unprecedented.
A06 106    |^He accused the Prime Minister of *"political double talk.**"
A06 107 *<*6*'DISASTER**'*>
A06 108    |^*0*"It had the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks
A06 109 this Prime Minister is a national disaster,**" he said.
A06 110    |^Most {0MP}s agreed that \0Mr. Fell's attack had, if anything,
A06 111 rallied support to the Prime Minister.
A06 112    |^This apparently, was \0Mr. Macmillan's assessment.
A06 113    |^He confined his reply to the observation that \0Mr. Fell had
A06 114 probably *"maximised his support.**"
A06 115    |^There were no other attacks of such ferocity.
A06 116    |^*4But there was ample evidence of Conservative and Labour
A06 117 opposition, which will be aired in the debate tomorrow and on
A06 118 Thursday.
A06 119    |^*0As \0Mr. Macmillan made his announcement, the House was
A06 120 crowded.
A06 121    |^*4He said: *"^No British Government could join the European
A06 122 Economic Community without prior negotiation with a view to meeting
A06 123 the needs of the Commonwealth countries, of our European Free Trade
A06 124 Association partners and of British agriculture.**"
A06 125 *<*6*'IT'S RIGHT**'*>
A06 126    |^*0Near the end of a long statement, \0Mr. Macmillan stated the
A06 127 Government's intention:
A06 128    |^*"After long and earnest consideration, Her Majesty's Government
A06 129 have come to the conclusion that it would be right for Britain to make
A06 130 a formal application.. for negotiations with a view to joining the
A06 131 Community.**"
A06 132    |^At this point, \0Mr. Paul Williams (\0Cons., Sunderland) called
A06 133 out ^*"Shame.**"
A06 134    |^\0Mr. Williams is a close associate of \0Mr. Fell.
A06 135    |^\0Mr. Macmillan said, if negotiations were brought to a
A06 136 conclusion, there would be consultation with Commonwealth countries
A06 137 before the matter was put to the Commons.
A06 138 *<*6MAC SEES EUROPE A COMMONWEALTH*>
A06 139 *<*4By *6MICHAEL STEVENSON*>
A06 140    |^*6\0MR. MACMILLAN *4yesterday looked forward to a Commonwealth*-
A06 141 of Europe.
A06 142    |^*0This was his vision of the Western Europe which he hopes
A06 143 Britain can join through the Common Market.
A06 144    |^*4But \0Mr. Macmillan rejected a suggestion that Britain would
A06 145 lose its identity in some future political merger.
A06 146    |^*0*"The concept of a federal system, like the United States, was
A06 147 unreal,**" he said.
A06 148    |^*"Europe is too old, too diverse in tradition, language and
A06 149 institutions, for that.**"
A06 150 *<*4In tune*>
A06 151    |^*0But a Commonwealth of Europe was much more in tune with their
A06 152 national traditions and ours.
A06 153    |^The Premier was opening a two-day debate in the Commons on the
A06 154 Common Market.
A06 155    |^He claimed that, unless we were in the Common Market, we should
A06 156 not be able to play any part in determining its future.
A06 157    |^*4*"We can lead better from within,**" he said.
A06 158    |^*0\0Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection raised by Tory
A06 159 critics.
A06 160    |^\0Mr. Anthony Fell, who created a scene on this point on Monday,
A06 161 took up a position almost hidden behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair.
A06 162 *<*4Tribute*>
A06 163    |^*0\0Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help to the Commonwealth
A06 164 through the strength we would gain in the Common Market than by
A06 165 isolation.
A06 166    |^He paid tribute to the development of the Common Market.
A06 167    |^*4*"The Community (Common Market) has imparted an impetus and an
A06 168 economic growth to The Six. ^Above all, it is an idea which has
A06 169 gripped men's minds,**" he said.
A06 170    |^*0Referring to previous negotiations, \0Mr. Macmillan looked
A06 171 towards \0Mr. Reginald Maudling.
A06 172    |^*"These were negotiations in which the President of the Board of
A06 173 Trade played a conspicuous part,**" the Premier said.
A06 174    |^*4He dismissed the idea that Britain would be swamped by cheap
A06 175 labour.
A06 176    |^*0Our industry, he said, would probably gain.
A06 177    |^*"Many people feel we have had, perhaps, too much shelter,**" he
A06 178 went on.
A06 179    |^*"We cannot draw up a precise balance-sheet for our industry.**"
A06 180    |^But the balance of advantage probably lay in the size of markets
A06 181 which would be available*- something comparable to the United States
A06 182 or Russia.
A06 183    |^\0Mr. Hugh Gaitskell argued that no final decision should be
A06 184 taken until a conference of Commonwealth Premiers had been held.
A06 185    |^*4Conservatives protested when \0Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
A06 186 told in Europe last weekend that we were looked upon as a liability.
A06 187    |^*0He had been told this *"by some people of considerable
A06 188 authority,**" he retorted.
A06 189    |^*"I agree with the Prime Minister that I do not think we are
A06 190 necessarily bound for federalism in Europe,**" he went on.
A06 191 *<*4Tariffs*>
A06 192    |^*0If we joined the Common Market, our food subsidies would
A06 193 probably be replaced by a system of tariffs.
A06 194    |^*"That will mean a rise in the cost of living.**"
A06 195 *<*6YES, IT'S A GOLD RUSH, SELWYN*>
A06 196    |^*6BUDGETTE *4or no Budgette *6YOU *4are spending more as the
A06 197 summer holiday season moves into top gear.
A06 198    |^*0On the eve of August Bank Holiday the spending spree is at a
A06 199 new all-time peak.
A06 200    |^Note circulation soared for the sixth successive week*- this time
A06 201 by more than *+15,000,000 last week.
A06 202    |^*4And that brought the figure to a record *+2,415,000,000.
A06 203    |^*0This was *+100,000,000 more than the corresponding week last
A06 204 year and *+37,000,000 up on the 1960 record set last Christmas.
A06 205    |^*1Now look at the other side of all these coins.
A06 206    |^*0The big *"squeeze**" means that it is going to be more
A06 207 difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft.
A06 208    |^*4And banks will be stricter in recalling existing overdrafts.
A06 209    |^*0This is underlined in the Central Bank's weekly return...
A06 210    |...which shows that more than *+163,000,000 of the banks' money is
A06 211 now frozen in the form of special deposits with the Bank of England.
A06 212    |^*4Banks have paid in a first instalment of almost *+8,000,000 in
A06 213 response to the Budgette appeal.
A06 214    |^*0About another *+70,000,000 is due by September 20. ^For nearly
A06 215 a year about *+150,000,000 has been frozen.

A06 221 published in Moscow yesterday. ^They tell:

A06 236    |^With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to
A06 237 self-determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence.
A06 238    |^*6WEST GERMANY*4*- ^Russia would like to see a clear realization
A06 239 that West Germany would not survive even a few hours of a third world
A06 240 war.
A06 241    |^The best way to rule out such a tragic contingency would be to
A06 242 sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous growth of West Berlin's
A06 243 occupation status.
A06 244    |^Behind Bonn's slogan of German self-determination is the

A07  13    |^Also, there is little doubt that he has a brighter turn of
A07  14 finishing speed than Dandy Scot, who only held on to second place in
A07  15 the Rhymney Breweries 'Chase through his own indomitable courage and
A07  16 the relentless driving of his jockey.
A07  17 *<*6GOOD FORM*>
A07  18    |^*0Limonalt, brought down by Chavara when well to the fore at
A07  19 Cheltenham last month, earlier beat Frenchman's Cove here*- form that
A07  20 looked all the better when the runner-up went on to trounce Mandarin
A07  21 at Kempton.
A07  22    |^Limonalt is nothing to look at but is tough and game, and will
A07  23 stay this trip well.
A07  24 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
A07  25    |^He is suggested as the best each-way long-shot and, together with
A07  26 Dandy Scot, the danger to Team Spirit (2.35 nap).
A07  27 **[END INDENTATION**]
A07  28    |^Even if he fails on Dandy Scot, Fred Winter is unquestionably the
A07  29 jockey to follow. ^He should score on Flame Gun (1.30), Some Alibi
A07  30 (3.5), and Tovaritch (3.30).
A07  31    |^Blinkers made all the difference to Tovaritch at Hurst Park and,
A07  32 similarly equipped today, he looks much too good for his Village
A07  33 Hurdle rivals.
A07  34    |^Best of the opposition may be Chinese Pintall, favourably noted
A07  35 when sixth, running-on, behind Luminarch here last month.
A07  36    |^Flame Gun, unbeaten here, seems well suited to giving away lumps
A07  37 of weight in small fields such as he faces in the Londesborough
A07  38 'Chase.

A07  50    |^{Retour de Flamme} allies his always bright turn of speed to
A07  51 brilliant fencing, and he should be too strong at the finish for his
A07  52 rivals.

A07  72 at Newton Abbot.

A07 107 *<*4By *6CLIVE TOYE*>
A07 108    |^AN *4urgent peace move by the Ministry of Labour last night could
A07 109 stop Soccer's headlong flight into a strike. ^The Ministry have called
A07 110 the Football League and the players' leaders together for a conference
A07 111 in London next Wednesday*- 72 hours before the players' strike is due
A07 112 to begin.
A07 113    |^*0The conference could end in, at least, a postponement of the
A07 114 strike notices. ^For the players' leaders are keen to tell the League:
A07 115 ^*"We wish to negotiate on one of *2YOUR *0ideas*- an eased form of
A07 116 the retain and transfer system.**"
A07 117    |^This new system was suggested by the Football League management
A07 118 committee on December 29, accepted by the players, then rejected by
A07 119 the Football League club chairmen this week, causing the present
A07 120 crisis.
A07 121 *<*7*'FIRST-CLASS IDEA**'*>
A07 122    |^*0Players' leader Jimmy Hill said last night: ^*"It was an
A07 123 absolutely first-class idea by the League, and it would really work in
A07 124 practice.
A07 125    |^*"The League clubs feared this proposal because they thought it
A07 126 could rob them of too many players at one time. ^That isn't so.
A07 127    |^*"With new, longer contracts, a manager could sign some of his
A07 128 players for one year, some for two and some for three. ^At the end of
A07 129 any one season, only a small number of players would be in a position
A07 130 to ask for a move.**"
A07 131    |^League president Joe Richards said last night at his Barnsley
A07 132 home that he would go to next Wednesday's meeting *"if my presence
A07 133 means avoiding a strike.**"
A07 134    |^He added: ^*"But I am not going to waste time. ^I am not budging
A07 135 on the issue of the transfer system.**"
A07 136    |^The players now believe that, if it is necessary, the final
A07 137 instrument for the defeat of the Football League is the case of
A07 138 26-year-old former England B inside-forward Alfie Stokes.
A07 139 *<*7STRONG CASE*>
A07 140    |^*0Stokes is ready to take legal action against Fulham, his last
A07 141 League club, claiming they have no right to keep him out of League
A07 142 football.
A07 143    |^Stokes, the players have been advised, has an even stronger case
A07 144 against the League's present contract than George Eastham, the
A07 145 Newcastle star transferred to Arsenal after a long, bitter wrangle
A07 146 with Newcastle.
A07 147    |^Under the system suggested by the League management on December
A07 148 29, a player due to be offered a new contract by his club would be
A07 149 given details of his terms by May 19, accepting or refusing by May 31.
A07 150 ^If he refused to sign, the League would find him another club before
A07 151 June 30.
A07 152    |^If a player was not transferred by June 30, and his club wished
A07 153 to retain him, the club would have to pay him a minimum of *+15 a week
A07 154 until he was transferred.

A08   8    |^*6T*2HIS *0was harder work for Newport than the score suggests.
A08   9 ^Come rain, slime or mud*- and all were present at Rodney Parade*-
A08  10 Newport always try to retain their famous and spectacular technique of
A08  11 handling and backing-up. ^This time, however, it almost came unstuck,
A08  12 or rather stuck in the mud.
A08  13    |^True they scored two tries, but one was almost a gift. ^Their
A08  14 second penalty goal was in the same category, so that the margin of a
A08  15 goal, two penalty goals and a try to a goal was, on the whole,
A08  16 somewhat flattering.
A08  17    |^Oxford put up a splendid fight and none more so than their
A08  18 courageous captain, Willcox. ^His fielding, tackling and covering were
A08  19 a complete justification of his selection for England against Ireland.
A08  20    |^Oxford had their share in the open but, unlike Newport, could not
A08  21 combine as a team. ^So their movements were short as well as few and
A08  22 far between.
A08  23    |^The centres, after one or two tentative thrusts early on when the
A08  24 ground was not cut up, soon found they were reduced to kicking. ^This
A08  25 they did all too often straight to the opposition.
A08  26    |^In the circumstances, Brown, in place of Sharp at fly-half, was
A08  27 probably justified in preferring to kick rather than to set his line
A08  28 going over ground in which the lightest step made a deep imprint.
A08  29 *<*6EARLY RHYTHM*>
A08  30 *<*4Griffith's Poor Day*>
A08  31    |^*0Newport had no such qualms and swung at once into their
A08  32 handling rhythm. ^But Griffiths, at fly-half, had a bad day. ^He
A08  33 dropped many passes and even those that came well to hand. ^However,
A08  34 within the first few minutes, a break by Britton in his own half led
A08  35 to handling by more than half the side and ended with Ford dropping
A08  36 the ball with Wills waiting for the scoring pass.
A08  37    |^Lewis soon kicked the first of his two penalty goals from the 25
A08  38 while Willcox failed with a similar shot. ^But the Oxford full-back
A08  39 redeemed himself immediately with a splendid tackle on Lewis.
A08  40    |^Just after half-time an unfortunate mistake by Oxford caused the
A08  41 first Newport try. ^Ware rushed in from the wing attempting to field a
A08  42 high punt in the centre of the field, which Willcox had well covered.
A08  43 ^They collided, neither secured the ball and, with the right-wing
A08  44 unguarded, Wills was able to collect and score. ^Lewis converted with
A08  45 a fine kick.
A08  46 *<*6LIGHTS ON*>
A08  47 *<*4Oxford Encouraged*>
A08  48    |^*0Oxford's best means of progress was by the boot and it was in
A08  49 this manner that they secured their only success. ^McPartlin and
A08  50 Stafford hacked the ball from halfway, Lewis fell and missed it and
A08  51 McPartlin went on to score, Willcox converting.
A08  52    |^The introduction of the white ball and floodlights gave Oxford
A08  53 encouragement. ^An interception by McPartlin almost led to another
A08  54 try. ^Griffiths caught him and Ware was only just held as he struggled
A08  55 with three Newport men clinging to him towards the line.
A08  56    |^However, Newport recovered their poise and a fine run by Jones
A08  57 brought another try. ^Willcox stopped him but Wills was there to make
A08  58 the touch-down. ^Lewis just missed the conversion but, when Roberts
A08  59 was caught off-side in front of the Oxford posts the Newport full-back
A08  60 added three more points with the last kick of the game.

A08  95 forward proved too much for the seamen and they lost by two goals and
A08  96 two tries to a try.
A08  97    |^A lack of determined defence in midfield and casual defensive
A08  98 covering allowed Swansea to score tries, but it was the greater
A08  99 experience and vigour of Swansea, with five internationals, which
A08 100 carried the day.
A08 101    |^After their good display against Newport the Navy failed to
A08 102 reproduce the same form. ^Although playing with the wind in the first
A08 103 half they were never able to control the play.
A08 104    |^At half-back Rodd was closely marked and his partner Francis did
A08 105 not have a happy match. ^Consequently the Navy threequarters saw
A08 106 little of the ball, although Tyrrell tried hard. ^Cormack was
A08 107 particularly sound at full-back. ^Thomas, Jones and Palmer were the
A08 108 best forwards.

A08 110 *<*4Williams Outstanding*>
A08 111    |^*0Swansea's front row of Williams, Gale and Lewis played strongly
A08 112 with Williams the outstanding forward on the field. ^Two new halves,
A08 113 Phillips and Lewis, showed promise, while Mainwaring was a powerful
A08 114 centre.
A08 115    |^Swansea took the lead after 33\0min when Navy passing broke down
A08 116 inside their own half. ^Harding booted through and followed up,
A08 117 beating Sinclair and Cormack, to score just short of the dead-ball
A08 118 line.
A08 119    |^The Navy replied with a try when Thomas robbed Harding after a
A08 120 line-out and ran through to send Rodd over from 25 yards.
A08 121    |^Early in the second half Swansea took the lead. ^\0E. Lewis went
A08 122 away from a scrum-five outside the Navy line and a long pass to Young
A08 123 enabled the centre to give Bebb a clear run-in. ^Mainwaring kicked a

A08 126 the Navy line for another try. ^After 15 minutes the Navy again

A08 138 *<*4Sporting Commentary*>
A08 139 *<*6HOCKEY*>
A08 140 *<*7JOHN CONROY OUT FOR THE SEASON*>
A08 141 *<*6BY OUR HOCKEY CORRESPONDENT*>
A08 142    |^O*2PPONENTS *0of England on the hockey field this season will no
A08 143 doubt breathe more freely at the news that John Conroy, the best
A08 144 inside-forward of his time and one of the best this country has ever
A08 145 had, is laid as firmly by the heels as a man can be outside prison.
A08 146 ^He is in hospital and there he will stay for the next three weeks to
A08 147 have a broken ankle bone pinned.
A08 148    |^After that prolonged rest will be necessary. ^Conroy is out for
A08 149 the season and the selectors have a problem on their hands in shaping
A08 150 the England attack, which will make the more senior members, such as
A08 151 \0Mr. Harry Lewis and \0Mr. {0H. L.} Holliwell, think back uneasily
A08 152 to the 1956-57 season.
A08 153    |^At that time Conroy was in Canada, where he had gone from
A08 154 Melbourne following the Olympic Games. ^In his absence England put
A08 155 into the field the most ill-assorted attack I can ever remember. ^In
A08 156 five internationals, ten forwards were selected, the line never played
A08 157 in the same order twice and England scored just three goals, losing to
A08 158 South Africa and Germany, beating Wales and Scotland and playing a
A08 159 goalless draw with Ireland.
A08 160    |^These facts and figures are the measure of the problem facing the
A08 161 selectors at this moment, with Conroy injured and two other likely
A08 162 candidates for the forward line, internationals {0N. M.} Forster and
A08 163 {0P. B.} Austen, not available. ^They are also the answer to those
A08 164 critics of Conroy who complained that he slowed up the attack.
A08 165    |^What they meant, of course, was that Conroy did not belong to the
A08 166 school that bash on regardless and hope for the best. ^{0R. D.}
A08 167 Smith, who played outside Conroy on both wings for England, always
A08 168 says that nobody else could place the ball so perfectly to create an
A08 169 opening.
A08 170    |^I am sure Smith is right. ^I am equally sure that more could and
A08 171 should have been made of Conroy's remarkable gift of ball-control by
A08 172 moulding the attack round him. ^That calls for a carefully planned
A08 173 programme of coaching and training, which in spite of the drive and
A08 174 enthusiasm of the former match secretary of the Hockey Association,
A08 175 \0Mr. {0L. S. E.} Jones, has never so far been achieved.
A08 176 *<*4Lessons from Abroad*>
A08 177    |^*0In this respect England, and the other home countries, too, lag
A08 178 behind what is common practice on the Continent. ^There it is accepted
A08 179 that natural talent is not enough and a man must be taught the finer
A08 180 points of a team game as scientific as football and twice as fast.
A08 181    |^Nothing is left to chance that careful preparation can obviate
A08 182 and in some cases professional coaches of Indian origin have been
A08 183 employed.
A08 184    |^Without going as far as that England have for some time had a
A08 185 national team coach in {0S. D.} Dickins whose methods have made
A08 186 Hounslow one of the most successful club sides in the country over the
A08 187 last ten years. ^Unhappily, Dickins has not so far enjoyed the
A08 188 financial and administrative backing that a coach must have if he is
A08 189 to produce results.
A08 190 *<*6TURN OF THE TIDE?*>
A08 191 *<*4Holland Match Preparation*>
A08 192    |^*0There are, however, some signs that the sting of many defeats
A08 193 suffered at the hands of Continental countries since the war is slowly
A08 194 creating its own antidote. ^Plans are afoot, I gather, for a training
A08 195 programme during the summer aimed at producing an England team to play
A08 196 Holland in the autumn, a team which will do justice to a match marking
A08 197 the 75th anniversary of the Hockey Association.
A08 198    |^The idea is to get the probable players and reserves together for
A08 199 two full week-ends of coaching and training, to include a trial and
A08 200 wind up with a match which would be a dress rehearsal for the Holland
A08 201 fixture in October.
A08 202    |^This is good news. ^England have not beaten Holland in the five
A08 203 matches played since the war. ^It is time the tide was turned.
A08 204 *<*6WELCOME EXPERIMENT*>
A08 205 *<*4Penalty-shot Proposal*>
A08 206    |^*0An experiment which all ranks in the game are likely to have on
A08 207 their hands next season concerns the penalty bully which has been
A08 208 under fire for some time, mainly on the ground that it is not severe
A08 209 enough on the offending team. ^So far no one has produced an
A08 210 acceptable alternative.
A08 211    |^Now, however, the International Federation are to propose to the
A08 212 International Hockey Board, the body which makes the rules, that a
A08 213 penalty shot at goal be substituted for the penalty bully.
A08 214    |^This, it seems, would be a flick or push shot, not a hit, and the
A08 215 ball would have to be kept below shoulder height. ^But many details
A08 216 are still under discussion, such as the distance from which the shot
A08 217 should be taken.
A08 218    |^The proposal is due to come before the {0IHB} next May. ^Until
A08 219 more is known of the details, judgment must be reserved, but the
A08 220 initiative is to be welcomed.

A09   5 judge, is setting out on Circuit on April 15 despite the pleas of his
A09   6 wife, *4Lady Diplock. ^*0Circuit, I should add, is the name of his
A09   7 trusted mount in the Bar point-to-point.
A09   8    |^And Sir Kenneth Diplock, who has ridden in it*- and lost*- as a
A09   9 {0Q.C.}, will be taking part for the first time as a High Court
A09  10 judge.
A09  11    |^His wife views the undertaking with some trepidation.
A09  12    |^At their home in the Temple last night she told me: ^*"Circuit is
A09  13 getting old and though my husband rides him every week with the
A09  14 Cottesmore Hunt I do hope he will not ride him next month.
A09  15    |^*"I don't want him to get hurt again.**"
A09  16    |^But no doubt Lady Diplock recalls an accident in 1957 when her
A09  17 husband's horse fell and he was badly thrown. ^His arm was broken and
A09  18 later he presided at the Old Bailey with his arm in a sling, hidden
A09  19 under his robes.
A09  20    |^Actually, for any young barrister who wants to have a few modest
A09  21 shillings on the judge, I am told he is a brilliant rider.

A09  31    |^*6CHARMIAN SCOTT, *018-year-old niece of the *4Duchess of
A09  32 Gloucester, *0returned to modelling yesterday for the first time since
A09  33 the car accident that put her in hospital four weeks ago.
A09  34    |^A fast disappearing scar on her left leg, and a slightly
A09  35 discoloured eye*- well-camouflaged by make-up*- were the only visible
A09  36 reminders of the accident, which occurred when a car in which she was
A09  37 travelling overturned at Hyde Park Corner.
A09  38    |^*"I still have one or two other bruises,**" said Miss Scott,
A09  39 *"but fortunately they can't be seen by the public.**"
A09  40    |^She was appearing in a fashion show put on by a Piccadilly firm
A09  41 in a Park-lane hotel. ^Among those watching her were her mother,
A09  42 *4Lady George Scott, *0and her elder sister, *4Georgina, *0who is a
A09  43 sales-girl for the firm.
A09  44    |^Georgina does not envy her sister's much photographed fame.
A09  45    |^*"I'm honest with myself,**" she said with a smile. ^*"I know
A09  46 perfectly well that I haven't got the shape for modelling. ^So I just

A09  53    |^Said a spokesman for the ambassador yesterday: ^*"They usually
A09  54 take their winter holidays separately. ^No special significance in
A09  55 that.
A09  56    |^*"The ambassador seems to prefer Italy to Austria. ^I suppose it

A09  59    |^*6DOROTHY, LADY BRUNTISFIELD, *0who left England to farm in Kenya
A09  60 10 years ago, has returned to this country. ^She has bought a house in
A09  61 Belgravia, and hopes to move in after Easter.

A09  63 of freedom, wonderful climate and no restrictions.**" ^She remained on
A09  64 her farm*- a lone white woman*- throughout the Mau Mau troubles.
A09  65    |^*"I was frightened, of course*- who wouldn't be?*- but there was
A09  66 something worth fighting for,**" she told me yesterday.
A09  67    |^*"Things are different now. ^We have been let down. ^And with all
A09  68 these African politicians making trouble it might blow up into another
A09  69 Congo any day.**"
A09  70    |^Lady Bruntisfield*- first wife of *4Lord Bruntisfield*- *0sold
A09  71 everything before leaving Kenya.

A09  75 *<*7DRAWBACK*>
A09  76    |^*6KATHARINE WORSLEY, *0the *4Duke of Kent's *0fiance*?2e, made
A09  77 her first public appearance with *4the Queen *0in a theatre outing
A09  78 last night.
A09  79    |^And unwittingly, poor girl, she committed a minor social sin.
A09  80 ^Her deep red dress, I'm told by the women with an eye for these
A09  81 things, clashed with the Queen's black and plum sequined dress.
A09  82    |^She also discovered one of the drawbacks of royal protocol: she
A09  83 wasn't able to sit with her fiance*?2. ^The Duchess of Kent sat
A09  84 between them.

A09  89 *<*7OLD BOYS*>
A09  90    |^*4O*2NE *0of London's odder reunions took place last night.
A09  91 ^*4Herr Reinhold Eggers, *0a former German schoolmaster who was the
A09  92 security officer at Colditz Castle, the camp for important prisoners
A09  93 of war, met up with some of his *"old boys.**"
A09  94    |^He had dinner with *4Group Captain Douglas Bader *0at his London
A09  95 mews house. ^*"I had tea occasionally with him at Colditz,**" said
A09  96 Herr Eggers urbanely. ^*"I always admired his spirit.**"
A09  97    |^Earlier I had joined him and *4Pat Reid, *0the British escape
A09  98 officer at Colditz, for a drink in a Knightsbridge pub.
A09  99    |^Herr Eggers has a sense of humour but has never, apparently, lost
A09 100 his schoolmasterly sense of pained surprise that his *"boys**" did not
A09 101 abide by the rules.
A09 102    |^*"Now Reid,**" he said, *"was one of my biggest headaches. ^When
A09 103 he escaped I was hauled over the coals and almost wished I had escaped
A09 104 with him.**"
A09 105    |^The habit of Reid's which Eggers found most infuriating was when
A09 106 he sat in his punishment cell blowing derisive blasts of his trumpet
A09 107 during roll call.
A09 108    |^*"I can't understand *4Lord Harewood's *0interest in music after
A09 109 Reid's performance.**"

A09 115 heaths of Newmarket for the kitchens of the officers' club at
A09 116 Catterick Camp.
A09 117    |^She lives in as a *+6 10{0s}-a-week assistant cook, preparing
A09 118 lunch and dinner for the officers.
A09 119    |^Vanessa, who two years ago was to be seen dancing with *4\0Mr.
A09 120 Martin Parsons, *0half-brother of *4\0Mr. Antony Armstrong-Jones,
A09 121 *0tells me: ^*"I got tired of riding horses and wanted a change. ^And

A09 126 gentleman in baggy tweeds finished his game with an adroit smash which
A09 127 landed the ball smack in the face of his 16-year-old shop-assistant
A09 128 opponent.
A09 129    |^The *4Duke of Norfolk, *0Earl Marshal of England, in slightly
A09 130 unaccustomed surroundings, was opening a new coffee bar at the Arundel
A09 131 youth club last night.
A09 132    |^The club has 80 members and two rules: no credit and no obscene
A09 133 language. ^And since the duke is the landlord of the building (rent
A09 134 1\0s. a year) he was the obvious choice as guest of honour.
A09 135    |^The duke obviously enjoyed his table tennis ~(*"We have a table
A09 136 at the castle and I play with the children**"), but Presley left him
A09 137 unimpressed.
A09 138    |^*"I am a bit old,**" he explained almost apologetically, *"for
A09 139 that sort of thing.**"
A09 140 *<*4Princess's new house gets *+70,000 refit*>

A09 152 built about 1690. ^The front door leads out into the court, giving the
A09 153 couple far more privacy than they have at \0No. 10.
A09 154    |^It will take 18 months to put \0No. 1a in habitable order. ^It
A09 155 suffers from bomb damage, dry rot, bad plumbing, and inefficient
A09 156 heating.
A09 157    |^The money to be spent on Princess Margaret's new home is only a

A10  23 grandstand.
A10  24    |^Butlers and waitresses join in the second game along with those
A10  25 who have taken the boxes. ^They vie with each other to produce the
A10  26 most impressive lunch.
A10  27    |^This is more difficult than it may seem, for the Ascot caterers
A10  28 provide all the food. ^So it is the same for everyone*- from *4Charles
A10  29 Clore *0to the *4Maharanee of Baroda, *0from *4Lew Grade *0to *4Lord
A10  30 Cornwallis.
A10  31 *<*6PASS THE MUSTARD*>
A10  32    |^*0Yesterday it was melon and smoked salmon and lobster or a cold
A10  33 collation (pronounced coalition by at least half the waitresses I
A10  34 spoke to) and strawberries and cream. ^Then there were wines to order.
A10  35 ^Most people had champagne*- of course.
A10  36    |^\0*4Mrs. John Valentine *0arrived from Sunbury-on-Thames
A10  37 clutching her cartwheel hat in one hand and a pot of mustard in the
A10  38 other. ^*"I always like my mustard made with sherry,**" she explained.
A10  39 ^She wasn't going to risk having the watered kind.
A10  40 *<*6HYLTON'S WINE*>
A10  41    |^*4Jack Hylton *0brought his own wine. ^A few doors down the
A10  42 corridor someone had brought a lace tablecloth to replace the damask
A10  43 ones provided.
A10  44    |^*4John Topliss-Smith *0came with a laundry hamper containing
A10  45 crab*- a present for his host. ^*"Everyone seems to have lobster,**"
A10  46 he said, *"but really crab is much nicer.
A10  47    |^*"The laundry basket? ^It's the done thing to carry food about in
A10  48 a hamper, isn't it? ^And I didn't actually have another hamper.**"
A10  49    |^On went the one-upmanship.
A10  50    |^Knowing something of the advantages of a good display, sales
A10  51 consultant *4Major Cyril Dennis *0had pink and white carnations sent
A10  52 down to Ascot to replace the sweet peas and cornflowers provided in
A10  53 each box.
A10  54    |^Before anyone arrived in Charles Clore's box part of the flower
A10  55 display had disappeared *"borrowed**" for another box.
A10  56    |^There was some swift china-changing, too. ^Someone slipped into
A10  57 *4Lord Moynihan's *0box and swapped a cracked plate for a sound one
A10  58 there. ^And since it was all regulation red and white Ascot crockery,
A10  59 no one could do much about it.
A10  60    |^*4George \0St. John Ervine *0arrived bearing a silver cigarette
A10  61 box. ^An impressive touch, this.
A10  62    |^*"I was asked to bring it along,**" he told me blandly, *"to make
A10  63 the place seem a bit more like home.
A10  64    |^*"After all, when you come to Ascot you don't want to feel you
A10  65 are picnicking, do you?**"
A10  66 *<*4And of course the family is delighted*>
A10  67    |^It was the happiest moment of Royal Ascot. ^The Queen's
A10  68 three-year-old filly Aiming High had won the Coronation Stakes*- her
A10  69 Majesty's first Ascot success since 1959.
A10  70    |^And the Royal Family, clearly delighted, went down to the
A10  71 unsaddling enclosure.
A10  72    |^All the more reason for celebration last night when the Queen
A10  73 gave her Ascot guests an evening out. ^They occupied the front two
A10  74 rows of Windsor's Theatre Royal balcony to see the new musical of
A10  75 *"Jane Eyre.**"
A10  76    |^Among the guests*- that eligible bachelor Nicholas Eden,
A10  77 30-year-old son of Sir Anthony. ^He sat next to Princess Alexandra.
A10  78    |^We're-all-human quote: ^During the interval the Queen was heard
A10  79 to ask: ^*"Please tell me, someone, has this got a happy or a sad
A10  80 ending? ^I quite forget.**"

A10  83 *<*6THE STATE VISIT OFF*- FOR *'HER STATE OF HEALTH**'*>
A10  84    |^I*2T *0is not altogether surprising that the Belgian royal family
A10  85 so often seems to find itself at loggerheads with its subjects.
A10  86    |^Even royal babies, usually a source of national rejoicing, seem
A10  87 to drive a wedge between *4King Baudouin *0and his people.
A10  88    |^There was that rumpus last week when the *4Pope *0let slip the
A10  89 news that *4Queen Fabiola *0is expecting a baby.
A10  90    |^But, despite the row, no official announcement followed.
A10  91    |^Yesterday the baby was (unofficially) in the news again. ^King
A10  92 Baudouin and his queen postponed next month's State visit to London.
A10  93 ^But nobody was prepared to admit (officially) that the baby was the
A10  94 reason.
A10  95    |^The king's counsellors couched their communique in vague terms.
A10  96 ^It merely said: ^*"The queen's state of health and the care it
A10  97 requires led King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola to express the wish that
A10  98 the visit be postponed.**"
A10  99    |^Not a word about the baby.
A10 100    |^I asked a Brussels palace spokesman if the queen's *"state of
A10 101 health**" meant what everybody knew it meant.
A10 102 *<*6NO NEWS*>
A10 103    |^*0*"Of course,**" he said, *"but we cannot say so officially. ^We
A10 104 can only refer to the queen's state of health.
A10 105    |^*"The fact that the queen is expecting a baby will not be
A10 106 official until an official announcement has been made.**"
A10 107    |^Even our own Queen did not mention the baby when she sent a
A10 108 telegram to King Baudouin. ^Taking its tone presumably from Brussels,
A10 109 it said simply: ^*"I and my husband are so sorry that we shall not be
A10 110 able to welcome your majesties to London in July.
A10 111    |^*"We hope soon to hear good news of Queen Fabiola's health and
A10 112 send you both our best wishes.**"
A10 113    |^In Belgium last night, Queen Fabiola's subjects were hoping that
A10 114 they, too, might hear some good news about her health. ^Well, some
A10 115 news, anyway...
A10 116 *<*6SURVIVAL*>
A10 117    |^*4Wilfred Noyce, *0mountaineer, writer and schoolmaster, who was
A10 118 in *4Sir John Hunt's *0Everest expedition in 1953, is giving up his
A10 119 job as an assistant master at Charterhouse, the Surrey public school,
A10 120 to concentrate on writing.
A10 121    |^His book *1South Col *0described the successful assault on
A10 122 Everest, and now, I understand, Heinemann will soon be publishing his
A10 123 latest mountaineering book. ^It deals with the Anglo-American
A10 124 Karakoram expedition which he led last year.
A10 125    |^The new life looks promising for \0Mr. Noyce.
A10 126    |^His wife, *4Rosemary, *0told me that Heinemann have also asked
A10 127 him to write a book on survival*- he published an article on the
A10 128 survivors of the Agadir earthquake in French Morocco last year*- and
A10 129 Nelson have commissioned him to edit an atlas of the world's mountain
A10 130 ranges.
A10 131    |^Another book, on survival in concentration camps, may follow
A10 132 later.
A10 133    |^Altogether, it looks as if the ex-schoolmaster will have no
A10 134 difficulty in surviving himself.
A10 135 *<*4Take your pick, says Stokowski*>
A10 136    |^T*2HAT *0former fire-eating conductor *4Leopold Stokowski *0is a
A10 137 mellowed man these days.
A10 138    |^In fact, when I talked to him yesterday after his rehearsals for
A10 139 Sunday's concert with the Philharmonia Orchestra, he told me of his
A10 140 remarkable experiment in orchestral democracy.
A10 141    |^Time was when this great disciplinarian of the rostrum*- as
A10 142 fierce as Toscanini in a rage*- had his own starch-like ideas about
A10 143 orchestral positioning.
A10 144    |^*1But this week he is allowing the Philharmonia players to decide
A10 145 for themselves where they sit.
A10 146    |^*0*"We try my way and then their way,**" said Stokowski. ^*"Then
A10 147 they will vote on it.
A10 148    |^*"If they decide that their way will give a better concert I
A10 149 shall just say ^*'{0O.K.}*- let's have the good concert.**'**"
A10 150    |^He shook his white head and insisted: ^*"But you know, on matters
A10 151 of intonation and the technicalities I am still more than a martinet*-
A10 152 I'm a martinetissimo!**"
A10 153    |^London-born Stokowski, now 79, has a reputation for highly
A10 154 individual interpretations. ^But he is quite prepared, these days, to
A10 155 be hissed by those who don't approve.
A10 156    |^As he says: ^*"If a man accepts applause when people like what he
A10 157 does he should be man enough to accept hissing from people who don't
A10 158 like it.**"

A11   2 *<*6TUDOR SURPRISE IN TREASURY OFFICE WORK*>
A11   3 *<30\0FT. LONG WALL AND TURRET*>
A11   4    |^*0Reconstruction work on the Treasury offices in Whitehall, which
A11   5 has been going on for some months behind masses of scaffolding on the
A11   6 street side and high wooden fences on Horse Guards Parade, has
A11   7 surprised the Ministry of Works by the amount of Tudor brickwork it
A11   8 has revealed.
A11   9    |^The most impressive discovery is a length of wall, 30\0ft. by
A11  10 16\0ft., roughly parallel with Whitehall, which includes a great stone
A11  11 window 20\0ft. high and 8\0ft. broad. ^This is part of the west wall
A11  12 of the great hall, later converted into a tennis court, which Henry
A11  13 *=8 built as an adjunct to Whitehall Palace for the recreation of his
A11  14 court. ^The north-west turret of the building, standing to a height of
A11  15 at least 40\0ft., has also been uncovered, its upper part faced with a
A11  16 decorative pattern of flint and stone.
A11  17 *<*6IRON REINFORCEMENT*>
A11  18    |^*0The east front of the hall, abutting on to Whitehall, was
A11  19 demolished by Sir Charles Barry when he rebuilt the Treasury offices
A11  20 in 1847, but he is credited now with unsuspected forbearance in having
A11  21 left so much of the west front on the park side. ^Indeed, the way in
A11  22 which Barry reinforced the floors with iron albeit at the expense of
A11  23 thrusting the iron into Tudor window arches*- is assumed by some
A11  24 experts to indicate that he was deliberately striving to preserve the
A11  25 west wall of Henry *=8's hall.
A11  26    |^Another, but smaller, tennis court which stood near the great
A11  27 hall was destroyed in the eighteenth century except for its north end
A11  28 wall. ^This wall has now been freed from the plaster that has covered
A11  29 it through the centuries. ^Today it stands to almost its full height,
A11  30 with its original windows, of which one, on the ground floor, retains
A11  31 its Tudor ironwork.
A11  32    |^A two-storeyed gallery, connecting the great hall and the smaller
A11  33 tennis court, was known to have survived all rebuilding operations in
A11  34 this part of Whitehall. ^But the stripping of its wall coverings has
A11  35 now revealed most of the original window openings and, incidentally,
A11  36 proved that some of the so-called Tudor windows incorporated in
A11  37 rebuilding operations were fakes. ^In the upper part of the gallery
A11  38 this is clearly demonstrated by a stone Tudor fireplace now uncovered
A11  39 being considerably out of the line of these sham Tudor windows.
A11  40 *<*6COCKPIT PASSAGE*>
A11  41    |^*0The lower part of the gallery*- it was known in former times as
A11  42 Cockpit Passage by reason of its leading to the long vanished Tudor
A11  43 cockpit*- has remained in fair shape though cluttered inordinately
A11  44 with pipes, cabling and all the modern apparatus of a basement given
A11  45 over to heating and lighting. ^Eventually it will be cleared of these
A11  46 things and tidied up to become once more a decent historical passage.
A11  47    |^When the present reconstruction is completed*- probably by
A11  48 August, 1962*- there will be incorporated in the new Treasury offices
A11  49 part of the wall of the Tudor hall and one of its great windows at the
A11  50 end of a series of corridors.
A11  51    |^The end wall of the small tennis court overlooks Treasury Green,
A11  52 in the middle of which stands a noble plane tree. ^When once again
A11  53 people are allowed to walk from Downing Street to Horse Guards Parade
A11  54 through Treasury Passage they will see the wall of the small tennis
A11  55 court and the exterior of Cockpit Passage.
A11  56    |^The original estimate for the reconstruction of the Treasury
A11  57 offices was *+750,000 but it is expected that that figure may be
A11  58 considerably exceeded.
A11  59 *<*6BENCH REJECT PLEA OVER HANDCUFFS*>
A11  60 *<FOUR MEN ACCUSED OF BANK ROBBERY*>
A11  61    |^*0Cardiff Magistrates yesterday rejected an application that two
A11  62 of four men in the dock should be allowed to have their hands free and
A11  63 not handcuffed to one another.
A11  64    |^The four men were charged jointly with breaking and entering
A11  65 Lloyds Bank in Cardiff between January 14 and January 16 and stealing
A11  66 *+9,465 and other property including watches and jewelry.
A11  67    |^Before the Court were: Colin David Baldwin, aged 26, of Braunton
A11  68 Avenue, Llanrumney, Cardiff; Albert Augustus King, aged 32, of
A11  69 Southmead, Bristol; Maurice Charles Harry, aged 32, of Northam Avenue,
A11  70 Llanrumney, Cardiff; and James Bernard Powell, aged 32, of Penarth
A11  71 Road, Cardiff.
A11  72 *<*6*'COURT HEAVILY GUARDED**'*>
A11  73    |^*0They were also jointly charged with stealing a car belonging to
A11  74 Herbert Arthur Peel at Bristol between January 1 and January 2.
A11  75    |^King and Baldwin were handcuffed together, with Harry on one side
A11  76 and Powell the other side.
A11  77    |^\0Mr. \0C. Stuart Hallinan, defending King, asked that the
A11  78 handcuffs should be removed. ^*"This court is very heavily guarded and
A11  79 King is prepared to give an undertaking that he will make no attempt
A11  80 to escape**", he said.
A11  81    |^\0Mr. \0K. Rees, for Baldwin, made a similar application.
A11  82    |^\0Mr. {0D. A.} Roberts Thomas, for the prosecution, opposing
A11  83 the application, said that when arrested King had stated that he would
A11  84 not be in custody for long. ^The two men ought to be held in restraint
A11  85 because of the danger of escape.
A11  86    |^\0Mr. Thomas said that entry to the strong room was gained by
A11  87 blowing a hole through the 18\0in. thick side wall. ^More than *+3,000
A11  88 had not been recovered. ^A fifth man, whose identity was known, was
A11  89 involved but not before the Court.
A11  90    |^The hearing was adjourned until today.
A11  91 *<*6THE CITY'S SHOPS CUT BY HALF SINCE 1939*>
A11  92 *<*"FIRM STAND BEING TAKEN WITH DEVELOPERS**"*>
A11  93    |^*0There has been a decrease of 53 per cent in the number of shops
A11  94 in the City of London since 1939 and 18 per cent in the number of
A11  95 restaurants, it was stated by counsel for the Corporation of London at
A11  96 an inquiry yesterday into an appeal heard by a Ministry of Housing and
A11  97 Local Government inspector. ^Winmor Properties \0Ltd. appealed against
A11  98 a condition imposed by the corporation that provision must be made for
A11  99 the incorporation of shops in at least two-thirds of the frontage in a
A11 100 project for rebuilding \0Nos. 35, 37 and 39, Moorgate as offices.
A11 101    |^\0Mr. {0S. M.} Haines, architect for the developers, said the
A11 102 building proposed would be of seven storeys with provision for a car
A11 103 park. ^If shops were incorporated in the development they would be
A11 104 small and spoil the building both architecturally and economically.
A11 105 ^The building was intended as an office block.
A11 106    |^\0Mr. {0W. J.} Glover, for the corporation, said it was the
A11 107 policy of the Town Planning Committee that existing shops and
A11 108 restaurants should be replaced in new development. ^\0Mr. {0H. A.}
A11 109 Meeland, planning officer to the corporation, said there had been a
A11 110 great tendency by developers to omit shops from their plans and the
A11 111 corporation were having to take a firm stand in the matter.
A11 112    |^The inquiry was concluded.

A11 116 *<TRING \0*0Feb. 21*>
A11 117    |^More than 100 local residents crowded into Church House here
A11 118 today to attend an auction sale at which the former Tring Isolation
A11 119 Hospital was finally knocked down to a London financial firm for
A11 120 *+7,600. ^It went to \0Mr. {0A. J.} Cruickshank, an estate agent of
A11 121 Berkhamsted, acting for Bland and Company (Investments) \0Ltd., of
A11 122 Wimpole Street, London.
A11 123    |^The final figure compares with a price of *+5,000 at which the
A11 124 buildings were originally offered to the council by the Ministry of
A11 125 Health, the present vendors, when the hospital became redundant and
A11 126 which was refused by the council. ^The sale marks the apparent end of
A11 127 a lengthy campaign for the hospital buildings to be returned to the
A11 128 town for at the most a nominal sum.
A11 129    |^Originally a gift to the townspeople by Lord Rothschild in 1901,
A11 130 the hospital was taken over under the National Health Act in 1948 but
A11 131 soon afterwards was closed as a hospital and has since been used
A11 132 partly for storage purposes and also to accommodate a hospital board
A11 133 official. ^When the Ministry decided to dispose of the buildings they
A11 134 were first offered to the council at the district valuer's figure of
A11 135 *+5,000. ^It was stated that the Ministry had no power to return the
A11 136 property to the council at no cost.
A11 137 *<*6HEAVY ATTENDANCE*>
A11 138    |^*0At the sale, conducted by Knight, Frank and Rutley, local
A11 139 feelings were shown by the heavy attendance rather than by indecorous
A11 140 behaviour, and bidding which started at *+2,000, rose rapidly to
A11 141 *+6,000, mainly by *+25 and *+50 advances, changing to *+100 advances
A11 142 in the final stages.

A11 144 buildings, which lie on a site of just over two acres and include a
A11 145 five-bedroomed detached house, two small hospital blocks and various
A11 146 outbuildings. ^Planning permission has been given in the past for the
A11 147 conversion of the two ward blocks into residential accommodation, but
A11 148 the site lies in an area of high landscape value, which would make

A11 157 *<CLASH ON *'CHATTERLEY**' CASE*>
A11 158 *<*2FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT*>
A11 159 *<BOLTON, \0*0Feb. 21*>
A11 160    |^\0Mr. Frank Singleton, editor of the *1Bolton Evening News, *0and
A11 161 president of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors, has resigned from
A11 162 the Press Council. ^At its last meeting the council expressed
A11 163 disapproval of the handling of the *1Lady Chatterley's Lover *0case by
A11 164 *1The Guardian, The Observer, *0and *1The Spectator. ^*0\0Mr.
A11 165 Singleton wrote a letter to *1The Guardian *0dissociating himself from
A11 166 this action.
A11 167    |^\0Mr. Singleton said tonight that \0Mr. George Murray, the
A11 168 chairman of the Press Council, had written to him, saying that the
A11 169 council would almost certainly regard him as responsible for a breach
A11 170 of confidence, and that since he had made his views known without
A11 171 informing the council, he (\0Mr. Murray) intended to mention the
A11 172 matter in a letter to *1The Guardian.
A11 173    |^*0In his letter of resignation \0Mr. Singleton wrote to \0Mr.
A11 174 Murray: ^*"Rightly or wrongly I felt justified in correcting the
A11 175 impression in the statement issued to the press that the opinion of
A11 176 the council was unanimous... ^It is with sincere regret that I sever
A11 177 my association with the council on which I have always thought it a

A11 179 *<*6ETON RATE RELIEF*>
A11 180 *<TOWN NOT AFFECTED, SAYS \0MR. BROOKE*>
A11 181    |^*0The rating of public schools was a matter on which the Commons
A11 182 as a whole should express an opinion, \0Mr. Mitchison (Kettering,
A11 183 \0Lab.) said yesterday when the Standing Committee on the Rating and
A11 184 Valuation Bill continued its discussion on an Opposition amendment to
A11 185 rate public schools fully rather than give them 50 per cent relief.
A11 186    |^\0Mr. Mitchison said that a large public school in an urban
A11 187 district was anomalous. ^He hoped to raise the matter at a later
A11 188 stage.
A11 189    |^The amendment was withdrawn.
A11 190    |^In a general discussion on clause 8, which concerns the reduction
A11 191 and remission of rates payable by charitable and other organizations,
A11 192 \0Mr. Brooke, Minister of Housing and Local Government, said that
A11 193 boarding schools*- though there were exceptions*- tended to be in the
A11 194 country in rating areas which were not wealthy. ^Therefore in many
A11 195 cases any effect of loss of rates due to the mandatory 50 per cent
A11 196 derating would be made up by rate deficiency grant.
A11 197 *<*6MADE UP BY GRANT*>
A11 198    |^*0In the case of Eton, which had attracted some attention, though
A11 199 there might be some marginal effect on the county rate, so far as he
A11 200 could ascertain there would be no effect on the urban district council
A11 201 rate, because any loss of rate through mandatory relief would be fully
A11 202 made up by deficiency grant.
A11 203    |^\0Mr. Brooke said that there was a weakness in the case for
A11 204 assisting such bodies as learned societies by rate relief because it
A11 205 meant that local people would have to put their hands deeper into
A11 206 their pockets. ^If any such bodies could establish their claim for
A11 207 relief by means of further contribution from the Exchequer, that would
A11 208 lie outside the scope of the Bill.
A11 209    |^The clause was approved and the committee adjourned until
A11 210 tomorrow.

A12   5 her home for four days, was kept locked in an attic, it was revealed
A12   6 yesterday.
A12   7    |^As Nancy haltingly told the story of her four-day ordeal to
A12   8 police last night, another great search began... this time for a
A12   9 ginger-haired man the police thought might be able to help in their
A12  10 enquiries.
A12  11    |^*0Nancy, who had been missing from her home at Burneside,
A12  12 Westmorland, since last Thursday, was found yesterday in the locked
A12  13 attic of a house in Chambres-road, Southport, \0Lancs.
A12  14 *<*4Hysterical*>
A12  15    |^*0The windows of the attic were boarded over. ^Nancy was
A12  16 wild-eyed and hysterical... and shoeless. ^But she was unharmed.
A12  17    |^Last night she was reunited at Southport police station with her
A12  18 aunt and uncle, \0Mr. and \0Mrs. Gibson, with whom she lives at
A12  19 Burneside.
A12  20    |^Last night, too, the police announced: ^*"We want to interview
A12  21 Horatio Richard Seddon, 28, who can possibly help us in our
A12  22 enquiries.**"
A12  23    |^*4The police statement added: ^*"We have alerted Interpol [the
A12  24 international police organisation] and all ports and airports in our
A12  25 effort to trace this man.**"
A12  26    |^*0A police description of Seddon said he was about 5\0ft. 10\0in.
A12  27 to 6\0ft., long-legged, very slim, ginger-haired and wearing
A12  28 tortoiseshell glasses.
A12  29 *<*4No Reply*>
A12  30    |^*0He was believed to be driving an old-type black Standard 14
A12  31 saloon number ZH2014.
A12  32    |^*4This was how little Nancy was found yesterday at the house in
A12  33 Chambres-road...
A12  34    |^*0At about 11 {0a.m.} screams of ~*"Help!**" were heard by
A12  35 \0Mrs. Winifred Hoyles, 28, who lives next door. ^She was playing with
A12  36 her three-year-old daughter, Julie, at the time.
A12  37    |^\0Mrs. Hoyles said later: ^*"I went next door and shouted, but I
A12  38 got no reply and thought that perhaps I was hearing things.
A12  39    |^*4*"I listened again, and it *6WAS *4someone screaming for
A12  40 help...
A12  41    |^*0*"The cries seemed to come from the attic windows.

A12  57 women's magazines scattered around. ^There were also pieces of bread.
A12  58 ^There was no bed in the room*- only a mattress.
A12  59    |^*"Nancy said a man had left her in the attic on Thursday. ^She
A12  60 told me:

A12  67    |^Police thought last night that Nancy's screams had not been heard
A12  68 because of thick red-and-white-striped wallpaper which was plastered
A12  69 over the boards nailed against the attic windows.
A12  70    |^As far as Nancy was concerned, there might have been no window at
A12  71 all in the room. ^The only light was from an electric bulb. ^So, for

A12  73 *<*612 MINUTES OF THE DUKE ON {0TV}*>
A12  74    |^THE *4Duke of Edinburgh made a twelve-minute appearance on
A12  75 {0BBC} television last night*- and looked more relaxed than his
A12  76 interviewer, Richard Dimbleby.
A12  77    |^*0It was the Duke's first interview on British {0TV} and he
A12  78 came across like an unflurried man having a cosy fireside chat.
A12  79    |^This pre-recorded interview was for the weekly programme
A12  80 *"Panorama.**"
A12  81    |^It was concerned with the Commonwealth Technical Training Week
A12  82 which opened yesterday.
A12  83    |^*4The aim of the Week's campaign is to draw attention to the need
A12  84 for technical training.
A12  85    |^*0Twenty-eight Commonwealth countries are taking part and in this
A12  86 country 188 local councils have helped to arrange special events to
A12  87 boost the campaign.
A12  88    |^In his {0TV} interview the Duke was obviously enthusiastic
A12  89 about the whole project.
A12  90 *<*4Difficult*>
A12  91    |^*0And he had a lot to say about Britain's unskilled workers.
A12  92    |^There were not enough people in industry, he said, who were
A12  93 technically trained.
A12  94    |^He added: ^*"By far the most difficult problem is this tremendous
A12  95 attraction of relatively highly paid jobs for unskilled people.**"
A12  96    |^Anyone who went into unskilled work, he said, went in at the rate
A12  97 for the job, regardless of age.
A12  98    |^*4What many parents did not seem to realise was that a relatively
A12  99 high wage now might be a rather poor one in after years.
A12 100    |^*0Britain, said the Duke, could not hope to compete in foreign
A12 101 markets if industry went on using unskilled labour.
A12 102    |^The Duke pointed out that of 550,000 school leavers aged from
A12 103 fifteen to seventeen, who started work last year, only 130,000 took
A12 104 *2SKILLED *0jobs.
A12 105 *<*4Snapped Up*>
A12 106    |^*0*"There are all too many people who say: ~*'Well, we're not
A12 107 going to bother to train anybody in our industry because they'll
A12 108 promptly get snapped up by another industry,**'**" the Duke added.
A12 109    |^During the training Week, factories all over the country will be
A12 110 holding *"open days**" to show their apprenticeship schemes to school
A12 111 leavers and their parents.
A12 112 *<*6A MAN WHO DOES FOUR JOBS*>
A12 113    |^A BARRISTER *4told a court yesterday about the man with four
A12 114 jobs.
A12 115    |^*0This, \0Mr. Anthony McCowan told magistrates at Steyning,
A12 116 Sussex, is the working life of fifty-six-year-old Richard Gilroy:
A12 117    |^As a *2POULTRY FARMER *0he works till late afternoon.
A12 118    |^Then he turns to his problems as boss of a *2WINDOW-CLEANING
A12 119 *0business.
A12 120 *<*4Factory*>
A12 121    |^*0Five nights a week he works as a *2LATHE OPERATOR *0at a
A12 122 factory.
A12 123    |^In his spare time he becomes a *2HOME-HELP *0because his wife is
A12 124 paralysed
A12 125    |^His total income: About *+22 a week.
A12 126    |^\0Mr. McCowan said \0Mr. Gilroy, father of two, worked so hard
A12 127 because his poultry business had not been doing too well.
A12 128    |^Gilroy, of Mill-hill, Shoreham, Sussex, admitted driving while
A12 129 under the influence of drink.
A12 130    |^He was fined *+40, was disqualified from driving for a year, and
A12 131 was ordered to pay *+12 costs.
A12 132 *<*6BARONET'S WIFE NAMED*>
A12 133    |^A BARONET'S *4wife was alleged yesterday to have committed
A12 134 misconduct with a farmer.
A12 135    |^She is Lady (Juliana) Cunliffe-Owen, 32, wife of Sir Dudley
A12 136 Cunliffe-Owen.
A12 137    |^In the Jersey Royal Court, \0Mrs. Diana Roberts, wife of farmer
A12 138 John Roberts, of \0St. Ouen, Jersey, sought a legal separation on the
A12 139 ground of her husband's alleged adultery with Lady Cunliffe-Owen.

A12 142 *<*4What Labour is \5*+acking..*>
A12 143 *<By *6JAMES BEECROFT*>
A12 144    |^LABOUR'S *4cash problems were discussed last night by \0Mr. Len
A12 145 Williams, the Party's National Agent and Deputy General Secretary.
A12 146    |^*0The Party's National Executive, he said, was considering ways
A12 147 of increasing Labour's income.
A12 148    |^But whatever was done, the Party would never have funds on the
A12 149 Tory scale.
A12 150    |^\0Mr. Williams was talking to more than 300 Young Socialists
A12 151 attending their organisation's national rally at Skegness, \0Lincs.
A12 152    |^He stressed that last year *+213,000 of the Labour Party's
A12 153 *+250,000 income was contributed by the trades unions.
A12 154    |^*4The average contribution from individual Party members, he
A12 155 said, was only 4\0s. a year.
A12 156    |^*0*"Even with the support of the unions,**" he went on, *"the
A12 157 amount of money we have today is not sufficient for our Party to do
A12 158 its job adequately.
A12 159    |^*"Most of the Constituency Parties are always short of cash.
A12 160 ^Many of them are in debt for the last election.**"
A12 161    |^The trades unions, said \0Mr. Williams, had not only been the
A12 162 main financial support of the Labour Party*- they had been, through
A12 163 their steadiness, *"the ballast which has kept the ship upright in
A12 164 heavy seas.**"
A12 165 *<*6BLOW BY FATHER BLINDED HIS BABY*>

A12 168 that the baby will be blind for life, a court was told yesterday.
A12 169    |^*0The father, Charles Wildridge, told the magistrates at Hull,
A12 170 \0Yorks: ^*"I lost my temper when he would not take his feed.**"
A12 171    |^Wildridge, 37, of Rimswell-road, Hull, pleaded guilty to
A12 172 assaulting and neglecting the baby, Michael, in a way likely to cause
A12 173 unnecessary suffering. ^He was gaoled for six months.
A12 174 *<*4*'Severest**'*>
A12 175    |^The chairman of the magistrates, \0Mr. {0J. H.} Tarbitten, told
A12 176 Wildridge: ^*"You are a most inhuman man.
A12 177    |^*0*"As a result of striking the baby, he is blind for life. ^Any
A12 178 father who does that deserves the severest punishment.**"
A12 179    |^\0Mr. {0J. F.} Croft, prosecuting, said that because of family
A12 180 circumstances, Michael was kept in hospital for a time after his
A12 181 birth.
A12 182    |^When taken home, he was normal and healthy.
A12 183    |^Two months later Wildridge*- who has five other children*- took
A12 184 the baby to a doctor's surgery and said: ^*'He has had a bash in the
A12 185 face.**'
A12 186    |^*4The doctor was out but his wife called an ambulance when she
A12 187 saw the child. ^She thought he was dying.
A12 188    |^*0\0Mr. Croft added that in hospital Michael was found to be
A12 189 blind in both eyes. ^Most of his face was bruised and X-rays showed
A12 190 that one leg had been broken but had healed.
A12 191 *<*4Temper*>
A12 192    |^*0Wildridge, who is unemployed, told the magistrates: ^*"I was
A12 193 preparing a meal for my sick wife and the children were coming home
A12 194 from school.
A12 195    |^*"When the baby would not take his feed I lost my temper. ^I have

A12 203    |^Neale was found dead, with severe head injuries, in the garden of

A12 212    |^*0Said \0Mr. Patrick Mayhew at East Kent Quarter Sessions in
A12 213 Canterbury: ^*"In this easy-come system, expensive goods came into her
A12 214 possession for small *'down**' payments.**"
A12 215    |^Then, added \0Mr. Mayhew, the wife *"succumbed to temptation**"
A12 216 and sold hire-purchase goods so as to keep up the payments on them
A12 217    |^*4He went on: ^*"The pace got hotter, and the whole nightmare of
A12 218 deceit collapsed.**"
A12 219 *<*+1,000*>

A13  84    |^*4A *2CALL *0for an all-out effort to banish the scourge of
A13  85 killer dust from the pits has been made by the executive council of
A13  86 the South Wales area of the National Union of Mineworkers.
A13  87    |^Drastic revision of the approved dust standard, which he says is
A13  88 not a safe standard, is urged by safety officer Linden James, writing
A13  89 in the current issue of the area's magazine.
A13  90    |^*"Publicity is the first necessity if we are to get the
A13  91 extraordinary measures implemented that are necessary to rid mining of
A13  92 dust disease,**" says \0Mr. James.
A13  93    |^*"Such measures will cost money and, as there is some reluctance
A13  94 to spend money, there will be resistance.**"

A13  96    |^*0Dust kills many more people than gas, bad roofs, haulage,

A13  98 together, he says.
A13  99    |^Between 1951 and 1958 in the whole of Great Britain 183 lives
A13 100 were lost as a result of explosions in the pits. ^In South Wales 346
A13 101 died from dust in 1959 alone.
A13 102    |^Miners who had worked during the long period of *"dust-approved
A13 103 conditions,**" including younger men whose whole working lives were
A13 104 completely within the *"suppression era,**" had contracted the
A13 105 disease.
A13 106    |^In some coalfields dust was merely a nuisance. ^In South Wales it
A13 107 was a matter of life or death.
A13 108 *<*5Not an excuse*>
A13 109    |^*0Present approved standards could be achieved throughout the
A13 110 coalfield, and in many cases without difficulty.
A13 111    |^As the achievement of these standards was now the ultimate aim,
A13 112 *"the standard has been reduced from an incentive to suppress dust to
A13 113 an excuse not to suppress it.**"
A13 114    |^The existing standard was no longer effective, *"and should
A13 115 therefore be discarded as a hindrance to progress,**" says \0Mr.
A13 116 James.
A13 117    |^Urging a campaign for improved conditions, he asks the miners to
A13 118 set their own house in order and make full use of the suppressive
A13 119 equipment provided.
A13 120    |^*"Dust kills; if we make dust unnecessarily, we are killers,**"

A14 112    |^*0The Manchester Stipendiary Magistrate (\0Mr \0F. Bancroft
A14 113 Turner) yesterday dismissed a summons against the Lord Mayor of
A14 114 Manchester (Alderman Lionel Biggs) alleging that, as returning officer
A14 115 at the Moss Side parliamentary byelection, he failed to discharge his
A14 116 statutory obligations by not being present on October 25 to receive
A14 117 nomination papers*- handed in by \0Mr Walter Hesketh, the British
A14 118 Union Movement's candidate. ^\0Mr Bancroft Turner awarded 20 guineas
A14 119 costs against \0Mr Hesketh as a contribution to the defence costs.
A14 120    |^\0Mr Hesketh said that on October 25 he and \0Mr Max Moseley, his
A14 121 agent, visited the town hall to deliver the nomination papers. ^The
A14 122 returning officer was not there and, for 5 minutes, town hall
A14 123 officials were unable to obtain the Lord Mayor. ^\0Mr Hesketh said:
A14 124 ^*"For a long time we were wandering through the passages of the town
A14 125 hall until I was finally obliged to defer the submission of my
A14 126 nomination papers.**"
A14 127 *<*4Matter of courtesy*>
A14 128    |^*0\0Mr {0F. P. R.} Hinchliffe, for the Lord Mayor, said that
A14 129 Alderman Biggs, as returning officer, had the right to appoint a
A14 130 deputy*- in this case the town clerk*- who, in turn, was authorised to
A14 131 appoint deputies.
A14 132    |^\0Mr Moseley agreed with \0Mr Hinchliffe that \0Mr Hesketh had
A14 133 received an invitation from the Lord Mayor for all the candidates to
A14 134 attend the town hall with their nomination papers on Friday, October
A14 135 27.
A14 136    |^\0Mr Hinchliffe:
A14 137 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
A14 138 ^Was your reason for not accepting the invitation to appear on Friday
A14 139 because you didn't wish to be associated with the other candidates in
A14 140 any way?*- ^Yes, that was one reason.
A14 141 **[END QUOTE**]
A14 142    |^\0Mr Hinchliffe said it had been a practice in the city, as a
A14 143 matter of courtesy, for the Lord Mayor, to extend an invitation to all
A14 144 the parliamentary candidates to attend at the town hall at a certain
A14 145 time with their nomination papers. ^It was done to prevent the
A14 146 returning officer or the acting returning officer from being
A14 147 incarcerated in a certain building from 10 {0a.m.} to 3 {0p.m.} on
A14 148 five successive days.
A14 149    |^\0Mr Moseley said that the election officer (\0Mr Norman \de
A14 150 Gruchy) told him at the town hall on October 25 that he was no more
A14 151 authorised to accept nomination papers from \0Mr Hesketh than a
A14 152 corporation dustman.
A14 153    |^In evidence \0Mr \de Gruchy said he did not recall saying he was
A14 154 not authorised to accept the nomination papers.
A14 155    |^In dismissing the summons, \0Mr Bancroft Turner said \0Mr Hesketh
A14 156 and \0Mr Moseley had been labouring under a sense of grievance and, to
A14 157 some extent, it was a legitimate grievance. ^The important
A14 158 consideration, however, was that if a member of the public wished to
A14 159 be nominated as a candidate between certain statutory dates at certain
A14 160 times, his position should be carefully safeguarded.

A15   2 *<*6EUROPEAN AIR FARES MAY BE RAISED*>
A15   3 *<AIRLINES START SPECIAL TALKS IN PARIS TO-DAY*>
A15   4 *<*4By Our Air Correspondent*>
A15   5    |^Air fares in Europe may be increased*- possibly by amounts
A15   6 between 2 and 5 per \0cent.*- from April 1 as a result of a special
A15   7 private meeting of European airlines which opens in Paris this
A15   8 morning.
A15   9    |^*0The meeting has been called to discuss the need for the
A15  10 increases by the International Air Transport Association*- the world's
A15  11 airline Parliament*- in response to urgent requests from a number of
A15  12 European airlines who have become alarmed at continually rising costs,
A15  13 in particular the {0U.K.} Ministry of Aviation's decision to raise
A15  14 landing fees at its airports by about one-third from April 1.
A15  15    |^All the European carriers, including British European Airways,
A15  16 will attend, and most of the long-haul operators, including British
A15  17 Overseas Airways Corporation, who are not directly involved but who
A15  18 fly over parts of Europe, will be sending observers.
A15  19    |^It is thought likely that at the meeting {0B.E.A.} will fight
A15  20 any proposal to raise fares, especially at such short notice. ^The
A15  21 airline has booked many hundreds of thousands of passengers on the
A15  22 basis of existing or planned fares levels already agreed, and it is
A15  23 likely to argue that the administrative problems involved in raising
A15  24 fares now would be enormous, besides cutting across {0B.E.A.}'s
A15  25 entire philosophy of getting fares down and keeping them down.
A15  26    |^It is understood that the prime movers behind this virtually
A15  27 emergency session of the {0I.A.T.A.} are several of the smaller
A15  28 European carriers, who have in the past been strong opponents of
A15  29 fares-cutting airlines, such as {0B.E.A.}
A15  30 *<*6TRAFFIC TALKS*>
A15  31 *<*4Ending *"Fares Freeze**"*>
A15  32    |^*0The problem of these smaller airlines is not difficult to
A15  33 gauge. ^Substantial cuts in European air fares were agreed, after long
A15  34 and even bitter argument, at the {0I.A.T.A.} traffic conference in
A15  35 Honolulu in the Autumn of 1959, to become effective from April 1,
A15  36 1960.
A15  37    |^At the 1960 annual traffic conference, held in Cannes last
A15  38 autumn, these earlier cuts were confirmed, and a few further special
A15  39 European reductions were also agreed, to become effective from April
A15  40 1, this year.
A15  41    |^The Cannes conference also took the unprecedented decision
A15  42 however, of declaring what amounted to *"fares freeze**" for a period
A15  43 of two years, agreeing that there would be no further traffic
A15  44 conference until the autumn of 1962, when fares would be fixed for the
A15  45 traffic year starting April 1, 1963.
A15  46 *<*6LANDING FEES UP*>
A15  47 *<*4Effect on Costs*>
A15  48    |^*0The effect of this would have been to keep European air fares
A15  49 at their existing levels right up to the spring of 1963, in the face
A15  50 of rising costs and steadily expanding capacity as more and more jets
A15  51 joined the airlines' fleets.
A15  52    |^In the event, these rising costs have already overtaken the
A15  53 airlines. ^In particular, a good deal of concern has been caused in
A15  54 European air transport by the decision of the Ministry of Aviation to
A15  55 raise landing fees at the {0U.K.} airports it controls by about
A15  56 one-third from April 1.
A15  57    |^A Comet 4B, for example, will now have to pay a basic rate of
A15  58 about *+59 to land at London Airport if the flight originates within
A15  59 Europe, and a full rate of *+115 if the flight originates at a point
A15  60 beyond Europe. ^The existing fees are about *+44 basic and *+84 full.
A15  61 ^For a Viscount, the basic rate goes up from about *+17 to *+23, and
A15  62 the full rate from about *+30 to *+41.
A15  63    |^The effect will be to put up {0B.E.A.}'s landing fees for
A15  64 {0U.K.} domestic flights alone by *+440,000 in a full year, and by
A15  65 probably as much again on its landing fees for international flights.
A15  66    |^{0B.E.A.} has already been forced to counter this by raising
A15  67 many of its domestic tourist fares by 3 1/2 per \0cent. from April 1,
A15  68 cancelling out part of the cuts in those fares it proposed to make
A15  69 from that date.
A15  70 *<*6FOREIGN AIRLINES*>
A15  71 *<*4Openly Critical*>
A15  72    |^*0Every foreign airline flying to the {0U.K.} is in the same
A15  73 position. ^They are openly critical about the higher landing fees, and
A15  74 it is understood that the Ministry's decision will be cited by many at
A15  75 the Paris meeting as one of the principal reasons why air fares in
A15  76 Europe must rise*- and rise from the same date that the higher landing
A15  77 fees become effective.
A15  78    |^In order to protect its bookings position*- and its avowed
A15  79 long-term aim of slashing fares*- {0B.E.A.} will probably try to
A15  80 resist the strong efforts that will be made in Paris to raise fares,
A15  81 but it may well be obliged to concede something.
A15  82    |^One possibility is that it may win a respite, with fares being
A15  83 raised by small amounts at a date later in the summer or in the
A15  84 autumn. ^Whatever the outcome, it is already clear that the Paris
A15  85 meeting will be difficult, and perhaps even stormy.

A15  87 *<By Our Industrial Correspondent*>
A15  88    |^*0The first boiler contract for the recently formed consortium of
A15  89 John Brown Land Boilers and Foster Wheeler was announced yesterday by
A15  90 the Central Electricity Generating Board.
A15  91 *<*4Shared Contracts*>
A15  92    |^*0The consortium, which was formed last month, is to supply four
A15  93 350,000 kilowatt boilers, at a cost of over *+12\0m., to the Tilbury B
A15  94 power station. ^The steam condensers are to be supplied by Richardsons
A15  95 Westgarth (Hartlepool).
A15  96    |^There is considerable over-capacity in the boiler industry, and
A15  97 it has become the {0*2C.E.G.B.}*0's practice to spread the large
A15  98 contracts between two manufacturers. ^Thus the boiler order for the
A15  99 new West Burton power station in Nottinghamshire was shared between
A15 100 Simon-Carves and International Combustion, and, as reported last week,
A15 101 a further *+20\0m. order was awarded to Babcock and Wilcox and Yarrow
A15 102 and Company.
A15 103    |^The new Tilbury contract will represent a much-needed addition of
A15 104 new work for the two companies concerned. ^Lord Aberconway, chairman
A15 105 of John Brown, said last year that the 1959 boiler order for the
A15 106 Bankside power station was the only order received by the company from
A15 107 a British generating authority for more than four years.

A15 117 stores known as Society Footwear. ^If the new organisation is a
A15 118 success, it is likely to spread to other trades, including radio, and
A15 119 electrical goods.
A15 120    |^Fifty-six Co-operative retail societies have already indicated
A15 121 their readiness to join the English and Scottish Wholesale Societies
A15 122 in the new venture which follows the independent commission's
A15 123 recommendation in 1958 that the \0Co-ops. should establish chains of
A15 124 specialist shops.
A15 125    |^Some of the largest retail societies are among those joining.
A15 126 ^They include the London Society, the Royal Arsenal, the South
A15 127 Suburban, Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth, Newcastle-on-Tyne and
A15 128 the Co-operative Retail Service, a big amalgamation of societies.
A15 129    |^Each retail society will invest *+5,000 for every shoe shop it
A15 130 plans to open. ^This will give the chain an initial capital of over
A15 131 *+500,000*- half provided by the retail societies and half by the
A15 132 {0C.W.S.} and {0S.C.W.S.} ^The shops will not stock only
A15 133 {0C.W.S.} shoes. ^*"We realise that the customer wants a range of
A15 134 choice,**" said a spokesman in Manchester to-day.
A15 135    |^Existing Co-operative shoe shops will not be affected. ^*"We
A15 136 shall start shops in places where there is the trade available and
A15 137 where the societies have not been able to develop so far.**"
A15 138    |^\0Mr. \0R. Southern, chairman of the {0C.W.S.} Board's retail
A15 139 trading committee and one of four directors nominated by the wholesale

A15 142 technical resources of the {0C.W.S.} and the {0S.C.W.S.} ^Our

A15 149    |^*4New tariff cuts of 5 per \0cent., to come into force on April
A15 150 1, were approved by the French Council of Ministers to-day.
A15 151    |^*0Reductions apply specifically to the Six countries of the
A15 152 Common Market but, in some circumstances, they will also affect
A15 153 imports from outside. ^It is understood, however, that British and
A15 154 American cars will not benefit from the reductions.
A15 155    |^The full details of the reductions will not be known until the
A15 156 decree appears in the official journal to-morrow or even a day after.
A15 157 *<*4In Anticipation*>
A15 158    |^*0It was stated that the decision was taken in anticipation of
A15 159 the 10 per \0cent. reduction within the Common Market which takes
A15 160 place automatically at the end of the year. ^It was indicated at the
A15 161 same time that the cuts would apply to all countries providing that
A15 162 the resulting duties did not fall below the common external tariff of
A15 163 the Six.
A15 164    |^One of the immediate results will be to nullify the effects of
A15 165 the recent revaluation of the D-Mark on the prices of German exports
A15 166 in the French market. ^It is not quite clear exactly how the
A15 167 reductions are to be applied. ^In the past few weeks there has been a
A15 168 prolonged discussion between Ministries as to whether the cuts should
A15 169 apply uniformly across the board or should vary with different
A15 170 products. ^It is, however, reported that the tariff on textiles and
A15 171 cars imported from the Common Market are **[SIC**] to be reduced by 10
A15 172 per \0cent.
A15 173 *<*4Checking Prices*>
A15 174    |^*0The Ministry of Finance said that the reductions now approved
A15 175 were designed to check the upward trend in prices. ^This is one more

A15 181    |^The widespread belief that the recession may have reached its
A15 182 turning point was endorsed to-day by President Kennedy's chief
A15 183 economic adviser, \0Dr. Walter Heller.
A15 184    |^\0Dr. Heller said that with signs pointing to a bottoming-out of

A15 189 remarks as Congress was preparing to send the first of \0Mr. Kennedy's
A15 190 anti-recession Bills to the White House for signature. ^The Bill,
A15 191 providing $990\0m. (*+353,570,000) in additional aid for unemployed
A15 192 who have exhausted their benefits, followed on the heels of the Feed
A15 193 Grains Bill passed earlier in the day*- after two months in office
A15 194 President Kennedy has now seen his first major proposals enacted into
A15 195 law.
A15 196    |^So far his programme has survived its progress through Congress
A15 197 relatively unscathed, but the most contentious matters have still to
A15 198 come up for consideration. ^The chances of some of the latter may
A15 199 suffer through a pick-up in business conditions which, \0Dr. Heller
A15 200 said to-day, might be relatively early. ^But he emphasised that only a
A15 201 relatively slow return to full employment could be expected.
A15 202    |^The Administration is striving to persuade Congress that a
A15 203 turn-round in business does not obviate the need for such measures as
A15 204 pension liberalisation*- scheduled for April 1 by the President but so
A15 205 far given no attention by Congress*- and a rise in the minimum wage,
A15 206 which comes up for House debate this week.
A15 207    |^The sluggishness of the Congressional pace is partly explained by
A15 208 conservative opposition to much of the President's programme.
A15 209    |^But another reason is that Congress is simply not geared to cope
A15 210 with the flood of proposals that has poured from the White House on a
A15 211 scale only matched under President Roosevelt.

A16  26 Deferred get no dividend until 20\0s. had been paid on the Ordinary.
A16  27    |^Anybody who invested *+100 in these shares in 1958 would now have

A16 197 agree with it.
A16 198    |^The facts are, as the *1Gazette *0points out, that when the banks

A16 200 the building societies.
A16 201 *<*7BARGAINS*>
A16 202    |^*0These, although they have large funds, haven't got anything
A16 203 like enough money to meet the huge demand. ^And building society

A16 205    |^Some houses, it is true, might now fall in price, particularly
A16 206 the pre-1919 houses, since the Government's lending scheme on these
A16 207 has been abandoned.
A16 208    |^But the societies don't want to lend money on these old houses.
A16 209 ^So in that case, too, the young home-builders will be frustrated.
A16 210    |^For these houses, and some others, the winter could be a bargain
A16 211 time for the man with ready cash who can pay the full price. ^But how
A16 212 many young home-makers are in that position?
A16 213    |^So young lovers move into a queue that goes on lengthening.
A16 214    |^Says the *1Gazette: ^*0*"We wish them joy as they trudge from

A17   2 *<*5Familiarity Breeds Discrimination*>
A17   3 *<*4World of Music: By *6MARTIN COOPER*>
A17   4    |^*4A*2S *0Europe and America slowly approach a cultural unity
A17   5 which must eventually shame the politicians into following suit, the
A17   6 old concept of local or national reputations in the arts is being
A17   7 discarded.
A17   8    |^Until 1940 it was an observable fact that there were composers
A17   9 whose music was highly prized in some countries and entirely neglected
A17  10 by their neighbours, and this was explained by the difference in
A17  11 national characters.
A17  12    |^It is not so very long ago that Brahms met with bored
A17  13 incomprehension in Latin countries, that Bruckner and Mahler were
A17  14 regarded as exclusively Teutonic, Faure*?2 exclusively French, and
A17  15 Nielsen exclusively Scandinavian, while Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians
A17  16 marvelled at their own particular appreciation of Sibelius, Delius or
A17  17 Vaughan Williams.
A17  18    |^Now, however, the wider musical exchanges made possible by
A17  19 broadcasting, recording and the international tours of major
A17  20 orchestras have made ignorance and prejudice inexcusable and greatly
A17  21 reduced the area in which national temperament seriously limits the
A17  22 appreciation of any music. ^What were formerly regarded as limitations
A17  23 in the sensibility or intelligence of the public begin to appear
A17  24 rather as flaws in the composers concerned, and the importance of
A17  25 those flaws is revealed in each case by the degree to which an
A17  26 international, as opposed to a merely local, public can be persuaded
A17  27 to overlook them.
A17  28    |^Brahms is now universally accepted at an estimate well below that
A17  29 current in Britain and Germany when he was placed beside Bach and
A17  30 Beethoven, but enormously higher than that which once virtually
A17  31 dismissed him from French and Italian programmes. ^Bruckner is
A17  32 gradually becoming known and appreciated outside the Germanic
A17  33 countries in exactly the same way, not as the equal (let alone the
A17  34 superior, as some enthusiasts have suggested) of Beethoven but as a
A17  35 great and unique figure in the history of the symphony.
A17  36    |
A17  37    |^*4M*2AHLER*0's case is slightly different, since he has always
A17  38 been neglected in his native Austria and has appealed more to
A17  39 individuals (Casella, for instance, was an improbable champion) than
A17  40 to national groups. ^The uneven value of his symphonies becomes
A17  41 clearer as they are more performed, but at least three of them are now
A17  42 repertory works here and in America, and the remaining six obtain
A17  43 festival or occasional performances, while the songs are universally
A17  44 acknowledged.
A17  45    |^Faure*?2, once dismissed as a French trifler, is now recognised
A17  46 as a minor master in the field of piano and chamber music, and
A17  47 something greater as a song-writer (could anyone have prophesied even
A17  48 20 years ago that the greatest German lieder-singer of the day would
A17  49 record a Faure*?2 song-cycle as Fischer-Dieskau has done?). ^Nielsen,
A17  50 like Mahler, has a strong personal following outside Scandinavia and
A17  51 individual works have found their place in the repertory here.
A17  52    |^The position of the great Anglo-Saxon favourites, on the other
A17  53 hand, is quite different owing to the extraordinary instability of the
A17  54 Anglo-Saxon public, which has shown itself infinitely suggestible,
A17  55 knowing nothing between uncritical enthusiasm and blank
A17  56 incomprehension. ^This lack of critical discrimination, which can be
A17  57 observed in our attitude towards performers as well as composers, is
A17  58 the price we pay for our provincial position on the periphery of the
A17  59 great Western European musical tradition, our failure over two
A17  60 centuries to sustain any strong national musical tradition of our own.
A17  61    |^Handel, Mendelssohn and Gounod were all in their turn
A17  62 astonished*- and, being human, delighted*- by the adoration that their
A17  63 works received in this country. ^In our own day Delius was quite aware
A17  64 that his music was enjoying a vogue that carried no guarantee of
A17  65 duration and Harold Johnson has recently revealed Sibelius's pleased
A17  66 but uneasy astonishment at finding himself acclaimed in England and
A17  67 America as the greatest living composer.
A17  68    |^Vaughan Williams's position as chief of the belated nationalist
A17  69 revival in this country seemed to promise greater security for his
A17  70 music; but, like Delius and Sibelius, he has not grown into a larger,
A17  71 more universal musical figure since his death.
A17  72    |
A17  73    |^*4S*2EVERAL *0correspondents have recently accused me of
A17  74 belittling, or at best *"damning with faint praise,**" the music of
A17  75 these three composers. ^But any praise must seem faint after the
A17  76 extravagant paeans that it has prompted in the past; and is it
A17  77 belittling a composer who has been too easily proclaimed a giant to
A17  78 attempt a more objective estimate? ^The violent opposition that these
A17  79 composers have certainly aroused in some quarters does not spring from
A17  80 an objective valuation of their music so much as from the fact that
A17  81 their music was used as a kind of smokescreen to hide from the public
A17  82 the revolutionary works of Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Bartok.
A17  83    |^Now that we have begun to become familiar with these, we can also
A17  84 begin to discriminate in our judgments of Delius, Sibelius and Vaughan
A17  85 Williams*- to sift their major from their minor achievements and to
A17  86 see them in perspective against the music of their great
A17  87 contemporaries.
A17  88 *<*4Gaining from the Right Setting*>
A17  89    |^*4T*2HERE *0can be few sights in Northern Europe more beautiful
A17  90 than the first view of the three massive towers of Bruges, giant
A17  91 figures dominating a rather desolate landscape, as one approaches the
A17  92 town across the flat coastal plain.
A17  93    |^Bruges itself, with its belfry *"old and brown,**" still
A17  94 preserves many signs of its mediaeval prosperity and it provides an
A17  95 incomparable setting for the {Se*?2minaire Europe*?2en de Musique
A17  96 Ancienne.}
A17  97    |^*0Some five years ago the Belgian Ministry of Education, a
A17  98 department generous in its subsidies to the arts, conceived the
A17  99 admirable idea of asking Stafford Cape, the musicologist and director
A17 100 of {Pro Musica Antiqua,} to organise at the College of Europe in
A17 101 Bruges a summer course in mediaeval and renaissance music.
A17 102    |^Every year since 1957 students from all over the Continent,
A17 103 recommended by their Governments, have met in Bruges for three weeks.
A17 104 ^The complete course takes three of these sessions, so that this year
A17 105 was the second year of the second course.
A17 106    |^There were altogether 24 students from 14 countries, among them
A17 107 three students from England and one, a lutenist, from distant Finland.
A17 108 ^Each day they attended lectures and made music informally together.

A17 111 the {Biennale Internationale de Poe*?2sie,} a gathering of poets
A17 112 from all over the world, in the nearby seaside town of Knokke, and it
A17 113 has now become the custom for the students of the \Se*?2minaire, under
A17 114 Stafford Cape's direction, to give an evening concert in the Casino.
A17 115 ^This they did last weekend, offering to a large international
A17 116 audience a fascinating programme of French and Italian 14th-century
A17 117 music and works of the Burgundian school. ^Almost every student took
A17 118 part, either playing or singing, sometimes putting aside an instrument
A17 119 to join in an unaccompanied motet or movement from a Mass.
A17 120    |^Remembering that these students had been working together for
A17 121 only a few weeks, that many of them had little previous knowledge of
A17 122 early music and that some were not professional musicians, one could
A17 123 only marvel at the progress they had made, not only in individual
A17 124 performance but in a general musical understanding of a period that
A17 125 often seems remote and inaccessible.
A17 126    |^In Dufay's *"{La belle se siet},**" for example, two sopranos,
A17 127 one from France, the other from England, sang easily and with obvious
A17 128 enjoyment in old French, as though they had been preparing the piece
A17 129 for months instead of weeks. ^Much of the music performed was of great
A17 130 contrapuntal complexity and profound religious feeling; that they were
A17 131 able to bring to it such style and insight after working together for
A17 132 so short a time was proof both of the students' devotion and of the
A17 133 enlightened direction of \0Mr. Stafford Cape.

A17 135 *<*5The Only Real Guide to Play-going*>
A17 136 *<*4About the Theatre: By *6{0W. A.} DARLINGTON*>
A17 137    |^*4P*2EOPLE *0quite often write to ask me to choose plays for
A17 138 them, and it is quite natural that they should. ^Here I am at their
A17 139 service, and I do my best to comply. ^But I sometimes wonder if they
A17 140 realise how difficult the task is. ^They are asking me to look at
A17 141 plays through their eyes, when my whole working life is spent
A17 142 examining them through my own.
A17 143    |^It is like being made to read through somebody else's spectacles.
A17 144    |^All valid criticism is informed personal opinion. ^That is a
A17 145 truism which will be questioned hardly anywhere, except in some
A17 146 quarters in America, where the collective opinion of the uninformed
A17 147 man in the street is thought to have a mystic significance.
A17 148    |^My old friend and colleague, Campbell Dixon, used to tell of a
A17 149 conversation he had with a New York film-critic, a lady, who heard
A17 150 with an air of shocked incredulity that what he offered his public was
A17 151 his own private and unsupported opinions. ^*"But surely,**" he said to
A17 152 her, *"that's what you do, isn't it?**"
A17 153    |^*"Certainly not.**"
A17 154    |^*"Then what do you do?**"
A17 155    |^*"I stand in the foyer and listen to what people are saying.**"
A17 156    |^Well, I'm not of this lady's persuasion. ^My opinions, such as
A17 157 they are, are my own, formed in accordance with my own needs and
A17 158 beliefs, my own experience. ^Nobody is likely, or even encouraged, to
A17 159 agree with the opinions unless he has the same needs and beliefs. ^It
A17 160 follows that a good number of the people who write to me about the
A17 161 plays they are to see are appealing to one whose tastes and views they
A17 162 do not share.
A17 163    |^To take the simplest example possible, I get letters asking me to
A17 164 select plays *"suitable for a family outing**" or *"suitable for
A17 165 children**". ^If I were to answer this according to my own beliefs, I
A17 166 should probably say, ~*"Take your family (or your children) to
A17 167 anything you think won't bore them**"; but it would be the wrong kind
A17 168 of answer to anyone who thinks *"suitability**" all that important.
A17 169 *<*5Common Sense*>
A17 170    |^*0It is, to me, a matter of plain common sense. ^At any given
A17 171 moment there are sure to be plays running in London to which the label
A17 172 *"for adults only**" might with propriety be fixed. ^An actual label
A17 173 is not necessary, because everybody knows which these plays are, or
A17 174 can easily find out; and nobody in his senses would dream of taking a
A17 175 child or an innocent maiden aunt (should such exist) to one of them.
A17 176 ^Outside this category there are many plays of a mild degree of
A17 177 unsuitability; and to these I personally should not hesitate to take
A17 178 any member of my family.
A17 179    |^When I was a young schoolboy I used to sneak off to the local
A17 180 dust-hole week by week, and saw many plays of which my parents, if
A17 181 consulted, might not have approved; and they never did me a mite of
A17 182 harm. ^Later, when I myself was a parent, I exercised only the
A17 183 lightest of censorship on my children's play-going, and they took no
A17 184 harm either. ^How, then, can I help other people to impose a ban in
A17 185 which I do not believe?
A17 186    |^Anyway, once you begin to look at the problem, there is almost
A17 187 nothing you can take a child to. ^Shakespeare is impossible, of
A17 188 course*- all those frank references to sex. ^And pantomime is worse.
A17 189 ^Peter Pan?*- very little sex there. ^True, but there are other
A17 190 horrors. ^I remember sitting behind a small boy who bounced in his
A17 191 chair with glee at the opening scene*- the dog-nurse, the flying
A17 192 lesson. ^But he fell oddly silent when the curtain rose, and when the
A17 193 scene began to fill with wolves and Red Indians, pirates and
A17 194 crocodiles he got off his seat, turned his back to the stage, and*-
A17 195 except for occasional terrified glances over his shoulder*- spent the
A17 196 rest of the act gazing longingly over my right shoulder at the
A17 197 illuminated word *2EXIT.
A17 198    |^*0It's just as difficult with adults. ^What can one do when asked
A17 199 to recommend a play *"suitable**" for a party of 30 people (sex, age
A17 200 and tastes all unspecified) except play safe and recommend *"My Fair
A17 201 Lady**" or *"The Mouse-Trap**"?
A17 202    |^To my mind, people do much better picking their own
A17 203 entertainments, even at random. ^I know of a Women's Institute which,
A17 204 on the strength of having enjoyed Sandy Wilson's pure *"Boy Friend,**"
A17 205 went off blithely on an outing to Brighton to see his
A17 206 hyper-sophisticated *"Valmouth.**"

A18   2 *<*4Advise and condense*>
A18   3 *<by {0W. J.} Weatherby*>
A18   4    |^*4A*2T *0a recent Washington party a garrulous American egghead
A18   5 tried to explain the difference between the Senate and the House of
A18   6 Representatives to confused foreign visitors. ^But the more he tried
A18   7 the more confused his audience looked*- and at last, too deep into
A18   8 references to populations, finance, and presidential recommendations,
A18   9 he began to sound confused himself.
A18  10    |^It was like a symbolical explanation of why so many outsiders
A18  11 fail to understand American politics and why*- to them*- the
A18  12 presidential leadership sometimes looks less decisive than it really
A18  13 is. ^One of the best popular accounts of the complex system of checks
A18  14 and balances in operation in Washington is Allen Drury's recent best
A18  15 seller, *"Advise and Consent,**" and even that was too involved and
A18  16 tortuous for some foreign readers. ^The decision then to make a
A18  17 massive Hollywood production of \0Mr Drury's novel is like a challenge
A18  18 to succeed where so many others have failed, for to be a success*-
A18  19 artistically as well as financially*- the film will have to be true to
A18  20 the reality of Washington and yet be simple enough for international
A18  21 audiences to understand.
A18  22    |^As the director, Otto Preminger, began to film recently in
A18  23 Washington, our old friends Reality and Illusion were busy providing
A18  24 some choice examples of their relationship in film terms. ^They met
A18  25 head-on at one party when an actor playing a senator learnt that the
A18  26 stranger he was chatting with was a real senator. ^The Hollywood
A18  27 *"senator**" had a noble looking image*- as public relations prose
A18  28 sometimes puts it*- and the gracious manners of an old plantation
A18  29 patriarch, whereas the real senator had the kind of untypical and
A18  30 unsaleable personality that might belong to a shopkeeper or a
A18  31 millionaire and would not get heroic film billing anywhere outside a
A18  32 home movie. ^The *"senator**" looked too right, almost as the outsider
A18  33 might have expected him to look, whereas the real one had an
A18  34 unexpectedness about him, as if he could not possibly be cast as
A18  35 anyone but himself.
A18  36    |^Much of the gap between Illusion and Reality is caused by the
A18  37 problem of time. ^\0Mr Drury's President and senators who reveal
A18  38 themselves gradually through 760 pages (at least in the American
A18  39 paperback edition) have had to be transformed into \0Mr Preminger's
A18  40 Franchot Tone, Don Murray, Lew Ayres, and the rest of an experienced
A18  41 team who can make the most of their split-second timing to create
A18  42 their characters in a matter of minutes. ^The real test of the film in
A18  43 the end will be how much has had to be oversimplified or glossed over
A18  44 to keep up with the clock.
A18  45    |^\0Mr Drury chose a comparatively melodramatic incident*- the
A18  46 selection of a controversial Secretary of State and the conflict
A18  47 between the White House and much of the Senate over it*- and threw in
A18  48 a few skeletons in the senatorial cupboards to show off when the
A18  49 reader got too bogged down in the political manoeuvres. ^\0Mr Drury, a
A18  50 former political reporter in Washington for the *"New York Times,**"
A18  51 is a great believer in the moderates' way in politics, and his book in
A18  52 one way is a tribute to his belief, in that it was moderate enough in
A18  53 tone to be fair even to extremists like the arch conservative from the
A18  54 South, Seab Cooley. ^Charles Laughton, who still has a Yorkshire ring
A18  55 to his voice, described his preparation for playing Cooley as *"an
A18  56 Eliza Doolittle job.**" ^He studied the right accent with a phonetics
A18  57 expert and did some extra homework in conversation with some real
A18  58 senators from the South. ^In the only scene I saw him play, he made
A18  59 his point with lightning professional speed and also managed a
A18  60 suggestion of an iceberg of character waiting to be revealed under the
A18  61 surface. ^This was clearly how to make the most of the time and how
A18  62 best to try to bridge the old Reality-Illusion gap.
A18  63    |^Whether or not \0Mr Drury's moderate tone will be preserved in
A18  64 the speed-up will depend very much on \0Mr Preminger, and if he loses
A18  65 it, the ill-informed abroad may simply become the misinformed, with
A18  66 Washington seeming a melodramatic circus rather than the complex
A18  67 meeting-place of all the States, the focus of a nation's myriad
A18  68 viewpoints. ^\0Mr Preminger's deep Austrian roots may help him there
A18  69 for although now an American citizen, he may see Washington with both
A18  70 an experienced eye and an objective one, which will enable him to find
A18  71 its essence without getting lost in detail or disastrously
A18  72 overglossing. ^His record suggests he is a believer in best-sellers as
A18  73 a basis for a film, and a man who knows him suggests this is because
A18  74 he usually becomes excited about one of the characters. ^This is
A18  75 probably the former actor coming out in him, and certainly on the set
A18  76 he often gives the impression of a caged actor on the wrong side of
A18  77 the camera yearning to give a performance himself. ^This may explain
A18  78 why sometimes his films let personality do the work of imagination and
A18  79 perhaps why they are generally so well cast. ^In *"Advise and
A18  80 Consent,**" for example, he has chosen a group of mature film actors*-
A18  81 men like Ayres, Tone, Fonda, Pidgeon, not to mention Laughton*- who
A18  82 could act most of the younger stars today off the screen.
A18  83    |^The Preminger name seemed to be unlocking most doors in
A18  84 Washington. ^How refreshing then it was for Reality to assert itself
A18  85 in the person of a little tailor. ^One of \0Mr Preminger's assistants
A18  86 went along to his shop to hire some tuxedos for the big banquet scene
A18  87 and assumed he*- or rather \0Mr Preminger*- would naturally be given
A18  88 credit. ^The Preminger name worked no miracles with the little man (he
A18  89 was only little physically) and he threw in for good measure that he
A18  90 would need cash even if the President of the United States came in to
A18  91 hire a tuxedo. ^His image wasn't smooth or glossy or predictable, but,
A18  92 oh, my goodness, he was alive. ^If only all those foreign outsiders
A18  93 could grasp he is more typical of Americans than any of the
A18  94 politicians (even President Kennedy) or any of the film stars (even
A18  95 *"President**" Tone), perhaps Reality would win after all.
A18  96 *<*6FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI*>
A18  97 *<*4by Gareth Lloyd Evans*>
A18  98    |^*4F*2RANCO ZEFFIRELLI, *0whose explosive production of *"Romeo
A18  99 and Juliet**" shook the Old Vic out of its Shakespearean sloth, is now
A18 100 at Stratford on Avon setting the fuses for *"Othello,**" which opens
A18 101 next week. ^Yet, in spite of what we saw at the Old Vic, our
A18 102 expectations for *"Othello,**" and his very name (like a hissing
A18 103 firework) he only occasionally fulfils prognostications of a mercurial
A18 104 Italian. ^Without his long leather black jacket (redolent of
A18 105 Florentine back-street conspiracy) he could be mistaken for a tired
A18 106 young English director uniformed in the easy darkness of black slacks,
A18 107 black sneakers, and dull pullover. ^His accent is slight, his voice
A18 108 even-toned, his gestures spare. ^The eyes are restless, but sometimes
A18 109 pause on you with disconcerting acuteness. ^He slips into first
A18 110 acquaintance easily, and smokes Salems like a furnace.
A18 111    |^From his *"Romeo and Juliet**" one might expect a vivid staccato
A18 112 modern with the customary irreverence for tradition, but the great
A18 113 surprise is his imaginative, eloquent *"feel**" for historical
A18 114 process, and his sense of Western civilisation as an entity. ^He seems
A18 115 to feel his own presence in England now as a reflection of an
A18 116 historical logic which made sixteenth-century England the natural heir
A18 117 of the Florentine renaissance*- this is not conceit, but an implied
A18 118 affirmation of the staying power of cultural unity. ^Florence was the
A18 119 starting-point of Western culture, and for him personally. ^He studied
A18 120 architecture there and began his theatre work directing opera in
A18 121 Siena. ^He mentions other Italian cities ~(*"*1The Romans were the
A18 122 whores of Western civilisation**") *0but Florence penetrates his
A18 123 conversation.
A18 124    |
A18 125    |^*4I*2T *0is easy, say, for a Florentine to accept foreigners, but
A18 126 they do not usually see the reality behind the fac*?6ade of Tuscan
A18 127 easy-going optimism. ^It hides a preoccupation with death, a
A18 128 questioning of what life means, and a practical attitude towards art.
A18 129 ^For Zeffirelli, the genius of the Florentine renaissance lies in its
A18 130 workmanship*- ^*"*1The Tuscans do not believe in fairy tales.**"
A18 131 ^*0Shakespeare, he knows, could never have been in Italy, or he would
A18 132 have realised all this. ^*"Romeo and Juliet**" is very un-Italian*-
A18 133 ^*"*1There are many English girls like Juliet. ^An Italian girl would
A18 134 never dare to do what she did*- they are too practical.**" ^*0But *"As
A18 135 You Like It**" is very Florentine, and full of a workmanlike
A18 136 questioning. ^As he said this he gouged a geometrical pattern on the
A18 137 posh tablecloth of the theatre restaurant. ^He believes himself to be
A18 138 a typical Florentine.
A18 139    |^A limited stake in the Bard might be inferred from the fact that
A18 140 he has directed, in England, two of Shakespeare's *"Mediterranean**"
A18 141 plays. ^He firmly repudiates this. ^He will probably direct
A18 142 *"Hamlet**" soon. ^This should be an event worth waiting for. ^His
A18 143 approach to a play is to discover *"*1one simple idea, the creative
A18 144 idea, like a poet.**" ^*0The idea for *"Romeo and Juliet**" was the
A18 145 irresponsibility of young love pushed into tragedy by Shakespeare.
A18 146 ^*"Othello**" is the *"sentimental**" tragedy of a cultivated, brave
A18 147 man who comes to love too late, and does not know what to do with it.
A18 148 ^*"*1It is a tragedy not to know what to do with love.**"
A18 149 ^*0Zeffirelli does not mention the colour of Othello's skin, but his
A18 150 knife traced another geometrical pattern. ^He gets an idea, and must
A18 151 stick to it. ^In the face of this, I tempted disaster by raising the
A18 152 bogy of cutting Shakespeare, and scholarly interpretation. ^The former
A18 153 he shrugged away, and I assumed that, for him, the *"idea**" justifies
A18 154 the means. ^With the latter he toyed for an instant, then, his smile
A18 155 tightening into patience, he gave the benefice of the preservation of
A18 156 a tradition to the scholar.
A18 157    |
A18 158    |^*4I*2N *0spite of his apparently complete immersion in theatre,
A18 159 there is a paradox in his character. ^He seems unhappy inside the core
A18 160 of his response to all that art means in terms of beauty, vitality,
A18 161 and work. ^He complained that he is always surrounded by theatre
A18 162 people, but one suspects that he would wither away if taken away for
A18 163 too long. ^It may be that his ubiquitous talent (he supervises costume
A18 164 down to the last buttonhole) exhausts him. ^It may be that he is
A18 165 typically Florentine, fighting death along the theatre's shore-line of
A18 166 make-believe. ^One's guess is that the war (he was a partisan) left
A18 167 him immeasurably fearful of what man can do to man.
A18 168    |^He spoke bitterly of Germany. ^The only Brecht play he would
A18 169 consider directing is *"Mother Courage.**" ^*"Alienation**" is
A18 170 contrary to all his beliefs about art and men, but there is more to it
A18 171 than this. ^*"*1Brecht is the Wagner of modern Germany. ^Germany has
A18 172 done terrible things to the soul of man.**" ^*0Perhaps it is
A18 173 sympathetic fear which prompts his friendliness to other people. ^He
A18 174 is at home with scene-shifters, {0ASM}s, and strangers who stop to
A18 175 ask about his high-powered sports car. ^He thinks of a theatre in
A18 176 terms of a family. ^In so far as he can be content, he is so in the
A18 177 British Theatre. ^*"*1You have the best theatre in the world, the best
A18 178 actors, the best audiences.**" ^*0Under pressure he admits some
A18 179 Stratford audiences seemed dead, but ~*"*1English audiences are the
A18 180 best... ^English people live in a pattern, and theatre-going is part
A18 181 of that pattern.**" ^*0He admires English actors for their discipline,
A18 182 *"*1but they have weaknesses.**" ^*0What they were he did not say,
A18 183 except obscurely to declare that you cannot separate the artistic and
A18 184 personal life.
A18 185    |^When the conversation turned away from Shakespeare, from the
A18 186 unequivocally great in the art or the intensely human, Zeffirelli's
A18 187 mind seemed to drop several degrees in temperature. ^Yes, he knew
A18 188 about Wesker and Delaney; yes, they seemed powerful, but all report.
A18 189 ^The trouble was that they were too late, old-fashioned. ^All this
A18 190 naturalism, he says, has been done such a long time ago in France and
A18 191 elsewhere. ^But, implying and mitigating their weakness in one breath,
A18 192 he added that perhaps at the beginning of any movement you had to have
A18 193 *"*1roughness, where things have to be hacked out, until everything
A18 194 runs smoothly.**"

A19   4    |^L*2ONG, *0long ago, \0Mr. Noel Coward wrote an autobiography
A19   5 called *"Present Indicative.**"
A19   6    |^In Part Five he is invited to a house-party, where he meets some
A19   7 of the bright young people of the time.
A19   8    |^*'Their shirts and flannels were yellow and well used against
A19   9 which mine seemed too newly white, too immaculately moulded from
A19  10 musical comedy. ^Their socks, thick and carelessly wrinkled round
A19  11 their ankles, so unlike mine of too thin silk, caught up by intricate
A19  12 suspenders.
A19  13    |^Their conversation, too, struck a traditional note in my ears. ^I
A19  14 seemed to know what they were going to say long before they said it.
A19  15 ^I sensed in their fledgling jokes and light, unsubtle badinage a
A19  16 certain quality of youthfulness that I had never known. ^And although
A19  17 I was the same age, if not younger than many of them, I felt suddenly
A19  18 old, over-experienced and quite definitely out of the picture.**'
A19  19 *<*4No change*>
A19  20    |^T*2HAT *0was in 1922, and \0Mr. Coward hasn't changed a bit. ^For
A19  21 this last couple of weeks he has been shooting off his predictably
A19  22 pursed mouth on the British theatre of today, in the Sunday Times.
A19  23    |^And \0Mr. Coward is still obsessed by the immensely important
A19  24 fact that other people do not dress exactly as he does.
A19  25    |^He still feels old and over-experienced. ^He still has the air of
A19  26 resentful superiority to more successful people. ^And he is still
A19  27 terribly, terribly, definitely out of the picture.
A19  28    |^In fact, the only advance*- and that a slight one*- is that he
A19  29 seems to have stopped writing sentences with no verbs in them.
A19  30    |^Now a man who was too old in 1922 can hardly be expected to have
A19  31 much idea of what is going on in 1961. ^And from \0Mr. Coward's
A19  32 petulant, bewildered, inaccurate, and shabby attack on the playwrights
A19  33 and players of today anyone foolish enough to trust him as a guide to
A19  34 the current theatrical scene would get a quite lunatic idea of what
A19  35 was going on in it.
A19  36 *<*4Success*>
A19  37    |^T*2HEY *0would not learn, for instance, that our stages are
A19  38 fuller of good stuff, and our auditoriums of enthusiastic audiences,
A19  39 than for many years.
A19  40    |^They would have no idea that the current British theatrical
A19  41 renaissance is having an effect far beyond the West End of London, so
A19  42 that Broadway is heavily influenced by the highly successful plays of
A19  43 today that it has imported from Britain.
A19  44    |^They would never discover that our writers and players are
A19  45 exciting as well as excited, that they speak in tones of passion and
A19  46 belief and deep, proud faith. ^They would not be told that the
A19  47 technical accomplishment displayed by some of these members of our New
A19  48 Wave is astonishing in its range and completeness.
A19  49    |^Above all, they would never, never know that the New Wave*- and
A19  50 it is the one thing that \0Mr. Coward can no more forgive than he can
A19  51 understand*- is supremely successful, or that his own latest offering
A19  52 to Britain's ungrateful stage (*"Waiting in the Wings**") is being
A19  53 withdrawn shortly, having failed, as they say in the profession, to
A19  54 attract an audience.

A19  58 audiences out of the theatrical dark and into the bright, brave
A19  59 noonday where it is always perfect anyone-for-tennis weather, and
A19  60 where nothing as vulgar and squalid as a stove is ever mentioned, but
A19  61 where lots of nice, jolly, fun-giving adultery*- to the immense,
A19  62 brittle amusement of The Master*- is.
A19  63    |^I think it is time that the case for the British theatre of today
A19  64 was made, and made loud and clear. ^Hitherto it has had nothing but
A19  65 its talent and its success to speak for it against the well-bred
A19  66 sneers (getting a little tight around the jaw-muscles by now) of those
A19  67 whom the New Wave has been washing higher and drier up the beach.
A19  68    |^It is ridiculous, to begin with, to speak in the same breath of
A19  69 such vastly diverse talents and outlooks as those of John Osborne,
A19  70 Robert Bolt, Arnold Wesker, John Mortimer, Shelagh Delaney, John
A19  71 Arden, {0N. F.} Simpson, Harold Pinter, Lionel Bart, Peter Shaffer,
A19  72 Willis Hall. ^They write about a gigantic range of different people,
A19  73 classes, and situations.
A19  74    |^\0Mr. Bolt in *"A Man for All Seasons,**" took us to the Court of
A19  75 Henry *=8, and in *"The Tiger and the Horse**" to an Oxford college.
A19  76    |^In the one, a dark, rich portrait of a saint wrestling with his
A19  77 conscience; in the other, an agonisingly brilliant study of a half-man
A19  78 who grows whole under the impact of tragedy.
A19  79 *<*4Exquisite*>
A19  80    |^*4\0M*2R. WESKER, *0in his exquisite trilogy, ranges from the
A19  81 pre-war East End of London to the post-war Norfolk, from the
A19  82 semi-literate old Jewish immigrants to the intense and musical young
A19  83 Ronnie, from the dying of the old to the rebirth of the young.
A19  84    |^\0Mr. Shaffer, in his mercilessly observed *"Five Finger
A19  85 Exercise,**" and \0Mr. Mortimer, in his *"The Wrong Side of the
A19  86 Park,**" explored the hearts of characters middle-class enough to
A19  87 satisfy even \0Mr. Coward.
A19  88    |^From \0Mr. Mortimer and \0Mr. Simpson we have come to expect wit,
A19  89 style and elegance*- three things that the false prophets of decay try
A19  90 to tell us have disappeared from our stages. ^And \0Mr. Simpson's
A19  91 lunatic logic has a freshness, a lightness about it that would make
A19  92 *"Waiting in the Wings**" seem bad even if it weren't.
A19  93    |^From Miss Delaney we get the authentic accents of the young; and
A19  94 from \0Mr. Bart we get a large number of very good tunes, which some
A19  95 more traditional quarters have found hard to come by lately. ^In
A19  96 short, from them all we get a huge, bursting cornucopia of every kind
A19  97 of writing, every kind of plot, every kind of setting, every kind of
A19  98 character.
A19  99 *<*4Belief*>
A19 100    |^A*2ND *0to all this theatrical richness, the poor darling dodos
A19 101 can only squeak *"kitchen sink**" and *"dustbin**" drama. ^In fact,
A19 102 only one play in the last few years has had a dustbin in it, and that
A19 103 was by an Irishman who writes in French. ^Only one has a kitchen sink
A19 104 in it, and that one*- \0Mr. Wesker's*- was the one which above all
A19 105 proclaimed its faith in beauty, goodness, and truth, and turned
A19 106 savagely to rend squalor and those who perpetuate it.
A19 107    |^Which brings me to what I think is the clue*- the common factor
A19 108 shared by many of our younger playwrights, and the element which above
A19 109 all produces uncomprehending rage in \0Mr. Coward.

A19 113    |^A*2T *0the top of 14 uncarpeted stairs in a Notting Hill mews
A19 114 lives Christopher Logue, poet. ^*"Come up and have a drink,**" he
A19 115 yelled out of the window. ^I went up and lay down.
A19 116    |^This was obligatory, because Logue owns one typewriter, 500
A19 117 books, and almost no furniture. ^I lay on the bed. ^Logue lay on the
A19 118 floor. ^The only chair in the room was occupied by Burns Singer, a
A19 119 Scottish poet who chain-smoked cigarettes made out of loose tobacco,
A19 120 and remarked from time to time: ^*"Do \2ye not find the whisky in
A19 121 London terrible?**"
A19 122    |^Nobody seems to care about any modern poet nowadays except John
A19 123 Betjeman, who writes agreeably in praise of buttered toast and railway
A19 124 stations, and became a best seller almost By Appointment after
A19 125 Princess Margaret said she liked his verse.
A19 126    |^But what are the other fellows up to? ^How do they live? ^I got
A19 127 some interesting answers from Logue and Singer, and later from an
A19 128 American, Theodore Roethke, who has actually made poetry pay.
A19 129 *<*4Money*>
A19 130    |^C*2HRISTOPHER LOGUE *0is a dark, narrow, energetic man of 34. ^If
A19 131 he were an actor, I would type-cast him as Shakespeare's Iago.
A19 132    |^He has published half a dozen books of poetry and achieved a
A19 133 wider reputation when he wrote the lyrics for the Royal Court Theatre
A19 134 musical *"The Lily-White Boys.**"
A19 135    |^*"I actually made quite good money then,**" said Logue. ^*"For
A19 136 the eight weeks the show ran I earned *+85 a week. ^But that
A19 137 represented six months' work, don't forget. ^Average it out and you
A19 138 see I was really getting less than a waiter.**"
A19 139 *<*4Noisy*>
A19 140    |^A *2CURRENT *0book of poetry, *"Songs,**" has earned Logue *+100.
A19 141 ^He was paid exactly that for one article in the American teenage
A19 142 magazine Mademoiselle.
A19 143    |^Christopher Logue writes fierce, noisy poems about war, love, and
A19 144 Logue. ^Son of a Southampton civil servant, he was brought up by
A19 145 Jesuits.
A19 146    |^*"I now believe in the total abolition of private property,**" he
A19 147 said.
A19 148    |^He got up off the floor, rattled some coal into the stove, and
A19 149 lay down again.
A19 150    |^A gleam of gold shone in the front teeth of Burns Singer as he
A19 151 lit his fifth home-made cigarette. ^He said: ^*"Of course, Christopher
A19 152 believes that propaganda and politics are part of poetry.
A19 153    |^*"For me, it's different. ^It's almost like psychoanalysis. ^I'll
A19 154 do no work for weeks and then write solidly for 12 hours. ^I think
A19 155 what I'm really seeking all the time is the source of Original Sin in
A19 156 myself.**"
A19 157    |^Logue leaped to his feet at this heresy and shouted: ^*"Original
A19 158 Sin! ^What are you talking about?**"
A19 159    |^Logue looks like a man who would punch anybody on the nose. ^But
A19 160 then who could punch Burns Singer? ^A mass of gold hair frames his
A19 161 face, he has the air of a spiritualised Viking whom the bigger men
A19 162 left at home when they set out in their long-prowed ships to raid
A19 163 England.
A19 164 *<*4Flames*>
A19 165    |^*"J*2IMMY**" *0to his friends, Burns Singer is actually the son
A19 166 of a Glaswegian mother and a Jewish salesman from Manchester. ^I count
A19 167 him the most inflammable poet on the English scene, because the way he
A19 168 showers burning tobacco strands on his flossy gold beard he is bound
A19 169 to go up in flames one day.
A19 170    |^In love, he wrote:*-

A19 180 ago. ^She is a New York-born Negress with a Harley-street practice in
A19 181 psychotherapy.
A19 182    |^Dreamers only part of the time, poets show an acute interest in

A19 186 the {0B.B.C.} go down to 10\0d. a line for longer broadcast works.
A19 187 ^Poets write reviews and do journalism to make a living.
A19 188    |^*"I'm never sloppy about money,**" said Christopher Logue in a
A19 189 raging voice. ^*"I want a car. ^I want to eat out in restaurants. ^You
A19 190 know who I'd like to be? ^I'd like to be president of {0U.S.}

A19 193 Laboratory, said: ^*"I'd like to be Spyros \0K. Skouras. ^I just fancy
A19 194 the glamour of working in films.**"
A19 195 *<*4Professor*>
A19 196    |^T*2HE *0world does not owe poets a living, but it pays more than
A19 197 a modest competence to Theodore Roethke (pronounced \5ret-key), a

A19 199 to live in one in smart Belgravia during his London visit.
A19 200    |^Dwarfing a glass of sherry with his big hand, 52-year-old Roethke

A19 205    |^But the amount he gets by actually writing poetry and getting it

A19 211 poetry,**" said Roethke. ^*"I doubt if anybody does, except maybe
A19 212 Robert Frost.**"

A20   4 *<*4{0B.A.O.R.} Will Get Key Men*>
A20   5 *<*6SMALL CALL-UP POSSIBLE*>
A20   6 *<*6BY OUR MILITARY REPORTER*>
A20   7    |^*4P*2LANS *0for strengthening Britain's strategic reserve
A20   8 division will be announced by \0Mr Watkinson, Minister of Defence, in
A20   9 the Commons this week. ^Some units have been recently redeployed to
A20  10 form a division for service in Germany should the situation there
A20  11 continue to deteriorate.
A20  12    |^No indication has been given of what this increase will be, or
A20  13 where the troops will be found. ^While conscription can be ruled out,
A20  14 it may be that some limited numbers of reserve units may be affected.
A20  15 ^Steps have been taken to meet some key deficiencies in {0B.A.O.R.}
A20  16 by transferring about 100 ancillary troops from overseas.
A20  17    |^As {0B.A.O.R.} is short of specialists it is likely that the
A20  18 strategic reserve division in Britain is also deficient, and to bring
A20  19 it to full strength it is unlikely that further depletion of overseas
A20  20 garrisons can be countenanced.
A20  21 *<*7AMERICAN CRITICISM*>
A20  22    |^*0How far Britain's moves to strengthen her reserves will meet
A20  23 American criticism remains to be seen. ^But it is unlikely that
A20  24 America's plan for a three-stage defence structure will be followed.
A20  25    |^Under this plan Washington aims to meet an initial enemy
A20  26 conventional onslaught with conventional weapons. ^If these fail
A20  27 tactical nuclear weapons will be used, and finally strategic nuclear
A20  28 weapons.
A20  29    |^But the British defence policy, as laid down in the 1957 Sandys
A20  30 Plan, is showing signs of wobbling. ^Defence spokesmen now qualify the
A20  31 statement that nuclear retaliation would be used in any major Russian
A20  32 aggression by saying that the use of nuclear weapons would depend on
A20  33 the circumstances, strength and area of the attack.
A20  34    |^Privately, some defence officials go even further and say that
A20  35 the original Sandys policy is *"dead as a dodo.**"
A20  36 *<*6\DE GAULLE WILL SEE PREMIER ON BERLIN*>
A20  37 *<*6BY GORDON BROOK-SHEPHERD*>
A20  38 *<*4Sunday Telegraph Diplomatic Correspondent*>
A20  39    |^*4P*2RESIDENT *0and Madame \de Gaulle will pay a private visit to
A20  40 Britain from \0Nov. 24 to 26 as guests of \0Mr Macmillan and his wife.
A20  41 ^A French statement on the visit said both leaders felt the time had
A20  42 come for *"a frank exchange of views on the international situation
A20  43 and especially about the tactics to be adopted towards easing tension
A20  44 with Russia.**"
A20  45    |^It is believed in London that nearly all the weekend visit will
A20  46 be devoted to what one British official described as *"quiet and
A20  47 intense business talks.**"
A20  48    |^I understand the main purpose of the meeting will be to plot an
A20  49 agreed Western approach to the Berlin and German issues. ^At present
A20  50 the West is moving forward in a sort of ragged Indian file with the
A20  51 French almost out of contact in the rear.
A20  52 *<*4Concession Made*>
A20  53    |^*0In the last few days General \de Gaulle is reported to have won
A20  54 what amounts to an important concession from his allies. ^A major
A20  55 policy switch has been tentatively agreed between the British,
A20  56 Americans and West Germans which partly reflects the French line of
A20  57 remaining *"tough**" with \0Mr Khruschev.
A20  58    |^It is understood that the British and American envoys in Moscow
A20  59 have been empowered if necessary to seek an emergency standstill
A20  60 agreement with the Russians on the Berlin situation alone as a first
A20  61 step to broader negotiations. ^This could be informal in the sense
A20  62 that no document need be signed.
A20  63 *<*4Short-term Basis*>
A20  64    |^*0It could be reached at ambassadorial level, taking the form of
A20  65 an East-West declaration re-affirming Allied rights and
A20  66 responsibilities in Berlin, if only on a short-term basis. ^The
A20  67 purpose would be to remove the fuse from the Berlin bomb.
A20  68    |^This approach would represent a complete change of strategy from
A20  69 that favoured in the talks with the Soviet Foreign Minister, \0Mr.
A20  70 Gromyko, less than a month ago. ^Then the Anglo-American emphasis was
A20  71 on seeking a broader agenda to avoid a debate on the vulnerable
A20  72 question of Berlin alone.
A20  73    |^French and West German fears that such a broader agenda would
A20  74 involve the West in dangerous concessions have contributed to the
A20  75 latest change. ^So has the mounting tension in Berlin.
A20  76    |^The West now seems to have adopted \0Mr. Khruschev's famous
A20  77 *"salami**" tactics in trying to solve the problem slice by slice. ^If
A20  78 a short term stabilisation agreement can be reached on Berlin in the
A20  79 next few weeks the problem of increasing contacts between East and
A20  80 West Germany could be tackled as a separate step.
A20  81    |^The final phase would be a formal top level agreement.
A20  82    |^The possibility is not ruled out in London that \0Mr. Khruschev
A20  83 may try to exploit President Kennedy's impatience with Western
A20  84 differences of opinion. ^This he would do by trying to bargain direct
A20  85 with Washington.
A20  86 *<*4Private Contacts*>
A20  87    |^*0As part of this campaign an invitation may well be sent to the
A20  88 American Secretary of State, \0Mr. Dean Rusk, to visit Moscow.
A20  89    |^The Russians are thought to have been encouraged along these
A20  90 lines by the progress made in New York towards solving the United
A20  91 Nations crisis through repeated private contacts between the Soviet
A20  92 and American chief delegates there, \0Mr. Zorin and \0Mr. Stevenson.
A20  93 *<*6RUSSIA AND CHINA IN STRUGGLE FOR AFRICA*>
A20  94 *<BY OUR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT*>
A20  95    |^*4N*2EW *0evidence has reached London of the struggle between the
A20  96 Russians and the Chinese to dominate the mind of Africa. ^It
A20  97 illustrates that global rivalry between Peking and Moscow, of which
A20  98 the current dispute over Albania is only the symbol.
A20  99    |^In at least one of the new African states, Somalia, the two
A20 100 Communist powers have begun to clash head-on. ^The Russians, who have
A20 101 built up a huge Embassy with a staff of nearly 300 in Mogadishu, the
A20 102 capital, support the established Government.
A20 103    |^The Chinese operate through a smaller mission, but have a New
A20 104 China News Agency in addition, whereas the Russians have no Tass
A20 105 representation. ^The Chinese policy is one of outright support for the
A20 106 dissident opposition groups, including the extremist Pan-Somali
A20 107 Movement.
A20 108    |^This aims at uniting all Somalis, including those in neighbouring
A20 109 Kenya and Ethiopia, under one rule.
A20 110    |^Chinese support takes the form of secret money subsidies, and the
A20 111 inviting of Somali dissidents to Peking. ^Here some of them are said
A20 112 to have been given guerrilla training, on the pattern recently
A20 113 reported for candidates from the Cameroun Republic.
A20 114 *<*4Moscow Concern*>
A20 115    |^*0Russian disavowal of the Pan-Somalis is partly based on
A20 116 Moscow's concern for good relations with Ethiopia, where a major
A20 117 Soviet effort is being made. ^But the issue is also a basic
A20 118 ideological one.
A20 119    |^Throughout Africa, the Chinese are putting forward their militant
A20 120 brand of Communism as the true model for the new black states and are
A20 121 openly decrying the more moderate Soviet line.
A20 122    |^To support this campaign, the Chinese have developed a radio
A20 123 propaganda barrage nearly twice as heavy as the Russian effort.
A20 124 ^Peking Radio now has a total output of 91 hours a week broadcasting
A20 125 to Africa. ^This is far more than any other station in the world and
A20 126 compares with the Soviet Union's tally of 54 1/2 hours a week.
A20 127    |^Seven different Chinese agencies have been identified running
A20 128 operations inside Africa itself. ^All have been founded in the last 18
A20 129 months and three sprang into life this year.
A20 130 *<*4The Difference*>
A20 131    |^*0They operate along unorthodox but highly effective lines.
A20 132 ^Whereas the Russians keep mainly to standard cultural missions and
A20 133 student training schemes, the Chinese get down to jungle roots.
A20 134    |^They are covering the dark continent with troupes of acrobats,
A20 135 dancers and jugglers who travel from village to village. ^Needless to
A20 136 say the jugglers start spinning Marxist slogans as soon as they have
A20 137 finished their advertised act.
A20 138    |^The Somali pattern of more or less open conflict is repeated in
A20 139 Guinea. ^The other main centres of Chinese penetration are the Cote
A20 140 \d'Ivoire, Zanzibar and Mozambique.
A20 141    |^A major Chinese agitation is predicted by Western observers soon
A20 142 among the black population of South Africa. ^This would give Peking a
A20 143 hold on the tip of the continent, as well as at strategic points up
A20 144 both the East and the West coasts.

A20 148 *<*6BERLIN, *4Saturday.*>
A20 149    |^*6T*2HE *0withdrawal of Russian and American tanks from the
A20 150 Friedrichstrasse crossing point today brought some relaxation of
A20 151 tension in Berlin. ^But the opposing tanks remained within a mile of
A20 152 each other.
A20 153    |^First to back down in the war of nerves were the Russians, and as
A20 154 their T-34 tanks rumbled away an American official was heard to say:
A20 155 ^*"We seem to have faced the Russian Ivan.**" ^About 90 minutes later
A20 156 the 10 American tanks retired.
A20 157    |^The Americans have now stated that they intend for the time being
A20 158 to give up their practice of enforcing their right of uncontrolled
A20 159 access to East Berlin by sending officials through the
A20 160 Friedrichstrasse checkpoint with armed escorts. ^They say, *"our point
A20 161 has now been made.**"
A20 162 *<*4{0U.S.} plane's defiance*>
A20 163    |^*0Less than half an hour after the American tanks had withdrawn,
A20 164 a United States Air Force C-47 defied a Russian protest against
A20 165 overflying East Berlin. ^It circled for about ten minutes at about 600
A20 166 feet over an area where 40 Russian tanks were parked.
A20 167    |^\0Col. Soloviev, the Russian Commandant in Berlin last night sent
A20 168 two letters to the American Commandant, one of which protested against
A20 169 United States helicopters flying over East Berlin. ^The American
A20 170 mission in Berlin today said their planes have every right to fly over
A20 171 all of the city.
A20 172    |^Up to this morning it had seemed that the dangerous situation
A20 173 that built up suddenly at dusk last night when the Russian tanks
A20 174 arrived might continue indefinitely. ^Angry West Berliners twice
A20 175 mobbed Russian cars, booing and kicking the vehicles.
A20 176    |^Before the departure of the Russian tanks the East German
A20 177 Communists staged a propaganda demonstration by sending youths and
A20 178 girls to present the crews with flowers and chocolates. ^Earlier, West
A20 179 Berlin civilians had taken flowers to the crews of the two foremost
A20 180 American tanks.
A20 181    |^It had been reported that more Russian tanks have reached East
A20 182 Berlin. ^I drove through the Eastern sector but saw nothing more than
A20 183 military jeeps outside the ruins of the Prinzenpalais in Unter \den
A20 184 Linden, where the first Russian tanks were based 48 hours ago.
A20 185    |^At *"checkpoint Charlie**" my passport was examined by Communist
A20 186 guards and I was asked if I was carrying East German money, coffee or
A20 187 cocoa. ^The only civilian in sight was a grey-haired woman who said
A20 188 she had lost her way but gave the impression she had hoped to slip
A20 189 through to the West.

A20 194 inspection of the British Army of the Rhine. ^He said he was more
A20 195 worried after his visit than before.
A20 196    |^Although no units were dangerously undermanned, the Army was a
A20 197 few thousand short of its peacetime establishment and well below the
A20 198 strength that would be needed in war. ^There was a particular shortage
A20 199 of men in medical units.
A20 200    |^In equipment there was a shortage of radios, some arms and
A20 201 armoured personnel carriers.
A20 202    |^Britain's commitment in Europe should be given top priority.
A20 203 ^Other overseas commitments, particularly in the Far East, should be
A20 204 re-examined to see if such large numbers of men need be tied down.
A20 205 ^Conscription was not the answer to the need for men.
A20 206    |^Asked if Britain was capable of fulfilling its role in the North
A20 207 Atlantic Treaty Organisation, he replied: ^*"We are as well able to do
A20 208 it as anyone else.
A20 209    |^*"The men are well trained and well deployed. ^But it is the role
A20 210 of the whole {0N.A.T.O.} army that worries me and our role in that.
A20 211    |^*"While I am clear myself on what that role is, I am not sure
A20 212 whether the politicians' statements are clear to the military generals
A20 213 and to Air Force chiefs.**"

A21   3 *<*5More troops ready to go*>
A21   4 *<*7NEWS OF THE WORLD DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT*>
A21   5    |^*4M*2ORE *4British troops, aircraft and warships are racing to
A21   6 Kuwait this morning from Germany, Cyprus, Kenya and even the Far East.
A21   7 ^The British military authorities describe the operation as *"a very
A21   8 rapid build-up.**"
A21   9    |^*0In New York the Security Council is meeting at 11 {0a.m.}
A21  10 today at the special request of both Britain and Kuwait. ^And in
A21  11 Washington the State Department of the United States has endorsed
A21  12 Britain's show of force, expressing the hope that it will help to
A21  13 assure the preservation of peace.
A21  14    |^In London yesterday, as the first British troops and aircraft
A21  15 went in and Royal Navy warships circled in the off-shore Gulf
A21  16 heat-haze \0Mr. Macmillan called an emergency meeting of Cabinet
A21  17 Ministers and Service Chiefs. ^\0Mr. Hugh Gaitskell, Leader of the
A21  18 Opposition, went to Admiralty House to hear the inside story of the
A21  19 situation from the Premier.
A21  20    |^*4Then last night at Bowood, Calne, \0Wilts, the Premier,
A21  21 speaking to the Wessex area Conservative Rally, explained what the
A21  22 Government is doing about the threat by Premier Kassem of Iraq to
A21  23 annexe Kuwait*- and why.
A21  24    |^*0*"I still trust that threats against Kuwait are no more than
A21  25 words and that the Government of Iraq will refrain from any aggressive
A21  26 action,**" he said.
A21  27    |^But he added, ^*"We must take no risk and in view of the language
A21  28 that is being used and the indications of a military build-up which
A21  29 may threaten Kuwait, we have thought it right to respond to the urgent
A21  30 and formal request which the ruler has made to us that we should give
A21  31 him some protectionary strength.**"
A21  32 *<*6TANKS*>
A21  33    |^*0\0Mr. Gaitskell, speaking at Bristol, said he could not see how
A21  34 Britain could have refused to help Kuwait. ^But our troops should not
A21  35 stay there a day longer than necessary. ^The United Nations should be
A21  36 asked to put in a force to replace them as soon as possible.
A21  37    |^The first British troops in, about 600 Royal Marines of 42
A21  38 Commando and 150 men of the Third Dragoon Guards with 14 Centurion
A21  39 tanks, went ashore at Kuwait in a shade temperature of 120 degrees.
A21  40    |^*4The Marines had come racing up the searingly hot Persian Gulf
A21  41 in the Royal Navy carrier Bulwark, which set out from Karachi on
A21  42 Thursday.
A21  43    |^*0And the Dragoon Guards were put ashore from the tank landing
A21  44 ship Striker, which arrived with an amphibious warfare squadron.
A21  45    |^Almost simultaneously a squadron of {0R.A.F.} Hawker Hunter jet
A21  46 fighters came screaming in for a landing. ^They are believed to have
A21  47 flown from Kenya.
A21  48    |^Off-shore, meanwhile, the British frigate Loch Alvie and the
A21  49 vessels of the amphibious warfare squadron circled before anchoring,
A21  50 apparently just outside the three-mile limit.
A21  51 *<*6ALERTED*>
A21  52    |^*0Soon afterwards it was announced in Kuwait that an unknown
A21  53 number of Saudi Arabian troops had also arrived. ^And that eight
A21  54 {0R.A.F.} Canberra jet bombers from Germany had reached the Persian
A21  55 Gulf air base at Sharjah.
A21  56    |^Two squadrons of Canberra bombers from Cyprus were reported to
A21  57 have arrived at Aden on their way to Kuwait.
A21  58    |^*4Men of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiments and the 2nd
A21  59 Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in Cyprus were said to have been
A21  60 alerted for a move.
A21  61    |^*0And from Kenya there were reports that the men of the
A21  62 Coldstream Guards and King's Regiment were soon ready to be airlifted
A21  63 North as soon as aircraft became available.
A21  64    |^*4In Kuwait *0plans were being made to evacuate the 3,000 or so
A21  65 Britons who live there. ^But it was stated officially that there are
A21  66 no thoughts of evacuation unless the situation deteriorates seriously.
A21  67    |^And the Kuwait Supreme Council announced that the frontier with
A21  68 Iraq had been closed.
A21  69 *<*4Terms before we join Common Market*>
A21  70    |^B*2RITAIN *0has made it quite clear that she must make conditions
A21  71 before joining the Common Market *"in its present form,**" said \0Mr.
A21  72 {0R. A.} Butler yesterday.
A21  73    |^*"We are determined to safeguard the interests of our farmers,
A21  74 our Commonwealth partners and our friends in the European Free Trade
A21  75 Association,**" he told Conservatives at Harrogate.
A21  76    |^\0Mr. Butler, who was speaking as Chairman of the Conservative
A21  77 Party, said no decision had yet been reached even to enter into formal
A21  78 negotiations for joining.
A21  79    |^If we reached some agreement there would have to be major
A21  80 changes, he said. ^He warned that industry would have to face more
A21  81 competition from European goods.
A21  82    |^A paper published yesterday by the non-Party {0P.E.P.}
A21  83 (Political and Economic Planning) says most British farmers will not
A21  84 be adversely affected if Britain joins the Market.
A21  85    |^Some farmers might gain. ^But horticulturists *"would have to
A21  86 meet keener competition unless imports were restricted by some other
A21  87 means than tariffs.**"
A21  88    |^The National Farmers' Union said the {0P.E.P.} study did not
A21  89 show that farmers would be as well-off on a long-term basis under
A21  90 Common Market terms.
A21  91 *<*6NOW KRUSCHEV HOTS UP THE BERLIN CRISIS*>
A21  92 *<*4From *6\0A. NOYES THOMAS*>
A21  93 *<*2WEST BERLIN, *0Saturday.*>
A21  94    |^*4\0M*2R. KRUSCHEV *0today made two ominous moves*- and another
A21  95 threatening statement*- on the heightening German crisis. ^He
A21  96 suspended all planned reductions in Soviet armed forces. ^He
A21  97 stepped-up Soviet military expenditure by more than 30 per cent. ^And
A21  98 he said:*-
A21  99    |^*4*"We shall sign a peace treaty with East Germany and order our
A21 100 armed forces to administer a worthy rebuff to any aggressor if he
A21 101 raises his hand against the Soviet Union or our friends.
A21 102    |^*0*"It is best for those who think of war not to imagine that
A21 103 distance will save them. ... ^We have everything at our disposal to
A21 104 solve successfully the responsible tasks facing us.**"
A21 105    |^The speech, broadcast by Moscow radio, coincided with a meeting
A21 106 on the Berlin and German problem between President Kennedy and his top
A21 107 advisers.
A21 108 *<*5Razor edge*>
A21 109    |^*0And while the Soviet leader was talking the Nato Council in
A21 110 Paris received from Washington the text of a Note which the United
A21 111 States Government will shortly deliver to the Kremlin.
A21 112    |^*4The contents of the Note, which is in reply to one handed to
A21 113 President Kennedy in Vienna on June 4, are not known. ^But it is
A21 114 believed to reject \0Mr. Kruschev's demands.
A21 115    |^*0As the news pours in from around the world, beleagured **[SIC**]
A21 116 Berlin this weekend is a city on a razor's edge.
A21 117    |^Until 24 hours or so ago West Berliners, who have been building
A21 118 up vast stocks of food against the possibility of another siege of
A21 119 their city, believed the West was determined to stand fast in the face
A21 120 of all Communist threats.
A21 121    |^But then from Washington came seemingly authoritative reports
A21 122 that the Americans might not be prepared to risk war on these issues
A21 123 after all.
A21 124    |^From this distance it appears that the United States Government
A21 125 is ready to accept East German control of the West's tenuous
A21 126 life-lines through the Communist Zone to the isolated city.
A21 127    |^I have just had a long talk with the man at the centre of the
A21 128 crisis, Herr Willy Brandt, Mayor of West Berlin and a strong candidate
A21 129 for the Chancellorship of Western Germany.
A21 130    |^Kruschev, he believes, has become *"a prisoner of his own
A21 131 words.**" ^After years of bluffing over East Germany and West Berlin
A21 132 the Soviet leader is faced at last with the necessity of doing
A21 133 something about it, whether he likes it or not.
A21 134    |^One reason: to satisfy the impatient leaders of impoverished,
A21 135 struggling East Germany who, says Herr Brandt, in many respects tend
A21 136 to be more Russian than the Russians.
A21 137    |^Herr Brandt has no doubt whatsoever that \0Mr. Kruschev really
A21 138 does intend this time to make a separate peace treaty with East
A21 139 Germany.
A21 140    |^*4Privately, though, Herr Brandt is not at all convinced that the
A21 141 Russians see eye to eye with the East Germans over a change in the
A21 142 status of West Berlin.
A21 143    |^*0This in spite of the fact that Soviet propaganda frequently
A21 144 refers to the present set-up as *"a thorn in the flesh,**" *"a bone in
A21 145 the throat**" and *"a base for hostile, provocative activity.**"
A21 146    |^*"Look at it this way,**" says the young handsome mayor ^*"Every
A21 147 week between 4,000 and 5,000 East Germans escape into West Germany,
A21 148 many of them through West Berlin.
A21 149    |^*"Every day crowds of East Berliners come into West Berlin to
A21 150 goggle at the prosperity here before returning to their own drab side
A21 151 of the city where, 16 years after the war, meat and butter are still
A21 152 rationed.
A21 153    |^*"All this is galling to the East German authorities, but the
A21 154 Russians, I suspect, see West Berlin as a safety valve. ^It calms the
A21 155 feelings of many in East Germany to know that their symbol of freedom
A21 156 is here, close by; to know that there is a way out.
A21 157    |^*"Remove that safety valve and things might begin to happen in
A21 158 East Germany. ^Not a revolution, maybe. ^But sabotage, more go-slow
A21 159 campaigns, all kinds of passive resistance.**"
A21 160    |^Herr Brandt believes that until now the Russians have actually
A21 161 vetoed East German plans to stop the flow of refugees.
A21 162    |^Today Gerhard Eiseler, the East German propaganda chief, made a
A21 163 speech hinting at a new war of nerves against West Berlin.
A21 164    |^Says Herr Brandt: ^*"If it comes it may be far less dramatic,
A21 165 though no less dangerous, than most people expect.**"
A21 166    |^He cannot see it taking as blunt a turn as a new blockade on the
A21 167 scale of the last one.

A21 169 *<*4By The Chancellor*>
A21 170 *<*5We've got to pull up our socks*>
A21 171 *<*2BY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT*>
A21 172    |^*4G*2RIM-FACED *4and speaking with quiet emphasis, \0Mr. Selwyn
A21 173 Lloyd gave the country a tough pep talk yesterday. ^Come on, Britain,
A21 174 we've got to pull up our socks*- that was the burden of his fighting
A21 175 speech in which he announced that he will tell the House of Commons on
A21 176 Tuesday week the means he proposes to take to get Britain out of the
A21 177 red.
A21 178    |^*0He added that on this *"Little Budget Day**" he will recommend
A21 179 *"such action as I think necessary, however unpopular or
A21 180 unexpected.**"
A21 181    |^*4*"I am not afraid,**" he said, *"to ask the British people to
A21 182 bear the necessary burdens or accept the necessary disciplines
A21 183 designed to secure not just the survival but also the maintenance of
A21 184 our position as an up-to-date, progressive, dynamic influence on the
A21 185 world.**"
A21 186    |^*0Today the Chancellor will go to Chequers to join a Cabinet
A21 187 house-party where his new measures to deal with Britain's financial
A21 188 crisis will be on the agenda.
A21 189    |^Here are other points from his speech yesterday, delivered at a
A21 190 Conservative fete at Hawarden, Flintshire.
A21 191    |^*"The trade balance at the present time, in spite of better
A21 192 figures announced yesterday is unsatisfactory.
A21 193    |^*"In a tough competitive world, we as a nation are not doing well
A21 194 enough. ^That is not a new discovery. ^I have warned the country again
A21 195 and again of this since I became Chancellor.
A21 196 **[END QUOTE**]
A21 197 *<*6THE TASK*>
A21 198    |^*0*"The time is long past when as individuals, or as a nation we
A21 199 can expect to live beyond our means. ^In the long run, as individuals,
A21 200 we cannot take out in real income more than we contribute in
A21 201 production or services.
A21 202    |^*"We cannot achieve stability, let alone speed up our economic
A21 203 growth, until we have made an improvement in our export performance
A21 204 far beyond anything we have yet achieved.
A21 205    |^*"We cannot hope to do this without a tougher and more
A21 206 competitive spirit in industry, a far more critical attitude towards
A21 207 costs, whatever their origin, a relentless rooting-out of all
A21 208 inefficiency, restrictiveness and waste, whether it be of capital
A21 209 resources or of labour.
A21 210    |^*4*"We cannot afford the restrictive practices, whether of
A21 211 management or labour, that are far too readily accepted now.
A21 212    |^*0*"We cannot afford the easy complacency with which increases in
A21 213 costs derived from these and similar inefficiencies are added to
A21 214 prices in the confidence that the customer will pay.
A21 215    |^*"It is not just a matter of working a good deal harder before we
A21 216 really earn the incomes that are paid.
A21 217    |^*"Harder work is needed; but above all we need more drive and
A21 218 better direction, more efficiency and economy in our effort.
A21 219 **[END QUOTE**]
A21 220 *<*6OVERDRAWN*>
A21 221    |^*0*"And an inner conviction that these things really matter*- and
A21 222 indeed are essential if we are not to slip back into becoming a
A21 223 second-rate economy with declining standards of living.
A21 224    |^*"We cannot reward ourselves in advance of actual achievement by

A22 106 superbly-headed goal in the first half. ^But never was his punch and
A22 107 pace needed so much as now by his gasping, back-pedalling team-mates.
A22 108    |^There were ten minutes left. ^Arsenal strutted. ^Arsenal looked
A22 109 mighty good...
A22 110    |^But tiny Terry wagged his foot at a Cliff Jones corner and the
A22 111 ball was scrambled home for a dramatic Spurs equaliser.
A22 112    |^Arsenal descended on referee Reg Leafe in an angry swarm. ^Dyson
A22 113 had handled, they said. ^Leafe decisively let the goal stand.
A22 114    |^The Gunners and their fans were still fuming when Dyson lammed in
A22 115 Spurs' match-winner off the post.
A22 116    |^This is a good Arsenal side. ^They will not meet Dyson's devilish
A22 117 opportunism every week. ^And they won't have so much bad luck.
A22 118    |^Their first-half inferiority was caused by the total inability of
A22 119 Mel Charles to get by centre half Maurice Norman.
A22 120    |^Mel wandered like a big boy lost. ^In that time a Les Allen
A22 121 header put Spurs one up, and Dyson got the second.
A22 122    |^Arsenal keeper McLelland, who had to leave the field three
A22 123 minutes before the end after colliding with Allen, has slight
A22 124 concussion.
A22 125 *<*6LESLIE IN SPIN TRAP*>
A22 126 *<*4Wolves 3, West Ham 2: By *6STAN HALSEY*>
A22 127    |^WEST HAM *4took the lead in eighteen minutes. ^Musgrove
A22 128 side-stepped a defender and scored a masterly goal with a twenty-yard
A22 129 rising drive. ^And though Murray equalised in thirty-three minutes,
A22 130 West Ham were still going steadily. ^Then disaster struck.
A22 131    |^*0It was in the fifty-fifth minute. ^Alan Hinton, Wolves' left
A22 132 winger who was playing his first League game, harassed Kirkup into
A22 133 conceding a corner.
A22 134    |^Deeley, his opposite number, took a hopeful kind of hook shot.
A22 135 ^The ball seemed to be going away and West Ham's goalkeeper, Laurie
A22 136 Leslie, thought danger had been averted.
A22 137    |^But the ball developed such a crazy spin that Leslie could not
A22 138 cope with it.
A22 139    |^That goal was just the tonic Wolves needed, and in the
A22 140 sixty-third minute Murray, capping a slick combined move, made the
A22 141 score 3-1.
A22 142    |^Three minutes from the end a typical bit of Woosnam Soccer
A22 143 technique laid on a ball from which Sealey scored West Ham's second
A22 144 goal.
A22 145 *<*4Grimsby... 3
A22 146    |Southend... 1*>
A22 147    |^*6WITHIN *4thirty seconds of the start, Grimsby 'keeper Malcolm
A22 148 White had his hands warmed by shots from Southend leader Norman
A22 149 Bleanch and right winger Tony Bentley and he got little respite from
A22 150 the visiting sharpshooters.
A22 151    |^*0But despite their superiority Southend's ninth minute goal had
A22 152 more than a rub of good fortune about it.
A22 153    |^A blind drive by Bleanch went off a defender to outside left Bob
A22 154 Kellard, who easily beat White with a close range shot.
A22 155    |^Ron Rafferty headed Grimsby's sixtieth minute **[SIC**] and Mike
A22 156 Cullen grabbed the lead by finishing off another Rafferty header.
A22 157    |^And only a minute from the end, left winger Cliff Jones cut in to
A22 158 net just inside the near post.
A22 159 *<*4Cool Neill is twice given slip*>
A22 160 *<Bolton 2, Arsenal 1: By *6JIM BEECROFT*>
A22 161    |^BURLY *4Billy McAdams, Bolton centre forward, and Terry Neill,
A22 162 lanky centre half of Arsenal, set a poser for the Northern Ireland
A22 163 selectors, some of whom watched this game at Burnden.
A22 164    |^*0For large parts of a moderate match young Neill, regarded as a
A22 165 fine international prospect, snuffed the experienced McAdams
A22 166 completely out of the play.
A22 167    |^Often Neill's cool and resourceful covering made Arsenal's
A22 168 suspect defence seem better than it really was, and left McAdams
A22 169 looking far from a top-line leader.
A22 170 *<*7BRILLIANT*>
A22 171    |^*0But twice, the tough and persistent McAdams evaded the Neill
A22 172 obstacle with two brilliant pieces of opportunism and chalked up two
A22 173 goals which deservedly gave Bolton their second victory of the season.
A22 174    |^First of these came in the thirty-sixth minute when McAdams
A22 175 swiftly snapped up a chance inside the penalty area, swivelled in a
A22 176 flash and fired smartly past the bewildered McLelland.
A22 177    |^This goal, which wiped out a similar effort by Arsenal centre
A22 178 forward Mel Charles, was the only thing McAdams had done right until
A22 179 then. ^And he did little else until he scored another fine goal in
A22 180 seventy-five minutes when he beat two men in a yard or so and whizzed
A22 181 a terrific 20-yard shot into the net.
A22 182    |^Though the Arsenal goal had had several narrow escapes,
A22 183 especially when shots from Holden and Pilkington hit the bar, it was
A22 184 not until after the second McAdams goal that Bolton assumed full
A22 185 command.
A22 186    |^But neither team looked as if they had any chance of becoming
A22 187 championship contenders.
A22 188 *<*6BRILLIANT BRIGGS IS TOP MAN*>
A22 189    |^NEW ZEALAND *4and Southampton Speedway ace Barry Briggs won the

A22 192    |^*0After twenty pulsating heats Briggs, winner of the world title
A22 193 in 1957 and 1958, showed his world class when he notched fifteen
A22 194 immaculate points to win the Pic's first prize of *+300, presented to
A22 195 him by comedian Terry-Thomas.
A22 196    |^Pint-sized Peter Craven (Belle Vue and England) took the second
A22 197 prize of *+150, while Wimbledon and New Zealand star Ronnie Moore

A22 199 *<*7MY HEROES*>
A22 200    |^*0Without detracting from the superb performance of Briggs,
A22 201 Craven and Moore, my heroes of the night were two Englishmen*-
A22 202 Swindon's Mike Broadbanks and Wimbledon's Cyril Maidment.
A22 203    |^Both these boys set the 50,000 crowd alight in Heat 4 when
A22 204 Maidment, last out of the starting gate, showed he had no big night
A22 205 nerves in his first Wembley final.
A22 206    |^For four laps, he and Broadbanks put up a terrific tussle, with
A22 207 Broadbanks just clinching victory.
A22 208    |^Maidment continued his rip-roaring, full-throttle riding in his
A22 209 next four rides.
A22 210    |^Although outclassed in his last outing, he notched seven points
A22 211 on the night to stake a claim for the world final at Malmo on
A22 212 September 15.
A22 213 *<*7TRAGEDY*>
A22 214    |^*0Tragedy struck Broadbanks after his first ride.
A22 215    |^An attack of asthma left him gasping for air and how he managed
A22 216 to stay on his machine for four more rides, let alone score four more
A22 217 points and a place at Malmo is beyond me.
A22 218    |^Beside riding for *+720 Pic prize money, the sixteen riders were
A22 219 also battling for nine places in the World Final at Malmo, and results

A23   2 *<*4Only Avon's Pride gives full value in Cesarewitch*>
A23   3 *<by *6TOM FORREST*>
A23   4    |^H*2ORSE-RACING'S *0happiest invalid today is jockey Bobby Elliot.
A23   5 ^He broke a collarbone only last Thursday, yet his specialist declares
A23   6 that in three or four days he should be fit for riding gallops... and
A23   7 then for the plum job of the week*- pushing home *4Avon's Pride *0in
A23   8 the Cesarewitch at Newmarket on Saturday.
A23   9    |^Young bones mend quickly. ^But the back of a big-race favourite
A23  10 is no place for a jockey with one wing trailing, so Elliot will have
A23  11 to pass a pretty stiff midweek try-out*- or trainer Dick Hern *1must
A23  12 *0find a substitute.
A23  13    |^Top-class riders are still available... like Ron Hutchinson or,
A23  14 at a pound or two overweight, Scobie Breasley or Eph Smith, the most
A23  15 likely choice as he rode Avon's Pride in his gallop yesterday morning.
A23  16    |^Avon's Pride becomes my final selection, because he alone of the
A23  17 three Cesarewitch horses recommended a week ago for Autumn Double bets
A23  18 remains as a first-rate value-for-money proposition.
A23  19 *<*6TUMBLED*>
A23  20    |^*0El Surpriso, 33-1 last week-end, has been slashed to 12-1. ^And
A23  21 Alcoa's odds have tumbled from 25-1 to 14-1.
A23  22    |^They could still win, but if you have to take these new prices it
A23  23 looks as if you have already *"missed the boat.**"
A23  24    |^Avon's Pride has been reduced too, but less spectacularly*- from
A23  25 14-1 to 12-1. ^This is a rate that could still be confidently accepted
A23  26 without the feeling of being short-changed. ^The four-year-old's
A23  27 chance is outstanding.
A23  28    |^*4He has the speed... *0any horse who can play so powerful a part
A23  29 in shorter races, as in the 1 1/4-mile Vaux Gold Tankard and Ebor
A23  30 Handicap, will not be found short of sheer pace with half a mile
A23  31 further to go.
A23  32    |^*4He has the stamina... *0the big win of the season for Avon's
A23  33 Pride was in Epsom's Roseberry Handicap, of the same 2 1/4-mile length
A23  34 as the Cesarewitch.
A23  35    |^*4He has the courage... *0no horse can do without a stout heart
A23  36 under the ordeal of that long, lung-bursting Cesarewitch straight.
A23  37 ^And in Avon's Pride's whole career he has been often outpointed but
A23  38 never outbattled.
A23  39    |^*4The weight. ^*0At 7\0st. 11\0lb., 3\0lb. below the middle of
A23  40 the range, the handicapper has certainly taken an indulgent line.
A23  41    |^Direct form, this season's form, suggests that two of his most
A23  42 heavily backed rivals*- Angazi (12-1) and Trelawny (14-1)*- must
A23  43 produce quite unexpected reserves to beat Avon's Pride this week. ^And
A23  44 through these horses most of the others can be declared safely held.
A23  45    |^Technique, rather than tactics, will be needed from the jockey.
A23  46 ^The Cesarewitch is always a hard-run struggle from the start... that
A23  47 will suit Avon's Pride, but the rider must use a hustling, strong-arm
A23  48 style, or the colt might well idle his chance away.
A23  49 *<*6AUTHORITY*>
A23  50    |^*4El Surpriso *0is one they all have to beat. ^There was no
A23  51 mistaking the authority of her win at Nottingham last week, and with a
A23  52 mere 7\0st. 1\0lb., and the energetic Ray Reader riding, this filly
A23  53 could be the weak link to wreck the whole handicap.
A23  54    |^Almost as lightly burdened at 7\0st. 2\0lb., is *4Alcoa.
A23  55 ^*0Though less obviously *"thrown in**" at the weights, Alcoa is such
A23  56 a rugged, unrelenting stayer that Mick Greening is sure to be driving
A23  57 her down the straight with glowing visions of galloping them all into
A23  58 the ground.
A23  59    |^Among the class horses*- the top half dozen, with weights of
A23  60 8\0st. 9\0lb. or more*- Lester Piggott's mount, *4Sunny Way *0(20-1),
A23  61 is the only one I seriously fear.
A23  62    |^*4Morecambe *0is left out because no eight-year-old has ever won
A23  63 the race; *4Farrney Fox *0because his recent form is sadly degenerate;
A23  64 *4New Brig *0because he has not raced since May; *4Agreement *0because
A23  65 he no longer has the force that once won him two Doncaster Cups;
A23  66 *4Trelawny *0because it takes almost 2 1/4 miles before he *1starts
A23  67 *0to warm up.
A23  68    |^Neither 1959 winner *4Come to Daddy *0nor his stablemate and
A23  69 brother *4Usurper *0has lived up to high hopes this season. ^While
A23  70 *4Honest Boy Aristarchus, Cold Comfort, Tarquinian *0and *4Narratus
A23  71 *0are run-of-the-mill stayers who could run well... but hardly well
A23  72 enough.
A23  73 *<*6SUSPECT*>
A23  74    |^*4Persian Lancer's *0stamina is suspect for a horse at the short
A23  75 odds of 12-1*- I believe he will last out only on the best of going.
A23  76 ^And *4Utrillo *0(25-1) will not race at all on soft ground*- he sulks
A23  77 unless he can hear his feet rattle.
A23  78    |^Hock-deep mud would be ideal though for *4Annotation *0(20-1) and
A23  79 *4Python *0(20-1), both powerful but one-paced plodders. ^And game
A23  80 little *4Angazi *0is a proven mudlark.
A23  81    |^In Python's stablemate, *4Night Porter, *0we have the crankiest
A23  82 character of them all*- but a real live one at 40-1, if you care to
A23  83 take a chance on his missing any mud that may be flying from his
A23  84 rivals' heels. ^He will refuse to race if any hits his face.
A23  85    |^None of the others seems at all likely to win, and I rate Night
A23  86 Porter and Sunny Way the best of the long shots. ^But the final
A23  87 placings I hope for are *6AVON'S PRIDE 1, *4El Surpriso 2, Alcoa 3.

A23  92 \de \l'Arc \de Triomphe.
A23  93    |^Ours is a team without a captain. ^But even with the stay-at-home
A23  94 ace \0St. Paddy, waiting for a second-division fade-out at Newmarket
A23  95 on Friday, Britain's prestige need not suffer in Paris.
A23  96    |^Nobody would call the three raiders a force to flash triumphantly
A23  97 through the richest race this side of the Atlantic.
A23  98    |^But neither are they, as the French believe, just so many sitting
A23  99 targets to be blasted aside in the hurricane rush of Right Royal.
A23 100    |^*2JUST GREAT *0is no sitter... though he staged something like a
A23 101 sit-down strike at the starting gate to lose his \0St. Leger chance.
A23 102 ^He lost the Derby too through rough-house treatment by other horses.
A23 103    |^In four remaining races this year, Just Great had a fair chance,
A23 104 and won them all. ^I make him best of the British.
A23 105    |^New partner Lester Piggott must get him off with the rest, steer
A23 106 clear of trouble... and who knows to what heights Just Great may rise?
A23 107 *<*5Formidable*>
A23 108    |^*2HIGH HAT *0is less of a mystery. ^We know he is no match for
A23 109 \0St. Paddy, but he *1has *0matched, and mastered, Petite Etoile.
A23 110 ^That is a formidable qualification. ^Duncan Keith rides.
A23 111    |^*2TENACITY *0has not yet attacked the top class. ^But what an
A23 112 improver this enormous, late-developing filly is.
A23 113    |^Yet to make any of our trio more than an each-way bet would be
A23 114 more patriotic than prudent. ^Right Royal is not the only star in
A23 115 opposition.
A23 116    |^Match *=3 will be there... cantering winner of the French \0St.
A23 117 Leger. ^So will stablemate Dicta Drake, on whom Max Garcia has a
A23 118 chance to make amends for the suicidal tactics which cost them the
A23 119 Doncaster \0St. Leger.
A23 120    |^Italian crack Molvedo, with a runaway success at Deauville on his
A23 121 last French trip, shapes like another Ribot. ^So he should*- he is a
A23 122 son of Ribot, and Ribot's jockey, veteran Enrico Camiel rides him too.
A23 123    |^But in that chestnut-strewn Longchamp paddock they will all be
A23 124 dominated by the magnificence of the loose-limbed giant *2RIGHT ROYAL.
A23 125 ^*0And all logic points to his being as dictatorial on the track as in
A23 126 the pre-race parade.
A23 127    |^{0T. F.}
A23 128 *<*4This is Lochroe all over again *5says *7DICK FRANCIS*>
A23 129    |^*6I *2TOOK *0a ride, a few days ago, on an echo from the past*-
A23 130 on a small-framed, brown four-year-old named Vulgate. ^The echo?*-
A23 131 from Lochroe. ^They are half brothers out of the mare Loch Cash, and
A23 132 were sired by the top jumping stallions Vulgan and King Hal.
A23 133    |^Vulgate looks as intelligent and handles as easily as Lochroe*-
A23 134 and jumps in the same style. ^If he moves less perfectly, it is
A23 135 because Lochroe was the best-moving 'chaser I have known.
A23 136    |^Trained by Bill Marshall at Cheltenham, the beautifully broken-in
A23 137 youngster can be seen on Saturday at Fontwell, where he comes out for
A23 138 the first time this season in the handicap hurdle (4.15).
A23 139    |^At home he does not wear shoes on his hind feet. ^None of the
A23 140 Marshall horses do. ^This ensures that if a hindleg strikes a
A23 141 foreleg*- a frequent occurrence*- the injury is restricted to
A23 142 bruising.
A23 143    |^No shoes are needed for road work. ^The stable yard, on the top
A23 144 of Cleeve Hill overlooking Cheltenham racecourse leads straight out on
A23 145 to open commons.
A23 146    |^It is usual for a mare who has produced one winning jumper to
A23 147 produce others, even if not of the same standard, and generally in
A23 148 steeplechasers it is the influence of the mare which predominates.
A23 149    |^If one of her progeny jumps well, they all do, (and if one jumps
A23 150 appallingly they all do!), regardless of the sire.
A23 151    |^Most remarkable examples of half-brothers are Gay Donald and Pas
A23 152 Seul. ^Both these Gold Cup winners*- by Gay Light and Erin's Pride
A23 153 respectively*- had Pas \de Quatre for their dam.
A23 154    |^Both, broken and trained by different trainers, were blundering
A23 155 jumpers until they were seven, at which age they began to outgrow
A23 156 their carelessness, and their getaway burst of speed took over.

A23 210 Johnson, who may well win an England trial this season, outhooked

A24  46    |^That is the call from Labour leaders in the breadline city of

A24  53 and children line up for food at charity soup kitchens.
A24  54    |^Mayor Phillips was challenged by a Toronto newspaper to tour the
A24  55 city and see the distress for himself. ^But the Mayor announced:
A24  56 ~*"There is no hunger**"*- and left for Europe.
A24  57    |^*"I'm going to let the people of Europe know that these stories
A24  58 of starvation in Toronto are all wrong,**" he said.
A24  59    |^*6IN DUBLIN *0Mayor Phillips said: ^*"There may be some

A24  61    |^Earlier, in London, where the Mayor and his wife stayed in the

A24 126    |^*0And that, they complain, creates a false impression that the

A24 202 of Ansley, who was to have married 19-year-old Barry Wright and
A24 203 Margaret Wilson, 18, at \0St. Thomas's Church, Coventry.
A24 204    |^But five days before \0Mr. Jarvis told the couple he would not
A24 205 marry them unless he was ordered to by his Bishop.
A24 206    |^As a result, Barry and Margaret got married at another church,
A24 207 after a delay of eight days.
A24 208    |^Barry's mother protested to the Bishop. ^He has written back
A24 209 saying he is glad the marriage did take place, and adding:*-

A24 216 first time we met the vicar he seemed to have something against us.
A24 217    |^*"He was particularly interested in finding out why we weren't
A24 218 having a white wedding. ^At the wedding rehearsal the vicar told us he
A24 219 would write to the Bishop and tell him that he had two non-active

A25   2 *<*4\0Mr. Forte To The Rescue?*>
A25   3    |^A *2SCHEME *0to unscramble the so-called Jasper group of
A25   4 companies may be announced before the end of this month. ^For some
A25   5 time now negotiations have been going on between the State Building
A25   6 Society and a group believed to be headed by \0Mr. Charles Forte, the
A25   7 caterer.
A25   8    |^The basis of the talks have been, firstly, that the depositors of
A25   9 the State should at least be repaid 20\0s. in the pound, even if they
A25  10 may suffer some loss of interest, and secondly, that there should be
A25  11 an offer*- on the basis of independent accountants' valuations*- for
A25  12 all the shares in all the group companies, whose stock exchange
A25  13 quotations have been suspended.
A25  14    |^Altogether, the State has lent about *+7 million to various
A25  15 companies in the group, but the chief problem is the *+3 1/4 million
A25  16 borrowed by Friedrich Grunwald, its driving force, at present serving
A25  17 a five-year prison sentence.
A25  18    |^Grunwald also borrowed *+1 1/2 million from \0Mr. Maxwell Joseph,
A25  19 the hotelier, and it seems certain that a solution will depend on
A25  20 \0Mr. Joseph foregoing a considerable part of this, as well as on
A25  21 \0Mr. Grunwald and Herbert Murray (formerly of the State Building
A25  22 Society, now also in prison) surrendering the greater part of their
A25  23 own personal holdings in group companies.
A25  24    |^\0Mr. Forte's interest in taking over the group plainly lies in
A25  25 the catering opportunities offered. ^Among the group's assets are the
A25  26 Piccadilly, Rubens and Rembrandt hotels in London, as well as a number
A25  27 of provincial hotels.
A25  28    |^It also owns a number of news theatres and, among others, the
A25  29 *"Classic**" chain of repertory cinemas. ^Finally, there are 43
A25  30 billiard halls for which \0Mr. Forte may well have other plans.
A25  31    |^But there is also a substantial property interest, above all the
A25  32 *+4 million Dolphin Square block of flats. ^The scheme therefore
A25  33 hinges on finding a property group to take over this aspect of the
A25  34 Grunwald *"empire.**"
A25  35    |^More than one property company has already shown an interest in
A25  36 this, but a well-known *+15 million London group specialising in
A25  37 residential property seems at present the most likely bet.
A25  38    |^Things at last seem to be looking up for the thousands of
A25  39 long-suffering State Building Society depositors. ^Even if the present
A25  40 scheme falls through*- which now seems unlikely*- there is a City
A25  41 merchant bank now waiting quietly on the sidelines with an alternative
A25  42 scheme in its pocket.
A25  43 *<*4New Recruit*>
A25  44    |^\0M*2R. GERALD GLOVER'S *0election last week to the board of City
A25  45 of London Real Property provides an interesting link between one of
A25  46 the most active property development groups and a company whose
A25  47 immense possibilities has **[SIC**] made eyes other than those of
A25  48 \0Mr. Cotton and \0Mr. Clore take a long, lingering, glance in its
A25  49 direction.
A25  50    |^Among other things, \0Mr. Glover is chairman of Edger
A25  51 Investments, the development company whose latest achievement has been
A25  52 the Carlton Tower Hotel in Sloane Street, London. ^Like many another
A25  53 property company it has attracted the backing of a leading insurance
A25  54 company*- none other than the Prudential.
A25  55    |^Perhaps even more important, however, for Edger is the backing it
A25  56 enjoys from Development Securities, which owns one-third of the
A25  57 equity. ^This company, whose principal asset is the Dorchester Hotel
A25  58 and whose shares have so far this year risen from 81\0s. to a new high
A25  59 of 110\0s, is in turn controlled by the wealthy McAlpine family.
A25  60    |^Until now the only connection between {0*2CLRP} *0and the
A25  61 McAlpine-Glover interests lay in the vast Stag Brewery site at
A25  62 Victoria, which is 51 {0p.c.} owned by {0*2CLRP}, *025 {0p.c.}
A25  63 by Development Securities and 24 {0p.c.} by Edger.
A25  64    |^The new move should at least serve to boost the pace of
A25  65 developing this site, from which the *+4 million Edger should*-
A25  66 proportionately*- benefit most. ^With a yield of little more than 1
A25  67 {0p.c.} at the current price of 28\0s. 3\0d. the shares are
A25  68 essentially a long-term investment. ^But one which should prove
A25  69 rewarding.
A25  70 *<*6{0ICI}'*4s Bad Example*>
A25  71    |^I*2MPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES *0should certainly have no
A25  72 difficulty in finding underwriters for its next *"rights**" issue. ^As
A25  73 a result of its decision to revert to the bad old practice, gradually
A25  74 being rejected by the more progressive companies, of letting the
A25  75 underwriters get the benefit of the rights inadvertently not taken
A25  76 up*- in this case nearly 3 per \0cent. of the *+34 million issue*-
A25  77 there has been an underwriting *"bonus**" of no less than *+280,000.
A25  78    |^It is of course true, as \0Mr. Paul Chambers, the {0*2ICI}
A25  79 *0chairman, has pointed out, that at the time of the issue the rights
A25  80 were worth only 9\0d. a share, and that if the shares not taken up
A25  81 were to be sold for the benefit of the shareholders whose rights they
A25  82 were*- the normal modern practice*- this would involve considerable
A25  83 administrative work.
A25  84    |^But this is a matter of principle. ^Underwriters are adequately
A25  85 recompensed for the services they perform without the necessity of a
A25  86 pourboire at the expense of innocently negligent*- or merely absent*-
A25  87 shareholders. ^{0*2ICI} *0should be setting a better example than
A25  88 this.
A25  89 *<*4Forward Strip*>
A25  90    |^W*2HAT *0tax changes are likely in this month's Budget? ^One
A25  91 innovation the Government has been seriously considering*- and which
A25  92 may yet come about*- is the introduction of a flat rate Corporation
A25  93 Tax to replace the present combination of income tax and profits tax
A25  94 on company profits.
A25  95    |^This would have the obvious merit of recognising the important
A25  96 difference between company and personal taxation. ^It would also, I
A25  97 believe, be welcomed by the inland Revenue (normally averse to any
A25  98 major change) as a means of helping them in their endless battle
A25  99 against the dividend strippers.
A25 100    |^For those few readers unacquainted with this sport I should
A25 101 perhaps explain that dividend stripping is essentially a device for
A25 102 extracting accumulated reserves from a private trading company without
A25 103 paying tax. ^In its simplest form it used to work in the following
A25 104 way.
A25 105    |^The trading company with, say, *+100,000 of reserves and *+50,000
A25 106 of other assets is sold to a finance company for *+150,000. ^The
A25 107 finance company then pays itself a dividend of *+100,000 and sells the
A25 108 trading company back to its original owners for *+50,000. ^The latter
A25 109 are then left with the company plus *+100,000 in cash*- the object of
A25 110 the exercise.
A25 111    |^The finance company, however, whose business is dealing in shares
A25 112 and other property and is thus taxed on capital gains, can offset the
A25 113 *+100,000 loss in buying and reselling the business against the
A25 114 dividend received. ^Hence it, too, has no tax liability.
A25 115 *<*4Revenue's Chagrin*>
A25 116    |^*0Last year's Finance Act*- in particular the *"blanket**"
A25 117 Section 28*- was meant to have put a stop to all this. ^But although
A25 118 the crude method just outlined is no longer possible, a roaring trade
A25 119 is still being done*- much to the Revenue's chagrin*- in some of the
A25 120 more esoteric refinements of dividend stripping. ^Among them are the
A25 121 methods known among the professionals as the *"Scissors,**" Stock
A25 122 Shunting and the Forward Strip.
A25 123    |^The first two are highly complex operations, usually used in
A25 124 property deals. ^The forward strip, however, was specially designed
A25 125 for those people who have not yet made their profits*- actors, for
A25 126 example. ^Here, a company is formed to exploit the actor's services
A25 127 over the next five years.
A25 128    |^In essence what happens is that the drop in value of the shares
A25 129 in this company (at the end of the five years they are worthless) is
A25 130 offset against the actor's earnings over the period. ^How many of our
A25 131 leading actors are anxiously waiting for April 17 to find out whether
A25 132 they will be able to continue their forward strip?
A25 133 *<*6THIS WEEK'S DIVIDENDS*>
A25 134 *<*4Reyrolle: Phoenix*>
A25 135    |^H*2IGHLIGHT *0of this week's dividend news will come from \0*4A.
A25 136 Reyrolle, *0the big North-country electrical engineers who report on
A25 137 Friday. ^The difficulties through which the heavy electrical industry
A25 138 has passed in recent years are well enough known and they haven't left
A25 139 Reyrolle scatheless.
A25 140    |^These went further than a mere check to growth, and at one time
A25 141 brought trading profits down from the peak of *+3,909,000 in 1955 by
A25 142 nearly *+1 million.
A25 143    |^Last year trading profits had climbed back to *+3,134,000, but
A25 144 the market is not particularly sanguine that 1960 will have seen much
A25 145 further recovery*- profit margins were probably too slim for that.
A25 146 ^Last year's agreement with Associated Electrical Industries for joint
A25 147 research has probably not been in force long enough to bring big
A25 148 savings yet, but it should do so in time.
A25 149    |^Meanwhile Reyrolle has never cut its dividend which has been held
A25 150 at the equivalent of 8 1/4 per cent on present capital for the past
A25 151 four years. ^Earnings a year ago were 25 per cent. ^The interim has
A25 152 been maintained this year at 3 1/4 per cent and expectation is that
A25 153 the final will again be 5 1/2 per cent*- anything more would please
A25 154 the market. ^The shares have risen in the past two months by about
A25 155 7\0s. in line with other heavy electricals, on hopes that the industry
A25 156 has now passed its worst.
A25 157 *<*5Chemicals Prosperity*>
A25 158    |^*0Better profits are expected from *4Associated Chemical
A25 159 Companies *0when the figures for 1960 are announced next Thursday.
A25 160 ^{0*2A.C.C.}, *0formerly British Chrome & Chemicals, has expanded
A25 161 rapidly in recent years and is now a sizeable group controlling assets
A25 162 worth more than *+11 million. ^Trading profits have risen from about
A25 163 *+250,000 to *+1,345,000 in the past 10 years.
A25 164    |^Last year's total distribution of 15 {0p.c.} came from earnings
A25 165 of 38 {0p.c.} so an increase is well within the company's powers
A25 166 especially as the cash position is good. ^On the other hand the
A25 167 directors may be conservative again because of expansion plans.
A25 168    |^A free scrip issue cannot be ruled out. ^It must surely come some
A25 169 day with reserves and undistributed profits now totalling nearly *+4
A25 170 million by comparison with an issued equity capital of *+2,154,000.
A25 171 ^The last scrip issue was seven years ago.
A25 172    |^Profits of *4Mitchells, Ashworth & Stansfield, *0the Lancashire
A25 173 manufacturers, dyers and printers of felts who now have considerable
A25 174 interests in the carpet trades, are expected to be lower. ^This will
A25 175 have been caused by running-in troubles with their new plant.
A25 176    |^There can hardly be much fear, however, of a reduced
A25 177 distribution, so strong is the company's financial position. ^For
A25 178 several years past the company has added a 6 1/2 {0p.c.} tax free
A25 179 distribution from capital profits to its dividend.
A25 180 *<*5Cash Resources*>
A25 181    |^*0A year ago the balance sheet disclosed cash and investments
A25 182 totalling nearly *+800,000 by comparison with an issued capital which
A25 183 is still only *+417,000 after the one-for-four scrip issue.
A25 184 ^Two-thirds of the investments are in quoted stocks and some
A25 185 shareholders have been pressing for a return of capital.
A25 186    |^Steps are in hand to repay the *+119,000 of Preference capital
A25 187 and interest in the company's report centres chiefly on what further
A25 188 moves will be made to distribute some of the surplus cash resources.
A25 189    |^The 5\0s. shares of *4Phoenix Assurance *0have risen about 30\0s.
A25 190 this year and 50\0s. from the low point last year. ^This reflects
A25 191 market hopes that there will at last be an increase on the 100
A25 192 {0p.c.} dividend maintained for the past six years, albeit with one
A25 193 tiny scrip issue of one-for-20.
A25 194    |^Nevertheless Phoenix shares at around 160\0s. still yield just
A25 195 over 3 {0p.c.} ^This is high by comparison with the 1 1/4 to 1 3/4
A25 196 {0p.c.} returns shown by such companies as Equity Law, General
A25 197 Accident, Legal & General and Eagle Star. ^But after the *'no

A26   2 *<*6THE BIGGEST CONTEST IN THE WORLD*>
A26   3 *<*4After four months' travel in Russia and the United States *6MERVYN
A26   4 JONES *4compares life in the two competing super-Powers and the
A26   5 attitudes of their people*>
A26   6    |^*4T*2O *0say that it is nice to be home, after four months and
A26   7 seven thousand miles of travel in America and Russia, is true in more
A26   8 than one way. ^Appreciation of living in England, now amply
A26   9 reinforced, is the least of it. ^The greatest relief is not to be at
A26  10 either pulling end in the global tug-of-war.
A26  11    |^Whether we call it cold war or peaceful competition, the contest
A26  12 between the two super-Powers is a burden of which they will never be
A26  13 free in what we can discern of the future. ^The material weight of
A26  14 this burden, considerable in America, is enormous in Russia. ^Its
A26  15 psychological weight is incalculable for two peoples whose
A26  16 inclination, from reasons of geography and tradition, is to want the
A26  17 rest of the world to stop bothering them.
A26  18    |^This is evident, notably, with regard to the race to the moon.
A26  19 ^For us in England, according to individual outlook, the exploration
A26  20 of space is either a silly game or a glorious endeavour of the human
A26  21 spirit. ^For the contestants, it is no joke and no fun either. ^It is
A26  22 something that has to be done because the other side is doing it.
A26  23 *<*4Teacher's view of space flights*>
A26  24    |^*0For Americans, Russia's lead in the race is as grim a matter as
A26  25 Japan's initiative after Pearl Harbour. ^Of the possible reactions,
A26  26 sheer denial was commoner than I could have expected. ^A famous
A26  27 columnist explained in detail how the Gagarin and Titov flights had
A26  28 been (not *"might have been**") fabricated. ^A mother, sensible enough
A26  29 to believe in them, asked me what she should say to her child after
A26  30 the teacher had told the class they were a fake. ^*"Tell her what you
A26  31 think,**" I said; but in a conformist small town this was evidently as
A26  32 hard as for an atheist parent to challenge religious instruction.
A26  33    |^Belief in the flights necessarily implied gloom. ^As I bought my
A26  34 paper at the candy store on the day of the Titov flight, the headlines
A26  35 were big and black. ^The shopkeeper's wife glanced at them and said:
A26  36 ^*"Isn't it just too awful?**"
A26  37    |^The third reaction was to take comfort in America's way of doing
A26  38 things. ^*"Ours,**" said a young teacher, *"is a democratic space
A26  39 programme.**" ^By this he meant that it was attended by publicity and
A26  40 by care for human life. ^I had been assured several times that
A26  41 half-a-dozen Russians are whirling dead through space. ^*"We could
A26  42 have a man on the moon in six months if we just shot them off
A26  43 regardless,**" said the teacher.
A26  44    |^None of these people was excited by the thought of an American in
A26  45 space. ^*"The whole thing's crazy when you think of half the world
A26  46 starving,**" said an economics student at Cleveland. ^But he added:
A26  47 ^*"I guess we've got to do it.**"
A26  48 *<*4Getting ready for massacre*>
A26  49    |^*0For the Russians, who enjoy the lead, one might expect it to be
A26  50 an inspiration. ^For some of them, it is. ^A woman pulling potatoes on
A26  51 an especially primitive collective farm, and lunching as I spoke to
A26  52 her on dry bread and gherkins, said: ^*"Don't judge our country by
A26  53 what you see*- we've got the first man in space.**" ^The surprise was
A26  54 to meet Russians (not intellectuals, but common folk) who took a
A26  55 contrary view.
A26  56    |^An engineer: ^*"It's not the right way to use millions of
A26  57 roubles, with conditions as they are.**" ^A miner's wife: ^*"It won't
A26  58 do any harm, if we can believe it's for peaceful purposes, but it
A26  59 would have been better to build more hospitals.**" ^A tractor driver:
A26  60 ^*"We don't say this publicly, you understand, but most of us think
A26  61 it's a waste of money.**"
A26  62    |^At this, the tractor driver's mate grinned and said: ^*"People
A26  63 say Titov was really sent up to photograph America.**" ^I asked if he
A26  64 thought the space flights justified. ^He shrugged: ^*"Might do one
A26  65 good thing*- prove once and for all there's no God up there.**"
A26  66    |^What is taken for granted, both in America and in Russia, is that
A26  67 there would be no sputniks if there were no military rockets. ^Which
A26  68 brings me to the gloomiest aspect of my journey: the spectacle of two
A26  69 great peoples getting ready to massacre each other.
A26  70    |^It is a cliche*?2 to say that neither the American nor the
A26  71 Russian people want war, but it is true. ^With the Russians, it is a
A26  72 simple matter of scars yet unhealed. ^Time and again, people gripped
A26  73 me by the arm, told ghastly stories of the Nazi invasion, and asked:
A26  74 ^*"Can you imagine that we would start a war?**" ^It is impossible to
A26  75 doubt their sincerity.
A26  76    |^With the Americans, there are several strands. ^They have a great
A26  77 deal to lose. ^They have, even now, a deep suspicion of militarism, of
A26  78 *"the brass,**" of the gearing of the nation to war. ^A young
A26  79 ornithologist, asked how he came to choose his profession, explained:
A26  80 ^*"After I graduated I was in chemistry, but I found they were using
A26  81 it for war. ^I switched to electronics, and it was the same. ^I sat
A26  82 down to figure out what they couldn't use for war, and what I came up
A26  83 with was birds.**"
A26  84 *<*4No real awareness of nuclear threat*>
A26  85    |^*0Add to this a still potent distrust of foreign entanglements.
A26  86 ^The evening after the President's July 25 speech, announcing a
A26  87 readiness to fight for Berlin and an increase in the call-up*- a
A26  88 speech which caused more alarm over interrupted careers than
A26  89 satisfaction*- I chatted over a coffee with a factory worker. ^He was
A26  90 all enthusiasm: it was a wonderful speech, he was behind Kennedy all
A26  91 the way. ^Then he said abruptly: ^*"A good thing we haven't got Truman
A26  92 in the White House now. ^Never was any need to fight in Korea, and if
A26  93 he was around we'd be fighting in Germany now.**"
A26  94    |^But, sad to relate, *"they want peace**" is not the whole story.
A26  95 ^One has to add that both Americans and Russians are ready to
A26  96 contemplate war. ^The reason is that neither people has any real
A26  97 awareness of what nuclear war would mean.
A26  98    |^Union Square in New York is a public forum, comparable to
A26  99 Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. ^As a listening-post, it is more
A26 100 instructive than Hyde Park because nobody gets on a platform. ^A man
A26 101 with something on his mind starts to talk, and those around him join
A26 102 in.
A26 103    |^*"You \2gotta admit,**" a young man was saying as I neared a
A26 104 sizeable group, *"that things advance when there's a war. ^We got
A26 105 penicillin because of the last war, and we'll get something else next
A26 106 time.**"
A26 107    |^A religious pacifist intervened: ^*"Did you ever see a picture of
A26 108 Hiroshima?**" ^The first speaker countered: ^*"Aw, Hiroshima*- did you
A26 109 ever see a man mangled by a bus?**"
A26 110    |^Another man observed with an air of sagacity: ^*"Wars are fought
A26 111 for real estate. ^They kick it around for a bit, then they divide it
A26 112 up. ^Look at Korea, look at Vietnam.**" ^Another summed up: ^*"There
A26 113 always will be wars, it don't matter how much you talk.**" ^I broke in
A26 114 to ask if anyone disagreed with this proposition. ^Among about fifty
A26 115 people, nobody did.
A26 116 *<*4Lecture on need for disarmament*>
A26 117    |^*0Nobody in Russia would talk about the benefits of war. ^But
A26 118 when a Russian talks of the horrors of war, he is talking a different
A26 119 language from a nuclear disarmer. ^The very intensity of past
A26 120 experience inhibits thought of a worse future.
A26 121    |^Once, a man who had experienced Nazi occupation told me how the
A26 122 Germans knocked people about and turned them out of their homes to
A26 123 freeze. ^He wound up, inevitably: ^*"We don't want to see that
A26 124 again.**" ^I said: ^*"One thing that's certain is that you won't.
A26 125 ^You'll see either peace or death in a split second.**" ^He stared at
A26 126 me, wondering what I was talking about.
A26 127    |^At a restaurant in Kursk, three Russians lectured me on the need
A26 128 for disarmament and cited the speech Khrushchev had made the previous
A26 129 day at Stalingrad (sorry, Volgograd). ^Nettled by some remarks by \de
A26 130 Gaulle, the Soviet Premier had declared that France would be
A26 131 obliterated in another war and added: ^*"However, it is impossible to
A26 132 destroy the Soviet Union.**"
A26 133 *<*4Americans' inborn optimism*>
A26 134    |^*0I said that Khrushchev was quite right about France, and
A26 135 Britain, too, but unduly sanguine about his own country. ^Nuclear
A26 136 weapons, I went on, could destroy the human race. ^Signalling to the
A26 137 waitress for another round of Cuban rum, one of the Russians said
A26 138 positively: ^*"Not the Soviet Union.**"
A26 139    |^It is equally inconceivable for Americans that their country
A26 140 could cease to function as an organised society. ^Paradoxically, the
A26 141 civil defence drive strengthens this feeling. ^Estimates of how many
A26 142 people would be killed, however horrific, merely suggest how many
A26 143 would be saved. ^With their inborn optimism, many Americans envisage
A26 144 the aftermath of nuclear attack as a period of getting back on their
A26 145 feet, like the day after a hurricane.
A26 146    |^The point is often made that Americans have never known modern
A26 147 war on their soil. ^It is sometimes forgotten that Russians have never
A26 148 known long-range bombing. ^The blitz on London was a frustrated
A26 149 substitute for invasion. ^Leningrad was shelled and many Russian towns
A26 150 were devastated by street-fighting, but Moscow*- with the Germans
A26 151 almost in the suburbs*- never had an air raid on the London scale, and
A26 152 behind the lines was behind the lines. ^It is natural to think with
A26 153 some confidence of keeping the enemy out next time.
A26 154    |^Russians do, of course, know about nuclear bombs and missiles.
A26 155 ^But everyone hopes that his home town will not be a target, and they
A26 156 have been told very little about fallout. ^Defence, therefore, *1means
A26 157 *0defence for them.
A26 158 *<*4Views that go unchallenged*>
A26 159    |^*0To this, one has to add the general conviction that *"our
A26 160 side**" is in the right, and acting defensively, over what Russians
A26 161 call the German question and Americans the Berlin crisis. ^The view
A26 162 that Khrushchev is simply trying to settle the German problem on a
A26 163 sensible basis is, of course, never publicly challenged in Russia.
A26 164 ^The view that Kennedy is simply trying to maintain a position
A26 165 unreasonably attacked by the Soviet Union is seldom publicly
A26 166 challenged in America. ^For people who do not rule out *"war if
A26 167 necessary,**" the mood is not far on either side from: ^*"We don't
A26 168 want to fight, but by jingo if we do...**"
A26 169    |^Any glossary of the Russo-American political vocabulary (and I am
A26 170 thinking of everyday speech as well as official statements) must
A26 171 include these entries: ^*"Threat: a bellicose move made by our
A26 172 opponents. ^Warning: a bellicose move made by us.**" ^I have met both
A26 173 Americans and Russians who were genuinely saddened by the resumption
A26 174 of nuclear tests, which was in the offing while I was in America and
A26 175 happened while I was in Russia. ^It meant that hopes had been dashed,
A26 176 and it showed how bad things were getting. ^But I met nobody who
A26 177 thought it actually wrong if their leaders found it necessary.
A26 178    |^One might sum up by recording two posters in the same street in
A26 179 Kiev. ^The first showed a mother clutching a child and read: ^*"For
A26 180 their sake, we must have peace.**" ^The other showed a steel-helmeted
A26 181 soldier with levelled bayonet and read: ^*"Ready for the defence of
A26 182 the Motherland.**" ^I feel sure that both meet with general approval.
A26 183    |^Cold war, nevertheless, is less intense than hot war in more than
A26 184 one respect. ^The antagonism is less total, and among both peoples
A26 185 there is a refreshing absence of the undiscriminating hatred known in
A26 186 the last war as Vansittartism.
A26 187    |^This is easy for the Americans. ^They reason that, since one can
A26 188 be loyal to America and oppose Kennedy, one can be fond of Russia
A26 189 while loathing Khrushchev. ^There is in fact a certain vogue for
A26 190 Russia in the United States. ^Far more young people are learning the
A26 191 Russian language than in Britain, and they are not all hoping for jobs
A26 192 with the Voice of America.

A27   6 at Eastbourne today passed a resolution reaffirming the demand for a
A27   7 third week's holiday, and eight statutory holidays with pay for three

A27   9    |^*0It also asked for a revision of holiday pay to be based on

A27  21    |^*0\0Mr. {0W. J.} Daniel (Worcester) urged that it was vitally
A27  22 necessary to have longer breaks from work because of the stress and
A27  23 strain of working 50 weeks in the year.

A27  28    |^\0Mrs. {0M. E.} Sparks (Birmingham) said that employers were
A27  29 beginning to recognise that tea breaks were necessary because they

A27  31 more monotonous and that was bringing mental and bodily illness.
A27  32 *<*7NEW GRADE*>
A27  33    |^*0\0Mr. {0W. J.} Carron (President) pointed out that in some
A27  34 sections of industry, under the pressure of the rank and file,
A27  35 increased holidays had been agreed based on length of service and
A27  36 other qualifications.
A27  37    |^There had also been an extension of a new grade known as manual
A27  38 staff where attractions, including longer holidays, were being offered
A27  39 to the rank and file and were being accepted.
A27  40 *<*4Short-time Figures Slashed in Car Factories*>
A27  41    |^I*2MPROVEMENT *0in the motor industry situation was reflected in
A27  42 figures issued after today's monthly meeting of the Midland Regional
A27  43 Board for Industry.
A27  44    |^The number of people estimated to be on short time has dropped
A27  45 from a total of 29,400 including 21,500 car workers a month ago, to a
A27  46 total of 12,000 including just under 8,000 car workers.
A27  47    |^The total number unemployed in the last month has fallen by 2,800
A27  48 to just over 29,000.
A27  49    |^Major {0C. R.} Dibben, chairman of the board, told a Press
A27  50 conference, that most workers in the industry were now back to a full
A27  51 working week. ^*"Although the revival in car sales appears to be
A27  52 largely in the home market and difficulties in the exports' markets
A27  53 have continued, there is hope in the industry that the success of
A27  54 British cars at recent motor shows abroad foreshadows further
A27  55 increases in activity in the industry during the next four or five
A27  56 months,**" he said.
A27  57 *<*6EXPORT CAMPAIGN*>
A27  58    |^*0In Coventry, on April 10, there were 3,440 unemployed including
A27  59 700 on short time.
A27  60    |^A greater awareness of the need for exports by Midland
A27  61 manufacturers was reported by \0Mr. {0C. J.} Holman, regional
A27  62 director of the Board of Trade. ^As a result of the Government's
A27  63 export campaign, inquiries to the Board's Birmingham offices from
A27  64 firms had increased by 55 per cent. ^They came from about 600 firms
A27  65 all over the Midlands.
A27  66    |^A change to a decimal coinage system: *"as quickly as possible**"
A27  67 was recommended by the regional board after hearing views of members.
A27  68 *<*4Motor Exports Down in First Quarter*>
A27  69    |^C*2AR *0exports for the first quarter of this year at 85,219,
A27  70 represented the lowest quarterly figure since 1956, the Board of Trade
A27  71 said today.
A27  72    |^It was 5,000 below the figure for the final quarter of 1960 and
A27  73 nearly 100,000 below that for the first quarter of 1960.
A27  74    |^Car output for the quarter, at 218,003, was well below any
A27  75 quarterly figure for 1959 and 1960.
A27  76    |^But the Board's monthly statistics showed a brighter picture for
A27  77 commercial vehicles. ^The totals for exports in the quarter, at 48,358
A27  78 and production, at 119,745, were both well above corresponding figures
A27  79 for any quarter in 1959-60. ^(*"Motor Industry Expansion Hopes

A27  82 *<*4First Shots in Revolt*>
A27  83    |^*6FIRST *4fighting in the Algeria revolt broke out today when
A27  84 loyal forces repulsed an attempt by paratroops to storm the naval base
A27  85 of Mers \el Kebir, near Oran, western Algeria.
A27  86    |^*0According to official sources quoted by the French agency a
A27  87 French light cruiser fired warning shots as paratroops approached the
A27  88 base.
A27  89    |^Unconfirmed reports said troops and Marines resisted the attack
A27  90 and the paratroops withdrew soon afterwards.
A27  91    |^Two battalions of French motorised infantry were reported to have
A27  92 crossed the Rhine into France today, as the Armed Forces Ministry
A27  93 announced the recall of troops and armour from the 60,000 strong force
A27  94 in Germany to strengthen the Paris area.
A27  95    |^The capital had passed a second night of vigil against a possible
A27  96 airborne invasion from Algeria.
A27  97 *<*4Food Rush*>
A27  98    |^*0It was also announced that 10,000 reservists had been recalled
A27  99 and the 16th Infantry Division put on a war footing.
A27 100    |^A message from President De Gaulle will be read to the French
A27 101 National Assembly and Senate this afternoon.
A27 102    |^The French Grocers' Federation appealed to people today not to
A27 103 create a rush on foodstuffs. ^They said there was no reason to fear a
A27 104 food shortage.
A27 105    |^The appeal follows a rush by Parisian housewives yesterday to
A27 106 stock up with food.
A27 107 *<*6LAOS CEASE-FIRE NEAR?*>
A27 108    |^THE *4Royal Laotian Government has accepted the appeal made
A27 109 yesterday by the co-chairmen of the Geneva agreement (the British and
A27 110 Soviet Foreign Ministers), for a cease-fire in Laos.
A27 111    |^A Foreign Office spokesman said in London today: ^*"We very much
A27 112 welcome the Royal Laotian Government's acceptance of the cease-fire

A27 116 *<*5Move for Coach Drinks Fails*>
A27 117    |^*6A MOVE *4to enable alcoholic drinks to be sold to passengers in
A27 118 public vehicles on specified services was defeated today.
A27 119    |^*0\0Mr. William Clark, Conservative {0M.P.} for Nottingham
A27 120 South, proposed a new clause to the Government's Licensing Bill so
A27 121 that such drinks could be permitted.
A27 122    |^He told the Standing Committee on the Bill: ^*"You can eat in a
A27 123 long-distance coach in this country, you can softly drink, but you
A27 124 cannot have alcoholic drink.**"
A27 125    |^\0Mr. Marcus Lipton (\0Lab., Brixton) said he supported the new
A27 126 clause but he would not like to see *"24 hours drinking going on*-
A27 127 combined cruising and boozing while enjoying the beauties of the
A27 128 countryside.**"
A27 129 *<*5Public Concern*>
A27 130    |^\0Mr. Dennis Vosper, Minister of State, Home Office, said there
A27 131 ought not to be a close association of alcohol and road transport when
A27 132 there was so much public concern about road accidents.
A27 133    |^\0Mr. Harold Boardman (\0Lab., Leigh) said: ^*"Miners hire a
A27 134 private coach and fill up the boot with beer cases. ^People come down
A27 135 for the Cup Final in coaches carrying more beer bottles than
A27 136 passengers.**" (laughter.)
A27 137 *<*4Ceylon Cabinet Orders General Mobilisation*>
A27 138    |^T*0HE Ceylon Government today ordered general mobilisation and
A27 139 called out on active service nine units of volunteers and reservists
A27 140 of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Home Guards.
A27 141    |^The units were ordered to report for duty immediately. ^The Prime
A27 142 Minister, \0Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, said in a broadcast to the
A27 143 nation today that the Government had received information that various
A27 144 other organisations besides the recently banned opposition Federal
A27 145 Party were secretly planning to undermine the Government.
A27 146 *<*6DEATH PENALTY*>
A27 147    |^*0The estate strike yesterday morning was aimed at this and
A27 148 certain elements were using the bank clerks' strike to cause great
A27 149 economic harm to the country, she declared.
A27 150    |^\0Mrs. Bandaranaike called upon *"all patriotic Ceylonese to give
A27 151 their full support to the Government.**"
A27 152    |^By a proclamation last night, the death penalty for looting and
A27 153 arson, and other punishment for offences such as the breaking of
A27 154 bridges, obstruction to roads and damage to buses and trains was
A27 155 extended to the whole of the island.
A27 156    |^The measures had previously applied only to certain areas
A27 157 affected by recent trouble in Ceylon, arising out of a civil

A27 161    |^A *0BRITISH estate agent, \0Mr. Moliz Fleischmann, of \0St.
A27 162 John's Wood, London, told the court trying Adolf Eichmann, today, of
A27 163 the occasion 23 years ago when he faced the Nazi leader across a desk
A27 164 in the Gestapo's Vienna headquarters.
A27 165    |^\0Mr. Fleischmann, a former Jewish leader in Vienna, where he was
A27 166 born, escaped on one of the last trains out of the city before the
A27 167 outbreak of war.
A27 168    |^In March, 1938, he and other Jewish leaders were called to the
A27 169 Hotel Metropole, Gestapo headquarters, and taken before Eichmann.
A27 170    |^*"He sat at a large desk*- we had to stand,**" \0Mr. Fleischmann
A27 171 said. ^*"He was in uniform, the black {0S.S.} uniform which became
A27 172 very familiar to us later.
A27 173    |^*"He told us his task was to purify Vienna and Austria from Jews
A27 174 in the quickest possible way.
A27 175 **[END QUOTE**]
A27 176    |^Today, as he recalled those words, \0Mr. Fleischmann again faced
A27 177 Eichmann. ^The witness box from which he spoke is directly opposite
A27 178 the bulletproof glass-covered dock in which Eichmann sat.
A27 179    |^*"The influence of Eichmann's activity and the fear which
A27 180 developed in the heart of Viennese Jewry was felt immediately,**" said
A27 181 \0Mr. Fleischmann.
A27 182    |^Part of \0Mr. Fleischmann's testimony added to the mystery of
A27 183 Eichmann's birth. ^He said that at the Vienna interview Eichmann told
A27 184 him: ^*"I speak Hebrew and Yiddish fluently because I was born in
A27 185 Sharona**" (a German community near Tel Aviv, Israel).
A27 186    |^But in interrogation Eichmann has told his captors that he was
A27 187 born at Solingen, Germany, and cannot understand how the idea got
A27 188 about that he is Palestine-born.
A27 189 *<*4Protest Over Berkswell Footpaths*>
A27 190    |^T*2HREE *0Berkswell footpaths and one at Bickenhill, which are
A27 191 all used by visitors, ramblers and residents in the areas, should not
A27 192 be closed, Meriden {0R.D.C.} is to tell British Railways.
A27 193    |^Asking for closure orders, British Railways say the footpaths
A27 194 cross railway lines and will be affected by the Coventry-Birmingham
A27 195 main line electrification scheme.
A27 196    |^People who live in the neighbourhood and ramblers were asked
A27 197 their opinion before Meriden {0R.D.C.} came to its decision.
A27 198    |^Berkswell Parish Council strongly opposes any proposal to close
A27 199 the footpath which runs from the south of Truggist Lane, crossing the
A27 200 railway line short of the eastern side of Berkswell Station.
A27 201 *<*6ASSOCIATION'S EVIDENCE*>
A27 202    |^*0It considered that this path was an important right of way
A27 203 linking the southern part of the parish with the village and the
A27 204 church. ^The Ramblers' Association also confirmed that this path was
A27 205 used by their Coventry-based clubs.
A27 206    |^The association provided evidence to prove that paths which
A27 207 linked Kenilworth Road with Wootton Lane and Bradnocks Marsh Lane were
A27 208 frequently used, although the parish council raised no objections to
A27 209 closures.
A27 210    |^The closing of a fourth footpath, connecting Old Station Road
A27 211 with Church Lane, Bickenhill, is being opposed by the local parish
A27 212 council and the Ramblers' Association.

A27 218    |^Nearly 400 wives and relatives of licensees belonging to the
A27 219 association were at the rally. ^They are responsible for a great deal
A27 220 of charity work, both nationally and in the licensed trade.

A27 222    |^*0They were told by Rear-Admiral {0W. G.} Brittain, director of
A27 223 the National Trade Development Association, a body which helps to
A27 224 co-ordinate relations between the brewer and the publican, that under
A27 225 the new Bill the penalty for under-age drinkers would go up from *+2
A27 226 to *+25.
A27 227    |^*"I hope that will choke off some of them from their games and
A27 228 give you a more peaceful life in your houses,**" he said.
A27 229    |^Rear-Admiral Brittain said the Government had clearly decided
A27 230 that the country must *"go Continental**" and give drink licenses to
A27 231 restaurants and boarding houses. ^For better or for worse this would
A27 232 bring competition to the licensed trade.

A28  31 *<*6MEETING*>
A28  32    |^*0This three-day visit is President Kennedy's first to Europe

A28 151    |^As they grasped hands at the top of the nine stone steps leading
A28 152 to the residence door, \0Mr. Kennedy said to his interpreter: ^*"Ask
A28 153 him if it would be all right to shake hands again for the
A28 154 photographers.**"
A28 155    |^\0Mr. Kruschev agreed, and they vigorously shook hands again.
A28 156    |^Then they went inside to the white-walled music room to begin
A28 157 their first talks*- over lunch.
A28 158 *<*6CHEERS*>
A28 159    |^*0As President Kennedy drove from the airport, people stood and
A28 160 cheered in the rain.
A28 161    |^Some carried banners reading ^*"Help Berlin.**" ^One said:
A28 162 ^*"Give him hell, Jack.**"
A28 163    |^\0Mr. Kruschev drove into the grounds of the residence in a black
A28 164 Zil limousine with his Foreign Minister, \0Mr. Gromyko, about 25
A28 165 minutes after \0Mr. Kennedy and his Secretary of State, \0Mr. Rusk.
A28 166    |^After lunch, the talks were to continue until 6 {0p.m.} round a
A28 167 coffee table in a small room furnished in red and grey in early
A28 168 American style.
A28 169    |^\0Mrs. Kennedy reached the residence earlier at the head of
A28 170 another convoy of cars, having driven direct from the airport.
A28 171 *<*6COMIC STRIP*>
A28 172    |^*0A series of comic-strip mishaps frustrated President Kennedy's
A28 173 attempts to leave Paris. ^Eventually his aircraft took off*- a quarter
A28 174 of an hour behind schedule.
A28 175    |^First the *2CAR *0carrying \0Mr. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State,
A28 176 broke down on the way to the airport. ^It was pushed off the road and
A28 177 another one was produced, but the party was ten minutes late reaching
A28 178 the airport.
A28 179    |^Then just as the Presidential jet was about to taxi on to the
A28 180 runway another group of the party rushed on to the tarmac and a packet
A28 181 of *2NEWSPAPERS *0was also thrown aboard.
A28 182    |^At last the plane's doors were again closed and it taxied off.
A28 183 ^But then a massive American *2SECRET SERVICE MAN *0ran after it,
A28 184 gesticulating and shouting for it to stop.
A28 185    |^He was breathlessly followed by Providencia, \0Mrs. Kennedy's
A28 186 *2COLOURED MAID, *0who had apparently got left behind while she
A28 187 searched for a lost suitcase.
A28 188 *<*6THE MAID*>
A28 189    |^*0No sooner was Providencia on board than yet another late-comer
A28 190 was seen running across the tarmac. ^It was *"Tish,**" \0Mrs.
A28 191 Kennedy's *2SOCIAL SECRETARY, *0Miss Letitia Baldridge.
A28 192    |^Then, with all passengers apparently aboard, the jet finally got
A28 193 under way for Vienna.
A28 194    |^There were cries of ~*"Goodbye Jackie**" and ~*"Goodbye Madame**"
A28 195 as \0Mrs. Kennedy, wearing a light blue woollen overcoat, a white
A28 196 straw hat and gloves, walked towards the aircraft just behind the
A28 197 President.
A28 198    |^With them were \0M. Debre, the French Prime Minister, \0M.

A28 202 *<*0By JOSEPH TOBIN, Our Political Correspondent.*>
A28 203    |^*6\0M*0R. MACMILLAN and President Kennedy today considered the
A28 204 next critical steps towards a full Summit conference of the major
A28 205 powers.
A28 206    |^With Summit diplomacy revived in a spectacular fashion by the
A28 207 Vienna meeting with \0Mr. Kruschev, the President considered with the
A28 208 Prime Minister the chances of a meeting of the Big Four soon.
A28 209    |^This was the highlight of the review of East-West relations in
A28 210 the meeting between the President and the Prime Minister.
A28 211    |^The talks lasted for three hours. ^This was a surprise, for they
A28 212 had only been scheduled to last two hours.
A28 213    |^But it is understood that the Prime Minister and the President
A28 214 extended their meeting to consider fully \0Mr. Kruschev's tough
A28 215 attitude on several major questions at the Vienna meeting.
A28 216    |^The Russians are said to be taking up a tougher attitude on many
A28 217 problems, particularly on Berlin.
A28 218    |^There was complete agreement between the Premier and the
A28 219 President on the West's policy concerning Berlin.
A28 220    |^The two men met alone in the Prime Minister's study at Admiralty
A28 221 House.
A28 222 *<*7ARRIVED EARLY*>
A28 223    |^*0The President surprised the Prime Minister's staff by arriving
A28 224 ten minutes early for the talks.
A28 225    |^In their man-to-man exchanges they also considered the situation
A28 226 in Laos.
A28 227    |^Above all, they considered the future of *"Summitry.**" ^They had
A28 228 to answer the question: *"Does the Vienna meeting, with its vague
A28 229 goodwill, but no practical results, justify further steps along the
A28 230 same road.**"
A28 231 *<*7COMMON MARKET*>
A28 232    |^*0The President also reported on \0Mr. Kruschev's attitude to
A28 233 nuclear testing and disarmament. ^All reports are that \0Mr. Kruschev
A28 234 was unyielding on these two issues.
A28 235    |^It is understood that \0Mr. Macmillan also questioned the
A28 236 President on his earlier talks with President \de Gaulle. ^This
A28 237 meeting may have a crucial bearing on Britain's possible entry into
A28 238 the common market.
A28 239 *<*7AT THE PALACE*>
A28 240    |^*0This evening the Premier and President will issue a communique
A28 241 on their talks.
A28 242    |^Tonight the Kennedys will go to Buckingham Palace for dinner with
A28 243 the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

A29   3 *<*5{0U.S.} troops threatened in a second incident*>
A29   4    |^*4East German police to-day shot streams of water at West
A29   5 Berliners standing within 100\0yds. of the border, on the Western
A29   6 side, West Berlin police reported.
A29   7    |^*0The East German Interior Ministry on Tuesday told West
A29   8 Berliners to keep 100\0yds. from the borders. ^The Western
A29   9 commandants, ordering Allied troops up to the border yesterday,
A29  10 described this as *"effrontery.**"
A29  11    |^In another incident, an East German police officer to-day called
A29  12 on American soldiers standing just behind the sector border
A29  13 demarcation line to withdraw, and when the Americans did not move a
A29  14 water cannon lorry drove up on the East Berlin side, a West German
A29  15 News Agency reported. ^But after a while the water hose was withdrawn
A29  16 with the Americans still in position.
A29  17    |^East Berlin police last night threw several tear gas grenades
A29  18 into a group of 40 West Berliners listening to a West Berlin
A29  19 loudspeaker van which had drawn up close to the border to broadcast
A29  20 news.
A29  21    |^Winds blew the tear gas back across the border and someone in the
A29  22 crowd threw one of the grenades back, a police spokesman said.
A29  23 *<*4*"Showing flag**"*>
A29  24    |^*0Meanwhile British, American and French troops, backed by tanks,
A29  25 to-day stood guard along the city's dividing line.
A29  26    |^The troops took station yesterday along the city sector boundary
A29  27 after the East German Government introduced stringent new regulations
A29  28 for passage from one half of the city to the other.
A29  29    |^They remained on guard all night, and to-day British forces, with
A29  30 tanks and armoured cars, took part in their second *"show-the-flag**"
A29  31 exercise in three days.
A29  32    |^The Dutch and Swedish consulates in Berlin said to-day they had
A29  33 received reports that foreign residents in East Germany were having
A29  34 difficulties in leaving the territory.
A29  35    |^In East Berlin, Foreign Ministry officials said they had not
A29  36 heard of any new regulations banning foreigners from going to West
A29  37 Berlin.
A29  38 *<*4Offices shut*>
A29  39    |^*0No offices of the East German travel agency were opened in West
A29  40 Berlin to-day *"because the West Berlin City Government refused
A29  41 permission,**" an East German railway official said.
A29  42    |^Moscow Radio said in an English-language broadcast beamed at
A29  43 Britain that ~*"Whitehall is playing a dangerous game with fire across
A29  44 a powder magazine**" over the Berlin issue.
A29  45    |^*"Such deeds are fraught with the danger of a military
A29  46 catastrophe in which Britain, too, would be involved,**" said the
A29  47 broadcast.
A29  48 *<*6THREAT TO AIR CORRIDOR *'SERIOUS**'*>
A29  49    |^*4Britain would regard any threat to the air communications with
A29  50 Berlin as *"an extremely serious matter,**" said a Foreign Office
A29  51 spokesman in London to-day.
A29  52    |^*0He had been asked about the Berlin air corridors which, it is
A29  53 understood, are referred to in the new Soviet Note on the Berlin
A29  54 situation. ^He would not, however, make any official comment on the
A29  55 Note itself.
A29  56    |^It is understood that the references on the air corridors
A29  57 introduces **[SIC**] a new element into the situation, writes a
A29  58 diplomatic correspondent.
A29  59 *<*4Being studied*>
A29  60    |^*0The full text of the Note was received by the Foreign Office
A29  61 to-day from the British Embassy in Moscow. ^Similar Notes have been
A29  62 delivered to the United States and French Governments.
A29  63    |^The Notes are being studied by the three Western powers and will
A29  64 also be discussed by the ambassadorial steering group in Washington,
A29  65 on which Britain, the {0U.S.}, France and West Germany are
A29  66 represented.
A29  67    |^According to the Soviet news agency Tass*- quoted by Reuter*- the
A29  68 Soviet Government have protested in the Notes against the use of the
A29  69 air corridors to West Berlin for *"subversive and revenge-seeking aims
A29  70 of West German militarists.**"
A29  71 *<*4*"Provocative**"*>
A29  72    |^*0The Notes demanded that the Western powers take *"immediate
A29  73 measures to end the unlawful and provocative activities**" of the West
A29  74 German Government in West Berlin.
A29  75    |^The Notes also said there had been *"a flagrant breach of the
A29  76 agreement reached in 1945 under which air corridors were set aside for
A29  77 the three Western powers, on a temporary basis, to ensure the needs of
A29  78 their military garrisons, and not for subversive and revanchist
A29  79 purposes of West German militarism.**"
A29  80    |^Russia insisted that the Western powers *"take immediate measures
A29  81 to put an end to the unlawful and provocative actions of the Federal
A29  82 German Republic in West Berlin.**"
A29  83 *<*7ROW FLARES AT BERLIN STATION*>
A29  84 *<*5But Premier optimistic*>
A29  85    |^*4Tension in Berlin soared again to-day with angry protests over
A29  86 travel restrictions imposed by the East Germans and a threat by the
A29  87 West of *"necessary action.**"
A29  88    |^*0On the brighter side, \0Mr. Macmillan gave an impromptu news
A29  89 conference on the Gleneagles golf course and said he thought no-one
A29  90 would fight over Berlin, and \0Mr. Khrushchev was quoted as saying
A29  91 that he was willing to talk over the difficulties.
A29  92    |^The East German restriction which caused to-day's trouble
A29  93 concerned the issuing of permits for West Berliners wishing to travel
A29  94 to the East on the overhead railway.
A29  95    |^The Western Commandants authorised the City Government to take
A29  96 *"necessary action**" against the issuing of permits.
A29  97    |^*4Angry West Berliners, shouting, ~*"Get out, you pigs,**"
A29  98 gathered outside the Zoo railway station to-day after the East German
A29  99 officials who run it started issuing permits.
A29 100    |^*0Six policemen kept the crowd of 50 to 60 people at a distance,
A29 101 but one woman who went up to the ticket window to get an application
A29 102 form for a permit was spat on by a fellow West Berliner.
A29 103 *<*4Offices shut*>
A29 104    |^*0Finally the office was shut, along with a similar office at
A29 105 Westkureuz Station.
A29 106    |^The {0U.S.} Commandant in Berlin has made an oral protest to
A29 107 his Soviet counterpart *"concerning the illegal regulations issued by
A29 108 East German authorities in recent days and incidents arising
A29 109 therefrom.**"
A29 110    |^The 1st Battalion the Welch Regiment **[SIC**] increased patrols
A29 111 on the border between the British sector of West Berlin and East
A29 112 Germany to-day to counter increased East German activity on the other
A29 113 side.
A29 114    |^\0Mr. Macmillan, who is holidaying in Scotland, spoke to
A29 115 reporters on the 18th fairway of the golf course. ^He declared:
A29 116 ^*"Berlin is one of those things we have to be careful about*- that
A29 117 nobody does anything foolish.
A29 118 *<*4*'Risk of folly**'*>
A29 119    |^*0*"I think there would be much more danger of war if weapons
A29 120 were not so destructive. ^Fifty years ago we could have had a war.
A29 121 ^Now it is not much fun for anybody.
A29 122    |^*"But there is always the danger of folly. ^I think the way it is
A29 123 going on is very worrying, but nothing more.**"
A29 124    |^To-morrow \0Mr. Macmillan is to discuss the Berlin situation with
A29 125 Lord Home, the Foreign Secretary, at Gleneagles. ^It was learned
A29 126 to-day that Lord Home will afterwards go to stay privately with Queen
A29 127 Elizabeth the Queen Mother at Birkhall.
A29 128    |^In Copenhagen, Drew Pearson, syndicated American newspaper
A29 129 columnist, said that \0Mr. Krushchev had told him he was willing to
A29 130 meet Western leaders *"as soon as possible.**"
A29 131 *<*5*'Strongest protest**' over Caldon Canal closure plan*>
A29 132 *<*7URGENT MATTER, SAY CHEADLE {0R.D.C.}*>
A29 133    |^*4Cheadle Rural Council's Town Planning and Plans Committee
A29 134 decided yesterday to protest *"in the strongest possible terms**"
A29 135 against the proposal to close part of the Caldon Canal between
A29 136 Hazelhurst New Locks and Froghall. ^Later the full council endorsed
A29 137 this step *"as a matter of urgency.**"
A29 138    |^*0At their last meeting the committee were told by the Deputy
A29 139 Area Planning Officer, \0Mr. \0B. Skelland, that it was planned
A29 140 eventually to *"reintegrate**" that section of the canal with the
A29 141 adjoining land.
A29 142    |^Yesterday the committee were informed that the proposal to close
A29 143 the canal had been made by the British Transport Commission to the
A29 144 Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee.
A29 145    |^In a letter, the Inland Waterways Protection Society told the
A29 146 committee that in the case of each threatened canal, they carried out
A29 147 an inspection of every yard of the waterway and eventually submitted a
A29 148 scheme to the Redevelopment Committee showing how the canal under
A29 149 review could, if properly managed, be made to pay its way.
A29 150    |^Claiming that their schemes had always been ignored, the society
A29 151 maintained that all details concerning the closing of the Caldon
A29 152 Branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal were worked out years ago and
A29 153 were one further step towards the *"elimination**" of the inland
A29 154 waterways.
A29 155    |^The society pointed out that the present capital value of the
A29 156 Caldon Canal was in the region of *+20 millions.
A29 157 *<*4*"Alarmed**"*>
A29 158    |^*0It was also reported that the Service of Youth Scheme and
A29 159 Kingsley and Ipstones Parish Council were unanimously opposed to the
A29 160 proposed closure of the canal.
A29 161    |^The Froghall firm of Thomas Bolton and Sons \0Ltd., said they
A29 162 were *"alarmed**" at the possibility of the canal being closed, and
A29 163 the elimination of the water-feed from the canal to their works would
A29 164 have *"extremely serious consequences**" and might result in the
A29 165 closing of much plant unless satisfactory alternatives were provided.
A29 166    |^Another firm affected by the proposed closure, \0W. Podmore and
A29 167 Sons \0Ltd., of Shelton, who have a factory at Consall, pointed out
A29 168 that any extraction of water would seriously affect their interests.
A29 169    |^Brittains \0Ltd., of Cheddleton Paper Mills, said their own use
A29 170 of the canal had diminished over the years, and if the time came for
A29 171 disposal of parts of the canal, they would be very interested in
A29 172 considering the purchase of that portion which lay alongside their
A29 173 factory.
A29 174    |^The Chairman of the Planning Committee, \0Mr. {0J. H.} Aberley,
A29 175 recommended that the council should protest most strongly against the
A29 176 closure. ^He pointed out that the council were not in a position to
A29 177 put in a piped water supply to factories.
A29 178 *<*4*"Lifeblood**"*>
A29 179    |^\0*0Mr. {0T. P.} Brindley suggested that firms taking water
A29 180 from the canal should be asked to contribute towards its upkeep.
A29 181 ^Instead of thinking of closing the canal, he said, steps should be
A29 182 taken to find out if the silt could be removed and the canal restored
A29 183 to its full industrial use, particularly as the railway was now closed
A29 184 to passenger traffic.
A29 185    |^\0Mr. {0F. R.} Ford commented: ^*"It is time this country spent
A29 186 a bit more money on canals. ^They are the lifeblood of some countries,
A29 187 and they can still do a lot for this country.**" ^He suggested that
A29 188 the money for *"reintegrating**" the canal with the adjoining land
A29 189 would be better spent in cleaning it up and making it usable again.**"

A29 193 the Geneva conference on the banning of nuclear tests, which started
A29 194 to-day, said before leaving London Airport: ^*"I am not very
A29 195 optimistic in the present climate.**"
A29 196    |^*0Former Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, he added: ^*"But
A29 197 we mean to make a real effort to get the Russians moving again in

A29 199    |^He added that it would probably be his last attendance at the
A29 200 talks before taking up his fresh post as Britain's Ambassador in
A29 201 Washington in October.
A29 202    |^\0Mr. Ormsby-Gore, asked if he was hopeful of a solution being
A29 203 found in view of the Berlin crisis, said: ^*"I think the general
A29 204 political atmosphere is not conducive to progress in any negotiations
A29 205 with the Soviet Union at the present time.
A29 206    |^*"I do not say it has eliminated any hope of settlement, but
A29 207 clearly the Soviet Union do not appear at the moment to be very
A29 208 interested in reaching any agreements with the West.**"
A29 209 *<*4Deadlock*>
A29 210    |^*0Asked if the deadlock was likely to continue in the talks, he
A29 211 said: ^*"I do not know at all. ^It will depend upon the instructions
A29 212 \0Mr. Tsarapkin (the Russian delegate) has brought back with him from
A29 213 Moscow.**"
A29 214    |^In the talks, the West were making yet another determined bid to
A29 215 try to get a nuclear test ban treaty with Russia.

A30   3 *<*4A momentous year in prospect*>
A30   4    |^*6\0CLR. HARRY FRANCE BROOK *4became Huddersfield's sixty-first
A30   5 Mayor and was also elected an alderman at the annual meeting of the
A30   6 Town Council this afternoon.
A30   7    |^*0\0Ald. Brook has been a Liberal representative for the Birkby
A30   8 Ward since 1944. ^He is chairman of directors and founder of the firm
A30   9 of \0Messrs. {0H. F.} Brook and \0Co. \0Ltd., woollen merchants and
A30  10 clothiers, \0St. John's Road, Huddersfield. ^His daughter, \0Mrs. Jean
A30  11 \0W. Nicholson, is the new Mayoress.
A30  12    |^More than 1,500 flowers and potted plants, delicately arranged by
A30  13 the Corporation Parks Department staff, provided a brilliant
A30  14 background for the Town Hall ceremony.
A30  15    |^\0Ald. Day, the retiring Mayor, presided over the ceremony. ^He
A30  16 and \0Mrs. Day are to serve as the Deputy Mayor and Mayoress.
A30  17    |^\0Clr. {0A. J.} Hazelden, moving the resolution to elect \0Clr.
A30  18 Brook, said: ^*"The name of Brook has for scores of years been
A30  19 associated with Huddersfield, and for nearly the lifetime of the
A30  20 county borough since its incorporation 1868 there has been a Brook a
A30  21 member of this Council.
A30  22    |^*"Our new Mayor will be the fifth of that name in the long
A30  23 history of Huddersfield,**" he went on.
A30  24    |^*1\0Clr. Hazelden said that Brook was a good old Anglo-Saxon
A30  25 name*- and one with two meanings. ^The first meaning*- that of
A30  26 *"stream**"*- was appropriate having regard to the number of Brooks
A30  27 who had served the Council today and in the past. ^The second
A30  28 meaning*- *"to suffer insult or injury**"*- would, they all sincerely
A30  29 hoped, not be the lot of the Mayor-elect!
A30  30    |^*0\0Clr. Brook began his education in two of the local schools.
A30  31    |^As a boy and a man his interests had covered a very wide field*-
A30  32 he (\0Clr. Hazelden) understood that in the world of sport,
A30  33 particularly, the new Mayor had shown considerable ability as a
A30  34 footballer and a cricketer and, more latterly, as a bowler.
A30  35    |^His work on the Council over the many years of his service had
A30  36 been outstanding in more than one respect.
A30  37    |^*"Among the many committees of which he has been a member it
A30  38 cannot be said that his sincerity and purpose have been lacking in any
A30  39 degree,**" said \0Clr. Hazelden.
A30  40    |^\0Clr. Hazelden went on to refer to the various committees on
A30  41 which \0Clr. Brook served*- including the Children's Committee, of
A30  42 which he was Chairman, the Watch Committee of which he was also
A30  43 Chairman, and the Mental Health Sub-Committee of the Health Committee.
A30  44 *<*4Desire to *"play the game**"*>
A30  45    |^*0*"All of us know the remarks made about the Watch Committee*-
A30  46 and they are not always too kind,**" said \0Clr. Hazelden.
A30  47    |^*"The source of law and order is not always very popular, but is
A30  48 still very essential, and \0Clr. Brook, the chairman, has a knowledge
A30  49 of police administration not only locally but nationally, for he was a
A30  50 member of the Police Committee of the Association of Municipal
A30  51 Corporations and a representative on the Police Training College
A30  52 Board.**"
A30  53    |^\0Clr. Brook saw to it that certain minimum standards were
A30  54 conformed with and no-one could deny his fairness. ^*"His views,
A30  55 although not accepted, are in accordance with the earnest desire*- be
A30  56 it in the civic field of duty or on the field of sport*- to *'play the
A30  57 game.**'**"
A30  58    |^*4The new civic year could be a momentous one for Huddersfield.
A30  59 ^It might well be that the foundations of the *"new Huddersfield**"
A30  60 would be laid, and never before had such tremendous innovations and
A30  61 plans for the future been contemplated.
A30  62    |^*0Not only were the Council there to acknowledge the new Mayor,
A30  63 said \0Clr. Hazelden, but for the second time in Huddersfield's long
A30  64 history they were to honour their new Mayor with an aldermanic seat.
A30  65    |^\0Clr. Hazelden recalled that in 1873, when \0Clr. Henry Brook
A30  66 was elected Mayor, he too was made an alderman at the same time.
A30  67    |^\0Clr. Hazelden's election motion was supported by \0Clrs. \0Mrs.
A30  68 \0R. Townsend and {0C. C.} Hoyle.
A30  69    |^\0Clr. \0Mrs. Townsend said that people should be grateful that
A30  70 men of \0Clr. Brook's calibre and business acumen gave their services
A30  71 to the community.
A30  72 *<*4Severe test of stamina*>
A30  73    |^*0\0Clr. Hoyle said that a Mayor's life was a severe test of
A30  74 physical and moral stamina. ^The year of office was filled to capacity
A30  75 with deputations, speeches, receptions and many other duties*-
A30  76 including about 700 meetings concerned with Council affairs.
A30  77    |^Notwithstanding this terrific strain, the Mayors impressed
A30  78 everyone not only by their ability but by their strength of character
A30  79 and sincerity of thought.
A30  80    |^\0Clr. Brook possessed those qualities in high degree. ^*"Here is
A30  81 someone whose friendship is a possession to be cherished,**" \0Clr.
A30  82 Hoyle added.
A30  83    |^On his return to the Council meeting attired in the Mayoral
A30  84 robes, and after taking the oath of office, the new Mayor thanked the
A30  85 Council for the honour they had accorded to him. ^He was very proud to
A30  86 be Mayor of his native town*- a town for which he had a great
A30  87 affection. ^He was proud of Huddersfield's name in municipal
A30  88 government. ^*"We who serve on the Town Council have our critics,**"
A30  89 \0Clr. Brook continued. ^*"While criticism of a constructive kind is
A30  90 good, I have little patience with he who praises with enthusiastic
A30  91 tone all centuries but this, and every town but his own.**"
A30  92    |^All members of the Council, irrespective of their political
A30  93 views, were animated by the desire to make Huddersfield worthy of its
A30  94 citizens. ^It was true to say of everyone entering local government*-
A30  95 not least a mayor*- that he or she became a visionary.
A30  96 *<*4More delectable place*>
A30  97    |^*"I have a vision of Huddersfield of the not-too-distant future
A30  98 when the great schemes, some already nearing completion, have come to
A30  99 fruition,**" the Mayor continued.
A30 100    |^*0*"Huddersfield will then be a more delectable place.**"
A30 101    |^After listing the various developments the Mayor said that all
A30 102 these were necessary schemes that could only be carried out at cost
A30 103 and some inconvenience. ^It was important, therefore, that they should
A30 104 take the public into their confidence and seek their support for these
A30 105 latest efforts in municipal enterprise.
A30 106    |^In many of the functions of a local authority it was not enough
A30 107 that a task should be done efficiently, but that it must also be done
A30 108 sympathetically.
A30 109    |^Impersonality and coldness would alienate and repel, however
A30 110 impressive the achievement, and however faultless the organisation.
A30 111    |^Speaking of the fact that his daughter would be undertaking the
A30 112 duties of Mayoress, \0Clr. Brook stressed the point that she would
A30 113 seek to combine her official duties with those of having to run a home
A30 114 and a very young family. ^He hoped that the demands made on her during
A30 115 working hours would not be too great.
A30 116    |^He concluded: ^*"I am very conscious of the confidence you have
A30 117 reposed in me and I trust that when, a year hence, the time comes for
A30 118 me to surrender my regalia of office, I shall be able to pass it on
A30 119 unsullied to my successor, and you will feel that that confidence was
A30 120 not misplaced.**"
A30 121 *<*4Put Huddersfield on the map*>
A30 122    |^*0A vote of thanks to the retiring Mayor was proposed by \0Clr.
A30 123 {0E. L.} Thackray and supported by \0Clrs. \0D. Sisson and {0B.
A30 124 M.} Schofield.
A30 125    |^\0Clr. Thackray said that their warmest thanks were due to \0Ald.
A30 126 and \0Mrs. Day, who had not spared themselves in carrying out their
A30 127 duties.
A30 128    |^\0Ald. Day had lost no opportunity of *"selling Huddersfield**"
A30 129 on official visits, and he had put Huddersfield on the map with
A30 130 dignity. ^He himself had always remained a very likeable person, and
A30 131 had presided efficiently over Council meetings.
A30 132    |^\0Clr. Sisson spoke of the fine co-operation \0Ald. Day had had
A30 133 from his employers, \0Messrs. Thomas Broadbent and Sons \0Ltd.,
A30 134 engineers, which had enabled him to perform all his Mayoral duties.
A30 135    |^\0Clr. Schofield remarked that he had served under \0Ald. Day's
A30 136 chairmanship on the Markets and Fairs Committee all the time that he
A30 137 (\0Clr. Schofield) had been on the Council. ^He praised the valuable
A30 138 work \0Ald. Day had done during his long association with that
A30 139 committee.
A30 140 *<*4People *"made us feel at home**"*>
A30 141    |^*0\0Ald. Day said in reply that he and the retiring Mayoress had
A30 142 had the feeling during their period of office that they were the heads
A30 143 of a *"large and united family.**"
A30 144    |^*4*"The people of Huddersfield, of all ages, classes, creeds and
A30 145 colour, have made us feel at home and welcome on all occasions. ^We
A30 146 look back with very happy memories on the year which is now
A30 147 passing.**"
A30 148    |^*0\0Ald. Day recalled that twelve months ago he expressed the
A30 149 hope that during his Mayoralty he would see much of the old property
A30 150 in the town demolished and derelict sites made more presentable.
A30 151    |^*4*"I venture to say that since that day there have never been
A30 152 more buildings pulled down and new ones put up in any one year of our
A30 153 lifetime,**" he told the Council.
A30 154    |^*0*"I think it can truly be said that Huddersfield is
A30 155 experiencing the biggest *'face-lift**' in its history, and the boom
A30 156 in new buildings and road construction indicates *'full steam ahead**'
A30 157 for a long time to come.**"
A30 158    |^\0Ald. Day paid tribute to the Mayoress for her support and also
A30 159 thanked the Deputy Mayor and Mayoress (\0Clr. and \0Mrs. \0F. Lawton),
A30 160 the Town Clerk (\0Mr. \0H. Bann), the Mayor's Secretary (\0Mr. \0W.

A30 186    |^*0The statement read:
A30 187 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
A30 188    |^The Labour group on the Council are opposed in principle to the
A30 189 election of persons to the office of alderman from outside the elected
A30 190 representatives to the Council.
A30 191    |^We fully appreciate that such elections are legally admissible,
A30 192 and that in fact such elections have been made from time to time by
A30 193 all parties in various towns and cities of this country. ^Nevertheless
A30 194 we feel that it is contrary to our democratic principles to elect
A30 195 people to the office of alderman, enabling them to have equal rights
A30 196 in the government of our town with those persons who have been
A30 197 democratically elected as councillors by the votes of the people.
A30 198    |^Indeed, we had every reason to believe that this principle would
A30 199 be accepted by all parties on the Council in view of the fact that, by
A30 200 signed agreement between the parties concerning the filling of
A30 201 aldermanic vacancies, such vacancies should be filled from the elected
A30 202 representatives at the time in proportion to party strength*- the
A30 203 exception being that when, for some special reason, a nomination is
A30 204 made from outside elected representatives, this should only be done by
A30 205 agreement among all parties.
A30 206 *<*4*"We shall refrain**"*>
A30 207    |^*0We therefore feel that by the nominations on this occasion both
A30 208 Liberal and Conservative Parties have violated the spirit of such
A30 209 agreement in addition to the principle of democratic election by the
A30 210 people.
A30 211    |^Therefore on this occasion we intend to support the election of
A30 212 the nominees of the Liberal and Conservative parties who are members
A30 213 at the time of election but we shall refrain from supporting the two

A32   2 *<*6TO CONTEST WOOD DITTON STAKES*>
A32   3 *<*5Pinturischio Has Impressed*>
A32   4 *<By *7OLD ROWLEY*>
A32   5 *<*6NEWMARKET, *4Thursday.*>
A32   6    |^*6PINTURISCHIO *4is expected to make his long-awaited debut in
A32   7 the Wood Ditton Stakes at our Craven meeting a week today. ^Even
A32   8 though he has not been seriously tried at home, let alone raced, this
A32   9 colt whom Noel Murless trains for Sir Victor Sassoon, is already
A32  10 ante-post favourite for the Derby.
A32  11    |^*0On Saturday morning, Pinturischio did his most informative work
A32  12 to date, but it would be presumptuous to say that observers were left
A32  13 a great deal wiser as to his ability. ^The gallop took place over a
A32  14 mile on the Racecourse Side, where he was accompanied by Aurelius
A32  15 (Lester Piggott), Hunter's Song and Magnificat, three other maidens.
A32  16    |^Throughout most of the trip Pinturischio was held up about a
A32  17 length behind his workmates, who were galloping in line abreast. ^Then
A32  18 with half a furlong left, his pilot let out a reef and asked him to
A32  19 run up to them. ^Pinturischio responded instantaneously and shot up to
A32  20 them, only to be steadied again. ^The manner in which he accelerated
A32  21 when given the *"office**" was that of a high-class horse, and
A32  22 reminiscent of what we used to see \0St. Paddy do at this time last
A32  23 year.
A32  24    |^Whatever Pinturischio has been asked to do to date, he has
A32  25 accomplished in effortless style, and his future is obviously
A32  26 extremely bright. ^By and large it is usually as well to dismiss
A32  27 home-trained colts that did not race at two years of age from one's
A32  28 calculations on the Derby.
A32  29 *<*4Long Stride*>
A32  30    |^*0It stands to reason that if a horse is too backward to race
A32  31 during his first season in training, he is most unlikely to be
A32  32 sufficiently mature to beat the best of his generation in the late May
A32  33 or early June of the following year, and it is a number of years now
A32  34 since a horse that embarked upon its three-year-old career unraced has
A32  35 won the Derby.
A32  36    |^*4Captain Boyd-Rochfort's Prince Simon came within an ace of
A32  37 doing so in 1950, and it is interesting to note that he made a winning
A32  38 debut in the Wood Ditton Stakes.
A32  39    |^*0The foregoing precedent need not prejudice our assessment of
A32  40 Pinturischio's prospects unduly, as there are extenuating
A32  41 circumstances in his case.
A32  42    |^He did start to come to himself last back-end, and he impressed
A32  43 on several occasions when his long stride enabled him to lay up in
A32  44 seven furlong spins with more forward companions. ^Such was his
A32  45 progress during those Autumn months that Noel Murless had intended to
A32  46 give him an outing on the Rowley Mile course here, but unfortunately
A32  47 the going came up heavy and the project was abandoned.
A32  48 *<*4Stern Opposition*>
A32  49    |^*0Although the Wood Ditton Stakes is confined to three-year-olds
A32  50 that have never run at starting, the opposition is likely to be stern
A32  51 enough to test Pinturischio.
A32  52    |^Jack Jarvis's Allenby and Captain Boyd-Rochfort's Sagacity have
A32  53 been working as though they will prove particularly formidable rivals
A32  54 to him. ^Allenby is much more forward than Pinturischio and the other
A32  55 morning he was not disgraced in a seven furlong gallop with Test Case,
A32  56 Pinzon and Bold Liver.
A32  57    |^*4Of course Allenby has no claims to being the peer of the
A32  58 stable's Derby horse Test Case, but he fared well enough in the
A32  59 latter's company to suggest that he will be a factor with which to be
A32  60 reckoned in any maiden race.
A32  61    |^*0The morning of the day in which Harry Carr met with his
A32  62 accident at Lincoln, he rode Sagacity in a six furlong gallop with
A32  63 Pardao (\0D. Smith), Good Old Days (\0T. Lowrey) and the four-year-old
A32  64 Polo (\0W. Snaith) on the Racecourse Side. ^Carr held Sagacity a
A32  65 couple of lengths behind the others from start to finish in this spin,
A32  66 and considering that the trip was too sharp for such a big horse as
A32  67 this handsome son of Le Sage he acquitted himself extremely well.
A32  68    |^Sagacity could be the one to give Pinturischio most to do if they
A32  69 meet next Thursday.
A32  70 *<*4An Omen*>
A32  71    |^*0Pinturischio has impressed so much by the way in which he has
A32  72 done his work rather than what he has done in it, that I fully expect
A32  73 him to lay a solid foundation to his claims to be considered the Derby
A32  74 winner by scoring on the first occasion he faces the racecourse's acid
A32  75 test.
A32  76    |^*4There are flowers on the Poor Boy's grave, the resting place of
A32  77 a shepherd boy, who committed suicide after losing his master's sheep
A32  78 about 100 years ago, situated between the Limekilns and Waterhall, and
A32  79 the superstitious say it is an omen that a Newmarket horse will win
A32  80 the Derby.
A32  81    |^*0If they are right, Pinturischio need not necessarily be the one
A32  82 to oblige. ^In our enthusiasm over this dark \2'un, we must not forget
A32  83 about Test Case. ^He proved he was a good horse by winning three of
A32  84 his four races last year.
A32  85    |^Furthermore Pinturischio is not the only string to Murless's
A32  86 powerful bow. ^Golden Voice, Hunter's Song, Aurelius and So Cozy are
A32  87 all very nice colts with the scope to train on into fancied Derby
A32  88 candidates. ^I suspect that Lester Piggott has a particularly soft
A32  89 spot for Aurelius, as he has ridden the horse on each of the last
A32  90 three galloping mornings, and each time has had a good ride.
A32  91 *<*4Great Promise*>
A32  92    |^*0The only time that Aurelius ran last year, he showed great
A32  93 promise by running on well to take fourth place behind Beta, Dual and
A32  94 Orbit in the Royal Lodge Stakes at the Ascot Heath meeting transferred
A32  95 to Newbury.
A32  96    |^As he has done so well in his recent work he is more than likely
A32  97 to make a successful reappearance in the Craven Stakes, run over a
A32  98 mile here next Tuesday.
A32  99    |^*4Alternatively Murless's interests could be represented by
A32 100 either Magnificat or So Cozy in that event, but as it is Aurelius's
A32 101 only engagement of the week it seems likely that he will run.
A32 102    |^*0Both Jack Langley's Prince Tudor and John Oxley's Eagle are
A32 103 expected to wait for the Free Handicap on Wednesday, when Prince Tudor
A32 104 will be ridden by his Guineas jockey Bill Rickaby.
A32 105    |^Thus the most dangerous rivals to Aurelius could be Jack Jarvis's
A32 106 Pinzon, and Dick Hern's Penhill.
A32 107    |^Pinzon shone in a gallop over seven furlongs with Test Case last
A32 108 week and Penhill must be respected by reason of his having finished
A32 109 fast to run Morgan to half a length in the Coventry Stakes, at Kempton
A32 110 Park on Monday.
A32 111    |^Besides the Wood Ditton Stakes and the Craven Stakes, the Free
A32 112 Handicap could also be an informative classic trial. ^Among those
A32 113 holding the engagement in whom I am interested are Eagle, Prince
A32 114 Tudor, Smuggler's Joy, and Pardao.
A32 115 *<*4Obvious Choice*>
A32 116    |^*0As Eagle won his gallop from the older Zanzibar last Saturday,
A32 117 he would appear the obvious choice in this race, but neither
A32 118 Smuggler's Joy or Pardao will be easy to beat.
A32 119    |^Smuggler's Joy, like Pinzon, has been putting in some good work
A32 120 upsides Test Case, while Pardao shaped well in the work with Sagacity
A32 121 and Good Old Days referred to above. ^Since then Pardao has received
A32 122 an indirect compliment by Good Old Days having run Dual to a neck in
A32 123 the 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes at Kempton Park.
A32 124    |^*4Plenty of rain has fallen here lately, so the going should be
A32 125 perfect next week. ^By the end of it we should be in a far better
A32 126 position to anticipate the outcome of both the 2,000 Guineas and the
A32 127 Derby.
A32 128 *<Today's Nap*>
A32 129    |^*0Without Doug Smith having to bring pressure to bear, Crown
A32 130 Imperial ran on well to finish third to the older horse Prince Chamier
A32 131 and Final Problem in a seven-furlong trial on the Limekilns the Monday
A32 132 before Easter. ^Since then the colt has been noted moving very
A32 133 smoothly in all his work.
A32 134    |^Reproduction of the trial form should enable Crown Imperial, who
A32 135 is the nap, to win the *4Bardolph Plate *0(4-0).
A32 136    |^Cingle, who is under orders for the *4Round Tower Handicap
A32 137 *0(3-30), is expected to become Jack Langley's first winner since he
A32 138 took charge of \0Mr. {0W. J.} Weston-Evans' horses at Herringswell
A32 139 Manor.
A32 140    |^The four-year-old Cingle has been moving strongly on the regular
A32 141 occasions that he has led work for the classic horse Prince Tudor.
A32 142    |^*4Jack Jarvis *0made use of the Railway Land to give some of his
A32 143 team good sharpening-up work over five and six furlongs.
A32 144    |^Test Case (\0E. Larkin) was noted working well when accompanied
A32 145 by Bold Lover over six furlongs. ^Sticky Case, Divine Comedy and Beta
A32 146 were also sent over a similar distance.
A32 147    |^Jaquetta and Saint Sybil had sharpening-up exercise.
A32 148    |^Welsh Rake and Bass Rock covered five furlongs at a sharp pace,
A32 149 and Sybil's Comb, Fringe, Kilifi and Lion's Mantle were similarly
A32 150 employed.
A32 151    |^*4\0G. Brooke also sharpened up some of his older horses over
A32 152 five furlongs, these being Felix, with Menelek and Court Imperial.
A32 153    |^*0Quota and Kathie were noted having a similar spin.
A32 154    |^{0J. F.} Watts, \0H. Thomson Janes and \0W. Hern also gave
A32 155 their teams exercise on the Railway Land.
A32 156    |^On the Racecourse side *4\0B. \van Cutsem's *0Seam (\0E. Smith)
A32 157 was accompanied by Prince Bula in a nice-pace gallop over seven
A32 158 furlongs. ^Other teams seen on these training grounds were those of
A32 159 \0G. Barling, \0H. Cottrill, Reg Day and John Waugh, where work was
A32 160 confined to cantering.
A32 161 *<*5Latest from Epsom*>
A32 162 *<*4Nightingall May Have a Double*>
A32 163    |^*6WALTER NIGHTINGALL *4and his stable jockey Duncan Keith should
A32 164 follow up yesterday's success of Release with a double at Windsor,
A32 165 which may be initiated by Duke Toledo in the Round Tower Handicap
A32 166 (3-30) and completed by King's Probity, who goes for the Hatch Bridge
A32 167 Handicap (4-30).
A32 168    |^*0Duke Toledo demonstrated that he is an early-season performer
A32 169 by winning over today's distance, an extended mile at the
A32 170 corresponding meeting last year, when he comfortably beat Indian Rock
A32 171 and Martian, a winner at Hurst Park on Wednesday.
A32 172    |^Following this victory, Walter Nightingall ran the colt at the
A32 173 Epsom Spring Meeting where he was defeated by his burden of 9\0st.
A32 174 3\0lb. and then he failed against some of the best milers in Royal
A32 175 Ascot's Queen Anne Stakes. ^He had only one other outing, at Kempton
A32 176 Park in soft going, which was probably the cause of his poor showing.
A32 177    |^If Duke Toledo reproduces his form of 12 months ago he should
A32 178 find little difficulty in accounting for today's opposition.
A32 179    |^The three-year-old, King's Probity, was a most consistent
A32 180 juvenile, never being out of the first four in six attempts. ^He lost
A32 181 his maiden allowance at Brighton in September, when he easily beat
A32 182 Dolaucothi and should be ready to do the trick here.
A32 183    |^Mambo, from Peter Ashworth's Treadwell stables, could be the one
A32 184 to give King's Probity most trouble, as he wound up a promising
A32 185 two-year-old career with a win at Yarmouth, but Nightingall's charge
A32 186 may just have the edge.
A32 187 *<*4Cost 6,500\0gns.*>
A32 188    |^*0Staff Ingham's horses, who usually register early successes,
A32 189 seem to be more backward this year, but the stable can get off the
A32 190 mark in the *4Cannon Yard Plate *0(3-0) with Red Imp, a 1,050 guineas
A32 191 Magic Red colt, who is preferred to Jackie Sirett's Baba.
A32 192    |^Another winner for Ingham may well be \0Mr. Bernard Sunley's
A32 193 Raincourt, who was one of the highest priced yearlings of 1959,
A32 194 costing 6,500 guineas.
A32 195    |^The son of Court Martial has made only one public appearance in
A32 196 which he showed considerable promise by putting in his best work
A32 197 during the closing stages behind Blue Sash at Headquarters in
A32 198 September. ^This experience should be enough to give Raincourt victory
A32 199 in the *4Bardolph Plate *0(4-0).
A32 200    |^Fridolanna, who finished fourth to Troilus at Lincoln, will find
A32 201 the one and a half miles of the *4Upper Sixpenny Handicap *0(5-0) to
A32 202 her liking and is fancied to beat Harold Wallington's Hanbury Lad.
A32 203 *<*4Prince Midge is Windsor Nap*>

A32 205 prior to the 2,000 Guineas, returns to the scene of his solitary

A33  84 of the Professional Footballers' Association, he was prepared to say
A33  85 anything about captains who gesticulate, show their displeasure and
A33  86 sometimes disgust when passes go astray, he refused.
A33  87    |^But, surely, as the man who led the fight*- and won*- for higher

A33 123 *<*5Millwall plan cuts*- and no manager*>
A33 124 *<*4By *6HAROLD PALMER*>
A33 125    |^T*0here is a new outlook at Millwall after Saturday's home defeat
A33 126 by Oldham. ^Hope of promotion is practically abandoned. ^New plans are
A33 127 being made*- and they do not include a replacement for Reg Smith, the
A33 128 manager they sacked three weeks ago.
A33 129    |^The emphasis is likely to be on coaching, with general
A33 130 administration resting in the hands of the present staff.
A33 131    |^Chairman Micky Purser tells me he is preparing the new plan,
A33 132 which he hopes to present to the board within the next two weeks.
A33 133    |^Playing staff is to be reduced from 26 to about 18, because
A33 134 whatever the Football Combination decide Millwall will not field
A33 135 reserve teams on Saturdays next season.
A33 136 *<*4No long journeys*>
A33 137    |^*0Millwall will also refuse to take part in a reserve competition
A33 138 even in mid-week if long journeys are involved.
A33 139    |^*"The competition must be regional to suit us,**" says Purser.
A33 140 ^*"Otherwise we shall hope to get Queen's Park Rangers, Charlton,
A33 141 Leyton Orient and Fulham to join us in a new reserve competition. ^We
A33 142 would only need to have a dozen clubs to make the League
A33 143 worthwhile.**"
A33 144    |^*6ARSENAL *0look like losing Scottish international Jackie
A33 145 Henderson for two or three weeks. ^He has a bad ankle injury.
A33 146    |^I should think this will mean David Herd, out with flu on
A33 147 Saturday, finding inside-left his position when he resumes.
A33 148    |^*6LEYTON ORIENT *0take advantage of having a League fixture at
A33 149 Liverpool on Saturday to put in a week's special training at
A33 150 Southport*- with the following week's Cup tie particularly in mind.
A33 151    |^They took 13 players, Saturday's team plus Terry McDonald
A33 152 (outside-left) and Malcolm Lucas (wing-half) North today.
A33 153    |^John Richards returns to the *6ALDERSHOT *0team at inside-left
A33 154 for tonight's second replay of the fourth round \0FA Cup tie with
A33 155 Stoke at Wolverhampton (7.15).
A33 156 *<*4Richards is back*>
A33 157    |^*0Richards was missing from the Aldershot team on Saturday for
A33 158 the first time since he joined them last October. ^With his return
A33 159 Parnell moves back to the wing to the exclusion of Burton.
A33 160    |^Both *6SOUTHAMPTON *0and *6BURNLEY *0will lack their star
A33 161 inside-rights for tonight's quarter-final in the Football League Cup
A33 162 at Southampton (7.0).
A33 163    |^Irish international Jimmy McIlroy, who has recently had a broken

A33 169 *<*4By BERNARD JOY*>
A33 170    |^B*0efore leaving for Liverpool for training with the England team
A33 171 tonight, Chelsea inside-forward Jimmy Greaves told me: ^*"Barcelona?
A33 172 ^My immediate future lies with Chelsea and probably my long-term
A33 173 future as well.**"
A33 174    |^He then went off to telephone Chelsea to give the assurance to
A33 175 manager Ted Drake.
A33 176    |^Greaves told me: ^*"I am concerned with two things at the moment,
A33 177 helping Chelsea to a respectable position in the table*- and that is
A33 178 the aim of every Chelsea player*- and getting my own form back.
A33 179    |^*"I have no intention of asking for a transfer. ^It is highly
A33 180 probable that I shall be staying with Chelsea for a good while or even
A33 181 indefinitely.**"
A33 182    |^Having knocked Real Madrid out of the European Cup, Barcelona are
A33 183 determined to hold on to the prize of supremacy in Spain, and even
A33 184 Europe.
A33 185 *<*5Nothing hasty*>
A33 186    |^*0Free-scoring Greaves*- who will be 21 in a fortnight's time*-
A33 187 would fit into their attack and naturalisation is an easy matter for
A33 188 imported foreign stars*- like Di Stefano, Kubala and Martinez.
A33 189    |^Italian clubs have also made approaches for Greaves, although
A33 190 they are barred from obtaining new players from abroad until after the
A33 191 1962 World Cup.
A33 192    |^Greaves comments: ^*"I was told at Stamford Bridge on Saturday
A33 193 that a Barcelona representative was at the match. ^I would be
A33 194 interested, of course, but I wouldn't be so hasty as a couple of
A33 195 months ago before the new set-up was introduced into English
A33 196 football.**"
A33 197    |^Greaves was restless two months ago and the rumour was current
A33 198 that he wanted to leave Chelsea.
A33 199    |^When I asked if his changed attitude meant that he was now happy,
A33 200 he replied quickly: ^*"I'm not happy. ^I'm having a bad time and the
A33 201 club are having a bad time. ^You can't be happy under those
A33 202 conditions.
A33 203    |^*"But I have shelved all ideas of making a move from Chelsea.**"
A33 204 *<*5Three on short list*>
A33 205    |^*0The short list of three for the post of coach is Vic
A33 206 Buckingham, the former West Bromwich manager and coach of Ajax, the
A33 207 Dutch champions, Bobby Campbell, coach of Reading, and Tom Docherty,
A33 208 the Arsenal and Scotland wing-half. ^Roy Bentley, the Fulham and
A33 209 former Chelsea player, is not in the list because Chelsea are looking
A33 210 for a man with \0FA coaching qualifications.
A33 211    |^Buckingham, 45, steered West Bromwich in nearly carrying off the
A33 212 Cup and League double in 1953-4. ^A former Spurs defender, he left
A33 213 West Bromwich two seasons ago.
A33 214    |^A big point in his favour is that he struck up a personal
A33 215 friendship with Ted Drake when they were stationed together in the
A33 216 {0RAF}.
A33 217    |^Campbell, a Scottish international winger, played for Chelsea for
A33 218 six seasons before going to Reading in 1954.

A34   2 *<*5Excavation Work Identifies Shrine Chapel*>
A34   3 *<*6WALSINGHAM EVIDENCE*>
A34   4    |^EXCAVATION *4of the small building on the north side of the
A34   5 ruined Priory church at Walsingham has shown this to be the remains of
A34   6 the Chapel of the Shrine of Our Lady, visited and described by William
A34   7 of Worcester in 1479.
A34   8    |^*0The shrine, a small wooden building, was founded, according to
A34   9 tradition, in {0A.D.} 1061*- though historians have in general
A34  10 placed it a little later*- and a generation later the Priory was
A34  11 established to guard the shrine.
A34  12    |^At a later date, the stone chapel was built to cover and protect
A34  13 the original shrine and this building, the *"{Novum Opus}**" of
A34  14 William, is first recorded in his description. ^It was also seen by
A34  15 Erasmus in 1511.
A34  16    |^For more than a century, since the first test excavation by Canon
A34  17 James Lee Warner, there has been some controversy, both on the nature
A34  18 of his findings and on the date of the various buildings. ^These new
A34  19 excavations, directed by the archaeological consultant to the Ministry
A34  20 of Works, \0Mr. Charles Green, on behalf of the Walsingham Excavation
A34  21 Committee, were designed to resolve these difficulties.
A34  22 *<*4Remodelled*>
A34  23    |^*0The existing remains of the Priory church have long made it
A34  24 clear that extensive building took place in the 14th century, when the
A34  25 original Norman church was replaced by a great aisled church with a
A34  26 central tower. ^This was again modified early in the 15th century when
A34  27 the east window was remodelled in the Perpendicular style.
A34  28    |^Embedded in the north wall of this church were found remains of
A34  29 the original Norman church and some direct evidence of the central
A34  30 tower which before had been known only from the medieval description.
A34  31    |^The excavations also showed that, shortly after the church itself
A34  32 was rebuilt, the Chapel of the Shrine was erected. ^Further
A34  33 confirmation of its purpose was seen in its layout. ^It lay at an
A34  34 angle to the church, showing that its contents were of more importance
A34  35 even than the church. ^Its massive walls, too, gave evidence of its
A34  36 precious contents.
A34  37 *<*4Post-Holes*>
A34  38    |^*0Of the original wooden shrine there was little direct evidence.
A34  39 ^After the building of the chapel, it is known to have stood above the
A34  40 chapel floor. ^As this floor had been almost completely destroyed, no
A34  41 remains of the shrine could be detected.
A34  42    |^Furthermore, the levelling of the sloping site by the chapel
A34  43 builders had destroyed much of the original surface. ^But indications
A34  44 of a few post-holes and supports which belonged to a period before the
A34  45 chapel, in use until the chapel was built, gave evidence of a
A34  46 contained wooden building, though their remnants were not sufficient
A34  47 to determine its exact size and plan.
A34  48    |^This levelling had another, unexpected, result. ^It had brought
A34  49 close to the surface an Anglo-Saxon cemetery of much earlier date and
A34  50 these graves were seen to have been cut through and destroyed by the
A34  51 chapel builders.
A34  52 *<*5Pagan Site?*>
A34  53    |^*0With them occurred a series of post-holes of similar date,
A34  54 forming a pattern not closely related to the later buildings. ^The
A34  55 date and nature of these suggest the possibility of an early pagan
A34  56 Saxon shrine on this site. ^It is well known that early Christian
A34  57 priests often built their new churches on pagan sites, thus hallowing
A34  58 the temple sites of the heathen deities.
A34  59    |^A strong *"treasure house**" or sacristy had later been added to
A34  60 the east end of the chapel. ^A great porch at the west end, of still
A34  61 later date, was probably being built in 1511 when Erasmus described
A34  62 the chapel as *"unfinished.**"
A34  63    |^In the centre of the chapel was a great stone-built tomb,
A34  64 probably that of Sir Bartholomew Burghersh, who died in 1369, and a
A34  65 smaller stone coffin was perhaps of the last canon in charge before
A34  66 the Dissolution in 1539.
A34  67 *<*4Second Pilot Vessel Launched at Lowestoft*>
A34  68    |^*6THE *2PILOT VESSEL *0Preceder, second of two sister ships which
A34  69 Brooke Marine are building for Trinity House, was launched at
A34  70 Lowestoft yesterday by \0Mrs. Galpin, wife of \0Capt. {0R. J.}
A34  71 Galpin, an Elder Brother of the Corporation.
A34  72    |^Among the launching party were Field-Marshal Sir Claude
A34  73 Auchinleck, chairman of Dowsett Holdings, the parent company of Brooke
A34  74 Marine, \0Mr. {0H. L.} Dowsett, chairman of Brooke Marine, and
A34  75 \0Capt. \0D. Mansfield, superintendent pilot at Harwich.
A34  76    |^Before being launched the ship was blessed by the Rector of
A34  77 Lowestoft (the \0Rev. {0W. J.} Westwood).
A34  78    |^The Preceder, sister ship to Patrol, which was launched in June,
A34  79 is 39 feet long with a beam of 24 feet and a draught of ten feet five
A34  80 inches. ^She is powered by two six-cylinder Lister engines which
A34  81 develop 495 {0b.h.p.} driving a single screw, and she has a designed
A34  82 speed of just under 13 knots.
A34  83    |^She will be equipped with radar and echo sounder, a combined
A34  84 {0*2A.M.S.M.}/ {0VHF} *0set, and medium frequency radio telephone.
A34  85 ^Accommodation will be provided for a crew of 20 with Pullman-type
A34  86 bunks for 12 pilots, and she will carry two boarding boats and
A34  87 inflatable life rafts.
A34  88    |^When completed in December she will take up duties as a tender
A34  89 between Harwich and the pilot cutter on station at the Sunk, where she
A34  90 will speed up the service considerably, as she is to replace a
A34  91 nine-knot ship.
A34  92 *<*4Nine Per \0Cent. Drop in Farm Incomes*>
A34  93    |^*4F*2ARM INCOMES *0in England and Wales in 1959 fell by nearly
A34  94 nine per \0cent. on the previous year, according to a booklet
A34  95 published yesterday by the National Farmers' Union.
A34  96    |^Figures given in the booklet, based on the union's farm accounts
A34  97 scheme, show that except for cereal growers, the long dry summer of
A34  98 1959 was not generally favourable to farmers. ^In particular, the
A34  99 shortage of grazing caused by drought necessitated heavy purchases of
A34 100 feeding stuffs.
A34 101    |^Record cereal crops largely account for an increase of nearly
A34 102 nine per \0cent. in the earnings of the specialist arable farms, which
A34 103 the previous year fell by about 10 per \0cent.
A34 104 *<*4Dairy Farms*>
A34 105    |^*0According to the booklet, the livestock sector fared worse than
A34 106 any other in 1959, as it had in 1958.
A34 107    |^A fall of 17 per \0cent. that year was followed by a reduction of
A34 108 18 per \0cent. in 1959. ^On mixed livestock farms, incomes fell by
A34 109 over 11 per \0cent.
A34 110    |^On dairy farms and mixed dairy farms, profits fell by more than
A34 111 10 per \0cent. ^A slight increase in revenue was *"substantially
A34 112 outweighed**" by heavy increases in feeding stuff expenditure.
A34 113    |^The booklet also says that the substantial increase in egg output
A34 114 in 1959 led to a reduction in price, and as a result of a decline in
A34 115 income, and an increase in expenditure, the profits of specialist egg
A34 116 producers fell by over 58 per \0cent. ^Profits on mixed farms where
A34 117 egg production was the largest single enterprise fell by over seven
A34 118 per \0cent.
A34 119    |^The results, says the booklet, are based on sample accounts of
A34 120 3709 farms whose year-ending date fell between June 1st, 1959, and May
A34 121 31st, 1960.

A34 125 at Fakenham Court yesterday on a charge of breaking and entering a
A34 126 lock-up coffee bar in Bridge Street, Fakenham, between August 10th and
A34 127 11th and stealing a quantity of sweets, chocolates, and money, to a
A34 128 total value of *+4 18\0s. 8 1/2\0d.
A34 129    |^\0Mr. Brian John Bedford, a service engineer, of 28, Grange Road,
A34 130 Bushey, Hertfordshire, said he was acting manager of the coffee bar.
A34 131    |^When he went to it one morning, the first thing he noticed was
A34 132 that the shelf on which chocolates and sweets were placed, was bare.
A34 133 ^He found that the rear door of the premises had been forced.
A34 134 *<*4Green Fibres*>
A34 135    |^*0{0P.C.} {0A. D.} Willsher said that he examined the coffee
A34 136 bar and found several green fibres in a door post and also on two
A34 137 crates of soft drinks. ^Later Maloney produced the clothing he had
A34 138 been wearing the previous day and this included a green wool sweater.
A34 139    |^Maloney was cautioned and he said, ^*"If you come round to my
A34 140 house at 4.30 I will give you the stuff.**" ^He later produced the
A34 141 sweets and chocolates in a cardboard box from his car and then went
A34 142 into the house and gave them two piggy banks which contained 18\0s. 7
A34 143 1/2\0d. in cash saying, ^*"That is the money I took.**"
A34 144    |^In a statement to {0P.C.} Willsher, Maloney said, ^*"I had a
A34 145 row with my wife. ^I lost my head and went on the booze. ^I would not
A34 146 have done it if I had not had so much to drink.**" ^He was sorry for
A34 147 the inconvenience he had caused the coffee bar manager.
A34 148    |^In court Maloney said he would like to confirm what he had said
A34 149 in his statement and would like to add that he was thoroughly ashamed
A34 150 of the whole business.

A35   2 *<*6COURT QUIZ ON IDENTITY METHODS*>
A35   3    |^*0Police methods of holding identity parades were questioned in a
A35   4 Darlington court today by \0Mr. Colin Black, defending solicitor for
A35   5 28-year-old unemployed labourer, James Rudd Fenwick of Estoril Road,
A35   6 Darlington.
A35   7    |^*4\0Det.-Con. Henry Hammond gave evidence that he and \0Mr. James
A35   8 Hughes, another witness in the case, had been standing in Northgate on
A35   9 Sunday, October 8. ^\0Mr. Hughes had recognised a man who had asked
A35  10 {0D.C.} Hammond for a light.
A35  11 *<Cross-examination*>
A35  12    |^*0Cross-examining, \0Mr. Black asked: ^*"Did you suggest to \0Mr.
A35  13 Hughes that this could be the man?**"*- ^*"No.**"
A35  14    |^*"Why were you in Northgate?**"*- ^*"We were there with a view to
A35  15 identifying the defendant. ^I had asked \0Mr. Hughes to come along.**"
A35  16    |^*"Ah, is this the way to carry out an identity parade?**" ^\0Mr.
A35  17 Stanley Walton, prosecuting, stood up. ^*"I object. ^It was not an
A35  18 identity parade.**"
A35  19 *<*4Question reframed*>
A35  20    |^\0*0Mr. Black: ^*"I'll reframe the question. ^You have been
A35  21 trained in methods of identity parade. ^Is this the correct way?**"*-
A35  22 ^*"There is no strict way.**"
A35  23    |^*"You refuse to give a straight answer?**"*- ^*"No, sir. ^I
A35  24 answered your question.**"
A35  25    |^\0Mr. Walton rose again: ^*"He has said there is no strict
A35  26 way.**"
A35  27    |^\0Mr. Black: ^*"Let me reframe again. ^Is there any recommended
A35  28 method?**"*- ^*"Yes, when applicable.**"
A35  29    |^*"This wasn't such a case?**"*- ^*"No.**"
A35  30    |^*"Why were you particularly in Northgate?**"*- ^*"I knew the
A35  31 defendant was coming along. ^Some member of the force had asked him to
A35  32 come to the police station.**"
A35  33    |^*"Had Hughes been shown photographs of the defendant?**"*-
A35  34 ^*"Yes.**"
A35  35    |^*"And other men?**"*- ^*"Yes.**"
A35  36 *<*4Sent for trial*>
A35  37    |^*0Fenwick was sent for trial to the next Durham Quarter Sessions
A35  38 on charges of taking a car without the owner's consent, stealing a car
A35  39 radio and driving while disqualified. ^Bail was allowed and a defence
A35  40 certificate granted. ^Through \0Mr. Black, Fenwick denied all three
A35  41 charges and reserved his defence.
A35  42    |^When he elected to go for trial on a third count, a fourth case
A35  43 of driving while uninsured was adjourned {6sine die}.
A35  44    |^When Fenwick arrived at the court*- 20 minutes late*- \0Mr. Black
A35  45 apologised for him. ^*"He has two children and his wife is expecting
A35  46 another,**" he said. ^*"He has had to arrange for his mother-in-law to
A35  47 come in before he could come out.**" ^Fenwick was on his way to court
A35  48 when police were sent to look for him.
A35  49 *<*4Parked car*>
A35  50    |^*0Darlington company director \0Mr. Brian Neasham said he had
A35  51 parked the company's car on waste ground next to their Bowes Street
A35  52 premises. ^This was on October 4. ^When he returned an hour later the
A35  53 car was gone. ^It was returned to him by Middlesbrough police the next
A35  54 day. ^*"It wasn't damaged in any way, but the radio was missing.**"
A35  55    |^Outlining the case, \0Mr. Walton said: ^*"In fairness to the
A35  56 defendant he wasn't with the car when it was found abandoned.**"
A35  57    |^\0Mr. Hughes, a garagehand at Neasham's said he was sweeping the
A35  58 yard when a man he recognised as the defendant came to the gate. ^He
A35  59 said he was wanting a van or something, and \0Mr. Hughes said he would
A35  60 have to see \0Mr. Burley, the commercial manager. ^The defendant said
A35  61 he was waiting for his brother, waited some time and then went. ^Later
A35  62 he returned.
A35  63    |^When he returned, said \0Mr. Hughes, *"I pointed \0Mr. Burley out
A35  64 to him.**" ^Later \0Mr. Hughes saw that the car had gone.
A35  65    |^Cross examined by \0Mr. Black, \0Mr. Hughes agreed that he had
A35  66 never seen the man before, and had only seen him once since. ^He was
A35  67 certain that the defendant was the same man. ^*"He was wearing a light
A35  68 fawn coloured mac and a greyish flat cap,**" said \0Mr. Hughes. ^But
A35  69 he agreed: ^*"I wasn't taking much notice of the man. ^I wasn't
A35  70 suspicious or anything.**" ^When he saw Fenwick on the Sunday he was
A35  71 wearing *"a suit of a khaki drill colour.**"
A35  72 *<*4Heard car*>
A35  73    |^*0\0Mr. Kenneth Burley could not give a positive identification
A35  74 of anyone in court. ^But he had seen a man at the gate.
A35  75    |^Said \0Mr. Burley: ^*"He was supposed to be waiting for his
A35  76 brother and interested in a van.**"
A35  77    |^Objected \0Mr. Black: ^*"Surely that's hearsay?**"
A35  78    |^Retorted \0Mr. Walton: ^*"If you don't want it, we'll miss it
A35  79 out.**"
A35  80    |^\0Mr. Burley said he heard the engine of \0Mr. Neasham's car
A35  81 start up and stall twice. ^He realised that it was not one of their
A35  82 drivers or \0Mr. Neasham in the car, and ran towards it. ^It moved off
A35  83 across the waste ground towards Brunswick Street.
A35  84    |^*"I ran after the car as it turned into Brunswick Street. ^The
A35  85 driver looked back and I could see it was the same man who had stood
A35  86 at the gate. ^He was wearing a light coloured raincoat and a cloth
A35  87 cap.**"
A35  88 *<*4At Middlesbrough*>
A35  89    |^*0Middlesbrough welder \0Mr. Alan Breckon, of Snowdon Street told
A35  90 the court he was in Middlesbrough on the corner of Sussex Street and
A35  91 Richmond Street on the night of October 4. ^A man came out of a cafe
A35  92 and asked him the way to Darlington, and then to Stockton. ^He
A35  93 recognised the man as the defendant.
A35  94    |^The man got into a car about 15 yards away and drove off. ^It was
A35  95 a green Ford Consul, he said. ^Cross examined he said: ^*"It was an
A35  96 ordinary green Ford Consul with a hard top*- like an ordinary saloon.
A35  97 ^It was definitely not a convertible.**"
A35  98    |^He was sure it was a Consul and not a Zephyr. ^The man was
A35  99 wearing *"a greyish coloured jacket, no raincoat.**" ^There was a
A35 100 street lamp on the other side of the road about 24 feet away.
A35 101 *<*4On duty*>
A35 102    |^*0Re-examined by \0Mr. Walton he said he could not tell the
A35 103 difference between a Consul and a Zephyr and this car *"was going away
A35 104 fast.**"
A35 105    |^Middlesbrough policeman Colin Redman said he was on duty in
A35 106 Gosford Street walking towards Sussex Street when he saw a green Ford
A35 107 Zephyr parked outside a cafe. ^*"Before I came on duty I had received
A35 108 information that made me interested in this car.**"
A35 109    |^When it drove towards him with headlights full on, he put up his
A35 110 hand and flashed his torch. ^The driver ignored the signal and he had
A35 111 to jump out of the way. ^He recognised the defendant as the driver.
A35 112 ^He was wearing *"a corduroy flat cap, sports jacket and dark
A35 113 trousers.**"
A35 114    |^Cross examined he said he was about 20 yards from the man when he
A35 115 got into the car. ^It was definitely a convertible. ^The street
A35 116 lighting was sulphur lights on standards about 30 feet high.
A35 117 *<*4At Northgate*>
A35 118    |^*0He agreed with \0Mr. Black that sulphur lighting sometimes cast
A35 119 a peculiar colour on people's faces, but *"the cafe strip lighting was
A35 120 also on and the car was outside.**" ^The nearest light was *"about six
A35 121 feet in front of the car.**" ^Was he sure of that, asked \0Mr. Black.
A35 122 ^*"I'm fairly sure of my answer.**"
A35 123    |^*"So the last witness must be wrong if he says 24 feet?**" went
A35 124 on \0Mr. Black.*- ^*"Yes.**"
A35 125    |^{0D. C.} Hammond said the defendant had asked him for a light
A35 126 in Northgate on the Sunday. ^He had been with \0Mr. Hughes in
A35 127 Northgate. ^The defendant had been wearing *"a green checked suit.**"
A35 128 *<*4Reserved defence*>
A35 129    |^*0When charged at the police office with taking without consent,
A35 130 Fenwick said: ^*"I've never been anywhere near the place (Neasham)**".
A35 131 ^He said he was in Middlesbrough on the Wednesday and came back by
A35 132 taxi about midnight. ^*"I had a girl to meet, but I went on the bus
A35 133 about six o'clock. ^I didn't take any car.**"
A35 134    |^Charged with the other offences later he made no reply.
A35 135    |^Durham policeman John Middlemiss said Fenwick had been convicted
A35 136 of taking without consent, driving while disqualified, using an
A35 137 uninsured vehicle, and using obscene language at a Durham court in
A35 138 1956. ^He had then been banned from driving for ten years.
A35 139    |^When the charges were read to him in court, through \0Mr. Black,
A35 140 Fenwick said: ^*"I plead *'Not Guilty**' and reserve my defence.**"
A35 141 *<*6LADY CHAYTOR FINED *+50 AND BANNED*>
A35 142    |^*0Lady Patricia Chaytor*- well-known as a horse lover*- was fined
A35 143 *+50 and banned from driving for six months at Bishop Auckland today
A35 144 following a collision involving two National Hunt jockeys.
A35 145    |^The wife of Sir William Chaytor, she lives in the 50-roomed
A35 146 Witton Castle in the picturesque village of Witton-le-Wear.
A35 147 *<*6DENIED CHARGE*>
A35 148    |^*0On the advice of her solicitor Lady Chaytor, who denied a
A35 149 charge of dangerous driving, did not go into the witness box.
A35 150    |^Jerry Scott (last year's winner of the Grand National) and his
A35 151 jockey friend Pat McCarron, gave evidence for the prosecution.
A35 152    |^*"These two men almost ended up in the West Auckland Cemetery*-
A35 153 in more senses than one,**" said \0Mr. \0H. Hewitt, prosecuting.
A35 154    |^While driving towards Darlington through West Auckland they saw
A35 155 another car approaching*- on their side of the road.
A35 156 *<*6QUICK THINKING*>
A35 157    |^*0*"Only the quick thinking of Pat saved a head-on collision,**"
A35 158 Scott told the court. ^He said that as the other car drew near
A35 159 McCarron swung their car sharply to the other side of the road. ^*"But
A35 160 there was still a slight collision and the other car drove on. ^I
A35 161 could not repeat what I said then!**"
A35 162    |^The two jockeys in Scott's car turned around using the open gates
A35 163 of the cemetery and chased after the other car. ^They finally caught
A35 164 up with it at West Auckland.
A35 165    |^*"I kept my eye on it from the moment it smashed into us,**"
A35 166 Scott said.
A35 167    |^*"When I got out of my car*- if you will excuse the expression*-
A35 168 I said to the woman driver, ^*'What the hell are you doing?**' ^But
A35 169 she did not reply.**"
A35 170 *<*6SLIGHT DAMAGE*>
A35 171    |^*0{0PC} John Peacock said that when he arrived he found some
A35 172 slight damage on the nearside of Lady Chaytor's car. ^She refused to
A35 173 make a statement, he said, and told him: ^*"I have never had an
A35 174 accident before, and I was never on the wrong side of the road.**"
A35 175 ^When told about proceedings being taken she was alleged to have said,
A35 176 ^*"You can do what you like.**"
A35 177    |^For Lady Chaytor, \0Mr. \0N. Foster, of Darlington, said that she
A35 178 did not think that bringing his client into the witness-box would be
A35 179 of any assistance *"Because she cannot recollect this incident.**"
A35 180    |^He said she had been driving for 25 years and had no previous
A35 181 convictions.
A35 182 *<*6RECEIVED DRUGS*>
A35 183    |^*0*"She stoutly denies this charge and she has not the slightest
A35 184 recollection of this accident.**"
A35 185    |^Two days before this, he said, Lady Chaytor had been in hospital
A35 186 for observation and during that time had received drugs, some of which
A35 187 contained an element of pheno-barbitone.
A35 188    |^*"The only conclusion she can come to regarding this accident is
A35 189 that when it happened she was suffering from drowsiness as a result of
A35 190 the drugs which had been given to her.**"
A35 191 *<*6YOUTHS STOLE PETROL FROM PARKED CAR*>

A35 193 trouble landed him in a court before the first hire-purchase payment
A35 194 was due.
A35 195    |^Speaking on behalf of her son before a Darlington court today a
A35 196 working mother said that *"his heart had been so set on a
A35 197 motor-bike**" that she had paid a *+50 deposit so that he could have
A35 198 one for his birthday.
A35 199    |^She added that she had not yet begun to pay the balance at the
A35 200 rate of *+2 10\0s a week.
A35 201 *<*6SAID HE WOULD HELP*>
A35 202    |^*0Asked by the chairman of the Bench, \0Mr. \0J. Hemingway, how
A35 203 much her son paid for his keep out of the *+3 18\0s he had just begun
A35 204 to earn, she replied: ^*"I let him keep it for himself; he has had to
A35 205 pay for tax and insurance but said he would help out with the
A35 206 payments.**"
A35 207    |^The youth appeared with another motor-cyclist, Henry Ernest
A35 208 Chapman (19), of Railway Cottages, Hurworth Place, on a joint charge
A35 209 of stealing petrol. ^They pleaded guilty.

A35 211 policemen found Chapman and the youth hiding in a yard off
A35 212 Skinner-gate on the evening of October 30.
A35 213    |^Asked what they were doing they said they were looking for a

A36   4 loss, said Racecourse Committee chairman Alderman Guy Nelson at the
A36   5 July meeting of Warwick Town Council. ^Because of that, the committee
A36   6 had refused to increase prize money when asked to do so by the Jockey
A36   7 Club.
A36   8    |^Alderman Nelson was replying to two questions from members of the
A36   9 council, who asked why the committee had not carried out the Jockey
A36  10 Club's request. ^Councillor Fred Vittle said he thought that owners
A36  11 and trainers would stop running their horses at Warwick if the prize
A36  12 money was not increased.
A36  13 *<*6POSTPONED*>
A36  14    |^*0Councillor Fred Walters asked why the committee had refused the
A36  15 increase before it found out about other racecourses. ^*"Is our prize
A36  16 money as high as theirs?**" he asked.
A36  17    |^Alderman Nelson said the committee had only said that the
A36  18 increase should be postponed until a decision on betting levy
A36  19 contributions to racecourse executives had been received.
A36  20    |^*"We shall still get plenty of horses. ^The horses that come to
A36  21 Warwick do not come for the prize money, but for the public to bet
A36  22 on,**" he added.

A36  29    |^The new bedrooms, each of which will have its own private bath or
A36  30 shower, are all on the first floor, over the new conference hall,
A36  31 which has its own entrance, bar, cloakrooms, and a laid dance-floor.
A36  32 ^The new hall, to be called the Lilac Room, can be used either
A36  33 separately or in conjunction with the main hall, and is a very
A36  34 valuable extension of the already comprehensive conference facilities.

A36  36    |^*0The new structure, which links the hotel to the ballroom, has a

A36  39 and the architectural treatment of the new building is clean and

A36  61 Councillor Fred Walters at the July meeting of the council. ^And, if
A36  62 that happened, would council house rents be affected?
A36  63    |^Councillor Walters was speaking on a Finance Committee
A36  64 recommendation that the council should increase its overdraft to
A36  65 *+250,000. ^The proposal was approved.
A36  66    |^He said he had been surprised that the chairman of the committee
A36  67 had not made a statement to the council, and added that he did not
A36  68 think it necessary to have such a large overdraft for a town of
A36  69 Warwick's size.
A36  70 *<*6WAS IT WISE?*>
A36  71    |^*0Before the chairman of the Finance Committee had chance
A36  72 **[SIC**] to reply, Councillor Fred Vittle asked if it was wise to
A36  73 increase the overdraft during the national economic crisis.
A36  74    |^Councillor \0E. Lloyd-Averns Finance Committee chairman, said the
A36  75 overdraft was not a large one, as many towns smaller than Warwick had
A36  76 greater overdraft facilities.
A36  77    |^*"Its main purpose is to act as a buffer,**" he said.
A36  78    |^*"In so far as council house rents are concerned, they are run on
A36  79 a completely different basis and cannot possibly be affected.**"

A36  85 on the original site*- by Leamington's Brunswick Street cemetery.
A36  86    |^Warwick Town Council originally decided to build its own
A36  87 crematorium, but in April last year it abandoned the idea and entered
A36  88 into a joint scheme with Leamington Town Council and Warwick Rural

A36 103    |^*0Chairman of the new Planning and Development Committee,
A36 104 Councillor {0H. R. C.} Walden, said it would be piecemeal
A36 105 development for the Heathcote area. ^He said that would be one of the
A36 106 few areas that Warwick could develop if the Green Belt inquiry proved
A36 107 successful and it was wrong to spoil it by building the crematorium.
A36 108    |^Councillor Leo Howlett said the eventual cost was likely to be
A36 109 about *+125,000, of which Warwick would have to pay one fifth. ^*"If
A36 110 we have got *+25,000 to spend let's spend it on the living,**" he

A36 117    |^Councillor {0W. L.} Tarver, the chairman of the Housing

A36 126 *<*4Warwick Mayor to campaign for by-pass*>
A36 127    |^A*2LTHOUGH *0proposed more than 25 years ago, it would be at
A36 128 least four years before anything was done about the Warwick by-pass,
A36 129 said the Mayor of Warwick (Alderman James McGrouther) at a special
A36 130 meeting of Warwick General Purposes Committee. ^He told the committee
A36 131 that he was going to write to the Minister of Transport asking if he
A36 132 would receive a deputation from the council.
A36 133    |^To strengthen his case, said the Mayor, he would approach
A36 134 transport federations and commission films of local traffic
A36 135 congestion. ^He asked the Press for support and said he would take all
A36 136 press cuttings he could find relating to the traffic conditions in the
A36 137 town.
A36 138    |^Councillor Fred Walters, leader of the Socialist group, said the
A36 139 council had tried to do several small things in an effort to alleviate
A36 140 the traffic congestion. ^*"Each time they have been refused by people
A36 141 who have never been to Warwick,**" he added.
A36 142 *<*4Council's action on smokeless zones*>
A36 143 *<Alderman says: ^*"We have got to be realists**"*>
A36 144    |^I*2N A FRANK *0speech to the delegates at the annual meeting of
A36 145 the Warwickshire Clean Air Council at Leamington, Alderman {0E. H.}
A36 146 Fryer told them the reasons why Leamington Town Council had postponed
A36 147 its smokeless zones programme. ^But he promised that Leamington would
A36 148 not hang back when there were sufficient supplies of smokeless fuels
A36 149 available.
A36 150    |^Welcoming the delegates on behalf of the Mayor (Councillor Miss
A36 151 Christine Ledger), who was attending the Royal garden party at
A36 152 Buckingham Palace, Alderman Fryer said he had been against smoke
A36 153 control for Leamington right from the word go.
A36 154 *<*6MUST BE REALISTS*>
A36 155    |^*0*"Criticism was levelled at us for going back on what we had
A36 156 started to do, but we have got to be realists. ^If you are going to
A36 157 change the Englishman's way of life you cannot do it in a hurry,**" he
A36 158 said.
A36 159    |^*"It must be done very gradually indeed. ^In other words, one
A36 160 must make haste slowly.
A36 161    |^*"The zones that were revoked covered a large area in which a lot
A36 162 of old people lived. ^It was on their behalf, mainly, that the
A36 163 programme was revoked.
A36 164 **[END QUOTE**]
A36 165 *<*6TEMPERAMENTAL*>
A36 166    |^*0*"You yourselves said there were insufficient supplies of
A36 167 smokeless fuel and so coke must be used. ^Coke is temperamental; it
A36 168 can make a good fire, or it can be a most depressing sight.
A36 169    |^*"Unless we can give people a similar fuel to coal, at a similar
A36 170 price, then we are up against the wall. ^These are the reasons why the
A36 171 smoke control zones in Leamington were rejected.
A36 172    |^*"When smokeless fuel is produced in abundance, and when it is a
A36 173 reasonable price, I can assure you that Leamington Spa will not hang
A36 174 back,**" added Alderman Fryer.
A36 175 *<*6DOCTOR'S LETTER*>
A36 176    |^*0At the quarterly meeting of the council, held at Sutton
A36 177 Coldfield, the vice-chairman of the council, Councillor Robert
A36 178 Loosley, of Coventry, claimed that Councillor \0Dr. \0H. Gibbons Ward,
A36 179 of Leamington, had started the campaign against the smoke control
A36 180 zones in Leamington by writing to the local Press. ^He asked the
A36 181 council to deplore the doctor's action.
A36 182    |^At the annual meeting, \0Dr. Gibbons Ward said unfortunately he
A36 183 had not been at the Sutton Coldfield meeting and he wished to *"put
A36 184 two or three things right.**"
A36 185 *<*6*"MY PRIVILEGE**"*>
A36 186    |^*0*"I did not start the campaign by writing to the local Press.
A36 187 ^I do not think it is the wish of this council that any member shall
A36 188 not at any time disagree with decisions of the council.
A36 189    |^*"I should have thought that one would have been able to express
A36 190 an opinion without being rebuked. ^It is my privilege to differ from
A36 191 the council at any time,**" he added.
A36 192    |^Later, Councillor Loosley said: ^*"I feel it is wrong for the
A36 193 people of this council to get up at another meeting and decry our
A36 194 efforts. ^It is the duty of a member of this council to support these
A36 195 decisions outside the council. ^If not, at least they can keep

A36 213    |^*"Land behind the garages of Mill Road and Pattens Road was
A36 214 originally allocated for allotments, but as the land has not yet been
A36 215 allocated to the Allotments Committee could it be used for a

A36 217 it would help some,**" she said.
A36 218    |^Councillor {0W. L.} Tarver, Housing Committee chairman, said
A36 219 the borough surveyor was looking into the playgrounds problem. ^If any

A37 101    |^*"W*2E *0are trying to bring about equal rights for all civilised

A37 103 the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, when he spoke to members
A37 104 of the \0St Chad's Church of England Men's Society on Monday.
A37 105    |^\0Mr Thornley asked, ^*"What is the colour bar?**"
A37 106    |^He said that there were many forms. ^The first was a local colour
A37 107 bar, such as was found in the Union of South Africa and which was
A37 108 known as apartheid.
A37 109    |^\0Mr Thornley said that apartheid was revolting, and although the
A37 110 basis of it was theology it was rank bad theology.
A37 111    |^Another type of colour bar was the economic form which existed in
A37 112 the Federation and which also formed the basis for the colour bar in
A37 113 the United States.
A37 114    |^The third form was the social colour bar which, said \0Mr
A37 115 Thornley, was pretty well universal.
A37 116    |^*"Our mission is striving to create a multi-racial community
A37 117 where all may enjoy fundamental rights and responsibilities, and where
A37 118 a man's status and opportunities depend not on the colour of his skin
A37 119 but on his character and competence,**" he added.

A37 123 *<*6A PEN *4picture of Bispham artist Miss Kate Smith by *6MAUREEN
A37 124 *4Mc*6CONVILLE*>
A37 125    |^FROM *4the outside, and on first glance, the garage at 19,
A37 126 Stainforth-avenue, Bispham, looks like any other garage.
A37 127    |^*0But there the resemblance abruptly and completely ends.
A37 128    |^Inside, in an atmosphere pungent with linseed oil and turpentine,
A37 129 it is furnished for use with fluorescent lighting supplementing the
A37 130 daylight from the large windows, and for comfort with thick matting on
A37 131 the floor, curtains and chairs.
A37 132    |^Inside, the ordered chaos of artistic activity prevails.
A37 133 *<*5Centrepiece*>
A37 134    |^*0Even to the uninitiated, this building, masquerading as an
A37 135 ordinary suburban garage, is a working artist's studio.
A37 136    |^*1The working artist to whom it belongs is Kate Smith, three of
A37 137 whose pictures have been hung as the centrepiece of the Lancashire Art
A37 138 Exhibition, which opened at the Harris Gallery, Preston, on Wednesday.
A37 139    |^*0Miss Smith came to Blackpool from the Midlands in April last
A37 140 year and this is the first time she has exhibited in Lancashire.
A37 141    |^It is not, by a long way, her first experience of exhibiting, for
A37 142 Miss Smith has been painting most of her life, striving to express in
A37 143 oils on hardboard the ideas that come too fast for her to cope with.
A37 144 *<*5*"Imaginative**"*>
A37 145    |^*0She has little of the exhibitionism that people associate with
A37 146 artists. ^Instead of producing a facile flow of ideas about artistic
A37 147 theory and personal aims, she gropes for words to express her sense of
A37 148 the seriousness of painting.
A37 149    |^She knows what she believes and feels about art, but she handles
A37 150 language with something less than the complete assurance with which
A37 151 she handles paint.
A37 152    |^*1Considering whether she qualified as a *"modern**" artist or
A37 153 not, she told me: ^*"I'm just an imaginative painter, really.**"
A37 154    |^*0This modest personal appraisal needs elaboration.
A37 155 *<*5Bible-inspired*>
A37 156    |^*0Many of Miss Smith's paintings are inspired by incidents in the
A37 157 New Testament and express divine and human qualities in the life of
A37 158 God-made Man.
A37 159    |^The expression is achieved by a heavy reliance on symbolism,
A37 160 which simplifies, concentrates and distorts reality to make the
A37 161 symbolism clear and powerful.
A37 162    |^The result is far from traditional, though it has nothing of the
A37 163 shock value of, say, action painters and other anti-humanists.
A37 164 *<*5Striking*>
A37 165    |^*0In fact, the human feeling in her paintings is one of their
A37 166 most striking aspects and one which has gained her adherents in
A37 167 unexpected quarters.
A37 168    |^*1Coming to Blackpool has influenced her choice of subject to
A37 169 some extent, though now, she told me, she was returning to
A37 170 *"religious**" work.
A37 171    |^*0In her studio, I saw several pictures directly inspired by the
A37 172 local scene. ^One was a composite of Blackpool's pleasures, another a
A37 173 colourful sketch of the Illuminations.
A37 174 *<*5Rhythmic*>
A37 175    |^*0One I particularly liked was a study of three girls preparing
A37 176 to swim. ^The rhythmic flow of their bodies made an interesting and
A37 177 satisfying composition.
A37 178    |^Horses from the Tower Circus were featured on a small painting
A37 179 full of vigour and delight in movement.
A37 180    |^Miss Smith has taught painting*- in sanatoriums, which inspired
A37 181 one of the paintings now exhibited in Preston, and in mental
A37 182 hospitals*- but it has always been her aim to be a full-time painter.
A37 183    |^Now she has achieved it. ^She paints all through the day every
A37 184 day, starting at 8 {0a m}, taking time off for lunch, and working
A37 185 until 6 {0p m}.
A37 186 *<*5Month to paint*>
A37 187    |^*0A full-sized picture takes about a month to complete and
A37 188 afterwards, she relaxes for a few days before starting another.
A37 189    |^*1Soon she will be employing one of her relaxation periods for
A37 190 another sort of painting. ^She is going to decorate her sittingroom.
A37 191    |^*0*"It will be my first attempt,**" she told me.
A37 192 *<*6RED LIGHT PLAIN TO ALL*>
A37 193 *<BY *'ZEPHYRUS**'*>
A37 194    |^AT *0last people are genuinely worried. ^One resignation, two
A37 195 resignations, even three resignations from the Blackpool Town Council
A37 196 they were prepared to accept as more or less normal wastage.
A37 197    |^But when, last week, the total rose to six with the impending
A37 198 departure of Marton's 70-year-old \0Coun James Shepherd Leigh,
A37 199 ratepayers suddenly recognised as a very real thing the red light
A37 200 which this column has been flashing for months.
A37 201    |^At function after function this week I am told, it has been said,
A37 202 ^*"The situation is serious. ^We can't afford to lose experienced
A37 203 administrators at this rate.**"
A37 204 *<*4Of course not*>
A37 205    |^*0Well, of course we can't. ^What is more, unless the political
A37 206 parties themselves are prepared to admit that one way or another the
A37 207 rot must be stopped, local government in Blackpool could be in trouble
A37 208 before very long.
A37 209    |^How can the parties help? ^Obviously, I should think, by taking
A37 210 their councillors on one side and telling them it is time they started
A37 211 behaving like intelligent adults.
A37 212    |^Members of the council are not unaware why many of their
A37 213 colleagues are quitting the municipal scene, or why quite a number of
A37 214 others are sick to the teeth.
A37 215    |^They know, as one or two have said publicly, that they are going
A37 216 because they feel that under the existing set-up it is well nigh
A37 217 impossible to have even the most insignificant questions discussed
A37 218 without the political and personal element creeping into them.
A37 219 *<*4Disunity*>
A37 220    |^*0Indeed, disunity has become a matter for joking.
A37 221    |^The other day eight members of the Estates and Housing Committee,
A37 222 and four Corporation officials, made the long journey into
A37 223 Staffordshire to inspect some old people's housing schemes.
A37 224    |^The outward journey was halted for morning coffee, and I hear
A37 225 that when councillors saw the name of the hotel one of them wanted to
A37 226 know if, in making the arrangements, a Town Hall official had tried to
A37 227 be sarcastic.
A37 228    |^The name of the hotel? ^*"The Good Companions**"!
A37 229    |^By themselves, committees function reasonably well.
A37 230    |^It seems to be when committees join forces and become either the
A37 231 General Purposes Committee or a public meeting of the Town Council
A37 232 that feathers begin to fly.
A37 233    |^All hail, therefore, to one of the most recent proposals to come
A37 234 out of the Town Clerk's Department.
A37 235 *<*4Scrapped*>
A37 236    |^*0It is*- as long advocated by this column*- that the General
A37 237 Purposes Committee as at present constituted (it consists of all
A37 238 members of the council) should be scrapped, and replaced by a more
A37 239 compact and workable body.

A38  14 *<*4Lower profits from motor cycles*>
A38  15    |^*0The reimposition of the credit controls and the wet summer of
A38  16 1960 had a particularly adverse effect on the activities of motor

A38  91 price following the {0U.S.} ban on gold hoarding, sentiment being

A38 213 *<*4Gold price lowest for six weeks*>
A38 214    |^*0President Eisenhower's order forbidding {0U.S.} citizens to
A38 215 hold gold overseas brought a sharp fall in price on the London bullion
A38 216 market today.
A38 217    |^At today's official fixing by the five leading dealers, it was
A38 218 cut by 2\0s. 4\0d. per fine ounce*- the lowest point for six weeks.
A38 219    |^The dollar equivalent is 35.43 against the {0U.S.} official
A38 220 price of 35 dollars.
A38 221    |^The fall is the biggest recorded at a fixing since October 27
A38 222 when, after the City's big gold rush passed its peak, the price dipped
A38 223 6\0s. to 254\0s.
A38 224    |^The dramatic {0U.S.} move to check the flow of gold from
A38 225 America was a top talking point in the City today. ^It sparked off
A38 226 selling in a market devoid of buyers, until the price went down. ^Then
A38 227 buyers came in.
A38 228    |^The market later became steadier, and the price rose to around
A38 229 253\0s. on further buying.
A38 230    |^Of the Eisenhower ban*- announced over the weekend and six days
A38 231 before he leaves office*- one big dealer said: ^*"In all probability
A38 232 it will create a certain amount of panic selling by Americans.
A38 233    |^*"It is also going to strengthen the views of outsiders that
A38 234 devaluation of the Dollar, in their opinion, is imminent. ^So there
A38 235 may well be a return of heavy buying by them. ^This would push the
A38 236 price up.**"

A38 238    |^*0The abolition of the Schedule A tax on owner-occupied

A38 240 to \0Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, by the
A38 241 *4Association of Certified and Corporate Accountants, *0for his
A38 242 consideration prior to the Budget.
A38 243    |^The association says that while it recognises that abolition of

A38 245 considerable administrative savings.

A39   4 *<*6CREAM OF VOICES PITCH TOO HIGH FOR US*>
A39   5 *<*4By *6ALAN BENDLE*>
A39   6    |^*2NONE *0of the singers who has already won through to the rank
A39   7 of international artist will be with the Covent Garden Company when it
A39   8 opens its week's visit to Manchester on Monday.
A39   9    |^As Sir David Webster, the Garden's general administrator, has
A39  10 been pointing out, the reasons are two*- the international artists
A39  11 have too many engagements elsewhere and they are too expensive. ^The
A39  12 company cannot afford to hire them for touring.
A39  13    |^I asked Sir David to make the second reason even plainer. ^How
A39  14 much must the company pay for the services of one of the great ones, a
A39  15 Callas, a Gobbi, a Christoff, and nowadays a Joan Sutherland or a
A39  16 Geraint Evans?
A39  17    |^He shrugged his shoulders. ^*"Anything from *+300 to *+800,**" he
A39  18 said. ^*"Oh, yes, for one performance.**"
A39  19    |^It is therefore on real hard cash that he bases his argument that
A39  20 if Manchester is ready to pay the top price of, say, 25\0s. a seat,
A39  21 and fill the theatre, Manchester can expect more of the world-famous
A39  22 ones*- always provided that her claims do not unhappily conflict with
A39  23 those of La Scala, New York's Metropolitan Opera, Vienna, Venice,
A39  24 Paris, San Francisco, and the rest of the world's leading opera
A39  25 houses.
A39  26    |^The career of an international opera singer is not a particularly
A39  27 long one. ^The harvest of fame must be collected in some 15 years at
A39  28 most, and to-day, with the tax-gatherer in hot pursuit, no-one is
A39  29 likely to rival the fortune of a Caruso or a Melba.
A39  30    |
A39  31    |^*4T*2HERE *0is a more sensible attitude than that adopted by some
A39  32 of Manchester's opera fans.
A39  33    |^Taking recent years as an example, Joan Sutherland may now be
A39  34 shuttling between the States and Italy; Canadian Jon Vickers may have
A39  35 been stolen away by New York and Chicago; and Geraint Evans may be
A39  36 conquering Vienna, but we have heard them all in the near past.
A39  37    |^And there are singers with us next week who are destined for
A39  38 world renown but are still here to be listened to. ^Why should we let
A39  39 nostalgic longings spoil the pleasure of picking out to-morrow's world
A39  40 favourites?
A39  41    |^Let us, like the gentlemen of the Turf, choose half a dozen to
A39  42 follow. ^My own list is: soprano Joan Carlyle (*"{Der
A39  43 Rosenkavalier}**" and *"Boheme**"); soprano Marie Collier
A39  44 (*"Boheme**"); bass Michael Langdon (*"{Der Rosenkavalier}**");
A39  45 mezzo-soprano Josephine Veasey (*"Carmen**" and *"Peter Grimes**");
A39  46 and baritone David Ward (*"Aida**").
A39  47    |
A39  48    |^*4T*2HAT *0admirable singer Michael Langdon has one passion that
A39  49 must endear him to a wider public.
A39  50    |^When he is not using his voice as Baron Ochs in *"{Der
A39  51 Rosenkavalier}**"*- he sang the role at Covent Garden in November and
A39  52 repeats it in Manchester*- he is putting it to what I believe he
A39  53 secretly considers an equally good purpose.
A39  54    |^*"I'm Wolverhampton-born,**" he said, *"and I try to be free as
A39  55 often as possible when the Wolves are playing so that I can go and
A39  56 cheer them on.**"
A39  57    |^Well over six feet tall, he has no crowd difficulties in watching
A39  58 soccer with an expert eye. ^But he finds his height a handicap when it
A39  59 comes to his other hobby*- gardening. ^*"The garden,**" says Michael,
A39  60 *"is such a long way down!**"
A39  61    |^He has been with the company for 13 years, and already in 1950
A39  62 was singing solo roles. ^The drunken monk Varlaam, in *"Boris
A39  63 Gudonov,**" gave him a notable start, and the Grand Inquisitor, in
A39  64 *"Don Carlos**"*- as one of the cast that included Tito Gobbi and
A39  65 Boris Christoff*- was his biggest break.
A39  66    |^He went to Vienna last year to study Baron Ochs under Alfred
A39  67 Jerger, who had sung the part with Richard Strauss conducting. ^He has
A39  68 achieved a ripe humour without clowning, and as a result is to sing
A39  69 the Baron with the Hamburg State Opera.
A39  70    |
A39  71    |^*4I*2S *0the Covent Garden tour repertory too familiar?
A39  72    |^Well, you know what happens when a new work appears*- an

A39  75 the house was half-empty. ^On its second visit there was a slight

A39  82    |^S*2OMETIMES *0when you listen to a record, the backing, however
A39  83 unobtrusive it may be, attracts your attention more than the singer.
A39  84    |^I mean no slight on \0Mr. Gary Miller when I confess that this is
A39  85 what happened when I heard his record *"Dream Harbour**" (Pye,
A39  86 7N.15338).
A39  87    |^The accompaniment, a soft, oriental rhythm, came through
A39  88 entrancingly. ^It was, I discovered, the work of one of the busiest
A39  89 back-room boys of the recording world*- Bill Shepherd.
A39  90    |
A39  91    |^I note that he has credits on two other records this week*-

A39  93 by Scott Peters (Pye 7N.15343).
A39  94    |^I met Bill for a few minutes just before he began yet another
A39  95 session for a {0BBC} programme. ^Chubby, cheerful, duffle-coated and
A39  96 carrying a bag containing 40 precious band arrangements.
A39  97    |^*"I've done all sorts of things,**" he said. ^*"I was a singer
A39  98 with a group called the Coronets. ^I've played a few instruments, and
A39  99 I was once a journalist. ^But I'm happy just now to be one of the
A39 100 people behind the big vocal stars.**"
A39 101    |^Bill spends his spare time with the other sort of stars*- his

A39 105    |^So much of it that you feel that if she set her mind on swimming
A39 106 the Channel or breeding champion poodles, or anything, she'd do it.
A39 107    |^As it is she just wants to sing.
A39 108    |^*"When I was a little girl,**" said the 24-year-old shapely miss
A39 109 from Trinidad, *"my mother said I ought to learn to type or do
A39 110 dressmaking, or something like that. ^But I wanted to sing*- so I just
A39 111 sang.**"
A39 112    |^She began on the West Indies radio station's equivalent of
A39 113 Children's Hour. ^Then she graduated to her weekly programmes.
A39 114    |^She sang in clubs and in concerts, until she looked around one
A39 115 day and asked herself: ^*"Where do I go from here?**"
A39 116    |^The answer was London. ^With her usual determination she arrived
A39 117 last July. ^She didn't know a single soul.
A39 118    |
A39 119    |^*4B*2UT *0she started to sing*- and that was enough. ^She has
A39 120 just made her first record for Philips, called *"Kiss Me**" (326547,
A39 121 BF).
A39 122    |^*"It's a pop song,**" she admitted. ^*"And I want to sing jazz.
A39 123 ^Jazz, jazz, jazz, that's for me.**"
A39 124    |^She called herself Billie (although her real name is Grace) after
A39 125 her model, her idol, the late Billie Holliday. ^*"There will never be
A39 126 another like her,**" she said.
A39 127    |^Next month Billie makes her first {0EP}*- as a genuine jazz

A39 132 (Columbia, 45-DB.4591) and Ray Garnett ({0R.C.A.} 1228) will

A39 139    |^T*2HOUGH *0one thinks of Tchaikovsky mainly as a lightly popular
A39 140 orchestral composer, he did write more than 100 songs, many of them
A39 141 very fine indeed. ^But, apart from *"None But The Weary Heart,**" few
A39 142 of them are generally known.
A39 143    |^Just how rewarding these songs are may be judged from the
A39 144 fourteen selected by Boris Christoff in a new {0LP} recital
A39 145 ({0HMV} ALP 1793). ^Christoff, whose gifts are well known at Covent
A39 146 Garden, admirably varies the use of his splendid bass voice to suit
A39 147 the mood of the songs*- from, for instance, the vigour of *"Don Juan's
A39 148 Serenade**" to an enchanting mezza-voce in the gentler moments.
A39 149    |^The value of the disc is enhanced by a phonetic version of the

A39 158    |^Miss Courtney's skin is normally as white as any English city
A39 159 dweller's, and her hair, she told me, *"is really like yours*- an
A39 160 ordinary, mousy shade.**"
A39 161    |^As I straightened a strand of my ordinary, mousy hair, she added:
A39 162 ^*"The management pays me to keep it dyed as long as I'm playing

A39 164    |
A39 165    |^*4W*2E *0were talking in her dressing-room at Manchester's Palace
A39 166 Theatre, where Miss Courtney is giving an exciting performance as the
A39 167 sultry Indian girl in *"Rose Marie,**" and sometimes we had to talk
A39 168 pretty loudly.
A39 169    |^From a dressing-room down the corridor came the sounds of David
A39 170 Whitfield limbering up his voice, now almost back to normal volume
A39 171 after an illness which recently kept him out of the show for two
A39 172 weeks.
A39 173    |^*1And from the pipes in the corner came less musical gurglings as
A39 174 the water from the bathroom upstairs drained away.
A39 175    |^*0*"I count the number of baths people have during the evenings,
A39 176 to be sure there'll be enough hot water left for me,**" said Miss
A39 177 Courtney. ^*"I need that bath badly.**"
A39 178    |^She has to wash off the coppery make-up which covers most of her
A39 179 body, and, particularly on days when there are two performances, that
A39 180 means a good deal of washing.
A39 181    |
A39 182    |^*4B*2UT *0Miss Courtney is perfectly happy in any amount of
A39 183 water, provided it's not too cold. ^As a child she lived at Herne Bay,
A39 184 and her mother, a professional swimmer, diver, and dancer, soon had
A39 185 little Virginia following in her wake.
A39 186    |^*"I just cannot remember a time when I couldn't swim,**" she told
A39 187 me. ^*"It's quite possible that I might have swum the Channel, though
A39 188 the longest measured distance I ever covered was only five miles.
A39 189    |^*1*"In open water, distance doesn't bother me as long as I can
A39 190 take my time and just plod on.**"
A39 191    |^*0She is also an expert skin diver, and between dancing and
A39 192 acting engagements has appeared in big aqua shows and modelled
A39 193 swim-suits under water.
A39 194    |^While dancing in a *"Five Past Eight**" revue in Glasgow she was
A39 195 called on to do some swimming in a Royal Command performance.
A39 196    |
A39 197    |^*4*"I*2T'S *0funny,**" mused Morton Fraser, *"to think that last
A39 198 year Don Arroll was working for me. ^And next week he'll be top of the
A39 199 bill at Manchester Hippodrome with the Harmonica Gang in support.
A39 200    |^*"Not that I mind at all. ^He's a very nice lad with a lot of
A39 201 talent and we're happy to be working with him on this variety tour.**"
A39 202    |^*1*"All the same the rapid rise of the young comic is a prime
A39 203 example of the potency of {0TV}, for without his spell as compere of
A39 204 the Sunday Palladium show, Don Arroll would still be using his
A39 205 undoubted talent in much lowlier spots on the bill.
A39 206    |^*0Fraser and his gang have spent most of this week in Manchester,
A39 207 although their Hippodrome date does not begin until Monday. ^They have
A39 208 been working on a new {0BBC} {0TV} musical show which makes its debut
A39 209 next Saturday, and on Thursday were in Edinburgh for a {0TV} show
A39 210 with Charlie Chester.
A39 211    |^For the last eight years Fraser has left the stage performances
A39 212 to his gang, and has concentrated behind the scenes on management
A39 213 problems and finding a steady supply of bookings.

A39 217 doctor.
A39 218    |^Fraser told me: ^*"We had been playing Cardiff, and I arrived at
A39 219 the Oldham Empire with the gang and a dreadfully sore throat.
A39 220    |^*"The theatre manager sent for a doctor, who told me: ^*'There's

A40   2 *<*6BROTHER JOHN AND THE GRANDAD ROACH*>
A40   3 *<*5by David Hanington*>
A40   4    |^*6THERE *4are too many fish in the old monks' pool. ^One
A40   5 especially is causing Brother John a certain amount of concern. ^*"It
A40   6 is a roach,**" said Brother John, in tones of respectful piety.
A40   7 ^*"Huge chap. ^Sometimes we see him swimming about beneath the water
A40   8 lilies, as big as a submarine.**"
A40   9    |^*0The fish on Brother John's 300-acre estate present a problem,
A40  10 certainly. ^But they are unlikely to daunt him. ^For Brother John has
A40  11 hooked bigger fish in his time.
A40  12    |^Barrister... coal-miner... flying-officer... farmer...
A40  13 {0M.P.}... and father of six sons.
A40  14    |^John Faithful Fortescue Platts-Mills is not a Brother in the
A40  15 monastic sense. ^His fellow trade-unionists have adopted it as a
A40  16 nickname, for \0Mr. Platts-Mills is a staunch union man. ^He belongs
A40  17 to the Transport and General Workers' Union. ^*"As a farm worker, I
A40  18 qualify,**" he says.
A40  19    |^Last weekend Brother John threw open the grounds of his
A40  20 magnificent home near Buxted for a union rally. ^More than 1,000 union
A40  21 men and their families arrived to play bowls, eat barbecued chicken
A40  22 and row on his fish-infested lake.
A40  23    |^Brother John is one of those complex characters*- a landowner
A40  24 with vigorous Socialist (with a small *"s**") theories.
A40  25    |^His energy and enterprise have brought him wealth: he spent the
A40  26 money from his first big brief in buying a farm in Essex just before
A40  27 the war. ^But he still adheres to a strong union outlook. ^*"Property
A40  28 in Britain is privately owned, so I own property,**" he said. ^*"But I
A40  29 am still in favour of the nationalisation of land for all new
A40  30 buildings.**"
A40  31    |^He wore sandals and an open-necked shirt when I met him this
A40  32 week. ^His baggy grey flannels were supported by a polka-dot tie
A40  33 instead of a belt.
A40  34    |^*"Today is the last day of my holiday,**" he explained. ^(His
A40  35 *"holiday,**" incidentally, has consisted of working on his farm with
A40  36 a vigour which would dismay most other men on the shady side of 50).
A40  37    |^\0Mr. Platts-Mills's career details read like a plot for a
A40  38 schoolboy adventure story. ^He was born in New Zealand, won a Rhodes
A40  39 Scholarship to Oxford, and got his {0M.A.} (1st Class), and Bachelor
A40  40 of Civil Law. ^At Oxford he rowed, played rugby for his college and
A40  41 was in the Varsity boxing team as a heavyweight.
A40  42    |^He married, and when war started he joined the {0R.A.F.} ^By
A40  43 1944 he was a collier in Yorkshire, the first professional man to
A40  44 become one of the *"Bevin boys.**" ^He joined the miners' union, and
A40  45 in 1945 became {0M.P.} for Finsbury.
A40  46    |^But drastic differences of opinion developed. ^Platts-Mills
A40  47 quarrelled with Attlee and Bevin about the stand being taken by the
A40  48 Government over the Cold War. ^*"I was promoted out of the Labour
A40  49 Party,**" he said, with a wry grin at his own choice of words. ^For
A40  50 two years he sat as an Independent Labour member. ^At the next
A40  51 election he lost his seat, and has not turned to politics since.
A40  52    |^He still believes, however, in the policy of amity piercing the
A40  53 Iron Curtain. ^Brother John is chairman of the British-Soviet
A40  54 Friendship Society. ^His four older sons have all walked on
A40  55 ban-the-bomb marches.
A40  56    |^The house they have lived in for four years is spacious. ^As
A40  57 \0Mr. Platts-Mills explained: ^*"We're tall chaps*- and there are a
A40  58 lot of us. ^We need a lot of room.**"
A40  59    |^His eldest son, Tim, 24, is a timber worker on the estate. ^The
A40  60 others are variously engaged at Oxford, in the manufacturing world,
A40  61 and as a film editor. ^The two youngest*- *"babies,**" their father
A40  62 calls them, although they are 12 and 10 respectively*- are at boarding
A40  63 school.
A40  64    |^\0Mr. Platts-Mills breeds prize pigs*- there are about 300 of
A40  65 them,*- and they respond admirably to his farming techniques. ^*"They
A40  66 regard me,**" he says, *"as one of the family.**"
A40  67    |^The other side of his career is as a successful barrister, based
A40  68 in Temple, {0E.C.}4. ^He was one of the defending counsel at the
A40  69 preliminary hearing of the Worthing bank murder case.
A40  70    |^Politics seem far away, as one strolls casually round his lovely
A40  71 13th century house, formerly a monastery and after that a rectory*-
A40  72 the Platts-Mills still have to pay an annual tithe for their property.
A40  73    |^But \0Mr. Platts-Mills is a man of many parts. ^*"It may be that
A40  74 I may take up politics again,**" he said. ^*"But so far I haven't
A40  75 given it much serious thought.**"
A40  76    |^If he does, I imagine Brother John will set about it with the
A40  77 same determination he shows in every other way: whether he is
A40  78 directing an impassioned plea in wig and gown, or denouncing
A40  79 unscrupulous bosses to his fellow-workers.
A40  80    |^I don't envy the future of that grand-daddy roach!
A40  81 *<*4Spotlight on Shoreham Harbour*>
A40  82 *<*6A VISITOR IN THE VIKING TRADITION*>
A40  83 *<BY \0CAPT. \0J. FOGGITT*>
A40  84    |^W*2OODEN *0ships and iron men were the boast of seamen long ago,
A40  85 and one would be justified in thinking the old adage no longer
A40  86 applied. ^But the spirit of those old days was revived at Shoreham
A40  87 Harbour last weekend when the Norwegian vessel Presthus 2 berthed at
A40  88 the east end of Aldrington basin.
A40  89    |^Constructed in the manner of the old Viking ships so famous in
A40  90 the history books, this sturdy little craft of only 118\0ft. length
A40  91 and 89 net tons is, except for the engines and accompanying equipment,
A40  92 built entirely of wood.
A40  93    |^Norwegian built at Rosendal in 1943, the hull is planked with 4
A40  94 1/2 inch pitch-pine on 6\0in. by 6\0in. frames drawing down to a
A40  95 2\0ft. by 4\0ft. keel, frames being spaced from 6\0in. to a foot
A40  96 apart.
A40  97    |^There is an inner lining of similar construction to that of the
A40  98 outer planking, and the space between the two shells is insulated
A40  99 throughout against the effects of outside temperatures, hatch combings
A40 100 and covers being built-up and insulated in like manner. ^Although
A40 101 designed on trawler lines, she was expressly built for the carrying of
A40 102 frozen goods.
A40 103    |^She is something more than a refrigerator ship though, and is in
A40 104 fact a deep freeze carrier. ^She brought 120 tons of deep frozen
A40 105 vegetables, mostly peas, from Antwerp to Shoreham for distribution to
A40 106 the deep freeze food markets. ^This is a new venture in the port and
A40 107 this first cargo will open yet another type of trade to Shoreham
A40 108 harbour.
A40 109    |^Powered by a Norwegian-type diesel engine, this little ship has
A40 110 made many deep-water passages, crossing the North Atlantic on a number
A40 111 of occasions to Iceland, Greenland and Canadian ports. ^There is
A40 112 something of the Nelson touch about \0Capt. Gloppholm, the master of
A40 113 this tough little craft, and his crew of six stalwarts when they tell
A40 114 of the exciting trips they have made together and the manner of their
A40 115 boasting of the seaworthiness of the ship in which they serve.
A40 116    |^Although there were complaints of the liveliness of her capers in
A40 117 heavy weather and of being thrown out of their bunks on many
A40 118 occasions, they were quick to point out that she is a first-class
A40 119 sea-boat.
A40 120    |^Apart from the radio and a small Decca set, there are none of the
A40 121 modern aids to navigation on board so the skipper and his mate must
A40 122 needs be masters of their craft.
A40 123 *<*4Paper cargo*>
A40 124    |^*0Most of the foreign ships this week have been Dutchmen.
A40 125 ^Henriette B and Zaanstroom from Amsterdam came to the inner lay-by,
A40 126 Molensingel loaded spent oxide at the gasworks for Nantes, Equator
A40 127 brought fir logs from Kristiansund, Norway, to Aldrington Basin for
A40 128 the Marley Tile \0Co., and Aerdenhout came from Isnas, Finland, with
A40 129 timber and paper.
A40 130    |^There was a newcomer to the power station on Wednesday with the
A40 131 arrival of the {0B.E.A.} collier Cliff Quay, named after the power
A40 132 station at Ipswich.
A40 133    |^The wine and spirit trades still continue to flourish with the
A40 134 British {0m.v.} Drake bringing brandy from Tonnay Charente early in
A40 135 the week and the Spanish {0m.v.} Canton Pequena bringing sherry from
A40 136 Spain.
A40 137 *<*4Getting up steam for celebration*>
A40 138    |^*6RAILWAY *4enthusiasts are getting up steam for a really
A40 139 important anniversary celebration*- the 100th birthday of the Shoreham
A40 140 to Steyning line along which the Steyning Flier, the most famous train
A40 141 in West Sussex, still puffs every day.
A40 142    |^*0But, despite the painstaking research which occupies the
A40 143 leisure hours of the keener enthusiasts, this anniversary nearly
A40 144 slipped by unnoticed.
A40 145    |^It was 18-year-old Steyning Grammar School boy *4Michael Keeney,
A40 146 *0of Atherton, Jarvis-lane, Steyning, who came upon the fact that the
A40 147 Shoreham to Henfield railway, via Steyning, opened on July 1, 1861.
A40 148    |^He got to work immediately. ^He and the headmaster of Steyning
A40 149 County Primary School, \0Mr. {0E. C. G.} Lewis, went delving into
A40 150 the files of newspapers of 100 years ago. ^Some fascinating facts were
A40 151 unearthed, which today are not without their touch of humour.
A40 152    |^Take the story of *"A Narrow Escape.**" ^It happened shortly
A40 153 before the track was officially opened, when a ballast train was
A40 154 chugging down the line. ^It concerns a character called Humphry of
A40 155 Henfield, an unfortunate lad who suffered from deafness.
A40 156    |^He was observed 150 yards in front of the engine, walking between
A40 157 the metals with an eel-spear over his shoulder.
A40 158    |^In dramatic prose, the report takes up the story: ^*"The engine
A40 159 driver blew his whistle but no heed was taken. ^Fortunately a
A40 160 gentleman was on the engine who knew the lad to be deaf so that it
A40 161 would be impossible by sound to make him aware of his danger. ^The
A40 162 brake was applied, and every means used to stop the train, fortunately
A40 163 with success.**"
A40 164    |^The report does not say so, but one hopes that Humphry just kept
A40 165 on walking between the metals, blissfully unaware of the iron monster
A40 166 behind him, until, in his own good time, he reached his destination
A40 167 and put down his eel-spear, waving cheerily to the engine driver as he
A40 168 passed.
A40 169    |^Facts about the opening ceremony of the line will come in useful,
A40 170 for schoolboy Michael is hard at work talking British Railways into a
A40 171 commemoration run with an ancient engine.
A40 172    |^He dreams of prising period costumes from their mothballs in the
A40 173 railways' museum to be worn by officials on the big day. ^He may
A40 174 succeed if enough enthusiasts get in touch with him, and he can
A40 175 guarantee a train load of guests.
A40 176    |^If it comes off, it should be quite a day, but it is unlikely to
A40 177 finish with a dinner of the scale provided at the White Horse,
A40 178 Steyning, 100 years ago.
A40 179    |^Then, 70 or 80 persons sat down. ^Says a newspaper report: ^*"The
A40 180 dinner was altogether excellent and the champagne of the finest
A40 181 vintage.**"
A40 182    |^After the loyal toasts, the health of *"The Army**", *"The
A40 183 Navy**" and *"The Volunteers**" were successively drunk. ^Almost as an
A40 184 afterthought came the toast *"Health and success to the directors,
A40 185 managers and officials of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway
A40 186 Company.**"
A40 187    |^Meanwhile, the Storrington Rifle Band were in action with a piece
A40 188 called *"The Nightingale,**" upon which, says the report, the party
A40 189 broke up.

A41   4 **[LIST**]
A41   5    |^*6DELIGHTFUL! ^*4When Motherwell play like this that's the only
A41   6 possible way to describe them.
A41   7    |^And, glory be, they now have somebody to stick them in the net.
A41   8 ^Sure, big Pat Delaney missed some pinches. ^About a dozen as a
A41   9 conservative estimate.
A41  10    |^But he scored three goals, laid on one, hit the post with a
A41  11 header, and had two more net-stretchers disallowed for infringements.
A41  12    |^*0So altogether you can say Jimmy Delaney's boy had a reasonably
A41  13 successful afternoon.
A41  14    |^There was a laugh before the start when 'Well skipper Willie
A41  15 McSeveney came out some 20 yards ahead of his team mates. ^It looked
A41  16 for a moment as if he were going to tackle Hibs single-handed.
A41  17    |^From the final score, you might think he could have done, at
A41  18 that.
A41  19    |^Not so. ^Until they were latterly demoralised by the jinking
A41  20 homesters, this was quite a good Hibs team. ^Lack of forward cohesion
A41  21 was the rock on which they foundered.
A41  22    |^A Bobby Young *"goal**" disallowed for offside in the fifth
A41  23 minute set the game alight.
A41  24    |^But the first legitimate counter went to Hibs. ^Weir stopped a
A41  25 Stevenson shot, dropped it, then scooped it out straight to Preston,
A41  26 who drove home through a crowded goalmouth.
A41  27    |^A deft Delaney header from a McPhee cross restored equality.
A41  28 ^Then came tragedy for Simpson, who had executed wonder saves from
A41  29 Hunter, Delaney, and McPhee. ^A long, down-the-middle ball eluded
A41  30 Preston and Delaney. ^Simpson ran out, completely missed his kick, and
A41  31 Delaney walked it home.
A41  32    |^*4After the turn 'Well ran riot. ^Roberts shivered the bar.
A41  33 ^Shots flew everywhere around Simpson's goal.
A41  34    |^*0Delaney wrapped number three up in silver paper for McPhee.
A41  35 ^Next Pat netted an *"offside**" one. ^Then he sent Young off, and was
A41  36 in position to capitalise the youngster's cross. ^And in the last
A41  37 minute Pat rocketed home another, only to find the whistle had gone
A41  38 for a penalty for Baird fouling Quinn.
A41  39    |^Pat Quinn, as is his custom, made no mistake with the spot kick.
A41  40    |^Quinn has been called *"the little General.**" ^Here he was a
A41  41 combination of Montgomery, Napoleon, Horrocks, and all the Generals
A41  42 you ever heard of.
A41  43    |^Just a hair's-breadth behind was Willie Hunter. ^Thomson was a
A41  44 topper, too. ^And Delaney, of course. ^But 'Well really hadn't a
A41  45 failure.
A41  46    |^The home crowd goosed Sammy Baird unmercifully for a few minor
A41  47 indiscretions. ^But Sam, along with Grant, Easton, and Simpson, was a
A41  48 real Hibs stalwart.
A41  49    |^Yes, Simpson. ^Never mind that second goal. ^Crowd*- 5500.

A41  53 **[LIST**]
A41  54    |^*6WHAT *4a dream debut for young 19-year-old Jackie Sinclair!
A41  55 ^Playing his first League game before the home crowd, the ex-Blairhall
A41  56 junior, who lives in Dunfermline, scored a glorious hat-trick and
A41  57 fitted into the scheme of things perfectly.
A41  58    |^Sure, he still has a bit to go*- but one thing he *6CAN *4do is
A41  59 put the ball in the net, and that's good enough to go on with.
A41  60    |^Take a good look at the names of the other goal-scorers. ^Not a
A41  61 solitary from \0Messrs Charles Dickson and his inside-forward cronies.
A41  62 ^This is no criticism of the trio, but it illustrates how potentially
A41  63 good this Dunfermline team can be.
A41  64    |^*0It took them a long time to get the first goal, but the writing
A41  65 was always on the wall, and once they found the net there was no
A41  66 stopping them.
A41  67    |^Two Airdrie goals within a minute of each other late in the
A41  68 second half jolted them, but that was all.
A41  69    |^These goals apart, all Airdrie had to offer was a stout-hearted
A41  70 defence and excellent sportsmanship. ^They were outmanoeuvred all
A41  71 along, but refused to go under and never stooped to a shady action.
A41  72    |^After a first half of frustration, young Sinclair showed the way.
A41  73 ^Just on the half-time whistle he hit a Cunningham free-kick past
A41  74 Dempster close to the near post.
A41  75    |^After the interval, Miller scored the best goal of the game.
A41  76 ^Over came a Melrose corner. ^The left-half ran a good 15 yards from
A41  77 around the penalty spot and his header flew into the net.
A41  78 *<*6TWO BEAUTIES.*>
A41  79    |^*0Then George Peebles decided to take a hand. ^Within five
A41  80 minutes he fired a couple of beauties into the net. ^Sinclair finished
A41  81 off the Dunfermline scoring.
A41  82    |^*4First he hit a left-footer cleanly into the net, and then sank
A41  83 a penalty like a veteran after Shanks had handled his first shot,
A41  84 which finished over the line.
A41  85    |^*0Storrie and Hinshelwood were the Airdrie scorers. ^Both beat
A41  86 Connachan from around the 20-yard mark.
A41  87    |^No criticism of the Dunfermline defence*- they were never
A41  88 stretched. ^All three halves were immense while the forward line,
A41  89 switching and changing, had a real field day.
A41  90    |^Very few bouquets for Airdrie. ^Say Johnstone, McNeil, and
A41  91 Newlands earned pass marks, and that's about it. ^Crowd*- 8000.

A41  98 for a return to the big time. ^In that period they shattered Rovers'
A41  99 defence with three snappy goals.
A41 100    |^But for the remaining 75 minutes they proceeded to show why they
A41 101 have faltered in recent weeks. ^Slackness and complacency allowed
A41 102 Rovers to come right back into the picture with two good goals, and
A41 103 for the last 15 minutes Clyde were a worried lot.
A41 104 *<*6LEARY STARS.*>
A41 105    |^*4Main reason for the sway of fortune centred round Dennis Leary,
A41 106 the Rovers' pivot. ^After a disastrous start he found his feet, and
A41 107 from then on his wing halves, Harvey and McLure, got to grips with the
A41 108 attack, and the early Shawfield promise faded completely.
A41 109    |^McLaughlin capably led Clyde's attack in the early spell and had
A41 110 two good goals in 5 and 15 minutes. ^Between times, big John Colrain,
A41 111 who finished limping on the wing, got the other goal*- in the 7th

A41 120 ^Certainly they're already playing Second Division football. ^They
A41 121 were all triers, but they had no plan, no science, no cohesion, in
A41 122 fact, not a clue.
A41 123    |^And, worse still, they brought United down to the same dreadful
A41 124 level. ^Some of the attempts at ball control and passing were
A41 125 positively ludicrous.
A41 126    |^For 81 minutes this hopeless spectacle shaped like a goalless
A41 127 draw because over-anxious United, with all the territorial advantage,
A41 128 didn't seem to know how to circumvent a desperate defence.
A41 129    |^*0First *"goal,**" in six minutes came for Albion from Rowan, but
A41 130 the winger was obviously offside.
A41 131    |^Somewhat laboriously the Tannadice team built up attack after
A41 132 attack. ^There was little fluency in their movements, and certainly no
A41 133 finish. ^Carlyle and Gillespie missed inviting chances. ^Then Neil
A41 134 Mochan tingled Jim Brown's fingers. ^Again the goalie saved the Albion
A41 135 bacon when he fisted over a whizzer from Dennis Gillespie.
A41 136    |^The once-in-a-while Stirling raids came mainly through Kilgannon
A41 137 and Rowan, for not one of the inside trio measured up to anything like
A41 138 First Division standard.
A41 139    |^The encouraging Tannadice howl had become a despairing ~*"\2Och,
A41 140 come on, United**" groan before Tommy Neilson made the vocalists happy
A41 141 by beating Brown.
A41 142    |^*4Like magic, the strain left the team. ^Mochan swerved a ball to
A41 143 Walter Carlyle five minutes later, and the centre settled the
A41 144 destination of the points.
A41 145 *<*6GORDON IN FORM.*>
A41 146    |^*0Good players were extremely scarce. ^Albion were well served by

A41 148 attacking sorties.
A41 149    |^Of the home lot, \0Alex. Brown was practically unemployed, Gordon
A41 150 the best back afield, Neilson the only half-back with any finesse, and
A41 151 Gillespie the only real footballer in either front line.

A42 147 other Commonwealth Prime Ministers, have been among the borrowers of
A42 148 books from Princes Risborough's branch library, the public seems less
A42 149 keen on reading, the library's annual report reveals. ^The number of
A42 150 books issued has dropped by 10,000 compared with last year.
A42 151    |^Closing of the library on Wednesday morning probably accounted in
A42 152 part for the decrease in the number of books issued, but the extra
A42 153 morning enabled more time to be given to administrative work, as a
A42 154 result of which new books have been more quickly circulated, books
A42 155 needing repair have had more regular revision and readers' requests
A42 156 have been speeded up.
A42 157    |^*4More people have been using the library as a source of
A42 158 information, especially children, and the library has also played its
A42 159 part in the recreational and cultural life of Princes Risborough.
A42 160    |^*0Last summer the library served as a point of contact between a
A42 161 lecturer from Oxford University and people likely to be interested in
A42 162 a class in modern literature*- and such a class was successfully
A42 163 launched in the autumn, books for the class being lent from the
A42 164 library's headquarters.

A42 167 and \0Mrs. {0J. E.} Taylor, of High-street, Prestwood, has gained a
A42 168 first class honours \0B.Sc. degree from Leeds University. ^Three years
A42 169 ago he won a County Scholarship to the University from \0Dr.
A42 170 Challoner's Grammar School at Amersham. ^He is planning a career in
A42 171 engineering, starting with a year's spell with a Leeds firm.

A42 178 *<*4Bright Prospects For A Bigger Wycombe School*>
A42 179    |^*6OFFICIALS *4and supporters of High Wycombe Show, taking heart
A42 180 from the present brilliant summer weather and the bright forecasts of
A42 181 more to come, are striving to make this year's show in September
A42 182 bigger and better than ever.
A42 183    |^It will be the first show since the appointment of the new
A42 184 secretary, \0Mr. Wilfred Heritage*- former High Wycombe police
A42 185 superintendent. ^And his all-consuming ambition at the moment is to
A42 186 put the show on to a firm financial footing.
A42 187    |^*0A bad-weather spell last year cost the show a credit reserve
A42 188 which had been slowly built up, and a committee was appointed to
A42 189 explore ways in which funds could be raised during the year. ^It has
A42 190 made a good start. ^But still it must be emphasised that to ensure the
A42 191 show's continued existence for the general benefit and advertisement
A42 192 of the town and district, more subscribing members and vice-presidents
A42 193 are needed.
A42 194    |^Officials feel that they must have a regular income on which to
A42 195 rely*- lessening their dependence on the weather.
A42 196    |^*4This year the show will stage the southern area finals of the
A42 197 *"Foxhunter**" competition, the winners going on direct to the main
A42 198 show in London. ^The Green Jackets will stage a marching band display,
A42 199 and there will be, among other attractions, a session of American
A42 200 baseball.
A42 201    |^*0Already there is a demand for trade stand space, and in the
A42 202 horticultural section, always a strong feature, there will be some new
A42 203 exhibits.

A43   3    |^*4A *2SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD *0girl's evidence was heard {6in camera}
A43   4 by Wigan magistrates on Wednesday when three Carlisle men were charged
A43   5 with an offence against her.
A43   6    |^The magistrates (\0Mr. \0E. Routledge and \0Mr. \0J. Holiday) sat
A43   7 all day listening to evidence in the case against John Earl (28) a
A43   8 painter, address given as 16 Brookside, Raffles; Eldon Edward Cole
A43   9 (25), labourer, address given as 32 Castle Street, and Lawrence Dixon
A43  10 (22), labourer, address given as 87 Dalton Avenue, Raffles.
A43  11    |^The case was adjourned until August 16th because a witness from
A43  12 the {0N.W.} Forensic Laboratories at Preston, was unable to attend.
A43  13    |^The men who were represented by \0Mr. Lionel Lightfoot, Carlisle,
A43  14 appeared, on remand, and their bail in the sum of *+50 each was
A43  15 extended.
A43  16    |^\0Mr. \0A. Carr, Wigton, prosecuting said that the girl met Dixon
A43  17 at a fair earlier and went for a walk with him. ^He pulled her down
A43  18 and interfered with her clothes inspite of her struggles and pleas.
A43  19 ^They walked back to the fair together, and she later agreed to him
A43  20 taking her home. ^When they reached the Silloth Cafe the other two
A43  21 accused drew up in a van and said they would give her a lift home.
A43  22 ^She refused because she did not like the other two.
A43  23 *<*"*6LIFTED INTO VAN**"*>
A43  24    |^*0As she was walking up the street the van stopped beside her and
A43  25 one of the men lifted her into it and shut the door. ^She did not have
A43  26 time to shout or struggle and the van drove off.
A43  27    |^\0Mr. Carr alleged that all three men committed offences against
A43  28 the girl in the van despite her protests and struggles.
A43  29    |^The girl was taken on to Carlisle and Cole told her she had
A43  30 better stay at his place for the night, and there \0Mr. Carr alleged,
A43  31 Cole committed two more offences against her. ^She was taken to the
A43  32 station on Sunday and given 7/6\0d for her fare home.
A43  33    |^When the three were charged they all denied the offence.
A43  34 ^*"But**" added \0Mr. Carr, *"evidence is available which corroborates
A43  35 the girl's account.**"
A43  36    |^\0Dr. Robert \0M. Yule, of Silloth said in evidence that he
A43  37 examined the girl on July 9, and the result of his examination could
A43  38 be compatible with rape.
A43  39 *<*6REPORTED MISSING*>
A43  40    |^*0Constable James Armstrong said that the girl was reported
A43  41 missing by her parents at 1 {0a.m.} on Sunday July 9. ^A search was
A43  42 made, but she was not found until she was seen walking towards her
A43  43 home having come off the afternoon train from Carlisle.
A43  44    |^Interviewed, Dixon made a statement which was put in as evidence
A43  45 and the Constable alleged that Cole said that he had a clear
A43  46 conscience.
A43  47    |^Constable \0G. Lowther alleged that Earl told him that he had not
A43  48 touched the girl. ^They had gone to the fair in Silloth on the
A43  49 Saturday night and his pal *"Lol**" (Dixon) picked up a girl. ^They
A43  50 took her with them to Carlisle in the back of the van. ^They stopped
A43  51 at a cafe and *"Collo**" (Cole) took her a cup of tea and some
A43  52 biscuits. ^He (Earl) offered to take her back to Silloth but she said
A43  53 it was too late to go home and she went into the house with
A43  54 *"Collo**". ^They put her on the 1 {0p.m.} train for Silloth. ^The
A43  55 Constable added that when he cautioned and charged Earl with an
A43  56 offence against the girl he said he had nothing to say.

A43  62 to pay a total of *+5 7\0s 2\0d, and told by the chairman, \0Mr.

A43  67 Hensingham and three sixteen-year-olds denied doing wilful damage to a
A43  68 hay mew, estimated at *+10.

A43  70 he and his family were returning home from a visit to friends, he
A43  71 heard a disturbance in the barn and tried to catch the culprits.
A43  72 ^*"Three or four young men rushed out of the barn and got away,**" he
A43  73 said.
A43  74 *<*6FOUND IN BARN.*>
A43  75    |^*0The following Sunday night there was a similar incident in the
A43  76 barn.
A43  77    |^*"I telephoned for the police,**" said \0Mr. Spedding, *"and when
A43  78 {0P.C.} Vallance arrived we entered the barn and found these lads
A43  79 there. ^About 30 or 40 bales of hay had been pulled down and were
A43  80 scattered over the barn. ^Much of the hay had to be rebaled and it
A43  81 took my son and I all day on Monday to get the place in order
A43  82 again.**"
A43  83    |^{0P.C.} Joseph Vallance stated that all five were on top of the
A43  84 mew *"jumping about**" and a large amount of hay was loose and
A43  85 trampled.
A43  86    |^One of the defendants told the Magistrates ^*"We thought we'd
A43  87 just have a \2laal bit of fun in the barn. ^We didn't do all that
A43  88 damage. ^The farmer's wife said it could have been done by some boys
A43  89 who had pulled down dykes before.**"
A43  90    |^None of the other four gave evidence in support of their *"not
A43  91 guilty**" plea.

A43  96    |^*"I feel we are the most central for the Frizington, Arlecdon and
A43  97 southern areas,**" he said. ^Referring to Egremont, who are also in

A43  99 feeling of jealousy between the two towns in this.**"
A43 100    |^A letter from \0Mr. {0G. S.} Bessey, Cumberland Director of
A43 101 Education stated that the County Youth Committee could not support
A43 102 Cleator Moor's claim but wished to know of developments. ^Remarked
A43 103 Councillor Collighan: ^*"I feel we will get no help from the County
A43 104 Council, except on the planning side.**"
A43 105    |^He thought they would get help from Ennerdale {0*2R.D.C.}, *0if
A43 106 that Council agreed there should be a swimming bath in its area.
A43 107 *<*6IN OLD MARKET?*>
A43 108    |^*0The Clerk, \0Mr. Ian Brown, recalled that it had been suggested
A43 109 that the old covered market might be suitable. ^Proceeds from the
A43 110 pending sale of Bowthorn Recreation Ground could be devoted to the
A43 111 cost of the baths.
A43 112    |^It was agreed to forward the suggestions to Ennerdale
A43 113 {0*2R.D.C.}
A43 114    |^*0It was decided to ask the {0*2R.D.C.} *0to adopt a by-law

A44   2 *<*6*+16 1/2 MILLION ESTIMATES FOR EDUCATION*>
A44   3 *<*4Cheshire make provision for increased numbers*>
A44   4    |^I*2N *0the next financial year Cheshire Education Committee
A44   5 proposes to spend *+16,499,935, an estimate which represents an
A44   6 increase of *+1,265,710 over the estimated figure for 1960.
A44   7    |^This was agreed at the last meeting of the Committee when it was
A44   8 stated that the estimated income for the year was *+1,459,020. ^The
A44   9 difference between this and the expenditure has to be found from rates
A44  10 and taxes.
A44  11    |^Commenting on the proposal, \0Dr. {0J. G.} Kellett, the County
A44  12 Director of Education, says that in formulating the estimates for
A44  13 1961, the Committee has had to make provision, not only for
A44  14 maintaining and improving the standards in the 568 schools and
A44  15 colleges throughout the county, but also for the large increase in the
A44  16 number of pupils in primary and secondary schools, and students
A44  17 undertaking further education.
A44  18    |^The number of pupils on the roll of primary schools is at present
A44  19 79,720 and the estimated number next year is 80,755, an increase of
A44  20 1,035.
A44  21    |^This increase is brought about by the natural increase in the
A44  22 County's population and also by the continual migration of people into
A44  23 the County.
A44  24    |^Cheshire is attractive from the point of view of residence, and
A44  25 the development of industry within the County and in neighbouring
A44  26 areas means an ever-increasing influx of new population. ^Added to
A44  27 this the total population is increased by overspill developments.
A44  28 *<*6SMALLER CLASSES*>
A44  29    |^*0However, despite the continuing high level of the primary
A44  30 school population in Cheshire, considerable progress continues to be
A44  31 made, as a result of new schools and additional classrooms, in the
A44  32 direction of the elimination of over-sized classes ({0i.e.} classes
A44  33 with over 40 on roll).
A44  34    |^Whereas in 1957 the percentage of such classes was 32.9, at
A44  35 September, 1960, the percentage had been reduced to 23.6. ^This is the
A44  36 lowest figure of any year since 1949 and compares favourably with the
A44  37 year 1953, when the percentage of over-sized classes was 43.2.
A44  38    |^It is noteworthy that the percentage of classes with between 30
A44  39 and 40 on roll rises steadily and now comprises 38.0 of all primary
A44  40 school classes. ^There is also a continued rise in the percentage of
A44  41 classes with under 30 on roll. ^In 1953 the percentage of these was
A44  42 27.7, but at present it is 38.4. ^The percentage of classes with under
A44  43 40 on roll grew from the figure of 56.8 in 1953 to 76.4 in 1960.
A44  44 *<*6MORE AT GRAMMAR SCHOOLS*>
A44  45    |^*0On the secondary side, the number of grammar school pupils will
A44  46 increase from 20,163 at present to 21,482 in 1961. ^The increase is
A44  47 1,319 pupils, which is the equivalent of two new grammar schools at
A44  48 over 600 pupils each.
A44  49    |^The number of secondary modern school pupils will remain at the
A44  50 high level of approximately 33,000. ^This is due partly to the
A44  51 *"bulge**" which continues to pass through the secondary schools, but
A44  52 also, as in the case of primary schools, to the migration of
A44  53 population into the County and to the increasing number of pupils who
A44  54 are staying at secondary modern schools beyond the normal
A44  55 school-leaving age and in sixth-forms at grammar schools.
A44  56 *<*6AN ACHIEVEMENT*>
A44  57    |^*0It is interesting to note that in a period when the County is
A44  58 faced with such large increases of primary and secondary school
A44  59 pupils, it has been possible to complete the replacement of All-age
A44  60 schools by new secondary schools, and to build new grammar schools, so
A44  61 that appropriate secondary education is available throughout the
A44  62 County for all pupils according to their age, ability and aptitude.
A44  63    |^This in itself is a noteworthy achievement in a county with such
A44  64 a wide variety of conditions*- rural and urban, agricultural and
A44  65 industrial, and residential.
A44  66    |^Also it should be noted that as well as the building of new
A44  67 grammar and secondary modern schools, good progress is being made with
A44  68 the improvement of facilities in existing grammar and secondary modern
A44  69 schools.
A44  70    |^In further education, provision is being made for new and
A44  71 improved technical colleges. ^Major extensions are now in course of
A44  72 construction at the Carlett Park (Eastham), and Mid-Cheshire
A44  73 (Hartford) Central Colleges of Further Education at a cost of
A44  74 *+465,000 and *+300,000 respectively.
A44  75 *<*6EXTENSIONS*>
A44  76    |^*0Work is due to begin in February on a *+260,000 extension at
A44  77 the North Cheshire College at Sale. ^Planning permission has just been
A44  78 received for the building of a Technical College at Hyde, and the
A44  79 estimated cost of this will be *+398,500, and a new College of Further
A44  80 Education at Crewe costing *+600,000 is to be built by the Cheshire
A44  81 Authority in 1961/62.
A44  82    |^There is also a steady growth in the number of students at
A44  83 universities and technical colleges. ^In the past five years there has
A44  84 been an increase of nearly 20 per \0cent. in the number of students
A44  85 attending Cheshire Technical Colleges, and this increase will continue
A44  86 over the next five years as the new and enlarged colleges come to
A44  87 completion.
A44  88    |^It is interesting to note that, at the present time, the County
A44  89 Education Committee is making grants to 1,565 university students and
A44  90 it is anticipated that there will be approximately 50 additional
A44  91 students receiving grants in 1961/62.
A44  92    |^This is reflected in increased grants to students and increased
A44  93 fees at colleges of further education outside Cheshire which some
A44  94 County students attend. ^In total some 2,940 students are receiving
A44  95 financial aid for their training in Universities, Teachers' Training
A44  96 Colleges, Technical Colleges and Schools of Art and Music.
A44  97    |^In conclusion it should be pointed out that, based on the net
A44  98 rate and grant-borne expenditure per thousand population, Cheshire's
A44  99 expenditure for all branches of education service (including primary,
A44 100 secondary and special schools, further education, the training of
A44 101 teachers, medical inspection and treatment, provision of milk and
A44 102 meals, the transport of pupils and agricultural education) is *+12,893
A44 103 as opposed to the average of all counties in England and Wales of
A44 104 *+13,220.
A44 105 *<*6A-I THEME FOR ROYALTY PLAY*>
A44 106    |^*"F*2ORBIDDEN FLESH,**" *0the controversial play at the Royalty
A44 107 Theatre next week, is by punch-packing author Eugene Hamilton. ^His
A44 108 previous play, *"A Girl Called Sadie,**" packed the Royalty on visits
A44 109 by two different touring companies.
A44 110    |^His new play deals with the question of artificial insemination.
A44 111 ^The author raises the query as to whether a father will feel the same
A44 112 towards a child obtained by these means as to one normally conceived.
A44 113    |^His leading character finds himself about to become a father to
A44 114 two different children, one through artificial insemination. ^On the
A44 115 one hand is the wife trying to tie him down to a secure suburban
A44 116 marriage, and on the other is Eily, the wild Irish girl played with
A44 117 flashing eyes and a tongue like a whip-lash by dark-haired Sarah
A44 118 Travis, who is herself Irish.
A44 119    |^Two points of interest to Cestrians. ^The play is set in
A44 120 Liverpool, where it takes place in the Irish quarter. ^And when it was
A44 121 first performed in Manchester, the Lord Mayor, who was invited to the
A44 122 premiere, made national news headlines by refusing to allow his
A44 123 18-years-old daughter to attend.
A44 124    |^The play has since been banned in Eire because of its outspoken
A44 125 nature, although it has done capacity business in all the principal
A44 126 cities and towns of England, especially those with large Irish
A44 127 populations. ^At Chester it will be presented for adults only.
A44 128 *<*7IT IS EASY TO KEEP UP WITH THE JONES'S IN SWEDEN'S THINGWALL*>
A44 129 *<*6*"NEWS *4and Advertiser**" reader \0Mr. \0H. Arnold, who received
A44 130 his *"News and Advertiser**" *"Spirit of Wirral**" Calendar in
A44 131 Karlstad, Sweden, has written this article.*>
A44 132    |^T*2URNING *0over the *"Spirit of Wirral**" calendar I see that
A44 133 the February picture is of Thingwall whose Viking name was Tingralla.
A44 134 ^It is snowbound. ^I am writing this from another place once named
A44 135 Tingralla*- there are others in Europe*- which is also snowbound, but
A44 136 here the comparison stops.
A44 137    |^In 1584 King Charles the Ninth gave it a charter as a borough,
A44 138 after which it changed its name to Karlstad (Charlestown). ^It became
A44 139 the seat of a bishop. ^Like many other Swedish towns of wooden
A44 140 buildings huddled together, it was burnt down.
A44 141    |^It has since been re-planned with wide streets and boulevards,
A44 142 and more fire-resisting buildings. ^It has important industries based
A44 143 on the forests (timber, pulp and paper) and is a celebrated centre for
A44 144 engineering.
A44 145 *<*6SEABORNE TRADE*>
A44 146    |^*0Excepting for about two months in each year commencing about
A44 147 now it has a seaborne trade through Lake Varen and the Trollhattan
A44 148 Canal. ^Ice put a stop to navigation last week, and traffic has to be
A44 149 routed by rail or road to and from ice-free ports such as Gottenburg,
A44 150 until the oncoming of spring.
A44 151    |^Although there are papers in neighbouring towns not more than
A44 152 forty miles away, Karlstad, with a population of 40,000, supports two
A44 153 morning daily papers, one Conservative, the other Socialist.
A44 154    |^They are by no means solely *'provincial**'. ^For example,
A44 155 yesterday's Conservative paper discusses in its leading article the
A44 156 effect of the Common Market on Swedish agriculture, mentioning several
A44 157 times the views of \0Mr. Woolley, the Cheshire farmer who is now
A44 158 chairman of the National Farmers' Union.
A44 159    |^There is a good deal of interest in the advertising columns.
A44 160    |^A fortnight ago there were many *'Acknowledgements**' under which
A44 161 one-inch single column entries were inserted by individual postmen and
A44 162 lorry drivers collecting milk for the creameries thanking publicly all
A44 163 those who had given them Christmas boxes.
A44 164    |^Dog taxes became due on January 1st. ^The amount is fixed by
A44 165 local authorities and varies from place to place. ^Hereabouts the
A44 166 standard seems to be the equal of 55\0s. per dog over three months
A44 167 old. ^Official advertisements remind dog-owners that the charge will
A44 168 be doubled if it is not met by January 31st.
A44 169    |^Other authorities offer rewards for the extermination of pests*-
A44 170 27\0s. 6\0d. for a fox and 55\0s. for a mink. ^These animals are very
A44 171 destructive to poultry. ^Escapees from fur farms, they find abundant
A44 172 shelter in the forests.
A44 173 *<*6REFUSE IN BAGS*>
A44 174    |^*0There is no mystery about Council, health, water, fishery or
A44 175 other authorities' proceedings. ^The agenda for forthcoming meetings
A44 176 appear as paid advertisements.
A44 177    |^Yesterday the Council of a small local town gave notice in a
A44 178 six-inch column advertisement that household rubbish must in future be
A44 179 put into paper bags before being put into the garbage bins. ^It
A44 180 claimed that in summer this would reduce the stench of decaying matter
A44 181 and in winter would lighten and speed up the work of dustmen as they
A44 182 would not have to dig frozen refuse from inside the bins.
A44 183    |^In more than one town the collected refuse is burnt under boilers
A44 184 which supply hot water to houses, thus cutting out the need for
A44 185 individual heating plants.
A44 186 *<*6TAX REGISTERS*>
A44 187    |^*0Folk interested in public affairs can learn a lot in Sweden.
A44 188 ^They can even learn that newsagents and booksellers sell annuals
A44 189 (called taxation registers) wherein everybody's assessable income
A44 190 within the area of the authority is shown.
A44 191    |^It may be difficult for people in Britain to know if they are
A44 192 keeping up with the Jones's. ^In Sweden they have only to look into
A44 193 the local taxation register to know whether or not they are keeping up
A44 194 with the Svenssons (Swedish Jones's).
A44 195 *<*4From Dee to Dublin was so difficult*>
A44 196    |^O*2NE *0of the most interesting features of local history is the
A44 197 way in which Wirral's Deeside villages came to be regarded over the
A44 198 centuries, as the main ports for the Irish trade, not only locally,
A44 199 but for England. ^The only rival was Holyhead, but many travellers
A44 200 preferred the longer sea voyage to the difficult travel in reaching
A44 201 the Anglesey port.
A44 202    |^Except for the fact that Chester had been established at the head
A44 203 of the estuary, and when the river silted the Wirral villages were
A44 204 used as ports instead, it is probable that the estuary would never
A44 205 have gained any commerce. ^As a haven, a place for ships to shelter,
A44 206 the Dee shore of the peninsula was as an inhospitable place as it
A44 207 could possibly be.
A44 208    |^Shelter from westerly winds was virtually non-existent, but the
A44 209 worst fault from a shipping point of view was that craft could sail
A44 210 down the channel and so to the open sea only when the wind came from
A44 211 the easterly quarter.
