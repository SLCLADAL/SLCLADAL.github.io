F01   2    |^*0The *"ladders of the mind**" are the *1clues *0which we use to
F01   3 track down items of knowledge which cannot be immediately remembered.
F01   4 ^The *"organisation**" and the *"shelves**" will form important topics
F01   5 in our later discussion. ^The work that goes on at the bench must also
F01   6 be considered. ^For here the items which go into the store may be
F01   7 taken to pieces and reassembled, and a sketch may be made of their
F01   8 internal construction. ^Both the item and the sketch can then go into
F01   9 the store. ^In the mind it is the stored items which constitute our
F01  10 *1memory *0and it is the stored sketches which constitute our
F01  11 *1understanding. ^*0Thus *1reading for understanding *0means taking
F01  12 items of knowledge to pieces as we read them and seeing how the pieces
F01  13 are connected.
F01  14    |^A book is arranged to start at the beginning of the first chapter
F01  15 and to finish at the end of the last chapter. ^This seems natural
F01  16 enough but in fact it is purely an arrangement to suit authors,
F01  17 printers and booksellers. ^It does not at all correspond to the needs
F01  18 of the reader's mind. ^For a piece of *1understood knowledge *0is not
F01  19 a mere succession of ideas. ^It is a pattern of connected ideas. ^Some
F01  20 of the ideas in a book, though connected, may occur on pages which are
F01  21 widely separated. ^If books were designed to meet the needs of the
F01  22 reader they would be printed on one side of the paper only and not
F01  23 bound. ^They would be loose-leaf books. ^And the reader should have a
F01  24 large table on which he could spread out the leaves and *1see *0the
F01  25 connections of meaning. ^Of course there are many practical objections
F01  26 to such a method of printing but we must ask how can the reader
F01  27 overcome the handicaps which the present design of books imposes on
F01  28 him?
F01  29    |^This leads us to consider the reader's job. ^My main object in
F01  30 this book is to show the solitary student what his job is. ^For in
F01  31 order to become an effective reader you have to learn how to learn, to
F01  32 learn how to remember and to learn how to know. ^This is not a passive
F01  33 process but a real job of work. ^For the serious student it can be a
F01  34 very satisfying job and can take him a long way in navigating the seas
F01  35 of knowledge.
F01  36    |^To each of these three processes, learning, remembering, and
F01  37 knowing, there are four possible approaches. ^These are:
F01  38    |(1) the philosopher's approach
F01  39    |(2) the psychologist's approach
F01  40    |(3) the teacher's approach
F01  41    |(4) the learner's approach
F01  42    |^The solitary learner should aim at mastering all four approaches.
F01  43 ^He must be his own philosopher, his own psychologist and his own
F01  44 teacher.
F01  45    |^As a philosopher he will want to know the meanings of these
F01  46 important words *1learning, remembering *0and *1knowing, *0or rather
F01  47 to decide what meanings they are to have for him. ^For they have many
F01  48 meanings. ^He needs to clarify them, to see their relations one to
F01  49 another and also to his objective.
F01  50    |^As a psychologist he needs to observe himself at work (and others
F01  51 too if possible) and to find out what sort of processes are going on
F01  52 when he is coming to grips with new knowledge. ^It is a very variable
F01  53 process and he needs to grasp the nature of the variables which
F01  54 control his efficiency as a learner. ^He may discover that many of his
F01  55 assumptions and preconceptions about the nature of learning are
F01  56 unsound. ^He must become a critic of his own methods and an
F01  57 experimenter in the discovery of better methods. ^He cannot expect the
F01  58 professional psychologist to tell him what is best *1for him *0because
F01  59 every individual is different. ^The psychologist can tell him what the
F01  60 variables are but not how they combine in his particular case.
F01  61    |^As a teacher he is, of course, in an anomalous position. ^The
F01  62 ordinary teacher is teaching what he knows. ^The self-teacher would
F01  63 seem to be a contradiction. ^But the contradiction is more apparent
F01  64 than real. ^It rests on the mistaken notion that the teacher has
F01  65 something which he is passing on to the learner. ^This is only
F01  66 superficially true. ^The learner is not a passive recipient. ^He
F01  67 already has a certain store of knowledge and a certain vocabulary.
F01  68 ^The job of the teacher is to set the learner's vocabulary to work on
F01  69 the existing store so as to make it grow. ^He does not simply pack new
F01  70 things into the store. ^The solitary learner has to find out how to do
F01  71 this for himself, with the help of books. ^He uses his vocabulary to
F01  72 ask questions and uses the books to find the answers.
F01  73    |^Thus learning how to learn means becoming your own philosopher,
F01  74 your own psychologist and your own teacher. ^You will then be a
F01  75 well-established learner and the world will be at your feet.
F01  76 *<*7ONE*>
F01  77 *<THE MIND*>
F01  78    |^*0Although the word *"mind**" has given rise to endless
F01  79 controversy among philosophers and psychologists, many of whom would
F01  80 like to abolish it from the dictionary, most of us obstinately go on
F01  81 using it. ^It is short and familiar and its many meanings can be
F01  82 otherwise expressed only by cumbersome and abstract terms which then
F01  83 introduce new difficulties. ^But it is advisable, in any particular
F01  84 context, to narrow down its meaning so as to avoid confusion.
F01  85    |^*"Mind**" has often been contrasted with *"matter**" in such a
F01  86 way as to suggest that the two are somehow opposed and incompatible.
F01  87 ^And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of *"mind**"
F01  88 vanishes, at any rate for some time. ^It seems very difficult to
F01  89 detach the mind from the brain, and all the biological, surgical and
F01  90 pharmacological evidence points to a very close connection. ^There is
F01  91 a lot to be said for keeping the word *"soul**" to stand for what many
F01  92 believe to be the imperishable essence of a man which is supposed to
F01  93 persist apart from the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word
F01  94 *"mind**" for the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
F01  95 are clearly associated with the brain.
F01  96    |^Can we now put forward any reasonably clear picture of this
F01  97 *"basis**" of mental phenomena? ^The physicists have succeeded
F01  98 remarkably well, with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and
F01  99 detailed picture of the basis of such material phenomena as chemical
F01 100 action, magnetism, the behaviour of gases and so on. ^Where has
F01 101 psychology got to in its theories of *"mind**"? ^Are there any
F01 102 ultimate units of mind akin to the atoms of matter?
F01 103    |^At one time it was thought that mind could indeed be analysed
F01 104 into discrete bits. ^These bits were identified as elementary
F01 105 sensations. ^These were thought to combine together to form compound
F01 106 experiences by analogy with the way atoms of matter combine to form
F01 107 molecular compounds. ^But this view led to too many difficulties and
F01 108 was finally abandoned. ^Nevertheless the search for basic units of
F01 109 mind has gone on and will doubtless continue, for it is the aim of
F01 110 science to discover ultimate units. ^We must beware, however, of
F01 111 supposing that there must be any close analogy between the units of
F01 112 quite different sciences. ^For example the success of the atomic
F01 113 theory in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate units of
F01 114 geometry must be *1points. ^*0It would be more correct to regard
F01 115 *1operations *0as the ultimate units of geometry.
F01 116    |^There have been many conflicting tendencies in psychology in its
F01 117 search for ultimate units and here we can only indicate what seems to
F01 118 be the most promising concept which is current today. ^It is known as
F01 119 the *1schema. ^*0It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
F01 120 concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification but even so it
F01 121 may be better than a meaningless abstraction. ^The following
F01 122 conversation between Hamlet and Polonius shows that Shakespeare had at
F01 123 any rate an intuitive grasp of the notion:
F01 124 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F01 125 |^*1Hamlet: ^*0Do you see \1yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a
F01 126 camel?
F01 127    |^*1Polonius: ^*0By the mass, and \1'tis like a camel, indeed.
F01 128    |^*1Hamlet: ^*0\1Methinks, it is like a weasel.
F01 129    |^*1Polonius: ^*0It is backed like a weasel.
F01 130    |^*1Hamlet: ^*0Or like a whale?
F01 131    |^*1Polonius: ^*0Very like a whale.
F01 132 **[END QUOTE**]
F01 133    |^Now the whale, the camel \0etc., were not in the sky. ^The clouds
F01 134 are mere aggregates of water-drops. ^The whale, \0etc., were in the
F01 135 minds of Hamlet and Polonius. ^But they could both *1see *0the cloud.
F01 136 ^Thus an image of the cloud was also in their minds. ^Moreover they
F01 137 knew it to be a cloud. ^Yet they could *"see**" animals in it. ^This
F01 138 is the important fact about mental phenomena. ^The physical cloud in
F01 139 the sky is just itself, made of water-drops. ^The mental cloud is a
F01 140 multiplicity. ^To begin with it is a pattern of brain-processes, just
F01 141 as physical as the water-drops. ^But it is experienced (**=1) as a
F01 142 cloud, (**=2) as a whale, (**=3) as a camel and so on. ^We cannot
F01 143 dismiss these as *"illusions**" for it is just the occurrence of such
F01 144 illusions that we seek to explain*- besides why is it illusory to see
F01 145 the thing as a whale but not illusory to see it as a cloud? ^And how
F01 146 did Hamlet *1know *0it was *"really**" a cloud?
F01 147    |^For the moment we need not concern ourselves with these last
F01 148 questions. ^What we have to grasp is that there are patterns of
F01 149 brain-activity of different kinds. ^There are patterns which result
F01 150 directly from processes such as seeing, hearing, \0etc., {0e.g.}
F01 151 that which is experienced as the shape of the cloud (but not yet
F01 152 identified as such). ^And there are patterns which result in
F01 153 *1interpretations *0such as *"cloud**", *"whale**", *"camel**", \0etc.
F01 154 ^The image is fairly steady and durable. ^The interpretations can
F01 155 shift very rapidly. ^These interpretations are called *"schemas**" (or
F01 156 more pedantically *"schemata**").
F01 157    |^At one time *"mind**" used to be identified with
F01 158 *"consciousness**". ^But *"consciousness**" simply refers to the
F01 159 stream of changing experiences. ^It will simplify our explanations if
F01 160 we regard consciousness as a *1property *0of mind rather than as mind
F01 161 itself. ^If we define *"mind**" as the totality of schemas in a single
F01 162 brain and regard *"consciousness**" as a certain transitory state
F01 163 which any schema, or group of schemas, can assume, we can give a more
F01 164 consistent account of our experiences and interpretations.
F01 165    |^Before going further we should try to face what is an almost
F01 166 inevitable difficulty for anyone approaching the study of mind for the
F01 167 first time. ^It is the tendency to get things the wrong way round. ^As
F01 168 a psychologist I am constantly encountering this tendency in friends
F01 169 and acquaintances. ^They think there is something inevitably
F01 170 *"queer**" about psychology and this feeling of queerness usually
F01 171 boils down to a quite mistaken belief that the psychologist first
F01 172 looks into his own mind and then interprets other people's minds by
F01 173 what he has found in his own. ^This is what I mean by *"getting things
F01 174 the wrong way round**". ^He is far more likely to find out about how
F01 175 his own mind works by looking at other people's. ^For although looking
F01 176 inwards (or *"introspecting**" as it is called), is not entirely ruled
F01 177 out, nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is one of the
F01 178 most unreliable methods of getting any precise information. ^And so
F01 179 they prefer objective methods. ^Since they cannot directly look into
F01 180 the mental processes of another person they observe his visible
F01 181 behaviour and then try to give theoretical interpretations of what
F01 182 lies behind this behaviour. ^This is no more queer than the method of
F01 183 the doctor who observes signs, and records symptoms, and diagnoses the
F01 184 inner states responsible for them. ^He may never have had the disease
F01 185 himself but he can nevertheless identify it. ^Similarly the
F01 186 psychologist has to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
F01 187 all kinds of processes in other people, whether or not they correspond
F01 188 with anything in his own experience.
F01 189    |^We know very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
F01 190 provide our schemas, nor do we need to know as far as psychology is
F01 191 concerned*- these patterns are the concern of the neuro-physiologists.

F02   2 ^The numerically largest group, consisting of male weekly wage-earners
F02   3 up to chargehand level and in the works only, excluding the offices,
F02   4 was therefore selected. ^A detailed age-structure was compiled from
F02   5 personnel department records, revealing that there were (at that time)
F02   6 seventeen men seventy years of age or older, thirty-three aged
F02   7 sixty-four years, and sixty-five just fifty years of age. ^A small
F02   8 panel was formed, not on a formally representative basis but rather of
F02   9 energetic and concerned individuals, from various levels in the firm.
F02  10 ^In due course the panel decided to seek further insight into the
F02  11 problems faced by older workers, and approached those seventy years of
F02  12 age or older. ^Interviews with about half these men quickly convinced
F02  13 the panel that any approach at sixty-four*- which had been considered
F02  14 as a possible interim stage in the project*- was unlikely to be
F02  15 profitable, and a decision was taken to plan a scheme of preparation
F02  16 for retirement suitable for men who had just reached the age of fifty.
F02  17    |^All this took much longer than most people had expected, and it
F02  18 must be taken for granted by anyone wishing to plan and launch schemes
F02  19 of this kind in large industrial undertakings that undue haste will
F02  20 but court disaster. ^In June, 1958, after careful preliminary work
F02  21 explaining the task of the panel to departmental managers, supervisors
F02  22 and shop stewards, an individual invitation was sent to each of the
F02  23 seventy-three men who reached the age of fifty years in 1958.
F02  24 ^Following the interviews to which reference has already been made, a
F02  25 meeting took place at which those attending were told more fully about
F02  26 the proposed course and were given the general results of the
F02  27 interviews in which they had taken part. ^Thirty-three of the
F02  28 forty-four men interviewed attended this meeting, and twenty-nine
F02  29 signed-on **[SIC**] for the first course.
F02  30    |^This was planned by the writer in co-operation with the panel and
F02  31 in consultation with \0Mr. {0R. P. B.} Davies, then West Midlands
F02  32 District Secretary of the Workers Educational Association, and
F02  33 naturally owes much to the American schemes described earlier. ^It
F02  34 differs principally in being shorter (six sessions plus a short
F02  35 weekend gathering to which wives are invited); in using the services
F02  36 of experienced tutors in adult education as discussion group leaders;
F02  37 and in having available at the relevant meeting expert
F02  38 *'consultants**' for physical health, mental health and financial
F02  39 planning.
F02  40    |^The Rubery, Owen scheme is now in its fourth year, and
F02  41 opportunity has been taken to revise the course in the light of
F02  42 experience. ^Topics for the six weekly meetings of one-and-a-half
F02  43 hours (each held half in company time, half in the man's time) are now
F02  44 as follows:
F02  45    |1. Personal adjustment
F02  46    |2. Health
F02  47    |3. Work and leisure
F02  48    |4. Living arrangements
F02  49    |5. Financial planning
F02  50    |6. Final discussion
F02  51    |^The weekend conference for the men and their wives, which takes
F02  52 place at company expense in a country or resort hotel, includes an
F02  53 address on *'The Woman's Point of View**' and one on *'Making the Most
F02  54 of Health**'. ^Separate discussions are arranged for the wives in
F02  55 addition to the plenary sessions.
F02  56    |^Of the men reaching fifty years of age since the scheme started,
F02  57 125 (37.2 per cent) have taken part. ^No pressure of any kind is
F02  58 brought to bear on those who decline the invitation. ^One result of
F02  59 the first course was the formation by the men themselves of the
F02  60 *'Half-century Club**', membership of which is open to any man in the
F02  61 company fifty years of age or older (and their wives) whether he has
F02  62 passed through the scheme or not. ^At the end of the second course, a
F02  63 request was received from members of the salaried staff that they
F02  64 should be included in the scheme, and this was gladly agreed to. ^The
F02  65 third course produced a request by the men for an evening class in
F02  66 home repairs and decorating, and this was arranged at a local Evening
F02  67 Institute.
F02  68    |^The original scheme was planned to provide short refresher
F02  69 courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty: the first of these is due
F02  70 in 1963. ^Meanwhile, each *'graduate**' is encouraged to seek help and
F02  71 advice in working out his ideas, either through the company's
F02  72 personnel department or by an approach to members of the panel
F02  73 responsible for the scheme. ^The latter do not regard themselves as
F02  74 expert advisers, but are prepared to seek out the appropriate sources
F02  75 of information or advice.
F02  76 *<*1The Glasgow Day Release Scheme*>
F02  77    |^*0Towards the end of 1956, \0Mr. Daniel Grant, an Employee
F02  78 Relations Officer of Rolls-Royce \0Ltd. and a member of the Workers'
F02  79 Educational Association, submitted to the Lord Provost of Glasgow,
F02  80 \0Dr. Andrew Hood, a copy of his report on an enquiry he had made into
F02  81 the problems that beset older workers and the effects of retirement
F02  82 upon them. ^The Lord Provost, having studied the report on *'The
F02  83 Morale and Health of Retired Workers**', and being satisfied that the
F02  84 matters raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
F02  85 Glasgow and warranted further study, set an informal committee
F02  86 representative of bodies particularly concerned with the welfare of
F02  87 older people to examine the report and its implications and to
F02  88 consider the advisability of arranging a Conference on Preparation for
F02  89 and Occupational Activities on Retirement.
F02  90    |^The large attendance and atmosphere of this Conference, held in
F02  91 October, 1957, reflected not only an increasing awareness of the
F02  92 problems of men and women nearing or already in retirement but also a
F02  93 strong desire on the part of all concerned for concerted action
F02  94 towards preparing men and women for life in retirement and more
F02  95 adequate provision of facilities for crafts, hobbies and leisure-time
F02  96 interests for those who are retired. ^As a result, the Glasgow
F02  97 Retirement Council came into being in April, 1958, with \0Dr. Andrew
F02  98 Hood as chairman and \0Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary. ^The Council
F02  99 has active committees on Education and Preparation for Retirement, and
F02 100 on Occupational Centres. ^The former consists of representatives from
F02 101 the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department; the Workers'
F02 102 Educational Association; the University Extra-Mural Education
F02 103 Committee and departments of psychology, education and social science;
F02 104 the trades unions; and the Regional Hospital Board, together with an
F02 105 industrial medical officer and a Medical Officer of Health.
F02 106    |^In 1959 it was suggested by \0Mr. {0T. M.} Banks, Assistant
F02 107 Director of Education for Glasgow, that industrial firms might be
F02 108 ready to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
F02 109 for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus spent. ^An approach
F02 110 was made to about twenty large firms and in October, 1959, the first
F02 111 experimental day-release course for men was organised. ^Eleven
F02 112 students from seven firms attended a course on six full Fridays and it
F02 113 was made clear both to the men and their employers that the venture
F02 114 was an experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much as
F02 115 the participants. ^Alterations are continually being made in the light
F02 116 of experience and the seventh course is still described as
F02 117 *'experimental**'.
F02 118    |^These courses take place at Langside College in a house, separate
F02 119 from the main building, which has a comfortable classroom and two good
F02 120 upstairs lounges. ^Each course starts with an informal evening meeting
F02 121 when the men, drawn from different firms, can get to know something of
F02 122 one another and of the tutors before the opening session on the
F02 123 morning of the first of the seven consecutive full-day Friday
F02 124 meetings.
F02 125    |^Forenoon sessions are from 9.30 {0a.m.} to 12.45 {0p.m.} with
F02 126 a coffee-break at 11 {0a.m.}. ^Lunch is provided at a charge of
F02 127 2\0s. 4\0d. ^Afternoon sessions last from 1.50 to 5 {0p.m.}, with an
F02 128 afternoon tea-break of 15 minutes at 3 {0p.m.} ^The programme is as
F02 129 follows:
F02 130 **[TABLE**]
F02 131    |^Tutors*- most of them members of the Glasgow Retirement Council*-
F02 132 give their services voluntarily. ^Ninety-five men from twenty-one
F02 133 firms have so far taken part; there is no doubt that the men enjoy the
F02 134 courses and are most appreciative of them. ^They learn much,
F02 135 factually, about the problems of retirement and provision for old age,
F02 136 and, psychologically, in the sharing of their thoughts on retirement.
F02 137 ^They express themselves as feeling better equipped to confront and
F02 138 plan for their retirement and, if some are still pessimistic regarding
F02 139 the future, it is with an *'informed pessimism**'. ^They are unanimous
F02 140 in their expressed concern that many others working beside them at the
F02 141 same stage in their careers should be given opportunity to benefit
F02 142 similarly from further courses which they strongly recommend should be
F02 143 arranged by the Council.
F02 144    |^The Glasgow courses described above have been for men only. ^But
F02 145 seven women of the staff and supervisory grade from six firms have
F02 146 this year (1961) taken part in an experimental Day-Release Course for
F02 147 Women arranged by the Council at Langside College of a duration and
F02 148 along lines similar to the above. ^Morning sessions were unaltered but
F02 149 afternoon subjects included *'Do-it-Yourself**', Home-craft, Home
F02 150 Cookery, and details of women's organisations, providing opportunities
F02 151 for voluntary social service, in place of crafts, hobbies, art, drama
F02 152 and music.
F02 153 *<*1The City Literary Institute*>
F02 154    |^*0On the initiative of the Principal, \0Mr. {0H. A.} Jones,
F02 155 this well-known London County Council Institute has recently started
F02 156 to offer day-release courses in preparation for retirement, following
F02 157 an encouraging experiment with members of the Unilever Pensioners
F02 158 Welfare Organisation. ^Several London firms have co-operated by
F02 159 releasing men and women aged fifty-five and over, both staff and
F02 160 hourly-paid workers.
F02 161 *<*2DIFFERENT COURSES FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE*>
F02 162    |^*0When describing the Michigan, Chicago and recent British
F02 163 approaches to the problem of preparing employed men and women for
F02 164 their eventual retirement, some reference has in each case been made
F02 165 to the social, educational or intellectual status of those for whom
F02 166 each scheme is designed. ^Although it seems reasonable to assume that
F02 167 the problems of retirement, and the ways in which these can largely be
F02 168 solved in advance, will differ in terms of such variables, very little
F02 169 is known on the matter.
F02 170    |^One useful attempt to remedy this important gap in our knowledge
F02 171 was made by Burgess and his colleagues in Chicago. ^They sought
F02 172 answers to three questions:
F02 173    |^1. Are there differences in adjustment to ageing and retirement
F02 174 according to the occupational level of employees?
F02 175    |^2. If so, which occupational levels are the better or the poorer
F02 176 prepared for successful adjustment to retirement and in what aspects?
F02 177    |^3. Does the evidence obtained support a rationale for adapting a
F02 178 pre-retirement planning and preparation programme to the needs of
F02 179 older employees of different occupational levels?
F02 180    |^Three hundred older employees of the Standard Oil Company of
F02 181 Indiana provided answers to a *'Retirement Planning Inventory**'
F02 182 containing 100 items*- statements with which the person responding is
F02 183 asked to indicate his agreement or disagreement, designed by Burgess
F02 184 and Mack. ^These items in fact comprise twelve groups, eight
F02 185 consisting of ten items each, all dealing with retirement planning and
F02 186 preparation, and a further two of ten items each, both dealing with
F02 187 more general personal adjustment. ^In addition, there are four
F02 188 *'category scores**' which combine the same 100 items in a different
F02 189 way, providing more broadly-based areas for assessment. ^The 300
F02 190 employees comprised twenty-four managers, eighty-four supervisory and
F02 191 professional/ technical staff, and 184 manual workers of all grades.
F02 192    |^Burgess found that in general *'the higher the group's
F02 193 occupational status, the greater is its (apparent) adjustment to (the
F02 194 prospect of) ageing and retirement**'. ^(It is probably desirable to
F02 195 insert the words in parenthesis, having regard to the limitations of
F02 196 the questionnaire method of enquiry.) ^The investigators go on to
F02 197 suggest, from detailed analysis of the responses obtained, that *'the
F02 198 problem for the manual worker does not centre on his *1conception *0of
F02 199 old age, but rather on how he interprets its meaning for his own
F02 200 future life**'. ^This conclusion is based on differences between the
F02 201 manual workers group and the other two groups in categories of
F02 202 questions covering *'Later Maturity**' and *'Retirement Attitudes**',
F02 203 and in the broadly-based area of *'Social Adjustment**'.
F02 204    |^Burgess and his colleagues therefore advise retirement planning
F02 205 programmes *'to divide into at least two separate units: one to treat
F02 206 the needs of the non-manual upper-level occupational groups who, on
F02 207 the whole, seem well-adjusted to old-age but require a medium through
F02 208 which to reinterpret and assimilate their knowledge and attitudes; and
F02 209 another for the manual lower-level occupational status who, although
F02 210 conceiving of retirement in an appropriate manner, cannot find within
F02 211 the boundaries of old age the promise of a meaningful and well-rounded
F02 212 life**'.

F03   2    |^*0A simple enough question. ^But every one of the passengers who
F03   3 heard it turned to see who asked it. ^The girl's voice was charming.
F03   4 ^And so was the girl herself. ^But you often find that an attractive
F03   5 voice and an attractive appearance go together. ^Their owner probably
F03   6 takes pains with both!
F03   7    |^People generally are responsive to voices. ^One voice will give
F03   8 you pleasure, and another will give you a headache. ^Listen to Mollie.
F03   9 ^That girl could charm the bird from the bush. ^But Ethel's flat voice
F03  10 has as much charm as a codfish!
F03  11    |^No wonder that employers advertising for a secretary often state:
F03  12 ^*1Good speaking voice.
F03  13 *<*4Listen And Learn*>
F03  14    |^*0Listen to voices and you will learn how to improve your own.
F03  15 ^Variations in pitch and speed, changes in expression, a warm quality
F03  16 in the voice itself, clear enunciation*- those can help you to that
F03  17 good speaking voice.
F03  18    |^And you will notice, too, that pleasant voices usually belong to
F03  19 pleasant people. ^Is there a moral there for *6YOU?
F03  20    |^*0Incidentally, it's easy to forget a face. ^*1But a voice once
F03  21 heard is never forgotten.
F03  22 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03  23    |^*0A cynic has said that a good conversationalist is one *1who
F03  24 talks to you about yourself. ^*0And there is enough truth in that to
F03  25 set you thinking.
F03  26    |^Keep an ear open for snatches of talk you hear during the day.
F03  27 ^*6WHAT I SAID *0and *6WHAT I DID *0are very popular subjects. ^*1But
F03  28 they make poor conversation!
F03  29    |^*0Sometimes you *1do *0meet some one who says little himself.
F03  30 ^But he seems willing to listen a lot. ^Be cautious*- there's an old
F03  31 adage which tells you to beware of the man who lets *6YOU *0do all the
F03  32 talking!
F03  33 *<*4So what!*>
F03  34    |^*0Just this. ^*1A good conversationalist talks neither too much
F03  35 nor too little. ^*0He has the knack of putting things in an
F03  36 interesting way. ^But more than that, he stimulates *6YOU *0to
F03  37 contribute to the conversation too. ^And he can set a whole group
F03  38 talking.
F03  39    |^No wonder such a talker is always welcome! ^Conversation is still
F03  40 a popular form of entertainment. ^And one in which we all can share.
F03  41 ^You can help yourself to play your part in good conversation, either
F03  42 with strangers or in your own circle. ^*4And it will do wonders for
F03  43 you!
F03  44 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03  45    |^*0You think the man opposite would like to chat. ^And so would
F03  46 you. ^All right! ^Seize your opportunity when he looks up from his
F03  47 book. ^What will you say?
F03  48    |^As you have never seen him before, you can't very well open with,
F03  49 ~*"My wife has toothache!**"*- or something of that sort.
F03  50    |^The usual opening, and you can't better it, is to remark on the
F03  51 weather. ^And why not? ^The weather is of interest to everybody. ^And
F03  52 he will understand you are just sticking to the rules.
F03  53    |^He will do the same. ^If he doesn't want to talk, a quick smile
F03  54 and a brief, ~*"Horrid!**"*- and he returns to his book. ^But if he
F03  55 likes the look of you he will most likely toss the ball back to you by
F03  56 saying lightly, ~*"Yes*- all the fault of the atom-bomb
F03  57 scientists!**"*- or some such remark. ^And if you come back again
F03  58 with, ~*"Disturbing chaps*- in more ways than one!**" each of you will
F03  59 think the other is talkable-to. ^And away you go.
F03  60    |^*1Good conversation can be wonderful fun. ^*0And a grand
F03  61 shortener of journeys. ^Useful, too! ^One {0*2V.I.P.} *0has said
F03  62 that he learns more from conversation than from all the books he has
F03  63 read.
F03  64    |^*4At least you learn something about human nature.
F03  65 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03  66    |^*0We'll say you arrive*- on your own*- at a party, and the
F03  67 hostess leaves you with a group of strangers. ^Two or three of them
F03  68 give you a fleeting smile, but continue to listen to what seems to be
F03  69 a dramatic story by one of the group. ^She is telling of her battle
F03  70 with a play producer, but she hasn't yet reached the point where she
F03  71 laid him out flat!
F03  72    |^Splendid! ^It gives you a breathing-space, and time to get your
F03  73 bearings. ^You are sure to see something of interest to you, something
F03  74 you can talk about. ^It may be a bit of antique furniture, a picture,
F03  75 a tapestry, or even flowers.
F03  76    |^Well, there you are. ^You may*- when the producer has been
F03  77 humbled*- get by by answering questions. ^But unless you are to appear
F03  78 as a tongue-tied ninny, you *1simply must say something original.
F03  79    |^*0For instance, you notice an old writing-desk. ^So you say to
F03  80 your neighbour, ^*"Lovely desk! ^Do you think it's Chippendale?**"
F03  81    |^*4You couldn't do better. ^*0Talk about furniture*- especially
F03  82 antiques*- and most people will want to join in.
F03  83 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03  84    |^Just a bit of chatter about some one else*- but two completely
F03  85 different styles of talking!
F03  86    |^One of the gossips talks with sledgehammer blows. ^She is so sure
F03  87 about things. ^But the other feels her way more gently.
F03  88    |^That sledgehammer style*- if the blows are short and sharp
F03  89 enough*- may suit at a political meeting. ^But conversation wilts
F03  90 under it. ^Try, instead, a more inquiring style*- ^*1Don't you think
F03  91 that ...? *0will encourage the other one to give his views. ^*1Oh,
F03  92 that's nonsense! *0will shut him up, or start an argument. ^And an
F03  93 argument can be poor conversation. ^You find yourself more concerned
F03  94 to prove the other fellow wrong than to encourage him to say what he
F03  95 thinks.
F03  96 *<*4And Don't Be A Know-all*>
F03  97    |^*0There are plenty of people*- both sexes*- who delight in
F03  98 showing their knowledge. ^Maybe it's nice to know more than some one
F03  99 else, but it's a mistake to show it*- if you want good conversation.
F03 100    |^Let the other fellow tell *2YOU *0something*- *1if he wishes to!
F03 101 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03 102    |^*0At some time or other you will speak in public. ^Perhaps you
F03 103 will join in the discussion at a committee meeting, take sides at the
F03 104 debating society, open a local fe*?5te, propose a toast*- or even make
F03 105 a political speech from the platform. ^No matter what the occasion is,
F03 106 *4you will want to make a good job of it.
F03 107    |^*0Here is some advice.
F03 108    |^*4Be Sincere. ^*0If you mean what you say there is a ring in your
F03 109 voice and a force in your speaking which you can get in no other way.
F03 110 ^Believe in what you say*- or say nothing.
F03 111    |^*4Be Natural. ^*0In other words, be yourself. ^Famous orators
F03 112 have their own style. ^You have yours, and by sticking to it you will
F03 113 make a better speech than by imitating some one else. ^But see to it
F03 114 that your own style improves every time you make a speech.
F03 115    |^Those two bits of advice apply whether you speak to a crowd in
F03 116 the Town Hall or to half a dozen in the committee room. ^*1Be sincere.
F03 117 ^Be natural. ^*0People will at least listen to you with respect*- and
F03 118 *1maybe with enjoyment!
F03 119    |^*0And if you make a good speech *1you too will enjoy the thrill
F03 120 of it.
F03 121 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03 122    |^*0She was so beautifully dressed. ^And she looked just right for
F03 123 the job*- to open the bazaar.
F03 124    |^But, oh, dear! ^She unfolded a sheet of paper and proceeded to
F03 125 read her speech*- every word of it. ^Such careful enunciation! ^*1And
F03 126 so terribly lifeless!
F03 127 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03 128    |^*0But here's a speaker of another calibre*- at a mass-protest
F03 129 meeting. ^He, too, looks just right for the job!
F03 130    |^And he is. ^His words pour out with the flow and force of
F03 131 Niagara. ^*1He has the crowd spellbound!
F03 132    |^*0Those two speakers are poles apart. ^Between them come many
F03 133 other speaking-methods. ^*4Which one is yours? ^*0Perhaps you rely on
F03 134 a few notes on a small bit of paper? ^That, at least, is better than
F03 135 reading the whole thing.
F03 136    |^But the secret of a good speech lies in the *4contact between
F03 137 speaker and audience. ^*0Stop to read from a paper, look down at your
F03 138 notes!*- at once you break the spell.
F03 139    |^Yes, it's *'off the cuff**' for a really good speech. ^But that
F03 140 does not mean you need not think about it beforehand. ^Some of the
F03 141 best *'impromptu**' speakers spend hours in preparation. ^So, by all
F03 142 means plan your speech and rehearse it*- see next page. ^Take your
F03 143 notes with you*- if you must! ^But if you can lose them and still
F03 144 speak naturally and easily, why*- *4Good For You! ^*0You are a
F03 145 speaker!
F03 146 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03 147    |^Embarrassed and tongue-tied! ^Poor fellow! ^*4But it need not
F03 148 happen to you*- *1if you plan your speech beforehand.
F03 149    |^*0You are going to make a speech, so presumably you've got
F03 150 something to say. ^It may take you two minutes, it may take you twenty
F03 151 minutes (a long time that!). ^But before you start have it clear in
F03 152 your mind what that message is.
F03 153    |^In writing a letter, you arrange it in paragraphs. ^Do the same
F03 154 with your speech. ^But don't write it down. ^Content yourself with
F03 155 giving a name to each paragraph, and put those names in a list.
F03 156    |^Suppose, for instance, you finally have four names on your list.
F03 157 ^Then you have four sections to your speech. ^Decide then what you
F03 158 want to say in each*- and the best way of saying it*- and then
F03 159 *4rehearse it over and over again. ^*0But don't memorize it word for
F03 160 word. ^All you need do is to remember the four names*- and the order
F03 161 in which they come.
F03 162    |^Each time you rehearse you will probably put things in a
F03 163 different way. ^All the better!*- it will sound much more spontaneous
F03 164 on the occasion itself. ^Remember your four names*- have the list with
F03 165 you if you like*- *4and you simply can't be flummoxed!
F03 166    |^*0Of course, in any speech a good start and a good finish are
F03 167 half the battle. ^So*- see the next page!
F03 168 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03 169    |^Yes, they are waiting for you. ^But there is no need to be
F03 170 frightened. ^The audience will eat out of your hand*- *1if they like
F03 171 what you offer them.
F03 172    |^*0A good start will put them in a good humour.
F03 173    |^*1Ladies and gentlemen! ^I'm afraid I have not had much
F03 174 experience of public speaking. ^*0But that's a terrible way to begin!
F03 175 ^Why tell them you are a novice? ^It's their *4interest *0you want*-
F03 176 not their sympathy. ^And you want to get it from the word *2GO! ^*0Try
F03 177 something like this:
F03 178    |^*1It is said that television keeps people at home. ^But you, at
F03 179 any rate, have proved that wrong. ^And they say, too, that television
F03 180 makes its appeal to those of lesser intelligence. ^May I suggest that
F03 181 you have proved that right! ^Congratulations!
F03 182    |^*0And away you go into your speech.
F03 183    |^Take some thought, too, for your ending.
F03 184    |^*1Thank you for listening to me so patiently. ^*0A political
F03 185 candidate often used that finish. ^No wonder he didn't get in!
F03 186 ^Instead he might have ended this way: ^*1Well, those are my views.
F03 187 ^It's up to you now to give me an opportunity of putting them into
F03 188 practice. ^*0A stronger finish*- and a *4stronger candidate!
F03 189    |^*1Note: ^*0It's a good plan to memorize your beginning and your
F03 190 ending.
F03 191 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
F03 192    |^One speaker predicts that *1unemployment will considerably
F03 193 increase. ^*0But another puts it this way: ^*1Half the working-men in
F03 194 the country will line up at the Labour Exchange.
F03 195    |^*0Six words only*- *1line up at the Labour Exchange*- *0but
F03 196 enough to make vividly clear to you what he has in mind. ^He presents
F03 197 you with a picture, and it flashes in your mind's eye. ^You see what
F03 198 he is talking about.
F03 199    |^The Managing Director is retiring. ^The senior employee makes a
F03 200 presentation and he gives the thing a seagoing setting. ^He calls the
F03 201 Director *1captain, *0refers to him starting as *1cabin-boy, *0keeping
F03 202 the *1ship off the rocks, *0\0etc.
F03 203    |^A sound idea. ^The metaphors give life to the speech.
F03 204    |^*1Simple words and homely phrases *0give the clearest pictures.
F03 205 ^Let some one say: ~*1It's like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut!*-
F03 206 *0and at once you get his meaning. ^But: *1Using a great output of
F03 207 energy for an exiguous purpose *0(it means the same thing!) gives you
F03 208 no picture at all.
F03 209    |^So, in preparing your speech, search for the homely phrase and
F03 210 the simple illustration. ^And then in giving your speech, you in

F04   1 **[147 TEXT F04**]
F04   2 ^*0What looked ominously like a pair of legs was showing under the
F04   3 seat in a second-class compartment. ^His fears were realized when some
F04   4 porters helped him to lift out the body of a woman.
F04   5    |^Still puzzling as to what could have happened to his fiance*?2e,
F04   6 Edward Berry at first watched the growing group of excited railway
F04   7 officials farther up the platform. ^When he learned what was causing
F04   8 the commotion he became greatly alarmed, and after the body had been
F04   9 taken to \0St Thomas's Hospital it was his grief-stricken duty
F04  10 formally to identify Elizabeth Camp, aged thirty-three, the girl who
F04  11 was to have been his bride.
F04  12    |^There was little doubt of how she had met her death, and even
F04  13 less that it had been murder. ^She had been struck several times with
F04  14 a blunt instrument, and her head was smashed in. ^There were signs of
F04  15 a violent struggle, blood on the cushions and floor, and the remains
F04  16 of her broken umbrella. ^But a pair of bone cuff-links found in the
F04  17 compartment seemed to provide the only possible clue to the killer.
F04  18    |^The body was examined, and it was definitely established that no
F04  19 sexual assault had taken place. ^It seemed probable that the motive
F04  20 had been robbery, and this was further confirmed when a check was made
F04  21 with the woman's relations in Hounslow. ^Miss Camp had been the
F04  22 housekeeper at the Good Intent, a public-house in Walworth. ^Her day
F04  23 off was Thursday, and before coming up to London in the evening she
F04  24 had called on her two sisters, one of whom lived at Hammersmith and
F04  25 the other at Hounslow, where she kept a shop.
F04  26    |^Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon, and arrived
F04  27 at Hounslow around 5 {0P.M.}, where she had tea with her other
F04  28 sister, and then went to catch the 7.42. ^Her sister saw her to the
F04  29 station, helping her with some of her packages. ^This sister was able
F04  30 to establish that she had carried a green purse and had bought a
F04  31 railway ticket. ^But both purse and ticket, and the packages, were
F04  32 gone when the body was found at Waterloo. ^Neither the sisters nor
F04  33 \0Mr Berry thought it likely that she had been carrying much money.
F04  34    |^A porter at Hounslow supported the sister's statement that
F04  35 Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her compartment when the train left,
F04  36 but this did not help much, since it had made stops at nine stations
F04  37 before Waterloo.
F04  38    |^The police began a systematic search of the line*- no easy task,
F04  39 but one in which patience and method paid off. ^At a spot on the
F04  40 embankment between Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
F04  41 pestle such as chemists use, with some hairs sticking to it. ^The
F04  42 murder weapon, more than likely, and perhaps evidence enough to have
F04  43 brought a killer to book in modern times. ^But in 1897, alas! there
F04  44 was no fingerprint bureau, no experts to check and photograph any
F04  45 *'dabs**' it might have yielded.
F04  46    |^It was a tough case to tackle, and Superintendent Robinson, of
F04  47 the {0*2L.S.W.R.} *0Police, and Chief Inspector Marshall, of
F04  48 Scotland Yard, combined forces in the investigation. ^While accepting
F04  49 the likelihood that Miss Camp had been attacked for the sake of
F04  50 robbery, they did not overlook the possibility that this might have
F04  51 disguised another motive, and a thorough check of her former men
F04  52 friends and acquaintances began.
F04  53    |^They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours, some well
F04  54 meant, some mischievous, including one that a man had been seen
F04  55 fleeing from Vauxhall station on the Thursday evening, with blood
F04  56 actually dripping from his hands.
F04  57    |^The inquest was opened on February 17, but, beyond the jury
F04  58 hearing a formal identification of the victim and inspecting at
F04  59 Waterloo the carriage in which she had died, there was nothing on
F04  60 which to proceed, and the inquest was adjourned. ^Day by day the
F04  61 police followed up likely and even unlikely trails. ^It was learned
F04  62 that Elizabeth Camp had been lending money to her relatives, and her
F04  63 brother-in-law was asked for a detailed account of his movements on
F04  64 the 11th.
F04  65    |^The dead woman had been engaged once before*- to a barman named
F04  66 Brown. ^This man agreed that his engagement had been broken off after
F04  67 one particular tiff, but denied that he owed Miss Camp any money.
F04  68    |^All the while the police were casting about for a man who had
F04  69 been seen leaving the train at Wandsworth. ^A passenger described this
F04  70 individual as a man of about thirty, of medium height, with a dark
F04  71 moustache, and wearing a frockcoat and a top-hat. ^The porter at the
F04  72 station bore out this description, but the man was not traced.
F04  73 ^Perhaps the news of their search got around, for a man did obligingly
F04  74 present himself at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have
F04  75 committed the murder*- but he was mentally defective, and, despite his
F04  76 claim to infamy, had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.
F04  77    |^Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body, which had at
F04  78 first been considered as belonging to the killer, proved yet another
F04  79 red herring, for it was learned that they had been borrowed by
F04  80 Elizabeth Camp from one of her sisters.
F04  81    |^A young man from Reading named Marshall had an uncomfortable time
F04  82 in the presence of the coroner. ^This man was known to have left his
F04  83 home on February 11, and to have been away for four days. ^Not in
F04  84 itself a crime, but, added to the knowledge that he had gone shopping
F04  85 in the town of Guildford for a false moustache, it left him with
F04  86 something to explain. ^His story was that he had left home to try to
F04  87 join the Army (presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance his
F04  88 military bearing), and this was accepted.
F04  89    |^And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with adjournments,
F04  90 until April 7, finally had to be content to return a verdict of
F04  91 *"wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.**" ^The most
F04  92 vital clue of the Wedgwood pestle had been of no assistance. ^The
F04  93 killer must have been very thankful that the science of dactyloscopy
F04  94 was only in its beginnings.
F04  95    |^The next female fatality occurred eight years later, yet so
F04  96 strange were the circumstances that it was a further seven years
F04  97 before even a ghost of a solution emerged.
F04  98    |^There has always been something sinister in the idea of tunnels.
F04  99 ^The building of them was one of the most dangerous jobs connected
F04 100 with railway construction; and there were many people who believed
F04 101 that to travel through tunnels would be an equally hazardous business.
F04 102    |^Some thought that the result would be all sorts of horrible
F04 103 illnesses brought on by the confined atmosphere. ^*"The shareholders
F04 104 who travel by it will be so heartily sick, what with the foul air,
F04 105 smoke and sulphur, that the mention of a railway will be worse than
F04 106 Ipecacuanha,**" wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
F04 107 proposed to build the Box Tunnel.
F04 108    |^The mere thought of subterranean travel gave others a feeling of
F04 109 danger. ^A medical journal said, *"the deafening peal of thunder, the
F04 110 sudden immersion in gloom, and the clash of reverberated sounds in a
F04 111 confined space combine to produce a momentary shudder, or idea of
F04 112 destruction, a thrill of annihilation.**" ^It was also prophesied that
F04 113 passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the darkness.
F04 114    |^For all that, as far as England is concerned, there have been
F04 115 only two occasions on which a body has been found in a tunnel in
F04 116 circumstances pointing to murder.
F04 117    |^The first was that of \0Mr Gold, in the famous Lefroy case, and
F04 118 by an odd chance the second tragedy occurred on the same line,
F04 119 although this time the victim was a woman.
F04 120    |^Though in the minds of most people there was no doubt that the
F04 121 woman had been the victim of foul play, the verdict brought in was
F04 122 that there was not sufficient evidence to show whether she had fallen
F04 123 or been thrown from a train.
F04 124    |^The Merstham Tunnel, on the London-to-Brighton line, is
F04 125 approximately one mile long, and some time before midnight on
F04 126 September 24, 1905, a Sunday, Sub-Inspector Peacock, of the London,
F04 127 Brighton and South Coast Railway, who was in charge of a gang of men
F04 128 engaged in relining the tunnel, was walking through when he stumbled
F04 129 over something in the darkness.
F04 130    |^It was the battered and broken body of a woman. ^He sent word
F04 131 straight away to near-by Merstham Station, and a stretcher party took
F04 132 the body to the Feathers Hotel to await identification. ^Was it a case
F04 133 of suicide, where some unhappy soul had walked deliberately into the
F04 134 blackness and into the path of some train?
F04 135    |^This hardly seemed likely, since, when she was examined by a
F04 136 local doctor, the woman, young, small, and rather plump, was found to
F04 137 have her own silk scarf drawn almost tight enough to strangle her, and
F04 138 the ends thrust in her mouth like a gag. ^Both her wrists bore the
F04 139 marks of severe bruising, and there were other injuries on her body
F04 140 which had occurred before her death was ensured by some train which
F04 141 had roared through the tunnel.
F04 142    |^There were no letters or papers found on her to assist
F04 143 identification, no money, and no railway ticket. ^By then reports were
F04 144 being gathered about all traffic over this stretch of line, but no
F04 145 information was forthcoming about any carriage with an open door, nor
F04 146 any passenger reporting an incident which might relate.
F04 147    |^So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and long brown
F04 148 hair in a bun at the back of her head remained a mystery until later
F04 149 the following day. ^During that time a description of the girl was
F04 150 circulated, and a \0Mr Robert Money came forward to identify her as
F04 151 his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two. ^The girl, who was described
F04 152 as being *"always bright and jolly,**" had been unmarried, and lived
F04 153 at Lavender Hill, Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for
F04 154 whom she worked as a book-keeper.
F04 155    |^On the Sunday, the day of her death, she had gone out in the
F04 156 evening at about seven o'clock, telling her room-mate, Emma Hone, that
F04 157 she was going for a walk, but would not be gone for long. ^According
F04 158 to Miss Hone, she had not been carrying a handbag, but she believed
F04 159 she had had a small purse.
F04 160    |^Mary had certainly taken some money with her, for the police
F04 161 traced her movements to a shop in Clapham, where she had bought some
F04 162 chocolate. ^Miss Golding, who kept the sweet shop in the Station
F04 163 Approach near Clapham Junction, knew Mary well, and knew she was fond
F04 164 of sweets; and in the brief conversation they had had she recalled
F04 165 that the girl had said she was going to Victoria*- hardly the short
F04 166 walk she had suggested to the friend who shared her room.
F04 167    |^At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector was able to identify a
F04 168 photograph of the girl, and he said he had last seen her on platform
F04 169 six waiting to board a train for the short run to Victoria. ^A
F04 170 passenger at Victoria said he had seen a young lady *"as near as
F04 171 possible**" like the photograph shown him, with a man *"very close in
F04 172 conversation and walking arm in arm.**"
F04 173    |^A guard reported that at East Croydon he had seen what was
F04 174 accepted as the same couple sitting close together in a first-class
F04 175 compartment of the train from London Bridge of which he was in charge.
F04 176 ^The two could have joined this train by taking one from Victoria and
F04 177 changing at East Croydon. ^He also believed that they had still been
F04 178 together at South Croydon, and he remembered that when they reached
F04 179 Redhill, after passing through Merstham Tunnel, a man who might have
F04 180 been the companion of the girl had left the train.
F04 181    |^Medical evidence established that Mary Money had been dead for
F04 182 about an hour before her body was discovered, and this matched
F04 183 reasonably well with the timetable of the train in question.
F04 184    |^More important evidence came from a signalman at Purley Oaks, who
F04 185 had seen, as the train passed his box, a couple struggling in a
F04 186 first-class compartment; but he seemed to have been used to seeing
F04 187 couples engaged in close embraces, for he had not attached any
F04 188 importance to the scene at the time.

F05   1 **[148 TEXT F05**]
F05   2    |^*0There was a division of political responsibility between the
F05   3 Federal Government and the three territorial governments. ^The Federal
F05   4 Assembly would consist of thirty-five members, of whom twenty-six
F05   5 would represent the 200,000 Europeans. ^The 6 million Africans would
F05   6 be represented by six Africans and three Europeans. ^Later amendments
F05   7 of a highly intricate character increased the Federal membership to
F05   8 fifty-nine, increased the membership elected almost wholly by the
F05   9 white vote from twenty-six to forty-four and the African
F05  10 representation from nine to fifteen, with the new members elected on
F05  11 white-predominant mixed rolls. ^It did not take long before the
F05  12 anti-federationists felt their fears were being clearly confirmed.
F05  13    |^As a concession to these doubts, it was stated that the active
F05  14 principle behind the Federation's racial policies would be, not
F05  15 \6*1apartheid, *0but *'partnership**'. ^This reassuring word was never
F05  16 precisely defined, and has subsequently been treated by almost every
F05  17 African with derision. ^At the same time the Constitution provided for
F05  18 an *'African Affairs Board**' which could appeal direct to the British
F05  19 Government against any legislation it regarded as discriminatory.
F05  20 ^(Twice it did so appeal, against the Constitution Amendment Act and
F05  21 the 1958 Electoral Bill. ^Both appeals were immediately rejected.)
F05  22 ^Africans continued to remember the remark of Sir Godfrey Huggins as
F05  23 Premier of Southern Rhodesia in 1934: ^*'It is time for the people of
F05  24 England to realize that the white man in Africa is not prepared and
F05  25 never will be prepared to accept the African as an equal either
F05  26 socially or politically.**' ^They continued to remember that whatever
F05  27 Huggins said about *'partnership**' for English consumption, at home
F05  28 he defined it as the sort of partnership that exists between a rider
F05  29 and his horse.
F05  30    |^The Rhodesian system of *'partnership**', while less crude and
F05  31 blatant than South Africa's \6*1apartheid, *0meant colour
F05  32 discrimination almost as pervasive and, it was sometimes held, less
F05  33 honest. ^The white population, one-tenth of the whole, owned half the
F05  34 land; the franchise was inexorably loaded against the African, Pass
F05  35 Laws continued, the colour-bar, though legally modified in detail from
F05  36 time to time, remained socially inflexible, the Native Affairs
F05  37 Department governed almost every aspect of African life. ^What had
F05  38 happened in South Africa after the Union of 1912 happened in Central
F05  39 Africa after the Federation of 1953: instead of the tolerant elements
F05  40 leavening and liberalizing the whole, the reverse took place, and so
F05  41 far from white opinion mellowing, it hardened. ^Garfield Todd, the
F05  42 moderately progressive Premier of Southern Rhodesia, was squeezed out
F05  43 of office in 1958, and the subsequent elections returned the strongly
F05  44 federationist Sir Edgar Whitehead. ^The Federal Government replaced
F05  45 the powerfully pro-settler Sir Godfrey Huggins with the even tougher
F05  46 and more determined ex-trade unionist, ex-boxer, ex-engine-driver Sir
F05  47 Roy Welensky who, so far from modifying his determination that the
F05  48 Africans must never dominate the Federation, continued to reaffirm it
F05  49 with increasing vigour and confidence. ^Of Sir Roy's extreme rightism
F05  50 it can only be said that his opponents of the Dominion Party, which
F05  51 leans towards the *'South African solution**', are even more extreme.
F05  52 ^In all events, he had a mandate now to press the British Government
F05  53 in 1960 for complete independence for an almost exclusively
F05  54 white-controlled Federation.
F05  55    |^Physically, it seemed to begin with, federation paid off:
F05  56 business boomed, Salisbury*- capital of both Southern Rhodesia and the
F05  57 Federation*- mushroomed into a significant city. ^All around, the
F05  58 political storm-clouds grew. ^The settler community and their
F05  59 spokesmen in London had argued that the African resistance to
F05  60 federation had been based only on prejudice and ignorance, and would
F05  61 disappear as they began to recognize the solid benefits that it
F05  62 brought. ^Precisely the contrary came to pass. ^The Central Africans
F05  63 were by now only too well aware of the yeasty upsurge of nationalist
F05  64 movements all around them, while they remained groping in the stagnant
F05  65 pool. ^With virtually no practical means of political self-expression,
F05  66 nationalist movements grew inwards upon themselves. ^In each of the
F05  67 territories the usual *'African National Congress**' existed. ^In
F05  68 Southern Rhodesia it had sunk into inactivity, but revived with the
F05  69 emotions against federation. ^In Northern Rhodesia it was active but
F05  70 divided; a movement against the Congress President, Harry Nkumbula,
F05  71 charged him with softness and tolerance and in 1958 a breakaway group
F05  72 was formed called the *'Zambia African Congress**', led by the
F05  73 ex-schoolmaster Kenneth Kaunda. ^Then, as the United National
F05  74 Independence Party, \0Mr Kaunda's group promised independence by
F05  75 October 1960, which was rash.
F05  76    |^The potentialities for conflict existed in all three countries,
F05  77 but it was in Nyasaland that the nationalist organization developed
F05  78 its greatest energy. ^The Nyasaland Congress had been formed in 1950;
F05  79 the institution of Federation three years later provided it with its
F05  80 {6*1raison d'e*?5tre}, *0and in 1958 it received at last the genuine
F05  81 leadership and stimulation it had awaited. ^\0Dr Hastings Banda, after
F05  82 forty years away from his homeland, returned, bursting with vigour, to
F05  83 be instantly elected President of Congress. ^\0Dr Banda had been a
F05  84 doctor in north London most of the time, combining the practice of
F05  85 medicine with political campaigning for African causes. ^For the three
F05  86 years before his return he had been in Ghana. ^In the summer of 1958
F05  87 he had a sensationally triumphant return. ^He brought with him a
F05  88 Western education, an African sense of values, a keen sense of
F05  89 political organization and a biting oratorical gift. ^Hastings Banda
F05  90 had something Messianic for the people of Nyasaland.
F05  91    |^Seven months after \0Dr Banda's return the first trouble came.
F05  92 ^Fifteen Africans were arrested in February 1959 for holding an
F05  93 unauthorized meeting in the Northern Province of Nyasaland. ^The jail
F05  94 in which they were held was attacked by a furious crowd, which
F05  95 succeeded in rescuing them; a series of riots at once broke out over
F05  96 the Province, and Federal soldiers were flown into Nyasaland from the
F05  97 Rhodesias to put down the civil disorder. ^In the clash that followed
F05  98 fifty Africans were killed.
F05  99    |^Trouble swiftly developed into crisis. ^In Nyasaland a thousand
F05 100 Congressmen were arrested*- including \0Dr Banda. ^The Governor, Sir
F05 101 Robert Armitage, let it be known that the African Nationalists had
F05 102 prepared a plot to assassinate the white population. ^In Southern
F05 103 Rhodesia 500 more were detained; in Northern Rhodesia thirty-eight
F05 104 *'Zambia Congress**' leaders were charged with forming a murderous
F05 105 society to prevent Africans from voting in the coming elections. ^The
F05 106 Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia declared a State of Emergency,
F05 107 shortly afterwards pronounced the African National Congress illegal
F05 108 and legislated for government powers to detain opponents, without
F05 109 charge or trial, for up to five years. ^Even South Africa had up to
F05 110 that time no legislation so drastic.
F05 111    |^At this point the whole issue forced itself into the British
F05 112 consciousness, and became a matter of major political contention. ^It
F05 113 grew even more acute when a four-man commission led by \0Mr Justice
F05 114 Devlin, sent out to investigate the reasons for the upheaval, produced
F05 115 a long report which shocked everyone*- except, as it seemed later, the
F05 116 government. ^The Devlin Commission reported a *'deep and bitter
F05 117 division of opinion separating the Government from the people**', and
F05 118 that the African population of Nyasaland was almost solid in its
F05 119 profound opposition to federation. ^While the State of Emergency was
F05 120 justified, it added, *'there was no evidence of anything that could be
F05 121 called a plot**'. ^\0Dr Banda, said the commission, would not have
F05 122 approved any such policy of murder. ^*'Unnecessary and illegal
F05 123 force**' had been used in dealing with the disturbances. ^In the most
F05 124 alarming phrase of all, the report said that the territory of
F05 125 Nyasaland since the declaration of the Emergency had become *'a police
F05 126 state**'.
F05 127    |^In the subsequent furious debate in Parliament the British
F05 128 Government startled the Opposition by blandly accepting such parts in
F05 129 the Devlin Report that appeared to endorse its policy, and rejecting
F05 130 all parts that were critical. ^The Colonial Secretary, \0Mr Lennox
F05 131 Boyd, allowed the storm to beat around him. ^The situation remained
F05 132 unchanged; \0Dr Banda and his colleagues remained in prison. ^A
F05 133 considerable section of British opinion, aware at last of the great
F05 134 potentialities for danger in Central Africa, began to view the whole
F05 135 Federation with deep uneasiness. ^Sir Roy Welensky continued to
F05 136 prophecy with confidence that the 1960 conference on the
F05 137 constitutional future of the Federation would give him even greater
F05 138 powers. ^The more clamant element among the Rhodesia settlers,
F05 139 incensed at the growing hostility in Britain, began to talk loudly of
F05 140 secession, of a Central African version of the Boston Tea-Party.
F05 141    |^The following year the Colonial Secretary, \0Mr Lennox Boyd,
F05 142 finally retired from active politics to the board of his family
F05 143 brewing concern, and was replaced by Iain Macleod. ^Almost at once a
F05 144 sensible difference in the situation emerged. ^The new approach was
F05 145 cautious but apparent. ^The Prime Minister led the way with a tour
F05 146 round British Africa, culminating in the Union, where he startled the
F05 147 Nationalist Government by referring to the \6*1apartheid *0policies in
F05 148 fairly critical terms, and spoke of the *'wind of change**' that was
F05 149 rising throughout the African continent. ^It was not an impassioned
F05 150 denunciation, but it was a great deal more than any British Government
F05 151 spokesman had done before, and it markedly shifted the whole
F05 152 relationship between the United Kingdom and the repressive
F05 153 administrations in Africa.
F05 154    |^Therefore when the new Colonial Secretary himself travelled out
F05 155 to Central and East Africa to investigate conditions there, his
F05 156 mission was regarded with a watchful optimism by the African
F05 157 politicians, and an undisguised hostility from the right-wing
F05 158 settlers. ^The result was a temperate but unmistakable reorientation
F05 159 of the British attitude towards the dependencies in Africa, a
F05 160 realistic Conservative adjustment to the *'wind of change.**'
F05 161    |^By the spring of 1960, when \0Dr Banda was released, the
F05 162 Nyasalanders' determination was absolute: to secede from the
F05 163 Federation, come what may, and form their own independent nation under
F05 164 wholly African control. ^In this spirit they attended the 1960
F05 165 conference in London, the outcome of which was surprisingly cordial.
F05 166 ^An agreement was reached on a constitution which although it fell
F05 167 short of \0Dr Banda's desire, did establish an African majority in the
F05 168 Legislative Council and Ministerial rank on the Executive Council.
F05 169 ^Taking their cue from \0Dr Banda, the Nyasalanders were unmoved by
F05 170 the arguments that a poor, resourceless, landlocked country like
F05 171 theirs made independence an unreality. ^\0Dr Banda has talked of the
F05 172 possibility of another Federation, of African creation*- of
F05 173 associating his country with Tanganyika, or with Northern Rhodesia.
F05 174 ^Ethnically and politically there could be much justification for
F05 175 this, but two paradoxical difficulties arise: Tanganyika is too poor,
F05 176 and Northern Rhodesia is too rich. ^Tanganyika's economic difficulties
F05 177 are almost as great as Nyasaland's, while Northern Rhodesia's copper
F05 178 interests are so great that its Europeans would go to serious lengths
F05 179 to preserve the mines from an African administration. ^The Africans of
F05 180 Northern Rhodesia have nevertheless been stimulated by \0Dr Banda's
F05 181 success into a new political activity of their own. ^Divided as the
F05 182 Northern Rhodesians are between Harry Nkumbula's government-tolerated
F05 183 Congress and the more intensely nationalist Zambia group of Kenneth
F05 184 Kaunda, they still have far greater strength than the Africans of
F05 185 Southern Rhodesia. ^Unlike their colleagues of the south, they are
F05 186 permitted*- indeed encouraged*- to form Trades Unions, and in spite of
F05 187 continuous opposition from the white labour in the mines, their
F05 188 industrial organization is probably the strongest in African Africa.
F05 189    |^The independence disasters in the Congo had their immediate and
F05 190 obvious repercussions in the Rhodesias. ^The settler government of
F05 191 Southern Rhodesia, torn between genuine apprehension of African
F05 192 violence and the nervous satisfaction of having demonstrable reason
F05 193 for tightening legislation, reacted abruptly. ^Sir Edgar Whitehead and
F05 194 his Cabinet felt above all things the necessity to win the elections
F05 195 that had been promised for the following spring, and to do this it
F05 196 seemed necessary to prove to the white electorate its ability to clamp
F05 197 down on upstart Africans and prevent any danger of a *'Rhodesian
F05 198 Congo**'.
F05 199    |^The opposition Dominion Party, predominantly white-supremacist,
F05 200 was quick to exploit the new racial fears of the Europeans, stimulated
F05 201 by the panic-stories from the European refugees from the Congo. ^The
F05 202 Government's counter to this was to raise the threat of secession from
F05 203 the Federation in an attempt to force the British Government into
F05 204 relinquishing its reverse powers of veto*- long-unused, but still the
F05 205 Africans' only protection against complete settler rule.

F06   2    |^*0The so-called human flea ({*1Pulex irritans}) *0is today more
F06   3 of a nuisance than a menace, but was formerly the main carrier of
F06   4 plague. ^In spite of its popular name it associates more naturally
F06   5 with animals such as the fox and the badger, which live in large
F06   6 burrows. ^According to the British Museum booklet, man *'evidently did
F06   7 not suffer from {*1Pulex irritans} *0until he began to occupy a more
F06   8 or less permanent home which must have been*- and actually still is*-
F06   9 not altogether unlike a large hole**'. ^Many architects of our
F06  10 acquaintance would dissent from this last view, but the fact remains
F06  11 that fleas can still be one of the main hazards of lying in bed.
F06  12 ^Readers with chronic Oblomovitis may like a note of the booklet's
F06  13 advice concerning the odd flea that may still be encountered in bed
F06  14 even in the best-regulated home*- or hole. ^This *'may with some skill
F06  15 be caught with the fingers, after which the fingers with the flea
F06  16 tightly gripped between them should be dipped under water and the
F06  17 irritating insect is then easily killed**'.
F06  18    |^The last animal at all likely to disturb the pleasures of lying
F06  19 in bed is the bed-bug, {*1Cimex lectularius}, *0which some would
F06  20 regard as the most unpleasant household pest existing in western
F06  21 Europe at the present time. ^The original meaning of the word bug was
F06  22 bogy, hobgoblin, or *'terror by night**', and it is found in this
F06  23 sense in the works of Shakespeare and many other Renaissance writers.
F06  24 ^The British naturalist Thomas Moufet mentions it in his
F06  25 {*1Insectorum Sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum} *0(1634), and one
F06  26 of the contributions to this early entomological compilation describes
F06  27 how in 1583 two ladies of noble birth at Mortlake were much distressed
F06  28 by the presence of the insects. ^John Southall, in his *1Treatise of
F06  29 \1Buggs, *0published in 1730, says that the creatures had increased
F06  30 greatly during the previous sixty years, especially in the City of
F06  31 London.
F06  32    |^This is no place to go into the natural history of the bed-bug,
F06  33 but it should perhaps be mentioned that, like the louse, it has been
F06  34 given a picturesque collection of popular names. ^These include the
F06  35 *'mahogany flat**' (from its colour), the *'Norfolk Howard**', and
F06  36 even the *'B flat**'*- the last, incidentally, being due to the flat
F06  37 shape of the bug, and not to any special musical ability it has been
F06  38 noticed to possess. ^Another graphic name is the *'red army**',
F06  39 strictly non-political in origin, but derived from the bug's tendency
F06  40 to turn deep purple or dark red when gorged with human blood.
F06  41    |^But it is not only external causes that may destroy the pleasure
F06  42 of lying in bed. ^Anyone who has attempted to relax when in a state of
F06  43 nervous anxiety will be familiar with the condition commonly known as
F06  44 *'jittery legs**'. ^Although fully extended in the horizontal position
F06  45 the body feels tense and unrelaxed. ^A conscious effort of will is
F06  46 needed to keep the legs still, and the keyed-up feeling which pervades
F06  47 the whole body may even give rise to severe physical pain. ^Sometimes
F06  48 the condition is so acute that the legs twitch and jerk quite
F06  49 involuntarily. ^In such cases the patient may feel so uncomfortable
F06  50 that he will send for a doctor, but an aspirin or some other mild
F06  51 sedative usually suffices to relax the tension.
F06  52    |^Another disagreeable accompaniment of lying in bed may be the
F06  53 condition known as pruritus, which expresses itself in a severe
F06  54 itching sensation as soon as the warmth of the body has heated the
F06  55 bedclothes. ^This is particularly prevalent among elderly people, but
F06  56 can be alleviated by the application of ointments on a medical
F06  57 prescription. ^Hay fever and other allergies may also be associated
F06  58 with lying in bed, due either to feathers in the pillow or mattress or
F06  59 (less commonly recognized as the cause) an accumulation of woolly dust
F06  60 under the bed. ^The irritants associated with dust under beds may
F06  61 sometimes be so powerful that the bed's occupant may seem to be
F06  62 afflicted by a chronic cold. ^These and other effects of bedding on
F06  63 health were recognized as long ago as the eighteen-eighties where it
F06  64 was the custom to stuff pillows and mattresses with pine-shavings in
F06  65 the belief that these would alleviate lung and bronchial conditions.
F06  66    |^In spite of the unpleasant consequences sometimes associated with
F06  67 lying in bed, many people have not been deterred from going to bed
F06  68 quite voluntarily for very long periods. ^One of the present writers
F06  69 knows a healthy woman who retired to bed nearly ten years ago on the
F06  70 death of her husband, and has never stirred out of it since. ^There is
F06  71 also the case cited by Reynolds of the Frenchman, Raoul Duval, who
F06  72 went to bed in Abbeville in 1928 and remained there for eighteen
F06  73 years. ^The reason he gave was that he did not wish to *'see the
F06  74 world, nor talk nor think about it**', an ambition that was, however,
F06  75 abruptly shattered in 1940 when the town was heavily dive-bombed. ^As
F06  76 Reynolds remarks, if Duval really did stay in bed throughout this
F06  77 ordeal it shows quite exceptional conscientiousness and determination.
F06  78 ^Another case of a prolonged voluntary stay in bed began in 1875 when
F06  79 a Spanish doctor in Galicia, being tired of visiting reclining
F06  80 patients, eventually decided to follow their example. ^He retired to
F06  81 bed in his own house, where he remained for sixteen years, seeing only
F06  82 those patients who were well enough to come to him.
F06  83    |^As both of these picturesque tales originated in newspaper
F06  84 reports we would be ill-advised to take them too seriously, but we
F06  85 shall conclude this chapter with two further aspects of lying in bed
F06  86 for which there is sound historical evidence: the {*1lit de justice}
F06  87 *0and the {*1lit de parade}. ^*0Throughout the centuries there have
F06  88 been cases of people retiring to their beds for certain special
F06  89 reasons, often as a result of some superstitious or ritualistic
F06  90 belief. ^The \*1couvade *0is one example, and the {*1lit de justice}
F06  91 *0and {*1lit de parade} *0are others, although, of course, they are
F06  92 used for quite different reasons.
F06  93    |^The {*1lit de justice} *0is the older of the two, and may be
F06  94 defined as the custom of a king, dictator, high priest, or other
F06  95 person of great authority issuing edicts and judgements to a formal
F06  96 assembly of his subordinates from his bed. ^The bed is not
F06  97 necessarily, nor even normally, the one he usually sleeps in, but
F06  98 resembles rather a ceremonial couch, elaborate in design and
F06  99 ornamentation, standing in some important place of assembly. ^(See
F06 100 Plate 55.) ^It is sometimes stated that the {*1lit de justice}
F06 101 *0dates from medieval times, but the institution is in fact much
F06 102 older. ^Thus in one of the fragments of the Greek historian
F06 103 Phylarchus, who flourished in the third century {0B.C.} we may read
F06 104 how Alexander the Great used to recline and transact business on a
F06 105 golden bed in the middle of a gigantic tent, with his troops and
F06 106 attendants to the number of two thousand or more drawn up in order
F06 107 around him. ^Roman emperors and high officials also gave audience in
F06 108 the same position, and there can be little doubt that a form of the
F06 109 {*1lit de justice} *0was used by political leaders and tribal chiefs
F06 110 in the Neolithic Age and even before.
F06 111    |^Henry Havard in the third volume of his {*1Dictionnaire de
F06 112 l'Ameublement et de la De*?2coration} *0(1887-90) gives numerous
F06 113 examples of the {*1lit de justice} *0in later historical times.
F06 114 ^From the Middle Ages onwards, especially in France, the bed and not
F06 115 the throne was considered the proper place for the installation of
F06 116 royalty at public functions. ^Thus in the fourteenth century when the
F06 117 French king appeared in Parliament he would recline on a bed raised on
F06 118 a dais. ^The dais was approached by seven steps, carpeted in blue
F06 119 velvet embroidered with golden {6fleurs-de-lis}. ^*0Around the dais
F06 120 were his subordinates, each in a position appropriate to his rank.
F06 121 ^Members of the royal house were seated, the chief nobles stood, the
F06 122 lesser nobles knelt; there is no record of commoners having been in
F06 123 attendance on such august occasions, but if they were they must
F06 124 presumably have grovelled on the floor.
F06 125    |^At first the prerogative of the {*1lit de justice} *0was
F06 126 restricted to royal personages, but the idea was obviously so
F06 127 attractive, allowing as it did a combination of ease and authority,
F06 128 that it began to be more widely adopted. ^In this new context, the
F06 129 ceremonial bed, or {*1lit de parade}, *0became an accepted part of
F06 130 social life in western Europe from early Renaissance times until the
F06 131 French Revolution. ^Those whose social status permitted them to
F06 132 receive visitors without the customary courtesy of standing up were
F06 133 not slow to exploit the possibilities of horizontality in their social
F06 134 contacts. ^It conferred a subtle but undeniable prestige, and
F06 135 paradoxically suggested a superiority of stature which would often
F06 136 have been far less apparent in the vertical position.
F06 137    |^Nobles and others whose status is dependent on hereditary
F06 138 privilege rather than personal merit were among the first to adopt the
F06 139 new technique, and were swiftly followed by the smaller fry who saw in
F06 140 the {*1lit de parade} *0an easy and comfortable method of
F06 141 establishing their social superiority. ^Women were early in the field,
F06 142 and it became the practice for any woman who felt she could get away
F06 143 with it to receive the consolation or congratulation of her friends in
F06 144 bed on occasions which ranged from the death of a husband to the
F06 145 marriage of a favourite niece. ^Duchesses and courtesans could insist
F06 146 on the {*1lit de parade} *0as a right based on riches, social
F06 147 position, or physical attraction; humbler personages enjoyed it only
F06 148 when the production of a child conferred on them an unaccustomed
F06 149 prestige. ^Ceremonial lyings-in after childbirth were nevertheless
F06 150 attended by their own ritual. ^Guests were expected to bring the
F06 151 mother gifts commensurate with her achievement, and dances and other
F06 152 entertainments were arranged for her benefit.
F06 153    |^The {*1lit de parade} *0also provided women with an excuse to
F06 154 indulge the extravagance so characteristic of their sex. ^It was an
F06 155 opportunity to wear the richest and most seductive garments and to
F06 156 deck the bedroom with expensive silk and satin hangings. ^Thus a
F06 157 letter written in the early seventeenth century tells how the Countess
F06 158 of Salisbury *'was brought to bed of a daughter and \1lyes in very
F06 159 richly, for the hanging of her chamber... is valued at fourteen
F06 160 thousand pounds**'. ^Unchivalrously, the husbands who had to provide
F06 161 such innocent indulgences eventually began to count the cost. ^In
F06 162 fact, in some countries legislation was passed prohibiting any
F06 163 excessive ostentation on the {*1lit de parade}. ^*0In Milan, for
F06 164 example, women were not allowed to use counterpanes of embroidered
F06 165 silk, or stitched with gold or silver thread, nor to wear silk
F06 166 camisoles when receiving callers.
F06 167    |^Roger \de Fe*?2lice, in his *1French Furniture under Louis *=15,
F06 168 *0has some interesting observations on a variation of the {*1lit de
F06 169 parade} *0practised by ladies of rank in the eighteenth century. ^He
F06 170 writes:
F06 171 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
F06 172    |^*'Long before the time of Madame Re*?2camier the indolent belles
F06 173 of the day were fond of receiving {*1en de*?2shabille*?2},
F06 174 *0reclining on their *"\*1turquoises*0**" or *"\*1duchesses*0**"; for
F06 175 languishing beauty with weary attitudes already existed, side by side
F06 176 with the more general type of sparkling and mutinous beauty: but what
F06 177 seems strange at a period of so much licence, these ladies, far from
F06 178 showing their bare feet, were expected to conceal them with a coverlet
F06 179 of embroidered silk as a concession to decency.**"
F06 180 **[END INDENTATION**]
F06 181    |^The final exploitation of the {*1lit de parade} *0by the
F06 182 beautiful women of the past was for purposes of lying in state. ^There
F06 183 are many records of this custom, but one example must suffice. ^It
F06 184 concerns the death of the Duchess of Burgundy, wife of the \Dauphin of
F06 185 France in 1712 and is taken by Havard from the {*1Journal de
F06 186 Dangeau.} ^*0On February 12th the body of {Madame la Dauphine} lay
F06 187 all day on her bed at Versailles. ^Her face was uncovered and her
F06 188 hands lay above the bedclothes. ^That evening in the presence of her
F06 189 ladies in waiting ({*'*1une obligation de leur charge**'}) *0a {6post
F06 190 mortem} was performed, but no cause was discovered for her death.

F07   1 **[150 TEXT F07**]
F07   2    |^*2SOME *0years ago a contemporary philosopher told us that there
F07   3 was nothing an Englishman would not do; nothing an American would not
F07   4 say; nothing an Italian would not sing; no music to which the
F07   5 Frenchman would not dance; nothing the German would not covet; and
F07   6 nothing the Chinese would not eat. ^It is not our purpose to discuss
F07   7 this dictum. ^Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at the
F07   8 progress of civilisation which allows a dish borrowed straight from
F07   9 the prehistoric. ^How many centuries ago, in some cave or hilly hide,
F07  10 did our forebears home from the chase hold forth from a spear the
F07  11 welcome gobbet of meat or fish burnt and roasted in the homely and
F07  12 protecting flame. ^How many centuries later did the mercenary in the
F07  13 Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his evening meal. ^Later came
F07  14 the thrifty peasant, later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
F07  15 in Paris, and even later our attractive young ladies toying with these
F07  16 primitive morsels in the gleam and glitter of our latter-day
F07  17 restaurants. ^And, if certain dishes and modes of food have persisted
F07  18 down the ages, the motive that preserved them has always been the
F07  19 same. ^Apart from the need for nourishment, the instinct of
F07  20 hospitality has always been strong in mankind. ^The sharing of a meal
F07  21 in those earliest dangerous days was an admittance into an
F07  22 acquaintanceship far more important than the casual meetings of the
F07  23 present day; the desire to share something more intimate than mere
F07  24 converse has always been there. ^The truth is that good food offers a
F07  25 programme of entertainment almost unlimited in its variety and its
F07  26 presentation affords an opportunity of showing a guest something of
F07  27 ourselves.
F07  28 *<*2AN AMAZING EPOCH OF GROSSNESS AND DELICACY*>
F07  29    |^*0It is a far enough cry from the primitive meal-times of a
F07  30 simpler world to the banquets of later days, when the table groaned
F07  31 under its load of complicated dishes, and for all the blossoming of
F07  32 the arts around them the diners were little removed: it was still
F07  33 fingers before forks*- from their prototype, the hungry hunter. ^There
F07  34 was always the spice of an orgy in those Roman feasts, for instance,
F07  35 with all their peacocks and nightingales' tongues; unreasonable
F07  36 surfeit, too, in the elaborate fashion of eating brought out of Italy
F07  37 into France, we are told, by Catherine \de Medici. ^The peasant in
F07  38 those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but generously enough in his own
F07  39 fashion, save at feast times, when he, too, let himself go; and it was
F07  40 from his simpler food that the later renaissance of cooking was to
F07  41 come. ^Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending procession of
F07  42 dishes from those mammoth kitchens of the 18th century*- that amazing
F07  43 epoch of grossness and delicacy*- sought inspiration at last from the
F07  44 dishes of the country, and, instead of gorging the eye with magnitude,
F07  45 began to understand the value of intelligent selection and comparative
F07  46 simplicity, though nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
F07  47 monstrous.
F07  48 *<*2THE FLESHPOTS OF EGYPT FOR WHICH ISRAEL SIGHED*>
F07  49    |^*0Does one, however, know who first thought of boiling water and
F07  50 food? ^The ancient Britons, I believe, used to make water hot by
F07  51 dropping a red-hot poker into it, because their pots would not stand
F07  52 fire; but Jacob must have had one that would, because Esau sold his
F07  53 birthright to him for a mess of pottage*- and then we hear of the
F07  54 fleshpots of Egypt after which the Israelites sighed. ^Anyhow, Homer
F07  55 does not seem to have known any way of cooking meat except by roasting
F07  56 and boiling. ^When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish was
F07  57 a grill, which he cooked himself, and he knew how to do it, too:*-
F07  58 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F07  59    |^When the languid flames at length subside,
F07  60    |He throws a bed of glowing embers wide;
F07  61    |Above the coals the smoking fragment turns,
F07  62    |And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns.
F07  63 **[END QUOTE**]
F07  64    |^When, however, the Greeks did learn the art of making fireproof
F07  65 earthenware from the Egyptians, their cookery made rapid progress,
F07  66 because they were men of taste and intellect.
F07  67 *<*2RICHLY-DISTILLED PERFUMES AS AN AID TO DIGESTION*>
F07  68    |^*0A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets of the ancient world
F07  69 was the fact that they did not confine the resources of the table to
F07  70 the gratification of one sense alone. ^Having exhausted their
F07  71 invention in the preparation of stimulants for the palate, they broke
F07  72 fresh ground and called another sense to their aid. ^By delicate
F07  73 application of odours and richly-distilled perfumes, these refined
F07  74 voluptuaries aroused the fainting appetite and added a more exquisite
F07  75 and ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the board. ^The
F07  76 gratification of the sense of smelling was a subject of no little
F07  77 importance to the Romans. ^They considered flowers as forming a very
F07  78 essential article in their festal preparations; and it is the opinion
F07  79 of Bassius that at their desserts the number of flowers far exceeded
F07  80 the number of fruits. ^When Nero supped in his Golden House, a mingled
F07  81 shower of flowers and odorous essences fell upon him; and one of the
F07  82 recreations of Heliogabalus was to smother his courtiers with flowers.
F07  83 ^Nor was it entirely as an object of luxury that the ancients made use
F07  84 of flowers; they were considered to possess sanative and medicinal
F07  85 qualities. ^According to Pliny, and others, certain herbs and flowers
F07  86 proved of sovereign power in preventing the approaches of ebriety, or,
F07  87 as Bassius less clearly expresses it, in clarifying the functions of
F07  88 the brain.
F07  89 *<*2THE QUEER DINNERS OF STRANGE LANDS*>
F07  90    |^*0It is said that there is nothing new under the sun, but
F07  91 regarding foodstuffs the traveller occasionally encounters a certain
F07  92 measure of novelty. ^In China, for instance, dried rats are esteemed a
F07  93 delicacy. ^The visitor is told that they restore the hair of the bald
F07  94 and that a stewed black rat will ward off a fever. ^A number of
F07  95 newly-born white mice served alive, dipped in treacle and swallowed
F07  96 like a prairie oyster is considered a piece of resistance. **[SIC**]
F07  97 ^Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards roasted on the point
F07  98 of a spear are definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean peoples have
F07  99 a high opinion of the octopus as an article of diet. ^So have the
F07 100 Japanese and the Chinese. ^The Celestials, apart from eating it fresh,
F07 101 squash it, press it and dry it, in which form, dusted over with flour,
F07 102 you will find a stack of it in almost any provision shop. ^Bats are
F07 103 eagerly eaten in Dahomey, some of the Polynesian islands, the Malay
F07 104 Archipelago and elsewhere. ^Badger hams are a delicacy in China while
F07 105 mole is eaten in many parts of Africa.
F07 106 *<*2TASTE AND TEMPERAMENT IN CURIOSITIES OF DIET*>
F07 107    |^*0The old saying, ~*"One man's meat is another man's poison**",
F07 108 therefore possesses a great deal of truth. ^Taste and temperament in
F07 109 fact play a great part in life, and there are many instances of
F07 110 eccentricity in diet and dishes, as in everything else in life.
F07 111 ^Mankind has tried all kinds of food from roots to bird's nests, and
F07 112 from snails to elephant's feet or walrus blubber. ^Though English folk
F07 113 to-day enjoy shrimps and eat periwinkles with a pin, they shudder at
F07 114 the Frenchman who relishes snails and frogs. ^The West Indian negro
F07 115 refuses to look at stewed rabbit, but will eat palm worms fried in
F07 116 oils and is fond of baked snakes. ^In Brazil and Siam the natives eat
F07 117 ants. ^The entrails of animals are relished in Salonica; they are
F07 118 eaten just as the Italian eats his macaroni. ^The heads of the lambs
F07 119 are considered great delicacies and go first. ^When roasted, the
F07 120 unbounded joy of the native cracking the skull and picking out the
F07 121 tasty bits is nauseating in the extreme. ^Siberian peasants view with
F07 122 disgust the idea of eating hare. ^But there are West Indian natives
F07 123 who declare that no food in the world comes up to fricassee of rats
F07 124 that have fattened themselves in the sugar-cane plantations. ^Each to
F07 125 his taste, therefore, seems to be a reasonable policy to pursue. ^A
F07 126 knowledge of the world's foods, in any case, ought to increase
F07 127 international tolerance.
F07 128 *<*2NATIONAL FOODS WHICH AFFECT THE TEMPERAMENT*>
F07 129    |^*0Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament than is
F07 130 customarily imagined as well as entering human activities to a greater
F07 131 extent than is usually assumed. ^We naturally cannot overlook that
F07 132 Magyar cookery owes one of its most classic features to the Turkish
F07 133 rule under which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years. ^If that
F07 134 country had not been for so long a battlefield red with the blood shed
F07 135 to defend Christian civilisation, Hungary would have been deprived of
F07 136 the condiment which provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and
F07 137 brilliant scarlet hue. ^The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable
F07 138 {6Wiener Schnitzel} as well as dishes and stews heightened with
F07 139 aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious fire, aerian
F07 140 creams, ingenious pastries and a crescent-shaped breakfast roll
F07 141 created by a pastry cook to celebrate the victory against the Turks in
F07 142 1683. ^Spanish cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish
F07 143 dancing and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured, sometimes Quixotic
F07 144 and withal it has a sombre ardour, with streaks of poetry, meat
F07 145 disguised under heavy and vehement sauces, pimentos and rancid butter.
F07 146 ^The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is so languorous, so passionate, and
F07 147 possibly comparable alone to a gypsy melody. ^The paprika and caraway
F07 148 perfume the meats with their antithesis. ^The opulent varieties of
F07 149 Czechoslovak pastries recall in fact the rich heritage of rich
F07 150 embroideries and costumes specifically national.
F07 151 *<*2ART AND SCIENCE OF THE KITCHEN:*>
F07 152    |^*0The art and science of cookery, however, is essentially French,
F07 153 and, irrespective of the fact that I have never run across anyone in
F07 154 Gaul who has been a glutton, I can positively say that it has been
F07 155 equally difficult to find one who has not been an epicure. ^The French
F07 156 have an inborn appreciation of good food and the gusto which they
F07 157 derive from gastronomy is intellectual and aesthetic as well as
F07 158 physical. ^There is the same finesse about their feeding, the same
F07 159 subtle delicacy of touch, the same unfailing sense of proportion as
F07 160 exists among her writers, music composers and other exponents of
F07 161 things that are typically French. ^The *"{pot-au-feu}**" is as much
F07 162 a national institution in France as is tea drinking among ourselves
F07 163 and it is prepared at least once a week in every bourgeois household.
F07 164 ^Thackeray, of course, waxed enthusiastic about Bouillabaisse and
F07 165 sang*-

F07 174 *<*2GENIUS & FOOD*- FOOD FOR THOUGHT*>
F07 175    |^*0A fascinating study also opens up in the dietary welcomed by
F07 176 men of genius as well as the foods for which they have had an
F07 177 aversion. ^Shelley, for example, had a great contempt for animal food,
F07 178 believing that it impaired the intellectual faculties. ^Bunyan's
F07 179 breakfast and supper consisted of a piece of coarse bread and a bowl
F07 180 of milk. ^Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes in food. ^At one
F07 181 dinner he is said to have been blind to the charms of turbot and to
F07 182 have been much more interested in the dish in which it was served. ^He
F07 183 turned it over on the table cloth to examine the marks on the back
F07 184 without going through the formality of having his turbot removed
F07 185 first. ^Wagner was a highly practical feeder. ^He ate very fast,
F07 186 placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as he talked.
F07 187 ^Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe which he washed down with
F07 188 beer. ^A writer who had dinner with Dickens says the menu was
F07 189 Whitstable oysters, a brown sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster &
F07 190 veal stuffing and a gin punch. ^The same man went to see Carlyle, and,
F07 191 after mentioning that he had dined with Longfellow told the sage a
F07 192 very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh; but all the
F07 193 Chelsea philosopher did in return was to ask if his guest would have a
F07 194 cup of tea!

F08  18 the young woman whose behaviour departs widely from accepted
F08  19 contemporary standards is likely to cause heads to shake, tongues to
F08  20 wag, and some doors will close to her and some men feel that she could
F08  21 not make them a suitable wife.
F08  22    |^The way she lives is the first problem. ^To live in a recognised
F08  23 residential club such as the {0*2Y.W.C.A.} *0or university hostel is
F08  24 one acceptable solution; others are to board with a family, or to
F08  25 share a flat with one or two other girls in similar circumstances.
F08  26    |^For slightly older, more experienced young women, a room in a
F08  27 *"family hotel**", a converted house made over for boarders, or a flat
F08  28 in a respectable block preferably near to friends of her family, or
F08  29 relations, are other possibilities. ^However impeccable her own
F08  30 behaviour, she should avoid living with, or near, people who clearly
F08  31 have less regard for convention.
F08  32    |^In her social relationships with men, the woman living alone must
F08  33 accept certain conventions. ^She should not lunch or dine alone with a
F08  34 married man more than once or twice*- unless their relationship is
F08  35 openly a business one that demands it. ^She should never allow a man
F08  36 guest to stay on after a party at her flat or room after other guests
F08  37 have gone, or stay on herself at a man's party after the rest have
F08  38 left. ^She should not entertain a man alone in her apartment, except
F08  39 for the few brief minutes when he calls for her before an evening out
F08  40 together; nor should she go alone to a man's bachelor flat or room.
F08  41 ^In most hostels and boarding houses, convention rules that if a man
F08  42 and woman are alone together, which may at times be perfectly
F08  43 permissible and necessary, the door must be left open.
F08  44    |^The young woman living on her own will not accept an invitation
F08  45 from a man to visit his country home, unless she knows that his mother
F08  46 or other married relation will be there to act as hostess for him.
F08  47 ^Preferably, the invitation should come from his mother.
F08  48    |^The young woman living alone must be especially discreet about
F08  49 drinking only in strict moderation. ^Here again, however innocent her
F08  50 actual life, if she is known not to behave with strict regard for
F08  51 propriety in any one matter, all her other behaviour at once comes
F08  52 under suspicion. ^For the same reason, she should never accept a
F08  53 valuable present from a man who is not a relation.
F08  54    |^A problem common to all young women, not only those living on
F08  55 their own, is that of whether, and when, to offer to *"go Dutch**" or
F08  56 share expenses of an outing with a young man escort.
F08  57    |^This is quite an accepted custom in these days when young women
F08  58 earn sizeable salaries, but a girl must display good manners in the
F08  59 way she offers to do her share of the paying. ^It is easy to hurt a
F08  60 man's feelings.
F08  61    |^With a new acquaintance, it is probably best to let the man
F08  62 *"make the running**" and suggest outings for the first time or two;
F08  63 the girl should show her appreciation by her obvious enjoyment and
F08  64 animation during the outing and by her thanks at the end of it. ^Then
F08  65 she can either take her turn as host, by saying she has been given
F08  66 theatre tickets (or, more simply just, ~*"I've got two theatre
F08  67 tickets**", without more explanation) and asking him to accompany her,
F08  68 perhaps suggesting that to make it entirely *"her**" evening, he
F08  69 allows her to take him for a meal beforehand; or alternatively she
F08  70 can, when accepting his next invitation, say, ^*"Yes, I'd love to
F08  71 come, but let's go Dutch this time**". ^The important thing is that
F08  72 she must make it plain *1before *0the evening begins that some or all
F08  73 of the financial responsibility for it will be hers. ^An argument over
F08  74 the restaurant bill or at the cinema box office is humiliating and
F08  75 undignified for a man, and her good manners must save him from being
F08  76 put in such a situation.
F08  77    |^Similarly, since most men like to be seen to do the paying, it is
F08  78 a tactful precaution if, at the start of the evening out, she gives
F08  79 him the theatre tickets *"to take care of**" and, if they are going to
F08  80 a restaurant for which she is paying, a small purse containing amply
F08  81 enough for the evening, from which he can settle the bills, taxi
F08  82 fares, \0etc. ^If they are sharing expenses, it is tactful still to
F08  83 give him the purse, saying ^*"Would you take my share out of that?**"
F08  84 ^This avoids any undignified *"settling-up**" of each item of the
F08  85 evening.
F08  86 *<*5Introductions, Acknowledgements and Leave Taking*>
F08  87    |^*0When to perform an introduction often puzzles the
F08  88 inexperienced. ^A good rule is ~*"If in doubt, do so**" as it is
F08  89 better to risk seeming a little fussy than to leave two people each
F08  90 wondering who the other is and wishing you had introduced them.
F08  91    |^An introduction is a *1social *0matter; therefore one would not
F08  92 introduce a friend to, say, one's doctor, since a visit to or from the
F08  93 doctor is not a social occasion. ^Naturally if the doctor were also a
F08  94 personal friend, or social acquaintance, the situation might be
F08  95 different and an introduction quite in order.
F08  96    |^Similarly a chance meeting with a friend, while walking with
F08  97 another friend in the street, is not a social occasion and
F08  98 introductions are not called for; unless it seems likely that one is
F08  99 going to stand and chat for a few minutes, or walk along all together,
F08 100 when an introduction will obviously set everyone more at ease.
F08 101    |^The hostess at a small party will see that guests are introduced
F08 102 to one another; at a large party it is in order for guests to effect
F08 103 the introductions between people they know, or even to introduce
F08 104 themselves informally to other guests.
F08 105    |^If one brings a friend to a party, who is not known to the
F08 106 hostess, one must, of course, present one's friend to the hostess
F08 107 immediately on arrival.
F08 108    |^In the business world, strangers should be introduced if it seems
F08 109 likely they will have future dealings with one another. ^For instance,
F08 110 if a regular business contact is waiting in the secretary's room for
F08 111 an interview with her employer, and one of the firm's departmental
F08 112 heads comes in, the secretary should introduce the outsider to the
F08 113 departmental head, unless she knows that for any reason her chief
F08 114 would not approve it.
F08 115    |^Guests are not introduced to servants or members of staff, but if
F08 116 on a visit of any duration, the guest should be made aware of the
F08 117 servant's name and function in some such form as ~*"Aunt Elizabeth,
F08 118 Jane will get you anything you want*- just ring for her.**"
F08 119    |^The form an introduction takes has been very much simplified in
F08 120 recent years, but the general rule of presenting the less important
F08 121 person to the one it is desired to honour most, still remains. ^Men
F08 122 are introduced to women, untitled people are introduced to titled
F08 123 ones, young people to older ones, old friends to newcomers, the
F08 124 unmarried girl to the married woman and so on. ^Because of the very
F08 125 special honour accorded to Royalty and high-ranking clergy, everyone
F08 126 is presented to them, regardless of title, age or sex.
F08 127    |^To perform an introduction, one says something like, ~*"\0Mrs.
F08 128 Smith**" (or, if one knows her well, *"Mary**") *"may I introduce Miss
F08 129 Jones**", and then, turning to Miss Jones, says simply, ^*"\0Mrs.
F08 130 Smith**". ^That is all that is necessary, but if one wishes, one may
F08 131 turn again to \0Mrs. Smith and add ~*"Miss Jones has just returned
F08 132 from a visit to New York**", or some such bit of information which
F08 133 will give \0Mrs. Smith (as the senior member of the pair) a chance to
F08 134 start an interesting conversation.
F08 135    |^When introducing people in circumstances where Christian names
F08 136 are likely to be used straight away (as with young people, or
F08 137 introducing one's relations to old and intimate friends) it is still
F08 138 important to give the surnames clearly on the first introduction;
F08 139 otherwise circumstances can easily arise where people never know one
F08 140 another's surnames and the degree of friendship already achieved makes
F08 141 it impossible to ask.
F08 142    |^*6ACKNOWLEDGING AN INTRODUCTION. ^*0A lady must rise when being
F08 143 introduced to an older woman or *"social superior**" or to a
F08 144 clergyman. ^If the difference in their status is great she should
F08 145 remain standing until the other person either has a seat, or goes
F08 146 away.
F08 147    |^*"How do you do**" is the only possible verbal acknowledgement of
F08 148 an introduction; it is purely formal, and not intended to be treated
F08 149 as an enquiry after anyone's health.
F08 150    |^Handshaking on introduction is largely dying out in Britain
F08 151 although it is still very much the correct thing on the Continent. ^In
F08 152 Britain, the former rule was that the socially superior person should
F08 153 be the first to extend a hand*- and as few people of gentle instincts
F08 154 like, nowadays, to claim social superiority, the usage is less often
F08 155 followed. ^Exceptions are when a much younger person is introduced to
F08 156 an older one, or where the distinction of rank is obvious; then the
F08 157 senior person, if she wishes, will extend a hand.
F08 158    |^Although handshaking is less often practised, it is, of course,
F08 159 very important to take instantly a proffered hand, in order to avoid
F08 160 calling attention to any possible lack of savoir-faire in the other
F08 161 person, and, quite simply, not to keep them waiting with hand
F08 162 outstretched.
F08 163    |^There is no especial rule about shaking hands with or without
F08 164 gloves. ^The only rules are, don't fumble with a glove, and don't
F08 165 apologise for having one.
F08 166    |^*6LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION. ^*0There is a definite etiquette about
F08 167 these. ^Letters should be handed unsealed to the person being
F08 168 introduced, who will, on arrival at the new place, post or leave them
F08 169 by hand on **[SIC**] the friend to whom they are addressed, together
F08 170 with a visiting card or brief covering letter indicating where he or
F08 171 she may be contacted. ^It is not etiquette to deliver a letter of
F08 172 introduction in person to the one to whom it is addressed.
F08 173    |^The addressee should then promptly contact the newcomer with an
F08 174 invitation to meet him or her.
F08 175    |^If you have given someone a letter of introduction to a friend or
F08 176 business contact, it is etiquette to write a second letter, later,
F08 177 thanking him or her for the kindness shown to the newly-introduced
F08 178 person.
F08 179    |^*6THE UNWELCOME INTRODUCTION. ^*0While people performing
F08 180 introductions will, of course, not do so unless reasonably sure that
F08 181 it will be agreeable to both sides, still, the mere fact of having
F08 182 been formally introduced does not compel one to continue an
F08 183 uncongenial acquaintance, but to break it off too pointedly could be
F08 184 construed as rudeness towards the friend performing the introduction.
F08 185 ^The best course is to be civil but not forthcoming, though
F08 186 occasionally, with a really determined pursuer, stronger means may
F08 187 have to be adopted. ^The introduction, however, has committed one to
F08 188 nothing and one need not feel badly about disrupting the acquaintance.

F09  20 *<*5Country Scales and Weights*>
F09  21 *<by \0L. Sanders*>
F09  22    |^*6A *2CENTURY *0and more ago country people had to rely on
F09  23 improvisation and the local craftsman for most of their essential
F09  24 equipment, including means to weigh their produce. ^The Avery
F09  25 Historical Museum has been collecting old weighing instruments from
F09  26 all over the world for a number of years, during which it has acquired
F09  27 many interesting examples made and used in our own countryside. ^Stone
F09  28 weights are among the simpler of these. ^Some may be three or four
F09  29 hundred years old, made from stones taken from field or hillside.
F09  30 ^When farmers had to weigh produce for market and were unable to
F09  31 obtain foundry-made iron weights locally, they sought stones of
F09  32 suitable size, shape and weight and took them to the smith to be
F09  33 fitted with iron lifting rings. ^Then, by a little chipping or the
F09  34 addition of lead, they were adjusted to compare with a neighbour's
F09  35 weights or with the manorial standards. ^Hard igneous rocks, such as
F09  36 granite, made serviceable weights, reasonably impervious to moisture
F09  37 and capable of withstanding hard wear and exposure.
F09  38    |^Occasionally stone weights of the larger denominations, such as
F09  39 twenty-eight and fifty-six pounds, turn up. ^The large oval one marked
F09  40 *'59**', illustrated on the previous page, would have been used to
F09  41 weigh bales of wool, the extra three pounds being an agreed tare
F09  42 allowance for straps or bindings. ^This and the twelve-pound weight
F09  43 came from Jersey and were undoubtedly fashioned from large rounded
F09  44 beach pebbles flattened to form a base. ^The square weight below is
F09  45 from Shropshire and, though figured *'56**', weighs only forty-five
F09  46 pounds. ^This is due not to any dishonesty on the part of the original
F09  47 owner, but to the loss of its lead loading from the large cavity on
F09  48 the under side.
F09  49    |^Cart weighbridges and platform-scales, an English invention of
F09  50 the mid eighteenth century, were scarce even in towns and certainly
F09  51 unknown to the farm worker until well into the second half of the
F09  52 nineteenth century. ^The countryman mostly used beam-scales or hanging
F09  53 steelyards made in the towns by small family concerns employing a few
F09  54 craftsmen and apprentices. ^Some surviving examples are as crude as
F09  55 those used by the ancient Egyptians four or five thousand years
F09  56 earlier, but others show some appreciation of the fundamentals of the
F09  57 science.
F09  58    |^Among the cruder examples are the wooden butter-scales shown
F09  59 below; they are about three hundred years old. ^A central stand or
F09  60 pillar, turned like a chair-leg on a primitive lathe, carries a wooden
F09  61 beam pivoted on a round iron peg: two wooden bowls or platters are
F09  62 suspended from the ends of the beam. ^Scales of this type were used in
F09  63 farmhouses up to the end of the last century.
F09  64    |^Larger hanging wooden beam-scales were often part of the
F09  65 equipment of the miller for weighing sacks of grain and flour. ^They
F09  66 were sometimes as much as six feet long and strongly constructed with
F09  67 metal fittings and rudimentary knife-edges, combining the skills of
F09  68 carpenter and smith. ^They could be used to weigh several sacks at a
F09  69 time on scale-plates suspended from the end knives by shackles and
F09  70 chains. ^The wooden beam-scale opposite is a comparatively small one,
F09  71 about two feet in length, and probably two hundred years old.
F09  72    |^In contrast, the professional scale-makers of the town
F09  73 constructed their products entirely of metal. ^Steelyards, based on
F09  74 the principle of the uneven-armed balance used by the Romans and still
F09  75 known by their name, were in common use, for they permitted the
F09  76 weighing of heavy loads without a large number of loose weights. ^As
F09  77 they required greater precision in manufacture than the beam-scales,
F09  78 few home-made examples survive. ^The seventeenth and
F09  79 eighteenth-century farmhouse steelyards of English and Continental
F09  80 origin in the Avery collection are small, as steelyards go, and many
F09  81 have wooden arms with metal fittings, poise and knife-edges.
F09  82 ^Graduation marks are provided by brass pegs driven into the wood at
F09  83 regular intervals. ^Most of them have two fulcrum knives and duplicate
F09  84 suspensions to take either light or heavy goods*- a principle used by
F09  85 the Romans.
F09  86    |^An example of a craftsman-made wooden steelyard can be seen in
F09  87 the illustration of the fine Orkney pundler, which is one of the
F09  88 prized exhibits in the collection. ^The oak beam is more than six feet
F09  89 in length, and the stone poise weighs thirty-one pounds. ^Graduation
F09  90 marks correspond to multiples of the Scottish pound. ^All the metal
F09  91 fittings are of wrought iron, including the knives which are now well
F09  92 rounded by wear. ^The instrument is believed to have been in use for
F09  93 several hundred years, for the beam bears the weight-stamp of George
F09  94 *=3 obliterating a number of older marks.
F09  95    |^Also from Orkney is a wooden bismar or Danish steelyard, used by
F09  96 sliding a cord fulcrum along the counterweighted lever to balance a
F09  97 load. ^The principle was known to early Aryan tribesmen, who found its
F09  98 simplicity convenient for their nomadic way of life. ^The example
F09  99 illustrated above is three feet long and is thought to be of wych-elm.
F09 100 ^For some two thousand years the bismar, \*1dhari *0or Danish
F09 101 steelyard, as it is variously called, has been widely used throughout
F09 102 the Indian sub-continent and the eastern and northern countries of
F09 103 Europe; but in England it was made illegal in the reign of Edward *=3
F09 104 in favour of the equal-armed beam and Roman-pattern steelyard.

F09 117 primitive cottage on the Cornish cliffs, working with their hands to
F09 118 grow potatoes and flowers for a livelihood, they are surely realists
F09 119 in the truest sense. ^For ten years the Tangyes have struggled against
F09 120 frost and gales, blight and disease, to supply the fickle markets of
F09 121 the industrial cities with early violets, daffodils, anemones and

F09 126 to sustain interest through all the setbacks, encounters with local
F09 127 characters, economics of market gardening and breezy comments from
F09 128 city friends. ^It is also delightful to see the townsman's sentimental
F09 129 feeling for animals and hatred of traps enduring even in the *'peasant

F10   4    |^*4*"B*2OOK *0reading,**" wrote Francis Williams, *"used to be a
F10   5 Socialist habit. ^To secure an educated Socialist democracy this is a
F10   6 habit we should indulge in as we did years ago.**"
F10   7    |^Fifty years ago, when I was a youngster, Socialists said books we
F10   8 must have, though we lack bread, but to-day times have changed. ^Very
F10   9 few Labour voters read Socialist books or treasure a library of their
F10  10 own, and many local Labour Parties have no literature secretaries.
F10  11 ^Social secretaries and Bingo organisers, but no bookstalls.
F10  12    |^When the women's section of our local Labour Party held a jumble
F10  13 sale recently, one of the stalls contained hundreds of second-hand
F10  14 books. ^All were priced at 3\0d. each!
F10  15    |^After most of the mystery, love, romance and adventure books were
F10  16 sold, it was decided to reduce the remainder to 2\0d. each, for if, as
F10  17 often happens, any old clothes, books, pictures or nick-nacks were
F10  18 left over, it would all be left behind for the caretaker of the school
F10  19 to either burn or give to the dustman.
F10  20    |^None of the bazaar committee members were eager to store a lot of
F10  21 old junk in their homes for the next jumble sale, so for his services
F10  22 of burning the books, pictures, \0etc., the caretaker was liberally
F10  23 rewarded.
F10  24    |^I looked at the pile of *"remainders**" and bought *1Roads to

F10  33    |^On some of the books, on the fly-leaf I saw the name {0L. S.}
F10  34 Woodruff, who for many years was chairman of the Harrow East Labour
F10  35 Party, and was an alderman at the time of his death.
F10  36    |^*"Sid**", as he was familiarly known by his colleagues, was one
F10  37 of the most respected and devoted members of the Socialist minority
F10  38 group of a strong Tory Council, and was known to be a well-read,
F10  39 convinced Socialist of burning sincerity.
F10  40    |^In the first World War he was a pacifist and suffered
F10  41 imprisonment for his Socialist beliefs. ^He had the combined gift of
F10  42 keen humour with the virtue of being a good serious propagandist for
F10  43 the Labour Party. ^Sid Woodruff started his pioneering work for Labour
F10  44 when people were overworked, underfed, and lived in sordid slums. ^The
F10  45 lives of the workers in those early days were in the main of narrow
F10  46 dreariness and boisterous brutality, and Alderman Woodruff was one of
F10  47 the educated minority who showed the way to a better life.
F10  48    |^To-day, with a higher standard of living, people imagine they
F10  49 have reached the higher life. ^For most, their reading is the popular
F10  50 newspapers and trashy periodicals.
F10  51    |^When the Nazis made huge bonfires of Socialist literature, I
F10  52 thought of Emerson's lines, ^*"Every lash inflicted is a tongue of
F10  53 fame; every prison a more illustrious abode; every burned book or
F10  54 house enlightens the world.**" ^What would Emerson's thoughts be if he
F10  55 knew that at a Labour Party jumble sale, great thoughts by great men
F10  56 were ignored, while nasty rubbishy books with gaudy covers, dealing
F10  57 with sordid sex and crime, were in great demand?
F10  58 *<*4The Tiny Minority Only*>
F10  59    |^*0We are living in an age to-day when serious, disturbing and
F10  60 admirably written books, packed with vivid details, and written with
F10  61 deep feeling, are read only by a tiny minority.
F10  62    |^Books that helped to make the Socialist Movement grow to its
F10  63 present strength, which showed how to make the world a far happier
F10  64 place for people of all races to live in, are read by few.
F10  65    |^It was Milton who wrote: ^*"A good book is the precious
F10  66 life-blood of a master spirit.**" ^The Socialist Movement has produced
F10  67 many men of vision, who in their courageous and fascinating plays,
F10  68 novels, essays and poems, have shown us a nobler and better life.
F10  69 ^They contain all our ambitions, our indignations and our illusions.
F10  70 ^The Literature of Revolt is a heritage we should treasure, so I am
F10  71 indeed happy, that the late Alderman Sid Woodruff's books are in my
F10  72 bookcase, instead of being burnt by the school caretaker.

F10  81 *<*1by Arthur Woodburn, {0M.P.}*>
F10  82    |^*4A*2FTER *0the last General Election we all speculated what
F10  83 effect {0T.V.} had on the result. ^Our general impression was that
F10  84 the Labour programmes were the most effective and convincing. ^We all
F10  85 have our own little gallup polls among our friends and acquaintances,
F10  86 but as they are usually of our way of thinking and as we are inclined
F10  87 to look for the answer we want, we can be misled. ^For example, since
F10  88 the election there have been months of controversy about unilateral
F10  89 disarmament. ^Both those for and against are fervently convinced they
F10  90 speak for the great majority of the people.
F10  91    |^*1Television and the Political Image *0shows what was actually
F10  92 happening to the minds of the people as they listened or looked in
F10  93 during the election campaign.
F10  94    |^How did the broadcasts affect the elections? ^It was interesting
F10  95 to see how the persistent propaganda against nationalisation was
F10  96 accepted by even Labour supporters and the feeling that Labour was a
F10  97 divided party was also prevalent. ^It is interesting to read about the
F10  98 items electors mentioned as having, in their view, specially affected
F10  99 the elections. ^Of the total, 32% thought *"rash Labour promises*-
F10 100 cost of new pension scheme*- bribery of electorate**" had a bad
F10 101 effect, 26% thought nationalisation hurt Labour and 10% thought
F10 102 strikes, especially that at British Oxygen Works, were bad. ^(The
F10 103 percentages among Labour supporters on these items were 22%, 30% and
F10 104 7% respectively.)
F10 105 *<*4A Common View*>
F10 106    |^*0A fairly common view was that ~*"Labour tried to buy their way
F10 107 in**". ^Harold Macmillan cleverly put this across by adding *"with
F10 108 your money, of course**". ^Keeping the cost of living down came top as
F10 109 the subject of most immediate interest, treatment of old age was next
F10 110 and a permanent peace settlement third. ^Unemployment came fourth and
F10 111 the control of the H bomb was fifth, and so on down the list. ^It is
F10 112 interesting that the subjects of interest have nearly the same
F10 113 proportional interest among supporters of both parties*- cost of
F10 114 living two out of three and H bomb one out of three.
F10 115    |^The general view was that efficiency of the programmes and of the
F10 116 detailed argument did not make a decisive impression. ^Most people
F10 117 were looking for a government; and, therefore, the overall impression
F10 118 of competence and a total policy that was acceptable and clear were
F10 119 the largest factors. ^The Tory Party's goodwill rested on its claim to
F10 120 tradition, its claim to represent the whole nation and its claim to
F10 121 defence of individual rights.
F10 122    |^The Labour Party is accepted as standing for the welfare of the
F10 123 people, but its working-class foundation makes it difficult to
F10 124 reconcile this with its claim to act in the *"national**" interest.
F10 125 ^Its disunity appeared a cause of its losing support. ^Nearly 70% of
F10 126 the electors were reached by Party broadcasts. ^Each Party {0T.V.}
F10 127 programme reached about 20% of the entire adult population. ^About 50%
F10 128 saw the {0T.V.} news bulletins. ^The campaign showed no decisive
F10 129 swing towards either of the main Parties.
F10 130    |^These are only some of the interesting factors which come from
F10 131 the survey. ^There can be no certain conclusions; but it is clear that
F10 132 not many people change sides during an election, though a little
F10 133 change can mean much. ^Three people in every street changing over
F10 134 could change the government.
F10 135    |^So delicate is the balance that it can be tipped by a slip of the
F10 136 tongue or by some development that shakes the confidence of the timid
F10 137 or uncertain. ^It is on this uncertain group that the choice of
F10 138 government rests. ^It's a grave thought.
F10 139    |^This book is worth reading.

F10 145 own traditional methods of ready reckoning. ^In the West the shop or

F11   2 *<*6VERSAILLES REVISITED*>
F11   3 *<*2BY JAMES EDWARD HOLROYD*>
F11   4    |^*0In a small black pocket-diary in the Bodleian Library there are
F11   5 various brief pencilled entries which record the owner's holiday in
F11   6 Paris with a friend in the summer of 1901: ^*'August 7 \0St. Denis.
F11   7 ^August 9 Louvre buildings.**' ^And then: ^*'August 10 Versailles.**'
F11   8 ^The diary is signed {0*2C. A. E.} *0Moberly on the fly-leaf.
F11   9    |^That laconic entry represents the starting-point of the strange
F11  10 experience of the two English women who saw, or thought they saw,
F11  11 Marie Antoinette and members of her entourage in the grounds of the
F11  12 Petit Trianon at Versailles on that far-off summer afternoon.
F11  13    |^The experience lasted only half an hour. ^The two women thought
F11  14 so little of it at the time that they did not discuss it for a week;
F11  15 did not write down any account of it for three months; did not publish
F11  16 it to the world until ten years later.
F11  17    |^When the book appeared pseudonymously under the title of *'An
F11  18 Adventure**' fifty years ago in 1911, it aroused controversy which
F11  19 continues today. ^Although the two women, whom we now know to have
F11  20 been Miss Annie Moberly and Miss Eleanor Jourdain, were of high
F11  21 academic standing, their accounts were not without confusion. ^Some of
F11  22 their evidence is careless if not suspect; some of their research
F11  23 contradictory. ^They have been accused of altering their stories; of
F11  24 adding later touches which lifted their experience from the light of
F11  25 common day into the rarified atmosphere of the late eighteenth
F11  26 century.
F11  27    |^The two women were always somewhat hypersensitive to criticism,
F11  28 and as if to refute any suggestion of collusion or conspiracy, Miss
F11  29 Moberly deposited their letters and papers in the Bodleian. ^Neither
F11  30 of the two is now alive, but the echoes of their adventure*- which has
F11  31 been described as *'the most famous ghost story in the world**'*-
F11  32 still puzzle the inquirer. ^Were they victims of hallucination? ^Did
F11  33 they only imagine the experiences they described? ^Could their
F11  34 adventure be explained in natural terms? ^Or did they, in fact, find a
F11  35 doorway into the past which enabled them to participate, however
F11  36 briefly, in the sunset thoughts of the unhappy queen?
F11  37    |^There are few places in the world in which it is easier to
F11  38 imagine ghosts than the vast palace of Versailles. ^The echoing halls
F11  39 of the great cha*?5teau, the labyrinthine walks of the main park with
F11  40 their stone benches and frozen statuary, the haunted gardens of the
F11  41 Petit Trianon*- all are alike murmurous with the footfalls of history.
F11  42    |^Miss Moberly was the principal of \0St. Hugh's, Oxford, and Miss
F11  43 Jourdain the joint head of a girls' school at Watford on that August
F11  44 afternoon which was to establish their life-long link with Versailles.
F11  45 ^Their respective ages were fifty-five and thirty-eight. ^Both were
F11  46 daughters of Anglican clergy. ^Miss Moberly was, in fact, the seventh
F11  47 child of a bishop of Salisbury who had previously been headmaster of
F11  48 Winchester. ^She had acted as her father's secretary, and although
F11  49 lacking formal academic qualifications was appointed to the headship
F11  50 of the first women's college in Oxford, a post to which she brought
F11  51 considerable gifts of administration and undoubted authority. ^In the
F11  52 summer of 1901 she was seeking a vice-principal for \0St. Hugh's, and
F11  53 the sightseeing holiday, with Miss Jourdain's Paris flat as base, was
F11  54 to be a mutual exploration of temperament and personality.
F11  55    |^Neither of the women claimed to know more of Versailles than
F11  56 occasional casual reading had brought. ^*'We had very hazy ideas as to
F11  57 where it was or what there was to be seen,**' Miss Moberly wrote of
F11  58 the Petit Trianon. ^*'Both of us thought it might prove to be a dull
F11  59 expedition.**' ^Miss Jourdain was familiar with French and gave
F11  60 lessons on the history of the Revolution. ^Miss Moberly could read
F11  61 French but was not good at the spoken word.
F11  62    |^Let us now follow them on their adventure at Versailles. ^In the
F11  63 middle of the afternoon, after the usual tourists' round of the
F11  64 palace, they decided to visit the Petit Trianon. ^They looked up the
F11  65 general direction in Baedeker and walked down through the main grounds
F11  66 until they reached the forecourt of the Grand Trianon. ^Instead of
F11  67 walking along the Avenue \des Deux Trianons, which would have brought
F11  68 them immediately to the main entrance to the Petit Trianon, they went
F11  69 along a lane through a gate on the right-hand side of the Grand
F11  70 Trianon forecourt.
F11  71    |^After walking up the lane they made a sharp turn to the right
F11  72 past some buildings. ^Miss Jourdain described them as farm buildings
F11  73 and noted that implements, among them a plough, were lying around. ^In
F11  74 retrospect they always felt that the point at which they passed the
F11  75 buildings marked the beginning of their adventure*- that from this
F11  76 moment they trod enchanted ground. ^Only in retrospect, however: at
F11  77 the time they were walking briskly and talking with animation about
F11  78 England and their mutual acquaintances. ^Miss Moberly recorded that
F11  79 although the weather had been very hot all the week, the sky was
F11  80 somewhat overcast that afternoon and a lively wind was blowing across
F11  81 the main park.
F11  82    |^Passing the buildings, they went along the middle path of three,
F11  83 where they met two men and asked the way to the house. ^They were told
F11  84 to go straight on. ^The two men were dressed in long greyish-green
F11  85 coats and, according to Miss Moberly, wore small three-cornered hats.
F11  86 ^The two visitors first spoke of them as gardeners, but later thought
F11  87 they must have been officials of some kind. ^Miss Jourdain remembered
F11  88 that when they spoke to the men she saw to the right a detached
F11  89 cottage with stone steps and a woman and girl at the doorway. ^Miss
F11  90 Moberly apparently did not notice either the cottage or the two
F11  91 occupants.
F11  92    |^Unknown to each other, the two visitors now began to experience a
F11  93 deepening sense of depression. ^Miss Jourdain noted that she began to
F11  94 feel that they had lost their way and that something was wrong.
F11  95    |^After leaving the men, they continued along the path until it was
F11  96 crossed by another at right-angles. ^In front of them, overshadowed by
F11  97 trees, they saw a small building with roofed-in columns. ^In their
F11  98 original notes they referred to this as the Temple \de \l'Amour,
F11  99 judging it to be this from the map, but in the published account Miss
F11 100 Moberly described it as *'a light garden kiosk, circular and like a
F11 101 small bandstand.**'
F11 102    |^A man wearing a cloak and a large slouch hat was sitting close to
F11 103 the kiosk. ^As he turned to look at them, both saw that his expression
F11 104 was evil and repulsive, and their growing sense of depression and
F11 105 unease culminated in a feeling of alarm. ^Miss Moberly also recorded
F11 106 that *'everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant;
F11 107 even the trees behind the building seemed to have become flat and
F11 108 lifeless, like a wood worked in tapestry.**' ^There were no effects of
F11 109 light and shade and no wind stirred the trees. ^It was all intensely
F11 110 still. ^She thought that nothing would induce her to go to the left*-
F11 111 presumably past the seated man.
F11 112    |^In the silence they were relieved to hear someone running towards
F11 113 them. ^Miss Moberly *'connecting the sound with the gardeners,**' saw
F11 114 it was a handsome young man*- *'distinctly a gentleman**'*- who also
F11 115 wore a large sombrero and a dark cloak with one end flying out in his
F11 116 prodigious hurry. ^He told them in French that it was not necessary to
F11 117 go to the left and that they would find the house to the right. ^He
F11 118 then disappeared and they heard his retreating footsteps, still
F11 119 running.
F11 120    |^The two visitors then crossed a small rustic bridge over a tiny
F11 121 ravine with a trickle of water on the right, followed a pathway under
F11 122 trees, and skirted a narrow meadow of long grass, damp and with an
F11 123 orchard look about it. ^This, although they did not realise it at the
F11 124 time, was the English garden on the north side of the Petit Trianon.
F11 125 ^The windows facing them were apparently shuttered.
F11 126    |^As they went up to the terrace bordering the north and west
F11 127 fronts, Miss Moberly noticed a woman sitting below the north terrace
F11 128 and holding a paper at arm's-length as if sketching. ^Afterwards she
F11 129 was able to describe the dress with some particularity, and noted,
F11 130 ^*'I thought she was a tourist, but that her dress was old-fashioned
F11 131 and rather unusual (though people were wearing fichu bodices that
F11 132 summer).**' ^Miss Moberly subsequently identified the woman from a
F11 133 photograph as being Marie Antoinette. ^Later it emerged that Miss
F11 134 Jourdain had not noticed anyone at this point, although they asserted
F11 135 that there was no one else in sight.
F11 136    |^The two visitors then crossed over the west terrace fronting the
F11 137 French garden and were moving towards an unshuttered window on the
F11 138 French garden side when they heard a door bang and a young man
F11 139 (afterwards described as *'the Chapel man**') stepped on to the
F11 140 terrace from what seemed to be a second house at right-angles. ^He
F11 141 told them that the way in was by the entrance court and walked down
F11 142 the French garden with them to an exit in the front drive.
F11 143    |^The visitors then went through the forecourt of the Petit Trianon
F11 144 to the house, where they followed in the wake of a French
F11 145 wedding-party walking arm in arm in a long procession round the rooms.
F11 146 ^They were at the back of the party, too far away from the guide to
F11 147 hear much of his story. ^But they noted that the feeling of depression
F11 148 had passed and that they now felt quite lively.
F11 149    |^Then they drove back to tea at the Ho*?5tel \des Reservoirs in
F11 150 Versailles, and they did not speak of any of the events of the
F11 151 afternoon. ^Because of the wind, Miss Moberly had put on her coat
F11 152 during the drive to the hotel, and as they later returned to Paris by
F11 153 train she noted that *'the setting sun at last burst out from under
F11 154 the clouds.**'
F11 155    |^*'Again and again the thought returned*- was Marie Antoinette
F11 156 much at Trianon, and did she see it for the last time long before the
F11 157 fatal drive to Paris accompanied by the mob?**'
F11 158    |
F11 159    |^That, in plain terms, was the substance of the adventure; and a
F11 160 commonplace experience it would have remained, but for the
F11 161 extraordinary circumstances that followed. ^Although the two women
F11 162 stayed on in Paris for a while, they asserted that they never alluded
F11 163 to that afternoon until, a week afterwards, Miss Moberly was writing a
F11 164 letter to her sister in England and suddenly asked Miss Jourdain if
F11 165 she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted.
F11 166    |^Miss Jourdain promptly answered ~*'Yes,**' and then, for the
F11 167 first time, they became aware that their feelings of depression and
F11 168 anxiety had begun at the same point of their journey. ^Talking it
F11 169 over, they realised for the first time the theatrical appearance of
F11 170 the running man and the inappropriateness of his wrapped cloak on a
F11 171 warm summer afternoon. ^Miss Jourdain also admitted having disliked
F11 172 the thought of passing the seated man at the kiosk.
F11 173    |^On November 10, 1901, three months after the experience, Miss
F11 174 Jourdain was staying with Miss Moberly at Oxford and they returned to
F11 175 the subject, only to discover that Miss Jourdain had not seen the
F11 176 sketching woman. ^Thereupon they resolved to write down separate
F11 177 accounts of the experience to discover how far they had seen the same
F11 178 things. ^These first accounts, both dated November 1901, are still in
F11 179 existence and can be seen at the Bodleian. ^(For convenience they can
F11 180 be referred to as M1 and J1.) ^During November and December they also
F11 181 wrote two more detailed accounts (which will be referred to as M2 and
F11 182 J2) to show to friends. ^These longer accounts were the versions that
F11 183 appeared in their book published in 1911. ^The original documents of
F11 184 M2 and J2 are no longer in existence, having been lost or destroyed
F11 185 after being copied into a manuscript book in 1906.
F11 186    |^It is important to note here that in the autumn of 1901, before
F11 187 either had written down a single word, Miss Moberly had told friends
F11 188 about their *'ghost story.**'

F12   1 **[155 TEXT F12**]
F12   2 *<*4What did you dream last night?*>
F12   3 *<*6A SAUCER OF WEDDING RINGS IS PLACED BEFORE HER*>
F12   4    |^*0Twice in succession I dreamed of a wedding, one of which was
F12   5 most distinct and realistic. ^In my dream, I was married in a small
F12   6 room like a registry office, and a ring was taken from several in a
F12   7 saucer and placed on the table. ^Then my boy friend came in with an
F12   8 open-necked shirt on and hands in his pockets. ^He walked over to me
F12   9 and wanted to know what I was waiting for. ^I picked up the ring,
F12  10 placed it on my finger and said: ^*"People will wonder why I haven't
F12  11 got an engagement ring.**" ^With that we walked out together.*- ^Miss
F12  12 {0C. M.}, Derby.
F12  13    |^*4Explanation*- ^*1You are dissatisfied with your present
F12  14 relationship with your boy friend. ^You are anxious to get married to
F12  15 him. ^Picking at random a ring offered to you out of a saucer
F12  16 indicates you are in too much of a hurry to be married. ^Your boy
F12  17 friend appears so unsuitably dressed because you are not sure whether
F12  18 he is the right man for you. ^Your remark indicates you are uneasy
F12  19 about the way things are at present, but walking out with him shows
F12  20 you are prepared to put up with a lot of trouble just to be in his
F12  21 company.
F12  22    |^*4Advice*- ^You must discuss the whole situation with your boy
F12  23 friend. ^If he does not intend to marry you, then a clean break would
F12  24 be best.
F12  25 *<*6HER DOOR IS BATTERED OPEN*- AND IN WALK TWO BULLS*>
F12  26    |^*0In my dream, two bulls batter upon my door and I have to open
F12  27 it and divide my only loaf of bread equally between them. ^If one gets
F12  28 a larger piece than his companion, he becomes angry. ^Then they drink
F12  29 from a horse-trough and go peacefully away, but I know they will
F12  30 always return. ^My main thought is that I must be nice to them, and
F12  31 not show any preference either way.*- ^Miss {0C. T.}, Essex.
F12  32    |^*4Explanation*- ^*1The two bulls in your dream are men who seek
F12  33 your friendship. ^There are probably two men in your life, and you
F12  34 can't make up your mind which one you would rather have.
F12  35    |^*4Advice*- ^You tend to be slightly immature in your outlook on
F12  36 life. ^Try to be more sincere and serious.
F12  37 *<*6SHE CAN'T ESCAPE THAT VOICE*>
F12  38    |^*0I dreamed I could hear the Voice of Nagging Authority, which
F12  39 blamed me for dressing a two-year-old boy on a very hot day in heavy
F12  40 clothing instead of tussore silk. ^The Voice kept on urging and
F12  41 nagging me to find the lighter dress. ^I am unmarried and in my
F12  42 sixties.*- ^Miss {0M. M.}, Bath.
F12  43    |^*4Explanation*- ^*1The *"Voice of Nagging Authority**" quite
F12  44 likely belongs to your mother. ^She abuses you for being unable to
F12  45 handle a baby and therefore, in her opinion, you are unfit to marry.
F12  46    |^*4Advice*- ^Concentrate on the present. ^Try to forget about your
F12  47 mother's former domineering attitude towards you.
F12  48 *<*4A Belt Filled With Diamonds*>
F12  49    |^*0I dreamed I was in a crowded room. ^In our midst was a woman
F12  50 who has a reputation for going after men. ^My husband walked in
F12  51 carrying a doll made of fur fabric, with a price tag of thirty-five
F12  52 and six attached to it. ^He threw the doll into the lap of the woman,
F12  53 saying that the gift would please her. ^I was furious.
F12  54    |^He tried to calm me, handing over a pink felt belt, with a pin
F12  55 stuck in it. ^I threw it back.
F12  56    |^*"Don't be angry,**" he said. ^*"Your present is more valuable
F12  57 than hers. ^Open it up. ^It's full of diamonds!**"
F12  58    |^I picked up the belt, which fell to the floor, but hesitated to
F12  59 open it. ^Before I came to any decision, I woke up.
F12  60    |^I have been happily married for twenty-one years and love my
F12  61 husband very much.*- ^\0Mrs. {0B. G. H.}, Jersey.
F12  62    |^Explanation*- ^No matter how happily you are married and how much
F12  63 you trust your husband, suspicion, tinged with jealousy, will occur,
F12  64 especially if you love him very much. ^Your dream was caused by the
F12  65 thought that another woman might be able to please your husband more
F12  66 than you could. ^He walks into the room and gives her the doll and you
F12  67 the belt.
F12  68    |^On the surface the doll looks the more valuable item, but your
F12  69 husband tells you the belt is full of diamonds. ^The trouble is you
F12  70 hesitate to open it, fearing that, after all, the diamonds may not be
F12  71 there.
F12  72    |^*4Advice*- ^Despite your happy marriage, you appear to have a
F12  73 shred of distrust toward your husband. ^Search your memory, find the
F12  74 reason for it, tell your husband about it and this slight shadow of
F12  75 suspicion will cease to trouble you.
F12  76 *<*6STRANGE ENCOUNTER WITH A TALKING SNAKE*>
F12  77    |^*0I am shortly to be married and we are going to live in a small
F12  78 house in the country. ^Outside the house there is a water-hole.
F12  79    |^I dreamed my aunt and uncle came to visit us. ^As I was seeing
F12  80 them to their car a great snake rose out of the hole and began to
F12  81 chase us round the field. ^It caught Uncle and squashed him to death.
F12  82 ^Next, it caught hold of my aunt, but I cried out, ^*"Please, snake,
F12  83 don't kill her. ^She is a good woman. ^Take me instead.**" ^*"All
F12  84 right,**" the snake replied. ^*"I only kill wicked people. ^I will
F12  85 guard your house for you on condition that you bake me an apple pie
F12  86 every day.**"
F12  87    |^This I did and the snake and I became friendly, but a week later
F12  88 he said: ^*"The weather's getting chilly now, so I'm going home.**"
F12  89    |^There my dream ended.*- ^Miss \0R., Bolton.
F12  90    |^*4Explanation*- ^*1Your dream concerns your fiance. ^The snake is
F12  91 a symbol of his manliness. ^He wants no interference with the pleasure
F12  92 he enjoys in your company. ^The snake kills your uncle, because he is
F12  93 another man, and lets your aunt go, because she is a woman, and so
F12  94 couldn't become a rival. ^Now you offer yourself to the snake to save
F12  95 your aunt, and the snake becomes your guardian (husband).
F12  96    |^*4Advice*- ^Your dream clearly expresses you have certain doubts
F12  97 about yourself or your fiance, and are afraid that with him you will
F12  98 lead a rather lonely life, and in the end he will get tired of you and
F12  99 leave you. ^Discuss the future fully with him, and then make the final
F12 100 decision.
F12 101 *<*4She Opened Door After Door*>
F12 102    |^*0I dreamed that I saw my friend driving an old car. ^She and the
F12 103 three boy passengers were all wearing crash helmets. ^The car swerved
F12 104 on to the footpath and crashed through the window of a shop. ^No one
F12 105 was hurt. ^My girl friend was taken to a hotel in town and I went to
F12 106 see her as I thought she may have been injured. ^I looked into every
F12 107 room in the hotel but couldn't find her.*- ^Miss \0W., Kilmarnock.
F12 108    |^*4Explanation*- ^*5You envy your girl friend who embarks on
F12 109 adventures with the necessary precautions*- the crash helmets. ^This
F12 110 explains her ability to get out of events in which other girls might
F12 111 get hurt. ^You go to the hotel not to offer sympathy but to ask her
F12 112 how she gets out of her predicaments. ^You can't find her and this
F12 113 shows that you do not fully approve of her behaviour.
F12 114    |^*4Advice*- ^Do not try to model yourself on your girl friend.
F12 115 ^She may seem to be enjoying herself, but in the long run she will
F12 116 regret her recklessness.
F12 117 *<*4An Aeroplane Shoots Her*>
F12 118    |^*0I have had this dream twice recently. ^I am in a grocer's shop
F12 119 and just as I come out I see an aeroplane hovering in the sky.
F12 120 ^Suddenly it starts to fire at me and I am wounded in the left arm.
F12 121    |^I am eighteen. ^Could you please tell me the meaning of this?*-
F12 122 ^\0Mrs. \0W., Scotland.
F12 123    |^Explanation*- ^Your dream indicates a fear that someone might get
F12 124 you involved in some unexpected prank in which you would be the
F12 125 sufferer.
F12 126    |^*4Advice*- ^If there's anyone, friend or relative, who constantly
F12 127 teases you and tries to make you inferior, trying to give you the
F12 128 impression you are too young to be married, stop seeing that person.
F12 129 ^If this is impossible where you live, change your abode. ^If the
F12 130 teaser happens to be your husband, make a solid stand against him and
F12 131 hold your status as a capable wife.
F12 132 *<*4Wants Her Husband*- But Can't Find Him*>
F12 133    |^*0I dreamed I was going with a young woman to see the remains of
F12 134 her old home, which was now a tourist attraction. ^As we turned down a
F12 135 lane, I knew we were going the wrong way.
F12 136    |^Two queer looking animals were chasing each other round a pool,
F12 137 and I was afraid of them. ^I felt very unhappy and wanted to see my
F12 138 husband, but I couldn't think of any excuse to get him down there to
F12 139 see me. ^I knew that the woman, who turned into my sister-in-law,
F12 140 wouldn't understand how I felt about everything. ^I was desperate,
F12 141 because I knew I would have to stay for a holiday.*- ^\0Mrs {0C.
F12 142 T.}, Coventry.
F12 143    |^Explanation*- ^The young woman is trying to lead you astray. ^You
F12 144 follow her despite your knowledge you are doing the wrong thing. ^The
F12 145 queer animals frighten you and you blame your sister-in-law for your
F12 146 troubles. ^You would like to have your husband with you, but he is not
F12 147 coming. ^Therefore, you'll have to spend a holiday with his sister,
F12 148 whom you apparently dislike, or may even despise.
F12 149    |^*4Advice*- ^You are frightened of the influence your
F12 150 sister-in-law has over you, and also object to it. ^In your dream, you
F12 151 tried to get your husband to help you in whatever problem you face in
F12 152 connection with her. ^Do it in real life, too. ^Tell him how you feel
F12 153 about his sister, and if there is a problem, try to solve it together.
F12 154 *<*6*"STOP THAT GIRL!**" THEY SHOUTED*>
F12 155    |^*0I dreamed I was driving a bus along the main road at about
F12 156 eighty miles an hour. ^Then, without warning, I suddenly turned down a
F12 157 side street, causing an accident with another bus coming up behind me.
F12 158 ^When I saw what had happened, I jumped out of my bus and ran for my
F12 159 life down the street. ^I could hear a crowd of people chasing after me
F12 160 shouting: ^*"That's her! ^Stop that girl! ^She's just caused an
F12 161 accident!**"*- ^Miss {0B. I.}, Bradford.
F12 162    |^*4Explanation*- ^*1Driving a vehicle means you have an intense
F12 163 desire to command your own life. ^Driving the bus at a high speed,
F12 164 causing an accident and then trying to escape instead of facing the
F12 165 consequences indicates you could be already involved in an adventure
F12 166 which could have serious and damaging consequences*- not only for
F12 167 yourself, but other people as well.
F12 168    |^*4Advice*- ^If my assumption is correct and you are trying to
F12 169 embark on some sort of an adventure*- it might be a love-affair*- take
F12 170 the dream's warning and don't. ^If the dream is merely an expression
F12 171 of your state of mind, then try to make peace with the world.
F12 172 *<*6ATTRACTIVE STRANGER GIVES HER FLOWERS*>
F12 173    |^*0The man I dream about passes my home every day, but we have
F12 174 only said ~*"Good-morning**" to each other. ^I have two of a family,
F12 175 and my husband is inclined to be very jealous.
F12 176    |^I dreamed my husband and I were at the front door as this man
F12 177 passed by. ^When he saw us, he went across the road and picked some
F12 178 flowers out of a garden. ^He gave my husband some tall, red flowers
F12 179 and me a posy of pansies.*- ^\0Mrs {0C. H.} Somerset.
F12 180    |^*4Explanation*- ^*1You are trying to make amends for your
F12 181 husband's jealousy. ^That's why the stranger strikes up a friendship
F12 182 with you and your husband, and gives flowers to both of you.
F12 183    |^*4Advice*- ^Don't let your husband's jealousy get you down.
F12 184 ^Whenever he has an attack of jealousy, face him squarely and don't
F12 185 let him brow-beat you.
F12 186 *<*6VISITS FAR-AWAY PLACES AS SHE SLEEPS*>
F12 187    |^*0I have dreamed I was in Austria, twice in Germany and once in
F12 188 France.

F13   2 *<*6THE BRITISH WITNESS*>
F13   3 **[EDITORIAL**]
F13   4    |^*"T*2AKE *0the book in your right hand and repeat after me: ^I
F13   5 swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the
F13   6 truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.**"
F13   7    |^You lay the testament on the ledge of the witness-box in front of
F13   8 you. ^The prosecuting advocate rustles through his papers. ^Your mouth
F13   9 feels a little dry. ^Why this sudden feeling of guilt? ^You have done
F13  10 nothing wrong. ^You are doing your duty as a citizen.
F13  11    |^And what is at stake? ^This isn't a murder trial. ^If the
F13  12 motorist is found guilty, he will only suffer a fine. ^Surely no one
F13  13 can question your honest recollection. ^Or can they?
F13  14    |^To the left and slightly above you, the magistrate watches you,
F13  15 reflectively. ^To your right and slightly below you, the defending
F13  16 advocate is watching you with a marked intensity. ^The prosecutor
F13  17 finds the page he wants and clears his throat. ^He, too, looks at you.
F13  18    |^The same question is in the minds of all of them. ^What sort of
F13  19 witness are you going to make? ^They all know, or can guess, roughly
F13  20 what you are going to say. ^The question is: how are you going to say
F13  21 it?
F13  22    |^But, surely, you have only to tell the truth. ^You have sworn to
F13  23 tell the truth. ^You are on your oath.
F13  24    |^Let us face one fact which every lawyer knows, though few will
F13  25 admit it. ^From the point of view of your honesty, that oath is almost
F13  26 irrelevant. ^If you have come to court to lie, you are going to lie
F13  27 whether or not you have sworn on the little black book.
F13  28    |^But the oath has one very useful purpose. ^If you decide to lie,
F13  29 and you are caught out, the fact that you have taken the oath enables
F13  30 the police to charge you with perjury. ^And then you will pay dearly
F13  31 for it.
F13  32 *<*4False evidence*>
F13  33    |^*0This is unlikely, especially in a small case. ^When two honest
F13  34 witnesses give diametrically opposite accounts of the same event, how
F13  35 can anyone prove that the evidence you gave was deliberately false?
F13  36    |^The liar is the person the advocate dreads least. ^He is the
F13  37 easiest to spot, the easiest to trap.
F13  38    |^One little slip, and you will have to start inventing lies on
F13  39 your feet, to cover up that slip. ^And that will involve you in
F13  40 another lie*- and another*- and another.
F13  41    |^If the advocate knows his job, you will suddenly wake up to find
F13  42 the fifth or sixth lie directly contradicts the first or second. ^And
F13  43 then you've had it.
F13  44    |^There are few instances of deliberate perjury*- at least in minor
F13  45 cases. ^Looking back over more than two thousand cases, I don't think
F13  46 I ever came across more than a dozen liars*- real liars, who gave a
F13  47 deliberately false account of certain facts.
F13  48    |^But among the thousands I have cross-examined, I have heard many
F13  49 patently wrong accounts of incidents given in all honesty. ^And in
F13  50 only a few instances have I been able to convince the witness in the
F13  51 box that his recollection must have been mistaken.
F13  52    |^The British witness is, with few exceptions, basically honest.
F13  53 ^And yet in almost every case witnesses conflict completely.
F13  54    |^How can this be? ^Simply because everyone sees an incident from
F13  55 his own point of view. ^His true recollection of any set of facts will
F13  56 really consist of a series of isolated flashes of sight or sound. ^His
F13  57 imagination will then set to work to connect up those flashes.
F13  58    |^This process is inevitable. ^The human mind simply will not
F13  59 tolerate a series of unconnected incidents. ^It will arrange them to
F13  60 fit in with a person's experience, his ideas, his prejudices.
F13  61    |^When his mind has done this work, all in an instant of time, the
F13  62 result will be that person's absolutely honest recollection of the
F13  63 incident.
F13  64    |^And it may be totally different from what actually happened.
F13  65    |^Considering this, it is sometimes terrifying to realize the
F13  66 importance attached to the British witness. ^The fallibility of the
F13  67 honest recollection is fearful! ^Give me skidmarks, fingerprints,
F13  68 circumstantial evidence, every time!
F13  69    |^These things are all capable of explanation, of interpretation,
F13  70 but they cannot give the same kind of totally false picture that can
F13  71 be given in absolute honesty by a sincere and truthful witness.
F13  72 *<*4Put to the test*>
F13  73    |^*0The responsibility of the advocate in court rests upon the
F13  74 importance of every witness's honest recollection being fully tested.
F13  75 ^When a man comes before a court charged with, say, driving
F13  76 dangerously, what it really means is that *"in the opinion of a number
F13  77 of witnesses, whom you will see and hear, he was driving
F13  78 dangerously.**"
F13  79    |^And all those who are called by the prosecution are already
F13  80 committed to the opinion that he was, while those called by the
F13  81 defence are already committed to the opposite opinion.
F13  82    |^If a witness can be persuaded by an advocate in cross-examination
F13  83 that his honest, preconceived opinion must have been wrong, then that
F13  84 witness's side of the case suffers a major blow.
F13  85    |^That is why the defending advocate is watching you at this moment
F13  86 with such intensity. ^He is trying to read your mind, to understand
F13  87 your prejudices, to assess your qualities of reason and of
F13  88 reasonableness.
F13  89    |^The first part of your appearance in the box is simple. ^The
F13  90 prosecuting advocate is on your side. ^He has your statement before
F13  91 him. ^He knows what you are going to say. ^He only has to make sure
F13  92 you say it all.
F13  93 *<*4Steel yourself*>
F13  94    |^*0At the same time his object, if he is worth his salt, is to put
F13  95 you at your ease in the box.
F13  96    |^Then the prosecutor sits down and the defence advocate rises to
F13  97 cross-examine you. ^This is your moment of truth. ^You steel yourself,
F13  98 mentally. ^You are ready to anticipate every question as an attack on
F13  99 your honesty.
F13 100    |^But it is not. ^All that is likely to be questioned is your
F13 101 accuracy. ^The opening questions will very probably be polite,
F13 102 respectful, soothing. ^The advocate wants your co-operation. ^Time
F13 103 enough for him to attack, if he fails in this.
F13 104    |^He wants you to relax, to rethink the incident with him, calmly,
F13 105 logically*- and from his client's standpoint.
F13 106    |^He will already have decided the point upon which he thinks you
F13 107 are most easily open to persuasion.
F13 108    |^He is not seeking information*- that is the last thing he wants.
F13 109 ^He will never ask you a single question to which he is not pretty
F13 110 sure in advance of your answer.
F13 111    |^I recall a matrimonial case of some ten years ago when I did not
F13 112 follow this principle.
F13 113    |^I was appearing for the husband, an unhappy-looking wretch,
F13 114 battered and bruised after the physical attack which had come as the
F13 115 climax of years of bullying treatment from the huge, muscular female
F13 116 who now glared at me from the witness-box.
F13 117    |^The visual contrast was too much for me.
F13 118    |^*"Madam,**" I said, pointing out my cringing client, *"are you
F13 119 telling the court that this poor little physical wreck attacked you in
F13 120 the way you have described?**"
F13 121    |^She snorted. ^*"He wasn't a physical wreck until after he
F13 122 attacked me in the way I have described,**" she said.
F13 123    |^And my case never recovered.
F13 124 *<*4It's Lawrence, {0Q.C.}*- *5this time for the *6PROSECUTION*>
F13 125 *<BY GORDON THOMAS*>
F13 126    |*5What makes a shy*- even colourless*- little man a great criminal
F13 127 lawyer?
F13 128    |
F13 129    |^*6T*2HE *0slightly built Queen's Counsel rustles his
F13 130 newly-laundered gown and settles his bobbed wig more firmly on his
F13 131 brow.
F13 132    |^And in the hushed, expectant courtroom, everyone leans forward to
F13 133 catch and savour his opening words.
F13 134    |^This will be the scene at Lewes Assizes as Frederick Geoffrey
F13 135 Lawrence, {0Q.C.}, steps forward for the first time as Crown Counsel
F13 136 in a murder case.
F13 137    |^In the dock, on trial for their lives, will be three youths,
F13 138 accused of shooting down an unarmed guard in the Worthing Bank Raid.
F13 139    |^For a minute the gentle-looking barrister will peer owlishly
F13 140 around him, taking in the jury, the defendants and spectators.
F13 141    |^Then, in his soft, level voice, he will reveal once more the
F13 142 eloquent gift that has made him one of the ablest advocates in British
F13 143 legal history.
F13 144    |^It is a gift that will face its sternest test during the Worthing
F13 145 shooting case. ^For Lawrence is returning to the criminal bar after an
F13 146 absence of two years.
F13 147    |^Since 1958, his position as vice-chairman of the Bar Council and
F13 148 his work in the High Court*- and elsewhere*- have kept him busy. ^But
F13 149 now he is returning to the most dramatic legal arena of all*- the
F13 150 murder court.
F13 151 *<*4Controlled logic*>
F13 152    |^*0Shy and retiring, Lawrence is often dismissed as *"not really
F13 153 worth his reputation.**" ^But a number of unhappy people have found
F13 154 this sneer to be untrue*- usually they are driven off to prison.
F13 155    |^Not so long ago, Lawrence's name meant little to those who hadn't
F13 156 seen it beside the entrance to his chambers in the Temple. ^Then one
F13 157 day this little man*- five feet five inches of controlled logic*- rose
F13 158 to his feet to defend \0Dr. John Bodkin Adams, accused at the Old
F13 159 Bailey of poisoning one of his patients.
F13 160    |^It was one of the most sensational murder trials of the century.
F13 161    |^The defence had picked Lawrence, a *"nobody**" in criminal
F13 162 matters, because he was a barrister with a great knowledge of forensic
F13 163 medicine.
F13 164    |^For forty hours of relentless questioning, the gentle-voiced
F13 165 advocate picked expert holes in the prosecution's case. ^Finally,
F13 166 after a trial lasting seventeen days, he succeeded in getting the
F13 167 Eastbourne doctor acquitted. ^For Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence, it was
F13 168 a famous victory.
F13 169    |^In those seventeen days he had earned himself more fame than in
F13 170 twenty years at the Bar.
F13 171    |^Lawrence learned his craft as counsel in divorce and
F13 172 breach-of-promise cases.
F13 173    |^His grasp of statistics made him a *"natural**" for the arid work
F13 174 of Ministerial inquiries and Parliamentary committees. ^It also
F13 175 brought him in about *+10,000 a year*- a figure trebled since he
F13 176 *"arrived.**"
F13 177    |^Lawrence almost bloomed in the dusty atmosphere of the
F13 178 law-courts, avoiding histrionics, surviving with a stubborn,
F13 179 hard-working desire to get at the truth.
F13 180 *<*4Nothing obvious*>
F13 181    |^*0The Adams case was typical. ^He put in four months of solid
F13 182 pre-trial work*- long hours of study, stretching into the small hours.
F13 183 ^And the same kind of groundwork has gone into the Worthing case.
F13 184    |^But expect no *1obvious *0tricks from Lawrence at Lewes Assizes.
F13 185    |^He doesn't shout or thump law books as Marshall Hall did. ^He
F13 186 doesn't need a gold pencil, like Birkett, to mesmerize a witness. ^He
F13 187 lacks the pungent Irish humour of Edward Carson.
F13 188    |^Instead he has his own special tricks.
F13 189    |^He approaches a witness with his eyes blinking furiously. ^His
F13 190 modulated voice puts them at ease. ^The shy type he gently prods with:
F13 191 ^*"Please, I am only trying to get at the truth. ^Try and help.**"
F13 192    |^The reluctant he *"persuades**" with logic. ^And the arrogant,
F13 193 the liars, the *"go-to-hell**" brigade, soon find themselves in an
F13 194 uncomfortable hell of their own making.
F13 195    |^All eyes will watch him as he opens the prosecution in the
F13 196 Worthing case. ^Already his success has led the pundits at the Royal
F13 197 Courts of Justice to predict that he will become a judge and earn a
F13 198 knighthood.
F13 199    |^Every word and gesture he makes at Lewes Assizes will be weighed
F13 200 and noted.
F13 201    |^And in the Cock Tavern, across the road from the Royal Courts,
F13 202 barristers, solicitors and their clerks will be asking each other:
F13 203 ^Will this be Lawrence's trial?
F13 204    |^But that is a question that only a jury can answer.

F14   2 *<*6THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL FORECASTS...*>
F14   3 *<*6ONE OF THESE MARRIAGES WILL FAIL*>
F14   4 *<*4But four happy couples say he's talking nonsense*>
F14   5 *<*0by *2DIANA NORMAN*>
F14   6    |^*4P*2EOPLE *0disapprove of teenagers marrying. ^They shake their
F14   7 heads and say: ^*"They're too young.**"
F14   8    |^They point to official statistics which show that one out of four
F14   9 girls who marry between 16 and 18 ends up in the divorce court. ^And
F14  10 they say: ^*"That proves it.**" ^But does it?
F14  11    |^To find out, I travelled all over the country, meeting couples
F14  12 who married very young. ^None of them was newly married. ^Most had
F14  13 been married for between two to six years.
F14  14    |^I am going to tell you the stories of four such couples. ^If the
F14  15 Registrar General, who compiles national statistics of births, deaths
F14  16 and marriages is right, one of them will be in the divorce court
F14  17 within the next 20 years.
F14  18    |^All of them have encountered greater hardship than most couples
F14  19 who wait until they are older before marrying. ^Almost all have had to
F14  20 face the suspicion that they *1had *0to get married, although it was
F14  21 untrue.
F14  22    |^They have come up against parental disapproval, and landladies
F14  23 who wanted to see their marriage lines before offering them
F14  24 accommodation. ^They have all had to raise children on small wages.
F14  25    |^Take, for instance, the case of the Annandales who were married
F14  26 six and a half years ago, when Brian was 17, and Pam 16. ^Now they
F14  27 have a nice home in Germany, where 23-year-old Brian, a regular in the
F14  28 {0RAF}, is stationed. ^They have a car and Pat has a fur coat.
F14  29    |^But less than four years ago they went hungry in order that their
F14  30 baby, David, would have food.
F14  31    |^They told me about it recently when Brian was on leave and they
F14  32 were staying with Pam's parents in Francis-road, Ashford, Kent.
F14  33    |^Brian was then a National Serviceman, getting just under *+5 a
F14  34 week.
F14  35    |^He found that, because he was under 21, the {0RAF} would not
F14  36 give him and Pam married quarters.
F14  37    |^Nor*- again because he was a minor*- would they grant him the
F14  38 guinea a week extra normally given to married men in the {0RAF} who
F14  39 have to pay their own rent.
F14  40    |^*"It was a very bad time,**" said Brian. ^*"It could have caused
F14  41 a split between us. ^But, luckily, it brought us closer together.**"
F14  42    |^He added: ^*"We realise now that we took a terrific risk,
F14  43 marrying so young. ^But when our parents pointed this out to us before
F14  44 we married, we thought they were wrong.**"
F14  45    |^Brian and Pam went to the same junior school in Ashford. ^And
F14  46 Brian smilingly recalled: ^*"I couldn't stand the sight of her
F14  47 then.**"
F14  48 *<*2TAKE-OVER*>
F14  49    |^*0They met again when Brian was in the local cycle speedway team,
F14  50 and Pam, at 15, was going out with his team captain.
F14  51    |^*"Within a week I had accidentally crashed into the captain on
F14  52 the track, broken his arm, taken over his position as captain and
F14  53 taken his girl away from him,**" grinned Brian. ^*"He was best man at
F14  54 our wedding...**"
F14  55    |^Neither Brian nor Pam can tell you the exact moment when they
F14  56 decided to get married*- *"it was just an understanding between us.**"
F14  57    |^Proposals are rare among teenagers. ^Nearly all say: ^*"We just
F14  58 knew we were going to marry*- that's all.**"
F14  59    |^Pam told me: ^*"We came up against a terrific amount of
F14  60 suspicion. ^Suspicion that we had *1had *0to get married. ^Even though
F14  61 our baby arrived two years after our wedding, some people still think
F14  62 that he was the reason for our early marriage.**"
F14  63    |^Brian agreed that the dice are loaded against teenage marriages.
F14  64    |^*"We refused to borrow money from our parents during those
F14  65 difficult times. ^We thought we'd save rent by buying a caravan on
F14  66 {0HP}.
F14  67    |^*"But, because we were both under 21, the firm refused to sell to
F14  68 us. ^In the end we had to buy it in Pam's father's name.**"
F14  69    |^Despite the travelling Brian has done since he joined the
F14  70 {0RAF}, Pam has managed to go with him almost everywhere. ^In fact,
F14  71 she told me: ^*"In the six years of our marriage, I've been away from
F14  72 him only for about three months.**"
F14  73    |^Do they quarrel? ^*"Of course,**" said Brian. ^*"Like mad
F14  74 sometimes...**" ^But he added: ^*"We never row in front of David.
F14  75    |^*"We have a really happy marriage. ^The months I spent apart from
F14  76 Pam were the most miserable of my life.**"
F14  77    |^*1Well, that's the Annandales. ^I'd risk a large bet that it
F14  78 won't be their marriage which ends in failure.
F14  79 *<*2SCARCE*>
F14  80    |^*0And so to the Bowketts... ^In the two years they've been
F14  81 married, Keith Bowkett and his pretty, fair-haired wife, Violet*-
F14  82 they're both 18*- haven't lived together at all.
F14  83    |^The housing shortage and scarcity of flats in their home town of
F14  84 Pontardawe, near Swansea, South Wales, have forced Violet to go on
F14  85 living with her parents, sister and three brothers at their home in
F14  86 Holly-street*- although she is now a married woman with a small baby.
F14  87 ^Keith, whom she married on her 16th birthday, lives with his parents
F14  88 a short distance away, just as he did when he was a schoolboy.
F14  89    |^They meet each other whenever Keith's job as a collier on shift
F14  90 work will allow them to.
F14  91    |^They sit in one or other of their parents' homes watching
F14  92 television. ^Or they hold hands in the pictures or go for walks.
F14  93    |^And at night they kiss each other goodbye and then go back to
F14  94 their respective homes.
F14  95    |^*"We thought we would be able to find a place, but we haven't,**"
F14  96 said Violet, bluntly.
F14  97    |^*"Both our parents' houses are too small to let us have a bedroom
F14  98 of our own. ^We're on the council's waiting list, but I've known
F14  99 people around here who have waited nearly ten years to be given a
F14 100 house.
F14 101    |^*"Flats are scarce and expensive, and landlords don't want you if
F14 102 you've got a baby.**"
F14 103    |^Keith and Violet, like Brian and Pam Annandale, and so many other
F14 104 youngsters, met at school and began courting at 15. ^They insisted on
F14 105 marrying as soon as Violet was legally old enough*- 16. ^Violet's
F14 106 parents were against the marriage. ^Her mother, 40-year-old \0Mrs.
F14 107 Pearl Epps, said: ^*"I didn't want Violet to marry so young, but when
F14 108 youngsters make up their minds you can't stop them.
F14 109    |^*"So I made up my mind to make the best of it and gave them a
F14 110 nice wedding reception here at home.
F14 111 **[END QUOTE**]
F14 112 *<*2HEARTBREAK*>
F14 113    |^*0*"Sometimes when I see Violet looking after her baby, Steven,
F14 114 and remember it was only a short time ago that she was a baby herself,
F14 115 it nearly breaks my heart.
F14 116    |^*"She has no idea of the cost of things, because she's never had
F14 117 a home of her own to run. ^But I must say she's making a good job of
F14 118 bringing up Steven.**"
F14 119    |^People have told Violet that she deserves better, and that
F14 120 because Keith hasn't provided her with a home, she has grounds for
F14 121 divorce.
F14 122    |^But Violet just pushes back her long hair and hugs Steven even
F14 123 closer. ^*"Maybe Keith hasn't been quite as responsible as he
F14 124 should,**" she told me.
F14 125    |^*"But if I had my time over again, I'd marry him just the same*-
F14 126 although perhaps not quite so early.
F14 127    |^*"He'll find a home for me one of these days.**" she added
F14 128 resolutely. ^*"And I'll stick by him.**"
F14 129    |^*1If love, loyalty and courage count for anything, it won't be
F14 130 Violet's marriage that will break up.
F14 131    |^*0Perhaps Pat Cane, 17, and her 23-year-old husband, Tom, are a
F14 132 bit luckier. ^At least they have a *1room *0to themselves, with a cot
F14 133 in it for their seven-month-old daughter, Michel.
F14 134 *<*2DIVIDED*>
F14 135    |^*0The room is in a council flat at Tulse Hill, in South London*-
F14 136 the home of Pat's parents.
F14 137    |^The other three bedrooms in the flat are divided among Pat's
F14 138 parents and seven of her ten brothers and sisters. ^Quite a crowd, eh?
F14 139    |^*"We've tried to find a place of our own.**" said Pat, who also
F14 140 married on her 16th birthday.
F14 141    |^*"In fact, recently we left here for a flat that Tom had found
F14 142 for us. ^But the landlady was terribly bossy*- they can be you know*-
F14 143 and kept hinting that we weren't married.
F14 144    |^*"Eventually I showed her my marriage lines. ^But she said they
F14 145 were probably forged.
F14 146    |^*"So we moved back with Mum, who's been very kind, and we're now
F14 147 trying to find somewhere else.**"
F14 148    |^Tom, a *+12-a-week decorator, met Pat over two years ago.
F14 149    |^*"I asked her to go to the pictures with me.**" said Tom. ^*"The
F14 150 film was *1Look Back in Anger, *0but *2WE *0haven't*- not once.
F14 151    |^*"When we decided to get married, Pat's parents didn't object at
F14 152 all. ^Pat's mum was only 17 when she married, and has been happy ever
F14 153 since.
F14 154    |^*"But my mother was very opposed to the marriage. ^She even
F14 155 refused to come to the wedding.**"
F14 156    |^Pat, taking up the story, said ^*"I didn't like Tom being
F14 157 *'estranged**' from his mother, so when Michel was born, I took the
F14 158 baby round to show her, and tried to make things up between them. ^The
F14 159 moment she saw Michel she *'came round**'. ^Now we get on very
F14 160 well.**"
F14 161    |^Pat's mother, 42-year-old \0Mrs. Lille Barnham, told me: ^*"I
F14 162 can't think why people are so down on teenage marriages, and try to
F14 163 wreck them.
F14 164    |^*"If girls are as sensible as Pat, who helped bring up her young
F14 165 brothers and sisters, I can't see any objection to their marrying when
F14 166 they like.**"
F14 167    |^*1Surely it won't be Tom and Pat Cane who break up.
F14 168    |^*0Then there are the Bandeys of Wandsworth, London.
F14 169    |^Alice Bandey, age 17, was expecting her first baby in six weeks
F14 170 when I saw her.
F14 171    |^And she and her 17-year-old husband, Michael, whom she married
F14 172 just over a year ago, were going to have to find another place to
F14 173 live.
F14 174    |^Their present two-room flat they knew wouldn't be suitable when
F14 175 the baby arrived, because a child might disturb the other tenants.
F14 176    |^They'd already had to leave one flat because the landlady learned
F14 177 of the expected baby. ^Michael, who works in a banana-packing
F14 178 warehouse, earns *+7 10\0s. a week, from which, when I saw them, they
F14 179 were paying *+3 10\0s. a week rent.
F14 180    |^They had no honeymoon*- couldn't afford it*- and the last new
F14 181 dress Alice had was for her wedding.
F14 182    |^Yet, despite their money and home-hunting problems, they are
F14 183 happy.
F14 184    |^Alice, an orphan, met Michael at school. ^They started courting
F14 185 at 14, and at 15 decided to get married as soon as they were of age.
F14 186    |^*"I never thought of marrying anybody else,**" said Alice. ^*"And
F14 187 I don't think I've missed anything.**" ^Michael said: ^*"I reckon I've
F14 188 got the perfect wife. ^She's always here when I get home; always kind,
F14 189 and cheerful*- and a lovely cook.**"
F14 190    |^But he added: ^*"Marriage certainly isn't a bed of roses*-

F15   2 *<*4The United Kingdom and the European Common Market*>
F15   3 *<*5Background to negotiations*>
F15   4 *<*4By *6ROY SHERWOOD*>
F15   5    |^*6W*2ITH *0the exception only of matters of direct bearing on
F15   6 peace or early war, no issue of the present moment is of as
F15   7 far-reaching importance for Britain's, the Commonwealth's, and the
F15   8 whole West's future as the question whether the United Kingdom will
F15   9 join the European Common Market.
F15  10    |^It is not a question to be decided on nationalistic or political
F15  11 party feelings, and no reasonably objective opinion, one way or the
F15  12 other, is likely to be arrived at without going through the process
F15  13 known to the writing world as beginning with Adam and Eve.
F15  14    |^What that means in this case is going back to the war years, when
F15  15 the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland were in exile in
F15  16 London and had every reason to be so concerned about the
F15  17 precariousness of their post-war prospects that they organised a
F15  18 careful experts' study of the subject.
F15  19    |^The outcome, based on the realisation that their chance of
F15  20 economic recovery and their ability to make themselves heard in
F15  21 international politics was desperately poor if taken singly, and
F15  22 decidedly better if they could act in unison, was the agreement to
F15  23 join their three countries in a union to be called Benelux*- in which
F15  24 we can now recognise the beginning of all endeavours to unify Western
F15  25 Europe. ^And here we shall do well to note, as throwing a first
F15  26 sidelight on the much bigger problems connected with the European
F15  27 Common Market and the question whether the United Kingdom will be wise
F15  28 in joining it, that today, 16 years after the first measures were
F15  29 taken to establish Benelux, the complete union aimed at between
F15  30 Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland has not yet been fully achieved.
F15  31    |^But in spite of early and subsequent difficulties and
F15  32 complications, Benelux progress was sufficiently striking to activate
F15  33 the ideas on European unity long held by many economists and a number
F15  34 of politicians. ^Even Winston Churchill, arch-priest of British
F15  35 Commonwealth greatness and independence, spoke as early as in 1946 of
F15  36 the desirability of creating a kind of United States of Europe, of
F15  37 which it seems however reasonable to suppose that he envisaged them as
F15  38 an extension of the Commonwealth under British leadership; and in
F15  39 France General \de Gaulle, then still deeply distrustful of Germany,
F15  40 also held views favourable to European unification. ^His, not
F15  41 unnaturally, differed however from Churchill's in two important
F15  42 points: the \de Gaulle conception of that time was a Western European
F15  43 community, largely defensive against the possibility of German
F15  44 resurgence, and therefore without German participation, and not under
F15  45 British but under French leadership.
F15  46    |^It can be seen from this that there were even at that time not
F15  47 only two but actually three different attitudes to unification*- that
F15  48 of those who thought mainly in economics, of those who thought in
F15  49 politics, and of those who thought almost exclusively in military
F15  50 values.
F15  51    |^World events have forced the various proponents of these
F15  52 attitudes to modify their ideas and aims in a number of particulars,
F15  53 in addition to which there has occurred one vital change in the
F15  54 situation: the Franco-German rapprochement, which has resulted in
F15  55 Britain becoming an outsider to the extent of no longer being
F15  56 indispensable in plans for Western European unification. ^While on
F15  57 this subject, it is of paramount importance for the people of the
F15  58 United Kingdom to realise that the dominant position held for
F15  59 centuries by this country in world affairs, due to the ability to
F15  60 throw its weight against whichever nation on the continent was growing
F15  61 too powerful for our comfort, is a thing of the past. ^The traditional
F15  62 balance of power policy is dead beyond hope of resurrection.
F15  63    |^In reviewing the various steps towards European unification it is
F15  64 useful to make passing reference to the failure of the European
F15  65 Defence Community ({0*2EDC}). ^*0At first fervently advocated by the
F15  66 French, who saw in it a means of making use of West Germany's
F15  67 potential military strength under strict external supervision, it was
F15  68 categorically rejected by them two years later, in 1952. ^The point is
F15  69 of importance because it shows that unification must be on a wider
F15  70 than a purely military basis. ^Nor can it be*- and this is one of the
F15  71 difficulties*- solely economic; whether the contractants want it so or
F15  72 not, it must also become political. ^And this is the second, mainly
F15  73 psychological, point of difficulty in Britain's incorporation in
F15  74 European unification.
F15  75    |^Turning to less abortive attempts towards European unity*- which
F15  76 were, incidentally, inspired by growing fear of Russia*- the first was
F15  77 the {0US}-initiated Organisation for European Economic Co-operation
F15  78 ({0*2OEEC}). ^*0It came into existence as early as 1948 in
F15  79 connection with the effort to make the best possible use of American
F15  80 Marshal Aid; and it led, in its turn, to the creation of the European
F15  81 Payments Union, the existence of which more than one Western European
F15  82 country has to thank for successfully surviving periods of heavy
F15  83 excess of external payments over from-abroad revenues without coming
F15  84 to financial grief.
F15  85    |^Next, and for the first time bringing the six countries together
F15  86 which now constitute the European Common Market, came the European
F15  87 Coal and Steel Community, uniting the three Benelux nations, France
F15  88 and Italy with West Germany. ^The underlying motive in this case was
F15  89 the same which had prompted France's first enthusiasm for the
F15  90 subsequently rejected European Defence Community: fear of German
F15  91 resurgence, specifically of the high potential of the Ruhr area. ^With
F15  92 it, something new entered upon the political scene. ^Control over the
F15  93 organisation was not vested in an international body subject to any of
F15  94 the participating countries' veto, but to a supra-national authority
F15  95 entrusted with power to make and to enforce decisions.
F15  96    |^Even during the two years while France was keen on the concept of
F15  97 the European Defence Community, Britain had disliked the implied
F15  98 necessity of a measure of surrender of sovereignty. ^Although these
F15  99 feelings were not openly expressed, there is little doubt that the
F15 100 failure of this particular idea can be attributed in the main to
F15 101 British unwillingness to accept French leadership (while France
F15 102 advocated the creation of the community) and to French unwillingness
F15 103 to go on with it when it became obvious that the community would come
F15 104 into existence only if France accepted to play second fiddle.
F15 105    |^Coal and steel production being not *1directly *0military
F15 106 matters, and France being moreover the biggest of the six contracting
F15 107 parties, acceptance of a supra-national authority did not in this case
F15 108 offend French susceptibilities. ^On the contrary, Paris was right in
F15 109 seeing in the creation of the community the welcome gain of control
F15 110 over German coal and steel production. ^As for Britain, she had
F15 111 cold-shouldered the plan from the first days of its conception by \0M.
F15 112 Jean Monnet. ^The cold-shouldering was done by a Labour Government,
F15 113 but the Conservatives were all in favour of it and of a generally
F15 114 welcoming attitude to European integration*- as long as they were the
F15 115 opposition party. ^Another dividing factor between this country and
F15 116 its continental wartime allies and associates was atomic research.
F15 117    |^So, while the United Kingdom, having become an atomic power,
F15 118 pursued its own version of European unification endeavour through the
F15 119 Western European Union*- a substitute for the rejected European
F15 120 Defence Community created rather in haste under the threat of an
F15 121 American *"re-appraisal**" of Washington policy with regard to the
F15 122 wartime allies*- and by means of the Maudling Committee, the six
F15 123 nations of the Coal and Steel Community drew closer together. ^They
F15 124 combined their atomic efforts in {0*2EURATOM} *0and signed the Rome
F15 125 Treaty, thereby laying down the principles of the European Common
F15 126 Market.
F15 127    |^In self defence, Britain took the lead in creating {0*2EFTA},
F15 128 *0the European Free Trade Association. ^This completed the split, and
F15 129 whether looked at from the viewpoint of that time or of the present,
F15 130 it can be seen to have been inevitable. ^None of the continental
F15 131 countries had its freedom of action limited by the kind of obligations
F15 132 imposed on Britain by the British Commonwealth, and the United Kingdom
F15 133 could not disregard them.
F15 134    |^With 378 pages in the English text, the treaty governing the
F15 135 Common Market is obviously too long for detailed study here. ^It is
F15 136 divided into six chapters the last two of which, concerned with
F15 137 organisational matters, protocol, \0etc., are of little interest to
F15 138 this study. ^The first chapter states the aim of establishing
F15 139 *"harmonious development**" and a common market, and of
F15 140 *"progressively approximating the economic policies of the member
F15 141 states.**" ^Part *=2 provides for a customs union, the abolition of
F15 142 internal tariffs and quotas, a common agricultural policy, freedom of
F15 143 movement for persons, services and capital, and a harmonised transport
F15 144 system. ^The third chapter lays down common rules of competition,
F15 145 deals with the co-ordination of economic policies, harmonised features
F15 146 of social policy and the establishment of a European Investment Bank.
F15 147 ^Chapter *=4 associates former and present colonial territories of the
F15 148 six parties with the Community. ^No further explanations are needed to
F15 149 realise the closeness of the association and to gain a first
F15 150 impression of the difficulty of fitting the United Kingdom into it.
F15 151    |^For the benefit of those who are not studious readers of
F15 152 international developments it may be useful to begin by recalling the
F15 153 names of the countries composing the {0*2EFTA}. ^*0They are: the
F15 154 United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Portugal and
F15 155 Switzerland. ^And we may also note that from the first day onwards of
F15 156 talk about Western European unification British thinking always went
F15 157 along the lines of trying to create a great area of unrestricted
F15 158 trading; but this conception did not include agriculture nor any of
F15 159 the other *"harmonisations**" of internal policies aimed at by the
F15 160 nations which finalised their decisions in the Rome Treaty.
F15 161    |^In spite of the fact that the British attitude has become
F15 162 modified to some extent on the subject of agriculture, it is not
F15 163 difficult to see that the difference between the two conceptions
F15 164 remains very great. ^And if there were room here for a detailed
F15 165 consideration of all that is implied in the provisions of parts *=2
F15 166 and *=3 of the Rome Treaty, it would quickly become evident that the
F15 167 difficulties of bringing the two conceptions together are even greater
F15 168 than appears at first sight.
F15 169    |^Part *=4 makes matters even worse. ^The United Kingdom, even if
F15 170 it wanted to, has no power or authority to commit the countries of the
F15 171 Commonwealth to anything; and the mere mention of internal
F15 172 Commonwealth differences in wages and living standards, levels of
F15 173 productivity, of educational and technological attainment, and of the
F15 174 problems involved in the provisions of the second chapter of the Rome
F15 175 Treaty is sufficient to show that those who declare British membership
F15 176 of the European Common Market to be incompatible with continuance of
F15 177 the British Commonwealth are not completely mad. ^Yet a solution must
F15 178 somehow be found if Western Europe is not to be split into two
F15 179 competitive camps, with every prospect of growing rivalry.
F15 180    |^After protracted endeavours to find one or another kind of basis
F15 181 of negotiation, the present situation is that the Common Market and
F15 182 the Free Trade Association*- though neither of them as yet fully
F15 183 operative*- face one another as not too friendly strangers. ^Many
F15 184 people even in Britain think that this is largely our own fault,
F15 185 because we have never at any time been decisive or one-minded in our
F15 186 attitude, vacillating between *"come and tempt me**" and *"only on my
F15 187 special terms.**"
F15 188    |^On the continental side, as was and is to be expected, France
F15 189 attaches least, and Holland most, importance to bringing the Common
F15 190 Market and the Free Trade Association together in one unit. ^With
F15 191 productivity rising faster in the Common Market countries than in
F15 192 Britain, and Britain's prospects for the future, moreover, adversely
F15 193 influenced as the provisions of the Rome Treaty will become effective,
F15 194 it has recently become necessary for the United Kingdom to take the
F15 195 initiative towards unambiguous negotiation with the Six, the first
F15 196 step in this direction being, as circumstances will have it, a plain
F15 197 application for membership. ^This, let it be recalled, was made at
F15 198 Brussels on August 10, and on the same day Denmark also applied.

F16   3 **[EDITORIAL**]
F16   4    |^T*2HE *0term *"Merger**" in London Labour circles does not refer
F16   5 to financial alliances or newspaper closures, it refers to the joining
F16   6 of Middlesex with London in the London Labour Party back in 1951.
F16   7    |^Prior to 1951, the Middlesex constituency Labour Parties were
F16   8 organised in the Southern Region of the Labour Party. ^The London
F16   9 Labour Party concerned itself only with the Administrative County of
F16  10 London.
F16  11    |^At a Special Conference of the London Labour Party held on
F16  12 December 21, 1950, it was agreed by a large majority that Middlesex,
F16  13 if it so wished, should in future be associated with the London Labour
F16  14 Party. ^With only two dissentients the Middlesex Parties supported the
F16  15 proposed merger at a further Conference held on January 30, 1951.
F16  16    |^The Rules and Standing Orders of the Party were amended to meet
F16  17 the new situation. ^Special provision was made to preserve certain
F16  18 rights for Middlesex on purely Middlesex matters.
F16  19    |^At the Annual Conference, the delegates representing Middlesex
F16  20 Parties held a special voting card and certain issues were discussed
F16  21 and decided only by the Middlesex Parties. ^A Middlesex County
F16  22 Committee was set up as a sub-committee of the Executive.
F16  23 *<*4Teething troubles*>
F16  24    |^*0The merger brought its problems. ^No one would deny that. ^But
F16  25 gradually the teething troubles abated and by 1960, the Executive went
F16  26 to Annual Conference with successful proposals to amend again the
F16  27 Rules and Standing Orders which governed voting procedure.
F16  28    |^The special provisions which allowed for the Conference to be
F16  29 split up (not split) into London and Middlesex sections, were swept
F16  30 away. ^The Party in London and Middlesex had become pretty well
F16  31 integrated.
F16  32    |^In 1958, arising from the Wilson Committee on Party Organisation,
F16  33 a proposal was put forward by the National Executive Committee to set
F16  34 up a Regional Council for the \0Beds, \0Bucks, \0Berks, \0Herts,
F16  35 Middlesex and Oxfordshire area.
F16  36    |^Middlesex Parties would be severed from London and become part of
F16  37 a new set-up.
F16  38    |^At the 44th London Labour Party Conference in 1958, a motion
F16  39 tabled by the Enfield Labour Party was carried as follows:*-
F16  40 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
F16  41    |^*1*"This Conference urges upon the National Executive Committee
F16  42 that no useful purpose would be served by the severing of Middlesex
F16  43 Parties from the London Labour Party.**"
F16  44 **[END INDENTATION**]
F16  45    |^*0Now it is significant that this motion was tabled by a Party
F16  46 which lies on the most northerly extremity of Middlesex and borders on
F16  47 to Hertfordshire.
F16  48    |^The London Labour Party and the constituency Labour Parties in
F16  49 Middlesex by a very large majority opposed the proposed separation of
F16  50 Middlesex from London. ^The mutually beneficial effects of the merger
F16  51 were by this time apparent.
F16  52    |^As a result of our opposition, the National Executive abandoned
F16  53 its earlier idea and decided to leave Middlesex with the London Labour
F16  54 Party but to set up a regional organising area covering the same area
F16  55 as proposed for the Regional Council, which Council has not been
F16  56 established.
F16  57    |^In consequence, Constituency Labour Parties in Middlesex now have
F16  58 to look to Hemel Hempstead on Party organisation questions and to the
F16  59 London Labour Party on other matters. ^The present situation has many
F16  60 defects.
F16  61 *<*4Deputation*>
F16  62    |^*0Organisation, policy and Party administration cannot easily be
F16  63 separated. ^There is confusion in the Middlesex Parties as to who
F16  64 should do what.
F16  65    |^Take the recent Middlesex County Council election. ^The policy on
F16  66 which the election is fought is the responsibility of the London
F16  67 Labour Party Executive, the production of posters, leaflets and that
F16  68 kind of thing is undertaken by the Executive and the payment of grants
F16  69 to Parties in need is another job for the London Labour Party.
F16  70    |^But where do you draw the line between producing the policy and
F16  71 the propaganda points and selling them to the Party and the electors?
F16  72    |^Twelve months ago a deputation met the representative of the
F16  73 National Executive and pressed for a review of the present Middlesex
F16  74 set-up so that the inherent difficulties in the structure could be
F16  75 overcome in readiness for the Middlesex election.
F16  76    |^Following a resolution carried at the Annual Conference in
F16  77 February this year pressing for an Organiser for Middlesex, and
F16  78 following a resolution of the Executive in May pressing for more
F16  79 effective machinery in Middlesex, Bob Mellish, Joe Barrow, \0Mrs.
F16  80 Forbes and I met the Chairman of the Organisation Sub-Committee of the
F16  81 National Executive Committee and the National Agent for a very full
F16  82 and frank discussion on the Party structure in Middlesex. ^We await
F16  83 the outcome of that meeting.
F16  84 *<*4Royal Commission*>
F16  85    |^*0The difficulties facing the National Executive are recognised.
F16  86 ^There is not a lot of money available for the appointment of an
F16  87 *1additional *0organiser whose responsibilities would be entirely
F16  88 devoted to Middlesex affairs.
F16  89    |^The Report of the Royal Commission is out and we all await some
F16  90 indication of the Government's policy on local government in Greater
F16  91 London.
F16  92    |^The structure of the Party would inevitably bear some
F16  93 relationship to the outline of local government in the area *4if
F16  94 *0there should be changes. ^So, the National Executive is inhibited
F16  95 from embarking on a long term solution to the Middlesex problem
F16  96 pending the outcome of the Royal Commission Report.
F16  97    |^On the other hand we cannot postpone the Middlesex question
F16  98 indefinitely. ^A General Election could well be with us before the
F16  99 shape of local government in Greater London is settled. ^And we cannot
F16 100 blandly assume that the {0L.C.C.} and the Middlesex County Council
F16 101 are doomed to disappear.
F16 102    |^The Northern Home Counties idea has not worked. ^The Middlesex
F16 103 Parties feel no pull towards their comparatively rural neighbours.
F16 104 ^The closer community of interest, the lines of communication, the
F16 105 social and economic factors are all much more akin to London.
F16 106    |^The case for having Middlesex as a strong trade union and
F16 107 industrial base for a new Regional Council was demolished when the
F16 108 idea of a new Regional Council for the six Northern Home Counties was
F16 109 abandoned.
F16 110    |^The justification for keeping Middlesex in the Little Six is
F16 111 really to maintain some paper-equality of numbers of constituencies in
F16 112 each Region or Organising area.
F16 113    |^What about alternatives? ^One solution would be to revert to the
F16 114 pre-1959 position in which Middlesex would be re-integrated with
F16 115 London.
F16 116    |^The difficulty here is that such a solution would not give
F16 117 Middlesex a full-time field man working exclusively in Middlesex.
F16 118    |^Middlesex is a marginal County and needs County-wide
F16 119 *"marginal**" treatment. ^Middlesex needs to nurture a Middlesex
F16 120 consciousness and County pride. ^The political parties have a heavy
F16 121 responsibility in this direction.
F16 122    |^Middlesex is a very important urban County. ^The National
F16 123 Executive recognised this when it proposed to include Middlesex in the
F16 124 new Region.
F16 125    |^Another solution, drastic and perhaps not immediately favoured
F16 126 would be to sever Middlesex from the London Labour Party and set up a
F16 127 Middlesex Labour Party along similar lines to the London Labour Party.
F16 128    |^There are, of course, obvious financial problems attaching to
F16 129 this proposal but they would have to be resolved.
F16 130    |^Or, a Middlesex Federation of Labour Parties working within a
F16 131 Regional Council covering the Northern Home Counties might be
F16 132 considered as a possible solution.
F16 133    |^The London Labour Party Executive and its Middlesex County
F16 134 Committee are much concerned about the whole thorny problem.
F16 135    |^We must all of us examine the question on the basis of ~*"What is
F16 136 likely to be best for the Party**" and not on ~*"How best can we have
F16 137 what we hold.**"
F16 138    |^A Labour Middlesex County Council is just as desirable as a
F16 139 Labour {0L.C.C.} ^The recapture of Middlesex in 1964 will bring joy
F16 140 to the many friends of Middlesex in London.
F16 141    |^But we must plan and devise the means of that victory now.

F16 169    |^An Englishman's home is his castle*- to a Londoner it's more
F16 170 likely to be an {0L.C.C.} flat or perhaps the prospect of one. ^But
F16 171 either way, where he lives, how he lives, what rent he pays, is surely

F16 207    |^Harold Ewart Clay devoted his life to the Labour Movement in its

F16 209 *<*4Tramways*>
F16 210    |^*0From his earliest years he was an active trade unionist and
F16 211 Labour Party worker.
F16 212    |^However, it was not until 1920 that I first knew of him. ^He was
F16 213 in Leeds and I in London.
F16 214    |^In that year his Union*- the Tramwaymen's Union*- amalgamated
F16 215 with others to form the United Vehicle Workers' Union ({0U.V.W.}),
F16 216 and my Union, the London Carmen's Trade Union amalgamated with others
F16 217 to form the National Union of Vehicle Workers ({0N.U.V.W.}).
F16 218    |^He was an officer of the {0U.V.W.}, I was an officer of
F16 219 {0N.U.V.W.} and so our ways were set to meet.
F16 220 *<*4Merger*>
F16 221    |^*0Both unions were trying to serve the interests of all forms of
F16 222 road transport, and it was inevitable that fierce rivalry would lead
F16 223 to conflict.
F16 224    |^Harold in his Union and I in mine, together with many of our
F16 225 colleagues, believed that this conflict could only be solved*- and the
F16 226 best interests of the membership and the community at large be served
F16 227 by a wider amalgamation.

F17   2 *<*6READY FOR LIFE*>
F17   3    |^T*2HE *0mother's face was drawn with anxiety. ^*"It's my little
F17   4 girl, doctor,**" she said indicating the fair-haired child sitting by
F17   5 her side. ^*"I'm desperately worried about her. ^I think she's got
F17   6 cancer.**"
F17   7    |^The doctor showed no emotion. ^*"And what makes you think
F17   8 that?**" he asked.
F17   9    |^*"Well,**" said the mother, *"she's developed a lump in her
F17  10 chest. ^It's getting bigger, too. ^That is how cancer starts, isn't
F17  11 it?**"
F17  12    |^*"How old is the child?**" asked the doctor.
F17  13    |^*"Just nine years.**"
F17  14    |^The doctor completed his examination. ^He was smiling when he
F17  15 spoke again.
F17  16    |^*"It's certainly not cancer,**" he told the mother. ^*"Your
F17  17 daughter's growing up, that's all. ^The swelling is the beginning of
F17  18 her figure.**"
F17  19    |^This incident, which took place in the Harley Street
F17  20 consulting-room of one of our leading children's doctors, is no freak
F17  21 case. ^Nor is it unusual in 1961 Britain.
F17  22    |^For the truth is that in the last few years a tremendous upheaval
F17  23 has shaken our understanding of child development.
F17  24    |^Today, children are growing up*- physically*- far earlier than
F17  25 their parents did. ^And as breast development is normally the first
F17  26 sign of puberty in a girl, it is not unusual to find this starting as
F17  27 young as nine or ten.
F17  28 *<*5Some parents cannot accept this change in their children*>
F17  29    |^*0Earlier puberty is a subject that is proving of enormous
F17  30 interest to the medical profession, but for some odd reason it is one
F17  31 that seems to be passing by the most important people of all*- apart
F17  32 from the children*- the parents.
F17  33    |^Today's parents cannot seem to accept that the girl who starts
F17  34 menstruating at eleven is not super-advanced, that indeed they must be
F17  35 prepared to expect this to begin round about this time.
F17  36    |^For these are the startling facts:
F17  37    |^Girls are developing earlier, at the rate of four to six months
F17  38 earlier every ten years. ^This means that biologically they are now
F17  39 growing up two to three years earlier than they did at the turn of the
F17  40 century.
F17  41    |^Boys are advancing even faster. ^In fact, it is now getting quite
F17  42 difficult to find choirboys old enough to behave in church who can
F17  43 still sing treble.
F17  44    |^Children are simultaneously getting increasingly taller and
F17  45 heavier as the years roll by.
F17  46    |^For example, on an average, a girl of eight in 1959 was as tall
F17  47 and heavy as a girl of eight-and-a-half in 1949. ^And in ten years the
F17  48 average height of a ten-year-old has increased by half an inch, the
F17  49 average weight by three-and-a-half pounds.
F17  50    |^Nor does the advance show any signs of halting. ^In fact, it may
F17  51 well be that by the time these children have their children, the
F17  52 *1majority *0of girls will be maturing at ten.
F17  53    |^Doctors who are delving into the reasons why this revolution is
F17  54 taking place have come up with some intriguing theories.
F17  55    |^Many say it is because today's child is much better fed than her
F17  56 ancestors. ^School milk, they say, has quite a bit to do with it.
F17  57    |^Others believe the reason is climatic. ^It's known that
F17  58 overheating delays the growth of laboratory rats, and it's been
F17  59 suggested that children now grow considerably faster because their
F17  60 parents do not overclothe them as they used to in the old days.
F17  61    |^Modern psychiatrists, however, have an even more interesting
F17  62 theory.
F17  63    |^They say that it's the direct result of easier relations between
F17  64 the sexes. ^There is more conversation about sex between boys and
F17  65 girls and a far more natural acceptance of the once unmentionable
F17  66 *"facts of life.**"
F17  67    |^This theory is borne out by the fact that children in
F17  68 co-educational schools often mature earlier than those who are
F17  69 segregated.
F17  70    |^Getting it through to some parents that earlier puberty is now a
F17  71 fact is proving quite a headache to doctors and teachers.
F17  72    |^Most teachers have very decided views on the subject. ^Like one
F17  73 of our most go-ahead principals, Miss {0K. C. M.} Gent, headmistress
F17  74 of the four hundred strong girls' grammar school in Lichfield,
F17  75 Staffordshire.
F17  76    |^*"Girls start here at eleven, and by the end of the first year at
F17  77 least fifty per cent of them have reached puberty, many having started
F17  78 before they even arrive,**" she told me.
F17  79    |^*"Because of this I have made it a rule to see each set of
F17  80 parents individually before the child begins her first term,**" she
F17  81 went on. ^*"I tell them that I insist on every child knowing the facts
F17  82 of life before she starts at my school.
F17  83    |^*"If the parents find it difficult or embarrassing to talk to the
F17  84 child I give them a booklet which the child can read.
F17  85    |^*"Almost every mother I meet seems surprised that I insist on
F17  86 this so early.
F17  87    |^*"They can't seem to take in the fact that girls are maturing so
F17  88 quickly. ^But once they realize the truth of it they're glad to
F17  89 co-operate and teach their daughters.**"
F17  90 *<*5Now more than ever children crave wise guidance*>
F17  91    |^*0Though we may think it a good idea that children should grow up
F17  92 more quickly, let none of us imagine that earlier puberty doesn't
F17  93 bring its own set of difficult problems.
F17  94    |^The toughest of these is this: that though physical development
F17  95 has advanced so rapidly social development has stood still.
F17  96    |^A girl of eleven today*- even if she does happen to wear a
F17  97 thirty-four-inch bra*- is still, to her mother and father, a child.
F17  98 ^And that's the way society looks at her, too.
F17  99    |^So who can blame her if she gets all mixed up? ^She has not had
F17 100 enough experience of life to cope with the new process. ^She has been
F17 101 well protected in the junior school, and at home she has always been
F17 102 regarded as *"a kid.**"
F17 103    |^No wonder, then, that she doesn't know whether to play with toys
F17 104 or go out with boys. ^No wonder she craves wise parental guidance and
F17 105 friendship more now than ever before.
F17 106    |^Which brings us back to the mother. ^What exactly are the
F17 107 problems likely to come up when she suddenly finds herself confronted
F17 108 by a little woman of twelve?
F17 109    |^How can she cope with the child's emotional growing pains in the
F17 110 kindest, most sensible way? ^How can she tell her daughter that,
F17 111 physically, she is now a woman?
F17 112    |^I sought the answers from doctors and psychiatrists, teachers and
F17 113 social workers.
F17 114 *<*2CONTINUING *6READY FOR LIFE *4by *6ROSALIE SHANN*>
F17 115 *<*6ADOLESCENCE *5is one of the most important times in a woman's life*>
F17 116    |^*6I*2T *0is a fact that girls are developing earlier at the rate
F17 117 of four to six months every ten years. ^This means that biologically
F17 118 they are now growing up two to three years earlier than they did at
F17 119 the turn of the century. ^Boys are advancing even faster.
F17 120    |^And this creates a whole new set of problems for the parents.
F17 121    |^Everyone is agreed that as puberty advances so they must also
F17 122 advance their attitude to the growing child.
F17 123    |^A girl may well be emotionally unready for puberty because that
F17 124 emotional development is still way behind physical development. ^Her
F17 125 emotions have given her no warning of imminent changes. ^But though
F17 126 she may be unprepared her mother must not be.
F17 127    |^It is essential she tell the child the facts of life in time, not
F17 128 just the usual item about where babies come from, but what puberty is,
F17 129 what changes will take place, and why.
F17 130    |^What exactly is meant by *"in time**"? ^Well, it varies from
F17 131 child to child, but generally speaking changes should be discussed as
F17 132 soon as they begin in the child.
F17 133    |^The first sign is invariably the beginning of the development of
F17 134 the bust. ^As soon as a mother notices this she should talk to the
F17 135 girl, perhaps before if the opportunity has arisen, but never later
F17 136 than this.
F17 137    |^A child, incidentally, is far more likely to accept the facts
F17 138 naturally and easily and without embarrassment if she is used to
F17 139 seeing her mother undressed.
F17 140    |^Then as soon as menstruation starts the mother should explain to
F17 141 her daughter all over again what it is and why it happens.
F17 142 *<*5Physical changes indicate the child's approaching maturity*>
F17 143    |^*0Doctors say it is important to explain to the child *1twice*0*-
F17 144 before menstruation happens and when it does*- as she cannot fully
F17 145 appreciate the facts the first time.
F17 146    |^Above all, a mother should appear pleased about her daughter's
F17 147 physical changes because it indicates approaching maturity, and this
F17 148 is something, the mother must imply, to be looked forward to, not
F17 149 dreaded.
F17 150    |^If a mother views the onset of her daughter's adolescence with
F17 151 misgiving, believing*- because of what she's heard*- that it's always
F17 152 a troubled time for all concerned, then this fear will be communicated
F17 153 to the child, and the inevitable obstacles will be anticipated and
F17 154 probably enlarged.
F17 155    |^A fact mothers must also be prepared for is that different levels
F17 156 of maturity exist side by side. ^This can be extremely tricky to
F17 157 understand, both from the parents' and the child's point of view.
F17 158    |^There often is, for instance, a child who can partake in quite
F17 159 adult activities, such as intellectual conversation, yet at the same
F17 160 time spend hours reading her childish comics. ^Moods vary, too, and
F17 161 with such speed that the poor parent is often at a loss to keep up.
F17 162    |^One minute the child is lost in desolation, quite sure she is a
F17 163 failure in every way. ^The next, while the parent is still trying to
F17 164 comfort her, she is brimming over with self-confidence and a brand new
F17 165 bout of enthusiasm.
F17 166    |^By far the best, and most sensible, way for mothers to face this
F17 167 time is to accept that the child is changing, and to welcome that
F17 168 change.
F17 169    |^This, of course, is far easier said than done, for, whatever the
F17 170 psychiatrists say, it cuts the heart when a dearly loved child, once
F17 171 so docile and parent-attached, suddenly wants to strike out by
F17 172 herself, choosing her own friends.
F17 173    |^But it is some compensation to realize that this desire for
F17 174 independence is a good thing for the child.
F17 175    |^It shows she is anxious to stand on her own feet and make a place
F17 176 for herself in the world later on.
F17 177    |^If her naturally healthy desire to grow up is frustrated she will
F17 178 either lose her urge to be independent or she will rebel and go her
F17 179 own way anyhow. ^And this last spells trouble in the home.
F17 180    |^A child psychiatrist was adamant on this point of independence.
F17 181    |^*"So many mothers,**" he said, *"make the mistake of expecting to
F17 182 know everything about their daughters. ^The brutal truth is that a
F17 183 girl will not grow up normally unless she has a secret life away from
F17 184 her parents.
F17 185    |^*"In fact, the daughter who tells her mother everything is very
F17 186 suspect from the psychiatrist's point of view because she is not being
F17 187 allowed to grow naturally into an adult.**"
F17 188    |
F17 189    |^*2IT'*0s enlightening, and a little shattering, to learn from the
F17 190 psychiatrist that that state which mothers boast about, *"we're more
F17 191 like sisters than mother and daughter**" is not one to be envied.
F17 192 ^Indeed, this very closeness and dependence is considered detrimental
F17 193 to normal development.
F17 194    |^*"It's far more healthy for girls to giggle among themselves and
F17 195 have *'best friends**' from their own classmates,**" the psychiatrist
F17 196 told me.
F17 197    |^*"The mother just mustn't be that *'best friend**' because it
F17 198 suggests that the daughter is still clinging to her.
F17 199    |^*"I know this is a bitter pill for mothers to swallow,
F17 200 particularly those who are bringing up daughters alone without their
F17 201 husbands. ^I often advise these women to get themselves an interesting
F17 202 job. ^Just for the sake of the girl.**"
F17 203    |^Many young women who finally end up with nervous breakdowns or
F17 204 other mental disorders do so just because they have never broken away
F17 205 from their families.
F17 206    |^*"You have no idea how many girls come here who have never been
F17 207 shopping by themselves,**" another psychiatrist said. ^*"A young
F17 208 person should be allowed a lot more responsibility and freedom from
F17 209 the age of ten or eleven onwards.
F17 210    |^*"She should be able to choose some of her own clothes and
F17 211 perhaps her own wallpaper. ^She must be able to spend her own pocket
F17 212 money the way she wants, and keep a diary which no one will read.

F18   7    |^*6BACK *4in World War One an excited young mother entered the
F18   8 Registrar's Office at Ramsbottom in Lancashire.
F18   9    |^*"I've had triplets,**" she announced proudly. ^*"I'd like to
F18  10 call them France, Belgium and Russia*- after our Allies.**"
F18  11    |^*0The Deputy Registrar, pretty young Miss Dorothy Taylor
F18  12 Horrocks, looked startled, but her voice stayed calm.
F18  13    |^*"Does your husband like those names?**"
F18  14    |^*"I haven't asked him. ^He's serving in France.**"
F18  15    |^*"Well, do write and see what he says before deciding,**" Miss
F18  16 Horrocks advised gently. ^*"When the boys grow up, those names might
F18  17 be an embarrassment. ^But of course, if your husband approves, we'll
F18  18 register the babies as you wish.**"
F18  19 *<*5A lesson in tact*>
F18  20    |^*0A week later the mother came back.
F18  21    |^*"I'm glad you made me tell my husband before naming the boys,**"
F18  22 she said gratefully. ^*"We've decided to call them Frank, Charles and
F18  23 Richard.**"
F18  24    |^Today, Dorothy Taylor Horrocks*- now Registrar for Radcliffe,
F18  25 Whitefield and Prestwich*- still remembers that early exercise in
F18  26 common sense and tact.
F18  27    |^*"Though there are not many women registrars yet, I think we can
F18  28 give men registrars a lead in some ways,**" she told me with a smile.
F18  29 ^*"Men may be more efficient and businesslike, but on the personal
F18  30 side of Births, Deaths and Marriages women have a more sympathetic
F18  31 approach.**"
F18  32    |^I could see Miss Horrocks' point. ^Neither her conventional,
F18  33 impersonal office nor her plain black suit could deflect from the warm
F18  34 personality of this woman who records the greatest dramas of our
F18  35 lives.
F18  36    |^With Miss Horrocks, her job is not just a matter of making an
F18  37 entry in an official book, issuing an official certificate. ^When a
F18  38 woman who is newly widowed comes to register her husband's death, Miss
F18  39 Horrocks can sense at once if she needs a friendly ear.
F18  40    |^*"Don't worry,**" she will say with gentle patience. ^*"I'm here
F18  41 to help you. ^Now sit down and tell me about it...**"
F18  42    |^With a girl registering an illegitimate birth, her manner is
F18  43 similarly sympathetic.
F18  44    |^One such girl expressed the feelings of many: ^*"When I walked in
F18  45 here and saw the registrar was this kind lady I was so relieved.**"
F18  46    |^One reason, perhaps, why Miss Horrocks has this work at her
F18  47 finger-tips is that she was born into the business! ^Her father, too,
F18  48 was a registrar, and though she had originally hoped to be a nurse,
F18  49 Miss Horrocks found herself following in his footsteps.
F18  50    |^*"It's in registering births that our real test comes, especially
F18  51 when the mother chooses an impossible name. ^Incidentally, it's always
F18  52 the Mums who are fanciful!
F18  53 *<*5Back to old names*>
F18  54    |^*0*"If the father is in doubt about the name, or perhaps doesn't
F18  55 even know the wife's choice if he is away, often I can influence the
F18  56 balance of opinion. ^But if both parents approve I must comply with
F18  57 their wishes.
F18  58    |^*"One wife wanted to name her baby daughter Rowena*- Ophelia*-
F18  59 Elvira*- Cardetta*- Osberga*- after the ships on which her sailor
F18  60 husband had served. ^In this case the husband was thrilled with the
F18  61 names, so I could do no more!**"
F18  62    |^Miss Horrocks smiled. ^*"Lately I've registered very few strange
F18  63 names. ^Even the fashion of calling babies after film stars isn't so
F18  64 popular these days. ^We seem to be having a swing back to the
F18  65 old-fashioned, tried and trusted names*- especially Mark for boys and
F18  66 Jane for girls.**"
F18  67    |^The next step on the path of life*- marriage*- is a routine job
F18  68 for Miss Horrocks, but it occupies most of her time!
F18  69    |^Apart from ceremonies conducted in her office by the
F18  70 Superintendent Registrar, each Saturday she's off on a round of Roman
F18  71 Catholic and other non-Conformist churches where it is necessary for a
F18  72 registrar to be present at a marriage ceremony.
F18  73    |^*"I've spent more time waiting at the church than any other woman
F18  74 in Lancashire,**" laughs Miss Horrocks. ^*"When a bride is late I'm on
F18  75 tenterhooks*- wondering if I'll be in time for my next wedding.
F18  76    |^*"But I don't really mind. ^It's the bride's great day.
F18  77    |^*"I have never been married myself, but if I had, I know I'd have
F18  78 been late, too!
F18  79    |^*"I always enjoy watching a wedding. ^Today a great many of the
F18  80 girls are wearing those pretty Princess Margaret style bridal
F18  81 headdresses, and they wear more elaborate dresses than they used to
F18  82 do. ^But the grooms are usually more nervous.**"
F18  83 *<*5Only one hitch in years*>
F18  84    |^*0In her long career Miss Horrocks has known only one marriage
F18  85 hitch*- last summer, when ex-assistant-hangman Brian Allen and his
F18  86 Spanish bride Angela Corillo went through a marriage ceremony at a
F18  87 Roman Catholic church, but forgot to inform Miss Horrocks.
F18  88    |^*"They were therefore not legally married!**" Miss Horrocks told
F18  89 me. ^*"Still, it was all put right. ^They delayed their honeymoon and
F18  90 came to me for a special licence.**"
F18  91    |^Miss Horrocks holds another record.
F18  92    |^One morning she attended a wedding, two and a half hours later
F18  93 she was informed the bride had given birth to twins and that one of
F18  94 the babies had died. ^So in the space of a day she had registered a
F18  95 marriage, two births and a death*- all in one family!
F18  96    |^And what of Miss Horrocks' own life?
F18  97    |^It is very much drama-free, she admits. ^She shares a house with
F18  98 a retired headmistress, belongs to an exclusive women's club, doesn't
F18  99 do much in the way of hobbies because she hasn't the time.
F18 100    |^*"But after my daily panorama of the highlights in other people's
F18 101 lives, I'm perfectly content with a quiet life of my own,**" she
F18 102 smiled.
F18 103 *<*7DID YOU KNOW *4the part a registrar plays in your life?*>
F18 104 *<*6BIRTHS*>
F18 105    |^THE *4birth of a baby should be reported to the registrar within
F18 106 forty-two days. ^There is a fee of 3\0s. 9\0d. for a certified copy
F18 107 and 9\0d. for short birth certificate. **[SIC**]
F18 108    |^If you later regret your choice of Christian names and want to
F18 109 change them or make an addition, this can be done at the Registrar's
F18 110 Office within a year of first registering the birth. ^The birth
F18 111 certificate will then be amended for a fee of 1\0s. 6\0d.
F18 112    |^A Christian name or names can be changed, through baptism, at any
F18 113 time.
F18 114 *<*6MARRIAGES*>
F18 115    |^*4For a marriage by certificate (the usual form of marriage) the
F18 116 registrar requires twenty-one clear days' notice. ^The fee is 3\0s. if
F18 117 the couple wishing to be married live in the same district, 6\0s. if
F18 118 they live in different districts.
F18 119    |^The fee for marriage at three days' notice is *+2 8\0s. ^This
F18 120 covers the cost of a licence only.
F18 121    |^The licence for a church wedding without the waiting time for
F18 122 banns to be called costs *+2 15\0s. ^(Not under a registrar's
F18 123 jurisdiction.)
F18 124    |^Contrary to popular belief, a special licence is not one which
F18 125 enables a couple to marry quickly. ^This special licence is granted by
F18 126 the appropriate Bishop only in exceptional circumstances (for example,
F18 127 when a couple wish to marry in a district where they neither live nor
F18 128 worship or in a place which is not licensed for marriage*- a college
F18 129 chapel, \0etc.). ^There is no set waiting period before a special
F18 130 licence wedding takes place, and it costs *+25.
F18 131 *<*6DEATHS*>
F18 132    |^*4When a doctor has issued a certificate showing the cause of
F18 133 death, this must be taken to the registrar, who will then issue an
F18 134 official burial or cremation certificate. ^This is needed before
F18 135 burial or cremation can take place and is issued free of charge. ^All
F18 136 certificates for personal purposes must be paid. ^The fee charged is
F18 137 according to the purpose for which the certificates are needed.
F18 138 *<*5Most of us have lived through it*- that moment when all hope of
F18 139 happiness seems lost for ever*>
F18 140 *<*4They said they'd *6NEVER LOVE AGAIN*>
F18 141    |^*"N*3EVER! ^*1I'll never get over him. ^I know I'll never love
F18 142 again.**" ^*4The girl threw herself, sobbing, on the bed. ^For hours*-
F18 143 or so it seemed*- she lay there, the victim of a bleak all-enveloping
F18 144 despair. ^For the moment, at any rate, she knew that this man, who had
F18 145 so recently gone out of her life, would be in her heart for ever.
F18 146 ^*1She would never get over him...
F18 147    |^*0This scene, which surely every woman has lived through herself,
F18 148 goes on everywhere, all the time. ^The broken romance, the terrible
F18 149 grief when you realise that the one you love has gone out of your life
F18 150 for ever...
F18 151    |^But here is a heartening thing: to almost everyone who has ever
F18 152 loved and lost, there comes, in time, another love, another day when
F18 153 the heart sings through joy of loving...
F18 154    |^Time, it is true, heals even the most bruised hearts. ^Time, and
F18 155 a second love. ^Those unlucky enough to be going through just this sad
F18 156 phase in life right now, may look at some of the great loves of recent
F18 157 years, loves that have come to nothing or have ended tragically and
F18 158 yet whose partners have gone on to love again*- *1and take heart!
F18 159    |^*0Look first at the most ill-fated romance of the century. ^That
F18 160 of Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend.
F18 161    |^If ever there was a modern fairy-tale that went wrong, then
F18 162 Margaret's and Peter's must surely be it.
F18 163 *<*5After two long years*>
F18 164    |^*6T*2HEY *0knew each other for thirteen years, first met when
F18 165 Margaret was a boisterous schoolgirl and Peter the *"new boy**" at the
F18 166 Palace.
F18 167    |^When it was discovered in Royal Circles that they were in love,
F18 168 Peter was posted to Brussels as an air attache*?2. ^They had to be
F18 169 apart for two years, perhaps to test if their love was strong enough
F18 170 to bear the separation.
F18 171    |^It was. ^In the autumn of 1955, Peter Townsend flew back home and
F18 172 went straight to Clarence House to meet Margaret.
F18 173    |^In New York the papers headlined the news: ^*1Only a Matter of
F18 174 Hours Now. ^*0But the hours spun out into days, the days into weeks.
F18 175 ^Indeed it was eighteen days before Margaret finally decided.
F18 176    |^During that time they were constantly in each other's company.
F18 177 ^Either at Clarence House or in the homes of their friends.
F18 178    |^Four private dinner parties were given for them in London. ^Twice
F18 179 they spent the weekend as guests of close friends in the country.
F18 180    |^They walked hand in hand under the trees aglow with autumn
F18 181 colours, and went over the problem endlessly, again and again and
F18 182 again...
F18 183    |^It was no good, and they both knew it. ^Peter Townsend had been
F18 184 the innocent party in a divorce case. ^And that was enough to make him
F18 185 unsuitable by Royal standards.
F18 186 *<*5Their first meeting*>
F18 187    |^*6A*2LONE *0in the Clarence House drawing-room on the day when
F18 188 she made public the renunciation of her love, Margaret read through
F18 189 once more the draft of a personal message, which in a hundred and
F18 190 fourteen words, told the world of her decision: ^*"I would like it to
F18 191 be known that I have decided not to marry Group Captain Townsend...**"
F18 192    |^Few of us will forget the heartbreaking pictures of Margaret that
F18 193 were in the papers the following day. ^Bravely, she tried to show a
F18 194 face of composure to the world in true Royal Family tradition. ^But no
F18 195 camera could fail to record her grief.
F18 196    |^A little later came the story that Margaret and Peter had sworn
F18 197 never to wed. ^The Group Captain was quoted as having said: ^*"As we
F18 198 cannot marry each other, then neither of us will ever marry anyone
F18 199 else.**" ^But it was not to be. ^And a good thing, too. ^Nobody would
F18 200 wish these two young people to go through life alone for the rest of
F18 201 their days.
F18 202    |^Within five years from that fateful October evening, both of them
F18 203 had married other people. ^Peter Townsend, a pretty French girl, who
F18 204 looked so remarkably like the Princess; and Margaret the good-looking
F18 205 photographer, Tony Armstrong-Jones.
F18 206    |^It had been three years though before she had found another love.
F18 207 ^Three years, while she nursed her broken heart and looked sadly on
F18 208 all the young men who asked to take her out.
F18 209    |^Then on the night of March 31, 1958, she went to a Hallowe'en
F18 210 ball at London's Dorchester Hotel with Billy Wallace and other
F18 211 friends.

F19   2 *<*6WHY INTOXICANTS?*>
F19   3 *<*4Man's search for immortality... by Wesley \0M. Clark*>
F19   4    |^*6A*2S FAR BACK *0as primitive man, one discovers him directly
F19   5 dependent on the whims and moods of nature. ^Her laws dared not be
F19   6 flaunted by him. ^Her contrasts, the warm-breathing summer, with a
F19   7 plentiful supply of everything needful, relentless winter, when
F19   8 everything seemed dead without a shaft of sunlight for weeks at a
F19   9 time*- dire want. ^All the suffering awakened and sharpened in him his
F19  10 perceptive faculties.
F19  11    |^Primitive man noted the mood between the lustrous sun in the
F19  12 cerulean vault of the daytime, and the changing faces of the moon that
F19  13 gleamed coldly during the fear-inspiring night. ^He wondered at the
F19  14 mysterious stars that seemed at times to travel across the vision of
F19  15 the black face of the night. ^Occasionally, these shimmering stars
F19  16 plunged downward toward the earth at tremendous speed. ^Then there
F19  17 were times when the sky would change from tranquillity to sudden
F19  18 anger. ^Great ominous clouds galloped across the heavenly firmament,
F19  19 writhing and with diabolical unpredictability, seemingly resembling
F19  20 unleashed monsters, spitting fire, roaring angrily, and emptying
F19  21 deluges of water to the earth. ^Why? Man asked himself. ^Who? ^What
F19  22 does all this?
F19  23    |^When a member of man's family died, the body, which only an hour
F19  24 before had been warm, talked and breathed, suddenly was inert and
F19  25 cold. ^Its appearance had not changed outwardly, yet it was not the
F19  26 same. ^There was no longer the rhythmic breathing. ^With the last
F19  27 gasp, life departed. ^Breath, then, was life. ^But where had breath
F19  28 gone?
F19  29    |^And he could smell the aroma of the flowers, the pungent
F19  30 exhalations from the trees, the earth. ^The thought occurred to him,
F19  31 all this is like my breath*- my breath which vanishes when I die. ^And
F19  32 when I die, where do I go?
F19  33    |^These phenomena which man experienced eventually evolved into a
F19  34 conception of one or more spiritual beings of invisible forces or
F19  35 powers within the many objects about him. ^It was the *1Breath *0that
F19  36 separated from the live body and departed elsewhere, leaving behind
F19  37 the inanimate, which gave first rise to the conception of spirits.
F19  38    |^Everywhere man was this conception existed. ^Among the Primal
F19  39 Aryans, it was called *1Gust, Breath *0or *1Whiff. ^*0The Greeks
F19  40 termed it \*1Atman, *0breath, air; or, \*1Pneuma, *0air. ^The Romans,
F19  41 whether of ancient pagan days or modern Christian times, used the term
F19  42 \*1Spiritus *0for breath; while \*1Geist, Ghost, \Gast, *0or \*1Gaest,
F19  43 *0was the way the German and his Teutonic forebears summed it up. ^The
F19  44 conception has been incorporated almost in its original form in the
F19  45 Old Testament which states: ^*"In creating man, God breathed into him
F19  46 the *1Breath *0of life, the *1Spirit, *0the *1Soul.**"
F19  47    |^*0Primitive man's logic was naive. ^Upon developing the concept
F19  48 of a world of spirits, he immediately entered upon the system of
F19  49 spirit worship, which in its most elemental form, was a worship of the
F19  50 dead. ^The dead continued to live as spirits; in the wind, the
F19  51 flowers, the trees, the thunder, the volcano, an animal. ^But it did
F19  52 not matter so much where they lived, as that man felt the spirits
F19  53 needed food, both liquid and solid, just the same as when they still
F19  54 dwelt in their mortal bodies. ^Therefore, man deduced it was his
F19  55 duty*- a sacred obligation for him to supply spirits with food, drink,
F19  56 clothing, weapons, slaves*- everything he was used to using while he
F19  57 was alive. ^This was motivated through fear or love.
F19  58    |^In the Occident as in the Orient, in Africa, Australia or
F19  59 America, wherever primitive man or primitive man's history may be
F19  60 researched, the custom became firmly established. ^Nor has it
F19  61 disappeared today. ^Among certain Christianised people, the ritual of
F19  62 setting aside daily food and drink for the departed is strictly
F19  63 adhered to; or dishes and beverage are taken on the anniversary of the
F19  64 dead to their place of burial. ^The libation in honour of the deceased
F19  65 is found as a part of the most modern customs, as when some drops are
F19  66 poured out before a drink is taken: the toast.
F19  67    |^From this simplest-of-all worship of the dead, there gradually
F19  68 grew a worship of spirits in general.
F19  69    |^This conviction of the superhuman and following it, the need of
F19  70 appeasement either because of fear or love, found its visible
F19  71 expression in offerings, sacrifices to the spirits or deities. ^And
F19  72 what could be found more pleasing to them than food and drink? ^These
F19  73 two items became an integral part of worship.
F19  74    |^Primitive man's first thought at the birth of his first
F19  75 conception of the supernatural survival of his ancestors' spirits, to
F19  76 whom he consecrated sacrifices, food, and drink, evolved without a
F19  77 break for hundreds of centuries.
F19  78    |^With the Jews, until the Mosaic period, even until the
F19  79 destruction of Jerusalem, when bloody sacrifices were ended; with the
F19  80 Christians of the Roman Empire, until the reign of *2THEODOSIUS (392
F19  81 {0A.D.}), *0when bloody sacrifices were abolished, and only the
F19  82 unbloody one*- the offertorium at Mass*- bread and wine has gone on
F19  83 unchecked.
F19  84    |^The fact stands out, boldly and indisputable, that deeply rooted
F19  85 in the human consciousness there grew a feeling of dependence upon a
F19  86 power which was able to discern his fate for better or worse. ^That
F19  87 feeling filled him with awe, dread, confidence and veneration.
F19  88    |^Along with, and as strong as the consciousness of his dependence
F19  89 upon the spirits*- deities*- man was influenced by the reflection that
F19  90 it was wise to propitiate; in fact to get into communication
F19  91 indirectly, or directly if possible with those supernatural powers or
F19  92 beings. ^This he attempted and succeeded in doing by the exercise of
F19  93 the various forms of worship: libations, fastings, sacrifices,
F19  94 prayers, singing or **[SIC**] hymns, dancing.
F19  95    |^Prayer, psychic abandonment and the many kinds of devotional
F19  96 exercises induced in primitive man, accompanied, as it did in all his
F19  97 descendants, the condition known as *1spiritual elevation *0and
F19  98 *1exhaltation, *0followed by the more advanced stages of *1inspiration
F19  99 *0and *1ecstasy. ^*0It was only in these later spiritual phases, that
F19 100 the human mind was able to step across the threshold of material
F19 101 thought into the sphere of the immaterial or supernatural world. ^In
F19 102 these phases only, could man leave his objective consciousness
F19 103 entirely behind him. ^There only, he was able to feel the *1Breath,
F19 104 *0the *1Spirit *0of the god, to resemble in his whole being the
F19 105 spiritual entity to **[SIC**] the god, to be filled with it. ^In that
F19 106 condition, he was *1inspired.
F19 107    |^*0This fundamental idea immediately found its way into man's
F19 108 speech, which henceforth became filled with words and idioms
F19 109 expressing it. ^In theology one is cognisant of the *1inspired
F19 110 *0prophets, the *1inspiration *0of the scriptures. ^There are in
F19 111 ordinary speech the expressions: the *1inspired *0artist, orator,
F19 112 writer, musician*- and on a more profane level, there is the
F19 113 *1inspiration *0of the fermented juice.
F19 114    |^Side by side with inspiration and its meaning, in fact identical
F19 115 to it in many usages, came the word *"enthusiasm.**" ^To the ancient
F19 116 Greeks who passed it on to the contemporary world, the word meant:
F19 117 *"in God,**" *"being in God,**" *"united with God**". (*1\en*- *0in,
F19 118 *1\theos*- *0God). ^In common usage, however, enthusiasm has come to
F19 119 mean, *"the intense, rapturous feeling felt by individuals or masses,
F19 120 especially as exhibited in ardent zeal or **[SIC**] a person,
F19 121 principle, or cause.**"
F19 122    |^Back in the nebulosity of time, there developed in man a
F19 123 religious inspiration and religious ecstasy produced in their
F19 124 elemental form by mental and immaterial or psychic agents. ^Later,
F19 125 however, it became necessary, because of some crisis or urgent need
F19 126 that arose in the life of the individual or tribe, to propitiate one
F19 127 of these deities, to induce quickly by physical means this same
F19 128 intense feeling.
F19 129    |^Out of nature's vast store, it was a simple matter to select just
F19 130 those things which would do this, and there is found use by man at
F19 131 whatever stage of his history, of two classes of material, namely:
F19 132 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
F19 133    |1. Narcotics: {0i.e.} narcotic roots, leaves, herbs, which were
F19 134 either eaten, smoked or chewed; and incense.
F19 135    |2. Intoxicants: {0i.e.} natural juices or narcotic, or toxic
F19 136 plants, or fruits unfermented and fermented*- the prepared beverages.
F19 137 **[END INDENTATION**]
F19 138    |^To this list was added, through man's own ingenuity, other means
F19 139 of obtaining the same end: {0e.g.} ceremonial dances, singing, and
F19 140 incantations. ^While these methods should rightly be classed as
F19 141 intermediaries between physical and mental stimulation, {0i.e.} in
F19 142 the realm of religious auto-suggestion, yet, used in conjunction with
F19 143 one or more of the purely physical and mental agents, they came to
F19 144 play, through its entirety from the most primitive to the most modern,
F19 145 a tremendously important part in the process of worship. ^Ample
F19 146 illustrations of this are to be seen in the twentieth century. ^For
F19 147 example: The singing and music in churches, the clashing of the
F19 148 tambourines of the Salvation Army as they put the devil on the run,
F19 149 the incantations and frenzy attending them of the revival meetings.
F19 150    |^It would be impossible to express logical doubt as to whether
F19 151 early man distinguished between narcotics and intoxicants. ^They both
F19 152 produced the singular effect desired. ^But during the awakening of
F19 153 human consciousness and the first presentiment of something beyond his
F19 154 material being, the psychic intoxication differed from the physical
F19 155 intoxication only in its means and not in principle. ^This
F19 156 presentiment was coincident with the discovery of mysterious forces in
F19 157 certain of the products of nature, and which possessed the power of
F19 158 translating him into a condition of bliss, of enthusiasm, and ecstasy.
F19 159    |^Man has always followed complicated patterns of worship, each
F19 160 with his own formula for putting him in contact with the world of his
F19 161 deities. ^The various patterns of worship, upon analysis, prove to be
F19 162 merely variations of the same original pattern: spirit worship and
F19 163 worship of the dead. ^The means by which man entered into relationship
F19 164 with the deities was always the same; and of these means, the
F19 165 physical, and especially the spirituous and intoxicating beverages,
F19 166 prepared by each people in its own way, has always been an integral
F19 167 and chief part of every religious worship. ^Man, in whatever clime,
F19 168 had some plant from which he obtained a product that caused a
F19 169 pleasurable mental state, and which he elevated to the rank of god.
F19 170 ^Intoxicating beverages and religious worship came up through the ages
F19 171 blending with the human, essential elements of the material world in
F19 172 which man lived, and the spiritual world toward which he strived.
F19 173    |^With the spread of education and attendant complexities of the
F19 174 processes of logic, which events led to placing of more and more
F19 175 reliance on the purely spiritual*- psychic stimulation*- there has
F19 176 grown a tendency for man to look with disfavour upon the more physical
F19 177 stimulants, {0i.e.} intoxicants. ^Man has come by his natural taste
F19 178 for, or his tendency towards stimulants and intoxicants by the *1Law
F19 179 of Inheritance.
F19 180    |^*0Early man, on the high plateaus of central Asia east of the
F19 181 Caspian Sea and northwest of Hindustan, were pastoral people*- the
F19 182 Aryans. ^From this mother race, two distinct branches originated.
F19 183 ^One, the Indo-Europeans, gave rise to most of the European races.
F19 184 ^The Kelts, who settled in Gaul and Britain, Ireland, Wales, Scotland;
F19 185 the Germanic races, German, English, Scandinavian, Dutch, Flemish,
F19 186 Icelandic; the Slavs, Russian, Polish, Slavonian, Bohemian; the
F19 187 Greeks; the Latins, from whom stem the Italian, French, Spanish,
F19 188 Portuguese, and Roumanian. ^The other branch remained in Asia and
F19 189 became the Medes, Persians, and Hindoos.
F19 190    |^The mother tongue of the Indo-European languages is Sanskrit, and
F19 191 in this language are written the four Vedas, the holy writings of the
F19 192 Brahmans, the oldest literary works of these people, \6*1circa
F19 193 *010,000 years. ^The language of the Ancient Persia is the so-called
F19 194 Zend, and the Zend-Avesta contains the sacred writings of this branch
F19 195 of the Sanskrit tongue.
F19 196    |^The oldest Vedic Book (hymn Veda), the *"Bible of the Hindoos**",

F20   2 *<*4Guarding Lakeland's Life and Beauty*>
F20   3    |^*6I*2N *01937, when the idea of Lakeland becoming a *"National
F20   4 Park**" was an idea only, as was the Town and Country Planning Act,
F20   5 there were increasing dangers in the Lake District, both to the beauty
F20   6 of its landscape and to its traditional agriculture and local life.
F20   7 ^Some of those dangers were ugly or badly sited buildings, commercial
F20   8 afforestation and injurious road schemes.
F20   9    |^The National Trust was, of course, a landowner in Lakeland, but
F20  10 the Trust had to make public appeals for subscriptions, a slow method
F20  11 and one which could be repeated only at infrequent intervals.
F20  12    |^Sometimes private persons intervened by buying up at the last
F20  13 moment farm lands which were threatened by possible building or by
F20  14 other so called *"development,**" but the number of such public
F20  15 benefactors was necessarily limited.
F20  16    |^In these circumstances, in 1937, a Company named the Lake
F20  17 District Farm Estates Limited was formed and registered under the
F20  18 Industrial Provident Societies Acts, to organise the great amount of
F20  19 good will towards the Lake District. ^This it did by making it
F20  20 possible for lovers of the Lake District, who were not in a position
F20  21 to purchase or to manage farms or to make gifts to the National Trust,
F20  22 to lend money to the Company, at a low rate of interest, or even
F20  23 interest free.
F20  24    |^The Company's powers covered the purchase, ownership and
F20  25 management of land and buildings in Lakeland, with the aim of
F20  26 maintaining them in their present agricultural character and
F20  27 safeguarding both the beauty of the landscape and the traditional
F20  28 livelihood of the dalesman.
F20  29    |^Lakeland was defined as lying inside a circle having a radius of
F20  30 20 miles from the Langdale Pikes. ^In carrying out its objects one of
F20  31 the rules of the Company imposes an obligation on the Company to give
F20  32 covenants to the National Trust over any land purchased by the
F20  33 Company.
F20  34    |^The first stipulation and restriction imposed on land covenanted
F20  35 is as follows:
F20  36 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
F20  37 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F20  38    |^*1No act or thing shall be done or placed or permitted to remain
F20  39 upon the restricted land which, in the opinion of the National Trust,
F20  40 shall injure, prejudice, affect or destroy the natural aspect or
F20  41 condition thereof or the adjoining parts of the dale.
F20  42 **[END QUOTE**]
F20  43 **[END INDENTATION**]
F20  44    |^*0The other stipulations refer to the prohibition of new
F20  45 buildings, mining or quarrying, felling of trees and the planting of
F20  46 conifers, without the permission of the Trust.
F20  47    |^Another rule provides that if the Company decides to sell any of
F20  48 its properties, it must first offer to sell the property to the
F20  49 National Trust.
F20  50    |
F20  51    |^*6T*2HE *0farm which was the Company's first purchase, High
F20  52 Wallabarrow, lies on the Cumberland bank of the Duddon, opposite to
F20  53 the hamlet of Seathwaite in Dunnerdale, and adjoins the National Trust
F20  54 property at Wallabarrow Crag.
F20  55    |^The farm and its fell land are within the area which the Forestry
F20  56 Commission had declined to preserve from commercial afforestation and
F20  57 it was to anticipate a purchase by the Forestry Commission that this
F20  58 farm was acquired by the Company.
F20  59    |^The landscape is a fine example of the beauty characteristic of
F20  60 the Duddon Valley, and the farm house, though in itself a small one,
F20  61 is delightfully situated.
F20  62    |^In 1940, in order to safeguard further this very vital part of
F20  63 the Duddon Valley, the purchase was made of 230 acres of intakes, the
F20  64 small house at Low Wallabarrow and of certain inside land. ^A
F20  65 considerable gift towards the purchase was received from the Friends
F20  66 of the Lake District.
F20  67    |^The next purchase by the Company was Skelwith Farm, which lies to
F20  68 the south of Skelwith Bridge and on the right bank of the River
F20  69 Brathay. ^This farm included an important part of the landscape seen
F20  70 by those going up Langdale from Clappersgate and Ambleside.
F20  71    |^The fell land was immediately threatened by the Forestry
F20  72 Commission, which had refused to exclude the Coniston*- Hawkshead
F20  73 Brathay district from the area in which they desired to carry out
F20  74 commercial afforestation, and a good deal of the lower land offered
F20  75 opportunity for speculative building. ^The purchase of this farm
F20  76 therefore had a high protective value.
F20  77    |
F20  78    |^*6S*2OON *0afterwards the Company purchased, in the north of
F20  79 Lakeland, Rannerdale Farm on Crummock Water. ^This farm which lies on
F20  80 the shores of the Lake was one of the few areas on these shores which
F20  81 were not already protected by restrictive covenants.
F20  82    |^In 1941, the Company extended its interest into a new dale,
F20  83 Ennerdale. ^Here the sheep farm known as Mireside gave a fine
F20  84 opportunity of protecting the landscape. ^The farm had a frontage to
F20  85 Ennerdale Lake. ^A few years later its ownership entitled the Company
F20  86 to be heard when the question of raising Ennerdale Lake was considered
F20  87 at a Public Enquiry.
F20  88    |^Certain fields adjoining Mireside were purchased at a later date,
F20  89 and the farm now has quite an important share in controlling the
F20  90 entrance to Ennerdale and in maintaining its seclusion against
F20  91 exploitation by motor traffic, by reason of the fact that the road up
F20  92 the dale is a private road.
F20  93    |^No further purchase was made until 1944, when two farms*- Ghyll
F20  94 and Buckbarrow*- were purchased at the approach to Wastwater.
F20  95    |^With this purchase the Company now had interests in Duddon,
F20  96 Buttermere, Ennerdale and Wasdale. ^A further farm in Wasdale,
F20  97 Harrowhead Farm, which adjoins Ghyll and Buckbarrow, was purchased in
F20  98 1949.
F20  99    |
F20 100    |^*6L*2ONGHOUSE *0Farm, Duddon, which has a commanding position in
F20 101 Seathwaite in Dunnerdale, by controlling the land at the foot of Walna
F20 102 Scar was purchased in 1948, and is a typical fell farm.
F20 103    |^Now was the time when the prices of farms rose prodigiously and
F20 104 with its limited means the Company was unable to make new purchases
F20 105 for the next few years.
F20 106    |^With the death of a tenant in 1954, however, the Company decided
F20 107 that it must take the opportunity of acquiring cash to be available
F20 108 for other purchases, and Rannerdale which, as previously mentioned,
F20 109 had been placed upon protective covenants to the National Trust, was
F20 110 sold.
F20 111    |^The next year Skelwith Fold was also sold to the tenant, subject
F20 112 to protective covenants. ^When land has been placed under these
F20 113 covenants by the Company, they continue in force and are not weakened
F20 114 by any change of ownership.
F20 115    |
F20 116    |^*6W*2ITH *0the proceeds from the sale of these two farms, the
F20 117 Company again had funds available to make new purchases. ^When, in
F20 118 1955 a small farm, Ghyll Bank, at Boot in Eskdale, came on to the
F20 119 market the Company decided to purchase.
F20 120    |^This farm lies half a mile north of Boot on the Burnmoor Track
F20 121 with fell rights on the northern portion of Burnmoor and the west face
F20 122 of Scafell, extending to the peak of Scafell.
F20 123    |^There was a great danger that it would cease to be a farming unit
F20 124 and that the land would be taken over by adjoining farms and the
F20 125 buildings become ruins, so the farm with its Herdwick sheep flock was
F20 126 bought.
F20 127    |
F20 128    |^*6A *2FARM *0in Patterdale and one in Borrowdale were acquired by
F20 129 the Company in 1957, and, taking the Langdale Pikes as a central
F20 130 point, the Company now owned farms to the north, south, east and west.
F20 131    |^The farm in Patterdale is Howe Green Farm, Hartsop, at the foot
F20 132 of the north side of the Kirkstone Pass, and is as characteristic a
F20 133 fell farm as any which the Company own. ^An interesting feature of
F20 134 this place is an old corn drying kiln, which seems to be of a unique
F20 135 type. ^A generous gift by the late \0Rev. {0H. H.} Symonds made it
F20 136 possible to repair this kiln.
F20 137    |^The farm purchased in Borrowdale is Yew Tree Farm, at Rosthwaite.
F20 138 ^This farm has wide and important fell rights on the Langstrath side
F20 139 of Borrowdale and is of great importance for the Company's objects.
F20 140    |^Since the Company was formed, Lakeland has become a National
F20 141 Park, and the Town and Country Planning Act can prevent the happening
F20 142 of some of the dangers that were envisaged when the Company was
F20 143 formed. ^But by its selective purchases the Company continues to
F20 144 fulfil its general objects by such management of the properties as
F20 145 will safeguard not only the beauty of the landscape but also, and no
F20 146 less important, the traditional livelihood of the dalesmen.
F20 147    |^To people concerned about the furtherance of these objects the
F20 148 Company continues to provide a means where money may be used, and
F20 149 where the donor asks only a low rate of interest, or none at all.
F20 150    |

F20 161 *<*4*"To everyone here it is really home. ^They have no-where else to
F20 162 go,**" says warden Fred Hellowell.*>
F20 163    |^*6W*2HEN *0the German blitzes began in 1940, the Government had
F20 164 many schemes for mothers and children. ^Elderly folk who were bombed
F20 165 out of their homes had no such schemes to help them except in the
F20 166 institutions of those days.
F20 167    |^So a group of conscientious objectors set about to provide
F20 168 private accommodation for the old folk of the big cities whose homes
F20 169 had been wrecked by German bombs. ^An old derelict house in
F20 170 Burton-in-Lonsdale named Stone Bower was taken over.
F20 171    |^An appeal was made for help. ^Someone offered 40 old iron
F20 172 bedsteads and furniture. ^Two of the members of the organising group
F20 173 promised the first year's rent. ^Blankets were forthcoming from the
F20 174 Canadian Red Cross.
F20 175    |^Starting with nothing, the group founded the Stone Bower
F20 176 Fellowship which survives to this day in the village of Silverdale,
F20 177 where 30 men and women live in peaceful security at an 18-bedroom
F20 178 house standing in eight and a half acres of ground.
F20 179    |^Warden of the Fellowship from its inception, and a tireless
F20 180 worker for the home to-day, is \0Mr. Fred Hellowell, and he told me of
F20 181 the history and impact of the enterprise. ^To-day \0Mr. and \0Mrs.
F20 182 Hellowell are joint wardens.
F20 183    |^The pacifist group which founded it were mainly from the
F20 184 Morecambe and Lancashire area. ^The members felt that it provided them
F20 185 with an opportunity for worth-while Christian activity.
F20 186    |^Stone Bower served the elderly folk until 1945, when many of the
F20 187 conscientious objectors began to return to their own jobs. ^Yet 15 old
F20 188 people remained at the home, and they had no homes to which they could
F20 189 go.
F20 190    |
F20 191    |^*6I*2N *0those days the National Assistance Act had not come into
F20 192 force, and there were no homes for old people such as there are
F20 193 to-day. ^The committee of Stone Bower disbanded, but three members
F20 194 felt they ought to carry the Fellowship on as a permanent scheme.
F20 195 ^They were \0Mr. Charles Wade, a Quaker who lived at Bentham; \0Mr.
F20 196 Fred Hellowell and his brother John Hellowell.
F20 197    |^Even though the position looked so difficult they felt that they
F20 198 should continue for the sake of the old people. ^In 1951 the house at
F20 199 Silverdale became available. ^The Fellowship had no funds, but the
F20 200 National Corporation for the Care of Old People, part of the Nuffield
F20 201 Foundation gave *+4,000.
F20 202    |^Another *+1,000 was forthcoming from the Lancashire County
F20 203 Council. ^There was an appeal broadcast by the {0*2B.B.C.}*0
F20 204 ^Altogether *+8,500 was raised, and the house was purchased.
F20 205    |^I toured the fine house at Silverdale, and in a sense I envied
F20 206 the old folk their peace of mind and their security, two essentials to
F20 207 a happy life for those who are old, without homes of their own and
F20 208 with few relatives.
F20 209    |^The scheme has been run on a pocket money basis. ^For the last
F20 210 six or seven years, the staff have received 30\0s. a week pocket money
F20 211 and their keep. ^They were happy to do the job voluntarily. ^*"We
F20 212 felt, and still feel, that our little piece of practical Christian
F20 213 service is to give our services in this way for people in need,**"
F20 214 said \0Mr. Hellowell.
F20 215    |^*6Y*2ET *0in recent weeks there has been such a difficult time
F20 216 that it is being realised that more staff is needed.

F21   7    |^*6T*2HE *0belief that a man is as old as he feels is responsible
F21   8 for a great many pulled muscles. ^A wiser principle to follow is that
F21   9 a man, broadly speaking, is as old as he is. ^He may be older. ^He is
F21  10 unlikely to be younger, and if he is, will do well not to show it
F21  11 unless he cares nothing for the good opinion of his contemporaries.
F21  12    |^Far too much sentimental rubbish has been written about the
F21  13 sadness of taking off cricket boots for the last time, putting away
F21  14 tennis rackets and similar dramatic moments. ^The well-balanced man
F21  15 will take his cricket boots off for the last time with at least as
F21  16 much relief as he has experienced when taking them off on a hundred
F21  17 previous occasions. ^He will waste no time in vain regrets as he
F21  18 struggles with the laces, knowing very well that in all probability he
F21  19 will change his mind next May and put the great heavy things on
F21  20 again*- and that, if he does not, it will be because he doesn't want
F21  21 to. ^Every psychologist knows that nine out of ten men who consciously
F21  22 do something for the last time have been secretly longing to do just
F21  23 that for at least a couple of years. ^Only the mistaken idea that it
F21  24 will be a wrench has held them back.
F21  25    |^Giving things up is, or should be, one of the great consolations
F21  26 of middle age. ^The man of fifty-plus, waving goodbye from his
F21  27 deck-chair with a resigned ~*"Off you go and enjoy yourselves. ~I'm
F21  28 too old for that kind of thing now,**" is a living proof of the
F21  29 essential beneficence of the natural processes. ^There is a strong
F21  30 sense of release. ^The annoyance of not being able to do something as
F21  31 well as he used **[SIC**] can be terminated, the wise man of
F21  32 forty-five suddenly realizes, by not doing it. ^The pity is that he
F21  33 did not realize it at forty.
F21  34    |^This is not to say that middle age is to be a gradual recession
F21  35 from activity of any kind. ^On the contrary it is a time for
F21  36 constantly taking up new pastimes, new interests. ^What must be
F21  37 dropped is those physical leisure-time exercises taken up in youth and
F21  38 now inevitably being performed with diminishing success. ^A man, it
F21  39 has been well said, whose enjoyment consists of constant reminders
F21  40 that he is not as young as he was should take medical advice
F21  41 immediately. ^*1New *0activities, of whatever kind, are free from this
F21  42 fatal defect. ^There is no reason why a man of fifty, or even
F21  43 fifty-five, should not take up cricket if he can find a team
F21  44 sufficiently short of men. ^He is unlikely to overstrain himself by
F21  45 trying to do what he never did in his twenties; nor can he be vexed by
F21  46 loss of form at a game he never played before. ^Indeed he will
F21  47 probably improve for a season or two, and may look forward to reaching
F21  48 his peak at sixty.
F21  49    |^Doctors agree on the therapeutic value of nearly all new skills
F21  50 acquired in late middle age. ^But it must be understood that exercise,
F21  51 as such, has nothing to do with it. ^*"Keeping fit**" is a sign of
F21  52 immaturity, as is any other spare-time occupation that demands
F21  53 continuity of effort. ^The touchstone, for a man of mature years
F21  54 considering what to take up next, must always be ^*"Shall I be able to
F21  55 drop it again without loss of self-respect?**" ^Whether it is good or
F21  56 bad for him, whether it produces anything useful, whether he will get
F21  57 anywhere with it*- these things are beside the point. ^In middle age
F21  58 there are enough things that *1have *0to be done with some ulterior
F21  59 motive; it is folly to take up voluntarily anything that may become a
F21  60 taskmaster.
F21  61    |^Home carpentry, as we have seen in the first of this series of
F21  62 papers, may begin to show itself as early as {0E.M.} *=1, though the
F21  63 main rush of displacement activities is ordinarily delayed until the
F21  64 second period of Middle Middle Age when tennis and dancing are finally
F21  65 dispensed with. ^There is a sure instinct at work here, for carpentry
F21  66 is of all things an occupation that lends itself to being laid down at
F21  67 will, either temporarily or permanently. ^The object under
F21  68 construction is rarely if ever worth completion for itself, nor is
F21  69 some immediate justification for discontinuing the work ({0e.g.} blunt
F21  70 tenon-saw or shortage of 1 1/2*?8 screws) hard to find. ^One has only
F21  71 to compare the study of History, which so many men almost take up in
F21  72 their fifties, to realize that it is worth while spending a little
F21  73 care over the choice of new interests. ^It is not difficult, exactly,
F21  74 to lay down *1the Conquest of Peru *0or \0Vol. *=2 of the Cambridge
F21  75 Mediaeval History once it has been taken up; but it is not easy to
F21  76 feel altogether happy about never taking it up again. ^*'The trouble
F21  77 is,**' as a patient of mine who had had an extraordinary urge to learn
F21  78 something about America once put it, *"that when you have spent a lot
F21  79 of money on two great volumes about the Civil War they glare at you
F21  80 from the shelves for months afterwards. ^You might as well be
F21  81 seventeen again, with both your parents at you for never sticking to
F21  82 anything you start.**"
F21  83    |^We see, then, that the ideal hobbies and relaxations are those
F21  84 that make no demands, stir up no distressful ambitions and, if they
F21  85 have an end-product, have one that need never be reached. ^At the same
F21  86 time they should not be over simplified. ^There should be *1an
F21  87 assemblage of apparatus. ^*0One of the chief factors that age and
F21  88 depress men in middle life, other than bachelors, is the constant
F21  89 spending of money on other people. ^Often, practically all the money
F21  90 expended by a man for his own gratification is provided by his firm
F21  91 through an expense account, which is useful but dull. ^The wise choice
F21  92 of a hobby will enable him from time to time to slip out and buy
F21  93 something*- a tool, a box of flies, an exposure meter, a thing for
F21  94 looking at watermarks with*- out of his own pocket and for himself
F21  95 alone. ^This gives more pleasure than those who have never tried it
F21  96 would readily believe.
F21  97    |^A further advantage in apparatus hobbies is that the laying out
F21  98 process may take so long that there is no time actually to begin. ^The
F21  99 preliminary arrangement, which is often more absorbing and always less
F21 100 exhausting than the operation itself, may last till bedtime if it is
F21 101 conscientiously done. ^One of the happiest and most well-adjusted
F21 102 fishermen I know spends at least one hour sitting on the bank
F21 103 selecting and tying on a fly, drying and re-greasing his line and so
F21 104 on for every ten minutes his fly is actually on the water*- and that
F21 105 of course takes no account of the endless pre-preparatory work he does
F21 106 at home in sorting, retying, gut testing, winding, unwinding and
F21 107 practising knots. ^Painting with oils, for the same reason, is to be
F21 108 preferred to water-colours owing to the multiplicity of tubes, the
F21 109 turps and linseed oil, the scraping and mixing, the additional
F21 110 precautions that must be taken against the possibility of a mess
F21 111 should a start ever be made. ^To be busy but not anxious*- that is the
F21 112 thing. ^You have only to compare a woman cutting out material round
F21 113 paper patterns with her husband making plans, with the aid of
F21 114 innumerable maps and Cook's *1Continental Timetable, *0for next year's
F21 115 holiday*- each, in his and her different ways, indulging in a
F21 116 spare-time relaxation*- to realize the importance of choosing a hobby
F21 117 where mistakes do not matter or, better, where the point at which a
F21 118 mistake would matter is hardly ever reached.
F21 119    |^I am sometimes asked by patients of a serious turn of mind, who
F21 120 would regard philately, say, as too frivolous for them, whether I
F21 121 would advise them to take up writing as a leisure time occupation*-
F21 122 the writing, that is to say, of some worthwhile book, not of a novel
F21 123 and still less of random articles for money. ^It is not unusual for a
F21 124 man in {0L.M.} *=1 or thereabouts to feel this call to perpetuate
F21 125 himself in print, his efforts to perpetuate himself in other ways
F21 126 having reached University age and got too big for their boots, and I
F21 127 do not discourage the urge. ^It is certainly a more wholesome activity
F21 128 for late middle age than *"social work,**" a host of
F21 129 vice-presidencies, and the long debilitating struggle to become a
F21 130 {0J.P.} ^But here again there must be care to ensure that the
F21 131 end-product does not become tiresomely assertive. ^As before, it is
F21 132 the assemblage of the materials that counts*- the note-taking, the
F21 133 comparison of sources, the visits to the British Museum, the constant
F21 134 putting of slips of paper into large volumes*- and a subject must be
F21 135 chosen that will defer the drudgery of actual writing till death. ^Or
F21 136 even later. ^I recently came across a case (not professionally; this
F21 137 was before the days of mediatrics) of a man, a solicitor with no
F21 138 previous knowledge of the subject, who decided on his fiftieth
F21 139 birthday to write a History of Man on a new plan. ^On his death at
F21 140 eighty-four he bequeathed his notes, comparative charts and unreturned
F21 141 library books to his son, then aged fifty-six, with the request that
F21 142 he complete the task by knocking the book together. ^The son occupied
F21 143 twenty-two years very pleasantly in reading through, revising and
F21 144 annotating his father's notes, and it was a grandson, a very
F21 145 well-rounded personality of forty-eight with no leisure-time problems,
F21 146 from whom I heard the story.
F21 147    |^Here is wisdom indeed, when a man can cater not only for his own
F21 148 middle-age and old age relaxations but for those of his descendants as
F21 149 well. ^For we have to remember*- and there is much comfort in the
F21 150 thought*- that the children who may be a grief and vexation to us now
F21 151 will themselves one day be middle-aged, and will then stand in need of
F21 152 all the comfort and advice that we, as old men, can give them.
F21 153    |^I hope in my next paper to suggest a few simple precautions by
F21 154 which what I may call the *1pinpricks *0of middle age may be avoided
F21 155 or at least ameliorated. ^It may seem strange, after the graver
F21 156 problems with which we have already dealt, to concern ourselves with
F21 157 ostensibly minor vexations, but as every mediatrist knows a
F21 158 *1succession *0of pinpricks may be anything but a laughing matter. ^It
F21 159 is by no means unheard of for a man of forty-five or over to have a
F21 160 heart attack simply through lack of care in selecting his reading
F21 161 matter.

F21 164    |^A*2CCORDING *0to the *1Worm Runners' Digest *0(and let's have no
F21 165 giggling at the back there, please; this is a serious subject)
F21 166 experiments are now, right this minute, going forward at Washington
F21 167 University, \0St. Louis, that are enough to curl your hair. ^It seems
F21 168 that Washington University has a \0Dr. Edward Ernhart on its staff,
F21 169 and this \0Dr. Ernhart has made the fairly unattractive discovery that
F21 170 by splitting a worm's head down the middle you get not only, as you
F21 171 might expect, a maladjusted and potentially delinquent worm with a
F21 172 grudge against society in general and \0Dr. Ernhart in particular but
F21 173 a worm with two heads. ^(\0Dr. Ernhart doesn't actually say his
F21 174 patients are maladjusted after treatment but it seems a fair bet.)
F21 175 ^Furthermore this two-headed worm reacts more rapidly to electric
F21 176 shock-light stimulus than do the obsolescent Mark *=1 worms with only
F21 177 one head. ^So there.
F21 178    |^The deeper implications of all this only begin to writhe to the
F21 179 surface when we see that the *1Daily Telegraph, *0whence comes this
F21 180 awesome bulletin, describes the *1Worm Runners' Digest *0as a

F22   2 *<*6THRACIAN PAYS A DIVIDEND*>
F22   3 *<*4By Captain {0C. F.} *"Trader**" *6HORN*>
F22   4 *<*4A salvage award may be the seaman's *'pools prize**'*- but often
F22   5 it is no more than a fourth dividend...*>
F22   6    |^*6S*2ALVAGE! ^*0The very word has a special ring for the sailor,
F22   7 rather like the magic words *"first dividend**" have for the football
F22   8 pools enthusiast ashore. ^The very nature of the sailor's calling very
F22   9 often debars him from taking part in the pools, so any dreams he may
F22  10 have of sudden opulence are usually centred around a share of a big
F22  11 award for salvage at sea.
F22  12    |^Even so, any award he may get won't compare with the fabulous
F22  13 pools' prizes, and he'll undoubtedly have to work extremely hard for
F22  14 it, and possibly face great danger. ^Salvage awards are determined by
F22  15 the Admiralty Courts, which take into account all the risks involved,
F22  16 so even if our sailor chances upon an abandoned luxury liner, lying
F22  17 placidly on a tranquil sea and just waiting to be towed in, it won't
F22  18 bring him a first dividend!
F22  19    |^Marine salvage laws are complex, and one needs to be a Dutch
F22  20 lawyer to understand them. ^Sufficient for the sailor to know the main
F22  21 factors which govern the amount he is likely to get for his prize if,
F22  22 in fact, anything at all!
F22  23    |^Masters of all ships have an express duty to render assistance to
F22  24 persons in danger at sea, oddly enough including enemy subjects in
F22  25 time of war. ^The rescue of ships, lives or cargo from danger is a
F22  26 salvage service, and rewards for such services are paid according to
F22  27 the risks run by the salvors, the value of the property they risk and,
F22  28 of course, what is saved and from what danger.
F22  29    |^The few occasions when I've had a personal interest in a salvage
F22  30 claim*- even when all added together*- haven't produced enough even to
F22  31 buy a coffee stall.
F22  32    |^They all occurred during my service with the Trinity House, which
F22  33 is not altogether surprising when one remembers that ships of the
F22  34 Trinity House Service frequently put to sea on emergency calls, when
F22  35 other ships are running for shelter, and it's usually under just those
F22  36 conditions that help is called for.
F22  37    |^They ranged from drifting bales of raw silk to part cargo from
F22  38 the much-publicized wreck of the *1Flying Enterprise, *0but the
F22  39 biggest one, which initially seemed to spell shore-bound independence,
F22  40 happened in the winter of 1955, just one year before I *'swallowed the
F22  41 anchor**'.
F22  42    |^As is nearly always the case with salvage work, it was one of
F22  43 those nights when sailors envy farmers their jobs*- as black as
F22  44 Egypt's night, pouring with rain and blowing a gale from the
F22  45 south-east.
F22  46    |^We'd had a really dirty passage south from Flamborough Head, and
F22  47 had tucked ourselves close under the lee of Scroby Elbow in Yarmouth
F22  48 Roads for the night. ^Scroby Elbow is a small, natural inlet on the
F22  49 landward side of the Scroby Sands, which run parallel to the Norfolk
F22  50 coast, and quite a big ship can creep in there with local knowledge*-
F22  51 it's the only bit of shelter for miles when the wind's south-easterly
F22  52 in that area.
F22  53    |^I was quite tired and very relieved when I wrote ~*"Finished with
F22  54 engines**" in the logbook, set anchor watches and went below to the
F22  55 wardroom.
F22  56    |^We'd just about settled down to our evening meal when a
F22  57 quartermaster appeared to report a ship on fire about three miles
F22  58 north of us.
F22  59    |^In view of the weather conditions, we'd maintained a full head of
F22  60 steam, so it wasn't long before we were under way and steaming towards
F22  61 the other ship at our best speed. ^I was on the navigating bridge,
F22  62 while the officers mustered the hands to make our boats ready with
F22  63 blankets and medical stores, and prepared the fire-fighting equipment.
F22  64    |^I could tell from the bearing of the ship in distress that she
F22  65 was probably ashore on the northern end of the sandbank, and the
F22  66 flames the quartermaster had seen were actually distress signals which
F22  67 are described in the regulations as *"flames from a burning tar
F22  68 barrel, oil barrel, \0etc.**". ^Soon this was confirmed as she started
F22  69 to fire distress rockets, and I saw the maroon from shore announcing
F22  70 the launching of the Caister lifeboat.
F22  71    |^The lifeboat and the ship I was commanding, the {0*3T.H.V.}
F22  72 *1Warden, *0reached a spot abreast of the grounded ship at the same
F22  73 time, and our motor launch was lowered to assist the lifeboat in the
F22  74 rescue of the crew. ^This tricky manoeuvre was carried out by the
F22  75 lifeboat's crew with an easy coolness, in spite of the foul weather
F22  76 and, as a sailor, I was filled with admiration for the seamanlike way
F22  77 in which it was done.
F22  78    |^When the stranded ship had been abandoned, we approached her as
F22  79 near as possible, with a searchlight playing on the wreck. ^In its
F22  80 powerful beam I could see that she was a steam trawler of some
F22  81 two-hundred and fifty tons, the *1Thracian, *0registered in the port
F22  82 of Grimsby, and I learned later that she was bound for Ostend.
F22  83    |^It was still flood tide (rising) although it had eased, and the
F22  84 force of the wind was great enough to prevent her driving any farther
F22  85 on to the bank. ^This was a good omen, for I hoped that at slack water
F22  86 the gale force weight of the wind might shift her. ^We had to stay by
F22  87 her in any case. ^As a derelict, she was a potential danger to
F22  88 navigation and was, therefore, the responsibility of Trinity House.
F22  89 ^Added to this, in their haste to leave her, the crew had left her
F22  90 navigation lights burning, which could easily be misleading to other
F22  91 shipping.
F22  92    |^My surmise was right, for an hour or so later her bow started to
F22  93 lift to the big ground swell, showing that only her stern was still
F22  94 aground. ^We weighed anchor and approached her still nearer, but with
F22  95 great care, fixing our position constantly, and continuously sounding
F22  96 the depth of water, for this was the moment if we were going to get
F22  97 her off.
F22  98    |^Some of our ratings had already been placed on board *1Thracian
F22  99 *0by *1Warden*0's motor boat, and had put out a fire, on her
F22 100 engine-room skylight, which had been started by the flame distress
F22 101 signals. ^They'd also drawn her stokehold fires, for if they'd been
F22 102 left alight, with no feed water going into the boilers, they might
F22 103 have blown up.
F22 104    |^In a ship drawing fifteen feet, when one is approaching a hidden
F22 105 danger in a full gale and, with the tide setting on one side and the
F22 106 wind pressing on the other, making leeway which cannot be accurately
F22 107 calculated, it is not easy to appear calm as, in sing-song monotony,
F22 108 the soundings are called to the bridge from the leadsman in the
F22 109 chains.
F22 110    |^*"By the mark, three.**"
F22 111    |^*"And a quarter less, three.**"
F22 112    |^This was as near as we could go, with just eighteen inches of
F22 113 water under our keel. ^Now my ship had to be held there, for we were
F22 114 near enough to run a rope away and get it on board the trawler.
F22 115    |^In retrospect, it was an easy job, for there were no snags; but I
F22 116 suspect that I got three more grey hairs during the operation.
F22 117    |^At long last we had the *1Thracian *0secured alongside our
F22 118 starboard side, against huge coir fenders, our launch was hoisted
F22 119 inboard and both ships were in deep water again.
F22 120    |^The weather had worsened, and to leave the comparative shelter of
F22 121 Yarmouth Roads would have been madness. ^Yarmouth Haven is always a
F22 122 tricky place to enter in a south-east wind, and even for an unimpeded
F22 123 ship it would have been hazardous under the prevailing conditions. ^To
F22 124 do so with another vessel in tow was impossible, so I took my tow back
F22 125 to my sheltered anchorage to ride out the storm.
F22 126    |^When daylight came I surveyed my prize. ^She was no luxury liner.
F22 127 ^She certainly looked her part of a derelict, and I learned later that
F22 128 she had been sold for scrap, and a scratch crew were taking her on her
F22 129 last voyage to the Belgian breakers' yard. ^Just my luck, I thought.
F22 130    |^For the next two days it blew really hard without the slightest
F22 131 abatement. ^*1Thracian *0surged and ranged against our ship-side,
F22 132 chewing away the fendering, and fraying and parting the mooring ropes
F22 133 holding the two ships together. ^We dropped her astern, on the end of
F22 134 a seven-inch manilla, for comfort, and she laid comfortably on the ebb
F22 135 tide; but so great was the wind force, that on the flood she kept
F22 136 driving up on us, so there was no respite for the watch on deck.
F22 137    |^Twice we got under way and ran down to the haven entrance, but
F22 138 each time we poked our noses outside the friendly lee of the sands, it
F22 139 was obvious that it was quite hopeless. ^The seas breaking high over
F22 140 the south pier lighthouse, and the gyrating boil between the piers,
F22 141 spelt disaster for anyone ill-advised enough to attempt to cross the
F22 142 bar.
F22 143    |^I learned over the radio-telephone that charges for towage into
F22 144 the port were based on the tonnage of the towing vessel, so I engaged
F22 145 a local tug to do the job for twenty pounds.
F22 146    |^It was more than forty-eight hours after we had plucked the
F22 147 trawler off the sandbank before conditions improved sufficiently to
F22 148 allow us to hand her over to the harbour tug, and be berthed in
F22 149 Yarmouth Haven.
F22 150    |^I deposited a claim for salvage with the Receiver of Wrecks, and
F22 151 learned that I was now a ship owner, and responsible for all debts she
F22 152 incurred, such as harbour dues, moorings, \0etc., until such time as
F22 153 she was handed back to her rightful owner.
F22 154    |^For his part, he had to deposit a considerable sum of money
F22 155 before he could sail her again, pending negotiations on our claim.
F22 156 ^These were quite protracted, and it was many months before we agreed
F22 157 a mutual settlement.
F22 158    |^It wasn't a first dividend*- unless there were a lot of winners
F22 159 that week!
F22 160 *<*2THE LAWS OF *6SALVAGE*>
F22 161    |^A*2S *0salvage operations are often attended by considerable hard
F22 162 work and great risk, the obligation to pay compensation is so
F22 163 obviously based on the principles of justice that payment has been
F22 164 allowed at all times by every civilized country.
F22 165    |^To qualify for salvage, it must be shown that (1) services were
F22 166 rendered voluntarily, (2) there was the chance of destruction if the
F22 167 service had been withheld, and (3) the services rendered were of
F22 168 actual benefit.
F22 169    |^Towage, in most cases, gives no right to compensation payment as
F22 170 distinct from towage fees, and a ship's crew is expected, in the
F22 171 ordinary course of duty, to do all that may be necessary to save their
F22 172 vessel.
F22 173    |^However, if unusual services are performed, or unforeseen perils
F22 174 encountered, a claim is nearly always sustained.
F22 175    |^Salvage laws quote an example of circumstances in which there
F22 176 would be an entitlement to reward. ^If a vessel, whose captain is
F22 177 ignorant of the locality, during a heavy storm is driving towards a
F22 178 dangerous shore, and a pilot, seeing her loss to be inevitable, puts
F22 179 out to sea to assist, he would be entitled to salvage, because his
F22 180 services could not reasonably be expected in return for ordinary
F22 181 pilots' fees.
F22 182    |^In the absence of any prior agreement between the parties as to
F22 183 the rate of *1salvage payable, *0the amount is assessed, as a rule, by
F22 184 the Admiralty Court. ^And in the case of any such agreement having
F22 185 been made, the Court would still set it aside if it considered the
F22 186 amount exorbitant, and that it had been agreed to by the master of the
F22 187 ship under moral compulsion.
F22 188    |^Salvage money is divided in certain proportions between the
F22 189 owners, captain, other officers, and the crew of the *1salving
F22 190 *0vessel.
F22 191 *<*6GIRL DIVERS OF JAPAN*>
F22 192    |^*4E*2VER *0since the tenth century, Japanese girls have been
F22 193 plunging into the waters around their country's coastline, in their
F22 194 search for pearls, and for the seaweed used as fertilizer.
F22 195    |^Known as \*1amas, *0these girls, wearing only shorts and goggles,
F22 196 comb the sea bed for the prize, their sole equipment being a knife
F22 197 with a foot-long blade, and a basket to carry their catch.

F23   2 ^*0The other barges were beached and grounded now, as the Navy had

F23   4 Jean, *0Harry Potter's *1Aidie, *0the *1Ena *0under Captain Alfred

F23   9 towards the Nieuport shore. ^His own brother-in-law, Captain Fred

F23  11    |^As in a mist, Webb saw one hope of salvation: the old Thames tug

F23  13 in tow. ^Now a fresh problem arose: no sooner was the tow-rope secured
F23  14 to the *1Tollesbury *0than Simmons, anxious to put Dunkirk behind him,
F23  15 went ahead fast.
F23  16    |^It was too much for the barge. ^With an unearthly splintering the
F23  17 tug tore her bit-head*- the stout wooden casing of the windlass*-
F23  18 clean out by the roots. ^Again *1Tollesbury *0was adrift on a sea
F23  19 burnished red with the blood of men whose voyaging was over.
F23  20    |
F23  21    |^The day was marked by such courage. ^At Bergues, key strong-point
F23  22 of the western perimeter, the Loyal Regiment had stood fast for two
F23  23 days, but as the line contracted, artillery pressure on the old walled
F23  24 town stepped up. ^To man the stout seventeenth-century ramparts
F23  25 {0Lieut.}-Colonel John Sandie had only 26 officers and 451 men; for
F23  26 the rest of the garrison were stragglers doing their best ... a
F23  27 transport company of ex-London bus-drivers who'd indented for a
F23  28 musketry instructor ... the \0Rev. Alfred Naylor, Deputy Chaplain
F23  29 General, holding one gate of the town for three days with a mixed bag
F23  30 of chaplains. ^Barred from active combat by their cloth, Naylor and
F23  31 his cadre did sterling work questioning suspect fifth-columnists.
F23  32    |^And the civilians weighed in too. ^At Steene, west of the town,
F23  33 General \von Kleist's tanks were advancing steadily, but Mayor Jean
F23  34 Duriez, an industrial alcohol manufacturer, turned the faucets of his
F23  35 ten vast stills to send two million gallons of raw spirit gushing
F23  36 across the already flooded land. ^As Duriez watched a chance artillery
F23  37 shell, exploding like a thunderclap, transformed the waters to a
F23  38 raging sea of flame*- *"like a gigantic Planter's Punch.**" ^In
F23  39 fascinated dread Duriez saw two of \von Kleist's tanks trapped by the
F23  40 torrent, glowing white-hot as the holocaust engulfed them. ^The
F23  41 advance from the west was stalled.
F23  42    |^But by Saturday midday the Loyals could no longer hold Bergues
F23  43 itself. ^Already the troops dug in on the ancient ramparts sweltered
F23  44 from the heat of burning buildings*- the smoke so dense even dispatch
F23  45 riders groped through the town on foot, mouths and noses bound with
F23  46 damp cloths. ^By noon the exposed canal bank beyond the northern
F23  47 ramparts had become the Loyals' last stockade*- with men toppling like
F23  48 ten-pins under devastating artillery fire. ^Now in Captain Henry
F23  49 Joynson's company the troops were so tired the officers had to haul
F23  50 them across the road like sacks of coal.
F23  51    |^Then by a miracle the wind changed*- impelling a black choking
F23  52 banner of smoke from the burning town into the heart of the German
F23  53 lines. ^Even \von Kleist's tanks could no longer advance: the few that
F23  54 did try, foxed by the smoke, tilted disastrously into the canal. ^The
F23  55 infantry advance held off*- though not until 9 {0p.m.} could the
F23  56 Loyals withdraw, doubling between waves of mortar fire towards
F23  57 Dunkirk. ^Many, by order of Major-General Harry Curtis, had left their
F23  58 rifles propped in position. ^Bound with a contraption of string,
F23  59 weights and slow-burning candles, they would keep firing at intervals,
F23  60 creating the illusion of a tough task force still on the alert.
F23  61    |^Three miles to the east the East Lancashire Regiment had it as
F23  62 bad; with all ammunition spent, their 1st Battalion fell back towards
F23  63 Dunkirk, only a forty-strong force under Captain Harold
F23  64 Ervine-Andrews, to cover the thousand-yard front as they withdrew. ^A
F23  65 thick-set, heavily-built Irishman, Andrews was venerated by his men
F23  66 for his genially informal manner, though senior officers were less
F23  67 sure of him. ^On pre-war service in India and China his feats had
F23  68 become an eccentric legend*- walking fifty-six miles for a *+5 bet,
F23  69 shooting a black buck in the jungle, then carrying it home draped
F23  70 round his shoulders.
F23  71    |^All that night Andrews and his men crouched under annihilating
F23  72 shellfire until it seemed the end was near. ^Already they had been
F23  73 blasted from their farmhouse quarters; now the Dutch barn to which
F23  74 they'd retreated was in flames, too. ^As they doubled behind a hedge,
F23  75 sparks and blazing straw eddying, they sighted the German infantry
F23  76 moving in a spaced dangerous line through growing dusk.
F23  77    |^Andrews exhorted his men: ^*"Look, there are 500 of them, maybe
F23  78 thirty-six of us*- let them get a bit closer and then here goes.**"
F23  79 ^His whistle shrilling, Andrews leapt forward, weaving towards the
F23  80 advancing hordes like a footballer moving in to tackle. ^As the
F23  81 howling mob of East \0Lancs followed at his heels the Germans fell
F23  82 back, seeking cover.
F23  83    |^Scrambling to the roof of a barn with a rifle, Andrews picked off
F23  84 no less than seventeen Germans*- then seizing a bren-gun, he lunged
F23  85 forward again. ^Private John Taylor, in the thick of it, recalls:
F23  86 ^*"It was a right do*- when the ammo ran low we kicked, choked, even
F23  87 bit them.**" ^After fifteen blood-stained minutes the Germans fell
F23  88 back in confusion. ^The line was held*- but Andrews after sending his
F23  89 wounded to the rear, was down to eight men now.
F23  90    |^Resolutely, at the head of his little band, he struck
F23  91 across-country splashing for a quarter of a mile through the flooded
F23  92 fields towards Dunkirk. ^He was to win the first Victoria Cross
F23  93 awarded to any officer in World War Two.
F23  94    |
F23  95    |^On the beaches, the savage fury of the attack had one result. ^By
F23  96 *=1 {0p.m.}*- six hours after the raid began*- every man and woman
F23  97 still left had one resolve: the only thing that mattered now was the
F23  98 lives of others.
F23  99    |^Jog-trotting along the Eastern Mole, Colonel Sidney Harrison's
F23 100 6th Lincolns had their own wounded slung like sacks over their
F23 101 shoulders*- but they stumbled on, negotiating yawning four-foot gaps
F23 102 somehow, loading them on to ship after ship. ^In the shadow of the
F23 103 Mole, Gunner Albert Collins saw an officer bent on a task to tax
F23 104 Samson: a rope bound like a yoke round his forehead, he swam valiantly
F23 105 for a Dutch \*1schuit, *0towing a Carley float with six men aboard.
F23 106    |^Lance-Bombardier George Brockerton took risks as great as any
F23 107 he'd taken as a Wall of Death trick cyclist: finding eighty-one men
F23 108 trapped in a bombed cellar he worked for two hours to free them with
F23 109 hammer and chisel, using French hand-grenades in lieu of gelignite.
F23 110 ^Oblivious to the crash of bombs, he helped out every man, then, to
F23 111 keep their peckers up, did some conjuring tricks.
F23 112    |^Private Walter Allington of the Lincolns was in his element too.
F23 113 ^Already he'd spent one whole night trying to help a man crazed by a
F23 114 head wound ... then, taking a vest and shirt, he'd plugged a terrible
F23 115 hole in another man's shoulder. ^Now, despite the writhing pains in
F23 116 his abdomen, he saw a bullet aimed at the diving Stukas had gone too
F23 117 low. ^A long way off, a man had fallen, the bullet lodging in the
F23 118 small of his back.
F23 119    |^Somehow, though other men were nearer, Allington was again first
F23 120 to help*- but the big gentle man had used his only field-dressing on
F23 121 that Belgian cripple. ^Working doggedly on his own, he found an
F23 122 abandoned ambulance, checked it was in running order, and loaded the
F23 123 man aboard. ^Then, despite the swooping Stukas, he drove until the
F23 124 Channel water was lapping over the bonnet. ^Standing on the roof of
F23 125 the truck, he flagged a destroyer's whaler to ferry the man away.
F23 126    |^Everywhere men plumbed unsuspected depths in themselves.
F23 127 ^Brigadier Evelyn Barker was at the water's edge when a shell dropped
F23 128 close, shattering a soldier's arm so that it hung by a thread.
F23 129 ^Without more ado Barker borrowed a knife from his Brigade Major and
F23 130 honed it on a carborundum stone as coolly as a butcher. ^Lacking
F23 131 narcotics, he first gave the man a nip of cherry brandy before taking
F23 132 his arm off at the shoulder.
F23 133    |^Then improving a tourniquet with handkerchief and pencil, Barker
F23 134 and his aide carried their patient along the beach on a mackintosh to
F23 135 place him in a doctor's charge.
F23 136    |^Able Seaman Samuel Palmer, with twenty years' naval service,
F23 137 didn't know a crankshaft from a camshaft but he took the motor yacht
F23 138 *1Naiad Errant *0over with a crew of three*- then after losing them
F23 139 took her back with nine thankful Tommies, helping out the one engine
F23 140 still operative with paddles fashioned from shattered doors. ^Stoker
F23 141 David Banks from Sheerness did even better ... making seven trips as
F23 142 skipper of the motor-boat *1Pauleter ... *0doing his trick at the
F23 143 wheel ... manning the bren-gun when the Stukas dived ... rescuing 400
F23 144 single-handed. ^Off the same beaches Commander Charles Lightoller,
F23 145 former second officer of the *1Titanic, *0was packing them in aboard
F23 146 his yacht *1Sundowner: *0his biggest kick was the stupefaction of
F23 147 Ramsgate's naval authorities when they found his 60-footer had brought
F23 148 back 130 men.
F23 149    |^The tiros were well to the fore. ^Captain *"Paddy**" Atley of the
F23 150 East \0Yorks found the barge *1Ena *0grounded where Lemon Webb's
F23 151 flotilla had lain, took her back with forty men, on the strength of
F23 152 five sailing holidays in Norfolk. ^It took fourteen hours, including a
F23 153 surprise return to Dunkirk, but they made it finally. ^Captain David
F23 154 Strangeways of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment hit on another barge,
F23 155 appropriately named the *1Iron Duke. ^*0Naked save for the skipper's
F23 156 doormat, which he wore like a sarong, Strangeways brought back
F23 157 twenty-six men, navigating with compass and school atlas.
F23 158    |^To the doctors, life-saving was a dedication, but it was an
F23 159 uphill fight now. ^In Private William Horne's ambulance unit the only
F23 160 medication to deal with searing phosphorous burns was a bottle of
F23 161 acriflavine tablets diluted in water. ^At Rosendael, the dressings
F23 162 were all but exhausted; Major Philip Newman, the surgeon, did one last
F23 163 amputation by torchlight, then gave up. ^The ambulance unit at La
F23 164 Panne had packed up, too, after a record 2,000 operations in one week,
F23 165 but many doctors carried on as and how they could.
F23 166    |^Where equipment was lacking, they improvised. ^Captain William
F23 167 MacDonald, in a dugout in the dunes, sterilised wounds with abandoned
F23 168 petrol. ^Captain Joseph Reynolds, lacking the Thomas splints used for
F23 169 compound fractures, secured fractured femurs with rifles. ^And scores
F23 170 cut off from their units or families lent a ready hand ... slicing up
F23 171 battledress trousers to make bandages ... ransacking abandoned homes
F23 172 for sheets ... pretty Solange Bisiaux, a French doctor's wife,
F23 173 wringing out blood-stained bandages in salt water ... other men
F23 174 working eight to a relay to carry stretchers on board the ships.
F23 175    |^Round every ambulance and aid-post Sapper George Brooks noted the
F23 176 same hushed aura: the *"undercurrent of grief that moves like a wind
F23 177 when a coffin is carried from a house.**"
F23 178    |^Injuries or no, some men were determined to make the journey
F23 179 home. ^Lieutenant {0J. P.} Walsh of the Loyals, knocked down by a
F23 180 lorry near Bergues, still plodded the five miles to Dunkirk: later the
F23 181 surgeons found his pelvis was fractured. ^Captain John Whitty of the
F23 182 Royal West Kents, wounded in the stomach, slogged some of the fifty
F23 183 miles from Fle*?5tre, where his battalion was trapped, then, at last
F23 184 gasp, hailed a passing motor-cyclist and rode pillion to the beaches.
F23 185 ^Bundled into an ambulance and driven to the Mole, Whitty found the
F23 186 wait tedious; he climbed out, exhorting other wounded to follow him,
F23 187 and got them all passages on a home-bound boat.
F23 188    |^There was the same spirit on the ships. ^Aboard the trawler
F23 189 *1Brock, *0a Surgeon-Lieutenant coped with grievous burn cases and a
F23 190 shortage of tannic acid by filling a zinc bath with tea and immersing
F23 191 his patients up to their necks. ^The destroyer *1Whitehall's *0doctor,
F23 192 Surgeon-Lieutenant David Brown, went so swiftly to aid the wounded
F23 193 aboard the minesweeper *1Jackeve *0that he left his instruments
F23 194 behind. ^Nothing loth, he amputated with the engine-room's hacksaw,
F23 195 sterilised with blazing chloroform, the ex-trawler's fish hatch
F23 196 serving as operating table.

F24   2 ^*0Consuelo thought that the one from Queen Victoria should have been
F24   3 handed to her on a silver platter. ^In due course she was lectured on
F24   4 the various families whose pedigrees, titles and positions she would
F24   5 have to learn by heart.
F24   6    |^They went for a trip in the Mediterranean, the voyage across the
F24   7 Atlantic being made more depressing for her on account of the Duke's
F24   8 seasickness and consequent melancholy. ^They saw the usual places in
F24   9 Spain and then visited Monaco, where the sight of fair women and
F24  10 well-groomed men pleased her. ^Her husband seemed to know many of
F24  11 them, but replied evasively when asked who they were. ^She later
F24  12 learnt that the women were of *'easy virtue**', owing to which social
F24  13 stigma she could not even claim acquaintance with certain of their
F24  14 male companions who had once been her suitors. ^The importance of the
F24  15 family into which she had married was impressed on her by the Duke,
F24  16 who described her as *'a link in the chain**', and she perceived that
F24  17 her first duty was to perpetuate the house of Marlborough. ^After
F24  18 seeing something of Italy and making an uncomfortable trip up the
F24  19 Nile, they stayed at the Hotel Bristol in Paris, where her husband
F24  20 behaved as her mother had done and chose her gowns.
F24  21    |^In London at last she was made acquainted with the Churchill
F24  22 clan, some of whom seemed to believe that all Americans lived on
F24  23 plantations with negro slaves, in daily dread of Red Indians with
F24  24 scalping knives. ^She was introduced to an intimidating old lady, her
F24  25 husband's grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, who had
F24  26 made Lady Randolph Churchill's life so uncomfortable at Blenheim, and
F24  27 who now, using an ear-trumpet, embarrassed Consuelo with an order and
F24  28 a question: ^*'Your first duty is to have a child, and it must be a
F24  29 son, because it would be intolerable to have that little upstart
F24  30 Winston become Duke. ^Are you in the family way?**' ^They proceeded to
F24  31 the family stud at Blenheim, being received by the mayor and
F24  32 corporation of Woodstock. ^Having delivered his speech of welcome, the
F24  33 mayor said to her: ^*'Your Grace will no doubt be interested to know
F24  34 that Woodstock had a mayor and a corporation before America was
F24  35 discovered.**' ^Meditating on this weighty pronouncement she got into
F24  36 the carriage, which was dragged by the townsmen to the palace amid
F24  37 tumultuous cheers and beneath triumphal arches.
F24  38    |^At Blenheim she discovered that she not only had to learn the
F24  39 pedigrees of the nobility but the social grades of the servants. ^One
F24  40 day she rang the bell and asked the butler to put a match to the fire.
F24  41 ^*'I will send the footman, your Grace.**' ^*'Oh, don't bother! ^I'll
F24  42 do it myself.**' ^The domestic hierarchy resembled a modern trade
F24  43 union.
F24  44    |^She dreaded the ceremonious dinners with her husband, who had a
F24  45 habit of filling his plate with food, pushing it away with refined
F24  46 gestures, doing the same to the feeding and drinking utensils, backing
F24  47 his chair, crossing his legs, twirling a ring on his finger, and
F24  48 remaining for perhaps fifteen minutes in a state of abstraction; after
F24  49 which he would come to life, eat his food with much deliberation, and
F24  50 complain that it was cold. ^When inured to this process, she filled in
F24  51 the time by knitting. ^They seldom spoke. ^She thought him arrogant,
F24  52 despising everything not British, and her pride was hurt. ^On the
F24  53 other hand, *'that little upstart Winston**' was one of the few
F24  54 Churchills she liked. ^He was lively, enthusiastic and stimulating,
F24  55 the very opposite of his cousin the Duke, but of course he had the
F24  56 advantage of being half-American. ^She did her best to hit it off with
F24  57 the rest of the family, though the Dowager Duchess was heard to say:
F24  58 ^*'Her Grace does not realise the importance of her position.**' ^She
F24  59 had much to do at Blenheim, entertaining social and political
F24  60 big-wigs, visiting the poor, writing letters, supervising the running
F24  61 of the house. ^As they had never found love, she and her husband had
F24  62 none to lose; but the strain of maintaining the social and physical
F24  63 relationship essential to her position as a breeding duchess was never
F24  64 eased and steadily grew. ^In 1900 she was temporarily released from
F24  65 the Duke, who went to South Africa as Assistant Military Secretary to
F24  66 Lord Roberts; but the following year he became Under-Secretary of
F24  67 State for the Colonies, and she had to learn all about the leading
F24  68 colonials who were entertained at Blenheim.
F24  69    |^Sometimes she received unexpected compliments. ^Having undergone
F24  70 the ordeal of presentation at a Drawing-room, whereat the Prince and
F24  71 Princess of Wales represented Queen Victoria, her mother-in-law Lady
F24  72 Blandford, the practical joker, said that no one would take her for an
F24  73 American. ^*'What would you think if I said you were not at all like
F24  74 an Englishwoman?**' asked Consuelo. ^*'Oh, that's quite different!**'
F24  75 ^*'Different to you, but not to me.**' ^Occasionally she was reproved
F24  76 for behaviour unbecoming to a duchess. ^At a dinner in honour of the
F24  77 Prince and Princess of Wales she wore a diamond crescent instead of
F24  78 the usual tiara. ^The Prince stared at it and said: ^*'The Princess
F24  79 has taken the trouble to wear a tiara. ^Why have you not done so?**'
F24  80 ^She found all these functions intolerably boring, and the racing at
F24  81 Newmarket equally so. ^She had to accompany her husband to
F24  82 Leicestershire for the hunting, which gave her no pleasure, and she
F24  83 made the fatal error of letting her mind wander away from horses and
F24  84 hounds and foxes into the realm of good deeds. ^Hearing, during one
F24  85 hunting season, that there was much unemployment and hardship at
F24  86 Woodstock, she sent money to provide work. ^The obliged recipients
F24  87 wrote a letter of thanks to her husband, then exclusively occupied
F24  88 with the solemn matter of fox-chasing. ^He was amazed to hear that the
F24  89 roads on his estate had been repaired, displeased to receive
F24  90 expressions of gratitude for what he had not done, and quickly
F24  91 informed his wife that she was not entitled to act in that manner
F24  92 without his approval.
F24  93    |^However he was good enough to approve the births of her two sons.
F24  94 ^She was unconscious for a week after the birth of her first, but
F24  95 recovered quickly on regaining consciousness. ^Following the arrival
F24  96 of the second, she reflected that she had done her duty to the dukedom
F24  97 and could now please herself. ^But life's realities were kept at bay
F24  98 in the splendour of Blenheim, and she became more and more bored by
F24  99 the necessity of walking *'on an endlessly spread red carpet**'.
F24 100 ^Moreover the conversation of the nobility made little appeal to her,
F24 101 and when she met a number of Austrian aristocrats in Vienna she
F24 102 thought it *'a pity that they could express their thoughts in so many
F24 103 different languages when they had so few thoughts to express**'.
F24 104    |^Queen Victoria died in January 1901, and when Consuelo spent some
F24 105 weeks in Paris that spring in the agreeable company of her father she
F24 106 was depressed by having to wear black clothes. ^All she dared do was
F24 107 to wear white gloves, thereby earning a lecture at Longchamps from the
F24 108 Duchess of Devonshire, who had been a leader of the fast set a
F24 109 generation before but was now a raddled old woman in a brown wig, her
F24 110 wrinkles filled with paint, her mouth a red slash. ^How, she asked,
F24 111 could Consuelo show so little respect to the memory of a great Queen
F24 112 as to exhibit white gloves? ^As the shocked lady was an incorrigible
F24 113 gossip, Consuelo's impropriety no doubt received much publicity; in
F24 114 spite of which she was chosen to act as canopy-bearer to the new Queen
F24 115 at the coronation of Edward *=7, her fellow-bearers being the
F24 116 Duchesses of Portland, Montrose and Sutherland. ^When Alexandra was
F24 117 anointed by the old Archbishop of Canterbury they held the canopy over
F24 118 her. ^The oil was placed on her forehead by his shaky hand and a
F24 119 little trickled down her nose. ^She did not move a muscle but her eyes
F24 120 expressed anguish.
F24 121    |^After eleven years of nervous stress, either waiting for the
F24 122 Duke, who was invariably late for lunch, or being with him, which was
F24 123 worse, Consuelo pined for relaxation, and they agreed to separate, the
F24 124 arrangement giving them equal custody of the children. ^In those days
F24 125 divorce was difficult and still scandalous, and since neither of them
F24 126 wished to marry again a legal separation met the case. ^It was
F24 127 estimated that about ten million of the Vanderbilt dollars had been
F24 128 spent on Blenheim and their London house, and as she had produced his
F24 129 heirs the Duke had no cause to complain. ^She went to live at
F24 130 Sunderland House, built for her as a present from her father, and here
F24 131 she gave musical parties. ^She also became absorbed in social work,
F24 132 starting a home for women whose husbands were in prison and a
F24 133 recreation centre for working girls. ^She sat on a national committee
F24 134 which enquired into the decline of the birth-rate, and obtained a
F24 135 donation of a hundred thousand guineas for the removal of Bedford
F24 136 College, of which she was \0Hon. Treasurer, from Baker Street to
F24 137 Regent's Park. ^Her mother, who had become \0Mrs Oliver Belmont since
F24 138 her divorce, led the women's suffrage movement in the United States,
F24 139 and when the 1914 war broke out Consuelo worked for the American
F24 140 Women's War Relief Fund, collecting a lot of money by writing and
F24 141 lecturing. ^To enable women to be represented by their own sex on
F24 142 municipal councils, she founded a Women's Municipal Party, and when a
F24 143 vacancy occurred on the London County Council she sat for North
F24 144 Southwark. ^At the election of 1919 she stood as a Progressive for
F24 145 that borough and topped the poll.
F24 146    |^When the 1914-18 war came to an end the moral standards were
F24 147 loosened and she obtained a divorce from the Duke. ^In July '21 she
F24 148 married Jacques Balsan at the Chapel Royal, Savoy, where divorced
F24 149 persons were treated with indulgence. ^He had been an airman in the
F24 150 war, and a balloonist before that, several times staying at Blenheim.
F24 151 ^His nature appealed wholly to hers, and they were very happy
F24 152 together. ^The Duke had now become a Roman Catholic, and as he wished
F24 153 to marry another American, Gladys Deacon, he asked Consuelo to get
F24 154 their own marriage annulled. ^Since Jacques Balsan was a Roman
F24 155 Catholic and she wished to appease his family, she granted the Duke's
F24 156 request. ^Her only way of doing so was to swear that she had been
F24 157 married to him against her will. ^She was now on friendly terms with
F24 158 her mother, who consented to make the declaration, testifying before
F24 159 an English tribunal of Catholic priests, that *'when I issued an order
F24 160 nobody discussed it. ^I therefore did not beg, but ordered her to
F24 161 marry the Duke**'. ^The annulment being granted, Consuelo married
F24 162 Jacques in a Catholic church, and was affectionately received by his
F24 163 family at Cha*?5teauroux. ^They then settled down in Paris, and soon
F24 164 she was busy helping to raise money for the construction of a hospital
F24 165 for the middle classes, receiving the Legion of Honour in 1931. ^Three
F24 166 years later her son succeeded his father as tenth Duke of Marlborough.
F24 167    |^Consuelo and Jacques built a house on the Riviera and took a
F24 168 cha*?5teau at \0St Georges-Motel, where her philanthropic work
F24 169 continued. ^Like so many others, they had to bolt when the Germans
F24 170 entered France in 1940. ^With difficulty they escaped to Spain, and
F24 171 thence to Portugal, where they got a plane across the Atlantic. ^And
F24 172 so her story ends.

F24 178 to reflect that if \0Mrs Vanderbilt had aimed a little lower and
F24 179 married Consuelo to a lesser title but more imposing figure, the story
F24 180 of an eminent English statesman, George Nathaniel Curzon, would have
F24 181 been vastly different. ^Like Marlborough, Curzon married for money,
F24 182 but the union, unlike Marlborough's, became a marriage of hearts.
F24 183 ^Being an intelligent man, Curzon would have been influenced by
F24 184 Consuelo, who might have fallen in love with him but would never have
F24 185 allowed her critical sense to remain dormant on that account.

F25   2 ^*0Although the offender made amends by marrying the girl, he never
F25   3 managed to regain the favour of his General, who nominated a wealthy
F25   4 Cuban landowner, Porcallo \de Figueroa, in his place. ^It was an
F25   5 unfortunate appointment. ^Porcallo \de Figueroa's main interest in the
F25   6 venture was to acquire slaves for his estates, and although he
F25   7 enriched the expedition with ample supplies and equipment, he
F25   8 unashamedly abandoned it the moment he realized how dearly the savages
F25   9 of Florida would sell their freedom.
F25  10    |^The rank and file of the expedition were drawn from many parts of
F25  11 the Emperor's wide domains, and even from lands beyond. ^A
F25  12 particularly large and well-armed contingent came from Portugal, and
F25  13 it is to one of these Portuguese adventurers, known as the Gentleman
F25  14 of Elvas, that we owe the most circumstantial first-hand account of
F25  15 the expedition. ^Amongst volunteers of other nationality we find
F25  16 mention of a French priest from Paris, Biscayan carpenters, a Genoa
F25  17 master-craftsman who could construct anything from a bridge to a
F25  18 brigantine, a Spaniard reared in England, and even an unnamed
F25  19 Englishman whose skill with the long-bow matched that of the Indians.
F25  20 ^In addition to the fighting-men, there were a few women, numerous
F25  21 native servants and negro slaves, more than two hundred horses, and a
F25  22 pack of ferocious mastiffs trained to track down, guard, or tear
F25  23 recalcitrant Indians to pieces. ^A herd of swine*- possibly the
F25  24 ancestors of the razor-backs of the south-west today*- were taken
F25  25 along to serve as a reserve of pork rations.
F25  26    |^\De Soto opened operations by sending Captain Juan \de An*?4asco
F25  27 to reconnoitre the coast of Florida for a harbour where the main
F25  28 expedition could disembark. ^The Comptroller returned without
F25  29 discovering anything suitable, and \de Soto was obliged to make his
F25  30 landfall somewhere in the capacious, many-armed Bahi*?2a \del
F25  31 Espi*?2ritu Santo, now known as Tampa Bay, which had been the starting
F25  32 point for the ill-fated Narva*?2ez expedition eleven years before.
F25  33 ^The Spaniards were in jubilant mood. ^Juan \de An*?4asco had managed
F25  34 to kidnap a couple of savages from whose outlandish speech and vague
F25  35 signs they hopefully deduced the proximity of abundant gold. ^The
F25  36 soldiers boasted that their General had once helped to win the hoarded
F25  37 wealth of the Incas and would now surely lead them to still more
F25  38 fabulous treasure. ^They saw before them a virgin land, lush and
F25  39 sweet-scented in its spring freshness. ^The first to land returned
F25  40 with armfuls of rich grass for the exhausted horses and clusters of
F25  41 wild grapes for their comrades. ^Florida seemed a promised land
F25  42 indeed.
F25  43    |^It was not until some days later that the first Indians were
F25  44 encountered. ^Amongst them was a man, all but indistinguishable from
F25  45 the natives, whom the Spaniards almost rode down. ^Luckily for himself
F25  46 and his rescuers, he was spared just in time on account of the few
F25  47 disjointed words of Castillian **[SIC**] which he called out. ^It was
F25  48 Juan Ortiz, the sailor who had fallen into the hands of the Indians
F25  49 eleven years before when serving with the Narva*?2ez expedition, and who
F25  50 had survived by turning native. ^The adhesion of this man to \de Soto's
F25  51 forces proved to be an event of major importance. ^Now, for the first
F25  52 time, the Spaniards could count on a trustworthy interpreter familiar
F25  53 with the language and mentality of the Florida Indians.
F25  54    |^Through Ortiz, \de Soto was able to establish contact with
F25  55 Mucozo, the chieftain who had befriended him. ^After bestowing gifts
F25  56 of clothes, weapons, and a fine horse, \de Soto came briskly to the
F25  57 point and asked whether Mucozo had knowledge of any land where gold
F25  58 and silver were to be found. ^The Indian replied simply that he knew
F25  59 nothing of such things, as he had never ventured further than a dozen
F25  60 leagues from his dwelling place; but some thirty leagues off, he
F25  61 added, there lived a more powerful chief called Paracoxi in a land of
F25  62 rich maize-fields. ^\De Soto forthwith despatched a captain to seek
F25  63 him out. ^But Paracoxi, though professing friendship, was distrustful
F25  64 of the Spaniards and went into hiding. ^His messengers told the
F25  65 Spaniards that they could find what they were seeking to the west, at
F25  66 a place called Cale, *'where summer reigned for most of the year, and
F25  67 men wore golden hats like helmets**'. ^A number of Paracoxi's men, in
F25  68 token of friendship and in hope of plunder, offered to accompany the
F25  69 Spaniards.
F25  70    |^To Cale, then, \de Soto decided to march. ^A garrison of one
F25  71 hundred men was left behind as a base, and a small ship sent back to
F25  72 convey Porcallo \de Figueroa, already disillusioned with the prospects
F25  73 of Florida as a slave reserve, to Cuba. ^The hardships of the campaign
F25  74 now began in grim earnest. ^The trail which the Spaniards followed led
F25  75 across a marsh, which the foot soldiers crossed by a makeshift bridge
F25  76 and the horses with the help of a hawser. ^Food was short.
F25  77 ^Water-cress and palmetto leaves were poor sustenance for men on the
F25  78 march, and even the maize they had found at Cale was a mean substitute
F25  79 for the gold they had looked for. ^Since few Indians had been
F25  80 captured, the Spaniards had to attend to their own needs themselves,
F25  81 pounding the maize laboriously in mortars of hollowed log with the
F25  82 help of wooden pestles, and then sifting the flour through their
F25  83 shirts of mail, or munching the parched grains whole when they lacked
F25  84 the patience for this labour. ^But visions of ease and plenty beckoned
F25  85 them on; in Apalache, the natives assured them, they would find
F25  86 everything they desired.
F25  87    |^Before leaving Cale, the Spaniards suffered a loss which, though
F25  88 trivial in itself, throws light on the scale of values prevailing
F25  89 amongst the conquistadores and was deeply lamented throughout the
F25  90 army. ^Bruto, the most redoubtable and sagacious of their mastiffs,
F25  91 fell a victim to Indian arrows. ^The incident occurred when a force of
F25  92 hostile braves suddenly appeared on the further bank of a river which
F25  93 the Spaniards were preparing to cross. ^Before his masters could hold
F25  94 him back, Bruto broke away from the page who held his leash and made
F25  95 straight for the enemy. ^The stream was broad and swift, and the
F25  96 animal's head presented an easy target for the Indian marksmen. ^He
F25  97 succeeded in reaching the far side only to fall dead as he struggled
F25  98 from the water, his head and shoulders pierced, so Garcilaso declares,
F25  99 by more than fifty arrows. ^Thus did Bruto join the shades of Ponce
F25 100 \de Leo*?2n's Becerillo and the latter's Leoncillo, who won for his
F25 101 master Balboa more than two thousand pesos of gold as his share of
F25 102 plunder, in the Valhalla of the Spaniards' war-dogs.
F25 103    |^As the army toiled across the water-logged wilderness towards
F25 104 Apalache, the soldiers became aware that they were heading for regions
F25 105 through which, like the men of Narva*?2ez, they might be unable to
F25 106 force a path. ^Some began to murmur that they should turn back while
F25 107 there was yet time. ^But \de Soto was inflexible, refusing to admit
F25 108 that what others found impossible would be impossible for him.
F25 109 ^Meanwhile, there were more immediate dangers to face. ^The natives
F25 110 were professing friendship, but \de Soto suspected treachery,
F25 111 especially when they began to assemble powerful forces on the pretext
F25 112 that they had come to honour the strangers by staging a ceremonial
F25 113 parade. ^The Spaniards resolved to strike first, and fell upon them in
F25 114 a stretch of open country bounded by two lakes. ^The Indians, taken by
F25 115 surprise could offer little resistance. ^More than three hundred of
F25 116 them were run down and lanced, a few managed to escape into the
F25 117 forests, while the rest sought safety in the lakes. ^Grimly the
F25 118 Spaniards posted themselves around the water and tried to shoot down
F25 119 the fugitives with cross-bows and arquebus. ^Cold and exhaustion at
F25 120 length forced the Indians to make for the shore under cover of
F25 121 darkness, their heads camouflaged with the leaves of aquatic plants.
F25 122 ^But the horsemen were waiting for them, and would charge into the
F25 123 water, forcing the Indians to give themselves up or turn back. ^Juan
F25 124 Ortiz called to them loudly in the Indian tongue, bidding them come
F25 125 forth if they would save their lives. ^One after another, the braves
F25 126 struggled from the water and gave themselves up, until only a dozen or
F25 127 so, the strongest and most stubborn, remained in the water. ^Finally,
F25 128 \de Soto ordered his native auxiliaries to plunge in after them. ^The
F25 129 last of the enemy were dragged out by the hair, more dead than alive,
F25 130 put into chains, and divided up amongst their captors with the rest.
F25 131 ^Garcilaso says that, as a result of this battle and the trapping of
F25 132 the Indians in the lakes, more than nine hundred fell captive to the
F25 133 Spaniards.
F25 134    |^But these warlike savages were not the stuff of which slaves
F25 135 could be made, and they soon turned on their captors. ^One day, when
F25 136 the Spaniards had just finished eating, the captive chieftain who had
F25 137 been seated beside \de Soto *'rose to his feet with all conceivable
F25 138 savagery and ferocity and closed at once with the Adelantado. ^Seizing
F25 139 him by the collar with his left hand, he gave him such a blow over the
F25 140 eyes, mouth and nose with his right fist that he knocked down the
F25 141 chair in which he was seated and stretched him out senseless on his
F25 142 back as if he had been a child. ^Then, to finish off his victim, he
F25 143 let himself fall upon him, whilst at the same time giving such a
F25 144 tremendous roar that it could be heard a quarter of a league
F25 145 around.**' ^This roar was the signal for the other captives to set
F25 146 upon their masters throughout the camp. ^*'As weapons, they made use
F25 147 of the burning wood from the fire or other things found at hand; many
F25 148 struck their masters in the face and burned them with pots of boiling
F25 149 food, others struck them with plates, crocks, jars, and pitchers,
F25 150 whilst others again used chairs, benches, and tables if they were to
F25 151 be had, and if not, anything else that came to hand.**' ^But the
F25 152 revolt of the fettered savages*- as desperate a piece of tragic
F25 153 slapstick as can be found in the annals of the Conquista*- could end
F25 154 only in one way. ^Their bruised and resentful masters restored order
F25 155 and sent the captives off to execution. ^Those who were not struck
F25 156 down at once were bound to stakes and then shot to death by the
F25 157 Indians whom the Spaniards had brought along with them from the
F25 158 friendly tribe of Paracoxi.
F25 159    |^It was now the end of October, and the army pushed on through
F25 160 swamps and lurking Indian ambushes towards Apalache. ^They were
F25 161 approaching a fertile country, with numerous settlements and
F25 162 plantations of maize and beans. ^Here Narva*?2ez had quartered his
F25 163 army and sought in vain for the rumoured hoards of gold. ^The coast
F25 164 was only some ten leagues away, but the maze of creeks and marsh land
F25 165 which fringed it thwarted the attempts of reconnaissance parties to
F25 166 break through to the open sea. ^At length they reached a lagoon on the
F25 167 shores of which were traces of an abandoned camp. ^Heaps of charcoal
F25 168 ashes marked the spot where a forge had once been built, and the
F25 169 ground was strewn with the skulls of horses. ^The Spaniards had
F25 170 reached the Bahi*?2a \de \los Caballos, where Narva*?2ez had built his
F25 171 brigantines and the cavalry had sacrificed their mounts. ^\De Soto's
F25 172 men scanned the trunks of the trees for any messages which their
F25 173 predecessors might have left, but nothing was found. ^Further down the
F25 174 shores of the lagoon, a search party came upon some disused canoes in
F25 175 which they put out to take soundings. ^The water was just deep enough,
F25 176 it seemed to them, to take larger vessels. ^With this report they
F25 177 returned to the General who decided that the time was now ripe to
F25 178 order the evacuation of the garrison which he had left behind at Tampa
F25 179 Bay where his expedition had first landed.
F25 180    |^The difficult task of returning overland to Tampa Bay, through
F25 181 regions where the Indians would be quick to take up arms against their
F25 182 old enemies, was entrusted to the Comptroller, Juan \de An*?4asco, and
F25 183 a picked band of horsemen.

F26   2 *<*4The Sea-Country of Mehalah*>
F26   3 *<by \0*6J. WENTWORTH DAY*>
F26   4    |^*'*2MEHALAH BAKER! ^*0I \2know'd she well, poor \2gal. ^We went
F26   5 to dame's school together*- three halfpence a week to learn reading,
F26   6 writing and 'rithmetic. ^She lived across the creek on Ray Island,
F26   7 with her old mother, who was forever drunk on gin. ^You could get a
F26   8 masterful lot of gin then for \2tuppence. ^Poor Mehalah*- she had a
F26   9 sad life \2on't. ^\2'Course, the \2Raverand over at East wrote a book
F26  10 about her. ^That was all the go that time o' day. ^Everybody was
F26  11 \2a-readin' o' it. ^The \2Raverand was a tall, thin man. ^Used to walk
F26  12 about the marsh roads, singin' in the wind. ^He was a rare \2scholard,
F26  13 a right \2larned man.**'
F26  14    |^Thus spoke my revered, and now, alas, dead, friend, \0Mrs Jane
F26  15 Pullen, landlady of that very old, sun-warmed inn, the Peldon Rose,
F26  16 which crouches in its willows on the Essex shore, cocking a wary eye
F26  17 across the water at the independent isle of Mersea.
F26  18    |^For fifty years she was landlady of this ancient inn, which the
F26  19 Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould, that master of Victorian melodrama,
F26  20 immortalized in *1Mehalah, A Story of the Salt Marshes, *0first
F26  21 published in 1880. ^Today it is a collector's piece. ^It sent shudders
F26  22 down the delicate spines of our grandmothers.
F26  23    |^\0Mrs Pullen was over eighty when she died, thirty years ago.
F26  24 ^That helps to date Mehalah Baker, the pathetic girl of the Essex
F26  25 marshes who lived in a small farmhouse built of wreckage timber and
F26  26 roofed with red pantiles, on Ray Island. ^You may still trace the
F26  27 foundations among wind-twisted thorn trees on that lonely little isle
F26  28 of saltings and coarse grass, between the shifting tides of the twin
F26  29 creeks, Ray Channel and Strood Channel, which cut off the bold, bright
F26  30 men of Mersea from the duller chaps over in England.
F26  31    |^Baring-Gould's story of Mehalah is high-pitched, grim,
F26  32 melodramatic, removed to the end of the 18th century for romantic
F26  33 effect. ^Redeemed by exquisite word-pictures of the marshes and
F26  34 true-life portraits of marshland characters, it has been reprinted
F26  35 eighteen times.
F26  36    |^Briefly, the Mehalah Sharland of the melodrama is wooed by Elijah
F26  37 Rebow, a marsh farmer, brutal, cunning, ferocious. ^He owns the Ray
F26  38 and lives in Red Hall. ^Mehalah, vivid, raven-haired and gipsy-fierce,
F26  39 hates him. ^Her heart is set on George De Witt, a young fisherman.
F26  40 ^Rebow, in revenge, supplies her mother with secret kegs of smuggled
F26  41 rum, steals their sheep, betrays De Witt to the press gang, and
F26  42 finally sets fire to the Ray farmhouse and takes the now penniless
F26  43 girl and her almost senile mother to live at Red Hall. ^In despair she
F26  44 marries him, swearing never to consummate the marriage.
F26  45    |^On her wedding night, Mehalah hits Rebow with a bottle. ^It
F26  46 contains vitriol and blinds him. ^Stunned by remorse, she swears to
F26  47 look after him for the rest of her life. ^Her old admirer, George De
F26  48 Witt, returns from the navy; but it is too late. ^He announces that he
F26  49 will marry her rival, Phoebe Musset, and Mehalah realizes that Rebow
F26  50 alone is constant. ^Later, in a passion the blind man knocks her
F26  51 senseless, lifts her into his boat, rows out to sea and pulls out the
F26  52 boat's plug. ^The pair, their marriage unconsummated, drown together.
F26  53    |^Despite this barn-storming quality, the book grips you. ^Those
F26  54 who remember, as I do, the fanatical, biblical frenzy of marshland
F26  55 religious beliefs and family feuds, glimpse flashes of truth. ^There
F26  56 are still De Witts, Mussets, Petticans, Pudneys and others in the
F26  57 marsh villages. ^And Rebow is a remembered name. ^The melodrama,
F26  58 however, as told by Baring-Gould is, I believe, pure fantasy, apart
F26  59 from the use of local place-names and surnames.
F26  60    |^Except for the seaward side of Mersea Island which is ruined by a
F26  61 sprawl of suburban bungalows, utterly alien to the island tradition of
F26  62 building, this fascinating half-land of sea-creeks and salt marshes is
F26  63 much as Mehalah knew it. ^Salt tides still gurgle in crab-holes. ^The
F26  64 ebb bares the shining mud-flats. ^Lonely creeks are opal in the dawn,
F26  65 sword-blue in the sun, greyly silver under misty moons. ^Curlew
F26  66 whistle haunting music. ^Redshank ring their million bells in the
F26  67 courting days of spring. ^At night, bar-geese laugh their ghastly
F26  68 laughter far out on the crawling tide*- the ghosts, they say, of
F26  69 drowned sailors, down in the green alleys of Fiddlers' Green, mocking
F26  70 the living about to join them.
F26  71    |^In winter the brent geese come south over bitter seas from
F26  72 Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya to winter on Dengie Flats, where the
F26  73 sea-wall, houseless, manless, goes marching down the coast for a dozen
F26  74 lonely miles. ^The tides ebb out for a mile or more. ^If you are lost
F26  75 in a duck-punt in a winter fog, as I have been, sea and land melt into
F26  76 grey, terrifying nothingness. ^You can only tell the direction of the
F26  77 land when the tide has ebbed by the lie of seaweed and eel-grass on
F26  78 the mud.
F26  79    |^A country of high skies and incredibly clear lights, of drifting
F26  80 sea-fogs and sharp tides. ^An old, old land of beauty and mystery
F26  81 haunted by Roman and Dane, East Saxon and Norman, and by all that
F26  82 rough crew of smugglers and wreckers, wildfowlers and fishermen,
F26  83 poachers and marsh-men whose immemorial kingdom it is.
F26  84    |^Landward, miles of rough grass marshes, cattle-dotted, seamed by
F26  85 reedy *'fleets**' where wild duck nest and reed-warblers chitter in
F26  86 the reeds, melt into low uplands, bright with corn. ^Great farmhouses,
F26  87 built when the Armada was a boding threat, stand within moats starred
F26  88 by water-lilies, sentinelled by cloudy elms. ^They and their villages
F26  89 bear names that echo Saxon and Roman, Dane and Norman. ^Most of them
F26  90 lie at the head of lonely creeks. ^In the old days sprit-sailed barges
F26  91 glided, red-sailed, above the land to village hithes with cattle and
F26  92 corn, coals and wood, or stacked high with hay. ^The old green *'barge
F26  93 roads**', raised causeways of grass, still run from many a farmyard to
F26  94 forgotten havens where weed-grown posts stand memorial to the rough
F26  95 seaman who tied up there.
F26  96    |^There is such an old green road from the off-buildings at Decoy
F26  97 Farm on Bohun's Hall at Tollesbury to Thurslet Creek, which maps show
F26  98 as Thistly Creek, a name not used locally. ^Across the fields lie
F26  99 Tolleshunt D'Arcy Hall and Bourchier's Hall; the first within a
F26 100 perfect moat, the second with fragments of a homestead moat. ^Within a
F26 101 gunshot of Bourchier's Hall stand the mournful remains of Guisnes
F26 102 Court, built from the old stones of London Bridge.
F26 103    |^Those four house names preserve manorial memories. ^It was Baron
F26 104 Bohun who, with Bigod, threw the threats of Edward *=1 in his face
F26 105 with the words: ^*'By God, Sir King, we will neither go nor hang.**'
F26 106 ^Tolleshunt D'Arcy derives from the D'Arcys who held half this wild
F26 107 marsh country in feudal fee. ^Baldwin, Earl of Guisnes, held a
F26 108 knight's fee of the Honour of Boulogne in Tollesbury in the reign of
F26 109 King John, which passed later to Robert Bourchier, Lord Chancellor of
F26 110 England and Earl of Essex. ^Robert, Lord Bourchier, kept his first
F26 111 court at Bourchier's Hall in 1329.
F26 112    |^For the rest of these echoes of history, there lie, scattered
F26 113 under wide marsh skies, manors and villages which sing on the tongue*-
F26 114 Salcott-cum-Virley, Bradwell-juxta-Mare, Tolleshunt Knights, Layer
F26 115 Breton, Layer-\de-\la-Haye: all are Norman. ^Fingringhoe, Langenhoe and
F26 116 Wivenhoe smell of the Viking. ^The gaunt grey priory of \0St. Osyth,
F26 117 across the Colne to the east of Brightlingsea, is dedicated to a
F26 118 forgotten Saxon saint.
F26 119    |^All this coast is vivid with history. ^A mile east of Bradwell,
F26 120 at the end of the straight Roman road which leads through wheat and
F26 121 barley to the sea, you will find remnants of the twelve-foot-thick
F26 122 walls of the old Roman fort of Othona, built to guard the mouth of the
F26 123 Blackwater in the reign of Diocletian or Constantine *=1. ^It was
F26 124 garrisoned by the Count of the Saxon Shore.
F26 125    |^There, in {0A.D.} 653, Cedd, Bishop of the East Saxons, built
F26 126 from the Roman ruins \0St. Peter's Chapel, the little cathedral which
F26 127 stands, earth-floored, wind-beaten, on a slight rise at the end of the
F26 128 sea-wall. ^It is fifty-five feet long and twenty-six feet wide, barely
F26 129 large enough to hold a couple of dozen worshippers. ^Hundreds of
F26 130 pilgrims visit it each year and camp in army huts on the near-by
F26 131 marsh. ^Elizabethan seamen used it as a beacon tower whose flames
F26 132 flickered at night far over the treacherous sea-flats. ^Georgian
F26 133 smugglers stored their barrels in it. ^In the First World War, troops
F26 134 used it as a look-out. ^Today, it is reconsecrated, a place of God.
F26 135    |^The only dead man to lie in state, during the last century or
F26 136 more, within those lonely walls on the edge of the crawling sea was my
F26 137 gallant old friend Walter Linnett, *'the last of the Essex fowlers**',
F26 138 who died only a year or two ago. ^He lived his long life in the
F26 139 one-storeyed, three-roomed wooden coastguard cottage which crouches,
F26 140 bowered in vines, on the seaward side of the sea-wall at the foot of
F26 141 the old Roman fort. ^There he reared his family of six and fed them
F26 142 with the spoils of punt-gun and peter-net, eel-spear and rabbit-snare.
F26 143 ^His great punt-gun, ten feet long, two-and-a-half inches in bore,
F26 144 three hundred pounds in weight, capable of firing two pounds of swan
F26 145 shot, now stands in my hall. ^They say it has killed fifty thousand
F26 146 wild geese and wild duck in the last hundred years.
F26 147    |^The wild geese are protected now; and in winter the marshes and
F26 148 bitter mud-flats of Mehalah's country are haunted at dawn and dusk by
F26 149 long wavering skeins of the great birds like windblown witches.
F26 150    |^The Romans built not only the fort of Othona: they had a pharos,
F26 151 or lighthouse, on Mersea. ^They laid the foundations of the Strood,
F26 152 the causeway which connects the island with the mainland. ^They went
F26 153 to Mersea for oysters. ^They sent their sick there to recover. ^They
F26 154 built a temple to Vesta on the site of West Mersea church. ^When I had
F26 155 the shooting on Fingringhoe Wick at the mouth of the River Colne, a
F26 156 lonely peninsula of sandy gravel and saltings, we found the complete
F26 157 foundations of a Roman villa with a mass of oyster shells.
F26 158    |^Salcott-cum-Virley is still a village; across the creek is the
F26 159 ghost of the vanished village of Virley. ^The Sun Inn, immortalized in
F26 160 *1Mehalah, *0stands in the village street, as yet, thank God,
F26 161 unmodernized. ^But Virley Church, where Mehalah was married to the
F26 162 brutal Elijah Rebow by the Reverend \0Mr Rabbit, is a ruin, whilst the
F26 163 near-by White Hart Inn, once a den of smugglers, was blotted out by a
F26 164 bomb in the last war.
F26 165    |^The picture of that tragic wedding, as re-told by Herbert
F26 166 Tompkins in his *1Marsh Country Rambles, *0is a pathetic commentary on
F26 167 the rough marsh-life of the day. ^The *"nots**" in the Decalogue had
F26 168 been erased by a village humourist; a wormeaten deal table did duty
F26 169 for an altar; the curate's red cotton handkerchief was the only
F26 170 altar-cloth. ^The floor of the chancel was eaten through by rats; the
F26 171 bones beneath were exposed to view. ^The congregation consisted
F26 172 chiefly of a few young folk, who snored sonorously, or cracked nuts,
F26 173 or adorned the pews with rude sketches of ships. ^On the wedding-day a
F26 174 motley crowd assembled to see the fun, and the tiny church was
F26 175 crowded. ^In the west gallery boys dropped broken tobacco-pipes on the
F26 176 heads of the persons below; a sweep, unwashed, pushed forward and took
F26 177 a seat beside the altar; the Communion-rails were broken down and the
F26 178 chancel filled with a noisy squabbling mob. ^Pen and ink were, with
F26 179 difficulty, found; while the sight-seers exchanged uncomplimentary
F26 180 sentences aloud in the presence of the Reverend \0Mr Rabbit. ^The
F26 181 bridegroom was arrayed in a *"blue coat with brass buttons and
F26 182 knee-breeches**"; old \0Mrs De Witt, a queer character, had thrown a
F26 183 smart red coat over her silk dress; on her head was a *"broad white
F26 184 chip hat**", tied with ribbons of sky blue; in her frizzled hair was a
F26 185 bunch of forget-me-nots.
F26 186 *# 2004
F27   1 **[170 TEXT F27**]
F27   2 ^*0The persons who suffered in the revolt of that year were for the
F27   3 most part either churchmen (and the ballads, as the peasants, do
F27   4 reveal an animus against the richer cleric), or individuals personally
F27   5 associated with misgovernment or the abuse of office (the sheriff of
F27   6 Nottingham's chief crime was clearly abuse of his official position).
F27   7 ^The men who were attacked in 1381 were persons such as Sudbury and
F27   8 Hales and Legge, whose names were linked with the imposition of the
F27   9 Poll Tax; John of Gaunt, who was suspected of designs on the throne,
F27  10 and his affinity: and the lawyers, from justices like Bealknap and
F27  11 Cavendish down to the apprentices of the Temple*- the men, that is,
F27  12 who would have been individually responsible for resisting the
F27  13 peasants' claims at law, when they attempted to establish their free
F27  14 status by exemplifications out of Domesday, or were charged with
F27  15 breaking the Statute of Labourers. ^In other words the brunt of the
F27  16 attack in 1381 fell on those who were, either professionally or
F27  17 personally, directly associated with political mismanagement or legal
F27  18 oppression. ^It was the same at the time of Cade's Revolt, when lesser
F27  19 gentry fought side by side with the peasant: their attack was on the
F27  20 politicians and the corrupt Lancastrian officials, James Fiennes and
F27  21 his affinity, and the sheriffs and under-sheriffs of counties.
F27  22 ^Rumours of plans for the wholesale slaughter of the aristocracy in
F27  23 1381, and of the clergy in 1450, were clearly exaggerated. ^Men of the
F27  24 period, both humble and gentle, accepted a stratified society: what
F27  25 they resented was the abuse of official or social position, and this
F27  26 is precisely the attitude which the ballads echo, with their detailed
F27  27 catalogue of the crimes of men like the sheriff of Nottingham and the
F27  28 Abbot of \0St. Mary's. ^One should not expect popular literature to
F27  29 concentrate its attack on the manorial system or the inconvenience of
F27  30 villein status, because the peasants themselves did not see their
F27  31 grievances in economic or systematic terms: they saw them rather in
F27  32 terms of the personal viciousness of individual lords. ^The men they
F27  33 were after were Hobbe the Robber and the lawyers who had set
F27  34 *"{1Trewthe under a lokke}**" and would not unfasten it for any
F27  35 *"{1but he sing dedero}**".
F27  36    |^There are however other reasons, \0Mr. Holt declares, why the
F27  37 ballads should not appeal to a peasant audience. ^For instance, the
F27  38 crucial events centre round the county courts, where the sheriff and
F27  39 the knights were the dominant figures; and there is no mention in them
F27  40 of the justices of the peace, with whom the humble criminal would
F27  41 surely have had more to do. ^The reason for this seems, however, to be
F27  42 elementary: the justices of the peace could not declare outlawry,
F27  43 which had to be proclaimed by the sheriff in the county court. ^That
F27  44 peasants would be unconcerned about this would hardly seem a tenable
F27  45 view in the light of Wat Tyler's demand at Smithfield in 1381 *"that
F27  46 sentence of outlawry be not pronounced henceforth in any process at
F27  47 law**". ^Again, \0Mr. Holt asserts that the methods and manner of
F27  48 poaching in the ballads are aristocratic, and its object sport, not
F27  49 food. ^What then of the outlaws' claim in the *1{1Gest of Robyn
F27  50 Hode}:
F27  51 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F27  52    |^*0{1We lyve by our kynge"s dere,
F27  53    |Other shyft have not wee.}
F27  54 **[END QUOTE**]
F27  55    |^Here surely food is the implied object of poaching. ^That the
F27  56 ballads make no mention of the trapping of rabbits and other lesser
F27  57 game is hardly germane, for the ballads are certainly intended to be
F27  58 heroic and this is not a heroic topic. ^Peasant poaching was by no
F27  59 means confined to humble quarry: another of Wat Tyler's demands in
F27  60 1381 was that all warrens, parks and chases should be free, *"so that
F27  61 throughout the realm, in ... the woods and forests, poor as well as
F27  62 rich might take wild beasts and hunt the hare in the field**".
F27  63 ^Moreover the manner of poaching in the ballads surely stamps it as
F27  64 humble. ^The rich man hunted with dogs, as the example of Abbot Clowne
F27  65 of Leicester, whose success in breeding hounds earned him the respect
F27  66 of the highest in the realm, reminds us. ^The outlaws shot their deer
F27  67 with the bow, which was not the weapon of the aristocrat. ^The great
F27  68 schools of English archery were the village butts, and it was from
F27  69 among the men who had learned their skill there that Edward *=3
F27  70 recruited his longbowmen. ^The military importance of the archer led
F27  71 Edward to make archery contests compulsory on feast days, but it never
F27  72 earned the archer social status. ^The poachers of Sherwood, whose
F27  73 skill proved so useful at Halidon Hill in 1333, were not sporting
F27  74 gentry, but men arrayed from among those humble people whom the
F27  75 Statute of Winchester had commanded to keep *"bows and arrows out of
F27  76 the forest, and in the forest bows and bolts**". ^Edward *=1 had
F27  77 clearly realised to what use men who had less than twenty marks in
F27  78 goods and who lived in the forest would put their arrows, and
F27  79 protected his venison accordingly.
F27  80    |^The arguments which are said to preclude the ballads from
F27  81 appealing primarily to a peasant audience seem therefore to be weak
F27  82 ones. ^What then of the positive arguments for their being composed
F27  83 for gentle ears? ^\0Mr. Holt says that the knightly class is
F27  84 consistently treated with favour in them. ^It is true that in the
F27  85 *1\1Gest *0Sir Richard \1atte Lee is on the side of light and that
F27  86 Gamelyn was a knight's son. ^What, however, are we to make of the
F27  87 county knights in the *1Tale of Gamelyn, *0who were ready to a man to
F27  88 conspire with Gamelyn's villainous elder brother to cheat the boy of
F27  89 his inheritance? ^What are we to say of Alan \1a'Dale, who but for
F27  90 Robin Hood would have died broken-hearted because his love was chosen
F27  91 *"to be an old knight's delight?**" ^And from what class were the
F27  92 sheriffs and justices of the ballads chosen, if not from among the
F27  93 knights? ^The fact is that the knights as a class are not treated
F27  94 consistently in the ballads, which in my submission is what we should
F27  95 expect. ^The commons had no animus against social rank as such: what
F27  96 they resented was the lordship of unjust men and their corrupt
F27  97 practices. ^Their political horizons were limited and local: their
F27  98 grievances were specific. ^Their appeal in 1381 was to specified
F27  99 rights of ancient standing, to charters of Cnut and Offa and to
F27 100 Domesday Book: in 1450 they drew up their complaints in a list,
F27 101 setting them out one by one. ^And on both occasions they limited their
F27 102 governmental demands to the removal of evil councillors and officials.
F27 103 ^So in the outlaw stories the final resolution is the substitution of
F27 104 just men for corrupt officials: the way to set the world to rights is
F27 105 not to reform the system, but to kill the Sheriff of Nottingham and to
F27 106 make Gamelyn Chief Justice of the Forest. ^Hero and villain are
F27 107 differentiated in the manner which a medieval audience would have
F27 108 understood, by distinction of personal character rather than social
F27 109 class. ^The knights are not all good or all bad: Gamelyn, the Outlaw
F27 110 King, is the hero, and his brother, the sheriff, is the villain, but
F27 111 both are born of the same father and are of the same social standing.
F27 112    |^Neither the attitude expressed in the ballads towards persons of
F27 113 high social status nor their attitude towards social problems seem
F27 114 necessarily to associate them with the views of the knightly class.
F27 115 \0Mr. Holt claims that their appeal to this section of the community
F27 116 is also revealed by the background of the stories, which he describes
F27 117 as that of *"maintenance and misgovernment at their worst, of baronial
F27 118 and border warfare**", subjects of primary interest to the gentry and
F27 119 to the northern gentry at that. ^I have failed to find a single
F27 120 reference to border warfare in any of the genuinely early Robin Hood
F27 121 ballads. ^This is the more surprising, since certain incidents
F27 122 recounted of Robin Hood in the ballads are also told of border heroes.
F27 123 ^The Outlaw Murray of Ettrick Forest warred on the *"\1Southrons**" at
F27 124 the head of a band clad in Lincoln green, and William Wallace,
F27 125 according to Blind Harry, adopted the classical outlaw's disguise of a
F27 126 potter to spy on his enemies. ^This disguise was used by Eustace the
F27 127 Monk, the central figure of a thirteenth-century romance, and by Robin
F27 128 Hood. ^Incidents in another French romance of the same period, that of
F27 129 Fulk Fitzwarin, also resemble stories told of Robin Hood, as do some
F27 130 of the incidents in the story of Hereward the Wake. ^Since a great
F27 131 deal of the matter common to these stories (for instance the
F27 132 chivalrous episodes, the fights with giants and dragons, and the
F27 133 scenes of courtly love) are clearly intended for an aristocratic
F27 134 audience, \0Mr. Holt argues that the Robin Hood ballads were meant for
F27 135 the same ears. ^What seems to me significant, however, is that while
F27 136 the romances share these common themes with the story of William
F27 137 Wallace, which concerns knightly struggles in Scotland and on the
F27 138 Border, courtly and chivalrous material are entirely lacking from the
F27 139 story of Robin Hood. ^In other words, it looks as if the matter common
F27 140 to these knightly tales and to the outlaw ballads is not in the latter
F27 141 case derivative, but is the result of borrowing from the same source.
F27 142 ^Moreover, the omission from the ballads of chivalrous material and of
F27 143 references, for instance, to the border wars, surely suggests that
F27 144 they were aimed not at the same audience as the longer romances, but
F27 145 at a different one which was less interested in these subjects.
F27 146    |^That this was the case is confirmed both by the testimony of the
F27 147 earliest references to Robin Hood in the chronicles, and by the
F27 148 consistently favourable attitude of the outlaws of story towards the
F27 149 poorer classes. ^The outlaws were not always poor men, but the poor
F27 150 man did not demand that. ^He demanded kindness, good lordship to
F27 151 engage his fidelity, and this is what the outlaw gave. ^It is the
F27 152 theme of Robin Hood's famous advice:
F27 153 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F27 154    |^{1But loke ye do no husbonde harm,
F27 155    |That tilleth with his ploughe.}
F27 156 **[END QUOTE**]
F27 157    |^It is the theme, too, of his final epitaph in the *1\1Gest:
F27 158 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F27 159    |^{1*0For he was a good outlawe,
F27 160    |And dyde pore men moch god.}
F27 161 **[END QUOTE**]
F27 162    |^How the outlaw was rewarded is told in the *1Tale of Gamelyn:
F27 163 *0the knights of the county might conspire to cheat him, but his
F27 164 villeins were faithful even in the hour of extreme misfortune:
F27 165 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F27 166    |^{1Tho were his bonde-men sory and nothing glad
F27 167    |When Gamelyn her lord wolves heed was cryed and maad.}
F27 168 **[END QUOTE**]
F27 169    |^It was to protect them against the oppressions of their new
F27 170 master that Gamelyn came to the Moot Hall, where he was arrested and
F27 171 bound by the sheriff. ^Whether he is like Gamelyn a knight or like
F27 172 Robin Hood a yeoman, the outlaw hero of the fourteenth- and
F27 173 fifteenth-century stories is the friend of the poor: he is not
F27 174 consistently the friend of the knight.
F27 175    |^The word *"poor**", as I have used it here, does require a gloss.
F27 176 ^The poor men of the outlaw ballads are not, certainly,
F27 177 thirteenth-century villeins, bound down by ancestral thraldom and
F27 178 working three days a week on their lord's land. ^They are mostly
F27 179 yeomen, bound to one another by the ties of *"good yeomanry**", proud,
F27 180 independent and free. ^Because this independence of spirit is a
F27 181 striking feature of the outlaw ballads, \0Mr. Holt has drawn a sharp
F27 182 distinction between the yeoman and the peasant. ^He defines the word
F27 183 yeoman as meaning a special kind of household servant, in rank only a
F27 184 little inferior to the squire and quite possibly of gentle breeding.
F27 185 ^I doubt very much whether the word can be limited to this meaning in
F27 186 fourteenth- or fifteenth-century usage, and this is after all the
F27 187 period in which the ballads as we know them were composed. ^I do not
F27 188 see how such a meaning can be squared with the reference to *"{genz
F27 189 de mestre et d'artifice appellez yomen}**" in the Parliament Roll of
F27 190 1363, or with Barbour's description of yeomen who fight *"{1apon
F27 191 fut}**"*- a most unknightly situation.

F28   2 ^*0After a long struggle Wratislaw won his case with costs, and Arnold
F28   3 had to accept the remaining Wratislaw and Gibb children even though
F28   4 they knew no Latin. ^However, no general attempt was made to restore
F28   5 the lost forms, and the local children who happened to attend in spite
F28   6 of the headmaster's displeasure had to be coached specially.
F28   7    |^The Wratislaw case of 1839 was the last of the individual
F28   8 protests. ^His social position was exceptional. ^As an acknowledged
F28   9 member of a foreign nobility he was the social superior of everyone
F28  10 locally in spite of his professional occupation. ^Without the English
F28  11 tradition behind him he was able to question national and local
F28  12 opinions on a rational basis, and this independence of mind made him
F28  13 and his family Radicals in a predominantly Tory neighbourhood. ^The
F28  14 probe into his own rights was no doubt as much a reflection of his own
F28  15 position as a member of the first generation on foreign soil as a
F28  16 consequence of his experience as a solicitor and his ability to assess
F28  17 the legal position at first hand.
F28  18    |^After Wratislaw came the revolt of the traders. ^A few middle
F28  19 class sons were always to be found at Rugby School, but the numbers
F28  20 from Rugby itself were few. ^On the other hand acceptance of the sons
F28  21 of gentry and local professional men*- doctors, bankers and
F28  22 solicitors*- was a traditional practice, and, more important still,
F28  23 the sons of such parents were accepted or at least grudgingly
F28  24 tolerated by the boys. ^In the 1830s and 1840s these *"accepted**"
F28  25 groups sent numbers varying from five to seventeen in each year, while
F28  26 the total number of traders' sons was only eleven for the same entire
F28  27 period of twenty years in spite of the large number of such children
F28  28 available. ^The trader's son had a very tough time. ^At the least he
F28  29 was ostracised and at the worst severely bullied, particularly in the
F28  30 lower forms. ^There is overwhelming evidence of this both from outside
F28  31 and inside the school, and enough of it was known locally to prevent
F28  32 the middle classes generally from risking their children. ^On the
F28  33 other hand there was no provision for middle class education in the
F28  34 town before 1840 apart from a special group at the lower class school,
F28  35 and the main mass went elsewhere*- a few walked to Barnwell and
F28  36 Sheasby's School at Bilton, while others went as boarders to
F28  37 neighbouring towns, Daventry, Hinckley, Husbands Bosworth, Atherstone.
F28  38 ^This was expensive and even later, when a middle class day academy
F28  39 was set up, the cost varied from *+6 to *+10 {0p.a.} depending on the
F28  40 number of extras. ^Over Rugby School the traders were in a dilemma for
F28  41 they were dependent on it for trade while the headmasters actively
F28  42 discouraged use of the school. ^The declaration of a shop out of
F28  43 bounds could bring ruin and there was no lack of precedence for this.
F28  44 ^The traders were torn in two directions. ^Economy and their rights as
F28  45 townfolk and parents urged them to use the school, while economic
F28  46 survival forbade it. ^Very few braved the consequences and sent sons,
F28  47 although in one or two cases like the Sale and Edmunds families there
F28  48 was a long tradition of usage. ^While the school prospered the traders
F28  49 had the satisfaction of sharing in the prosperity even if denied their
F28  50 birthright, yet, when adversity came under the headmastership of
F28  51 Goulburn from 1850 to 1857 they lost both ways:
F28  52 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F28  53    |... the reason why the inhabitants do not avail themselves of the
F28  54 privilege (of educating their sons at Rugby School) is their general
F28  55 apathy, supineness and dread of losing the patronage of the masters,
F28  56 who derive their income from the Charity.
F28  57 **[END QUOTE**]
F28  58    |^Even so four traders took courage and submitted sons (1855), but
F28  59 the next year the number was down to one, and reduced again the next
F28  60 year. ^However, with a new headmaster, the situation changed
F28  61 dramatically. ^Within months the prosperity of the town was restored
F28  62 and for two successive years they sent sons to the school in
F28  63 increasing numbers*- five traders being involved in 1858 and twelve in
F28  64 1859. ^But that was the end. ^Middle class initiative declined rapidly
F28  65 never to be renewed, and this was in effect, the last defiance of
F28  66 tradition by the local traders. ^The explanation of this episode is
F28  67 linked with the background of the new headmaster, Frederick Temple.
F28  68 ^He was knowledgable **[SIC**] in the social sense by his association
F28  69 with the lower classes generally and the workhouse in particular
F28  70 through his Principalship at Kneller Hall, a college designed to
F28  71 produce teachers of children in the workhouses of the country. ^It was
F28  72 reasonable to suppose that such a man's sympathies would be wide and
F28  73 not geared specifically to the upper classes. ^This view was
F28  74 strengthened by the fact that he had written only two years before a
F28  75 paper on National Education, through which he had become one of the
F28  76 champions of middle class education. ^His scheme had involved a
F28  77 reassessment of the 704 grammar schools. ^While he felt that the great
F28  78 Public Schools were justified in clinging on to the classics,
F28  79 elsewhere it was a mistake. ^To the traders of Rugby his words must
F28  80 have sounded almost prophetic:
F28  81 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F28  82    |^They [grammar schools] were intended for the education of the
F28  83 whole community, but specially for that of the middle classes ... yet
F28  84 the schools were assuredly not intended for the gentry alone, but
F28  85 rather looked to poverty as a special qualification for admission.
F28  86 ^The middle classes were thus marked out as the chief objects of the
F28  87 goodwill of the founders.
F28  88 **[END QUOTE**]
F28  89    |^Or again
F28  90 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F28  91    |^These schools [grammar schools] were meant for the middle
F28  92 classes: they were meant to teach Greek and Latin. ^One must be
F28  93 sacrificed*- either the persons or the things. ^Can there be a doubt
F28  94 which ought to be sacrificed?
F28  95 **[END QUOTE**]
F28  96    |^The whole trend of his writing emphasised the fact that his own
F28  97 school, Rugby, was not fulfilling its real object. ^Temple was
F28  98 embarrassed and could hardly object to the children of locals with the
F28  99 vigour of his predecessors. ^No wonder that traders' children poured
F28 100 in during 1858 and 1859. ^But the experiment was not successful. ^It
F28 101 was soon clear that Temple did not really welcome his new clients any
F28 102 more than the others had done. ^Any idea of mixing the social classes
F28 103 appalled him. ^In a similar situation he was later to warn the middle
F28 104 classes of Rugby most forcibly that they would ruin any middle class
F28 105 school of their own if they allowed entry to lower class children.
F28 106 ^Even so headmaster and school had a conscience, and we know that at
F28 107 one time the assistant masters formed a committee of their own to
F28 108 consider what could be done educationally for the town.
F28 109    |^So the second phase of local resistance faded. ^The arguments
F28 110 continued and at least one pamphlet was published, but as far as
F28 111 records indicate the locality was relatively quiet up to and during
F28 112 the national clamour that led to the setting up of the Public Schools
F28 113 Commission. ^Eventually, in 1864, when this Commission published its
F28 114 findings it advised that any wishes of the Founder should be ignored
F28 115 since the modern town bore no resemblance to the Elizabethan
F28 116 counterpart and since Rugby School was in fact a long standing
F28 117 specialised boarding school and could not be altered. ^Their
F28 118 recommendation was obvious:
F28 119 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F28 120    |^That the local qualification should, in course of time, cease to
F28 121 confer any advantage.
F28 122 **[END QUOTE**]
F28 123    |^In one way the argument was sound enough. ^When Lawrence Sheriff,
F28 124 the founder, made his will in 1567, Rugby was a mere village of 350
F28 125 people; by 1800 it was a town of almost 1,500. ^Had he been able to
F28 126 penetrate two and a half centuries of time he would have recognised
F28 127 nothing, for not only had the town grown but it had changed, and the
F28 128 only link with the past was the name of one tavern*- *"The Hen and
F28 129 Chickens**". ^He would have found the people equally strange, not only
F28 130 in name but in habits, dress and manners. ^Only if he had moved right
F28 131 away from the people and their town would he have seen something
F28 132 familiar in the lie of the land, the flow of the Avon, and his own
F28 133 tiny hamlet of Brownsover. ^The town of 1800, however, bore no
F28 134 relation whatever to the Rugby of Lawrence Sheriff. ^But this was not
F28 135 the whole story and it is a big step from showing the weakness of an
F28 136 argument to assume that all claim is void and that a decision must be
F28 137 made in favour of the existing situation where indeed the argument was
F28 138 considerably weaker still.
F28 139    |^Within the town itself the Report produced a sensation. ^There
F28 140 was real cause for complaint since the Commissioners had not asked for
F28 141 the opinions of any of the townsfolk proper. ^From this point of view
F28 142 the Report was very one-sided. ^The Commissioners had produced a very
F28 143 bulky document in four volumes but they were hardly neutral observers.
F28 144 ^Of the seven members, four were in titled aristocratic families, four
F28 145 were at Eton or had close relatives there, one went to Westminster and
F28 146 was a governor of Charterhouse, while another was an Old Rugbeian. ^As
F28 147 for the man who cannot thus be classified, he was {0W. H.} Thompson,
F28 148 Regius Professor of Greek and future Master of Trinity, already deeply
F28 149 concerned about the effects of reform on his own college at Cambridge.
F28 150    |^The Report produced a third and co-operative phase in the town's
F28 151 fight for its rights. ^Previously objection had come either from a
F28 152 single member of the community (Wratislaw) or from the trader group of
F28 153 the middle classes spurred on by such men as \0E. Edmunds, {0T. W.}
F28 154 Tipler and \0J. Haswell. ^Hitherto the local gentry and professional
F28 155 classes had held aloof for the school had accepted their sons readily
F28 156 enough. ^But now the ban was to apply to everyone, gentry as much as
F28 157 trader, while the town would no longer attract rich residents merely
F28 158 for the sake of the education. ^In the matter of justice and in terms
F28 159 of economics the town was threatened with starvation.
F28 160    |^Among the first to react was the headmaster, Temple, himself. ^He
F28 161 suggested that *+600 {0p.a.} of the income from the charity be spent
F28 162 in providing a separate school for the middle classes of the town.
F28 163 ^Fifty local boys would be taught there free and seven boys a year
F28 164 would pass from this school into Rugby School proper. ^This *"lower**"
F28 165 school was to concentrate on a sound commercial education of English,
F28 166 writing, mathematics, French, Latin, but no Greek. ^Unfortunately
F28 167 Temple had chosen the wrong moment and everyone condemned the scheme
F28 168 since the offered *+600 did not begin to compare with the Sheriff
F28 169 income of *+5,000, while a cash settlement of the kind suggested
F28 170 appeared to some almost in the nature of a bribe for the surrender of
F28 171 the town's rights.
F28 172    |^The Report of the Public Schools Commission was followed by the
F28 173 Public Schools Bill. ^Under this free education at Rugby was to cease
F28 174 although the Governing Body was to use part of the income for the
F28 175 benefit of the town, perhaps in the form of a new school.
F28 176    |^This official proposal met with even more resistance than
F28 177 Temple's original plan. ^All classes except the lower joined together.
F28 178 ^A public meeting was called for 22nd March 1865 and a committee
F28 179 formed of the Rector, the brother of the Lord of the Manor, other
F28 180 gentry, a banker, professional men and traders, with solicitors acting
F28 181 as secretaries and a backing of *+652 to cover expenses. ^The campaign
F28 182 was off to a fine start but when a petition of protest was opened for
F28 183 the public to sign, only 200 in fact did so. ^In a population of 8,000
F28 184 this is a very small number and represents less than a third of the
F28 185 gentry and middle class adults alone. ^The vast majority of the gentry
F28 186 and most of the trading classes held aloof. ^The lower classes were,
F28 187 as always, mere spectators. ^This small response was not entirely due
F28 188 to apathy for many of the traders were frightened of Temple's
F28 189 displeasure, and the gentry who had come to the town specially for the
F28 190 education had the welfare of their sons at the school as their prime
F28 191 and indeed only consideration.

F29   8    |^*2SO RUNS AN OLD RHYME WHICH CAME SADLY *0true when, in 1897,
F29   9 there died Miss Alice Boyd, 15th Laird of Penkill and the last of the
F29  10 Boyds.
F29  11    |^Her brother, Spencer Boyd, 14th Laird, last in the direct line,
F29  12 and descendant of James Boyd, second son of John Boyd of Penkill and
F29  13 Trochrig, had died in 1867. ^He left Penkill to his sister, with
F29  14 instructions that, when she died, it was to go to the children of his
F29  15 mother's second marriage to \0Mr. Henry Courtney. ^Thus, in 1897, a
F29  16 grand-daughter of his mother's, Eleanor Margaret Courtney, became
F29  17 owner of Penkill and assumed the name *"Courtney-Boyd,**" which name
F29  18 the present owner, her half-sister, Miss Evelyn May Courtney, also
F29  19 assumed on succeeding to the estate in 1946.
F29  20    |^Penkill Castle sits, perched on a hill about three miles from
F29  21 Girvan, so hidden by trees that it is almost invisible from the road.
F29  22 ^It was built by Adam Boyd, grandson of Robert, Lord of Kilmarnock,
F29  23 around 1450, on land granted to him by Alexander *=3 for assisting him
F29  24 at the Battle of Largs.
F29  25    |^Penkill was a tall keep with corner turrets pierced with
F29  26 loop-holes for defence. ^The living-room above the basement where the
F29  27 cattle were housed was paved in red and yellow tiles, while, above
F29  28 this, was the Lady's Bower. ^Deep glens made a natural moat and there
F29  29 was a drawbridge and portcullis (found years later lying in a
F29  30 blacksmith's yard).
F29  31    |^The castle fell into disrepair, and when, in 1628, Thomas Boyd
F29  32 brought his young love, Marion Mure of Rowallan, to view his heritage,
F29  33 they found it in a sorry state. ^Yet, we can imagine Marion, fired by
F29  34 its ancient beauty, crying, ^*"Thomas, we \2maun bide in Penkill.
F29  35 ^We'll make it a \2bonnie \2hame.**"
F29  36    |^And together they did. ^With Marion's dowry, walls were repaired,
F29  37 rooms added, and an outside stair built. ^Above its doorway was
F29  38 inserted a plaque uniting the heraldry of both families. ^Oak chairs
F29  39 (still to be seen today) were carved with their initials and the date,
F29  40 1628.
F29  41    |^Though Penkill descended from father to son till 1750, the house
F29  42 was neglected, and when, in 1827, Spencer Boyd inherited Penkill it
F29  43 had been a deserted ruin for nearly a hundred years. ^However, when he
F29  44 came of age, his maternal English grandfather, William Losh, proud of
F29  45 his grandson's Scottish heritage, provided the necessary money to
F29  46 restore it, and, with his mother and sister, Spencer Boyd made it
F29  47 their home.
F29  48    |^So, in the 1800's rose the Penkill we know. ^Probably influenced
F29  49 by the Victorian taste for heavy architecture, Spencer caused to be
F29  50 built a great tower to enclose a handsome circular staircase. ^The
F29  51 ruined staircase and doorway were swept away and passages and
F29  52 ante-rooms joined the staircase to the rooms of the keep. ^Oak trees
F29  53 on the estate were used in the renovations. ^His sister, Alice, a
F29  54 woman of fine, artistic perception, had the deep windows of the keep,
F29  55 with their stone seats, glazed with clear glass so that the views from
F29  56 each appear like framed pictures.
F29  57    |^When their mother died, Alice Boyd, wishing to further her
F29  58 interest in painting, went to Newcastle School of Art, where she met
F29  59 one of the executive, William Bell Scott, painter and poet. ^Thus
F29  60 began a close friendship with him and his wife. ^Later, the families
F29  61 divided their time between Penkill and London, where Scott was
F29  62 appointed decorative artist at South Kensington.
F29  63    |^During their stay in London, the families met many famous people,
F29  64 Holman Hunt, Swinburne, Tennyson, William Morris and Dante and
F29  65 Christina Rossetti.
F29  66    |^Spencer Boyd died in 1867, and was buried on a wild day of snow
F29  67 in Old Dailly churchyard. ^After her brother's death, Alice Boyd
F29  68 commissioned Scott to paint a mural on the circular staircase. ^He
F29  69 chose to illustrate *"The King's \2Quair,**" executing it with oil
F29  70 pigments, the medium being wax dissolved in turpentine. ^Some of the
F29  71 painting, which took four years to complete, was ruined by the lime of
F29  72 the thick walls having not yet dried out, and Scott repainted part in
F29  73 zinc. Though he wrote later in his autobiography, ~*"Most probably the
F29  74 pictures will now remain without change,**" part has again corroded,
F29  75 but enough remains to show the brilliance of colour and design.
F29  76    |^In 1868, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in despair because of failing
F29  77 eyesight, was invited to Penkill. ^Here he found tranquillity in its
F29  78 worn battlements, and in the rolling meadows and deep glens.
F29  79 ^Christina Rossetti came also to Penkill, and wrote some of her poems
F29  80 in *"Windy Room,**" a bedroom at the top of the keep. ^She described
F29  81 Alice Boyd as *"perhaps the prettiest, handsomest woman I ever met.**"
F29  82    |^Penkill is not a pretentious castle. ^It is a well-loved,
F29  83 comfortable home ever open to those who love the countryside. ^With no
F29  84 rich furnishings, it yet retains, with its priceless tapestries, a
F29  85 harmony befitting its ancient grey stone.
F29  86    |^The deep windows in the low-roofed library, with its grey velvet
F29  87 settee drawn up to the fire, look towards the west, the glowing
F29  88 colours of orange, red, and blue, in the carpets, seeming to vie with
F29  89 the hues of the sunset as it burns over Ailsa and Kintyre.
F29  90    |^Above is the square drawing-room, with rose carpet and wine
F29  91 curtains contrasting with the deep blue panelled roof. ^The Flemish
F29  92 tapestries on the walls make a fitting background for the gilt
F29  93 furniture.
F29  94    |^The roof of the Laird's bedroom, in the 1628 part of the house,
F29  95 was painted by Alice Boyd, whose work, with that of William Morris,
F29  96 appears in some of the rooms. ^The dark oak furniture was carved by
F29  97 Spencer Boyd.
F29  98    |^To the right of the tower which dominates Penkill is the long
F29  99 addition which William Bell Scott designed in 1883 as a gallery for
F29 100 his paintings and those of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. ^Now an attractive
F29 101 dining-room, it is approached by a passage hung with William Morris
F29 102 tapestries. ^It contains many fine paintings and drawings by Rossetti,
F29 103 David Scott (whose fine portrait of his brother William is in the
F29 104 National Gallery), and William Bell Scott. ^The latter's *"Una and the
F29 105 Lion**" hangs here. ^This room, panelled in pitch pine, contains the
F29 106 Chippendale chairs and gate-legged table belonging to the grandfather
F29 107 Losh who helped to redeem Penkill.
F29 108 *<*4MacDougall Chief *0and the *4Robber*>
F29 109 *<*2BY SETON GORDON*>
F29 110    |^JOHN MACDOUGALL OF MACDOUGALL, CHIEF OF THE CLAN, LIVED IN *0the
F29 111 early 18th century. ^He was usually known as Iain Ciar, which may be
F29 112 translated in English as Dark-complexioned John. ^He was a leading
F29 113 figure in the first Jacobite rising in 1715, and on the suppression of
F29 114 that rising was an outlaw for a number of years. ^During his
F29 115 wanderings in disguise, he crossed the sea to Ireland in order to
F29 116 visit the Earl of Antrim, his kinsman. ^At the edge of a wide and dark
F29 117 forest, he was advised by a woman he met to continue his journey
F29 118 through open country, for she said that a noted robber lived in the
F29 119 forest, and waylaid anyone who should pass that way. ^She told Iain
F29 120 Ciar that, so great a menace was the robber, the Earl of Antrim had
F29 121 offered a reward of *+1000 to anyone who should slay him and bring him
F29 122 his head.
F29 123    |^The MacDougall chief, penniless and anxious to cross the sea to
F29 124 France to be beyond the reach of his enemies, thought that this was an
F29 125 opportunity not to be missed. ^He and his trusty companion,
F29 126 Livingstone by name, therefore entered the forest, and as they
F29 127 followed a faint and devious track through the dark undergrowth and
F29 128 beneath old and gnarled trees, it was not long before they saw the
F29 129 famous robber standing before them. ^He demanded from Iain Ciar his
F29 130 money or his life. ^The Highland chief was without more than the
F29 131 proverbial sixpence, but that was the last thing he wished the robber
F29 132 to know. ^Telling the highwayman that he was prepared to part with
F29 133 neither, he challenged him to mortal combat. ^Both men were expert
F29 134 swordsmen and the fight was long and hard, but the victory was at last
F29 135 gained by Iain Ciar, who carried the robber's head to the Earl of
F29 136 Antrim, and received from him the *+1000 reward.
F29 137    |^The robber's whistle is one of the heirlooms at Dunollie Castle,
F29 138 Oban, the ancestral seat of the Chiefs of MacDougall, where the family
F29 139 still reside below the ancient stronghold on its rock looking out
F29 140 towards the Isle of Mull. ^Beneath the ivy-grown castle is an old and
F29 141 weather-beaten Scots fir. ^This tree is now upwards of 150 years old.
F29 142 ^It was planted to commemorate Captain Alexander MacDougall of
F29 143 MacDougall, of the 72nd regiment (later the Seaforth Highlanders),
F29 144 eldest son of Patrick MacDougall, Chief of the Clan. ^Captain
F29 145 Alexander was killed, at the age of 27, at Cuidad Rodrigo in Spain, in
F29 146 1812. ^His miniature, by William Englehart, is preserved at Dunollie.
F29 147    |^The name of Captain MacDougall is well known to pipers of the
F29 148 present day, for a celebrated composition in Ceo*?3l Mo*?2r, the Great
F29 149 Music of the Highland bagpipe, was written in his honour by almost the
F29 150 last of the hereditary MacDougall pipers to the chiefs, Ronald
F29 151 MacDougall. ^The hereditary MacDougall pipers, while not so famous as
F29 152 the MacCrimmons of Skye, were players and composers of distinction,
F29 153 and the tune, *"Lament for Captain MacDougall,**" is one of delicacy
F29 154 and feeling. ^These pipers lived at Moleigh, near Oban, and their
F29 155 portion of land was known as Croit \nam Piobairean, the Piper's Croft.
F29 156 ^Like the MacCrimmons, the MacDougalls had their College of Piping,
F29 157 the last who presided at this college being Ronald Ba*?3n MacDougall,
F29 158 who was the grandfather of Ronald Mo*?2r, the last hereditary piper to
F29 159 the clan.

F29 162 *<*5The Story of James, Duke of Albany and York, as Lord High
F29 163 Commissioner at Holyroodhouse*>
F29 164    |^*2THE VISIT OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN TO *0the General Assembly
F29 165 last October was unique in many ways. ^The occasion was, of course,
F29 166 the Quatercentenary of the Scottish Reformation, but besides this Her
F29 167 Majesty was the very first Sovereign Lady to honour the *"Fathers and
F29 168 Brethren**" with her presence, a circumstance not lacking in
F29 169 significance, especially when one recalls John Knox's well kent
F29 170 fulminations against women in general and female rulers in particular.
F29 171 ^The last reigning monarch to attend the Assembly was actually James
F29 172 *=6, before he became the King of *"Great Brittany,**" and before the
F29 173 appearance of his Authorised Version of the Bible; and he did so in
F29 174 order to discipline the members, not to praise or encourage them. ^It
F29 175 was he, too, who instituted the office of High Commissioner, so that
F29 176 the Crown could keep a good eye on the proceedings; and ever since
F29 177 Jacobean times the Sovereign has been represented at the Assembly by a
F29 178 royally appointed representative.
F29 179    |^The office of Lord High Commissioner is now more ornamental than
F29 180 functional, at least in the sense that the holder is no longer a
F29 181 *"spy**" in the pay of the Crown, which itself has changed beyond all
F29 182 recognition and is completely above politics or religious faction.
F29 183 ^Curiously enough, however, the first purely Scottish Bill of the
F29 184 present Parliament proposed an increase in the allowance made to the
F29 185 Queen's representative to the General Assembly, and in doing so drew
F29 186 unexpected attention to the altered meaning of that role, showing how
F29 187 it too had lost its controversial flavour. ^Many Commissioners have
F29 188 come from the ranks of the aristocracy and professional classes, some
F29 189 have been personally associated with the work of the Kirk, while one,
F29 190 James, Duke of Albany and York, brother of Charles *=2, was a convert
F29 191 to Roman Catholicism.
F29 192    |^Unlike the *"Merry Monarch,**" the future James *=7 and *=2
F29 193 stubbornly refused to subscribe to the *"Test Act,**" which required
F29 194 all holders of office under the Crown to declare themselves
F29 195 Protestants. ^He found himself excluded from the Court, removed from
F29 196 the Navy Office, and banished, first to Holland, and then, in 1679, to
F29 197 Scotland, where the law was less rigorous.

F30   6    |^*1The Canon in *"Don Quixote**": ^There is no doubt that there
F30   7 was such a man as El Cid, but much doubt whether he achieved what is
F30   8 attributed to him.

F30  10    |^*0El Cid*- the hero idealised in Spain's most famous mediaeval
F30  11 epic poem, also by Corneille and Victor Hugo, and now in an American
F30  12 spectacular film. ^What are the facts about this man who has inspired
F30  13 such a powerful legend?
F30  14    |^Rodrigo \de Vivar, named by the Moslem Spaniards, *1El Sayyid
F30  15 Campeador, *0the lord and champion, was born about 1043 and died at
F30  16 the age of 56 in 1099. ^The date and place of his birth are unknown.
F30  17 ^His mother, of the Asturian nobility, and his father, a Castilian,
F30  18 lived in Vivar, a little village which even today is primitive and
F30  19 grim in appearance. ^The young Rodrigo found himself from the start in
F30  20 the midst of the strains and tensions that Spain was then enduring.
F30  21 ^This barren land, glacial in winter and torrid in summer, was on the
F30  22 frontier between the rival Christian kingdoms of Castile and Navarre,
F30  23 both sides allying themselves to one or other of the Moslem states of
F30  24 Spain to gain a temporary advantage.
F30  25 *<*5The Moslem Spaniards*>
F30  26    |^*0At this stage of Europe's history, regional not national power
F30  27 was the chief motive in politics; in Spain, neither secular nor
F30  28 religious unity was considered a goal worth fighting for. ^The small
F30  29 Christian states in the north were divided; so were the Moslem states
F30  30 of central and northern Spain. ^The Moslems of Spain, the so-called
F30  31 Moors, were for the most part of Spanish blood. ^They had adopted the
F30  32 language and ways of living, and some the faith of the Moslems. ^Many
F30  33 of them had two names, Moslem and European, and had adopted such
F30  34 customs as the harem and certain legal procedures. ^Arabic was the
F30  35 written language of law and commerce for two centuries after the
F30  36 Christian conquest of Toledo by Alphonso *=6 in 1085.
F30  37 *<*5Peace and War*>
F30  38    |^*0Rodrigo \de Vivar has been called by one historian *"the most
F30  39 colourful of the Mozarabs**", the Spaniards who had adopted the Moslem
F30  40 way of life (in Arabic, \*1mustarib). ^*0He spent most of his life
F30  41 among these people. ^Having received a good education at the Christian
F30  42 court of Sancho *=2, King of Castile, he became the Constable of the
F30  43 little kingdom, a rank which included command of the army and of the
F30  44 legal administration. ^His first taste of action had been in the
F30  45 battle of Graus, at the age of twenty, between Sancho, in alliance
F30  46 with the Moors of Saragossa, and Ramiro *=1, King of Aragon. ^For the
F30  47 next twelve years of his life, he led a peaceful existence as a
F30  48 country gentleman, carefully looking after his property.
F30  49    |^During this time, he became involved in only one battle. ^Sancho
F30  50 sent him to Seville to collect tribute from the king, Motamid. ^While
F30  51 he was there Abdullah, King of Granada, attacked Seville but without
F30  52 success.
F30  53    |^Apart from this one excitement, Rodrigo led a quiet life, in the
F30  54 words of Louis Bertrand, in his *1History of Spain, *0*"saddling his
F30  55 horse only to go and raid his neighbour's cows and sheep.**"
F30  56 *<*5Jimena*>
F30  57    |^*0To please Alphonso, Sancho's brother and rival, he agreed to
F30  58 marry Jimena Diaz, daughter of the Count of Oviedo, and niece of
F30  59 Alphonso *=5, King of Leon. ^This marriage of convenience was designed
F30  60 to strengthen an alliance between the Castilian and Leonese nobility.
F30  61 ^Later Rodrigo helped Sancho in his struggle for power with his
F30  62 brother, by suggesting a deceitful way of taking possession of Leon.
F30  63    |^A new period in Rodrigo's life began in his late thirties, in
F30  64 1081, when Alphonso *=6, Sancho's younger brother and successor,
F30  65 exiled him from his kingdom. ^He had, it was alleged, kept part of the
F30  66 tribute he had collected from Motamid of Seville. ^For this he was
F30  67 dismissed from the court and banished.
F30  68    |^At the head of three hundred free lances, he rode out of Vivar,
F30  69 leaving Jimena and his children, to begin a life of mercenary combat,
F30  70 living by what he could commandeer. ^In his subsequent conduct, made
F30  71 up of both cruelty and kindness, *"he was almost as much Moslem as
F30  72 Christian**" (Philip Hitti, *1History of the Arabs).
F30  73    |^*0He first offered his services to Berenguer, the Christian Count
F30  74 of Barcelona. ^The count rejected him. ^He then travelled on to
F30  75 Saragossa, where Moktadir, the Moslem king now ruled. ^This time his
F30  76 offer was accepted. ^As Moktadir was in alliance with Alphonso of
F30  77 Castile, Rodrigo was not making any dramatic or even unusual departure
F30  78 from one way of life to another. ^Such hard and fast divisions of
F30  79 humanity were to come later.
F30  80    |^At Saragossa, the old Roman town of Caesarea Augustus, Rodrigo
F30  81 served his new master well. ^Fighting for him against the Christian
F30  82 King of Navarre, he won from his Moslem soldiers the title of *1El Cid
F30  83 Campeador. ^*0He extended the Moslem dominions at the expense of the
F30  84 Christian states of Aragon and Barcelona, and led raids into his
F30  85 former province of Castile. ^Moktadir, the King of Saragossa, was a
F30  86 man of letters and the cultured head of a court of poets, philosophers
F30  87 and tutors. ^Rodrigo made this court his home and the base for his
F30  88 career of freebooting. ^Saragossa, the most Islamised city of Spain, a
F30  89 town of minarets and mosques, fountains and entertainment, must have
F30  90 been a fascinating place to live in. ^Rodrigo lived here for more than
F30  91 ten years, until he established himself as sole ruler of Valencia in
F30  92 1094.
F30  93 *<*5Valencia*>
F30  94    |^*0In the words of Louis Bertrand, *"the great love of the Cid was
F30  95 not Jimena; it was Valencia**". ^In charge of an army of seven
F30  96 thousand men, most of them Moslem, he besieged this Moslem city for
F30  97 nine months and finally defeated it. ^All the conditions he had agreed
F30  98 to before the surrender, he violated; the *1Cadi, *0his opposite
F30  99 number, he burnt alive.
F30 100    |^Before the occupation of Valencia, Rodrigo had shown inexcusable
F30 101 cruelty by throwing refugees from the city onto bivouac fires. ^He
F30 102 chased the remainder back into the town, unleashing his camp dogs onto
F30 103 them.
F30 104    |^Having established himself as sole ruler of Valencia and Murcia,
F30 105 he summoned his wife and his daughters. ^He made the chief Mosque a
F30 106 Cathedral and installed an archbishop. ^In general policy he followed
F30 107 the course that he had adopted at the court of Moktamid, of peaceful
F30 108 co-operation with both the Christians and the Moslems in his domain.
F30 109 ^He proudly called himself *"Emperor of the Two Religions**", but he
F30 110 withstood any prompting he may have received of giving himself the
F30 111 official title of King.
F30 112 *<*5The Berbers*>
F30 113    |^*0Rodrigo and his family only enjoyed four years of rule in
F30 114 Valencia. ^In 1099 his realm was attacked by the Berber warriors of
F30 115 North Africa, attracted across the narrow Straits by the high standard
F30 116 of living and the riches of Moslem Spain. ^At the battle of Cuenca he
F30 117 was defeated and he died shortly afterwards of a fever. ^Valencia held
F30 118 out for another three years, at the end of which, Jimena left the city
F30 119 with her children, taking with her the bones of her dead husband, to
F30 120 bury them in the monastery of San Pedro at Cardena, near Burgos.
F30 121 *<*5The Legend*>
F30 122    |^*0The anonymous {*1Poema del Cid}, *0the finest and the oldest
F30 123 extant Spanish literary work, appeared in the latter half of the
F30 124 twelfth century. ^This poem, together with nearly two hundred ballads
F30 125 written about him, most of which were written in the sixteenth
F30 126 century, extol Rodrigo as a brave and chivalrous knight, and as the
F30 127 inspirational hero of the Christian conquest of Spain. ^The \*1Poema
F30 128 *0has deeply influenced Spanish thought and the formation of the
F30 129 national character.
F30 130    |^El Cid, in fact, lived comfortably in both the Christian and
F30 131 Moslem courts of Spain. ^He fought the invading Berbers, it is true;
F30 132 but then, so did the Moslem states of Spain also. ^Some writers have
F30 133 tried to justify the claims made by the \*1Poema *0and the ballads;
F30 134 one of them, Louis Bertrand, in his *1History of Spain, *0can only
F30 135 say: ^*"It is impossible that this great Castilian should not have
F30 136 conceived the future unification of Spain as an absolute necessity**".
F30 137 ^The *1known *0facts of Rodrigo's life show that he was more concerned
F30 138 with truly peaceful co-existence between the two religions (with an
F30 139 occasional raid as a diversion and an extension of diplomacy) than
F30 140 with the concept of total victory for one side or the other.

F30 142 *<*5by Francis Carr*>
F30 143    |^*0The strangest sight in London in 1698 was that of the giant
F30 144 Tsar of Russia, striding out of his house in Norfolk Street, just off
F30 145 the Strand, and entering one of the local taverns to quaff a pint of
F30 146 ale. ^At six foot nine inches, he was certainly the tallest celebrity
F30 147 in the western world.
F30 148    |^On January 10th, of that year, at the age of twenty-six, Peter
F30 149 arrived in London. ^He had come from Amsterdam with an escort of three
F30 150 British war-ships aboard *"The Royal Transport**", a fine new yacht
F30 151 which King William was later to present to him. ^Stories of Peter's
F30 152 *'grand embassy**' had already spread throughout every country on the
F30 153 Continent. ^Never before had such a large body of Russians come so far
F30 154 from their native land, and never before had western Europe seen a
F30 155 Tsar.
F30 156    |^On his journey through Hanover Peter had met the beautiful
F30 157 Electress of Brandenburg, Princess Sophia Charlotte, whose husband,
F30 158 Frederick, was four years later to declare himself the first King of
F30 159 Prussia. ^She and her mother Sophia, the Electress of Hanover, gave a
F30 160 large banquet in Peter's honour; being unused to western manners, he
F30 161 became embarrassed and almost speechless. ^He amused the company by
F30 162 saying, in reply to questions about his favourite pastimes, *"from my
F30 163 youth up I have had a real passion for navigation and fireworks**".
F30 164 ^After the banquet he played to the court on his own drum.
F30 165    |^In Holland he lived incognito as a carpenter in the shipyards of
F30 166 the East India Company at Amsterdam. ^This soon became an open secret,
F30 167 but Peter insisted on keeping up the pretence, turning his back on
F30 168 anyone calling him *"Your Majesty**". ^He lived and dressed as a
F30 169 workman, lit his own fire and cooked his own meals. ^The Duke of
F30 170 Marlborough came to the shipyards to look at him, and the foreman
F30 171 pointed him out*- hardly necessary on account of his great height*- by
F30 172 saying: ^*"Peterbas (Master Peter), help those men carry the
F30 173 planks**". ^During the five months he stayed in Holland, he studied,
F30 174 besides carpentry, navigation, astronomy, law-court procedure,
F30 175 fortification, mathematics, printing, botany, copper-plate engraving,
F30 176 surgery, dentistry, and the making of fire-engines and fireworks. ^He
F30 177 impressed his instructors by his eagerness to learn and the speed with
F30 178 which he grasped the essentials of each subject.
F30 179    |^He arranged for 345 Dutch sailors, several ship's captains and
F30 180 doctors, and many other craftsmen to sail to Russia to teach their
F30 181 various skills. ^Having been told (by an Englishman) that in England
F30 182 he would find the cleverest shipbuilders in the world, he asked King
F30 183 William, whom he met in Utrecht, for permission to come to this
F30 184 country. ^This was gladly given, and the King, when he was back in
F30 185 England, gave him his newest yacht, the *"Royal Transport**", a
F30 186 handsome vessel mounting twenty brass cannon, and three men-of-war as
F30 187 escort. ^Peter set sail from Amsterdam with a dozen of his friends,
F30 188 having left behind the greater part of his embassy to continue their
F30 189 apprenticeship in the Dutch shipyards and munition works. ^In charge
F30 190 of the convoy was Vice-Admiral Mitchell, to whom Peter later said,
F30 191 while watching a sham naval battle off Spithead, that he thought an
F30 192 English admiral was a happier man than a Tsar.
F30 193 *<*5In his shirtsleeves*>
F30 194    |^*0After three days at sea the Russians arrived at Greenwich,
F30 195 where Peter left his yacht and boarded the royal barge, which took him
F30 196 to the Strand. ^Here he was given a house in Norfolk Street. ^This
F30 197 soon resembled a stable. ^Three days after his arrival, William called
F30 198 on him and was taken up to his bedroom, where the Tsar met the King in
F30 199 his shirtsleeves.

F31   5    |^*4She was not quite thirty and was obviously having trouble
F31   6 putting her left foot to the ground.
F31   7    |^*0Her husband had to help her into my consulting room. ^She told
F31   8 me what had happened.
F31   9    |^*"I was coming downstairs with an armful of things and I tripped
F31  10 on the last step but one. ^The carpet's loose there and my heel got
F31  11 caught. ^I fell with my foot underneath me.**"
F31  12    |^Obediently she slipped off her right shoe and stocking. ^I helped
F31  13 her out of the slipper she was wearing on her left foot.
F31  14    |^*"I took my stocking off to bathe my foot in cold water,**" she
F31  15 said apologetically.
F31  16    |^I made her lie on the examination couch, and compared the two
F31  17 ankles.
F31  18 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
F31  19    |^*4There was nothing much to see except that the left one was
F31  20 badly swollen.
F31  21 **[END INDENTATION**]
F31  22    |^*0I persuaded her to try all the different movements of the
F31  23 ankles and toes. ^Her right foot moved normally of course. ^Her left
F31  24 foot would move a little in most directions but all her movements were
F31  25 limited and painful. ^It hurt most when she tried to twist the foot
F31  26 outwards.
F31  27    |^Clearly there was no damage to her foot or to her freely wiggling
F31  28 toes. ^The damage and the worst pain was in the area just below the
F31  29 left ankle bone on the outer side.
F31  30    |^I felt each ankle in turn carefully, and although the left one
F31  31 hurt her it was fairly certain that no bones were broken.
F31  32    |^*"You've been lucky,**" I told her.

F31  37    |^*0*"But we'd better have an X-ray to be quite sure about it.**"
F31  38    |^Armed with my note, her husband took her in their car to the
F31  39 casualty department. ^They were back in just over an hour. ^There was
F31  40 no fracture and all that had been needed was the simplest treatment.
F31  41    |^What they had done was to take a three-inch elastic adhesive
F31  42 bandage and apply it carefully but firmly from below upwards, so that
F31  43 it supported the torn outer ligament of her ankle.
F31  44    |^I encouraged her to try walking on it now that it was safely
F31  45 strapped up. ^She was unsteady but she could manage a few steps.
F31  46 ^*"That's a lot more comfortable,**" she agreed. ^I instructed her to
F31  47 walk on it a little each day, increasing the time daily, but being
F31  48 careful for a week and not overdoing it.
F31  49    |^At the end of a fortnight I was able to take off the bandage.
F31  50 ^For now the cure was complete. ^But to be on the safe side I advised
F31  51 her to take it easy for another fortnight. ^She was very good about
F31  52 it. ^And her husband has made sure that there are now no loose

F31  55 *<*4facts about eczema*>
F31  56 *<*6JOAN WILLIAMS *2{0S.R.N., S.C.M.} *4advises on the best ways to
F31  57 relieve discomfort*>
F31  58    |^I*2N *0the ordinary way, a baby's skin and the skin of a young
F31  59 child is perfect and quite flawless. ^But in some circumstances, a
F31  60 rash may develop of one kind or another. ^And of these, eczema calls
F31  61 for the greatest amount of skilful management and patience.
F31  62    |^Sufferers from eczema can be divided into three groups. ^Firstly,
F31  63 babies who develop it at about four months of age, and in whom the
F31  64 trouble clears up spontaneously by the second birthday; secondly,
F31  65 babies in whom the rash persists after this point has been reached;
F31  66 and thirdly, children who have no sign of eczema in babyhood, but who
F31  67 develop it when they are around two or three years of age, or even
F31  68 later.
F31  69    |^Of these three groups, the first is by far the most common.
F31  70    |^Eczema usually begins on the cheeks, which become first bright
F31  71 red, then very shiny. ^Next the skin begins to crack. ^Then follows
F31  72 the *"weeping**" stage. ^The rash tends to spread from the child's
F31  73 cheeks to his head, neck, body and limbs.
F31  74    |^It's an uncomfortable condition because of the irritation, and
F31  75 unless he is checked, the child will inevitably scratch. ^But this is
F31  76 precisely what he mustn't do, because scratching can lead to bad
F31  77 infection. ^And, quite apart from anything else, skin infections can
F31  78 be passed on to other people, although eczema itself is *1never
F31  79 *0contagious.
F31  80    |^How can this scratching and subsequent infection be prevented?
F31  81 ^By making impossible direct contact between the baby's hands and the
F31  82 affected skin. ^This entails completely covering the latter by means
F31  83 of dry sterile gauze and bandages, and/or a washable cotton garment.
F31  84 ^And, unless he is at an age when he can take them off, by putting his
F31  85 hands in cotton mitts.
F31  86 *<*4cure unknown*>
F31  87    |^*0There is no known way of curing eczema. ^If it's going to clear
F31  88 up, as is usually the case, it will do so of its own accord, generally
F31  89 when the child is between eighteen months and two years of age.
F31  90    |^If it doesn't go spontaneously by this time, it's likely to last
F31  91 for several years, as is the case when the older child develops it.
F31  92 ^Fortunately, in these circumstances, the eczema is generally the
F31  93 *"dry**" type, and only slight, restricted to neck, elbows, and behind
F31  94 the knees.
F31  95    |^But even though there is no specific treatment which will cure
F31  96 eczema, there are ways by which discomfort can be greatly eased.
F31  97    |^First on the list of relief measures is a simple lotion, cream or
F31  98 ointment, which is applied direct to the affected skin in order to
F31  99 relieve the irritation. ^Usually, the doctor will prescribe calamine
F31 100 for *"weeping**" eczema, and zinc cream or coal tar ointment for the
F31 101 *"dry**" type.
F31 102 *<*4sedative*>
F31 103    |^*0Almost certainly, he will prescribe a suitable sedative, too.
F31 104 ^Probably, one which is also an anti-histamine (which means it is able
F31 105 to offset to some extent at least, the irritating effect of the
F31 106 chemical substance called histamine spilling out from body cells into
F31 107 the tissues).
F31 108    |^Something else the doctor is likely to prescribe is a special
F31 109 emulsifying ointment. ^This is used instead of ordinary soap. ^For the
F31 110 latter may well increase the irritation and probably aggravate the
F31 111 rash.
F31 112    |^Since wool is also irritating to the child with eczema, it's
F31 113 advisable for his mother to make him removable linings or little
F31 114 undergarments of butter muslin or cotton.
F31 115    |^But it's *1not *0necessary to put him on a special diet. ^Some
F31 116 babies seem to improve when fed on a reliable brand of evaporated milk
F31 117 or soya bean flour instead of fresh or dried milk. ^But then the
F31 118 well-known child specialist with whom I discussed the subject of
F31 119 eczema is convinced that these children would improve anyway, and that
F31 120 it has nothing to do with the milk.
F31 121    |^One last word. ^Just as there is no specific cure for eczema, so
F31 122 there is no one specific cause. ^Nevertheless, it is regarded as an
F31 123 allergic reaction, although it's only in rare cases that a particular
F31 124 substance can be detected to which the child is allergic.
F31 125    |^Some believe that eczema is caused by emotional factors, even in
F31 126 the youngest baby. ^But while most experienced doctors will agree that
F31 127 the condition is aggravated by tension, they do not agree that this is
F31 128 the basic cause. ^Except, possibly, in the older child.
F31 129    |^Certainly in such a child, eczema is made worse by parental
F31 130 tension, and by repeated attempts to find someone who will cure him.
F31 131    |^Fortunately, it's equally true that the condition begins to
F31 132 improve once the family doctor can induce the parents to accept
F31 133 philosophically the fact that their child has eczema, that there is no
F31 134 specific cure, but that, in time, it's almost certain to disappear.
F31 135    |^This spontaneous disappearance of the rash is even more likely
F31 136 when, in addition to carrying out the proper treatment, the parents
F31 137 are able to provide tranquillity and happiness within the home itself,
F31 138 and in their day-to-day dealings with their child.

F31 141 *<*6CRAMP*>
F31 142    |^*4She was a tall, slim, athletic looking nineteen-year-old.
F31 143    |^*0*"I'm going on holiday with friends next month,**" she said,
F31 144 *"and want to swim a lot. ^I'm apt to get cramp and wondered how to
F31 145 prevent it?**"
F31 146    |^*"When do you get cramp?**"
F31 147    |^*"Mostly at night, but I'm worried about getting it while I'm
F31 148 swimming. ^Usually it starts just as I'm going to sleep,**" she added.
F31 149 ^*"Always in my right leg. ^Here,**" touching her calf muscles. ^*"But
F31 150 if I get up and stamp around the bedroom it soon goes.**"
F31 151    |^*"Does it happen any special night in the week?**" I asked.
F31 152    |^She said slowly: ^*"Well, I've noticed it on Tuesdays and
F31 153 Thursdays.**"
F31 154    |^*"What do you do on those days that you don't on others?**"
F31 155    |^The answer was that she went to keep-fit sessions at a local
F31 156 gymnasium.
F31 157    |^*"Do you perspire a lot?**"
F31 158    |^*"We all do, but we drink lots of lemonade and that sort of
F31 159 thing.**"
F31 160 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
F31 161    |^*4I explained to her that cramp is often caused by having lost
F31 162 salt through sweating.
F31 163 **[END INDENTATION**]
F31 164    |^*0*"You get thirsty and drink a lot.
F31 165    |^*"All the body fluids are salty, and the salt and water is
F31 166 carefully balanced. ^Lose water and salt by sweating profusely and
F31 167 they stay in balance. ^Replace only the water and the balance of salt
F31 168 gets upset and that shows up very commonly as a muscular cramp later
F31 169 on.
F31 170    |^*"You must try what people do in hot countries. ^Drop a salt
F31 171 tablet into the water or lemonade and you replace both salt and water.
F31 172 ^Then you won't get cramp.**"
F31 173 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
F31 174    |^*4On holiday, I told her, she was more likely to get cramp if she
F31 175 swam soon after a meal.
F31 176 **[END INDENTATION**]
F31 177    |^*0*"Wait at least an hour after eating, and never swim when you
F31 178 are cold. ^Warm up your muscles by running about and doing a few
F31 179 exercises before you go into the water.
F31 180    |^*"If ever you do get cramp in the water, don't panic. ^Float on
F31 181 your back and use your hands and arms to scull yourself back to the
F31 182 beach.
F31 183    |^*"Then pull the cramped leg right up to your chest and massage
F31 184 the affected calf muscles. ^If you can get some heat into them*- say
F31 185 from a handkerchief soaked in a thermos of hot tea*- so much the
F31 186 better.
F31 187    |^*"And if you should get cramp again in bed at night pull your leg
F31 188 up to your chest. ^Then try to pull your toes up towards your chin.
F31 189 ^That lengthens and stretches the contracted muscles and the cramp
F31 190 will soon go.**"
F31 191    |^I learnt later that she had a really wonderful holiday with never
F31 192 a hint of cramp. ^*6\0DR. MERIDITH.

F31 194 *<*4Discussing delayed pregnancy, *6JOAN WILLIAMS *2{0S.R.N.,
F31 195 S.C.M.} *4emphasizes that, with rare exceptions, every young couple
F31 196 may become parents*>
F31 197    |^I*2T *0is a known fact that within the framework of marriages
F31 198 where there is a complete and natural sex relationship, pregnancy will
F31 199 begin within a year for about eighty out of a hundred couples. ^And
F31 200 with only a further ten per cent will it occur during the second year.
F31 201    |^Obviously then, a couple who have tried unsuccessfully for a
F31 202 whole year to have a baby are justified in thinking that something may
F31 203 be wrong. ^And they are equally justified in seeking medical advice.
F31 204 ^Indeed, they would be wise to do so: particularly if the wife is in
F31 205 her late twenties or older.
F31 206    |^They may well find that the delay has a very simple explanation
F31 207 which is quickly revealed through a quiet talk with their doctor. ^For
F31 208 often the root of the trouble is their lack of true understanding in
F31 209 regard to marital relationship, and/or the fertile phase in the
F31 210 menstrual cycle.
F31 211 *<*4adjustment*>
F31 212    |^*0In this case, the putting into practice of necessary
F31 213 adjustments will probably lead to the desired pregnancy within a few
F31 214 months. ^Or maybe even sooner.
F31 215    |^And if the doctor cannot find any obvious cause for the delay in
F31 216 conception? ^If he advises specialist investigation? ^There is still
F31 217 no cause for despondency or apprehension. ^For true sterility is rare,
F31 218 and there is every chance that the cause or causes of delay will be
F31 219 found through tests*- none of which is in the least alarming.

F32   4 **[EDITORIAL**]
F32   5    |^*6D*2URING *0pregnancy, a baby lies curled up in his mother's
F32   6 womb, surrounded by a bag of warm, protective fluid. ^The neck of the
F32   7 womb (cervix) is tightly closed beneath him, and sealed with a plug of
F32   8 jelly-like mucus, which prevents infection from getting to the womb.
F32   9    |^When he is ready to be born, three things must happen. ^The plug
F32  10 of mucus must drop away, then the womb is no longer sealed.
F32  11    |^The cervix must stretch sufficiently to let the baby pass through
F32  12 into the front passage, and the bag of membrane which holds the
F32  13 protective fluid must give way, allowing the fluid to escape*-
F32  14 otherwise the baby would be held in the womb even after the cervix had
F32  15 stretched completely.
F32  16    |^Usually, the first thing that the mother notices when labour
F32  17 begins, is that the tightening and relaxing of her womb (which has
F32  18 been going on for some time during pregnancy) has suddenly taken on a
F32  19 rhythm.
F32  20    |^That is, the contractions are occurring *1regularly.
F32  21    |^*0When this happens, even though half an hour, or even longer,
F32  22 may pass between contractions, she will know that her labour has
F32  23 started.
F32  24    |^With or without regular contractions, she may have a *"show.**"
F32  25 ^This is just the plug of mucus which has left the cervix and passed
F32  26 down the vagina. ^Usually it is streaked with a little blood.
F32  27    |^Although it's as well to notify hospital or midwife when labour
F32  28 contractions are coming at fifteen minute intervals, or less, there's
F32  29 no need, as a rule, to do anything about a show which is not
F32  30 accompanied by either of the other two signs of labour.
F32  31    |^However, if the show contains more blood than would go on a
F32  32 penny, then it's a wise precaution to seek advice. ^For this *1might
F32  33 *0mean that labour is progressing more rapidly than is expected.
F32  34    |^Sometimes the first sign that labour has begun is the breaking of
F32  35 the bag of waters, or *"rupture of the membranes.**" ^There is a
F32  36 sudden, uncontrolled gush of fluid, which comes from the womb, not
F32  37 from the bladder.
F32  38    |^In point of fact, the waters can break at any time during labour.
F32  39 ^Sometimes this doesn't happen until the baby is ready to be born.
F32  40 ^But when they break right at the beginning, even though there have
F32  41 been no regular contractions, and no show, it's a sign that Baby is
F32  42 starting his journey, and the expectant mother should notify hospital
F32  43 or midwife.
F32  44    |
F32  45    |^*4The first stage *0of labour progresses steadily, but quite
F32  46 slowly, as a rule. ^With first babies it may take anything up to
F32  47 twenty-four hours or so. ^During this time, the regular, rhythmic
F32  48 contractions of the womb gradually draw open, or stretch, the cervix.
F32  49 ^As the cervix stretches, the baby sinks lower in the womb.
F32  50    |^Usually an expectant mother is quite happy to remain up and about
F32  51 during the early first stage of labour*- unless it's night time, of
F32  52 course. ^It's when contractions are stronger, and more frequent, that
F32  53 she prefers to lie down. |^Various preparations and examinations are
F32  54 carried out during this stage of labour. ^Preparations such as shaving
F32  55 away body hair, and giving an enema, to ensure cleanliness when the
F32  56 baby is born. ^And examinations to discover how rapidly labour is
F32  57 progressing, and to check the condition of both mother and baby.
F32  58    |^The commonest, and most frequent, of these examinations is a
F32  59 regular pulse, temperature and blood pressure check, and gentle
F32  60 examination of the mother's tummy to track Baby's downward progress.
F32  61 ^Combined with careful listening to his heartbeats through a little
F32  62 metal stethoscope.
F32  63    |^But, in addition to these regular examinations, it is quite usual
F32  64 for an internal examination to be made some time during labour*- or
F32  65 maybe more than one.
F32  66    |^This is nothing to be alarmed about. ^If the doctor or midwife
F32  67 decides that such an examination is needed it doesn't mean that there
F32  68 is anything wrong.
F32  69    |^Simply that it's the most accurate way, at that point, of
F32  70 checking how far labour has progressed, of estimating how much longer
F32  71 it is likely to last, and of deciding how best to help the mother
F32  72 relax, so that she can co-operate with the contractions that are
F32  73 bringing her baby into the world.
F32  74    |
F32  75    |^*4It's during the first stage of labour *0that the fruits of an
F32  76 expectant mother's daily practice of relaxation and breath control can
F32  77 really come into their own.
F32  78    |^For if she is able to relax, and *"go with**" each contraction,
F32  79 she will not only be helping herself to experience the minimum of
F32  80 discomfort, but she will also be helping the contraction to exert the
F32  81 maximum stretching power on her cervix.
F32  82    |^This can result in a shorter labour, for it follows that the more
F32  83 the cervix stretches with each contraction, the fewer contractions
F32  84 will be needed for the end result.
F32  85    |^This does not mean, however, that an expectant mother carries the
F32  86 responsibility for the duration or outcome of her labour. ^Simply that
F32  87 she can help, as a rule.
F32  88    |
F32  89    |^*4In addition to her efforts *0in this direction, she should
F32  90 never hesitate to accept any drug or gas that may be offered to help
F32  91 her. ^For such drugs in no way prevent her from having a natural
F32  92 birth, and their use does not in any way mean either that something is
F32  93 not quite right *1or *0that she is not managing splendidly. ^Far from
F32  94 it.
F32  95    |^The purpose of these drugs is to back up the mother's work, to
F32  96 help her relax not only between, but also during contractions, and to
F32  97 diminish the sensation of those contractions when they become strong.
F32  98 ^But to diminish the sensation without in any way undermining their
F32  99 usefulness.
F32 100    |^As the first stage of labour draws towards its close, the
F32 101 contractions become stronger and much closer together. ^Usually they
F32 102 arrive at two to three minute intervals just before Baby is ready to
F32 103 be born.
F32 104    |^It's at this stage that many a mother feels a bit panicky*- feels
F32 105 that she's being swept along on a tide that she can't control. ^She
F32 106 wants to bear down, perhaps, but it's not quite time for her to do so.
F32 107 ^She longs for her labour to be over, and for a very little while she
F32 108 may be afraid.
F32 109    |^But it will help her if she will hold hard to the knowledge that
F32 110 all this is quite natural, and that it simply means that it's almost
F32 111 time for her to work really hard, and push her baby into the world.
F32 112    |^Deep breathing, and the use of the gas and air apparatus which is
F32 113 usually offered, will help her over this last difficult phase of the
F32 114 first stage of labour.
F32 115    |^And, in a very short while, the moment will come when the midwife
F32 116 or doctor will say that the cervix is stretched completely, and that
F32 117 now she can do what she's been waiting to do*- work as hard as she
F32 118 possibly can, with the contractions of her womb, to help her baby to
F32 119 be born.
F32 120    |^For now, instead of relaxing both between *1and *0during
F32 121 contractions, it's a case of relaxing between them to gather strength
F32 122 for the next effort, and really working when it comes.
F32 123    |^With each contraction, she will be asked to take a really deep
F32 124 breath, to hold it, and to bear down as hard as she can, and for as
F32 125 long as she can. ^For with each contraction, Baby comes a little
F32 126 nearer the outside world.
F32 127    |^Soon the head can be seen. ^A few more pushes, and it's half
F32 128 born. ^And then the mother will be asked to stop pushing, and to
F32 129 breathe quickly in and out*- like a dog panting.
F32 130    |^This helps whoever is delivering the baby to hold the head gently
F32 131 until the force of the contraction passes, and then to guide it gently
F32 132 into the world *1between *0contractions, so reducing the possibility
F32 133 of stitches being needed.
F32 134    |^Once Baby's head is delivered the rest of the body follows
F32 135 quickly. ^The second stage of labour is over. ^Baby is born. ^Here at
F32 136 last.
F32 137    |^A gasp, and a lusty yell. ^The cord is tied and cut, and Baby is
F32 138 snugly wrapped in a warm blanket. ^And, for the first time, Mother can
F32 139 hold him in her arms.
F32 140    |^It just remains for the afterbirth to come away. ^This only takes
F32 141 a few minutes as a rule, and we call it the third stage of labour.
F32 142 ^The new mother needn't give it a thought.
F32 143    |
F32 144    |^*4She can lie back *0and enjoy her baby, until the midwife,
F32 145 knowing that the afterbirth is ready to pop out, either asks her to
F32 146 relax while her tummy is pressed gently, or else to take a deep breath
F32 147 and to push down as she did when the baby arrived.
F32 148    |^One contraction, and the afterbirth comes away!
F32 149    |^Everything is over. ^A proud mother is made clean and
F32 150 comfortable, and is given the best cup of tea she's ever tasted.
F32 151    |^A brand new baby is washed, weighed and dressed. ^Then when both
F32 152 have rested from their efforts, they can lie back and receive the
F32 153 congratulations and good wishes of relatives and friends. ^And how
F32 154 well deserved they are!

F32 158 *<*4Vitamin C*>
F32 159    |^*1My baby, Aileen, is ten weeks old, fully breast fed, and
F32 160 thriving well. ^But there's just one difficulty*- neither welfare
F32 161 orange juice, rose hip syrup, nor blackcurrant juice, seems to suit
F32 162 her. ^All three bring her out in a rash, even though I follow the
F32 163 directions very carefully when giving them. ^Have you any suggestions,
F32 164 please?
F32 165    |^*6P*2OSSIBLY *0your baby may be sensitive to some substance
F32 166 contained in all three of the vitamin C drinks you have given her. ^If
F32 167 that is so, then your doctor is the person to guide you. ^But before
F32 168 taking Aileen to him, try giving her fresh orange juice.
F32 169    |^Squeeze the juice from a cut orange, making quite sure that it
F32 170 contains no pips or bits, and give Baby just one teaspoon of this in a
F32 171 little cool, boiled water, with just a tiny bit of sugar*- less than a
F32 172 quarter teaspoon*- to taste.
F32 173    |^If she tolerates this without trouble, then gradually work up the
F32 174 amount until she is having a tablespoon of pure juice, in a couple of
F32 175 ounces of boiled water, and a teaspoon of sugar. ^But *1don't
F32 176 *0continue giving the juice if she shows the slightest sign of
F32 177 sickness, loose motions, tummy discomfort or a rash.
F32 178    |^If any of these happen, take Baby to your doctor. ^He may think
F32 179 it a good idea to try her on guava juice, as this is rich in vitamin
F32 180 C, or the juice of fresh tomatoes. ^Or he may prescribe vitamin C
F32 181 tablets.
F32 182 *<*4Baby Book*>
F32 183    |^*1I believe that you have written a book to help expectant
F32 184 mothers. ^Please could you give me details?
F32 185    |^*6M*2Y *0little book *"Baby and You,**" has recently been
F32 186 completely revised, and brought up to date. ^It includes sections on
F32 187 how a baby develops in the womb, how his mother can care for her
F32 188 general health during the waiting months, how she can prepare herself
F32 189 for the birth, plan his layette, and care for him after he is born.
F32 190    |^It also includes a section on the actual birth of the baby.
F32 191    |^The booklet costs one shilling and sixpence, post free, from this
F32 192 address. ^An order form is on page 27.
F32 193 *<*4Small Operation*>
F32 194    |^*1My doctor tells me that I have a polyp on the neck of my womb,
F32 195 and I am waiting to go into hospital to have it removed. ^But I would
F32 196 like to know what this entails, and what is meant by a polyp. ^I can't
F32 197 help worrying.
F32 198    |^*6R*2EMOVAL *0of a polyp is a very simple operation, and one that
F32 199 certainly needn't alarm you. ^The polyp is a tiny little growth
F32 200 attached to the neck of the womb.
F32 201    |^It has *1nothing *0at all to do with cancer, or indeed with any
F32 202 other serious condition. ^But it does cause *"nuisance**" symptoms as
F32 203 a rule*- bleeding between periods, for example, or a vaginal
F32 204 discharge*- and therefore it's best removed.
F32 205    |^You'll probably be asked to go into hospital one or two days
F32 206 before the operation is to be performed.

F33   3 *<*4Something Hot, Something Cold*>
F33   4    |^*6M*2ORE *0than half my work consists of dealing with stomach
F33   5 trouble. ^And I know that very nearly all of it could so easily be
F33   6 avoided.
F33   7    |^Cultivate a good digestion and you'll not only feel better
F33   8 physically. ^You'll live longer.
F33   9    |^Right away, let me say you don't need to be fussy about your
F33  10 diet. ^Just take heed of a few simple rules.
F33  11    |^Here's a most important one for dinner-time.
F33  12    |^Whether it's winter or summer have something hot and something
F33  13 cold.
F33  14    |^An all-cold lunch is bad for you. ^It stuns the stomach. ^Your
F33  15 digestion is out of action for hours.
F33  16    |^An all-hot meal in winter is almost as bad. ^You need a cold
F33  17 sweet to even up the inside temperature.
F33  18    |
F33  19    |^*6D*2ON'T *0shut your eyes to the fact that some of the tastiest
F33  20 foods are pretty indigestible.
F33  21    |^I'm not going to be a spoilsport and tell you to cut them out.
F33  22 ^But try not to overdo these things:*-
F33  23    |^Hot buttered toast. ^The fat seals off the bread and the gastric
F33  24 juice can't get to work. ^The toast will lie on your stomach three
F33  25 times as long as plain bread. ^So try to make do with just one slice.
F33  26    |^There's no doubt that cheese is a grand food. ^But have you any
F33  27 idea how much you should have at a time?
F33  28    |^It's a piece the size of a small matchbox. ^Any more and you've
F33  29 only yourself to blame if you get indigestion.
F33  30    |^And the fancier the cheese the less you need.
F33  31    |^Pork is one of the hardest foods to digest. ^It's a five-hour job
F33  32 for the stomach, so a little is enough.
F33  33    |^And here's an idea to help avoid any ill-effects.
F33  34    |^Next time you have pork make a point of having stewed fruit in
F33  35 the meal. ^The fruit peps up the gastric juices and helps the
F33  36 digestion enormously.
F33  37    |
F33  38    |^*6T*2HE *0most indigestible fruit is the pear that isn't quite
F33  39 ripe. ^And warn your children not to go eating green, unripened
F33  40 apples. ^They can make a youngster ill for days, and it's no
F33  41 exaggeration to say the stomach may never fully recover.
F33  42    |^I've cured quite a few patients of the kind of indigestion that
F33  43 gives you a blown-up feeling.
F33  44    |^It's nearly always caused by drinking with a meal, so try not to
F33  45 wash your food down. ^And when you do have a glass of water don't
F33  46 swallow it at one gulp.
F33  47    |^Finally, you can have a good, sound digestion if you'll only
F33  48 remember to chew every mouthful of food twenty times.
F33  49 *<*4It's Time To Check Your Weight*>
F33  50    |^*6T*2HERE'S *0one thing I'd like everyone to do this week.
F33  51    |^Weigh yourself!
F33  52    |^This is the most important time of the year to check up.
F33  53    |^Don't worry if you're a bit underweight. ^That's natural.
F33  54    |^But if the scales show a pound or two extra, then take this
F33  55 warning.
F33  56    |^If you've a tendency to fat, it's in the summer you put on weight
F33  57 that's going to be there for good!
F33  58    |^What's more, it's important to know where the extra poundage has
F33  59 gone.
F33  60    |^Round the waist line is worst of all.
F33  61    |^Stand erect and pull in the stomach.
F33  62    |^If you still bulge round the middle, then it's high time you did
F33  63 something about it.
F33  64    |
F33  65    |^*6F*2AT *0is not a solid thing. ^It tends to flow where the skin
F33  66 is loose. ^So if you're out of condition and your stomach muscles are
F33  67 flabby*- that's where the fat goes.
F33  68    |^Stomach fat goes to two areas*- around the bowel and below the
F33  69 liver. ^And when this part of the system is hampered and clogged, the
F33  70 breathing suffers.
F33  71    |^But here's the biggest danger. ^When there's no more room round
F33  72 the middle, the fat can go straight to the heart.
F33  73    |^Women are the worst sufferers from breathlessness due to fat. ^If
F33  74 a man becomes breathless he's pretty quick to see a doctor. ^But women
F33  75 seem to take it for granted.
F33  76    |^Another area where fat can be dangerous is in the arteries.
F33  77    |^Anyone suffering from overweight risks the fat lingering in the
F33  78 bloodstream.
F33  79    |^Because of this you should never ignore a pounding in the heart
F33  80 or a throbbing of the head if you're overweight. ^If you do, you may
F33  81 be risking coronary thrombosis.
F33  82    |
F33  83    |^*6Y*2OU *0may be surprised to learn that fat can be dangerous on
F33  84 the hands and feet.
F33  85    |^This isn't common. ^But the moment a grown-up discovers she needs
F33  86 a bigger size in shoes and gloves*- see a doctor.
F33  87    |^Thick ankles are not always due to mere fat. ^Often varicose
F33  88 veins are to blame.
F33  89    |^The safest place for fat is on the arms. ^It helps to keep the
F33  90 muscles in shape.
F33  91    |^Fat round the neck is not so frightening as you might believe.
F33  92 ^Whether the fat is at the back or under the chin, the excess won't do
F33  93 any harm so long as there isn't too much of it.
F33  94    |^The first signs of a thick neck affecting health are headaches
F33  95 and irritability. ^These indicate blood pressure.
F33  96    |^By far the luckiest folk are the ones with a thin layer of
F33  97 overall fat. ^They can stand both cold and hot weather, because the
F33  98 fat under the skin helps control the body temperature.
F33  99 *<*4Little Signs I Don't Like To See*>
F33 100    |^*6I *2DIDN'T *0like the look of a patient who came to see me a
F33 101 few evenings ago.
F33 102    |^He'd rushed to the surgery and was breathing heavily. ^But it
F33 103 wasn't that which disturbed me. ^It was the time he took to recover.
F33 104    |^If you're under 25 you should get your breath back in one minute.
F33 105    |^Under 45 I'd say two minutes. ^Up to 65 the breathing should be
F33 106 easier inside four minutes.
F33 107    |^What are the other little signs a doctor doesn't like to see?
F33 108    |^When a woman comes to me complaining of tiredness and
F33 109 breathlessness, the shape of her ankles can tell me a lot.
F33 110    |^If her ankles have been steadily getting thicker I suspect
F33 111 trouble with the heart.
F33 112    |^But when there's no breathlessness and no general fatigue then
F33 113 the ankles have simply thickened with too much standing or walking.
F33 114    |
F33 115    |^*6F*2OLK *0over 45 would do well to watch the veins at the side
F33 116 of their necks.
F33 117    |^These veins stand out pretty far when you're bursting with anger
F33 118 or physical exertion. ^But when the anger dies away or the exertion is
F33 119 over these veins should subside.
F33 120    |^If they don't I've a suspicion the heart is congested and
F33 121 overtaxed.
F33 122    |^The heart has another way to tell the world it's under strain.
F33 123 ^The pulse beats at the side of the neck just where a man's collar is.
F33 124    |^Maybe you've noticed this yourself in a person full of suppressed
F33 125 excitement*- usually someone who takes a pride in self-control.
F33 126    |^Well, self-control isn't always good for health. ^The body's
F33 127 normal reactions don't like being suppressed.
F33 128    |^Secret worry and suppressed emotion affect the heart, and in many
F33 129 cases this shows in the pulse beat I mentioned.
F33 130    |^Occasionally I notice my patient has a quiver round the mouth or
F33 131 lip.
F33 132    |^This indicates nervous strain. ^No matter how you try to control
F33 133 yourself, the muscles round the mouth are first to give way.
F33 134    |
F33 135    |^*6I *2ONCE *0warned a patient he was due for an attack of lumbago
F33 136 unless he was careful.
F33 137    |^*"But how can you tell?**" he asked.
F33 138    |^*"It's quite easy,**" I told him. ^*"You're walking at a slight
F33 139 forward angle. ^That tells me your back muscles are taxed and
F33 140 uncomfortable. ^They're fighting the lumbago.**"
F33 141    |^Bloodlessness isn't so easy to detect as you might imagine. ^You
F33 142 can look as fit as a fiddle and yet be bloodless.
F33 143    |^My test rarely fails. ^I look*- not at the lips, which can be
F33 144 deceptive*- but at the ear lobes.
F33 145    |^I can learn a lot when the light is shining through the lobes
F33 146 from behind. ^I don't like to see the lobes pale or dull pink. ^The
F33 147 richer the colour the better.
F33 148 *<*4When There's Nothing Better Than A Poultice*>
F33 149    |^*6Y*2OU *0know that awful feeling you get about two o'clock in
F33 150 the morning, when you have a pain that won't let you get to sleep.
F33 151    |^A patient of mine had a pain like that in her shoulder. ^It
F33 152 gnawed and gnawed for hours.
F33 153    |^At last she got up in desperation. ^There was no fire and she was
F33 154 out of aspirins.
F33 155    |^Do you know what she did? ^She opened the oven door, lit the gas,
F33 156 and then sat in front of it.
F33 157    |^The heat certainly eased the pain. ^But if only she'd known she
F33 158 could have been lying comfortably in bed getting the same relief.
F33 159    |^All she had to do was to make an old-fashioned poultice.
F33 160    |
F33 161    |^*6A *2HOME-M*0ade bread poultice can work wonders.
F33 162    |^Just cut one slice of bread about an inch thick. ^Roll it in
F33 163 gauze muslin or thin cotton. ^Dip it into hot water then wring out.
F33 164    |^The secret is to do it gently. ^The poultice should never be
F33 165 dripping wet. ^Then test it for heat on the back of the hand.
F33 166    |^Mould the poultice over the painful part and make sure it extends
F33 167 three inches all round beyond the pain.
F33 168    |^Finally cover the lot with a piece of old flannel, cotton wool,
F33 169 or a double thickness of lint.
F33 170    |^Why does a poultice do the trick so well?
F33 171    |^Well, it dilates the blood vessels. ^It draws blood to the
F33 172 painful area. ^This in turn restores the damaged tissue and carries
F33 173 away harmful poison.
F33 174    |^And there's nothing like a poultice to help you get to sleep.
F33 175    |^When you're in pain all the muscles round the area tighten up and
F33 176 make the pain worse.
F33 177    |^But the poultice slackens off this muscle tension, and half your
F33 178 battle for sleep is won.
F33 179    |
F33 180    |^*6O*2F *0all ailments I think chest troubles get most relief from
F33 181 a poultice.
F33 182    |^Bad bronchitis can be specially distressing. ^Yet a poultice can
F33 183 ease the breathing and loosen the tightness in the chest.
F33 184    |^But, remember, children or anyone who is frail should not have
F33 185 the poultice on the chest. ^The weight might restrict the breathing.
F33 186    |^So for these folk put the poultice across the shoulders, just
F33 187 below the shoulder blades.
F33 188    |^The biggest poultice of all is needed for pleurisy. ^It should
F33 189 start under the armpit and go down almost to the waist.
F33 190    |^Of course, the best poultice of all is the kaolin variety*- if
F33 191 it's fresh and moist.
F33 192    |^But you can take comfort in the fact that you need never be
F33 193 stuck*- so long as you have a slice of bread in the house.
F33 194 *<*4Seven Golden Rules For The Winter*>
F33 195    |^*6N*2OW'S *0the time a lot of my patients ask me the same
F33 196 question.
F33 197    |^*"How is it, doctor, that you manage to keep so clear of colds
F33 198 every winter?**"
F33 199    |^They think I have some special medicine, but I don't. ^All I do
F33 200 is follow these golden rules:*-
F33 201    |^1. When the first frosts come start the day with porridge and
F33 202 milk.
F33 203    |^The lime in the oatmeal and in the milk is good for the
F33 204 circulation. ^It's specially good for anyone plagued with chilblains.
F33 205    |^But the porridge does more. ^That mass of warm oatmeal in your
F33 206 stomach is central heating at its best. ^You won't feel the cold so
F33 207 much on your way to work. ^You won't chill so easily standing for a
F33 208 bus.
F33 209    |^2. Never go out on a winter's morning with an empty or cold
F33 210 stomach. ^If you do, the blood has to rush inwards to warm up the
F33 211 stomach. ^There's less blood for the outer areas, and that can mean a
F33 212 chill.
F33 213    |^3. Always keep on the move.
F33 214    |^If you pop your finger quickly in and out of cold water you'll
F33 215 hardly feel the cold. ^Keep the finger in for a longer time and it
F33 216 will *"freeze.**"
F33 217    |^In the same way you can walk along wet roads without becoming
F33 218 chilled. ^But you're asking for trouble if you stand around for a
F33 219 gossip.
F33 220    |^4. In cold weather a little exercise is the best defence against
F33 221 rheumatism*- particularly fibrositis.
F33 222    |^There's no need for special exercises. ^Simply stretch yourself.
F33 223 ^Wiggle your hands and toes.
F33 224    |^The older you are the less strenuous the exercises should be.
F33 225 ^But even if you're over seventy, do try to get your muscles moving.

F34   8 among the leaders. ^But a kind of work that was particularly typical
F34   9 of this period was inspired, not by the French Impressionists, but by
F34  10 a group who preceded them in France, called the {*1Plein Air}
F34  11 *0(Open Air) School. ^These {*1Plein Airists} *0chose to paint their
F34  12 pictures on the spot*- not in the studio. ^They believed in working
F34  13 direct from nature, out of doors.
F34  14    |^Those British painters who tried to follow these ideals found
F34  15 themselves in difficulties with the British climate, for the climate
F34  16 of France is much more suitable to long hours of painting out of
F34  17 doors. ^However, they found a solution by moving to the mildness of
F34  18 Cornwall, in the south-west, to live. ^There, in such places as
F34  19 Penzance and Newlyn, colonies of painters settled. ^Stanhope Forbes
F34  20 and Frank Bramley represented faithfully scenes from the lives of the
F34  21 Cornish fishermen. ^Henry La Thangue and George Clausen also found, in
F34  22 the everyday life of humble folk, their favourite subjects.
F34  23    |^We can see many pictures by British artists, as well as those of
F34  24 the more recent foreign painters, at the Tate Gallery in London, which
F34  25 was opened in 1897*- an important event for art in Britain. ^This
F34  26 gallery was the generous gift of Henry Tate, the sugar merchant, who
F34  27 was made a baron by Queen Victoria just before he died, as a mark of
F34  28 the gratitude of the nation. ^Queen Victoria herself died in 1901, and
F34  29 by that time the influence of the Impressionists was being felt
F34  30 strongly in Britain. ^Painters like Lucien Pissarro, Wilson Steer,
F34  31 Spencer Gore and Sickert were working in a fully Impressionist way,
F34  32 and this kind of painting was at last becoming accepted by the British
F34  33 public in spite of the constant prejudice against new things in art.
F34  34    |^So the pioneer work of Constable and Turner, having been nurtured
F34  35 on foreign soil, echoed back to their native land after more than half
F34  36 a century had passed. ^However, by that time a new war had been raging
F34  37 in Paris for some time, where the *1Post-Impressionists *0were
F34  38 attacking the ideas of the Impressionists, though once again it was
F34  39 some time before this new conflict spread to Britain.
F34  40    |^The Impressionists, in their devotion to light, had tended to
F34  41 become quite indifferent to the objects in their pictures. ^The
F34  42 Post-Impressionists felt that this impartiality was itself a limiting
F34  43 thing. ^They held that it was the painter's feelings about a scene
F34  44 that should be expressed, not just the light that reflected from the
F34  45 scene. ^With this in view they permitted themselves to exaggerate any
F34  46 quality which they found exciting*- they claimed the right to distort
F34  47 the facts according to their own feelings.
F34  48    |^In doing so these painters finally abandoned all attempt to
F34  49 compete with the camera. ^They turned their back on realism and threw
F34  50 overboard all their time-honoured traditions.
F34  51    |^Many painters still continued to represent nature in the
F34  52 traditional way, of course. ^Such painters are called *1academic,
F34  53 *0because in general they keep to the ideals of the old academies,
F34  54 which have tended to oppose any new movements in painting. ^We still
F34  55 have many such academic painters today, and they will continue; but
F34  56 gradually the British public is accepting the other kind*- those who
F34  57 feel that a painter's job is to abandon the task of representing
F34  58 nature in a literal, realistic way and to explore beyond the region of
F34  59 actual appearances.
F34  60    |^This breaking away from accepted standards in painting has
F34  61 usually been brought about by small groups of young painters who have
F34  62 shared the same ideals and given each other encouragement and help.
F34  63 ^These groups, as they have arisen one after another, have been
F34  64 regarded by most older painters as dangerous rebels and have been
F34  65 outcasts, excluded from all established groups such as the Royal
F34  66 Academy.
F34  67    |^However as time goes on they have managed to convert many of
F34  68 their fellow-artists and finally the general public to their new
F34  69 ideas, which have then lost their novelty and no longer appear so
F34  70 shocking and outrageous, but are finally regarded as quite traditional
F34  71 and old fashioned.
F34  72    |^These rebel painters by then will have grown old and their style
F34  73 may have come to be regarded as sufficiently respectable for them to
F34  74 be themselves elected to the Royal Academy and other societies which
F34  75 once rejected them. ^They then tend, in their turn, to oppose the
F34  76 newer groups whose ideas and methods are more modern still.
F34  77    |^Thus the old-established art societies, and particularly the
F34  78 Royal Academy, have been constantly rejecting and thwarting new groups
F34  79 of young rebels as they have come into being one after another. ^This
F34  80 has tended to lessen the prestige of the Royal Academy in the eyes,
F34  81 first of many painters, and eventually of the general public. ^It is
F34  82 still important and has great influence, but that influence is less
F34  83 than it once was. ^On the other hand various groups in turn, such as
F34  84 the New English Art Club, the Camden Town Group and the London Group,
F34  85 have organised exhibitions which have been more vigorous and exciting
F34  86 than the Academy itself and have often attracted more attention.
F34  87    |^Recently there have been a number of painters who could have
F34  88 become associates of the Royal Academy and finally academicians, but
F34  89 have preferred to remain outside, for they wanted to be regarded as
F34  90 advanced and unorthodox in their work and not to become associated
F34  91 with any society which might be considered old fashioned and
F34  92 hidebound.
F34  93    |^It is really rather surprising how well the Royal Academy has
F34  94 managed to adjust itself to changing styles and ideals in art,
F34  95 considering how it is organised. ^Painters, before they are elected as
F34  96 associates or academicians have nearly always been exhibiting for some
F34  97 years and are therefore no longer young men, so the {0A.R.A.}'s and
F34  98 {0R.A.}'s are, on the whole, middle-aged or elderly. ^At that age
F34  99 people tend to become somewhat set in their ways. ^What is remarkable
F34 100 is not so much that the Royal Academy should have remained distinctly
F34 101 academic, but that it should have shown so much tolerance as it has to
F34 102 the younger men.
F34 103    |^Since the days of the Impressionists the world of art has grown
F34 104 much smaller. ^Rapid communications have broken down the national
F34 105 barriers that previously gave painters in Britain a certain amount of
F34 106 isolation. ^Art has thus become much more international. ^Paris has
F34 107 continued as the focus-point of change in art. ^Here the new ideas
F34 108 have mostly originated, but they have spread much more quickly than in
F34 109 previous periods. ^In the past fifty years or so we have seen a number
F34 110 of *'isms**', following each other in quick succession*- *1Cubism,
F34 111 Futurism, Fauvism, Surrealism *0and others. ^These movements have
F34 112 mostly consisted in the exaggeration of some single factor in
F34 113 painting*- some factor that has been part of the stock-in-trade of
F34 114 painters from the first*- and enlarging this to become the whole. ^By
F34 115 discarding all the other factors, or most of them, this then becomes
F34 116 the sole interest of the painter.
F34 117    |^To take a single instance, Cubism consisted in the exaggeration
F34 118 of the geometric characteristics of natural forms. ^There have always
F34 119 been painters who enjoyed the squareness or roundness of things, and
F34 120 have tended in consequence to exaggerate the squareness of an elbow or
F34 121 a cliff edge and the roundness of a forehead or a hilltop at the
F34 122 expense of other aspects of objects. ^The Cubists took this to the
F34 123 limit, reducing every form to its simplest, geometric counterpart*-
F34 124 making human figures, trees, hills and everything else into
F34 125 arrangements of cubes, spheres and cylinders. ^Of course, in order to
F34 126 do this they had to deny themselves nearly every quality other than
F34 127 geometric forms; but that is the nature of an *'ism**' in art. ^Many
F34 128 British painters have been influenced by Cubism, among them Wyndham
F34 129 Lewis, Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth and William Roberts.
F34 130    |^Another characteristic of painting in recent times is the
F34 131 repeated turning back for inspiration to early or primitive artistic
F34 132 traditions. ^This is not just the kind of home sickness for simpler
F34 133 ways which we have seen already, among the Pre-Raphaelites for
F34 134 instance. ^No doubt this feeling enters into it, but there is more to
F34 135 it than that. ^It is part of a questing for new purpose and aim in
F34 136 art.
F34 137    |^Of course there are still many painters who are content to
F34 138 continue working in the academic way, developing new variations within
F34 139 the tradition of more or less descriptive painting. ^But there is a
F34 140 growing number who have become dissatisfied with this. ^They have come
F34 141 to feel that realistic painting has run its course and that the whole
F34 142 of that road has been thoroughly explored and no further progress is
F34 143 possible. ^There is no feeling of adventure for them in this field, no
F34 144 anticipation of new discovery, and without this a painter's work
F34 145 becomes unbearable drudgery. ^Unless he feels that he can improve, he
F34 146 must either give up or go back and start again on a new route.
F34 147    |^That is just what many painters have been doing in recent years.
F34 148 ^They cannot beat the camera at its own work and they cannot improve
F34 149 on the work of the great realistic painters before them, so they go
F34 150 back along the route of painting of the past in the hope of finding
F34 151 some side-track branching off, which will open up into a royal road to
F34 152 new achievements and exciting discoveries. ^So the modern painters
F34 153 have often taken the ancient Greeks or Mexicans, or perhaps the more
F34 154 recent carvers of West Africa, or the Fiji Islands as their
F34 155 inspiration, just as explorers in a strange land will employ local
F34 156 guides.
F34 157    |^After all, there have been artists in the world for nearly fifty
F34 158 thousand years, but painters have been working in the academic style
F34 159 for only about the last six hundred years, and most of that time in
F34 160 only one part of the world*- western Europe. ^This academic painting
F34 161 is a recent, very wonderful episode if we consider it against the
F34 162 whole of art history. ^It is like one short act in a long performance;
F34 163 and while painters in Europe have been perfecting their own tradition,
F34 164 there were many other artistic traditions, both past and present,
F34 165 about which they were very ignorant. ^All these alien styles were
F34 166 available to help them when they felt the need to make a new
F34 167 beginning.
F34 168    |^Some artists have found a new path in their work by abandoning
F34 169 subject-matter entirely. ^They have taken this much further than
F34 170 Whistler and the Impressionists did, and represent nothing in their
F34 171 pictures, employing only purely abstract shapes. ^Ben Nicholson is the
F34 172 best known of the British abstract painters.
F34 173    |^Many painters, in quite recent times, feel more and more out of
F34 174 tune with modern society. ^They feel that the world today belongs to
F34 175 science and machines and has no place for art*- that everywhere a
F34 176 falsely high value is placed on material things, and the mind and
F34 177 spirit of man is being neglected. ^Some of them, especially certain
F34 178 groups abroad, have expressed in their pictures the frustration and
F34 179 dissatisfaction which they feel. ^At times such painters have gone far
F34 180 beyond the satire of Hogarth and Rowlandson, and have held mankind up
F34 181 to derision in their canvases, depicting humanity as distorted by
F34 182 corruption and lunacy.
F34 183    |^As usual, these new movements have mostly been in existence for
F34 184 some time on the Continent before they reached Britain; and when they
F34 185 have been seen here it has often been only in a modified form. ^But a
F34 186 great deal of the art of today in this country has been affected by
F34 187 them.
F34 188    |^The recent tendency to turn away from realism in painting has
F34 189 been made easier because photography has now relieved painters of much
F34 190 of their previous task of recording facts and portraying people and
F34 191 places.

F35   2 *<*2TRADITIONAL CUSTOMS*>
F35   3    |^\*4Meistertrunk *0(Master Draught) and *4Shepherd's Dance,
F35   4 *0Rothenburg-on-Tauber, Sundays in June, July and August. ^The
F35   5 \Meistertrunk is the best known and most popular of the Bavarian
F35   6 history plays. ^And it takes place, of course, in perhaps the most
F35   7 picturesque medieval town in Germany. ^*"The Master Draught**" is
F35   8 based on chronicled events of the Thirty Years' War. ^When, in
F35   9 October, 1631, the Imperial Field Marshal Tilly brought his troops to
F35  10 the town, demanding its surrender, the citizens refused. ^However, at
F35  11 last they had to give in, and the conqueror decided the burgomaster
F35  12 and the councilmen should suffer the death penalty. ^Pleas from the
F35  13 women and children softened Tilly's heart somewhat. ^But good wine did
F35  14 more, for when he saw the magnificent state beaker he stated that if
F35  15 the burgomaster or one of the council could empty it at one draught
F35  16 all should live and the city be spared. ^Burgomaster Nush undertook
F35  17 the task, and emptied the beaker at one draught, thus saving everyone.
F35  18    |^This historical beaker is still used when the epic story is
F35  19 re-enacted to-day, although this scene is but one in a play in which
F35  20 the actors wear period costumes. ^The entire town is the stage, with
F35  21 the troop encampment outside the city walls, the children's plea with
F35  22 Tilly on the market square, and all the rest.
F35  23    |^In the afternoon of some days of the history play, the historical
F35  24 shepherds' dance is performed in the market square. ^It is danced in
F35  25 honour of \0St. Wolfgang, patron-saint of shepherds, and commemorates
F35  26 a member of the shepherds' guild who made a race from his pastures to
F35  27 the city to bring warning of the approach of an enemy. ^The troop
F35  28 encampment outside the city walls lasts until late, when camp fires
F35  29 and torch-light add to the romantic scene. ^On certain evenings during
F35  30 the summer, Hans Sachs plays are given in a local hall.
F35  31    |^\*4Kinderzeche *0(Children's Feast), Dinkelsbu"hl, July. ^This
F35  32 medieval town, not far from Rothenburg, also re-enacts an episode from
F35  33 the Thirty Years' War. ^When a Swedish colonel came with his troops to
F35  34 conquer the town, the burghers were split in their attitude. ^In
F35  35 perplexity the city fathers tried vainly to find a solution. ^Ruin and
F35  36 destruction seemed inevitable. ^It was then that a beautiful young
F35  37 girl, named Lore, accompanied by a crowd of small children, offered to
F35  38 go out to meet the Colonel and to beg pity for the town. ^But before
F35  39 the plan could be realised the Swedish troops had entered the city,
F35  40 ready to destroy it. ^At that moment, the song of children's voices
F35  41 sounded from afar, and then Lore appeared with her young band.
F35  42 ^Fearlessly she faced the conqueror, knelt and begged his mercy for
F35  43 the town and its people. ^The colonel's heart softened, and
F35  44 Dinkelsbu"hl was saved from destruction.
F35  45    |^The \Kinderzeche festival is first of all a children's event. ^It
F35  46 usually begins on the Saturday before the third Monday in July with
F35  47 beer sampling on the *"shooting meadows.**" ^The next morning the
F35  48 boys' band marches through the city in historical costumes, playing
F35  49 lustily. ^The festival play is performed in the ancient market hall.
F35  50 ^During the play period, the entire town is one great festival ground.
F35  51 ^There are processions, children's dances, concerts, guild and sword
F35  52 dances, and many other entertainments.
F35  53    |^Hamelin is mainly familiar to us through the legend of the
F35  54 \*4Rattenfa"nger *0(Rat-catcher), related in Browning's poem. ^The
F35  55 event is celebrated each Sunday in summer when the story is re-enacted
F35  56 by a piper and boys, the latter disguised as mice. ^Unfortunately,
F35  57 modern research tends to discredit the legend, claiming that what
F35  58 really happened was a visit from a labour agent who attracted many
F35  59 local young men away to Bohemia, with the promise of good wages.
F35  60    |^*4The Princely Wedding, *0Landshut, every two or three years
F35  61 (usually on three Sundays in June and July). ^This is one of the most
F35  62 colourful events in Europe. ^It is a re-enactment of a gorgeous
F35  63 wedding which took place in 1745 when Ludwig the Rich married his son,
F35  64 Duke George, to Hedwiga of the Royal House of Poland. ^In addition to
F35  65 a festive procession, the houses of this medieval town are beautifully
F35  66 decorated for the occasion, and nearly a thousand *"burghers,**"
F35  67 dressed in the rich costumes of the Middle Ages, strut around and
F35  68 bring those opulent days back to life for a short while. ^I say
F35  69 *"opulent,**" for it is officially recorded that at the feasting which
F35  70 followed the actual wedding, 333 oxen, 275 fat pigs, 40 calves, and
F35  71 12,000 geese were eaten.
F35  72    |^\*4Tanzel-Festival, *0Kaufbeuren, July. ^This is another
F35  73 outstanding costume festival held in a small town lying between
F35  74 Augsburg and Fu"ssen. ^It celebrates an old custom dating back to
F35  75 1497, and begins with the enactment of an historic scene, when the
F35  76 burgomaster with his councillors receives King Conradin who, on
F35  77 horseback and accompanied by his knights and bishops, appears at the
F35  78 door of the town hall. ^The festival's climax, however, is the great
F35  79 procession through the town, with heralds, flower-girls, drummers, the
F35  80 King, the city council and their ladies, lansquenets in plus-fours,
F35  81 followed by the guilds and their state carriages, among them weavers,
F35  82 brewers, tanners and blacksmiths. ^Archers appear, flag-wavers,
F35  83 medievally-clad soldiers and yellow mail coaches with postillions
F35  84 industriously blowing their horns. ^There are many bands, while
F35  85 perhaps the most beautiful features of the festival are the 800
F35  86 children, dressed in historic costumes.
F35  87    |^*4Anno 1634, *0No"rdlingen, during summer months. ^This is the
F35  88 most southerly of the three medieval towns lying on the *"Romantic
F35  89 Road,**" and it still retains its fortress wall with 18 towers. ^The
F35  90 Daniel Tower of its fine \0St. George's Church still sees a unique
F35  91 nightly ceremony, for at nine each night a watchman at its summit
F35  92 cries to another on the ground that *"All's well.**" ^The play
F35  93 re-enacts various events in the Thirty Years' War. ^There are dances
F35  94 in period costumes, concerts and other entertainments. ^The town's
F35  95 populace form the cast for the play, and the streets offer a
F35  96 fascinating picture, resembling indeed a medieval master's painting.
F35  97    |^*4Spearing the Dragon, *0Fu"rth-im-Wald. ^For 500 years this town
F35  98 in the Bayerischer Wald has performed an exciting open-air play (every
F35  99 second Sunday in August), called *"\Drachenstich**" (spearing the
F35 100 dragon). ^It is based, obviously, on some pagan legend. ^Performed in
F35 101 the market square, the play has as its climax the killing of the
F35 102 dragon (50 \0ft. long, 10 \0ft. high, and weighing over a ton) by a
F35 103 knight on horseback who pierces the monster's head by thrusting his
F35 104 spear into it through the throat. ^The hero must be careful, however,
F35 105 not to miss a pig's bladder filled with ox blood, so the wounded
F35 106 animal can spout blood. ^The dragon looks comically gruesome when it
F35 107 spouts fire, rolls the eyes, shows its giant teeth, wiggles its large
F35 108 blood-red tongue and twists its huge body. ^With the \Drachenstich, of
F35 109 course, go merrymaking and various festivities, including a grand
F35 110 procession through the streets.
F35 111    |^Fu"rth-im-Wald is also the scene of a Leonhardi Ride*- a
F35 112 religious festival really, and it takes place on Easter Monday. ^Other
F35 113 Leonhardi Rides in Bavaria are usually held on November 6th, the
F35 114 saint's day.
F35 115    |^*4Trenck, the Pandur, *0Waldmu"nchen (July to August). ^This
F35 116 open-air play performed after dark is notable for its excellent
F35 117 artistic management and the highly realistic acting. ^Among the
F35 118 players are many direct descendants of the characters they represent
F35 119 in the play. ^The story is about the capture, sack and burning of the
F35 120 town by a notorious leader of Hungarian Pandur bands in the year 1742.
F35 121 ^The nightly troop encampment scenes, wild riding, and especially the
F35 122 storming of the town with scaling ladders, torches and burning pitch,
F35 123 are exciting and exceedingly well done.
F35 124    |^{*4Ulmer Fischerstechen}, *0Ulm, first Monday in August on the
F35 125 Danube. ^According to old tradition, two boats approach with the
F35 126 participants in old costumes, and try and joust each other into the
F35 127 water with lances. ^The *"sport**" was already popular in the 16th
F35 128 century when Kaiser Karl *=5 and his son, later King Philip *=2 of
F35 129 Spain, allowed it in 1549. ^This {*1Turnier auf dem Wasser}
F35 130 *0(tournament on the water) was played in the old Ulm days when it was
F35 131 a free city and the game took place between youngsters of the
F35 132 fishermen's guild. ^It is today performed as a pageant, and is also
F35 133 popular in other countries.
F35 134    |^*4Potters' Festival, *0Passau, first Saturday in August. ^The
F35 135 products of the potters of the Ilz section of this three-river city
F35 136 have long been famous. ^Although their great boom period is no more,
F35 137 the Ilz *"\Haferl Festival**" (pottery festival) is still celebrated
F35 138 with great enthusiasm. ^All the buildings in town and the moated
F35 139 castle, Niederhaus, are specially illuminated, dance music is played
F35 140 in the open, there are open-air performances, water games, boat
F35 141 racing, and a pageant. ^The climax is a large scale illumination of
F35 142 the town and Oberhaus fortress and the old section of Passau. ^There
F35 143 is a splendid display of fireworks; and one seems wafted to a night in
F35 144 Venice.
F35 145    |^*4Folk Festival, *0Nuremburg, usually in August. ^Founded in
F35 146 1826, this festival is rather similar to the better-known \Oktoberfest
F35 147 of Munich. ^There are the great beer tents, representative shows,
F35 148 entertainments and other attractions. ^On the Friday before the first
F35 149 festival Sunday the chief burgomaster empties the first *"mass**"
F35 150 (about one quart) in the course of a grand beer sampling ceremony.
F35 151 ^Crowds pour into the city from the surrounding Bavarian towns and
F35 152 villages, and there is a joyous atmosphere of wit and good humour*-
F35 153 two strong characteristics of the citizens.
F35 154    |^*4Teenagers' Festival, *0Worms, first week in September. ^This is
F35 155 one of the most amusing festivals in Germany. ^Among the events are
F35 156 the historical coachmen's dance, a hilarious fishermen's jousting
F35 157 tournament on the Rhine, fought from small boats, a parade of
F35 158 illuminated vessels, and a giant firework display. ^Huge wine and beer
F35 159 tents, holding thousands of visitors, as well as numerous booths are
F35 160 to be found in the fair grounds beside the river's bank.
F35 161    |^*4The {Tura Michele,} *0Augsburg. ^Since 1526, a group of
F35 162 figures representing the archangel Michael with the Devil at his feet

F35 164 ^On \0St. Michael's Day, September 29th, the angel appears every hour
F35 165 on the hour, and with each sound of the hour stabs the struggling
F35 166 Devil. ^During the last war the historical figure was destroyed, but a

F35 171 ancient custom the \*1almabtrieb*- *0driving the cattle home from the
F35 172 mountains*- is the occasion of a great autumn festival in the Bavarian
F35 173 Alps. ^In a festive procession the cattle, wreathed and garlanded,
F35 174 stamp down the hills, the dairy maid out front and the shepherd boy
F35 175 following the herd. ^Particularly pretty is the driving-down of the
F35 176 cows from the pastures above Lake Ko"nigssee near Berchtesgaden, where
F35 177 the cattle are carried across the lake by boat.

F35 181 months, these clubs hold costume festivals.
F35 182    |^One of the outstanding examples is the *4Annual Pageant *0in
F35 183 Munich in October. ^The most beautiful native costumes from all over
F35 184 the country are on parade there, to the accompaniment of bands, also
F35 185 in native garb. ^These costume days and festivals are real folk
F35 186 events, complete with field mass, extended processions, honour dances,

F35 190 has been observed for centuries by the peasants' *"Leonhardi Ride**"
F35 191 to church in which well-groomed, beautifully harnessed horses draw
F35 192 richly decorated wagons. ^While many villages have clung to this
F35 193 ancient custom, no Leonhardi Ride has become so famous as the one of
F35 194 To"lz in the Isar river bend. ^The preparations take weeks, and from

F36   3 *<*5by Francis Dickie*>
F36   4    |^*6F*2IFTY YEARS AGO, *0the Canadian Eskimo, scattered across half
F36   5 a million square miles of the Arctic, from the Atlantic seaboard to
F36   6 the Bering Sea on the Pacific, was a primitive race. ^Now, Canada's
F36   7 Department of Northern Affairs is publishing the first magazine
F36   8 entirely in the Canadian Eskimo tongue ever produced.
F36   9    |^Remembering that it is only fifty years since a syllabic written
F36  10 version of the Canadian Eskimo language was created by missionaries,
F36  11 the production now of an all-Eskimo magazine, in two separate
F36  12 dialects, is truly an amazing step forward. ^For, it must be
F36  13 remembered, fifty years ago the Canadian Eskimo was still a stone-age
F36  14 people. ^The fact that the different tribes were so widely scattered
F36  15 over such an enormous territory, and were constantly on the move in
F36  16 pursuit of sea and land animals and fish, made the missionary's
F36  17 teaching of the syllabics slower and more difficult.
F36  18    |
F36  19    |^*6T*2HIS FIRST MAGAZINE *0is, therefore, a triumph: until its
F36  20 appearance, the use of syllabics was confined to letters, brief
F36  21 messages, and the Bible. ^In future, across the vast reaches of the
F36  22 Arctic, almost the entire population will for the first time be able
F36  23 to read their language in a modern magazine.
F36  24    |^Canada's first Eskimo magazine editor is Mary Panegoosho, born at
F36  25 Pond Inlet in 1939. ^The eldest of nine children, she had three
F36  26 brothers and five sisters. ^Mary went to work as a nurse's assistant
F36  27 at Hamilton, Ontario, Mountain Sanatorium at fifteen. ^She has been
F36  28 with the Department of Northern Affairs for a year and three months.
F36  29    |^The magazine she edits is published in three editions:
F36  30 *1*'\Inuktitut**' *0in the eastern Arctic dialect and in syllabics,
F36  31 *1*'\Inuktitun**' *0in the western Arctic dialect in Roman characters,
F36  32 and a third edition in English. ^Both, of course, mean *'The Eskimo
F36  33 Way.**'
F36  34    |^The first issue of the magazine was greeted with great enthusiasm
F36  35 by the Eskimos. ^Reluctant as they always are to show even their best
F36  36 work, such as carving, it was most gratifying that some contributions
F36  37 were sent in for the second issue.
F36  38    |^The editorial team is made up of Eskimo members of the Eskimology
F36  39 Section of the Northern Welfare Service. ^The total number of copies
F36  40 printed in Eskimo is three thousand five hundred*- one for each Eskimo
F36  41 family. ^About two thousand are printed in the eastern Arctic dialect,
F36  42 fifteen hundred in the western. ^These circulation figures are more or
F36  43 less fixed and may only increase slowly as the Eskimo population
F36  44 itself grows.
F36  45    |^The publication of the magazine is only one part of the many
F36  46 functions of the Eskimology Section. ^The Section's primary concern is
F36  47 assisting the welfare programme and providing consultative services,
F36  48 translating letters from Eskimos, \0etc. ^In so far as the demands of
F36  49 the main functions will allow, therefore, the magazine will be
F36  50 published every four months or so.
F36  51    |
F36  52    |^*6T*2HE CANADIAN ESKIMO *0scarcely knew of any written language
F36  53 until the \0Rev. Edmund \0J. Peck, {0D.D.}, an Anglican missionary,
F36  54 adapted a system of syllabics to the Eskimo tongue. ^The syllabic
F36  55 system, in which sounds are represented by little hooks and crooks
F36  56 resembling shorthand, was first devised by the \0Rev. James Evans a
F36  57 hundred years ago for use with the Cree Indians.
F36  58    |^The typewriter used is a Remington Rand, which looks like any
F36  59 other typewriter except that it is fitted with syllabic Eskimo
F36  60 letters. ^It was designed about ten years ago by the late Leo Manning,
F36  61 an Eskimo linguist with this Department. ^Besides the usual keys for
F36  62 shift and lock, back spacing, margin release, \0etc., it has forty-six
F36  63 keys.
F36  64    |^The first number of the magazine includes an Eskimo's account of
F36  65 the previous year's goodwill mission to Greenland, some Eskimo
F36  66 folk-tales sent in by people from Igloolik, a story of a hunting
F36  67 adventure by a man who was a sanatorium patient not long ago, and
F36  68 numerous other articles. ^There is also a children's page. ^There are
F36  69 excellent illustrations drawn by Eskimos, including the magazine's
F36  70 editor, Miss Mary Panegoosho, who also designed the cover.
F36  71    |
F36  72    |^*6T*2HERE IS ONE SLIGHT DEFECT *0in the syllabic system so long
F36  73 in use in Canada: that is that the Eskimos here are the only ones who
F36  74 use it. ^This prevents them at present from sharing in reading the
F36  75 literature of the same race from Greenland and Labrador because in
F36  76 those lands this syllabic system is not used.
F36  77    |^A development in the present Eskimo written tongue is now being
F36  78 considered, by means of which all Eskimo, including those in Greenland
F36  79 and Labrador, who use a different system of writing, could read the
F36  80 same literature.
F36  81    |^However, for the present, this first Canadian Eskimo magazine is
F36  82 a wonderful accomplishment. ^To the continuing of it, the Department
F36  83 of Northern Affairs is sparing no effort or expense. ^And, by
F36  84 airplane, boat and dog-team, across a half million square miles, this
F36  85 Quarterly reaches 3,500 non-paying subscribers, in a land of seven
F36  86 months winter*- the most widely scattered people in the world ever to
F36  87 receive a modern magazine in their own tongue!
F36  88 *<*4Eskimo Arts and Crafts*>
F36  89 *<*5by Dawn MacLeod*>
F36  90    |^*6H*2AVE YOU EVER WONDERED *0how Eskimos pass the time during
F36  91 their long Arctic winter night? ^As children we were told that the
F36  92 women sewed skins together for clothing, the men made or repaired
F36  93 dog-traces and fishing tackle, and the children ate, slept, and played
F36  94 what games they could in the confined space inside their ice-hut or
F36  95 igloo. ^But since I came to Canada I have discovered that the Eskimo
F36  96 does not spend all his time in utilitarian pursuits.
F36  97    |^Among the Canadian Eskimos there are sculptors and artists with a
F36  98 high degree of good taste and skill, who take delight in creating
F36  99 things of beauty. ^Their small stone carvings, carefully wrapped in
F36 100 soft skin for safe storage, are brought out and handed round when
F36 101 friends visit them; their pictures adorn the walls of the home.
F36 102    |^The recently formed Department of Northern Affairs, which takes a
F36 103 fatherly interest in the welfare of nine or ten thousand Eskimos
F36 104 living on Canadian territory, has been organising exhibitions of their
F36 105 work in most of the larger cities, and a scheme has been set up under
F36 106 which supplies for sale to the public are being made available to
F36 107 selected shops.
F36 108    |^A little carving in stone of a mother and child was accepted by
F36 109 {0H.M.} the Queen during her visit to the Dominion, and the man who
F36 110 carved it, Munamee of Baffin Island, takes immense pride in the
F36 111 knowledge that his work has gone to Buckingham Palace. ^The Eskimo
F36 112 never duplicates his figures, but other examples of this artist's
F36 113 skill are being snapped up by tourists and collectors.
F36 114    |
F36 115    |^*6T*2HE TRADITIONAL CRAFTS *0of Eskimos are stone carving by the
F36 116 men and leather applique*?2 work by the women, with the addition of
F36 117 basketry in parts of the eastern Arctic where coarse grasses grow.
F36 118 ^This is similar in technique to the coiled basket-work made popular
F36 119 by the Navaho Indians.
F36 120    |^The carving of small figures and animals by the Eskimo men
F36 121 probably developed from their formerly essential skill in whittling
F36 122 down stone to make adzes, reamers and crude saws*- the only tools they
F36 123 had until white traders brought steel and other metals to the Arctic
F36 124 regions.
F36 125    |^Leather applique*?2 by the women originally had a purely
F36 126 functional application, for the narrow bands of sealskin in
F36 127 contrasting tones were used to strengthen garments at points of
F36 128 greatest wear. ^Gradually these applique*?2 clothes developed into
F36 129 things of beauty, and the Eskimo wife could earn respect for herself
F36 130 and her family by outstanding skill at the craft.
F36 131    |^Eskimo women, as well as men, have now found time to fashion
F36 132 things solely for pleasure, and their art takes the form of
F36 133 applique*?2 skin pictures. ^Some of these are rich in invention and
F36 134 full of action. ^The designs*- mostly human figures, dog teams, and
F36 135 wild creatures of the Arctic*- are visualised and then cut out direct
F36 136 from the skin without any preliminary drawing, and are usually in
F36 137 dark-toned leather sewn to backgrounds of bleached caribou hide or
F36 138 sealskin.
F36 139    |^Sometimes the shapes of tools in daily use about the home are
F36 140 employed as motifs, and it is believed that such designs have some
F36 141 magical significance; but the artists, who have every right to keep
F36 142 their secrets inviolate if they choose, do not seem disposed to
F36 143 explain the meaning of these conceptions. ^Possibly some of us would
F36 144 be equally reluctant to tell an audience of Eskimos just why we throw
F36 145 a pinch of spilled salt over our shoulder, or take care to avoid
F36 146 walking under a ladder.
F36 147    |
F36 148    |^*6T*2HE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS *0in the arts of the Eskimo have
F36 149 come, oddly enough, by way of Japan. ^A Canadian artist who is
F36 150 attached to the Department of Northern Affairs was sent to the Far
F36 151 East to study the Japanese technique of colour-printing from wood
F36 152 blocks, and he thought that this craft might well be adapted to the
F36 153 Eskimo's natural material*- that is, the fairly soft talcs, grey-green
F36 154 waxy steatite or *'soap-stone,**' and what is locally known as
F36 155 *'pipe-stone**': the latter not to be confused with the
F36 156 russet-coloured Missouri clay, catlinite, which was used by the Red
F36 157 Indian for his sacred pipe of peace.
F36 158    |^When the artist returned to his base, at Cape Dorset on the south
F36 159 coast of Baffin Island, he demonstrated the methods of the Japanese
F36 160 wood-block printers, and immediately these were seized upon by
F36 161 delighted Eskimo craftsmen and adapted to their own material and
F36 162 ideas.
F36 163    |^Bold designs of birds and beasts were cut on stone blocks and
F36 164 printed in two or three colours on the special rice-paper brought from
F36 165 Japan. ^The traditional leather work of the women was also brought
F36 166 into use for a method of printing: the skins were cut to form
F36 167 stencils, and paint or ink was forced through the apertures on to a
F36 168 sheet of paper.
F36 169    |^The usual Eskimo pigments, two colours only, consist of a rich
F36 170 black made from the glutinous residue found at the bottom of seal-oil
F36 171 lamps, and a brownish-red obtained from local deposits of iron rust.
F36 172 ^Both pigments are reduced with seal oil to a suitable brushing
F36 173 consistency. ^To give the print-makers a fuller palette, other paints
F36 174 have now been imported, and the Eskimo artists are enjoying the use of
F36 175 blue for the first time in their history. ^One famous craftsman and
F36 176 hunter, Niviaksiak, made a dramatic stencilled design of a polar bear
F36 177 and her cub emerging from a steely-blue hole in the ice.
F36 178 ^Unfortunately this gifted artist was killed while on a seal-hunt soon
F36 179 afterwards.
F36 180    |
F36 181    |^*6T*2HE ESKIMOS, *0like the crofter folk in the Hebridean
F36 182 islands, are no longer content to live entirely upon the produce of
F36 183 their land and sea. ^Hudson Bay posts carry stocks of manufactured
F36 184 goods which the Eskimo families find highly desirable*- such as
F36 185 woollen duffle cloth for light summer clothing in place of the heavier
F36 186 skin garments. ^But hitherto the only produce they have been able to
F36 187 trade for goods has been the white fox pelt, and the catch fluctuates
F36 188 to such an extent*- from 4,000 skins in a good season to 200 in a bad
F36 189 one*- that the income from this source has always been precarious.
F36 190    |^The Government scheme to export and sell Eskimo carvings and
F36 191 prints is therefore of some importance in the economy of the people.
F36 192 ^At present it affects a comparatively small group in the Cape Dorset
F36 193 area, but it will probably spread to other communities.
F36 194    |^As the Eskimo artists are self-critical, and their work is being
F36 195 fostered with knowledge and sympathy, it is not in any danger of
F36 196 becoming vulgarised by commercial exploitation. ^Their traditional
F36 197 dislike of repetition has been linked to the newly introduced printing
F36 198 techniques, for only ten or twelve impressions are taken from each set
F36 199 of blocks or stencils before these are destroyed. ^As a result of this
F36 200 wise limitation, the supply of Eskimo pictures will not flood the
F36 201 market. ^Already demands are coming in from private collectors and
F36 202 galleries all over the world, and it is known that \0*2UNICEF *0plans
F36 203 to issue an Arctic design as a Christmas card next year.
F36 204    |
F36 205    |^*6C*2ARIBOU, MUSK-OX, *0polar bear, snow-goose, walrus and seal*-
F36 206 all the familiar life around them is studied and reproduced by the
F36 207 Eskimo hunters with keenness of observation and economy of line.

F37   2 *<*6MAY SONGS OF BEDFORDSHIRE*>
F37   3 *<BY {0F. B.} HAMER*>
F37   4    |^*0The village blacksmith of Harrold, a well known character, gave
F37   5 me the May carol he used to sing, with his parents and family, round
F37   6 the village, including the numerous country houses of that
F37   7 neighbourhood. ^The tune was the same as that published by Lucy
F37   8 Broadwood in her *1Traditional Songs and Carols, *0and, except for
F37   9 some transposition of verses and the addition of a wish for a joyful
F37  10 May, it was the same song. ^Years later, after I had come across other
F37  11 versions of the song, I discovered why. ^\0Mr. Crouch, the blacksmith,
F37  12 as a child, had been in the party that gave the song to Sir Ernest
F37  13 Clarke at Hinwick Hall in the first decade of the century, and it was
F37  14 Sir Ernest who had sent it to Lucy Broadwood.
F37  15    |^It was the Church family of Biddenham who first brought home to
F37  16 me the fact that there were other versions of this carol still known,
F37  17 and sometimes still sung, in Bedfordshire. ^\0Mrs. \0E. Church gave
F37  18 me the one she used to sing in Kimbolton and the villages on the
F37  19 Bedfordshire border with Huntingdonshire. ^Her father-in-law, Walter
F37  20 *'Paddy**' Church, told me that when he was a boy in Bromham (\0*1c.
F37  21 *01880) the custom was for the young men to gather thorn branches the
F37  22 night before May Day, and these they planted in front of the door of
F37  23 all the unmarried women of the village. ^During May Day morning they
F37  24 went round again, this time to collect their reward in the form of
F37  25 money and sometimes beer or food. ^They sang on each of these
F37  26 perambulations, using the same tune, but having two sets of words.
F37  27 **[SONG**]
F37  28    |^I have since found that this was the custom at other places in
F37  29 the county. ^At Keysoe the bushes were graded according to the degree
F37  30 of eligibility of the lady, and the unwanted spinster had a briar bush
F37  31 instead. ^At Wrestlingworth it appears to have been a male custom too,
F37  32 and Northill, with its magnificent maypole and unique records of
F37  33 sixteenth-century May games, boasted a more elaborate ceremony. ^They
F37  34 had a set of *'Moggies**' attending the May Bush cart on its journey.
F37  35 ^The mayers or *'Moggies**', usually about eight or ten young men,
F37  36 carried tall, beribboned staves like tutti poles and had as leaders a
F37  37 *'lord**' and *'lady**', and included a shabbily dressed, black-faced
F37  38 man and *'woman**', carrying besoms*- these last the *'Moggies**' who
F37  39 gave their name to the whole party. ^Elstow too had its *'moggies**'
F37  40 and its own song before these were submerged in the present-day
F37  41 Whitelands-sponsored Ruskinade with its miniature pole and the full
F37  42 Queen-of-the-May ceremony.
F37  43    |^The more usual custom is for children, usually girls only, to
F37  44 take round a decorated garland made of a flower-decked hoop or double
F37  45 hoop with a doll dressed in white suspended in the centre. ^Sometimes
F37  46 a pram or chair, carrying a doll and decorated with flowers, takes the
F37  47 place of the hoops. ^The song is usually shorter than the full Harrold
F37  48 version and often contains only a verse or two about the branch or
F37  49 garland of May and the \*1que*?5te *0verses. ^The Eaton Bray song is
F37  50 an example.
F37  51 **[SONG**]
F37  52    |^In the north of the county another tune appears, sometimes in the
F37  53 same village as the more usual one. ^It is used by children with a
F37  54 garland. ^Here are two versions of it.
F37  55 **[SONGS**]
F37  56    |^I have not attempted a systematic survey of the county. ^The
F37  57 examples I have came to me almost by chance, which accounts for the
F37  58 fact that there are extensive gaps in the south. ^I count it a very
F37  59 fortunate chance which brought me the very lovely song sung in
F37  60 Buckworth (\0Hunts.) and the northern borders of Bedfordshire. ^Here
F37  61 it is as given to me by \0Mrs. Johnstone who now lives in Bedford.
F37  62 **[SONG**]
F37  63 *<*6SOME ADDITIONAL MAY SONGS FROM THE EAST MIDLANDS*>
F37  64    |^*2THE FOREGOING *0are only a few of \0Mr. Hamer's extensive
F37  65 collection of May Songs from Bedfordshire and the neighbouring
F37  66 counties. ^He has, however, kindly consented to some further examples
F37  67 from other collections being appended to his article.
F37  68    |^\0Mrs. Ruth Craufurd of Aldbury, near Tring, has recently
F37  69 contributed to the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library seven versions
F37  70 from the south-west of Hertfordshire. ^Two of these, representing the
F37  71 two distinct types which she has found in this restricted area, are
F37  72 here reproduced.
F37  73 **[SONGS**]
F37  74    |^The Aldbury melody is very close to that of the King's Langley,
F37  75 \0Herts., May Day song *'The Moon shines bright**' ({0L. E.}
F37  76 Broadwood, *1English County Songs, \0*0p. 108). ^The Marsworth song
F37  77 may be compared with \0Mr. Hamer's North Bedfordshire versions.
F37  78    |^\0Mrs. Craufurd writes:
F37  79 **[BEGIN QUOTE**]
F37  80    |^One of the interesting comparisons between these two neighbouring
F37  81 May songs is the complete difference in both airs and words. ^Although
F37  82 Marsworth is barely five miles from Aldbury, villages were almost
F37  83 isolated from each other in the days before cars and bicycles and had
F37  84 only a market town in common, so that they lived in a little world of
F37  85 their own.
F37  86 **[END QUOTE**]
F37  87    |^Another point of interest is the money asked. ^Aldbury, a village
F37  88 with a great house and a rich parsonage, asks for *'a little
F37  89 silver**', but Marsworth, a poor marshland village, only hopes for a
F37  90 ha'penny. ^Marsworth also makes an interesting reference to the Tring
F37  91 Chimney Sweeps who *'come \2a-dancing all May-day**', which refers to
F37  92 the Jack-in-the-Green, the May Garland in the far-off days of the
F37  93 little climbing boys and in still further off days when the dancer in
F37  94 it represented the spirit of vegetation visiting each house to bring
F37  95 fertility in the coming year.
F37  96    |^Miss Beattie Burch, one of the Aldbury Mayers from whom I got the
F37  97 song, told me: ^*'We used to get up at six in the morning on May Day
F37  98 and make our garlands, and then go with them to the bigger houses and
F37  99 farms before school**'. ^If they resisted the temptation to play
F37 100 truant from school on May Day they were rewarded the following
F37 101 Saturday by a Festivity which consisted in *'a procession round the
F37 102 pond, ending up at the Rectory or Stocks (the great house) where we
F37 103 were each given a bun and a penny**'. ^Their garlands were often *'a
F37 104 little doll with a wreath of flowers in her hair, sitting in a child's
F37 105 arm-chair decorated with ribbons and flowers and curtained all round
F37 106 so that only those who gave us money could see the May Doll when we
F37 107 pulled the curtains back for them**'.
F37 108    |^These and other local versions of the May song are now sung
F37 109 annually at the Aldbury Women's Institute May Festival held on
F37 110 Whit-Saturday.
F37 111    |
F37 112    |^The following examples from the Editor's collection represent,
F37 113 firstly, the version generally current in the south of
F37 114 Northamptonshire and the adjacent part of Buckinghamshire and,
F37 115 secondly, the *'night song**' from Gravely on the
F37 116 Cambridgeshire-Huntingdonshire border.
F37 117 **[SONG**]
F37 118    |^A very similar version of the May song used to be current in the
F37 119 nearby villages, such as Deanshanger and Wicken (\0Northants.). ^The
F37 120 May Garlanding by the children of Leckhampstead is not
F37 121 school-sponsored and was kept up regularly on May 1 at least until
F37 122 1954. ^The children told me that they did not go out in 1955 because
F37 123 May 1 was a Sunday. ^There used to be three separate parties, each
F37 124 with a garland, but there was then only one consisting of about five
F37 125 girls from eight to eleven years of age. ^The substitution of ~*'Good
F37 126 evening**' for the usual ~*'Good morning**' in verse 1 resulted from
F37 127 the closing of the village school, since when the children go to
F37 128 Buckingham and no longer have a holiday on May Day. ^Except on a
F37 129 Saturday the garlanding has therefore to be postponed until after
F37 130 school.
F37 131 **[SONG**]
F37 132    |^At Gravely the custom was that a party of four or five men*- one
F37 133 with an accordion*- went round the village about midnight on May Day
F37 134 eve with branches of may cut from the hedges. ^At each house where
F37 135 they sang the song they left a branch (*'May Bush**'), and money was
F37 136 then thrown down from the bedroom windows; but people who were
F37 137 disliked were left a briar*- a briar indicated a liar, said \0Mrs.
F37 138 Howlett*- and those of bad moral character were left a branch of
F37 139 elder, or hemlock and stinging nettle. ^Thus the full implication of
F37 140 the first verse becomes apparent.
F37 141    |^It will be noticed that, in contrast to \0Mr. Hamer's Bromham
F37 142 example, there was here no second visiting and that verses of the
F37 143 night and day songs have been combined. ^\0Mrs. Howlett, however,
F37 144 mentioned that her mother made very good May garlands with a doll hung
F37 145 inside, so it would appear that the day-time May Garlanding was also
F37 146 carried on at Gravely. ^The Gravely melody is related to the twice
F37 147 noted Fowlmere, \0Cambs., version ({0L. E.} Broadwood, \0*1J. Folk

F37 154    |^The main purpose of these additional notes is to indicate the
F37 155 need for a detailed survey of the various May Song tunes and their

F37 162 *<*6THE INTERNATIONAL FOLK MUSIC COUNCIL*>
F37 163    |^*2THE FOURTEENTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE *0of the International Folk
F37 164 Music Council was held in the Universite*?2 Laval in Quebec from
F37 165 August 28 to September 3, 1961.
F37 166    |^The Conference was organized by a special Canadian Committee
F37 167 which included the University and the Canadian Folk Music Society.
F37 168 ^The leading spirit in this enterprise was \0Dr. Marius Barbeau, the
F37 169 President of the Society and the grand old man of French-Canadian and
F37 170 Red Indian folk music, known throughout the world from the work done
F37 171 when he was attached to the National Museum in Ottawa.
F37 172    |^This Conference attracted musicians, folk-lorists and dancers
F37 173 from all over the world, with a particularly strong contingent from
F37 174 the United States. ^It met in the mornings and afternoons and the
F37 175 Members were entertained in various ways during the evenings with
F37 176 concerts and performances. ^There was an opportunity for one excursion
F37 177 to the Indian reservation in Lorette, where a programme of Huron and
F37 178 Iroquois ceremonies was given under \0Dr. Barbeau's direction.
F37 179    |^The University of Laval is itself a strong centre of
F37 180 French-Canadian folk-lore and the members of the Conference were
F37 181 fortunate in having this opportunity to have the folk-lore section
F37 182 with its archives explained to them by Professor Luc Lacourcie*?3re
F37 183 and his colleagues.
F37 184    |^Hospitality was generous throughout the period of the Conference,
F37 185 culminating in a Canadian supper in the old part of the University in
F37 186 the heart of the City of Quebec. ^The daily sessions were held in a
F37 187 building in the new University some four or five miles out of the
F37 188 city, where new buildings are springing up on an extensive campus
F37 189 which only a short time ago was virgin forest. ^The Conference had all
F37 190 the modern facilities at its disposal and as there was little else to
F37 191 distract the attention the sessions were very well attended.
F37 192    |^From the musical point of view the contemporary work of \0Dr.
F37 193 Charles Seeger and \0Mr. Alan Lomax, each making use of modern
F37 194 technical equipment, posed the most challenging questions. ^\0Dr.
F37 195 Seeger's Melograph, capable of analysing melodic structure in great
F37 196 detail, opened a good many eyes to the fluidity of folk music and
F37 197 revealed how incomplete was the conventional picture of folk music
F37 198 depending on a few modes derived from the pentatonic scale. ^Alan
F37 199 Lomax, using another type of scientific instrument, provided graphs of
F37 200 vocal technique from which he deduced a number of factors each
F37 201 affecting singing *'style**' which he described as a
F37 202 *'self-perpetuating culture trait**'. ^He argued that there were three
F37 203 or four main styles which had coalesced in America shaping singing
F37 204 habits and influencing the preservation of traditional pieces and the
F37 205 choice of new material.

F38   2 *<*2THE POMERANIAN BREAM*>
F38   3    |^*0This fish is not, as its scientific name ({*1Abramis
F38   4 buggenhagii}*0) implies, and as was once believed, a separate bream
F38   5 species. ^It cannot even claim the distinction of being a bream
F38   6 *"variety**" or *"breed**". ^It is simply a hybrid between the common
F38   7 bream and the roach. ^It is occasioned by the similarities in habits
F38   8 and spawning of both species. ^Both bream and roach spawn communally
F38   9 at about the same time of year, and both seek similar weedy shallows.
F38  10 ^Occasionally it happens that a shoal of one kind is spawning
F38  11 simultaneously alongside a shoal of the other. ^Eggs deposited on the
F38  12 fringes of each group where the two species would tend to intermingle
F38  13 are obviously fertilised by milt from fishes of the other group. ^In
F38  14 this way the hybrid *"pomeranian bream**", as it is popularly known,
F38  15 is produced.
F38  16    |^The hybrid is itself infertile, but it is still a very common
F38  17 fish in waters where roach and bream occur together in large numbers
F38  18 and it is not merely confined to lakes and ponds but is commonly found
F38  19 in rivers also. ^The fish is silvery in colour, with perhaps a bluish
F38  20 tint. ^Not quite plump enough to be a bream, yet deep enough in the
F38  21 belly to look like a really splendid grandfather roach, its typically
F38  22 forked, bream-like tail should indicate its parentage, as also should
F38  23 its obvious sliminess.
F38  24    |^But this fish often attains a weight of over two pounds and it is
F38  25 probably more easily mistaken for a roach than anything else. ^Often
F38  26 it is hailed by the excited angler as an exceptionally good specimen
F38  27 roach, and entered for a club contest or prize.
F38  28    |^For similar reasons to those already given the bream also
F38  29 hybridises with the rudd in waters where these two species are common.
F38  30 ^The resulting progeny are easily mistaken for very fine rudd and,
F38  31 less often, for stunted bream. ^It is perfectly natural that an angler
F38  32 should prefer to believe he has taken a fine rudd rather than a poor
F38  33 bream, and like the roach x bream hybrid, this fish is probably
F38  34 responsible for innumerable false record or *"specimen fish**" claims.
F38  35 ^Whilst this kind of wishful thinking is understandable, it is
F38  36 nevertheless easily avoidable. ^Both hybrids may be quite definitely
F38  37 identified as imposters by fin ray and scale counts.... ^Furthermore,
F38  38 *1only one check is likely to be necessary. ^*0The anal fin ray count
F38  39 is almost always decisive in distinguishing such hybrids from both
F38  40 parents, and if only anglers would bother to undertake this, there
F38  41 would be far fewer false record claims, and fewer disappointed anglers
F38  42 as a result, for these imposters are always recognised by any club
F38  43 steward of any experience who cares to undertake the count needed.
F38  44    |^Roach possess 9-12 branched rays in the anal fin. ^Bream possess
F38  45 23-29, and rudd 10-13. ^The roach x bream hybrid has 15-19, which
F38  46 establishes quite clearly that it can be neither roach nor bream! ^The
F38  47 rudd x bream hybrid has 15-18 which again establishes that it cannot
F38  48 be bream or rudd. ^Table 3 gives fuller details of the differences
F38  49 between these fish and their parents, and should suffice to identify
F38  50 any bream hybrid likely to be found.
F38  51    |^Records indicate that rarely the smaller silver bream hybridises
F38  52 with roach and rudd. ^Such hybrids are most uncommon and unlikely to
F38  53 be met. ^Both are small fishes seldom exceeding ten inches, and
F38  54 therefore unlikely to be the cause of false record claims. ^Both may
F38  55 be distinguished by the anal fin, and details of these unusual and
F38  56 even rare hybrids may be found in Table 3.
F38  57    |^Strangely enough there are no records in Britain of hybridisation
F38  58 between the two bream species. ^This seems curious when we consider
F38  59 the close relationship between the silver and bronzed breams.
F38  60 ^Possibly such hybrids occur, but have not been recognised. ^Owing to
F38  61 the degree of overlapping which occurs in scale and fin ray counts
F38  62 between the two species, it would be almost impossible to detect such
F38  63 a hybrid by external means although examination of the pharyngeal
F38  64 teeth and gill rakers would certainly identify this fish if it *1were
F38  65 *0found.
F38  66 *<*6THE BLEAK. {*5Alburnus alburnus}. *0(Linnaeus.)*>
F38  67 *<{*1Alburnus lucidus.} *0(Day.)*>
F38  68 *<*2DESCRIPTION*>
F38  69    |^*0The back is blue-green, or grey-green, and in bright sunshine
F38  70 it appears predominantly green. ^The flanks are pale green with
F38  71 iridescent tints, fading to a silvery white on the underside. ^The
F38  72 iridescence of the scales gives the flanks a golden green colour in
F38  73 sunny weather when the fish is ashore, and in duller weather the white
F38  74 or silver aspects predominate.
F38  75 **[FIG.**]
F38  76 ^The belly is compressed to a ridge between the ventral fins and as
F38  77 far as the anal fin; the anal fin is long, and grey. ^The other fins
F38  78 are sometimes tinted with pink.
F38  79    |^The body is spindle-shaped and lightly compressed laterally. ^The
F38  80 head is small, with the mouth superior, and strongly oblique. ^The
F38  81 upper body surface is lightly curved and the abdomen more so. ^The
F38  82 scales are very lightly attached to the body, coming off at any
F38  83 careless handling. ^The ventral fins are set in front of the level of
F38  84 the dorsal fin, and the pectoral fins are situated close to the gill
F38  85 covers, about half-way between the lateral line and the abdomen.
F38  86    |^These cheerful sparkling little fish swim in the same category as
F38  87 the bream by virtue of their long anal fin, but they rarely share the
F38  88 same *"swim**", being utterly different in habit. ^They are common
F38  89 fish in many rivers and the strolling observer can hardly fail to
F38  90 notice them, especially as they prefer to live amongst the surface
F38  91 layers of water. ^They are often to be seen within inches of the bank,
F38  92 too, darting after floating crusts which are soon broken in smaller
F38  93 pieces by the attentions of the shoal. ^Often the bleak are seen
F38  94 leaping and scattering across the surface, alarming other fishes as
F38  95 they flash silver when the pike or prowling perch leaps amongst them
F38  96 in search of a meal. ^More often than not the bleak causes the dainty
F38  97 rises and splashes which continually dimple the surface, yet despite
F38  98 their timidity, bleak will swim nosing the feet of the small boy
F38  99 paddling in the shallows provided he avoids undue noise and violent
F38 100 movement. ^In almost any weather bleak are to be found close to the
F38 101 surface, ever ready to amuse the passing walker, or sample the
F38 102 angler's bait.
F38 103    |^Yet bleak are not much sought after by anglers because they are
F38 104 small and take a bait too readily. ^In match fishing, however, they
F38 105 *1are *0popular, putting a premium on speed and skill at striking the
F38 106 swift tiny bites rather than on water-lore and angling craft. ^Many a
F38 107 match champion owes his laurels to his ability to strike the swift
F38 108 bites at a faster rate than his companions.
F38 109    |^Other anglers regard the bleak as a bait for pike or perch, but
F38 110 most often when the pike are on feed; striking terror amongst the
F38 111 shallows, the bleak, showing considerable discretion for so small a
F38 112 fish, are nowhere to be found. ^Only the small boy, angling perhaps
F38 113 with a string and stick amongst the brooks off the main stream, knows
F38 114 where they have gone.
F38 115    |^Like the minnow, bleak are very important food fish for other
F38 116 river creatures. ^These most useful members of the river community
F38 117 provide meals for predatory fish and river birds. ^Not only the
F38 118 regular river-haunting birds, but even the seagulls
F38 119 **[FIGURES**]
F38 120 seeking inland during bad weather know where to look for a feed. ^The
F38 121 angler's wife, too, knows that a dish of bleak is not to be despised.
F38 122 ^Well cooked they are tastier than sprats, which they somewhat
F38 123 resemble in appearance.
F38 124    |^Bleak were once very much sought after for the iridescent
F38 125 colouring of their scales. ^The artificial pearl industry thrived on
F38 126 the colours of the otherwise insignificant bleak. ^Like so many other
F38 127 creatures they were slaughtered in large numbers to satisfy the
F38 128 vanities of the human female.
F38 129    |^In some waters such as the Thames bleak are so abundant as to be
F38 130 considered a nuisance by various angling bodies. ^Efforts to check the
F38 131 bleak population have been made from time to time by several such
F38 132 groups. ^Possibly it is as well that these efforts have met with
F38 133 little success. ^Although abundant, bleak are delicate fish, and so
F38 134 long as they are capable of surviving in the Thames, so long does this
F38 135 indicate a fair standard of purity in the water.
F38 136    |^Bleak are not found in Scotland, West Wales, Ireland or the Lake
F38 137 District. ^Elsewhere in the British Isles they are very common. ^As
F38 138 aquarium fishes they would probably be welcomed for their attractive
F38 139 colours; unfortunately they are extremely difficult to keep alive
F38 140 under artificial conditions, and indeed they seldom survive the
F38 141 journey home in a bait can.
F38 142    |^Bleak are recorded as having hybridised naturally with chub and
F38 143 roach. ^These hybrids are recognised by their long anal fins, and also
F38 144 by a compressed ridge along the abdomen between the ventral fins and
F38 145 the anal fin (Tate-Regan). ^They are not at all common, and are well
F38 146 worth reporting when taken. ^Please send such fishes where they may be
F38 147 properly examined. ^Only when a large number have been handled by
F38 148 competent authorities will a full knowledge of them become available.
F38 149 ^Details of what is at present known are given in Table 4.

F38 152 *<*6THE ALLIS SHAD. {*5Alosa alosa}. *0(Linnaeus)*>
F38 153 *<{*1Clupea alosa}. *0(Day.)*>
F38 154 *<*2DESCRIPTION*>
F38 155    |^*0The back is blue-green, green-brown, or intermediate, with
F38 156 golden flashes on the head, and tints of yellow. ^The flanks are of a
F38 157 pale olive colour which shades to silver or bluish-white on the
F38 158 underside. ^A single oval dark spot lies on the upper flank close to
F38 159 the gill cover. ^In younger fish there may be several such spots, and
F38 160 in older specimens these may disappear entirely. ^The scales are
F38 161 iridescent and flash golden or yellow in sunlight.
F38 162    |^The body is strongly compressed laterally and the abdomen is
F38 163 keeled, with the edges of the scales giving a serrated edge to the
F38 164 keel. ^The lateral line is not visible externally.
F38 165    |^The mouth is large, slightly oblique, sometimes with fine
F38 166 bristle-like teeth. ^The snout is blunt and the lower jaw projects
F38 167 slightly giving the fish a pugnacious appearance. ^The eyes are quite
F38 168 distinctive in being hooded at the front and trailing edges by a
F38 169 semi-transparent membrane.
F38 170    |^To see this powerful fish leaping over the netsman's obstructions
F38 171 you could hardly confuse it with the dull and lethargic bream
F38 172 described earlier, despite the suggestion of similarity in body shape.
F38 173 ^There is in fact no relationship and the shads are typical members of
F38 174 the herring family and, like the herring, they are really marine in
F38 175 habit, entering the province of the freshwater angler and observer
F38 176 only when they migrate upstream to spawn in the river.
F38 177    |^Although the Allis shad is rapidly becoming less common in
F38 178 Britain, it was once plentiful in innumerable large rivers and
F38 179 estuaries such as the Thames which, like so many others, is now denied
F38 180 to the incoming fish by industrial pollution.
F38 181    |^On the Wye and Severn, however, there are still flourishing
F38 182 commercial shad fisheries, and nets take many thousands of the clean
F38 183 fish each season. ^The *"run**" commences between March and June and
F38 184 then the estuarial reaches are crowded by the professional netsmen.
F38 185 ^The actual approach of the first shads is still mysteriously heralded
F38 186 by the arrival of sandpipers which are in fact locally called *"shad
F38 187 birds**".
F38 188    |^A primitive kind of shrimping net is used by many fishermen
F38 189 **[FIGURES**]
F38 190 and great skill is required to capture these swift leaping fish which
F38 191 average about three pounds apiece. ^Fortunately for those who depend
F38 192 upon the shads for a living, the fish follow similar routes year after
F38 193 year, and experienced fishermen know just where to set their obstacles
F38 194 to direct the oncoming fish towards their nets.
F38 195    |^Those which escape (and many thousands do) continue their journey
F38 196 upstream undaunted until they arrive amongst the shallower
F38 197 less-frequented streams where they spawn with considerable fuss and
F38 198 splashing. ^The eggs are simply left unburied and the spent fish
F38 199 commence their return journey. ^The newly hatched fish remain in fresh
F38 200 water only until four or five inches long, and then they too enter the
F38 201 sea where growth to maturity is rapid.

F39   2 *<*6DUMMY BOARD FIGURES*>
F39   3 *<*0By *2MICHAEL CONWAY*>
F39   4    |^*6D*2UMMY *0boards shaped as life-size figures were decorative
F39   5 and amusing accessories in the Georgian house and in the garden too.
F39   6 ^Cut from wood and painted, they vividly, even startlingly, resembled
F39   7 richly attired men and women, colourful birds and domestic animals.
F39   8 ^Good-looking housemaids gave life to dreary passages (Plate 172A);
F39   9 the entrance hall might shelter a shepherd and shepherdess, sometimes
F39  10 with sheep; romping children might hide an empty fireplace (Plate
F39  11 171D.)
F39  12    |^Dummy board figures appeared in England during the 1660s as fire
F39  13 screens: a silhouette of a man or woman might be cut from thick, heavy
F39  14 wood and painted so that he appeared in a naturalistic attitude before
F39  15 the fireplace. ^The artists were usually second-rate portrait
F39  16 painters. ^The earliest record of such a painted figure is engraved in
F39  17 the frontispiece to the \1*1Compleat Gamester *0(1674), where a dummy
F39  18 board fashionably stands erect before the fire, feet wide apart, with
F39  19 a drinking glass held in his hand, screening a company of card players
F39  20 from the heat of the blaze.
F39  21    |^The Georgian dummy board figure was designed for ornament only
F39  22 and was made from much thinner wood. ^A projecting ledge extending
F39  23 from shoulder to shoulder at the back kept it 6 inches from the wall
F39  24 and was attached to it by means of a pair of wrought-iron hooks and
F39  25 staples. ^This position and the figure's feather edges caused a
F39  26 life-like shadow to be thrown against the wall and secured a
F39  27 three-dimensional effect. ^Careful placement was essential, for the
F39  28 figure might be painted full face or three-quarter face*- rarely in
F39  29 profile. ^In an alcove, such as at a stair bend, the dummy board was
F39  30 secured into an erect position by means of a pair of wooden supports
F39  31 cut in the shape of shoes projecting four or five inches to the front,
F39  32 and with heels projecting to the rear. ^Holes in existing examples
F39  33 show them to have been screwed down from the heels.
F39  34    |^These colourful figures added interest to early Georgian homes,
F39  35 and in the days of George *=3 stocks of those painted by sign-board
F39  36 artists were displayed by the innumerable Mayfair furnishing stores.
F39  37 ^Regency dummy boards lacked the colourful elegance of earlier work,
F39  38 but Victorians reverted to Georgian styles, in greater brilliance and
F39  39 with some carving in relief.
F39  40 *<*6GLOSSARY*>
F39  41    |^*4Animals and birds: *0rooms might be decorated with dummy board
F39  42 figures of tabby cats. ^An early Victorian series of cats was covered
F39  43 with black velvet instead of paint, and large amber beads were used
F39  44 for eyes. ^Friendly dogs were popular for the parlour, and
F39  45 fierce-looking animals for the entrance hall, apparently ready to fly
F39  46 at any unauthorized intruder. ^Brightly painted parrots and macaws
F39  47 perched high in the room appeared very realistic to the visitor below.
F39  48 ^Deer, sheep and pigs might stand in well-selected outdoor positions.
F39  49    |^*4Artists: *0until the 1760s professional portrait painters
F39  50 decorated the majority of dummy board pictures. ^Their work is
F39  51 recognized by life-like poses and vivacious expressions. ^Many
F39  52 specimens appear to have been portraits. ^Then came a statute making
F39  53 it illegal to suspend sign-boards over the highway, and the great
F39  54 trade in sign-board painting was ended. ^Dummy board pictures were
F39  55 thereupon painted by shop sign decorators who for the most part worked
F39  56 in Harp Alley, Shoe Lane, London. ^The existence of identical dummy
F39  57 board figures cut from a master template and painted with similar
F39  58 figures illustrates the change to a style of work approaching mass
F39  59 production.
F39  60    |^*4Boards: *0the wooden boards upon which images were painted were
F39  61 at first in oak or pitch pine. ^In the eighteenth century beech,
F39  62 pearwood and mahogany were alternatives. ^Those intended for outdoor
F39  63 use were cut from 1-inch teak which neither warped nor shrank under
F39  64 the stress of changing weather conditions. ^Outlines for dummy board
F39  65 figures were cut from single boards measuring about 2 feet wide. ^From
F39  66 the 1770s thickness was halved. ^For comparison it may be noted that
F39  67 late eighteenth-century tables ({0*1q.v.}*0) measuring 3 to 4 feet
F39  68 in height were between 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch in thickness. ^The planks
F39  69 on most seventeenth- and eighteenth-century dummy boards have shrunk a
F39  70 little, revealing vertical tongue-and-groove joints.
F39  71    |^*4Canvas covered: *0because the built-up boards tended to open
F39  72 with shrinkage of the wood some dummy boards were covered with
F39  73 painter's canvas, the fabric glued to the feather-edged board. ^The
F39  74 back might be covered with canvas also and painted brown.
F39  75    |^*4Elizabeth *=1 costume: *0dummy boards painted in elaborate
F39  76 Elizabethan attire were popular with early Georgians and again in the
F39  77 mid-nineteenth century. ^The early series was almost invariably
F39  78 painted by portraitists, possibly adapted from engravings as minor
F39  79 accessories were correctly depicted. ^The face might be that of the
F39  80 purchaser or a member of his family.
F39  81    |^*4Feather edges: *0the wide, sharply cut bevelling surrounding
F39  82 the rear edge of the profile at an acute angle. ^This gave a clear and
F39  83 life-like effect to the shadow thrown upon the wall.
F39  84    |^*4Fireboards: *0these date between the 1750s and the 1790s. ^They
F39  85 measure 3 to 4 feet in height and enlivened hearth interiors during
F39  86 summer months when the burnished steel portable grate, fender and
F39  87 fire-irons were oiled and laid away until autumn. ^The chimney was
F39  88 closed and the hearth recess cleaned of its soot and made colourful
F39  89 with massive ornaments, such as lidded urns in porcelain, huge jars
F39  90 displaying flowers and foliage, or terrestrial globes. ^Dummy board
F39  91 representations of these might be used, particularly vases of flowers.
F39  92 ^Alternatively the entire fireplace opening might be masked by a
F39  93 fireboard painted with an urn overflowing with flowers. ^As yet
F39  94 another alternative small figures might be used, such as matching
F39  95 pairs of costumed boys and girls, the boys often riding stick
F39  96 hobby-horses. ^A board of this kind might stand upon a plinth of
F39  97 mahogany or gilded beech, plain or elaborately carved, but usually the
F39  98 lower edge was set into a heavy block of oak about 5 inches thick
F39  99 which might be carved or japanned in red.
F39 100    |^*4Fire screens: *0dummy board pictures were originally designed
F39 101 for this purpose: stout, heavy articles measuring up to 6 feet in
F39 102 height and cut from 1 1/2 inch oak or pitch pine, feather edged, set
F39 103 in weighty blocks enabling them to stand upright without assistance.
F39 104 ^The heat of the fire must have warped the woods, the table joints
F39 105 opened, and the oil paint flaked away.
F39 106    |^*4Highlanders: *0kilted Scotsmen were produced in large numbers
F39 107 to stand as trade signs outside the doors of tobacco and snuff shops.
F39 108    |^*4Lady at her toilet: *0this series appears to be the work of a
F39 109 single Georgian artist. ^They wear early seventeenth-century dress,
F39 110 including the period's enveloping white apron bordered with lace, and
F39 111 hold hand mirror and brush to dress their waist-long hair. (Plate
F39 112 171A.)
F39 113    |^*4Outdoor figures: *0life-size figures so painted and arranged
F39 114 that visitors unexpectedly confronted with them were startled into
F39 115 believing that they were living realities. ^Red-coated soldiers stood
F39 116 on guard in mansion porches, on hotel stairs, in tea gardens and
F39 117 pleasure grounds and at tavern doorways; sailors standing, or dancing
F39 118 the horn pipe, were favourites in the gardens of waterside taverns.
F39 119 ^Country innkeepers favoured dummies of jugs and glasses, or dishes of
F39 120 onions, radishes, bread and cheese. ^Pedlars and women hawkers were
F39 121 favourite outdoor figures early in the nineteenth century.
F39 122    |^*4Painting: *0the artists drew his outline upon a smooth-surfaced
F39 123 board of seasoned wood. ^At first each was individually designed, but
F39 124 from the 1760s templates might be used. ^The table was then sawn to
F39 125 shape and the edges sharply bevelled. ^Two or three washes of boiling
F39 126 linseed oil were then applied, followed by a rubbing down with
F39 127 distemper or powdered white lead mixed with parchment paste. ^The
F39 128 colours were painted over this, the distemper soaking up excess oil
F39 129 and thus increasing the brilliance of the paint. ^This radiance when
F39 130 new was enhanced on fine work by burnishing, particularly of the gold
F39 131 and reds. ^The final result was protected with varnish. ^Unless it can
F39 132 be seen that this process was used, a board should be looked upon with
F39 133 suspicion.
F39 134    |^*4Regency: *0by the nineteenth century dummy board figures had
F39 135 become less showy, typical examples including women hawkers, ballad
F39 136 singers, pedlars, organ grinders with monkeys and, later, knights in
F39 137 armour. (Plate 172B.)
F39 138    |^*4Reproductions: *0these were made in the mid-Victorian period
F39 139 and again in the 1920s and 1930s, the latter often costume portraits
F39 140 copied from well-known paintings and standing with the aid of hinged
F39 141 brackets as on an easel. ^These modern dummies have a so-called
F39 142 *'antique finish**' to simulate age.
F39 143    |^*4Soldiers: *0these were depicted in the uniform worn by
F39 144 Grenadiers of the Second Regiment of Foot during the reign of George
F39 145 *=1. ^An eighteenth-century engraving of the interior of the Old
F39 146 Chelsea Bun House illustrates a pair of Grenadiers and an equestrian
F39 147 dummy board, displayed on brackets above the doorway, each throwing a
F39 148 shadow on the wall. ^Pairs consisting of a Grenadier and a housemaid
F39 149 have been recorded. ^These soldiers are about 7 feet high with
F39 150 mitre-shaped hats about 18 inches high. ^They are always found with
F39 151 their feet 18 inches apart, then the attitude of attention: the
F39 152 *'heels together**' position dates from the time of the Prussian
F39 153 influence on the English army in the 1750s. ^A variety of red-coated

F39 155 them in the *'stand at ease**' position.

F39 171 shown holding soft brooms, the long bristles bound to a round stock
F39 172 with three ornamental turned knops above. ^They represent ladies of
F39 173 the house laudably domesticated rather than housemaids. ^Because of
F39 174 their dress such dummy boards have been attributed to the 1630s. ^A
F39 175 more reasonable attribution is to the second half of the eighteenth
F39 176 century, dress having been copied from early Stuart sources (Plate

F40   2 *<*6THE WORLD OF SCIENCE.*>
F40   3 *<ANIMALS' DEAF EARS.*>
F40   4 *<*4By *6MAURICE BURTON, *4{0D.Sc.}*>
F40   5    |^*6I*2T *0is some years ago since I first became interested in the
F40   6 possible effect of modern noises on animals. ^I started with the
F40   7 assumption that if animals had more sensitive ears than mine, or were
F40   8 as allergic, as I am, to the sounds of traffic on the roads, there
F40   9 should be a noticeable tendency for them to shun the borders of roads.
F40  10 ^It soon became apparent that this was not so, and this conclusion is
F40  11 reinforced by the abundance of hares on London Airport. ^There, people
F40  12 put their hands over their ears as the jet-planes go out, but the
F40  13 hares are to all appearances unmoved, which is contrary to what might
F40  14 have been expected.
F40  15    |^During the course of my study of this problem several striking
F40  16 points emerged. ^The first is that although the ears of animals are
F40  17 often more acute than ours, and their powers of discrimination seem to
F40  18 be higher, they also appear to be less bothered than we are by a
F40  19 cacophony.
F40  20    |^There is constantly passing through the human brain a stream of
F40  21 impulses we call thoughts. ^These are closely linked to everyday life,
F40  22 are built upon experience, and our experiences are based largely on
F40  23 sensations received through the senses, one of which is hearing.
F40  24 ^These experiences are continually being added to because everything
F40  25 that impinges on our senses is meaningful. ^For example, while writing
F40  26 these last three sentences I have heard a number of sounds, each of
F40  27 which has set up a train of thought in my mind. ^The church clock
F40  28 striking the hour reminds me that I must hurry if this is to be ready
F40  29 on time for the printer. ^It reminds me also, once again, that yet
F40  30 another hour has gone on the inexorable road to eternity. ^These are
F40  31 two ideas that could never enter an animal's head on hearing the sound
F40  32 of a clock.
F40  33    |^Within the space of these few seconds, also, there has been the
F40  34 sound of a telephone bell, of a distant motor-bicycle and of a dog
F40  35 barking. ^Each has been a minor distraction. ^The telephone made me
F40  36 wonder whether I need drop this task to answer the call and with it
F40  37 came a tangle of thoughts that at 11.30 I must not fail to telephone
F40  38 so-and-so, that the telephone is a nuisance but what could we do
F40  39 without it, and others of like nature. ^The distant motor-cycle caused
F40  40 me to give a momentary reflection on the calamity of road accidents.
F40  41 ^The barking dog made me pause to find out if it was one of my own
F40  42 dogs barking, and if so for what reason.
F40  43    |^By contrast with our continual alertness to noises and their
F40  44 meaning it is possible at times so to lose oneself in preoccupation as
F40  45 to be oblivious to outside sounds. ^Then, a sudden noise may recall us
F40  46 with a mild or even a violent shock. ^So throughout our waking hours
F40  47 we tend to alternate between an awareness of every small sound and the
F40  48 danger of shock, mild or otherwise, through not having been aware of
F40  49 them.
F40  50    |^Whatever views we may hold about how far the higher animals are
F40  51 able to think or to reason, there can hardly be any doubt that they
F40  52 are not affected by sounds in the same way as we are. ^They are not
F40  53 distracted by trivial sounds and are unlikely to be off-guard as a
F40  54 result of being lost in their thoughts. ^The best way to test this is
F40  55 by direct observation. ^In this we can employ indicators such as the
F40  56 way the ears are used as well as the animal's moments of alertness,
F40  57 usually with a tensing of the muscles. ^It then soon becomes apparent
F40  58 that an animal normally pays little attention to sounds that are not a
F40  59 cause for alarm, an indication of a source of food or made by a member
F40  60 of its own species.
F40  61    |^Where the air is free of sounds made by machinery it may be
F40  62 filled with those made by birds, insects, rustling leaves and other
F40  63 natural sounds. ^It can be alive with them, yet so far as we can tell
F40  64 an animal ignores them all unless one or other of them has a special
F40  65 significance. ^It will, however, immediately react to any alarm note
F40  66 or a note of aggression. ^To put it another way round, it seems to be
F40  67 able to shut its ears to noise in general yet remain on the alert for
F40  68 particular sounds which by tradition or experience compel its
F40  69 reaction. ^We also possess this faculty, although some have it more
F40  70 than others, but it seems likely that animals can, and habitually do,
F40  71 exploit it more than men, largely because their world of experience
F40  72 makes fewer demands on their senses.
F40  73    |^Some animals have a pronounced ability to turn a deaf ear. ^This
F40  74 is difficult to test in a wild animal because the mere presence of the
F40  75 human observer, however well hidden, tends to threaten its security
F40  76 and put it on the alert. ^Domesticated animals, whose security is
F40  77 assured, often provide outstanding examples of it. ^Dogs and donkeys
F40  78 can appear to be stone-deaf, ignoring all words of command or
F40  79 entreaty, all persuasive or cajoling sounds, but responding instantly
F40  80 to even a slight noise suggestive of something pleasurable. ^A dog may
F40  81 lie as if in a trance, apparently unhearing, yet spring to action at
F40  82 the slight metallic sound of its lead being taken from a hook or the
F40  83 faintly whispered word *"walk.**"
F40  84    |^There is a category of sounds, however, to which all the higher
F40  85 animals at least react violently. ^These are the explosive sounds. ^A
F40  86 car backfiring will send the city pigeons flying. ^One theory has it
F40  87 that because they are descended from rock doves there is a survival
F40  88 value in this innate reaction because it would have made them fly up
F40  89 at the sound of a fall of cliff that might otherwise engulf them. ^The
F40  90 theory has many weaknesses. ^One is that many kinds of birds will
F40  91 react in the same way. ^In fact, it seems reasonable to say that the
F40  92 explosive sound creates alarm among most animals with ears. ^There may
F40  93 be exceptions, as among fishes or frogs, but it seems to be a rule
F40  94 among birds and mammals. ^It probably created alarm among human beings
F40  95 also before ever gunpowder or \0*2TNT *0were invented*- the word
F40  96 *"explode,**" in fact, antedates their invention, and in modern but
F40  97 pre-nuclear warfare the wear on the nerves from explosives was
F40  98 probably more telling than the casualties inflicted by the exploding
F40  99 missiles.
F40 100    |^It is not possible to deal in more than the broadest generalities
F40 101 about animals' reactions to sounds because hearing varies widely from
F40 102 one species to another, as does the structure of the ear. ^So far as
F40 103 the explosive sound is concerned there are some animals that use it
F40 104 themselves. ^A dog may use a particularly explosive bark to another
F40 105 dog under certain circumstances, and the effect of this can be almost
F40 106 as devastating as the bursting of a modern projectile on the human ear
F40 107 or the report of a rifle on a flock of pigeons.
F40 108    |^It is necessary, to avoid confusing the issue, to ignore some of
F40 109 the extreme examples of deleterious sounds, those that make telephone
F40 110 operators faint or the jingling of a bunch of keys that sends a mouse
F40 111 into something approaching hysterics. ^What is at least as interesting
F40 112 is the way inventors seem to have chosen, probably intuitively, a
F40 113 combination of explosive and aggressive sounds as warning signals to
F40 114 be used on automobiles. ^Apart from the purely explosive sounds, those
F40 115 that stir most animals to rapid action are the snarls, growls, barks
F40 116 or long drawn-out roars of predators or rivals. ^A representative
F40 117 series of sounds made by motor-horns would approximate fairly closely
F40 118 to the aggressive or warning sounds made by wild beasts.
F40 119    |^One important factor in the toleration of noise is familiarity.
F40 120 ^Our Victorian ancestors probably found the noises from horse traffic
F40 121 insufferable at times and at an earlier age it may be that the cry of
F40 122 the night-watchman was held to be a necessary but excruciating
F40 123 nuisance. ^Each generation seems to be able to bear the noises it
F40 124 grows up with and to abominate the additional noises that appear
F40 125 later. ^Generations of hares succeed each other with far greater
F40 126 rapidity than generations of humans, and the hares of London Airport
F40 127 have probably by now accepted the noise of jet-planes as part of their
F40 128 environment. ^They have, moreover, one great advantage over us, and
F40 129 this is probably one of the reasons why mammals in general can put up
F40 130 with the noise of traffic on the roads. ^Those that have movable ears
F40 131 can not only turn them in the right direction to pick up slight or
F40 132 distant sounds, they can also turn them away from disagreeable
F40 133 sounds*- and I have seen them do so.

F40 135 *<COYPU AND PEST-CONTROL.*>
F40 136 *<*4By *6MAURICE BURTON, *4{0D.Sc.}*>
F40 137    |^*6T*2HE *0coypu is one of the animals introduced into this
F40 138 country whose residence here we are beginning to regret. ^It is a
F40 139 large South American rodent, rat-like although its nearest relatives
F40 140 are the porcupines, measuring over a yard long to the tip of the tail
F40 141 and weighing up to 20 \0lb. ^Originally brought here about 1930 to be
F40 142 farmed for their fur, which is known as nutria, the coypu began to
F40 143 escape and are now well established in the countryside, notably in
F40 144 East Anglia and especially on the Norfolk Broads. ^At first it was
F40 145 believed they did not constitute a nuisance but opinion has now turned
F40 146 against them. ^Last week it was reported that the suggestion had been
F40 147 put forward to use the coypu to combat another nuisance.
F40 148    |^The Kariba Lake, formed when the Kariba dam was completed, has
F40 149 become infested with a water plant, one that grows at an alarming rate
F40 150 and threatens to damage the special intakes at the dam. ^The menace
F40 151 from the plant is serious enough to merit almost any suggestion aimed
F40 152 at controlling it, and this one, put forward by \0Mr. George Atkinson
F40 153 of Lowestoft, is brilliant in its simplicity. ^It is that some of the
F40 154 coypu in East Anglia, estimated at a quarter of a million, should be
F40 155 trapped and exported to Kariba Lake to feed on the menacing weed.
F40 156 ^Were such a plan to be shown to be successful it would contain the
F40 157 perfect form of biological control, using one nuisance to combat
F40 158 another.
F40 159    |^Throughout the world animals and plants have been transported,
F40 160 either accidentally or deliberately, from one continent to another.
F40 161 ^In some the results have been beneficial, in a few they have been
F40 162 harmless but in far too many they have been disastrous, so that to-day
F40 163 one looks at any further plan to introduce animals into an alien
F40 164 environment with caution if not deep suspicion. ^The first question
F40 165 one needs to ask is whether the coypu would eat this particular weed
F40 166 and in sufficient quantity to counterbalance its own remarkable powers
F40 167 of multiplication.
F40 168    |^The most obvious comment to make is that there are remarkably few
F40 169 animals, outside the insects, that feed exclusively on one item of
F40 170 diet. ^The koala feeds on nothing but eucalyptus leaves and is always
F40 171 quoted as a striking and exceptional example of an animal with a
F40 172 restricted diet. ^Most animals like variety in their food, and this is
F40 173 especially true of rodents. ^It is highly important, therefore to know
F40 174 something of the diet of the coypu.
F40 175    |^There are, on my shelves, a score of authoritative works on
F40 176 mammals, and it is noteworthy that although they all contain at least
F40 177 one reference to the coypu most of them make no mention at all of its
F40 178 diet. ^A few state that its food is green vegetation, or just
F40 179 *"vegetation,**" or say that it feeds on water plants. ^For our
F40 180 present purpose none of these is satisfactory. ^Water plants range
F40 181 from the wholly aquatic, like water lilies, and such plants are
F40 182 usually soft, to waterside plants which are usually tough and fibrous.

F41   2    |^*0Thus it is clear that the predominant organization,
F41   3 particularly in the distribution of manufactured goods, is the
F41   4 wholesale merchant who carries stocks. ^In some trades*- {0*1e.g.},
F41   5 *0hardware*- he is known as a factor. ^Besides owning and warehousing
F41   6 the goods, the wholesaler may process them in some way. ^This is
F41   7 chiefly the case with agricultural products. ^A tea merchant blends
F41   8 and packets tea; a seeds merchant cleans and sorts seeds obtained from
F41   9 growers. ^Not all intermediaries (whether merchants or agents)
F41  10 actually handle the merchandise in which they deal; they may merely
F41  11 provide a link between a source of supply and the demand for it.
F41  12    |^The performance of the wholesale merchant's true functions (which
F41  13 may include such services to retailers as communications, selection,
F41  14 stockholding, credit facilities, and transportation) requires a heavy
F41  15 capital outlay. ^Only by operating on a large scale can the large
F41  16 overhead costs be absorbed in the turnover, so as to produce a
F41  17 reasonable net profit. ^Consequently it is not surprising that the
F41  18 1950 Census showed that over four-fifths of the trade of merchants was
F41  19 handled by wholesalers each with an annual turnover of over *+100,000.
F41  20    |^Though in discussing wholesalers we generally assume that the
F41  21 function will be carried out by a single firm, this need not be so.
F41  22 ^The task may be split up between two or even more intermediaries. ^In
F41  23 some trades, particularly horticultural products and fish, a system of
F41  24 primary and secondary wholesalers often exists. ^The former is
F41  25 essentially a collecting organization, though he may also process,
F41  26 grade, or pack before reselling in bulk to the secondary wholesaler,
F41  27 who performs all the other services normally associated with
F41  28 wholesaling.
F41  29    |^It is convenient to classify wholesale merchants, according to
F41  30 the extent of the sales territory covered by the business. ^Thus many
F41  31 of the larger firms are national wholesalers, distributing goods to
F41  32 every part of the country. ^They carry large stocks, and often have
F41  33 their own brands, and operate a comprehensive delivery service over a
F41  34 wide area. ^A second class covers only specific parts or regions of
F41  35 the country*- perhaps Northern England or Scotland. ^The local
F41  36 wholesaler confines his custom to a much smaller area*- often a radius
F41  37 of a few miles from his warehouse. ^The local and regional wholesalers
F41  38 usually offer a more restricted service as compared with the national
F41  39 wholesaler. ^Some wholesalers have a number of branches or stock-rooms
F41  40 up and down the country.
F41  41 *<*4General and Specialist Wholesalers*>
F41  42    |^*0Wholesalers may also be classified according to the range of
F41  43 stock carried. ^Though generally they specialize in one group of
F41  44 commodities, there is considerable variation in the extent of this
F41  45 specialization.
F41  46    |^Perhaps the most important section of the wholesale trade, both
F41  47 in terms of numbers of firms and turnover, is that of the general
F41  48 wholesalers. ^They are analogous to department stores, as there are a
F41  49 number of departments (frequently twenty to twenty-five) selling a
F41  50 wide range of rather unrelated commodities, with an extensive choice
F41  51 within each commodity group. ^Such firms may employ five hundred or
F41  52 more *'inside staff**' and up to one hundred travellers. ^Most general
F41  53 wholesalers occupy large buildings in the central areas of cities, and
F41  54 also normally have branches or stock-rooms strategically situated in
F41  55 other large towns. ^The main attraction of the general wholesaler is,
F41  56 of course, the ability to bring together for the convenience of the
F41  57 retailer a wide range of merchandise under one roof.
F41  58    |^For a number of years the general house has tended to concentrate
F41  59 attention on a related group of commodities. ^When this specialization
F41  60 is carried a stage farther the wholesaler becomes a specialist house.
F41  61 ^The term, in fact, may imply anything from a wholesaler carrying one
F41  62 commodity group to one with several hundred, the emphasis being on the
F41  63 similarity of commodities rather than on their number. ^The specialist
F41  64 house is usually of moderate size*- in the textile trade, for example,
F41  65 having five or six departments. ^Millinery, piece-goods, lace, and
F41  66 children's wear seem particularly suited for this treatment, and in
F41  67 extreme cases specialists deal in only a few articles, particularly if
F41  68 they become sole distributing agents. ^The development of the
F41  69 specialist is partly the result of manufacturer pressure for more
F41  70 concentrated selling, and partly through his ability to become an
F41  71 authority on quality and value in his particular line of business.
F41  72 *<*4Cash-and-carry Wholesalers*>
F41  73    |^*0This form eliminates a number of operations traditionally
F41  74 associated with wholesaling in return for lower prices. ^There are no
F41  75 credit facilities or delivery services available, and there is rarely
F41  76 any outside selling. ^Such wholesalers are chiefly found in sections
F41  77 of the food trade, household goods, toys, and *'market lines**' (very
F41  78 cheap merchandise for street markets)*- wherever a commodity has a
F41  79 high rate of stock-turn potential. ^Cash-and-carry wholesalers are
F41  80 likely to increase in number.
F41  81 *<*4Agents, Brokers, and Other Small Wholesalers*>
F41  82    |^*0There are many small firms, trading under various titles,
F41  83 which, though they may acquire title to the goods they sell, either
F41  84 never actually hold them or, if they do so, only transfer them without
F41  85 further processing or servicing. ^In the building trade such a trader
F41  86 is picturesquely described as a *'brass plate**' merchant, and a
F41  87 similar type of intermediary appears in the clothing trade, where he
F41  88 sometimes acts as a speculator entering and leaving the trade
F41  89 according to the market.
F41  90    |^The commission merchant, as he is sometimes called, operates
F41  91 without stock (and frequently on credit), selling entirely from
F41  92 manufacturers' samples and placing orders only sufficient to cover his
F41  93 sales.
F41  94    |^On the other hand, the manufacturer's agent carries out functions
F41  95 similar to those of the wholesaler's representative, but, unlike the
F41  96 latter, he is self-employed, and is remunerated by a service fee, or,
F41  97 more usually, by a percentage commission on all sales made. ^The agent
F41  98 is usually given the sole rights in his particular area. ^Agents are
F41  99 primarily used in selling to wholesalers or to central offices of
F41 100 chains of shops. ^They enable a manufacturer to be permanently
F41 101 represented in these areas by people familiar with business conditions
F41 102 there, and they save him the expense of establishing branches.
F41 103 *<*4Co-operative Wholesaling*>
F41 104    |^*0By far the largest units in the wholesale trade are the
F41 105 Co-operative wholesalers. ^There are two main Societies, for England
F41 106 and Scotland respectively, and they exist to serve the many retail
F41 107 Co-operatives, which provide nearly all the capital and exercise
F41 108 control. ^In return the local Societies receive dividends on their
F41 109 purchases.
F41 110    |^The Co-operative Wholesale Society, with headquarters in
F41 111 Manchester and four big branch depots, has been in existence for
F41 112 nearly a century. ^The Scottish *'Wholesale**' was formed shortly
F41 113 after. ^These two Societies have established their own factories,
F41 114 producing goods in 1957 worth just over *+160 \0m., chiefly for
F41 115 producing foodstuffs and household goods. ^The {0*2C.W.S.} *0owns
F41 116 ships, farms, and plantations, transacts considerable banking
F41 117 business, and shares with its Scottish counterpart the control of the
F41 118 Co-operative Insurance Society. ^The two Societies also own and
F41 119 control the English and Scottish Joint {0*2C.W.S.}., *0which
F41 120 performs the special services of tea- and coffee-blending and cocoa
F41 121 and chocolate production for them.
F41 122    |^In 1938 one-tenth of all Britain's imports of food reached
F41 123 housewives by way of the {0*2C.W.S.}, *0and more than half of the
F41 124 goods was purchased direct from the overseas markets by the buying
F41 125 organization of the Society, which has depots in many countries.
F41 126    |^The {0*2C.W.S.} *0is controlled by an elected Board of
F41 127 Directors of twenty-eight, seven of whom retire annually. ^All are
F41 128 full-time salaried officials. ^The Board meets weekly in Manchester,
F41 129 London, or Newcastle. ^It is one of Britain's biggest businesses,
F41 130 since over three-fifths of the goods sold by retail Societies are
F41 131 obtained through the {0*2C.W.S.}, *0and its turnover in 1957
F41 132 amounted to about *+454 \0m.
F41 133 *<*4Wholesaling and Integration*>
F41 134    |^*0One of the most important trends in distribution in the
F41 135 twentieth century has been the increasing desire of manufacturers to
F41 136 control the wholesaling functions themselves. ^This they have usually
F41 137 achieved by establishing their own wholesale department and depots
F41 138 where necessary, though occasionally they have acquired existing
F41 139 wholesale organizations. ^Some wholesalers seeking to maintain their
F41 140 traditional position have adopted the defensive policy of integrating
F41 141 with certain manufacturers. ^Such vertical expansion has been made
F41 142 chiefly to direct and maintain the supply of the most profitable lines
F41 143 within the framework of the organization.
F41 144    |^On the other hand, the large retailer, particularly if he has
F41 145 many outlets, may decide to engage in wholesaling; in fact, many of
F41 146 the present large wholesale houses had their beginnings as retailers.
F41 147 ^The wholesale warehouse is then often operated as an ancillary
F41 148 concern (generally a subsidiary company), perhaps under a different
F41 149 name. ^An existing wholesaler may be taken over. ^Some large groups,
F41 150 such as Debenhams, and the Great Universal Stores, have several
F41 151 wholesale subsidiaries. ^In a few trades, such as fruit and tobacco,
F41 152 firms buy merchandise in bulk for their own shops and resell what they
F41 153 do not need to smaller shops in the district. ^In such circumstances
F41 154 they are primarily retailers, and a few use the terms *'wholesale**'
F41 155 or *'warehouse**' as a customer-catching device.
F41 156    |^While wholesalers are generally prepared to make direct sales to
F41 157 certain classes of final customer*- {0*1e.g.}, *0schools and large
F41 158 industrial firms*- some have established a special department to sell
F41 159 direct to the public on certain conditions, such as after a proper
F41 160 introduction by a retailer. ^Other wholesalers have expanded forward
F41 161 into retailing by the requisition of shops to meet the threats of a
F41 162 changed pattern of distribution and perhaps to make a double profit on
F41 163 each transaction. ^This policy has aroused considerable rancour, even
F41 164 when the shop takes only part of its merchandise from the parent, and
F41 165 has weakened wholesale-retail co-operation.
F41 166 *<*4Location of Warehouses*>
F41 167    |^*0The distinctive premises of the wholesaler are, of course, the
F41 168 warehouse, since normally large stocks must be carried. ^The premises
F41 169 are generally utilized in a strictly practical manner, since the
F41 170 wholesaler's appeal is to the businessman. ^A wholesale merchant's
F41 171 business cannot be set up anywhere; his warehouse is of most service
F41 172 to his customers if they can reach it easily and quickly.
F41 173 ^Consequently it is usually established in a city which is the
F41 174 commercial centre for the surrounding district. ^London is the biggest
F41 175 centre of wholesale textile distribution, with Manchester not far
F41 176 behind.
F41 177    |^In a large city it is usual to find those of one trade located in
F41 178 a particular quarter or street, particularly if there is a market or
F41 179 exchange near by. ^Thus in London, Mark Lane is the centre for corn
F41 180 merchants, while in Manchester all the big textile houses are found in
F41 181 the environs of Piccadilly. ^This concentration of trades of each
F41 182 class is convenient both to customers and to manufacturers' salesmen.
F41 183 *<*4Organization*>
F41 184    |^*0Though a few small businesses, particularly those specializing
F41 185 in certain kinds of business*- {0*1e.g.}, *0millinery, trimmings*-
F41 186 are run by single traders, and the partnership is still fairly
F41 187 frequently met with, the most general form of proprietorship is that
F41 188 of a limited company. ^This is mainly on account of the heavy capital
F41 189 requirements of the trade. ^Wholesale directors are almost invariably
F41 190 executive or working directors, with full responsibility for a
F41 191 particular function.
F41 192    |^The scope of the wholesaling task is indicated by a few facts
F41 193 about wholesale textile distribution. ^Large wholesalers carry an
F41 194 average stock of *+1,000,000; they dispatch approximately 2000 parcels
F41 195 a day to various parts of the country for their 10,000-15,000 retail
F41 196 accounts, and receive supplies from anything up to a thousand
F41 197 suppliers from time to time. ^Moreover, the documentation and handling
F41 198 of each customer's order may involve thirty-two separate operations,
F41 199 many of which must be repeated in reverse if the goods do not comply
F41 200 with the retailer's requirements.
F41 201    |^Whatever the merchandise carried, the organization broadly
F41 202 resembles that of a big department store, each department forming a
F41 203 separate unit under a departmental manager. ^Frequently there are four
F41 204 main departments: buying, warehousing, selling, and administration.
F41 205 ^There are usually separate buyers responsible for the requirements of
F41 206 each section, but their activities are co-ordinated by the purchasing
F41 207 department, which also deals with the paper-work. ^Warehousing is a
F41 208 specialized job, and may include assembling, grading, breaking bulk,
F41 209 and packing. ^The wholesaler provides a selling organization for the
F41 210 manufacturer, and most of this selling is done by trained travellers.
F41 211 ^But the wholesaler's showrooms may also be very important: the
F41 212 retailer is offered a huge stock and variety of merchandise which no
F41 213 other system could bring to him under one roof.

F42   2 *<*6\0D. ENGLAND*>
F42   3 *<FOCUS ON ENGLISH FARE*>
F42   4    |^*2AT *0an old-established hotel in an East Coast resort there is
F42   5 an unusual notice on the bottom of the menu card: ^*'Epicures agree
F42   6 that English food well cooked is the best in the world. ^For this
F42   7 reason, this hotel specializes in the finest English cooking, and
F42   8 nothing canned or twice cooked is ever served.**'
F42   9    |^An admirable and unexpected statement which is to be backed by a
F42  10 twelve-month campaign to promote British Food, launched by the British
F42  11 Farm Produce Council. ^It includes staging four large-scale
F42  12 exhibitions at major urban centres throughout the United Kingdom,
F42  13 twelve displays in stores in regional towns and joint ventures with
F42  14 such organizations as the Townswomen's Guilds, the Gas Council,
F42  15 Electricity Boards and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
F42  16 Development Boards. ^The first large-scale show is to be held in
F42  17 London from 11-16 September.
F42  18    |^The Council's chairman, \0Mr. {0W. R.} Trehane, commenting on
F42  19 the campaign, said: ^*'British shoppers should certainly be well aware
F42  20 of the quality food that comes from their own farmers and growers by
F42  21 the end of the year.**' ^And the farming community should be
F42  22 especially pleased that its products are to get such a tremendous
F42  23 boost just where it would be most effective*- on the customer's
F42  24 doorstep, he added. ^The British Farm Produce Council was launched in
F42  25 the autumn of 1960. ^Its basic aims are to tell the buying public more
F42  26 about British food, how to choose and how to cook it, and to let
F42  27 farmers and growers know that the shopper thinks about their products.
F42  28    |^The Council has plenty to go upon for the range of English foods
F42  29 is amazingly wide. ^A restaurant in the West End offered its customers
F42  30 a choice of no fewer than 500 recipes of Old English fare, and these
F42  31 were selected from as many as fifteen hundred recipes. ^The first menu
F42  32 included a milk soup from Sussex, a star gazy pie from Cornwall,
F42  33 herrings, beef olives from Cheshire with dumplings and green peas, and
F42  34 a Welbeck pudding from Nottinghamshire.
F42  35    |^These merely touch the fringe of the possibilities, as was
F42  36 evident when a Folk Cookery exhibition was staged, for there were to
F42  37 be seen eatables with the most delightful names. ^They included Yule
F42  38 cakes eaten in Yorkshire between Christmas Day and New Year's Day;
F42  39 Sedgmoor Easter cakes; *'Tyneside Yule Doos,**' childish figures
F42  40 supposed to represent the Infant Jesus, and made by Tyneside mothers
F42  41 for their children on baking day; *'Checky pigs**' from
F42  42 Leicestershire; Lardy cakes and wafers for Mothering Sunday, from
F42  43 Devizes; Devonshire applecake; Bakewell tart from Derbyshire;
F42  44 Deddington pudding pies; Cornish *'black cake**'; Burying cake, from
F42  45 an old English recipe; Yorkshire oatcake, made in strips; Melton
F42  46 Mowbray pork pie; gilt gingerbread from Bute; parkin from Yorkshire;
F42  47 Grasmere gingerbread, which looks like shortbread; Congleton
F42  48 gingerbread with rice-paper underneath; and Coventry *'God Cake**',
F42  49 which dates back to the fourteenth or fifteenth century, given when a
F42  50 godchild was christened or made its first communion. ^It is a pastry
F42  51 cake after the style of a Banbury cake and in the shape of an
F42  52 isosceles triangle. ^It is slashed across the middle and ornamented
F42  53 with sugar.
F42  54    |^One of the most delightful exhibits ever put on was seen in the
F42  55 Gothic Hall of Lacock Abbey, four miles from Chippenham. ^Local dishes
F42  56 from all over the British Isles were displayed in rich profusion, and
F42  57 some of the most interesting were seen in the making. ^Dainties still
F42  58 made today, like Welsh bakestone loaf, Selkirk bannocks, and Dublin
F42  59 barm brack, were shown in company with more strictly period exhibits
F42  60 such as Queen Henrietta Maria's morning broth*- for in Charles *=1's
F42  61 day they took chicken broth for breakfast*- and salmagundi, a
F42  62 favourite supper dish in the eighteenth century and obviously the
F42  63 ancestor of {6*1hors d'oeuvre}. ^*0Dishes similar to those displayed
F42  64 must have been cooked and eaten centuries ago at Lacock Abbey.
F42  65    |^Some ancient kitchen implements belonging to the abbey were also
F42  66 on show. ^A great pestle and mortar seen were said to have been there
F42  67 since the time of Sir William Sharington, the first lay owner of
F42  68 Lacock Abbey after the Dissolution. ^A venerable mould, in the form of
F42  69 an elephant, was used to make a cake exhibited. ^Among loans from
F42  70 elsewhere were a set of fine moulds for gingerbread from the Pump Room
F42  71 at Bath. ^Gingerbread figures properly gilded, proved that the moulds
F42  72 are as good today as ever they were. ^River crayfish, boiled as
F42  73 scarlet as any lobster, came from the river in the grounds of Lacock
F42  74 Abbey.
F42  75    |^The late Miss \0F. White, who founded the English Folk Cookery
F42  76 Association prepared a unique gastronomic map. ^She used to go about
F42  77 the country collecting information concerning food much as Cecil Sharp
F42  78 used to go about in his work of research for folk-songs and dances,
F42  79 and she plotted her discoveries on a Gastronomic Map. ^Looking over
F42  80 this one noticed such names as Coventry Godcake mentioned above, and
F42  81 Stuffed Chine at Clee in Lincolnshire; and found that Melton Mowbray
F42  82 is as famous for curd cheese-cakes as for its pork pies. ^Stuffed
F42  83 Chine, by the way, is a famous old dish at Clee for Trinity Sunday,
F42  84 the custom being for a chine of bacon stuffed with herbs to form part
F42  85 of the dinner. ^The curd cheese-cakes of Melton Mowbray are a great
F42  86 dish for Whit-Sunday. ^It is said that there are enough of these cakes
F42  87 made for the festival to pave the whole town.
F42  88    |^Every county is, rightly, jealous of its folk-cookery tradition,
F42  89 and there is no doubt that the north of England is strong in this
F42  90 respect. ^A list of inns, hotels, and restaurants where good local
F42  91 dishes could be enjoyed mentioned for Yorkshire alone: Barnsley chops,
F42  92 curd cheese-cakes, oven cakes, sly cakes, Doncaster butterscotch,
F42  93 oatmeal fritters, bilberry pies, Yorkshire batter pudding, brandy
F42  94 snap, spiced bread, Sheffield polony, potted shrimps, frumenty,
F42  95 Wensleydale cheese, apple cheese-cakes, primrose vinegar, fish pie,
F42  96 turf cakes, bakestone cakes, parkin, and gingerbread. ^References were
F42  97 made to the Yorkshire practice of eating cheese with cake, and there
F42  98 was a consensus of opinion that ham and eggs as served in the county
F42  99 is a succulent dish.
F42 100    |^Scotland is too often neglected or overlooked, and so it is good
F42 101 that a little book of Scottish recipes has been compiled *'primarily
F42 102 for visitors to Scotland, *"lost**" Scots and others**'. ^The recipes
F42 103 range from soups, puddings and pies, cakes and shortbreads, to many
F42 104 other intriguing items such as Parlies or Scottish Parliament Cake,
F42 105 Athol Brose, Cranachan or Cream-Crowdie, and Tatties an' Herrin'. ^It
F42 106 has been asked: what are the predominant characteristics of Scottish
F42 107 cookery? ^The answer: simplicity, good sense and an instinct for
F42 108 dietetic values, and what more could one ask?
F42 109    |^One of the most historic of country dishes is dumplings. ^One
F42 110 recalls that celebrated farmhouse dinner described in *1Cranford,
F42 111 *0which Miss Matty only half-enjoyed because the delicate young peas
F42 112 would drop between the prongs of the old-fashioned two-pronged forks,
F42 113 and gentility forbade her to imitate her host and shovel them up on
F42 114 the blade of her knife. ^\0Mr. Holbrook, her old suitor, was right to
F42 115 be unceremonious with his peas, and he was right also, in his blunt
F42 116 way, about the use of dumplings to stay the appetite.
F42 117    |^*'When I was a young man, we used to keep strictly to my father's
F42 118 rule, ~*"No broth, no ball: no ball, no beef,**" and always began
F42 119 dinner with broth. ^Then we had suet puddings, boiled in the broth
F42 120 with the beef; and then the meat itself. ^If we did not sup our broth,
F42 121 we had no ball, which we liked a deal better; and the beef came last
F42 122 of all, and only those had it who had done justice to the broth and
F42 123 the ball.**' ^Being a Cheshire man, \0Mr. Holbrook was probably
F42 124 unacquainted with the Norfolk dumpling, which goes one step further in
F42 125 the direction of economy by dispensing with the suet.
F42 126    |^This recalls that brave and manly eighteenth-century Norfolk
F42 127 incumbent, the \0Rev. James Woodforde, whose diary has only one rival,
F42 128 that of Pepys. ^On one occasion, after a good dinner and a bad night,
F42 129 he noted: ^*'Mince \1pye rose \1oft.**' ^If this is not literary
F42 130 style*- the expression of meaning with a minimum of words and a
F42 131 maximum of effect*- one would be interested to learn of a better
F42 132 example.
F42 133    |^Woodforde's life was humdrum in some respects, but it had its
F42 134 difficulties. ^Of these, along with the smooth, he made the best,
F42 135 taking life as it came, without repining or vain hopes, and contriving
F42 136 to get a good deal of satisfaction for himself and others out of it,
F42 137 not least from his food. ^His meals were like himself, good and
F42 138 honest, and one quotes this typical meal: ^*'\0st. Course: boiled
F42 139 Tench, Pea Soup, a Couple of boiled Chicken and pigs Face, hashed
F42 140 Calf's Head, Beans, and roasted Rump of Beef with New Potatoes \0etc.
F42 141 ^\02nd. Course: roasted Duck and green Peas, a very fine Leveret
F42 142 roasted, Strawberry Cream, Jelly, Puddings \0etc. ^Dessert*-
F42 143 Strawberries, Cherries and last Year's nonpareils.**' ^English cooking
F42 144 at its best.

F42 146 *<MUSHROOMS*- WILD AND TAME*>
F42 147    |^*'*2THE *0steak is excellent, but the mushrooms don't taste like
F42 148 mushrooms!**'
F42 149    |^This was the comment, heard during dinner in a restaurant, which
F42 150 sent me off in search of {Psalliota Campestris}*- the common white
F42 151 field mushroom*- and the reason why *'mushrooms don't taste like
F42 152 mushrooms.**'
F42 153    |^The first thing I discovered was that the common white field
F42 154 mushroom is common no longer. ^In fact, it is in danger of
F42 155 disappearing completely.
F42 156    |^Present-day farming methods are to blame*- or so I was told by a
F42 157 local farmer, who explained that all the mushrooms had disappeared
F42 158 from his *'home**' field since he had treated the grass with a
F42 159 chemical fertilizer.
F42 160    |^A botanist at our local museum agreed with the farmer. ^He said,
F42 161 however, that this was not the only reason why there were so few
F42 162 mushrooms in our fields today. ^Mushrooms, it seems, like old
F42 163 pastures, where the soil has lain undisturbed for decades. ^Such
F42 164 pastures are becoming increasingly rare. ^The preference is for
F42 165 *'ley**' farming in which grasslands are ploughed and re-seeded every
F42 166 few years. ^This process breaks up a complex underground rooting
F42 167 system, which takes many years to re-establish.
F42 168    |^Yet another contributory factor is the disappearance of the horse
F42 169 from our farms. ^Indeed, if it were not for the numerous riding
F42 170 schools and racing stables throughout the country, mushrooms would be
F42 171 an ever greater luxury than they already are. ^For, even in these
F42 172 enlightened days, mushroom growers have not found a perfect substitute
F42 173 for stable manure on which to base their hot-beds.
F42 174    |^Even so, cultivated mushrooms are booming. ^Their popularity has
F42 175 increased enormously during the last ten years or so. ^For instance,
F42 176 in one small part of Nottinghamshire alone there are eight flourishing
F42 177 mushroom farms, and, according to a grower I talked to, they have no
F42 178 difficulty in disposing of their crops.
F42 179    |^From that, it would appear that mushroom-growing is an attractive
F42 180 proposition. ^Alas, there are snags. ^The first is that it is
F42 181 expensive. ^The cardboard baskets, for instance, in which the grower
F42 182 packs his mushrooms for the wholesalers, cost him sixpence each! ^In
F42 183 the *'off**' season*- the summer months*- he may only receive two
F42 184 shillings a pound which, when the costs of spawn, manure, \0etc.,
F42 185 heat, labour, and depreciation of buildings, \0etc., are taken into
F42 186 account, doesn't leave a very great margin of profit!
F42 187    |^Moreover mushrooms are a very risky crop. ^They may appear in
F42 188 abundance*- or they may not appear at all. ^Or they may become
F42 189 diseased. ^If that should happen the entire crop is lost and the beds
F42 190 must be rested for some months to clear the infection.
F42 191    |^*'But why don't they taste like mushrooms?**' I asked the grower.
F42 192 ^He laughed. ^*'I suppose you mean, why don't they taste like *1field
F42 193 *0mushrooms,**' he said. ^*'And the answer to that is, they are a
F42 194 different variety. ^You don't expect a Cox's Orange Pippin to taste
F42 195 like a Grannie Smith, do you? ^It's the same with mushrooms. ^Even in
F42 196 the wild varieties there are at least two well-marked kinds.

F43  25 ^In such cases the man in charge of the Parks loses his enthusiasm and
F43  26 the Local Authority never gets the best from the senior employee in
F43  27 charge of the Parks Department simply because he cannot plan and plant
F43  28 according to his taste. ^Gardeners are a peculiar race of people, they
F43  29 like to do the job their own way and can be very frustrated when a
F43  30 person with no horticultural training controls the business of the
F43  31 public parks and gardens and has the last word with the Parks

F43  35    |^The Third Conference Paper *"Historic Houses and Estates as
F43  36 Public Parks**" by \0Mr. \0F. Hallowes, {0F.Inst.P.A.},
F43  37 {0M.Inst.B.C.A.}, Director of Parks, Nottingham, follows.
F43  38 *<*6HISTORIC HOUSES AND ESTATES AS PUBLIC PARKS*>
F43  39    |^P*2RIOR *0to the 1914-18 war the majority of historic houses and
F43  40 estates in the United Kingdom were occupied by their owners, and in
F43  41 numerous cases the landed people owned these properties in various
F43  42 parts of the country, usually one in Scotland, and two or so in
F43  43 England, in addition to their London residence. ^This pleasant state
F43  44 of affairs had continued peacefully and uninterruptedly for many years
F43  45 but the advent of the war saw great changes in the ownership, control,
F43  46 and maintenance of these properties, largely due to heavy taxation,
F43  47 cost of upkeep, and the dispersal of staff during the war years. ^In
F43  48 many cases speculators bought up these historic houses and estates,
F43  49 stripped the mansions of their treasures, took the lead from the roofs
F43  50 and the timber from the estates, and sold the land for building plots
F43  51 and the buildings for hotels, private schools, \0etc. ^This trend has
F43  52 never been completely arrested and though many houses and estates are
F43  53 still in private ownership many others have continued to be used for a
F43  54 variety of purposes.
F43  55 *<*2OWNERSHIP*>
F43  56    |^*0A broad estimate of ownership of some 478 houses in the United
F43  57 Kingdom which are open to the public indicates that 56 per \0cent. are
F43  58 still in private ownership, 26 per \0cent. under the control of the
F43  59 National Trust, 10 per \0cent. owned and used by Local Authorities, 7
F43  60 per \0cent. occupied by Government Departments, and 1 per \0cent. used
F43  61 as schools. ^From time to time figures published of the numbers
F43  62 admitted and the fees paid show that the public are anxious and
F43  63 enthusiastic to visit these places and enjoy the beauty of the grounds
F43  64 and study the history of their country's heritage. ^There is also the
F43  65 important factor, a very important factor these days, of the tourist
F43  66 industry. ^Many millions of pounds are attracted to this country by
F43  67 tourists from various parts of the world who are interested in
F43  68 studying the centuries old houses and gardens, particularly those
F43  69 people from countries who have little history themselves.
F43  70    |^The percentage of houses and estates owned by local authorities
F43  71 for the admission of the public to the house and grounds appears to be
F43  72 a rather low figure and one would imagine that local authorities might
F43  73 with profit and prestige to themselves regard with more enthusiasm the
F43  74 acquisition of some of these magnificent places which from time to
F43  75 time become available so that their history and very existence may be
F43  76 preserved for the people. ^It is, I think, appropriate that local
F43  77 authorities should be active and responsible in the preservation of
F43  78 this country's heritage and it is regretted that opportunities appear
F43  79 to have been missed as ownership of such estates has enormous prestige
F43  80 value for a local authority.
F43  81 *<*2POWERS TO ACQUIRE*>
F43  82    |^*0There may be some hesitancy in the minds of local authorities
F43  83 in connection with their powers to acquire estates as public parks and
F43  84 the economics involved. ^With reference to such powers, the Public
F43  85 Health Act of 1875 appears to give the necessary powers to acquire
F43  86 lands for public parks, \0etc., amended by Public Health Acts
F43  87 Amendment Act 1890 and 1907. ^The National Trust Act of 1907 deals
F43  88 with arrangements with Local Authorities and there is also the
F43  89 Physical Training and Recreation Act of 1937 dealing with the
F43  90 acquisition of playing fields, which may not be absolutely the reason
F43  91 for which an authority would wish to acquire property, unless the
F43  92 lands were extensive and recreation facilities might be provided
F43  93 without interfering with the character of the estate.
F43  94    |^Some years ago the Ministry of Works set up three Buildings
F43  95 Councils to advise the Minister on the exercise of his powers in
F43  96 making grants towards maintenance and repair of historic buildings.
F43  97 ^The Minister also has powers to purchase, or to assist local Councils
F43  98 and the National Trust to acquire, as the case may be. ^A quarter of a
F43  99 million pounds was provided for preserving historic properties and a
F43 100 like amount for purchasing. ^For the year 1959-60 the sum of *+425,000
F43 101 was provided for preserving this type of building. ^The most recent
F43 102 report of the Historic Buildings Council for England indicates that
F43 103 *+500,000 a year is now provided for the preservation of buildings of
F43 104 historic interest and importance. ^It would appear, therefore, that a
F43 105 local authority keen to acquire an estate and property in their area
F43 106 would receive considerable support both by virtue of their own powers
F43 107 and by the readiness of the Government to encourage such an
F43 108 acquisition.
F43 109 *<*2ECONOMICS*>
F43 110    |^*0With regards **[SIC**] to the economics involved, some local
F43 111 authorities have purchased estates and have not only carried out a
F43 112 very good business deal for themselves but also acquired a beauty spot
F43 113 for their people. ^I find, however, it is rather surprising that ten
F43 114 per \0cent. only of those estates that have become available during
F43 115 the last forty years are used as public parks. ^It is of paramount
F43 116 importance to the smaller but expanding town that its Council,
F43 117 whenever the opportunity arises, acquires for itself an estate. ^It is
F43 118 an investment of the highest value which will appreciate as the years
F43 119 pass and will pay regular dividends not only in money but in the
F43 120 health and happiness of its people and the enhanced prestige that such
F43 121 a possession brings to any town or city.
F43 122    |^The question of capital outlay and maintenance may be a reason
F43 123 why some smaller authorities have allowed opportunities, no doubt
F43 124 reluctantly to go begging and have afterwards regretted their lack of
F43 125 enterprise. ^A local authority or combination of authorities should
F43 126 not hesitate too long if they contemplate acquiring an estate in their
F43 127 area. ^They should make their decision quickly, as delay causes
F43 128 deterioration of buildings and estate which ultimately lead **[SIC**]
F43 129 to unnecessarily high costs in maintenance later. ^Having acquired the
F43 130 estate, time should not be lost in laying down definite principles for
F43 131 the best use of the buildings, the advantages and disadvantages of
F43 132 various methods, car parking, catering, advertising and publicity,
F43 133 liaison with public transport, freedom from unnecessary restrictions
F43 134 for the public, provision and sale of publications, need for planting
F43 135 and bedding schemes. ^Park administrators are, with their wide
F43 136 experience, ideal people to undertake the management of historic
F43 137 houses and estates. ^They clearly understand the needs of the public
F43 138 and in addition to the multitude of administrative matters which need
F43 139 expert attention they are sympathetic to the retention of the historic
F43 140 characteristics of estates which should at all costs be preserved.
F43 141    |^One unfortunately sees historic features carelessly lost when
F43 142 estates fall into unsympathetic hands. ^Buildings are *"converted**",
F43 143 handsome trees removed, novelties introduced which to the thinking
F43 144 person are gauche and repellant. ^Many will have, I am sure, visited
F43 145 at various times historic estates hoping to enjoy their carefully
F43 146 preserved glories only to find numerous and varied *"catchpenny
F43 147 attractions**" which completely destroy the character and atmosphere
F43 148 of the place and cause the visitor pain instead of pleasure. ^I have
F43 149 always found Parks people conscious of the necessity to preserve the
F43 150 character and atmosphere of any historic estate in their care and are
F43 151 **[SIC**] capable of making the requisite provision for accommodating
F43 152 large numbers of the public and at the same time retaining its charm
F43 153 and grandeur.
F43 154 *<*2NOTTINGHAM'S ESTATES*>
F43 155    |^*0Three historic places are controlled by the Parks Committee of
F43 156 the City of Nottingham.
F43 157    |^Wollaton Hall, originally 774 acres, was acquired by the
F43 158 Nottingham Corporation in 1925 for *+200,000 (a fair sum at that
F43 159 time!). ^Selective development by the Corporation and private builders
F43 160 took place on the fringe of the estate and houses, schools, places of
F43 161 worship, and licensed premises, were built and part of a most valuable
F43 162 ring road was laid out. ^The buildings were designed in a style to
F43 163 blend with the existing character of the environs of the district and
F43 164 this area is now regarded as a fashionable residential suburb of the
F43 165 City, and the ring road with its mature planting and grass verges has
F43 166 proved to be a main traffic artery and has blended perfectly into the
F43 167 natural beauty of the existing estate.
F43 168    |^The financial return from this development, defrayed the actual
F43 169 cost of the purchase, and over 600 acres of beautiful park land, laid
F43 170 out after the style of *"Capability**" Brown still remains for the
F43 171 benefit of the public. ^It is estimated that over one million people
F43 172 avail themselves of this Park each year. ^Development within the park
F43 173 has not detracted from its original style*- one can be excused such
F43 174 necessary requirements of the modern age as car parks and refreshment
F43 175 kiosks. ^A golf course covering 136 acres was laid out and although
F43 176 still under municipal control and available to any member of the
F43 177 public is leased to the Wollaton Park Golf Club for *+1,500 {6per
F43 178 annum}, plus rates, the Club maintaining the course and the Club
F43 179 House. ^Two herds of deer abound **[SIC**] the park. ^A 35 acre lake
F43 180 is fished by fee and brings in some *+300. ^The building, Elizabethan
F43 181 (1580-85), is used as a natural history museum and attracts 200,000
F43 182 visitors a year. ^This is valuable for students from the neighbouring
F43 183 University and the City schools. ^The park still retains its
F43 184 collection of trees and the gardens are bedded out attractively. ^The
F43 185 9 acre walled-in Kitchen Garden is now a most valuable nursery and
F43 186 makes a great contribution to the plant requirements of the
F43 187 Department.
F43 188    |^The Park has also housed over thirty major promotions, including
F43 189 the Royal Show, the Bath and West and Southern Counties Show, and the
F43 190 Royal Command Military Tattoo, all of these events being accommodated
F43 191 (inclusive of car parks) without causing damage or disruption and
F43 192 without completely closing the whole of the park. ^The fact that a
F43 193 local authority can accommodate such functions as these not only
F43 194 attracts first-class publicity to the authority but also has a
F43 195 considerable economic and prestige value.

F44   6 people. ^My last was no exception. ^The most surprising, though, was
F44   7 Elvis Presley*- I almost literally bumped into him!
F44   8    |^I was leaving the restaurant at the 20th Century-Fox studios a
F44   9 few days before I flew home from Hollywood. ^I noticed a football
F44  10 flying over a wall between two lots.
F44  11    |^Not the sort of bloke to miss a chance, I went to trap it with my
F44  12 foot. ^Another fellow was running after it, too, and we collided with
F44  13 what, for me at any rate, was an almighty bump.
F44  14    |^*1Some others came over from their game and helped me to my feet.
F44  15 ^One of them said: ^*"You're Frankie Vaughan, aren't you?**" ^*"Yes, I
F44  16 am,**" I replied, *"and you must be Elvis.**"
F44  17    |^*0With some friends he had been playing a version of American
F44  18 football during his lunch break. ^As we chatted a car went by, with
F44  19 the driver shouting at Elvis, telling him off for being in the
F44  20 roadway.
F44  21    |^You should have seen his eyes goggle when he realised who he had
F44  22 been telling off!
F44  23    |^I found Elvis a very likeable young man. ^He seems to have lots
F44  24 of energy and a great enthusiasm for life.
F44  25    |^Juliet Prowse, my co-star in *"The Right Approach,**" the film
F44  26 that had taken me to Hollywood, had worked with Elvis in *"\0GI
F44  27 Blues,**" as you know. ^She told me how nice he had been to her when
F44  28 they were making that picture together.
F44  29    |^My last visit was very much a working trip. ^There wasn't much
F44  30 time for fun. ^We made *"The Right Approach**" very quickly, and it
F44  31 was hard work. ^I was on the go seven days a week.
F44  32    |^*1Even when there was no actual filming at weekends, I was busy
F44  33 learning my lines, having costume fittings, rehearsing or meeting the
F44  34 publicity people.
F44  35 *<*6NO PLACE IN THE SUN*>
F44  36    |^*0I missed getting into the sun*- there just wasn't the time.
F44  37    |^*"The Right Approach**" gives me my toughest part so far. ^I play
F44  38 a real rat. ^When Gary Crosby is auditioning for a cabaret engagement
F44  39 I have to show off in front of a girl and I mess up his routine.
F44  40    |^After interrupting his song I take it over completely halfway
F44  41 through, much to his annoyance!
F44  42    |^Apart from this, I have three other songs which I filmed by
F44  43 myself. ^But don't think the picture is a musical. ^It is a drama, but
F44  44 the songs are fitted into it naturally without affecting the action.
F44  45    |^I made time to meet several old friends during my time in
F44  46 Hollywood. ^Stella and I went to Billy Eckstine's opening at the
F44  47 Crescendo, and had dinner with him afterwards.
F44  48    |^We also dined with Gogi Grant and her lawyer-husband. ^Wilfred
F44  49 Hyde White, who was in *"Let's Make Love**" with me, was also back in
F44  50 Hollywood*- making a film with Danny Kaye*- and we saw quite a lot of
F44  51 him and his wife, Ethel, who is shortly expecting her second baby.
F44  52    |^*1Pat Boone was at the 20th Century-Fox studios making *"Warm
F44  53 Bodies.**" ^I have known him for some time and looked him up again.
F44  54 ^He is a really nice person.

F44  57 *"Madison Avenue.**"
F44  58    |^Before I began the film, I played my second season at the Dunes

F44  60    |^He was appearing there, at the Sands, but he managed to come in
F44  61 to my late show*- the third of the night. ^I frequently joined him at
F44  62 his hotel later.
F44  63    |^He used to organise film shows in his suite. ^Often there were a
F44  64 lot of friends there and they were always great fun. ^The shows lasted
F44  65 about two hours, after which I had some breakfast and then went to
F44  66 bed!
F44  67    |^*1It meant keeping crazy hours, as it was often past noon when I
F44  68 got up again. ^But then, that's Las Vegas!
F44  69    |^*0Basil Tait, who is now my accompanist and musical director, was
F44  70 making his first trip to Vegas, and I had to show him the sights. ^I
F44  71 soon had him familiar with all the ropes.
F44  72    |^We went into the mountains taking private movies and went out
F44  73 into the desert for some fishing from a lake.
F44  74    |^Vic Damone was another singer I met during my stay. ^Betty Grable
F44  75 and her husband, bandleader Harry James, were both appearing in Vegas,

F44  78 *<*4A future in films for *6RUSS CONWAY *4Britain's Keyboard King*>
F44  79    |^R*2USS CONWAY'S *0injured hand has given him time to think*- and
F44  80 the result may well be that a new field of entertainment will open up
F44  81 for him in 1961.
F44  82    |^It was towards the end of November you may recall, that Russ had
F44  83 to withdraw from the London Palladium revue *"Stars In Your Eyes.**"
F44  84 ^A fall in which he had suffered a severely bruised hand and wrist was
F44  85 the cause.
F44  86    |^No one was more disappointed than Russ, even though it meant he
F44  87 could have a holiday a little sooner than he anticipated. ^For about a
F44  88 month he was out of action, but put that time to good use*- for he has
F44  89 now decided that he would like to make a name in films!
F44  90    |^At about the same time as Russ withdrew from the Palladium show,
F44  91 he filmed his contribution to a British comedy film, *"Weekend With
F44  92 Lulu.**" ^This was his second exploit with the celluloid screen*- he
F44  93 previously appeared in *"Climb Up The Wall.**"
F44  94    |^Now Russ is quite open about his hopes for the future*- he has
F44  95 taken such a liking to film work that he wants to branch out in this
F44  96 side of show business, and he is already discussing a project to make
F44  97 a movie during the summer.
F44  98    |^He admitted: ^*"I suppose I have really got a bug about film
F44  99 making. ^I enjoy it very much*- particularly as the method and medium
F44 100 are so different from television.**"
F44 101    |
F44 102    |^Don't think, though, that the versatile \0Mr. Conway is going to
F44 103 desert variety, {0TV} and discs.
F44 104    |^A taped {0ATV} series, with a scheduled start of **[SIC**]
F44 105 January 5, has been keeping him busy for some time, as well as talks
F44 106 and policy-making meetings for his future.
F44 107    |^He excited a lot of curiosity by announcing his intention of
F44 108 taking a holiday in Australia this month, particularly when he
F44 109 stressed that he was determined not to let it develop into a working
F44 110 trip!
F44 111    |^The truth is, of course, that the Australians are great followers
F44 112 of Russ, and Conway realised that overtures might be made to him to
F44 113 make at least a token appearance on a big {0TV} show.
F44 114    |^His plan, however, is to consider any offers that come his way
F44 115 from Australian promoters and agents*- but with a view to working
F44 116 there some time in the future. ^The reason he is so serious about
F44 117 making this a holiday-only trip? ^*"This could be the last vacation I
F44 118 shall have for several years,**" he explained.
F44 119    |^What can we expect from Russ in 1961? ^Well, on his return from
F44 120 *"down under**" at the end of next month, he will begin to prepare for
F44 121 his starring appearance in Coventry Theatre's colourful (not to
F44 122 mention star-studded) *"Spring Show,**" which opens on Easter Monday.
F44 123    |^As previously stated, a film could follow this, taking Russ into
F44 124 the middle of the summer. ^What will happen after that, even Russ
F44 125 doesn't know!
F44 126    |^One thing is certain. ^Many artists would be terrified of a
F44 127 sudden month-long break in their career*- it could spell disaster and
F44 128 eventual ruin.
F44 129    |^But Russ Conway is the sort of person with whom that indefinable
F44 130 creature Success, and her elusive companion Luck, always stay. ^Why,
F44 131 his *"Even More Party Pops**" disc moved into the charts during his
F44 132 absence from the public eye, and sold in a large enough quantity to
F44 133 ensure that there will be thousands spinning his discs this Christmas.
F44 134    |^Perhaps the nicest thing said about Russ was by a hardened music
F44 135 publisher as he paused to talk to a friend in Tin Pan Alley*- London's
F44 136 Denmark Street.
F44 137    |^*"What a shame about Russ Conway leaving the Palladium show,**"
F44 138 he said. ^*"Still, even if he's got a swollen hand there's no danger
F44 139 of it spreading to his head!**"
F44 140 *<*4The Shadows' private lives*>
F44 141    |^W*2HAT *0do the Shadows do when they are away from the hustle and
F44 142 bustle of theatres and showbusiness? ^What are their hobbies? ^To find
F44 143 out the answers to these questions (incidentally, favourite queries
F44 144 from fans), *2HIT PARADE *0asked each of the chart-topping group to
F44 145 reveal a little of their private lives.
F44 146    |^Jet Harris, bass guitarist and leader of the group is a keen
F44 147 racing driver. ^He has an ambition to race in the Monte Carlo rally,
F44 148 though he is not set upon winning it. ^*"I would enter just for the
F44 149 thrill,**" he says.
F44 150    |^He has other part-time occupations, in addition to his race
F44 151 driving. ^For instance, he is a keen archer and snooker player. ^He is
F44 152 not often taken seriously when he says that he would like to emulate
F44 153 William Tell's famous feat, but he is practising hard for an
F44 154 achievement in this direction.
F44 155    |^In snooker, he has another aim*- to play former world champion
F44 156 Joe Davis!
F44 157    |^Of course, it's natural that Jet should have composing as an
F44 158 additional hobby, for no matter how hard you try, it's no simple
F44 159 matter to break away from showbusiness entirely.
F44 160    |^Writing, too, takes up his time. ^Once he wrote a book with poet
F44 161 Royston Ellis*- titled *"Driftin',**" it sold some 300,000 copies*-
F44 162 and no wonder, for it was about Cliff Richard!
F44 163    |^Bruce Welch, perhaps the best-known of the group in the composing
F44 164 line, spends a great deal of time with his music. ^He has written two
F44 165 of Cliff's hits*- *"Please Don't Tease**" and *"I Love You,**" and he
F44 166 worked on many of the numbers for the *"Me And My Shadows**" {0LP}.
F44 167    |^He hasn't always been successful in this direction, though, and
F44 168 he has some stories to tell about his early days in showbusiness that
F44 169 are hard to believe, compared with his present-day success.
F44 170    |^Does it surprise you to know that Bruce and Hank Marvin when they
F44 171 first moved to London from Newcastle sometimes were on the verge of
F44 172 starving? ^In fact, according to Bruce ~*"At times we were so hungry
F44 173 we stayed in bed to conserve our energy and to save ourselves the
F44 174 frustration of seeing shops full of eatables that we just didn't have
F44 175 the money to buy.**"
F44 176    |^Hank Marvin, who was voted into third place in the *2NEW MUSICAL
F44 177 EXPRESS *01960 Poll for the *"Instrumental Personality Of The Year**"
F44 178 section, has similar interests to Jet, although he prefers Go-Kart
F44 179 driving to rally driving.
F44 180    |^But he has one unusual hobby*- he collects swords, guns and other
F44 181 curios that interest him. ^Like the others he is a keen archer, but
F44 182 really prefers plucking the guitar string to the bow-string.
F44 183    |^*"I practise four hours a day whenever I am able,**" he says,
F44 184 *"but I find that the mad rush of showbusiness doesn't always allow
F44 185 this. ^It is true to say that I practise as much as I can, though.**"
F44 186    |^Drummer Tony Meehan, youngest of the group, is a serious musical
F44 187 student, and is responsible for most of the Shadows arranging, as well
F44 188 as a little composition. ^He has yet to have a composition published.
F44 189    |^He loves reading and is a bookworm in the true sense of the word.
F44 190 ^His reading matter encompasses Freud, historical novels and text
F44 191 books on music.
F44 192    |^Now that the Shadows have formed their own publishing company*-
F44 193 Shadows Music*- in association with Aberbach, it is probable that some
F44 194 of Tony's compositions will be used.
F44 195    |^In addition to all the spare time interests they have outlined,
F44 196 the boys like nothing better than to get together for talks covering
F44 197 all sorts of subjects*- ranging round religion, politics, Elvis
F44 198 Presley and the charts!
