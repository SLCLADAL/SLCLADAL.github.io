E01   2 *<*4Introduction*>
E01   3    |^*0What a world of graceful accomplishment lies in a piece of
E01   4 finely worked hand-made lace!
E01   5    |^The very word lace has a charming derivation, stemming through
E01   6 the Old French \*1las, *0coming from the Latin \*1laqueus, *0a snare,
E01   7 allied to \*1lacere, *0to entice.
E01   8    |^Certainly all who make a study of lace-craft become enmeshed in a
E01   9 highly coloured history*- a pattern of proud queens and pious
E01  10 ecclesiastics, of statesmen, burghers and poor, under-privileged
E01  11 people. ^All the human passions are drawn in its threads, from
E01  12 saintliness to downright sinfulness, for it shows the smuggler running
E01  13 *'laces for a lady**' and the highwayman meeting death upon the
E01  14 gallows *'in a fine show of hand-made lace**'.
E01  15    |^As to the origins of lace-making in this country, they are
E01  16 difficult to trace, but we know that it existed in the thirteenth
E01  17 century by virtue of an old rule for English nuns, cautioning them
E01  18 against devoting too much time to lace-making to the detriment of the
E01  19 poor! ^The earliest laces that survive today are, in fact, almost
E01  20 invariably those made by nuns for use on Church linen and vestments.
E01  21    |^It wasn't long, however, before less pious hands took up the
E01  22 lovely craft of lace-making. ^Lace became the servant of vanity and
E01  23 lent its rich decoration to robes and dresses and one thinks
E01  24 particularly of the extravagant Elizabethan ruffs and Carolean
E01  25 collars.
E01  26    |^Under Cromwell lace was dismissed as ungodly*- at least for the
E01  27 middle and lower classes. ^But the Puritan beauties managed to salve
E01  28 their consciences and at the same time indulge their love for
E01  29 beautiful lace by representing subjects from the Scriptures in their
E01  30 designs*- *'religious petticoats**', scoffed the satirists of the day.
E01  31    |^We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys that he was a great man
E01  32 for lace*- paying as much as *+3 for a lace collar. ^But this didn't
E01  33 mean he was prepared to do as much for his lady, for he records
E01  34 testily: ^*'My wife and I fell out about my not being willing to have
E01  35 her gown laced.**'
E01  36    |^We read, with sympathy, an advertisement in the reign of Charles
E01  37 *=2 stating: ^*'Lost: a lawn \1handkercher with a broad hem laced
E01  38 round with fine Point lace about four fingers broad**' and among the
E01  39 effects left by Nell Gwyn is an unpaid bill for *'scarlet satin shoes
E01  40 with silver lace**'.
E01  41    |^The records of these tender trifles are very touching but then
E01  42 lace does place upon everything a delicate sentiment. ^Lucky indeed
E01  43 are the families that possess a heritage of lace. ^A lace bridal veil
E01  44 handed down from mother to daughters, a lace-trimmed Christening
E01  45 **[SIC**] robe that each generation wears in turn*- these are proud
E01  46 possessions, linked to the exquisite lace-making of the past.
E01  47    |^But lace-making is by no means a lost art. ^It suffered a decline
E01  48 and fell into lamentably low standards in the fussy over-furnishing of
E01  49 the Victorian age but it would take more than a temporary lapse in
E01  50 good taste to destroy this lovely, viable craft.
E01  51    |^It has, in fact, readily adapted itself to modern tastes and the
E01  52 illustrations in the following pages will show how completely it is in
E01  53 sympathy with contemporary surroundings.
E01  54    |^It will be seen how, with bold design and rich colour, knitting,
E01  55 crochet and tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons can give
E01  56 striking individuality to many things in the home. ^Chairbacks,
E01  57 cushions, tablecloths, to mention only three*- how satisfying it is to
E01  58 avoid the ready-made in these and by one's own handiwork produce
E01  59 something that reflects true creative talent.
E01  60    |^The more delicate patterns and finer threads may be reserved to
E01  61 bring a light and lovely touch to personal possessions*- a lace border
E01  62 to a handkerchief, fine-lace insertion on a petticoat or blouse, a
E01  63 tatted edge to a collar; these add a charming, feminine distinction
E01  64 that nothing else can give.
E01  65    |^Although we assess lace-making as one of the feminine skills, a
E01  66 number of the well-loved traditional patterns that we follow today
E01  67 were, in fact, the brain-children of inventive men. ^For in the old
E01  68 order of things, men designed and worked lace as well as women and
E01  69 special schools were set up to teach lace-making not only to young
E01  70 girls, but to little boys as well.
E01  71    |^Whole families made their livelihood by lace-making and
E01  72 consequently a folklore of song, festival and courtship grew up around
E01  73 the lace industry. ^Those who are interested in its history will enjoy
E01  74 reading about the charming coquetteries the lace-makers practised.
E01  75 ^That their work required smooth white hands and delicate fingers gave
E01  76 them a refinement apart from the rest of the community.
E01  77    |^In presenting this book of lace-craft today, we remember with
E01  78 deep gratitude all who gave their skills to lace design and lace
E01  79 making. ^Not only do we remember them for their great accomplishments
E01  80 in a hard-working lifetime but we are grateful that they handed on
E01  81 their knowledge to others. ^For the whole structure of the craft is
E01  82 founded on inherited skills.
E01  83    |^We who love lace-craft hope that you will enjoy the work that
E01  84 this book offers in such variety*- but at the same time, may we make a
E01  85 plea that you will also guide other hands to pick up the threads?
E01  86    |^Only with the knowledge handed down by mother to daughter, by
E01  87 teacher to pupil, can this fascinating and deeply satisfying craft
E01  88 continue to give its rewards to younger generations.
E01  89 *<*6CROCHET STITCHES*>
E01  90    |^*0The art of crochet is very old indeed, but from the details
E01  91 available it has never been possible to give any accurate information
E01  92 as to its history. ^It would appear to have been associated with
E01  93 France, as its name is in fact the French word for hook, and a small
E01  94 hook is used in the making of crochet lace. ^During the sixteenth
E01  95 century a considerable amount of crochet was produced in the convents
E01  96 of Europe. ^Without doubt it was the nuns who carried the craft to
E01  97 Ireland. ^There it was developed into quite an elaborate and
E01  98 distinctive form with rosettes, leaves and lace fillings.
E01  99    |^During the time of Victoria this gentle craft was greatly abused.
E01 100 ^One can remember with horror the pictures of the overcrowded and
E01 101 over-embellished drawing-rooms complete with heavy crochet
E01 102 antimacassars, mantelpiece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles
E01 103 and numerous other crocheted pieces.
E01 104    |^It was some years after the Victorian period that designers
E01 105 realised the potentialities of the craft, and crochet was revived with
E01 106 designs suitable for contemporary trends. ^Crochet today has a variety
E01 107 of uses, and has even stepped into the field of high fashion. ^In some
E01 108 of the elegant boutiques of Paris hand-crocheted blouses, gossamer
E01 109 fine in texture, are sold at a very high price.
E01 110    |^With a little time and concentration the woman at home can
E01 111 produce fashion articles as elegant as those of Paris*- a blouse,
E01 112 delicate gloves or a fine edging for collar, cuffs or a handkerchief.
E01 113    |^In the home, crochet lace can be used to make tablecloths,
E01 114 traycloths and runners, and edgings from heavy to fine can fulfil a
E01 115 variety of functions.
E01 116    |^The art of crochet is not difficult and it is reasonably quick to
E01 117 work. ^In the following pages simple diagrams and instructions are
E01 118 given to enable the beginner to master all the essential crochet
E01 119 stitches. ^From these a selection of designs are included which show
E01 120 the use of the individual stitches. ^Finally, notes and designs are
E01 121 included on all the various styles of crochet, motifs, edgings,
E01 122 doilies, filet crochet, church laces, pineapple pattern and Irish
E01 123 crochet.

E01 140 ^For example, *'(5 \0ch, 1 \0dc in next \0dc) 5 times**' means to make
E01 141 all in parentheses 5 times in all.
E01 142 *<*2INSERTING CROCHET INTO LINEN*>
E01 143    |^*0First launder crochet and then pin to the required shape,
E01 144 ensuring that all lines of the crochet are accurate. ^Place crochet in
E01 145 correct position on linen and secure with pins. ^Run a line of basting
E01 146 stitches on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges which
E01 147 are to be attached to the linen. ^Remove crochet.
E01 148    |^Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen:
E01 149 ^(*1a*0) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches, the
E01 150 knotted part of the button stitch lying on the outside edge. ^Oversew
E01 151 crochet to button stitch. ^(*1b*0) Turn under a small hem, with fold
E01 152 lying on line of basting stitches. ^Work a row of \0dc all round this
E01 153 hem, with 3 \0dc at each corner. ^Oversew crochet to the \0dc.
E01 154 *<*2COATS MERCER-CROCHET*>
E01 155    |^*0A household word, Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities
E01 156 which are of the utmost importance to the worker. ^It washes
E01 157 beautifully, never loses its colour nor becomes *'stringy**', is very
E01 158 elastic and preserves the beauty of the design. ^It is easy to work
E01 159 with, soft, glossy and of uniform thickness*- it is the ideal crochet
E01 160 thread.
E01 161    |^Obtainable in the following shades:
E01 162 **[LIST**]
E01 163 *<*2HOW TO TURN YOUR WORK*>
E01 164    |^*0In crochet a certain number of chain stitches are added at the
E01 165 end of each row to bring work in position for the next row. ^Then the
E01 166 work is turned so that the reverse side is facing the worker. ^The
E01 167 number of turning chains depends upon the stitch with which you intend
E01 168 to begin the next row.
E01 169    |_Double crochet (\0dc)*- 1 \0ch to turn; half treble (\0hlf
E01 170 \0tr)*- 2 \0ch to turn; treble (\0tr)*- 3 \0ch to turn; double treble
E01 171 (\0dbl \0tr)*- 4 \0ch to turn; triple treble (\0trip \0tr)*- 5 \0ch to
E01 172 turn; quadruple treble (\0qua \0tr)*- 6 \0ch to turn; quintuple treble
E01 173 (\0quint \0tr)*- 7 \0ch to turn.
E01 174 *<*2CROCHET THREADS*>
E01 175    |^*0Remember that texture plays an important part in the beauty of
E01 176 crochet. ^The finer mercerised threads are more effective for the
E01 177 delicate designs used for tablecloths, doilies, edgings and
E01 178 accessories, while the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,
E01 179 chairbacks, luncheon mats, \0etc.
E01 180 *<*2CROCHET HOOKS*>
E01 181    |^*0Crochet hooks are made of steel, composition or bone. ^Steel
E01 182 crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0, the largest, to number 8,
E01 183 the smallest. ^Each size of hook is made for use with a certain size
E01 184 of thread. ^To ensure the correct results, it is important that you
E01 185 use the size of hook specified in the directions.
E01 186    |^These are the correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet:
E01 187 **[TABLE**]
E01 188 *<*6PRACTICE PIECES*>
E01 189    |^*0Directions are given for a small practice piece for each stitch
E01 190 that you learn. ^When you have become proficient in these stitches,
E01 191 attractive articles can be made from the directions included in this
E01 192 book.
E01 193 *<*4Step 1*- Make a Loop*>
E01 194    |^*01. Grasp thread near end between thumb and forefinger.
E01 195    |^2. Make a loop by lapping long thread over short thread.
E01 196    |^3. Hold loop in place between thumb and forefinger (\0*1Fig.
E01 197 *01).
E01 198 *<*4Step 2*>
E01 199    |^*01. Take hold of broad bar of hook as you would a pencil. ^Bring
E01 200 middle finger forward to rest near tip of hook.
E01 201    |^2. Insert hook through loop and under long thread. ^Catch long
E01 202 end of thread (\0*1Fig. *02). ^Draw loop through.
E01 203    |^3. Do not remove hook from thread.
E01 204 *<*4Step 3*>
E01 205    |^*0Pull short end and ball thread in opposite directions to bring
E01 206 loop close around the end of the hook, but not too tight (\0*1Fig.
E01 207 *03).
E01 208 *<*4Step 4*>
E01 209    |^*0Loop thread round little finger, across palm and behind
E01 210 forefinger (\0*1Fig. *04).
E01 211 *<*4Step 5*>
E01 212    |^*01. Grasp hook and loop between thumb and forefinger.
E01 213    |^2. Gently pull ball thread so that it lies around the fingers
E01 214 firmly but not tightly (\0*1Fig. *05).

E02   2 *<*6MAKING TAPERED LEGS*>
E02   3    |^*1A great deal of modern furniture has tapered legs, and in
E02   4 reproduction period pieces they are frequently used. ^The simpler
E02   5 varieties are extremely easy to work, the four sides being simply
E02   6 planed to give the required taper. ^In the more elaborate varieties,
E02   7 however, a toe is worked in the solid, and this certainly complicates
E02   8 the operation. ^It is not difficult, but calls for accurate
E02   9 workmanship. ^Perhaps the awkward feature is that the plane can only
E02  10 be used to a limited extent because the projecting toe prevents its
E02  11 being taken right through
E02  12    |
E02  13    |^*2WHEN A LEG *0has a simple taper the procedure of making it is
E02  14 straightforward. ^The wood is first planed parallel to the largest
E02  15 section, and pencil lines marking the beginning of the taper squared
E02  16 round on to all four sides. ^At the bottom end the extent of the taper
E02  17 is gauged in, again on all four sides. ^It is a help, too, if the
E02  18 marks are nicked in to the extent of about 1/8 \0in. (no more) on two
E02  19 opposite faces, though this is not essential. ^\0Fig. 2(A) shows the
E02  20 idea. ^Two opposite faces are now planed to the gauge lines, a panel
E02  21 or trying plane being used for legs of any length. ^For short ones a
E02  22 smoothing plane can be used.
E02  23    |^The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers on the newly
E02  24 planed surfaces, and these treated as before. ^It is unnecessary to
E02  25 mark the taper with the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth of
E02  26 the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces straight. ^A glance at the
E02  27 gauge marks at the bottom end reveals when the required amount has
E02  28 been removed, and if care is taken to stop the plane short of the
E02  29 squared pencil line at the top, the work will be accurate. ^The
E02  30 straight-edge can be used to test the straightness of the sides.
E02  31 ^Incidentally, it is better to complete any mortising that may be
E02  32 needed at the top before the tapering is begun.
E02  33    |^Some plain tapered legs have the taper on the two inner faces
E02  34 only, the outer surfaces being vertical as at (B), \0Fig. 1.
E02  35 *<*4Leg with toe*>
E02  36    |^*0To make a leg such as that at (D), \0Fig. 1, the square is
E02  37 first marked out as at (A), \0Fig. 3. ^Note that squared lines marking
E02  38 the top member of the toe are needed as well as the upper extent of
E02  39 the taper, and in this case it is necessary to mark in the line of the
E02  40 taper with pencil and straight-edge as at (B), \0Fig. 3. ^A saw cut is
E02  41 made at the upper toe line exactly down to the taper line, no farther.
E02  42 ^It is a help in guiding the saw if the line is squared round with the
E02  43 chisel, and a sloping groove chiselled on the waste side.
E02  44    |^With a keen, wide chisel the wood is now eased away above the toe
E02  45 as at (B). ^A mallet used to the chisel is a great help providing care
E02  46 is taken not to cut in too deeply. ^Finish off with hand pressure
E02  47 only, and make the final cut so that the notch is in alignment with
E02  48 the line of the taper.
E02  49    |^The rest of the taper can now be largely worked with the
E02  50 smoothing plane. ^It is necessary to work largely across the grain,
E02  51 holding the plane askew as otherwise it will not clear the toe.
E02  52 ^\0Fig. 4 shows the smoothing plane in use on the leg. ^To finish off
E02  53 it is often a help to use a wide flat file taken along the taper in
E02  54 the direction of the grain. ^The bullnose plane is also invaluable.
E02  55 ^This is followed by the scraper, and finally by glasspaper wrapped
E02  56 around a flat block used as at (C).
E02  57    |^The remaining two sides follow. ^It is necessary to draw in
E02  58 pencil lines on the newly tapered surfaces, but the method of cutting
E02  59 is exactly the same, (D), \0Fig. 3.
E02  60 *<*4The toe*>
E02  61    |^*0For convenience in handling it is convenient to work the hollow
E02  62 moulding before planing the taper of the toe. ^Mark in with pencil the
E02  63 depth of the hollow, using the pencil and finger as a gauge, and cut a
E02  64 chamfer with a keen chisel on all four sides as at (D). ^Cut inwards
E02  65 with the chisel from each side so that the far corner does not
E02  66 splinter. ^The cut is taken down to the two pencil lines.
E02  67    |^To work the hollow a rat-tail file can be used in its entirety as
E02  68 at (E), or the bulk of the waste can be removed with a small gouge,
E02  69 and the file used to finish off. ^In any case glasspaper wrapped
E02  70 around a shaped rubber is used to smooth the hollow finally. ^To
E02  71 complete the toe the smoothing plane can be used to form the taper.
E02  72 ^Finish the two opposite sides first, and follow with the two
E02  73 remaining faces.
E02  74 *<*4Machined legs*>
E02  75    |^*0It will be realised that those who have a machine planer can
E02  76 work a plain tapered leg in its entirety on it, and also a fairly
E02  77 close approximation of the leg with toe. ^For instance, the design at
E02  78 (F), \0Fig. 1, is formed entirely on the planer. ^The process is shown
E02  79 in \0Figs. 5 and 7.
E02  80    |^The rear table is set level with the tips of the cutters as in
E02  81 normal planing, but the front one is lowered by an amount equal to the
E02  82 full depth of the taper. ^Two stops are fixed to the fence to limit
E02  83 the travel of the leg. ^The square of wood is held level with the near
E02  84 stop and is lowered on to the revolving cutters. ^The wood is pushed
E02  85 forward until it reaches the back stop. ^Note the use of the pusher
E02  86 stick as in \0Fig. 7. ^Each side is dealt with in the same way.
E02  87    |^When the taper has to begin at the extreme top of the leg, either
E02  88 the leg must be cut about 1/4 \0in. long, or the taper must be started
E02  89 about a similar amount below the top and finished afterwards by hand.
E02  90 ^The reason for this is that when the square is lowered on to the
E02  91 revolving cutters at the start of the cut it must rest on the lip of
E02  92 the back table as in \0Fig. 6. ^Unless it does so it will be grabbed
E02  93 by the cutters and chewed down to the extent of the full depth. ^Apart
E02  94 from spoiling the leg it may easily cause an accident and may stall
E02  95 the machine.
E02  96 *<*6WHAT DOES IT COST TO START WOODWORK?*>
E02  97    |^*2ONLY THOSE WHO *0have done woodwork for any length of time can
E02  98 realise the fascination it has. ^Many a man has started to make
E02  99 something in wood, possibly out of economic necessity, and has then
E02 100 continued to do woodwork from the sheer joy of doing it. ^Something
E02 101 begun in compulsion has become a thing of lasting satisfaction.
E02 102    |^But why woodwork in particular? ^Well, there are many reasons.
E02 103 ^Wood is in good and common supply; it lends itself to making
E02 104 innumerable useful household items*- furniture, fitments, garden
E02 105 items, toys, \0etc.; it enables results to be obtained fairly quickly;
E02 106 it is less expensive than most other materials; it is a pleasant
E02 107 material to work with; and, although it does create a certain amount
E02 108 of mess, it is all clean and easily cleared away.
E02 109    |^Of course a certain amount of equipment is necessary, and this
E02 110 brings us straightway to the question of what it costs to start
E02 111 woodwork. ^Most households have a few basic tools*- probably a hammer,
E02 112 pincers, screwdriver, \0etc., but one does not get far with these. ^We
E02 113 have, therefore, considered the matter partly from what is essential
E02 114 or desirable to start woodwork, but taking into account the long-term
E02 115 likelihood of (a) better class work being done, and (b) the
E02 116 possibility of power being used to supplement hand tools.
E02 117    |^This last point is certainly important because almost everyone
E02 118 has come to recognise that machines are not only an economic
E02 119 necessity, but that a great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
E02 120 installation of a power tool. ^As an elementary example, surely no one
E02 121 can pretend to enjoy ripping out parts from hardwood. ^Most men would
E02 122 unhesitatingly use a machine if it were available.
E02 123 *<*4Choice of Tools*>
E02 124    |^*0Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin with
E02 125 what we have called a *1bare minimum kit. ^*0Probably most men have
E02 126 some of the tools already. ^It will enable a man to make simple,
E02 127 straight-forward things, and in any case may be regarded as a good
E02 128 beginning to which other tools can be added as the need arises. ^The
E02 129 nature of the work will probably dictate the additions to be made, but
E02 130 as a guide we have given a *1fuller kit *0which increases the range of
E02 131 things that can be made enormously. ^As a still further development,
E02 132 we follow with a *1good basic kit, *0which includes the fuller kit
E02 133 (which in its turn, of course, includes the bare minimum kit). ^With
E02 134 this the vast majority of jobs can be done, though for advanced
E02 135 cabinet work the necessity for certain special tools will become
E02 136 obvious. ^Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and machines, the
E02 137 choice of which will depend partly upon the space available in the
E02 138 workshop, the amount one is prepared to pay, and the type of work a
E02 139 man normally does.
E02 140    |^First, however, a word of advice generally. ^Do not buy so-called
E02 141 cheap tools or machines. ^They never are cheap in the long run. ^They
E02 142 may be inaccurate, the steel may be soft (or possibly too hard) so
E02 143 that the edge either crumbles or is brittle, or they may not be robust
E02 144 enough for the work they have to do. ^Most tools have to lead an
E02 145 intensive life, and faults in design or quality soon become apparent.
E02 146 ^It is far better to pay the fair price for a tool of good quality,
E02 147 and not handicap yourself from the start. ^To put it in a slightly
E02 148 different way, do not allow yourself to blame the tools when the job
E02 149 does not turn out quite right!
E02 150    |^If this advice is true of hand tools, it is still more true of
E02 151 machines. ^The whole nature of a machine is that, properly set-up and
E02 152 used, it will do accurate work. ^If it fails to do this it is worse
E02 153 than useless, and may be dangerous. ^This is not meant to imply that
E02 154 only the best precision machines are of any use. ^Some of the less
E02 155 expensive types intended for home use are reliable, especially taking
E02 156 into account the limited use to which they are put. ^It is to be
E02 157 admitted, however, that a few drill attachments have been put on the
E02 158 market which are unsound in design and poor in quality, and should be
E02 159 avoided.
E02 160    |^A point that may occur to the reader is that the possible later
E02 161 purchase of a machine may render some of his hand tools redundant.
E02 162 ^This may be the case in one or two instances, but for the greater
E02 163 part it does not apply. ^For instance, rebating can be done on the
E02 164 circular saw, but it leaves a sawn finish, and to make the surface
E02 165 smooth it is necessary to follow with the rebate plane. ^The latter is
E02 166 thus still needed, although the bulk of the work is done on the saw.
E02 167 *<*6TOOL CABINET*>
E02 168    |^*1Many men with only limited accommodation have to do their
E02 169 woodwork on the kitchen table. ^Providing this is sound, some
E02 170 perfectly good work can be done on it, but the usual problems are
E02 171 those of the vice, the bench stop, and storage place for tools. ^The
E02 172 combined bench top and tool cupboard shown here has been specially
E02 173 designed and made for *2WOODWORKER *1readers who have this difficulty.
E02 174 ^When folded up flat as in \0Fig. 2 it can be stored away in a
E02 175 cupboard or outhouse, but when opened out on the table there is a
E02 176 roomy bench top of 4 \0ft. by 17 \0in., and good accommodation for the
E02 177 tools.

E03   2 *<*4More Power To Your Elbow*>
E03   3 **[EDITORIAL**]
E03   4    |^T*2IME *0saved is money saved, they say; and when holes have to
E03   5 be bored an electric drill will certainly save one heck of a lot of
E03   6 time. ^But there is much more to it than just that, for in the past
E03   7 few years these compact power tools have been developed to a stage
E03   8 where they can tackle almost any job you care to name. ^Grinding,
E03   9 paint mixing, precision turning or polishing floors*- it's a fair bet
E03  10 that there's a drill accessory designed for the purpose.
E03  11    |^Nowhere is a power drill more useful than in the garage, where it
E03  12 can form the basis of a comprehensive workshop and so provide near
E03  13 professional facilities for maintenance and repair work. ^But however
E03  14 ingenious an attachment may be, it can only be as good as its power
E03  15 unit. ^So, before whaling in to your bank account, have a good look
E03  16 around, comparing specifications and prices and ensuring that the
E03  17 drill you fancy will drive the attachments in which you may be
E03  18 interested.
E03  19    |^All the popular makes of drill, produced to exacting standards,
E03  20 offer a high degree of reliability and an efficient after-sales
E03  21 service. ^On what, then, does choice depend? ^Well, on weight, for one
E03  22 thing; or on style. ^One maker discovered that eye-appeal increased
E03  23 his sales and so you might fall for a charming pastel shade! ^Then,
E03  24 too, there are practical features to be considered, such as an
E03  25 automatic cut-out, or double insulation which does away with the need
E03  26 for earthing.
E03  27    |^The price? ^Anything from about *+7 upwards for the drill
E03  28 itself*- and, unless you hold yourself in check, up to ten times that
E03  29 amount for accessories! ^But many of the manufacturers have taken the
E03  30 sting out of the cash side by operating their own hire-purchase
E03  31 schemes.
E03  32    |^A buyers' guide to drills suitable for the do-it-yourself
E03  33 enthusiast is appended, and somewhere in that list is a power tool to
E03  34 meet your needs. ^But when buying, check that the operating voltage
E03  35 (marked on a plate on the drill body) is suited to your mains supply.
E03  36 ^It is also a good idea to spin the chuck by hand, to ensure that the
E03  37 spindle is free-running and has survived the trip from factory to
E03  38 dealer without damage.
E03  39    |^You will want to try it out as soon as you arrive home, but curb
E03  40 your impatience for a while. ^Check, first, that the plug is properly
E03  41 connected. ^If the green-covered cable runs to the earth pin, red to
E03  42 the pin marked *"L**" and black to the pin marked *"N,**" then
E03  43 everything is as it should be.
E03  44    |^Once you have bought your drill, then it is only common sense to
E03  45 look after it properly, and simple maintenance will keep it in good
E03  46 order almost indefinitely.
E03  47    |^Say the power-drill makers, 75 per cent of major breakdowns can
E03  48 be traced to neglect of the carbon-brush gear. ^So it pays to carry
E03  49 out regular inspection of the brushes, replacing them, in the grade
E03  50 and size recommended by the maker, when they have worn to a third of
E03  51 their original length. ^As with motor-cycle dynamo brushes, care
E03  52 should be taken to see that they bed down properly on the commutator,
E03  53 with the spring pressure sufficient to keep the brushes in close
E03  54 contact.
E03  55    |^Ventilation holes in the drill body must be kept free from dust,
E03  56 screws should be checked for tightness regularly, and*- an obvious
E03  57 point, maybe*- cable leads must be inspected from time to time for
E03  58 signs of fraying or of faulty connections.
E03  59    |^Go steady on greasing and work strictly to the instruction book,
E03  60 for too much grease can bring a train of trouble. ^It could cause the
E03  61 motor to overheat. ^Overgreasing the rear bearing could foul the
E03  62 commutator. ^And if there is too much in the gear box a stream of
E03  63 surplus might be blown into your face!
E03  64    |^If your garage is damp, play safe and keep the drill in the house
E03  65 when not in use, for damp is one of the worst enemies of an electric
E03  66 motor. ^And when storing the drill, coil the cable neatly without
E03  67 kinks or sharp bends.
E03  68    |^When removing the chuck or setting up the tool for a specific
E03  69 job, always follow the maker's recommendation. ^Never push a
E03  70 screwdriver or other tool into the body of the drill in order to jam
E03  71 the shaft. ^You can't see what damage you may be causing, nor will it
E03  72 show until the current is switched on. ^And should the drill give
E03  73 trouble send it back to the manufacturer's service depot, for
E03  74 do-it-yourself repairs are ticklish unless you are a skilled
E03  75 electrician.
E03  76    |^Factories place great emphasis on accident prevention, and it is
E03  77 equally important that safety habits should be developed in the home
E03  78 workshop. ^Wear overalls, for a start, so that there is no loose
E03  79 clothing to be caught up in moving parts (ties and shirt-sleeves, for
E03  80 example, are particularly vulnerable). ^And it is as well to wear
E03  81 goggles*- your motor-cycle goggles will serve admirably*- when pieces
E03  82 of metal are likely to be flying about. ^Petrol, or any other
E03  83 inflammable liquid, should be removed from the working area, for a
E03  84 spark from a grinding or sanding wheel can start a fire.
E03  85    |^A good tip is to disconnect the tool when setting up an
E03  86 accessory, or making any other change. ^Also, if your drill has a
E03  87 locking button incorporated in the switch, it must be released.
E03  88 ^Incidentally, if the drill cable is plugged into a switched socket,
E03  89 in case of emergency the simplest thing is to flick off the switch; if
E03  90 something has gone wrong with the drill you won't want to fumble
E03  91 around trying to release the locking button!
E03  92    |^Finally, never, never pull a drill around by its power lead. ^It
E03  93 is so easy to pull a connection loose*- and you won't find out about
E03  94 it until you pick up the drill and try to switch on.
E03  95    |^Having bought your drill, how do you set about using it? ^And
E03  96 which of those alluring attachments are most useful for the
E03  97 motor-cyclist's workshop? ^Well, we'll go into the practical side of
E03  98 things next week.
E03  99 **[ILLUSTRATIONS**]
E03 100 *<*6NOT SUCH A BORING JOB...!*>
E03 101 **[EDITORIAL**]
E03 102    |^F*2ROM *0the display of attachments in a hardware shop window,
E03 103 you might well conclude that there is no longer such a tool as an
E03 104 electric drill, pure and simple; instead, it has become a miniature
E03 105 machine-shop powerhouse. ^But for all that, the primary function of a
E03 106 power drill is*- well, to drill; and with its aid anyone can bore
E03 107 holes quickly and easily. ^But there are holes and holes, and to make
E03 108 a proper job of things, while at the same time prolonging the life of
E03 109 the drill bit, it is worth while taking a little trouble.
E03 110    |^So, for a start, we can ignore those cheap (and usually foreign)
E03 111 sets of twist drills on the chain-store tool counters. ^Almost
E03 112 certainly they are of carbon steel*- good enough for a hand brace,
E03 113 maybe, but you would be lucky to use them more than once in a power
E03 114 tool. ^No, what you need are high-speed-steel drills, more expensive
E03 115 in first cost but cheaper in the long run; these can tackle most
E03 116 jobbing work, but you will want yet another type of drill if there is
E03 117 glass, concrete or masonry to be drilled.
E03 118    |^A good high-speed drill will have the letters {0HS} and the
E03 119 diameter stamped on the shank. ^But should there be no marking and you
E03 120 are in doubt, there is a simple way of identifying the material.
E03 121 ^Touch the drill shank lightly against a grinding wheel and note the
E03 122 colour of the sparks. ^If red, then it is high-speed steel; if yellow,
E03 123 carbon steel.
E03 124    |^Now for the actual operation*- and that should always begin by
E03 125 using a centre-punch to mark the job at the precise spot to be
E03 126 drilled. ^That acts as a guide for the drill point and stops it
E03 127 wandering from the required position.
E03 128    |^A comfortable working stance is essential, both to lessen
E03 129 physical strain and to achieve accuracy. ^That's where a bench
E03 130 drilling assembly scores heavily, a simple pillar fixture which
E03 131 converts the power tool into a bench drill. ^Fixed to such a stand,
E03 132 the drill can be brought to the job with great precision, while
E03 133 pressure is increased easily by using the spring-loaded lever provided
E03 134 with the assembly. ^In addition, the stand baseplate offers a firm and
E03 135 smooth working surface. ^In some of the drill accessories available
E03 136 the bench stand also forms part of a lathe assembly, but Black and
E03 137 Decker market a self-contained bench conversion at *+4.
E03 138    |^When using a bench stand, it is advisable to interpose a block of
E03 139 wood between the baseplate and the job, so that when the drill point
E03 140 breaks through it enters the wood and not the plate.
E03 141    |^But whether the power drill is hand-held or used in a bench
E03 142 assembly, let your eyes and ears act as trouble detectors. ^Listen to
E03 143 the drill's high-pitched whine, which will drop a tone or two as it
E03 144 bites into the job; but should the note turn to a low growl too much
E03 145 pressure is being applied*- so ease up a little, to obviate
E03 146 overloading and, possibly, burning out the motor.
E03 147    |^Watch the swarf as it spins away from the drill flutes. ^With
E03 148 mild steel and other softish metals splinters and dust are a sign that
E03 149 more pressure is required, so increase it until good, fat shavings are
E03 150 twirling out from the job. ^They may be coming from one flute only,
E03 151 and if so the drill has been incorrectly ground.
E03 152    |^The drill point and cutting edges have also a tale to tell. ^If
E03 153 the point has blunted, then the pressure has been too great. ^If the
E03 154 outer corners of the cutting edges are wearing, or turning blue, the
E03 155 drill speed is too high. ^Regrinding and setting a drill is really a
E03 156 job for an expert and beginners are advised to take them to a light
E03 157 engineering shop for the proper treatment.
E03 158    |^Speed is an important factor in the life of a twist drill. ^The
E03 159 average domestic power tool operates at around 2,750 {0r.p.m.},
E03 160 which although right for powering many of the attachments is a little
E03 161 too fast for drilling some materials. ^Used at the right speed, drills
E03 162 will have a longer life and not require frequent regrinding. ^The
E03 163 basic rule is this: the harder the material and the larger the drill
E03 164 diameter, the slower should the speed be.
E03 165    |^Though the simpler tools have no inbuilt method of changing
E03 166 speed, attachments are available which can step-up or reduce drilling
E03 167 speed to bring it into line with your needs. ^One, from Bridges at *+2
E03 168 4\0s 10\0d, gives a four-to-one speed reduction at the turn of a knob.
E03 169 ^Another, by Black and Decker at *+3 7\0s 6\0d, will not only double
E03 170 or halve the standard speed at will, but will also carry the drive at
E03 171 right angles for reaching awkward spots.
E03 172    |^As an instance, when a 1/4\0in drill is used on cast iron,
E03 173 spindle speed should be about 750 {0r.p.m.}, and on brass, 3,100
E03 174 {0r.p.m.} ^Makers of twist drills often issue tables of suitable
E03 175 speeds for various materials; Intal (Watery Street, Sheffield, 3) will
E03 176 supply a handy little booklet on the subject on request. ^Where a
E03 177 drill speed may be quoted in peripheral feet per minute, don't be
E03 178 alarmed. ^A simple formula
E03 179 **[FORMULA**] will give you spindle {0r.p.m.}
E03 180    |^Drill longevity and lubrication go together. ^Some materials*-
E03 181 wood, cast iron, brass and Bakelite among them*- are drilled *"dry,**"
E03 182 but for most purposes a good all-round lubricant is soluble oil. ^One
E03 183 tip is to keep a supply in a polythene bottle with a small hole in the
E03 184 cap, and squirt it on to the drill as the job proceeds.
E03 185    |^In unskilled hands drills are easily broken. ^So for the
E03 186 inexperienced, stub drills*- shorter than average and less likely to
E03 187 bend or break*- are a good buy (but be sure that they are long enough
E03 188 for the job you want to do). ^Jamming is a common cause of drill
E03 189 breakage, and that is most often the case when a drill is breaking
E03 190 through at the far side of the work.

E04   2 *<*5Instructions for making *6CHILD'S HIGH CHAIR*>
E04   3    |^*4H*2ERE *0is a project that will be welcomed by the family man
E04   4 or father-to-be. ^Unlike many commercial articles, this chair is
E04   5 solidly built and capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
E04   6 most destructive youngster. ^Almost any available timber can be used
E04   7 but Parana pine is recommended, being cheap, easy to work, and taking
E04   8 a good finish.
E04   9    |^Start by making the two side frames from 1 \0in. by 1 1/4 \0in.
E04  10 planed timber as shown in \0Fig. 1. ^Although the timber will have
E04  11 already been machine planed, remember to go over each piece with a
E04  12 smoothing plane, otherwise the marks left by the cutters will show up
E04  13 after painting. ^The dimensions given enable the feeding tray to slide
E04  14 over a 30 \0in. table, but the height can be altered if required. ^All
E04  15 the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned, which should
E04  16 nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat appearance.
E04  17    |^The side frames are joined by four cross pieces each 1 1/4 \0in.
E04  18 by 1/2 \0in. by 14 \0in. which fit into the recesses (C), cut to fit
E04  19 them. ^See \0Fig. 2. ^These are then glued and pinned into place. ^A
E04  20 similar piece of 1 \0in. by 1 1/4 \0in. by 14 \0in. timber is fixed
E04  21 across the end of the feeding tray as seen in \0Fig. 3 which also
E04  22 shows how a piece of hardboard is covered with plastic material for
E04  23 easy cleaning and then fixed underneath the frame with panel pins to
E04  24 complete the feeding tray. ^Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
E04  25 fits up against the front legs of the chair.
E04  26    |^The seat rests across the upper two cross pieces and is made of
E04  27 1/2 \0in. plywood glued and panel pinned in position, measurements
E04  28 being taken directly from the work.
E04  29    |^\0Fig. 4 shows the framework for the back which is made from 1
E04  30 1/4 \0in. by 1/2 \0in. timber. ^The amount of the backward tilt and
E04  31 also the height is left to personal choice and the width is best taken
E04  32 directly from the work to ensure a good fit. ^Fix the piece A to the
E04  33 sides first with glue and panel pins and then fit the frame together
E04  34 with the piece B temporarily in place on the chair frame. ^Decide on
E04  35 the required angle of slope, keeping B flat on the chair seat, and
E04  36 mark off the exact position of B on the side pieces. ^These can then
E04  37 be cut at the correct angle and B is glued and nailed in place. ^A
E04  38 piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned to the frame and its edges
E04  39 planed off flush. ^Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
E04  40 screws driven from the inside.
E04  41    |^ The footrest is a piece of timber 14 \0in. long and about 1/2
E04  42 \0in. by 4 \0in. attached to the front legs with a pair of angle irons
E04  43 as shown in \0Fig. 5. ^When determining the position of the footrest,
E04  44 do not place too near the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs.
E04  45    |^To complete the job, screw two fittings to the inside of the
E04  46 chair arms about 2 1/2 \0in. from the back to hold the baby's safety
E04  47 harness. ^These can be made by shaping and soldering two pieces of
E04  48 stout wire as shown in \0Fig. 6. ^Make sure that these are well
E04  49 secured as they will have to withstand considerable pulling as the
E04  50 child becomes older.
E04  51 *<*4Finishing touches*>
E04  52    |^*0Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes with
E04  53 plastic wood. ^Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole framework and
E04  54 round off any sharp edges (such as the edge of the seat, feeding tray,
E04  55 \0etc). ^Fill the grain with a woodfiller in the usual way and paint
E04  56 the frame in a suitable pastel shade, using a contrasting colour for
E04  57 the seat and the back which can be decorated with a suitable nursery
E04  58 transfer. ^Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
E04  59 if junior decides to bite the chair. ^Finally, it is as well to cover
E04  60 the footrest with rubber or any such protective material that might be
E04  61 available as otherwise the paint would soon be scratched off.

E04  63 *<*6BUILD AN 8\0FT. PRAM DINGHY*>
E04  64 *<*5By \0F. Cordner*>
E04  65    |^*4B*2UILDING *0your own boat is a most satisfying and worthwhile
E04  66 project. ^Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little rowing dinghy
E04  67 many of which I have built and sold. ^It is especially designed for
E04  68 simplicity in construction, cheapness and lightness of weight, and
E04  69 measures approximately 8 \0ft. by 4 \0ft. ^She weighs only 60 \0lb.
E04  70 but can carry three people and an outboard motor with a comfortable
E04  71 margin of freeboard.
E04  72    |^I have built many of these little craft in this country and
E04  73 particularly in Canada for use by commercial salmon fishermen in
E04  74 Victoria {0B.C.} ^Over there the cost is about $17.00. ^The last
E04  75 one I made here cost about *+6 0\0s. 0\0d. ^Prices of course depend on
E04  76 local availability of materials and, there are many ways in which
E04  77 costs can be saved. ^For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails
E04  78 in place of screws. ^We just bend them over and clamp firmly by using
E04  79 a hammer on each side. ^Over here I've always used brass screws, which
E04  80 are more expensive.
E04  81    |^The first job is to make your moulds. ^In \0Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4
E04  82 \0in. five-ply, but to save money any scrap may be used, and if this
E04  83 is nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked and cut to
E04  84 shape later.
E04  85    |^If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor the moulds,
E04  86 make a frame of rough lumber as shown in \0Fig. 2. ^The main idea is
E04  87 to have the moulds standing as rigid as possible, for it is on these
E04  88 you will be building and shaping your little craft, upside-down.
E04  89    |^For cheapness I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
E04  90 Columbia. ^This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure a
E04  91 permanently water proof glue line. ^Be sure to see that the edge bears
E04  92 the mark, {0*2P.M.B.C.} *0Exterior. ^This may be bought at any good
E04  93 timber merchants. ^The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply wood
E04  94 of the same make, or oak or mahogany. ^For the last one I made, I used
E04  95 the two flaps from an old mahogany table which I bought at a sale for
E04  96 one shilling. ^I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
E04  97 rowing this dinghy (\0Fig. 3). ^They are very simple, cheap and easy
E04  98 to make.
E04  99    |^As will be seen from the plan there is only a single gunwale on
E04 100 the outside. ^I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada is
E04 101 difficult to obtain here and expensive. ^I overcome this in another
E04 102 way as shown in \0Fig. 4. ^By putting in the extra gunwale on the
E04 103 inside, it improves the appearance and strengthens the boat and makes
E04 104 it possible to fit blocks for the rowlocks.
E04 105    |^Note that all contacting surfaces must be glued together with
E04 106 waterproof resin glue (I use Casco) as well as being screwed together.
E04 107    |^Build the pram upside-down. ^Since it has no transverse frames,
E04 108 moulds are required at stations 2 and 6, to serve in conjunction with
E04 109 the two transoms to maintain the shape of the sides and bottom until
E04 110 they are fastened together into a strong rigid unit.
E04 111    |^Cut the moulds and the transoms to shape as in the detailed
E04 112 drawings. ^If you have a wooden floor you can use *'A**' frames
E04 113 fastened to the floor if not, use a strong horizontal frame that will
E04 114 sit firmly on the ground or concrete floor. ^I use a heavy old base as
E04 115 in \0Fig. 2.
E04 116    |^The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to correspond to the
E04 117 sides and bottom of the boat. ^Don't forget to cut out on each side of
E04 118 each mould to allow for the chines to rest in these notches, as they
E04 119 are not fastened to the moulds, which will only be used whilst the
E04 120 hull is under construction.
E04 121    |^The chine is the long stringer on each side which is joined to
E04 122 both transoms and lies in the grooves cut in the moulds. ^Each chine
E04 123 is made of oak, ash, spruce or any long grained flexible wood. ^I
E04 124 prefer spruce when available.
E04 125    |^As will be seen in the plan, the transoms have a frame 1 \0in. by
E04 126 1 \0in. on each side. ^The chines are morticed into this and butt up
E04 127 against the transom. ^Start at the bow and spring them both at the
E04 128 same time over the slots cut in the moulds and into the notches cut
E04 129 for this purpose in the stern or after transom framing. ^Glue, screw
E04 130 and make fast.
E04 131    |^The skeleton of the boat will now take shape, and this is the
E04 132 time to check before making fast to see that nothing is distorted.
E04 133 ^Ensure that the outside measurements from transom to transom are
E04 134 equal on each side and that the transoms are parallel horizontally.
E04 135 ^Next bevel the chines with a plane so that the bottom will fit
E04 136 snugly.
E04 137    |^Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the plan
E04 138 measurements but leave sufficient margin for planing after fixing to
E04 139 the boat. ^Use your two lengths of 8 \0ft. by 4 \0ft. ply for this
E04 140 purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from the other. ^If care
E04 141 is taken not to waste the ply, plenty of material is left over for the
E04 142 thwarts.
E04 143    |^Having trimmed up the chines, we are now ready to plank the
E04 144 sides. ^Start again at the bows, clamping into position with a *'D**'
E04 145 clamp. ^Bend round the frame to the stern and clamp there. ^If you
E04 146 have a third clamp use it in the centre as well. ^After generously
E04 147 covering with glue, screw the sides to the transom framing and the
E04 148 chine. ^Use 5/8 by \0No. 4 gauge screws (brass) or nail with inch and
E04 149 a quarter galvanized nails, if you are doing it that way. ^Use flat
E04 150 head screws about 4 \0in. apart and do not counter-sink in the 1/4
E04 151 \0in. ply. ^Make a very small hole for the screw to allow for a good
E04 152 grip. ^Remember to glue before screwing.
E04 153    |^Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom, which is cut in one
E04 154 piece. ^It should overlap just a trifle; this can be cleaned up later.
E04 155 ^As you are screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
E04 156 necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with the screws. ^I
E04 157 prefer spacing screws 3 \0in. apart for the bottom, both for screwing
E04 158 to the chines and the bottom shaped transom facing. ^Again, don't
E04 159 forget to glue.
E04 160    |^Now put on the keel and the rubbing strakes and you are ready to
E04 161 lift the boat off the moulds. ^You won't want them again for this
E04 162 boat, so shift them right out of the way. ^Place the boat right side
E04 163 up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for working.
E04 164    |^Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts (seats) taking care to
E04 165 reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats with vertical members
E04 166 as shown in the plans. ^Make the four blocks for the rowlocks and mark
E04 167 their positions before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
E04 168 a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside (gunwale) one to fit
E04 169 the block. ^I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
E04 170 with copper nails and roves. ^It greatly improves the appearance and
E04 171 the strength.
E04 172    |^Paint with good marine primer, undercoat and at least one coat of
E04 173 finishing paint.

E05   2 *<*4News of the new furniture*>
E05   3    |^A *0wind of change has blown through the cobwebs in the
E05   4 drawing-offices of Britain's furniture makers, and affected them as
E05   5 deeply as it has our politicos. ^An optimist might even persuade
E05   6 himself that there are signs of the birth of a new and fine *'English
E05   7 Modern style**'.
E05   8    |^Our shame in the past has been that the talent that undoubtedly
E05   9 existed was not used. ^In despair, some of our younger people, fresh
E05  10 from the best design schools in the world, drifted off to Scandinavian
E05  11 and other countries where they felt their ideas and ideals were more
E05  12 appreciated, or worse, drifted into other work where their years of
E05  13 training and experience were lost for ever.
E05  14    |^In the post-war years, furniture of all sorts*- beautiful and
E05  15 trashy*- has been pouring into this country from abroad. ^Britain has
E05  16 become almost the world's clearing-house. ^When we were in Denmark
E05  17 recently, two furniture-makers told us that Britain took two-thirds of
E05  18 all the furniture they exported. ^When this furniture *1was *0good, it
E05  19 was so much better than anything we have been producing, that it made
E05  20 an immediate mark and proved a vast economic success. ^Now there are
E05  21 very real signs that our own manufacturers have taken note of the
E05  22 profits and, rather like the United States car manufacturers with
E05  23 their *'compact**' cars, are hitting back at these foreign influences.
E05  24 ^Our home market now has the extra cash and extra influences from
E05  25 magazines and the daily press to make them more discriminating.
E05  26 ^Manufacturers who, a few years ago, were happy to produce one model
E05  27 that then sold successfully for years, are now willingly employing
E05  28 designers wishful to introduce new ideas.
E05  29    |^The new design policy is being vigorously adopted by some
E05  30 manufacturers, only half believingly by others, and then for only part
E05  31 of their range. ^But the signs are good.
E05  32    |^The Council of Industrial Design, of course, must get much of the
E05  33 credit for this awakening of public interest in design, for they show
E05  34 things by native manufacturers only. ^This credit must also be shared
E05  35 with a few brave manufacturers who have been making very soundly
E05  36 designed furniture (and with their own money) for years. ^Now, at
E05  37 last, more and more manufacturers are recognizing there is not only a
E05  38 certain cachet in the little black-and-white Design Centre label, but
E05  39 that would-be buyers do look for this signal. ^Every day, for six days
E05  40 a week, over three thousand people visit the Design Centre in the
E05  41 Haymarket, to see what Britain can make; which goes to prove what
E05  42 critics have said over and over again*- if people demand the best,
E05  43 eventually they will get it.
E05  44    |^What's new? ^Exciting and unusual materials and combinations of
E05  45 materials are the keynote of the 1961 furniture collections.
E05  46    |^Robin Day has designed for Hille something we have long awaited
E05  47 and only been able to get from French sources, a truly super-elegant
E05  48 dinner-wagon or tea-trolley, happily marrying blackened steel,
E05  49 mahogany and stainless steel, with trays in white plastic. ^This piece
E05  50 is a rich and rare combination of visual and tactile delights.
E05  51    |^Aidron Duckworth, another of our top-line designers, shows new
E05  52 metallic possibilities in his new designs for the Holborn Metal Works.
E05  53 ^This is mainly contract work, and the new and luxurious Londoner
E05  54 Hotel has ordered his armchair, {0*2HCI}, *0for its guests. ^We hope
E05  55 they can evolve a less asceptic-sounding **[SIC**] title for their
E05  56 chair before long.
E05  57    |^Nigel Walters, Head of the Furniture Design School of the Central
E05  58 School of Arts and Crafts, has also produced a dining-chair of great
E05  59 simplicity and beauty for the *'Braemar**' range, by Wrighton.
E05  60    |^Four young students of the Central School, with the blessing of
E05  61 their tutor, have formed themselves into a group called *'Design
E05  62 Associates**'. ^Their grounding in design has been sound. ^Now they
E05  63 hope to offer us a comprehensive industrial, furniture and interior
E05  64 design service. ^They claim that traditional or derivative influences
E05  65 will be avoided in their work, and insist that design in this country
E05  66 should be far more adventurous than it is at present. ^Fighting words.
E05  67 ^We shall see. ^Certainly we side with them wholeheartedly against the
E05  68 wholesale lifting of design that has been such a source of
E05  69 embarrassment for years. ^But we suggest that they should not wholly
E05  70 discount our design heritage, for there is much there for those who
E05  71 are bright enough to learn*- as the Danes have shown with their
E05  72 borrowings from our own eighteenth-century tradition.
E05  73    |^We show some of the work of our design schools on page 73.
E05  74    |^*'Danad Design**' is the name of another group of artists,
E05  75 designers and architects who have banded together to brave the apathy
E05  76 of some stores' buyers*- the omni-present barrier between the
E05  77 enlightened manufacturer and the public. ^These rebels have a firm
E05  78 belief in the possibilities of decorative plastic laminates in
E05  79 furniture design. ^The originality of the graphic designs they
E05  80 incorporate is likely to make its main appeal to a sophisticated and
E05  81 thus restricted market. ^We shall see. ^The techniques they use are
E05  82 much the same as those used by Fornasetti and Philip Pound, but the
E05  83 designs are supremely original and a good deal bolder.
E05  84    |^Interest has been shown in *'Danad**' furniture by the stores in
E05  85 which one expects to see exciting and experimental work. ^Examples
E05  86 should be in the stores this month.
E05  87 *<*6SHOPPING*>
E05  88    |^*4Figgio flameware *0from Norway was our choice when we paid a
E05  89 visit to \0R Pochin at 32 Granby \0St, Leicester. ^Designed for use on
E05  90 either gas or electric stoves, these dishes can be transferred
E05  91 straight from the oven to the table. ^They come in gay colours on a
E05  92 white ground and there are many shapes and sizes to choose from. ^The
E05  93 small dish with a handle in our photograph costs 9\0s 3\0d; the
E05  94 casserole with lid is 35\0s 6\0d and the oblong dish 22\0s 7\0d. ^This
E05  95 is an excellent hardware store where you can buy anything from the
E05  96 most mundane of kitchen gadgets to a luxury bathroom fitting.
E05  97 ^Fireplaces are a speciality and you will find an endless selection in
E05  98 stone, tile or slate.
E05  99    |^*4White painted finish *0and an interesting shape attracted us to
E05 100 this Swedish *'Arka**' chair imported by Finmar and on display at
E05 101 Harris's of Granby Corner, Leicester. ^You can also buy it in
E05 102 beechwood, and both models come with or without a fitted cushion. ^The
E05 103 price is *+8 5\0s for the chair, and the cushion is extra. ^We
E05 104 pictured it ideally in a child's room because it is fairly low
E05 105 (\0approx 12 \0in high from seat to floor). ^If you have any
E05 106 furnishing problems, some at least of the answers will be found at
E05 107 this furnishing store which stocks much top bracket furniture, fabrics
E05 108 and carpets.
E05 109    |^*4Stainless steel *0from Sweden and the English Lake District:
E05 110 this is what we found at Pearce's, jewellers of 7 Market \0Pl,
E05 111 Leicester. ^The coffee-jug, designed by Gense of Sweden, costs *+8
E05 112 3\0s 6\0d and the three-legged dish, hand-beaten by the Keswick School
E05 113 of Art, is 59\0s 6\0d.
E05 114    |^*4Lanterns outside the front door, *0we are told, are fast
E05 115 increasing in popularity. ^This we confirmed whilst visiting Jack
E05 116 English at his shop in London \0Rd, Leicester. ^He told us that people
E05 117 seem to think nothing of spending *+6 to light the way to their
E05 118 doorsteps, but will hesitate at spending the same amount for indoor
E05 119 lighting. ^The favourite shape is undoubtedly a variation on the old
E05 120 wrought iron pattern. ^It is guaranteed to be rust- and weather-proof
E05 121 and sells at *+6 5\0s.
E05 122    |^*4Bohemian crystal chandeliers, *0magnificent and resplendent, to
E05 123 grace alike the baronial hall or *'semi-\0det**', are hung in a superb
E05 124 exhibition at Morgan Squires in Market \0St, Leicester. ^Crown
E05 125 Theresian chandeliers are known throughout the world*- Maria Theresia,
E05 126 Empress of Austria and the mother of Marie Antoinette, decorated her
E05 127 palace with their like and this is how the name originated. ^They are
E05 128 made in Czechoslovakia and distributed in this country by Homeshades
E05 129 of Baker \0St, London \0W 1, and prices range from as little as *+6
E05 130 for a small baguette to *+600 for a 48-light chandelier, 6 feet high.
E05 131 ^Against this glittering background, Morgan Squires have put pieces
E05 132 from the *'Limelight**' range of crystal, one of which we chose. ^This
E05 133 crystal is also produced in Czechoslovakia and comes in various shapes
E05 134 and sizes. ^The one illustrated is in amber and green and costs 70\0s.
E05 135    |^*4Quality and craftsmanship *0are the pace-setters that have kept
E05 136 The Dryad Handicrafts and Cane Furnishing Company of 42 Nicholas \0St,
E05 137 Leicester, leading their field. ^Every handicraft, at home or school,
E05 138 is catered for, both in the supply of materials and books and
E05 139 leaflets, published by their own press. ^On glancing through their
E05 140 catalogue we noticed such items as willow work, marbling and musical
E05 141 pipe-making. ^If you want to try your hand at the spinning wheel, you
E05 142 can buy one here for *+13 18\0s 6\0d together with the various
E05 143 bobbins, spindles and carders that go with it. ^Natural fleece from
E05 144 the Cheviots and South Downs, with sufficient of the natural grease
E05 145 retained to make it particularly suitable for hand-spinning, can also
E05 146 be bought at 11\0s 9\0d a pound. ^One of the latest designs to come
E05 147 from their on-the-spot workrooms, is this mobile wine trolley complete
E05 148 with glass top and ball-bearing casters. ^The price is *+9 13\0s 9\0d.

E05 150 *<*4Fruit-peeling knife*>
E05 151    |^*0Another addition to the *'Prestige**' *'Sky-Line**' range of
E05 152 kitchen knives is a superbly sharp, hollow-ground knife for paring and
E05 153 slicing fruits. ^In fact, this small blade is three useful knives in
E05 154 one, for the tip is serrated and in the wide part of the blade is a
E05 155 sharpened gouger which will cut out a narrow sliver of peel to use in
E05 156 drinks or for decorating special dishes*- or, indeed, dishes which can
E05 157 be made special by the addition of some decoration. ^6\0s 11\0d from

E05 159 *<*4Bath radiator*>
E05 160    |^*0In an age of small houses and flats and miniscule bathrooms, if
E05 161 you have central heating and are sensitive to even the slightest chill
E05 162 in the one room where clothes don't protect you, the problem often
E05 163 arises*- where to put the radiator and how to get a maximum of
E05 164 heating, using a minimum of space. ^The Hurseal *'Ripplerad**' can now
E05 165 be fitted flush against the side of the bath itself, giving a fine
E05 166 sweep of radiator. ^We can't help feeling, too, that this is going to
E05 167 be a wonderful way to take that shocking chill off the porcelain
E05 168 enamel.
E05 169    |^The cost of *'Ripplerad**' to fit an average bath would be about
E05 170 *+5 exclusive of fitting charges. ^Enquiries to Hurseal, 219 Regent

E05 177 offending door yourself. ^The strip has a felt backing for double
E05 178 insulation and to protect carpets.
E05 179    |^Fixing is simple. ^Trim the 39-\0in strip to size with a pair of
E05 180 strong scissors, and then carefully peel off the protective paper
E05 181 backing which covers a strong adhesive. ^Press into place. ^6\0s 6\0d

E05 185 *<*4Swedish salad servers*>
E05 186    |^*0Boots's, once known only as dispensing chemists, have been
E05 187 branching out recently into other fields*- books, records, jewellery
E05 188 and many other things can be bought at the larger branches, all of the
E05 189 high quality we have learned to expect from Boots's pharmaceutical
E05 190 departments. ^This handsome pair of salad servers from Sweden is

E06   1 **[111 TEXT E06**]
E06   2    |^*0This could hardly happen without the herring having some
E06   3 orientation with the sea bottom. ^It means that the crowding is caused
E06   4 during the daytime, and that the herring must continue to migrate
E06   5 *1over the ground *0as well as in midwater and during the swim (the
E06   6 swim at East Anglia is always from the north).
E06   7    |^Thus we can see that herring movements, although primarily
E06   8 instinctive perhaps, and certainly helped and hindered by water flow,
E06   9 are also closely related to the sea-bed geography. ^Geography, too,
E06  10 names the great fisheries that depend on them: the Fladen Ground
E06  11 (where again most big shots are taken on the edges), the Gut, a
E06  12 deep-water channel to the Dogger where the herring spawn along the
E06  13 northern edge; a good contour map will almost define the migrations of
E06  14 these summer herring.
E06  15    |^The effect of bottom congestion due to the light pressure is
E06  16 inevitably mixed with that of the suitability of ground for spawning.
E06  17 ^Both result in crowding, so there is no need to try to separate
E06  18 them*- thank Heaven!
E06  19    |^A good picture of this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
E06  20 grounds from the Viking in the north down to the Klondykes and the
E06  21 Reef along the western edge of the Norwegian Deep. ^In this 200-fathom
E06  22 trench the herring do not touch the bottom. ^Their descent stops at
E06  23 the end of the light pressure. ^But they migrate easterly to the
E06  24 Norwegian side, or westerly, until in the shallower water the mile
E06  25 wide layers disappear from the echo-sounders. ^Bottom crowding comes
E06  26 when they cannot reach their optimum depth; and this coincides with
E06  27 the suitable gravelly soil of these many roughs where the
E06  28 spring-spawning herring are always found.
E06  29    |^The joint evidence of echo-sounders and fishing gear leads to an
E06  30 overall though somewhat dim picture. ^The details are harder still to
E06  31 see.
E06  32    |^*1Drift Effects. ^*0At East Anglia, for instance, shoals that
E06  33 gather at the Knoll or other banks are most of them going to travel a
E06  34 hundred miles farther south before they spawn. ^Some will spawn at the
E06  35 Hinder banks, which are half-way; and it may be that in their
E06  36 southerly march the herring will spawn wherever the suitable gravelly
E06  37 bottom soil coincides with their final ripeness. ^So the arrival of
E06  38 any particular shoal fish at a certain spawning ground may be
E06  39 accidental. ^Yet there will always be some that find it if enough are
E06  40 travelling, just as the robin who gets back exactly may be only one
E06  41 among thousands who do not.
E06  42    |^But this southerly migration is not accidental. ^Being
E06  43 contranatant or against the drift, it probably has a survival value in
E06  44 ensuring that the fry after hatching are drifted back into the normal
E06  45 home of the adults, by the water flow through the English Channel into
E06  46 the North Sea.
E06  47    |^Drift in another form probably explains how these migrating
E06  48 herring are biased to east or west by the different winds. ^Strong
E06  49 westerlies are well known to bring good longshore fishings. **[SIC**]
E06  50 ^The surface water that is blown offshore must be replaced by an
E06  51 underflow bringing with it the herring to the Norfolk and Suffolk
E06  52 beaches. ^Easterly winds, on the other hand, mean no herring along the
E06  53 shore, as recent years have shown.
E06  54    |^A succession of winds is needed for this effect of course*- one
E06  55 breeze will not do it, though a very hard westerly will often start
E06  56 off the *"local**" herring; but quite apart from this wind effect
E06  57 there is an easterly drift special to this rump of coastline, caused
E06  58 by the meeting of water from north and south. ^Herring fishermen call
E06  59 this *"the outset**". ^It is strongest at spring tides, when without
E06  60 wind you will *"set**" out*- or drift to the eastward, the length of
E06  61 half a fleet of nets*- almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
E06  62 Knoll.
E06  63    |^Without an explanation of how it works, it may well be that this
E06  64 outset, akin to the mouth of a great salmon river, has been the
E06  65 biggest factor through the ages in the constancy of this great herring
E06  66 fishery.
E06  67    |^The East Anglian behaviour (see \0p. 82) has always differed from
E06  68 that of the summer fisheries. ^There is the *"swim**" at slack waters,
E06  69 even in daylight sometimes; and the high swimming, when fish are
E06  70 caught only in the top few yards of netting. ^These and other
E06  71 fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar to this fishery, which
E06  72 unfortunately seems to be dying out; but a full discussion of them is
E06  73 beyond the present scope.
E06  74 *<*2*=2. REACTION TO FISHING GEAR*>
E06  75    |^*1The Bow-wave Theory. ^*0This assumes that all fishing gear,
E06  76 when moving, sends before it a kind of scaring effect, probably
E06  77 through waves or vibrations in the water or along the ground.
E06  78 ^Underwater films suggest that the footrope of a trawl does this.
E06  79 ^Films have also shown plaice moving before a seine net in just the
E06  80 same way after being gathered inwards by the ropes. ^(Just how the
E06  81 seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may be by actual contact, or
E06  82 by sight reaction to the disturbed sand; or even in the case of flat
E06  83 fish, by vibrations through or along the bottom.) ^But given such a
E06  84 bow wave of disturbance, it is obvious that without something to
E06  85 overcome its effect, very few fish would be caught.
E06  86    |^Let us consider first what would appear to be the simplest case*-
E06  87 that of flat fish on the bottom. ^The evidence suggest **[SIC**] that
E06  88 the fish are aware of the moving footrope before it reaches them.
E06  89 ^They move away before it, swimming at the same speed for an unknown
E06  90 period of time, until they become (1) tired, or (2) more used to the
E06  91 disturbance. ^Then they stop swimming and are caught. ^In the
E06  92 seine-net film this usually seemed to happen just after the fish had
E06  93 risen above the footrope, and presumably out of its field of
E06  94 disturbance, or bow wave. ^This suggests that the wave might be
E06  95 transmitted by the sea-bed, though the footrope in this case was
E06  96 actually just off the bottom and was indeed passing over some fish.
E06  97    |^It is natural to assume that flat fish being in actual contact
E06  98 with the bottom would react and be aware of the approach of anything
E06  99 like a footrope. ^And only the continuous progress of the net ensures
E06 100 that the fish are captured. ^Recent research on the swimming speeds of
E06 101 fish shows that they soon get tired, hence the success of the trawl.
E06 102    |^The lifting reaction is interesting since it seems in a way to be
E06 103 the last resource. ^The flat fish does not want to rise. ^Its instinct
E06 104 is to hide on the bottom. ^When disturbed, most flat fish will swim
E06 105 rapidly away for a short distance and then ground again, turning to
E06 106 face the disturbance and flirting up the sand or mud as they do so.
E06 107 ^Before a trawl they have not time for this; and the flight becomes a
E06 108 steady swim ahead of the wave until lifting is the only thing left to
E06 109 do.
E06 110    |^This behaviour will probably be corroborated by future films. ^If
E06 111 so, it will be a remarkable vindication of the basic trawl design, for
E06 112 the earliest beam trawls had what we call cover*- that is the headline
E06 113 running ahead of the ground rope.
E06 114    |^Actually the seine net has little or no cover. ^And in this film
E06 115 the rise of the fish was small, a matter of a foot or two. ^With round
E06 116 fish like haddock, which would hardly find safety on the bottom, this
E06 117 cover would seem to be even more essential; but more films are needed
E06 118 to prove this.
E06 119    |^Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered essential to catch
E06 120 round fish whose reaction to disturbance would be upwards. ^In seine
E06 121 nets it might be less important. ^The fish before the net have been
E06 122 gathered more slowly: the reaction of bottom feeding haddocks while
E06 123 being chevied inwards by the slowly closing arms of rope would be to
E06 124 swim away from the disturbance and then downwards again to resume
E06 125 feeding. ^If they swam upwards for any distance they would get above
E06 126 the disturbance and escape.
E06 127    |^It may well be that the efficiency of seineing **[SIC**] on
E06 128 haddocks depends a lot on what the fish happen to be doing. ^When
E06 129 working the Cleaver Bank years ago we used to get good hauls, 12 to 15
E06 130 baskets at opening and close of day, and nothing, except a basket or
E06 131 two of whiting, during the high day. ^This might be explained by a
E06 132 change in behaviour of the fish; or even indirectly of the feed
E06 133 animals on the bottom.
E06 134    |^The point is, however, that once round fish are persuaded into
E06 135 the path of the seine net they would probably be less disturbed than
E06 136 they would be by the faster-moving trawl. ^Whether or not they would
E06 137 be moving slowly before the seine net like the flats, we do not know.
E06 138 ^But the fact that they are caught proves that they do not lift above
E06 139 the headline.
E06 140    |^It may be that some of them do, though. ^And this would explain
E06 141 why the Vinge trawls are now being found more efficient than seine
E06 142 nets when used with seine ropes.
E06 143    |^On this subject of cover, my father could remember 40 baskets of
E06 144 haddock in beam trawl hauls at Smith's Knoll. ^This suggests that
E06 145 cover might be more important than speed. ^But we should realise that
E06 146 a smack with a strong wind and tide could move a trawl fast over the
E06 147 ground.
E06 148    |^If we take note of the action and results of seineing **[SIC**]
E06 149 gear, it becomes fairly obvious that the creeping ropes can have very
E06 150 little bow-wave effect. ^If they moved fast enough to produce a
E06 151 continuous swim the fish would eventually lift and be lost; but the
E06 152 slow heaving taught us by the Danes, like the dogs careful driving of
E06 153 the sheep, drives the flat fish without scaring them. ^As it seems to
E06 154 be the rule to heave fast, as well as to tow, for round fish we may
E06 155 expect the cameras to show a different reaction on the part of these:
E06 156 being rather more active than flats one would expect them to avoid a
E06 157 slow-moving trawl more easily.
E06 158    |^The more we think about trawling and seineing **[SIC**] the more
E06 159 we realise how different they are. ^The seine net can be likened to a
E06 160 dustpan, with brushes*- the ropes*- sweeping things into its path, and
E06 161 if the fish are swept too vigorously they will rise, like the dust,
E06 162 and be lost. ^The trawl, however, is more like the dustpan without a
E06 163 brush and has to move a bit faster.
E06 164    |^We can assume that the bow wave will become greater as the speed
E06 165 of the gear increases. ^In the case of herring trawling great emphasis
E06 166 is placed on the need for fast towing. ^The Germans, who are the
E06 167 recognised experts at this, have been using bigger and bigger ships
E06 168 towing at over 4 knots. ^Their main difficulty seems to be to get
E06 169 netting that will stand the weight of the great catches.
E06 170    |^But if there is anything in the Bow Wave theory there must be
E06 171 something more than just speed to consider. ^Herring are more lively
E06 172 than the white fish, which we have seen react to the bow wave of trawl
E06 173 footropes. ^And the herring can probably swim faster, for short
E06 174 periods anyway, than the trawl moves. ^If the herring react to the
E06 175 disturbance ahead of the trawl like other fish, then increased speed
E06 176 alone is not the answer. ^You cannot catch a bow wave.
E06 177    |^I remember *"seeing**" the bow wave of herring from a trawl on
E06 178 the Fladen Ground over twenty years ago.
E06 179    |^*1Herring Trawling. ^*0One calm summer day in 1937 we lay waiting
E06 180 to shoot our drift nets. ^That morning the drifters had hauled good
E06 181 shots and gone to market, leaving us alone on the ground. ^Yet our
E06 182 systematic echo-sounding over the area had yielded no fish traces. ^At
E06 183 about midday an Aberdeen trawler came towing along, and passed us some
E06 184 hundred yards off. ^I pictured her trawl trundling over the bottom;
E06 185 and I thought of the herring we could not find though knowing they
E06 186 were present.

E07   6 are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons of {0*2DDT} *0and fuel oil over
E07   7 3 million acres or when 20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin.
E07   8 ^An eye-witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with the
E07   9 stench of small game and birds dead from insecticide poisoning.
E07  10    |^Wholesale chemical spraying, upsetting as it does the balance of
E07  11 nature by killing both pests and predators, is viewed with concern by
E07  12 a number of American State Research Stations. ^Not content with
E07  13 issuing bulletins on the dangers of the misuse of chemicals in
E07  14 agriculture, some stations are carrying out useful research on pest
E07  15 control by biological means. ^Both native and imported predatory
E07  16 insects and insect pathogens are used in field trial tests.
E07  17    |^The biological control of pests in the garden is not new to the
E07  18 American gardener. ^Ladybirds figure in press advertisements, their
E07  19 sale being by the gallon. ^Praying mantis ({*1Mantis religiosa}*0),
E07  20 both native and *"immigrant**" varieties, are used by gardeners in all
E07  21 parts of the United States. ^Advertisements offer eggs of European,
E07  22 Chinese or native forms of mantis.
E07  23    |^From the day it hatches in the spring until it dies in the late
E07  24 autumn, the praying mantis satisfies its voracity by eating other
E07  25 insects. ^Nine blowflies may be consumed at one sitting and the fully
E07  26 adult, 2 1/2-{0in.}-long insect, is able to keep a firm hold on one
E07  27 grasshopper while eating another. ^According to \0Dr. Max Beier in
E07  28 *"\Fangheuschrecken**" ({*1Die Neue Brehm Bu"ckerei}, *01952), the
E07  29 praying mantis is trecking northwards. ^The northward journey of the
E07  30 mediterranean mantis brought the insect to Frankfurt on Main by the
E07  31 middle of the 18th century. ^From Frankfurt this useful insect has
E07  32 spread eastwards to Brno in Czechoslovakia and westwards as far as
E07  33 Fontainebleau. ^In North America the northward drive has brought the
E07  34 mantis to Ontario.
E07  35    |^There is, therefore, the possibility that within 100 years the
E07  36 praying mantis may be a part of the Kentish fauna. ^With this in mind,
E07  37 I started my trials with praying mantis in Kent last spring. ^The 1960
E07  38 summer was not suitable for the start of a trial with mantis, but I
E07  39 did not know that when I tied the egg-cases to my peach trees in early
E07  40 May. ^The young mantis started to hatch in batches until mid-June.
E07  41 ^Swathed in a tight membrane, from which all the baby mantis do not
E07  42 escape, the 1/2-{0in.}-long insects look rather like a cross between
E07  43 an Egyptian mummy and a space pilot.
E07  44    |^After extricating itself from the membrane, the young mantis has
E07  45 to dry itself. ^It is at this stage that the helpless insect is in
E07  46 great danger*- especially from ants. ^I found that neither sticky
E07  47 bands nor tanglefoot deterred Kentish ants. ^To study the mantis more
E07  48 closely, I transferred some from the peach trees to a Kilner jar.
E07  49    |^According to \0Dr. Max Beier and to American writers, young
E07  50 mantis feed on plant lice, but I found that my young mantis could not
E07  51 be tempted by aphis from elder, peach and fat hen. ^I was able to keep
E07  52 my mantis alive in the jar by introducing a daily supply of fruit
E07  53 flies. ^By July 12, the growing mantis showed a decided preference for
E07  54 house-flies and blow-flies, but their appetite increased until the few
E07  55 flies I was able to catch were quite insufficient, so I had to release
E07  56 the mantis in the garden. ^I see from my records that the mantis in
E07  57 the jar at no time showed any interest at all in young grasshoppers,
E07  58 moths or caterpillars*- all of which are claimed to be a part of the
E07  59 mantis' diet by American writers. ^Perhaps the mantis has to be at the
E07  60 adult stage before it will tackle these insects. ^After the first
E07  61 moult, the mantis were somewhat lighter in colour*- a change from
E07  62 emerald green to leaf green.
E07  63    |^I need not remind readers of the cool, very wet weather of late
E07  64 July, August and September, 1960. ^The weather conditions led me to
E07  65 feel quite certain that no praying mantis could possibly live through
E07  66 them. ^But on September 18, to my very great surprise, I came across a
E07  67 praying mantis on a blackberry leaf. ^The colour had changed again*-
E07  68 to that of the adult, a yellowish-brown. ^However, the mantis had not
E07  69 yet reached its full size, being only 1 1/4 \0in. in length and still
E07  70 wingless. ^The mantis was photographed and then released. ^Now the
E07  71 finding of one mantis is, in my opinion, a very hopeful sign. ^It is
E07  72 estimated that out of every 1,000 eggs laid, only six mantis survive
E07  73 until the autumn. ^I feel certain that if one of my mantis survived
E07  74 others also survived among the mass of grape-vines, blackberries and
E07  75 other fruits and vegetables on my 1/8 acre. ^But if the one mantis I
E07  76 found in the autumn were the only survivor, the survival ratio was
E07  77 high, at around 1 : 100.
E07  78    |^My gravest error was in the choice of the species of praying
E07  79 mantis with which I started off my trials. ^The egg-cases, which my
E07  80 good friend, \0Mr. {0J. O.} Moncrieff, export manager of the
E07  81 well-known American seed firm, \0W. Atlee Burpee and \0Co., kindly
E07  82 sent me were of the Arizona species, {*1Stagmomantis limbata},
E07  83 *0Hahn, accustomed to dry summer temperatures reaching 120*@\0F. in
E07  84 the shade.
E07  85    |^It is at present too early to report on my continued trials with
E07  86 this useful predator. ^A British zoologist and entomologist suggested
E07  87 that I try Spanish mantis this season. ^My colleague in Madrid, \0Dr.
E07  88 \0D. Fernando Quintana, had great difficulty in obtaining an egg-case,
E07  89 but one was finally secured through the kindness of \0Sr. \0D. Antonio
E07  90 Beni*?2tez Morera of Cadiz. ^The first batch of around 50 mantis
E07  91 hatched from this egg-case on June 20.
E07  92    |^Meanwhile \0Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an egg-case of the Chinese
E07  93 mantis. ^The first mantis had hatched from the very large egg-case on
E07  94 June 6. ^Both the Chinese and Spanish mantis, in the young stage at
E07  95 any rate, are light brown in colour.
E07  96    |^Because of the cool, wet weather, I had great difficulty in
E07  97 breeding fruit flies and, after many of the mantis of both types had
E07  98 died in my Kilner jars, I poured living mantis over vines and
E07  99 peachtrees. ^A *1Gardeners Chronicle *0reader living in Grantham,
E07 100 \0Lincs, kindly offered to cooperate with me in studying praying
E07 101 mantis as a pest control in the cold greenhouse. ^Of the dozen Spanish
E07 102 mantis sent him by post on June 22, only two or three survived the
E07 103 journey; one thrived and the latest report I have is that this mantis
E07 104 is still alive.
E07 105    |^Since June I have not seen a mantis in my garden and I would
E07 106 dearly like to know how \0J. Henri Fabre persuaded local children at
E07 107 Se*?2rignan to find his specimens. ^Local boys here in Kent, possibly
E07 108 distracted by my crop of grapes and blackberries, show no interest in
E07 109 searching for praying mantis to earn 5\0s. for each mantis found*-
E07 110 dead or alive.
E07 111 *<*6A CHOICE OF POTS*>
E07 112 *<*0By *2JOHN \0T. WARREN, {0N.D.H.}*>
E07 113    |^*4D*2ESPITE *0the steady influx of substitutes since the end of
E07 114 the war, clay pots are still in greatest demand. ^It is mostly in the
E07 115 smaller sizes that the substitutes have made headway, and although
E07 116 numerous small clay pots are used each year, they are fewer than they
E07 117 were 10 years ago. ^In the larger sizes there is still no real
E07 118 substitute for clay that can be obtained at a comparable price, except
E07 119 the bituminized paper pots which are used on commercial nurseries for
E07 120 growing tomatoes and chrysanthemums.
E07 121    |^The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its brittle nature; even
E07 122 with reasonably careful handling, the annual losses are often around
E07 123 10 per \0cent., and where the handling and storage facilities are not
E07 124 too good, these losses will be even greater. ^This does not
E07 125 necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as they are not quite so
E07 126 fragile as the smaller ones and are not normally thrown about in quite
E07 127 the same way. ^The storage problem puts clay pots at a definite
E07 128 disadvantage. ^They are fairly heavy and difficult things to
E07 129 accommodate and they must have some protection from severe weather,
E07 130 which can be quite a headache in a small garden. ^While admitting that
E07 131 broken pots have on occasions provided artists with delightful
E07 132 studies, there is no doubt that a pile of badly stacked, half-broken
E07 133 pots is an unlovely sight from any point of view. ^Every garden boy
E07 134 will agree that having to wash clay pots is a definite factor in
E07 135 favour of their abolition; in fact one young man was so wholehearted
E07 136 about this a few years ago that he made the headlines for having
E07 137 smashed a large number to relieve his feelings. ^On the
E07 138 small-to-medium establishment, it is a disagreeable chore which nobody
E07 139 tackles with any enthusiasm, whereas on larger establishments the pots
E07 140 can be sterilized or washed by machine. ^It is not easy to make an
E07 141 economic comparison between clay pots and the various substitutes; the
E07 142 former may last indefinitely with luck, while the latter are often
E07 143 expendable used only once.
E07 144    |^Clay pots are efficient and congenial containers in which to grow
E07 145 plants. ^In their proper setting they are not unattractive and, in
E07 146 spite of their shortcomings, most gardeners have a nostalgic affection
E07 147 for them. ^Present-day pots are better finished, do not get dirty so
E07 148 readily and are easier to wash. ^The deep rims make for neater and
E07 149 safer stacking, though they are still expensive and still get broken.
E07 150 ^On the other hand, there is really no replacement for the larger
E07 151 sizes, so they have the decided advantage of being the only suitable
E07 152 container available in quantity for fairly large plants.
E07 153    |^Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay pots for
E07 154 plant raising. ^These are compressed blocks of compost, made in a
E07 155 specially devised press to simulate roughly the shape and size of a
E07 156 pot. ^Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they are made of the
E07 157 same compost as would have been used in a pot, the only difference
E07 158 being that it is used in a slightly moister condition. ^Seed is sown,
E07 159 or seedlings are pricked out into them in the normal way, the only
E07 160 real difference being that more of the watering is done through a rose
E07 161 to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout of water. ^First-class
E07 162 plants of tomatoes, cucumbers, marrows, melons, cauliflowers, celery
E07 163 and onions, may all be raised in soil blocks; so can such flowering
E07 164 plants as dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas, lupins and
E07 165 numerous others. ^One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious one:
E07 166 the cost of a pot of any description is saved completely.
E07 167 ^Manufacturing the block and planting it is very little more trouble
E07 168 than normal potting, and a superior plant, which transplants more
E07 169 easily, is produced. ^The obvious limitation is that soil blocks can
E07 170 only be used for propagating; there can be no progression to a larger
E07 171 block when the plant or seedling is ready to be moved; it must be
E07 172 planted out or potted. ^Many amateur gardeners might improve their
E07 173 results by buying a small hand-operated soil block maker and use the
E07 174 money saved on buying small pots to improve their composts.
E07 175    |^The various types of small paper pots are very useful for
E07 176 short-term operations, but are inclined to collapse if the plants are
E07 177 in them too long. ^They are quite useful for plants that are
E07 178 despatched to market or direct to customers, their cheapness making
E07 179 them attractive to the nurseryman; there is also considerable saving
E07 180 in carriage costs because of their lightness.
E07 181    |^There are many types of plastic pots available; some expensive,
E07 182 some quite cheap; some good and others not so good. ^A wide range of
E07 183 plants grow quite well in plastic pots and usually need less water
E07 184 than those in clay pots. ^They are slightly more difficult to manage,
E07 185 however, until a little experience has been gained with them. ^Plastic
E07 186 pots are usually more expensive than clay ones, but they are almost
E07 187 indestructible and will last a long time with normal care.

E08   3 *<*4\0S. Clapham*>
E08   4    |^D*2URING *0the winter the summer-flowering greenhouse perennials
E08   5 are of course at rest, but this does not mean that they need no
E08   6 attention at all. ^Many of them, in fact, can come to grief more
E08   7 readily at this time than in the summer, and with all of them a
E08   8 certain amount of care is necessary if they are to be not only alive
E08   9 in spring but in the best possible condition for re-starting into
E08  10 growth.
E08  11    |^Perhaps the ones which are most liable to be neglected are those
E08  12 which die down completely, such as gloxinias, achimenes and tuberous
E08  13 begonias. ^Those are often left in their pots and laid on their sides
E08  14 beneath the staging where they are very much *"out of sight, out of
E08  15 mind,**" and where any damage caused by slugs, wood-lice or mice is
E08  16 thus not readily noticed. ^It pays, therefore, to give these plants an
E08  17 occasional examination, and if any traces of these pests are seen, to
E08  18 put down some traps or bait straight away.
E08  19    |^With these quite dormant plants the temperature should be
E08  20 watched, too, for with gloxinias and achimenes particularly this
E08  21 should go no lower than 50*@, and if it does the plants should be put
E08  22 somewhere warmer immediately. ^Begonia tubers, on the other hand, do
E08  23 not mind a slightly lower temperature than this, and with these the
E08  24 main danger is excessive dryness, which leads to shrivelling. ^If this
E08  25 occurs an occasional damping-over of the tubers will soon put matters
E08  26 right, but this should not be overdone and if there is any drip from
E08  27 the staging it is usually best to keep all these stored plants covered
E08  28 with, say, a piece of corrugated iron or asbestos sheeting.
E08  29 *<*4Keep Hydrangea Buds Plump*>
E08  30    |^*0The hydrangea is another plant which is usually stored in an
E08  31 out-of-the-way place, and here again excessive dryness can cause
E08  32 trouble if the plants are neglected. ^It is a mistake to think that
E08  33 hydrangeas need no water at all during the winter months*- those
E08  34 growing outside are kept moist enough!*- and as long as they are kept
E08  35 cool enough to prevent premature growth it is quite safe to give them
E08  36 just sufficient to keep the green bud at the tip of each stem nice and
E08  37 plump. ^These buds, by the way, should contain the dormant
E08  38 flower-shoot for next year, and if they become affected by mildew,
E08  39 which can easily happen if the roots are kept too dry, the plants will
E08  40 obviously not flower as they should, if indeed they flower at all.
E08  41 ^And as an additional safeguard against mildew it is advisable to dust
E08  42 the buds with flowers of sulphur.
E08  43    |^With pot-grown fuchsias almost complete dryness during the
E08  44 resting season does not seem to matter, but this season is normally a
E08  45 comparatively short one, and in a heated house it should be safe
E08  46 enough to start watering immediately after Christmas. ^Even in a cold
E08  47 house a little watering at this time will do no harm as fuchsias are
E08  48 very nearly hardy, and this can, of course, be increased as the
E08  49 weather warms up.
E08  50    |^Heliotropes, however, are a very different matter, and unless the
E08  51 greenhouse can be kept well above freezing point it is almost
E08  52 impossible to keep them through the winter. ^In a reasonably warm
E08  53 house, though, they should not be difficult to keep if they are placed
E08  54 in the warmest position possible and kept moist, or on the dry side if
E08  55 anything. ^Rooted cuttings of heliotropes are usually much easier to
E08  56 keep than old plants, but here again water should be given very
E08  57 sparingly and the plants placed where they will get light and warmth.
E08  58 *<*4Protect from Cold Weather*>
E08  59    |^*0Zonal pelargoniums, fortunately, are much less touchy, and even
E08  60 in a cold house they will often survive if kept very dry and given a
E08  61 little extra protection in really cold weather*- a few sheets of
E08  62 newspaper laid over them will often save the roots if not the tops.
E08  63 ^In a heated house, however, more water is advisable, as if the plants
E08  64 are kept too dry, they tend to become so hard that the stems are slow
E08  65 to *"break**" in spring. ^But too much water at this time will produce
E08  66 soft, long growths that are no use for anything, and the best method
E08  67 is to give the plants just enough to enable them to hold their own
E08  68 without making too much growth. ^Afterwards they should romp away in
E08  69 spring.
E08  70 *<*6THIS WEEK IN YOUR GARDEN*>
E08  71 *<*5By Percy Thrower, {0*6M.D.H.}*>
E08  72 *<FLOWERS*>
E08  73    |^*4W*2E *0are now at the beginning of the planting season for
E08  74 trees, shrubs and roses. ^I like to get as much as possible of this
E08  75 planting done in November while the temperature of the soil is still
E08  76 fairly high, for this gives the roots a reasonable chance to get
E08  77 themselves established before bad weather sets in.
E08  78    |^No doubt many readers with new gardens will be considering the
E08  79 planting of hedges. ^Privet is usually the first shrub that comes to
E08  80 mind but I would not recommend it despite the fact that it is quick in
E08  81 growth, hardy and, in most districts, evergreen. ^Personally I would
E08  82 prefer beech which retains its beautiful golden-brown leaves in the
E08  83 winter or, in country districts, the hawthorn makes a fine hedge. ^But
E08  84 {Cupressus lawsoniana} and {Thuja plicata} make fine hedges,
E08  85 particularly where a screen of fair size is required. ^For small
E08  86 dividing hedges within the garden flowering shrubs such as escallonia,
E08  87 forsythia, cotoneaster or strong growing floribunda roses can be
E08  88 delightful.
E08  89    |^The preparation for the planting of trees, shrubs and roses
E08  90 should always be thorough because these are permanent plants which
E08  91 cannot be disturbed once they are in. ^The site should be deeply dug
E08  92 with manure, garden compost or peat being worked into the soil. ^At
E08  93 the same time some bone meal can be sprinkled through the soil as it
E08  94 will assist in the formation of a good root system.
E08  95    |^If some of the herbaceous plants are to be lifted, divided and
E08  96 replanted, this work must either be done very soon or left over until
E08  97 February or March. ^It is not, in general, wise to move herbaceous
E08  98 plants in the middle of the winter.
E08  99    |^Some shrubs are a little tender and need a certain amount of
E08 100 protection in exposed areas. ^This is true of some veronicas and also
E08 101 of the larger flowered escallonias. ^In northern and eastern districts
E08 102 the large flowered hydrangeas are also safer with some protection. ^I
E08 103 do not recommend covering such tender shrubs completely with polythene
E08 104 but polythene can be wrapped around them, the top being left open.
E08 105 ^Better, however, in my view is protection with dry bracken or
E08 106 sacking, either of which can be held in place with canes and string.
E08 107    |^Very good lawns can be made quickly from turf provided the turf
E08 108 itself is reasonably clean and free of weeds. ^This is a good time of
E08 109 year at which to lay turf.
E08 110 *<*6VEGETABLES*>
E08 111    |^*0No doubt there will be many readers with new gardens who just
E08 112 now are thinking of making a vegetable garden for the first time. ^The
E08 113 first essential is to fork out all perennial weeds, {0i.e.} weeds
E08 114 such as docks, dandelions, creeping buttercups, couch grass and
E08 115 bindweed which persist from year to year.
E08 116    |^All ground should then be dug at least to the full depth of a
E08 117 spade and left rough during the winter so that frost, wind and rain
E08 118 may break it up. ^Most vegetables like a firm soil and if digging is
E08 119 left until the spring, it is often difficult to get the soil firm
E08 120 enough for the best results. ^New land turned over now should be in
E08 121 ideal condition for vegetables for next year.
E08 122    |^It is particularly important to dig heavy land in autumn because
E08 123 there is nothing better than frost and wind to break down the lumps of
E08 124 clay. ^Just leave the clods as they are turned over, making no attempt
E08 125 to break them up, and then scatter basic slag over the surface at 4 to
E08 126 6 \0oz. per {0sq. yd.} or give a similar dressing of hydrated lime.
E08 127    |^Clear away the yellow leaves from around the lower parts of
E08 128 brussels sprout plants and put these on the compost heap. ^Take care
E08 129 not to damage any healthy leaves as these are feeding the plants still
E08 130 and helping the sprouts to form.
E08 131    |^It is not too late to make a further sowing of lettuce in a
E08 132 frame. ^Seedlings from earlier sowings should be examined from time to
E08 133 time and any decaying leaves removed.
E08 134 *<*6FRUIT*>
E08 135    |^*0For fruit also this is the ideal planting season and work can
E08 136 continue at any time when the soil is in reasonable condition until
E08 137 the end of March. ^Nevertheless I think autumn planting has much to
E08 138 commend it because the trees, bushes or canes get a longer period in
E08 139 which to establish themselves before commencing to grow in spring.
E08 140    |^Fruit trees should always be purchased from a really reliable
E08 141 source because many of them need to be on the right kind of root stock
E08 142 and some are very liable to become infected with virus disease unless
E08 143 they are properly inspected.
E08 144    |^In most gardens there is some wall or fence on which a fruit tree
E08 145 can be trained and a very pleasant and profitable method this is of
E08 146 making good use of such a position. ^For a north wall I recommend a
E08 147 Morello cherry, for an east wall a plum or greengage and for a south
E08 148 or west-facing wall, a peach, nectarine or apricot.
E08 149 *<*5Work in the Greenhouse*>
E08 150    |^*1At the moment the greenhouse is getting very congested with
E08 151 chrysanthemums, cinerarias, primulas, cyclamen, solanums, echeverias
E08 152 and on the shelves schizanthus, calceolarias and cuttings of the
E08 153 various bedding plants. ^It becomes quite a problem to know how to
E08 154 keep everything in good condition and it is more important than ever
E08 155 to use the ventilators as much as possible whenever outdoor conditions
E08 156 are favourable. ^What is essential is to maintain a free circulation
E08 157 of air around the plants and to keep the atmosphere reasonably dry.
E08 158    |^Schizanthus and calceolarias need very careful watering at this
E08 159 time of the year. ^In particular avoid splashing water unnecessarily
E08 160 over the leaves and still more do not allow it to collect at the base
E08 161 of the leaves. ^As the plants fill their pots with roots move them on
E08 162 to larger sizes.
E08 163    |^I have a stock of coleus cuttings, four in each 3 1/2\0in. pot
E08 164 and all nicely rooted. ^These I shall now put on a shelf near the
E08 165 glass and leave them there for the winter. ^From these stock cuttings
E08 166 I shall take further cuttings in spring as I find that the
E08 167 spring-struck cuttings make finer plants than those rooted in autumn.
E08 168    |^Take a look at begonia tubers in store and, if any show the
E08 169 slightest signs of decay, dust them with flowers of sulphur.
E08 170    |^Bulbs in pots, boxes and bowls which have been kept in a cool
E08 171 dark place or have been plunged in sand or ashes for at least eight
E08 172 weeks, can now be brought out and put in a frame, but no artificial
E08 173 heat should be used yet.
E08 174    |^As fuchsias begin to drop their leaves the supply of water to
E08 175 them should be reduced until eventually they are kept almost dry
E08 176 during the winter.
E08 177 *<*5Reliable Battery Operated Garden Tools*>
E08 178 *<*4Written and illustrated by {0*4A. D.} Johnson*>
E08 179    |^W*2HEN *0the battery lawnmower was first introduced three years
E08 180 ago, and I expressed my enthusiasm for it, my friends nodded their
E08 181 heads sagely and expressed grave doubts about the prospect of having
E08 182 to renew the battery frequently at a cost of ten pounds odd. ^But I am
E08 183 still optimistic, for, after three seasons' use my own battery is
E08 184 still holding its charge as well as it did when new. ^It has had no
E08 185 special attention, but I do adhere rigidly to three maxims*- to charge
E08 186 it immediately after use every time; to keep it topped up with
E08 187 distilled water; and not to let it become frozen in the winter.
E08 188    |^Those enthusiasts for quiet effortless electric mowing who have
E08 189 already bought mains-operated machines may feel a little sad at having
E08 190 to live with their cable, so I was delighted to hear that Webbs are
E08 191 now willing to undertake conversion of mains machines to battery
E08 192 operation.

E09  17 ^Especially a stamp collector on his way to buy some Lebanese stamps!
E09  18    |^Yet if the stamp collector knows even a few words of Arabic the
E09  19 invitation to go the twelve kilometres along the northern coastal road
E09  20 to the Dog River will ring a bell. ^Dog River*- {Nahr el-Kelb}!
E09  21 ^Why, that's one of the best known stamp scenes in the Eastern
E09  22 Mediterranean!
E09  23    |^A picture flashes to mind: a graceful old three-arched bridge, a
E09  24 river flowing through a rocky valley to the sea. ^How many Lebanese
E09  25 stamps have pictured this typical view? ^*"Oh, very well then, take me
E09  26 to the Dog River, please...**"
E09  27    |^*"Jump in, sir!**"
E09  28    |^So off we go with the sea on the left and the tumbled mass of
E09  29 Mount Lebanon with its hundreds of valleys and villages on the right*-
E09  30 off to see a well-known stamp scene with a fascinating story*- a scene
E09  31 straight out of the current Gibbons Part *=3 but a story that goes
E09  32 back some two thousand years {0B.C.}
E09  33    |^First of all, a look at the design illustrated in the catalogue.
E09  34 ^The first stamp to show the {Nahr el-Kelb} and its bridge was the
E09  35 0\0p.50 postage due label of 1925, as the scene was not chosen for the
E09  36 first set of definitive pictorials issued in that year. ^{0S.G.D.}11
E09  37 was a photogravure job by Vaugirard of Paris on yellow tinted paper
E09  38 and in common with all the early pictorials printed by Vaugirard was
E09  39 designed by \0J. \de \la Nezie*?2re.
E09  40    |^The first definitive postage stamp with this view was the 4
E09  41 piastre value of the 1930 pictorial series ({0S.G.}171) which
E09  42 Gibbons illustrate as *"Type 16.**" ^The designer and printer are the
E09  43 same, and in common with nearly all Lebanese stamps the caption below
E09  44 the frame gives designer, printer and subject. ^This is another
E09  45 photogravure*- or as this printer calls it *"heliogravure**"*- job.
E09  46    |^During the Second World War, however, the Lebanon, then a
E09  47 Republic somewhat unwillingly under French Mandate, was cut off from
E09  48 communication with the Vaugirard printers in Paris and a serious start
E09  49 was made in printing *"do-it-yourself**" offset lithographed stamps in
E09  50 Beyrouth. ^(As early as 1930 six Silk Congress commemoratives had been
E09  51 typographed locally.) ^Under war conditions the last stamp to arrive
E09  52 from Paris was a solitary 5 piastre value printed in recess, and this
E09  53 was in the {Nahr el-Kelb} design*- Gibbons called it *"Type 16**" as
E09  54 the design is similar to the photogravure stamp but the format is
E09  55 larger and it is in a rather bold style of recess painting. ^The
E09  56 colour is green-blue.
E09  57    |^Alone of all the 1930 pictorials the {Nahr el-Kelb} was
E09  58 perpetuated in this way, and had history turned out differently others
E09  59 of the series might have followed with new values and colours and in
E09  60 recess engraving. ^But France fell and the French mandatory
E09  61 authorities in the Lebanon found themselves out in the cold. ^British
E09  62 and Free French forces entered the Lebanon and there was fighting and
E09  63 confusion until the signing of the Convention of Acre on July 14th,
E09  64 1941.
E09  65    |^There was by then no possibility of any more recess printed
E09  66 stamps coming from France. ^Indeed the French Mandate itself was
E09  67 doomed. ^With British backing and local enthusiasm the Lebanese
E09  68 Republic became an independent sovereign state on November 27th, 1941.
E09  69    |^As a stamp subject the {Nahr el-Kelb} survived the great
E09  70 political change.
E09  71    |^First came wartime stop-gap overprints. ^Among them the recess
E09  72 printed 5 piastre value received overprints altering the duty to 2 or
E09  73 3 piastres ({0S.G.}261 and 262). ^Miniature cedar trees are used to
E09  74 block out the original value.
E09  75    |^It was not until 1947 that the {Nahr el-Kelb} scene again
E09  76 appeared on stamps. ^In that year four airmail stamps in offset
E09  77 lithography were printed in Beyrouth to commemorate the evacuation of
E09  78 all foreign forces from the Republic ({0S.G.}334-337). ^The centre
E09  79 of this design*- Gibbons *"Type 48**"*- shows the familiar bridge and
E09  80 river and on the right hand side of the design appears one of the
E09  81 inscribed rock tablets that are the unique feature of this scene.
E09  82 ^Presumably this tablet in Arabic commemorates the same event as does
E09  83 the stamp, and dates from 1947.
E09  84    |^The attractive bridge which forms the central feature in all
E09  85 these stamp designs was built in its present form by the Emir Bechir
E09  86 Chehab during the years 1828-29. ^So says an inscription on a stone
E09  87 tablet on the bridge itself. ^Another inscription chiselled in the
E09  88 rock at the south end of the bridge states that a bridge was built
E09  89 here by Sultan Selim *=1, the Ottoman Turkish conqueror of Lebanon,
E09  90 Syria, Palestine and Egypt who added these lands to his Empire in
E09  91 1516-17.
E09  92    |^But it is known that a Circassian Sultan of Egypt and Syria
E09  93 called Bargoug or Berkuk, who ruled from Cairo during the years
E09  94 1382-99, built a bridge here on the eve of the terrible Mongol
E09  95 invasions. ^Probably Saracens, Crusaders, Byzantines and Romans built
E09  96 or repaired bridges at this spot.
E09  97    |^Modern road and railway bridges take the lines of communication
E09  98 of to-day between Beyrouth and the north past the place where the
E09  99 mountain comes right down to the sea shore and the Dog River or {Nahr
E09 100 el-Kelb} has to be crossed.
E09 101    |^There is little width for the road, especially between the
E09 102 headland of {Ras el-Kelb} (which terminates the southern bank of the
E09 103 river) and the sea. ^In olden times the road was a narrow track
E09 104 clinging to the rocky face of the headland before descending to the
E09 105 earliest of the bridges that have carried it across the river. ^Later
E09 106 a Roman road took a more favourable route at a lower level.
E09 107 ^Constructed by order of the Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antonius about
E09 108 {0A.D.} 173 it was reconstructed in Byzantine times.
E09 109    |^All through history people have been passing this spot and the
E09 110 rock face by the roadside offered the opportunity for conquerors down
E09 111 the ages to engrave records of their passage. ^They have inscribed
E09 112 panels up to ten feet in height in Arabic, English, French, Greek,
E09 113 Latin, Cuneiform, Assyrian and Hieroglyphic Egyptian witnessing to the
E09 114 deeds of such diverse heroes as Rameses *=2, Esarhaddon,
E09 115 Nebuchadnezzar, Napoleon *=3, General Allenby and United Kingdom,
E09 116 Australian, New Zealand and Indian troops. ^Our stamps show but one
E09 117 page of the world's most gigantic visitors' book!
E09 118    |^Before looking at the rest of the Dog River stamps we must now
E09 119 answer the question of why this river is so called.
E09 120 *<*4Egyptian God*>
E09 121    |^*0The most up-to-date explanation is that the river was once
E09 122 connected with the Egyptian cult of the god Anubis, represented as a
E09 123 jackal or wolf, sometimes as a human figure with a jackal's or dog's
E09 124 head. ^Popularly he was looked upon as the Dog God who showed the way
E09 125 to the land of the dead and is supposed to have come to Lebanon with
E09 126 the cult of Isis and Osiris. ^In this cult Isis, searching for her
E09 127 dead lover, was guided by the dog Anubis, who became her guide and
E09 128 companion.
E09 129    |^Be that as it may, at some early period an enormous statue of a
E09 130 dog or similar animal was erected on the headland of {Ras el-Kelb}
E09 131 (Dog Head) above the road and it is believed that this statue was
E09 132 vocal. ^The wind made it howl or bark. ^The sound was so strong that
E09 133 legend insists that the animal *"awoke the echoes of far-distant
E09 134 Cyprus with his bark.**" ^It must have been a strange experience on a
E09 135 stormy night to hear the sound coming over the water, even if the
E09 136 range *1was *0less than 125 miles!
E09 137    |^The Greeks called the river {*2LYKOS POTAMUS} *0and the Romans
E09 138 {*2LYCUS FLUMEN}*- *0both alike meaning *"Wolf River.**" ^Thus the
E09 139 Egyptian dog*- or was he a jackal?*- became a wolf, and the wolf an
E09 140 Arab dog.
E09 141    |^Before exploring upstream to look at some other stamp scenes we
E09 142 must examine the later stamps showing the old bridge. ^These lack the
E09 143 elaborate arabesque frames of earlier types; the bridge is more
E09 144 prominent and fills the scene, and despite the Druze, the Circassian
E09 145 and the Turk whose names are associated with its construction, the
E09 146 caption is *"{Pont Arabe sur Nahr el-Kelb}.**" ^Perhaps this is to
E09 147 honour the men who probably did the actual work of building!
E09 148    |^The issue of 1950 has five stamps designated by Gibbons as *"Type
E09 149 66,**" designed by \0P. Koroleff and printed in offset lithography by
E09 150 the {Imprimerir **[SIC**] Catholique} at Beyrouth
E09 151 ({0S.G.}411-415). ^At first glance these stamps appear to be in
E09 152 photogravure and they certainly reproduce the characteristics of an
E09 153 original photograph, not a line drawing.
E09 154    |^The offset lithographed issue of 1951 ({0S.G.}433-437)
E09 155 consists, on the other hand, of stamps designed by \0Mr. Koroleff as
E09 156 line drawings*- Gibbons *"Type 74.**" ^At least two very distinct
E09 157 shades should be looked for: the 12\0p.50 value comes in both bright
E09 158 and dull turquoise and the 50 piastre in both light and dark green.
E09 159    |^In 1957 the same design reappeared in new colours and with the
E09 160 inscription *"{Re*?2publique Libanaise}**" replaced by simply
E09 161 *"Liban.**" ^These stamps formed a short set of three values
E09 162 ({0S.G.}561-563).
E09 163    |^We have lingered long enough by the bridge. ^Away we go, now
E09 164 upstream where *"the bright little river dashes along through a glen
E09 165 which opens the very heart of the mountain**" to see the Jeita
E09 166 Grottos, subject of the five vertical pictorials of the March 1955
E09 167 definitives. ^(Two full sets of definitive pictorials every year could
E09 168 easily kill all philatelic interest in Lebanon!) ^These are
E09 169 {0S.G.}514-518.
E09 170    |^Three huge caves take the name of Jeita Grottos from the nearby
E09 171 village of Jeita, variously spelt Gita or Ghita. ^Out of the first
E09 172 cave rushes a large part of the river; the second penetrates under the
E09 173 mountain and then descends into an abyss with parallel and branching
E09 174 passages, one of which gives access to the lowest cave. ^The third and
E09 175 largest cavern has a gallery or corridor and again we meet the river
E09 176 as it descends, crossing the cave and disappearing at the north-west
E09 177 corner with a thundering roar.
E09 178    |^Above the caves the banks of the {Nahr el-Kelb} are formed of
E09 179 shattered cliffs of grey limestone nearly 2,000 feet high. ^Various
E09 180 tributaries come in, a waterfall roars over a rocky ledge, and then we
E09 181 reach a point where the river is spanned by a gigantic natural bridge,
E09 182 one of the geological wonders of the world.
E09 183 *<*4Natural Bridge*>
E09 184    |^*0The natural bridge is the {Jisr el-Hajr} or {Jisr Hajar}
E09 185 (Stone Bridge) and as it is a little to the south of the last village
E09 186 on a road which leads up from Djounie on the coast, the village of
E09 187 Fareiya or Faraya, it is described on the two stamps which depict it
E09 188 as *"{Pont Naturel}, Faraya.**" ^These are the two lowest values of
E09 189 the Red Cross airmail stamps of 1947 ({0S.G.}338-339). ^The stamps

E10   2 *<*6WINDMILLS*>
E10   3 *<*5Collectors' pieces... for the keen amateur*>
E10   4 *<*4By *6JEFFERY \0W. WHITELAW*>
E10   5    |^*4W*2INDMILLS, *0quaint and picturesque survivals from the past,
E10   6 have always been of great interest to the photographer.
E10   7 ^Unfortunately, however, in this modern age very few of these
E10   8 reminders of man's early attempts at mechanization on a fairly large
E10   9 scale are still working and in too many cases they have been allowed
E10  10 to fall into disrepair*- often with nothing but a brick stump
E10  11 remaining. ^On the other hand, and to the benefit of the country-lover
E10  12 and photographers alike, enlightened authorities, the Ministry of
E10  13 Works, the National Trust and even private individuals have made great
E10  14 efforts to preserve some of these mills before it is too late. ^Most
E10  15 of the windmills which appear to be complete are more than likely to
E10  16 have been restored and it is these which make magnificent photographs.
E10  17 ^A windmill in good repair with its bare sweeps against a suitable sky
E10  18 can make a most attractive subject*- it may even produce an exhibition
E10  19 picture*- and I have been adding to my collection for some years now.
E10  20    |^It will be useful at this point to give a brief history of the
E10  21 windmill for those who may be new to this subject. ^The three basic
E10  22 types of windmill are the *1Post Mill, *0the *1Tower Mill *0and the
E10  23 *1Smock Mill, *0and these can be described without the variations in
E10  24 design which are to be found in different parts of the country*- some
E10  25 of these variations will be seen from the accompanying photographs.
E10  26    |^The oldest and most primitive type is the post mill which became
E10  27 known by this name because, in order that the mill should obtain the
E10  28 maximum power from the wind, the whole body was pivoted on a centre
E10  29 post supported by heavy timber beams in the form of a tripod. ^A long
E10  30 beam projected from the back of the mill and the miller had to push on
E10  31 this to bring the sweeps round to face the wind. ^A good example of an
E10  32 early post mill is to be seen at Bourn, in Cambridgeshire, and as the
E10  33 records can be traced back to 1636 it is now the oldest surviving
E10  34 windmill in the country, with the Cambridge Preservation Society
E10  35 making sure that it stays in good repair. ^Although the sweeps and
E10  36 tailbeam are modern replacements, the remainder is the original
E10  37 structure and of great interest. ^A key can be obtained at the
E10  38 farmhouse and there is complete freedom to go all over the mill with
E10  39 the possibility of photographs from every angle, both inside and out.
E10  40    |^It began to be realized that it was a great waste of labour and
E10  41 effort to have to turn the whole mill whenever the wind changed and by
E10  42 the end of the 17th century, tower mills were being built. ^These were
E10  43 solid buildings either of brick or clunch to house the machinery with
E10  44 revolving caps to which the sails were attached. ^The earliest caps
E10  45 had still to be turned by hand, but what has become known as the
E10  46 *"fantail**" was invented in the 18th century, thus removing the need
E10  47 for the miller to be constantly on the alert for a change in the wind.
E10  48 *<*4Into the Eye of the Wind*>
E10  49    |^*0The fantail consists of what is more or less a small windmill
E10  50 set at right-angles to the main sails, and when these are facing
E10  51 squarely into the wind the fantail does not move. ^As soon as the wind
E10  52 changes, it causes the fantail to start revolving and, working through
E10  53 a series of gears, the cap turns, so bringing the sails back into the
E10  54 *"eye of the wind.**" ^A number of post mills had the fantail added
E10  55 later and this undoubtedly saved many from demolition after the
E10  56 labour-saving tower mills were invented; a particularly fine example
E10  57 recently restored by the Ministry of Works can be seen at Saxtead
E10  58 Green, near Framlingham in Suffolk.
E10  59    |^The third type of mill is in reality only a variant of the tower
E10  60 mill and known as the smock mill because of its fancied resemblance to
E10  61 an old farmer wearing a smock. ^The smock mill has a tapering
E10  62 timber-framed tower (usually octagonal) often on a brick base, and the
E10  63 frames are covered with boards.
E10  64    |^When considering windmills from the photographic viewpoint, it
E10  65 will soon become apparent that they are not the easiest of subjects,
E10  66 and that if something more than *"just another record**" is to be made
E10  67 of each mill as it is discovered, then quite a little thought must be
E10  68 devoted to the problems which may arise. ^To obtain a really
E10  69 first-class result I consider it is essential to have a bright sunny
E10  70 day with blue sky and good strong cumulus clouds*- windmills usually
E10  71 look their best against this cotton-wool type of sky.
E10  72 *<*4Take it Now!*>
E10  73    |^*0Unfortunately, these ideal conditions rarely occur at just the
E10  74 right time, and here I will give a word of advice, which would not be
E10  75 necessary with most other types of subjects. ^By all means plan to
E10  76 come back another day for another attempt if the weather should not be
E10  77 all that you hoped for, but *1do *0take a picture *1whatever *0the
E10  78 weather*- when you come again it is possible that fire or a storm may
E10  79 have destroyed the mill overnight. ^Recently in the National Press
E10  80 there was a sad picture of the wreckage of the smock mill on Outwood
E10  81 Common, near Redhill, after it had collapsed one night at the end of
E10  82 1960, to prove that this is a very real hazard. ^It is quite likely
E10  83 that the mill *1will *0still be standing or even have been restored on
E10  84 another visit, but if not, then the picture taken on a dull day will
E10  85 not have been wasted because it was the last one taken before the mill
E10  86 met its end.
E10  87    |^Given ideal weather conditions one must decide what is the most
E10  88 favourable viewpoint*- whether to take the mill straight on to the
E10  89 sails or from the side, whether just to take the mill on its own in a
E10  90 vertical format or to include it as part of the landscape as a
E10  91 horizontal. ^All these minor problems must be worked out as each mill
E10  92 is photographed. ^A side view is usually more pleasing, but it may be
E10  93 that a frontal view will be more effective in certain circumstances*-
E10  94 sometimes the surroundings are very uninteresting, especially if the
E10  95 mill is hemmed in by farm buildings, and because of this a frontal
E10  96 view gives the best picture. ^Take a good walk all around the mill if
E10  97 this is possible: you should be able to make several exposures from
E10  98 different directions and some quite dramatic effects may be obtained.
E10  99 ^If, of course, the farm buildings are in harmony with the mill, then
E10 100 a very pleasant landscape may result with the mill as the central
E10 101 feature, and, in fact, the inclusion of the mill may add just what is
E10 102 needed to an otherwise uninteresting view.
E10 103    |^Although I have expressed a preference for bright sunny days,
E10 104 quite a different type of picture may, of course, be obtained when
E10 105 photographing windmills in the early morning or silhouetted against a
E10 106 sunset in the evening. ^{Contre-jour} shots will also be possible,
E10 107 in many cases to good effect. ^You may be fortunate in having all the
E10 108 sunshine you want but with not a cloud in sight: the careful use of
E10 109 the correct filter will then be necessary to create the right
E10 110 atmosphere in the final picture*- perhaps a little shading-in will be
E10 111 required in enlarging.
E10 112    |^I hope that I have been able to convince you that photographing
E10 113 windmills is both rewarding and fascinating, and as I have pointed out
E10 114 already, opportunities for doing so are becoming less and less
E10 115 frequent. ^Start now on a similar collection and not only will it be
E10 116 of value for record purposes but your skill as a photographer will be
E10 117 tested to the full in obtaining really first-class results.
E10 118    |^One final word*- no special equipment is needed for taking
E10 119 windmill pictures. ^All the accompanying illustrations were taken on
E10 120 one or other of my two Ensign 320 folding cameras, both being fitted
E10 121 with the superb Ross Xpres lens*- cameras which are now obsolete but
E10 122 which can, however, be bought second-hand for about *+10 or *+12 these
E10 123 days.
E10 124 *<*4Experiment more with figure possibilities*>
E10 125 *<By *6RICARDO*>
E10 126    |^*4*"W*2HY *0don't you tell your beginners how lucky they are?*-
E10 127 to have cameras which do all their drawing for them.**" ^This was from
E10 128 a figure artist friend of mine who sees these prints now and then. ^He
E10 129 went on to say that, being able to shoot off a dozen or so negatives
E10 130 by way of practising composition, the photographer today had never had
E10 131 it so good. ^By way of comparison, he thinks nothing of roughing out
E10 132 anything up to a dozen sketches before settling down to the real
E10 133 thing*- a magazine illustration. ^When I asked him for some tips on
E10 134 figure work to pass on to my readers, his bland reply was to the
E10 135 effect that good figure form *1was *0good composition and that only by
E10 136 sticking at it, year in and year out, could one arrive! ^I should like
E10 137 to add that helpful criticism all the way along plus the environment
E10 138 of an enthusiastic society makes it much more of a pleasure.
E10 139 *<*6ON THE BEACH: \0*4Mrs. \0H. Saphier*>
E10 140    |^I *2SHOULD *0imagine that this subject matter looked quite
E10 141 exciting in colour, with the large stones (colourful greys)
E10 142 compensating for their prominence by their hues. ^But in monochrome
E10 143 these stones dominate far too much and detract from the figure design
E10 144 and particularly from the motif*- stone-throwing. ^The fundamental
E10 145 design of the two distant figures repeating the foreground figures is
E10 146 pleasing, and the low viewpoint was an excellent choice. ^However, the
E10 147 two dark big stones in the foreground, badly out of focus, tend to
E10 148 merge uncomfortably into the dark main figure and so cause a
E10 149 mirror-splitting of the design down the centre. ^Because these two
E10 150 central figures are looking strongly to the right the design also
E10 151 looks too heavy on the right. ^A sloping horizon does not help either.
E10 152    |^The second sketch concentrates on the nearer two figures only and
E10 153 a better figure form is given to the stone-thrower. ^Although these
E10 154 youngsters are now placed well over to the left, the design is well
E10 155 balanced, mainly because of the implied interest in the right, and the
E10 156 absence of unsightly rocks.
E10 157 *<*6HERE'S HOPING: \0*4E. Abrey*>
E10 158    |^F*2OR *0a study of concentration and good timing to get the penny
E10 159 so well placed for balance, this is good work. ^The simple tone of the
E10 160 girl's clothes is pleasing, and the selective focussing is ideal,
E10 161 throwing the distant trees into an essential diffusion, while the
E10 162 overhead lighting helps to dramatize and so to emphasize the girl's
E10 163 sharp concentration. ^One weakness is the superfluous amount of
E10 164 foreground, all the more noticeable because of the out-of-focus
E10 165 numbering, not good in this respect. ^Another fault concerns the
E10 166 arrangement of the girl's left arm, which contributes nothing to the
E10 167 atmosphere, while it could be quite useful. ^The figures in the rear,
E10 168 although out of focus, are also mildly disturbing.
E10 169    |^The next sketch suggests possible modifications. ^The left arm
E10 170 could be making one of many gestures suggesting excitement, and to
E10 171 link up with it the girl's mouth could well be expressing ^*"Oooh!**"
E10 172 ^A more distant viewpoint could have sharpened up the foreground
E10 173 figures slightly at the same stop, and to further reduce this useful
E10 174 area without resorting to trimming, the cross shadow of, say, an
E10 175 onlooker would have broken it up as shown. ^This shadow would also
E10 176 help to repeat and to balance the dark trees in the diagonally
E10 177 opposite corner.
E10 178    |^Is this all too suggestive of play-acting*- so possibly losing
E10 179 that air of reality which is the strong feature of this print? ^It all
E10 180 depends, but a little sensible directing now and then can make a big
E10 181 difference in the appeal of such an idea.
E10 182 *<*6LET ME TRY IT: \0*4L. Sharratt*>

E11   2 *<*4*'Sucu**' hit amazes Nina and Frederik*>
E11   3    |^*6NINA *4and Frederik are happily divided! ^Or at least, that's
E11   4 the expression which Nina used, when she spoke to me on the phone from
E11   5 her Birmingham hotel. ^And if anyone should jump to the conclusion
E11   6 that this is another marriage on the rocks, let me hasten to correct
E11   7 them*- there isn't a more happily married couple in the whole of show
E11   8 business.
E11   9    |^*0No, they are merely happily divided on a matter of personal
E11  10 opinion. ^For Nina told me that she actually prefers cabaret work, as
E11  11 opposed to appearing in large variety theatres*- Frederik, on the
E11  12 other hand, settles for the theatres in preference to the night clubs.
E11  13    |^*"So we agree to differ, bearing in mind that we each have our
E11  14 fair share,**" chuckled Nina.
E11  15    |^Nina told me that both she and Frederik were thoroughly enjoying
E11  16 their first full-scale tour of Britain, and that they had been
E11  17 pleasantly surprised by audience reaction throughout this country and
E11  18 in Eire.
E11  19    |^*4*"We hadn't previously seen very much of Britain, but now that
E11  20 we're able to get around to some extent, I can tell you that it has
E11  21 certainly come up to expectations.
E11  22    |^*0*"And Ireland was a special revelation. ^I hadn't been to
E11  23 Dublin before, though Frederik spent a few hours there last year,**"
E11  24 she said.
E11  25    |^Contrary to general belief, most of Nina and Frederik's work on
E11  26 the Continent is confined to theatres rather than cabaret. ^And it
E11  27 frequently happens that they adapt their act to each venue.
E11  28    |^But this hasn't proved necessary in Britain. ^*"We have several
E11  29 numbers which we regard as cabaret specialities,**" said Nina. ^*"Yet
E11  30 they appear to be so well-known here, that we're able to do them on
E11  31 stage.**"
E11  32    |^Having recently returned from Ireland when I spoke to her, Nina
E11  33 hadn't realised that their recording of *"Sucu-Sucu**" had climbed
E11  34 into the hit parade.
E11  35    |^*"It's quite amusing how this came about,**" she explained.
E11  36 ^*"The song was originally sent to us by a music publisher, and at the
E11  37 time it had a Spanish lyric. ^But we liked the melody so much that
E11  38 Frederik translated it into English and French*- we've also recorded
E11  39 it in French.**"
E11  40    |^*4Then one day during their cabaret season at the Savoy Hotel,
E11  41 they were relaxing for a few minutes in their dressing-room, watching
E11  42 {0TV}.
E11  43    |^*0And at the end of the *'Top Secret**' adventure yarn which they
E11  44 had switched on, they suddenly heard the strains of *'Sucu-Sucu**"*-
E11  45 complete with Frederik's lyric.
E11  46    |^*"We were amazed at the time,**" Nina continued. ^*"But when we
E11  47 discovered how popular the series is, we were not surprised when
E11  48 Laurie Johnson's recording came into the best-sellers. ^Actually, in
E11  49 view of this, I'm rather surprised to learn that our version has
E11  50 become a hit.**"
E11  51    |^I asked Nina about their subsequent plans, after the current
E11  52 British tour finishes early in December, and she told me that
E11  53 initially they will return to the Continent*- with the principal
E11  54 object of searching for new material.
E11  55    |^*"And we're hoping to come back to Britain in the spring, with a
E11  56 collection of new songs,**" she said.

E11  59 *<*5Bunny Lewis scrubbed floors before fame came*>
E11  60    |^*6A DISTINGUISHED *4war career counts for very little when
E11  61 hostilities cease and you don civilian clothes to start looking for a
E11  62 job. ^Take the case of composer-agent-promoter Bunny Lewis, for
E11  63 example.
E11  64    |^*0During the last war, he served with the famous Black Watch
E11  65 regiment and Special Air Services, won a Military Cross and was
E11  66 mentioned in dispatches. ^His first post-war job?... ^Scrubbing
E11  67 floors!
E11  68    |^*"It was the only thing I could find. ^My war career meant
E11  69 nothing, and I had a terrible time finding work. ^Finally, I turned to
E11  70 scrubbing floors to make ends meet. ^But eventually things got better
E11  71 and I ended up in the music business,**" Bunny told me this week.
E11  72    |^Bunny made his first contact with the music business in 1947,
E11  73 when he was employed as a publicist for impresarios **[SIC**] Tom
E11  74 Arnold and Prince Littler at dance halls. ^A little later, he worked
E11  75 for the {0BBC}, writing scripts for the *"Picture Page**" {0TV}
E11  76 series and then moved on to become professional manager at Francis,
E11  77 Day and Hunter, the music publishers.
E11  78    |^After a spell with Decca, he launched his own agency in 1955*-
E11  79 and that's when the Bunny Lewis success story really began. ^The
E11  80 agency grew to be a powerful concern, and Bunny now handles the
E11  81 affairs of such stars as Craig Douglas, the Mudlarks, Garry Mills, the
E11  82 Avons, Al Saxon, Lorrae Desmond, orchestra leader Harry Robinson,
E11  83 newcomer Doug Sheldon, and top disc jockeys like David Jacobs, Jack
E11  84 Jackson, Don Moss, Alan Freeman and David Gell.
E11  85    |^*4He personally records most of his artists' discs, promotes
E11  86 concert and variety dates and, as a result of appearances on the panel
E11  87 of {0*6BBC-TV}*4's *"Juke Box Jury,**" is also something of a
E11  88 {0TV} personality himself.
E11  89    |^*0In addition, it's important to note that Bunny is also one of
E11  90 Britain's finest and most successful lyricists.
E11  91    |^Remember David Whitfield's million-selling transatlantic hit
E11  92 *"Cara Mia**"? ^Bunny wrote the lyrics. ^He also wrote the words, too,
E11  93 for *"Girl Of My Best Friend,**" a big hit in Britain for Elvis
E11  94 Presley and a best seller in the States for promising newcomer Ral
E11  95 Donner.
E11  96    |^He also penned the lyrics for such memorable hits as Cliff
E11  97 Richard's *"Voice In The Wilderness**" and *"Livin' Lovin' Doll,**"
E11  98 Garry Mills' *"Top Teen Baby,**" Frankie Vaughan's *"Milord**" (which
E11  99 had special English words), David Whitfield's *"Rich Man, Poor Man,**"
E11 100 Max Bygraves' *"Little Train,**" Craig Douglas' *"Riddle Of Love**"
E11 101 and the Mudlarks' *"The Love Game.**"
E11 102    |^Vera Lynn has enjoyed success with many of Bunny's songs, among
E11 103 them *"Forget Me Not,**" *"The Homecoming Waltz,**" *"The Love Of My
E11 104 Life,**" *"The Windsor Waltz**" and *"Try Again,**" which was waxed in
E11 105 the States by Dean Martin. ^Orchestra leader Mantovani had a big
E11 106 seller with his instrumental *"Luxembourg Polka,**" which also hit the
E11 107 highspots in the {0U.S.}
E11 108    |^Apart from *"Riddle Of Love,**" Craig Douglas has waxed such
E11 109 Lewis songs as *"The Girl Next Door,**" *"My First Love Affair,**"
E11 110 *"My Hour Of Love**" and his latest release *"No Greater Love,**"
E11 111 written in collaboration with Michael Carr. ^Dickie Valentine did well
E11 112 with Bunny's *"Lazy Gondolier,**" while Al Saxon just missed the
E11 113 charts with his *"Blue Eyed Boy,**" which is covered on two new
E11 114 Stateside discs this week.
E11 115    |^*4Bunny also contributed songs to the Cliff Richard Film
E11 116 *"Expresso Bongo**" and for the savage, underworld movie *"The
E11 117 Frightened City.**"
E11 118    |^*0He worked with Norrie Paramour to produce two songs, *"I
E11 119 Laughed At Love**" and *"The Marvellous Lie**" (which has been waxed
E11 120 by Helen Shapiro).
E11 121    |^More songs by London-born Bunny*- who is married to French singer
E11 122 Janique Joelle, formerly a principal star with the famous *"Folies
E11 123 Bergere**" and has a six-year-old daughter, Fabienne*- will be heard
E11 124 in such future films as *"A Change Of Heart**" (which stars Janette
E11 125 Scott), *"The Painted Smile**" (in which Craig Douglas appears), and
E11 126 the much-publicised *"It's Trad, Dad.**"

E11 129 *<*7SINATRA WILL PUT HIMSELF IN THE BACKGROUND MUCH MORE*>
E11 130    |^*6IT *4seems generally agreed that Frank Sinatra's *"Granada**"
E11 131 is one of the most satisfying records he has cut for some time. ^His
E11 132 more recent releases on Capitol, both singles and albums, have all
E11 133 generated a feeling of staleness and apathy, which now seems to have
E11 134 been remedied with Frank's switch to his own label.
E11 135    |^*0There's little doubt that working for himself has caused
E11 136 Sinatra to shed his cloak of indifference, and it could well be that
E11 137 the revitalised Frank will aspire to even greater heights under these
E11 138 new circumstances.
E11 139    |^But just how long can Frank remain as a top recording star,
E11 140 having now long passed the stage of being a teenage idol? ^Will he
E11 141 continue more or less indefinitely, as Bing appears to be doing? ^Or
E11 142 what's more to the point, does he want to continue singing?
E11 143    |^It is increasingly apparent that he is devoting considerably more
E11 144 time these days to filming activities, involving straight acting
E11 145 roles. ^And earlier this year, he signed a 15-million dollar contract,
E11 146 which will keep him busy either producing or starring in movies for
E11 147 the next seven years. ^But as the *"Reprise**" label is his latest
E11 148 investment, it's obvious that he will devote a great deal of interest
E11 149 to this project*- though not necessarily with the object of showcasing
E11 150 himself as an artist.
E11 151    |^*4Speaking of his future plans recently, Sinatra said: ^*"One
E11 152 idea I have for the future is to develop more things that don't
E11 153 involve me personally and my talent.
E11 154    |^*0*"I'd like to be able to function more in other departments
E11 155 than I have been able to do in the past. ^With this new film deal, I
E11 156 want to try and find properties that don't concern me directly. ^Same
E11 157 thing with my record company*- I want to spend more time looking for
E11 158 new talent, soloists, song writers, young guys.**"
E11 159    |^In one of the rare interviews which Sinatra granted a couple of
E11 160 years back, he intimated that*- after more than 20 years in the
E11 161 business*- he would still rather sing than do anything else. ^But no
E11 162 doubt his 45 years are now catching up with him, particularly bearing
E11 163 in mind the tremendous pace at which he lives, and he sees himself
E11 164 today as a sort of patriarch of youth.
E11 165 *<*4Absorbing*>
E11 166    |^*0I have just been reading one of the most absorbing show-biz
E11 167 books to come my way for many months*- a no-punches-pulled character
E11 168 study of *"Sinatra And His Rat Pack**" by the American writer, Richard
E11 169 Gehman.
E11 170    |^It's a paper-back, selling at 3\0s. 6\0d. and published by
E11 171 Mayflower*- and for a remarkably revealing close-up of this
E11 172 controversial entertainer and his friends, I strongly commend it to
E11 173 you.
E11 174    |^The term *"Rat Pack**" seems to have superseded *"Clan**" in the
E11 175 description of Sinatra's followers and friends*- and the book devotes
E11 176 a full chapter to an analysis of each of them, including Humphrey
E11 177 Bogart who was the original leader of the *"Clan.**"
E11 178    |^So far as Frank is concerned there is a complete biography
E11 179 contained within the book*- and the basic facts are buried in such a
E11 180 welter of anecdotes it never fails to hold one's attention. ^No detail
E11 181 is overlooked*- from an assessment of his income (reckoned to be a 2
E11 182 1/2 million dollars last year) to a survey of his many love affairs*-
E11 183 real and rumoured*- which have played such a predominant part in his
E11 184 stormy career.
E11 185    |^*4Probably due to his rather squalid surroundings as a child,
E11 186 Frank is one of the most extravagant spenders in the entertainment
E11 187 world.
E11 188    |^*0One of his closest friends is quoted as saying: ^*"Frank
E11 189 doesn't spend money*- he destroys it!**" ^And examples galore are
E11 190 given to substantiate this point.
E11 191    |^When he was appearing in Miami, he had his favourite Broadway
E11 192 barber flown down to give him a haircut; when he broke a tooth, he had
E11 193 a dentist flown thousands of miles to fix it; he has a cuff-link
E11 194 collection which occupies two drawers; he owns more than 150 suits and
E11 195 countless shirts*- which he will need if the statement that he changes
E11 196 his shirt six times a day is correct!
E11 197    |^Despite his spendthrift habits, Sinatra is also exceedingly
E11 198 generous. ^*"Nobody knows all the wonderful things Frank does,**" says
E11 199 comedian Joey Bishop, who is a member of the *"Rat Pack.**" ^But
E11 200 Richard Gehman's book has unearthed some of the instances*- how Frank
E11 201 paid for Mildred Bailey's funeral, and has subsequently kept her
E11 202 former husband Red Norvo in regular work; how he helped Bela Lugosi
E11 203 when he was in hospital, although Frank had never met the actor; how
E11 204 when Phil Silvers' partner fell ill just before their cabaret debut at
E11 205 the Copacabana, Sinatra flew to New York to open with him, and how he
E11 206 gave some of his best lines in a picture to an actor who, he thought,
E11 207 needed them.
E11 208    |^And there's the fascinating story of the manner in which he aided
E11 209 the widow of an acquaintance of his*- Charles Morrison, owner of
E11 210 Hollywood's Morcambe night club. ^Learning that \0Mrs. Morrison was in
E11 211 financial trouble, Frank phoned to say that he was going to appear at
E11 212 the club for a couple of nights without payment*- and duly arrived
E11 213 complete with a 21-piece band!

E12   2 *<*6NATIONAL BRASS BAND CLUB*>
E12   3    |^*2FIRST *0I must express my thanks for the Christmas cards,
E12   4 calendars, diaries \0etc., sent to me by well-wishers throughout the
E12   5 brass band movement. ^Those thoughts are greatly appreciated, and I
E12   6 would like this to serve as my grateful acknowledgement, as it is
E12   7 impossible for me to write to everyone individually. ^May you all have
E12   8 a very happy, prosperous, and successful New Year in the cause of
E12   9 Brass Banding.
E12  10    |^On Monday December 19, I was honoured to welcome the arrival in
E12  11 this country of \0Mr. Herbert Hazelman of the American Bandmasters
E12  12 Association, and leader of the Greensboro High School Band, North
E12  13 Carolina. ^He came over on a fleeting visit to study British brass
E12  14 bands and their methods.
E12  15    |^At the invitation of Harry Mortimer I took him along to the
E12  16 {0B.B.C.} studios where he spent several hours listening to
E12  17 recordings of some of our top brass bands, and to say he was amazed at
E12  18 the tone and execution is putting it mildly. ^He admitted that what he
E12  19 heard was far in advance of anything they had in America. ^They have
E12  20 no brass bands of our instrumentation in America. ^Nearly all their
E12  21 bands, and they have a great many, are brass and wood-wind. ^Even
E12  22 their brass instruments are entirely different to ours, and as he puts
E12  23 it himself, being American, they have to have everything larger than
E12  24 anybody else, thus, larger instruments with larger bores.
E12  25    |^Their musical education, however, is far in advance of anything
E12  26 we have here. ^Music is a compulsory subject in schools and is paid
E12  27 for through the taxpayer. ^There appears to be much we can learn from
E12  28 each other.
E12  29    |^He attended an Executive Meeting of the Club in the evening,
E12  30 which had been specially put back a week for his benefit, and was
E12  31 delighted to make the acquaintance of the members at a well-attended
E12  32 meeting, to whom he gave a most absorbing and interesting re*?2sume*?2
E12  33 of the methods and activities of American bands, particularly school
E12  34 bands. ^He hopes to bring his band over to this country in the near
E12  35 future so that brass bandsmen may have the opportunity of hearing and
E12  36 studying their style of playing.
E12  37    |^\0Dr. Denis Wright entertained him on the following day Tuesday
E12  38 for a further session on brass bands. ^We hope to hear more of this
E12  39 meeting between our two countries. ^We are indebted to \0Mr. Gurney
E12  40 Doe, Secretary of the National Association of Brass Band Conductors,
E12  41 who was instrumental in bringing to our notice the proposed visit of
E12  42 \0Mr. Hazelman which enabled us to make direct contact with him as far
E12  43 back as last September.
E12  44    |^Have you made your New Year's resolution yet? ^If you are not a
E12  45 member of the National Brass Band Club, we hope that one of your
E12  46 resolutions will be to join our ranks, and so help us in furthering
E12  47 the welfare of brass bands, as well as deriving some benefits for
E12  48 yourself. ^Remember that the Club is a member of the National Music
E12  49 Council of Great Britain and is also affiliated to the Standing
E12  50 Conference of Amateur Music.

E12  59    |^*2RECENTLY, *0I received an invitation to attend the Annual
E12  60 Dinner of Cargo Fleet Band which, unfortunately, I was unable to
E12  61 accept. ^I understand they had a grand evening. ^As a band they are in
E12  62 good form and eager to improve on their splendid record.
E12  63    |^Crookhall Colliery Band, our area champions by their win at the
E12  64 {0*2C.I.S.W.O.} *0contest, have definitely proved themselves the
E12  65 band of 1960, for this district. ^After winning the {0*3D.H.} *0area
E12  66 contest for three successive years they struck a lean patch but have
E12  67 stormed back to the top.
E12  68    |^Next to the champions I would choose Easington Colliery and
E12  69 Wallsend Shipyard. ^Easington, runners up in the {0*3D.H.} *0area
E12  70 contest and {0*2C.I.S.W.O.} *0and winners of the Durham League
E12  71 Championships have an impressive record which was enhanced by winning
E12  72 2nd place at Newcastle Corporation Contest for the 2nd successive
E12  73 year.
E12  74    |^Wallsend Shipyard who were 3rd in the *3{0D.H.} *0area won the May
E12  75 Day Contest at the City Hall and also the Newcastle Corporation
E12  76 Contest.
E12  77    |^Another band with a fine record in 1960 is Cowpen and Crofton
E12  78 Colliery. ^They have an impressive array of prizes and will be welcome
E12  79 competitors in the championship section this year.
E12  80    |^I had the pleasure of attending South Shields {0S.A.} on the
E12  81 occasion of their Marshall Festival. ^Newcastle Temple Band and
E12  82 Sunderland Citadel Songsters rendered some of Bandmaster Marshall's
E12  83 finest pieces. ^Unfortunately, the acoustics of the very large hall
E12  84 rather marred the performances but on the whole there was some good
E12  85 playing and singing.
E12  86    |^The Temple Band were well served by horns and trombones and I was
E12  87 very impressed with South Shields Central Band (\0J. Strike). ^Small,
E12  88 but compact, they gave a nice rendering of the march, \5Neath the
E12  89 Flag. ^Captain Dean Goffin was the chairman.

E12  92    |^*2CONGRATULATIONS *0to our two Yorkshire bands launching the
E12  93 {0B.B.C.} competition *"Northern Brass**" on Friday, January 6.
E12  94 ^They set a very high standard and I am sure felt rather like a band
E12  95 who had drawn number one in any contest. ^It was a thrilling
E12  96 experience to be part of the studio audience on this occasion. ^A
E12  97 special word of congratulation for Yorkshire Imperial Metals Band,
E12  98 (\0Mr. Harry Tomkins) and \0Mr. George Hespe their conductor. ^I am
E12  99 sure everyone will agree that their programme was full of
E12 100 *"entertainment value**".
E12 101    |^1961 is the 25th anniversary of the Yorkshire Imperial Metals
E12 102 Band and I understand the occasion is to be celebrated on March 4 at
E12 103 the Griffin Hotel, Leeds. ^As this is the day following the band's
E12 104 appearance in the second round of the {0B.B.C.} competition it would
E12 105 be fitting if they could make it a double celebration.
E12 106    |^\0Mr. Fred Spencer, the solo euphoniumist of Brighouse and
E12 107 Rastrick, has just completed twenty five years with the band.
E12 108 ^Although still a very talented player, \0Mr. Spencer has decided to
E12 109 relinquish his position in favour of the solo baritone. ^\0Mr. Robert
E12 110 Davidson (junior) is to replace \0Mr. Spencer. ^The {0A.G.M.} of
E12 111 Brighouse & Rastrick Band has been fixed for January 22.

E12 114    |^*2THE *0last 'phone call I received in 1960 brought the
E12 115 distressing news of the passing of my dear old friend, Willie Macrae,
E12 116 late treasurer of the {0S.A.B.A.} and the Edinburgh Charities Band
E12 117 Association, both of which he served for many years until his
E12 118 retirement four or five years ago. ^He was taken suddenly ill and
E12 119 passed away in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. ^He was 60 years of age.
E12 120 ^Willie was a prominent member of Gorebridge and Arniston Band. ^There
E12 121 was a large attendance at the funeral, including the \0Hon. President
E12 122 of the {0S.A.B.A.} ^Our deep sympathy goes to \0Mrs. Macrae.
E12 123    |^I am informed that two members of Bowhill Colliery Band (horn and
E12 124 brass players) have joined Barry, Ostlere & Shepherds Band.
E12 125    |^A fine programme of Scottish music was given on the radio by
E12 126 Clydebank Burgh Band with Charles Telfer in command. ^This gave great
E12 127 pleasure to listeners in this part of the country. ^Congratulations to
E12 128 Tony Clucas, cornet soloist, on his brilliant rendering of Allison's
E12 129 *"Caledonia**".
E12 130    |^I agree with our Editor when he asks for a deeper understanding
E12 131 of Christmas. ^Do we ever give the idea a moment's thought? ^Goodwill
E12 132 should always be predominant, but why only at Christmas? ^Many take
E12 133 the sordid thought that Dicken's **[SIC**] *"Christmas Carol**"
E12 134 typifies Scroogelike attitude, while others go out just for
E12 135 merry-making and enjoyment, but to me the Holy Spirit of Christmas
E12 136 should be foremost in the minds of our band members. ^I am no
E12 137 kill-joy, but would love to see this period of the year treated with
E12 138 more reverence.
E12 139    |^I have had no news of the Scottish Amateur Music Association
E12 140 Course at Forfar during Christmas week. ^I understand that over 30
E12 141 pupils attended and studied under \0Dr. Denis Wright. ^I believe most
E12 142 of them hailed from Fifeshire. ^I have no doubt that under \0Dr.
E12 143 Wright nothing but success could crown the effort.
E12 144    |^A golden opportunity is afforded all bands who will be competing
E12 145 at the four Championship contests in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on
E12 146 February 25, to replenish their repertoire of music. ^The
E12 147 *"Bandsman's**" own stall will be there offering Selections, Marches
E12 148 \0etc. and there will be special bargains on sale for that day. ^Miss
E12 149 Bantin will be there in person ready to give her friendly advice to
E12 150 all who care to take advantage of her visit to the Capitol.
E12 151    |^According to the rules of the British Contesting Council,
E12 152 Scottish {0C.W.S.} Band, having won the championship three times in
E12 153 succession, will not be allowed to take part in the Usher Hall
E12 154 Championship in February. ^This year there will be new Scottish
E12 155 Champions who, along with {0S.C.W.S.} will represent our Country at
E12 156 the London Finals. ^It is hoped that the 2nd and 3rd prize winners
E12 157 will accompany these two bands.
E12 158    |^I note that most of the Kenneill Colliery Band officials have
E12 159 been replaced and there is a new secretary in place of \0Mrs.
E12 160 Kirkwood. ^I am sorry she has been displaced as she proved herself to
E12 161 be a model scribe. ^The new secretary is \0Mr. Dean, 62 Avon Place,

E13   3 *<*4The Value of Medals*>
E13   4 *<*4*- an introduction*>
E13   5 *<*6BY BOB MORE*>
E13   6    |^*6RECENT *4articles of *"Steps to Success**", have been for
E13   7 beginners in the Four Standard English dances, and we have covered
E13   8 sufficient to enable the non-dancer of a few months back to now dance
E13   9 around in the average ballroom without feeling self-conscious and with
E13  10 just enough figures to avoid the monotony of repetition.
E13  11    |^*0In the dancing school it is usually when this stage is reached
E13  12 that the pupil is asked to move on to a different class of
E13  13 instruction; either to an intermediate class, where an added variation
E13  14 is taught at each session, or to a Bronze and Silver Medallist Class,
E13  15 where time will be mainly spent in improving the style of dancing and
E13  16 the execution of the figures already learnt.
E13  17    |^The choice you make is sometimes determined by temperament, but
E13  18 is often determined by the type of dancing school you attend.
E13  19    |^The average person, attending for the first time, requires in
E13  20 most instances to learn enough to attend a dance and get round the
E13  21 floor, and probably regards it as rather a bind to have to attend a
E13  22 dancing school in order to do it.
E13  23    |^Having enrolled, however, they usually make new friends very
E13  24 quickly. ^The instructors, surprisingly, are human, helpful, good
E13  25 humoured, and have the uncanny knack when partnering you to make you
E13  26 feel like a good dancer. ^Before very long you are actually looking
E13  27 forward to your next visit, and the dancing school is by now referred
E13  28 to as *"The Club**" *4Your Club! ^*0Then, if you were observant, when
E13  29 you attended a social or a party night at the school, where the
E13  30 different standards were mixed together, you noticed that some dancers
E13  31 appeared to stand out. ^Not necessarily because they knew that latest
E13  32 variation with the hop, skip and jump, but because there was something
E13  33 about the way they poised their bodies; the smooth, effortless way
E13  34 they moved across the floor, particularly in the Slow Foxtrot; and
E13  35 their steps appeared to fit the music just that little bit better than
E13  36 other dancers on the floor.
E13  37    |^*4Well, they are usually *"The Medallists**".
E13  38    |^*0Maybe you feel the desire to be a good dancer, like the people
E13  39 whose dancing you admire; maybe you just want to go on belonging to
E13  40 *"The Club**", or maybe, having been shown some of the medals and
E13  41 certificates other pupils have won, you feel it would be nice to have
E13  42 some like them yourself, but whatever the reason, if you decide to
E13  43 become a medallist, you can supplement your lessons in *"Dance
E13  44 News**", because *"Steps to Success**" will, for the next series
E13  45 concentrate on helping you to get that Bronze Medal.
E13  46    |^First of all, what is required to win this award? ^To dance a few
E13  47 basic figures in Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep, with particular
E13  48 emphasis on Footwork, Timing and Carriage of the body.
E13  49    |^One other thing: the examination fee. ^In the {0I.D.M.A.} this
E13  50 is 12\0s. 6\0d. ^In most other societies the fee is a similar amount.
E13  51    |^You may say: ^*"Why is it necessary to pay a fee to win a Bronze
E13  52 Medal?**" ^Well, it should be obvious that the days of Fairy
E13  53 Godmothers with magic wands are long since past, and the money has to
E13  54 come from somewhere. ^The fee, which is a modest sum by present day
E13  55 standards, provides the examiner's fee (and he or she is usually one
E13  56 of the Dancing Profession's leading personalities); the office staff
E13  57 to handle the organisational side of the examination; the rent of the
E13  58 centre where the examination is conducted (although this may be
E13  59 conducted at your teacher's school) and, of course, the Medal,
E13  60 Certificate, Report on your dancing, and in some instances a Pin Badge
E13  61 to wear in the lapel or as a tie pin.
E13  62    |^I think you will agree this represents good value for money.

E13  64 *<*4The Value of Medals*>
E13  65 *<By Bob More*>
E13  66    |^*6P*2UPILS *0often ask, is it difficult to obtain a Bronze Medal,
E13  67 and as the late Professor Joad was heard to say many times on the
E13  68 Radio Brains Trust, ^*"That depends on what you mean by difficult**".
E13  69    |^I liken the Bronze Medal Test to the first examination of the
E13  70 child learning English. ^The child, quite obviously, would not be
E13  71 expected to produce a composition, but would be expected to know the
E13  72 alphabet, where the full stops and commas are used, and be able to
E13  73 write in a legible manner, something like, ^*"The cat sat on the
E13  74 mat**".
E13  75    |^The actual requirements for a Bronze Medal Test are, that the
E13  76 candidate dances three dances, Waltz, Foxtrot and Quickstep, with an

E13  78 Footwork, Timing and Alignment of the figures.
E13  79    |^In short, it is rather a test in understanding of the basic
E13  80 fundamentals of dancing, for without the correct foundation, nothing
E13  81 very worthwhile will be produced later.
E13  82    |^The figures used in the Bronze Test should not be difficult to
E13  83 elaborate. ^To use advanced figures, particularly if not danced well,
E13  84 can often result in a candidate being marked badly, so the first
E13  85 precept is, don't do too much. ^Better to remember the old maxim,
E13  86 *4*"Little and good**".
E13  87    |^*0The next problem is 1) does the teacher give the pupils a
E13  88 sequence of figures that progress completely round the room, or 2) a
E13  89 series of groups of figures, or 3) just teach the required figures and
E13  90 leave it to the pupil to amalgamate them as best they can.
E13  91    |^Different teachers and schools have varied ideas on this.
E13  92 ^Margaret and I, particularly in the lower grade tests, always teach a
E13  93 sequence. ^Argument against this, of course, is that the pupil's mind
E13  94 may go blank if they are nervous, and fail to produce any dancing at
E13  95 all, and it does sometimes happen. ^We think this is a lesser risk,
E13  96 however, than having a pupil get to a corner and forget how to get
E13  97 round it, when they haven't been given a sequence at all.
E13  98    |^Here in the pages of Dance News it is not entirely practicable to
E13  99 give a sequence of figures, for obviously, that which suits one shaped
E13 100 room, will not suit another. ^This we will endeavour to overcome by
E13 101 giving sequences to fit a comparatively small hall, and if you have
E13 102 the good fortune to be examined in a large hall. **[SIC**]
E13 103 *<*6THE WALTZ*>
E13 104    |^*0Taking the Waltz first, a group of figures that really must be
E13 105 included are, *4Natural Turn, Closed Change and Reverse Turn, *0danced
E13 106 in that order, and referred to as *"The Waltz basic amalgamation**".
E13 107 ^This, in turn, could be followed by two figures, long beloved of all
E13 108 Bronze Medallists, *4The Whisk, *0followed by the *4Syncopated Chasse,
E13 109 *0all of which have been described in recent *"Steps to Success*".
E13 110    |^These figures should cover the long side of the room, and we now
E13 111 have to negotiate the first corner, but before doing this we will
E13 112 emphasise some of the things you must concentrate on showing in your
E13 113 dancing of the basic amalgamation.
E13 114    |^First and foremost requirement in the Bronze Medal Test, correct
E13 115 footwork. ^For the Gentleman and Lady on their forward half of the
E13 116 Natural and Reverse Turns, and for the Gentleman on the Closed Change,
E13 117 this is 1) Heel; 2) Toe; 3) Toe.
E13 118    |^When we say the first step is taken on the heel, we mean the toe
E13 119 of this foot should be clear of the floor almost as soon as the foot
E13 120 moves forward, and, in fact, as the foot moves forward the distance
E13 121 between the floor and the toes should be gradually increasing. ^This
E13 122 we refer to as a *4*"heel lead**". ^*0A regular comment from examiners
E13 123 on bronze medal test reports is, ~*4*"Some heel leads missed**",
E13 124 *0which means, instead of the leading steps being taken as I have just
E13 125 described, the foot is pushed across the floor with the feet flat, or,
E13 126 worse still, with the toe in contact with the floor, and the heel
E13 127 raised.
E13 128    |^As the foot moves forward and is placed on the heel, the back
E13 129 heel should be allowed to rise easily, and naturally, then as the
E13 130 weight transfers to the front foot, and you rise on to it, retain
E13 131 light pressure (not weight) on the toe of the back foot as it moves to
E13 132 the side for Step 2. ^This will give a controlled movement.
E13 133 ^Similarly, as the foot closes on the third step, retain pressure (not
E13 134 weight) on the toe of the moving foot as the close is made, then lower
E13 135 heel of the supporting foot as the next step is taken.
E13 136 *<*6STEPS TO SUCCESS*>
E13 137 *<*4The Value Of Medals*>
E13 138 *<By *6BOB MORE*>
E13 139    |^*4I*2N *0last week's lesson we spoke about the footwork on
E13 140 forward movements in the Waltz basic amalgamation. ^This week we will
E13 141 talk about movement and floor coverage on these figures; that is,
E13 142 Natural Turn, Closed Change and Reverse Turn.
E13 143    |^Floor coverage is a topic on which many dancers have the wrong
E13 144 ideas, for to achieve good floor coverage it is not essential to take
E13 145 long steps. ^In fact, for a short person to overstride in an endeavour
E13 146 to cover a lot of ground will tend to unbalance the couple and make
E13 147 the movements unrhythmical.
E13 148    |^*4Of greater importance than length of stride is that the steps
E13 149 should be taken in the correct direction, *0and to do this we must
E13 150 turn the correct amount between the steps of a figure.
E13 151    |^The Natural Turn should commence facing diagonally to the wall
E13 152 and end *4facing diagonally to the centre. ^*0The following Closed
E13 153 Change will therefore commence facing diagonally to the centre and end
E13 154 in the same direction. ^Following this, the Reverse Turn will
E13 155 therefore commence *4facing diagonally to the centre and should end
E13 156 facing diagonally to the wall.
E13 157    |^*0Inexperienced dancers often have difficulty in ending the
E13 158 Natural Turn in the correct alignment; facing centre instead of
E13 159 diagonally to centre, and on the Reverse Turn they will often end
E13 160 facing wall instead of diagonally to wall. ^It is usually the man who
E13 161 is at fault, and the fault is, failure to turn the hips sufficiently
E13 162 between steps 5-6.
E13 163    |^The correct alignments for the last half of the Natural Turn
E13 164 (Steps 4-6), is: **[SIC**]
E13 165    |4) Backing down the room.
E13 166    |5) *4Pointing *0\0diag to centre.
E13 167    |6) Facing \0diag to centre.
E13 168    |^On step 5 the toe must turn out, and the foot turns more than
E13 169 the body. ^On step 6 the body must continue turning, to face where the
E13 170 feet point.
E13 171    |^The same applies on the 2nd half Reverse Turn, but here the
E13 172 alignments are:
E13 173    |4) Backing down the room.
E13 174    |5) *4Pointing *0\0diag to wall.
E13 175    |6) Facing \0diag to wall.
E13 176    |^Attention to these points of alignment will produce more
E13 177 effective movement.
E13 178    |^Also of help in covering the floor is correct footwork, which we
E13 179 stressed last week, and correct rise and fall.
E13 180    |^The normal rise and fall in the Waltz basic amalgamation is: Down
E13 181 as the first step in the bar is taken; commence to rise at the end of
E13 182 this step, as you take the second step, and then *4continue to rise as
E13 183 the feet close on the third step.
E13 184    |^*0Remember, though, if you step back on the first beat of a bar
E13 185 (Gentleman 4th step of Natural and Reverse Turns, Lady 1st step of
E13 186 Natural and Reverse Turns) *4you commence to rise in the body only.
E13 187 ^*0The heel of the foot remaining in contact with the floor, until
E13 188 after the second step is positioned.
E13 189    |^Before leaving the basic Waltz figures, there is one more point
E13 190 we must emphasise. ^A not infrequent comment Examiners find obliged to
E13 191 make on examination reports is, ^*4*"Some closes could be neater**".
E13 192    |^*0The feet should be closed with the heels and toes level.
E13 193 ^Inexperienced dancers often find this difficult, the Gentleman
E13 194 tending to close the foot forward, the Lady backwards, instead of
E13 195 together.
E13 196    |^This can usually be corrected by taking more care with the
E13 197 position of the step *4preceding *0the close.
E13 198    |^The bronze medallist should think of the three foot movements in
E13 199 these basic figures as: 1) Forward; 2) Side; 3) Close; or 1) Back; 2)
E13 200 Side; 3) Close.

E14   2 *<*4Budgerigar Breeding in a Flat*>
E14   3 *<Spare Room Converted to a Well-laid-out Birdroom*>
E14   4 *<By *6\0H. HOUGH*>
E14   5    |^*4W*2HEN *0first I decided to take up Budgerigar breeding I was
E14   6 in no particular hurry to start buying birds. ^The first thing I did
E14   7 was to glean every scrap of information on the subject, from every
E14   8 possible source.
E14   9    |^Bookshops, both new and second-hand, began to recognize me on
E14  10 sight, the local librarian knew just what I was after, and quite a few
E14  11 fanciers must have begun to dread my approach in my insatiable quest
E14  12 for more and more facts to add to my growing store of knowledge.
E14  13    |^All the time I made notes on feeding problems, odd habits, minor
E14  14 complaints and their treatment, all the do's and don'ts, \0etc., until
E14  15 I began to feel that I was in a position where I should certainly be
E14  16 able to cope with most of the difficulties which might reasonably fall
E14  17 to my lot. ^Now was the time to exchange theory for practice, and I
E14  18 began to consider how and where I was going to house my stock.
E14  19 *<*4Useful Packing-cases*>
E14  20    |^*0Being a flat dweller an outside aviary, with or without
E14  21 controlled flights, was out of the question, but I did possess a small
E14  22 spare room, and this, I decided, should become my birdroom. ^From a
E14  23 local warehouse I was lucky enough to obtain a number of excellent
E14  24 packing-cases each measuring 3\0ft x 18\0in x 18\0in.
E14  25    |^After laying the lids on one side, I lined the top, back and
E14  26 sides with hardboard, and drilled a 1 1/2\0in hole high up at one end
E14  27 of each to furnish an entrance to the nest-boxes. ^To give a better
E14  28 finish to the nest-box end of the cage, I screwed on some natural cork
E14  29 bark, cutting an irregular hole to correspond with the nest-box
E14  30 entrance hole.
E14  31 *<*4Natural Knothole*>
E14  32    |^*0This was to represent the natural knothole through which wild
E14  33 Budgies enter their nest, and I must say that this addition has proved
E14  34 its worth in many ways. ^When I later introduced my birds to their new
E14  35 quarters, it was amazing how quickly the pairs rounded and smoothed
E14  36 off the holes to suit their own requirements.
E14  37    |^The bark also gave the birds something on which they could
E14  38 satisfy their penchant for gnawing, without causing any material
E14  39 damage to the structure of the cages themselves. ^It also, I should
E14  40 add, formed an easy means of re-entry, when the chicks made their
E14  41 first tentative exit from the nests.
E14  42    |^It is amazing how quickly and well a young chick can scuttle up a
E14  43 piece of bark, and the constant fluttering of their wings during this
E14  44 operation must certainly help to strengthen them in preparation for
E14  45 early flight.
E14  46    |^The next job was to fit a 1 1/2\0in shelf at the back of the
E14  47 cage, with a series of carefully spaced holes in which I could hook
E14  48 the seed, grit and water vessels. ^A clock-spring clip was screwed
E14  49 below the shelf to hold a piece of cuttlefish bone, and I made a
E14  50 bottom tray from hardboard and beading.
E14  51    |^A narrow rail, under which the tray slid smoothly, also served as
E14  52 the bottom fixing for the cage fronts, which I bought ready made. ^All
E14  53 I had to do now was to attach the nest-boxes, which I fastened by
E14  54 means of carefully measured nuts and bolts, taken right through the
E14  55 end of the cage and the cork bark.
E14  56    |^The other essential was a good-sized flight cage, and this I made
E14  57 from multiple plyboard to my own design. ^It stands at eye-level (on
E14  58 two strong brackets) and is 4\0ft long, 2\0ft high and 14\0in wide.
E14  59 ^The roof is covered with 1/2\0in mesh netting, and the upper 20\0in
E14  60 of the front is composed of two sliding glass panels.
E14  61    |^This cage is capable of being divided into two halves, by means
E14  62 of a sliding hardboard partition. ^I can recommend this type of cage,
E14  63 as it is impossible for the birds to throw out any seed husks, and I
E14  64 found that they very quickly get used to the idea of a glass front.
E14  65 *<*4Working Table and Desk*>
E14  66    |^*0The cages were arranged on tables and shelves opposite the
E14  67 flight cage, and right in front of the window I placed a table which
E14  68 was to serve as both a working table and office desk. ^A fitted
E14  69 cupboard in the room acts as repository for food and accessories so
E14  70 that the whole place can be kept neat and tidy.
E14  71    |^All cages are cleaned out daily, and I do think that this is a
E14  72 *"must**" when a number of birds are kept indoors, especially during
E14  73 the breeding season, when the hens' droppings are loose and copious,
E14  74 and, if neglected, will soon give grounds for complaint.
E14  75    |^Before obtaining my birds, I gave careful consideration to the
E14  76 problems of diet, not only for adult birds but for the future chicks
E14  77 which I hoped to raise. ^I started my food list with best Spanish
E14  78 canary seed, to which I added 25 per cent of white millet. ^This was
E14  79 to act as the basic diet, to which I would add natural greenfoods as
E14  80 and when obtainable.
E14  81    |^Among these I carefully listed chickweed, seeding grasses,
E14  82 lettuce, carrot, apple and groundsel. ^All these items which I still
E14  83 offer when obtainable contain most of the essential vitamins, and
E14  84 together with the basic seed and grit seem to satisfy all the
E14  85 nutritional needs of the adult Budgerigar.
E14  86    |^For feeding mothers, I decided to add a mixture of soaked groats
E14  87 and canary seed, with the addition of a little wheat germ, which I
E14  88 found was easily obtainable in the form of a *"wheat germ**" baby
E14  89 food. ^I have maintained this diet since with excellent results. ^The
E14  90 only addition I have made is an occasional slice of orange, of which
E14  91 my birds seem passionately fond.
E14  92 *<*4Care and Study*>
E14  93    |^*0At last the time had arrived to purchase my first stock of
E14  94 birds, and this involved a great deal of study and care. ^There could
E14  95 be no slip up here, or all my preparations and hopes would have been
E14  96 in vain.
E14  97    |^I wanted good birds in every way*- in head, type, body shape,
E14  98 spots and stance. ^And I knew full well that I had to stand or fall by
E14  99 my own judgment. ^Well, I *"paid my money and made my choice**" and
E14 100 time alone will tell what errors of judgment I have made. ^So far, I
E14 101 am reasonably satisfied with the results.
E14 102    |^I have always been fascinated by *"Red-eyes,**" so I suppose it
E14 103 was only natural that my first birds consisted of two pairs of Lutinos
E14 104 and a beautiful Albino cock. ^(At least I would have no worries about
E14 105 spots.) ^The Lutinos were of good size and colour, while the Albino
E14 106 had just a faint suffusion of blue on the breast.
E14 107 *<*4Well-spotted Pairs*>
E14 108    |^*0In a strong light, his body and head have a definite pinkish
E14 109 glow, which makes it a most attractive bird. ^From another source I
E14 110 obtained a well-balanced pair of Grey Greens and a pair of Light
E14 111 Greens, all of good type and well spotted.
E14 112    |^My next was a young, untried cock, sired by a Light Green cock
E14 113 out of a Whitewing Cobalt hen. ^He has an ideal stance on the perch,
E14 114 and, with his yellow face, white wings and peacock blue back and tail,
E14 115 he certainly caught the eye. ^Visually he makes the grade.
E14 116    |^After some consideration I also bought his parents, with a view
E14 117 to breeding back to stabilize the strain. ^A nicely matched pair of
E14 118 Cobalts, and a pair of Greys, together with a well-coloured Violet
E14 119 cock were my next buy, and, last of all, I purchased a large Greywing/
E14 120 Normal White hen.
E14 121    |^How these birds were eventually paired, and the many snags that
E14 122 arose during the first breeding session, will form the basis of my
E14 123 next article. ^This, I hope, will prove that there is sometimes more
E14 124 to be learned from a mistake than one at first realizes.

E14 127 *<When Your Promising Winners are Beaten, says {0*6R. F.} WARLOW*>
E14 128    |^*4M*2AY *0I retract from my promise to follow up on other
E14 129 subjects to deal with a matter which I know to be of interest to
E14 130 readers of this page? ^I am going to write about Border Canaries, but
E14 131 part of the lesson may be applied to other varieties. ^The subject is
E14 132 show birds and, in particular, those that have been amongst the
E14 133 winners. ^Now some fanciers, both young and old, seem to think that
E14 134 once a bird has beaten a number of other birds, providing that it
E14 135 meets the same company again it should go on winning. ^Indeed, good
E14 136 judges have been criticized, without just cause, when past form has
E14 137 been upset. ^And it is true that the opinions of judges sometimes
E14 138 differ, but it is not surprising that some exhibits which are very
E14 139 close together in merit, sometimes change places as the show season
E14 140 progresses.
E14 141 *<*4Sound Judgment*>
E14 142    |^*0Many fanciers are not good judges of their own birds, although
E14 143 they may show sound judgment when assessing the merits of those of
E14 144 other people. ^That, after all, is a human trait which most of you
E14 145 will understand. ^I know, because I have passed through the phase when
E14 146 all the birds in my birdroom appeared to have all the virtues of great
E14 147 winners. ^Apart from looking good in a stock cage, a show bird has to
E14 148 pass an exacting test in which its virtues and its temperament are
E14 149 well and truly tried. ^A bird which has all the necessary physical
E14 150 attributes may fail, either because it has been proven that it cannot
E14 151 be trained to show itself off properly, or may be because it does not
E14 152 like shows.
E14 153    |^When I was a young enthusiast I liked nothing better than to
E14 154 listen to more experienced fanciers talking, and I sometimes found it
E14 155 good fun. ^Not only did I find that birds are admired when on show, I
E14 156 also found out that they come in for some searching criticism. ^I was
E14 157 always interested, and I still am today, to note how the opinions of
E14 158 experienced fanciers differ when they are assessing the merits of a
E14 159 bird.
E14 160    |^A really excellent bird usually meets with approval, but there
E14 161 are a few who cannot be convinced even by the best. ^Maybe they lack
E14 162 knowledge of what is required or perhaps they are just prejudiced,
E14 163 and, of course, that is a fault that everyone has to guard against.
E14 164 ^Let us look at the Standard of Excellence for the Border Canary which
E14 165 is laid down by the specialist clubs. ^The standard says that the
E14 166 position of the bird should be semi-erect, standing at an angle of 60
E14 167 degrees, and that the bird should move in a gay and jaunty manner with
E14 168 full poise of the head. ^Out of a total of 100 marks which are to be
E14 169 allocated, 15 are awarded for these attributes, and it has to be
E14 170 remembered that a bird has to earn each one of them when on the
E14 171 judging bench. ^Suffice to say that many birds which have appeared
E14 172 under me have earned very poor markings for carriage and position.
E14 173 *<*4How About the Future?*>
E14 174    |^*0I wonder whether you have heard it said of a popular winner:
E14 175 ^*"It is good today, but I doubt whether it will win in five or six
E14 176 weeks' time.**" ^An experienced fancier can often make such a
E14 177 prophesy, simply because he has noticed something which is in the
E14 178 course of going wrong. ^Returning to the standard again, it stipulates
E14 179 that the plumage should be close, firm, fine in quality, presenting a
E14 180 smooth, glossy, silken appearance free from frills and toughness. ^In
E14 181 a single word, we refer to these virtues as quality. ^Early in the
E14 182 show season quite a number of birds win which appear to have excellent
E14 183 quality, but the discerning eye can already see that some of the
E14 184 winners are already carrying too much feather. ^Birds continue to add
E14 185 feathers for some time after they appear to have completed the moult,
E14 186 and these additional feathers can change the appearance of what
E14 187 appeared once as a good show bird.

E15   2 *<*6*"TO FINISH THE SEASON**"*>

E15   4    |^T*2HOSE FAMILIAR WORDS *0will now have appeared on the
E15   5 fixture-card, and the last entry made in the hunting diary for
E15   6 1960-61*- a season which will go down in history not only as the most
E15   7 open, but as the wettest *"since the memory of man \1runneth not to
E15   8 the contrary.**"
E15   9    |^Even before the season started, the land was saturated; and so it
E15  10 remained throughout, with never a chance of drying out, until the
E15  11 fantastically dry and sunny spell that set in at the beginning of
E15  12 March. ^Fortunately this will obviate cuckoo corn for the farmer; but
E15  13 as regards foxhunting, there have been days lately when one might as
E15  14 well have expected hounds to be able to run in June, for all the scent
E15  15 there has been.
E15  16    |^Strangely enough, despite all the wet, the earlier part of the
E15  17 season was not as good scenting as might have been expected, scent
E15  18 being literally washed away. ^But from December onwards there came
E15  19 reports from every quarter of sport well above the ordinary, and with
E15  20 the drains full of water, more foxes killed above ground. ^Stoppages
E15  21 from snow and frost have been practically nil. ^But the season has
E15  22 been marred in many countries by disastrous outbreaks of
E15  23 foot-and-mouth, which are always more frequent in a mild season.
E15  24 *<*4Signs of Wear*>
E15  25    |^*0Though always reluctant to leave off, Masters and hunt servants
E15  26 may sometimes regard the finish of the season with mixed feelings,
E15  27 especially when it peters out in a blaze of scentless sunshine.
E15  28 ^Horses and hounds have had a hard time in going like porridge, and
E15  29 exceptionally long days, and even in the bigger establishments there
E15  30 are signs of wear-and-tear. ^Horses, though still sound, may be
E15  31 running up a bit light, and there are probably quite a number of lame
E15  32 hounds, due to cuts from wire or flints. ^On chalky downlands these
E15  33 flints have become an increasing menace, the South and West \0Wilts
E15  34 having been particular sufferers in this respect. ^The plough has
E15  35 brought the flints to the surface, and they cut like razors, not only
E15  36 into hounds' feet but horses' heels. ^Another source of trouble is
E15  37 pig-netting, in which hounds are liable to get hung up and pull their
E15  38 stifles.
E15  39    |^What with casualties, and bitches in hot kennel, a huntsman in a
E15  40 small establishment of up to 25 couple may sometimes have difficulty
E15  41 in drawing a sizeable pack for two days a week. ^But apart from these
E15  42 domestic problems the question of the prolongation of the season
E15  43 depends on agriculture. ^Foxhunting, after all, is a *"trespass by
E15  44 courtesy**" and since the courtesy is on the part of the farmer, it is
E15  45 the latter's interests that finally decide the matter.
E15  46    |^Those countries that have a bit of hill or downland are often
E15  47 able to continue operations after the vale is closed. ^The Berkeley,
E15  48 for instance, are usually invited to retire to the slopes of the
E15  49 Cotswolds for a bit of spring hunting. ^Most moorland packs can also
E15  50 remain in session, taking advantage of which, that inveterate
E15  51 foxcatcher, Captain Ronnie Wallace, is accustomed to wind up his
E15  52 season by taking the Heythrop hounds on a visit to Exmoor, while in
E15  53 the Southdown country the killing of a brace or two of May foxes on
E15  54 their open downlands is almost traditional, though in the vale hounds
E15  55 have long ago shut up shop.
E15  56 *<*4A Favourite Dodge*>
E15  57    |^*0One of the most insistent end-of-the-season problems is that of
E15  58 lambing ewes. ^However carefully the Master may arrange his draw, it
E15  59 is always at the back of his mind that hounds may run in their
E15  60 direction, and will have to be stopped. ^One of the favourite dodges
E15  61 in the repertoire of the hunted fox is to run through sheep foul.
E15  62 ^And, in fact, with ewes and lambs all over the place, it is sometimes
E15  63 difficult for the Master to make a day of it.
E15  64    |^Damage, too, is a word that weighs heavily on the hearts of
E15  65 Master, Field Master and Secretary. ^It is fair to say that damage to
E15  66 grassland*- or at any rate permanent grass*- in the earlier part of
E15  67 the season, even when as wet as this one, is unlikely to be
E15  68 particularly serious. ^It will all wash back with the next rain. ^But
E15  69 no farmer wants to see his fields cut up in February or March,
E15  70 especially if he has just rolled them. ^Even on old pasture with
E15  71 plenty of bottom, the mark is there for the summer, and it will
E15  72 certainly put paid to any leys*- and ley farming has made the problem
E15  73 more acute.
E15  74    |^Had the wet weather continued, there is no doubt that most Hunts
E15  75 would have had to stop a good deal earlier than usual. ^Hounds would
E15  76 no doubt have continued to run as though tied to their fox, and we
E15  77 would have started worrying about the prospects for the
E15  78 Point-to-Point. ^But what a mark we should have made! ^And the faster
E15  79 we galloped, especially downhill, the worse it would have been. ^Even
E15  80 now, after three weeks of sun, there is, as I write, only a top crust
E15  81 on the clays, under which the land is like a glue pot. ^And the damage
E15  82 then will be worse than ever. ^Nor would it take much rain to reduce
E15  83 it once more to the porridge stage.
E15  84 *<*4In Leicestershire*>
E15  85    |^*0Elsewhere, however, as in Leicester, for instance, the land
E15  86 really has dried out, and the arable was mostly in tilth by the middle
E15  87 of March. ^But only a few short weeks ago it was a different story.
E15  88 ^Let's look back and remember....
E15  89    |^Hounds are scudding over the grass like a covey of grouse before
E15  90 the wind. ^You've got away on terms and the old horse is pulling a
E15  91 double handful; you give him his head and let him stride on. ^What
E15  92 else would you do when hounds are running? ^It's either go on or go
E15  93 home. ^The ground squelches under foot, but he can go through the dirt
E15  94 all day*- and what a feel he does give you! ^But by Gad, it *1is
E15  95 *0deep! ^Horses in front are throwing up clods of turf in your face,
E15  96 as they go in fetlock deep. ^Better take him up to the front and have
E15  97 first cut at that fence before the others start bashing it. ^The old
E15  98 horse heaves himself out of the mud and jumps it cleanly. ^On you go,
E15  99 in the wake of the flying pack....
E15 100    |^Well, the hunt has only started, and you've only crossed the
E15 101 first field. ^Go back the next day and walk round that farm after the
E15 102 Hunt has been over it. ^What would you say if you were the farmer?
E15 103 ^There is more owed to him than we foxhunters sometimes realise. ^That
E15 104 is the thought with which to finish the season.
E15 105 *<*6AN EASY-GOING SPRING*>
E15 106 *<*4By \0Dr. {0E. A. R.} Ennion*>
E15 107 *<Equinoxial Tides...*>
E15 108 *<Unexpected Finds...*>
E15 109 *<Tree-Sparrows and Rock-Sparrows*>
E15 110    |^T*2HE SHORE *0is settling down to its everyday ways again. ^We
E15 111 had, three-parts of the way through March, a series of exceptionally
E15 112 high spring tides, even for the equinox. ^Scudding seas and flying
E15 113 sand, sheets of spray sweeping high over cliffs and across roads where
E15 114 I never remember having to drive through spray before, were the order
E15 115 of the day... ^Bedlam outside as well as in, with curtains flapping
E15 116 and doors banging. ^The waders along the tideline hardly knew whether
E15 117 they were on their heads or on their heels, what with the driven
E15 118 spume, the blinding spray and both wind and water playing tricks and
E15 119 taking them at unexpected speeds and angles.
E15 120 *<*4Co-ordination of Muscle and Eye*>
E15 121    |^*0In the ordinary way a dunlin knows to a T how far a wave is
E15 122 going to ripple up a beach, how long he can wait before turning and
E15 123 running back before it to avoid, as it were, getting his knickers wet.
E15 124 ^A redshank knows exactly when to check his speed to alight at the
E15 125 right spot at the right moment to snatch a titbit sweeping out to sea
E15 126 again on the undertow. ^Such instant co-ordination of muscle and eye
E15 127 is commonplace for them; swift movements and decisions that, for us,
E15 128 would require the skill of a juggler, the practised fingers of a
E15 129 pianist. ^On it, indeed, depends their livelihood, for the prey they
E15 130 catch is less than a split second slower off the mark. ^So gusty winds
E15 131 and unexpected draughts, freakish ripples and drenching waves must be
E15 132 darned annoying while they last. ^And they lasted, off and on, for
E15 133 days.
E15 134    |^But now it's over. ^The waves, their fury spent, are plashing
E15 135 lazily on the beach as if they couldn't get tough if they tried. ^The
E15 136 wind has dwindled to a gentle breeze. ^There are no white horses,
E15 137 though there is a thin white line wherever wave meets rock along the
E15 138 island shores and, beyond them, a slow heave along the line of the
E15 139 horizon which shows that, away out there, a fair swell must be
E15 140 running, still.
E15 141    |^Like the deep breathing of an athlete resting after his
E15 142 exertions, it takes time for normal rhythm and speed to supervene.
E15 143 ^But in shallower waters near the shore there is only the gentlest
E15 144 rise and fall. ^And there are little groups of waders resting,
E15 145 preening, bathing, stretching wings and legs, and yawning*- doing all
E15 146 the jobs there's been no time to do in the last few days. ^The dunlin
E15 147 and the oystercatchers seem especially content to laze and just enjoy
E15 148 the sunshine and the calm after the storm. ^Turnstones, restless as
E15 149 ever, keep wandering about. ^No sooner does one of them run into the
E15 150 ripples of the burn that spreads across the beach, to bathe, than
E15 151 others tear across the sand to join him, regardless of the fact that
E15 152 most of them have bathed before, not once but ten times, within the
E15 153 last half-hour. ^They can't need to*- they are like those over-fussy
E15 154 women who must be forever cleaning, cleaning, cleaning when there
E15 155 isn't a speck of dirt about that a man can see.
E15 156    |^And redshanks, as ever at this time of year, too, are chasing
E15 157 each other about. ^It's the spring in their blood. ^No cock redshank
E15 158 worthy of his coral legs can bear to see another within twenty yards
E15 159 of him without running to drive the other fellow off. ^I've known them
E15 160 keep this rival-chasing up for hours at a stretch when the chasee
E15 161 couldn't, or wouldn't, get away: no wonder, when you handle them,
E15 162 redshanks are so surprisingly thin and scrawny.
E15 163 *<*4Wagtails in the Trap*>
E15 164    |^*0What with one thing and another we have had little time or
E15 165 opportunity since we returned home to do much trapping, even in the
E15 166 garden: it is our leanest spring in this respect for ten busy years.
E15 167 ^But the other day, while I was digging a trench for some cuttings, my
E15 168 wife looked up and saw half a dozen pied wagtails fluttering in or
E15 169 around the Heligoland trap. ^It was just before dusk and, all unknown
E15 170 to us, this small party of them must have been using the willow bushes
E15 171 beside it for their roost. ^We slipped down and caught three: a
E15 172 beautiful silky-white and ebony cock and two hens, one adult and one a
E15 173 de*?2butante. ^At least two more were flitting around overhead. ^We
E15 174 shall now know them if we meet them on the beach.
E15 175    |^The trap is kept out of action, in case a bird might find its way
E15 176 in and get imprisoned, but it is possible to *"set**" it again
E15 177 instantly, and now and then I cannot for the life of me resist
E15 178 temptation. ^One such occasion happened a week or so ago when I
E15 179 noticed that the bushes round its mouth were teeming with sparrows.
E15 180 ^We have long since given up ringing *1them, {0*0i.e.},
E15 181 house-sparrows. ^From well over 800 ringed, we had not had a single
E15 182 recovery from beyond a mile radius! ^But there were starlings among
E15 183 the sparrows (which provide many and often most interesting records)
E15 184 and also, unless my eyes and ears were failing me, a good many
E15 185 tree-sparrows.

E16   2 *<*5Design Discussion*>
E16   3 *<*4In which the Editor extends some arguments contained in last
E16   4 month's *"Showdown**" article*>
E16   5    |^T*2HE *0idea was expressed in *2MOTOR SPORT *0last month that
E16   6 enthusiasts who know about cars and drive them far and fast should
E16   7 eschew *"vintage**" designs and, by purchasing modern models for their
E16   8 daily motoring, set an example to the car-buying public of the
E16   9 benefits of such technical items as {0i.r.s.}, elimination of the
E16  10 propeller shaft, reduction of greasing points and so on.
E16  11    |^Leaving out cars with front-wheel-drive, in which independent
E16  12 springing of the undriven back wheels is easy to achieve (or if for
E16  13 some reason it is ignored, merely means that a light axle beam is
E16  14 involved) and rear-engined cars in which {0i.r.s.} is virtually
E16  15 forced upon the designer, there are the following front-engined/
E16  16 rear-drive cars the enlightened manufacturers of which provide
E16  17 independent suspension of the back wheels, for maximum riding and
E16  18 cornering efficiency on rough roads and the elimination of judder and
E16  19 heelspin under acceleration which is a shortcoming to which rigid rear
E16  20 axles are prone, particularly when unlocated and attached to the
E16  21 chassis by leaf-springs:*-
E16  22 **[LIST**]
E16  23    |^Those, then, are the cars you should go for, unless you decide
E16  24 that divorcing the engine from the driven wheels is ridiculous and
E16  25 prefer a car with front-wheel-drive or rear-engine location.
E16  26 ^Personally, based on satisfactory experience of the {0*2B.M.C.}
E16  27 ADO*015 and *2ADO*050 designs, I vote for the former. ^Citroe"n, the
E16  28 World's most advanced car, has had driven front wheels for nearly 30
E16  29 years and the DS in its latest, more powerful form is a very fine
E16  30 motor car indeed; if ever it gets the air-cooled flat-six engine which
E16  31 rumour says its designer always intended for it, it will combine in
E16  32 one vehicle practically everything I find desirable. ^So enamoured
E16  33 have I become by the safety factors inherent in a front-wheel-driven
E16  34 car that I long for the day when Alec Issigonis will trigger off the
E16  35 next {0B.M.C.} offering of that species. ^He, like the Citroe"n
E16  36 designer, has been obliged to use a conventional engine already in
E16  37 production.
E16  38    |^You cannot tell me that the bulgy bonnet of the old
E16  39 torsion-bar-sprung Morris Minor wasn't intended to protect a flat-four
E16  40 engine, whereas Issigonis was prevailed upon to use an existing
E16  41 side-valve lump of iron when the car went into production. ^And while
E16  42 this talented designer has shown quite outstanding genius in placing
E16  43 another production {0B.M.C.} engine across the front of his Mini to
E16  44 save space within the body envelope, I wonder whether, at all event in
E16  45 his dreams, Issigonis hadn't visualised a flat-four, or even a
E16  46 swash-plate power unit, for these brilliantly conceived (if less
E16  47 conscientiously assembled) little cars? ^I suggest this in spite of
E16  48 Issigonis' statement in the current issue of *1Road & Track *0that
E16  49 designing new engines as well as new cars is too big an undertaking
E16  50 for him to adopt it....
E16  51    |^It remains to be seen whether {0B.M.C.} can achieve the same
E16  52 success with larger versions of the *2ADO*015 layout. ^Personally I
E16  53 believe they will, should their future policy lie in that direction,
E16  54 despite rumours that nothing larger has followed the Minis because
E16  55 there is a limit to how much power can be used with {0f.w.d.}
E16  56 without an excursion into the realms of dangerous handling
E16  57 characteristics, a theory that the Cooper-Minis go some way towards
E16  58 refuting and to which I do not subscribe. ^I would like to see Alec
E16  59 Issigonis, aided by rubber-man Alex Moulton, cock a snoot at Citroe"n
E16  60 with, say, a big trans-engine {0f.w.d.} car powered by a 3-litre
E16  61 6-cylinder {0B.M.C.} engine, but whether a longer engine could be
E16  62 used across the car without seriously restricting the steering lock is
E16  63 open to conjecture.
E16  64    |^Whether your choice is for front-drive, rear-engine or divorced
E16  65 power unit and axle in a car with all-round independent suspension,
E16  66 there is still great variety to be found in the technical approach of
E16  67 1962. ^I was amused recently to read in Lord Montagu's entertaining
E16  68 journal *1The Veteran and Vintage Magazine *0the statement that in
E16  69 1898 *"motor car design was in a state of flux: engines were placed in
E16  70 front, amidships, and at the rear; some were horizontal, others
E16  71 vertical, while at least one*- the Clement-Panhard*- was slightly
E16  72 inclined.**" ^The position is not so very different over sixty years
E16  73 later and inclination of the engine to secure a low bonnet line, as on
E16  74 the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, {0B.M.W.} 1500, Chrysler Valiant, and
E16  75 Peugeot 404, for example (or a compact boot in the case of the
E16  76 rear-engined Simca 1000) has extended to the underfloor engines of the
E16  77 \0VW 1500, and the Fiat 500 Giardiniera in which the engine has been
E16  78 turned on its side, while the data on the opposite page show that
E16  79 cylinder disposition has by no means reached standardisation.
E16  80 ^Moreover, {0N.S.U.} have their Wankel rotary engine as an extremely
E16  81 compact power unit of the near-future, and Rover and others are
E16  82 convinced that the gas-turbine will eventually have its day.
E16  83    |^One aspect of engine design not yet exploited by British
E16  84 designers is that of smoothing out the 4-cylinder power unit and
E16  85 improving its durability by providing it with five crankshaft
E16  86 bearings, as adopted by Alpha Romeo, {0B.M.W.}, Chevy *=2, Facellia,
E16  87 Goggomobil, Simca and Volvo.
E16  88    |^Considerable attention is being paid to the reduction of chassis
E16  89 greasing points. ^But while Rover is frequently named as a notable
E16  90 pioneer in this field, the Triumph Herald is all too often ignored,
E16  91 although it, too, can be very quickly serviced; but in reduction of
E16  92 greasing nipples Fiat and {0N.S.U.} on their smallest models do
E16  93 rather better. ^Only the {0D.A.F.} from Holland and the front-drive
E16  94 Renault R4 from France appear to have eliminated greasing points
E16  95 *1entirely, *0but in this country Vauxhall and Rootes have made very
E16  96 considerable progress in reducing the periods between or the amount of
E16  97 servicing necessary, while in America Oldsmobile, Ford, Mercury,
E16  98 Lincoln, Plymouth, Dodge and Chrysler have adopted pre-lubricated
E16  99 chassis bearings that postpone replenishment until 30,000 miles have
E16 100 been run, which, in conjunction with oil changes recommended after
E16 101 6,000 miles and cooling systems intended to hold their water for some
E16 102 two years, has taken most of the tedium out of the servicing routine.
E16 103 ^So much interest attaches to this aspect of car ownership, especially
E16 104 when service stations are frequently overcrowded and inefficient, and
E16 105 when home-mechanics probably prefer to spend their hours in the garage
E16 106 tuning, if not *"souping,**" their engines to grovelling about under
E16 107 their cars with the grease-gun, that I append a table showing how a
E16 108 representative collection of cars requires to be greased, from which
E16 109 the disinterested manufacturers who do nothing to relieve servicing
E16 110 tasks stand out like sheep*- black sheep, as black as the unfortunate
E16 111 owners or mechanics who have to grease these cars! ^Incidentally, that
E16 112 the propeller shaft is an anachronism is emphasised by the fact that
E16 113 of only three grease nipples on the Hillman Super Minx and four on the
E16 114 Singer Gazelle, one of the former and two on the latter are on the
E16 115 propeller shaft, while Rover have successfully rid themselves of every
E16 116 nipple save one, again*- on the propeller shaft.*- ^{0W. B.}

E16 120    |^T*2HIS, *0the second of these enjoyable fixtures this year, took
E16 121 place in overcast but dry weather and attracted the usual delightfully
E16 122 varied entry, although few *"new**" old cars appeared.
E16 123    |^The programme commenced with an Inter-Team Relay Race which was
E16 124 contested between 14 one-make teams and a team of Edwardians. ^The
E16 125 race was difficult to follow but in the end jubilation in the Amilcar
E16 126 Six pit indicated that the Tozer, Harding, Lyne team of these fine
E16 127 little supercharged cars had won from the two Frazer Nash teams. ^In
E16 128 spite of modern Weber carburetters, Riseley's 1931 Aston Martin
E16 129 retired. ^The Austin Seven team comprised Nippy, Ulster and Chummy,
E16 130 and there had even been a complete team of three Gwynne Eights and I
E16 131 noticed that between them they numbered a Wolseley gearbox, a stubby
E16 132 right-hand gear-lever and a long central lever, sure sign that
E16 133 standardisation is a word unknown in vintage circles!
E16 134    |^The first 5-lap Handicap was led on the last lap by Brogden's
E16 135 2-seater 3-litre Bentley, Williamson's 2-seater 3-litre of this make
E16 136 also passing Rowe's Ulster Austin that had been out in front for three
E16 137 laps, and was close up on the second Bentley at the finish.
E16 138    |^Another 5-lap Handicap followed, which incorporated the Light Car
E16 139 Handicap. ^The small fry were overtaken by Beavis' rather nondescript
E16 140 1928 Riley Nine after three laps, and Blyth's Austin, with Boyd
E16 141 Carpenter long-tail body, came in second, followed by Smith's Gwynne
E16 142 Eight, leader of the light cars. ^Abrahams' racing Singer Junior went
E16 143 well into fourth place. ^Elsworthy ran a 1930 M-type {0M.G.} Midget
E16 144 in original body trim.
E16 145    |^We now drove to Becketts Corner, where Ronald Barker had arrived
E16 146 in Sedgwick's open Speed Six Bentley, Sedgwick having driven up in the
E16 147 first of the Continental Bentleys dating from 1951, while a Voisin was
E16 148 circulating as temporary Course Car*- *1variety *0which makes these
E16 149 {0*2V.S.C.C.} *0days so enjoyable.
E16 150    |^Faster stuff came out for yet another 5-lap Handicap, Bergel's
E16 151 2.3 Bugatti going very nicely to a popular victory from Michelsen's
E16 152 {0i.f.s.} Frazer Nash *"Patience,**" Edwards' big Lagonda third. ^In
E16 153 spite of a tendency to mis-fire, Gahagan's scratch 2-litre {0E.R.A.}
E16 154 lapped at 72.75 {0m.p.h.}
E16 155    |^A mixed bag from 1908 to 1936 contested the fourth 5-lap Handicap
E16 156 and it was splendid to see Clutton's great 12-litre Itala quite
E16 157 undismayed by front-braked *"moderns,**" so that it came home a
E16 158 thunderous second behind Cook's little Ulster Austin, making fastest
E16 159 lap, into the bargain, at 61.2 {0m.p.h.} ^Third place was secured by
E16 160 Marsh's Austin. ^Poor Liston-Young could get nowhere from scratch in
E16 161 his Fiat Balilla and space helmet, and Zeuner, holding his Brescia
E16 162 Bugatti's gear-lever in gear, was lapped by Cook. ^Kain drove a neat
E16 163 Type 40 Bugatti.
E16 164    |^So to the race which is the purpose of this meeting, the 50-\0km.
E16 165 Boulogne Trophy Scratch Race. ^This was a splendid event. ^Margulies
E16 166 built up a growing lead in his 3-litre Maserati, Hull's 2-litre
E16 167 {0E.R.A.} second, ahead of the \0Hon. Peter Lindsay and Murray in
E16 168 their 1 1/2-litre {0E.R.A.}s.
E16 169    |^As the race settled down Murray's green {0E.R.A.} fell back and
E16 170 Margulies, Hull and Lindsay were out ahead of the {0E.R.A.}s of
E16 171 Waller and Brown. ^Then on lap nine the big Maserati retired, as did
E16 172 Waller, so the order was Hull, Lindsay, Brown, Gahagan and Murray, all
E16 173 in {0E.R.A.}s, followed by Mudd's Maserati which, although
E16 174 mis-firing, was keeping ahead of Husband's blown Talbot, about which
E16 175 Goodhew's {0E.R.A.}-Delage could do nothing at all. ^Cottam's
E16 176 {0E.R.A.} was pursuing this group, followed by McDonald's 4
E16 177 1/2-litre Bentley that eventually took the Vintage Award.
E16 178    |^Lindsay was driving *"Remus**" with real fire and a lap later
E16 179 passed Hull. ^Gahagan, too, was coming round fast in his 2-litre
E16 180 {0E.R.A.}, with occasional glances at his off-side rear wheel, and
E16 181 on lap 13 he was third, having passed Brown. ^Finally, as a fast,

E17   4 *<*5Walker And Pollard {0TV} Heroes*>
E17   5    |^*6BEING *4on {0TV} didn't do the London amateurs much good
E17   6 against South Poland, did it? ^The score was 3-1 in our favour when we
E17   7 came on the air but then it became 3-4, only for heavyweight Billy
E17   8 Walker to level it up. ^This was the only bout to end inside the
E17   9 distance, and once again Billy revealed his potential as one of our
E17  10 best heavyweight bets for the future. ^This was the first
E17  11 representative match to be televised from London this season, and
E17  12 contained all the usual controversies over decisions and refereeing.
E17  13    |^*0In the {0TV} sessions there were two disputed verdicts, and
E17  14 as far as it is possible to judge through this medium Johnny Caiger
E17  15 was a trifle unlucky and Dennis Pollard, in spite of his terrific
E17  16 performance, was beaten by a better man.
E17  17    |^With regard to the refereeing, the Polish official seemed to go
E17  18 out of his way to stop the exchanges on the slightest pretext when the
E17  19 action was getting exciting. ^It must have been most frustrating to
E17  20 the boxers, and of course just as annoying to the spectators. ^Rules
E17  21 are rules, but it is the interpretation that is important. ^A fussy
E17  22 referee can ruin a bout.
E17  23    |^There were southpaws galore in the Polish team. ^We saw three on
E17  24 {0TV} and I understand there were at least two more. ^Their national
E17  25 team is in the process of re-building and the accent is now on youth.
E17  26 *<*5Best Boxer*>
E17  27    |^*0Even so, I thought that Pietrzykowski, veteran of the side, was
E17  28 the best boxer on view in our 60-minute {0TV} session. ^Yet he
E17  29 wasn't included in this year's European Championships.
E17  30    |^Why not? ^Well, Polish coach Felix Stam, referring to the
E17  31 omission of such stars as Pietrzykowski, Adamski, Drogosz and Pazdior
E17  32 in Belgrade, declared*-
E17  33    |^*"They are too old. ^It is no use keeping them in the team just
E17  34 for the chance of winning here. ^We are preparing for 1964 (the
E17  35 Olympic Games), and it is no use starting to build up in 1963.**"
E17  36    |^That's common sense of course, but Pietrzykowski (why wasn't he
E17  37 called *"Smith**") is still boxing well. ^He will be 32 in 1964, but
E17  38 as Archie Moore would say ^*"It's your ability, not your age, that
E17  39 counts.**"
E17  40    |^Poland has had a fine run of successes during the past three
E17  41 years. ^In the 1959 European Championships they had three Gold Medals
E17  42 through the old firm of Drogosz, Adamski and Pietrzykowski. ^Also
E17  43 Silver Medals through Dampe and Walasek, and a Bronze Medal through
E17  44 Jedrzewski.
E17  45    |^In the Olympics of the following year lightweight Pazdior won a
E17  46 Gold Medal; Adamski, Walasek and Pietrzykowski gained Silver Medals;
E17  47 Bendig, Kasprzyk and Drogosz won Bronze Medals.
E17  48    |^So to this year's European Championships, when Poland omitted
E17  49 some of their stars in favour of younger men.
E17  50    |^Yet they didn't do at all badly. ^Walasek won a Gold Medal,
E17  51 Gutman was bantam finalist (he outpointed Johnny Head in a
E17  52 featherweight bout last week) and three boxers reached the
E17  53 semi-finals, Kasprzyk, Jozefowicz and Gugniewicz.
E17  54    |^We must remember that Iron Curtain countries have the advantage
E17  55 of keeping their lads together as *"amateurs**" throughout their
E17  56 careers. ^How can Britain think about building a team for 1964 when
E17  57 the stars invariably turn professional.
E17  58    |^One only has to consider Britain's team in last year's Olympics.
E17  59 ^Those who have since turned pro are flyweight Danny Lee,
E17  60 featherweight Phil Lundgren, light-welter Bobby Kelsey, light-middle
E17  61 Willie Fisher and cruiser Johnny Ould. ^And now comes the news that
E17  62 Frankie Taylor is turning pro shortly.
E17  63    |^Heavyweight Dave Thomas and middle Roy Addison have retired,
E17  64 leaving only Dick McTaggart and Jim Lloyd.
E17  65    |^So it looks like almost a complete new British team for the 1964
E17  66 Games, whereas the Iron Curtain countries will be able to call upon
E17  67 their established stars as usual.
E17  68    |^One of our best men at the moment is Billy Walker, but I'll bet
E17  69 that Billy will be a professional long before then. ^And who can blame
E17  70 him?
E17  71 *<*5Will To Win*>
E17  72    |^*0One of those who looks like going places is cruiserweight
E17  73 Dennis Pollard, who fought like a tiger against Pietrzykowski. ^Dennis
E17  74 has the will to win, and that's exactly what we want in these
E17  75 representative matches. ^He was not bothered by his opponent's
E17  76 reputation*- simply went into the attack, and kept attacking.
E17  77    |^No wonder the crowd rose to Pollard and on that form he would
E17  78 assuredly have beaten anyone less experienced than the triple European
E17  79 champion.
E17  80    |^We shall now look forward to the Great Britain \0v. America
E17  81 match, part of which will be televised by the {0BBC} next Thursday.
E17  82 ^No doubt we shall have the opportunity of seeing Walker and Pollard
E17  83 in action again then.
E17  84    |^Tomorrow's Grandstand bout features Sugar Ray Robinson against
E17  85 Denny Moyer, which Robinson won on points. ^There is absolutely
E17  86 nothing that the average fight fan does not know about Robinson, but
E17  87 here are the statistical details in his chequered career.
E17  88    |^*6SUGAR RAY ROBINSON. ^*0Born Detroit May 3, 1920.
E17  89    |^Turned pro in 1940, gaining 40 straight wins before losing to

E17  91    |^Signed to meet Marty Servo for the World's welter crown on August
E17  92 10, 1946, but the bout was twice postponed and eventually Servo
E17  93 retired.
E17  94    |^Robinson was then matched with Tommy Bell, and won on points on
E17  95 December 20, 1946.
E17  96    |^On February 14, 1951, Robinson kayoed Jake LaMotta to win the
E17  97 world's middleweight crown, and gave up his welter title.
E17  98    |^Ray lost the middleweight championship to Randolph Turpin in
E17  99 1951, regained it the same year.
E17 100    |^In 1952 he was kayoed by Joey Maxim in a world's cruiserweight
E17 101 title bout, and announced his retirement from the ring in December of
E17 102 that year.

E17 151 *<*6BROWN KEEPS TITLE*>
E17 152 *<*4Champion Floors Somodio Twice To Take Unanimous Verdict*>
E17 153    |^*6JOE BROWN, *435-year-old American holder of the World's
E17 154 lightweight crown, kept his title at Quezon City, Manila, last
E17 155 Saturday, with an easy points verdict over 15 rounds against Filipino
E17 156 Bert Somodio. ^Brown floored his man twice, for a no-count in the
E17 157 fifth and for *"nine**" in the eleventh. ^It was a unanimous decision.
E17 158 ^This was Brown's tenth successful title defence.
E17 159    |^*0A capacity crowd of around 30,000 in the Areneta Coliseum gave
E17 160 their local favourite Somodio plenty of vocal support, but although he
E17 161 started well and put in a good finish there could be no doubt of
E17 162 Brown's superiority.
E17 163    |^There was very little positive action in the first four rounds,
E17 164 with Brown content to let his opponent force the pace. ^In the fourth,
E17 165 particularly, Somodio scored with hard rights to the mid-section.
E17 166    |^Then the champ decided that he had learned enough about his man
E17 167 to take the offensive, and opened up with a series of two-handed
E17 168 attacks, culminating in a right to the jaw that put Somodio down on
E17 169 one knee.
E17 170    |^The 27-year-old Filipino got up immediately but was obviously
E17 171 shaken. ^Then in the seventh Brown again shook his man with a right
E17 172 cross and opened up a cut on his opponent's left eye.
E17 173    |^Brown kept on top with clever boxing and ringcraft, and in the
E17 174 eleventh caught Somodio with a right-left to the paw that put him down
E17 175 again.
E17 176    |^This had its effect on the Filipino, who slowed considerably in
E17 177 the next two or three rounds. ^Brown used his full repertoire of
E17 178 punches, jabbing and uppercutting to good effect, and was well on top
E17 179 now.
E17 180    |^Somodio went down slowly in a sort of delayed-action fall, taking
E17 181 several backward steps before going to the canvas near the ropes. ^But
E17 182 somehow he struggled up at *"nine,**" although all the fight had been
E17 183 taken out of him now.
E17 184    |^The Filipino tried hard to put in a storming finish, but his
E17 185 attacks were nearly all neatly countered by the clever champion.
E17 186    |^Both men received a fine ovation from an enthusiastic crowd.
E17 187    |^Brown has held his crown since August 1956, when he outpointed
E17 188 Wallace *"Bud**" Smith. ^But he still seem **[SIC**] reluctant to meet
E17 189 Carlos Ortiz, one-time winner over Dave Charnley, and like the latter,
E17 190 a leading contender for Joe's title.
E17 191 *<*4Big Chance For Wemhoener*>
E17 192    |^*6NO *4shortage of work in Germany, writes *6GERRY MANN.
E17 193 ^*4Tonight there are top shows at Munich and Hamburg. ^At the former
E17 194 venue two near-veterans in Dieter Wemhoener and Helmut Bull battle it
E17 195 out for the vacant German cruiser crown. ^At the latter Karl *"The
E17 196 Great**" Mildenberger tackles American Wayne Bethea. ^Then on November
E17 197 11 comes the Erich Schoeppner \0v. Hans Kalbfell clash for the
E17 198 former's German heavyweight title, and in Frankfurt on November 24
E17 199 Mildenberger is likely to top the bill.
E17 200    |^*0Wemhoener has always boxed in the shadow of his more famous
E17 201 stablemate Gustav Scholz, and at the age of 31 must have been thinking
E17 202 that his big chance had gone by. ^But the vacating of the cruiser
E17 203 crown by Erich Schoeppner has left the door open for Wemhoener or his
E17 204 30-year-old opponent Helmut Ball to annex the national title.
E17 205    |^Two years ago Wemhoener went to Milan and outpointed Italian
E17 206 cruiser Giulio Rinaldi on his own doorstep. ^Rinaldi went on to fight
E17 207 for the World's title.
E17 208    |^Why manager Fritz Gretzschel didn't cash in on this victory and
E17 209 challenge Schoeppner right then must remain a mystery. ^Instead Dieter
E17 210 went on his victorious way against Continental opposition, slipping
E17 211 only twice*- when he was kayoed by Lennart Risberg in Stockholm last
E17 212 November and this year when he was held to a draw by Frenchman Diouf.
E17 213    |^Helmut Ball, with American experience, got a shot at Schoeppner
E17 214 instead and was narrowly outpointed. ^He cannot match Wemhoener for
E17 215 skill, but punches hard enough to put away any cruiser in Europe.
E17 216    |^This fight looks like being the survival of the fittest, but
E17 217 we'll go along with Wemhoener on account of his superior skill.
E17 218    |^In the main support heavyweight Ulli Nitzschke tackles American
E17 219 Frankie Daniels in a return (Daniels won last time on points) and
E17 220 lightweight champion Conny Rudhof opposes Zykaris Taki.

E18   5    |^*4N*2EXT *0year we shall see another America's Cup contest. ^This
E18   6 time it will be Australia who will be making her first challenge.
E18   7 ^There were strong rumours that the Americans would not build a new
E18   8 defender and that they would rely upon Stephen's designed *1Columbia,
E18   9 *0perhaps improved, and *1Easterner *0which has been much improved and
E18  10 has had twelve hundred pounds taken out of her in the form of cabin
E18  11 fittings and needless furniture. ^This has allowed about six hundred
E18  12 pounds of lead to be added to her keel.
E18  13    |^Now I hear that *1Easterner's *0designer Ray Hunt has been
E18  14 commissioned to design a new potential defender. ^She will be built at
E18  15 Graves Yard in Marblehead, \0Mass., next door to Ted Hood's sail loft.
E18  16 ^The combination is a good one and the new boat will be much fancied.
E18  17    |^My American informant remarks that the trials next summer will be
E18  18 better than the actual races for the cup and this was true of the last
E18  19 challenge. ^He ends up by saying:
E18  20    |^*"Unless the Aussies have shaved the rules so closely that they
E18  21 squeak I think we might win again.**"
E18  22    |^I hear that the Red Duster Syndicate has ordered a 12-metre to
E18  23 Arthur Robb's design from Groves & Guttridge of Cowes. ^It will be a
E18  24 new venture on the part of this firm to build a twelve. ^No
E18  25 information has been published as to the result of the extensive tests
E18  26 made for this syndicate in the Saunders Roe tank. ^They have been
E18  27 going on for a long time and much money has been spent.
E18  28    |^From what I can discover the general conclusion, after much
E18  29 experimenting in tanks, is that it is difficult to improve much upon
E18  30 the performance of hulls.
E18  31    |^It is, I think, generally accepted that there is still a
E18  32 considerable margin for a breakthrough in the motive power*- sails.
E18  33 ^As I said last month, no one would dream of using cotton sails for
E18  34 racing to-day and there is still probably room for improvement upon
E18  35 Terylene rather by processing it or by using some form of sheer
E18  36 plastic.
E18  37    |^Perhaps one answer may be the Ratsey *"Venturi**" spinnaker. ^The
E18  38 vents are claimed to direct a strong downward thrust of air just
E18  39 forward of the sail giving the spinnaker increased lift and driving
E18  40 power. ^The idea is based on experience with aeronautical parachutes
E18  41 and will be shown by Ratsey and Lapthorn \0Inc. at the 1962 National
E18  42 Motorboat Show in New York.
E18  43    |^The Australian challenger designed by Alan Payne is making good
E18  44 progress at Lars Halvorsen and Sons' yard on the Parramatta River at
E18  45 Ryde, Sydney. ^She is expected to be in commission in December and her
E18  46 first job will be trials against *1Vim. ^*0The Australians have
E18  47 realistically decided that unless she can beat *1Vim *0there is no use
E18  48 sending her to the States.
E18  49    |^Allowing for a period of tuning they should know the ability of
E18  50 their new unnamed 12 by February. ^She will probably leave Sydney
E18  51 during May, 1962, as deck cargo and she has to be at the starting line
E18  52 off Newport, Rhode Island, on September 15. ^*1Vim *0will return to
E18  53 the States in the same way at about the same time. ^The challenger
E18  54 will have a light alloy mast built from American components. ^Her
E18  55 sails will be made in Sydney from imported synthetic sailcloth by
E18  56 Peter Cole and Joe Pearce. ^The materials for them will probably also
E18  57 come from America.
E18  58    |^Two eleven-man teams have been trained in *1Vim *0but they have
E18  59 lacked the stimulus of competition and it occurs to me that it would
E18  60 have been a nice gesture to have shipped *1Sceptre *0to Australia at
E18  61 the close of her successful season.
E18  62    |^*1Sceptre's *0recent successes have led some people to make
E18  63 adverse comments about her crew in the America's Cup races but it must
E18  64 be remembered that in *1Evaine *0she only had a trial horse and not a
E18  65 contender for the challenge while the Americans enjoyed the fiercest
E18  66 competition in their trials to select their defender. ^Her arrival in
E18  67 Sydney in the autumn, or shall we say Sydney's spring, would have put
E18  68 new life into the training of the two crews.
E18  69    |^The Australian syndicate led by Sir Frank Packer are reputed to
E18  70 be spending *+250,000 on their Cup bid. ^Let us hope that Alan Payne,
E18  71 the builders, sailmakers and crew can pull something out of the bag,
E18  72 for in many ways the dice are inevitably loaded against them.

E18  78 conference opened on Monday, October 30, and ended on Friday, November

E18  80 three years and which is attended by representatives from all member
E18  81 nations. ^In fact 27 delegates took their seats, some of whom
E18  82 represented more than one country and these delegates were assisted by
E18  83 their advisers. ^When one considers that the permanent committee and
E18  84 all the sub-committees are similarly helped by advisers one gets some
E18  85 idea of the formidable body of international yachtsmen who descend

E18  89 affairs can be conducted in harmony. ^Yachtsmen, it seems, even if
E18  90 they do not agree, can disagree gracefully and I think that much of
E18  91 the success of these annual meetings is due to the tactful and
E18  92 impartial chairmanship of Peter Scott, the President, backed by Harry

E18  98 realization that each knows his job, and each may well have his
E18  99 idiosyncrasies. ^While there is continual change and a few new faces
E18 100 every year, they become absorbed into the main body of the Union and
E18 101 known by their Christian names, and there are a few **[SIC**], for
E18 102 instance, who would dream of addressing the Count of Caria as anything

E18 104    |^As usual, delegates were entertained to dinner by the Royal
E18 105 Yachting Association and a very pleasant affair it was, if a little
E18 106 cramped in its temporary quarters. ^There was the usual cocktail party
E18 107 at the Royal Ocean Racing Club, and Group Captain Haylock's theatre
E18 108 party which includes the wives. ^It seems that the latter come over
E18 109 mainly for the purpose of going to our theatres in the evenings and
E18 110 indulging in the most glorious shopping spree imaginable by day,
E18 111 sometimes admirably helped by their daughters.

E18 113    |^*6A*2T *0a recent meeting, the Planning Committee of the
E18 114 Hampshire County Council approved, with certain safeguards, the
E18 115 building of a conventional power station by the Central Electricity
E18 116 Generating Board at Fawley between the Fawley Oil Refinery and
E18 117 Calshot.
E18 118    |^The power station will be three times the size of that at
E18 119 Marchwood, at the head of Southampton Water. ^It is thus fairly
E18 120 certain that with its 600\0ft chimney it will be visible from all
E18 121 parts of the Solent. ^Unlike an oil refinery one cannot grumble much
E18 122 about the fumes, smell and industrial dirt, generally, for little
E18 123 comes out of the chimney except possibly invisible gasses. **[SIC**]
E18 124 ^Cooling water in vast quantities will be discharged into Southampton
E18 125 Water but except for being warmed it will be unchanged.
E18 126    |^What we can and do object to, however carefully *"landscaped**"
E18 127 and however beautifully designed this power station may be, is the
E18 128 fact that we shall be able to see it from all parts of the Solent.
E18 129 ^This may seem a slight objection but it is a valid one. ^It is
E18 130 necessary to man, and an amenity, to be able to look at unspoilt
E18 131 nature and this, to a large extent, he can still do on the Solent
E18 132 although it is fortuitous and cannot be attributed to anything except
E18 133 lack of development before 1945.
E18 134    |^We have sacrificed part of this precious amenity already for we
E18 135 can see the flames and chimneys of Fawley over the trees of the New
E18 136 Forest practically anywhere in the West Solent. ^They are, however,
E18 137 not particularly obtrusive, but there will be no hiding a great,
E18 138 gloomy power station. ^It will brood over the Solent.
E18 139    |^It is particularly important that when you have only one little
E18 140 stretch of sheltered water that is a recreational area for literally
E18 141 millions of people that it should not be brooded over by anything,
E18 142 whatever it is. ^I will freely admit that the old Calshot air station
E18 143 is no thing of beauty, it is a pity it ever happened, but the
E18 144 buildings are not particularly large and as one proceeds west down the
E18 145 Solent it is soon unnoticeable. ^Not so this great power station. ^We
E18 146 shall probably be able to see it from beyond the Needles, certainly
E18 147 the chimney will be visible for miles further down the Channel.
E18 148    |^People have argued that *1one *0does not matter: this is the
E18 149 last: there is still a lot left: that we should get used to it. ^We
E18 150 don't agree with any of these comforting thoughts. ^With the power
E18 151 station established, greedy hands will be stretched out for something
E18 152 more, and if we do not jealously guard every inch of the Solent we
E18 153 shall have power stations, oil refineries, factories and industry
E18 154 leapfrogging down the banks until, what shall we have left? ^An
E18 155 industrial drain like the London river. ^Who wants to go sailing on
E18 156 dirty water? ^Yes, the water will be dirty all right.
E18 157    |^These are some of the things which we should ponder over, but not
E18 158 waste too much time thinking about. ^While I sympathize with the
E18 159 Central Electricity Generating Board, for nobody wants either their
E18 160 power stations or their pylons, yachtsmen of today have a duty to
E18 161 those of future generations.
E18 162    |
E18 163    |^*6F*2OR *0some time I have been drawing attention to the need for
E18 164 the Royal Yachting Association to take under its wing marine motoring.
E18 165 ^I now hear that Donald Campbell and Major John Abraham, Commodore of
E18 166 the Royal Motor Yacht Club, have registered the British Power Boat
E18 167 Association after considerable preparatory work. ^Since then
E18 168 discussions have taken place between Major Abraham and members of the
E18 169 General Purposes Committee of the Royal Yachting Association and there
E18 170 is every hope that motor yachting and motorboat racing and even
E18 171 waterski-ing will eventually be brought under the {0R.Y.A.} umbrella.
E18 172    |^On November 13 Major Abraham called a meeting of interested
E18 173 parties on the motor side, but certain of the motorboat racing
E18 174 fraternity felt that they might be swallowed lock, stock and barrel by
E18 175 a powerful and established {0R.Y.A.} ^I can assure them that their
E18 176 fears are groundless. ^They will be on the same footing as dinghy
E18 177 racing or for that matter any other branch of the sport.
E18 178    |^A Steering Committee of the motorboat side has been formed to
E18 179 undertake further discussions with the Royal Yachting Association and
E18 180 let us hope that before the new season opens we shall see the sport of
E18 181 motorboating in all its branches firmly ensconced in the Royal
E18 182 Yachting Association organization, members, as it were, of the
E18 183 Commonwealth of Yachting.
E18 184    |
E18 185    |^*6W*2ITHOUT *0doubt a situation has now been reached on the South
E18 186 Coast where, unless something is done soon, yachting and yachtbuilding
E18 187 will be severely restricted because there will be nowhere to keep the
E18 188 yachts, and orders are, in many instances, either being cancelled or
E18 189 conditional upon a mooring being available. ^In Dartmouth a Marina has
E18 190 already been opened and, this, in a part of the world where the
E18 191 congestion was nothing like that around the Solent.
E18 192    |^It seems to be going well and this may encourage others to push
E18 193 on with their plans in a number of places such as Poole, Bournemouth,
E18 194 Lymington, Hamble and Portsmouth on the Solent, two places on
E18 195 Chichester Harbour and in Newhaven and Swanage.

E19   2 *<*6WINES *4to meet a stranger*>
E19   3    |^*0To choose wines or cordials for food ranging from Moussaka to
E19   4 Mangoes and Artichokes to Uglies poses something of a problem. ^On the
E19   5 other hand, the dishes built upon these unusual fruits and vegetables
E19   6 have a common characteristic. ^The main course dishes are strongly
E19   7 flavoured and the fruits have a pleasant astringency behind their
E19   8 sweetness. ^This means that one should avoid choosing wines that are
E19   9 very dry or of delicate flavour. ^Sparkling wines do not really fit
E19  10 into this picture, but strong, virile wines do. ^A full-bodied wine
E19  11 for the main course, and a sweet wine for the fruits would be a good
E19  12 general rule.
E19  13    |^One would do well to consider the wines of Greece to match the
E19  14 moussaka. ^The special one, of course, is Retsina, a white wine
E19  15 matured in resinated casks. ^I came to love it from drinking it in the
E19  16 war years, but the fact must be faced, it is an acquired taste. ^My
E19  17 wife contends that it tastes of ping-pong balls. ^It might be a good
E19  18 thing to have a bottle or two for the initiated, and stick to a white
E19  19 dry Samos for the majority. ^The price of both is about 8\0s. 6\0d. to
E19  20 9\0s. per bottle. ^They should be served cold but not over-chilled.
E19  21    |^A good red alternative comes from Hungary*- Egri Bikaver*- the
E19  22 dark wine from Eger known as Bull's Blood. ^It costs about 10\0s.
E19  23 6\0d. per bottle. ^If you want something really strong, with a high
E19  24 alcoholic content, Yugoslavia produces Dinjac, but it is not a wine
E19  25 for weak heads! ^It costs about 8\0s. 9\0d. per bottle.
E19  26    |^There are also Spanish and Portuguese wines that go well with
E19  27 strongly flavoured foods. ^The robust Spanish Chablis, the Rioja
E19  28 Burgundy, and the Portuguese Vila Real Tinto are examples, all costing
E19  29 about 7\0s. 6\0d. per bottle. ^Russian wines are now on the market,
E19  30 and the red Mukuzani \0No. 4 would fit this menu well. ^It costs about
E19  31 the same as the Spanish wines.
E19  32    |^Now for the wines to go with the fruit dishes. ^For those who
E19  33 like a really sweet wine there is what is often called the Sauterne of
E19  34 the Perigord: Monbazillac, costing from 8\0s. to 10\0s. per bottle.
E19  35 ^Visitors to Vienna will perhaps remember the ancient cellars at
E19  36 Gumpoldskirchner*- the home of the fine Rotgipfler Auslese. ^This
E19  37 costs about 15\0s. 6\0d. per bottle. ^Or to return to Greece, there is
E19  38 the famous Mavrodaphne*- the Italians drink a lot of it, and you may
E19  39 have met it in Vienna.
E19  40    |^An alternative is to leave the *"straight**" wines out of the
E19  41 planning and go for some kind of a cup. ^Pride of Oporto is a pleasant
E19  42 and simple one. ^To produce about thirty glasses take one bottle of
E19  43 tawny port, half a gill of Orange Curac*?6ao, one lemon, and a siphon
E19  44 of soda. ^Squeeze the juice of the lemon into a bowl, adding the port
E19  45 and Curac*?6ao, then slicing the lemon into it. ^Let it stand for
E19  46 about 20 minutes and then serve the glasses about two-thirds full of
E19  47 the mixture, topping up with iced soda water.
E19  48    |^It is always a good thing to have a jug of non-alcoholic cup
E19  49 about the place. ^A simple and pleasant one can be made by mixing
E19  50 lemon and orange cordial in the ratio of two of lemon to one of
E19  51 orange. ^Before adding water, a slice of lemon and orange and a lump
E19  52 or two of ice, put in a couple of teaspoonfuls of *"Ribena.**" ^The
E19  53 colour combination is delightful and it enhances the flavour.
E19  54    |^Finally, there is the ape*?2ritif, if one is needed. ^If you want
E19  55 to give your friends something out of the ordinary, costing less than
E19  56 20\0s. per bottle, there is Pineau Imperial \des Charentes, from the
E19  57 Cognac region. ^Alternatively, there is the more expensive*- about
E19  58 40\0s. per bottle*- plum brandy from Yugoslavia and Hungary*-
E19  59 Slivovitz. ^Even quite a small glass makes a party go. ^And if there
E19  60 is any left it is equally good as a liqueur. ^If by any chance you
E19  61 have difficulty in finding the drinks I have mentioned, write to
E19  62 Woman's Journal who will tell you where they may be bought.
E19  63    |^*2JOHN BAKER WHITE
E19  64 *<*4Wines worth singing for*>
E19  65    |^T*2HERE *0has never been a time when wines from so many different
E19  66 countries were available in Britain. ^This means that there is a
E19  67 tremendous field for experiment, and having a lot of fun without
E19  68 spending too much. ^So, in choosing wines for the four suppers, I have
E19  69 tried to be original and, except for the Supper Party wines,
E19  70 inexpensive, despite recent increases in price.
E19  71    |^*5Supper Party. ^*0Here perhaps one can spread one's wings a
E19  72 little and forget the family budget. ^As an ape*?2ritif serve,
E19  73 chilled, a wonderful wine that comes from the Jura*- namely the 1949
E19  74 Cha*?5teau-Chalon. ^It is the rarest wine in France, and is matured
E19  75 for seven years before bottling. ^A bottle will cost you about 35\0s.
E19  76 but it will be a wonderful experience for your guests.
E19  77    |^With the food I think a Portuguese Mateus Rose*?2, the pale pink
E19  78 wine with natural sparkle, would be fun. ^It must, of course, be
E19  79 chilled, and costs about 13\0s. to 14\0s. a flask. ^A very pleasant
E19  80 alternative would be a Franconian Steinwein, also in flasks known as
E19  81 Boxbeutels, and costing about 17\0s. 6\0d. ^It is a fairly safe bet
E19  82 that one of the guests will want to take the empty flask home; they
E19  83 make delightful lamp bases. ^If you feel that the Cha*?5teau-Chalon is
E19  84 beyond your pocket you could cut out the ape*?2ritif and serve a glass
E19  85 of light non-vintage port with the Boston Cream Pie; or perhaps even
E19  86 better, an inexpensive dessert wine from Cyprus called Commandaria.
E19  87 ^It has been made since the crusades.
E19  88    |^*5Family Sit-Down Supper. ^*0The mackerel is a splendid fish that
E19  89 deserves good treatment, and I would be inclined to accentuate the
E19  90 Italian accent of the main course, serving before dinner an Italian
E19  91 ape*?2ritif that has only just come on to the British market. ^Its
E19  92 name is Riccadonna Bitter Vermouth, a blend of herbs with fortified
E19  93 wines from Canelli. ^The bottle should be iced and a twist of lemon
E19  94 put in each glass.
E19  95    |^We do not drink as much Italian white wine as we might in
E19  96 Britain, so I would choose a Soave Di Verona, or if you have
E19  97 difficulty in finding it, the sweeter Orvieto. ^Both should cost under
E19  98 10\0s. per bottle. ^With the hot souffle*?2 a glass of that fine but
E19  99 neglected wine Marsala would go admirably. ^When I was young the Royal
E19 100 Navy used to drink it before lunch instead of gin but nowadays most
E19 101 people relegate it to the kitchen, which is a pity. ^I would choose a
E19 102 medium-rich wine like Corona, costing about 12\0s. per bottle. ^If you
E19 103 can find a Malaga, then try that.
E19 104    |^*5Supper Round The Fire. ^*0Quite a few people hold to the view
E19 105 that it is a waste of wine to drink it with curry. ^I do not agree,
E19 106 but obviously as curry is made from spices the wine must be
E19 107 full-blooded to *"live**" with it. ^This meal has a big fruit content,
E19 108 so one must look also for a fruity wine. ^Before supper a glass of
E19 109 Madeira would go well, especially if it is a Verdelho or an Old Rich
E19 110 Bual.
E19 111    |^And with the meal itself? ^I have mentioned the red wines of
E19 112 Chile before, and I do so again, because I think the Santa Rita or
E19 113 Cabernet would match this food. ^A good alternative would be one of
E19 114 the Australian Burgundies, which are sound and dependable: after all
E19 115 the Australians have been making wine for over a hundred years and
E19 116 send vine specialists all over the world. ^None of these wines should
E19 117 cost much over 8\0s. per bottle, but don't roast them in front of the
E19 118 fire. ^Let them *"breathe**" for a few hours in the room, taking up
E19 119 its temperature.
E19 120    |^*5After-Theatre Supper. ^*0It is a mistake to drink too heavy a
E19 121 wine before going to bed, and anyway the composition of this meal
E19 122 demands both lightness and flavour. ^A light, young Beaujolais would
E19 123 go well, all the better if it was chilled. ^In this country we raise
E19 124 our hands in horror at the thought of chilling red wine, but with some
E19 125 it is both justifiable and desirable. ^A good alternative would be a
E19 126 white Alsatian, such as the Sylvaner costing about 10\0s. or the drier
E19 127 Riesling, which is a bit dearer. ^Another alternative would be a South
E19 128 African medium dry white Paarl Amber, costing about 8\0s. ^The Cape
E19 129 has been producing wine for a long, long time and this *"hock**" is
E19 130 good value, and will not be heavy. ^If you want a *"warmer**" at the
E19 131 end of the meal, what about a glass of Cherry Brandy?
E19 132    |^*4John Baker White
E19 133 *<*6WINES *4with Star Attraction*>
E19 134    |^N*2OVEMBER *0is the first month of real Winter, liable to give us
E19 135 a sharp nip as a reminder of what lies ahead. ^As it can produce
E19 136 gales, icy winds, frozen roads, and fog we should choose our drinks on
E19 137 the principle of *"something to keep the cold out.**" ^As a Winter
E19 138 surprise let me suggest an original cocktail. ^Into a champagne glass
E19 139 put a lump of sugar, an eggspoonful of brandy, and on the sugar
E19 140 literally one drop of angostura bitters. ^Fill up with an iced
E19 141 sparkling white wine from Australia. ^Gramp's Barossa Dry Pearl,
E19 142 costing about 15\0s. per bottle, or Rose Pearl, at the same price, do
E19 143 the job jolly well. ^When you *"top-up**" there is no need to put in
E19 144 any more sugar or brandy.
E19 145    |^Before I consider the other dishes I must come on to the Crown of
E19 146 Lamb, for it is a splendid dish deserving a splendid wine. ^Recently
E19 147 in our own house we gave it to an internationally famous restaurateur,
E19 148 and served it with a 1949 Mouton Cadet. ^This is pretty hard to come
E19 149 by so look for a 1955 Cha*?5teau Beychevelle. ^This will cost about
E19 150 17\0s. 6\0d. per bottle. ^If you prefer a Burgundy try a 1955 Charmes
E19 151 Chambertin costing round about *+1.
E19 152    |^The Roast Turkey, too, demands special attention, and as it has
E19 153 walnut stuffing a richly flavoured wine would be my choice. ^The 1955
E19 154 Louis Jadot Chevalier Montrachet *"Les Demoiselles**" is an excellent
E19 155 White Burgundy, and worth all of the 30\0s. you may have to pay for
E19 156 it. ^If this looks like putting your party budget out of gear,
E19 157 Bouchard Pe*?3re \et Fils 1955 Puligny-Montracet is a fine wine,
E19 158 costing a little over *+1 per bottle. ^For the Caneton \aux Cerises,
E19 159 some experts might quarrel with my choice, a Cristal Dry Sparkling
E19 160 White Burgundy, costing about 16\0s. 6\0d. per bottle. ^That great
E19 161 judge of wines, the late Professor Saintsbury, always had high praise
E19 162 for this wine. ^Should you be averse to sparkling wines I have washed
E19 163 down many a plump duckling from the meadows of the Loire with a
E19 164 Muscadet, costing about 12\0s., or a Puilly Blanc-Fume*?2, costing
E19 165 perhaps 16\0s. 6\0d. ^These wines would, in my opinion, go well with
E19 166 the Poulet as well.
E19 167    |^Bacon with brandied peaches seems to demand one of the vintage
E19 168 ciders rather than a wine. ^The one I know best is the Church Farm
E19 169 cider from Smarden in Kent, costing 6\0s. 6\0d. per bottle. ^I have
E19 170 also enjoyed Bulmers Strongbow, Old Vathouse, which is not so strong
E19 171 and consequently cheaper. ^It is worth remembering that vintage
E19 172 ciders*- Merrydown from Horam is another of them*- are stronger than
E19 173 many wines.
E19 174    |^And a dessert wine to go with the sweets? ^If you want to have a
E19 175 bit of fun, follow Commander Anthony Hogg's advice. ^Decant a bottle
E19 176 of Barone Ricasoli's 1953 estate-bottled Vin Santo Brolio, and ask
E19 177 your wine-conscious guests to tell you where it comes from. ^It will
E19 178 cost you about 17\0s. a bottle.
E19 179    |^If the night is cold you may feel like giving your guests a hot
E19 180 Punch. ^With me The Bishop remains a firm favourite. ^For 20 people
E19 181 you need:
E19 182    |*42 lemons and cloves
E19 183    |1 quart of Australian Gramp's Orlando Ruby dessert wine, costing

E20  63 him.
E20  64    |^On Christmas Day, allow 15 \0mins. to the pound, so that a
E20  65 10-\0lb. bird will take 2 1/2 \0hrs. ^A 16-\0lb. bird will probably be
E20  66 ready in about 3 1/2 \0hrs. rather than his full 4 \0hrs., and should
E20  67 be tested with a skewer after this time. ^Preheat the oven to \0Elec.,
E20  68 300*@ \0F.; Gas, Mark 5; Solid Fuel, Moderate, and keep it at these
E20  69 low temperatures until 3/4 \0hr. before the bird should be done,
E20  70 basting every 30 \0mins., and using more fat if necessary. ^Then, 3/4
E20  71 \0hr. before serving, turn the oven up to \0Elec., 450*@ \0F.; Gas,
E20  72 Mark 7; Solid Fuel, Hot*- remove paper and bacon rashers, baste well
E20  73 and allow the breast to brown to a rich mahogany. ^Some people prefer
E20  74 to turn the bird right over and finish breast downwards to prevent
E20  75 drying, but this is difficult with a large bird, and should not be
E20  76 necessary if he is properly basted.
E20  77    |^Sausages and Bread Sauce may be served with the turkey.
E20  78 ^Cranberry Sauce is also excellent.
E20  79    |^The traditional vegetables are brussels sprouts and celery and
E20  80 roast potatoes, but with frozen vegetables a much greater choice is
E20  81 open. ^If there is no room round the turkey for roast potatoes and not
E20  82 enough space in the oven to cook them in a separate tray, well-creamed
E20  83 potatoes with plenty of butter and milk are very good.
E20  84    |^Tinned or fresh stewed cranberries served in half lemon skins,
E20  85 one for each person, are unusual and delicious.

E21   3 *<A HOLIDAY ON ANCIENT RHODES*>
E21   4 *<*4By *6GORDON COOPER*>
E21   5    |^*0Rhodes, as far as I am concerned, is the perfect holiday
E21   6 island: it has wonderful beaches and scenery, lush vegetation, a
E21   7 number of archaeological and historic remains and good hotels. ^It is
E21   8 full of that usually rather overvaunted quality *"character.**"
E21   9    |^Recently, I flew out by {0B.E.A.} Comet 4B, now operating on a
E21  10 direct London-Athens service via Geneva. ^This route over the Alps,
E21  11 Florence, Brindisi, the Adriatic, Corfu and the Gulf of Corinth is
E21  12 rich in its rewards, and the service was, as usual, impeccable on this
E21  13 swift, smooth airliner. ^The tourist return fare is *+100 16\0s.
E21  14 (day), *+84 12\0s. (night), and the five-hour day flight links up at
E21  15 Athens with an Olympic Airways' schedule, taking just over an hour to
E21  16 Rhodes (through fare from London, *+94 10\0s. to *+108). ^An
E21  17 alternative route is by sea from Piraeus, taking twenty-two hours.
E21  18    |^The approach to Rhodes by day is perfect. ^It is, according to
E21  19 legend, the island which rose in beauty from the foam, promised to
E21  20 Apollo by Zeus after he had divided the world amongst the gods, and
E21  21 overlooked the sun lord. ^Apollo named the island *"Bride of the
E21  22 Sun.**" ^Certainly the sun has blessed it. ^The seven springs, which
E21  23 feed Rhodes from the central mountains, have made it a garden of
E21  24 olive, lemon and orange groves, mulberry, oleander, pine and the slim
E21  25 pure cypress. ^Hibiscus and wistaria glow against white walls; the
E21  26 grassland is carpeted with wild flowers of every description and
E21  27 poppies drip blood red where Rhodians once met by ancient temple or
E21  28 market place.
E21  29    |
E21  30    |^After the original settlers came the Phoenicians, followed at
E21  31 varying intervals and amongst others by the Dorians, the Romans, the
E21  32 Byzantines, the Crusaders, the Turks, and the Italians. ^Rhodes,
E21  33 capital of the Dodecanese, was finally reunited with Greece fourteen
E21  34 years ago, but the marks of 3,500 years of passing civilisations
E21  35 remain to enchant the visitor.
E21  36    |^The city of Rhodes itself is a gem. ^Huge medieval ramparts rise
E21  37 from the edge of one of her two harbours to enclose the old town,
E21  38 including the Castello, the magnificent palace of the Grand Masters of
E21  39 the Knights of \0St. John*- later the Knights of Malta*- who ruled the
E21  40 island for 216 years. ^Here, for the first time, {*1Son et
E21  41 Lumie*?3re} *0performances are being held this year. ^The Street of
E21  42 the Knights, rising steeply up to the Castello, is a medieval painting
E21  43 brought to life. ^Nearby, the Museum of Rhodes is housed in a lovely
E21  44 fifteenth-century building. ^You should walk round the ramparts of the
E21  45 old city, too, with superb views at each turn, and allow time to
E21  46 wander in the old commercial quarter, with its oriental influence, its
E21  47 minarets and clutter of wares, and the buzz of activity which
E21  48 increases proportionately as the day ends.
E21  49    |^Outside the ramparts the spacious modern city, largely in
E21  50 Venetian-Gothic style, owes much to Italian occupation. ^Above Rhodes,
E21  51 with glorious views in every direction, you should visit the
E21  52 Acropolis, with remains of the Temple of Apollo and the stadium and
E21  53 the completely restored theatre at its feet.
E21  54    |^Though Rhodes was founded in 408 {0B.C.}, three other cities
E21  55 had been thriving already 1,000 years, reaching their peak from 660
E21  56 {0B.C.} ^Of these, Lindos, about 35 miles south of Rhodes, was the
E21  57 most important, with a population of some 100,000. ^To-day, it is a
E21  58 stark white village of 750 inhabitants, clustered at the southern end
E21  59 of a beautiful bay and overlooked by the medieval fortress built by
E21  60 the Knights of \0St. John, in turn enclosing the remains of the Doric
E21  61 temple of Athena Lindia, on the Acropolis. ^This is reached on foot or
E21  62 by donkey, and from the top there are breath-taking views over this
E21  63 dramatic coastline, including the tiny natural harbour where \0St.
E21  64 Paul is said to have landed. ^The village itself is fascinating to
E21  65 explore and has an early Byzantine church, its interior lavishly
E21  66 covered with later frescoes.
E21  67    |^On the opposite coast, about 20 miles south-west of Rhodes, the
E21  68 reconstructed ruins of Kamiros have one of the most perfect situations
E21  69 of any archaeological remains I know. ^Here, on a steep hillside,
E21  70 amongst pines and clumps of wild rose, you can walk up the *"main
E21  71 street**" of ancient Kamiros between the low ruins of shops and villas
E21  72 to the high plateau topped by six columns, all that remain of the
E21  73 ancient Stoa. ^Behind you, the coastal hills plunge to the incredibly
E21  74 blue sea, backed by the Turkish mountains.
E21  75    |
E21  76    |^Of the third ancient city, Ialyssos, about 10 miles south-west of
E21  77 Rhodes, little that is visible remains. ^But its former Acropolis,
E21  78 800-\0ft. Mount Philerimos, whose summit is reached by an Alpine-like
E21  79 series of hairpin bends, is topped by the restored medieval church
E21  80 built, partially over Byzantine remains, by the Knights of \0St. John.
E21  81 ^Before the church entrance are the ruins of the Temple of Athena.
E21  82 ^Once again the views on all sides, framed between cypress trees, are
E21  83 lovely beyond description.
E21  84    |^Then there is the Valley of the Butterflies, about 15 miles south
E21  85 of Rhodes, so-called because of the clouds of butterflies which
E21  86 populate its wild scenery during the summer. ^Organised excursions are
E21  87 arranged to all these centres, or if you prefer to wander alone, you
E21  88 can hire a car, motor scooter or use local bus services. ^A weekly
E21  89 steamer service will also take you over to Turkey, returning the same
E21  90 day.
E21  91    |^Rhodes itself offers a good and growing selection of hotel
E21  92 accommodation*- including the Hotel \des Roses (Luxury), the Belvedere
E21  93 (1st class B), both with private beaches, and the Pindos (2nd class).
E21  94 ^A new 1st-class hotel, the Hibiscus, with private beach, opens this
E21  95 summer. ^Most interesting of the hotel developments, however, is the
E21  96 Miramare-Beach hotel, recently taken over by Swiss management. ^About
E21  97 three miles out of town, it is a private paradise situated on the
E21  98 curve of a broad bay, looking out to the Turkish coast, 18 miles away.
E21  99 ^Accommodation is in self-contained bungalow units with private toilet
E21 100 and shower or bath, each with its own sun terrace from some of which
E21 101 you can step straight down on to the extensive private beach. ^Full
E21 102 pension rates range from *+3 a day, including the hotel's many
E21 103 facilities, such as swimming-pool, miniature golf, dancing, tennis and
E21 104 transport into town.
E21 105    |^The perfect time to visit the island is in spring or autumn.
E21 106 ^Summer can be very hot, and intermittent rainy spells usually occur
E21 107 any time between November and late February.
E21 108 *<*6SABENA CARAVELLES TO GREECE*>
E21 109    |^*0Early in April, Sabena Belgian World Airlines brought their
E21 110 Caravelle *=6's into service on the Brussels-Athens run, via Vienna or
E21 111 Frankfurt. ^This links with the company's Caravelle schedules
E21 112 London-Brussels and onwards from Athens to various points in the
E21 113 Middle East. ^As usual, I found the Caravelle extremely comfortable
E21 114 and the flight virtually noiseless. ^The triangular windows offer a
E21 115 particularly fine view. ^Good hotels in Athens are the Grande Bretagne
E21 116 ({6de luxe}), on the main square, the Ambassadeurs (A), and the
E21 117 Alice (B). ^The King George *=2 ({6de luxe}), next door to the
E21 118 Grande Bretagne, should also be mentioned for its fine art gallery*- a
E21 119 private collection covering Greek art of the nineteenth century and
E21 120 including some delightful works.

E21 122 *<MINORCA*>
E21 123 *<*4By *6GORDON COOPER*>
E21 124    |^*0Minorca, second largest of the Balearic Islands, is also their
E21 125 Cinderella. ^While this *"White and Blue Island**"*- so called because
E21 126 of the remarkable blue of the Mediterranean sea and sky broken by the
E21 127 brilliant white of the houses*- may not offer much in the way of
E21 128 organised entertainments, it has considerable appeal for those
E21 129 prepared to make their own discoveries. ^Not least, it still retains
E21 130 an unspoilt atmosphere.
E21 131    |^The island is not difficult to reach, for there are air links
E21 132 between it and Barcelona and Palma, while there are thrice weekly
E21 133 sailings during the summer months between Barcelona and Port Mahon, as
E21 134 well as sea communications with Palma and Ibiza. ^It is even possible
E21 135 to make a long day-excursion to Minorca from Palma, travelling both
E21 136 ways by the night steamer. ^In Mahon there is the first-class Hotel
E21 137 Mahon, and there is simple hotel accommodation available at Alcaufer
E21 138 Creek (Hotel Xuroy), Fornells (Fonda Burdo) and near Ciudadela (Hotel
E21 139 Bahia). ^Internal communications are by bus and taxi. ^There is a
E21 140 Tourist Information Office in Mahon, and Horizon Holidays (17, Hanover
E21 141 Street, \0W.1) offer inclusive travel arrangements.
E21 142    |^As every schoolboy knows, Minorca was a British possession during
E21 143 most of the eighteenth century, for it was vital to our naval
E21 144 operations in the Mediterranean. ^It was the scene, too, of that
E21 145 scandalous episode in our history: the events which led to the
E21 146 shooting of Admiral Byng. ^You can still visit the Golden Farm, close
E21 147 to Mahon, which was the temporary home of Nelson and Lady Hamilton in
E21 148 1798.
E21 149    |^Our occupation, however, is not marked as in some other lands by
E21 150 a passion for cricket, but in reminders of our habits, such as the
E21 151 sash windows to be seen in many houses and the names given to various
E21 152 articles in constant use which indicate a survival of the English
E21 153 language. ^Among table accessories the following indicate their
E21 154 origin: \*1kitil *0(kettle); \*1botil *0(bottle); \*1mok *0(mug);
E21 155 \*1saydbord *0(sideboard); and \*1tibord *0(tea-tray). ^Barracks are
E21 156 still called \*1beriks, *0a haversack is \*1aversack, *0and a naval
E21 157 guard is \*1midzamen *0(midshipman). ^The inquiring visitor will
E21 158 discover many more of these curious survivals in language.
E21 159    |
E21 160    |^At Villa Carlos, known in the eighteenth century as Georgetown,
E21 161 the architecture and planning all belong to Portsmouth, with even,
E21 162 to-day, a George Street, a Stuart Street, and even a Victory Street.
E21 163 ^One of the many forts we built at the entrance to the harbour
E21 164 preserves the name of *"Marlborough,**" while in the large square,
E21 165 once used for ceremonial parades, I watched Spanish soldiers playing
E21 166 football and called up *"a vision of serried lines of Redcoats,
E21 167 resplendent in their pipe-clayed accoutrements and thickly-powdered
E21 168 pigtails, of Highlanders in their curious blend of barbaric and formal
E21 169 uniforms, and of the tall Hessians in blue and gold braid**" (Eric
E21 170 Whelpton). ^Incidentally, on public holidays the girls dance a local
E21 171 version of the Highland Fling and wear on these occasions a kind of
E21 172 kilt with a tartan pattern.
E21 173    |^In addition to this historical appeal, there is also considerable
E21 174 archaeological interest, for the island is dotted with the work of
E21 175 prehistoric man, even though much of this record in stone is hard to
E21 176 read. ^The most interesting are the megalithic monuments called
E21 177 \*1talayots*0; tower-like structures of unmortared blocks of stone
E21 178 which bear a certain resemblance to the \*1nuraghe *0of Sardinia, but
E21 179 are not actually linked in any way. ^There are also the altar-like
E21 180 \*1taulas *0and the boat-shaped \*1navetas, *0all offering appeal to
E21 181 those with historical imagination. ^Why should these relics be unique
E21 182 of their kind? ^They certainly provide a mystery for us to-day.
E21 183    |
E21 184    |^Ciudadela, the only other town of size, is some 30 miles distant
E21 185 from Mahon, and lies on the north-western portion of Minorca. ^Prior
E21 186 to the British occupation, it was the capital of the island, and it
E21 187 still retains some interesting buildings, including a number of
E21 188 palaces. ^Generally rather sleepy, it comes to life on \0St. John's
E21 189 Day (June 24), when there is a parade of mounted men in period dress,
E21 190 jousting, and, most exciting of all, the horsemen urging their steeds
E21 191 up staircases into the living-rooms of the people, who pelt them with
E21 192 nuts and lighted fireworks.
E21 193    |^The hinterland of Minorca is flat, except for Monte Toro (1,150
E21 194 \0ft.), a conical mountain on whose summit there is a pilgrimage
E21 195 church. ^The view over the countryside is rewarding, for it shows the
E21 196 number of mortarless stone walls which separate every patch of ground.
E21 197 ^There are even walls around individual trees. ^The land, by the way,
E21 198 is extremely stony, and high winds often prevail. ^But the most
E21 199 striking impression one gets is the dazzling white of the houses, and
E21 200 every building looks as though it had just been whitewashed, while the
E21 201 interior of even the humblest home is spotlessly clean. ^(Were the
E21 202 English of the nineteenth century non-litter-bugs?)
E21 203    |
E21 204    |^The people on this Spanish island are most hospitable, and you
E21 205 can still see occasionally in their homes family heirlooms of Georgian
E21 206 furniture.

E22   3 *<STORY AND PICTURES BY \0H. PEARCE SALES*>
E22   4 *<*4not much is known in Britain about this great little country which
E22   5 burst into flames and into the news in 1956 and has since been
E22   6 forgotten in the West*>
E22   7    |^S*2O-CALLED *0socialist realism which at least until lately has
E22   8 created a dull conformity over most aspects of life in communist
E22   9 countries has taken a resounding defeat in Hungary. ^The traveller
E22  10 cannot but be encouraged immensely by this. ^The artistic temperament
E22  11 of the people is bursting out of a somewhat shabby shell on all sides
E22  12 as a result of 1956 and its uprising. ^Costly and tragic though it was
E22  13 it was not in vain by a long way. ^A more liberal form of communism
E22  14 emerged.
E22  15    |^*1The results of such comparative freedom of expression in the
E22  16 use of colour and in sheer ingenuity in the use of all kinds of
E22  17 materials are delightful and Sandor Patofi, Hungary's greatest poet,
E22  18 who called his compatriots to launch an earlier revolution in his
E22  19 famous Arise Hungary, would have written an even more passionate piece
E22  20 about this silent revolution if he were alive today.
E22  21    |^*0Hungary will become the Italy of the eastern \6*1bloc *0if she
E22  22 is not already assuming the mantle. ^The Bond Street area of Budapest,
E22  23 Va*?2cintca and Petofil Sa*?2ndor, is crowded at most times of the day
E22  24 with elegant women. ^This we take as a signpost. ^Although it is
E22  25 foolish to make forecasts in this context we would not be surprised if
E22  26 the Hungarian's natural bent for original artistic creation will not
E22  27 in time permeate the thinking of all the eastern \6*1bloc *0in even
E22  28 the details of everyday living.
E22  29    |^The priorities of industrial output are being reshuffled in
E22  30 several countries there and time and talent will soon be given to mass
E22  31 producing those fripperies that make life worthwhile for women and
E22  32 women more interesting to men.
E22  33    |^Except that for most people clothing is mainly of second quality
E22  34 and to them is expensive, and cars and refrigerators and the hallmarks
E22  35 generally of a highly developed industrial society are not easily
E22  36 obtainable, the ordinary people seem to have a considerable vested
E22  37 interest in the present way of life in Hungary today.
E22  38    |^*1Necessities and pastimes are abundant and very cheap and
E22  39 encourage support for the present regime, the Hungarians never having
E22  40 tasted the riches of the western peoples and having almost always been
E22  41 part of an oppressed and depressed nation. ^Just imagine experiencing
E22  42 a change from fascism to communism almost overnight*0!
E22  43    |^It was not easy for anyone to believe at the time*- about a year
E22  44 ago*- when the noted scholar {0A. J. P.} Taylor returned from a
E22  45 visit to Hungary, and wrote an encouraging report, that he was not
E22  46 misled while there.
E22  47    |^This is what he wrote: *'the solid unmistakable fact is that
E22  48 Hungarians are now pretty well off: I have never seen a greater
E22  49 display of foodstuffs... there are clothes in every quality, from
E22  50 multiple stores to elegant private shops*- in the provinces too: the
E22  51 days of hardship are over**'. ^We can verify this.
E22  52    |^Now, at a later date, we can add much that will help the travel
E22  53 adviser who wants intelligently and honestly to discuss this unusual
E22  54 country with prospective tourists.
E22  55    |^*1Ask any man in the street in London what he knows about Hungary
E22  56 today and he will mention the *01956 *1uprising and little else. ^To
E22  57 save face he might mention what he will call the international scandal
E22  58 of that year, that though a huge wave of sympathy went out to the
E22  59 Hungarian people, they were crushed militarily and the West did
E22  60 nothing*- as if it could. ^He might even brighten up and say that he
E22  61 had an idea that they breed fine horses and horsemen.
E22  62    |^*0Even in the history books of the West, Hungary is pictured as
E22  63 an unhappy country. ^Riches and privilege ruled and a firmly
E22  64 entrenched church was somehow entangled with those excesses while
E22  65 three million beggars, a term often used to describe the population,
E22  66 existed on what they could scrape from a not very good soil.
E22  67    |^Now a welfare state is firmly established and so far the people
E22  68 seem able to express themselves fairly freely in their work and play
E22  69 and are no longer considered mainly as units in an economic machine
E22  70 which has to be pushed along vigorously to meet over ambitious
E22  71 industrial targets though in the end what is produced and achieved is
E22  72 for those same people.
E22  73    |^The danger of greater control being exercised is still there,
E22  74 though we feel that this excitable people still very much Hungarian at
E22  75 heart would revolt again without question and without considering the
E22  76 consequences if pressure were again exerted. ^Some leading communists
E22  77 confide that the system is now too liberal to achieve quickly enough
E22  78 the kind of results that will impress the children and young people.
E22  79    |^*1Nevertheless the picture in the mind of western man seriously
E22  80 needs to be corrected. ^The Hungarian people are no longer poor or
E22  81 oppressed according to their standards.
E22  82    |^*0Hungary today judging by our own conscientious observations and
E22  83 pointed enquiry is climbing above its circumstances.
E22  84    |^If as is likely Hungary becomes the *'Swiss**' workshop of the
E22  85 eastern \6*1bloc *0in the highly skilled uses of metal in the
E22  86 communist version of a common market at least a settled and
E22  87 increasingly prosperous period is likely to be written into a history
E22  88 that has had far too many *'glorious**' revolutions, occupations and
E22  89 invasions.
E22  90    |^*1Budapest, the only city which the Danube actually crosses of
E22  91 the eight countries it flows through, shows few marks of her previous
E22  92 troubles, though only a quarter of her housing was standing after the
E22  93 war, and she lost all six bridges and the row of well-known hotels on
E22  94 the Danube.
E22  95    |^Even during the worst period of the Berlin crisis when the two
E22  96 \0Mr. \0Ks were shouting across the world there was no tension at all
E22  97 among the people though some strapping young men of the army were
E22  98 sweating it out in exercises in the country.
E22  99    |^*0The people went off as usual at the week-end to the Buda hills
E22 100 for hiking and picnics, or wandered around the museums in Pest, or
E22 101 compromised for the parks or swimming pools of the mile long \0St.
E22 102 Margaret Island in midstream between Buda and Pest*- the city has 500
E22 103 parks.
E22 104    |^They were however all anxious freely to discuss the situation and
E22 105 were upset mainly because the socialist nations were not being
E22 106 considered in the West the powerful and progressive forces that was
E22 107 their due in the counsels of the nations. ^They were as fearful of the
E22 108 situation as is mankind everywhere.
E22 109    |^*1The greatest charge on the material plane that western man
E22 110 makes against socialist systems is that spreading wealth to the
E22 111 ultimate extent and controlling everything tends as we intimated in
E22 112 our introductory remarks to bring conformity and dullness.
E22 113    |^*0But one tends not to consider the spirit of some peoples to
E22 114 overcome this or that personal gain is not the only incentive that
E22 115 mankind responds to. ^And whatever virtues the Hungarians may lack it
E22 116 is certainly not a shortage of spirit. ^Consider their history!
E22 117    |^After the first stages of socialisation, and when it becomes
E22 118 normal and accepted and the party and Government feel *'safe**',
E22 119 individuality tends gradually to come out and bloom again throughout
E22 120 human society and especially so in those countries where communism was
E22 121 born of war and was not adopted initially by choice. ^But it may take
E22 122 a long, long time.
E22 123    |^Hungary is a case in point and examples at random come to mind.
E22 124 ^Her new architecture is attractive, imaginative and colourful and
E22 125 invites comment. ^Whether flats or shops or restaurants, there is a
E22 126 marked individuality.
E22 127    |^*1At an international football match in Budapest in the presence
E22 128 of a visiting premier, \0Mr. Kadar, and a benchful of important party
E22 129 members, there was no communist or patriotic paraphernalia. ^Even
E22 130 recorded cha cha chas were played during the interval and an
E22 131 advertisement trundled round on the back of a lorry for a local leg
E22 132 show.
E22 133    |^*0Her new and refurbished hotels and restaurants are refreshingly
E22 134 different in furnishings and approach, even the uniforms of the staff,
E22 135 though conforming to that simplicity that is good taste.
E22 136    |^Her motor coaches are among the most attractive in the world with
E22 137 unusual touches in colouring, shape and seating.
E22 138    |^*1Her stores and shops, the best of which incidentally are as
E22 139 full of goods as anywhere in Europe, show promise of that elegance
E22 140 with showmanship that is the hallmark of the western city, though many
E22 141 of the small presumably private and struggling shops are pitifully
E22 142 inadequate to the eyes of a Londoner.
E22 143    |^*0Her tourist literature is bright and original and always has
E22 144 its quota of pretty girls, and her publications generally are of a
E22 145 high order. ^She has many attractive daily papers and a host of
E22 146 popular periodicals. ^Even her posters are quite unlike anything one
E22 147 would expect in a communist country.
E22 148    |^And one would hardly dare suggest that her musical life conforms
E22 149 to any except the Hungarian way. ^Gipsy music is still exhilarating
E22 150 and sad in turn and beautifully played everywhere.
E22 151    |^*1Although Liszt can be quoted as being accepted internationally,
E22 152 Bartok and Kodaly, who understandably are worshipped here, are only
E22 153 just about being understood or appreciated anywhere else.
E22 154    |^And art is quite non-conformist enough for the average taste. ^A
E22 155 modern painting in my bedroom at the Royal Hotel would in London have
E22 156 been considered imaginative and certainly not photographic.
E22 157    |^*0The teenagers there could hardly be called conformists either.
E22 158    |^They are dressed as are their western counterparts. ^Some of the
E22 159 girls sported silver sugar loaf or beehive hairdos and almost all seem
E22 160 at some time to parade with many frilly petticoats to umbrella their
E22 161 skirts or appear to have been poured into skin tight slacks and sloppy
E22 162 jumpers. ^They are most attractive. ^The boys wear longish jackets and
E22 163 tight trousers and are well scrubbed.
E22 164    |^But imagine our surprise when on an old brassy and romantic
E22 165 excursion boat cruising down the Danube with a full capacity of family
E22 166 life*- from grandmothers to tiny tots*- the many teenagers rocked and
E22 167 rolled to the strains of the songs of Perry Como and Cliff Richard
E22 168 played on the ship's relay system. ^We later learned that they
E22 169 *'loved**' such western *'pop**' singers, laughed at the cinema with
E22 170 Terry Thomas and Jimmy Edwards, and shed a tear for Norman Wisdom.
E22 171    |^*1Though Budapest is a fine city with many attractions for the
E22 172 traveller, and the Hungarian countryside with its great carpets of
E22 173 maize is pleasant, the Danube bend part of the country being the most
E22 174 beautiful she has to offer*- a car ride for several hours on a summer
E22 175 evening being a most agreeable pastime*- and of course there is the
E22 176 wonderful natural feature of the lake at Balaton, it is the people in
E22 177 Hungary who impress one and who make the traveller feel it is good to
E22 178 be here.
E22 179    |^*0Budapest, which as yet has few new or modernised hotels but
E22 180 takes about 150,000 tourists a year, mainly from the {0USSR}, has
E22 181 much attractive night life. ^It is possible to stay around drinking,
E22 182 talking and being entertained until 5 {0a.m.} but seldom if ever
E22 183 will the tourist become a victim of the malicious malpractices of
E22 184 night life in the West. ^The Hungarians are very honest people and the
E22 185 seamy side of humanity is seemingly kept at bay.
E22 186    |^In many ways it is not easy to be dishonest in a communist
E22 187 country. ^Souvenirs for instance are nearly always a problem for the
E22 188 traveller. ^Here in Hungary prices are fixed for everything. ^Whether
E22 189 you go to the luxury hotel shop or the small place near the market
E22 190 makes no difference. ^This is a very acceptable fact for tourists.
E22 191    |^*1The personality of the Hungarians somehow overawes the material
E22 192 attractions of the place. ^No more is this evident than during one of
E22 193 those hot summer evenings which seem to occur frequently in Budapest.
E22 194 ^Young couples canoodling away in corners are to be seen everywhere,
E22 195 and bring understanding smiles from passing strangers.
E22 196    |^*0Parts of the city with its great and rather gaunt wide streets
E22 197 and squares are attractively lit, and aided by the shop windows seem
E22 198 to draw the inhabitants from far and near.

E23   2 *<*5The art and mystery of quilting*>
E23   3 *<*0By *2VIATOR*>
E23   4    |^QUILTING IS A TRADITIONAL ART IN MOST PARTS OF EUROPE *0and Asia.
E23   5 ^In Siberia was found some years ago coloured quilted material bearing
E23   6 a fine design of reindeer, and dating from the first century {0A.D.}
E23   7 ^In Britain the craft reached its peak in the seventeenth and
E23   8 eighteenth centuries; and it has survived as a peasant art until today
E23   9 in Wales and the North.
E23  10    |^The depression between the two wars resulted in a great revival
E23  11 of quilting, due to efforts to find employment for women in the
E23  12 distressed areas. ^This really began with the showing of some
E23  13 beautiful Durham quilts at the Women's Institutes handicrafts
E23  14 exhibition in London in 1927. ^The Rural Industries Bureau then set to
E23  15 work to foster the craft by forming training centres: quilt wives were
E23  16 found still working in four of the Welsh counties and were engaged to
E23  17 train others. ^A depot was set up in London for the sale of the work,
E23  18 in which Queen Mary took a great interest.
E23  19    |^The simplest kind of quilt such as can be seen in many a Welsh
E23  20 home, consists of two layers of material, sometimes one of them of
E23  21 patchwork, with a layer of unspun wool in between: the whole stitched
E23  22 all over with criss-cross lines to keep the wool in place. ^During the
E23  23 centuries skilled quilt wives have evolved the most intricate patterns
E23  24 in this stitching, thus making the quilt a work of art. ^As a rule no
E23  25 patterns are kept, each quilt is evolved afresh, so that no two are
E23  26 ever exactly alike.
E23  27    |^They are made up of different combinations of simple units of
E23  28 design, the heart, rose, feather, tulip, chain, fan, and so on. ^The
E23  29 feather motif is peculiar to Durham; the chain is used both in the
E23  30 North and in Wales, where you may hear that it was derived from the
E23  31 ships' cables of the ancient Phoenicians. ^Also Welsh are the circles
E23  32 and spirals, recalling the Celtic crosses, which in turn were partly
E23  33 derived from the art of the ancient Britons. ^Leaf shapes are common
E23  34 to both regions: a Glamorgan worker added to her repertoire two new
E23  35 forms, based on a chestnut and a lupin leaf, which a neighbour
E23  36 happened to bring in while she was at work. ^Some of the designs such
E23  37 as the Tudor Rose are believed to date back to Tudor times, handed
E23  38 down in the family since those days.
E23  39    |^The materials are fixed in a frame, which is laid flat upon
E23  40 trestles for working. ^Often two friends will work at it together. ^A
E23  41 few chief points are marked out with chalk before the stitching
E23  42 begins, work usually starting at the centre, with that section fixed
E23  43 in the frame. ^All that is needed besides needle and thread is a ruler
E23  44 and a piece of chalk for drawing on the pattern. ^Sometimes a few
E23  45 household possessions may be used to help with the drawing, a tumbler
E23  46 for circles, or an oval dish*- but nothing more. ^All the rest is done
E23  47 by the eye and hand.
E23  48    |^The best filling is lamb's wool: in the country this can be got
E23  49 ready combed and washed from the nearest of the little woollen
E23  50 factories that still survive in parts of Wales. ^This makes the
E23  51 warmest covering possible, and such quilts are easily washed when
E23  52 necessary.
E23  53    |^A famous Quilt Wife was \0Mrs. Catrin Evans of Bow Street in
E23  54 Cardiganshire. ^In her time, she made hundreds of quilts; her work
E23  55 could be found all over the country and further afield, even in
E23  56 America. ^As a girl she had been taught the craft in a month's
E23  57 apprenticeship; after that, she was a finished artist.
E23  58    |^In those days, Welsh quilt wives might go to work at a farmhouse.
E23  59 ^In her own words: ^*"Many weeks before a farmer's daughter was to be
E23  60 married, I would be called to a farm. ^The farmer's daughter would
E23  61 require six and sometimes more quilts for her new home. ^Her mother
E23  62 would provide all the material. ^I would take my wooden frame to the
E23  63 farm and for weeks I would be making quilts for the bride.
E23  64    |^*"I was paid a shilling a day and had my food and lodging. ^I
E23  65 worked from seven in the morning till nine at night. ^Most times they
E23  66 would be patchwork quilts, farmers' wives kept all the old clothes to
E23  67 be cut up for quilts. ^I've been days and days doing nothing but
E23  68 cutting out and matching pieces.**"
E23  69    |^All that was nearly a century ago. ^In recent years the workers
E23  70 have been helped to adapt their old designs, formerly found only on
E23  71 bedspreads, to such intricate shapes as dressing gowns, coats and
E23  72 cardigans, as well as to rugs and cushions. ^The idea of quilted motor
E23  73 rugs, with cushions to match, the colours harmonising with the colour
E23  74 of the car, was one that appealed to many buyers in the days of the
E23  75 revival after the first war.

E23  77 *<*4Making the most of Spring flowers*>
E23  78    |^*2MOST OF OUR SPRING FLOWERS ARE GROWN FROM BULBS OR *0corms, and
E23  79 all such flowers prefer to be arranged with stems standing in shallow
E23  80 water. ^So when considering the designing of spring flowers it is not
E23  81 surprising to find that modern line or Japanese styles are popular
E23  82 with floral artists. ^These arrangements generally call for shallow
E23  83 dishes and trays, \0etc. ^Some cleverly executed modern designs can
E23  84 completely transform a very ordinary earthenware meat dish or soup
E23  85 plate into loveliness.
E23  86    |^Even the simplest design of catkin sprays and daffodils can look
E23  87 most effective. ^During the early part of the year when flowers are
E23  88 both difficult and expensive, economy is important, thus the design
E23  89 chosen must aim at making the best possible use of each flower. ^The
E23  90 uncluttered simplicity of clean-cut lines echoes the freshness of
E23  91 spring itself, while the yellow *"King Alfred**" trumpets herald the
E23  92 coming of summer sunshine.
E23  93    |^It is essential that all flowers and foliage appear to be growing
E23  94 from one root or indeed from one bulb. ^Although not difficult to
E23  95 achieve, many newcomers to floral art fail to give this point
E23  96 sufficient importance. ^All stems should be placed so that they
E23  97 radiate from the centre of the container or the pinholder, and not
E23  98 placed soldier-fashion, all in a row. ^Tender, hollow stems such as
E23  99 those of daffodils or narcissi sometimes split when placed on
E23 100 pinholders, but if the base of these stems are **[SIC**] first tied
E23 101 lightly with a little cotton or wool, it will prevent further trouble.
E23 102 ^Thin stems such as those of freezias, violets, primroses, \0etc.,
E23 103 that are too fragile or thin to stand on the pinholder can be grouped
E23 104 and placed inside a natural hollow stem (like the cow-parsley stem for
E23 105 instance). ^This is an excellent way also of giving length to very
E23 106 short stems that are required high up in an arrangement. ^The hollow
E23 107 stems should first be filled with water to make sure that no air
E23 108 bubble gets in and so prevent the water from reaching the flower head.
E23 109    |^Crescent-shaped designs are often favoured for spring flowers and
E23 110 for this purpose stems of such things as willow-catkins and green
E23 111 broom can be persuaded to curve or bend by first soaking them in warm
E23 112 water and then using firm pressure of warm hands. ^The natural curving
E23 113 or bending action of the tulip stems on the other hand has always
E23 114 presented a problem to the flower arranger. ^Stems of the early-forced
E23 115 varieties are especially tender, owing to the unnatural atmosphere in
E23 116 which many of them are grown. ^Many words of advice have been written
E23 117 on this subject*- a teaspoonful of sugar or starch added to the water,
E23 118 we are told, helps to keep tulip stems straight. ^Florists use stub
E23 119 wires twisted around the stems when a rigid stem is required for use
E23 120 in wreath or bouquet.
E23 121    |^You may also have noticed that all bought tulips have rubber
E23 122 bands tied around the stems; the more tender the stems the more rubber
E23 123 bands are used. ^This is essential for quick handling by the florists
E23 124 and also to ensure the minimum of damage during display. ^Some
E23 125 varieties of tulips have stronger stems than others. ^Your seedsman
E23 126 usually indicates this in his catalogue. ^Occasionally I arrange some
E23 127 of the weaker-stemmed varieties so that they flow naturally and
E23 128 gracefully from the container. ^They show to best effect when the
E23 129 container is placed on a stand or pedestal.
E23 130    |^Few flowers offer a wider range of colour and shape than the
E23 131 tulip. ^Two varieties which I favour are the graceful, pure white
E23 132 lily-flowered *"White Triumphator**" and the exciting wierd-shaped,
E23 133 **[SIC**] black Parrot.
E23 134    |^Last year in Paris it gave me great pleasure to use both
E23 135 varieties together in the one arrangement. ^The subject I had chosen
E23 136 to illustrate was *"Jekyll and Hyde.**" ^An unusual one for a flower
E23 137 arrangement. ^The idea came to me as I wandered in the garden one day
E23 138 when the contrast in the colour and shape of these two flowers
E23 139 impressed me very much. ^The required effect for the exhibition was
E23 140 gained by grouping all the pure and angelic-like white flowers on the
E23 141 one side, reaching upwards, while on the other side the black ones
E23 142 were grouped, dark and almost sinister, to hang and creep down as if
E23 143 in despair. ^The final touch was added to this dramatic
E23 144 interpretation, by placing it to stand on a base of misty grey tulle,
E23 145 representing the mysteries of the human mind.
E23 146    |^Another Spring flower, the iris, is sometimes called *"The poor
E23 147 man's orchid.**" ^It is not the colour or the texture of iris petals
E23 148 that fascinate me, but the fine detail of their exquisite shape. ^I
E23 149 love them all, the Dutch and English varieties, and later on the Flag
E23 150 and Bearded types among which there are such exciting colour
E23 151 combinations. ^My favourite, however, is a small green and black
E23 152 variety sometimes called *"The Widow Iris**", undoubtedly because of
E23 153 its subdued colouring. ^To the keen gardener it may appear dull and
E23 154 uninteresting but one is not expected to foresee the dignity it
E23 155 portrays when arranged with the right kind of flowers.
E23 156    |^Another iris which I would not care to be without is a species
E23 157 called \*1Foetidissima (*0Gladdon). ^Although its flowers are small
E23 158 and rather insignificant, it is well worth growing for its brilliant
E23 159 scarlet berries and bright green foliage. ^The latter persists almost
E23 160 throughout the year. ^Iris were often favoured in old Dutch and
E23 161 Flemish flower portraits and are even more frequently found in
E23 162 Japanese pictures and designs. ^Illustrated here is the typical
E23 163 *"Florist's half-dozen**" iris used in Japanese style. ^The
E23 164 arrangement is in two separate parts and so is known as *"The divided
E23 165 \kenzan**" design, \kenzan being the Japanese word for pinholder.
E23 166 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
E23 167    |^The container in the photograph is a blue *"Denby Ware**" meat
E23 168 dish, and the small pebbles in the water add considerably to the
E23 169 decorative effect of the completed arrangement. ^Some leaves of the
E23 170 purple decorative kale are conveniently used to tone in with the
E23 171 general colour scheme, adding weight to the base of the design, and to
E23 172 hide the pinholder from view. ^The purple and white variegated
E23 173 varieties of kale are easily grown. ^The seeds can be planted in open
E23 174 ground and later transplanted like other members of the cabbage
E23 175 family. ^This method ensures that only the best coloured specimens are
E23 176 given garden space. ^The leaves are at their best during the winter
E23 177 months when all other foliage is scarce. ^They last for weeks in
E23 178 water. ^To prevent the water fouling, a chlorophyl tablet should be
E23 179 added.
E23 180    |^Farmers' wives need never worry about growing too much of this
E23 181 kale because what is not needed for decorative purposes can always be
E23 182 thrown over the garden fence for the cows.
E23 183    |^Many varieties of shrubs blossom during April and May. ^The
E23 184 bushes are dressed overall in jewel colours. ^Brilliant pink camelias
E23 185 **[SIC**] are about the earliest, closely followed by scarlet
E23 186 rhododendrons, cerise azalea, creamy magnolias and best of all, the
E23 187 garden lilacs. ^Alas, how often have we all hopefully filled jugs and
E23 188 vases with the freshest, sweetest lilac only to find that after a day
E23 189 or so the flowers have wilted sadly and the leaves seem fresh enough?

E24   2 *<*6IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY*>
E24   3 *<*1by {0E. L.} Wright*>
E24   4    |^*4T*2HIS *0summer many thousands of exposures in either black and
E24   5 white or colour will be made by photographers of all kinds, and there
E24   6 is no doubt that many will wish that they had made a better job of it.
E24   7 ^So here you are shown how to obtain better results.
E24   8 *<*4The Camera*>
E24   9    |^*0The make and type of camera you use is not so important as many
E24  10 people try to make out. ^The expert will get splendid results from a
E24  11 cheap box camera; others will get poor results from an expensive
E24  12 model. ^The greater the amount paid for a camera, and the more gadgets
E24  13 it has is no sure way of guaranteeing good results. ^But whatever
E24  14 model you have, study it carefully and know thoroughly how to work it
E24  15 and what its capabilities and limitations are. ^Once you are master of
E24  16 your camera, you have gone a long way to good pictures.
E24  17 *<*4Exposure*>
E24  18    |^*0More negatives are spoilt by wrong exposure, especially by
E24  19 over-exposure, than by any other cause. ^Modern films are so fast that
E24  20 one is apt to underestimate the amount of light reaching the film and
E24  21 so cause very dense images. ^The tables published by the film makers
E24  22 and included with the film are an excellent guide, but there is no
E24  23 doubt that a light meter is worth its cost. ^Once set it takes all the
E24  24 guess work from exposure, and will show a high percentage of well
E24  25 graded negatives from which pleasing prints may be obtained.
E24  26    |^All photography depends on light reflected from the subject
E24  27 burning an image on the film; the stronger the light the denser the
E24  28 image. ^But a light meter measures only the average amount of light
E24  29 reflected from the subject. ^Thus a certain amount of care has to be
E24  30 exercised in its use.
E24  31    |^The common way of using one is to point it at the subject and
E24  32 take a reading. ^But what happens if you take your best girl in a
E24  33 white frock standing against a black background? ^Either she comes out
E24  34 with a white sheet of a face and frock, void of all detail, and a
E24  35 dense black background, or else the detail is present in her face and
E24  36 clothing and the wall looks peculiar. ^This is because you cannot get
E24  37 a good reading with such a contrasty subject.
E24  38    |^Now my way is to use the incident light method. ^Most light
E24  39 meters are sold with a translucent mask which will fit over the light
E24  40 aperture. ^Fit it every time you use the meter, and point the meter
E24  41 towards the light source, making sure that it points slightly
E24  42 downwards below the horizon, and not directly at the light. ^You will
E24  43 then get much better readings and hence much better negatives. ^I
E24  44 always use this method and rarely get wrongly exposed negatives or
E24  45 transparencies.
E24  46    |^While on this subject of exposure, do not forget a lens hood.
E24  47 ^This is one of the most valuable accessories it is possible to have,
E24  48 and use it every time you make an exposure. ^If you have not got one,
E24  49 then try to get one that is made for your particular camera for then
E24  50 it is specially computed not to interfere with the working of the
E24  51 lens.
E24  52 *<*4Composition*>
E24  53    |^*0After exposure the most important part of photography lies in
E24  54 the composition of the picture, but this is a topic that cannot
E24  55 adequately be covered in the space allowed to me. ^You have all seen
E24  56 the portrait with the tree or telegraph pole standing out of the
E24  57 sitter's head, or the face screwed into a painful grimace because the
E24  58 subject is staring into a powerful sun.
E24  59    |^Many books have been written about composition, but a short
E24  60 answer is, does the picture look right in all its aspects*- position
E24  61 of subject; balance; colour or tonal range? ^Is there anything in the
E24  62 picture which seems alien to the idea being illustrated? ^If there is,
E24  63 then the composition is not right.
E24  64    |^If you are interested in portraits then try to make your sitter
E24  65 take an interesting pose. ^Do avoid making the subject stare directly
E24  66 at the lens; a three quarter view is more appealing, and, if possible,
E24  67 do have the sitter doing something. ^Looking at a book; examining a
E24  68 statue or the scenery, or gardening; anything that will take away that
E24  69 camera conscious look. ^And at all costs keep the background plain,
E24  70 for a distracting background spoils thousands of portraits each year.
E24  71    |^Then again, many photographs shown to me for criticism have been
E24  72 spoilt by camera shake. ^Do learn to hold the camera still and not
E24  73 jerk the button at the moment of exposure, especially you 35 \0mm.
E24  74 people, for when your negatives or transparencies are enlarged the
E24  75 slightest bit of camera shake will be magnified many fold.
E24  76    |^It is not possible to cover all aspects of photography in this
E24  77 small space but it is hoped the foregoing will help you to better
E24  78 photography this year.
E24  79 *<*6EXPRESSION IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL*>
E24  80 *<*1by {0S. C.} Clarkson*>
E24  81 *<*4The First Two Years*>
E24  82    |^T*2HERE *0is, of course, no well-defined break at any normal
E24  83 stage of progress in expression, though one can see the nai"ve work of
E24  84 the infant and the competent feeling for words of the young Grammar
E24  85 school pupil. ^Between these two stages the Primary school has to
E24  86 formulate the ideas of personal composition, as well as giving the
E24  87 elements of grammar, spelling and style*- the tools for the job.
E24  88    |^By and large today, the Infant school is a separate entity.
E24  89 ^Often the seven year old goes *'up to the big school**', or to a
E24  90 different part of the town altogether. ^All teachers agree that the
E24  91 transfer should be as smooth as possible. ^The Junior school teacher
E24  92 for the first two years should surely be aware of the Infant methods
E24  93 and be in sympathy with those methods employed. ^What a set-back it is
E24  94 in expression-work of any sort, if the child on transfer is overawed
E24  95 or ill at ease in the new atmosphere! ^Most little ones have a
E24  96 contribution to make and are eager to learn and be sociable. ^This
E24  97 first eagerness should be guided and controlled but not damped or
E24  98 thwarted, if vital work is to be nurtured in the children.
E24  99    |^The Primary teacher will find wide variation in both desire and
E24 100 power of expression. ^Home backgrounds differ. ^Some have sympathetic
E24 101 or indulgent parents. ^Some homes are mere dormitories, with only the
E24 102 week-end allowing time for the parents to meet as a family. ^It
E24 103 follows then that the teacher will have to divide the classes into
E24 104 groups of roughly the same standard of progress and to allow for the
E24 105 *'advanced**' child as also for the slower one.
E24 106    |^The *'Board of Education**', as it was in 1933, made a true and
E24 107 wise statement in its Suggestions Handbook. ^*"Written composition,**"
E24 108 it said, *"is generally begun too soon and practised too often.**" ^It
E24 109 is only tradition and obsession that demands a weekly piece of writing
E24 110 from each child in the class. ^If we look ahead a little to the work
E24 111 of the majority of our leavers, we must admit that few will need (nor
E24 112 will they wish perhaps) to have to write a formal letter. ^This is a
E24 113 *2READING *0world. ^But how can we make it a *2SPEAKING *0world? ^Our
E24 114 children must first have something to say before they can write it.
E24 115 ^Almost every lesson should give chance for the children *'to say
E24 116 their piece**'. ^The one word answer should be discouraged and the
E24 117 onus of response fairly shared. ^For some children will be needed a
E24 118 stimulus, for a domineering few the gentle brake. ^Perhaps all may
E24 119 find individual opportunity in the small and carefully planned
E24 120 *'Group**' or *'Family**'. ^A folio of large pictures or posters,
E24 121 lively and colourful is collected and these are discussed and talked
E24 122 about in turn. ^Occasionally during the term there is one child able
E24 123 to weave an interesting oral tale with this *'broadsheet**' as a
E24 124 starting point. ^Incidentally useful illustrations have been gleaned
E24 125 from the covers of magazines (Ronald Lampitt's aerial studies for the
E24 126 former *'John Bull**' are full of detail and good exercises in correct
E24 127 observation). ^The information sheets of the National Savings Movement
E24 128 I have found valuable, as indeed are most travel posters. ^In a word
E24 129 here, one should say, never destroy any picture. ^Teachers cannot have
E24 130 too many, future articles will show the use to which they may be
E24 131 placed in expression work.
E24 132    |^Quite a few nervous children are diffident about facing a
E24 133 critical audience of their own fellows. ^To overcome this I have in
E24 134 the classroom a home-made *'television screen**'. ^My third article
E24 135 will explain the making of this apparatus. ^Behind this cover I have
E24 136 found it more easy for some to make their announcements, conduct
E24 137 *'interviews**', or retell and devise a *'commercial advertisement**'.
E24 138    |^Some of the first attempts at *'composition**' will be the
E24 139 retelling of stories read or heard. ^Here is little scope for original
E24 140 thought, and the severe discipline of the sequence of detail has to be
E24 141 observed. ^The great stories of the Bible (not only the parables) have
E24 142 inspired adult authors. ^The Old Testament is full of dramatic
E24 143 action*- the two spies Joshua and Caleb; the four leprous men who
E24 144 discovered the forsaken camp at Samaria told in *=2 Kings, chapter 7;
E24 145 Paul's shipwreck in the Adriatic that fascinated Nelson before
E24 146 Trafalgar; Naboth's vineyard, are all excellent material source
E24 147 **[SIC**] for the young story-teller.
E24 148    |^So too are the merry jingles, nursery rhymes, limericks and
E24 149 sing-song skipping snatches*- these by their very beat or homely
E24 150 humour are quickly memorised. ^They are worth collating into a
E24 151 personal anthology. ^Progressive teachers will know of the similar
E24 152 series titled *'Sally go round the Moon**', and *'Bells across the
E24 153 Meadow**', which seem to me to be a fine collection for speaking,
E24 154 learning, and enjoying.
E24 155    |^Anecdotes on this style may be gleaned for telling and retelling
E24 156 by the children orally or on paper when sufficient skill is acquired.
E24 157 ^(*"...Sir Isaac Newton completely forgot about eating when his mind
E24 158 was on a problem. ^One day his landlady had to go out, but left him an
E24 159 egg to boil for three minutes. ^She returned much later to find Sir
E24 160 Isaac with the egg in his hand while his watch boiled merrily away in
E24 161 the pan.**" ^Other fanciful tales could be made up on the same lines.
E24 162    |^Pets are a natural centre of interest to children. ^Quite young
E24 163 people will say how they care for their animals or will *'open out**'
E24 164 if they are privileged to hold a pet that has been brought to school.
E24 165 ^Small booklets in the shape of animals can be contrived and filled
E24 166 with little stories and poems about animals. ^These can be individual
E24 167 and most delightful where the children have been interested and
E24 168 encouraged.
E24 169    |^My own charges are always asked to bring their cards to show (and
E24 170 talk about) on their birthdays, whilst immediately after Christmas
E24 171 each one in turn brings the favourite present, with where possible a
E24 172 talking demonstration. ^We have seen *'Bayko**' houses go up, steam
E24 173 engines turn, dolls be dressed, roller skates donned, and embryo
E24 174 conjurors explain their tricks!
E24 175    |^At all ages in the Primary school I set great store on the
E24 176 keeping of personal diaries. ^In these small lined notebooks, in which
E24 177 pencil may be used, one of the first tasks of the day is for an entry
E24 178 if possible. ^Not all days are Red-Letter days, but a child will be
E24 179 glad at some slight happenings and wish to record the fact of getting
E24 180 all its sums or spellings correct; of playing or supporting at a
E24 181 school match; of the class weekly service; broadcast lesson; or
E24 182 visitor to the school.
E24 183    |^Half of the booklet issued for the personal diaries is used for
E24 184 the compiling of a dictionary. ^Except for the rarely used letters x,
E24 185 z, q, and y, a whole page is given to each of the remaining letters.
E24 186 ^At the beginning of the year all children copy in on the right page
E24 187 the days of the week, months and season, popular colours and the names
E24 188 of schools around.

E25   4 second one, dealing with electric cookers, will be published shortly,
E25   5 together with a comparison of the two types.
E25   6    |^Whatever features or trimmings a cooker may have, the main
E25   7 requirements are few and simple. ^The oven and grill must cook
E25   8 evenly*- the oven, over a wide range of temperatures. ^On the hob,
E25   9 food must be cooked fast or slowly, as required. ^The cooker must be
E25  10 easy to use and easy to clean. ^The finish must be able to stand up to
E25  11 hard wear.
E25  12 *<*6BRANDS*>
E25  13    |^*0The 16 gas cookers chosen for testing are listed in Table *=1.
E25  14 ^They cost about *+30 to *+70, the most popular price range, and had
E25  15 four boiling burners (except for the *2NEW WORLD 33 *0and *2PEERESS,
E25  16 *0which had three), an oven and a grill. ^One, the *2LONDON, *0was
E25  17 only available in the North Thames Gas Board area, where it has a very
E25  18 wide sale. ^The *2NEW WORLD 173 RANGETTE, *0larger than most, was
E25  19 included because it was in the same price range, had unusual features
E25  20 and is widely sold.
E25  21    |^Table cookers and small models with only one or two boiling
E25  22 burners were excluded; so were very large, expensive models and those
E25  23 designed to be built in as part of a series of kitchen fitments.

E25  25 the text.

E25  28 the height*- particularly of the hob*- the distance the cooker stands
E25  29 out from the wall (depth), and its width are important. ^These are
E25  30 listed in Table *=1.
E25  31 *<*6OVENS*>
E25  32 *<*4Useful cooking space*>
E25  33    |^*0There is considerable difference between the size of an oven
E25  34 and the useful cooking space in it. ^This is because some space is
E25  35 necessary round the food to allow the heat to circulate. ^The cooking
E25  36 space has been calculated in cubic inches from the area of the baking
E25  37 tray provided and the height from the lowest cooking level (the bottom
E25  38 of the oven) to the lowest projection at the top*- usually the top of
E25  39 the door frame. ^This is the method of British Standard 1250: 1955
E25  40 (Domestic Appliances burning town gas) for calculating cooking space
E25  41 (figures in Table *=1). ^The whole oven can be used when necessary,
E25  42 however*- for a turkey, for instance. ^For the best results, no baking
E25  43 tray larger than the one provided with the cooker should be used, as
E25  44 it might make the cooking uneven.
E25  45 *<*4Shelves*>
E25  46    |^*0Two shelves were provided with each cooker. ^A third,
E25  47 reversible one was provided with the *2ENVOY. ^*0There were 13
E25  48 possible cooking levels, including the oven base, for the *2ENVOY,
E25  49 *0compared with only four for the *2LEISURE, *0and five to nine for
E25  50 the others (see Table *=1).
E25  51    |^All shelves were designed to slide out without tilting
E25  52 appreciably and*- to prevent the risk of accidentally pulling the
E25  53 shelf right out*- most had to be lifted in order to remove them.
E25  54    |^Those *1without *0this safeguard were the *2CANNON, EQUERRY,
E25  55 ENVOY, LONDON, MONARCH *0and the *2NEW WORLD 33 *0and 42A.
E25  56    |^The *2LEISURE *0had an additional inner glass door*- a possible
E25  57 advantage, as cooking progress could be inspected without allowing
E25  58 much heat to escape. ^The glass door became too hot to open without an
E25  59 oven cloth.
E25  60 *<*4Cleaning*>
E25  61    |^*0How easy the ovens are to clean depends as much on how they are
E25  62 used as on their design. ^But the removable oven top and base of the
E25  63 *2CAVALIER, *0the removable oven top of the *2NEW WORLD 44, *0and the
E25  64 hinged oven top of the *2EQUERRY *0were definitely helpful.
E25  65    |^Oven cleaning can be tiresome. ^It may be useful to remember that
E25  66 there will be less splashing when joints are cooked longer, at a lower
E25  67 temperature; when the meat is covered with foil; when a container is
E25  68 well filled; and that the oven floor can be protected from spilt juice
E25  69 if a tray is put under pies or tarts.
E25  70    |^When the oven does get dirty, it should be wiped out while it is
E25  71 still warm before the dirt has time to stick.
E25  72 *<*4Thermostats*>
E25  73    |^*0All the ovens had thermostats. ^This meant that they heated up
E25  74 to, and stayed at, a temperature that depended on the thermostat
E25  75 setting. ^All were marked 1/4, 1/2, and 1 to 9.
E25  76    |^The *2RENOWN *0also had settings 10, 11, and 12, but its cookery
E25  77 book gives no recipes for them.
E25  78    |^Eight cookers had extra *'low**' settings*- lower than the 1/4
E25  79 settings*- for dishwarming and for slow cooking. ^The British Standard
E25  80 implies that all cookers should cook the same dish at the same
E25  81 setting. ^For each cooker, the manufacturer's instructions indicate
E25  82 the best shelf position for different types of food; this is important
E25  83 as the oven is, intentionally, much hotter at the top than at the
E25  84 bottom.
E25  85 **[TABLE**]
E25  86    |^We recorded, as a matter of interest, the temperature (*@\0F.) at
E25  87 the top, middle and bottom of each oven, at settings 2, 6 and 9.
E25  88    |^It was not easy to set the oven to the same temperature each
E25  89 time, because of play in the thermostat knob. ^It is worth getting
E25  90 into the habit of always setting the thermostat from a higher figure.
E25  91 *<*4Cooking performance*>
E25  92    |^*0\0CA carried out the cooking tests specified in the British
E25  93 Standard.
E25  94    |^They show whether the right amount of heat reaches the top and
E25  95 bottom of the food. ^Also, by the evenness of browning, they show how
E25  96 even the heat is at different levels in the oven, when both baking
E25  97 trays and circular cake tins are used, as these affect the circulation
E25  98 of heat differently. ^The oven is tested at cool and hot settings, and
E25  99 when it is filled with different size dishes, for a complete dinner.
E25 100 ^Each dish has to be ready within a specified time.
E25 101    |^There is nothing adventurous about the recipes, but they provide
E25 102 a good test for cookers.
E25 103    |^Details of the tests are given in Table *=2
E25 104    |^Some ovens cooked better than others, but all were satisfactory.
E25 105 ^The three best were the *2CAVALIER, ENVOY *0and *2PRINCE. ^*0The
E25 106 *2LEISURE, MONARCH *0and *2CABARET, *0at the other end of the scale,
E25 107 were fairly good. ^On the *2LEISURE, *0the food tended to overbrown on
E25 108 the underside.
E25 109    |^The *2MONARCH *0oven cooked slowly; neither the rich fruit cake
E25 110 nor most of the dinner was well cooked in the time allowed.
E25 111    |^The *2CABARET *0oven was cooler than most, particularly at higher
E25 112 settings. ^Food cooked slowly and the top browned before the
E25 113 underside. ^Gradings of the cooking performance of each oven are given
E25 114 in Table *=1.
E25 115 *<*6HOBS*>
E25 116 *<*4Cleaning*>
E25 117    |^*0The tops of cookers get very messy. ^Even the most careful cook
E25 118 lets the milk boil over sometimes. ^So it is most important that the
E25 119 top should be easy to clean. ^In our tests, the hobs were dirtied by
E25 120 letting milk boil over on two burners of each cooker.
E25 121 **[TABLE**]
E25 122 ^All the milk was then cleaned from the cooker, and whatever parts
E25 123 were necessary to do this were moved.
E25 124    |^Both time and difficulty in cleaning were taken into account when
E25 125 assessing the results.
E25 126    |^The *2CANNON *0and *2NEW WORLD 42A *0came out best, then the
E25 127 *2PEERESS, CABARET *0and *2NEWHOME.
E25 128    |^*0Worst to clean was the *2MONARCH. ^*0The milk burned on the hob
E25 129 very readily and trickled down under the spillage tray. ^Cleaning was
E25 130 both slow and difficult. ^The *2LEISURE *0and *2NEW WORLD 44 *0were
E25 131 little better than the *2MONARCH.
E25 132    |^*0The *2NEW WORLD 33, 44 *0and *2RANGETTE *0had similar hobs,
E25 133 completely different from all the other cookers. ^They consisted of
E25 134 removable stainless steel rods (see photograph on \0p. 252).
E25 135    |^The rods became discoloured by heat from the burners and had to
E25 136 be rubbed with abrasive to restore their original appearance. ^The
E25 137 time to do this was not included in our cleaning assessment.
E25 138    |^We have been told that some people prefer this new design, but in
E25 139 two series of tests carried out by \0CA, we found that they were more
E25 140 difficult and slower to clean than most of the others.
E25 141 *<*4Boiling speed*>
E25 142    |^*0The speed with which water could be heated was considered to be
E25 143 particularly important.
E25 144    |^A pint could be boiled in a pan on at least one burner of all the
E25 145 cookers in under 3 1/2 minutes. ^The quickest was about 2 3/4 minutes.
E25 146 ^It was found that burners of the same make and gas rating took
E25 147 slightly different times to do the same job. ^Because of this, and the
E25 148 fairly small difference in time taken by the different models, we
E25 149 consider it impossible to pick out any as being markedly faster than
E25 150 others.
E25 151    |^Three pints could be boiled in 6 to 7 minutes.
E25 152 *<*4Simmering*>
E25 153    |^*0All the boiling burners could be set low enough to keep one or
E25 154 three pints of water simmering at 180*@\0F. with the lid off, but not
E25 155 with it on.
E25 156    |^When simmering food, you burn it if the heat is not evenly
E25 157 distributed at the bottom of the pan. ^To find out which cookers
E25 158 provided the most even heat, porridge was simmered at as near as
E25 159 possible to 180*@\0F. in a light, 7-inch diameter, aluminium pan
E25 160 without a lid for 30 minutes. ^Only the size of burner producing the
E25 161 most even heat was rated as this would be the best one for simmering.
E25 162    |^The *2MONARCH *0simmered most evenly, leaving a negligible
E25 163 deposit on the bottom of the pan. ^Only one, the *2ENVOY, *0caused any
E25 164 burning, and this was only slight.
E25 165 *<*4Special burners*>
E25 166    |^*0The *2MONARCH *0and *2RENOWN *0each had a thermostatically
E25 167 controlled boiling burner as well as three ordinary ones. ^They are
E25 168 designed to raise food to, and keep it at, a constant temperature.
E25 169 ^This is achieved by a device which adjusts the gas according to the
E25 170 temperature of the pan base, against which it is spring-loaded.
E25 171    |^Different types and quantities of food, and different pans, need
E25 172 different settings, mentioned in the manufacturers' cookery books.
E25 173    |^We found, however, that, when chips were put into a pan of hot
E25 174 fat, there was a delay before the burner responded to the change in
E25 175 temperature. ^The fat heated up again much more slowly than on an
E25 176 ordinary burner with the tap turned full on until the fat was hot
E25 177 again. ^The chips cooked on the two special burners were considered
E25 178 very soggy compared with those cooked on ordinary burners.
E25 179    |^But, in general, the special burners are useful when you want to
E25 180 leave the cooker unattended. ^When you have learnt the setting*- for
E25 181 the pan, the food and the quantities*- you can do this, knowing that
E25 182 nothing will boil over, or burn.
E25 183 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
E25 184 *<*6GRILL*>
E25 185 *<*4Design*>
E25 186    |^*0A recent trend in cooker design has been to move the grills to
E25 187 eye level. ^The advantage of a grill above the hob is that it is
E25 188 easier to watch, as you don't have to bend, and allows the oven to be
E25 189 higher. ^Only one of the models tested, the *2ENVOY, *0had the grill
E25 190 in the old position, below the hob. ^One, the *2RANGETTE, *0had the
E25 191 grill just above the hob, on which the grill pan rested (see
E25 192 photograph on \0p. 252). ^All the others had the grill at eye level.
E25 193 **[TABLE**]
E25 194    |^With all but one of the cookers the grid of the grill pan could
E25 195 be at one of two possible distances from the heat. ^The exception was
E25 196 the *2CANNON, *0which had four available positions.
E25 197    |^THE *2CANNON *0and *2NEW WORLD 44 *0grill pans had two handles
E25 198 and were difficult to hold in one hand. ^This meant that the grill pan
E25 199 had to be put down before toast could be turned, for example. ^Five
E25 200 models*- *2LEISURE, CANNON, RANGETTE, ENVOY, *0and *2MONARCH*- *0had
E25 201 grill compartments which could be closed when not in use, but only on
E25 202 the *2ENVOY *0and *2MONARCH *0could they be closed with the grill pan
E25 203 under.
E25 204    |^The grill compartments are also useful for putting dishes to warm
E25 205 with heat from the oven or boiling burners. ^Other cookers had open
E25 206 shelves under the grill which could be used for the same purpose.
E25 207 ^There were no such facilities on the *2RENOWN *0whose grill pan was
E25 208 suspended between runners.
E25 209    |^As with ovens, the size of a grill or grill pan grid was not the
E25 210 same as its effective area (see below).
E25 211 *# 2012
E26   1 **[131 TEXT E26**]
E26   2 ^*0Later, and rather surreptitiously, I was shown the bathroom*- a new
E26   3 addition, painted blue and adorned with a multitude of gold stars. ^I
E26   4 did not see even then why only the *'gentlemen**' should be allowed to
E26   5 enjoy all the stars.
E26   6    |^When the question of morning tea and baths is settled there is
E26   7 breakfast*- in bed or downstairs? ^Most hostesses are glad to keep a
E26   8 guest in bed until after breakfast; many guests are thankful to be
E26   9 there, and the way the matter is broached varies. ^*'Will you have
E26  10 your breakfast in bed?**' is the sort of gambit which frequently
E26  11 causes a shy guest to enter into a flutter of protest about being a
E26  12 nuisance; if, however, you say: ~*'Your breakfast will arrive at any
E26  13 time you like,**' as though the whole thing were automatic and
E26  14 impersonal, it will probably help. ^Then, after you have ascertained
E26  15 whether it is to be tea or coffee and made sure of any other details,
E26  16 you can go to bed yourself, to sleep with an easy conscience.
E26  17    |^It is not everybody that likes to be given breakfast in bed; on
E26  18 the other hand, because it is so many people's idea of bliss, I would
E26  19 like to say something more about it. ^The bliss can be considerably
E26  20 marred if the tray is overcrowded or ill-arranged so that in order to
E26  21 pour out it becomes necessary to move things, to play a sort of game
E26  22 of chess in bed. ^Surprisingly few people lay a breakfast-tray
E26  23 logically and well. ^Many otherwise observant hostesses somehow
E26  24 overlook the fact that misery can set in if the tray is so heavy that
E26  25 you can hardly support it. ^They seem to forget how wretched the whole
E26  26 thing can be if the coffee is too weak or the tea too strong or either
E26  27 of them not hot enough, and that desperation can set in if any of the
E26  28 following things have been forgotten: salt, pepper, mustard (when ham
E26  29 or sausages are served), soft sugar (for grapefruit or stewed fruit)
E26  30 or any of the requisite implements.
E26  31    |^If you are an inexperienced hostess, have a hopeless memory, are
E26  32 in love and therefore a bit absent-minded or tend always to be sleepy
E26  33 in the mornings, it is as well to make a list like the following; keep
E26  34 it in the kitchen, check it and make sure that what ought to be hot is
E26  35 really hot and that everything looks, and is, fresh:
E26  36    |^Tea, hot water; milk and sugar (or coffee, hot*- but not boiled;
E26  37 milk and sugar). ^Toast, butter, marmalade. ^Fruit juice (pleasantly
E26  38 chilled), or grapefruit or stewed fruit and soft sugar. ^Main dish,
E26  39 salt, pepper, mustard; knife and fork, additional knife. ^Spoon for
E26  40 fruit, teaspoon, butter-knife (if the butter is not in pats), spoon
E26  41 for marmalade, knife for fresh fruit (if required).
E26  42    |^I have said nothing about flowers on the breakfast-tray*- a small
E26  43 attention sometimes recommended. ^My feeling is that there is rarely
E26  44 room to spare and one is worried about upsetting a vase, while a
E26  45 flower out of water fidgets me personally. ^I prefer flowers in the
E26  46 room and never miss them on the tray; but that's just a personal point
E26  47 of view.
E26  48    |^Some other considerations affecting this particular form of bliss
E26  49 are pillows and newspapers; an extra pillow or two, to prop one up,
E26  50 and at least two, if not more, morning papers will never come amiss to
E26  51 someone who is content to have breakfast in bed.
E26  52    |^The scope of downstairs breakfast*- porridge, cereals, cold game,
E26  53 ham and a wide selection of rolls, baps and different marmalades and
E26  54 honey*- is as wide as your purse can make it and I don't think I need
E26  55 enlarge on it here.
E26  56    |^Many older people and quite a few of the young settle for coffee
E26  57 or tea and toast and fruit juice. ^Although there are points to be
E26  58 observed in the preparation of even so simple a repast it is hardly
E26  59 worth the name of breakfast. ^A good old-fashioned breakfast*- and
E26  60 really good breakfast dishes are among the most pleasing forms of
E26  61 food*- is appreciated by the energetic, as a prelude to a day's
E26  62 walking or climbing or fishing in the holidays, or as a good basis for
E26  63 a day of hard work; even on Sunday it is something to sustain you for
E26  64 perusal of the newspapers, though not the best aid to keeping awake
E26  65 during a long sermon.
E26  66    |^I feel that I cannot let this chapter go without saying, briefly,
E26  67 something about the reverse side of the coin*- that is to say, *1being
E26  68 a good guest.
E26  69    |^*0However much your friends love you, you can add to their
E26  70 pleasure in having you to stay if you observe the small courtesies.
E26  71 ^At the risk of sounding a bit arbitrary I am making a few
E26  72 suggestions. ^If you are going to arrive at a later hour than was
E26  73 intended, remember to telephone, and if you are going to be late for a
E26  74 meal, suggest that it might be more convenient if you had this at home
E26  75 or on the way before arrival. ^Don't smoke in the bathroom; don't jump
E26  76 out of the bath, toes and body dripping and soaking the bath-mat, do a
E26  77 bit of preliminary mopping up before you get out. ^Open the window
E26  78 before you leave. ^Be quick on the uptake about the wishes of your
E26  79 hostess. ^If she has little or no domestic aid, offer to help; if she
E26  80 indicates that she does not at the moment need this, go off on your
E26  81 own with a book or needle-work, so that she is not left with the
E26  82 feeling that she ought to be entertaining you.
E26  83    |^Quite a few of you have asked about tipping, and in these days of
E26  84 what might be called unconventional help problems about tips can
E26  85 arise. ^A nice old-fashioned housemaid, labelled by cap and apron, is
E26  86 easy enough; when you leave you will give her your little present as
E26  87 you thank her for looking after you. ^It is the *'lady who obliges**'
E26  88 that can confound you; on that point, the simplest way is to quietly
E26  89 consult your hostess. ^In the old days a young woman was not expected
E26  90 to tip men servants; nowadays if a chauffeur meets you and takes you
E26  91 to the station, you will want to show appreciation. ^The question of
E26  92 *'how much**' is too difficult, depending as it does on the length of
E26  93 your stay, your purse and the help and service you receive. ^My own
E26  94 opinion is that the manner of giving is more important, and a young
E26  95 thing who remembers to say thank you in a friendly way need not worry
E26  96 if she cannot manage great largesse.
E26  97    |^If it should unfortunately happen that you do not really enjoy
E26  98 your visit, are uncomfortable or do not like your fellow guests or the
E26  99 food, keep all this darkly under your hat and don't regale your
E26 100 friends and acquaintances with an unfavourable if amusing narrative of
E26 101 your stay; to do this is to offend against one of the canons of decent
E26 102 behaviour, however funny you may make the tale. ^Quite apart from the
E26 103 bad manners of this you may be pretty sure that your hostess will come
E26 104 to hear of it and then you will have been guilty of causing great
E26 105 hurt.
E26 106    |^As one greatly prejudiced may I say a word about noise? ^Young
E26 107 people of the present generation have conditioned themselves to what
E26 108 is sometimes called background noise, and can carry on conversations,
E26 109 read and play games against a radio programme*- even against two from
E26 110 different stations, without apparent inconvenience. ^Maybe it was the
E26 111 early training which expected a complete cessation of noise of any
E26 112 kind when music was being performed, that causes me and others like me
E26 113 to find it quite impossible to talk or listen when there is
E26 114 *'background noise**'. ^To be a little considerate about radios and
E26 115 gramophones and noise generally is rated highly among good manners.
E26 116    |^I must tell you here something amusing that happened not long ago
E26 117 at Winkfield. ^Charles Laughton came to spend part of a day with me.
E26 118 ^After dinner he read to us one or two passages from *1A Midsummer
E26 119 Night's Dream *0and he rendered some of the parts*- that of Bottom in
E26 120 particular*- with bucolic overtones. ^My sitting-room is opposite two
E26 121 dormitory cottages, where all was plainly to be heard. ^Later on when
E26 122 he had gone, the night nurse, who goes the rounds about eleven
E26 123 o'clock, heard a radio still on in a dormitory. ^She asked the girls
E26 124 there to turn the radio off, saying that they were disturbing me as I
E26 125 was tired and had gone to bed early*- to which she got the
E26 126 disconcerting reply: ^*'Don't be silly, Nurse, she's been having
E26 127 dinner with Henry the Eighth.**'
E26 128 *<*56*>
E26 129 *<Afternoon Tea*>
E26 130    |^*2LIKE BREAKFAST, *0this almost calls for special pleading. ^One
E26 131 hears it said that nobody ever eats at tea time now, except on railway
E26 132 trains and then only to kill time. ^But my mind wanders to holidays in
E26 133 Scotland or to Devonshire and leisurely teas. ^And then, when one
E26 134 thinks of an autumn evening, how good seems the idea of hot buttered
E26 135 toast or crumpets and comforting slices of cake; how welcome they can
E26 136 be to those who have returned from a day's shooting, hunting, golf,
E26 137 football*- whatever strenuous pursuit you like. ^I don't think
E26 138 afternoon tea has so far gone out of fashion that a good hostess can
E26 139 afford not to give it some thought.
E26 140    |^As cooks we won't concern ourselves with the four-o'clock repast
E26 141 of a cup of China tea and lemon, just possibly a wafer of thin bread
E26 142 and butter and a mere dismissing glance at the cake. ^We will leave
E26 143 this fashion aside and direct our attention to the question of
E26 144 substantial teas for hungry and even exhausted people, because such
E26 145 meals engage at least our culinary interest. ^We may not have many
E26 146 opportunities to test our skill but when they do come along we shall
E26 147 know what is expected of us.
E26 148    |^Tea, as a beverage, varies greatly in flavour according to the
E26 149 water with which it is made. ^Unless you are lucky and have hit at
E26 150 once on a blend that suits the neighbourhood in which you live, you
E26 151 should consult a good tea merchant and get the matter satisfactorily
E26 152 settled once and for all. ^This applies to both Indian and China teas.
E26 153 ^If of the latter you like a *'smoky**' blend, mention the fact when
E26 154 you ask advice. ^I do not know how unorthodox it may be, but I like to
E26 155 keep a piece of dried orange-peel in the caddy containing China tea;
E26 156 purists may howl, but try it for yourself.
E26 157    |^Of course everyone knows about hot teapots and really boiling
E26 158 water, about using freshly run water in the first place and not
E26 159 letting it boil too long in the kettle, nevertheless these minutiae
E26 160 are not always properly observed; perhaps the teapot gets heated with
E26 161 hot water, but is not subsequently completely emptied, and a nice
E26 162 little pool of tepid water receives the tea; the water in the kettle,
E26 163 steaming away in a moment of pre-boiling enthusiasm, is poured over
E26 164 the tea a second or two too early*- so the tea is horrid. ^Believe me,
E26 165 this is not a lot of fuss and nonsense; the reason you hear people say
E26 166 *'few people make really good tea**' is because this *'nonsense**' is
E26 167 underrated.
E26 168    |^Cream is not always offered with tea, as once it was: it was
E26 169 usually handed separately and added to the tea in the cup. ^When this
E26 170 was the fashion the cups were often warmed with a little hot water to
E26 171 prevent them from cracking, as they sometimes do when filled straight
E26 172 with hot tea. ^The water was of course poured away into a tea basin.
E26 173 ^Milk is a different affair; if you add milk to the tea in the cup you
E26 174 can get a rather *'raw**' taste difficult to describe; if you put it

E27   2 *<*4The Renovation of Shiplake Lock in Oxfordshire*>
E27   3    |^T*2HE *0original lock at Shiplake dates from 1787 and was a pound
E27   4 lock. ^The present lock, which has now been extensively overhauled by
E27   5 the Thames Conservancy, was built in 1874. ^The lock has an overall
E27   6 length from gate to gate of 133\0ft 4\0in, a width between rubbing
E27   7 strips of 18\0ft 3\0in, and an original depth over the head cill of
E27   8 6\0ft 5\0in, and 5\0ft 6\0in at the tail*- this latter depth now being
E27   9 increased to 6\0ft 3\0in. ^The lock is situated about three miles from
E27  10 Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.
E27  11    |^The cills of the original lock, which have now been replaced,
E27  12 consisted of timber baulks spiked on a bed of heavy sleepers. ^This
E27  13 lock is of interest in that the quoins or corner pieces are not shaped
E27  14 to accommodate the heel post of the gate, but are square in section,
E27  15 the heel posts being hung on pintles set in front of the quoins and
E27  16 secured to them by iron collar straps at the top. ^A water seal is
E27  17 made between the heel post and the wall by means of a mitre board. ^In
E27  18 the renovated lock a strip of *"Linatex**" rubber has been
E27  19 incorporated in the edge of the mitre board to improve the seal. ^In
E27  20 common with many locks of early date, no hard floor was provided
E27  21 between the mass concrete lock walls, although timber baulks of
E27  22 substantial section were set in the earth floor to act as struts
E27  23 between the bases of the walls.
E27  24    |^Renovation, which entailed closure of the river to traffic, took
E27  25 place between October 31 last and February 6 this year. ^The need for
E27  26 a major overhaul was brought about by the deterioration of a number of
E27  27 factors. ^The first of these was the tilting of the headgate pintles
E27  28 which were progressively moving out of true alignment as the timber
E27  29 sleepers under the cill deteriorated. ^This caused jamming between the
E27  30 pintle casting and the heelpost shoe casting, a situation which
E27  31 required removal of these components on two occasions for machining.
E27  32 ^This was, however, a palliative, the effect of which was lost with
E27  33 continued settling of the pintles. ^Considerable leakage was also
E27  34 taking place under the timber sleepers and through lift construction
E27  35 joints in the cill wall, thus impairing the operation of the lock.
E27  36 ^The timber cills were also worn on their surfaces, in addition to
E27  37 being decayed, and had been recapped several times to ensure a tight
E27  38 fit between them and the gates. ^Further causes of anxiety were the
E27  39 decayed state of the old timber baulks bracing the toe of the lock
E27  40 walls and the deterioration of the lock floor.
E27  41    |^The site preparations for lock repairs are normally governed by
E27  42 absence of road access to the site and, with the river closed, it is
E27  43 usually necessary to bring all materials and equipment including
E27  44 sufficient barges for transportation of broken stone to the site
E27  45 before the lock is sealed off. ^In this instance, road access was
E27  46 available at a point some 100 yards from the lock, but separated from
E27  47 it by a water meadow liable to recurrent flooding and by a 60\0ft wide
E27  48 leat which formed the water course to a mill which existed near the
E27  49 site in earlier times.
E27  50    |^The preparations thus commenced with the transport by barge and
E27  51 erection of a 3 ton Butters luffing derrick, which commanded the body
E27  52 of the lock with the exception of the gate recesses. ^This crane was
E27  53 supplemented by a Priestman Wolf crane fitted with a 40\0ft boom for
E27  54 service at these two points, this being augmented when necessary by a
E27  55 3 1/2 ton Grafton steam crane mounted on one of the barges. ^The
E27  56 concrete preparation plant consisted of a 15 ton Portasilo to which
E27  57 cement was delivered in bulk by the {0C.M.C.}, this unit being set
E27  58 up in conjunction with a Parker 14/10 mixer with weighbatcher and
E27  59 scraper unit. ^The batching and stockpile yard was located above the
E27  60 general flood level, on a levelled dump of Thames ballast by the road
E27  61 side. ^The aggregate and sand used for the works were Kennett gravels,
E27  62 derived from Hall & \0Co.'s pit at Theale.
E27  63    |^Type of conveyance of concrete from the batching plant to the
E27  64 lock was determined by the existence of waterlogged ground and a
E27  65 60\0ft wide leat, limited space on the lock side and the desirability
E27  66 of crossing the lock itself. ^Transportation was thus by means of a
E27  67 Road Machines Monorail system in which 12.5 {0cu.ft.} skips are
E27  68 driven by a 7 1/2 {0b.h.p.} motor and hydraulic drive. ^The skips
E27  69 are set in motion at the loading point and travel unattended until
E27  70 stopped automatically wherever a special stopping device is fitted in
E27  71 the rail. ^This was found to be particularly useful in that the rail
E27  72 was taken over the lock and along one side. ^A further section of rail
E27  73 was located on the other side of the lock and upon these rails was
E27  74 mounted a travelling bridge which traversed the lock length. ^A riser
E27  75 rail connected the main mono-rail system to a short length of curved
E27  76 rail on the bridge. ^Concrete was discharged from the skips, through
E27  77 openings in the floor of the carriage to a trunking system for the
E27  78 various sections of the work.
E27  79    |^Of particular importance in the scheme was the provision required
E27  80 to be made for a reliable drainage and pumping system. ^The work was
E27  81 carried out during the wet season, when high head and tail water
E27  82 conditions could be expected at the main cofferdams and when the
E27  83 ground water level would be close to surface. ^Experience on work at
E27  84 other locks had shown that the throttle settings of normal
E27  85 self-priming centrifugal pumps required constant attention to reduce
E27  86 the amount of time lost through the flooding of the workings. ^When
E27  87 pumping from a sump with a 22\0ft vertical suction it was found that
E27  88 with the setting too far advanced, or with a slackening of the inflow,
E27  89 the sump would be emptied and the suction lost and, whilst the priming
E27  90 was being regained, the water level would rapidly rise in the
E27  91 workings. ^Similar delays had been experienced when sudden inflows
E27  92 were encountered or when the pump speed fell for any reason. ^Such
E27  93 pumps also required to be set immediately over the lock, thus reducing
E27  94 the working space available. ^Past experience indicated that an inflow
E27  95 of up to 90,000 \0gall/ hour, might be reasonably expected and to
E27  96 allow for unforseen **[SIC**] contingencies, two Sykes 8\0in Univacs
E27  97 were installed to deal with twice this capacity. ^The use of these
E27  98 pumps enabled a horizontal as well as vertical suction to be used,
E27  99 enabling the pumps to be located well clear of the working area,
E27 100 whilst of greatest importance was the fact that the water level in the
E27 101 sump remained constant at the level of the flange on the base of the
E27 102 suction pipe. ^The pumps were arranged to deliver to the spillway of
E27 103 the old mill which served as a useful collecting launder for the
E27 104 gravel pumped out by the Univacs. ^The pumps were powered by Ruston &
E27 105 Hornsby 4 {0VHR} oil engines. ^Both pumps were used each morning for
E27 106 rapid dewatering. ^Thereafter one was sufficient to deal with seepage
E27 107 water. ^At a total head from all causes of about 30\0ft including a
E27 108 vertical lift of 22\0ft the inflow was well within the pump's capacity
E27 109 of about 90,000 \0gall/ hour at this duty and worked for much of the
E27 110 time *"on snore.**" ^Site lighting was provided by mains electricity
E27 111 to enable the pumps to be started up some 2 hours before the shift
E27 112 began, during which time the lock was emptied of some 210,000 gallons
E27 113 of water which accumulated during the night. ^A pump was also run for
E27 114 two hours after the shift had finished to enable the concrete to set.
E27 115    |^The operations started with the driving of the head and tail
E27 116 cofferdams, Larssen \0No. 2 piles being used at the tail*- where extra
E27 117 strength was required to accommodate the greater water pressure
E27 118 loading*- pitched by the Priestman crane and driven by a \0No. 5
E27 119 {0BSP} steam hammer. ^Number {0IU} Larssen piles were used for the
E27 120 head dam. ^At this dam, the pitching and driving were effected by the
E27 121 barge mounted Grafton steam crane. ^The bracing at the head dam
E27 122 consisted of 12\0in x 12\0in struts, braced off the wing walls of the
E27 123 dock. ^For the tail dam two 21\0in x 8 1/4\0in {0RSJ} 40\0ft long
E27 124 were used, strutted from sheet piling driven into either bank.
E27 125    |^Baulks of Douglas fir were then wedged into position at 15\0ft
E27 126 centres along the length of the lock, this spacing being arranged to
E27 127 coincide with the existing vertical rubbing strips of the lock. ^These
E27 128 baulks were set in two tiers, the lower tier being emplaced by diver
E27 129 whilst the lock was still full, each baulk being temporarily weighted
E27 130 with a length of Larssen piling.
E27 131    |^With the dams completed, the wall struts in place and the Univac
E27 132 pumps in position, the lock was pumped out, the suction line being
E27 133 placed in the tail recess of the lock. ^When the water had been taken
E27 134 down to within a few inches of the bottom, a 5\0ft \0dia, 6\0ft deep
E27 135 sump was excavated just upstream of the tail gate recess. ^This took
E27 136 place inside a box of trench sheeting, 5\0ft \0dia precast concrete
E27 137 tube sections being used to form the sump to a depth of 4\0ft below
E27 138 the formation level which allowed 1\0ft 6\0in below the invert of
E27 139 drainpipes to accommodate gravel, \0etc.
E27 140    |^This box sheeting was then extended up the length of the lock in
E27 141 the form of a 2\0ft wide trench in order to drain the head of the
E27 142 lock, the trench being filled with hard core over drain. ^Excavation
E27 143 of the floor of the lock followed up the completed hard core drain in
E27 144 15\0ft sections, the trench sheeting being removed and a 2\0ft thick
E27 145 mass concrete slab of 7.4:1 total aggregate cement ratio being
E27 146 emplaced to within 3\0ft of each wall. ^On completion of the floor,
E27 147 the remaining 3\0ft strip at the base of the walls was removed and any
E27 148 over excavation under the walls filled with concrete and underpinned
E27 149 2\0ft 6\0in back, the last stage being the emplacement of a 30 \0deg
E27 150 batter to the walls.
E27 151    |^The drain was thus covered over. ^Its function during the works
E27 152 was to drain both the head and tail dams, the Univac holding the water
E27 153 level permanently at the level of the soffit. ^On completion all sumps
E27 154 were concreted, sealing the underdrainage system.
E27 155    |^Whilst this work was in progress, other repairs were being
E27 156 effected at the head and tail of the lock, where new cills and groins
E27 157 were under construction. ^The new cills consist of 31.33 \0lb/ \0ft
E27 158 steel channels of 12\0in x 4\0in section, set out on new 2\0ft thick
E27 159 slabs, the channels being bolted down to their bases by Rawlbolts and
E27 160 secured to the step concrete behind by welded attachments to the
E27 161 channels.
E27 162    |^Repair of the lock walls consisted of cutting back the old face
E27 163 to a depth of some 2 1/2\0in with chipping hammers and then refacing
E27 164 with gunite to a depth of 2\0in over a {0B.R.C.} reinforcing fabric.
E27 165    |^New tail gates were fabricated in the Reading workshops and
E27 166 delivered by water. ^The new gates have three sluices to each gate,
E27 167 whilst the original head gates, which carried four sluices to each
E27 168 gate, were overhauled, these gates being only 7 to 8 years old. ^The
E27 169 paddles controlling the sluices have been converted to hydraulic
E27 170 operation, along with the gate movement.
E27 171    |^The hydraulic equipment for the control and operation of the two
E27 172 pairs of lock gates was required to be capable of being operated
E27 173 either under power by the lock keeper from local control pedestals
E27 174 located near each pair of gates or manually from the same pedestals by
E27 175 members of the general public, after the lock keeper's working hours.
E27 176    |^This requirement has been met by the provision of hydraulic power
E27 177 equipment in the lock house, this equipment supplying a pressure
E27 178 supply to the pedestals (which may, however, generate their own
E27 179 pressure supply by means of a handwheel operated transmitter).

E28   7 inhabitants, why should we not forget rental values and use, instead,

E28   9 forward in this article, supported by arguments based on the
E28  10 increasing difficulty and unreality of present methods and on
E28  11 advantages claimed for the alternative proposal.
E28  12    |
E28  13    |^I*2N 1601 *0the churchwardens and overseers of every parish were
E28  14 charged with the duty of setting the poor to work and of relieving
E28  15 those unable to work. ^To provide the wherewithal for the performance
E28  16 of this duty they were empowered to tax every inhabitant and occupier
E28  17 of lands.
E28  18 *<*1Rental Values*>
E28  19    |^*0It was not until 1836 that the basis of assessment was defined
E28  20 by statute. ^The Parochial Assessments Act of that year stated that
E28  21 all rates were to be based on the rent at which rateable hereditaments
E28  22 might reasonably be expected to let from year to year. ^This basis has
E28  23 continued to apply ever since, although some of the devices needed to
E28  24 achieve the desired end have amply justified the classification of the
E28  25 valuer's work as an art rather than as a science.
E28  26    |^Thus we have the *"contractor's theory,**" the *"profits
E28  27 basis**", and other tortuous methods which often appear to the
E28  28 uninitiated merely to provide a pseudo-scientific way of justifying
E28  29 valuations preconceived on more mundane bases.
E28  30    |^Nevertheless the number of cases in which assessments could not
E28  31 be related reasonably directly to factual rental evidence has so far
E28  32 not been so great as to render the whole system suspect, although
E28  33 since the war it has been found necessary to resort to 1939 values in
E28  34 order to maintain this position. ^Admittedly extensive rent control
E28  35 has severely limited the number of *"true**" rents available to the
E28  36 valuer, but the conception of the *"hypothetical tenant**" has enabled
E28  37 the limitations to be overcome.
E28  38 *<*1Immediate Problems*>
E28  39    |^*0The time has now arrived when 1939 values can have no possible
E28  40 relevance to those of the 1960s. ^If we are to have another
E28  41 revaluation, the problem must be faced of determining up-to-date
E28  42 values for dwellings as well as for non-residential properties.
E28  43 ^Especially is this so because over 86 per \0cent. of the rateable
E28  44 properties in England and Wales are dwellings.
E28  45    |^The extent of the problem is shown by the figures disclosed on
E28  46 February 23, 1959, during the second reading of the Rating and
E28  47 Valuation Bill which postponed the next revaluation until 1963:*-
E28  48 **[TABLE**]
E28  49    |^It was stated that, in order to undertake the work of revaluation
E28  50 with confidence, the Inland Revenue Valuation Office needed
E28  51 satisfactory rental evidence from a sample of 10 per \0cent. of the
E28  52 total dwellings. ^That percentage, it was thought, might be achieved
E28  53 in time for 1963. ^No doubt it will be in some areas and for some
E28  54 types of property, but the view would seem to be rather too sanguine
E28  55 so far as many areas are concerned*- for example where there is a
E28  56 large proportion of relatively modern houses.
E28  57    |^Whether this will prove to be the case is, however, only a matter
E28  58 of short-term interest. ^The important question is whether there will
E28  59 be sufficient rental evidence to enable any subsequent revaluations to
E28  60 be carried out. ^What are the prospects of this?
E28  61 *<*1Future Problems*>
E28  62    |^*0Since 1939 practically no new houses have been built for
E28  63 letting except by public bodies and the continuing growth of the
E28  64 building society movement, hampered though it has been by limited
E28  65 available funds, indicates that owner-occupation is what most people
E28  66 prefer (or are forced into). ^The February 1961 White Paper on
E28  67 *"Housing in England and Wales**" (\0Cmd. 1290) sums up the prospects
E28  68 when it says:*-
E28  69 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
E28  70    |^*"House purchase, stimulated by a higher average standard of
E28  71 living than this country has ever before enjoyed, and assisted
E28  72 financially by the House Purchase and Housing Act of 1959, is
E28  73 spreading rapidly, and the urge for home-ownership shows no sign of
E28  74 diminishing.**"
E28  75 **[END INDENTATION**]
E28  76    |^The Government's latest intention is to encourage the provision
E28  77 of more houses to let. ^The White Paper says:*-
E28  78 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
E28  79    |^*"As an experiment the Government propose to make arrangements
E28  80 under which money will be advanced to approved non-profit-making
E28  81 housing associations which are prepared to build houses to let at
E28  82 economic rents. ^They regard this as essentially a pump-priming
E28  83 operation and hope that it will serve to show the way to the
E28  84 investment of private capital once again in building houses to let.**"
E28  85 **[END INDENTATION**]
E28  86    |^The first part of this idea will no doubt encourage
E28  87 non-profit-making enterprises to produce some houses to let, but the
E28  88 rents to be charged, as in the case of rents of local authority
E28  89 houses, are unlikely to provide an appropriate basis for rating
E28  90 assessments. ^If there is no profit motive on the part of the landlord
E28  91 such rents cannot be expected to equal *"the figure at which the
E28  92 hypothetical landlord and tenant would... come to terms... as a result
E28  93 of *"the higgling of the market**'.**" ^(*1Robinson Case, *01937.)
E28  94    |^As a *"pump-priming**" operation the potential of the
E28  95 Government's proposals is more uncertain. ^No doubt the relaxation of
E28  96 rent restrictions will to some extent encourage the building of houses
E28  97 to let although, for many reasons, the old idea of investing one's
E28  98 money in this sort of security is, and will probably remain,
E28  99 unfashionable. ^The present trend is towards owner-occupied dwellings,
E28 100 leaving only local authorities and non-profit-making associations to
E28 101 provide for those unable or unwilling to buy their own houses.
E28 102    |^If the trend continues the time must come when the remnant of
E28 103 privately let houses will be insufficient to provide a basis for
E28 104 ascertaining standards of rents such as are needed to assess rateable
E28 105 values which comply with the existing definition. ^It seems reasonable
E28 106 to suppose that the stage will soon be reached at which only flats and
E28 107 a minority of smaller houses will provide any acceptable rental
E28 108 evidence. ^Even in the rents of these properties a *"scarcity**"
E28 109 element must be expected.
E28 110    |^Whatever criticisms may be levelled against rating as the means
E28 111 of local taxation no better alternative has so far found general
E28 112 acceptance. ^If local government is to retain any semblance of
E28 113 autonomy (and as a bulwark of democracy this must surely be necessary)
E28 114 it must have its own independent source of locally based income.
E28 115 ^Without exploring the wide realms of argument on this subject, it is
E28 116 probably fair to say that the majority of informed people would agree
E28 117 with \0Mrs. Hicks who, in her *"Public Finance,**" said that ~*"In
E28 118 principle... a tax on land and buildings (which is by far the most
E28 119 common of all local taxes) has much to commend it.**" ^Unless in the
E28 120 future we are to rely on assessments of a purely arbitrary nature
E28 121 (which will inevitably bring the system into even greater disrepute)
E28 122 we must find some way out of the apparent impasse.
E28 123 *<*1A Solution*>
E28 124    |^*0An abortive attempt was made to meet the difficulty in the
E28 125 Local Government Act, 1948, when it was proposed to ascertain the
E28 126 *"rental values**" of most post-1918 houses by taking 5 per \0cent. of
E28 127 the hypothetical 1938 cost of construction, plus 5 per \0cent. of site
E28 128 costs. ^This proposal courted almost certain failure for two
E28 129 reasons:*-
E28 130    |(1) Its arbitrary nature;
E28 131    |(2) the different treatment accorded to other classes of dwellings
E28 132 and properties.
E28 133    |^But why must we strive to ascertain some illusory rental value
E28 134 when, in the market, such rental value is rarely to be found? ^If we
E28 135 want to retain a value of land and buildings as the criterion by which
E28 136 local expenditure is apportioned amongst the local inhabitants, why
E28 137 should we not forget rental values and use, instead, capital values?
E28 138 ^These are obviously much more easily ascertainable because the sales
E28 139 market is so much more active than the lettings market. ^Would it not
E28 140 be a relatively simple matter (compared with the present dubious
E28 141 antics) to arrive at the price at which a hereditament might
E28 142 reasonably be expected to sell with vacant possession in the open
E28 143 market if it were reasonably maintained and intended to be used for
E28 144 its present purposes?
E28 145 *<*1Not a Site Value Tax*>
E28 146    |^*0Such a proposal should not be confused with the rating of site
E28 147 values, a subject which appears to have become entangled with other
E28 148 considerations. ^The suggestion now made need have no party political
E28 149 implications because it need not affect the incidence of local
E28 150 taxation as between occupiers and owners. ^Unoccupied sites could be
E28 151 exempt, partially exempt or wholly chargeable*- these are questions
E28 152 irrelevant to the main idea.
E28 153    |^The suggested capital values would be simpler to ascertain than
E28 154 site values because the question of apportioning an aggregate value
E28 155 between the site and the building would not arise. ^Further, we are
E28 156 talking about the selling price, a factor understood by everybody, and
E28 157 not some notional apportionment of it. ^The authors of both the
E28 158 majority and the minority reports of the Committee of Inquiry into the
E28 159 Rating of Site Values (1952) seem to have been obsessed by the idea of
E28 160 *1annual *0rental value, for both reports speak of *"the annual site
E28 161 value**" ({0i.e.} the yearly rent which the site might be expected
E28 162 to yield if let at the valuation date upon a perpetual tenure).
E28 163 *<*1Not a Capital Levy*>
E28 164    |^*0Although assessments would be based on capital values, the rate
E28 165 would not be a tax on capital because the liability would not be met
E28 166 out of capital. ^Nor would it fall on, or be passed on to, the owner
E28 167 of the capital if he were not also the occupier, any more than do
E28 168 present rates. ^All that is suggested is that capital instead of
E28 169 annual values should be used as the measure of each ratepayer's
E28 170 contribution.
E28 171 *<*1Advantages*>
E28 172    |^*0A minor advantage of such a basis of assessment would be a
E28 173 psychological one*- the rate in the pound payable, instead of being
E28 174 the frightening figure of over 20\0s. in the *+, would be reduced to a
E28 175 few pence in the *+.
E28 176    |^Another advantage would be that the *"contractor's test,**" the
E28 177 *"profits basis**" and the other hypotheses now forced on valuers
E28 178 would cease to be needed.
E28 179    |^From a ratepayer's point of view, he would have some solid facts
E28 180 more readily available to enable him to contest an assessment. ^He
E28 181 could get a fair idea of the worth of his house by looking in the
E28 182 estate agents' windows. ^Where can he possibly obtain any convincing
E28 183 data about his rental value now?
E28 184    |^Although some shift in the burden between the occupiers of
E28 185 different types of property may result, this would be no greater, and
E28 186 conceiveably **[SIC**] it would be smaller, than that to be faced in
E28 187 bringing rent-based values up to date. ^Ratepayers would certainly be
E28 188 able to understand their assessments more clearly than those based on
E28 189 mythical rents and, as a result, would be better able to appreciate
E28 190 the soundness of those assessments.
E28 191    |
E28 192    |^Some change must come. ^Hand-to-mouth methods of making the
E28 193 present system rumble along cannot be perpetuated. ^The surprising
E28 194 thing is that successive Governments have been content to manipulate
E28 195 an impossible system for so long.
E28 196    |^It is seriously suggested that the method proposed might provide
E28 197 the solution.
E28 198 *<*6LONDON'S PURE WATER*>
E28 199    |^*0Bacterial analysis has shown that during the year 1960 the
E28 200 water for which the Metropolitan Water Board was responsible was
E28 201 virtually free from {*1escherichia coli}, *0the chief indication of
E28 202 faecal pollution.
E28 203    |^A report by the Water Examination Committee of the Board states
E28 204 that 99.97 per \0cent. of the samples passing into the distribution
E28 205 system during the year were free from this organism.
E28 206    |^These are the best results ever achieved by the Board. ^During
E28 207 nine of the twelve months, moreover, the water supplied by the Board
E28 208 was of 100 per \0cent. purity so far as this test was concerned.

E29   2 *<*5Twenty-First Annual Sale*>
E29   3 *<Gill's Growingly-Popular Event*>
E29   4    |^*2JOHN \0H. *0Gill & Sons (Leeming Bar), \0Ltd., Leeming Bar,
E29   5 Northallerton, \0Yorks., recently celebrated their 21st annual sale of
E29   6 second-hand machinery. ^To mark the event a dinner dance was held at
E29   7 the Scotch Corner Hotel and upwards of 200 farmers, friends, and staff
E29   8 were present.
E29   9    |^While it was a second-hand machinery sale that was celebrated,
E29  10 the main feature in the ballroom was a new Massey-Ferguson tractor,
E29  11 which shone quite brilliantly under the spotlight. ^We understand
E29  12 that, while it excited much attention, it did not intrude in any way
E29  13 on the dancing.
E29  14    |^\0Mr. John \0H. Gill, the founder of the firm, together with his
E29  15 sons, \0Messrs. John Arthur, Robert William, and Frank (who are all in
E29  16 the business), were, naturally, much in demand, as was \0Mr. John
E29  17 Sterne, of York, the Massey-Ferguson area manager.
E29  18    |^The highest price obtained at the sale itself was *+1,000 for a
E29  19 combine, while a tractor sold for *+400. ^We are informed that these
E29  20 sales are proving growingly successful, there being four times as much
E29  21 machinery at this last one compared with the first.

E29  32 division of the Ford Motor \0Co., \0Ltd., Dagenham, Essex, took place
E29  33 recently. ^The sales operations manager of the tractor division, \0Mr.

E29  37    |^This Scottish company has been actively engaged in the tractor
E29  38 business since 1924, but its history goes back into the 18th century.
E29  39 ^The trading area served is one of small, well-managed farms, largely
E29  40 specialising in milk production and growing early potatoes. ^Both
E29  41 directors believe in the closest personal contact with their
E29  42 customers. ^A large proportion of their business is conducted weekly
E29  43 at premises in Ayr's busy market.
E29  44 *<*5Lively Interest in Irrigation*>
E29  45 *<At Aberdeen Conference*>
E29  46    |^*2A ONE-DAY *0conference on irrigation, with the emphasis on
E29  47 organic irrigation, held at Westertown, \0nr. Aberdeen, on May 11th,
E29  48 drew an attendance of over 600 people. ^It was sponsored by Farrow &
E29  49 Sons, \0Ltd., Spalding, \0Lincs., and organised by Barclay, Ross &
E29  50 Hutchinson, \0Ltd., of Aberdeen.
E29  51    |^Undoubtedly, a factor contributing largely to the success of the
E29  52 conference was that it was held on the farm of \0Mr. Maitland Mackie,
E29  53 \0Jun., where a complete organic irrigation system is installed as
E29  54 part of a large-scale slatted floor arrangement for dairy and beef
E29  55 herds.
E29  56    |^The first of the speakers, \0Mr. Gordon Newman, manager of
E29  57 Reading University farm, confined his comments mainly to water
E29  58 irrigation. ^He emphasised the importance of trying to anticipate
E29  59 *"irrigation need,**" aired the view that in parts of Scotland
E29  60 irrigation is not an economic proposition, and roundly declared that
E29  61 *"irrigation is no excuse for poor cultivations and inadequate
E29  62 manuring.**"
E29  63    |^\0Mr. Trevor Garbett, general manager of Farrow & Sons, \0Ltd.,
E29  64 put the case for organic irrigation and naturally pointed to the
E29  65 *"object lessons**" to be learned from \0Mr. Mackie's installation.
E29  66 ^He claimed that organic irrigation fitted in with slatted floors, and
E29  67 went on to say that poultry houses, especially batteries, *"presented
E29  68 no problem.**" ^He added that *"sheep stored on slats are treated the
E29  69 same as cattle on slats.**"
E29  70    |^Another point advanced by \0Mr. Garbett was that his firm
E29  71 recommended the use of a piston pump for organic irrigation, although
E29  72 under certain circumstances a centrifugal pump might do the job.
E29  73 ^Although with a piston pump, it was necessary to be fairly careful
E29  74 about what went into the pit, a great deal more could go in with
E29  75 *"little chance of any harm to the system**" than could be allowed
E29  76 with a centrifugal pump.
E29  77    |^The economics of organic and water irrigation systems*- always an
E29  78 important matter*- were presented by \0Mr. John Nix, of Cambridge
E29  79 University School of Agriculture. ^He acknowledged that the basic
E29  80 costs of organic irrigation could be *"fairly high,**" but stressed
E29  81 the economic benefits derived in the way of manurial value and labour
E29  82 saving.
E29  83    |^Practical experience over the last two years with an organic
E29  84 irrigation system in the West Country, {0*1i.e.}, *0at Ilminster,
E29  85 Somerset, was given by \0Mr. David Hawthorne. ^He believed the system
E29  86 to be worthwhile because it got rid of the slurry, avoided wheel
E29  87 damage to the land, prevented river pollution, stopped the *"awful
E29  88 waste**" of nutrients, and thus enabled the farm to keep up a good
E29  89 level of production.
E29  90    |^The final word*- an important one*- came from \0Mr. David Soutar,
E29  91 farm buildings adviser at the North of Scotland College. ^He urged
E29  92 that farmers should adopt a more progressive and positive attitude
E29  93 towards buildings in order to derive full advantage of the *"many new
E29  94 technical developments now being designed.**" ^But, \0Mr. Soutar
E29  95 added, *"economy in labour in farm buildings is far less likely to be
E29  96 achieved through planning than by 100 per \0cent. mechanisation,
E29  97 although the mass handling of stock and crop will continue to be
E29  98 developed, and the same basic principles of automation as now
E29  99 practised in industry will be adopted on the farm.**"
E29 100 *<*5Lundell *"605**"*>
E29 101 *<Latest *"Double-Chop**" Forage-Harvester*>
E29 102    |^*2IT *0is the snowballing interest in the mechanical feeding of
E29 103 livestock in various ways, mostly of American genesis, that lies
E29 104 behind the introduction of a new *"double-chop**" forage-harvester,
E29 105 demonstrated publicly for the first time on May 15th. ^The Lundell
E29 106 *"605**" off-set machine was originally shown by Lundell (Great
E29 107 Britain), \0Ltd., Edenbridge, Kent, at the last Smithfield Show
E29 108 (\0Dec., \0p. 1170), and is really the John Deere *"15A,**" which the
E29 109 British company is manufacturing under licence.
E29 110    |^We saw it at work in a fine crop of Italian rye grass/ *"\0H.1**"
E29 111 mixture, about 2\0ft. high, on \0Mr. {0A. S.} Cray's Southdown Farm,
E29 112 Medstead, \0nr. Alton, \0Hants. ^The two rows of 16 specially-designed
E29 113 *"grapefruit**" flail knives on the *"605**" took the grass cleanly at
E29 114 about 2\0in. above ground, the width of cut being 60\0in.
E29 115    |^From those knives the crop was whisked into a 12\0in. \0dia.
E29 116 auger, housed above the flails, and eventually proffered to the
E29 117 secondary cutting assembly*- which is also the fan.
E29 118    |^There are usually six cutting knives on this assembly, as on the
E29 119 present occasion, but three can be removed for coarser results. ^The
E29 120 length of the material varied from fragments of 1/2\0in. up to 4\0in.,
E29 121 and the average is said to be 2\0in. ^The power requirement is about
E29 122 the same as for the well-known *"Super 60**" machine, and a Fordson
E29 123 *"Dexta**" had no difficulty in second gear, although a larger tractor
E29 124 would be needed for the fastest speeds of work.
E29 125    |^At *+450, the price is *+55 up on the conventional flail machine.
E29 126 ^The shorter lengths of grass, however, allow easier handling by
E29 127 forage blowers, silo unloaders, auger feeders, side-unloading trailers
E29 128 and other associated equipment for the new techniques. ^But the
E29 129 material also handles well with a fore-loader, it is said, and has
E29 130 zero grazing possibilities as well.
E29 131    |^Haymaking and wilting can be provided for by bolting back a
E29 132 hinged section in the top of the auger housing. ^Consequently the crop
E29 133 flies straight over the auger and on to the field. ^\0Messrs. Lundell
E29 134 say they are working on a maize attachment, but it will probably not
E29 135 be ready until 1962.
E29 136    |^Co-operating in the demonstration were the local Lundell dealers,
E29 137 Hyde Abbey Motor Works, \0Ltd., Winchester. ^(Reply Card \0No. E.

E29 139 *<*4Massey-Ferguson Tractors with Foot-Pedal Direction Change*>
E29 140 *<Torque Converter Models Join Industrial Range*>
E29 141    |^*2CHANGING *0direction from forward to reverse purely by using
E29 142 the right foot is a feature of two of the tractors in the extended
E29 143 industrial range of Massey-Ferguson, \0Ltd., Coventry. ^This is done
E29 144 by combining *"shuttle transmissions**" with torque converters. ^There
E29 145 are altogether four new tractors and some other modifications and
E29 146 introductions.
E29 147    |^One of the innovations is a basic power unit, called the *"203**"
E29 148 tractor, on which the now established *"710**" digger and an improved
E29 149 *"702**" loader can be mounted. ^The *"203**" which succeeds the
E29 150 *"702**" tractor, incorporates the Perkins *"3-A-152**" diesel engine,
E29 151 with a maximum gross {0b.h.p.} of 38.4, and the transmission and
E29 152 back axle of the *"65**" tractor. ^A particular quality of the engine
E29 153 is said to be good lugging power at low \0revs. per \0min.*- a very
E29 154 necessary requirement of the construction industry. ^Torque
E29 155 characteristics are excellent and power steering is fitted as
E29 156 standard. ^This latter provision cuts down operator fatigue
E29 157 considerably.
E29 158    |^*"Topping-up**" is now much easier, for the regular points are
E29 159 accessible when the bonnet cover is lifted. ^There is a rugged
E29 160 11{0in.-dia.} dual clutch and the clutch assembly is
E29 161 self-ventilated. ^Transmission brakes of the disc variety operate
E29 162 together or independently, with complete sealing against dirt and
E29 163 water. ^Heavy cast wheels are employed instead of the previous steel
E29 164 disc ones. ^In spite of these improvements the price remains at *+880.
E29 165    |^When this basic unit is known as the *"205,**" the change of name
E29 166 indicates that it has both a torque converter and the *"instant
E29 167 reverse**" foot-operated direction change system. ^The *"instant
E29 168 reversing**" is actuated by an unusual accelerator, rather like a
E29 169 three-pronged fork, the centre prong being shorter than those outside,
E29 170 with a foot pedal at each extremity.
E29 171    |^Pressure on the right of the pedals, as they face the driver,
E29 172 produces forward motion, while if the reverse direction is required,
E29 173 the left pedal is depressed instead, at which the tractor instantly
E29 174 goes into reverse. ^Operating either side-pedal rotates, by a linkage
E29 175 device, a rocker valve, because of which oil from the control valve is
E29 176 directed to the clutch units in a *"shuttle transmission**" unit
E29 177 situated between the torque converter and a sliding mesh gear-box.
E29 178 ^The pedals act first as a clutch and then as a throttle.
E29 179    |^The centre pedal does not rotate the rocker valve. ^As a result,
E29 180 its only effect is to increase engine revolutions without vehicle
E29 181 motion in any direction. ^On this tractor there are two levers, each
E29 182 with two *"in-gear**" positions, providing 4 gears forward and
E29 183 reverse.
E29 184    |^Another tractor incorporating the torque converter and this novel
E29 185 transmission is the *"65R,**" one of the two new industrial versions
E29 186 of the *"65,**" the other being the *"65S.**" ^These have the
E29 187 *"4-A-203D**" Perkins engine and 58.3 gross maximum {0b.h.p.} ^While
E29 188 the *"65S**" with its more normal transmission has 6 forward gears and
E29 189 2 reverse, the *"65R,**" like the *"205,**" has 4 forward and reverse.
E29 190 ^Prices of these two versions make interesting comparison: the
E29 191 *"65S**" is *+950 \0ex works, complete with dual brakes, horn and
E29 192 mirror, while the *"65R**" is *+1,150 with the same accessories.
E29 193    |^Operating a tractor with the *"instant reverse**" facility is
E29 194 almost literally *"child's play.**" ^On any job requiring much
E29 195 stopping and starting*- such as loading shale*- it is a boon to have
E29 196 both hands free for the steering wheel and hydraulic loader, and the
E29 197 speed achieved by skilled operators is remarkable. ^The centre pedal
E29 198 can *"\0rev.**" the engine to increase the speed at which the bucket
E29 199 lifts. ^Brakes are on the side of the left foot and there is, of
E29 200 course, no clutch. ^*"Instant reversing**" has been in America for
E29 201 about three years, many applications being in road rolling.
E29 202    |^Another alteration in the range is that the hydraulics in the
E29 203 *"702**" loader are now of *"Cessna**" design and the break-away force
E29 204 consequently increases from 10,000 to 14,000\0lb. ^The American Cessna
E29 205 company is reported to be about to start production in Scotland, where
E29 206 it will assemble this hydraulic equipment. ^The side frames of the
E29 207 *"702**" bucket have also been modified to enable it to fit on to the
E29 208 *"203.**" ^There is a new weight attachment, which we saw fitted on
E29 209 the rear of the *"65R**"; it carries 15 iron weights of 122\0lb. each.
E29 210    |^A sub-soiling attachment, on which a cable-laying fixture can be
E29 211 bolted, is now available for the *"35S**" and *"35H**" industrial
E29 212 tractors, which are now painted yellow and grey.

E30   5    |They think group trading means a comfortable living for years*>
E30   6    |^\0M*2RS. ESTHER BEDDIS *0and her husband Roy are grocers on the
E30   7 Fairfield housing estate, near Fareham, Hampshire. ^They are
E30   8 enthusiastic members of Star Value Service.
E30   9    |^\0Mrs. Beddis is outspoken about group trading, but more
E30  10 outspoken about some of the retailers who are in a group and merely
E30  11 dabble with this form of trading.
E30  12    |^*"For some time,**" she says, *"I have been worried about the
E30  13 future of many independent retailers who have joined voluntary groups
E30  14 and, after a few months of membership, have been disappointed that
E30  15 increased turnover has not come to them. ^They have become discouraged
E30  16 with their lot and retailing in general and make no efforts to pull
E30  17 themselves out of this rut.
E30  18    |^*4*"This state exists because many independent grocers soon
E30  19 forget the reasons they joined a group*- and they forget their
E30  20 obligations. ^They seem to think that the trade owes them something
E30  21 because they have taken the first steps of joining a group; hanging an
E30  22 illuminated sign in their window (very rarely illuminated after dark)
E30  23 and spasmodically slap various bills on their windows announcing
E30  24 special offers.
E30  25 *<*5Pipe Dreams*>
E30  26    |^*0All this, they think, will double their turnover in a few
E30  27 months so that they and their families can live in comfort in years to
E30  28 come. ^Many with such pipe dreams have already gone further downhill
E30  29 and, sometimes, out of business. ^The others have learned their lesson
E30  30 in time and are now doing well.**"
E30  31    |^To cite their own case, \0Mrs. Beddis told *1The Grocer *0of
E30  32 their experiences in this respect.
E30  33 *<*5Nothing Startling*>
E30  34    |^*0They took a small grocery shop on the housing estate back in
E30  35 1947. ^For many years they jogged along happily, without anything
E30  36 startling happening to their trade.
E30  37    |^To put it in her own words: ^*"We did not see any real change in
E30  38 the grocery world as nothing ever happened to change our trading
E30  39 progress.**"
E30  40    |^*4This idyllic state of affairs existed until March, 1960*- not
E30  41 so long ago*- when the couple began to notice that some of their
E30  42 customers were no longer coming in, but were making the 3\0d. bus ride
E30  43 into neighbouring Fareham and buying a week's groceries at the
E30  44 recently opened supermarkets and large multiples there.
E30  45    |^*0Then the co-operative store*- just two doors away from them*-
E30  46 started cutting prices and making many special offers.
E30  47    |^The Beddises' turnover dropped by *+280 a week and kept sliding.
E30  48    |^Fortunately, they decided quickly to do something about it and
E30  49 joined the buying group operated by William Avens and \0Co., the
E30  50 Portsmouth wholesalers. ^The company immediately advised them to
E30  51 change from counter service to self-selection. ^*"The cost of
E30  52 conversion,**" said \0Mrs. Beddis *"was negligible. ^We used the
E30  53 existing shelves and fixtures.**"
E30  54 *<*5Up Went Turnover*>
E30  55    |^*1Through the medium of better pricing and easier service
E30  56 turnover quickly rose by *+50.
E30  57    |^*4In November, 1960, they joined the Star Value Service group,
E30  58 formed in the Portsmouth area under William Avens*- by then a
E30  59 Misselbrook and Weston subsidiary. ^Immediately, special offers were
E30  60 started and they were given more assistance with ideas for efficient
E30  61 merchandising and profitable promotions. ^Even so, although business
E30  62 slowly increased and turnover steadily rose until it was around *+500
E30  63 by September this year, they still felt the need to enlarge the shop
E30  64 to display and sell to better advantage.
E30  65    |^*0This posed special problems concerning future prosperity.
E30  66 ^Would it be worth while expanding*- as to ascertain what lay ahead in
E30  67 relation to increased business was most difficult? ^They finally
E30  68 decided to go ahead.

E30  71 new section of over *0300 {0*1sq. ft.} was not to be the greatest
E30  72 expense. ^It was the new fixtures and fittings to fill this space that
E30  73 would be costly. ^But Roy Beddis solved this problem by building all
E30  74 the new sectional shelving, eight dump bins, and the large gondola
E30  75 from materials he bought for a total of *0*+50. ^*1The new
E30  76 self-service refrigerator cost *0*+200 *1and the alterations to the
E30  77 building cost *0*+1,000. ^*1All in all, total cost was *0*+1250.
E30  78 *<*5Up Curtain!*>
E30  79    |^*0After the painters had left, three of Avens' men put the
E30  80 finishing touches to the new shop, but all this time business was as
E30  81 usual with the alterations hidden by curtains. ^The curtains were
E30  82 drawn back on September 21 and the response was immediate. ^The first
E30  83 week's takings up to the present show an increase of *+100 per week*-
E30  84 making well over *+600 per week. ^When more money is available, \0Mr.
E30  85 and \0Mrs. Beddis will extend the shop even further and take in the
E30  86 present storeroom.
E30  87 *<*5*'We Must Take the Burden Out of Everyday Shopping**'*>
E30  88    |^*0*"As all retailers know,**" \0Mrs. Beddis goes on, *"customers
E30  89 don't come to look at a pretty shop. ^But a pretty shop does lend
E30  90 itself to cleanliness and brightness. ^Not only is it these two things
E30  91 that customers want, but they also want well-priced special offers and
E30  92 we private retailers must take the burden out of everyday shopping and
E30  93 make it as easy as we can for these shoppers in case we lose their
E30  94 custom.
E30  95 *<*5Direct Promotions*>
E30  96    |^*4*"One facet of in-store trading often overlooked,**" she goes
E30  97 on, *"is special promotions. ^Our wholesaler often arranges these for
E30  98 Star Value members and, in addition, the large manufacturers will
E30  99 often assist with a direct promotion. ^The first week in October, we
E30 100 ran the Brooke Bond Win-A-Toy Competition*- ideal for children living
E30 101 on the Fairfield Estate. ^\0Mr. Hawkins, the Brooke Bond \0rep., spent
E30 102 the entire week in the shop, and with attractive display material and
E30 103 toys attracting customers in, sales of tea trebled to over 150 \0lb.
E30 104 in one week.
E30 105    |^*0*"Isn't that an incentive to try nearly all the promotions that
E30 106 are offered*- whether they be soup, canned fruit, Christmas, or tea
E30 107 promotions? ^We retailers must team with our wholesaler or the
E30 108 manufacturer to grab the trade that is there. ^The tragic part is that
E30 109 so many don't bother to consider promotions and sometimes even regard
E30 110 special offers as a waste of time.
E30 111 *<*5A Negligible Expense*>
E30 112    |^*0*"Often group window signs are not lit at night even though
E30 113 all-night illumination costs only pennies. ^A large number of shops
E30 114 are still ugly, cluttered and dirty. ^Little wonder so many housewives
E30 115 will gladly pay bus fares of as much as 3\0s. to save only 3\0s. on
E30 116 their order and still not worry because they are dealing with clean,
E30 117 bright shops. ^(The Beddis' store is pictured right.)
E30 118 **[ILLUSTRATION**]
E30 119    |^*"Perhaps I have been fortunate in having a father who was a
E30 120 wholesale confectioner,**" \0Mrs. Beddis continued, *"and having been
E30 121 in the grocery business since I left school. ^But experience is not
E30 122 enough these days, and many successful retailers with no grocery
E30 123 experience are prospering for the simple reason they have grasped
E30 124 every opportunity to draw customers into their shops and once those
E30 125 customers have come, then they have been sold goods at attractive
E30 126 prices from a clean, bright shop and by enterprising grocers who are
E30 127 good salesmen.

E30 133    |^T*2HE *0market and prospects for baby foods have again come under
E30 134 the scrutiny of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which is responsible
E30 135 for so much contemporary research in many fields, not least those
E30 136 associated with the grocery trade.
E30 137    |^In December, 1959, {0EIU} in \0No. 22 of their publication
E30 138 *"Retail Business**" examined the market, and in the latest issue*-
E30 139 \0No. 44, October*- the research is brought up to date.
E30 140    |^The extracts which we are privileged to give below are but a
E30 141 small part of the whole, which should be examined closely by all who
E30 142 are concerned in the vital and growing market for baby foods.
E30 143    |^*"Retail Business**" may be had only from the Economist
E30 144 Intelligence Unit, 5 Bury-street, London, {0SW}1.
E30 145 *<*6SIZE OF THE MARKET*>
E30 146 *<*4Milk Products*>
E30 147    |^*0The major trend in this market says *"Retail Business,**" is
E30 148 the swing away from National Dried Milk towards proprietary products
E30 149 and there is clearly scope for considerable further expansion in the
E30 150 sales of branded dried milk. ^This trend was accelerated by an
E30 151 increase in price of the National product in April, 1957.
E30 152    |^It is apparent from the substantial sales of proprietary dried
E30 153 milk and the fact that uptake of welfare milk (liquid and dried) is
E30 154 very close to 100 per \0cent. that many mothers are taking welfare
E30 155 liquid milk and using it for the rest of the family while they feed
E30 156 their babies on proprietary dried milk.
E30 157    |^*4Glaxo Laboratories' Ostermilk *0and *4Cow and Gate *0infant
E30 158 milk food have been the main beneficiaries of the swing to branded
E30 159 products. ^These two brands dominate the market for proprietary dried
E30 160 milk of which they probably have some 45 per \0cent. each. ^The most
E30 161 important remaining brands are *4Trufood *0(made, like *4Cow and Gate,
E30 162 *0by a member of the *4Unigate Group) *0and *6SMA. ^*0The latter is a
E30 163 filled milk product, formulated to resemble human milk. ^The formula
E30 164 is owned by the *4Wyeth Research Laboratories, Philadelphia, *0and the
E30 165 product, which has been on the {0UK} market since 1956, is marketed
E30 166 here by *4John Wyeth and Brothers.
E30 167    |^*0The remaining 25 per \0cent. or so of bottle-fed babies are
E30 168 given either evaporated milk or boiled fresh milk... ^The total market
E30 169 for evaporated milk is worth some *+13 million a year and possibly
E30 170 only one per \0cent. of this is used for infant feeding. ^However,
E30 171 sales of evaporated milk for infant feeding are rising, and it is
E30 172 impossible to ignore the fact that in North America this is the
E30 173 accepted food for bottle-fed babies...
E30 174    |^A major marketing problem confronting the processors of
E30 175 evaporated milk is that, as the market for their product as a general
E30 176 purpose food is so much more important at present than sales for
E30 177 infant feeding, they are wary of damaging the family image of their
E30 178 product by promoting it too heavily as an infant food. ^As a result,
E30 179 sales of evaporated milk as an infant food are likely to expand only
E30 180 very gradually.
E30 181    |^The largest brands of evaporated milk are *4Carnation (General
E30 182 Milk Products), Libby, Ideal (Nestle*?2) *0and *4Regal (Unigate).
E30 183 ^General Milk Products *0have pioneered the use of evaporated milk for
E30 184 infant feeding in this country and they claim that *4Carnation *0milk
E30 185 accounts for virtually all the sales in this market. ^*4Carnation
E30 186 *0has been available in the {0UK} since 1946, but the main marketing
E30 187 effort dates only from 1954 with the removal of restrictions on sales.
E30 188 *<*6WEANING CEREALS*>
E30 189    |^*0It is estimated that some 9.6 thousand tons of infant cereals
E30 190 are consumed a year and the retail value of the market is *+2.8
E30 191 million... ^The scope for expansion in the future seems more limited:
E30 192 it will come mainly from the continuing rise in the birth rate and
E30 193 possibly also from persuading mothers to keep babies on these
E30 194 specially fortified cereals longer in life.
E30 195    |^The leading brands in this market are *4Farley's Rusks *0(made by
E30 196 *4Farley's Infant Food), *0with possibly one-third of the total
E30 197 turnover, and *4Farex *0(made by *4Glaxo Laboratories) *0with between
E30 198 one-third and one-quarter of the total sales. ^The next most important
E30 199 brands, in order, are the range of cereals produced by *4Robinsons
E30 200 *0(a member of the *4Colman *0group), including mixed cereal, rice, a
E30 201 triple pack, groats and barley, and those produced by *4Scott's *0(a
E30 202 member of the *4Cerebos *0group). ^Other brands include *4Cow and
E30 203 Gate, Trufood *0and *4Ovaltine Chuckles.
E30 204    |^*0The products above represent three different approaches to the
E30 205 infant cereal market, and in each sector of this market one brand is
E30 206 dominant. ^*4Farley's *0have a very strong hold on the market for a
E30 207 weaning cereal in rusk form, quick and convenient to use. ^*4Glaxo's
E30 208 Farex *0dominates the market for a blended and fortified cereal,
E30 209 designed primarily to provide a sound nutritional basis for the baby's
E30 210 diet. ^*4Robinson's *0products, of which *4Baby Rise *0is one of the
E30 211 most successful, provide variety in flavour and texture for the child.

E31   2 *<*5Sole {Bonne Femme}, Slimy Fish, and Ballet of Waiters!*>
E31   3    |^*0Which was the more important*- sole {bonne femme} correctly
E31   4 served in a restaurant or slimy fish on a hospital trolley? ^Is the
E31   5 restaurant ballet of waiters really necessary? ^Surely a good case
E31   6 could be made out for a simpler form of service, as was being
E31   7 practised with success abroad?
E31   8    |^These pertinent questions and points of view were put forward by
E31   9 Miss \0E. Hollings, principal of Manchester Domestic and Trades
E31  10 College, when she welcomed about 100 delegates to the first one-day
E31  11 conference in the north of England of the Catering Teachers'
E31  12 Association, at Manchester.
E31  13    |^First rate catering schools and colleges encourage students of a
E31  14 higher educational standard to consider the catering industry as a
E31  15 worthwhile career, she said. ^But salaries paid in the catering
E31  16 industry were appallingly low, having regard to the many skills
E31  17 required. ^There were not sufficient of the right type of courses for
E31  18 caterers. ^She thought the hotel and restaurant industry put too much
E31  19 emphasis on the commercial aspects, such as foreign currency earning.
E31  20 *<*4Civilised Man*>
E31  21    |^*0Civilisation of man was closely associated with his search for
E31  22 food and was closely tied to agricultural science. ^It would not be
E31  23 surprising to see changes in catering to match the modern mood.
E31  24    |^\0Mr. \0L. Ambery (Manchester Domestic and Trades College)
E31  25 introduced a discussion on the teaching of general studies to catering
E31  26 students. ^He said that in technical education he thought not enough
E31  27 time was given to general subjects. ^Taking the country as a whole 80
E31  28 per cent of 15 year olds were receiving education but only 28 per cent
E31  29 of 19 year olds were receiving any form of education. ^It was
E31  30 important this last figure should be increased. ^In the last five
E31  31 years there had been a 70 per cent expansion in technical education.
E31  32    |^Present methods of induction of students were a nightmare. ^They
E31  33 were given no real guidance and were often pushed into classes that
E31  34 were not well suited to their purpose. ^There was need for closer
E31  35 liaison between the technical schools and the secondary modern schools
E31  36 and opportunity should be given for student interviews to ensure they
E31  37 were embarking on the technical courses which would serve them best in
E31  38 the future. ^There must also be a better staffing ratio*- 16 students
E31  39 to one teacher in a kitchen were too many, he considered.
E31  40    |^Preliminary courses should always include the practical approach
E31  41 to the subject, otherwise the students would regard them as *"just
E31  42 another school**" and soon lose interest.
E31  43    |^General subjects should always be related to the craft or
E31  44 vocational subjects. ^In too many cases these were taught in an
E31  45 atmosphere of splendid isolation. ^Too often twelve students were
E31  46 required to establish an evening class and as a result unsuitable
E31  47 candidates were accepted to make up the required number. ^Often only
E31  48 three of the twelve students passed the examination, the reason for
E31  49 the poor results being that the basic composition of the class was
E31  50 wrong in the first place.
E31  51 *<*4Science Subjects*>
E31  52    |^*0Miss \0A. Wordingham (in charge of applied science subjects at
E31  53 Domestic and Trades College) discussed the teaching of science
E31  54 subjects to catering students. ^So often, she said, students
E31  55 questioned the value of science lessons. ^The best way of holding the
E31  56 students' interest was to adopt the topic method. ^What was learned in
E31  57 the laboratory must be integrated in the kitchen. ^It was important
E31  58 that the science teacher should have taken a catering course just as
E31  59 much as the catering teacher should have taken an applied science
E31  60 course.
E31  61    |^The new syllabus for the City and Guilds 151 examination was
E31  62 reviewed from the examiners' viewpoint by Miss \0G. Smith (chief
E31  63 examiner).
E31  64    |^At question time several teachers suggested that City and Guilds
E31  65 examiners should attend a meeting or lecture in order to establish
E31  66 greater uniformity amongst examiners. ^In general discussion the
E31  67 question of provision of food for practical cooking tuition was
E31  68 raised. ^It was stated that more authorities were providing raw
E31  69 materials free, but there were still too many areas where students had
E31  70 to provide the food or where teachers had to collect money to pay for
E31  71 it.
E31  72    |^The conference was informed that the Catering Teachers'
E31  73 Association now has a membership of more than 300.
E31  74 *<*'*4Now is Time for Corporation to Pronounce Bold Plan for Town**'*>
E31  75    |^*4*"It is surely time that Southend Corporation pronounced a bold
E31  76 plan for this town to be in the forefront of seaside resorts, and not
E31  77 to quote what is becoming an old cliche*- *'that people now take their
E31  78 holidays abroad.**'
E31  79    |^*"*0We are quite fully aware that an ever-increasing number of
E31  80 the population go abroad for their holidays, but we are even more
E31  81 aware that an even greater proportion of the population take no
E31  82 holidays at all, and they are the untapped source which we should
E31  83 endeavour to attract.**"
E31  84    |^With these words, \0Mr. {0E. G. W.} Scott concludes his general
E31  85 secretary's report, to be presented at the annual general meeting of
E31  86 Southend, Westcliff-on-Sea and District Hotel and Catering Association
E31  87 on Monday next, October 30.
E31  88    |^The *"fight,**" which had been going on for the last 12 years to
E31  89 get Southend recognised as a seaside resort, was still proceeding, he
E31  90 comments. ^Membership had remained steady during that time, and even
E31  91 today they were able to accommodate a conference of 500-600 people in
E31  92 first class establishments in the town.
E31  93    |^It now appeared that the Cliffs Pavilion would open in 1963 after
E31  94 a long struggle*- something members now viewed with mixed feelings, as
E31  95 a large conference of over 1,000 delegates could not be accommodated
E31  96 in hotels.
E31  97    |^From returns sent in by members, it was revealed that 63,351
E31  98 visitors had stayed in the town from April to September, including an
E31  99 ever-increasing number of old aged pensioners. ^Illuminations still
E31 100 drew considerable numbers. ^Evidence was that period holiday visitors
E31 101 did not include a very high proportion of young people, no doubt due
E31 102 to a lack of entertainment, thinks \0Mr. Scott.
E31 103    |^*"During this current season we have had instances of visitors
E31 104 leaving their hotels earlier than the date to which they had booked,
E31 105 simply because they had seen all the films, been to the concert party
E31 106 and Palace Theatre, and there was nothing else to do.**"
E31 107    |^The Airport continued to produce an increasing number of
E31 108 one-night bookings.
E31 109    |^\0Mr. Scott feels that the British Hotels and Restaurants
E31 110 Association is now taking more interest in the affairs of the boarding
E31 111 house and small private hotel than formerly, and he pays tribute to
E31 112 the work of Miss {0D. E.} Cockrell on the South Eastern divisional
E31 113 committee and also for her publicity work.
E31 114    |^He thanks, too, \0Lt.-Col. {0E. G.} Petter, their president for
E31 115 the last three years, and reveals that the annual banquet on Tuesday,
E31 116 February 27, may take the form of a Belgian evening.
E31 117 *<*4Approval at Liverpool*>
E31 118    |^*0The first two stages of a three-tier plan by \0Mr. Charles
E31 119 Clore to redevelop at a cost of *+30 million a large area of the
E31 120 centre of Liverpool facing the waterfront has been approved in
E31 121 principle.
E31 122    |^The first two phases which may take between five and seven years
E31 123 to complete will consist of traffic-free shopping precincts,
E31 124 departmental stores, modern offices, and a multi-storey garage.
E31 125    |^The third phase, which originally included a luxury waterfront
E31 126 hotel, will be considered when the sites have been acquired.
E31 127 *<*4Northern {0H.C.I.} Dinner Told of New Hotel Plan*>
E31 128    |^*0The chairman of the northern branch of the Hotel and Catering
E31 129 Institute, \0Mr. John \0E. Dean, drew a statement from the Lord Mayor
E31 130 of Newcastle on the city's proposed hotel, when he proposed the toast
E31 131 of the guests at the branch's annual dinner-dance in the Royal Station
E31 132 Hotel, Newcastle.
E31 133    |^Winding up a witty speech, \0Mr. Dean complimented the Lord Mayor
E31 134 on the rapid development of the city. ^Its ever-changing skyline would
E31 135 soon include a new hotel, he hoped.
E31 136    |^Replying, the Lord Mayor, \0Dr. Henry Russell, said it was quite
E31 137 true the City Council had planned for a hotel. ^He did not think he
E31 138 would be revealing any secrets in saying it was to be at the corner of
E31 139 Eldon Place and Percy Street, a fine central site. ^It was hoped the
E31 140 hotel would provide an entirely new focus for that whole area.
E31 141    |^The Lord Mayor then went on to praise the high standard being
E31 142 attained by the caterers of Tyneside. ^He said the *"Geordie**" had
E31 143 always been recognised as a craftsman in shipbuilding and engineering,
E31 144 yet many people seemed to find it surprising that he was also a
E31 145 craftsman in cookery.
E31 146 *<*4Caterer's Initiative*>
E31 147    |^*0It was the caterers of Tyneside under \0Mr. Thomas Lonsdale
E31 148 (past chairman of the branch) who took the initiative in the
E31 149 establishment of a catering section in the Newcastle College of
E31 150 Further Education.
E31 151    |^*"I have had experience of the students' cooking there, and I
E31 152 feel quite sure they will make a great contribution to the industry
E31 153 when they graduate. ^It is a very worthwhile project.**"
E31 154    |^\0Mr. {0J. H.} Innes, principal of the College of Further
E31 155 Education, proposing the toast of the Institute, said it was a tragedy
E31 156 that so many industries today still maintained some of the worst
E31 157 aspects of the old apprenticeship system, and had lost so many of the
E31 158 good aspects.
E31 159    |^The National Joint Apprenticeship Council had given careful
E31 160 thought to the organisation of the craft apprenticeships. ^There was
E31 161 no need for long apprenticeship provided it was carefully organised.
E31 162    |^He congratulated the catering industry on being alive to this
E31 163 need. ^He wished more industries saw the necessity of careful
E31 164 selection of the duties and functions of the apprentice.
E31 165    |^The colleges must work with industry to try to get the best for
E31 166 the apprentice, to produce the best kind of craftsmanship.
E31 167    |^\0Mr. Innes said that in Newcastle the education authority was
E31 168 doing all it could to provide better education, but the college
E31 169 premises in Bath Lane were grossly inadequate. ^However, it was hoped
E31 170 to move into a fine new college in \0St. Mary's Place in about three
E31 171 years. ^That would give a great chance to develop many aspects of
E31 172 college work, particularly catering management.
E31 173    |^\0Mr. {0J. J.} Lanning, national secretary of the Institute,
E31 174 replying to the toast, said few industries were growing at such a rate
E31 175 as catering. ^Nevertheless, catering was an industry with some
E31 176 deficiencies. ^The greatest was that some employers did not yet
E31 177 realise the value of the training available in the technical colleges.
E31 178    |^Fortunately, the branch chairman and his committee were conscious
E31 179 of the fact and were doing all they could to remedy it. ^If there was
E31 180 to be development in the north-east, the hotel and catering industry
E31 181 could not be neglected, but the Institute needed the support of both
E31 182 the employers and the education authorities.
E31 183    |^Proposing the toast of the guests, \0Mr. Thomas Lonsdale, said
E31 184 the catering industry today required brains, but pointed out that the
E31 185 capacity to absorb technical knowledge differed from the hard realism
E31 186 of routine catering, which demanded not only brains and skill, but
E31 187 common sense and understanding of human nature as well as the highest
E31 188 possible degree of courtesy. ^The last factor could not be
E31 189 over-stressed in catering today.
E31 190    |^The recent tea-break strike highlighted the importance of the
E31 191 industry, but as far as he could recall there had never been a strike
E31 192 in the industry itself. ^*"We are rather proud of our classless
E31 193 profession,**" he added.
E31 194    |^\0Mr. \0A. Johnson, secretary of the Northern Advisory Council of
E31 195 Further Education, responded.
E31 196 *<*4Hotel College is {0U.N.O.} in Miniature*>
E31 197    |^*0That the post-diploma course in hotel management now offered at
E31 198 the hotel and catering section of Blackpool Technical College, is
E31 199 highly thought of is shown by the fact that two students have
E31 200 travelled thousands of miles to take advantage of it.
E31 201    |^Krishan Kuma Amla has a {0B.A.} degree from the University of

E32   3 *<*6ALL-ROUNDERS HAVE NO MONOPOLY IN BAD JUDGING*>
E32   4    |^T*2HERE *0is, perhaps, no need for me to join in the controversy
E32   5 over the appointment of judges for championship shows since Raymond
E32   6 Oppenheimer is doing very nicely on his own, thank you.
E32   7    |^But it is a subject on which I have expressed an opinion many
E32   8 times over the years so I could hardly keep out of it.
E32   9    |^Personally I think that the Shows Regulation Committee holds the
E32  10 view that because a championship show committee asks for a certain
E32  11 judge that judge is {6ipso facto} a suitable appointment whilst
E32  12 reserving the right, of course, to refuse the appointment for any
E32  13 reason of its own.
E32  14    |^That, to my mind is a basic and very grievous error. ^I could
E32  15 understand this point of view better if the {0SRC} were composed
E32  16 entirely of people who did not know the workings of show committees,
E32  17 but the present {0SRC} includes people who have quite intimate
E32  18 knowledge of the manner in which championship show judges are
E32  19 appointed (and of the way this varies according to the promoting club)
E32  20 so all one can think is that their voices are either not raised in
E32  21 protest or go unheeded.
E32  22    |
E32  23    |^*4M*2Y *0main point of difference with \0Mr Oppenheimer is that
E32  24 his present campaign is concerned with the appointment of unsuitable
E32  25 non-specialist judges whereas I am just as much concerned with the
E32  26 appointment of incapable specialist judges. ^I believe \0Mr.
E32  27 Oppenheimer shares that concern, but feels that the issue he has
E32  28 raised is sufficient at the moment to keep him fully occupied without
E32  29 widening it. ^Personally I hold the view that if anything is going to
E32  30 be done at all to revise the methods of selecting and approving judges
E32  31 then it might as well be all embracing.
E32  32    |^I do not want to stand up as champion of the all-rounders merely
E32  33 because I am, in fact, one of them, especially as I feel that the term
E32  34 *"all-rounder**" is applied much too loosely and made applicable to
E32  35 people who have just judged small shows and variety classes or best in
E32  36 show at championship shows whereas it should, strictly, be only
E32  37 applied to those judges who have demonstrated a working knowledge of
E32  38 all breeds and are acceptable to exhibitors in at least the large
E32  39 majority of breeds. ^Few of the people who are given the label of
E32  40 all-rounders could pass that test.
E32  41    |
E32  42    |^*4I *2FEEL *0obliged to support \0Mr Oppenheimer's contention
E32  43 that some all-rounders have insufficient experience of this breed, for
E32  44 good Bull Terriers, like good Alsatians and a number of other breeds
E32  45 are but rarely met with in variety classes at small shows and even
E32  46 when a breed class is scheduled the top dogs rarely go pot hunting.
E32  47    |^This being so, the opportunities for seeing the best of the breed
E32  48 (and therefore getting one's eye in) are limited.
E32  49    |^I suppose I judge as many shows as most people but I must confess
E32  50 that so far this year*- apart from when I have judged at \0Ch shows*-
E32  51 I have not come across more than a dozen Bull Terriers (possibly only
E32  52 half that number) and only one really top class specimen that I recall
E32  53 and that was in the best in show ring at *2WELKS *0where I left the
E32  54 best of breed Bull Terrier in the last few from which I made my final
E32  55 selection.
E32  56    |^So far as this goes therefore I agree with \0Mr. Oppenheimer that
E32  57 judges who are merely termed all-rounders because they have a limited
E32  58 experience of judging varieties cannot be regarded as fully equipped
E32  59 to award \0CCs in the breed.
E32  60    |
E32  61    |^*4A*2LL I *0want to say is that all-rounders (or if one prefers
E32  62 the term *"non-specialists**") have no monopoly of bad judging and it
E32  63 is, as I have said many times before, one of the faults of our system
E32  64 that a judge cannot be hauled over the coals and asked to explain his
E32  65 or her reasons for placings which cause widespread amazement in the
E32  66 same way that an official referee or umpire can be arraigned for
E32  67 decisions alleged to be bad.
E32  68    |^I have myself seen at least one amazing display of judging by a
E32  69 specialist judge in \0Mr. Oppenheimer's own breed where several very
E32  70 ordinary dogs and one which was really in the pet category were placed
E32  71 over the latest champion who had only just won his qualifying \0CC
E32  72 under \0Mr. Oppenheimer himself and was not unfit or lame or anything
E32  73 else apparent which accounted for his being ignored.
E32  74    |
E32  75    |^*4T*2HERE *0have been occasions when I have spoken to specialist
E32  76 judges in connection with their \0CC winners and have been amazed at
E32  77 their apparent lack of knowledge or perception.
E32  78    |^It is understandable that they should have some enthusiasm for
E32  79 their \0CC winners, but not to the extent that they cannot see their
E32  80 imperfections yet I have come across cases where specialists*- in some
E32  81 cases I must admit where they are fulfilling their first championship
E32  82 show engagement*- when they have gone into raptures over very ordinary
E32  83 specimens with quite obvious faults and even when fundamental
E32  84 anatomical faults were pointed out to them*- such as faulty shoulders,
E32  85 movement and so on*- they have not only been unable or unwilling to
E32  86 see the faults, but have even given me a sort of pitying look one
E32  87 gives to a half-witted child because I even suggested that their idol
E32  88 had feet of clay*- so to speak.
E32  89    |^On the other hand I have heard specialist judges condemn exhibits
E32  90 for faults which either they did not possess, were not provided for in
E32  91 the Standard or for things which they obviously were not equipped to
E32  92 judge.
E32  93    |^*4A*2S *0examples of this I recently heard the scathing comment
E32  94 *"slipped patella**" used about the action of a dog which gave an
E32  95 occasional hop when I am perfectly sure no veterinary surgeon would
E32  96 have committed himself to that diagnosis without at least subjecting
E32  97 the dog to examination. ^And I am extremely doubtful if the judge
E32  98 making that remark would be able to recognise the condition by
E32  99 examination. ^Especially as one of them added the revealing comment,
E32 100 ^*"I believe they've had that trouble in that kennel**".
E32 101    |^Another specialist of some repute faulted a dog for missing
E32 102 molars, although in fact she had not examined the dog and was only
E32 103 going by hearsay.
E32 104    |^And even if the dog did have missing molars the breed Standard
E32 105 makes no mention of that as a fault.
E32 106    |^I am not saying a dog should not be penalised for missing molars,
E32 107 but how many judges even look at molars? ^And do they all know just
E32 108 how many teeth of each category a dog should have?
E32 109 *<*6BENCH AND FIELD*>
E32 110 *<HOW THE MINOR BREEDS CAN HELP THEMSELVES*>
E32 111 *<*4by *6\0F WARNER HILL*>
E32 112    |^T*2HE *0problem of the non-certificated breeds at the
E32 113 championship shows is always with us. ^The *"big boys**" are tacitly
E32 114 expected to schedule a number of them with the almost certainty they
E32 115 will lose money. ^The extent of the classification given to these
E32 116 breeds again rests on the generosity of the promoters, but here the
E32 117 breed clubs can play a considerable part. ^It is well known that
E32 118 breeds of this type often pay better at regional open and limited
E32 119 shows than they do at national events, but as breed clubs are
E32 120 invariably based on national membership I do suggest they could
E32 121 relieve those national shows who schedule them with guarantees, either
E32 122 whole or partial according to their financial position. ^If guarantees
E32 123 are impossible then could not there be more cash specials reserved for
E32 124 shows of this type to encourage the members to enter? ^I am fully
E32 125 aware of the complexities of the problem, for I am president of one of
E32 126 the minor clubs concerned, and feel that when certificates are on
E32 127 offer these are a prime attraction, and could be balanced at shows
E32 128 without certificates with augmented prize money in the way of specials
E32 129 from the club coffers.
E32 130    |
E32 131    |^*4I*2T *0is of untold good to have a breed represented at
E32 132 national fixtures, and in the smaller breeds the club members must of
E32 133 necessity be prepared to give financial support whenever possible.
E32 134 ^One does not see so often a group of breed patrons providing private
E32 135 guarantees and so relieving the club finances as formerly, but I might
E32 136 commend to those interested the words of Robert Burns, translated into
E32 137 English. ^A lot of people offering a little extra support apiece can
E32 138 accomplish a large result, and this is by far the most satisfactory
E32 139 one. ^A patron with the best intent in the world wealthy enough to
E32 140 hand over plenty of cash is always in these suspicious days running
E32 141 the risk of being accused of *"buying their way in**". ^I know for a
E32 142 fact one or two sensitive people have actually provided this cash
E32 143 support in the form of anonymous donations with no conditions as to
E32 144 how it should be used. ^I know one well-known club which opens a
E32 145 subscription list to offset show expenses, and the contributors' names
E32 146 are listed, but not the amount of their donations, just one way of
E32 147 overcoming an embarrassment, and proving the *"widow's mite**" as
E32 148 equally well thought of as the gold of the wealthy pharisee.
E32 149    |
E32 150    |^*4I*2N *0glancing through the entry list at Birmingham (taken at
E32 151 random as an example) I note that there are some strange anomalies.
E32 152 ^For instance, Pointers without certificates in six classes average
E32 153 3.3, while German Short-haired Pointers under the same judge with
E32 154 certificates rate six in six classes whilst Weimaraners which he also
E32 155 judges come up with a five average in four classes without \0CCs.
E32 156 ^This is all the more creditable to Weimaraners in view of their
E32 157 position in the schedule. ^Maybe they are not looked on as *"bird
E32 158 dogs**", but still they might have been listed with them rather than
E32 159 behind the Spaniel classification. ^Birmingham, in fact, does not seek
E32 160 guarantees, but some of the bird dog breeds at least have flourishing
E32 161 clubs and might well have supported to some extent. ^I hope I will not
E32 162 be accused of taking invidious exceptions, but a new club such as the
E32 163 Pointer Club seeking more certificates for the breed particularly in
E32 164 the Midlands might well have supported quite a generous classification
E32 165 of six, with something more attractive to their members than a couple
E32 166 of rosettes.
E32 167    |
E32 168    |^*4C*2LUMBERS *0without certificates have 20 entries and average
E32 169 five, which is good when one considers that the overall average entry
E32 170 for the Spaniel classes is 6.5 per class and Fields (without \0CCs)
E32 171 though not so good at 3.25 per class are certainly better than last
E32 172 year when only two entries were received*- an average of only 1 per
E32 173 class.
E32 174    |^It is also noteworthy that the general average at this show is
E32 175 about 6.5 and the Gundog group as a whole must be classed as quite
E32 176 satisfactory with an approximate average of 7.2
E32 177    |
E32 178    |^*4A*2MONG *0all the difficulties of running a successful kennel,
E32 179 one problem is of naming the inmates. ^The Wilson Wileys who live at
E32 180 Little Wardrobes and adopted this place name as their prefix, have
E32 181 been christening homebred stock with names associated with a lady's
E32 182 wardrobe, such as Mink in all its varieties, Georgette, Hunting Pink,
E32 183 Sari, Sable, \0etc, and finally have run out of kindred names.
E32 184 ^Returning from their round-the-world tour and faced with the naming
E32 185 of a couple of litters awaiting their arrival, \0Mrs Wilson Wiley, to
E32 186 while away time (no pun intended) on the last leg of the journey,
E32 187 started jotting down names of accessories such as jewellery. ^She
E32 188 listed such names as Cut Diamond, Emerald, Opal, Garnet, \0etc, and
E32 189 finally, running out of ideas, stuffed the paper in her make-up case.
E32 190 ^Going through Customs she was specifically asked if she had any
E32 191 jewellery bought abroad to declare and gave a conscience clear
E32 192 ~*"No,**" but a suspicious Customs officer, insisting on examining the
E32 193 contents of the case, came across this list of jewels, and it took a
E32 194 lot of talking on the part of her solicitor husband to convince the
E32 195 officer this was not a smuggler's list but merely a list of names for
E32 196 some Boxer puppies.

E33   3 *<*6THE MANUFACTURE OF YOGHURT*>
E33   4 *<*4Danish Dairy increases Output*>
E33   5    |^I*2N *0many European countries such as Switzerland, Holland,
E33   6 Germany and Italy sales of yoghurt have recently undergone a
E33   7 considerable increase, and are even greater as one comes as far south
E33   8 as Turkey and the Balkans, where yoghurt originated. ^In the
E33   9 Scandinavian countries they have not varied very much, with the
E33  10 possible exception of Sweden, where there has been a market interest
E33  11 in this special cultured milk product.
E33  12    |^From time to time in Denmark, there has been a move to increase
E33  13 sales, especially when the international weekly and monthly journals
E33  14 have emphasized the health-giving properties of yoghurt.
E33  15    |^The increase to date, however, has not given rise to much profit,
E33  16 for a considerable turnover and investment in the product is necessary
E33  17 before much return can be expected. ^When this has been achieved there
E33  18 are grounds for rationalising the product and improving the quality.
E33  19    |^Some time ago an effort was made to sell more yoghurt in greater
E33  20 Copenhagen, and the dairy firm {Jaegersborg Alle*?2s Mejeri}
E33  21 increased its sales so that production could be rationalised,
E33  22 according to the latest methods.
E33  23    |^The dairy has now constructed a completely new yoghurt
E33  24 department, equipped with new plant, the most important of which is a
E33  25 large new automatically controlled yoghurt incubator (\0Fig. 1). ^The
E33  26 incubator is 2 \0m. wide, 1 \0m. deep and 2 \0m. high and holds in all
E33  27 2,000 quarter-litre yoghurt jars of the type shown in \0Fig. 2, which
E33  28 stand in galvanized crates, 50 to each crate. ^It is well insulated
E33  29 and finished in stainless steel plate, both inside and out.
E33  30    |^The conditions necessary for the manufacture of yoghurt of the
E33  31 right quality include a very careful control of all time-temperature
E33  32 combinations throughout the process. ^The incubator is therefore
E33  33 equipped with a very precise and entirely automatic control, which
E33  34 leaves nothing to chance from the moment the yoghurt jars enter the
E33  35 cupboard till they are removed to the dispatch department. ^It is
E33  36 easier to understand the function of the automatic control when it is
E33  37 considered in connection with the manufacturing method employed by
E33  38 {Jaegersborg Alle*?2s Mejeri}, which must not be varied if one is to
E33  39 obtain a uniform product from day to day. ^The product should have a
E33  40 mild, acid and aromatic flavour.
E33  41 *<*4Methods of Manufacture*>
E33  42    |^*0Stassinized milk is used for the manufacture of yoghurt. ^The
E33  43 milk is stored overnight at 4*@ \0C., because it has been found that
E33  44 the ageing of the milk, which takes place during this storage period,
E33  45 is important in the quality of the final product.
E33  46    |^The aged milk is then filled into a 500 \0l. jacketed stainless
E33  47 steel container and heated to 70*@ \0C. ^It is homogenised at this
E33  48 temperature, using only a light pressure, and is then fed to a second
E33  49 holding vessel, exactly similar to the first, where it is heated to
E33  50 95*@ \0C. in 30 \0min.
E33  51    |^Afterwards the milk is cooled to 50*@ \0C., at which point 3 per
E33  52 cent yoghurt culture is added. ^This is thoroughly stirred in, after
E33  53 which the milk is filled in to the new 250 \0ml. jars, with a 55 \0mm.
E33  54 opening designed so that the yoghurt can be eaten direct from the jar.
E33  55 ^Filling is carried out by a Handy *=2 apparatus which is fitted with
E33  56 specially designed filling valves for the wide mouthed jars.
E33  57    |^The yoghurt culture, which consists of a mixture of {streptoccus
E33  58 thermophilus} and {thermobacterium bulgaricum}, is particularly
E33  59 sensitive to disinfectants and sodium hypochlorite is not used
E33  60 therefore in the final rinse water during the washing of the jars.
E33  61 ^Instead, the final temperature is raised so that the jars leave the
E33  62 washer hot and dry in a relatively short time.
E33  63    |^After filling and capping, the temperature of the inoculated
E33  64 yoghurt milk is reduced to 41-42*@ \0C., and the jars are put into the
E33  65 incubator, where this temperature is held constant for approximately 2
E33  66 \0hr. ^Supplementary heat is provided by an electric heating element
E33  67 enclosed in the partition wall between the two doors, which is
E33  68 automatically controlled by means of contact thermometers. ^The
E33  69 temperature is then reduced to 20*@ \0C. during the next 2 \0hr.
E33  70 ^Cooling takes place by means of chilled water and this is also
E33  71 automatically controlled so that the temperature falls evenly. ^In
E33  72 further period **[SIC**] of 2 \0hr. the temperature is reduced from
E33  73 20*@ \0C. to 4*@ \0C., which is maintained until the yoghurt is
E33  74 removed from the cupboard.
E33  75    |^Freezing is carried out by a refrigeration unit mounted above the
E33  76 incubator. ^This is also equipped with automatic time and temperature
E33  77 controls which are mounted in a separate control panel.
E33  78    |^The accuracy of control is demonstrated by the rate of acid
E33  79 development which is almost constant from day to day. ^In the
E33  80 manufacture of yoghurt it is also important to prevent the product
E33  81 from wheying off at any stage, and it is essential that the ripening
E33  82 is stopped at the correct degree of acidity, and the temperature
E33  83 subsequently reduced quickly and evenly.
E33  84    |^{Jaegersborg Alle*?2s Mejeri} have chosen to handle yoghurt in
E33  85 the new standard jars because they believe that nothing appeals more
E33  86 to both the eye and the appetite than hundreds of clear, uniformly
E33  87 filled jars standing ready for dispatch. ^With its new equipment the
E33  88 dairy can turn out 2,000 jars daily, but if the trade continues to
E33  89 expand it will only be a question of time before new equipment is
E33  90 added to that already installed.
E33  91    |^The manufacturers of the incubator, which is equipped with Faxholm
E33  92 automatic controls, are \0P. Andersen's {0EFTF.} of Copenhagen.

E33 133 *<*4Milk Drying*>
E33 134    |^C*2ONSIDERABLE *0technical developments have been taking place in
E33 135 the field of milk drying during recent years and there is no
E33 136 indication as yet that the flow of new ideas and developments in this
E33 137 field is coming to an end.
E33 138    |^An entirely new process developed on the Continent and suitable
E33 139 for drying milk as well as a variety of other foods is the
E33 140 {0B.I.R.S.} process, the first detailed description of which has
E33 141 recently been published (1). ^The main object of the process is to
E33 142 remove water from the product to be dried in such a way as to have a
E33 143 minimum effect on the flavour and nutritive value of the original
E33 144 product. ^This is achieved essentially by drying at a temperature
E33 145 below 30*@ \0C. ^After pilot plant studies had shown that over 80
E33 146 different foods, including milk, butter, cheese and yoghurt, could be
E33 147 dried successfully by the process, a commercial plant was built in
E33 148 Sienna, Italy, and is now in operation for the manufacture of tomato
E33 149 powder. ^The plant consists of a 70-meter high, plastics-lined drying
E33 150 tower, through which particles of the product to be dried fall in
E33 151 counter current to slowly rising pre-dried air flowing at a rate of
E33 152 0.05 to 1 meter per second. ^Since the drying takes place very slowly
E33 153 at a temperature below 30*@ \0C., little of the aroma and flavour of
E33 154 the original product is lost.
E33 155    |^The air is dried by passage through chambers containing moisture
E33 156 absorbents and enters the chamber with a moisture content of 3 per
E33 157 cent, leaving it at the top of the tower with a moisture content of
E33 158 80-90 per cent. ^The air is also filtered before entering the drying
E33 159 tower, containing not more than 0.5 \0mg. dust per cubic meter and
E33 160 being free from bacterial contamination. ^The particle size can be
E33 161 varied by regulating the distributor feeding the product into the
E33 162 tower and drying can be extended from 5 \0sec. to considerably longer
E33 163 periods. ^New plants which have been planned to have drying capacities
E33 164 of 1,000 to 5,000 litres moisture removed per hour and it has been
E33 165 calculated that only 1.2 to 1.8 \0kg. steam are required for the
E33 166 evaporation of 1 \0kg. moisture by the {0B.I.R.S.} process, compared
E33 167 with 3.0 to 3.5 \0kg. required in continental spray-drying.
E33 168    |^The main object of a number of recent American patents appears to
E33 169 be to achieve a powder of higher solubility and/or stability,
E33 170 attention being directed especially to the drying of whole milk. ^One
E33 171 such process (2) involves incorporating an inert gas of low solubility
E33 172 into a concentrated, homogenised fat-containing milk in which the fat
E33 173 particles do not exceed 2\15m, subjecting the concentrate to such
E33 174 conditions of temperature and pressure as will prevent substantial
E33 175 evolution of gas while causing the concentrate to foam or puff, and
E33 176 finally drying the foamed concentrate to produce a dry cellular
E33 177 product which is readily dispersible in cold water by hand stirring.
E33 178    |^Another, somewhat similar, process (3) involves converting
E33 179 concentrated milk into a stable foam by incorporating a small amount
E33 180 of a foam-stabilising agent (1-4 per cent by \0wt.) and a large volume
E33 181 of air or inert gas. ^The milk foam produced is then exposed, in the
E33 182 form of a thin layer, at normal pressures to a current of hot gases at
E33 183 120*@-220*@ \0F. until it is dried. ^During drying, the foam retains
E33 184 its expanded volume with the result that the final product is a
E33 185 brittle, sponge-like porous mass consisting of a matrix of solid milk
E33 186 particles interspersed with pockets of gas. ^It is readily crushed to
E33 187 form a product of porous flakes which are highly soluble in water.
E33 188    |^On somewhat different lines is a process suitable for
E33 189 spray-drying whole milk (4), which involves spraying concentrated milk
E33 190 into a vacuum chamber and subjecting it to radiant microwave energy at
E33 191 a temperature below 35*@ \0C. in the upper section until a solids
E33 192 content of 87 per cent has been reached, after which it is treated by
E33 193 infra-red rays at a temperature below 60*@ \0C. until the dried milk
E33 194 particles attain a moisture content less than 5 per cent. ^The milk
E33 195 particles may also be coated by spraying a hot lactose solution into
E33 196 the lower part of the drying chamber. ^This imparts improved
E33 197 solubility to the dried milk.
E33 198    |^Improved solubility is also claimed in a process emanating from
E33 199 the Netherlands (5), in which spray dried skim- or whole milk is
E33 200 heated to 70*@ \0C. in a steam jacketed rotary mixer and 0.2-4 per
E33 201 cent by weight of similarly heated liquified soya-lecithin is added,
E33 202 causing the milk particles to become coated with the lecithin.

E34   3    |^Owing to the number of important competitions held recently we
E34   4 regret we have been unable to include in this issue some interesting
E34   5 technical articles, including the first of a new series. ^These will
E34   6 be published next month.
E34   7 *<*6APPRENTICESHIP RATIO*>
E34   8    |^I*2T *0has been said that hairdressers can employ more
E34   9 apprentices*- that is over the legal ratio*- provided they pay rates
E34  10 which are not less than those of any *"other worker.**" ^But the very
E34  11 fact of paying an apprentice more money does not permit master
E34  12 hairdressers to employ apprentices above the ratio unless such other
E34  13 wages are paid that the Order specifies.
E34  14    |^The rate which would have to be paid in these circumstances would
E34  15 be those **[SIC**] of first-year operatives and not those of *"other
E34  16 worker.**" ^It is known that a number of hairdressers have employed
E34  17 young people as apprentices at *"other worker**" rates believing this
E34  18 was permissible. ^This is not so and while it may in certain cases
E34  19 have been tolerated in the first year of apprenticeship, the payment
E34  20 of *"other worker**" rates would certainly not be acceptable in the
E34  21 second year.
E34  22    |^The intention of the authority concerned is to operate the Wages
E34  23 Order as written. ^There need be no doubt about that. ^An increasingly
E34  24 sharp official eye is being kept on the situation. ^The present ratio
E34  25 compared with that of 1948 implies that three times the number of
E34  26 young people are being apprenticed today. ^This is an answer to those
E34  27 who say that the age-old custom of apprenticeship is dying.
E34  28    |^And these days, the employer has the advantage of getting the
E34  29 apprentice supplementary training at National Technical Colleges and
E34  30 these facilities are growing. ^It is just a matter of time before the
E34  31 trainee schools will disappear altogether from the scene.
E34  32    |^Every intelligent hairdresser knows by now that he has an
E34  33 obligation to provide proper training for apprentices because it is in
E34  34 his own interests that there should be a pool of qualified assistants
E34  35 from which to draw replacements and increase staff. ^It cannot be
E34  36 there for him unless he undertakes to train his own quota of young
E34  37 people in the right way.
E34  38    |^He also knows that the trainee river of supply is poor and
E34  39 useless to him however much work he puts in to try and improve it. ^We
E34  40 must face the fact that those young people who seek to enter the
E34  41 {6bona-fide} Craft through trainee school instruction are trying to do
E34  42 things the easy way. ^They are not willing, and probably do not
E34  43 possess the ability, to undergo the discipline and teaching of the
E34  44 three-year course. ^We are sorry for them. ^It is the bitter lesson
E34  45 that they must learn. ^Hairdressing is not easily taught. ^There are
E34  46 no short cuts. ^Maybe one or two young trainees do have a pronounced
E34  47 flair for hairdressing and a higher standard of intelligence and
E34  48 education than the majority of their kind, but that has nothing to do
E34  49 with the rest.
E34  50    |^It is the duty of the hairdresser to teach, keep alive and make
E34  51 progressive the various skills which are the basis of professional
E34  52 hairdressing. ^He will know that however much he himself knows about
E34  53 his job, there is always something more to learn. ^It should be a
E34  54 matter of professional pride to understand the art of wig-making, for
E34  55 example, however unnecessary it may appear to some. ^For we have not
E34  56 seen the last of the wig in the world of fashion. ^We have never said
E34  57 goodbye to it throughout our history, and that goes back a very long
E34  58 way.
E34  59    |^There are newer skills and there will be even more. ^Modern hair
E34  60 colouring, for instance, is comparatively new. ^Its techniques will
E34  61 grow more complex, just as every other professional skill grows more
E34  62 complex. ^We must not imagine anyway that simplification is a boon.
E34  63 ^It often leads to the cheapening of a service in terms of quality.
E34  64 ^It is a moot point if a simplified service can impose increased
E34  65 charges. ^The professional service of the hairdresser must be always
E34  66 something that the public cannot provide for itself.
E34  67    |^Do not let us be misled that because times may be affluent that
E34  68 it is necessarily easier for us to earn a better living. ^There are
E34  69 countries which we could mention where the standard of living is very
E34  70 high and where more and more women are dressing their own hair. ^This
E34  71 can only be because they do not think that the service their
E34  72 hairdressers offer is worth the money.
E34  73    |^It can happen here, too. ^If we drop our professional service
E34  74 standards by turning out mass produced work the public in the end will
E34  75 judge us. ^We can charge what we like. ^The public will decide whether
E34  76 or not it pays.
E34  77 *<*6RAISING GENT'S PRICES*>
E34  78    |^W*2E *0are glad to see the gentleman's hairdresser putting up his
E34  79 prices. ^They are, unfortunately, still not high enough. ^Here we have
E34  80 indeed a high standard of skill, but the charges for it have been too
E34  81 low for too long.
E34  82    |^Now property values are soaring and it is certainly becoming
E34  83 extremely difficult for the small gent's salon to exist. ^More and
E34  84 more of these will be driven away from busy streets into back streets,
E34  85 and a large portion of these will inevitably cease to exist. ^Apart
E34  86 from the difficulty of obtaining young people to enter the business,
E34  87 the tide is running in favour of the larger units.
E34  88    |^But even these will have to obtain higher prices for their
E34  89 service. ^They will get them. ^It is an indispensable service. ^And
E34  90 there is scope in the business for other services and for new ideas.
E34  91 ^Young men are already showing increasing smartness in their
E34  92 appearance and dress. ^The dowdy man in a shabby suit will shortly
E34  93 belong to the dreary past. ^Older generations may not always approve
E34  94 of what the young generation does, but they cut no ice with the
E34  95 youngsters. ^Their support of new styling has been a good thing for
E34  96 the gentleman's hairdresser.
E34  97 *<*6A FINE EXHIBITION*>
E34  98    |^O*2VER *021,000 people visited the Hairdressing Exhibition at
E34  99 Alexandra Palace and there is every reason to think that the numbers
E34 100 who attend the next show will be even greater. ^This implies that it
E34 101 is possible to build up this Exhibition in its present form to numbers
E34 102 fit to compare with the public exhibitions of the past.
E34 103    |^It is a fact that the hall at Alexandra Palace was larger than
E34 104 the National Hall at Olympia and the standard of display was far
E34 105 higher than anything we have done before. ^It is another fact that the
E34 106 majority of our exhibitors had displays that would not be likely to
E34 107 attract much attention from the public. ^But they are of interest to
E34 108 hairdressers.
E34 109    |^A final fact is that much more could be done to popularise and
E34 110 publicise the Exhibition to the hairdresser. ^There is always the
E34 111 magnet of the great competitions, but there could be other ideas as
E34 112 well to bring the hairdresser along.
E34 113    |^There is plenty of time to consider the next show. ^Maybe
E34 114 Blackpool will get a closer look from the {0H.M.W.A.} next year.
E34 115 ^But here a whole great town offers attractions and it is,
E34 116 furthermore, a holiday town, which the great Metropolis is definitely
E34 117 not!
E34 118 *<*6A FOOLISH ECONOMY*>
E34 119    |^T*2HERE *0is an increasing tendency among master hairdressers to
E34 120 assume that they need not insure themselves for employers' liability.
E34 121 ^It is thought that if an employee suffers industrial injury that
E34 122 **[SIC**] the matter is fully taken care of by National Health
E34 123 Insurance.
E34 124    |^But if it is proved that an employer has been negligent, the
E34 125 employee can sue him. ^We do, of course, take that risk if we don't
E34 126 insure. ^We can attempt to justify this by arguing that as we have
E34 127 never had a case of this kind why should we keep on paying premiums to
E34 128 insurance companies?
E34 129    |^Accidents, however, usually take us by surprise. ^They are never
E34 130 expected until they happen. ^Who would have thought that Miss Jones
E34 131 would get a sudden attack of dermatitis through her hair colour work?
E34 132 ^She had done it for so long. ^Of course it did happen that there was
E34 133 a time when we hadn't renewed her rubber gloves or had a tube of
E34 134 barrier cream available. ^How unfortunate! ^Certainly unfortunate for
E34 135 us if Miss Jones decides to sue.
E34 136    |^Naturally, we do save money if we don't pay employers' liability
E34 137 insurance premiums. ^We may save it for years. ^But how much does it
E34 138 amount to? ^A few pounds? ^And how much can Miss Jones get out of us?
E34 139 ^Your guess is as good as ours*- maybe thousands.
E34 140    |^No, the risk of economising here is just not worth it. ^Let us
E34 141 choose other ways of saving our pennies. ^We are a public service and
E34 142 an important one. ^We are, therefore, up front to be shot at. ^A busy
E34 143 salon season is coming. ^That fact alone increases our risks as
E34 144 employers. ^We should do everything possible to limit them.
E34 145 *<*6TO WAIT OR NOT TO WAIT*>
E34 146    |^T*2HE *0Registration Movement celebrates a year of quiet and
E34 147 steady progress with a small Dinner and Dance in London. ^This is a
E34 148 serious minded body with one object: to pass a Bill through Parliament
E34 149 to get hairdressers registered.
E34 150    |^When is it likely that such a Bill will go through? ^Many
E34 151 hairdressers ask this. ^If it happened, of course, the rush to
E34 152 register would be an avalanche! ^But surely that is the wrong way to
E34 153 go about things. ^If the rush took place now and if the Hairdressers'
E34 154 Registration Council could claim that every hairdresser wanted
E34 155 Registration, we think that the Bill would get considerable support in
E34 156 Parliament and that when it came to be presented the Government would
E34 157 get it through.
E34 158    |^We have to be united in this cause and show determination to
E34 159 achieve the object. ^If we take the view that we are not going to do
E34 160 anything until it looks as if the Bill is going to succeed, then all
E34 161 we are doing is to undermine or delay the cause. ^Full support is
E34 162 necessary.
E34 163    |^Do we or do we not want Registration? ^If we don't want it, then
E34 164 what do we do to safeguard the Craft? ^Let us take it for granted that
E34 165 most of us want to safeguard it. ^But how else can we do it? ^It seems
E34 166 that only Registration can do this job. ^And if we all agree about
E34 167 that, why not act now and do something about it?
E34 168    |^The fee to a hairdresser is only ten shillings a year. ^It should
E34 169 be twice that amount. ^How much money is spent in postage in trying to
E34 170 get members to renew their membership? ^How much money is spent in
E34 171 publicising the Movement? ^However much is spent on either account, if
E34 172 more were available a better job could be done for the Movement.

E34 175 *<*4Colour for *6VERY GREY AND WHITE HAIR*>
E34 176    |^T*2HE *0colouring of very grey and white hair presents particular
E34 177 features which differ from the colouring of naturally coloured hair or
E34 178 hair containing only a small amount of grey. ^As hair loses its colour
E34 179 pigment, alterations take place in its structure which change the
E34 180 texture of the hair and often affect its resilience. ^These changes
E34 181 vary from head to head, so that no hard and fast rules can be made
E34 182 when applying colour, and the results will vary considerably,
E34 183 according to the condition of the hair.
E34 184    |^The most common change of texture in greying hair is a hardening
E34 185 of the hair shaft, which takes on almost a glass-like appearance and
E34 186 can be very resistant to some forms of colour. ^This is most
E34 187 noticeable when using temporary or semi-permanent colour. ^A temporary
E34 188 colour can in extreme cases be thrown off, even as it is being
E34 189 applied, so resistant is some white hair, and the partial penetration
E34 190 of a semi-permanent colour which allows for a lasting power of some
E34 191 weeks will not always be as effective on very grey hair when the
E34 192 cuticle of the hair has hardened.
E34 193    |^Semi-permanent colouring is the most popular and generally used
E34 194 form of colouring very grey and white hair, and the colour expert has
E34 195 a wide variety of grey, blue-grey and pastel tones from which to
E34 196 choose.

E35   2 *<*6LIMITED BUDGET ADVERTISING*>
E35   3 **[EDITORIAL**]
E35   4    |^*2MORE MONEY *0than ever is now being spent on stimulating the
E35   5 public to travel abroad*- whether for business or pleasure. ^But what
E35   6 about the smaller agent? ^Even the small agent with only limited
E35   7 resources should advertise, provided the money is well directed into
E35   8 the proper channels.
E35   9    |^Bearing in mind the fact that the smaller travel agent offers
E35  10 special services to a particular cliente*?3le, the problem is not as
E35  11 difficult as it looks. ^This first article therefore, deals with the
E35  12 press side; the second will deal with public relations, and the third
E35  13 will deal with direct mail. ^And these aim to offer just a few
E35  14 suggestions on how the smaller agent can *'sell himself**'
E35  15 successfully. ^There are of course many other forms of publicity which
E35  16 will not be covered, such as outdoor posters (roadside hoardings, bus
E35  17 sides, trains \0etc.) illuminated signs and so on.
E35  18 *<*4Not most effective*>
E35  19    |^*0Naturally when one first thinks of press advertising, it
E35  20 conjures up the thought of taking space in the national dailies or
E35  21 Sunday papers; but it must be pointed out that, whilst this is an
E35  22 ideal media, it does not mean it is necessarily the most effective
E35  23 method of reaching your public. ^With your type of cliente*?3le, and
E35  24 the kind of money which you have available for advertising, the local
E35  25 press is probably the ideal way of reaching your client. ^Whatever the
E35  26 flavour or colour of your local paper, do remember that these are read
E35  27 avidly for local information, \0etc. ^It has been proved by research
E35  28 as well as by the response of local traders that spaces however large
E35  29 or small certainly have the required pulling power!
E35  30 **[TABLE**]
E35  31    |^In addition, of course, you will probably be able to afford to
E35  32 take small spaces in the small circulation local magazines,
E35  33 {0*1i.e.} *0church magazines, local shopping guides \0etc., whose
E35  34 readers are also susceptible to your kind of advertising. ^For this
E35  35 purpose it is necessary to find out which papers and magazines
E35  36 potential customers read*- then use them.
E35  37    |^In most cases advertising rates are very economical indeed for
E35  38 the amount of coverage which they offer. ^To give an example of costs,
E35  39 the major counties of England have been selected and in the table on
E35  40 page 41 these are listed together with the number of weekly papers in
E35  41 each area, together with the overall average costs per single column
E35  42 inch. ^As will be seen these are extremely economical.
E35  43 *<*4When to advertise?*>
E35  44    |^*0This is a very important factor when thinking of advertising.
E35  45 ^To reach the holiday market, it would be advisable to plan your
E35  46 campaign, if you are selling inclusive tours or package holidays, so
E35  47 that it appears in late December or during January. ^It is advisable
E35  48 to keep in reserve a small amount for advertising during March/ April
E35  49 to catch those people who do not decide where or what they are going
E35  50 to do until later in the year, or possibly are wanting to see what the
E35  51 Budget is going to do for them. ^It is at this time when the public
E35  52 are thinking of planning their forthcoming annual holiday. ^It would
E35  53 be extremely wasteful to spend money on promoting summer holidays in
E35  54 the middle of June or July.
E35  55    |^If you are in a highly industrial area where there are a number
E35  56 of top level executives who are unable to get away during the normal
E35  57 periods, then it may be wise to promote a special campaign
E35  58 *'selling**' the idea of getting away during late autumn, finding the
E35  59 sun, or travelling to a winter skiing holiday. ^This campaign would be
E35  60 best planned to commence around late August or the beginning of
E35  61 September. ^The writer feels that repetitive small spaces are better
E35  62 able to keep the company's name before the public, rather than putting
E35  63 all your eggs in one basket by taking say a half-page, and thus
E35  64 spending all your money in one large effort.
E35  65    |^It should be apparent from these remarks that very careful
E35  66 thought and planning should be undertaken before carrying out any type
E35  67 of advertising.
E35  68 *<*4Quality is what counts*>
E35  69    |^*0As has already been stated, it is not always the size of space
E35  70 which dominates but how the space which *1is *0bought, can be used to
E35  71 the best advantage. ^If you can only afford 2 \0in. single columns in
E35  72 your local newspaper, it is wise only to
E35  73 **[ILLUSTRATIONS**]
E35  74 promote the company name together with the facilities offered. ^An
E35  75 example of style for this format is shown. ^Even in small spaces such
E35  76 as this the *'brand image**' is incorporated. ^It may, however, be
E35  77 felt that at certain times during the year you are able to offer the
E35  78 public in your area a special *'package**' holiday to various resorts.
E35  79 ^This will mean taking larger spaces to display this information. ^An
E35  80 example of this type of display is also illustrated. ^Once again the
E35  81 *'brand image**' of the company is followed through. ^As will be seen
E35  82 the same name plate and border \0etc. are adhered to, thus continuing
E35  83 the build-up of the company's image.
E35  84 *<*4Creating a brand image*>
E35  85    |^*0To promote your company successfully it is wise to create a
E35  86 brand image, and this can be done by standardising the style of the
E35  87 company name either by creating a name block of the company name,
E35  88 {0*1i.e.} *0Poly Travel, or by adhering to a standard form of
E35  89 setting the company name. ^This should be carried throughout on
E35  90 letterheads, labels \0etc. ^This, together with a type of border display
E35  91 which is repetitively used whenever advertising the facilities
E35  92 offered, will in time become immediately recognisable as belonging to
E35  93 your company. ^An example of how this can be achieved in different
E35  94 sizes is shown on the layouts illustrated in this article.
E35  95 *<*6THE BASIC QUALITIES OF PERSONAL SELLING *4by *6STUART THOMSON*>
E35  96 *<*4Successful salesmanship largely depends on a positive attitude*>
E35  97    |^*2THROUGHOUT *0the British Isles the benefits and pleasures of
E35  98 travel are being creatively sold or *'offered for sale**'. ^There is a
E35  99 considerable difference in these two functions and the difference will
E35 100 be emphasised in this series of articles.
E35 101    |^Working from ill-equipped Dickensian offices or operating from
E35 102 large, plush showrooms of global romance, are the men and women who
E35 103 are, or should be, engaged in selling travel. ^Without any doubt some
E35 104 of them have pledged themselves, by their mental attitudes, to a life
E35 105 of frustration, inertia and discontent, whilst some of their
E35 106 colleagues have destined themselves, because of quite contrasting
E35 107 attitudes, to a life of fulfilment, happiness and success.
E35 108    |^As each year passes the sum total of sales promotional activity
E35 109 within the travel industry grows more weighty and impressive. ^Apart
E35 110 from the increased display advertisement space booked in newspapers
E35 111 and magazines, additional use is being made of television and
E35 112 commercial radio. ^Add to this such media as posters and direct mail
E35 113 and it will be quickly appreciated that the consumer public is
E35 114 increasingly well served with information.
E35 115    |^Whilst the ultimate intention of all this publicity is obviously
E35 116 to sell travel, its immediate aim is to foster desire, create
E35 117 awareness and stimulate the intention to act. ^Through a variety of
E35 118 means, for a large number of varied reasons, it helps bring the public
E35 119 to the market place of travel.
E35 120    |^However, nothing materialises, no positive action takes place, no
E35 121 orders are negotiated, until the prospective purchaser is in contact

E35 124    |^*0It is now that people become involved and it is people, with
E35 125 their idiosyncratic ways, patterns of behaviour and thought processes,
E35 126 who make or mar a sale. ^The human personality takes effect. ^Men and
E35 127 women influence the result of a commercial transaction. ^Whilst it is
E35 128 the object of publicity to promote a sale, the inescapable fact
E35 129 remains that promotion is one thing and execution another. ^The key
E35 130 factor in successful selling is the degree of enthusiasm and
E35 131 competence of the sales staff. ^When they lack zest, belief and
E35 132 knowledge, they will mutilate opportunities to make sales. ^When they
E35 133 possess enthusiasm, belief and knowledge, they will create
E35 134 opportunities as well as accept those which are presented to them.
E35 135    |^As far as the practises **[SIC**] and techniques of selling are
E35 136 concerned there are no *'secrets**', no hidden mysteries. ^Commerce
E35 137 has existed for so many centuries that all known usages and practises
E35 138 **[SIC**] are on record.
E35 139 *<*4Learning techniques*>
E35 140    |^*0No one would deny that it is necessary for sales personnel to
E35 141 learn and practise all acceptable techniques which are applicable to
E35 142 the sale of their particular product or service. ^It is, though,
E35 143 almost a waste of time painstakingly to learn the routines of selling
E35 144 unless one approaches this stimulating, rewarding occupation with a
E35 145 positive attitude of mind. ^Beliefs and attitudes play a role of
E35 146 greater importance than techniques which can be learned without
E35 147 difficulty.
E35 148    |^Some people are outstanding, or noticeably good, as salesmen.
E35 149 ^Their success is not wrapped up in mysticism, gift of the gab,
E35 150 unmitigated toil, family influence, or selfish desire for material
E35 151 gain. ^It may be pitifully comforting for those who fail to attribute
E35 152 the sales success of others to all sorts of weird, and sometimes quite
E35 153 petty, reasons, but it is profitless expenditure of nervous energy.
E35 154    |^All good salesmen and women possess four attributes without which
E35 155 they could not succeed.
E35 156    |^(1) They have a sincere and genuine interest in the product or
E35 157 service which they market.
E35 158    |^(2) They consciously enjoy their work*- they like selling.
E35 159    |^(3) Most important of all they believe in themselves, their
E35 160 company, and their industry. ^They believe that what they are doing is
E35 161 the right thing to be doing.
E35 162    |^(4) They think positively. ^They think of success, not of
E35 163 failure. ^They cast out doubts and defeatism, knowing that dwelling on
E35 164 negative corroding thoughts is destructive.
E35 165    |^There are, of course, numerous other assets which are required
E35 166 for a successful career in selling. ^Obviously, for instance, one
E35 167 cannot sell well without enthusiasm, but the man or woman who
E35 168 possesses the four main characteristics just listed is, automatically,
E35 169 enthusiastic.
E35 170    |^Early in this article I said that some people destine themselves
E35 171 for success whilst others ensure for themselves a life of frustration.
E35 172 ^Success in selling is as simple, or as complex, as the control
E35 173 exercised by the attitude of mind to the work to be done.
E35 174 *<*4Automatic polish*>
E35 175    |^*0The man who enjoys his work and approaches it creatively will
E35 176 find that the techniques, the competency and the professional polish
E35 177 will come to him automatically. ^He will learn and progress because he
E35 178 wishes to do so, not because he is forced to do so.
E35 179    |^When a man does not like what he is doing, when he does not
E35 180 believe in it, when he is perpetually day-dreaming and night-scheming
E35 181 as to how to escape from his present mode of life, then he is doomed
E35 182 to failure in his existing employment.
E35 183    |^To sell travel*- or anything else*- successfully, it is essential
E35 184 to want and intend to succeed.
E35 185 *<*4Unaware of resources*>
E35 186    |^*0The travel industry is not alone in utilising the services of
E35 187 some sales people who are mediocre*- that word is high praise for
E35 188 them*- and inefficient because they are unaware of their
E35 189 potentialities as human beings, and unappreciative of the power they
E35 190 possess to be of service to others.
E35 191    |^In certain of such instances it is unfair and unrealistic to
E35 192 place the entire blame on the men and women concerned.
E35 193 *<*4Importance of example*>
E35 194    |^*0An employer, the proprietor of a travel agency, has no right to
E35 195 criticize members of his staff for lack of enthusiasm and absence of
E35 196 application if he, personally, does not set an example. ^A large
E35 197 number of average or poor performers could, and would, be much more
E35 198 successful if only they were given a lead by their seniors and
E35 199 assisted with patience, understanding and fellow feeling. ^All too
E35 200 often this is not the case.
E35 201    |^Successful selling primarily depends on liking the product or
E35 202 service, enjoying selling, believing sincerely in the benefits of
E35 203 one's work and cultivating a successful attitude to life. ^Some people
E35 204 understand this truth instinctively, whilst others need much guidance
E35 205 in order to develop the potentialities that lie within them.

E36   1 **[141 TEXT E36**]
E36   2 ^*0Better crops would enable more stock to be maintained and a
E36   3 progressive cycle of improvement would result.
E36   4    |^The farm lies at an altitude of around 1,000 \0ft. and forms a
E36   5 rather narrow strip from West to East*- high at the West and falling
E36   6 through about two-thirds of its length to a small burn which traverses
E36   7 the farm. ^East of the burn the land again rises towards the boundary.
E36   8 ^The soil generally is a medium loam, somewhat thin and rocky on the
E36   9 hilly part near the west boundary and peaty in the hollow near the
E36  10 burn. ^The soil is not inherently infertile, but on entry the farm was
E36  11 in very poor heart.
E36  12    |^The initial rental was *+70 {6per annum} with an agreement that
E36  13 this would be raised to *+100 when the existing byre was gutted and
E36  14 made into a covered court. ^This was the only alteration made to the
E36  15 steading.
E36  16    |^With the farm in such poor condition the first need was to
E36  17 improve the grassland. ^Soil analyses showed all the land to be very
E36  18 low in lime and the major nutrient elements. ^During the first two
E36  19 winters, therefore, practically the whole farm was limed at the rate
E36  20 of two tons of ground limestone per acre. ^Such grassland as had to be
E36  21 temporarily retained was given a dressing of some 7 \0cwt. per acre of
E36  22 potassic supers supplemented by an application of 1-2 \0cwt.
E36  23 *'Nitro-Chalk**" in the Spring. ^The land which had been under green
E36  24 crop was re-seeded direct and on all fields from which oats were being
E36  25 taken the crop was undersown with Italian and Perennial Ryegrass, the
E36  26 object being to supplement the grazing and provide something to plough
E36  27 down and improve the organic matter content of the soil.
E36  28 *<*5Cropping*>
E36  29    |^*0It should be realised that cropping in this area and at this
E36  30 altitude is no easy matter. ^The winters are very severe, snow
E36  31 frequently persisting into April, and late spring frosts are common.
E36  32 ^This holds up spring work badly and retards sowing while heavy autumn
E36  33 rains and early frosts or even snow storms make harvesting equally
E36  34 difficult. ^The advent of the tractor in enabling more rapid
E36  35 cultivations to be carried through as soon as weather conditions
E36  36 permit has undoubtedly helped to overcome these hazards.
E36  37    |^Before it was taken over the cropping system on Clashnoir had
E36  38 been irregular, but by 1949 it was being worked on a regular seven
E36  39 course rotation common in the area. ^With a regular lea break of
E36  40 around 17 acres the cropping was oats, oats, green crop, oats (sown
E36  41 down) and hay, followed by two years' grazing. ^As the primary
E36  42 intention was to base the economy of the farm on high production from
E36  43 the grassland for both summer and winter, what would have been the
E36  44 normal root break was reduced to three acres and the balance sown down
E36  45 to a one year's special mixture for cutting as silage. ^Later, when
E36  46 the fertility of the farm had been improved and the stocking
E36  47 stabilised, some four acres of rape were regularly grown in addition
E36  48 to the turnips, the former crop being used to finish off the lambs
E36  49 before marketing. ^The special one year's mixture grown for silage was
E36  50 the usual Perennial, Italian and red clover mixture recommended by the
E36  51 College, while the grass seeds mixtures sown were also based on
E36  52 College experience using combinations of early and late maturing
E36  53 strains of ryegrass and cocksfoot to give continuity of growth for as
E36  54 long a grazing season as possible. ^In the control of grazing, use was
E36  55 made of the electric fence and surplus grass was cut for silage; about
E36  56 one hundred tons of silage was made annually in an ordinary pit silo.
E36  57    |^Most of the oats grown in the early years were consumed by the
E36  58 stock on the farm, but as the farm improved an increasing proportion
E36  59 of the crop was generally sold, frequently for seed purposes. ^The
E36  60 greater quantity of straw produced was also welcome as the stock
E36  61 increased.
E36  62 *<*5Manuring*>
E36  63    |^*0While high production from the grassland was the primary aim,
E36  64 the land was not exploited and a balanced system of manuring was
E36  65 practised. ^In addition to the initial liming a dressing of two tons
E36  66 ground limestone per acre was applied to each field once in the
E36  67 rotation. ^Depending on the condition of the fields, the oat crops
E36  68 latterly received applications of 3-4 \0cwt. of a complete
E36  69 concentrated fertiliser combine-drilled and the turnip crop 8-10
E36  70 \0cwt. of a regular turnip manure in addition to dung. ^During the
E36  71 earlier years when fertility was low the dressings were
E36  72 correspondingly heavier. ^When available, basic slag was applied at 10
E36  73 \0cwt. per acre to land which was sown down, after harvesting the
E36  74 nurse crop. ^In the early stages there was a dearth of farmyard
E36  75 manure, but after the first few years there was ample to give the
E36  76 turnip land and the balance of the normal root break a regular and
E36  77 adequate dressing. ^Again depending on the condition of the field, its
E36  78 age and the purpose for which it was intended*- whether for hay, to be
E36  79 cut for silage or grazed*- the grassland was regularly treated with
E36  80 2-3 \0cwt. potassic supers supplemented with 1-1 1/2 \0cwt.
E36  81 *'Nitro-Chalk**' or with 3-4 \0cwt. of a high nitrogen fertiliser.
E36  82 *<*5Stocking*>
E36  83    |^*0At ingoing, the cattle stock consisted of twelve breeding cows
E36  84 and calves and some 170 Blackface ewes were kept between Clashnoir and
E36  85 Thain. ^The cattle stock was transferred to Deskie and in 1949, 21
E36  86 pure bred Aberdeen-Angus in-calf heifers were purchased in the open
E36  87 market at commercial prices. ^It was anticipated that with the
E36  88 manuring undertaken the farm could carry this number, and it was
E36  89 proposed to breed cross calves which would be suckled and sold off
E36  90 their mothers in the autumn. ^Using a white Shorthorn bull this became
E36  91 more or less the practice. ^As the fertility of the land improved, the
E36  92 number of cattle carried was increased until latterly the herd
E36  93 numbered around thirty. ^This number might have been increased
E36  94 further, but accommodation for handling them during the winter was the
E36  95 limiting factor. ^With good foundation breeding stock and using good
E36  96 class bulls, the stock sold from Clashnoir soon became well known and
E36  97 commanded very creditable prices in the local market, while several
E36  98 were brought on by purchasers and gained awards at both the Edinburgh
E36  99 Fat Stock Show and at Smithfield. ^Early calves were regularly sold at
E36 100 the autumn sales, while the odd late calves were kept over their first
E36 101 winter and sold as convenient the following spring or later as
E36 102 six-quarter cattle.
E36 103    |^The herd became attested in 1952, but the normal hazards of
E36 104 farming were encountered and the odd calf (and cow) were lost as on
E36 105 any other farm. ^In 1954 when the stock was being further increased
E36 106 some heifers were purchased in the open market. ^The following spring
E36 107 ten of the cattle aborted. ^Fortunately, as a result of prompt
E36 108 precautions being taken, there were no further losses the following
E36 109 year.
E36 110    |^When the cattle stock was increased so markedly in 1949 a drastic
E36 111 reduction was made in the sheep stock. ^The breeding flock was reduced
E36 112 to 30 ewes and remained at this figure until, in the autumn of 1953,
E36 113 it was felt that this could be increased. ^Forty ewes were kept and
E36 114 twenty gimmers purchased. ^A stock of around sixty breeding sheep was
E36 115 kept thereafter, being replaced one-third annually by the purchase of
E36 116 a score of Blackface gimmers. ^The ewes were crossed with the Border
E36 117 Leicester tup and the lambs and cast ewes sold at the autumn sales.
E36 118    |^For disease prevention the lambs were regularly treated with the
E36 119 double vaccine for lamb dysentery and pulpy kidney within twenty-four
E36 120 hours of birth. ^With a small stock on an enclosed area this was not a
E36 121 difficult matter. ^The only other treatment regularly practised was
E36 122 the dosing of the ewes with phenothiazine in the spring and both ewes
E36 123 and lambs before the autumn sales.
E36 124    |^The only other livestock maintained was a flock of some 200
E36 125 poultry kept on semi-intensive lines. ^No breeding was undertaken, the
E36 126 stock being kept up by the purchase of 100 three-month-old pullets
E36 127 each spring. ^Eggs were disposed of through the district packing
E36 128 station and the culls and old hens sold to a local butcher.
E36 129    |^While this general picture of the way the farm was run will be of
E36 130 interest to the practical farmer, it is the economic aspect which the
E36 131 experiment was undertaken to test. ^This aspect is treated in detail
E36 132 in the next section of this report, but in considering it three points
E36 133 should be borne in mind. ^Firstly, it should be viewed as a whole and
E36 134 not strictly in individual financial years because, when the
E36 135 production of livestock and crops extends over more than a single
E36 136 financial year, profits in any one year are at least partly derived
E36 137 from the farming operations of previous seasons. ^Secondly, the
E36 138 subsidies credited to the accounts were only those to which an
E36 139 ordinary farm tenant would be entitled. ^Perhaps the most important
E36 140 point of all is the fact that capital was available for expansion as
E36 141 required. ^Improvements on similar farms would depend not only on the
E36 142 urge to expand being present but also on credit facilities being
E36 143 available and on farmers being willing to take advantage of these
E36 144 facilities. ^Even so, as the later sections of this report show, the
E36 145 extra capital required to finance the improvements of Clashnoir was by
E36 146 no means excessive in relation to the increase in profits which
E36 147 ensued.
E36 148 *<*43. *6PRODUCTION*>
E36 149    |^*0There was a fairly steady upward trend in the value of output
E36 150 throughout the period of the experiment. ^In the Appendix, Table *=4,
E36 151 figures are given of net output per acre which rose from *+10 8\0s. in
E36 152 1949/50 to *+19 2\0s. in 1954/55. ^After a temporary set-back in
E36 153 1955/56 there was a further rise to *+19 6\0s. in 1956/57. ^After the
E36 154 breeding herds and laying flocks were established, about 1950/51, the
E36 155 pattern of output did not greatly change. ^The cattle enterprise
E36 156 generally accounted for around one-third of the output, sheep and wool
E36 157 for about one-sixth, crop sales for about a quarter and eggs for about
E36 158 one-seventh.
E36 159    |^Rising prices, of course, played a considerable part in the
E36 160 doubling of the value of output between the beginning and end of the
E36 161 experiment. ^The increase in the physical volume of production was
E36 162 less marked but was nevertheless quite significant, particularly for
E36 163 sheep, wool and eggs, as is shown in Table 1.
E36 164 **[TABLE**]
E36 165    |^Most of the cattle were sold as weaned calves in the autumn and
E36 166 these realised very satisfactory prices which generally averaged over
E36 167 *+40 in the later years of the experiment, except for 1955/56
E36 168 (Appendix, Table *=5). ^This was a reflection of the high quality and
E36 169 good reputation of the breeding cattle stock. ^A calving rate of about
E36 170 95 per \0cent. was maintained over the nine years, with the exception
E36 171 of the 1955 season when, following the outbreak of contagious
E36 172 abortion, fewer than two-thirds of the cows calved successfully.
E36 173    |^The increased number of ewes carried on the farm from 1952
E36 174 onwards, together with an improvement in the lambing rate from about
E36 175 130 per \0cent. in the early years to about 145 per \0cent. latterly,
E36 176 led to an increase of nearly 50 per \0cent. in numbers of lambs sold.
E36 177 ^The prices realised for these lambs were generally rather above the
E36 178 average market levels for Greyfaces (Appendix, Table *=5).
E36 179    |^While the laying flock made a significant contribution to the
E36 180 output of the farm, there was no attempt to make poultry more than a
E36 181 subsidiary enterprise; many farms similar to Clashnoir in other
E36 182 respects carried much larger poultry enterprises. ^Once the poultry
E36 183 flock was established, egg sales averaged about 2,000 dozens annually
E36 184 though with some variation from year to year. ^This represented an
E36 185 annual yield, after allowing for some eggs used in the farmhouse, of
E36 186 about 180 eggs per laying bird.
E36 187    |^Crop sales consisted almost entirely of oats and in most years a
E36 188 large part of the crop was sold for seed at attractive prices
E36 189 (Appendix, Table *=6). ^With the improvement in fertility, increased
E36 190 yields per acre made it possible to maintain and to some extent to
E36 191 increase the surplus of oats for sale, even though consumption on the
E36 192 farm also rose.

E37   5 **[EDITORIAL**]
E37   6    |^T*2ESTS *0were recently carried out at the National Institute for
E37   7 Research in Dairying, Shinfield, to find the optimum level of
E37   8 restricted feeding for the economic production of baconers.
E37   9    |^For the particular strains in the Shinfield pig unit and the type
E37  10 of ration in use, it was found that a maximum of 6 1/2 \0lb. a head
E37  11 daily gave the best results.
E37  12    |^But in an identical trial on another farm, using exactly the same
E37  13 diet on pigs of different breeding, it was not possible to feed much
E37  14 above 5 \0lb. a day without lowering the grading of the carcasses.
E37  15    |^This illustrates the great difficulty commercial bacon producers
E37  16 are up against in feeding for economic growth and top grading. ^It
E37  17 also shows why scientists can do little to help in this particular
E37  18 field. ^What is sound practice on one farm can be economically
E37  19 disastrous on the next. ^Producers will have to carry out their own
E37  20 trials to discover the best way to feed their pigs in their particular
E37  21 environment.
E37  22    |^It is not easy to carry out accurate trial work and keep detailed
E37  23 records on a busy, practical farm where labour is already being used
E37  24 at full stretch. ^But it is vitally important to know the most
E37  25 economic way to feed baconers. ^Adopting an arbitrary level of feeding
E37  26 restriction based on other people's experience will not help.
E37  27    |^If the pigs are fed less than they are capable of taking before
E37  28 reaching a point of downgrading, they will take an unnecessarily long
E37  29 time to reach bacon weight and throughput will be slowed down.
E37  30    |^If the daily ration is too large, the pigs will grow rapidly
E37  31 enough, but their grading will be unsatisfactory.
E37  32    |^The margin between underfeeding and overfeeding is very narrow,
E37  33 and it can only be discovered on a basis of trial and error from farm
E37  34 to farm.
E37  35    |
E37  36    |^*4C*2LOSELY *0related to this is the problem of deciding the best
E37  37 stage of growth at which restricted feeding should be introduced.
E37  38    |^Here again, most producers tend to adopt a set age or weight
E37  39 without first endeavouring to establish if it is the best time to make
E37  40 a change.
E37  41    |^Changing from {6*1ad \0lib.} *0to restricted feeding when the
E37  42 pigs are 100 \0lb. liveweight may be, and probably is, too soon. ^If
E37  43 they are allowed to feed to appetite until 140 \0lb. they will reach
E37  44 bacon weight 10 to 12 days earlier.
E37  45    |^The advice of \0Dr. \0R. Braude, who runs the Shinfield pig unit,
E37  46 is to feed young pigs {6*1ad \0lib.} *0until they reach the level of
E37  47 daily intake at which it is intended to restrict them, and then to
E37  48 ration them at that level.
E37  49    |^His experience has been that it is important not to let the pigs
E37  50 reach a daily feed intake above the restriction level and then drop
E37  51 them down again. ^This leads to a growth setback.
E37  52    |^For some time it has been a universal practice among bacon
E37  53 producers to use a two-ration feeding pattern. ^Sow-and-weaner meal is
E37  54 used until a certain stage, when a cheaper, low-protein diet is
E37  55 introduced.
E37  56    |^Once again the question arises: when should the change be made?
E37  57    |^\0Dr. Braude feels that the decisions should be based on the
E37  58 appearance of the pigs and their known grading ability. ^If they tend
E37  59 to put on fat it will pay to keep them on the richer diet up to 120 to
E37  60 140 \0lb.
E37  61    |^But if they are lean and from a good grading strain, the cheaper
E37  62 ration can be introduced between 100 and 120 \0lb. ^He emphasises,
E37  63 however, that these figures are only guides: every producer must find
E37  64 out for himself which is the best stage to make the change for *1his
E37  65 *0pigs, type of ration, and environment.
E37  66    |
E37  67    |^*4T*2HERE *0is a growing school of thought today which wonders if
E37  68 there is any advantage in making a feeding change at all. ^It is felt
E37  69 that the continued feeding of sow-and-weaner meal through to slaughter
E37  70 may improve grading, speed throughput and lower feed conversion to an
E37  71 extent that will more than offset the extra cost of the ration.
E37  72    |^Even if this is not so, there are other advantages. ^The use of
E37  73 only one ration in the piggery speeds the work of feeding and
E37  74 simplifies milling and mixing.
E37  75    |^It also ensures against any possible growth check which might
E37  76 occur if the change over to a finishing diet is made too early.
E37  77    |^Whether it is economic or not will be determined only on the
E37  78 farm, but it is of interest to note the results of a comparative
E37  79 experiment carried out by the Norfolk School of Agriculture:
E37  80 **[TABLE**]
E37  81    |^These figures show a distinct grading improvement which, in view
E37  82 of the fact that there was no increase of premium payments for length,
E37  83 must be attributable to the feeding.
E37  84    |^In addition, baconers on the single ration reached their
E37  85 slaughter weight five days earlier in summer and 10 days earlier in
E37  86 winter than pigs on two-stage feeding.
E37  87    |^In terms of hard cash, this is calculated to bring in *+20 to
E37  88 *+25 more profit from every hundred baconers sold, without taking into
E37  89 consideration the streamlining of labour and the simplification of
E37  90 mixing and storage.
E37  91    |^This illustrates how wrong it is to attach too much importance to
E37  92 the price of a ration. ^It is the feeding *1value *0which counts. ^A
E37  93 food costing *+30 a ton may be dearer to buy than one at *+28 a ton
E37  94 but it can be cheaper to feed.
E37  95    |^If the diet is *+2 a ton more expensive because it has a higher
E37  96 nutrient value and its use improves the feed conversion rate of a
E37  97 baconer from 3.5 to 3.2, the cost of feeding that baconer is reduced
E37  98 by 3\0s. 1\0d.
E37  99    |^For this reason, trials carried out on the farm to determine the
E37 100 best method for feeding bacon pigs should not be evaluated in terms of
E37 101 feed conversion ratios, as they are in official progeny tests. ^The
E37 102 best measure of efficiency is the food cost per pound of liveweight
E37 103 gain related, of course, to the grading results obtained.

E37 105 **[EDITORIAL**]
E37 106 *<by *6PHILIP BOLAM*>
E37 107    |^S*2IMPLICITY *0is the hallmark of David Stevens' farming at
E37 108 Lechlade, Gloucester. ^The whole business is geared to low-cost milk
E37 109 production from over 100 Friesian cows, with maximum use of grass, on
E37 110 260 acres of Thames gravel.
E37 111    |^Such a soil would have tempted many farmers to escape from the
E37 112 cow's tail and the seven-day week*- perhaps to adopt some intensive
E37 113 arable cropping along with fat lamb production. ^But \0Mr. Stevens
E37 114 feels there are advantages in being a specialist.
E37 115    |^Getting the most out of well-manured grassland, keeping up to
E37 116 date with new techniques and managing a large dairy herd profitably is
E37 117 a skilled occupation, especially with the profusion of new ideas from
E37 118 the research stations and the farming press.
E37 119    |^The herd is milked in a six-stall six-unit Hosier bail, which in
E37 120 summer is drawn round the grass fields and in winter stands on
E37 121 concrete near the loose housing and the self-feed silage clamps. ^When
E37 122 the bail is in the field an electric fence forms a collecting pen and
E37 123 a simple *"electric dog**" speeds milking when concentrate feeding is
E37 124 low.
E37 125    |^Many dairy farmers in this situation are content with moderate
E37 126 yields, relying on low costs to provide a good margin of profit. ^But
E37 127 \0Mr. Stevens' **[SIC**] had a true average of 1,050 gallons per cow
E37 128 consuming 1.9 \0lb. cereal and concentrates for each gallon of milk
E37 129 produced.
E37 130    |^Gross sales per man now stand at *+5,000 a year. ^The labour
E37 131 force consists of two cowmen on contract who also tend all the
E37 132 replacement stock, and a tractor driver who acts as relief milker.
E37 133    |^Critics of the system suggest that the herd should be halved and
E37 134 milked in two separate six-stall three-unit bails with one cowman
E37 135 responsible for each. ^While partly agreeing with this, \0Mr. Stevens
E37 136 argues that managerial decisions would increase with twice the milking
E37 137 machinery and two sets of grazing to arrange, without much financial
E37 138 advantage.
E37 139    |^He believes that if concentrates are cubed, the cows learn to eat
E37 140 quickly*- after all, they masticate food at leisure. ^Rolled barley is
E37 141 used to balance grass or silage.
E37 142    |^Space was short in the bail, so in-churn milking was discarded in
E37 143 favour of an overhead pipeline which carries the milk to churns at one
E37 144 end. ^A quick and simple method of washing up is based on the
E37 145 immersion cleaning technique developed by the {0NIRD}, using a 3 per
E37 146 cent caustic soda solution. ^No daily dismantling is necessary. ^The
E37 147 caustic soda, stored in a twenty-gallon container in the bail loft,
E37 148 flows by gravity into the milking system.
E37 149    |^The teat-cups are inverted in racks and each set is filled in
E37 150 turn from the overhead milkline. ^Odd pipes and utensils are soaked in
E37 151 a special container. ^The solution is sucked back into the storage
E37 152 tank before the next milking, followed by a rinse with cold water.
E37 153 ^The cost of converting to this system is low, and the only running
E37 154 expense is 10\0s. worth of caustic soda and water softener each month.
E37 155    |
E37 156    |^*4T*2HE *0grazing and silage-making programme revolves round
E37 157 Italian ryegrass, kale for autumn grazing and timothy-meadow
E37 158 fescue-white clover leys, together with an acreage of permanent grass.
E37 159 ^No grass is conserved as hay. ^Leys are ploughed for Italian
E37 160 ryegrass, which in its second summer is heavily coated with farmyard
E37 161 manure and ploughed for kale. ^The leys are reseeded direct the
E37 162 following spring.
E37 163    |^This is a hungry soil and fertilisers cost *+8 an acre. ^Only two
E37 164 types are used*- nitrogen and a concentrated compound. ^Recording the
E37 165 treatment and output of each grass field was started last year, so the
E37 166 present programme might well be modified when sufficient information
E37 167 has been accumulated.
E37 168    |^There are few hedges or walls. ^Most fields are about 10 acres,
E37 169 separated by one or two strands of barbed wire. ^These are now being
E37 170 replaced by sprung fencing or the electrified lines of high tensile
E37 171 wire with posts every 50 yards.
E37 172    |^Strip grazing with back fences is preferred to paddock grazing.
E37 173 ^Cows are given two fresh feeds of grass a day, usually in two
E37 174 different fields. ^The more grass they can be persuaded to eat, the
E37 175 more milk they give. ^Any grass left uneaten is allowed to grow on and
E37 176 cut for silage.
E37 177    |^Herd health is good with culling at 15 per cent. ^Milk fever and
E37 178 hypo-magnesaemia are not common but foul-in-the-foot and arthritis can
E37 179 be troublesome. ^A phosphorous deficiency was noticed recently and now
E37 180 a high phosphorous supplement is added to the food.
E37 181    |^The covered yards built eight years ago and open self-feed silage
E37 182 clamps cost about *+50 a cow. ^The two clamps, just outside the
E37 183 covered yard, each hold 375 tons and provide a total feeding face of
E37 184 64 \0ft. ^Walls of railway sleepers assist filling, but when the
E37 185 silage has settled the top sleepers are removed and the clamps covered
E37 186 with thin polythene sheeting.
E37 187    |^The area of concrete between the loose housing and the silos has
E37 188 been kept to the minimum, but slurry disposal was a problem, as
E37 189 buildings and the surrounding land are on the same level.
E37 190    |^The muck from the silo face and concrete yard is collected by an
E37 191 adapted buckrake and pushed over a concrete ramp by reversing the
E37 192 tractor. ^It lies untouched till midsummer, by which time it is
E37 193 sufficiently solid to be handled with a muck loader.
E37 194    |^Lying in a low rainfall area, spring reseeding and summer kale
E37 195 sowings were always a risk. ^In 1959 irrigation was introduced and now
E37 196 it is possible to cover 3 1/2 acres a day with 1 \0in. of rain*-
E37 197 although moving the pipes makes heavy demands on the labour force.
E37 198    |^Like many others, \0Mr. Stevens feels his farming must be geared
E37 199 to meet sterner times. ^He may have some answers when he returns from
E37 200 his visit to New Zealand.

E37 203    |^*4T*2HE *0three most powerful impressions I received on my recent
E37 204 tour of the French countryside*- in particular some of the recent
E37 205 *"agricultural trouble spots**"*- were 1. The absence of any farm
E37 206 labourers, or farmers, for that matter, under 35 or so years of age;
E37 207 2. The comparatively high standard of crop husbandry; and 3. The
E37 208 comparatively small size of most farming units, herds and flocks.

E38   4 *<*4Is the {0*6N.F.U.} *4minding its own business?*>
E38   5    |^*4M*2ANY FARMERS MUST BE RESERVING JUDGMENT ON THE NEW SEEDS
E38   6 COMPANY, {0*2N.F.U.} *0Seeds Industries, \0Ltd. ^It is, says the
E38   7 National Farmers' Union, a private company. ^One half of the 250,000
E38   8 *+1 shares will be taken up by merchants and one half by the
E38   9 {0*2N.F.U.} *0Development Company. ^To the layman, however, it looks
E38  10 uncommonly like the {0*2N.F.U.} *0entering another business on the
E38  11 familiar lines of *"vertical integration**" which is first cousin to
E38  12 *"take-over.**"
E38  13    |^The whole affair is puzzling. ^The aims of the new company are
E38  14 described as being:
E38  15    |^To develop production and promote the use of the best quality
E38  16 strains of British grown and bred herbage seeds, and to encourage the
E38  17 most efficient grassland management.
E38  18    |^To assist British merchants and farmers by providing a consistent
E38  19 range of mixtures for specified purposes chosen on the best technical
E38  20 advice.
E38  21    |^To provide for farmers, through the {0*2N.F.U.} *0brand, a
E38  22 guarantee of authenticity and quality of the seeds used.
E38  23    |^To provide for improved buying, cleaning, processing, packing and
E38  24 distribution facilities to consumers at home and abroad.
E38  25    |^To bring about, by means of an adequate stock carry-over policy,
E38  26 greater price stability and constant supplies.
E38  27 *<*5An industry on its toes*>
E38  28    |^*4A*2LL *0these are laudable objects, but is any one of them new?
E38  29 ^If ever an industry was on its toes and eager to provide good
E38  30 service, I would have said it was the seed industry. ^The
E38  31 {0*2N.F.U.} *0reports that *"three firms have agreed to participate
E38  32 as main processors and distributors of the branded seed.**" ^All are
E38  33 firms of the highest repute. ^But what of the many others not taking
E38  34 part? ^Are their present services so inadequate that it is necessary
E38  35 for the {0*2N.F.U.} *0to step in and improve matters?
E38  36    |^What triggered off the move was a report, published last year, on
E38  37 the marketing of herbage seed. ^The {0*2N.F.U.} *0was rightly
E38  38 concerned with ensuring that British seeds had at least an equal share
E38  39 in their home market with foreign seeds, and there is much, though not
E38  40 everything, to be said for a standardised product. ^Not everyone,
E38  41 though, would deplore *"internecine competition**" among seed firms.
E38  42 ^Some of us still believe that competition is healthy and conducive to
E38  43 efficiency.
E38  44    |^Perhaps the Union's new venture will prove its value. ^If there
E38  45 has to be *"vertical integration,**" it is probably better for farmers
E38  46 that the {0*2N.F.U.} *0should be in control. ^Yet I, for one, am a
E38  47 little suspicious of this latest child.
E38  48 *<*5Dairy shorthorn decline*>
E38  49    |^*4\0M*2R. {0G. N.} GOULD, *0chairman of the Hampshire Cattle
E38  50 Breeders' Society, \0Ltd., states that at the society's {0A.I.}
E38  51 centre, demand for Friesian services continues to increase at the
E38  52 expense of the dairy shorthorn. ^Aberdeen-Angus are now suffering,
E38  53 too, for farmers who once crossed them with Friesians for beef are now
E38  54 breeding pure Friesians.
E38  55    |^Dairy shorthorns have also been making disappointing figures in
E38  56 the sale rings. ^Recently, of two shorthorn herds dispersed at
E38  57 Reading, one averaged *+60 4\0s., and the other only *+43 4\0s. 11\0d.
E38  58 ^The highest price bid in both sales was 66 guineas. ^In the same week
E38  59 a Guernsey dispersal sale averaged *+91 3\0s. 9\0d. (this was for
E38  60 Overbury Farms, at Beckford Court, Overbury, Gloucestershire), 43
E38  61 animals commanding three-figure prices. ^At Nun House, Winsford,
E38  62 Cheshire, \0Mr. \0T. Lea Sherwin's Stanthorne herd of Friesians
E38  63 averaged *+118 17\0s. 2\0d.
E38  64    |^This present unpopularity of the shorthorn is, I feel sure, a
E38  65 passing phase which will be corrected. ^Consider the longevity of the
E38  66 breed. ^Theale Maud 12th, a dairy shorthorn cow owned by \0Mr. Hugh
E38  67 \0N. Haldin, of Court Lodge, Hinxhill, near Ashford, Kent, has
E38  68 achieved a new breed record by producing a total of 201,196\0lb. of
E38  69 milk (with a butterfat yield of 7,371\0lb.) in 12 lactations. ^At 16
E38  70 years old she is still giving 35\0lb. of milk a day.
E38  71    |^Another thing I notice is that although entries for the Royal
E38  72 Dairy Show in October are down by 35, the dairy shorthorn entry has
E38  73 risen by two.
E38  74 *<*6EQUIPMENT FOR THE FARM*>
E38  75 *<*0By *2GEORGE JARRETT*>
E38  76 *<*4Tele-Bins bring bulk transport and storage within reach of even
E38  77 the small farmer's pocket*>
E38  78    |^B*2ULK *0handling with its indisputable economies in time, cost
E38  79 and labour is something which must be exercising the minds of many
E38  80 people not only in farming and its ancillary industries, but also in
E38  81 industry. ^The tonnage which is moved on our farms must be colossal.
E38  82 ^In corn growing bulk handling is taking the place of sacks, while
E38  83 with fertilisers and lime, too, the tendency is towards the
E38  84 elimination of unnecessary handling.
E38  85    |^Here are the figures of some of the estimated losses which bulk
E38  86 handling can save. ^It has been suggested that in the building trade
E38  87 something like 30 per \0cent. of the sand purchased is lost in various
E38  88 ways while in heaps on building sites. ^In farming something like 2
E38  89 1/2 per \0cent. of fertilisers may be left in the corners and creases
E38  90 of fertiliser bags after emptying. ^The same may apply to
E38  91 feedingstuffs.
E38  92    |^The solution to some of the problems is reasonable in price.
E38  93 ^Bulk handling so often makes one think of the latest bulk
E38  94 transporters costing around *+5,000, but I am now going to describe a
E38  95 movable container priced at about *+118.
E38  96    |^Making its debut on the agricultural and industrial market is the
E38  97 Amalgamated Limestone Corporation's Tele-Bin, made of light sheet
E38  98 steel with frames made of Stewart and Lloyd's new rectangular hollow
E38  99 section. ^The weight of the complete container is 5\0cwt. ^The bins
E38 100 measure 6\0ft. x 4\0ft. x 6\0ft. high, and have a capacity of
E38 101 90{0cub. ft.}*- enough for two tons of fertiliser or feedingstuff or
E38 102 three tons of basic slag, lime, cement or any dry materials.
E38 103    |^More and more uses are being found for these portable bulk
E38 104 containers on estates and large farms. ^Agricultural merchants, too,
E38 105 are fast becoming enthusiasts. ^The railway is interested in the bins
E38 106 for sugar-beet. ^Overseas, they are suitable for many goods from
E38 107 coffee beans to any small root crop.
E38 108    |^The advantage of this system is that, having started with one
E38 109 bin, one can buy more to enlarge one's activities. ^For instance, the
E38 110 small farmer can buy but one in which to store feedingstuffs.
E38 111 ^Transporting the bins is simple with a flat-bottomed lorry or one
E38 112 with drop sides, either of which can be easily converted into a bulk
E38 113 carrier, with three bins fitting on to a 14\0ft. lorry. ^To obtain the
E38 114 maximum economy, one will need two sets of bins*- one in transit and
E38 115 the other on the farm being loaded and unloaded. ^This brings the
E38 116 capital outlay up to about *+690 for six bins, which is a tremendous
E38 117 saving on specialised bulk transport vehicles.
E38 118    |^These bins taper downwards to the outlet and are set in a frame
E38 119 having four telescopic legs on a 9\0in. diameter round base. ^The legs
E38 120 are attached to a gatelike frame which closes inward when not in use;
E38 121 for instance, when the bin is lying on the lorry bed. ^On the lorry's
E38 122 arrival at its destination in farmyard or in field, these frames pull
E38 123 outwards whilst the telescopic legs are adjusted to rest on the
E38 124 ground. ^The width between the legs is 8\0ft., and the height can be
E38 125 adjusted according to the height of the lorry by 18\0in. (so that an
E38 126 ordinary box manure distributor can fit underneath the bins to be
E38 127 loaded when fertiliser is being handled). ^For wider distributors a
E38 128 shute can be supplied which can be clipped on to the guide rails of
E38 129 the bin aperture.
E38 130    |^The bin covers are metal with a rubber ring inside, to keep out
E38 131 moisture and wet, enabling the fully loaded bin to be left in the
E38 132 open, protected against the weather and vermin. ^This protection from
E38 133 vermin is most important, particularly with feedingstuffs, and by
E38 134 itself can lead to big economies. ^The discharge aperture consists of
E38 135 two large flat plates which slide in opposite directions (the handle
E38 136 is flat), giving positive opening and closing. ^These plates can be
E38 137 locked so that the contents cannot be touched except by removing the
E38 138 entire unit. ^Each of the four legs contains a simple screw jack with
E38 139 a thrust bearing which is operated telescopically inside of two tubes
E38 140 by a ratchet spanner: this enables the driver of a transporting
E38 141 vehicle to put off a fully loaded bin. ^Taking on the bin is a one-man
E38 142 job, too.
E38 143    |^For use with fertilisers the bins can be painted with
E38 144 anti-corrosive paint at extra cost. ^In any case, they can be painted
E38 145 for the sake of protection or in order to look smarter.
E38 146    |^This {0*2A.L.C.} *0Tele-Bin was introduced at the Bath and West
E38 147 Show. ^I feel that it will bring the advantages of bulk handling to
E38 148 many who have previously been deterred by the thought of having to
E38 149 spend *+4,000, because one can literally start off with spending only
E38 150 about *+118 for one of these bins \0ex works.
E38 151    |^Already considerable interest has been shown by county councils,
E38 152 which are eyeing the bins for road gritting; many small builders
E38 153 should save money by buying the bins for holding sand, cement and
E38 154 similar materials; farmers can use the bulk handling for fertilisers
E38 155 and for strategically located feedingstuff stores over the farm; grain
E38 156 from the combines can be shot straight into the bins, later to be
E38 157 collected by the lorry and taken to dryer or mill. ^The bins can be
E38 158 insured, too.
E38 159    |^The Amalgamated Limestone Corporation (\0Dept. B), Chipping
E38 160 Sodbury, Gloucestershire, will give more information or will arrange
E38 161 demonstrations.

E38 164 *<*4What goes on at Pirbright*>
E38 165    |^W*2HENEVER *0an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease erupts to
E38 166 spread despondency and send imprudent farmers running in panic to grab
E38 167 insurance policies, one of the by-products is sure to be a rash of
E38 168 letters to the Press demanding what Pirbright is up to. ^For at this
E38 169 Surrey village a team of scientists devote their lives, in the
E38 170 Research Institute for Animal Virus Diseases, to putting salt on the
E38 171 tails of the elusive microbe troublemakers.
E38 172    |^So painfully slow is this tricky operation that the impatience of
E38 173 the farmer, prejudiced by the fact that he has just lost the herd on
E38 174 which he has spent 20 years, can be appreciated. ^Especially as
E38 175 scientists, immersed in their world of embryo chicks and suckling mice
E38 176 and being, in any case, by training ultra-cautious, are seldom very
E38 177 good at publicity. ^Papers such as *1Purification of the Virus of
E38 178 Foot-and-Mouth Disease by Fluorocarbon Treatment and its Dissociation
E38 179 from Neutralising Antibody, *0one of the latest Pirbright
E38 180 publications, do not assist public relations, valuable though they are
E38 181 from other points of view.
E38 182 *<*5The reasons for slaughtering*>
E38 183    |^*4O*2NCE *0every five years, however, the Institute issues a
E38 184 report. ^Here is the latest, just out, a modest half-crown's worth in
E38 185 which \0Mr. {0S. W.} Cheveley, chairman of the governing body, and
E38 186 his scientific henchmen tell us how they have been using their time
E38 187 and our money since 1956.
E38 188    |^One thing we learn is that, far from shutting their eyes to the
E38 189 existence of vaccines in extensive use in other parts of the world, as
E38 190 is often alleged, Pirbright actually manufactures these vaccines. ^In
E38 191 fact, two years ago the demand for them became so great that the staff
E38 192 very nearly arrived at the point of stopping research work in order to
E38 193 concentrate on manufacture. ^Fortunately the Wellcome Foundation
E38 194 stepped in and took over this side of the work, leaving the scientists
E38 195 to get on with their proper job.
E38 196    |^Why then are we without vaccines to stop the drain on our flocks
E38 197 and herds? ^In the first place, although a major epidemic is a
E38 198 spectacular disaster, the general casualties resulting from the
E38 199 disease in Britain still amount to less than 0.5 per \0cent. ^This is
E38 200 lower than would probably be achieved by a vaccination policy, and we
E38 201 would be paying the penalty of allowing the disease to become endemic.
E38 202    |^The other reason for sticking to the slaughter policy is that
E38 203 there are seven known strains of foot-and-mouth disease virus.
E38 204 ^Without the drastic measure of slaughter we might find ourselves
E38 205 invaded by one of the Asian or African viruses from which we are so
E38 206 far mercifully free.
