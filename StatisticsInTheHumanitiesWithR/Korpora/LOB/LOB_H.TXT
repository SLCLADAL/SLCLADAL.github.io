H01   2    |^*0Questions about marriage and children were again included, as
H01   3 they had been at the 1911 and 1951 Censuses. ^The former had asked for
H01   4 marriage details for all married women, the latter for all married
H01   5 women under the age of 50. ^The 1961 Census questions related to all
H01   6 women who were or had been married, and so repeated the enquiry made
H01   7 fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family Census conducted on behalf of
H01   8 the Royal Commission on Population. ^The questions about children were
H01   9 the same as in 1951, except that they extended to all women who were
H01  10 or had been married. ^It was not regarded as practicable within the
H01  11 limits of the census to include particulars about the date of birth of
H01  12 each child, as had been done in the specialised enquiry for the Royal
H01  13 Commission. ^The innovation at the 1961 Census, though the Family
H01  14 Census had previously included the question, was the date of
H01  15 termination of the first or only marriage. ^This enables statistical
H01  16 use to be made of their experience as regards duration of marriage and
H01  17 number of children in the case of women whose first or only marriage
H01  18 was terminated by widowhood or divorce after the end of their child
H01  19 bearing life. ^This is particularly important in estimating the trends
H01  20 in the size and pattern of families for successive generations over as
H01  21 long a period as possible, as the proportion of widows predominates in
H01  22 the higher age groups.
H01  23    |^In Wales and Monmouthshire the question on the ability to speak
H01  24 Welsh was included as previously. ^The question was first asked in
H01  25 1891, and was given its present form in 1931.
H01  26    |^Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions about
H01  27 housing and households. ^In 1961 the scope of the question was wider
H01  28 than before, because of the great use of the data to the Ministry of
H01  29 Housing and Local Government and to local authorities. ^As before, the
H01  30 record made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residential
H01  31 premises and temporary places of abode, and all households occupying
H01  32 them, as the basis of the enumeration is the household schedule. ^The
H01  33 number of structurally separate dwellings (that is, houses or flats or
H01  34 other quarters built or adapted for separate occupation and forming a
H01  35 private and structurally separate unit) was obtained as previously,
H01  36 together with the number of households with sole occupation or sharing
H01  37 such dwellings, and the number of living rooms occupied by each
H01  38 household. ^In 1961 the enumerators were asked to note whether the
H01  39 building was wholly or partly residential, and whether it contained
H01  40 one or more dwellings.
H01  41    |^In 1951 questions had been included to throw light on housing
H01  42 conditions. ^In 1961 the questions about piped water supply, water
H01  43 closet and fixed bath were repeated as before, with the addition of a
H01  44 new question about hot water supply; the 1951 questions about cooking
H01  45 stove or range and kitchen sink were restricted to households sharing
H01  46 dwellings.
H01  47    |^A new question asked about housing tenure, whether the
H01  48 accommodation occupied by each household was held by them as
H01  49 owner-occupiers; occupied in connection with employment or as part of
H01  50 business premises; rented from a Council (or New Town Corporation) or
H01  51 a private landlord (if so, whether furnished or unfurnished); or
H01  52 occupied on some other terms.
H01  53    |^The analysis of private households by size and various
H01  54 characteristics of their members has become increasingly important.
H01  55 ^Previously, while visitors were left out of this analysis it was not
H01  56 considered sufficiently important to attempt the task of bringing in
H01  57 the members away from home on Census night, which would be very
H01  58 laborious in the absence of information given at their place of usual
H01  59 residence. ^But the need for a more accurate distribution of
H01  60 households by size as usually constituted had become more important by
H01  61 1961, and accordingly a new question was introduced, for private
H01  62 households only, asking for particulars of persons usually living in
H01  63 the household who were absent on Census night. ^The information
H01  64 collected under this head will not affect the main count of population
H01  65 numbers, but will be used solely in the analysis of households by size
H01  66 and other characteristics.
H01  67    |^*4Sample.*- ^*0At an early stage of the census preparations
H01  68 consideration was given to possibilities of reducing the amount of
H01  69 clerical work before the census results could be mechanically
H01  70 processed, and the various topics for inclusion were examined to see
H01  71 whether full analysis was required, as previously, or whether sample
H01  72 analysis would serve their main purpose. ^It appeared that a 10 per
H01  73 cent sample analysis would give adequate results for many subjects,
H01  74 notably the analysis of the working population. ^The sampling fraction
H01  75 chosen, 10 per cent, was selected partly on grounds of convenience but
H01  76 mostly on an assessment of the likely reliability of figures in the
H01  77 projected tabulations, and of the margins that might be tolerated.
H01  78 ^The use of sampling in this field reduces the total numbers of staff
H01  79 required in the Census Office as well as speeding up the production of
H01  80 the census results.
H01  81    |^The sampling method was introduced at the enumeration stage and
H01  82 the effect of this was to reduce the number of questions for nine
H01  83 tenths of the people. ^Nine out of ten private householders received a
H01  84 form with fewer questions than previously this century. ^The tenth
H01  85 received a form not much larger in content than the 1951
H01  86 questionnaire. ^In other establishments, (hotels, hospitals, ships,
H01  87 \0etc.,) the extra questions were asked of every tenth person. ^The
H01  88 sample was so arranged as to be fully representative over the country
H01  89 as a whole, and everyone had the same possibility of being included.
H01  90    |^The questions chosen for sample treatment were those relating to
H01  91 occupation, employment, place of work, status in employment education,
H01  92 scientific and technological qualifications change of usual residence
H01  93 or duration of stay at present usual residence, and persons usually
H01  94 resident in private households who were absent on Census night.
H01  95    |^*4Order-in-Council.*- ^*0In accordance with the procedure set out
H01  96 in the Census Act, 1920, a draft Order-in-Council, prescribing the
H01  97 date of the census the persons by whom and with respect to whom the
H01  98 returns were to be made, and the substance of the questions to be
H01  99 asked, was laid before Parliament on the 6th April, 1960. ^The draft
H01 100 Order was explained fully in the House of Commons and was accepted
H01 101 without opposition; at the same time the House approved the inclusion
H01 102 of questions about the first or only marriage where this had
H01 103 terminated, about housing tenure, education, scientific and
H01 104 technological qualifications change of usual residence in past year or
H01 105 duration of stay at present usual residence. ^These questions required
H01 106 the affirmative procedure because they are not already specifically
H01 107 authorised by the Census Act, 1920. ^There was a general debate about
H01 108 the draft Order in the House of Lords on the 1st June, 1960, following
H01 109 which the inclusion of these questions was agreed to. ^The Census
H01 110 Order, 1960, ({0S.I.} 1960 \0No. 1062,) was made on 23rd June, 1960.
H01 111 ^The second schedule containing the substance of the questions is
H01 112 given in Appendix C.
H01 113    |^*4Regulations.*- ^*0The detailed machinery for the taking of the
H01 114 census and the precise forms of return to be used in all cases were
H01 115 prescribed in the Census Regulations, 1960, ({0S.I.} 1960 \0No.
H01 116 1175,) which were signed by the Minister of Health on the 11th July,
H01 117 1960, and laid before Parliament on 18th July. ^There was no
H01 118 discussion of them in either House.
H01 119    |^*4Local Organization.*- ^(*1a*0) *1Census Officers. ^*0As at
H01 120 every previous census since 1841, the local arrangements for the
H01 121 enumeration were based on the area covered by the local registrar of
H01 122 births and deaths, with some modifications of area so that generally
H01 123 the census districts were limited to a maximum of 100 enumeration
H01 124 districts (that is, approximately 75,000 population). ^Thus, there
H01 125 were 1,315 census districts for the 1,184 registration sub-districts.
H01 126    |^In the main the registrars acted as Census Officers; the 1,315
H01 127 Census Officers comprised 1,093 registrars of births and deaths, 137
H01 128 other registration officers and 85 others appointed as required.
H01 129    |^Superintendent registrars were appointed to act as Census
H01 130 Advisory Officers in 115 cases, mainly in the larger centres of
H01 131 population, to deal with enquiries about the census from any quarter,
H01 132 and to recruit and instruct in their general duties a sufficient
H01 133 number of enumerators for the area.
H01 134    |^The local duties comprised the checking of the boundaries and
H01 135 contents of enumeration districts set out in the draft plans prepared
H01 136 by the central Census Office, the selection, appointment and
H01 137 instruction of enumerators, control of the enumeration and dealing
H01 138 with enquiries or difficulties from the public.
H01 139    |^(*1b*0) *1Enumerators. ^*0The persons appointed to deliver and
H01 140 collect the forms are traditionally called *'enumerators**'. ^They
H01 141 also compile an enumeration record of their district, with the
H01 142 provisional count of numbers and a list of all buildings, residential
H01 143 premises and households. ^The completeness of the census count depends
H01 144 very largely upon the assiduity with which the enumerator searches for
H01 145 all residential premises and any temporary dwellings, caravans, boats,
H01 146 \0etc., where anyone may spend Census night, and in the confidence
H01 147 which he can inspire in the ordinary householder that the census is
H01 148 necessary and the answers kept secret. ^There is far more in the job
H01 149 than mere issue and collection of forms.
H01 150    |^The identification of buildings by type, of structurally separate
H01 151 dwellings and private households is a complex process dependent upon
H01 152 detailed instructions. ^The census schedules themselves have to be
H01 153 fully understood so that advice can be given to people in difficulty.
H01 154 ^But above all the work requires tact and courtesy, so that the
H01 155 returns may be secured from the public without friction or offence.
H01 156    |^Instructions for the recruitment of enumerators were sent out in
H01 157 early January. ^The power of appointment was delegated to the local
H01 158 Census Officers, as it was not practicable to exercise central
H01 159 control. ^Guidance was given, and advice or assistance was available
H01 160 in the event of difficulty. ^To widen the field of recruitment as far
H01 161 as possible, a general press notice was issued, which was very well
H01 162 covered by the local press and notifications were sent to Government
H01 163 Departments, to local authorities and local education authorities.
H01 164    |^Arrangements were made for close co-operation with the managers
H01 165 of local Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour, and, in
H01 166 particular, that Census Advisory Officers and Census Officers should
H01 167 ascertain whether the managers had suitable people to put forward for
H01 168 possible appointment from persons registered with, or applying to,
H01 169 them for employment. ^As it was essential to select persons who would
H01 170 be willing and available to carry out the duties some weeks ahead, in
H01 171 the main selection was confined to persons able to undertake spare
H01 172 time duties, or housewives and retired persons.
H01 173    |^Some 69,000 enumerators were appointed in England and Wales. ^As
H01 174 previously many were local government officers and civil servants.
H01 175    |^Applications for appointment were received in great numbers in
H01 176 nearly all urban areas, but in some rural areas there was difficulty
H01 177 in making up the numbers required. ^Instructions were given that as
H01 178 far as practicable no enumerator should be assigned to a district in
H01 179 which he was known by the residents, as people might be reluctant that
H01 180 the confidential information on a census schedule should be made
H01 181 available to an enumerator personally known to them. ^But this was not
H01 182 always possible, particularly in rural areas. ^All enumerators signed
H01 183 an undertaking that they understood the nature of their duties and
H01 184 their obligation to keep secret the information collected, and that
H01 185 they were aware of the heavy penalties for any breach of confidence.
H01 186    |^(*1c*0) *1The Enumeration. ^*0The basis of the enumeration was,
H01 187 as previously, that forms should be completed for every private
H01 188 household, and for every hospital, hotel or other similar
H01 189 establishment under arrangements made by the persons in charge. ^The
H01 190 normal private household is the family type with husband, wife and
H01 191 children, but persons living alone or a group of two or more persons
H01 192 living together also constituted households for the census. ^Where
H01 193 accommodation is sub-let and the occupants live on their own, they
H01 194 would be counted as a household, but persons living with a household
H01 195 who usually have at least one meal a day provided by that household
H01 196 while in residence are treated as belonging to that household.

H02  11 *1Secretary of State for Scotland.
H02  12 *<*4Appointment*>
H02  13    |^*01. We were appointed on 3rd June, 1958, with the following
H02  14 terms of reference:
H02  15 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H02  16    |*"to review, in the light of more recent developments, the advice
H02  17 given by the Departmental Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction
H02  18 in 1926; to consider whether any revised advice should also cover
H02  19 other drugs liable to produce addiction or to be habit-forming; to
H02  20 consider whether there is a medical need to provide special, including
H02  21 institutional, treatment outside the resources already available, for
H02  22 persons addicted to drugs; and to make recommendations, including
H02  23 proposals for any administrative measures that may seem expedient, to
H02  24 the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland**".
H02  25 **[END INDENTATION**]
H02  26 *<*4Procedure*>
H02  27    |^*02. We have held eleven meetings. ^We decided as a first step to
H02  28 seek information from a number of organisations and persons having an
H02  29 interest in the questions before us and at a later stage we arranged
H02  30 for publication of a press notice inviting anybody interested to
H02  31 submit representations. ^We compiled a list of the points which we
H02  32 thought were of importance, but we made it clear that the replies need
H02  33 not be confined to these particular items. ^As a general rule we did
H02  34 not ask for oral evidence, though we found it an advantage in certain
H02  35 instances. ^Appendix *=1 gives a list of the bodies and persons
H02  36 consulted. ^The Department of Health for Scotland, the Home Office and
H02  37 the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us; officers of these
H02  38 Departments attended our meetings and have given us valuable
H02  39 assistance.
H02  40 *<*4Interim Report*>
H02  41    |^*03. On 23rd November, 1959, we submitted an Interim Report.
H02  42 ^This dealt with two questions which arose from our terms of reference
H02  43 and which had been brought specially to our notice. ^First, we were
H02  44 asked to examine the risks attending the abuse of carbromal and
H02  45 bromvaletone and preparations containing these substances. ^The
H02  46 Poisons Board had already considered this problem but, in the absence
H02  47 of sufficient evidence that these compounds were widely abused, had
H02  48 not recommended them for control as *"poisons**" under the Pharmacy
H02  49 and Poisons Act, 1933.
H02  50    |^4. On examination of the evidence it became clear to us that
H02  51 carbromal and bromvaletone were examples of a number of drugs on sale
H02  52 to the public which were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
H02  53 prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951, or the Therapeutic
H02  54 Substances Act, 1956, and had not so far been recommended for control
H02  55 as poisons.
H02  56    |^5. We recommended that, in general, any drug or pharmaceutical
H02  57 preparation which has an action on the central nervous system and is
H02  58 liable to produce physical or psychological deterioration should be
H02  59 confined to supply on prescription and that an independent expert body
H02  60 should be responsible for advising which substances should be so
H02  61 controlled.
H02  62    |^6. As an interim and urgent measure, the Secretary of State for
H02  63 the Home Department, on the recommendation of the Poisons Board, has
H02  64 made Rules under which certain substances having an action on the
H02  65 central nervous system are included in a new list of substances which
H02  66 may be sold by retail only on the prescription of a duly qualified
H02  67 medical practitioner, registered dentist, registered veterinary
H02  68 surgeon or registered veterinary practitioner.
H02  69    |^7. We are glad to note the action that has been taken and we hope
H02  70 that arrangements will be made to ensure that, as other preparations
H02  71 affecting the central nervous system become available, they too will
H02  72 be brought to the notice of the Poisons Board, or such other advisory
H02  73 body as may in due course be appointed for the purpose, to consider
H02  74 whether there are sufficient grounds for restricting any of them also
H02  75 to supply on prescription.
H02  76    |^8. The second part of our Interim Report was devoted to
H02  77 anaesthetists who become addicted to the gases and vapours which they
H02  78 use in the course of their professional duties. ^We ascertained that
H02  79 the incidence of this irregularity was very small indeed. ^However,
H02  80 over a period of eleven years, patients' lives had been endangered in
H02  81 two known instances.
H02  82    |^9. We were assured by our expert witnesses on this subject that,
H02  83 with the apparatus at present to hand, the preliminary sniffing of the
H02  84 gases immediately before administering them to a patient was a
H02  85 recognised and necessary precaution. ^We accepted this.
H02  86    |^10. In view of the heavy and direct responsibility carried by
H02  87 every anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted to the
H02  88 inhalation of gases and vapours should never be entrusted with their
H02  89 administration. ^Intervention in the first instance, we thought,
H02  90 should be by the anaesthetist's professional colleagues. ^The ethical
H02  91 questions arising have been discussed between Ministers and
H02  92 representatives of the medical profession and we are glad to see that
H02  93 a memorandum embodying the agreed arrangements was sent to hospital
H02  94 authorities in England and Wales on 27th May, 1960, and that one was
H02  95 sent to hospital authorities in Scotland on 18th August, 1960.
H02  96 *<*4Report of the Departmental Committee on Morphine and Heroin
H02  97 Addiction (the *"Rolleston Committee**") 1926*>
H02  98    |^*011. The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee, whose advice we
H02  99 were invited to review, were to advise on:
H02 100 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H02 101    |(a) the circumstances, if any, in which the supply of morphine and
H02 102 heroin, and preparations containing these substances, to persons
H02 103 addicted to those drugs might be regarded as medically advisable;
H02 104    |(b) the precautions which medical practitioners administering or
H02 105 prescribing morphine or heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
H02 106 administrative measures that seemed expedient to secure observance of
H02 107 those precautions.
H02 108 **[END INDENTATION**]
H02 109    |^12. Through the system of records and inspection then in
H02 110 operation cases were brought to the notice of the Home Office at that
H02 111 time in which exceptionally large quantities of morphine and heroin
H02 112 had been supplied to particular practitioners or prescribed for
H02 113 individual cases. ^On further enquiry it was ascertained that
H02 114 sometimes the doctor had ordered these drugs simply to satisfy the
H02 115 craving of the addict; in some instances there was a doubt whether the
H02 116 supply was for {6*1bona fide} *0medical treatment; in other cases
H02 117 the drugs had been prescribed in large quantities either to persons
H02 118 previously unknown to the practitioner or to a patient receiving
H02 119 supplies elsewhere; occasionally, large supplies had been used by
H02 120 practitioners for self-administration.
H02 121    |^13. It appeared then that in some circumstances dangerous drugs
H02 122 were being supplied in contravention of the intention of Parliament
H02 123 that a doctor should be authorised to supply drugs only so far as was
H02 124 necessary for the practice of his profession. ^Before deciding on
H02 125 measures to secure proper observance of the law, it was felt necessary
H02 126 to have some authoritative medical advice on various aspects of the
H02 127 treatment of addiction, the use of dangerous drugs in medical
H02 128 treatment, and the action which might be taken where a doctor appeared
H02 129 to have misused his authority to possess and supply them.
H02 130    |^14. The Rolleston Committee's recommendations in 1926 on the
H02 131 supply of morphine and heroin to addicts to these drugs and on the use
H02 132 of drugs in treatment are discussed later in this Report. ^They have,
H02 133 up to now, been included in the Memorandum on the Dangerous Drugs Act
H02 134 and Regulations which is prepared by the Home Office for the
H02 135 information of doctors and dentists.
H02 136    |^15. As a result of the Rolleston Committee's proposals for
H02 137 administrative measures, amendments were made to the Dangerous Drugs
H02 138 Regulations in 1926 to the following effect:
H02 139 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H02 140    |^(**=1) Provision was made for the constitution of a tribunal to
H02 141 which the Secretary of State could refer cases in which, in his
H02 142 opinion, there was reason to think that a duly qualified practitioner
H02 143 might be supplying, administering or prescribing drugs either for
H02 144 himself or other persons otherwise than as required for purposes of
H02 145 medical treatment.
H02 146    |^(**=2) The Secretary of State was empowered, on the
H02 147 recommendation of a tribunal, to withdraw a doctor's authority to
H02 148 possess and supply dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor,
H02 149 or a doctor convicted of an offence under the Act, should not issue
H02 150 prescriptions for dangerous drugs.
H02 151    |^(**=3) It was made clear that prescriptions should only be given
H02 152 by a duly qualified medical practitioner when required for purposes of
H02 153 medical treatment.
H02 154    |^(**=4) It was made an offence for a person who was receiving
H02 155 treatment from one doctor to obtain a supply of dangerous drugs from a
H02 156 second doctor without disclosing that he was being supplied by the
H02 157 first doctor.
H02 158    |^(**=5) All doctors, dentists and veterinary surgeons were
H02 159 required to keep appropriate records of all dangerous drugs obtained.
H02 160 **[END INDENTATION**]
H02 161    |^With the exception of provisions relating to tribunals, which we
H02 162 discuss later, all these amendments remain in the current regulations.
H02 163 *<*4The changed situation*>
H02 164    |^*016. In the thirty-four years since the Rolleston Committee
H02 165 reported there have been developments in two directions which are of
H02 166 interest to our own Committee. ^On the one hand pharmaceutical
H02 167 research has produced a number of new analgesic drugs, many of which
H02 168 are capable of producing addiction. ^Some of these have been derived
H02 169 from opium and others have been produced synthetically. ^It is
H02 170 possible that many more addiction-producing drugs will be produced. ^A
H02 171 potent analgesic which is not addiction-producing has so far not been
H02 172 forthcoming. ^We have had to direct our attention to the question
H02 173 whether these drugs should be used with the same precautions and
H02 174 subjected to the same control as the morphine and heroin considered by
H02 175 the Rolleston Committee.
H02 176    |^17. The second development has been in the methods of treatment
H02 177 of drug addiction. ^The withdrawal from addicts of the drug to which
H02 178 they are addicted has been the subject of experiment in several
H02 179 countries and particularly in the United States of America. ^These
H02 180 experiments have included the substitution of newer addiction-producing
H02 181 drugs and their subsequent gradual withdrawal, and also the
H02 182 use of other new drugs, such as tranquillizers, for the alleviation of
H02 183 the withdrawal symptoms. ^It has therefore been necessary to consider
H02 184 whether there are still circumstances in which the continued
H02 185 administration of dangerous drugs, even under the conditions strictly
H02 186 defined by the Rolleston Committee, can be justified.
H02 187    |^18. We therefore had to consider:
H02 188 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H02 189    |(**=1) whether any new advice could be brought effectively to the
H02 190 notice of doctors and dentists;
H02 191    |(**=2) whether the principles underlying the advice could be
H02 192 emphasised clearly to avoid misinterpretation;
H02 193    |(**=3) whether any action was necessary to prevent the
H02 194 unjustifiable prescribing of dangerous drugs by some doctors;
H02 195    |(**=4) whether there was any way of preventing the unjustified use
H02 196 of dangerous drugs by any doctor for himself or for members of his
H02 197 family;
H02 198    |(**=5) the suggestion made in certain international organizations
H02 199 that Governments might set up special institutions for the treatment,
H02 200 care and rehabilitation of addicts on a compulsory basis.
H02 201 **[END INDENTATION**]
H02 202    |^19. In addition there has been an increase in the use by doctors
H02 203 and by the general public of drugs liable to cause habituation.
H02 204 ^Because they do not give rise to ill-effects substantially the same
H02 205 as, or analogous to, those produced by morphine or cocaine they are
H02 206 not within the scope of international agreements. ^We have considered
H02 207 this development.
H02 208 *<*4Definitions adopted*>
H02 209    |^*020. From the outset we felt it necessary to have a clear and
H02 210 consistent idea of the phenomena confronting us. ^We therefore adopted
H02 211 the following definitions, realising that they are somewhat arbitrary
H02 212 and may need to be revised in the light of increasing knowledge.
H02 213 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H02 214    |^*1Drug Addiction *0is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication
H02 215 produced by the repeated consumption of a drug (natural or synthetic);
H02 216 its characteristics include:
H02 217    |(1) an overpowering desire or need (compulsion) to continue taking
H02 218 the drug and to obtain it by any means,
H02 219    |(2) a tendency to increase the dose, though some patients may
H02 220 remain indefinitely on a stationary dose,
H02 221    |(3) a psychological and physical dependence on the effects of the
H02 222 drug,
H02 223    |(4) the appearance of a characteristic abstinence syndrome in a
H02 224 subject from whom the drug is withdrawn,
H02 225    |(5) an effect detrimental to the individual and to society.

H03   2 ^*0This arrangement has proved helpful, particularly when the teacher
H03   3 of the class takes both sections.
H03   4    |^It is still all too common to find that two or more teachers have
H03   5 to share the instruction of the same class. ^While the staffing
H03   6 position may occasionally make this inevitable, it is rarely a
H03   7 satisfactory measure and should be avoided wherever possible,
H03   8 especially with first-year classes.
H03   9    |^Modern language specialists have as part of their training to
H03  10 spend a considerable period in the country whose language they are
H03  11 principally engaged in teaching. ^It is encouraging to note that a
H03  12 commendable number of teachers continue to go abroad regularly in
H03  13 order to further their own knowledge of the language and to maintain
H03  14 contacts with the country. ^More teachers than formerly now complete
H03  15 the requirements of residence abroad for a second or even a third
H03  16 language; the recent reduction in the period of residence required of
H03  17 honours graduates for recognition in a second language is undoubtedly
H03  18 making this easier to accomplish.
H03  19    |^Foreign assistants (French, German, Swiss, Austrian, Spanish, and
H03  20 Italian) are being employed in increasing numbers throughout the
H03  21 country. ^This session there are in all 126 such assistants. ^Through
H03  22 their own personal knowledge and experience these young assistants can
H03  23 do much to bring to life the study of their home country and they can
H03  24 give the pupils valuable practice in understanding and speaking the
H03  25 foreign language. ^They are usually students, not trained teachers,
H03  26 and consequently their work is most effective when they receive
H03  27 adequate help and guidance from the regular teachers.
H03  28    |^A few exchanges have also been arranged between Scottish and
H03  29 foreign practising teachers and have, on the whole, been very
H03  30 successful.
H03  31 *<*1Accommodation and Equipment*>
H03  32    |^*0Accommodation, although still restricted in some schools, has
H03  33 mainly been adequate and with the building of new schools and the
H03  34 modernization of others there has recently been a marked improvement
H03  35 in teaching conditions throughout the country. ^The majority of
H03  36 teachers now have a room of their own, in which they can*- and
H03  37 frequently do*- develop an appropriate background as an aid to their
H03  38 instruction by the use of wall pictures, posters, maps, models,
H03  39 reference books, and the like. ^The number and variety of wall-maps
H03  40 provided is, however, disappointing. ^The importance for the
H03  41 development of good oral work of allocating to modern language
H03  42 teachers rooms which are relatively free from outside noise and
H03  43 disturbance has not always been sufficiently appreciated.
H03  44    |^Both the quality and the supply of text-books have improved
H03  45 greatly of late. ^In particular, there has been a welcome increase in
H03  46 the provision of supplementary reading material. ^The co-operation of
H03  47 educational publishers in meeting the demand for more modern and more
H03  48 attractive books is much appreciated. ^Library facilities in modern
H03  49 languages vary greatly from school to school. ^In some schools only a
H03  50 few dictionaries and reference books are available, while in others
H03  51 there is an ample supply of suitable books. ^Particularly in some of
H03  52 the new schools, a stock of attractive books likely to appeal to the
H03  53 younger pupils has been built up in addition to the more usual works
H03  54 for the older pupils. ^The use of dictionaries with simple definitions
H03  55 in the foreign language seems to be growing and is to be recommended.
H03  56 ^A number of schools now spend part of their library allocation on
H03  57 subscriptions to worthwhile foreign magazines and have found that
H03  58 these prove both useful and popular.
H03  59    |^Most secondary schools possess various teaching aids such as
H03  60 wireless sets, record-players, tape-recorders, and film or film-strip
H03  61 projectors. ^Many modern language teachers make occasional use of
H03  62 these aids, but only a few use them systematically as an integral part
H03  63 of their work.
H03  64 *<*1Courses in Modern Languages*>
H03  65    |^*0Syllabuses for Certificate courses are at present being
H03  66 re-organised because of the forthcoming introduction of the new
H03  67 Ordinary grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education. ^Until now,
H03  68 in far too many schools, there has been little differentiation between
H03  69 the language courses planned for the ablest sections and those
H03  70 followed by the other sections. ^Where a difference has been made, it
H03  71 has often been no more than that the lowest sections in any given year
H03  72 have been allowed to proceed at a rather slower speed but with no
H03  73 modification of the content of the course or of the methods used. ^It
H03  74 seems unlikely that schools will meantime make fundamental changes in
H03  75 the modern language syllabuses designed for their ablest pupils, but
H03  76 already more courses are being planned specifically to meet the needs
H03  77 of those pupils who, at least in the first instance, are unlikely to
H03  78 pursue the study of a language to the highest level. ^This
H03  79 diversification of syllabuses is welcome. ^It can be carried out all
H03  80 the more easily now that few schools set a common examination for all
H03  81 the classes in each year and there is in consequence no longer any
H03  82 necessity for all groups to attempt to cover exactly the same work in
H03  83 the same time. ^If more suitable courses are developed, it is to be
H03  84 hoped that many of those pupils who at present are discouraged by
H03  85 their inability to keep abreast of the work set may find it possible
H03  86 to continue their language study with profit.
H03  87    |^In some junior secondary schools and departments the syllabus has
H03  88 been essentially the same as if the pupils were to become candidates
H03  89 for the Scottish Leaving Certificate examination and it has proved
H03  90 much too difficult for the pupils concerned. ^In a number of others,
H03  91 however, there has been an encouraging effort to develop
H03  92 non-examination courses which would be more in keeping with the needs
H03  93 and interests of the pupils. ^Much has been done to awaken interest in
H03  94 the foreign country. ^The approach to the language itself has been
H03  95 lively, good use being made of activity methods and of whatever
H03  96 ancillary aids were available. ^The main emphasis has been placed on
H03  97 learning to understand the spoken and written language and to speak it
H03  98 simply but naturally. ^The results in classes following such courses
H03  99 suggest that further experiment along these and similar lines would
H03 100 prove rewarding. ^It is possible that some of the pupils in these
H03 101 classes may continue at school and sit the Ordinary grade of the
H03 102 Scottish Certificate of Education. ^The type of course they have been
H03 103 following should form a sound basis for Ordinary grade studies
H03 104 provided the pupils have the necessary linguistic ability to proceed
H03 105 to the examination.
H03 106 *<*1The Work of the Schools*>
H03 107    |^*0If one considers as a whole the work done in modern languages
H03 108 in Scottish schools during the last few years, there is no doubt that
H03 109 the most significant advance has been in the field of understanding by
H03 110 ear and speaking the foreign language. ^This does not mean that there
H03 111 is no room for further improvement, but certainly much has already
H03 112 been accomplished. ^The progress in this aspect of language learning
H03 113 is most noticeable in the ready understanding and willing response of
H03 114 pupils in the early years of both junior and senior secondary schools
H03 115 and again in the fluency and confidence with which some of the pupils
H03 116 from the highest classes express themselves when they go abroad and in
H03 117 their general ability to profit from these visits. ^On the other hand,
H03 118 the most disappointing part of the course in a considerable number of
H03 119 schools is the period preceding the Scottish Leaving Certificate
H03 120 examination. ^This is probably due to two factors. ^In the first
H03 121 place, many pupils have initially been pushed on too rapidly, with the
H03 122 result that much of the basic work has not been adequately
H03 123 consolidated and the weaknesses become more evident as the course
H03 124 proceeds. ^In the second place, many teachers are not convinced that
H03 125 the methods they have been using in the early years can lead to good
H03 126 examination results, and they therefore discard them in favour of more
H03 127 traditional methods. ^In consequence of this abrupt change, much of
H03 128 the valuable work done in the first two years is lost and the results
H03 129 obtained are generally far from commensurate with the effort expended
H03 130 by both teachers and pupils. ^This is fortunately not true of all
H03 131 schools. ^Where there has been adequate consolidation and development
H03 132 of the work has been uninterrupted throughout the course, the pupils
H03 133 have shown that the examination is well within their reach and have in
H03 134 addition usually developed a genuine interest in both the language and
H03 135 the country.
H03 136    |^In order to give a more detailed appraisal of the work done in
H03 137 modern language courses, it is convenient to consider separately the
H03 138 different facets of language study. ^Nevertheless it must be
H03 139 emphasized that, if language teaching is to be successful, there can
H03 140 be no question of dividing up the work into rigid compartments. ^It is
H03 141 essential that all activities should be closely integrated so that the
H03 142 language always remains a living entity.
H03 143    |^As has already been indicated, there have been significant
H03 144 advances in the *1oral *0and *1aural *0aspects of language teaching in
H03 145 the early years of the course. ^The initial training in pronunciation
H03 146 is usually carefully given and practised. ^Syllabification and the
H03 147 typical intonation of the foreign language, however, are rarely taught
H03 148 with equal thoroughness, so that what is said often sounds less
H03 149 convincing than it otherwise would. ^Instruction in many schools is,
H03 150 in the early stages, based on the regular use of the spoken language
H03 151 in class and on oral practice of common vocabulary and speech
H03 152 patterns. ^By the end of the second year, pupils in these schools show
H03 153 a pleasing ability to understand the spoken language and some
H03 154 confidence in speaking it within the limits of their naturally
H03 155 restricted vocabulary. ^These results are all the more praiseworthy
H03 156 because it is in these early years that the teachers frequently have
H03 157 to contend with very large numbers of pupils in each class.
H03 158    |^In the later years the pupils continue to develop their
H03 159 understanding of the spoken language and seem to find this one of the
H03 160 most enjoyable parts of their language work. ^Sometimes too much time
H03 161 is spent on aural comprehension as a separate activity, but more and
H03 162 more teachers are discarding this practice since they have realized
H03 163 that, if they regularly use the spoken language in class and
H03 164 occasionally read aloud a short passage from the reading book or some
H03 165 other text, they do not require to devote much time to formal tests of
H03 166 aural comprehension. ^Practice in listening to new voices is given in
H03 167 a considerable number of schools by the use of broadcast lessons and
H03 168 with the help of the foreign assistant. ^These lessons are most
H03 169 effective if they are not isolated from the rest of the work but are
H03 170 followed up in later lessons, and used, for example, as a basis for
H03 171 conversation, vocabulary work, or free composition.
H03 172    |^The initial oral training is too rarely continued and developed
H03 173 in the later stages and many pupils do not progress beyond the
H03 174 standard of speech they had reached by the end of the second year.
H03 175 ^Many teachers feel that they cannot afford the time necessary for the
H03 176 development of oral work, but in most cases it is not additional time
H03 177 which is required so much as more systematic and purposeful training
H03 178 in the correct use of more difficult speech forms. ^For example, the
H03 179 time which is so often spent on cursory and frequently inaccurate oral
H03 180 reading of long passages could be better applied to developing the
H03 181 pupils' command of the spoken language and to bringing into regular
H03 182 use some of the new structures and vocabulary that occur in the
H03 183 various texts studied. ^Such oral practice serves to promote oral
H03 184 fluency and accuracy and at the same time it paves the way for a
H03 185 corresponding development of written work. ^Not only is bright,
H03 186 vigorous oral teaching beneficial in widening the knowledge of the
H03 187 language, but it also has a most stimulating effect on the pupils'
H03 188 morale and willingness to learn.
H03 189    |^One other aspect of oral work*- the memorization and speaking of
H03 190 prose and verse*- tends to be considered by many teachers as quite
H03 191 extraneous to the normal class work. ^Some teachers, however, are
H03 192 making good use in the earlier years of the learning by heart of
H03 193 short, carefully chosen passages from the course-book or the reader or
H03 194 of short dramatic scenes as a means of consolidating new points of
H03 195 grammar, of increasing vocabulary, and of encouraging correctness and
H03 196 fluency of speech.

H04   2 ^*0Nevertheless, average net family income was appreciably higher in
H04   3 families with several children than in those with only one, many of
H04   4 which were incomplete families of younger parents with lower earnings,
H04   5 and of course with lower tax reliefs and no family allowances. ^The
H04   6 rise in net family incomes between 1954 and 1959 was greatest for
H04   7 childless couples, especially older couples (probably because of the
H04   8 increase in retirement pensions), and somewhat greater in small than
H04   9 in large families.
H04  10 *<*4Expenditure and Consumption*>
H04  11    |^69. *0Table 24 gives indices of domestic food expenditure per
H04  12 head and quantities purchased by older and younger couples and
H04  13 families with different numbers of children, with 1954 as the base
H04  14 year. ^The quantity index was calculated by dividing the expenditure
H04  15 index by a price index of the *"Fisher Ideal**" type, constructed for
H04  16 each group separately. ^The quantity index is thus confined to food
H04  17 purchases and takes no account of changes in free supplies. ^Compared
H04  18 with 1958, the expenditure index for 1959 showed increases of 4 to 6
H04  19 per cent for couples without children and those with one child, and
H04  20 much smaller changes for couples with several children. ^The quantity
H04  21 index, which has risen only slowly since 1956, was almost unchanged in
H04  22 1959 for couples with two or more children, but rose by 3 per cent in
H04  23 the older two-adult households and by 1-2 per cent for younger
H04  24 childless couples and couples with one child.
H04  25 **[TABLE**]
H04  26    |^*470. *0Table 27 gives the total domestic food expenditure and
H04  27 value of consumption per person per week in 1959 in households of
H04  28 different composition. ^Percentage standard errors of these estimates
H04  29 are given in Table 10 of Appendix A. ^All types of household spent
H04  30 more than in the previous year except families with three children,
H04  31 whose expenditure had risen sharply in 1958. ^The increases ranged
H04  32 from 2\0s. 7\0d. per person per week in the residual group of
H04  33 households with adolescents but no children and 1\0s. 8\0d. in older
H04  34 two-adult households to 4\0d. in the families with two and with four
H04  35 or more children. ^The value of free food was greatest (1\0s. 2\0d. to
H04  36 1\0s. 4\0d. per person per week) in the five types of household
H04  37 containing no children, and varied between 9\0d. and 11\0d. in
H04  38 households with children, except in the largest families for which the
H04  39 average was only 5\0d., as in 1958. ^In families with three children,
H04  40 the slight fall in expenditure was made good by an increase in the
H04  41 value of free food. ^The value of consumption per person per week in
H04  42 1959 ranged from 41\0s. 7\0d. for younger childless couples to 19\0s.
H04  43 5\0d. in families with four or more children; in 1958 the range was
H04  44 from 40\0s. 3\0d. to 19\0s. 1\0d.
H04  45    |^*471. *0Table 27 includes an index comparing the *"price of
H04  46 energy**" for the various types of household with that for all
H04  47 households in the sample. ^As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12
H04  48 1/2 per cent more per calorie than the national average, and families
H04  49 with four or more children 19 per cent less. ^The only substantial
H04  50 change was in families with three children, for whom the index
H04  51 declined from 91 to 88. ^Table 27 also shows the corresponding values
H04  52 of an index which compares the prices paid by different types of
H04  53 household for the commodities constituting the average household diet
H04  54 in 1959. ^For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the
H04  55 national average in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below
H04  56 in families with four or more children, compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per
H04  57 cent in 1958 and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957. ^As with the price of
H04  58 energy index, the only noteworthy change was for households with three
H04  59 children, in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the
H04  60 average for all households in the sample. ^The price ranges for milk,
H04  61 cheese, sugar, bread and flour were very narrow. ^For most other foods
H04  62 younger childless couples paid the highest average prices and large
H04  63 families the lowest, the price gradients being steepest for carcase
H04  64 meat (+7 to -7 per cent), *"other**" fish (+8 to -11), *"other**"
H04  65 vegetables (+9 to -9) and beverages other than tea (+12 to -16).
H04  66    |^*472. *0Details of expenditure and consumption per head are given
H04  67 in Tables 28 and 29. ^Most groups obtained slightly less liquid milk
H04  68 than in 1958, the greatest decrease (from 5.24 to 5.08 pints per head
H04  69 per week) occurring in younger two-adult households. ^Table 25
H04  70 summarizes the changes in consumption of liquid milk (including
H04  71 welfare and school milk) between 1954 and 1959 by this group and by
H04  72 classified households containing children or adolescents. ^Consumption
H04  73 by younger childless couples declined throughout this period, but that
H04  74 of the smaller families was maintained except for the slight fall in
H04  75 1959. ^In the largest families, particularly those containing four or
H04  76 more children, there was a tendency for consumption to increase
H04  77 between 1955 and 1957, and thereafter to decline. ^Graduated scales of
H04  78 family allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare
H04  79 milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957. ^Despite appreciably higher
H04  80 average prices for natural cheese in 1959 than in the previous year,
H04  81 consumption fell only slightly in most groups; the decrease was
H04  82 greatest (from 3.68 \0oz. to 3.20 \0oz. per head per week) for younger
H04  83 childless couples, who transferred much of their demand to cheaper
H04  84 varieties.
H04  85 **[TABLE**]
H04  86    |^*473. *0All groups, except families containing three or more
H04  87 children, increased their expenditure on meat, but total consumption
H04  88 was much the same as in 1958, although there was some replacement of
H04  89 beef (which continued to be in short supply) by mutton and lamb. ^All
H04  90 groups spent more on fish, and most increased their consumption,
H04  91 particularly of canned fish. ^Eggs were cheaper than in the previous
H04  92 year and consumption increased in nearly all groups despite fewer free
H04  93 supplies.
H04  94    |^*474. *0All types of household substituted margarine for butter
H04  95 in 1959 because of higher butter prices, but all except the largest
H04  96 families continued to buy more butter than margarine. ^Total
H04  97 consumption of butter and margarine declined only in households
H04  98 containing children. ^The displacement of margarine by butter in 1958,
H04  99 when butter was exceptionally cheap, appears to have had some lasting
H04 100 effect; the average price of butter in 1959 was higher than in 1957,
H04 101 yet butter purchases in 1959, although smaller than in 1958, were
H04 102 greater than in 1957 except in families with four or more children or
H04 103 with adolescents but no children.
H04 104    |^*475. *0The smaller families and the residual groups of
H04 105 households containing children reduced their consumption of sugar and
H04 106 of preserves, but in all other types of household a decline in
H04 107 purchases of the one was accompanied by an increase in consumption of
H04 108 the other.
H04 109    |^*476. *0Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in the
H04 110 previous year, but consumption was maintained except in families with
H04 111 more than one child and in the unclassified households with children
H04 112 or adolescents. ^All groups except families with four or more children
H04 113 or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
H04 114 vegetables, especially in the first half of the year, although most
H04 115 reduced their consumption of other vegetables. ^Purchases of
H04 116 quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extremely wide
H04 117 group differences persisted, the averages ranging from 0.1 \0oz. per
H04 118 head per week in families with four or more children to 0.9 \0oz. per
H04 119 head in younger two-adult households; average consumption by older
H04 120 couples and other wholly-adult households was 0.5 \0oz. per head per
H04 121 week. ^The two latter groups consumed much smaller quantities per head
H04 122 of canned vegetables and canned and bottled tomatoes than any other
H04 123 group, and much smaller quantities of canned and bottled fruit than
H04 124 younger childless couples; in households containing children,
H04 125 consumption of canned fruit fell off sharply with increasing family
H04 126 size, but there was no regular gradation in purchases of canned
H04 127 vegetables and canned tomatoes. ^All types of household benefited from
H04 128 the improved supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared with
H04 129 1958, but the increase in consumption was least in families containing
H04 130 children.
H04 131    |^*477. *0Total bread consumption was virtually unchanged, although
H04 132 most types of household bought less white bread and more rolls and
H04 133 speciality breads than in 1958. ^Most groups increased their purchases
H04 134 of puddings, cakes and biscuits, but obtained less flour.
H04 135    |^*478. *0Regression estimates of the expenditure on different
H04 136 commodities attributable to the adult couple and each additional child
H04 137 in a selected group of households consisting of childless couples
H04 138 (both under 55) and couples with different numbers of children were
H04 139 given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of the Annual Report for 1956. ^The
H04 140 younger childless couples are broadly comparable in age and family
H04 141 income with the family households, so that differences in food
H04 142 expenditure may be associated with the presence of children. ^The
H04 143 analysis has been repeated for 1957, 1958 and 1959, but the results
H04 144 will not be given {6*1in extenso}. ^*0Household food expenditure in
H04 145 1959 averaged 80\0s. 9\0d. for younger couples and 92\0s. 10\0d.,
H04 146 102\0s. 0\0d., 111\0s. 9\0d., and 126\0s. 3\0d. for two-adult
H04 147 households containing respectively one, two, three and four or more
H04 148 (average 4.64) children under 15. ^From a straight regression line
H04 149 fitted to these averages, the basic element in household food
H04 150 expenditure associated with the adult couple is estimated at 81\0s.
H04 151 11\0d. and the average increment for each additional child as 9\0s.
H04 152 11\0d. ^Table 26 gives similar regression estimates for previous
H04 153 years. ^The effects of price rises are roughly eliminated by
H04 154 expressing the average expenditure associated with a child as a
H04 155 percentage of that associated with an adult couple. ^The relative
H04 156 expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956, but rose in 1957
H04 157 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried milk was reduced; since
H04 158 1957 it has again declined. ^Most of the average expenditure
H04 159 associated with a child was on cereal foods, potatoes and milk; for
H04 160 fresh green vegetables, fruit, cheese, fish and carcase meat, the
H04 161 incremental expenditure was slight.

H04 163 *<*4Energy Value and Nutrient Content*>
H04 164    |^79. *0Table 30 shows the energy value and nutrient content of the
H04 165 diets of households of different composition. ^The averages showed
H04 166 little change compared with those for the previous year, except for
H04 167 generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D. ^Since physiological
H04 168 requirements vary widely with age, sex and level of activity,
H04 169 comparisons between families of different composition are only
H04 170 apposite when considered in relation to needs.
H04 171    |^*480. *0Estimates of the adequacy of the diets, assessed by
H04 172 comparison with allowances based on the recommendations of the British
H04 173 Medical Association, are also shown in Table 30. ^In comparison with
H04 174 the previous year, changes were small except for higher estimates for
H04 175 vitamin C. ^In families with four or more children the levels of
H04 176 adequacy for all nutrients other than vitamin C decreased slightly.
H04 177 ^For this fairly small group, comparisons between different years
H04 178 cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a defined number of
H04 179 children. ^In 1959 the households in this group contained slightly
H04 180 more children (average 4.64) than in the previous year (average 4.53).
H04 181 ^Their total food expenditure increased less than that in other
H04 182 groups, and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish,
H04 183 poultry, eggs, canned vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate biscuits and
H04 184 breakfast cereals which, in general, are more expensive sources of
H04 185 nutrients than those foods of which they purchased less, namely dried
H04 186 milk, potatoes, carcase meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat
H04 187 products.
H04 188    |^*481. *0In all these estimates of adequacy, the conventional
H04 189 allowance of 10 per cent has been made for wastage of edible food.
H04 190 ^The limitations of the use of arbitrary wastage factors, regardless
H04 191 of family size or circumstances, were pointed out, and the effect of
H04 192 the use of graduated wastage factors examined in the Annual Report for
H04 193 1956. ^As in previous years, the percentages in Table 30 for all
H04 194 nutrients decreased with increasing family size. ^The lowest estimates
H04 195 were for protein and calcium in families with four or more children
H04 196 (82 and 81 per cent respectively). ^During the ten years from 1950 to
H04 197 1959 there were downward trends in the percentages for protein and
H04 198 calcium for all types of family and for all households, the steepest
H04 199 (from 94 to 82 per cent for protein and, from 92 to 81 per cent for
H04 200 calcium) occurring for the families with four or more children;
H04 201 another considerable fall was from 91 to 83 per cent for protein in
H04 202 families with adolescents and children.

H05   1 **[269 TEXT H05**]
H05   2 ^*0The war damage may, however, be made good by works which include
H05   3 alterations and additions. ^It is a feature of the system that no cost
H05   4 of works payment is made until the work has been carried out, although
H05   5 instalments can be paid by arrangement in large projects as the work
H05   6 proceeds. ^The intention behind the legislation was to insure that the
H05   7 money should be used for reinstatement wherever it was possible and
H05   8 economic to do so and should be paid no sooner and no later than was
H05   9 necessary for this purpose.
H05  10    |^4. If the war damage is not made good a value payment under
H05  11 Section 13 of the 1943 Act (conveniently known as a *"converted value
H05  12 payment**") may be paid. ^This payment is equal to the amount of the
H05  13 difference between the March 1939 values of the property before damage
H05  14 and after damage, taking account in the value after damage of the
H05  15 value of any repairs for which the Commission have already made cost
H05  16 of works payments. ^This basic value payment is increased (in current
H05  17 jargon, *"escalated**") by forty-five or sixty per \0cent. and
H05  18 interest at two and a half per \0cent. {6per annum} from the date of
H05  19 damage is added to the value payment as escalated. ^This escalation
H05  20 was authorised by the War Damage (Increase of Value Payments) Order
H05  21 1947 ({0S.R.&O.}, \0No. 390). ^In their exercise of the discretion
H05  22 given by the Order to the Commission to pay up to sixty per \0cent.,
H05  23 the Commission pay the higher percentage where the owner is prevented
H05  24 by planning considerations from making good the damage or where he
H05  25 redevelops the site in a form which cannot be accepted as making good
H05  26 with alterations and additions and so cannot be the subject of a cost
H05  27 of works payment.
H05  28    |^5. Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission are
H05  29 highway payments, clearance payments (for clearing remains of
H05  30 structures from *"total loss**" sites) and church payments. ^Although
H05  31 differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of works
H05  32 payments, the sums paid under these heads have the common feature that
H05  33 they are all payments in respect of works which have been carried out.
H05  34    |^6. The Commission received notifications that war damage had been
H05  35 sustained in respect of over three and a half million properties.
H05  36 ^They have paid over four million claims for the cost of making good
H05  37 war damage (in many cases more than one claim is necessary because
H05  38 reinstatement is not wholly carried out in one operation). ^The total
H05  39 so far for cost of works and the analogous payments is a little over
H05  40 *+1,000 million and the total for value payments (of which there were
H05  41 about 180,000) is a little over *+250 million. ^As against this about
H05  42 *+200 million was collected by the Inland Revenue Department in the
H05  43 period 1941-46 in the form of statutory *"contributions**" under the
H05  44 War Damage Act from property owners. ^The total amount paid out by the
H05  45 Commission in each of the last five years is as follows:
H05  46 **[TABLE**]
H05  47 ^The largest amount paid out in any one year was *+220 million in the
H05  48 year to 31st March, 1948.
H05  49 *<*4Outstanding liability to make payments*>
H05  50    |^*07. Under the present system it must be left to owners of
H05  51 properties for which cost of works payments are appropriate to carry
H05  52 out the repairs or rebuilding when they wish to do so and make their
H05  53 claims thereafter. ^It has not been possible to make any accurate or
H05  54 exhaustive record of the extent of the work which still remains to be
H05  55 done at any particular date. ^There is a vast volume of files far too
H05  56 large for examination by a normal sized staff and in any case owners
H05  57 were not at the time of notifying damage required (indeed, would not
H05  58 have been able) to give details of the repairs that would ultimately
H05  59 be necessary. ^There is at present no power to compel owners to carry
H05  60 out the work; nor would the Commission's records enable them to
H05  61 identify the properties still in need of repair or rebuilding even if
H05  62 they had the power to hasten the work. ^The actual direction and
H05  63 execution of the work are matters for the owner and his advisers and
H05  64 contractors. ^The Commission's statutory duty is to reimburse the cost
H05  65 incurred, so far as reasonable, and they are not a party to any of the
H05  66 contracts for the repair of war damage. ^It is considered probable
H05  67 that the cost of carrying out all the outstanding repairs would not
H05  68 exceed *+40 million but this is a rough estimate for which no exact
H05  69 basis exists. ^The actual figure might be well above this or much
H05  70 less. ^There are, however, good reasons for believing that there are
H05  71 about 90 properties (including churches, town halls, factories,
H05  72 \0etc.) in which the cost of the outstanding works may be expected to
H05  73 exceed *+50,000 (a few claims may exceed this amount by a very large
H05  74 sum) and that the total for those properties alone may amount to some
H05  75 *+15 million.
H05  76    |^8. The reasons given by owners for their failure or inability to
H05  77 carry out reinstatement are various. ^Uncertainty about development
H05  78 plans and the intentions of local authorities with regard to
H05  79 acquisition is a major cause; and in some large organisations,
H05  80 particularly among local authorities, there has been a degree of
H05  81 hesitancy about the general reinstatement policy that has delayed
H05  82 considerably the making good of war damage. ^Some owners say they have
H05  83 no money for the ordinary maintenance work which would have to be
H05  84 carried out along with the war damage repairs. ^Where properties are
H05  85 held on lease with a relatively short term unexpired the repairs have
H05  86 in some cases been deferred because the lessee did not wish to carry
H05  87 out the works. ^Illness, old age or a general reluctance to having
H05  88 workmen on the premises has prevented a minority of householders from
H05  89 completing repairs. ^Whatever the reasons for delay in claiming, the
H05  90 Government are anxious to ensure that all who have an entitlement
H05  91 should be given every reasonable opportunity to secure it, and, if
H05  92 there is to be a closing down, they are determined that no one shall
H05  93 be able to complain of any lack of notice. ^Indeed, one of the prime
H05  94 purposes of this White Paper is to draw the attention of all
H05  95 interested persons, whether private owners, church authorities, local
H05  96 government officers or company officials responsible for the
H05  97 management of property, and of professional advisors in general to the
H05  98 need for making immediate arrangements for negotiation with the War
H05  99 Damage Commission about the extent of the damage, with a view to
H05 100 putting the outstanding war damage repairs in hand as soon as possible
H05 101 or, where the repairs are not to be carried out, claiming a converted
H05 102 value payment.
H05 103    |^9. In addition to the payments system for land and buildings
H05 104 described above the War Damage Act, 1943, provided in Part *=2 for two
H05 105 insurance schemes administered by the Board of Trade:*-
H05 106    |(a) A business chattels scheme to cover plant and machinery; and
H05 107    |(b) A private chattels scheme to cover household and commercial
H05 108 chattels.
H05 109    |^Payments were on an insured value basis and were not related to
H05 110 replacement costs. ^Under (*1a*0) about *+77 million was collected in
H05 111 premiums and *+93 million has been paid out in claims; under (*1b*0)
H05 112 about *+16 million was collected in premiums and *+116 million has
H05 113 been paid out in claims. ^Every householder was entitled to a certain
H05 114 amount of free cover (for example up to *+350 for a married man with
H05 115 two children) and it is estimated that if the effect of this is
H05 116 allowed for the claim payments would be more in line with the premiums
H05 117 collected. ^In addition to the actual amounts paid on losses accrued
H05 118 interest at two and a half per \0cent. paid to claimants on the
H05 119 amounts due under both schemes has accounted for about *+21 million to
H05 120 date. ^The date for final payments under the private chattels scheme
H05 121 was fixed at 14th July, 1947, and under the business chattels scheme
H05 122 at 1st October, 1953, but a certain number of claims remain unpaid
H05 123 (for example because the claimant could not be traced) and are thought
H05 124 to amount to about *+1,120,000 plus accrued interest at two and a half
H05 125 per \0cent.
H05 126 *<*4Government Proposal to make a Final Settlement*>
H05 127    |^*010. The justification for the winding-up of the system at this
H05 128 date and the abolition of the War Damage Commission is self-evident.
H05 129 ^It becomes increasingly difficult, year by year, to distinguish
H05 130 between genuine war damage and ordinary dilapidation through lack of
H05 131 maintenance. ^It probably comes as a surprise to many people to know
H05 132 that the War Damage Commission is still in existence, that payments
H05 133 are still being made and, even to those who are aware that the system
H05 134 lingers on, to know what the possible total of outstanding liability
H05 135 is. ^The Government's view is that after the passage of sixteen years
H05 136 since the end of the war it would be fair to require owners to begin
H05 137 the outstanding repairs at once and if for any reason they are unable
H05 138 to do so to give them the same payment (a converted value payment,
H05 139 that is) as has already been given to the many owners who applied for
H05 140 such a payment and satisfied the Commission that for one reason or
H05 141 another they were unable or unwilling to make good the war damage.
H05 142 ^The Act of 1943 long ago substantially achieved its original
H05 143 objective of getting owners to reinstate their damaged properties
H05 144 expeditiously and without the risk of the inflation which the issue on
H05 145 a grand scale of cash payments for the properties which were not total
H05 146 losses would have caused. ^The time has now come to get the remaining
H05 147 work done quickly or to give owners a payment to encourage them
H05 148 instead to make a different and perhaps better use of their property.
H05 149 *<*4The Main Provisions of a Closure Operation*>
H05 150    |^*011. It is considered essential that the winding up should be
H05 151 done in two stages with two statutory time limits:
H05 152 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H05 153    |^(1) A registration date for giving notice of an intended claim
H05 154 for payment and of outstanding war damage, after which date no notice
H05 155 of claim in respect of any additional works will be admitted. ^This
H05 156 provision is designed to stimulate owners to take action, to put a
H05 157 barrier to the flow of claims which might otherwise trickle on almost
H05 158 indefinitely, and to inform the Commission of the approximate total
H05 159 liability which remains to be met. ^(2) A closing date for executing
H05 160 any *"registered**" war repairs which owners are willing and able to
H05 161 carry out at once, for the negotiation and payment of the resulting
H05 162 claims and for the negotiation and payment of converted value payments
H05 163 where there is no intention or prospect of the work being carried out
H05 164 during the post-registration statutory period.
H05 165 **[END INDENTATION**]
H05 166    |^In short, the most practical and fair method is to eliminate all
H05 167 future claims after due notice by providing for registration,
H05 168 including registration of work already in hand, and then allow a
H05 169 further limited period for the orderly disposal of the registered
H05 170 works in consultation with the Commission.
H05 171    |^12. Except so far as modifications are necessitated by the
H05 172 closure, the existing principles and structure of the War Damage Act,
H05 173 1943, will be preserved. ^The comparative absence of criticism during
H05 174 the past 20 years testifies to the aptness of the original provisions
H05 175 and to the good quality of the administration. ^The advantages of
H05 176 continuity, when it does not conflict with the main purpose, cannot be
H05 177 over-estimated. ^Administration on well established and
H05 178 uncontroversial lines for the benefit of owners and professional men
H05 179 who have come to expect and accept certain procedures will undoubtedly
H05 180 help to effect a smooth running-down of the machine, a running-down
H05 181 which has in fact been in progress for some time, but which must now
H05 182 be given the promise of finality.
H05 183    |^13. The following paragraphs contain a brief account of the
H05 184 measures proposed to effect a winding-up of the system by means of an
H05 185 amendment of the War Damage Act, 1943. ^These measures were
H05 186 foreshadowed in the statement by its Financial Secretary to the
H05 187 Treasury quoted at the beginning of this paper.

H06   3    |^*0To provide fuller information about certain types of dangerous

H06   5 notification of certain specified occurrences to {0H.M.} District
H06   6 Inspectors of Factories, whether or not they result in injury.
H06   7 ^Appendix *=20 gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in

H06   9 the heading to the Appendix.
H06  10    |^The total number of dangerous occurrences reported during the
H06  11 year was 1,409, an increase of 111 over the total for 1959. ^However,
H06  12 the number of notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell
H06  13 from 252 (31 of them fatal) in 1959 to 245 (22 fatal) in 1960.
H06  14    |^The main increase in the numbers of occurrences reported occurred
H06  15 in the category of those due to the collapse or failure of a crane,
H06  16 derrick, winch or hoist, where there was an increase of almost
H06  17 one-third from 335 to 438. ^This increase was common to factories,

H06  22 Section 3 of the Lead Paint (Protection Against Poisoning Act), 1926,
H06  23 together with comparable figures for earlier years, is given in
H06  24 Appendix *=21. ^The total number of cases notified during the year was
H06  25 569, compared with 532 in 1959; the number of deaths remains unchanged
H06  26 at 10. ^Cases of chrome ulceration increased from 192 to 298, but
H06  27 reportable cases of epitheliomatous ulceration decreased from 226
H06  28 (nine of them fatal) in 1959 to 173 (six fatal) in 1960. ^The total of
H06  29 19 cases of this disease due to mineral oil is the smallest number in
H06  30 that category for the last 10 years.
H06  31    |^Appendix *=22 records the number of accidents involving gassing
H06  32 in 1960, together with the figures for previous years. ^Both the total
H06  33 number of accidents (222) and the number of deaths (20) were greater
H06  34 than in the previous two years.

H06  42 statutory examinations of young persons for certificates of fitness
H06  43 carried out by Appointed Factory Doctors, together with the causes of
H06  44 rejection. ^These examinations numbered 500,984 in 1960, an increase

H06  64 *<*6*=1. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS*>
H06  65 *<*2A. ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENTS*>
H06  66 *<*1Electricity Supply*- General Developments*>
H06  67    |^*0The demand for electricity continues to double every 10 years.
H06  68 ^Such a rate of growth demands the addition of large quantities of new
H06  69 plant annually and, in order to save expense and space, a great
H06  70 increase in the size of individual units: generating sets of up to 550
H06  71 \0MW and transmission systems to operate at 500 \0KV are now being
H06  72 designed.
H06  73    |^The speed of technical progress leaves designers with less
H06  74 opportunity to modify designs on the basis of working experience; the
H06  75 more exacting planning requirements are being met by the increased use
H06  76 of computers and other aids. ^Automatic torque angle control has been
H06  77 introduced on the new large generators, whose safe operation at the
H06  78 extreme limit of stability would be beyond the capacity of the human
H06  79 operator. ^Difficult problems of protection under fault conditions
H06  80 have also to be tackled by Area and Distribution engineers as a result
H06  81 of the heavy concentration of power at sub-stations.
H06  82 *<*1Problems Involved in the Operation of Steam Turbo-Generators*>
H06  83    |^*0In order to provide continuity of electricity supply from large
H06  84 turbo-generators running in parallel, designers and operating
H06  85 engineers must understand both the balance between steam utilisation
H06  86 and electrical output and the influence of the connected electrical
H06  87 system upon the running speed and operational stability of the
H06  88 generator.
H06  89    |^On several occasions this balance has been seriously disturbed,
H06  90 {0e.g.}, by the failure of the turbine governor gear immediately to
H06  91 reduce steam supply to compensate for a sudden loss in electrical
H06  92 load. ^Consequently speed has risen rapidly beyond the designed
H06  93 maximum, even with a centrifugal governor operating the steam through
H06  94 an oil hydraulic system and backed by an emergency governor.
H06  95 ^Centrifugal forces are capable of causing the turbine to disintegrate
H06  96 with serious damage to buildings and even loss of life.
H06  97    |^Research and development have been undertaken to reduce these
H06  98 hazards, which can be expected to become more serious as
H06  99 turbo-generators increase in power. ^Modern turbines are provided with
H06 100 anticipatory gear to detect and to correct instantly any violent rise
H06 101 in speed as with means of testing and checking the freedom of movement
H06 102 of the governor mechanism without taking the machine off load. ^In the
H06 103 unit system, where boiler, turbine and ancillary plant are integrated,
H06 104 controls are located in a single operations room under the supervision
H06 105 of a co-ordinated team. ^Instruments, controls and alarms are so
H06 106 grouped that quick reference can be made to both steam and electrical
H06 107 conditions. ^Wherever possible the principles of
H06 108 *"failure-to-safety**" or *"back-up protection**" have been
H06 109 incorporated in the design.
H06 110 *<*1Developments in Electronic Engineering*>
H06 111    |^*0Some of the more outstanding recent advances have been in the
H06 112 field of semi-conductor engineering. ^The advantages of
H06 113 semi-conductors are absence of moving parts, an indefinitely long life
H06 114 without maintenance and extreme versatility of function*- including
H06 115 measurement, amplification, instrumentation, control, rectification,
H06 116 inversion and switching. ^Generally these devices tend to promote
H06 117 safety by their innate characteristics and reliability; they also
H06 118 enable many new safety devices to be designed; electromagnetic relays
H06 119 with mercury-wetted contacts are now available with a life-expectancy
H06 120 of hundreds of millions of contact operations and at the same time the
H06 121 robustness and reliability of electronic valves have been greatly
H06 122 improved.
H06 123    |^Progress in *"miniaturisation**", also partly dependent upon
H06 124 semi-conductor techniques, can be expected to contribute to industrial
H06 125 safety in due course and eventually to make possible the construction
H06 126 of self-adjusting*- monitoring*- correcting and maintaining mechanisms
H06 127 of unprecedented reliability.
H06 128 *<*1The Use of Electricity on Constructional Sites*>
H06 129    |^*0In 1960 approximately one-eighth of all electrical accidents,
H06 130 including one-third of the fatalities, occurred on building and
H06 131 constructional engineering sites covered by the Factories Acts. ^The
H06 132 largest group of these was caused by portable electrical apparatus and
H06 133 its associated flexible cables and accessories, the next largest group
H06 134 was caused by other types of wiring. ^Interesting developments are
H06 135 taking place on some of these sites with a view to reducing the risk
H06 136 of electrical accident, {0e.g.}:*-
H06 137 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H06 138    |^(**=1) In the construction of multi-storey buildings, rising
H06 139 mains at 415/240-\0V are installed in the form of cable so situated as
H06 140 to be protected against casual damage and 240-\0V single-phase
H06 141 supplies are tapped successively on to the various floors. ^This is
H06 142 economical and ensures that not more than one phase is available on
H06 143 any one floor during the work. ^Local voltage reduction by
H06 144 single-phase transformers on each floor is then installed for the
H06 145 period of the job.
H06 146    |^(**=2) An alternative arrangement is to follow up the building
H06 147 work from floor to floor with a supply of carcase wiring sufficient
H06 148 for the operations, thus reducing to a minimum the amount of flexible
H06 149 and temporary wiring. ^Voltage reduction is then used on each floor.
H06 150    |^(**=3) With transportable machines which are too large for single
H06 151 phase-motor drives, the practice of using three-phase motors with
H06 152 voltage reduction is growing. ^A transformer with a secondary output
H06 153 at 110-\0V, three-phase with earthed neutral point gives a voltage to
H06 154 earth of approximately 64-\0V, a value likely to be safe in all but
H06 155 the most exceptional circumstances.
H06 156    |^(**=4) A common system of festoon wiring found in use in lighting
H06 157 the work required the piercing of cable by sharp contacts at points
H06 158 where it was necessary to instal **[SIC**] lampholders. ^The risks of
H06 159 shock from leakage and pierced insulation made this wiring unsuitable
H06 160 for construction work. ^It is a most welcome development that makers
H06 161 are now producing an improved form with the lampholders moulded to the
H06 162 cable at such intervals as the purchaser may require.
H06 163 **[END INDENTATION**]
H06 164 *<*1Prevention of Accidents at Overhead Electric Lines*>
H06 165    |^*0The problem of accidents from contact with overhead lines
H06 166 remains serious; 107 such accidents have occurred in factories since
H06 167 1954, of which 44 have been fatal. ^While there has been some
H06 168 improvement in accidents from contact by cranes or similar machines
H06 169 the number caused by direct contact with lines*- 20, including six
H06 170 fatal ones in 1960*- has reached a level that gives cause for concern.
H06 171    |^Attempts are being made to develop equipment to fix on the crane
H06 172 which might reduce the risk of shock from contact with the line. ^The
H06 173 equipment takes two forms*- an insulating guard on the jib of the
H06 174 crane, intended to prevent direct contact with the line, and
H06 175 electronic equipment with a sensitive probe mounted slightly forward
H06 176 of the head of the jib and with electronic assembly and warning
H06 177 apparatus in the driver's cab. ^Improved designs of both forms are
H06 178 being tried out at present.
H06 179    |^There is, however, a danger that workers will rely too much on
H06 180 fixed devices because they fail to recognise their limitations. ^It is
H06 181 therefore safer both in principle and practice to keep the worker
H06 182 *1away *0from overhead lines wherever possible, {0e.g.}, by
H06 183 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H06 184    |(**=1) re-routing the line,
H06 185    |(**=2) putting the supply underground,
H06 186    |(**=3) making the line dead (after consultation with the supply
H06 187 authority),
H06 188    |(**=4) providing barriers at a safe distance to prevent vehicles
H06 189 from approaching the line, or height gauges or *"goal posts**" at
H06 190 points where vehicles must pass below the line,
H06 191    |(**=5) providing look-out men or banksmen.
H06 192 **[END INDENTATION**]
H06 193    |^It is also important to remember that on lines carrying the
H06 194 higher voltages flashover from the line may take place without actual
H06 195 contact.
H06 196 *<*2B. ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENTS*>
H06 197 *<*1Leather Industry*- Leather Rolls*>
H06 198    |^*0A new type of machine has recently been developed for the
H06 199 automatic rolling of sole leather bends. ^The sheet of leather is
H06 200 placed on a sliding feed tray outside the danger zone and is then
H06 201 pushed forward between two platens, the upper one carrying a set of
H06 202 small rollers. ^The lower platen, which supports the leather, is
H06 203 raised hydraulically to bring it into contact with the rollers on the
H06 204 upper platen, which is then caused to make several horizontal
H06 205 oscillations so that the leather is rolled and pressed at the same
H06 206 time. ^The danger zone between the platens is fenced by a guard which
H06 207 is interlocked with the hydraulic valve and the press is also
H06 208 sequentially operated: the closing of the shutter starts the machine,
H06 209 the rest of the cycle following automatically.
H06 210 *<*1Brickmaking Machinery*- New Sanding Method*>
H06 211    |^*0A new method of applying sand to the faces of green bricks has
H06 212 recently been developed. ^In the case of wire-cut bricks the column of
H06 213 clay from the pug-mill is carried by a short length of belt conveyor
H06 214 to the sanding plant. ^This consists basically of a vibrating hopper
H06 215 from which the sand is distributed to all four faces by a system of
H06 216 slots, scrapers and worms. ^The conveyor is broken at this point to
H06 217 enable the sand to be applied to the under surface of the column,
H06 218 which passes on through two pairs of vibrating rollers which embed the
H06 219 sand firmly in the surfaces and is finally cut into bricks at the wire
H06 220 cutting table.
H06 221 *# 2032
H07   1 **[271 TEXT H07**]
H07   2 ^*0Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the
H07   3 development corporations, about 20 per cent represents extensions
H07   4 built after the firms had become established.
H07   5    |^It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-rents or
H07   6 ground rents for their factories or industrial sites; and rents vary
H07   7 considerably according to the demand for factory accommodation. ^The
H07   8 average gross return on established industrial estates ranges from 7
H07   9 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land, site works and
H07  10 buildings.
H07  11    |^Manufacturing industry affords employment to large numbers of
H07  12 non-manual as well as manual workers. ^An analysis made by Crawley
H07  13 Development Corporation in 1958, after collating replies from
H07  14 fifty-eight manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff,
H07  15 showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as managerial and
H07  16 administrative, 11 per cent as technical or employed in research and
H07  17 19 per cent as clerical. ^There is no reason to suppose that this
H07  18 pattern is peculiar to Crawley.
H07  19    |^The development corporations have aimed at a varied pattern of
H07  20 industry, offering a reasonable choice of employer as well as choice
H07  21 of occupation for men, women and school-leavers, with due regard to
H07  22 the industries already established in their towns. ^Inevitably
H07  23 engineering, including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries,
H07  24 predominates in all the London new towns since these are among the
H07  25 industries which have expanded most during the last ten years in the
H07  26 country generally. ^Of those at present employed in manufacturing
H07  27 industry in the eight London new towns about 40 per cent are employed
H07  28 in engineering and electrical goods manufacture*- the proportion
H07  29 employed in both these groups combined varies from about 30 per cent
H07  30 in Welwyn to 85 per cent in Stevenage and 90 per cent in Hatfield.
H07  31 ^These figures are much higher than the national averages, and may be
H07  32 thought to indicate a lack of balance in some of the towns. ^On the
H07  33 other hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of skilled
H07  34 employment and are highly diversified as regards products, markets and
H07  35 methods of manufacture. ^Consumer goods industries such as the
H07  36 manufacture of food and drink, tobacco, clothing and footwear are
H07  37 under-represented in the new towns generally though not in Basildon
H07  38 and Welwyn.
H07  39    |^The following table indicates the size of the firms, some of them
H07  40 occupying more than one factory, introduced or sponsored by
H07  41 development corporations in the new towns:
H07  42 **[TABLE**]
H07  43    |^The overall average for the factories sponsored by development
H07  44 corporations is about 170 employees per firm, and the average for each
H07  45 of the London new towns is roughly the same except at Hatfield, where
H07  46 it is much lower, and Stevenage, where it is much higher. ^The
H07  47 position at Stevenage is accounted for by the presence of one firm
H07  48 with 3,700 employees and two others with over 1,000 employees. ^About
H07  49 32 per cent of all the workers employed in factories sponsored by the
H07  50 development corporations are employed by the eleven largest firms and
H07  51 about 23 per cent by the next group of firms employing between five
H07  52 hundred and one thousand workers.
H07  53    |^In factories sponsored by the London new town development
H07  54 corporations the proportion of female employees, expressed as a
H07  55 percentage of all employees, varies from 23 per cent in Welwyn Garden
H07  56 City and 24 per cent in Hemel Hempstead to 35 per cent in Basildon and
H07  57 55 per cent in Hatfield with an average of about 30 per cent*- rather
H07  58 less than in the country as a whole. ^The figures for Corby and
H07  59 Peterlee (where the prime need so far has been to provide employment
H07  60 for women and girls) are 82 per cent and 74 per cent respectively.
H07  61 *<*1Shops*>
H07  62    |^*0Shopping provision in the new towns has generally been based on
H07  63 an estimated need of about eight shops for every thousand people, this
H07  64 being considered sufficient to allow for shoppers coming into the town
H07  65 from surrounding areas. ^Distribution over the town as a whole varies,
H07  66 the smaller towns tending to rely mainly on the town centres with a
H07  67 few *"pantry**" shops in the neighbourhoods and the larger ones
H07  68 providing neighbourhood centres of up to thirty or more shops at the
H07  69 heart of the residential areas, as well as small sub-centres in
H07  70 outlying districts.
H07  71    |^Some development corporations have sought to attract private
H07  72 investors by leasing part of the shopping area to companies
H07  73 experienced in commercial development who have undertaken the building
H07  74 and letting of the shops. ^But corporations have generally found it
H07  75 more satisfactory to build themselves, leasing the shops direct to
H07  76 traders, with breaks in the lease to enable rents to be increased in
H07  77 scale with the rising prosperity of the town. ^This control over
H07  78 lettings also secures a balanced distribution of the type of shop, to
H07  79 meet the convenience of shoppers, and a reasonable degree of economic
H07  80 security for the individual shopkeeper.
H07  81    |^Timing has proved an important factor in the success of the
H07  82 shops. ^Too many at the start may not provide a living for the
H07  83 traders, but too few may result in failure to attract custom and the
H07  84 habit of dependence on mobile shops, essential in the early stages,
H07  85 may be slow to break if carried on too long. ^The establishment of
H07  86 open markets in the town centres has helped to bring custom to the
H07  87 shops and the initial fears of some of the shopkeepers that their
H07  88 trade would suffer have proved unfounded. ^Shopping on two levels has
H07  89 been introduced in a number of towns and has added to the interest of
H07  90 the town centre. ^All types of trader have been encouraged, from the
H07  91 large departmental store to the small shoe-mender, with banks
H07  92 specially sited on corners or in separate courts to avoid breaking
H07  93 into the shopping frontage.
H07  94    |^As in the case of factories and industrial sites, the
H07  95 corporations' policy has been to charge full commercial rents for
H07  96 their shops and shopping sites. ^The cost of town centre development
H07  97 has been very high in some cases with large paved areas and pleasant
H07  98 amenities and decorative features. ^The gross return on capital
H07  99 expenditure on town and neighbourhood shopping centres ranges from 6
H07 100 to 13 per cent. ^It is to their successful industrial and commercial
H07 101 development that the corporations must look to recoup the high costs
H07 102 of main sewerage and drainage, main roads and other special
H07 103 development expenditure.
H07 104 *<*1Service industry*>
H07 105    |^*0In the early stages of a new town most of the working
H07 106 population are employed in manufacturing or basic industry. ^In the
H07 107 London new towns it is estimated that between 60 per cent and 70 per
H07 108 cent are so employed; in the provincial new towns the figure is
H07 109 somewhat higher. ^Employment in services of one kind or another may be
H07 110 expected to increase as the towns approach maturity: indeed, in the
H07 111 country generally the proportion of people so employed is growing
H07 112 steadily. ^These services develop at their own pace in response to
H07 113 local demand, however, and little can be done to stimulate them.
H07 114 *<*1Office employment*>
H07 115    |^*0In practice it has not proved possible as yet to attract *"head
H07 116 offices and administrative and research establishments including
H07 117 sections of government departments and other public offices**" on the
H07 118 scale needed *"to establish the character of the town from the outset
H07 119 as one of diverse and balanced social composition**" as recommended by
H07 120 the Reith Committee. ^Except at Hemel Hempstead, large office
H07 121 organisations have until quite recently shown little interest in the
H07 122 new towns, probably because of the difficulty in the early years in
H07 123 recruiting suitable staff, especially junior staff, locally. ^There is
H07 124 evidence of greater interest today, with nearly half a million square
H07 125 feet of office space under construction*- almost as much as the total
H07 126 area so far completed. ^This interest is likely to grow as employers
H07 127 become aware of the advantages of setting up offices in towns with a
H07 128 young and growing population and excellent schools and technical
H07 129 colleges. ^Towards the end of the year the Minister wrote personally
H07 130 to some two hundred chairmen of companies with large offices in
H07 131 central London, drawing their attention to the opportunities offered
H07 132 by the new towns.
H07 133    |^The development corporations have provided office accommodation
H07 134 (in addition to that included in factory premises) in the form of
H07 135 buildings specially designed to meet the needs of particular
H07 136 organisations, and have also erected some buildings as a speculative
H07 137 venture. ^Despite some misgivings, these have readily let on
H07 138 satisfactory terms, including in many cases a break clause in the
H07 139 lease allowing for a future increase in rent to reflect rising values
H07 140 in the town. ^More modest premises are provided on the upper floors
H07 141 over shops in some of the town centres for the small type of office
H07 142 organisation.
H07 143 *<*1Government departments*>
H07 144    |^*0Government departments with branches established or about to be
H07 145 established in the new towns include Her Majesty's Stationery Office
H07 146 at Basildon, the Meteorological Office at Bracknell, the Admiralty
H07 147 (who have a research laboratory at Harlow), the General Post Office
H07 148 and the Ministry of Transport at Hemel Hempstead and the Department of
H07 149 Scientific and Industrial Research at Stevenage. ^Local offices of the
H07 150 Ministry of Labour, Ministry of National Insurance and Inland Revenue
H07 151 are of course established or proposed in all the towns.
H07 152 *<*1Youth employment*>
H07 153    |^*0Because of the abnormal age structure of the new town
H07 154 populations the number of children reaching school-leaving age,
H07 155 expressed as a percentage of the total population, has been and still
H07 156 is below the national average. ^But whereas the national annual
H07 157 average will settle down at something like 1.4 per cent after the
H07 158 *"bulge**" has passed, in the new towns the percentage will generally
H07 159 go on rising (in some towns into the middle seventies) reaching levels
H07 160 of perhaps 2.3 per cent in some towns before it begins to decline.
H07 161 ^During this period, when large numbers of school-leavers will be
H07 162 looking for jobs, there will be relatively few retirements. ^For the
H07 163 most part therefore local employment can be provided only by the
H07 164 expansion of existing industry and the introduction of new factories,
H07 165 laboratories and offices, and the expected but not easily stimulated
H07 166 development of the service industries. ^Schemes for training young
H07 167 people in industry and commerce will be particularly important in the
H07 168 new towns.
H07 169 *<*1Housing requirements of industry*>
H07 170    |^*0As the Reith Committee foresaw, *"perfect synchronisation of
H07 171 the movement of employing firms with the movement of employed people
H07 172 is not practicable**". ^For short periods over the years some of the
H07 173 London new town corporations have been able to offer a house or a flat
H07 174 at once to anyone eligible for one, but in the main house building has
H07 175 lagged behind the demand. ^At the present time in most of the towns
H07 176 the waiting period has tended to grow, partly because the buoyancy of
H07 177 industry generates increasing demands, partly because in recent years
H07 178 the pressure on the building industry, the shortage of bricks and
H07 179 other materials, and the shortage of skilled labour, especially in the
H07 180 finishing trades, has made it difficult for corporations to achieve
H07 181 their full programme.
H07 182    |^It is believed that about 60 per cent of the employees of London
H07 183 firms transferring their business to the new towns moved with them and
H07 184 were thus eligible to rent a corporation house. ^Additional workers
H07 185 are recruited through the industrial selection scheme by arrangement
H07 186 with the Ministry of Labour. ^This scheme is designed to ensure that
H07 187 vacancies in the London new towns which cannot be filled locally are
H07 188 filled as far as possible from people on London housing lists, who
H07 189 thus become entitled to rent a house in the new town. ^Londoners not
H07 190 in housing need, but whose departure from London may be assumed to
H07 191 release accommodation there, are recruited for jobs which cannot be
H07 192 filled through the industrial selection scheme, and only as a last
H07 193 resort are people from outside London allotted new town houses. ^As a
H07 194 result, almost 80 per cent of the houses let by the development
H07 195 corporations in the London new towns have gone to Londoners, about
H07 196 half of whom are known to have been on local authority housing lists.
H07 197    |^Tables C, D and E of Appendix *=16 give details of factories,
H07 198 shops and offices completed and under construction at the end of the
H07 199 year.

H08   2    |^*0Apart from those in (e) above, acceptance of post-release
H08   3 assistance by a prisoner in these groups is entirely voluntary; he may
H08   4 not be recalled to prison or have any other sanction applied to him
H08   5 for subsequent refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Council,
H08   6 and no period of supervision can be laid down. ^We understand that the
H08   7 addition of detention centre inmates to the above list is being
H08   8 considered.
H08   9 *<*1From the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Societies*>
H08  10    |^*019. Any discharged prisoner may apply (without being required
H08  11 to observe any statutory or other conditions) for post-release
H08  12 assistance from the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Societies. ^In practice
H08  13 most of those they help are persons who are not under the care of the
H08  14 After Care Council. ^These are societies approved by the Secretary of
H08  15 State under section 18(4) of the Prisons (Scotland) Act, 1952, and
H08  16 formed, in the words of the Act, *"for the purpose of finding
H08  17 employment for discharged prisoners and enabling them by loans and
H08  18 grants of money to live by honest labour**". ^There are eight such
H08  19 societies in Scotland, all but one of which carry out their after-care
H08  20 functions through part-time agents. ^They receive from the state
H08  21 grants equal to half their approved expenditure; for the rest of their
H08  22 income they depend on voluntary contributions and interest from
H08  23 investments. ^The societies have formed a national organisation, the
H08  24 Scottish Association of Discharged Prisoners' Aid Societies, which
H08  25 acts as a co-ordinating body concerned primarily with policy and
H08  26 national appeals. ^We shall discuss the place of these societies in a
H08  27 modern scheme of after-care in our second report.
H08  28 *<*2EXISTING PATTERN OF SELECTION FOR AFTER-CARE*>
H08  29    |^*020. The aim of after-care is no doubt to protect society by
H08  30 helping the offender to re-establish himself so that he does not fall
H08  31 into crime again. ^It is, however, difficult to trace any guiding
H08  32 principle in the existing pattern of selection as described in
H08  33 paragraphs 17-18 above by which after-care is applied compulsorily, or
H08  34 made available on a voluntary basis to certain categories of prisoner.
H08  35 ^The arrangements would rather appear to have grown up piecemeal. ^The
H08  36 periods for which prisoners receive after-care also do not appear to
H08  37 be very effectively related to its objects. ^In general, the view
H08  38 appears to have been taken that a person released on licence before
H08  39 the end of his sentence should not be subject to supervision beyond
H08  40 the date on which the sentence expires. ^This has the odd result that
H08  41 the more remission a prisoner loses by misconduct, the shorter his
H08  42 period on licence. ^That is to say, in cases where rehabilitation
H08  43 might be expected to be particularly difficult the time available for
H08  44 after-care is cut down. ^Apart from such special cases, it seems to us
H08  45 that if the period of after-care is based arithmetically on the period
H08  46 of sentence it is unlikely to bear much relation to the prisoner's
H08  47 individual needs, to the time required for after-care to be effective,
H08  48 or to the need of ensuring, in the public interest, that there may be
H08  49 adequate opportunity given to the welfare staff to do what they can to
H08  50 get the man to stand again on his own two feet. ^It will be very
H08  51 seldom that permanent good can be done in this field under six months,
H08  52 and for assistance to be withdrawn from a discharged person after,
H08  53 perhaps, a matter of weeks, must all too often mean a sorry waste of
H08  54 effort.
H08  55    |^21. We are therefore satisfied that a statutory period of
H08  56 after-care must normally be one entirely independent of the particular
H08  57 prisoner's period of remission as determined by his length of sentence
H08  58 and his conduct in prison*- good conduct while in custody does not
H08  59 necessarily remove the need for supervision after release. ^It must in
H08  60 our view be fixed solely with the effectiveness of after-care in view.
H08  61 *<*2COMPULSORY OR VOLUNTARY AFTER-CARE*>
H08  62    |^*022. There is, of course, an element of contradiction in the
H08  63 idea of *"compulsory after-care**". ^No man can really be helped
H08  64 against his will and a prisoner who resented the conditions attached
H08  65 to after-care could effectively enough go through the motions of
H08  66 co-operation without deriving any benefit. ^There is no doubt that
H08  67 where after-care is at least voluntarily accepted, the chances of
H08  68 success are significantly enhanced. ^We cannot be satisfied, however,
H08  69 that the type of prisoner most in need of after-care would always
H08  70 willingly ask for it. ^He might be motivated by misplaced pride, by
H08  71 reluctance to appear to be currying favour *"with the authorities**",
H08  72 or by a genuine inability to realise his own plight. ^Even of those
H08  73 who might while in prison opt for voluntary after-care, a considerable
H08  74 number, we have been assured, would on release find any kind of
H08  75 supervision conditions irksome and would cease to co-operate. ^This
H08  76 would involve great wastage of time and effort on the part of the
H08  77 already burdened after-care personnel. ^We therefore conclude that any
H08  78 effective system of after-care must depend on a statutory obligation
H08  79 on the prisoner or inmate to accept help, the value of which, we feel
H08  80 satisfied, will be fully explained to him by the staff of the prison
H08  81 or institution before his release.
H08  82    |^23. Nevertheless, we do not consider that the work of the After
H08  83 Care Council should be confined to assisting those who are statutorily
H08  84 placed under its supervision. ^Ideally, all discharged prisoners and
H08  85 inmates might be required to accept the Council's supervision and
H08  86 help. ^This is manifestly impossible at the present time, and
H08  87 compulsory after-care must therefore be put on some kind of selective
H08  88 basis. ^But we feel that, over and above the after-care of persons in
H08  89 the selected categories, there is scope for the Council to assist
H08  90 other discharged prisoners who are in special need of help and are
H08  91 willing to accept the discipline that any form of after-care must
H08  92 involve. ^We recognise that there is some danger of the resources of
H08  93 the after-care service being strained by an excessive volume of
H08  94 *"voluntary**" work, and that some method of selection to control it
H08  95 might become necessary. ^Nevertheless we recommend that the After Care
H08  96 Council should be given explicit power and accept supervision although
H08  97 they are not in the statutory categories which we propose later in
H08  98 this report.
H08  99 *<*2SELECTION FOR AFTER-CARE*>
H08 100    |^*024. Since compulsory after-care for every person released from
H08 101 custody is not feasible, or indeed necessary, some scheme of selection
H08 102 must operate. ^Some recommendations on this subject have already been
H08 103 made in the Advisory Council's reports on Custodial Sentences for
H08 104 Young Offenders (published in July, 1960) and on Short Sentences of
H08 105 Imprisonment (published in May, 1960). ^We refer to the effect of our
H08 106 own proposals on these recommendations in the summary of
H08 107 recommendations in paragraph 53 below.
H08 108 *<(a) *2METHOD OF SELECTION*>
H08 109    |^*025. We have considered a number of possible methods of
H08 110 selection, but in the end we have concluded that at present the one
H08 111 that is most satisfactory is the application of compulsory after-care
H08 112 to categories of inmates and prisoners clearly specified in statute.
H08 113 ^We refer below to the other possibilities we have discussed:
H08 114 *<(**=1) *1Selection by the Court*>
H08 115    |^*0It is arguable, on the view that compulsory after-care, where
H08 116 it is appropriate, is part of the sentence imposed, that the court
H08 117 should select the offenders who would be likely to benefit from
H08 118 after-care, and include an appropriate period in the sentence. ^But we
H08 119 doubt whether the court, except perhaps where the sentence was a very
H08 120 short one, could actually assess at the time of imposing it what would
H08 121 be the offender's needs when the time came for him to leave prison.
H08 122 ^The court might, possibly, impose after-care by categories, but this
H08 123 would only be doing what could more effectively be done by Act of
H08 124 Parliament. ^Selection by the courts of individual cases would, we
H08 125 fear, result in much resentment on the part of those chosen for it;
H08 126 few would appreciate the court's reason for choosing them rather than
H08 127 others, and some would regard the period of after-care as an addition
H08 128 to the sentence. ^They would thus be in a bad frame of mind to start
H08 129 the training which now begins on admission to prison. ^Successful
H08 130 prison training must be a favourable factor for resettlement after
H08 131 release, but if the prisoner started it with a feeling of resentment
H08 132 his co-operation would be more difficult to secure. ^It seems to us
H08 133 better that after-care should be attached by the law to certain
H08 134 custodial sentences rather than that it should have an appearance*- in
H08 135 the minds of some offenders*- of being an additional element that
H08 136 courts may add to the normal sentence at their discretion.
H08 137 *<(**=2) *1Selection by prison staff, or by a prison board, or by the
H08 138 Secretary of State*>
H08 139    |^*0The Governor of a prison and his senior staff, including the
H08 140 prison welfare officer, could theoretically choose deserving cases for
H08 141 after-care, or make recommendations to a board consisting of members
H08 142 of the visiting committee. ^As, however, the basis of selection would
H08 143 be in the main the prisoner's conduct and progress while in prison
H08 144 there might be a tendency to choose the man who simply avoided getting
H08 145 into trouble. ^It would, we think, be likely to create discontent
H08 146 among the body of prisoners to have the prison staff, or any board
H08 147 acting on their advice, choose certain men as apparently better, or
H08 148 worse, post-release risks than others. ^This would certainly be
H08 149 discouraging to the prisoner who might have welcomed after-care and
H08 150 who was not chosen, but conversely, would encourage the prisoner who
H08 151 did not want supervision to behave in such a way as not to be selected
H08 152 or recommended. ^In the end, the Governor and his staff would be
H08 153 inclined to avoid the invidiousness of selection by recommending
H08 154 almost every prisoner, or none.
H08 155    |^Placing the ultimate decision for selection on the Secretary of
H08 156 State might appear to remove the onus from the prison staff or prison
H08 157 board. ^The Secretary of State, however, would have to rely on reports
H08 158 from the prison and welfare staffs, and sooner or later this would be
H08 159 known to the prisoners. ^All the undesirable consequences of selection
H08 160 would still remain.
H08 161 *<(**=3) *1Opting by prisoners, with earlier release*>
H08 162    |^*0The suggestion that a prisoner who voluntarily accepted
H08 163 after-care might thereby qualify for earlier release, through,
H08 164 possibly, a higher rate of remission, is at first sight not
H08 165 unattractive. ^We have been assured, however, that every prisoner
H08 166 would be only too willing to make a show of accepting after-care if
H08 167 earlier release were the consequence. ^The proposal would inevitably
H08 168 involve some kind of selection, with the attendant evils, and we do
H08 169 not think the prison staff, or any other staff, should have in their
H08 170 hands what would amount to a wide power to confer earlier release.
H08 171 ^There would, moreover, be some risk that those who opted would be
H08 172 regarded by the others as seeking the favour of the prison staff, and
H08 173 some might opt in the expectation of more considerate treatment, for
H08 174 example, by getting the better kind of jobs in prison. ^Opting for
H08 175 after-care with any kind of reward attached must in our opinion be
H08 176 ruled out at the present time.
H08 177    |^26. Any of these methods of selection involves consequences which
H08 178 we think are unacceptable. ^Other strong objections to these methods
H08 179 are the prisoner's uncertainty whether he will be selected and the
H08 180 difficulty of deciding the best time for selection. ^It is clearly
H08 181 undesirable that the prisoner should have to serve perhaps the better
H08 182 part of his sentence not knowing whether he will get after-care help
H08 183 on release, or that the welfare staff should not know in good time the
H08 184 prisoners they will be required to help. ^If conduct in prison were a
H08 185 deciding consideration selection would tend to be left to a time near
H08 186 the date of release. ^If a prisoner is going to get after-care he
H08 187 should know it as soon as he starts his sentence.
H08 188    |^27. We therefore conclude that the only method of avoiding the
H08 189 difficulties of individual selection and of ensuring that a prisoner
H08 190 is at no time in any doubt where he stands in relation to after-care
H08 191 is to specify, in statute, the categories of prisoners to whom
H08 192 after-care is to be applied.
H08 193 *# 2018
H09   1 **[273 TEXT H09**]
H09   2 ^*0We have already been pleased to be able to place our records at the
H09   3 disposal of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology in a study of some
H09   4 aspects of preventive detention.
H09   5    |^38. On a more favourable note we quote the experience of one of
H09   6 the major combined area probation committees, whose annual report
H09   7 states that 83 per cent of its prison after-care cases completed their
H09   8 supervision satisfactorily compared with 72 per cent ex-borstal and 47
H09   9 per cent ex-approved school cases. ^The ex-prisoners were the largest
H09  10 group out of a total of 185 persons from all three sources.
H09  11    |^39. It is never easy to forecast how any man will respond to
H09  12 after-care so that we were dubious of the prospects for \0W..., a man
H09  13 of 39 with a criminal history stretching back 25 years. ^On his
H09  14 eleventh appearance before the court he had received a sentence of 8
H09  15 years' preventive detention. ^In prison he was described as an unhappy
H09  16 creature who had started life badly*- an unreliable and untrustworthy
H09  17 man who had steadily deteriorated over the years until he possessed
H09  18 neither the inclination nor determination to mend his ways. ^\0W...
H09  19 was placed in the care of one of our Associates whom he met regularly
H09  20 for the next eighteen months. ^During this time \0W... became aware of
H09  21 his own problems and limitations, but in the Associate's skilled care
H09  22 he was also made aware of his own potential. ^To his amazement he
H09  23 remained in the same job throughout his supervision and proved to
H09  24 himself that there was no need for him to return to crime. ^He has, in
H09  25 fact, retained a friendly contact with our Associate although his
H09  26 statutory period of supervision has long since ended.
H09  27    |^40. Our case histories are not all so successful. ^\0J... was
H09  28 also released from a sentence of eight years' preventive detention.
H09  29 ^In this instance business man **[SIC**] in the North of England
H09  30 offered to find work and lodgings for him. ^In addition to his fare
H09  31 and subsistence on leaving the prison he received immediate aid from
H09  32 the National Assistance Board until he received his first week's
H09  33 wages, and working clothes through our Associate. ^His new employer
H09  34 found him a furnished flat and being connected with a local football
H09  35 club provided him with a season ticket. ^Within a week \0J... was
H09  36 before a Court again, having stolen from the flat and pawned the
H09  37 articles following on a week-end drinking bout. ^He is now back in
H09  38 prison after which we shall try again.
H09  39    |^41. *1Life imprisonment.*- ^*0The Division is also responsible
H09  40 for the supervision of men sentenced to life imprisonment and
H09  41 subsequently released by the Secretary of State on conditional
H09  42 licence. ^The number under statutory supervision at the year end was
H09  43 20, with an additional two persons under voluntary supervision. ^While
H09  44 some of these men will always need the help of the Association's staff
H09  45 and Associates to order their lives, others have now reached a state
H09  46 of maturity which has enabled them to integrate themselves happily and
H09  47 successfully with the community.
H09  48    |^42. *1Home leave.*- ^*0In 1960 the number of prisoners granted
H09  49 home leave for employment and re-acclimatisation purposes and who
H09  50 would be the Division's responsibility on discharge, reached a record
H09  51 total of 579 against 489 the previous year. ^Home leave involves a
H09  52 preliminary enquiry being made at each home (often incurring more than
H09  53 one visit) and at least once **[SIC**] interview with each prisoner
H09  54 whilst on leave. ^The increasing {0N.A.D.P.A.S.} Prison Welfare
H09  55 Officer complement is providing an accumulating load of home enquiries
H09  56 of many kinds relating to health, marital and property problems.
H09  57    |^Unpredicted home enquiries bear particularly heavily on a small
H09  58 welfare staff covering the whole of the Metropolitan area since they
H09  59 cannot be planned beforehand yet must be carried out quickly if they
H09  60 are to be effective. ^Few of these homes are on the telephone, many of
H09  61 the wives or parents are working and a long journey by public
H09  62 transport is wasted if our caller can obtain no reply.
H09  63    |^43. *1Discharged under Section 29 of the Prison Act, 1952.*-
H09  64 ^*0The exercise of this police function, which we have regularly
H09  65 deplored in recent years, has continued throughout the year with the
H09  66 prospect that this will be the last occasion to report. ^3,497 men
H09  67 were discharged during 1960 with the obligation to report their
H09  68 addresses. ^Of the 3,387 discharged during 1959, the position at the
H09  69 end of 1960 was that 1,101 (32.5 per cent) had been reconvicted and
H09  70 526 (15.5 per cent) required to report directly to the police.
H09  71    |^44. *1Accommodation.*- ^*0Whilst the problem of finding work has
H09  72 only been serious in pockets of unemployment, that of finding suitable
H09  73 accommodation continues difficult. ^In fact, the more alternative
H09  74 occupations there are available, the fewer the women who take in
H09  75 lodgers. ^After-care is sometimes criticised for not having rooms
H09  76 ready for an ex-prisoner, but experience has shown that such a plan
H09  77 almost automatically publicises a client's previous occupation. ^The
H09  78 alternative of putting a man into hostel accommodation for one night
H09  79 while providing him with sufficient funds to find his own lodging is
H09  80 ultimately a more effective arrangement.
H09  81    |^45. In this connection we appreciate the work of such
H09  82 organisations as Norman House and Langley House, both now firmly
H09  83 established in their role of providing a special form of residential
H09  84 support and friendships for homeless ex-prisoners. ^The close and
H09  85 mutually advantageous relations which have been established between
H09  86 them and the official bodies augur well for the future development of
H09  87 such ventures which we understand are being planned in the Provinces.
H09  88    |^46. The year has been marked by increasing co-operation between
H09  89 the Division and the National Assistance Board and of more sympathetic
H09  90 understanding of the difficulties of the ex-prisoners at all levels.
H09  91 ^Groups of National Assistance Board Officers have been addressed on
H09  92 these problems and resulting from a mutual review of procedure,
H09  93 discharged prisoners have since 1st August, 1960, been accepted
H09  94 directly at the Board's office before registering for unemployment
H09  95 with the Ministry of Labour. ^This has proved particularly beneficial
H09  96 to the homeless man in immediate need of finding lodgings.
H09  97    |^47. Relationships with our colleagues in the Prison Service, the
H09  98 National Association of Discharged Prisoners' Aid Societies, the
H09  99 National Assistance Board and the Ministry of Labour continue close
H09 100 and productive. ^These bodies are selected for mention solely because
H09 101 their functions are so closely integrated with our own. ^The
H09 102 achievement of close personal contact with our Probation Service
H09 103 Associates was cemented by an invitation to the Director to address
H09 104 the Annual Conference of the National Association of Probation
H09 105 Officers. ^Particular effort has been made during the year to invite
H09 106 the co-operation of the National Council of Social Service, the
H09 107 National Citizens Advice Bureau and the Women's Voluntary Service in
H09 108 our work. ^To all who have shown their practical sympathy and
H09 109 understanding of our task, we offer our grateful thanks.
H09 110 *<*4Chapter Five*>
H09 111 *<*6TREATMENT OF BOYS*>
H09 112    |^*01. *1General.*- ^*0In order to implement the proposals in the
H09 113 Criminal Justice Bill, 1960, relating to the treatment of young
H09 114 offenders a considerable extension of the system of borstals and
H09 115 detention centres will be needed.
H09 116    |^2. Three secure borstals are to be provided at Swinfen,
H09 117 \0Staffs., Wellingborough, \0Northants., and additional open borstals
H09 118 at Finnamore Wood Camp, \0Bucks. (now partially occupied) and
H09 119 Shaftesbury, Dorset. ^The open borstal at Huntercombe is being adapted
H09 120 for use as a medium security borstal, and the adaption of Aylesbury
H09 121 prison as an establishment for young offenders has made further
H09 122 progress.
H09 123    |^3. Three senior detention centres were opened in the early months
H09 124 of 1961 at New Hall Camp, \0Yorks., Medomsley, County Durham and
H09 125 Aylesbury, \0Bucks. ^It is hoped to have four more centres ready by
H09 126 early 1962 at Erlestoke, \0Wilts., Aldington, Kent, East Clandon,
H09 127 Surrey and Haslar, \0Hants, and a further centre at Kirklevington,
H09 128 \0Yorks, during 1963. ^The semi-secure borstal at Buckley, \0Lancs.
H09 129 will become a detention centre in the autumn of 1961.
H09 130    |^4. *1Population.*- ^*0Committals to borstal increased from 3,062
H09 131 in 1959 to 3,476 in 1960, and the daily average population in borstals
H09 132 from 4,034 to 4,115.
H09 133    |^5. Reception centres were under constant pressure; one centre
H09 134 dealt with 2,028 cases, more than double the number handled three
H09 135 years ago. ^The modified form of allocation procedure reported last
H09 136 year and some staff additions enabled the centres to meet the demands
H09 137 of the training borstals, and for one of them to increase the
H09 138 psychological and psychiatric coverage.
H09 139    |^6. The quality of borstal receptions during the year has been
H09 140 assessed in three ways: (a) in terms of the nature of the offences
H09 141 leading to the borstal sentence; (b) in terms of educational and
H09 142 intellectual criteria; (c) in terms of Mannheim-Wilkins prediction
H09 143 groups. ^No new trend was observed in the type of offence, the great
H09 144 majority of which continued to be those of breaking and entering and
H09 145 stealing. ^Offences against the person, including sexual offences,
H09 146 remained at about 12 1/2 per cent of the total offences. ^The
H09 147 distribution of intelligence and educational attainment also remained
H09 148 virtually unchanged, but there was a further deterioration in terms of
H09 149 the Mannheim-Wilkins prediction ratings which seems likely to have an
H09 150 adverse effect on training results. ^No less than 66.4 per cent of
H09 151 last year's receptions fell into the C and D categories, those with
H09 152 the poorest prospects of success. ^This compares with 56.5 per cent in
H09 153 1957 and 25.5 per cent in 1946 (when the original research was
H09 154 undertaken) whilst the present proportion of 9.9 per cent in the A and
H09 155 B categories (with the best proportion of success) compares with 10.2
H09 156 per cent in 1957 and 32.7 per cent in 1946. ^This deterioration in the
H09 157 quality of the training material suggests that the success rate is
H09 158 likely to be under 40 per cent.
H09 159    |^7. The number of young offenders sentenced to imprisonment
H09 160 increased from 2,498 in 1959 to 3,099 in 1960, and the number of
H09 161 committals to detention centres (which was limited by the capacity of
H09 162 the centres) showed a slight drop from 1,356 to 1,295.
H09 163 *<*4Borstal Training*>
H09 164    |^*08. *1General.*- ^*0This was the last full year in which
H09 165 Northallerton functioned as a preliminary training borstal. ^At the
H09 166 beginning of 1961 it became a full training borstal, when it was
H09 167 decided to discontinue the policy of sending boys, who might later be
H09 168 suitable for *"open**" training, to Northallerton for some months
H09 169 before making a decision as to their final training borstal. ^Some
H09 170 borstals felt that they were getting boys from Northallerton too late
H09 171 in their training, and that the period in which a lad settled in and
H09 172 became known by the new staff, tended to extend his training beyond
H09 173 the time he would have spent had he been originally allocated to his
H09 174 final borstal. ^This appeared unfair to the boy and sometimes affected
H09 175 his whole outlook. ^When the Northallerton staff were asked to
H09 176 concentrate their preliminary training into a shorter period so that
H09 177 it was not necessary to wait until a lad had attained senior training
H09 178 grade before sending him away, they were not so certain of their
H09 179 findings and tended to send more boys to closed conditions as a safety
H09 180 precaution. ^However, this difficulty might have been overcome had it
H09 181 not been necessary to use the training places at Northallerton for
H09 182 boys who needed the restriction imposed by this kind of borstal. ^The
H09 183 experiment has been one of great interest and may be repeated when
H09 184 conditions are more favourable; Northallerton has done valuable and
H09 185 effective work, transferring some 340 lads to open conditions after
H09 186 having settled them down to borstal and dissipated the urge to run
H09 187 away that causes an upset in the training of so many in the first
H09 188 months.
H09 189    |^9. *1Training.*- ^*0The average length of training was 16.1
H09 190 months. ^This ranged from 9.2 to 36 months. ^The average time at
H09 191 Reading was 27.7 months for those boys ultimately released from there.
H09 192 ^The full picture of the training programme given in previous reports
H09 193 has not greatly altered, but the concentrated effort required to
H09 194 prepare a lad for release in the shorter training period introduced
H09 195 during the past two years has increased the intensity of the work.

H10   2 ^*0The directors of the research associations have their own personal
H10   3 contacts with the appropriate laboratories in the Commonwealth
H10   4 countries.
H10   5    |^Apart from defence considerations, it is in the interest of our
H10   6 national economy that we should strive to increase our home production
H10   7 of food in terms of our livestock population and yield of crops per
H10   8 acre.
H10   9    |^Superimposed on all these considerations is the fact that with
H10  10 the improving economic status of the population there is an increasing
H10  11 emphasis on the intrinsic acceptability of food and particularly on
H10  12 its presentation in the retail shops.
H10  13    |^From the above brief introduction it follows that the pattern of
H10  14 food research should embrace the following broad fields:
H10  15 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H10  16    |^(1) Methods of increasing production.
H10  17    |^(2) Preservation (transport, storage and distribution).
H10  18    |^(3) Processing.
H10  19    |^(4) Acceptability or intrinsic quality, including freedom from
H10  20 abnormal flavour or taint.
H10  21    |^(5) Nutrition and hygiene.
H10  22    |^(6) The possible toxicological effects of substances added to
H10  23 food during growth, transport and processing.
H10  24    |^(7) Presentation.
H10  25 **[END INDENTATION**]
H10  26    |^Each of these is a vast field of research and investigation.
H10  27 *<*6THE OVERALL PATTERN*>
H10  28    |^*0It is difficult to say where food research begins; it involves
H10  29 all the scientific disciplines*- physics, chemistry, mathematics,
H10  30 engineering, each ultimately wedded to one or more of the different
H10  31 divisions of biology. ^Apart from supplying graduate staff, therefore,
H10  32 the universities must in the long run set the level of food research;
H10  33 they must also supply much of the fundamental knowledge required for
H10  34 advances in the science and technology of food. ^Certain of the
H10  35 universities with departments of agriculture and horticulture are of
H10  36 course carrying out continuous research directly on food, and this
H10  37 applies also to many biochemical departments.
H10  38    |^The concern of the Government is clear enough since an adequate
H10  39 supply of inexpensive food of satisfactory nutritional quality is
H10  40 essential for our survival and for our national prosperity. ^Thus
H10  41 there are some 23 research institutes or units wholly financed by the
H10  42 Agricultural Research Council, and the Ministry of Agriculture,
H10  43 Fisheries and Food has its own Food Science and Atomic Energy
H10  44 Division.
H10  45    |^The Agricultural Research Council is also concerned with the
H10  46 research programmes of 22 other institutes which are financed wholly
H10  47 or in part by the Council or, in the case of eight institutes in
H10  48 Scotland, by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland. ^Special
H10  49 grants are also made to universities and other organisations for
H10  50 research on subjects of interest to the Council. ^The total annual
H10  51 cost of all this research by the Council now exceeds *+5 million.
H10  52    |^In the past the interest of the {0A.R.C.} has been in animals
H10  53 and crops*- their production and nutrition and the reduction of
H10  54 disease; one exception is the work of the Hannah Dairy Research
H10  55 Institute over the past 25 years on the keeping quality of dried milk.
H10  56 ^More recently, however, the Council, in accepting responsibility for
H10  57 the Low Temperature Research Station, Cambridge, the Ditton
H10  58 Laboratory, and the Pest Infestation Laboratory, Slough, has moved
H10  59 outside the *"farm gate**" and has thus extended its interest in food
H10  60 to include storage and preservation. ^To quote from its last Annual
H10  61 Report: ^*"The importance has been previously stressed of considering
H10  62 the production, handling, storage, packaging and processing of food as
H10  63 links in one continuous chain of operations, the final objective of
H10  64 which is to provide the nation with food of the highest quality at the
H10  65 lowest economic price. ^The Council has therefore always in mind the
H10  66 need to integrate research on production with that on the intermediate
H10  67 steps involved in the passage of food from the farm to the dinner
H10  68 table. ^This is equally true whether the production is on our own
H10  69 farms or those overseas. ^To this end the Council is keeping in touch
H10  70 with research on production throughout the Commonwealth and, where
H10  71 possible, in other countries from which our food comes. ^The
H10  72 establishment of the Overseas Research Council, of which the Council's
H10  73 Secretary is an *1{6ex officio} *0member, will, it is hoped, help to
H10  74 strengthen the links already existing between the overseas producer
H10  75 and those responsible for handling and processing imported foodstuffs
H10  76 in this country.**"
H10  77    |^To help the Council in its wider responsibility the Ministry of
H10  78 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
H10  79 Scotland have recently set up a Food Research Advisory Committee to
H10  80 advise on those food problems requiring investigation or research and
H10  81 on their order of priority.
H10  82    |^Finally, to complete the picture of food research institutes,
H10  83 mention must be made of the Torry Research Station of {0D.S.I.R.}
H10  84 and its associated Humber Laboratory in Hull. ^Whereas these two
H10  85 laboratories are concerned with the very practical problems of
H10  86 handling, storage and distribution of fish, their fundamental
H10  87 research*- for example in bacteriology and that on fish oils and
H10  88 antioxidants*- is of great interest and value to all food research
H10  89 laboratories.
H10  90    |^On the nutritional side the Medical Research Council, with its
H10  91 many research units working directly on nutrition or in related
H10  92 fields, advises the Government through the Ministry of Health, and the
H10  93 Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry has his own Standing Committee
H10  94 to discuss problems of food and health.
H10  95    |^Among more than 50 industrial associations sponsored by the
H10  96 Department of Scientific and Industrial Research are four working
H10  97 wholly on food problems. ^Research carried out by these four bodies,
H10  98 whose work will be mentioned later, naturally has a strong bias
H10  99 generally, but not completely, towards the problems involved in the
H10 100 processing of food and its acceptability by the consumer.
H10 101    |^There is in addition the research and, particularly, development
H10 102 carried out wholly by industry. ^The results of this are to be seen,
H10 103 for example, in the margarine and soft drinks industries, in the
H10 104 development of containers for canned foods, in the relatively new
H10 105 development of packaged frozen foods, and in the sizeable export trade
H10 106 mainly in processed foods (more than *+160 million annually) from a
H10 107 country so largely dependent on imported basal foods. ^Another notable
H10 108 example of research financed wholly by industry is that of the Brewing
H10 109 Industry Research Foundation at Nutfield, Surrey, now an established
H10 110 national institute. ^The pharmaceutical and chemical industries should
H10 111 also be mentioned in connection with the large-scale production of
H10 112 vitamins, the production of pure substances to counter the various
H10 113 forms of deterioration, and the introduction of many substances which
H10 114 act as aids to processing.
H10 115    |^The foregoing is an over-simplification of the pattern of
H10 116 Government, Government-aided and industrial food research in this
H10 117 country; it is uneven and thin in places, but evidently it does deal
H10 118 with food from the farm or field to the table as well as nutritional
H10 119 quality. ^The research structure has of course developed piecemeal and
H10 120 the type and scope of the work of any individual institute is rarely
H10 121 exclusive. ^On the whole, judging by the amount of money spent on
H10 122 research, it would appear that the emphasis is on production*- perhaps
H10 123 understandable in a country that has to import so much of its food.
H10 124    |^Nevertheless some might argue that since the purpose of food is
H10 125 to keep man fit and healthy the greatest emphasis should be on its
H10 126 nutritional quality. ^Furthermore nutritional research has hitherto
H10 127 been confined almost exclusively to the food requirements of children
H10 128 and adolescents. ^But we have now moved into a phase when the
H10 129 nutrition of the adult calls for more research, particularly in view
H10 130 of the growing belief that the type of food man eats may be a factor
H10 131 in his susceptibility to certain diseases. ^Except in a state of
H10 132 emergency, however, people will continue to eat what they like and not
H10 133 what is necessarily best for them. ^It might also be claimed that as a
H10 134 complement to research on production there should be sustained
H10 135 research on the synthesis of protein, fat and carbohydrate to insure
H10 136 against a food shortage from any cause; by its nature this research is
H10 137 more a challenge to the scientific workers in the universities.
H10 138 *<*6THE FOOD RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS*>
H10 139    |^*0There are four research associations concerned wholly with
H10 140 food:
H10 141 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H10 142    |^The British Baking Industries Research Association.
H10 143    |^The Research Association of British Flour-Millers.
H10 144    |^The British Food Manufacturing Industries Research Association.
H10 145    |^The Fruit and Vegetable Canning and Quick Freezing Research
H10 146 Association, often referred to as the Campden Research Station.
H10 147 **[END INDENTATION**]
H10 148    |^The primary interest of each of these associations is to improve
H10 149 and standardize the manufacturing or processing methods and the
H10 150 quality of the final products of the particular industry it serves.
H10 151 ^In contrast with most of the research units associated with the
H10 152 Agricultural Research Council, the emphasis is on the factors
H10 153 *1outside *0the farm gate. ^At the same time the quality of the final
H10 154 product must be influenced by the quality of the raw material of the
H10 155 industry, and the methods of processing may influence its nutritional
H10 156 quality. ^In the overall food research pattern, therefore, the work of
H10 157 the research associations (coupled with that of the food industries)
H10 158 is complementary to that of the Agricultural and Medical Research
H10 159 Councils and the universities. ^This seems logical but when one looks
H10 160 at the relatively small expenditure of the food research associations,
H10 161 compared for example with the *+5 million vote of the Agricultural
H10 162 Research Council, it is paradoxical. ^For 1960 the incomes were:
H10 163 **[LIST**]
H10 164 ^Of this total *+207 840 was provided by industry and the remainder by
H10 165 {0D.S.I.R.}
H10 166    |^It must be remembered, however, that a research association, by
H10 167 its nature and organisation, should be an extremely objective,
H10 168 efficient and economic research unit. ^For the most part it has no
H10 169 need to search for its problems, and the solution to a particular
H10 170 problem can usually be tested out at once in a member's plant without
H10 171 the expense of a pilot plant, \0etc. ^Furthermore it has behind it the
H10 172 stimulating urge and interest of its members, just as it can call on
H10 173 their experience and judgment to help it decide how far it is
H10 174 profitable to pursue a particular line of enquiry.
H10 175    |^It might be said that these conditions are similar to those of
H10 176 the private laboratory of an individual food manufacturer. ^They are,
H10 177 but the important difference is that the research association serves a
H10 178 whole industry and this, coupled with the fact that it has close links
H10 179 with {0D.S.I.R.} and other Government departments, encourages it to
H10 180 work along independent and pioneer lines in both its research and
H10 181 applied work. ^Its members realize that this must be so if the
H10 182 association is to be their scientific liaison with the Government
H10 183 departments concerned with their particular industry. ^The work of the
H10 184 Food Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
H10 185 Food affords a notable example: this Committee when considering a
H10 186 particular foodstuff usually invites the director of the appropriate
H10 187 research association to attend its meetings and, in some cases, to act
H10 188 as assessor to the Committee.
H10 189    |^Although a research association serves a whole industry it is
H10 190 significant that often the work of the association has encouraged
H10 191 individual firms to start up or extend their own laboratories. ^In
H10 192 this way the research associations have brought a much greater
H10 193 scientific outlook and interest into the industry as a whole than
H10 194 their budgets and work would indicate.
H10 195    |^*1Co-operative Research. ^*0Apart from collaboration between
H10 196 themselves it is traditional and in fact essential for the food
H10 197 research associations to collaborate whenever possible with other
H10 198 laboratories that specialize in some particular aspect of food science
H10 199 and technology. ^This is usually of mutual advantage since the
H10 200 research association has its own specialized knowledge and equipment
H10 201 to offer. ^Thus a notable example is the joint work with the
H10 202 {0M.A.F.F.} in connection with food defence plans.
H10 203    |^Similarly there is continuous contact and collaboration with the
H10 204 Low Temperature Research Station, Cambridge, and the Pest Infestation
H10 205 Laboratory, Slough (both {0A.R.C.}), the Ministry's Food Science and
H10 206 Atomic Energy and Infestation Control Divisions, and the Laboratory of
H10 207 the Government Chemist. ^A particularly intimate case is that of the
H10 208 British Food Manufacturing Industries Research Association, which has
H10 209 seconded staff to the Low Temperature Research Station to work on the
H10 210 irradiation of foods as a possible method of preservation. ^Again, the
H10 211 associations can call on the resources of the Commonwealth Mycological
H10 212 Institute, which maintains a collection of fungi many of which are of
H10 213 interest in research into certain food problems.
H10 214 *# 2002
H11   1 **[275 TEXT H11**]
H11   2    |^*010. Coming back to the broad design, the Government entirely
H11   3 agree with the Commission that Greater London has a recognisable civic
H11   4 unity and shape, largely because it has grown outwards from a single
H11   5 centre. ^But its local government structure, inherited from the days
H11   6 when London was much smaller, in no way reflects that unity. ^The
H11   7 major services are administered by six county councils and three
H11   8 county borough councils, and three systems of local government exist
H11   9 side by side. ^They are: single-tier government in the county
H11  10 boroughs, two-tier government of the normal pattern outside the
H11  11 present administrative county of London, and a unique two-tier system
H11  12 within the administrative county, in which most of the important local
H11  13 government functions vest in the county council.
H11  14    |^11. London has clearly outgrown the system of local government
H11  15 devised to meet the vastly different physical and social conditions of
H11  16 the last century. ^This great town now faces immense problems of
H11  17 congestion, of traffic, of land shortages, and of major redevelopment.
H11  18 ^All of its citizens are *"Londoners**", not only those who live
H11  19 within the City and the 28 metropolitan boroughs. ^Greater London is
H11  20 their city and all are involved in what happens to it.
H11  21    |^12. The Royal Commission were convinced that, unless some method
H11  22 could be found within the framework of local government to tackle the
H11  23 pressing problems of Greater London, the central Government would
H11  24 increasingly supersede the local authorities. ^They thought that that
H11  25 would be disastrous for local government, and they were right. ^That
H11  26 is the answer to those who say that a system of local government which
H11  27 recognises Greater London as a unit for some purposes is not local
H11  28 government at all. ^In the Government's opinion it is the only way to
H11  29 enable Greater London to enjoy an adequate measure of responsible
H11  30 self-government.
H11  31    |^13. There is now an opportunity to carry out effective
H11  32 reorganisation which will bring London government into harmony with
H11  33 the physical features of the metropolis, and will fit it to face the
H11  34 new problems presented by changing social conditions and the
H11  35 ubiquitous motor vehicle. ^The Government are convinced that if this
H11  36 opportunity is not now grasped, local government will wither in the
H11  37 capital city where, in the past, it has been strongest.
H11  38    |^14. The Government have been impressed by the wide recognition
H11  39 among the local authorities concerned of the need for some change.
H11  40 ^True, many would adopt a different and less radical solution than
H11  41 that proposed by the Commission. ^But about the same number, while
H11  42 having reservation on some points of detail, accept the Commission's
H11  43 broad plan.
H11  44    |^15. The feature which attracted the greatest support was the
H11  45 conception of the borough as the primary unit of local government.
H11  46 ^The Government are sure that this is the right principle. ^It is a
H11  47 serious defect in the present organisation that many of the boroughs,
H11  48 and especially the metropolitan boroughs, have no real responsibility
H11  49 for the running of the local and personal services. ^The system
H11  50 proposed by the Commission would place personal, preventive and
H11  51 environmental health services, welfare and children's services, and
H11  52 housing, in the hands of one authority, local enough in character to
H11  53 enable local knowledge of the area and of its living and working
H11  54 conditions to be brought to bear. ^This would not only greatly enlarge
H11  55 the scope of the borough councillor, but would also make for more
H11  56 effective administration of these closely linked social services. ^The
H11  57 Government regard this as a key feature of the Commission's plan, and
H11  58 one well designed to attract into local government more men and women
H11  59 of real ability, by making sure that there are worthwhile jobs for
H11  60 them to do. ^If any re-organisation of local government does not
H11  61 secure this it will fail of its purpose.
H11  62    |^16. The principal alternative plan is one, sponsored chiefly by
H11  63 the county councils of Essex, Kent, London, Middlesex and Surrey, for
H11  64 an indirectly elected joint board for an area a good deal wider than
H11  65 that reviewed by the Commission, and the retention of the existing
H11  66 county and county borough councils. ^The board would have
H11  67 responsibilities in town planning for drawing up a master plan to
H11  68 which the local planning authorities would be required to conform,
H11  69 covering such regional questions as the main road framework, target
H11  70 populations, the level and main disposition of employment: for laying
H11  71 down the main considerations for dealing with traffic: for planning
H11  72 and co-ordinating refuse disposal: and for planning and co-ordinating
H11  73 programmes for over-spill. ^The powers of this joint board would be
H11  74 mainly advisory in character, and meanwhile somewhat greater powers
H11  75 would be conferred on or delegated to the boroughs.
H11  76    |^17. The Government believe that a plan on these lines would not
H11  77 begin to meet the needs of the situation. ^For a start it ignores*- or
H11  78 denies*- one of the fundamental assumptions on which the Royal
H11  79 Commission's Report was based. ^This is that the built-up areas
H11  80 outside the County of London are, now, more properly a part of Greater
H11  81 London than of the Home Counties to which historically they belong.
H11  82 ^But that apart, this plan would surely confuse responsibilities. ^The
H11  83 authority which has to deal with the planning, traffic and road
H11  84 problems of Greater London must exercise a real responsibility, and
H11  85 must be able to secure that its plans are effectively carried out. ^A
H11  86 largely advisory body, with powers mainly of co-ordination and
H11  87 supervision, would be likely to achieve very little. ^The overall
H11  88 authority must be an executive body if it is to be effective, although
H11  89 no doubt it would be right that it should in some matters act through
H11  90 the agency of the borough councils. ^The Government also believe that
H11  91 this authority, for full effectiveness and bearing in mind the powers
H11  92 and responsibilities which it will carry, ought to be directly
H11  93 elected. ^A joint board as envisaged would entail a third tier of
H11  94 responsibility, and this would only further confuse the already
H11  95 confused local government pattern in the area. ^County councils would
H11  96 be sandwiched between the joint board and their boroughs and
H11  97 districts, while the latter could not be given the responsibilities
H11  98 which, in the Government's view, they ought to have.
H11  99    |^18. The Government recognise that the abolition of the present
H11 100 county pattern in the London area will present formidable problems of
H11 101 organisation. ^Their concern is to get the best administrative
H11 102 structure for local government. ^When that is settled they will give
H11 103 consideration to such related matters as the arrangements for the
H11 104 administration of justice, for the lieutenancies and for sheriffs. ^In
H11 105 general they wish to emphasise that they propose to make only changes
H11 106 which are needed to achieve their main purpose and matters
H11 107 consequential to it. ^These proposals should not affect any existing
H11 108 cultural, social, sporting or other associations or loyalties which
H11 109 may be based on the traditional counties. ^They are, however,
H11 110 convinced that London needs a form of local government organisation to
H11 111 match its present physical shape and state. ^They are convinced, too,
H11 112 that this organisation must be one which recognises the unity and
H11 113 cohesion of the area, and which would combine ability to handle those
H11 114 issues that demand a comprehensive view of the whole area with the
H11 115 capacity to grapple effectively with the many and complex local
H11 116 problems. ^The Government believe that, provided these conditions are
H11 117 met, the new structure will provide fuller opportunities for really
H11 118 worthwhile local government service.
H11 119 *<*4The Boroughs*>
H11 120    |^*019. The Royal Commission suggested that the boroughs should
H11 121 fall within the population range 100,000 to 250,000, and provisionally
H11 122 proposed a pattern comprising 52 new boroughs (including the City).
H11 123 ^The Local Government Act, 1958, provides that, in so far as the
H11 124 constitution of a new county borough outside the metropolitan area is
H11 125 affected by considerations of population, the Minister should presume
H11 126 that a population of 100,000 is sufficient to support the discharge of
H11 127 the function of a county borough council. ^This does not mean,
H11 128 however, that larger units would not be better if they could be set up
H11 129 without loss of convenience. ^Larger units would mean more work for
H11 130 each authority in all the personal services, and so make
H11 131 specialisation in staff and institutions more efficient and
H11 132 economical. ^In addition, larger units would be stronger in resources
H11 133 and so better able to secure the major redevelopments which many
H11 134 boroughs now need. ^They would be better able to maintain and improve
H11 135 the standard of their services and to undertake their development as
H11 136 circumstances may require. ^Moreover the very nature of London*-
H11 137 continuously built-up at high densities, with a comprehensive system
H11 138 of transport and a population which in many of its daily activities
H11 139 pays little regard to local boundaries*- distinguishes it from the
H11 140 typical county borough. ^Hitherto, London has suffered in its local
H11 141 administration from too great a proliferation of not very strong
H11 142 authorities. ^The aim now should be to create units which, while
H11 143 retaining their local character, are well equipped to provide a fully
H11 144 adequate standard of local services. ^In a closely-knit area such as
H11 145 London, the Government believe that this object can best be assured by
H11 146 aiming at a larger minimum population and rather fewer boroughs than
H11 147 suggested by the Commission. ^They consider that this will make not
H11 148 only for higher standards, but also for greater economy in
H11 149 administration.
H11 150    |^20. The Government's general conclusion about the size of the
H11 151 boroughs is that it would be desirable to aim at a minimum population
H11 152 of around 200,000 wherever possible. ^Some boroughs might be
H11 153 substantially larger than this. ^They propose shortly to circulate, as
H11 154 a basis for consultation with the local authorities, an illustration
H11 155 of how larger boroughs might work out.
H11 156    |^21. The Government agree that the term *"metropolitan borough**"
H11 157 should now be abandoned; they propose the title of *"London
H11 158 Borough**". ^The Commission suggested that the constitution of the
H11 159 borough councils should follow that of municipal boroughs outside
H11 160 London, and the Government agree with this view.
H11 161    |^22. The Government agree with the Royal Commission in thinking
H11 162 that the boundaries and status of the City of London should remain
H11 163 unchanged, and that it should receive the additional powers given to
H11 164 boroughs in the London area.
H11 165 *<*4The Greater London Council*>
H11 166    |^*023. The Government agree that the Greater London Council should
H11 167 be directly elected. ^They propose to adopt the Commission's plan that
H11 168 its members should serve for three years and retire together.
H11 169    |^24. The Commission proposed that election should be based on
H11 170 Parliamentary constituencies. ^On the present structure this would
H11 171 give a membership of about 110. ^Many authorities have criticised this
H11 172 proposal, and argue that representation would better be based more
H11 173 directly on the boroughs. ^This is a matter which will require further
H11 174 examination in the light of the pattern of boroughs which emerges, and
H11 175 the Government reserve their decision on it.
H11 176    |^25. The Government agree generally with the principles applied by
H11 177 the Commission in deciding which areas they should recommend for
H11 178 inclusion in the Greater London administrative area. ^When
H11 179 consultation takes place with the local authorities about the borough
H11 180 pattern, there will be opportunity for any peripheral authority to
H11 181 make known its views about its inclusion in or exclusion from the
H11 182 London area. ^The districts left out of the London area will be
H11 183 brought within the ambit of the Local Government Commission, who will
H11 184 then of course be able to consider, among other things, Watford's
H11 185 claims for county borough status.
H11 186 *<*4Functions*>
H11 187    |^*026. The following paragraphs set out the Government's broad
H11 188 proposals with regard to the administration of particular functions;
H11 189 many matters of detail will naturally require further consideration.
H11 190 *<*1Personal Health and Welfare Services and Children's Services*>
H11 191    |^*027. There was no doubt in the Commission's mind that these
H11 192 services, with the exception of the ambulance service, should all be
H11 193 organised on as local a basis as possible; they recommend that they
H11 194 should become a borough responsibility. ^The Government agree with
H11 195 this conclusion. ^They concur also in the belief that positive
H11 196 advantages will follow from the concentration of responsibility for
H11 197 these services, and other associated ones such as housing and
H11 198 environmental health, in the hands of the same authorities.
H11 199 *<*1Housing*>
H11 200    |^*028. The Government accept the Royal Commission's main
H11 201 conclusion that housing is essentially a borough service.

H12   2 ^*0For example, in one of the factories studied, which packed domestic
H12   3 goods, output per man hour increased by 75 per cent and earnings by 40
H12   4 per cent, and the wages cost per unit was reduced by 20 per cent, in a
H12   5 period of two years following the introduction of the financial
H12   6 incentive scheme.
H12   7    |^Although the Birmingham study suggests that financial incentives
H12   8 are effective in influencing the behaviour of workers, it also shows
H12   9 that the effects may vary a great deal from factory to factory. ^Where
H12  10 high output is already being achieved, the introduction of a financial
H12  11 incentive may make little or no difference. ^In other circumstances,
H12  12 however, the effect may be quite marked. ^In yet others, there may be
H12  13 influences at work which prevent a scheme from having the intended
H12  14 effect. ^It is always difficult to anticipate precisely what the
H12  15 effect will be, or to make any useful statement about the relationship
H12  16 between the financial incentive on the one hand, and effort or output
H12  17 on the other, which would apply in all circumstances. ^But it is
H12  18 obviously useful to know what influences are likely to affect the
H12  19 success of financial incentive schemes, and to be aware of some of the
H12  20 practical difficulties which may arise. ^The evidence from intensive
H12  21 studies of workshop behaviour by social scientists in Britain and
H12  22 {0U.S.A.} will now be discussed briefly.
H12  23 *<*2THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOCIAL GROUP*>
H12  24    |^*0Observation of behaviour in workshops often reveals that levels
H12  25 of output and earnings under financial incentive schemes are
H12  26 controlled by groups of workers. ^This is possible because, by their
H12  27 very design, such schemes leave the worker some freedom to regulate
H12  28 the relationship between effort and reward, hence providing scope for
H12  29 manipulation. ^The extent of this, and the desire to manipulate, will
H12  30 vary from workshop to workshop, according to the degree of
H12  31 machine-pacing of work, and the effectiveness of other managerial
H12  32 controls. ^It will also depend on whether workers want to set their
H12  33 own standards of output and earnings. ^If they do, and if their
H12  34 standards are lower than those considered as reasonable by managers,
H12  35 such behaviour is usually called *'restriction of output**'.
H12  36 ^Behaviour of this kind and the judgements which are made about it,
H12  37 reveal that the ideas of managers and workers will often differ about
H12  38 a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.
H12  39    |^The existence of such discrepant ideas has long been recognized.
H12  40 ^{0F. W.} Taylor, a pioneer of scientific management, used the
H12  41 colourful term *1*'systematic soldiering**' *0to describe control over
H12  42 output by the working group, when the group's standards were lower
H12  43 than management hoped for or expected. ^He believed that this could be
H12  44 overcome by the scientific setting of standards, by more efficient
H12  45 methods of working and managerial control, and by the offer of cash
H12  46 incentives to workers, specially selected as suitable to perform
H12  47 certain tasks defined by management. ^In Taylor's scheme, which has
H12  48 been widely adopted in various forms, the onus is upon management to
H12  49 develop more effective techniques of control over the production
H12  50 process. ^Often investigators, including Taylor himself, have argued
H12  51 that to change attitudes is equally important, if not more so. ^{0P.
H12  52 E.} Vernon argued, for example, that the *1*'economic fallacy**' *0of
H12  53 restriction of output*- {0i.e.}, that it is in the workers' best
H12  54 interests*- could be overcome if workers were better educated, and
H12  55 allowed a greater share in management.
H12  56    |^Later researches suggest that these investigators over-stressed
H12  57 economic rationalism as a motive in worker behaviour. ^Social
H12  58 scientists have pointed out that the behaviour of an individual is
H12  59 largely controlled by the rules and customs of society as a whole and
H12  60 of the groups within it to which he belongs. ^He is rewarded when he
H12  61 conforms to the rules, and punished when he deviates from them. ^A
H12  62 very powerful social sanction, for example, is *1*'sending to
H12  63 Coventry**' *0which cuts the deviant off from social communication
H12  64 with other members of his group. ^In a society like our own, which is
H12  65 highly differentiated along lines of occupation and social class, and
H12  66 which is built up of a multitude of interlinked groupings and
H12  67 specialized activities, it is not surprising that differing standards
H12  68 emerge, which are preserved and maintained in the processes of group
H12  69 life.
H12  70    |^All this was illustrated in the well-known Hawthorne experiments
H12  71 carried out in the {0U.S.A.} ^The investigators, who watched the
H12  72 behaviour of the workers in the Bank Wiring Room concluded that the
H12  73 workers kept output at a steady level below the limit set by normal
H12  74 fatigue, not because they were, as individuals, pursuing well-defined
H12  75 economic interests but because they feared that to behave otherwise
H12  76 would promote external pressure to break up the group. ^The workers
H12  77 explained their behaviour, it is true, by reference to their fear of
H12  78 rate-cutting, or working themselves out of a job, and so on. ^But
H12  79 these explanations seemed to the investigators to be rationalizations
H12  80 of behaviour which had itself arisen from deep-rooted psychological
H12  81 and social needs. ^There is much evidence which supports the view that
H12  82 workers may be willing to forgo greater cash rewards to maintain
H12  83 pleasant social relationships and other satisfactions, such as control
H12  84 over the working environment. ^If this is so the attempt to tighten
H12  85 management control over the behaviour of individual workers*- by the
H12  86 techniques which Taylor, amongst others, advocated*- may well be felt
H12  87 as a threat to the working group, and may generate sufficient
H12  88 resistance to nullify the intended effects of the techniques
H12  89 themselves.
H12  90    |^For a time after the classic Hawthorne studies, some observers of
H12  91 behaviour in workshops were so concerned to stress the importance of
H12  92 social satisfaction that they tended to ignore the continuing
H12  93 influence of economic needs on the behaviour of workers. ^Recently
H12  94 some writers have suggested that a worker may gain both social and
H12  95 economic satisfaction, because controls over output and earnings
H12  96 maintained by the group may also be intended to serve economic
H12  97 objectives, and may consciously be designed to do so.
H12  98    |^A recent Manchester University study, supporting this kind of
H12  99 conclusion, was carried out in an engineering workshop, where a group
H12 100 of workers manipulated a complicated incentive scheme by an unofficial
H12 101 procedure which they described as *1*'cross-booking**'. ^*0The
H12 102 incentive scheme was designed to reward individual workers according
H12 103 to the proportion of time saved on *1*'allowed times**' *0based on
H12 104 time-study data. ^The workers found that some of these times were
H12 105 *1*'loose**', *0that is, much time could be saved and bonus earned,
H12 106 with relatively little effort. ^Other times were *1*'tight**',
H12 107 *0requiring much effort to effect substantial saving and bonus. ^This
H12 108 group had devised a procedure which balanced the effects of tight and
H12 109 loose allowed times. ^A proportion of the time saved on loose jobs was
H12 110 not declared by the men when they filled in their time sheets. ^The
H12 111 men claimed that this procedure had two effects: the existence of
H12 112 loose times was concealed from the management, and the time which they
H12 113 had saved but had not declared, could be *1*'banked**' *0and then
H12 114 *1*'booked**' *0on to tight jobs to make them pay. ^The workers
H12 115 claimed that this procedure enabled them to stabilize effort and
H12 116 earnings and, at the same time, to protect themselves, by concealing
H12 117 the loose rates, from rate-cutting by management. ^To book straight,
H12 118 they argued, would have also led to wide fluctuations in their
H12 119 earnings since the proportions of tight and loose rates which would be
H12 120 allocated to them in any week could not be accurately predicted.
H12 121    |^To check the workers' claim that cross-booking stabilized
H12 122 earnings, an investigation was made of the wages records. ^Comparisons
H12 123 of the earnings of persons who cross-booked with those of the few
H12 124 deviants who booked straight seemed to support the claim, as the graph
H12 125 shows (see \0p. 14).
H12 126    |^These and other similar studies suggest that the manipulation of
H12 127 incentive schemes by groups of workers is an attempt to put into
H12 128 effect their ideas of a fair day's work. ^If the ideas of managers and
H12 129 workers differ about what a worker ought to produce in a day, it is to
H12 130 be expected that both parties will try to express these ideas in
H12 131 behaviour: management by procedures of administrative control, and
H12 132 workers by individual or by group action.
H12 133    |^The question as to why ideas about a fair day's work should
H12 134 differ will be discussed in a later section. ^But the realization that
H12 135 ideas *1do *0differ and that financial incentive schemes offer scope
H12 136 to groups of workers for expression of their ideas has led to the
H12 137 emergence of other methods of wage payment which will encourage
H12 138 workers to aim for standards which managers regard as appropriate.
H12 139 **[GRAPH**]
H12 140 *<*2GROUP BONUS AND OTHER SCHEMES*>
H12 141    |^*0It might appear that the use of group bonus schemes in place of
H12 142 individual incentive schemes would provide an answer to the problem of
H12 143 the influence of social groups on output. ^Such schemes seem to offer
H12 144 no threat to group solidarity and social satisfaction. ^They may even
H12 145 enhance them. ^Yet, at the same time, the group may behave as an
H12 146 individual is supposed to do*- {0i.e.} to increase output and earn
H12 147 as much as possible. ^There is little in reason or experience,
H12 148 however, which lends support to this view. ^It is true that some
H12 149 processes lend themselves easily to systems of group payment as, for
H12 150 example, in the steel industry where many processes are operated by
H12 151 crews of men. ^But there is nothing in such schemes to ensure that
H12 152 output levels will meet management expectations if the crews decide
H12 153 otherwise. ^The scope for control still exists. ^Group bonus schemes
H12 154 may or may not encourage a sense of common purpose, depending on other
H12 155 circumstances.
H12 156    |^Group bonus schemes pose their own special problems. ^If workers
H12 157 perform different tasks, difficulties may arise over dividing the
H12 158 group earnings in accordance with the different contributions of
H12 159 individuals. ^Even where workers perform similar tasks, individual
H12 160 differences in skill and application may make any simple division of
H12 161 earnings seem unfair, and may adversely affect relationships within
H12 162 the group. ^Instances have been reported where workers have asked
H12 163 managers to replace group by individual incentives, for this very
H12 164 reason.
H12 165    |^In recent years the idea has been gaining ground that the kinds
H12 166 of financial incentive scheme discussed above are an inefficient means
H12 167 of managerial control. ^Since they leave workers free to make
H12 168 individual or collective decisions about the relationships between
H12 169 effort and reward, they weaken managerial control over the productive
H12 170 process, and affect the capacity of the management accurately to set
H12 171 standards and to plan programmes of work. ^Attention has therefore
H12 172 been turned to the development of systems of payment which offer a
H12 173 regular weekly sum to individuals in return for a consistent level of
H12 174 measured performance. ^In such schemes payment is not related directly
H12 175 to pieces produced or to time saved. ^They take the form of a contract
H12 176 in which the individual undertakes to maintain a certain pace of work
H12 177 in return for a weekly wage. ^One effect of this is that management is
H12 178 better able to predict and plan. ^Another is that the onus is placed
H12 179 on managers and supervisors to see that workers have enough work to do
H12 180 to fulfil their obligations under the contract. ^Some schemes provide
H12 181 that if a worker shows himself capable of reaching and maintaining a
H12 182 higher pace of work, he can be given a higher weekly wage. ^So there
H12 183 is still an incentive to increase output.
H12 184    |^Schemes such as this, like individual and group piece-work or
H12 185 bonus schemes, raise practical problems of setting rates or measuring
H12 186 standards of performance, {0i.e.} the translation of ideas of a
H12 187 proper day's work into terms of physical output or effort. ^It will be
H12 188 argued here that procedures for setting rates, however refined, do not
H12 189 by themselves solve any of the problems raised by the existence of
H12 190 differing notions of a proper day's work. ^But it is necessary in any
H12 191 discussion of financial incentive schemes to describe and evaluate
H12 192 these procedures.
H12 193 *<*2THE PROBLEM OF RATE SETTING*>
H12 194    |^*0Before the stop-watch was widely introduced for timing
H12 195 industrial work, piece-work schemes were usually based on times
H12 196 estimated by supervisors, who relied on personal judgement based on
H12 197 past experience. ^This method, sometimes referred to as
H12 198 *1*'guesstimating**', *0is still employed.

H15   2    |^*0I do not know what the right \0hon. Gentleman means by *"large
H15   3 part of the country.**" ^For all I know, over a geographical area what
H15   4 he says may be true. ^For example, let us consider the area in which
H15   5 the \0hon. Member for Exeter plays such a large part. ^If the
H15   6 Government knock down one cottage in the middle of Dartmoor, they may
H15   7 be removing all the slums over a wide area. ^But if the Minister
H15   8 means, by *"large part**", areas where people are living in great
H15   9 concentrations of population, then the answer is that the areas that
H15  10 are not keeping up with the slum clearance programme represent the
H15  11 majority of unfit houses in the country.
H15  12    |^The figures which the right \0hon. Gentleman quoted in the White
H15  13 Paper, relating to 50 local authorities who were behindhand in their
H15  14 programmes, included authorities in some of our great industrial
H15  15 areas. ^If, when he talks about the problem being solved over a large
H15  16 part of the country, he is merely noting that in Torquay, for
H15  17 instance, 41 out of 42 houses were demolished in five years, I give
H15  18 him his figures, but we know that in the great industrial areas the
H15  19 situation is completely different.
H15  20    |^The right \0hon. Gentleman is entitled to make the point that he
H15  21 is not solely responsible for slum clearance, and that it is a
H15  22 question of partnership between him and the local authorities. ^When
H15  23 things go well, we do not hear much about the contributions made by
H15  24 local authorities, but we are likely to hear about them when things go
H15  25 badly. ^What are the reasons for the slow completion of the slum
H15  26 clearance programmes? ^He gave first priority to the shortage of
H15  27 technical staff, but I would like to point out one reason for that
H15  28 shortage.
H15  29    |^Up to 1957, local authorities had been encouraged to build up the
H15  30 technical staffs in their housing departments, under the drive of the
H15  31 early years, but then they were suddenly faced with a drastic cut in
H15  32 their programmes, imposed by the Government, and they had to turn away
H15  33 their technical staffs, who found work elsewhere. ^That was not the
H15  34 fault of local authorities. ^Once an establishment has been arrived at
H15  35 for carrying out a certain programme it is very difficult to maintain
H15  36 it if Government interference causes frequent fluctuations in that
H15  37 programme.
H15  38    |^One of the alarming things that the Minister said was in reply to
H15  39 a Question put by my \0hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East (\0Mr.
H15  40 Mapp). ^He said that he hoped to see the recruitment of technical
H15  41 staff improved by the engagement of staffs from other local
H15  42 authorities as they completed their slum clearance programmes. ^That
H15  43 was a rather nasty shock for local authorities who were hoping that
H15  44 when they had completed their slum clearance programmes they would be
H15  45 able to go on with their other necessary programmes*- perhaps to
H15  46 increase their programmes for houses for the old people, for the sick
H15  47 and the disabled, and also to expand their programme of houses for
H15  48 general needs. ^By his Answer the right \0hon. Gentleman was saying
H15  49 that when local authorities completed their slum clearance programme
H15  50 he was going to cut down their programmes for other forms of house
H15  51 building to force the transference of technical staffs to those areas
H15  52 which had still to complete their slum clearance programmes.
H15  53    |^Another difficulty has been the rise in the cost of land, about
H15  54 which the House has had a good deal to say. ^There are two aspects of
H15  55 this problem. ^There is the special problem of areas in which there is
H15  56 an excessive demand for land, about which I do not want to say much at
H15  57 the moment. ^But even in areas where there is no reason to suppose
H15  58 that the demand for land is abnormal the price has risen enormously.
H15  59 ^My constituency of Widnes is in an industrial part of Lancashire,
H15  60 which is not developing very rapidly. ^Nevertheless, although only
H15  61 five or six years ago *+500 an acre was considered a fairly stiff
H15  62 price to pay, in the last few compulsory purchase orders it has made
H15  63 that local authority has been paying over *+7,000 an acre. ^That is
H15  64 some measure of the obstacles which face a local authority which is
H15  65 trying to carry out its slum clearance programme.
H15  66    |^The question of the interest rate affects both the cost of land
H15  67 and the increased cost of building. ^Local authorities are caught both
H15  68 ways. ^They are caught in relation to their normal costs, because any
H15  69 increase in the rate of interest means an immediate increase in rents.
H15  70 ^They are also caught by the excessive cost of all the auxiliary
H15  71 services which have to be added to the actual building cost. ^In this
H15  72 connection, the Government issued some interesting figures, which I
H15  73 propose to use rather than my own, because we must presume that the
H15  74 Government figures are fairly accurate. ^If a rate of interest of 3
H15  75 3/4 per \0cent.*- which is about equivalent to the Public Works Loan
H15  76 Board rate in 1950*- is compared not with the present rate of 6 1/8
H15  77 per \0cent., but 5 3/4 per \0cent., the difference in respect of the
H15  78 loan charges on a house costing *+1,500 is about *+32 5\0s. a year.
H15  79 ^That may not seem a great deal of money, but it is enough to knock
H15  80 out even a *+24 subsidy. ^In other words, over the last ten years the
H15  81 Government have really not been paying any subsidy at all. ^They have
H15  82 been increasing costs by raising the rate of interest on loans while
H15  83 increasing the subsidies by a figure not nearly enough to meet the
H15  84 extra costs caused thereby.
H15  85    |^We can, therefore, say that the present unhappy position in slum
H15  86 clearance is largely due to the obstacles placed in the way of local
H15  87 authorities either directly or indirectly, by Government policy. ^I do
H15  88 not know what the current estimates will be, but in last year's
H15  89 estimates the amount of money paid out in subsidy for expensive sites
H15  90 rose very drastically. ^Was that due to the fact that more expensive
H15  91 land was being used, or that the Government were having to pay
H15  92 expensive site subsidies on ordinary land in areas where no such
H15  93 subsidy would have had to be paid before? ^I suspect that the second
H15  94 alternative was the cause of the increased estimates.
H15  95    |^I now turn to the question of overspill, in respect of which it
H15  96 is very difficult to discover what has been happening. ^It is one of
H15  97 the engaging peculiarities of the situation that the Scottish Housing
H15  98 Return gives figures relating to the rehousing of people from
H15  99 overspill areas while the right \0hon. Gentleman as far as I know, is
H15 100 careful never to give any such figures. ^I do not know what has been
H15 101 happening. ^All I know is that some years ago the Permanent Secretary
H15 102 reckoned that about 2 million people were required to move from the
H15 103 great towns, and that that meant the building of over 500,000 houses.
H15 104 ^If that information is married with the estimate of a former Minister
H15 105 of Housing and Local Government*- the present Secretary of State for
H15 106 Commonwealth Relations*- that 20,000 houses were needed annually for
H15 107 overspill, we see that that envisages a programme lasting for about
H15 108 twenty-five years, which is a fairly long-term project. ^It is much
H15 109 more than even the development of a single new town. ^The last figures
H15 110 I have seen, which related to 1958, showed that under 10,000 houses
H15 111 were being provided to accommodate overspill. ^I do not know what has
H15 112 happened since, but I suspect that, if anything, things have got
H15 113 worse.
H15 114    |^Let us now consider the right \0hon. Gentleman's attitude towards
H15 115 the new towns, which form a very important part of the whole problem.
H15 116 ^For many years it has been very difficult to get the right \0hon.
H15 117 Gentleman to *"come clean**" on the question whether or not he
H15 118 intended to build any new towns. ^For a long time he was rather
H15 119 evasive about it. ^In a debate in July, 1960, he said:
H15 120    |^*"I do not rule out the idea of other new towns... ^It is easy
H15 121 for the Leader of the Opposition to suggest the idea of more and more
H15 122 new towns as a complete solution, but he never addressed himself, in
H15 123 his speech, to where these new towns should go.**"*- ^[*2OFFICIAL
H15 124 REPORT, *018th July, 1960; \0Vol. 627, \0c. 56-7.]
H15 125    |^If one read that statement in the context of the New Towns Act,
H15 126 it was reasonable to assume*- and I think that most people assumed*-
H15 127 that the Government were not intending to provide any new towns,
H15 128 either because they could not find sites, or because they did not want
H15 129 to. ^When the New Towns Bill was being considered, the Government were
H15 130 implored again and again to provide compensation for redundancy, or to
H15 131 give a glimmer of hope to the people employed in the new town
H15 132 corporations that they would get employment in other new towns. ^All
H15 133 that the right \0hon. Gentleman would say was that when the new towns
H15 134 were completed there would be openings for them in the general
H15 135 administration of the new towns. ^But at no time was he prepared to
H15 136 give any hope that other new towns would be provided.
H15 137    |^The right \0hon. Gentleman would not pay compensation for the
H15 138 people who were made redundant. ^The demoralising effect on the staff
H15 139 of the new towns was deplorable. ^Naturally, the people who were faced
H15 140 with the possibility of their jobs coming to an end, the best people,
H15 141 the younger people, the people who had most hope in getting out of the
H15 142 new towns back into either other aspects of public service or into
H15 143 private enterprise, took every opportunity to get out because they
H15 144 knew that, sooner or later, their jobs would come to an end and as far
H15 145 as they could see there was no hope of any alternative form of
H15 146 employment.
H15 147    |^What has happened now? ^In 1951, a preliminary plan was prepared
H15 148 for Lancashire, to include Parbold as a new town. ^In the final plan
H15 149 that was submitted in 1956, Skelmersdale, which was approximately the
H15 150 same, was designated by the Lancashire County Council as a new town
H15 151 area. ^That was cut out of the 1956 plan. ^As late as July, 1960, the
H15 152 right \0hon. Gentleman was still saying that he could not find sites
H15 153 for the new towns, yet within a matter of six months he was telling us
H15 154 in the House that he had decided to approve Skelmersdale as a new
H15 155 town. ^Could anything be more crazy?
H15 156    |^Could anything be more crazy than to demoralise the staff, to
H15 157 break up the morale of the corporations, to do all one can to create
H15 158 the impression that the new towns are a dying industry, and then, when
H15 159 one has successfully done that, to resurrect a new town which was
H15 160 suggested originally in 1951 and suddenly decide to approve it? ^I
H15 161 have seen some of this. ^Widnes is a reception area for Liverpool. ^We
H15 162 have been vitally concerned about whether new towns would be built. ^I
H15 163 am sure that everybody concerned with the problem was under the
H15 164 impression that the Ministry had decided not to build a new town in
H15 165 Lancashire. ^Now I am delighted that we are to have one. ^If there is
H15 166 to be a new town, could there be a more crazy and incompetent way of
H15 167 setting about getting a successful new town than the method adopted by
H15 168 the Government?
H15 169    |^What is required from the right \0hon. Gentleman is more than a
H15 170 few new towns dotted about here and there. ^What is required is a
H15 171 determined effort to relocate not only people, but industry, away from
H15 172 London and the South. ^The Co-operative Permanent Building Society
H15 173 sends out an interesting bulletin about the price of houses on which
H15 174 it has lent money. ^It points out that the outstanding feature of the
H15 175 property market during 1960 was the marked rise in the price of houses
H15 176 in the London area and in the Home Counties.

H16   1 **[280 TEXT H16**]
H16   2    |^*0Behind Clause 1 there is the conception of fairness and justice
H16   3 between child and child. ^Our Amendment merely carries this conception
H16   4 of justice further. ^We want it to obtain between non-graduates and
H16   5 non-graduates under different local authorities, and between the
H16   6 students who come under Clause 1 and those under Clause 2.
H16   7    |^This underlines what my \0hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East
H16   8 (\0Mrs. White) has said about grants. ^The Minister has said nothing
H16   9 about the incomes scale on which grants under this Clause are to be
H16  10 assessed. ^Surely in the grants made to students once the local
H16  11 authority has said they ought to pursue their further education, there
H16  12 can be no defensible variations between one local authority and
H16  13 another. ^We used to hear talk about major and minor awards, and I
H16  14 thought we had wiped out that foolish stratification. ^This Clause if
H16  15 unamended permits the widest variation even in the amount of grants.
H16  16 ^I think that this is the most important point which has so far
H16  17 emerged in this debate, and I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary
H16  18 has said nothing about it.
H16  19    |^I have often had to fight a battle for a student who has been
H16  20 refused a grant by a local education authority and in the best cases
H16  21 both the local authority and myself have gone to the Minister. ^We
H16  22 have received advice and information from the Ministry and that has
H16  23 meant usually that either the local authority has accepted ministerial
H16  24 advice if the authority had been wrong or I have accepted it if I was
H16  25 wrong. ^The Ministry is in a position to know more than even the best
H16  26 local education authority. ^That is the pattern we are now seeking to
H16  27 establish in legislation. ^Under the *"permissive**" powers, however,
H16  28 in the worst cases when the Ministry was right and the {0M.P.} was
H16  29 right the local authority could still dig its heels in and say that
H16  30 whatever the Ministry said it was not going to give a grant.
H16  31    |^The Minister said there are practical difficulties about
H16  32 implementing an Amendment, and suggested it was not possible to
H16  33 include all the courses into the regulations. ^Nobody would wish to
H16  34 write in the course of two or three lectures only to which he referred
H16  35 and behind which he sheltered. ^What we envisage in Clause 2 is the
H16  36 same pattern as in Clause 1 where we write into the regulations every
H16  37 criterion, everything that is possible to apply nationally. ^Most of
H16  38 the courses that we are talking about there is no difficulty in
H16  39 defining and no difficulty in putting in the regulations.
H16  40    |^On top of that, Clause 1 (4) says:
H16  41    |^*"Without prejudice to the duty imposed by subsection (1) of this
H16  42 Section, a local education authority shall have power to bestow an
H16  43 award on any person in respect of his attendance...**"
H16  44    |^In this Clause, too, we would write in such a provision, and
H16  45 leave with the authority the right and privilege of being more
H16  46 generous than the regulations. ^What we are asking the Minister to do
H16  47 is to set out in regulations the many courses we know about which have
H16  48 national status and those which we might describe as having a kind of
H16  49 local national status. ^If the student is of the right calibre to
H16  50 pursue a course, which the Ministry enacts is a worthwhile full-time
H16  51 course, he shall receive the same justice from Britain whatever
H16  52 authority he happens to have been born under.
H16  53 *<11.15 {0a.m.}*>
H16  54    |^The Parliamentary Secretary said that there was nothing to worry
H16  55 about, that the Government had looked into the position and that there
H16  56 were no complaints. ^Whether the Minister is aware of it or not, the
H16  57 whole case for the Bill is that there has been a sort of ground swell
H16  58 of complaints which, over the years, have become more and more
H16  59 insistent. ^There has not been justice between student and student.
H16  60 ^Whatever is true about the university students with whom Clause 1
H16  61 deals is true about the variety of other students with whom Clause 2
H16  62 deals. ^What the \0hon. Gentleman is asking us to do is to leave
H16  63 everybody, except first degree students, in exactly the position they
H16  64 were in before the Bill. ^I share the passionate view on this that my
H16  65 \0hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East showed in her speech at our
H16  66 last meeting, and I hope that it will be possible for the Committee,
H16  67 even now, to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary to change his mind.
H16  68    |^*4\0Mrs. Eirene White: ^*0I cannot understand how the
H16  69 Parliamentary Secretary can suppose that in his answer today he dealt
H16  70 with the matter which we have raised. ^We are here dealing with the
H16  71 whole corpus of students other than those going to universities, but
H16  72 all we have had from the Parliamentary Secretary has been a few
H16  73 perfunctory remarks at the beginning of our deliberations this
H16  74 morning.
H16  75    |^That means that one has to go back to the beginning and spell out
H16  76 for the Committee what it is that we are really discussing. ^We cannot
H16  77 leave the situation like this. ^I want to quote a paragraph from the
H16  78 Ministry Circular 5/61 which is the present practice and which is now
H16  79 being embodied in statutory form in the Bill. ^Paragraph 9 says:
H16  80    |^*"Applications for awards for university diploma or certificate
H16  81 courses.**"
H16  82    |^This gives a very important group of people
H16  83    |^*"Non-graduates taking full-time university diploma or
H16  84 certificate courses lasting for three years or more should receive
H16  85 awards in accordance with paragraph 8 (a) above.**"
H16  86    |^That is, roughly in the same way as those in Clause 1.
H16  87    |^*"Awards for other diploma or certificate courses should be
H16  88 considered on their merits.**"
H16  89    |^That is all that is said in the circular about non-university and
H16  90 non-teacher training college students. ^We are now speaking of people
H16  91 who are taking courses other than university degree or comparable to
H16  92 degree courses. ^This is a very important group which the circular
H16  93 mentions merely by saying that their cases should be considered on
H16  94 their merits. ^There is no guidance or direction from the Minister.
H16  95    |^In addition to this group of people who go to universities and
H16  96 who take, for example, a social science diploma, which is normally a
H16  97 two-year and not a three-year course, or the Diploma of Public
H16  98 Administration at Oxford, which is also a two-year and not a
H16  99 three-year course, there are tens and possibly hundreds of thousands
H16 100 of students taking full-time courses at technical colleges. ^All those
H16 101 are being dismissed by the Minister.
H16 102    |^If \0hon. Members have any doubts about this, I refer them to the
H16 103 present practice. ^My \0hon. Friend the Member for Southampton,
H16 104 Itchen (\0Dr. King) said he thought that minor awards had been
H16 105 abolished. ^I am sorry to say that this is not so. ^Certain local
H16 106 authorities have abolished minor awards for full-time education, but
H16 107 not all. ^London County Council reached the very proper conclusion
H16 108 that minor awards were not suitable for full-time students.
H16 109    |^The National Union of Students has investigated this matter. ^As
H16 110 all \0hon. Members are aware, it issues a very useful book on grants
H16 111 to students which it brings up to date every year and which it sends
H16 112 to all education authorities, including those in the Channel Islands,
H16 113 and the total number of which is 149. ^The Union gets replies from
H16 114 nearly, but not quite, all of them. ^Of those who replied to the
H16 115 question of what awards were given to full-time students over the age
H16 116 of 18 attending technical college courses not of degree or equivalent
H16 117 status*- in other words the people with whom Clause 2 deals*- the
H16 118 Union got the following replies: 67 authorities give minor awards of
H16 119 varying value and assessment; 11 give major awards; 13 give major
H16 120 awards dependent on qualifications; 10 base their awards on costs; 11
H16 121 consider each case on its merits. ^Certain authorities*- I will not
H16 122 shame them by naming them*- give no awards at all. ^Others give
H16 123 assistance only with travel costs. ^One authority offers what it calls
H16 124 a home scholarship for the final year of the student's attendance at
H16 125 the local college.
H16 126    |^It is perfectly plain from that that the practice of authorities
H16 127 in dealing with students taking full-time courses at universities for
H16 128 less than three years, or at technical colleges or at other
H16 129 institutions of comparable standard where the student is 18 or more at
H16 130 the time*- and let us deal only with that group for the moment*-
H16 131 varies very widely. ^I will not now deal with the little difficulty,
H16 132 which the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, about the person who goes
H16 133 for only a few lectures, or who takes up something which is obviously
H16 134 a hobby. ^I am now dealing with those taking full-time courses for a
H16 135 considerable period*- say, a minimum of one academic year. ^Many would
H16 136 be taking courses for two years and those at technical colleges
H16 137 perhaps for much longer. ^Those are full-time students pursuing
H16 138 serious studies.
H16 139    |^The practice among authorities obviously varies, not only on the
H16 140 question of the parental means scale, with which I dealt fairly
H16 141 emphatically last week and which the Parliamentary Secretary did not
H16 142 even mention, not only in the way they assess parental incomes, but in
H16 143 the amounts which they give.
H16 144    |^I have with me information which has been collected by the
H16 145 National Union of Students and I will quote a few of the replies which
H16 146 it received last year. ^This concerns grants current in the academic
H16 147 year 1961-62 for full-time students over the age of 18 and attending
H16 148 full-time at technical colleges, taking courses which are not for a
H16 149 degree or of comparable status. ^These figures may be subject to some
H16 150 parental means test, but we are not arguing about that at the moment.
H16 151 ^The maximum grant which an authority awards to students who qualify
H16 152 for full grant is *+180, plus travel, in Kent; *+80 in Devon; *+125 in
H16 153 West Ham; *+115, plus travel in West Hartlepools; *+163 in
H16 154 Warwickshire; there is no day grant in Pembrokeshire if the student is
H16 155 living at home, but there is for those taking a residential course;
H16 156 the figure is *+120 in Cardiff. ^In all of those cases tuition fees
H16 157 are paid by the authority, but that practice is not universal. ^My own
H16 158 authority of Flint, I am sorry to say, does not pay tuition fees. ^One
H16 159 has to apply, but one is lucky if one gets tuition fees paid.
H16 160    |^Those taking full-time courses at technical colleges and living
H16 161 away from home*- and this happens in many parts of the country where
H16 162 children from rural areas have to go into residence*- again have
H16 163 fantastic discrepancies in the amounts which their authorities are
H16 164 prepared to award to them. ^For the same group of authorities the
H16 165 residential maxima are: *+260 in Kent; between *+114 and *+180 in
H16 166 Devon; *+185 in West Ham; *+175 plus travel in West Hartlepools; *+218
H16 167 in Warwickshire; *+183 in Pembrokeshire; *+210 in Cardiff.
H16 168    |^What possible justice is there in having all those full-time
H16 169 students at technical colleges treated like that? ^What possible
H16 170 defence is there for treating university students under Clause 1 as
H16 171 they are treated and technical college students under Clause 2 in
H16 172 another way? ^We may have something to say about discretion being
H16 173 given for part-time students, or for those taking what might be called
H16 174 hobby courses in further education establishments, but there is no
H16 175 conceivable ground on which the Minister can argue that he can do for
H16 176 university students what he is proposing to do while refusing to do it
H16 177 for full-time technical college students, or university students
H16 178 taking a course of less than three years' duration.
H16 179    |^The Parliamentary Secretary has only one excuse and it is that he
H16 180 is afraid to pay the cost. ^As he well knows we have had a letter from
H16 181 local authorities saying that by Clause 1 they are being made
H16 182 virtually the Minister's agents and that their discretion is being so
H16 183 much diminished that in effect they will simply administer a national
H16 184 service and the total expenditure in those circumstances ought to be a
H16 185 national charge and not paid out of the rates.

H17   2 ^*0They had great hopes, and as the years have gone by they have had a
H17   3 certain feeling of disappointment. ^I shall touch upon some of the
H17   4 reasons for that disappointment and enquire what we should do to make
H17   5 improvement in the general conduct of this branch of our affairs.
H17   6    |^The noble Lord, Lord Strang, has done splendid work*- and I
H17   7 gladly add my tribute to those paid by others*- as Chairman for so
H17   8 long of the National Parks Commission; and he has had a hard row to
H17   9 hoe. ^He has done that in those intervals allowed to him while
H17  10 composing his important work, recently published, which I confess I
H17  11 have not yet read, but fully intend to read, laying out the historical
H17  12 permanence of British foreign policy over a long period. ^In addition
H17  13 to all that scholarly use of his leisure he has found time for the
H17  14 daily handling of the problems of our national parks, and I am sure
H17  15 that we are all grateful to him. ^As has been said by my noble friend
H17  16 beside me, the noble Lord, Lord Strang, has had some splendid
H17  17 colleagues. ^My noble friend Lord Lawson, whose political life was
H17  18 much intertwined with mine, asks me to say that he is very sorry he
H17  19 cannot be here to-day to listen to, and take part in, our debate. ^The
H17  20 reason is his wife's ill-health, and I am sure the sympathy of all of
H17  21 us will go out to both of them.
H17  22    |^My noble friend Lord Lawson acted as Deputy Chairman of the
H17  23 National Parks Commission in the early years, and I remember that some
H17  24 of us thought it a good tactical move to have an ex-Secretary of State
H17  25 for War in that important position; because we felt it might be
H17  26 possible for him to chase away generals from certain areas of which I
H17  27 am thinking, in County Durham and Teesdale where, it seemed to us*-
H17  28 and this was apprehended elsewhere*- that they had requisitioned
H17  29 rather more land for use as artillery ranges than was reasonably
H17  30 justifiable. ^Indeed, there were rumours at that time, in that area on
H17  31 the Pennine Way, that there might be a clash between the troops and
H17  32 the embattled contingents of ramblers from Durham and Yorkshire. ^But
H17  33 all that was avoided, and I believe that the diplomatic gifts as well
H17  34 as the military experience of my noble friend Lord Lawson contributed
H17  35 both to the maintenance of order and good will and to the opening of
H17  36 the Pennine Way throughout its length, which was something we were
H17  37 then very keen should be done.
H17  38    |^May I say a word or two now on some of the points which arise out
H17  39 of the work of the National Parks Commission? ^To some extent I shall
H17  40 be touching on points already made by previous speakers; but the first
H17  41 and primary point is, of course, finance. ^The National Parks
H17  42 Commission have been left practically destitute by the Treasury under
H17  43 successive Governments, and I agree very much with what was said in
H17  44 some detail by the noble Earl who preceded me. ^We thought (and I am
H17  45 one of those who were thinking, talking and planning how all this
H17  46 should be organised) that the National Parks Commission were a
H17  47 sufficiently important body, endowed with sufficiently important
H17  48 powers, to deserve to receive a direct annual grant from the Treasury,
H17  49 to be administered by the Chairman of the Commission and his
H17  50 colleagues in accordance with the requirements of the Act; and it was
H17  51 very disappointing to find that the Hobhouse Committee, to which the
H17  52 noble Earl referred in detail, fully agreed about not naming any
H17  53 special figure. ^The figure need not be a large one but a direct
H17  54 annual grant from the Treasury would help a great deal.
H17  55    |^I am quite sure that, so long as such a grant is lacking, the
H17  56 framework at the foundation will not be right. ^Therefore I hope that
H17  57 before long the present Minister of Housing and Local Government who,
H17  58 as we have heard, will be receiving many recommendations, will settle
H17  59 this point, in particular, so that the noble Lord, Lord Strang, and
H17  60 his successors will have something to distribute, at their discretion
H17  61 and, as the noble Earl suggested, between different national park
H17  62 areas. ^I think this a very important though essentially a simple
H17  63 matter. ^I once threw out a hint which has occasionally troubled the
H17  64 waters since. ^In my Budget speech of 1946, when I was Chancellor of
H17  65 the Exchequer (though we had no national parks at that time, for it
H17  66 was more than three years before the Act was passed), I spoke well of
H17  67 national parks, as I have done on other occasions. ^I threw out a hint
H17  68 (my idea would have required further legislation, which in the result
H17  69 was not forthcoming) that some financial assistance might be given
H17  70 from the National Land Fund, which was set up in that year, to
H17  71 national parks. ^I had in mind a certain once-for-all contribution of
H17  72 a capital nature that might probably be made. ^But all that, I regret
H17  73 to say, came to nothing. ^Although enthusiasts of national parks in
H17  74 another place, and perhaps here too, have from time to time returned
H17  75 to that charge, I regret to say that neither from that source nor from
H17  76 any other so far have national parks been reasonably financed. ^This
H17  77 is so simple a point that I hope very much that this defect may soon
H17  78 be remedied.
H17  79    |^I wish now to say a word about the long-distance routes. ^When I
H17  80 was younger I used to be what is now called a keen *"hiker**". ^I like
H17  81 walking considerable distances in beautiful country and in agreeable
H17  82 company, and I was very keen on this concept of the long-distance
H17  83 routes. ^They began, as your Lordships know, with the Pennine Way,
H17  84 which happened to run right through the constituency I then had the
H17  85 honour to represent, and also through a very beautiful area full of
H17  86 wild fell country and many lovely waterfalls and other natural
H17  87 beauties. ^It is a matter of regret*- and those are the actual words
H17  88 of the Commission themselves, and I think a very moderate form of
H17  89 words*- that those routes are not yet completely open.
H17  90    |^After the approval, if I remember the figure rightly, of some
H17  91 seven proposed long-distance routes (it was six or seven, or something
H17  92 of that order), which meant a great deal of hard work for the
H17  93 Commission and in surveying on the spot, even now, more than ten years
H17  94 after this work began, none of these long-distance routes is yet
H17  95 completely open to walkers or to horsemen in these beautiful areas. ^I
H17  96 understand that the reason for this very slow advance is simple: it is
H17  97 that there are no effective powers vested in the Commission for
H17  98 compulsory purchase, where necessary, of rights of way or rights of
H17  99 access at given points along these routes where access and rights of
H17 100 way do not now exist.
H17 101    |^I understand that there is a lot of detail that could be talked
H17 102 about here*- I am not going to talk about it*- concerning the relative
H17 103 powers of different local authorities and whether the Commission
H17 104 should have such powers vested in them, or whether they should be
H17 105 distributed among various local authorities. ^On that matter I do not
H17 106 express an opinion. ^I merely say that the remedy should be very
H17 107 simple, and it can be covered, I think, by the general formula used
H17 108 just now: there should be effective powers of compulsory purchase
H17 109 operated under the authority of the Commission in all cases where we
H17 110 still have not cleared the road, whether along the Pennine Way or
H17 111 Offa's Dyke or any of these long-distance routes. ^I am sure that
H17 112 there are great numbers of the younger and healthier and fitter
H17 113 citizens of this country who would appreciate very much the
H17 114 opportunity of extending their journeys by foot or on horseback*-
H17 115 because these routes are for riders on horseback, too*- along the
H17 116 bridle paths and quiet ways and well away from roads heavily crowded
H17 117 with motor and other vehicles. ^I hope that here, too, early action
H17 118 can be taken to amend the law in this regard and give the Commission
H17 119 power to carry out what was always regarded as a central and essential
H17 120 part of their mandate.
H17 121    |^It is sometimes said*- indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Strang,
H17 122 himself said it in a speech which was quite properly publicised in the
H17 123 Report of the Commission*- that there is perhaps a certain conflict in
H17 124 the Act setting up the Commission: two conflicting aims. ^It is often
H17 125 said that the duty of the Commission is, on the one hand, to preserve
H17 126 and enhance natural beauty, and on the other, to provide and improve
H17 127 facilities for public enjoyment of the parks. ^I do not myself believe
H17 128 that there is any serious or deep conflict there. ^I think we can
H17 129 achieve both aims by an application of reasonable give and take and,
H17 130 where necessary, consultation. ^I will touch upon that point again in
H17 131 a moment.
H17 132    |^I will say, first, a word (this point has been mentioned before)
H17 133 about the first aim: the preservation and enhancement of natural
H17 134 beauty. ^I am glad to hear it said*- and I have no reason to doubt the
H17 135 truth of what is said*- that there is here no real conflict between
H17 136 the Forestry Commission, of which I have been for many years a strong
H17 137 supporter, and others. ^I think that the Forestry Commission have done
H17 138 a grand job which was never done until they were set up, but I will
H17 139 not develop that point now, although on another occasion I may be
H17 140 tempted to. ^But there has, I think, occasionally been a little
H17 141 potential ill-will between the Forestry Commission and those
H17 142 associated with the open air societies and the national parks. ^There
H17 143 has been a certain emotion in the background about cone-bearing trees;
H17 144 and I will return to that in a moment.
H17 145    |^I am very glad to hear, however, that, in terms of practical
H17 146 politics now (my noble friend said so and I think that the noble Earl
H17 147 also repeated it), consultation proceeds agreeably between the various
H17 148 interests concerned: the park authorities, whether the central Parks
H17 149 Commission or the planning authorities for particular parks, with the
H17 150 Forestry Commission and also with timber growers and the Landowners'
H17 151 Association. ^There are three or four bodies concerned. ^I am
H17 152 delighted to hear that these bodies are getting on well together and
H17 153 can settle agreeably any disputes that arise with regard to the
H17 154 general problem of the preservation and enhancement of natural beauty,
H17 155 with particular reference to all this debatable afforestation.
H17 156    |^I will say a word or two, but not more, about afforestation. ^I
H17 157 am a great devotee of afforestation, and I often recall the great
H17 158 saying of Robert Louis Stevenson, that trees are the most civil
H17 159 society. ^In many moods and in many places that great thought is borne
H17 160 in upon me. ^I personally have had great pleasure through my life in
H17 161 passing very happy hours and days among beautiful woodlands and trees,
H17 162 both in this country and overseas. ^But Robert Louis Stevenson did not
H17 163 discriminate. ^He said, *"trees**" and he made no qualification or
H17 164 classification. ^Trees, he said, are the most civil society. ^He did
H17 165 not say, ~*"Trees other than whatever it may be you are suspicious of
H17 166 when you see it growing**"; he did not say, ~*"All trees other than
H17 167 conifers.**"
H17 168    |^I am always recalling that when I was a little boy I learnt that
H17 169 to plant a tree and, still more, to care for it when you have planted
H17 170 it, was a good deed which would leave your heritage better than when
H17 171 you found it. ^I learnt that then and I have believed it ever since,
H17 172 and I think it is still true. ^We in this country have, as is well
H17 173 known, a smaller percentage of our national area under trees of any
H17 174 kind than has any other country in Europe*- barely 6 per \0cent., if I
H17 175 remember the figure aright*- and I am very anxious, as a matter of
H17 176 national policy and national interest, to see the afforestation of
H17 177 this country carried further, with appropriate regard being had to
H17 178 soils and other matters, to what will grow and what will not, and so
H17 179 on.

H18  20    |^The case came before Cross, \0J., in the Chancery Division on
H18  21 13th July, 1960, when judgment was given in favour of the Crown, with
H18  22 costs.
H18  23    |^Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas, {0Q.C.}, and \0Mr. Alan Orr appeared as
H18  24 Counsel for the Crown, and \0Mr. {0P. J.} Brennan for the Company.
H18  25    |
H18  26    |^*4Cross, \0J.*- ^*0This case concerns the Profits Tax liability
H18  27 of the respondent Company, \0H. Dunning & \0Co. (1946), \0Ltd., for
H18  28 two chargeable accounting periods, 1st March, 1955, to 31st October,
H18  29 1955, and 1st November, 1955, to 29th February, 1956.
H18  30    |^The question arises in this way. ^The Company was incorporated in
H18  31 1946, and carries on the business of light engineering. ^It is
H18  32 director-controlled, within the meaning of the Profits Tax
H18  33 legislation. ^A \0Mr. Hawke has been a director of the Company since
H18  34 its incorporation, though he is not a whole-time service director, and
H18  35 he has been at all material times a member of the Company holding one
H18  36 *+1 share out of the 1,000 issued shares. ^In 1951 \0Mr. Hawke
H18  37 invented a special type of *"cable gland**" for engineering purposes
H18  38 and obtained patent protection for this invention some time in 1952.
H18  39 ^On 31st December, 1954, he entered into an agreement with the Company
H18  40 whereby he granted to the Company a licence for a period of years to
H18  41 manufacture and to sell the patented article, and the Company
H18  42 covenanted during the continuance of the licence to pay him a
H18  43 commission of *+7 10\0s. per \0cent. of the selling price of each
H18  44 patented article. ^There was provision for the termination of the
H18  45 agreement before the expiry of the period, and it was in fact
H18  46 terminated in September, 1955. ^It is found in the Case that that was
H18  47 a perfectly genuine commercial agreement under which the Company got
H18  48 full consideration for the payments which they had to make to \0Mr.
H18  49 Hawke. ^The total of the payments which were made under the agreement
H18  50 for the period from 1st March, 1955, to its termination in September,
H18  51 1955, was *+4,072, and the whole question at issue is whether or not
H18  52 these payments were *"distributions**" by the Company within the
H18  53 meaning of Section 36 of the Finance Act, 1947. ^If they were
H18  54 distributions, then, on the assumption which hitherto has been made
H18  55 that they would not be deductible for the purpose of ascertaining the
H18  56 gross relevant distribution for the purpose of Section 35, the amount
H18  57 of Profits Tax payable by the Company for the accounting periods in
H18  58 question would be larger than it would be if the payments were not
H18  59 distributions.
H18  60    |^Section 36(1) is in these terms:
H18  61 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H18  62    |^*"Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding subsection,
H18  63 wherever*- (a) any amount is distributed directly or indirectly by way
H18  64 of dividend or cash bonus to any person; or (b) assets are distributed
H18  65 in kind to any person; or (c) where the trade or business is carried
H18  66 on by a body corporate the directors whereof have a controlling
H18  67 interest therein,**"
H18  68 **[END INDENTATION**]
H18  69    |*- which is the case here*-
H18  70 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H18  71    |*"an amount is applied, whether by way of remuneration, loans or
H18  72 otherwise, for the benefit of any person, there shall be deemed for
H18  73 the purposes of the last preceding section to be a distribution to
H18  74 that person of that amount or, as the case may be, of an amount equal
H18  75 to the value of those assets:**"
H18  76 **[END INDENTATION**]
H18  77    |*- then there is a proviso*-
H18  78 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H18  79    |*"Provided that no sum applied in repaying a loan or in reducing
H18  80 the share capital of the person carrying on the trade or business
H18  81 shall be treated as a distribution.**"
H18  82 **[END INDENTATION**]
H18  83    |^That proviso certainly seems to suggest that, if it were not
H18  84 there, a sum applied by the Company in repaying a loan would be a
H18  85 distribution. ^I do not think I need read Sub-section (2), but
H18  86 Sub-section (3) contains special provisions in regard to loans, to
H18  87 this effect:
H18  88 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H18  89    |^*"Where*- (a) a loan has been treated as part of the gross
H18  90 relevant distributions to proprietors for a chargeable accounting
H18  91 period; and (b) as a result, the amount of tax payable for that period
H18  92 has been increased,**"
H18  93 **[END INDENTATION**]
H18  94    |then, if the loan is repaid, the gross relevant distributions to
H18  95 the proprietors are to be treated as reduced by the amount
H18  96 corresponding to the increase caused by treating the loan as a
H18  97 distribution.
H18  98    |^The question which I have to decide is, of course, whether these
H18  99 payments were amounts applied by the Company for the benefit of \0Mr.
H18 100 Hawke *"by way of remuneration, loans or otherwise**". ^They were
H18 101 certainly not *"remuneration**" or *"loans**"; but do they come under
H18 102 the head of *"or otherwise**"? ^They were, as I have said, payments
H18 103 made under a commercial agreement for full consideration given by
H18 104 \0Mr. Hawke to the Company in the form of a grant to the Company of a
H18 105 licence to exploit his patent. ^If the words had been simply *"an
H18 106 amount is applied for the benefit of any person**", I should have
H18 107 thought it very doubtful whether this Sub-section would have covered
H18 108 payments, whether of capital or income, under an ordinary commercial
H18 109 agreement. ^According to the ordinary use of the English language, a
H18 110 payment for which you have given full consideration is not an amount
H18 111 applied for your benefit by the payer. ^But, of course, the words are
H18 112 not simply *"an amount is applied for the benefit of any person**";
H18 113 there are the additional words *"whether by way of remuneration, loans
H18 114 or otherwise**". ^In *1Commissioners of Inland Revenue *0\0v.
H18 115 *1Chappie, \0Ltd., *034 {0T.C.} 509, the Court of Appeal had to
H18 116 consider the case of loans made by a company to one of its members, an
H18 117 associated company, on what were found to be ordinary commercial
H18 118 terms, and the Court, affirming the decision of Danckwerts, \0J., held
H18 119 that such a loan was a distribution within the meaning of this
H18 120 Section.
H18 121    |^It has been argued by \0Mr. Brennan in this case that the
H18 122 decision turned simply on the special provisions made in regard to
H18 123 loans. ^The Section, of course, refers to loans expressly, and there
H18 124 is in Sub-section (3) a provision for adjusting the matter if and when
H18 125 the loan is repaid. ^In the case of loans, therefore, it is
H18 126 particularly difficult to avoid the conclusion that they count as
H18 127 distributions even if they are made on commercial terms; but I do not
H18 128 regard the decision in the *1Chappie *0case as throwing no light on
H18 129 the construction of the rest of this Sub-section. ^The members of the
H18 130 Court of Appeal, as I read their judgments, definitely rejected the
H18 131 idea that there had to be an element of bounty in a payment in order
H18 132 to bring it into the scope of the Section. ^It is true that they were
H18 133 dealing with loans, but they were construing the Section as a whole.
H18 134 ^The Section expressly refers to remuneration as well as loans.
H18 135 ^Remuneration does not normally contain any element of bounty, yet the
H18 136 Sub-section says that all payments by way of remuneration are to be
H18 137 treated as distributions. ^It is, therefore, very difficult to say
H18 138 that what falls under the heading *"or otherwise**" as opposed to what
H18 139 falls under the heading *"remuneration**" or *"loans**" must contain
H18 140 an element of bounty. ^Then it is said: ^*"If you read the Sub-section
H18 141 as widely as that, any payment made by a company, whether it be an
H18 142 income or a capital payment, and whether there is consideration for it
H18 143 or not, will be a distribution. ^If the company buys a motor-car from
H18 144 a member for a proper price, even that will be a distribution.**"
H18 145 ^Well, it appears to me that the members of the Court of Appeal in the
H18 146 *1Chappie *0case were aware that that might be the result of their
H18 147 decision. ^That is shown by what was said by \0Mr. Tucker and Jenkins,
H18 148 {0L.J.}, at the end of the case (at page 527 of this report). ^But,
H18 149 of course, it is true to say that the decision itself related only to
H18 150 loans.
H18 151    |^The Section was considered again a little later by Harman, \0J.,
H18 152 in *1Commissioners of Inland Revenue *0\0v. *1Lactagol, \0Ltd., *035
H18 153 {0T.C.} 230. ^There the company had made a lump-sum payment to a
H18 154 director-member, \0Mr. Adams, in consideration of a covenant that
H18 155 after his term of service with the company ceased he would not compete
H18 156 with the company. ^So for a lump-sum payment the company got the
H18 157 benefit of a capital asset in the form of \0Mr. Adams's covenant.
H18 158 ^Harman, \0J., was impressed, as anybody must be, with the absurdity
H18 159 of treating such a payment*- a capital payment for a capital asset
H18 160 under a genuine commercial transaction*- as being an amount applied
H18 161 for the benefit of the payee. ^He was not prepared to accept the view
H18 162 that in the *1Chappie *0case the Court of Appeal had decided that all
H18 163 payments were distributions. ^He thought that a line must be drawn
H18 164 somewhere, and influenced, I think, by the fact that this Act taxes
H18 165 profits, he drew the line at payments of capital for capital assets.
H18 166 ^Whether it is really logical to draw any line or to draw it there it
H18 167 is not for me to say. ^If I were faced with a similar case to that
H18 168 which was before Harman, \0J., I should, of course, follow his
H18 169 decision. ^But the case before me is not one of a payment of capital
H18 170 for a capital asset, but of recurring payments of income. ^I do not
H18 171 therefore think that decision of Harman, \0J., covers this case, and I
H18 172 feel myself at liberty to reach the conclusion at which, but for his
H18 173 decision, I would have arrived without hesitation in view of the
H18 174 decision of the Court of Appeal in the *1Chappie *0case. ^I should
H18 175 have said that the Commissioners decided this case in favour of the
H18 176 taxpayer on the ground that the *1Chappie *0case dealt only with
H18 177 loans, and that this case was covered by the *1Lactagol *0case.
H18 178    |^For the reasons I have tried to give, I think that their decision
H18 179 was wrong, and therefore I shall allow the appeal.
H18 180    |^*4Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas.*0*- ^Your Lordship will, then, allow
H18 181 the appeal with costs?
H18 182    |^*4Cross, \0J.*0*- ^Yes.
H18 183    |^*4\0Mr. {0P. J.} Brennan.*0*- ^Would your Lordship hear me on
H18 184 that point about costs?
H18 185    |^*4Cross, \0J.*0*- ^Yes.
H18 186    |^*4\0Mr. Brennan.*0*- ^My Lord, the *1Lactagol *0case was decided
H18 187 some years ago, and this matter has been left in a state of grave
H18 188 uncertainty; and my clients went before the Commissioners on the basis
H18 189 of the *1Lactagol *0case. ^They succeeded before the Commissioners,
H18 190 and I submit that it might be a proper case where your Lordship might
H18 191 make an Order whereby each side would bear its own costs.
H18 192    |^*4Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas.*0*- ^My Lord, it is the same sort of
H18 193 difficulty that arises in any case where there has been a decision
H18 194 upon which one side relies.
H18 195    |^*4Cross, \0J.*0*- ^I think I must allow the Crown to have their
H18 196 costs in this case. ^I quite understand that the Commissioners were in
H18 197 a difficulty in view of the two authorities, but I have taken a
H18 198 different view of Harman, \0J.'s decision to that taken by them, and I
H18 199 think the ordinary result must follow.
H18 200    |^*4Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas.*0*- ^And would your Lordship make a
H18 201 declaration?
H18 202    |^*4Cross, \0J.*0*- ^Yes. ^There is no question of figures, is
H18 203 there?

H19  27 in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.
H19  28    |^The Parties were heard in Cardiff on the 9th May, 1961.
H19  29    |^2. By an Agreement reached between the Clerical and
H19  30 Administrative Workers' Union (hereinafter referred to as *"the
H19  31 Union**"), and the Engineering Employers' Federation on the 6th
H19  32 January, 1961, increases which the Federation were prepared to
H19  33 recommend to be paid by member firms to their clerical workers with
H19  34 salaries up to and including *+775 {6per annum} in the case of males
H19  35 and *+580 in the case of females, as from the 9th January, 1961, were
H19  36 determined. ^The said increases are set out in the Appendix hereto.
H19  37 ^The Agreement also contained the following clause:*-
H19  38 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H19  39    |^*"The recommendation is made subject to the understanding that
H19  40 firms may take into account any general increase already given to
H19  41 clerical workers, whether as a result of the National Wages Agreement
H19  42 reached with the Manual Workers' Union on 21st December, 1960, or in
H19  43 anticipation of the settlement of this claim.**"
H19  44 **[END INDENTATION**]
H19  45    |^The dispute concerns 83 clerical workers employed by the
H19  46 Aluminium Wire and Cable Company Limited (hereinafter referred as
H19  47 *"the Company**") and the Union claim that the above increases should
H19  48 be applied to them with effect from the 9th January, 1961. ^The matter
H19  49 was first raised on the 20th January, 1961, when the Union having
H19  50 received a report that the Company had not implemented the terms of
H19  51 the Agreement, wrote to them. ^The Union subsequently sought the
H19  52 assistance of the Industrial Relations Officer (Wales), under whose
H19  53 Chairmanship a meeting took place on the 2nd March, 1961. ^The Company
H19  54 then stated that they were exempt from the terms of the Agreement by
H19  55 reason of a notice issued to each of their clerical workers in their
H19  56 pay packet on the 5th December, 1960, when certain increases in pay
H19  57 became effective. ^The matter was thereupon referred to the Court for
H19  58 decision.
H19  59    |^3. On behalf of the Union it was stated that they had when
H19  60 necessary met the Company regarding matters affecting wages and
H19  61 conditions of clerical workers, and whilst the Company were not in
H19  62 membership of the Engineering Employers' Federation, there was an
H19  63 understanding that they should follow the Engineering Industry. ^In
H19  64 that understanding the Union had negotiated with them arrangements for
H19  65 a shorter working week, the salary limits under which clerical workers
H19  66 received payment for overtime and the rota under which Saturday
H19  67 mornings were worked.
H19  68    |^It was submitted that the terms under which a company could claim
H19  69 exemption from implementing the Agreement of the 6th January, 1961,
H19  70 were clearly understood between the Engineering Employers' Federation
H19  71 and the Union; that the term *"general increase**" was understood
H19  72 between them and that increases in salaries consequent on a review of
H19  73 salaries undertaken by the Company which took effect from the 3rd
H19  74 October, 1960, did not constitute a *"general increase**". ^The fact
H19  75 that a number of the clerical workers concerned had not received any
H19  76 increase at all and the lack of pattern in the increases awarded by
H19  77 the Company were indicative of a merit assessment on the Company's
H19  78 valuation of each employee.
H19  79    |^It was contended that the increases paid on the 5th December,
H19  80 1960 could not have been paid as a result of the manual workers'
H19  81 settlement, which was agreed more than a fortnight after the increases
H19  82 had been paid, or that the review, which the Company stated had taken
H19  83 several months to complete, could have been in anticipation of the
H19  84 settlement of a class for clerical workers which the Union had not yet
H19  85 presented to the Company. ^The Court's attention was drawn to the fact
H19  86 that on the 3rd October, 1960 (the retrospective date to which the
H19  87 Company's increase became effective) the Union had not presented their
H19  88 case to the Engineering Employers' Federation. ^Furthermore, the
H19  89 National Wages Agreement with the Manual Workers' Union was not
H19  90 reached until the 21st December, 1960.
H19  91    |^It was submitted that the clerical workers employed by the
H19  92 Company should receive the increases set out in the Appendix. ^The
H19  93 Union maintained that previous differences referred to the Industrial
H19  94 Disputes Tribunal under the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, which
H19  95 resulted in Awards \0Nos. 248, 813 and 840 in favour of the Union,
H19  96 endorsed that view.
H19  97    |^4. On behalf of the Company it was stated that whilst they were
H19  98 not members of the Engineering and Allied Employers' South Wales
H19  99 Association, it had been their practice to have regard to
H19 100 recommendations of the Engineering Employers' Federation when
H19 101 reviewing salaries towards the end of each year. ^Thus the Company had
H19 102 given increases to their clerical workers with effect from the 1st
H19 103 January, 1959, comparable with increases recommended by the Federation
H19 104 in October, 1958. ^They had also given increases with effect from the
H19 105 1st January, 1960, and a reduction of working hours as from the 2nd
H19 106 May, 1960, even though the federation had not recommended any salary
H19 107 increases at that time.
H19 108    |^During the latter half of 1960, it was stated, the Company
H19 109 decided on a major review of salaries of their staff in the course of
H19 110 which they became aware of a claim submitted by the Union to the
H19 111 Federation in respect of their clerical workers. ^Accordingly, when
H19 112 such employees were advised in December, 1960, of increases granted
H19 113 (which were made retrospective to the beginning of October, 1960), the
H19 114 Company entered a caveat to cover possible increases which might
H19 115 subsequently be recommended by the Federation, notice of which was
H19 116 contained in the letter addressed to each employee at the time. ^Early
H19 117 in January, 1961, when the Company received details of the increases
H19 118 recommended by the Federation, comparison with the increases already
H19 119 granted to their clerical workers revealed some differences and any
H19 120 deficiencies were made good as from the 2nd January, 1961, although the
H19 121 Federation's recommendations did not take effect until a week later.
H19 122    |^The Company had not specifically agreed and had not given any
H19 123 undertaking to the Union to follow the Engineering Industry.
H19 124    |^It was submitted that increases in salaries granted to all staff
H19 125 when salaries were reviewed were a *"general increase**". ^The review
H19 126 of salaries was described as a major review as the level of salaries
H19 127 being paid to senior staff having university degrees or other special
H19 128 qualifications was being specially examined, and it was spread over a
H19 129 long period and completed only after it became known that the Union
H19 130 were negotiating with the Federation in respect of clerical workers.
H19 131 ^It was also submitted that all the clerical workers concerned had
H19 132 received increases no less than those recommended in the National
H19 133 Agreement of the 6th January, 1961, between the Engineering Employers'
H19 134 Federation and the Union.
H19 135    |^In the Company's views the Awards of the Industrial Disputes
H19 136 Tribunal referred to by the Union were made in different circumstances
H19 137 and could not be taken as precedents.
H19 138    |^In conclusion the Company submitted that they observed the spirit
H19 139 of all Agreements between the Engineering Employers' Federation and
H19 140 the Union, and in support of this gave details of the conditions of
H19 141 employment of their staff.
H19 142    |^5. The Court, having given careful consideration to the evidence
H19 143 and submissions of the Parties, Award that, with effect from the 20th
H19 144 January, 1961, the Company shall apply to the clerical workers
H19 145 concerned the wage increases agreed between the Engineering Employers'
H19 146 Federation and the Union on the 6th January, 1961.

H19 150 **[NEW TEXT**]
H19 151 ^*0I have submitted precedents over two centuries. ^We believe those
H19 152 precedents to be valid. ^May we ask whether you would be good enough
H19 153 further to consider your Ruling and indicate on what occasions and
H19 154 under what circumstances it shall apply and whether you will consider
H19 155 the precedents and previous Rulings before a new ruling is
H19 156 established?
H19 157    |^*4\0Mr. Speaker: ^*0I have said that I will look at what the
H19 158 right \0hon. Gentleman put to me and, of course, I will. ^But I do not
H19 159 propose to say anything else about it, unless I find that my Ruling
H19 160 was wrong.
H19 161    |^*4\0Mr. Gordon Walker: ^*0In the interests of ourselves and our
H19 162 successors, who might be misled, may I suggest that you later give us
H19 163 the reasons which led you to think that these proceedings were not
H19 164 invalidated? ^Our successors and ourselves might otherwise be misled
H19 165 about what does or does not constitute a House in other circumstances.
H19 166 ^If your Ruling were given just like that, and without reasons, it
H19 167 might be held to go much further than you intend. ^I fully understand
H19 168 and appreciate your desire not to give reasons in general, but on this
H19 169 occasion you might consider it worth your while to do so.
H19 170    |^*4\0Mr. Speaker: ^*0If it be thought that there might be any
H19 171 dubiety*- that is the word*- about the matter, I will say that my
H19 172 Ruling applies to nothing at all except to circumstances where the
H19 173 Mace is not in the right place and when there is a suspension under
H19 174 Standing Order \0No. 24.
H19 175    |^*4Sir \0H. Butcher: ^*0You have been good enough, \0Mr. Speaker,
H19 176 to say that on behalf of the House you will conduct a certain amount
H19 177 of research into our precedents. ^If, as a by-product of such
H19 178 research, it is found that in recent years the habit of discussing
H19 179 certain Rulings with the Chair has increased, may I ask you not to
H19 180 hesitate to say so, so that we may conform to the more orderly methods
H19 181 of our predecessors?
H19 182    |^*4\0Mr. Speaker: ^*0I am obliged to the \0hon. Member. ^Since I
H19 183 came into the service of the House I have been trying gradually to get
H19 184 round to that position and I have had much help from the House.
H19 185    |^*4\0Mr. Denis Howell: ^*0On a point of order. ^Would you also
H19 186 take into account, \0Mr. Speaker, the new procedure of the Patronage
H19 187 Secretary intervening in our affairs*-
H19 188    |^*4\0Mr. Speaker: ^*0In no circumstances can the \0hon. Member
H19 189 have a right to address me about that now.
H19 190    |^*4\0Mr. Donnelly: ^*0On a point of order. ^May I venture to
H19 191 suggest that when the Minister of Works investigates the microphones,
H19 192 he considers not only new microphones but the possibility of reverting
H19 193 to the pre-war practice of not having microphones, which might help
H19 194 the proceedings of the House generally?
H19 195    |^*4\0Mr. Speaker: ^*0I am obliged to the \0hon. Member. ^I am sure
H19 196 that all the technical aspects will be considered, including, I hope,
H19 197 some examination of the microphones which we had before and which
H19 198 seemed to be satisfactory.
H19 199 *<*6HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (RETURN FROM WEST AFRICA)*>
H19 200    |^*4The Prime Minister (\0Mr. Harold Macmillan): ^*0I beg to move,
H19 201    |That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, assuring Her
H19 202 Majesty of the loyal and affectionate welcome of this House to Her
H19 203 Majesty, on the occasion of Her return from Her tour of West Africa
H19 204 with His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh.
H19 205    |^I am sure that this Motion will commend itself to the House. ^A
H19 206 month ago, on the eve of Her Majesty's departure for West Africa, the
H19 207 House joined me in sending her our warmest good wishes for the success
H19 208 of her tour and a safe return.
H19 209    |^Now the Queen is safely back with us, I venture to say that of
H19 210 the many journeys which she and His Royal Highness have so tirelessly
H19 211 undertaken, none has been crowned with greater success than this.
H19 212 *# 2016
H20   1 **[284 TEXT H20**]
H20   2    |^*0This means that a man now reaching 65 years of age can earn a
H20   3 flat-rate pension of *+3 18\0s. 6\0d. a week*- or up to *+6 4\0s. a
H20   4 week if he is married*- if he works until he is 70 and an insured
H20   5 woman can earn a similar pension if she works until she is 65.
H20   6    |^The above are the increases for contributions paid after 2nd
H20   7 August, 1959.
H20   8    |^For every 25 contributions paid for weeks up to 2nd August 1959,
H20   9 increases are at the rate of 1\0s. 6\0d. (1\0s. for the wife). ^On
H20  10 widowhood any 1\0s. increases earned for the wife after 16th July,
H20  11 1951, are paid at the 1\0s. 6\0d. rate.
H20  12    |^On top of these increases of flat-rate pension you may also get
H20  13 extra graduated pension if you do not retire at age 65 (60 for a
H20  14 woman). ^This can arise in two ways.
H20  15    |^Firstly, if you are 65 (60 for a woman) you work for an employer
H20  16 and are paid more than *+9 in any week you will (unless you are
H20  17 contracted out) pay graduated contributions. ^These will count in the
H20  18 ordinary way for graduated pension.
H20  19    |^Secondly, the graduated part of the pension which you would have
H20  20 drawn had you retired at age 65 (60 for a woman) will be treated as if
H20  21 it were a graduated contribution paid by you and your employer. ^This
H20  22 means that half of it will count as an extra contribution by you
H20  23 towards further units of graduated pension.
H20  24    |^Examples showing how the increases work for people now
H20  25 approaching pension age with various earnings are shown on page 31.
H20  26 *<*447 The earnings rule*>
H20  27    |^*0Because the pension is for people who have retired, it is
H20  28 reduced if the pensioner earns more than a certain amount while he is
H20  29 under 70 (65 for a woman). ^The rule is that the pension is reduced by
H20  30 6\0d. for every complete shilling of net earnings between *+3 10\0s.
H20  31 and *+4 10\0s. a week, and by 1\0s. for every complete shilling over
H20  32 *+4 10\0s. ^A wife's pension is similarly reduced if she earns over
H20  33 *+3 10\0s. a week.
H20  34    |^A pensioner under 70 (65 for a woman) who earns *+3 11\0s. or
H20  35 more in a week must declare the amount earned to the local Pensions
H20  36 and National Insurance Office without delay.
H20  37 *<*448 How and when to claim Retirement Pension*>
H20  38    |^*0Shortly before you reach pension age, whether or not you intend
H20  39 to retire, you should apply for your right to a pension to be decided.
H20  40 ^The local Pensions and National Insurance Office usually sends an
H20  41 application form to each insured person. ^But if you have not got one
H20  42 three months before you reach age 65 (60 for a woman) you should
H20  43 enquire at your local office.
H20  44    |^Before you can be awarded a pension you must give notice in
H20  45 writing of the date of your retirement. ^You can do this up to 4
H20  46 months in advance. ^If a man and wife both wish to claim a pension,
H20  47 each must give notice even if the wife is doing no work besides her
H20  48 own domestic duties. ^If your claim, or your notice of retirement, is
H20  49 late, you may lose benefit.
H20  50 *<*449 Cancelling retirement*>
H20  51    |^*0If you have once retired and decide to return to work you can,
H20  52 instead of having your pension reduced for earnings, cancel your
H20  53 retirement and qualify for a bigger pension, as described in paragraph
H20  54 46, when you finally retire or reach the age of 70 (65 for a woman).
H20  55 ^To do this you and your wife will both have to give up your pension
H20  56 for the time being and you will have to pay full national insurance
H20  57 contributions while you are working.
H20  58 *<*2WIDOW'S BENEFITS*>
H20  59    |^*0For the first 13 weeks of widowhood there is a benefit called
H20  60 widow's allowance. ^After that, payment of widow's benefit depends on
H20  61 individual circumstances such as family responsibilities and age.
H20  62 *<*450 Widow's Allowance*>
H20  63    |^*0The standard rate of the allowance is 80\0s. a week for the
H20  64 first 13 weeks of widowhood, with increases of 25\0s. a week for the
H20  65 eldest dependent child and 17\0s. a week for each other dependent
H20  66 child.
H20  67    |^The allowance can be paid to a woman widowed over 60 years of age
H20  68 only if her husband was not receiving a retirement pension. ^The
H20  69 general position of widows over 60 is explained in paragraph 57.
H20  70 *<*451 Widowed Mother's Allowance*>
H20  71    |^*0A widow left with a dependent child (see paragraph 22) will
H20  72 usually get a widowed mother's allowance when she has finished drawing
H20  73 her widow's allowance. ^The standard weekly rate of widowed mother's
H20  74 allowance is 82\0s. 6\0d. for the widow and her eldest child, with
H20  75 increases of 17\0s. a week for each other dependent child. ^The
H20  76 allowance will last as long as the widow has a dependent child in her
H20  77 family. ^The allowance is provided to help the widowed mother who,
H20  78 because of her children, cannot readily support herself by working.
H20  79 ^If she does work her allowance is, therefore, reduced by 6\0d. for
H20  80 every complete shilling of net earnings between *+5 and *+6 a week and
H20  81 by 1\0s. for every complete shilling over *+6, but it cannot be
H20  82 reduced by more than the widow's personal part of the allowance*-
H20  83 usually 57\0s. 6\0d. a week*- however much she earns. ^A widowed
H20  84 mother earning *+5 1\0s. or more in any week must declare her earnings
H20  85 to the local Pensions and National Insurance Office without delay.
H20  86 *<*452 Widowed Mother's Personal Allowance*>
H20  87    |^*0A widow whose son or daughter has left school and does not
H20  88 qualify as a dependent child (see paragraph 22) but is still under the
H20  89 age of 18 and living with her, can get a widowed mother's personal
H20  90 allowance, usually 57\0s. 6\0d. a week, when her widow's allowance or
H20  91 widowed mother's allowance ends. ^This allowance is subject to the
H20  92 same earnings rule as the full widowed mother's allowance.
H20  93 *<*453 Widow's Pension*>
H20  94    |^*0The standard weekly rate of widow's pension is 57\0s. 6\0d. and
H20  95 a widow may get it in either of the following ways:
H20  96 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H20  97    |(a) when widow's allowance ends, if she was over 50 years of age
H20  98 when her husband died and had been married for 3 years or more;
H20  99    |(b) when widowed mother's allowance ends, if she is then over 50
H20 100 years of age (40 if her husband died before 4th February, 1957) and 3
H20 101 years have passed since the date of her marriage.
H20 102 **[END INDENTATION**]
H20 103    |^The pension is provided to help the older widow who cannot
H20 104 readily support herself by taking up full-time employment. ^If she is
H20 105 able to work, her widow's pension is, therefore, reduced by 6\0d. for
H20 106 every complete shilling of net earnings between *+3 10\0s. and *+4
H20 107 10\0s. a week and by 1\0s. for every complete shilling over *+4 10\0s.
H20 108 ^A widow earning *+3 11\0s. or more in any week is required to notify
H20 109 the local Pensions and National Insurance Office without delay.
H20 110    |^There are special rules which enable a widow who does not qualify
H20 111 for the widow's pension or qualifies only for the 10\0s. pension (see
H20 112 paragraph 55) to get unemployment or sickness benefit if she is unable
H20 113 to find work or is unable to work because of illness when the widow's
H20 114 allowance or widowed mother's allowance ends.
H20 115 *<*454 What are the contribution conditions?*>
H20 116    |^*0Only the husband's contributions count for widow's benefit; the
H20 117 contribution conditions cannot be fulfilled on the widow's own
H20 118 insurance record.
H20 119    |^There are two contribution conditions:
H20 120 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H20 121    |^*4First*0*- the husband must normally have paid at least 156
H20 122 contributions of any Class since he last became insured.
H20 123    |^*4Second*0*- for benefit to be paid at the standard rate the
H20 124 husband must have paid or have been credited with a yearly average of
H20 125 50 contributions. ^If this average is below 50, but not less than 13,
H20 126 benefit is paid at a reduced rate.
H20 127 **[END INDENTATION**]
H20 128 *<*455 Widow's 10\0s. Pension*>
H20 129    |^*0Certain widows have had preserved for them rights equivalent to
H20 130 those which they might have expected under the Acts in force before
H20 131 July 1948*- the *"10\0s. pension**". ^The widows in question are those
H20 132 whose marriage was before 5th July, 1948, and whose husbands were
H20 133 insured under the old scheme immediately before that date.
H20 134 *<*457 How and when to claim Widow's Benefit*>
H20 135    |^*0A person registering a death can get a special death
H20 136 certificate from the Registrar of Deaths. ^On the back of the
H20 137 certificate the widow can let her local Pensions and National
H20 138 Insurance Office know that she wishes to claim benefit. ^A form on
H20 139 which to claim will then be sent to her. ^The form can also be
H20 140 obtained from any local Pensions and National Insurance Office.

H20 174 child in addition to Family Allowances.

H20 176 (see paragraph 54), except that the allowance is not reduced where the
H20 177 former husband's yearly average of paid or credited contributions is

H21   2 ^*0Thirty-six per \0cent. of our imports come from the Commonwealth;
H21   3 but I think I am correct in saying that over 20 per \0cent. of
H21   4 metropolitan France's imports come from territories having a special
H21   5 relationship with her. ^Be that as it may, the trade is of very great
H21   6 importance to the Commonwealth countries concerned. ^For example,
H21   7 among the dependent or newly independent countries, Mauritius sends 82
H21   8 per \0cent. of her exports to the United Kingdom; Sierra Leone 70 per
H21   9 \0cent.; and Nigeria 51 per \0cent. ^Of the older Commonwealth
H21  10 countries, New Zealand is also heavily dependent on the United Kingdom
H21  11 market, sending 56 per \0cent. of her exports to us. ^The proportions
H21  12 of their exports which Australia, India and Ceylon send to the United
H21  13 Kingdom are of the order of 30 per \0cent.
H21  14    |^32. On the assumption that there is general recognition of the
H21  15 need to devise satisfactory arrangements to protect vital interests of
H21  16 Commonwealth countries, and with this background in mind, I think it
H21  17 would be helpful to suggest in more detail how the problem might be
H21  18 split up into its different components, and how each of these might be
H21  19 treated.
H21  20    |^33. I would like to begin with the less developed members of the
H21  21 Commonwealth and those territories which are still dependent. ^May I
H21  22 start by trying to describe briefly the nature and needs of these
H21  23 countries and territories? ^Of the Dependent Territories some are
H21  24 moving towards independence and at least one, Tanganyika, will be an
H21  25 independent member of the Commonwealth by the time our negotiations
H21  26 are completed. ^For others we cannot foresee, at any rate for some
H21  27 time to come, a constitutional position more advanced than that of
H21  28 internal self-government. ^Of the less developed countries which are
H21  29 already independent members of the Commonwealth, three*- Ghana,
H21  30 Nigeria and Sierra Leone*- are in Africa; four*- India, Pakistan,
H21  31 Ceylon and Malaya*- are in Asia; and one, Cyprus, is in Europe. ^Apart
H21  32 from Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands, all these
H21  33 countries and territories have tropical or sub-tropical climates.
H21  34 ^They nearly all produce tropical products and raw materials many of
H21  35 which are also produced by the countries and territories at present
H21  36 associated with the Community under Part *=4 of the Treaty of Rome.
H21  37 ^Many of them are seeking to establish secondary industries in order
H21  38 to diversify their economies and reduce their very great dependence
H21  39 upon imports. ^India, Pakistan and Hong Kong are also exporters of
H21  40 certain manufactured goods; and some others, such as Malta and the
H21  41 West Indies, hope to follow their example, though on a much smaller
H21  42 scale.
H21  43    |^34. All these countries and territories attach importance to the
H21  44 preferences and duty-free entry which they enjoy in the United Kingdom
H21  45 market. ^There are a few other special arrangements, which are vital
H21  46 to certain of them. ^For some territories it is also of importance*-
H21  47 in some cases of great importance*- to be able to compete in the
H21  48 markets of the rest of Europe on equal terms with other exporters of
H21  49 similar products. ^They would certainly not understand if, as a result
H21  50 of becoming a Member of the Community, the United Kingdom were obliged
H21  51 to discriminate against them in favour of other non-European
H21  52 countries. ^Another feature of many of these countries and territories
H21  53 is that their need to encourage industrial development and their
H21  54 unavoidable reliance on indirect taxation for revenue makes it
H21  55 necessary for them to put tariffs on imports of manufactured goods.
H21  56    |^35. In considering the problems which our entry into the Common
H21  57 Market would create for these countries and territories we have
H21  58 studied with great interest the arrangements laid down in Part *=4 of
H21  59 the Treaty of Rome and in the related Convention for the Association
H21  60 with the {0E.E.C.} of certain Overseas Countries and Territories
H21  61 with whom members of that Community previously had special relations.
H21  62 ^Some Commonwealth countries have expressed the opinion that the
H21  63 present arrangements for Association are not appropriate for
H21  64 independent states. ^But this view may not apply to the new
H21  65 arrangements when it is known what they will be. ^In any case we
H21  66 should like to see the less developed members of the Commonwealth, and
H21  67 our Dependent Territories, given the opportunity, if they so wish, to
H21  68 enter into Association with the Community on the same terms as those
H21  69 which will in future be available to the present Associated Overseas
H21  70 Countries and Territories. ^This is something we shall need to
H21  71 discuss, and we know that you are already at work on a review of the
H21  72 present arrangements for Association. ^Some Commonwealth countries may
H21  73 feel that some other arrangements might suit them better. ^We would
H21  74 not wish to prejudge any solutions they may decide to propose.
H21  75    |^36. Association may, therefore, be a solution for the problems of
H21  76 many Commonwealth countries and territories. ^But for others it may
H21  77 not be possible. ^One way of dealing with the problems of those who
H21  78 are not associated would be to arrange for them to maintain unimpaired
H21  79 their rights of access to the United Kingdom market, in the same way
H21  80 as was done for Morocco's trade with France, or for Surinam's trade
H21  81 with Benelux, under the relevant Protocol to the Rome Treaty. ^But we
H21  82 recognise that this solution would not be applicable in all cases.
H21  83 ^Another method of proceeding would be to consider the problems on a
H21  84 commodity-by-commodity basis. ^Perhaps it would be helpful if I were
H21  85 to say something, at this point, about the main groups of
H21  86 commodities*- tropical products, materials, manufactures and temperate
H21  87 foodstuffs.
H21  88    |^37. Difficulties will arise over *1tropical products *0if one or
H21  89 more of the less-developed countries or territories of the
H21  90 Commonwealth do not enter into an appropriate form of Association with
H21  91 the Community. ^There does not appear to be any complete solution of
H21  92 such difficulties. ^But we see two alternative lines of approach. ^The
H21  93 first, which would be appropriate when not only equality of
H21  94 opportunity but also some measure of protection is essential, would be
H21  95 to grant free entry into the United Kingdom market alone for the
H21  96 Commonwealth country or territory which is not associated, and then to
H21  97 fix the common tariff of the enlarged Community at a level which would
H21  98 safeguard the interests both of that country and of the countries and
H21  99 territories associated with the Community. ^The second line of
H21 100 approach would be to fix a zero, or a very low, level for the common
H21 101 tariff. ^For a few important commodities we believe that it would be
H21 102 possible to do this without significant damage to the interests of the
H21 103 countries and territories associated with the Community. ^For example,
H21 104 tea is a commodity of great importance to India and Ceylon, and so is
H21 105 cocoa to Ghana. ^A zero common tariff would go a considerable way to
H21 106 meet the trade problems of those countries if they were not solved by
H21 107 Association.
H21 108    |^38. *1Materials *0should not in general give rise to
H21 109 difficulties, as the common tariff on most of them is zero. ^There
H21 110 are, however, a few on which it is substantial. ^Five of them*-
H21 111 aluminium, wood pulp, newsprint, lead and zinc*- are of great
H21 112 importance to certain Commonwealth countries: on these five materials
H21 113 we would wish to seek a zero tariff.
H21 114    |^39. *1Manufactures *0are, with a very few exceptions, imported
H21 115 duty-free into the United Kingdom both from the developed countries in
H21 116 the Commonwealth*- Canada, Australia and New Zealand*- and from the
H21 117 less developed Asian countries. ^Exporting industries in all these
H21 118 countries have been assisted in their development by free entry and
H21 119 the preferential position they have enjoyed in the United Kingdom.
H21 120 ^They would be seriously affected, not only by loss of preferences in
H21 121 our market, but also if their position were transformed into one in
H21 122 which the whole of their export trade was affected by reverse
H21 123 preferences in favour of the major industrial countries in Europe.
H21 124 ^Nevertheless we recognise that indefinite and unlimited continuation
H21 125 of free entry over the whole of this field may not be regarded as
H21 126 compatible with the development of the common market and we are
H21 127 willing to discuss ways of reconciling these two conflicting
H21 128 considerations. ^I believe that the problem is of manageable
H21 129 proportions. ^The trade in question is important to the Commonwealth
H21 130 countries concerned but it is not large in total in comparison with
H21 131 European trade.
H21 132    |^40. The problem arises in a special form for manufactures from
H21 133 the less-developed countries, the so-called low cost manufactures. ^It
H21 134 occurs most acutely in relation to Asian Commonwealth countries and
H21 135 the Colony of Hong Kong. ^There is increasing international
H21 136 recognition that developed countries have a duty to facilitate
H21 137 international trade in this field as much as they can. ^But what the
H21 138 nature of the solution should be in the context of our joining the
H21 139 {0E.E.C.}, must depend on how far it can be dealt with under
H21 140 arrangements for a Part *=4 Association. ^You will probably agree that
H21 141 it would not be in the general interest that the United Kingdom should
H21 142 erect fresh tariff barriers to cut back such trade.
H21 143    |^41. A major concern of the more fully developed members of the
H21 144 Commonwealth is their trade with us in *1temperate foodstuffs.
H21 145 ^*0Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, in particular, have vital
H21 146 interests in this field for which special arrangements must be made.
H21 147    |^42. I should like to give you some figures to demonstrate how
H21 148 essential to these countries exports of temperate foodstuffs are. ^New
H21 149 Zealand's total exports in 1959 were valued at *+290 million. ^Of
H21 150 these *+170 million worth, or about 60 per \0cent., were temperate
H21 151 foodstuffs. ^*+130 million worth, out of the total *+170 million, came
H21 152 to the United Kingdom. ^The bulk of these exports to us consisted of
H21 153 mutton, lamb, butter and cheese. ^Over 90 per \0cent. of total exports
H21 154 of these commodities came to the United Kingdom. ^If in the future New
H21 155 Zealand cannot, by one means or another, be assured of comparable
H21 156 outlets for them, her whole economy will be shattered. ^New Zealand's
H21 157 problem is particularly acute because of her dependence on a
H21 158 relatively limited range of exports. ^But other Commonwealth commodity
H21 159 problems are the same in kind if not in degree. ^For example
H21 160 Australia, even though she exports a much more varied range of
H21 161 products, relies on temperate foodstuffs for 35 per \0cent. of her
H21 162 exports. ^The temperate foodstuffs she sends abroad are valued at
H21 163 *+250 million: of these *+100 million worth come to the United
H21 164 Kingdom. ^I hope that these figures will help to illustrate the
H21 165 problem. ^But figures alone cannot tell the whole story. ^We must bear
H21 166 in mind the effect of what we do both on particular localities and on
H21 167 individual producers in Commonwealth countries.
H21 168    |^43. To many Commonwealth countries the United Kingdom has both
H21 169 moral and contractual obligations, on the basis of which they have
H21 170 planned the development of their economies. ^I will mention only the
H21 171 Commonwealth Sugar Agreement with which you are all familiar since it
H21 172 is recognised in the International Sugar Agreement. ^It provides an
H21 173 assured basis for sugar production which is particularly important in
H21 174 the case of our Dependent Territories.
H21 175    |^44. The problem therefore is to reconcile our obligations to the
H21 176 Commonwealth with the common agricultural policy as it evolves. ^We
H21 177 believe that solutions can be found which will prove satisfactory.
H21 178 ^The Commission's proposals emphasise that trade policy in
H21 179 agricultural products should take into account, not only internal
H21 180 agricultural considerations, but also the need to maintain trade with
H21 181 third countries. ^This is a liberal approach and one with which we
H21 182 fully agree.
H21 183    |^45. I therefore hope that we can reach agreement in principle
H21 184 that full regard should be paid to the interests of the Commonwealth
H21 185 producers concerned, and that they should be given in the future the
H21 186 opportunity of outlets for their produce comparable to those they now
H21 187 enjoy.
H21 188    |^46. The precise form of the special arrangements needed to
H21 189 protect vital interests of Commonwealth countries in this field will
H21 190 need careful consideration. ^To a large extent it must depend on the
H21 191 way in which the common agricultural policy is developed. ^We want to
H21 192 work jointly with you in examining these problems and their relation
H21 193 to the common agricultural policy.

H22   2 *<*2CHAPTER 3*>
H22   3 *<*4The Home in its Setting*>
H22   4    |^*0159 As a consequence of the social and economic changes
H22   5 referred to in the opening chapter problems are making themselves felt
H22   6 in relating homes to their setting because practice has not caught up
H22   7 with the changes that have taken place. ^Car ownership and traffic
H22   8 dangers have made the old pattern of housing estates out of date. ^The
H22   9 streets may have been a safe place for children when the baker and the
H22  10 milkman came by horse and cart and everyone walked to work. ^With one
H22  11 family in three owning a car now, and with delivery and public
H22  12 transport and service vehicles often all using the residential street,
H22  13 new arrangements are required. ^Similarly, the garden, once highly
H22  14 important as a means of growing vegetables and fruit to supplement the
H22  15 diet of the large families of people who, by today's standards, were
H22  16 poorly paid and insecure, no longer serves that purpose. ^Again the
H22  17 pressure on land and the need to rebuild in city centres is compelling
H22  18 the building of a larger proportion of flats, which increases the need
H22  19 to provide somewhere for children to play.
H22  20    |^160 We have been to a number of estates where new forms of layout
H22  21 attempt to meet present day needs, and we wish there were more of
H22  22 them. ^In the years to come it is essential that there should be, for
H22  23 housing can become obsolete in its layout just as surely as in its
H22  24 internal design and facilities; and most of the present work is
H22  25 obsolete from this point of view when it is built. ^Layout is not
H22  26 within our terms of reference, but we have been obliged to formulate
H22  27 views upon it in our consideration of the provision which should be
H22  28 made for cars, and the play space which should be provided in relation
H22  29 to blocks of flats.
H22  30    |^161 In addition to these two subjects, on which we were given to
H22  31 understand that advice on standards would be welcome, and on the
H22  32 access requirements of terrace houses, which markedly influence their
H22  33 internal arrangement, we propose to comment on two others*- gardens
H22  34 and the general appearance of domestic building.
H22  35 *<*4*=1 External Appearance*>
H22  36    |^*0162 After inspecting so many developments in all parts of the
H22  37 country, we feel bound to record our concern that there should be such
H22  38 a vast gap between the best housing schemes in the country and many of
H22  39 the others. ^Control of development by town planning cannot by itself
H22  40 produce good layout and appearance*- the onus to achieve this lies
H22  41 with the developer himself, whether he is a private individual or a
H22  42 local authority. ^It cannot be achieved without using qualified
H22  43 professional people, architects and landscape architects, to design
H22  44 not only the individual house and house group but, every bit as
H22  45 important, the layout as a whole, and the landscaping. ^With the
H22  46 numerous examples in the local authority field and the best examples
H22  47 in the private sector there is no longer any reason why our town and
H22  48 countryside should continue to be spoilt by unimaginative buildings.
H22  49 ^Good layout and landscaping, together with the use of good and well
H22  50 chosen external materials and colours throughout an estate, go
H22  51 nine-tenths of the way towards creating beauty instead of ugliness,
H22  52 and it is in these broad and not necessarily costly ways, rather than
H22  53 in the laboured detailing of the individual dwelling, that housing
H22  54 development can be made pleasing and attractive to the eye.
H22  55    |^163 This is applicable to local authorities and private
H22  56 enterprise alike, but it may be that those private developers who
H22  57 remain wedded to old plans grown dusty with the years, who are content
H22  58 with amateur layout, and who provide no landscaping but the good
H22  59 subsoil of the site, often do so because they fear conservatism on the
H22  60 part of the buyer and the building society. ^Whether or not some
H22  61 building societies are conservative, buyers are much less so; and it
H22  62 is a fact worth recording that many builders have been surprised to
H22  63 find that houses catering for the present way of life and conformable
H22  64 with the modern eye for good design displace from their order books
H22  65 older and more conventional plans which they had previously been
H22  66 offering. ^We therefore urge those developers who do not already do so
H22  67 to turn increasingly to qualified people for the difficult and
H22  68 indispensable work of designing the buildings, the layout and the
H22  69 landscaping. ^For design now sells, and, if other considerations do
H22  70 not appeal, that alone should provide the incentive.
H22  71    |^164 It is essential that the landscaping should be designed for
H22  72 ease of maintenance as well as that funds should be provided for the
H22  73 maintenance both of the dwellings themselves and the spaces between
H22  74 them, including the landscaping. ^By ensuring that newly created
H22  75 property and its environment is properly looked after, its fresh
H22  76 appearance actually improves with the years as the lawns, trees and
H22  77 shrubs grow to maturity.
H22  78    |^165 With notable exceptions, most private development displays no
H22  79 co-ordination of painting and planting, and lags far behind that of
H22  80 many local authorities, who as landlords can maintain the whole of the
H22  81 estate. ^It must be admitted that many other European countries reach
H22  82 a far higher standard in their private estate layout than do we, very
H22  83 largely through the use of housing associations, which take full
H22  84 responsibility for both the initial landscaping and its maintenance.
H22  85 ^There are already in this country established ways of keeping owner
H22  86 occupied property in good and tasteful repair and the landscaping in
H22  87 good condition, by the use of restrictive covenants governing
H22  88 repainting and the maintenance of the landscaping. ^Non-profit-making
H22  89 companies, run by the occupiers, can see that the work is carried out,
H22  90 and these are proving successful.
H22  91 *<*1Television aerials*>
H22  92    |^*0166 The forest of roof top aerials brought into being by the
H22  93 growth of television and \0*2VHF *0radio stirs many people to strong
H22  94 condemnation, and we for our part share these feelings. ^Since
H22  95 television was introduced the increase in the power of the stations
H22  96 and the improved sensitivity of receivers have made outdoor aerials
H22  97 less necessary in many locations. ^Indoor or roof space aerials do not
H22  98 invariably give satisfactory performance even in strong signal areas,
H22  99 and there is therefore no easy or universal answer to this problem.
H22 100 ^But investigations, notably those of the Rowntree Trust at Earswick
H22 101 (York), where on a large estate it was found that almost all the
H22 102 houses could be satisfactorily served by indoor television aerials,
H22 103 have shown that people often think of buying expensive outdoor aerials
H22 104 when they need not do so.
H22 105    |^167 Some local authorities building blocks of flats, and some New
H22 106 Town Corporations, are providing master aerial installations which
H22 107 amplify the signal received at one aerial installation and distribute
H22 108 it by wire to a number of dwellings. ^In many circumstances this is a
H22 109 necessary and sensible thing to do. ^In private enterprise housing
H22 110 there may be less scope for the use of master installations, except in
H22 111 blocks of flats, since there may not be an organisation to deal with
H22 112 its common ownership and maintenance, but in many areas there are
H22 113 relay companies which provide an aerial service on a commercial basis
H22 114 both to local authorities and to private premises. ^A broadcast relay
H22 115 station licence is required if a master aerial system, including a
H22 116 system provided by a local authority, serves two or more sets of
H22 117 premises, {0e.g.} houses or blocks of flats, and applications for
H22 118 such licences should be made to the Post Office. ^Where it is not
H22 119 possible to provide a master aerial installation, and where a loft or
H22 120 indoor aerial is really inadequate, local authorities may consider
H22 121 standardising upon a suitable aerial, or requiring that tenants'
H22 122 aerials should be sited where they cannot be seen from the street or
H22 123 against the skyline, as has been done by a number of local
H22 124 authorities. ^In locations where an outside aerial is necessary a
H22 125 standardised aerial for each dwelling on an estate may perhaps be a
H22 126 practical possibility, and we commend it to the attention of
H22 127 developers.
H22 128    |^168 This is a continuing problem, for if new frequency bands
H22 129 should be brought into use for additional or colour programmes another
H22 130 crop of aerials can be expected, and although at the much higher
H22 131 frequencies likely to be concerned the rods of the aerials will be
H22 132 only about one foot long, outdoor aerials erected clear of buildings
H22 133 are likely to be necessary even quite near to powerful transmitters.
H22 134 ^It is therefore important for the appearance of estates that local
H22 135 authorities and other large property owners should bear in mind that,
H22 136 in conjunction with the local Post Office engineers, it is often
H22 137 possible to do a great deal to mitigate the nuisance; and they should
H22 138 take every opportunity to do so.
H22 139 *<*4*=2 Gardens*>
H22 140    |^*0169 The post war improvements in the standard of living mean
H22 141 that few families now rely on the garden to keep them properly fed.
H22 142 ^It is now used for outdoor living, for children's play and the baby's
H22 143 sleep; and it is cultivated either for the pleasure of gardening or
H22 144 only because it has to be kept tidy. ^With the tendency for densities
H22 145 to increase at the same time as space has to be provided for more cars
H22 146 to be kept, it will be a temptation to squeeze garden sizes to a point
H22 147 where they will no longer cater for these things. ^The evidence we
H22 148 received suggests that any call for large gardens is declining as
H22 149 other interests, such as the car, come to take up more of people's
H22 150 leisure time. ^Where gardens are small, as they may well be when
H22 151 houses are built at densities which in the past have usually called
H22 152 for a proportion of flats, it will be important to plan for children's
H22 153 play space nearby.
H22 154    |^170 In all gardens arrangements are required which will ensure a
H22 155 reasonable degree of privacy for sitting out and having meals outside.
H22 156 ^Present day gardens are often sadly lacking in this amenity.
H22 157 *<*4*=3 Terrace Houses*- Access*>
H22 158    |^*0171 Probably most of the terrace houses built since 1945 have
H22 159 been laid out in such a way that there is no garden gate giving direct
H22 160 access to the rear of the house, and various means have been adopted
H22 161 to provide for access from the front to the back*- a tunnel between
H22 162 pairs of houses; a through store; a store leading through a utility
H22 163 room; or a store leading through the kitchen. ^Because of the need to
H22 164 provide pedestrian segregation and car storage, much future terrace
H22 165 housing will probably have access to both sides of the house, so
H22 166 meeting most of the requirements. ^The most important, to be met by
H22 167 house and layout taken together, are that there should be access,
H22 168 without entering hall, kitchen or any living room, for bicycles from
H22 169 road or public path to store; for garden tools from store to place of
H22 170 use; and for garden materials from place of delivery to place of use.
H22 171 ^There is also a requirement which we think should not be contravened
H22 172 in any circumstances*- the refuse collector should be able to reach
H22 173 the dust-bin store, and the coalman the fuel store, without entering
H22 174 any part of the house; this must of course be planned having due
H22 175 regard to the convenience of the householder. ^Maintenance men also
H22 176 have to be able to get ladders to both sides of the house.
H22 177 *<*4*=4 Play Space*>
H22 178    |^*0172 *"While the child's attendance at school is compulsory
H22 179 between the ages of five and fifteen, enjoyment of facilities for
H22 180 following his out-of-school interests is, and must remain, within the
H22 181 child's or parents' choice. ^It should be of as much concern to the
H22 182 general public that he has the necessary facilities for these
H22 183 leisure-time activities as that there is a school for him to
H22 184 attend**".
H22 185    |^173 We agree with this point of view, and also with the statement
H22 186 in the report of the Flats Sub-Committee published as *"Living in
H22 187 Flats**" in 1952 that *"the provision of one or more playgrounds must
H22 188 be the first call on available space around flats, because it is on
H22 189 children that the inevitable restrictions of flat life press most
H22 190 hardly.**"
H22 191 *# 2014

H23   2 ^*0For example, the London Board have almost completed the
H23   3 rationalisation of their stores in which sixty old premises have been
H23   4 vacated, twenty-one new ones built and twenty-three completely
H23   5 reorganised. ^The Eastern Board after completing the centralisation of
H23   6 meter maintenance have achieved a 40 per \0cent. increase in output
H23   7 compared with 1948-49, with substantial savings in costs.
H23   8    |^237. In addition, clerical methods and accounting techniques are
H23   9 under continual review in all the Boards. ^Electronic calculators and
H23  10 high speed tabulators have steadily replaced older types of equipment
H23  11 and are now commonplace in the industry. ^The introduction of
H23  12 computers is proceeding where justifiable and the Council and Boards
H23  13 are in close touch with manufacturers about computer developments of
H23  14 special significance for electricity supply application.
H23  15 *<*2CHAPTER 6*>
H23  16 *<*6EMPLOYEES*>
H23  17 *<*1Staffing of the Electricity Council*>
H23  18    |^*0238. At 31st March, 1961, the staff of the Electricity Council
H23  19 numbered 514, of whom 346 were located at the Council's headquarters
H23  20 in London and 168 were outstationed. ^Since March, 1958, when the
H23  21 total employed was 542, the Council have made slight reductions each
H23  22 year bringing about a total decrease of 5 per \0cent. in their staff
H23  23 up to the end of March, 1961.
H23  24    |^239. At the end of another successful year for the industry, the
H23  25 Electricity Council are glad once again to record their appreciation
H23  26 of the efficient manner in which their staff have conducted the
H23  27 Council's business.
H23  28 *<*4Personnel of the Industry*>
H23  29    |^*0240. At 31st March, 1961, there were 193,174 persons employed
H23  30 in the electricity supply industry; 514 by the Electricity Council,
H23  31 55,198 by the Central Electricity Generating Board, and 137,462 by the
H23  32 Area Boards. ^The combined total exceeded the corresponding figure at
H23  33 the end of the previous year by 2.4 per \0cent.
H23  34    |^241. This overall increase should be viewed against the expanding
H23  35 business of the industry. ^Thus, whilst Area Boards sold 12.4 per
H23  36 \0cent. more units during the year their total manpower at the end of
H23  37 the year had increased by less than 1.8 per \0cent., and although the
H23  38 number of units sent out by the Generating Board increased by 10.9 per
H23  39 \0cent. the number of persons they employed rose by only 4.1 per
H23  40 \0cent. ^The reduction from 44 to 42 hours in the normal working week
H23  41 of the industry's manual employees towards the end of the preceding
H23  42 year can also be assumed to have influenced the increase in numbers in
H23  43 those grades during the year under report.
H23  44    |^242. Classified details of the numbers employed by the Council
H23  45 and by each Electricity Board, with corresponding figures for 31st
H23  46 March, 1960, are shown in Appendix *=10. ^The classification relates
H23  47 to the main branches of the national negotiating machinery and the
H23  48 following table summarises the detailed figures given in the Appendix.
H23  49 **[TABLE**]
H23  50 *<*4Terms and Conditions of Employment*>
H23  51    |^*0243. The arrangements for settling terms and conditions of
H23  52 employment of persons employed by the Electricity Council and the
H23  53 Boards have been fully described in previous reports. ^During the year
H23  54 the negotiating machinery dealt with a wide range of matters arising
H23  55 in the normal course of day-to-day relations between employees and
H23  56 management. ^The major issues on wage rates and salary scales are
H23  57 reported briefly in the following paragraphs.
H23  58 *<*1National Joint Industrial Council for Manual Workers*>
H23  59    |^*0244. The Electricity Council Annual Report for 1959-60 referred
H23  60 to a claim for a substantial increase in wage rates submitted by the
H23  61 Trade Unions in January, 1960, and indicated that negotiations were
H23  62 still in progress.
H23  63    |^245. In April, 1960, the Electricity Boards' Members rejected the
H23  64 claim but offered to examine with the Trade Unions, after 30th June,
H23  65 1960, the whole question of wages and to apply any resulting wage
H23  66 increase from 31st August, 1960. ^This offer was rejected by the Trade
H23  67 Unions who, in May, 1960, referred the claim to arbitration.
H23  68    |^246. The arbitration tribunal, meeting in July, were unable to
H23  69 agree and by the Chairman's decision found against the claim but
H23  70 recommended that the parties should re-examine the whole question of
H23  71 wages at an early date. ^Acting on this recommendation the National
H23  72 Joint Industrial Council concluded an agreement on 12th August whereby
H23  73 the structure of the wages schedule was re-cast. ^The existing
H23  74 structure of just over one hundred named grades on thirty-three wage
H23  75 rates was replaced by eight groups with eight group rates and five
H23  76 lead rates for certain grades based on the capacity rating of plant on
H23  77 which they are employed. ^There was a general wage increase of 3\0d.
H23  78 per hour with greater increases for some grades, including craftsmen,
H23  79 and increases were made to chargehands' enhancements and foremen's
H23  80 salaries.
H23  81 *<*1Technical Engineering Staff*>
H23  82    |^*0247. The main feature of the National Joint Board's activities
H23  83 during the year was the introduction, with effect from 1st July, 1960,
H23  84 of common salary scales applicable to all National Joint Board
H23  85 Technical Engineering staff, in place of the four existing salary
H23  86 schedules. ^Technical engineering staff in drawing offices were at the
H23  87 same time brought within the classification provisions of the
H23  88 Agreement, from which they had previously been excluded. ^The common
H23  89 scales were not designed to provide salary increases but to introduce
H23  90 a more equitable pattern of salary relationships between the various
H23  91 sections of the technical engineering staff, and to allow more
H23  92 flexibility in their application to varying forms of organisation.
H23  93    |^248. Subsequently, the National Joint Board salary scales were
H23  94 further reviewed, having regard to salaries paid elsewhere within the
H23  95 industry and by outside industry in general, and increases ranging
H23  96 from *+75 to *+215 (*+40 to *+50 for technical trainees) {6per
H23  97 annum} were agreed with effect from 1st July, 1960.
H23  98 *<*1Administrative and Clerical Grades*>
H23  99    |^*0249. The Electricity Council's Annual Report for 1959-60
H23 100 referred to the recommendation of an arbitration tribunal that a claim
H23 101 for increases in salary scales should be considered on the basis of
H23 102 evidence drawn from a wide range of employment in comparable work.
H23 103 ^After examining information obtained from other bodies on salaries
H23 104 and conditions of service, the National Joint Council were unable to
H23 105 agree on the assessment of salaries and asked the tribunal to
H23 106 determine appropriate increases. ^Increases awarded by the tribunal,
H23 107 from 1st December, 1959, ranged from *+20 to *+50 {6per annum} to
H23 108 the general clerical staff and from *+75 to *+215 {6per annum} to
H23 109 the higher grades.
H23 110 *<*1Managerial and Higher Executive Grades*>
H23 111    |^*0250. The basis of the salary agreement was extended to cater
H23 112 for operational growth in the various organisations and, following
H23 113 salary and wages awards to other employees, increases ranging from
H23 114 *+225 to *+400 were made in the salary scales as from 1st July, 1960.
H23 115 *<*4Joint Consultation*>
H23 116    |^*0251. Joint discussion of the business and policies of the
H23 117 industry leading to full collaboration between management and
H23 118 employees is an important factor in making electricity supply an
H23 119 efficient service, and one of the objects of the joint consultative
H23 120 machinery in the electricity supply industry is to facilitate such
H23 121 discussion. ^A brief account of activities in this field during the
H23 122 year is given in the following paragraphs.
H23 123 *<*1National Joint Advisory Council*>
H23 124    |^*0252. In the National Council representatives of employees join
H23 125 with senior representatives of the Electricity Council and Boards and
H23 126 leading Trade Union officers. ^The Chairman and other Members of the
H23 127 Electricity Council and Boards present reports on the progress and
H23 128 plans of the industry; these reports are fully discussed and points
H23 129 arising are often referred to one of the National Council's standing
H23 130 committees for more detailed study.
H23 131    |^253. During the year the National Council discussed all aspects
H23 132 of the industry's work, special emphasis being on education and
H23 133 training. ^Fifteen recommendations were made to Boards; the subjects
H23 134 included safety rules (radiological) for use at nuclear stations;
H23 135 amendments and additions to other safety rules; safety training during
H23 136 pre-commissioning courses at new power stations; methods of helping to
H23 137 solve the problem of employing the impending *"bulge**" in school
H23 138 leavers; improved liaison between the industry and educational
H23 139 organisations; and wider selection methods under the scheme for the
H23 140 interchange of personnel with overseas countries.
H23 141    |^254. The National Council issued an annual report on their work
H23 142 as well as other publications designed to encourage the work of the
H23 143 District Councils and Local Committees. ^One of the National Council's
H23 144 new ventures, the production of a film dealing with the basic
H23 145 principles of joint consultation, has been well received at employees'
H23 146 meetings throughout the industry and has been widely shown outside the
H23 147 industry.
H23 148 *<*1District Joint Advisory Councils*>
H23 149    |^*0255. The membership of each of the 12 District Councils
H23 150 includes representatives of employees as well as of the Boards and
H23 151 Trade Unions. ^The District Councils do much to stimulate the
H23 152 development of joint consultation in their areas. ^During the year
H23 153 they made many notable recommendations to the Boards affecting the
H23 154 interests of employees and the efficiency of the industry. ^These
H23 155 included recommendations on consumer relations, training in modern
H23 156 power station practice for employees in older stations; the
H23 157 rehabilitation of disabled employees; and the problems of
H23 158 communicating instructions, information and ideas. ^Four District
H23 159 Councils organised evening lectures for employees on human relations
H23 160 in industry and seven arranged district training courses for new
H23 161 members of the Local Committees. ^Ten District Councils received and
H23 162 discussed regular progress reports from Electricity Boards.
H23 163 *<*1Local Advisory Committees*>
H23 164    |^*0256. There were 468 Local Advisory Committees in power
H23 165 stations, distribution districts and other places of work in the
H23 166 industry. ^They continued to pay particular attention to education,
H23 167 training, safety and the encouragement of efficiency*- this last
H23 168 subject receiving more attention than any other during the year.
H23 169 ^Their recommendations to local managements concerned such subjects as
H23 170 the effectiveness of particular tools and equipment, sales development
H23 171 in smokeless zones, accident prevention and local training schemes and
H23 172 courses. ^They also continued to engage in many activities for
H23 173 spreading information among employees in their localities. ^An
H23 174 important development in this field, which has done much to improve
H23 175 two-way communication between management and employees, has been the
H23 176 holding of regular informal meetings of small groups of employees who
H23 177 normally work together. ^Other activities have included the
H23 178 organisation of general meetings of employees, safety weeks, power
H23 179 station open days, exhibitions of award-winning suggestions, arts and
H23 180 crafts exhibitions, and lunch-time and evening lectures.
H23 181 *<*1Suggestion Scheme*>
H23 182    |^*0257. From the time when the employees' suggestion scheme
H23 183 started (in most districts by 1951-52) up to 31st March, 1961,
H23 184 consideration has been given to 20,099 suggestions and 7,824 awards
H23 185 have been made by the Electricity Boards on the recommendations of
H23 186 District Councils. ^In 1960-61 the National Council considered 152
H23 187 suggestions which had been referred to them as having possible
H23 188 national application; in rather more than half of these they
H23 189 circulated details to the Electricity Boards, in all cases
H23 190 recommending additional awards.
H23 191 *<*4Superannuation*>
H23 192    |^*0258. Careful consideration was given by the Electricity Council
H23 193 and the Electricity Boards to the impact on the industry's
H23 194 superannuation schemes of the National Insurance Act, 1959, and its
H23 195 provisions for contracting out of the State graduated pension scheme.
H23 196 ^Having obtained the views of the Trade Unions, and after joint
H23 197 consultation with the employees through the Advisory machinery, the
H23 198 Electricity Council and Boards decided upon a common policy of
H23 199 contracting out all their employees whose basic rate of pay exceeds
H23 200 *+9 per week and who are members of Superannuation Schemes in the
H23 201 industry recognised by the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance
H23 202 for the purposes of the National Insurance Act, 1959.
H23 203    |^259. The Registrar of Non-Participating Employments issued the
H23 204 necessary certificate to be effective from 3rd April, 1961, the
H23 205 commencing date for the State graduated pension scheme. ^The National
H23 206 Insurance (Modification of Electricity Superannuation Schemes)
H23 207 Regulations, 1961, applicable to all the industry's schemes whose
H23 208 members are contracted out of the State scheme, came into force on the
H23 209 same day.
H23 210    |^260. The second valuation of the Staff Superannuation Scheme
H23 211 showed an overall surplus of almost *+2 million, which the Council,
H23 212 with the agreement of the Electricity Boards, decided to retain in the
H23 213 Fund. ^The Actuaries' Report on the first valuation of the Manual
H23 214 Workers' Superannuation Scheme was received just before the close of
H23 215 the year.
H23 216 *<*4Safety, Health and Welfare*>
H23 217 *<*1Safety*>
H23 218    |^*0261. The Safety Branch of the Electricity Council advise the
H23 219 various sections of the industry on safety matters and promote and
H23 220 encourage the use of methods for reducing accidents and dangerous
H23 221 occurrences and their effect on the operations of the Boards.

H24 118 *<*6CONTROL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE*>
H24 119    |^*0The Select Committee on Estimates published a Report in 1958 on
H24 120 Treasury Control of Expenditure. ^They recommended that a small
H24 121 independent Committee, which should have access to Cabinet papers, be
H24 122 appointed to report upon the theory and practice of Treasury control
H24 123 of expenditure. ^The Treasury's observations on the Report recorded
H24 124 the conclusion of the Government that they could not accept the
H24 125 Committee's recommendation in favour of an outside committee, but that
H24 126 they had decided to set in hand a review of the principles and
H24 127 practice which govern the control by the executive of public
H24 128 expenditure. ^It was also stated that this would be an internal
H24 129 enquiry under the authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
H24 130 that on some aspects of it the Government proposed to seek advice from
H24 131 persons with appropriate knowledge and experience who were not members
H24 132 of the Government or in the Government service.
H24 133    |^2. In accordance with these decisions your predecessor announced
H24 134 in the summer of 1959 that I had been appointed by him to take general
H24 135 charge of this work aided by a Group consisting of persons from
H24 136 outside the Government service and senior officials drawn from
H24 137 Departments including the Treasury. ^Later it was announced that Sir
H24 138 Sam Brown, Sir Jeremy Raisman and \0Mr. {0J. E.} Wall had been
H24 139 appointed to the Group.
H24 140    |^3. The announcement of the enquiry made it clear that our
H24 141 proceedings and recommendations to Ministers would be confidential.
H24 142 ^We could not have carried out the survey which we have been able to
H24 143 make on any other basis. ^As our enquiry developed we submitted to
H24 144 your predecessor and to you a series of confidential reports. ^It was
H24 145 always our intention to consolidate these at the end, and we have
H24 146 prepared the attached Report in order to do so in a form in which, if
H24 147 you saw fit, it could be published.
H24 148    |^4. In tendering advice which the Government may wish to publish
H24 149 we are not unmindful of the position of our Civil Service colleagues
H24 150 and therefore, notwithstanding their full participation in the work of
H24 151 the Group, we consider it more appropriate that our Report should be
H24 152 submitted in the names of the members from outside the Government
H24 153 service, who take responsibility for it. ^Consequently what is said in
H24 154 it is in the names of Sir Sam Brown, Sir Jeremy Raisman, \0Mr. {0J.
H24 155 E.} Wall and myself. ^It does not follow from this procedure however
H24 156 that those civil servants who have taken part in the work of the
H24 157 enquiry in any way dissent from the views expressed or the
H24 158 recommendations made, either in general or in particular.
H24 159    |^On behalf of the Group,
H24 160    |*2PLOWDEN
H24 161    |*0Chairman.
H24 162    |^9th June, 1961.
H24 163 *<*6REPORT ON THE CONTROL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE*>
H24 164    |^*01. At our first meeting in October, 1959, we decided to
H24 165 concentrate in full committee on the central problem of public
H24 166 expenditure, which is the determination of policy and the distribution
H24 167 of resources, while studying in smaller groups particular aspects of
H24 168 expenditure control or areas of expenditure. ^For these studies we
H24 169 co-opted the Permanent Secretaries of the Departments with whose
H24 170 expenditure we were concerned or who had special experience of the
H24 171 general problems under review. ^In some cases we sought specialist
H24 172 advice from outside the Civil Service. ^We decided, however, not to
H24 173 take evidence from outside bodies: our review was primarily concerned
H24 174 with the inner working of the Treasury and the Departments, and was
H24 175 necessarily confidential in character, and we decided that the Group
H24 176 itself (except on certain specialist matters) provided a sufficient
H24 177 body of outside opinion to bring to bear on this task.
H24 178    |^2. A comprehensive review of the principles and practice of the
H24 179 control of public expenditure would take many years. ^There are large
H24 180 tracts of the territory which we have hardly touched. ^The method
H24 181 which we adopted, however, which was in effect a continuous
H24 182 consultation with the Permanent Secretaries and other officials of the
H24 183 major Departments over a period of nearly two years, has, we believe,
H24 184 given us a sufficient insight into the matter. ^We are confident that
H24 185 our conclusions would not be changed by more prolonged examination.
H24 186    |^3. In our judgment, the crucial questions are not those of
H24 187 detail: the precise nature of the organisation and chains of command
H24 188 within and between Departments, important though these are. ^The real
H24 189 problems are wider: what the machine of government is trying to do,
H24 190 what its attitudes are, what it regards as important, and its approach
H24 191 to its work on all matters involving public expenditure. ^These are
H24 192 not always clear cut, and they do not lend themselves readily to
H24 193 specific recommendations; but we are confident that here is the kernel
H24 194 of the matter. ^The whole of this Report is designed to suggest what
H24 195 might be the most fruitful lines of development in the future.
H24 196    |^4. Before we proceed to the substance of the Report, we may
H24 197 perhaps usefully comment on what we have seen of the work of the Civil
H24 198 Service in the course of this enquiry. ^Those of us who are outside
H24 199 the Civil Service have considerable experience of it, here and
H24 200 overseas, but this has been a favourable opportunity to see it and
H24 201 study it in action. ^There have been changes, both in scope and
H24 202 character, in the activities of Government in the last two decades,
H24 203 which have produced strains in traditional structures and practices.
H24 204 ^We have been impressed by the way the Service has adapted itself to
H24 205 deal with these changes.

H25   2 *<*4Barnardo's Overseas*>
H25   3    |^*0Times do not change in Great Britain only but in the rest of
H25   4 the world too, and out of this pattern of restless progress come calls
H25   5 for help with Child Care problems, both for actual care and for help
H25   6 and guidance in how this can best be given. ^We thus learn that the
H25   7 name of Barnardo comes to the mind, when child care is planned in many
H25   8 parts of the world remote from our own land, and we are honoured by
H25   9 receiving these calls for help.
H25  10    |^In 1954 we decided to consider undertaking work in Kenya and in
H25  11 1956 \0Mr. {0T. F.} Tucker, then Deputy General Superintendent, made
H25  12 a personal investigation. ^As a result, two of our experienced
H25  13 superintendents, \0Rev. and \0Mrs. {0A. St. J.} Lemon, have spent
H25  14 two years guiding and assisting the work of the local Child Welfare
H25  15 Society which was striving nobly to meet a great need but lacking our
H25  16 knowledge and experience. ^During 1960, assured of the good-will of
H25  17 the Government and their Officials and with generous help over a site,
H25  18 plans have been made to build a Home for thirty children of any race
H25  19 who may be in need. ^This should be in use before the end of 1961.
H25  20    |^With Sir Donald MacGillivray as our President and a
H25  21 representative committee of which \0Mr. {0B. S.} Eastwood is
H25  22 Chairman and \0Mr. \0L. Njonjo Vice Chairman, we are assured of strong
H25  23 local support and in addition can look to the help of \0Mr. \0M. Adlam
H25  24 as \0Hon. Treasurer and the \0Hon. Humphrey Slade as our Honorary
H25  25 Legal Adviser.
H25  26    |^Sir Arthur Smith reported enthusiastically on the Inaugural
H25  27 Meeting which he attended in Nairobi, on 29th November, 1960, when Sir
H25  28 Godfrey Rhodes was in the Chair supported by the \0Hon. {0J. N.}
H25  29 Muimi, {0M.L.C.}, the Minister of Health.
H25  30    |^We rejoice at this opening of a new chapter in our history and
H25  31 have little doubt that others will watch with interest this experiment
H25  32 in adapting the Barnardo standards and methods of Child Care to the
H25  33 needs of a community whose conditions of life are very different from
H25  34 our own. ^Another small piece of help which may be mentioned is that
H25  35 which is being given to the Sanyu Babies Home in Uganda, in order that
H25  36 this work, started by Missionaries of the Church Missionary Society,
H25  37 for babies abandoned in the Mission Hospital, may be further
H25  38 developed.
H25  39    |^Mention should also be made of an appeal from Hong Kong to assist
H25  40 in the placing of abandoned babies, approved as suitable, by the
H25  41 International Social Service, with married couples in this country,
H25  42 who have offered to take such children into their homes. ^In Hong Kong
H25  43 destitute children in as dire need as any \0Dr. Barnardo found a
H25  44 hundred years ago on our London streets are a common sight, but it is
H25  45 clear that the support and guidance of an Adoption Society such as our
H25  46 own is essential if such placements are to be made happily, and the
H25  47 interests of these abandoned children safeguarded, in all
H25  48 eventualities. ^We have gladly responded to this call and who can tell
H25  49 to what new enterprises these initial experiments may lead by the time
H25  50 we reach our Centenary in 1966?
H25  51 *<*4Changes in Australia too*>
H25  52    |^*0The wind of change has been blowing in the Australian branch of
H25  53 our family too, and much has happened there during the last year,
H25  54 which will be of interest to our readers. ^Some of our large units,
H25  55 such as the Picton Farm School and parts of Normanhurst, have been
H25  56 sold and new Homes more suitable as family group Homes purchased, and
H25  57 in addition, a Boarding Out Officer has been appointed in order to
H25  58 further this type of care in our Australian work. ^We have
H25  59 unfortunately experienced some difficulty in finding a sufficient
H25  60 number of children free to emigrate from this country, partly because
H25  61 of the ties which so many now retain with at least some members of
H25  62 their own family. ^Although this must be disappointing to our New
H25  63 South Wales Committee who have given so much thought and effort to the
H25  64 changes already mentioned, they hope also to open a new chapter in
H25  65 offering admission to local Australian children who may be in need.
H25  66 *<*4Barnardo Publications on Child Care*>
H25  67    |^*0Opening new branches is not however the only way in which we
H25  68 feel able to help with child care problems in the world at large, and
H25  69 we always welcome at Stepney the numerous visitors from abroad who
H25  70 want to profit by the experience of our senior officers and also see
H25  71 some of our Branch Homes or Special Schools for themselves.
H25  72    |^But there is much help that could be disseminated more widely by
H25  73 means of booklets on various technical aspects of our work, and the
H25  74 preparation of two of these has begun this year. ^One is on the method
H25  75 of helping cases of enuresis or bed wetting and the other out-lines
H25  76 **[SIC**] a scheme of help for spastic children (those suffering from
H25  77 cerebral palsy) from early infancy. ^Further subjects will be dealt
H25  78 with in due course, and should prove a valuable means of passing on to
H25  79 others the experience we have gained ourselves through the years since
H25  80 \0Dr. Barnardo himself first opened the door nearly 100 years ago.
H25  81 *<*4Homes for Special Needs*>
H25  82    |^*0The work of our Special Homes, linked with boarding schools for
H25  83 the backward or physically handicapped has continued steadily and
H25  84 there have been small waiting lists for any vacancies that might
H25  85 occur. ^The Ministry of Education, convinced that the need for these
H25  86 schools has been largely met, placed limits on the maximum numbers for
H25  87 each school, which reduced the places available by about twenty-five.
H25  88 ^As far as we are concerned, the chief effect of the more adequate
H25  89 national provision for the physically handicapped has been a tendency
H25  90 to limit applicants for admission to a special type of problem. ^This
H25  91 is the child with a severe handicap, whatever its actual nature, and
H25  92 of relatively retarded intelligence, whose home cannot cope with the
H25  93 problem involved. ^Such cases exact a heavy toll of patience and toil
H25  94 from our staff, and we never cease to admire the devoted service so
H25  95 many of them give to this cause. ^The work makes its own appeal
H25  96 however, and we have not experienced undue difficulty in keeping these
H25  97 Homes staffed.
H25  98    |^A special group of these children is the severe *'Spastics**'
H25  99 whose educability can only be decided by an actual period of trial.
H25 100 ^The County Education Officers have shown themselves more than ready
H25 101 to sponsor such a trial but often search desperately for any boarding
H25 102 school willing to provide the opportunity. ^Here we have felt was a
H25 103 need which should appeal to an organisation such as ours, and we have
H25 104 arranged an extra class in each of our five schools, where such a
H25 105 trial can be given.
H25 106    |^Allied to this work has been our centre near Derby at which we
H25 107 have sheltered and helped up to 25 mentally disordered children who
H25 108 have either been ascertained as such subsequent to admission, or who
H25 109 were admitted for a short period to give their parents a much needed
H25 110 rest.
H25 111    |^Mention has already been made of the working party considering
H25 112 the needs of children suffering from mental disorder. ^This has now
H25 113 reported and its recommendations have been accepted by the Council.
H25 114 ^Although they can only be implemented in due course it is hoped to
H25 115 extend the work we are now doing at our Home near Derby, and thus
H25 116 increase the scope of our work to help in this urgent national
H25 117 problem.
H25 118    |^There remain one or two specific problems such as deafness,
H25 119 blindness or severe speech defects for which we do not ourselves
H25 120 provide the special treatment and education required, but even here,
H25 121 we can and do help by arranging admission and then planning the help
H25 122 required with the aid of those who have the facilities. ^With this
H25 123 provision in mind, we might rightly add to our original motto *'No
H25 124 destitute child ever refused admission**', a modern variation *'No
H25 125 child in need refused the help he or she requires**'. ^We are
H25 126 certainly doing our best to make this a reality.
H25 127 *<*4Our Approved Schools*>
H25 128    |^*0A glance at the page *'Our Work in Brief**' which concludes
H25 129 this Report, may surprise some by its reference to two approved
H25 130 schools, and it will be noted that this is not a charge on our
H25 131 charitable funds. ^It is however a piece of work of which Barnardo
H25 132 supporters should rightly be very proud, and the record of these two
H25 133 schools in their work for children in need is not surpassed by that of
H25 134 any of our other branches.
H25 135    |^It is perhaps not sufficiently realised by the public generally
H25 136 that the Home Office is glad to entrust the running of these schools
H25 137 to a number of Christian Organisations, realising that the Christian
H25 138 faith and way of life can supply the stabilising power these boys so
H25 139 greatly need. ^It will of course be realised that the boys admitted
H25 140 have been sent to us by the Children's Courts and have no other
H25 141 connection with our own Barnardo family.
H25 142    |^In most cases the boys lack the right kind of home support and
H25 143 care and at times may have no suitable home to which they can return
H25 144 when their school training is deemed to be completed. ^This fact makes
H25 145 it most appropriate that a Christian Child Care organisation should be
H25 146 responsible for their future and can, when necessary, offer the
H25 147 hospitality of a Home or Hostel to meet the need.
H25 148 *<*4Going Out into the World*>
H25 149    |^*0For every boy and girl who has been living in the Barnardo
H25 150 family the day comes when they must start in their first post and in
H25 151 many cases have their first experience of lodgings.
H25 152    |^It will be realised how much help they may need in the first one
H25 153 or two years, and our well organised and staffed After Care
H25 154 departments for boys and girls are planned to provide this help.
H25 155 *<*4What Happens*>
H25 156    |^*0You may wonder what happens to our boys and girls, and the
H25 157 answer can best be found in the pages of the old boys and girls
H25 158 Magazine the *1Guild Messenger. ^*0This is published four times a year
H25 159 and each issue has at least twelve pages of *"News from *2ALL
H25 160 *0Quarters**", weddings, \0etc., and correspondence from all parts of
H25 161 the world. ^It is a wonderful story of how these young people, who
H25 162 seemed at one time to have lost all that matters most, have won their
H25 163 way back to find their own niche in a difficult world. ^This magazine,
H25 164 with all its personal news, is only for members of the old Boys and
H25 165 Girls Guild, but if any of our keen supporters could steal a glimpse
H25 166 at its pages, their hearts would be warmed within them.
H25 167    |^It tells also of annual re-unions and dinners held in various
H25 168 parts of the country and of the activities in the well established
H25 169 club at Stepney, where old boys and girls, within reach, foregather on
H25 170 Friday evenings or for special social occasions.
H25 171    |^Finally, mention may be made of a letter which is sent out at
H25 172 Christmastime to every old boy and girl whose address is known,
H25 173 however many years ago they may have left our care. ^Some six thousand
H25 174 of these are sent and the numerous replies received indicate how much
H25 175 they are appreciated.
H25 176 *<*4What is the Secret of Success*>
H25 177    |^*0We of course have our *"black sheep**" and some do not succeed
H25 178 as well as others in overcoming their initial handicaps, but we feel
H25 179 confident that our records reveal a high level of success in preparing
H25 180 our boys and girls for life and all its demands upon them. ^When
H25 181 viewed against the background of low standards of morality, honesty
H25 182 and behaviour which many of our National leaders deplore as a feature
H25 183 of our times, we might well be challenged to say what is the secret of
H25 184 character building which turns out so many of our children as worthy
H25 185 citizens.
H25 186    |^The answer may best be given by saying that *5we would not dare
H25 187 to take the responsibility of sending these our children out into the
H25 188 world without the foundation of a strong Christian faith.

H26  35 surgeon in 1609 in the North Riding of Yorkshire, recording the
H26  36 ailments, treatment, and payments of his patients.
H26  37    |^An autograph letter from John Hunter to William Eden, 1st Lord

H26  53 *<*4Meetings and other Activities*>
H26  54    |^*0By permission of the President, meetings were held in the
H26  55 Library by the Medical Section of the Library Association and by the
H26  56 Society for the Bibliography of Natural History. ^The librarians of
H26  57 the eight principal medical libraries in London held their annual
H26  58 meeting in the Librarian's office and discussed the ways and means of
H26  59 their co-operation. ^This informal co-operative organisation was
H26  60 inaugurated in 1938 under the encouragement of Sir Gordon
H26  61 Gordon-Taylor, when he was chairman of the College's library
H26  62 committee.
H26  63    |^Several foreign surgeons, scholars, and librarians have visited
H26  64 the Library, and the Librarian was particularly honoured by a visit
H26  65 from \0Dr. \0F. Bradford Rogers, Director of the {0U.S.} National
H26  66 Library of Medicine, when he was passing through London.
H26  67    |^The Honorary Librarian was awarded the first Honorary Fellowship
H26  68 of the new Faculty of the History of Medicine and Pharmacy of the
H26  69 Society of Apothecaries.
H26  70    |^The Librarian has been elected a Fellow of the Society of
H26  71 Antiquaries and an Honorary Fellow of the Hunterian Society. ^He has
H26  72 continued to serve as chairman of the Library Committee of the Royal
H26  73 College of Nursing, and has been appointed to the Council of the World
H26  74 List of Scientific Periodicals. ^He attended by invitation a meeting
H26  75 called by the Royal Society of Medicine to discuss the part which
H26  76 various national and medical libraries might be able to play in
H26  77 providing a more complete service of medical literature on a national
H26  78 scale.
H26  79    |^The Assistant Librarian has served on the Council of the Library
H26  80 Association, and is Honorary Secretary of its Medical Section.
H26  81    |^The Librarian spoke to the postgraduate students on the use and
H26  82 facilities of the Library at the beginning of each of the courses of
H26  83 lectures. ^By direction of the Council, he was privileged to address
H26  84 the Annual Meeting of Fellows and Members on the work of the Library
H26  85 in connexion with the teaching and research departments.
H26  86 *<*6EXHIBITIONS*>
H26  87    |^*0In addition to the permanent exhibitions of Hunteriana, medals,
H26  88 drawings, \0etc., temporary exhibits have been shown for special
H26  89 occasions in the Exhibition Halls. ^The Library has had the
H26  90 co-operation of the historical departments of the Museum in the
H26  91 mounting of these, and particular thanks are due to Miss Jessie
H26  92 Dobson, the Anatomy Curator, for her help and advice. ^An exhibition
H26  93 of Listeriana was set up at the time of the Lister Lecture, and the
H26  94 bicentenary of the birth of Matthew Baillie in 1761 has been
H26  95 commemorated by an exhibit of books and documents from the
H26  96 Hunter-Baillie collection, illustrating his career. ^Professor {0H.
H26  97 J.} Seddon kindly lent several drawings and other memorabilia of the
H26  98 early years of modern orthopaedic surgery for exhibition on the
H26  99 occasion of his Robert Jones lecture, to augment the valuable exhibits
H26 100 permanently shown by the British Orthopaedic Association.
H26 101    |^The College lent four early anaesthesia books to the University
H26 102 Library at Nancy for exhibition at the national anaesthesia conference
H26 103 of France. ^A collection of portrait engravings of famous medical men
H26 104 was lent to the Art Gallery at Auckland for the {0B.M.A.} meeting in
H26 105 New Zealand.

H26 144 *<Report*>
H26 145    |^*0During the year 1960-1961 the work of the Board and its
H26 146 Committees has continued to grow, while the Department of Dental
H26 147 Science has pursued its researches with vigour and enthusiasm.
H26 148    |^At a Meeting of the Board on 18th November, 1960, the following
H26 149 resolution of appreciation was passed for the services rendered to the
H26 150 Department since its inception by Sir Wilfred Fish:*-
H26 151 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]
H26 152    |^*"That the Faculty of Dental Surgery desires to record its deep
H26 153 sense of gratitude to Sir Wilfred Fish, lately Honorary Director of
H26 154 the Department of Dental Science, for the outstanding services he has
H26 155 rendered to dental science in establishing the Department and guiding
H26 156 it over the past five years. ^Sir Wilfred Fish's inspiring leadership
H26 157 and wise administration have established the Department on so sure a
H26 158 basis that it is in every respect well equipped to advance its work
H26 159 with energy and confidence.**"
H26 160 **[END INDENTATION**]
H26 161    |^The Board was very pleased to receive from the President on his
H26 162 return from an extensive tour overseas a message of goodwill to the
H26 163 Faculty from Sir John Walsh, Dean of the Otago Dental School, New
H26 164 Zealand.
H26 165    |^In the field of postgraduate education the Board has been greatly
H26 166 encouraged by the enthusiastic response to the courses of lectures and
H26 167 scientific meetings arranged by the Faculty. ^It was particularly
H26 168 pleasing to find that over three hundred and fifty dentists attended
H26 169 the Scientific Meeting in June and the Board feels sure that this
H26 170 scientific meeting has now become an established annual event which
H26 171 the profession has welcomed eagerly.
H26 172 *<*4*=1. Elections to the Board*>
H26 173    |^*0As a result of a postal ballot on 16th June 1961, to fill five
H26 174 vacancies on the Board following the retirement in rotation of four
H26 175 Fellows and the resignation of one Fellow, the following were
H26 176 re-elected or elected to the Board:*-

H26 180 *<*4*=2. Thirteenth Annual Meeting*>
H26 181    |^*0The Thirteenth Annual Meeting was held on Friday, 15th July
H26 182 1960, and was attended by forty-eight Fellows and Licentiates in
H26 183 Dental Surgery. ^The Charles Tomes Lecture was delivered on the same

H26 210 following new examiners have been elected by Council:*-
H26 211 **[LIST**]
H26 212 *<*4*=8. Primary {0F.D.S.} Examination*>
H26 213    |^*0The Board has drawn up a guide to the Primary {0F.D.S.}

H26 215 Regulations. ^This guide makes clear the general scope of the
H26 216 examinations in Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology and Bacteriology.
H26 217    |^It has been agreed to exchange visitors with the Royal College of
H26 218 Surgeons of Edinburgh, with a view to considering the desirability of

H27   4 *<*4Lord Chandos *0Chairman of Associated Electrical Industries*>
H27   5    |^*1The Sixty-first Annual General Meeting of Associated Electrical
H27   6 Industries Limited was held on April *020 *1at Grosvenor House, Park
H27   7 Lane, London, \0W.*01. ^*1The {0Rt. Hon.} Viscount Chandos (the
H27   8 Chairman) presided and said:
H27   9    |^*0I have, first a sad and heavy task to perform. ^Two of our
H27  10 Directors, Lord Weeks and \0Mr. Comar Wilson, have died since the date
H27  11 of the last Annual General Meeting. ^Their colleagues on the Board
H27  12 have suffered the loss of two friends. ^Their experience and knowledge
H27  13 in the wide field of business will be greatly missed, and we record
H27  14 our deep gratitude for their services to the Board over a long period.
H27  15    |^Lord Head resigned from the Board on his appointment as High
H27  16 Commissioner in Nigeria. ^Our regrets at losing his services are, in a
H27  17 measure, offset by the knowledge that the post which he now fills is
H27  18 one of the most important in the Commonwealth.
H27  19 *<*4Top Management Strengthened*>
H27  20    |^*0I want next to tell you of certain appointments consequent upon
H27  21 the reorganisation of the Company into a single trading entity. ^We
H27  22 have strengthened the top management at Head Office. ^Sir Cecil
H27  23 Dannatt was appointed Vice-Chairman in April last year, and I take
H27  24 this opportunity on your behalf of congratulating him upon the
H27  25 Knighthood which Her Majesty has conferred upon him. ^He took up his
H27  26 duties last May and his support and knowledge have already proved of
H27  27 the highest value.
H27  28    |^Later in the year, \0Mr. {0C. R.} Wheeler was also appointed a
H27  29 Vice-Chairman. ^We would like publicly to thank Guest, Keen and
H27  30 Nettlefolds \0Ltd. for having agreed to his release. ^\0Mr. Wheeler
H27  31 will take up some executive duties next year. ^We have gained a
H27  32 notable accession of strength by his appointment.
H27  33    |^Sir Joseph Latham joined the Board in August, and since that date
H27  34 he has become Director of Finance. ^His wide experience of both
H27  35 finance and accountancy is proving of outstanding benefit to the
H27  36 Company.
H27  37    |^\0Mr. \0H. West, who has served the Company with distinction for
H27  38 42 years, succeeded \0Dr. Dannatt as Group Managing Director at
H27  39 Manchester in April last, and was elected to the Board at the end of
H27  40 the year.
H27  41    |^\0Mr. {0R. I.} Basset, who for many years has been a Director
H27  42 of {0AEI} Woolwich, also joined the Board.
H27  43    |^You will be asked to confirm these appointments later.
H27  44    |^\0Mr. {0E. R.} Mason has been appointed the sole Managing
H27  45 Director of {0AEI} Export, and \0Mr. {0W. A.} Ankerson Assistant
H27  46 Managing Director of the Woolwich Group. ^\0Mr. {0D. T. L.} Rettie
H27  47 has been appointed the Managing Director of our subsidiary dealing
H27  48 with domestic appliances overseas*- {0A.E.I.} Gala.
H27  49 *<*4Retirements*>
H27  50    |^*0I cannot refer to all those who retired last year, although
H27  51 they are much in our minds, but I would like to mention two by name.
H27  52 ^First, \0Mr. {0E. V.} Small, who for a great many years has been
H27  53 concerned with our export business, and who has been notably ingenious
H27  54 and successful. ^There are a number of contracts still current which
H27  55 he negotiated, and we have retained him as a consultant upon these and
H27  56 more general matters. ^Secondly, \0Mr. \0F. Tankard, the Comptroller
H27  57 at Manchester, who has left us on reaching retiring age. ^We thank him
H27  58 for his past services, and wish him well for the future. ^To all who
H27  59 have retired, we wish happiness and long life.
H27  60 *<*4Research Leaders Honoured*>
H27  61    |^*0Finally, we congratulate all those who have featured in the
H27  62 year's Honours lists, and particularly \0Dr. {0T. E.} Allibone and
H27  63 \0Mr. {0L. J.} Davies. ^The former is the head of our fundamental
H27  64 Research Laboratory at Aldermaston, and the latter the Head of
H27  65 Research at Rugby.
H27  66 *<*61960 TRADING PROFIT AFTER TAX VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED*>
H27  67    |^*0I will deal with the figures very briefly. ^The trading profit,
H27  68 after tax, was virtually unchanged at *+4,722,000 compared with
H27  69 *+4,747,000 last year. ^Although the depreciation charged has risen by
H27  70 *+378,000, this was more than offset by a reduction in our tax
H27  71 liabilities. ^The adventitious profits, which will form part of our
H27  72 revenue as we change our investment, are considerably lower than last
H27  73 year. ^Together with amounts set aside for taxation now no longer
H27  74 required these profits are at just above *+1\0m. compared with just
H27  75 under *+2 1/2\0m. ^The total retention in the business, or, to use the
H27  76 American term, the cash flow, is for this reason slightly less than
H27  77 last year, at *+7,843,000 compared with *+8,127,000.
H27  78    |^The increase of *+10\0m. in working capital consisted partly of
H27  79 bigger stocks of finished goods but mainly of work in progress on
H27  80 large contracts. ^The financing of exports is a heavy burden and we
H27  81 welcome any help that {0H.M.} Government can give us. ^At the end of
H27  82 the year the Group's bank overdrafts totalled over *+9\0m.: however,
H27  83 *+5 1/2\0m. related to the financing of the Berkeley contract and is
H27  84 largely self-liquidating. ^The Board have no proposals for the issue
H27  85 of additional capital.
H27  86    |^The payment of total Ordinary dividends of 3/- per share, will
H27  87 require about *+140,000 more than last year because of the issue of
H27  88 additional Ordinary shares to \0A. Reyrolle and \0Co. \0Ltd. in
H27  89 exchange for our participation in {0C. A.} Parsons and \0Co. \0Ltd.
H27  90 ^There was some loss of revenue involved in the exchange of these
H27  91 shares for shares in {0C. A.} Parsons and \0Co. \0Ltd. in 1960,
H27  92 which of course will be largely recouped in 1961.
H27  93    |^The total Stockholders' capital employed in the business is
H27  94 *+138,906,000, the equity capital is *+133,120,000, against the
H27  95 nominal figure of *+42,828,000. ^The 3/- Ordinary dividend represents
H27  96 a return on the equity capital of slightly under 5%.
H27  97 *<*6TURNOVER UP*- RECORD ORDER BOOK*>
H27  98    |^*0The order book is a record. ^Compared with last year the orders
H27  99 received increased from *+182\0m. to *+233\0m. ^Our turnover increased
H27 100 from *+208\0m. to *+215\0m., and orders in hand have increased from
H27 101 *+173\0m. to *+181\0m.
H27 102    |^Sometimes an increase in the orders in hand is regarded as a
H27 103 wholly favourable feature, but this is only true to a limited extent.
H27 104 ^If the growth in the order book is not matched by parallel growth in
H27 105 engineering and manufacturing capacity it would adversely affect our
H27 106 delivery dates. ^At the figure of *+181\0m. orders would appear
H27 107 appropriate and satisfactory in relation to your business and its
H27 108 annual turnover.
H27 109    |^I would also remind you that the order book in lamps and
H27 110 lighting, domestic appliances and television and radio is, from the
H27 111 nature of the business, only an insignificant percentage of the
H27 112 turnover.
H27 113 *<*4New Telephone Cable Subsidiary*>
H27 114    |^*0Although the deal was not completed until January 1st, as part
H27 115 of the rationalisation in the cable industry, we increased our
H27 116 shareholding in Southern United Telephone Cable \0Co. \0Ltd. by
H27 117 purchasing from British Insulated Callender's Cables \0Ltd. the major
H27 118 proportion of their holding. ^We now own 74 1/2% of the Company. ^Its
H27 119 name has been changed to Telephone Cables \0Ltd. and it is now a
H27 120 subsidiary. ^The balance of the shares are held by our old associates
H27 121 in this venture, Enfield Cables \0Ltd., and it is a matter of
H27 122 satisfaction to all of us to have them as partners.
H27 123    |^The general condition of the electrical industry has made it
H27 124 desirable, and will continue to make it desirable in certain fields,
H27 125 particularly that of research, to engage in co-operative enterprises
H27 126 in order to conserve technical man power and reduce the heavy expense
H27 127 entailed.
H27 128    |^1960 is regarded by your Directors as a disappointing year
H27 129 because the increased profits for which we had budgeted were not
H27 130 realised.
H27 131 *<*4Cables, Telephones, Lamps and Nuclear Power*>
H27 132    |^*0I told you last year that during 1959 we had four parts of our
H27 133 business which were causing us anxiety. ^I recapitulate them: they
H27 134 were cables, telephones, lamps and lighting and nuclear power
H27 135 stations. ^You would wish me to report on them.
H27 136    |^First, we were engaged in rationalising the cable part of our
H27 137 business at a time when demand for cables was particularly buoyant,
H27 138 and when prices were particularly low. ^During 1960, the average
H27 139 prices of cables in the two main categories, mains cables, and
H27 140 thermo-plastic and rubber-covered cables, were still about 17% below
H27 141 what they were in April 1959, and since 1959 we have had to absorb
H27 142 both an increase in wages, and the extra cost involved by a shorter
H27 143 working week. ^It proved to be a difficult and complicated task to
H27 144 bring about this rationalisation and the savings consequent upon it,
H27 145 and we were unable to do so quite as quickly as we had expected. ^It
H27 146 is now practically complete and profits should be made in 1961. ^These
H27 147 facts should make a considerable difference to the revenue of the
H27 148 Company in the present year.
H27 149    |^Secondly, telecommunications. ^Although Governments are unused to
H27 150 thanks, the reorganisation of the Post Office as a trading department,
H27 151 which now does not have to return its surplus at the end of each year
H27 152 to the Treasury, will be widely applauded. ^Its new status enables the
H27 153 Post Office to plan ahead, and we in our turn, as manufacturers, can
H27 154 similarly plan on a more stable foundation, and so bring employment
H27 155 and production into line with the needs of the Post Office. ^The
H27 156 Telecommunications Division, in 1960, traded at a marginal loss, but
H27 157 the outlook for 1961 is more favourable, and although the equipment
H27 158 which we supply is rigorously costed by the Post Office, we expect a
H27 159 moderate return on the capital employed.
H27 160    |^Thirdly, lamps and lighting. ^For three or four years, and in
H27 161 face of falling prices, we have made strenuous efforts to rationalise
H27 162 our production and to reduce our costs. ^I am glad to say that this
H27 163 long and intricate task is now practically completed. ^In 1960 we
H27 164 increased our share of the market, and traded at a better though still
H27 165 inadequate profit. ^Some further improvement should be made in 1961.
H27 166    |^Fourthly, nuclear power. ^The Berkeley Station is due to come
H27 167 into commission this year. ^I can tell you no more on the outcome of
H27 168 the contract than to repeat what I said last year, which is that the
H27 169 sum set aside is what prudent people would allow against
H27 170 contingencies. ^I am not in a position to release any of the
H27 171 ear-marked reserve to revenue or to our General Reserves, nor on the
H27 172 other hand do I think it necessary to increase the reserve at this
H27 173 moment.
H27 174    |^You will remember that last year the interests of {0A.E.I.}
H27 175 John Thompson Nuclear Energy Company \0Ltd. were amalgamated with
H27 176 those of the Nuclear Power Plant Company into a new partnership called
H27 177 The Nuclear Power Group. ^This merger has enabled large savings to be
H27 178 made in technical staff and in costs, and the operations now appear to
H27 179 be adjusted to the likely volume of orders. ^In July 1960 the new
H27 180 Group received the order for the Dungeness Station, the largest
H27 181 projected station at that time. ^The risks involved in tendering for
H27 182 the second station are far less than those involved in the first, when
H27 183 we were breaking new ground, as the earlier problems can now be
H27 184 accurately assessed. ^It should be remembered that competition is
H27 185 still extremely keen, but we expect to make a modest profit upon the
H27 186 station.
H27 187    |^The nuclear generation of power is going to be a permanent
H27 188 feature of the national economy, and both as a source of revenue, and
H27 189 as a protection of our conventional business, the reasons which
H27 190 impelled us to enter this field still seem unassailable. ^I cannot but
H27 191 express my disappointment that the engineering and scientific effort
H27 192 at Berkeley may be rewarded with a loss. ^On the other hand, if you
H27 193 regard the money which we may lose as a development expense and not as
H27 194 a contractual loss, large though it may be, it brings the whole
H27 195 subject into closer perspective.
H27 196    |^Such were the four parts of your business which gave us anxiety
H27 197 at the close of 1959. ^I believe that they are all now in a much
H27 198 better posture.

H27 202 concerning 1960 to which I must refer.

H28   1 **[292 TEXT H28**]
H28   2 *<*5Dorothy Perkins *6LIMITED*>
H28   3 *<*2A DIFFICULT YEAR*>
H28   4 *<*6\0MR. ALAN FARMER ON THE EFFECTS OF A PAYROLL TAX*>
H28   5    |^*0The Annual General Meeting of Dorothy Perkins Limited will be
H28   6 held on August 2nd in London.
H28   7    |^The following are extracts from the Statement by the Chairman,
H28   8 *2\0MR. ALAN FARMER, *0as circulated to Shareholders:*-
H28   9    |^The year ended 30th April, 1961, has proved difficult. ^We
H28  10 occupied the Warehouse portion of the new premises at Bracknell early
H28  11 in the year but the completion of the offices has been delayed by some
H28  12 three months so that we have been forced to function with the
H28  13 administration in the West End and with the distribution centre thirty
H28  14 miles away. ^Apart from the administrative difficulties, the delay in
H28  15 the completion has added to our costs. ^We have had to continue to
H28  16 bring our new staff into London from Bracknell to train at Newman
H28  17 Street whilst maintaining a normal complement in the London Offices.
H28  18    |^Both the London staff, who have stayed with us until such time as
H28  19 the move is completed, and the new staff who have joined us have been
H28  20 most patient and co-operative in extremely trying circumstances, and
H28  21 our thanks are due to them and to all our staff, whether they be in
H28  22 the offices, the warehouse or the branches, for the helpful and
H28  23 understanding way in which they have worked with us during this
H28  24 difficult time.
H28  25 *<*6THE YEAR'S OPERATIONS*>
H28  26    |^*0The group profits for the year ended 30th April, 1961,
H28  27 amounted, before taxation, to *+463,512 compared with *+482,230 for
H28  28 1960. ^The 1960 accounts covered 53 weeks' trading so that the group
H28  29 profit for 1961 before taxation of *+463,512 is comparable with the
H28  30 *+461,848 estimated as earned in the 52 trading weeks in 1960.
H28  31    |^Although our turnover during the year has shown an increase, a
H28  32 large part of which was due to the opening of new branches, it has not
H28  33 enabled us to take the increased expenses in our stride as hitherto.
H28  34    |^Our subsidiary companies have had a rather disappointing year
H28  35 necessitating, in the case of the retail company, a number of changes
H28  36 which we hope will provide a more satisfactory result in the future.
H28  37    |^It will be recalled that *+45,000 was set aside in previous years
H28  38 towards the costs arising in connection with Bracknell. ^Completion
H28  39 having been delayed, we are carrying forward the sum of *+18,540.
H28  40    |^The increase in the rate of profits tax in the 1960 Budget has
H28  41 had full effect in the accounts to 30th April, 1961, and we are faced
H28  42 with a further increase from April, 1961. ^The latest increase does
H28  43 not seriously affect the charge in this year's accounts but will do so
H28  44 in the April, 1962, accounts.
H28  45    |^The Directors have decided to recommend a Final Dividend upon the
H28  46 Ordinary and *"B**" Ordinary shares of 15% (9\0d per share) less Tax
H28  47 making a total of 20% (1/- per share) less Tax paid for 1960 on the
H28  48 capital prior to the one for two scrip issue made in July, 1960.
H28  49    |^The heavy outlay in the temporary financing by the Company of the
H28  50 new building at Bracknell is reflected in the liquid situation in the
H28  51 balance sheet, the total expenditure to date being *+343,430.
H28  52 *<*6SUPPLIERS*>
H28  53    |^*0We again extend our thanks to our Suppliers for their friendly
H28  54 co-operation during the year. ^We would like them to know that they
H28  55 are always welcome to show their ranges as indeed are those
H28  56 manufacturers with whom we have not yet had the pleasure of doing
H28  57 business.
H28  58 *<*6DEVELOPMENT AND FUTURE PROSPECTS*>
H28  59    |^*0At 30th April, 1961, we were trading in 166 shops having opened
H28  60 19 during the year. ^With the heavy initial expenses involved in the
H28  61 opening of each new unit some time elapses before the full earning
H28  62 potential is realised. ^Immediate benefit has not been realised this
H28  63 year from the opening of these shops but we are confident that in due
H28  64 course they will be making their fair contribution to profits.
H28  65    |^I have always stressed the inadvisability of endeavouring to
H28  66 forecast the trends of turnover or of profits bearing in mind the
H28  67 uncertainties of the fashion trade. ^At the time of going to press, in
H28  68 view of the few weeks trading and the variation in the date of the
H28  69 Whitsuntide Holidays, it is not possible to determine any very
H28  70 definite trend of trading at the present time. ^We are taking every
H28  71 step to ensure that we command our full share of the available market
H28  72 and we expect considerable benefit to accrue from the re-organisation
H28  73 of our distribution system following the move to Bracknell.
H28  74    |^A new payroll tax, such as the Chancellor of the Exchequer
H28  75 proposes, could involve this Company in a substantial expense over
H28  76 which it had no control. ^If the maximum amount of 4/- per week per
H28  77 employee was imposed the cost in a full year could amount to *+20,000.
H28  78 ^We exercise the greatest possible economy in our staffing by the use
H28  79 of a part-time staff, and at present this tax appears to take no
H28  80 account of the difference between full time and part-time. ^This
H28  81 proposed tax seems to me to be very inequitable inasmuch as it imposes
H28  82 completely unfair burdens on those businesses who by their very nature
H28  83 must employ a relatively high number of staff to provide identical
H28  84 profits compared with other forms of business enterprise.
H28  85    |^In my last review I said that with the additional expenses
H28  86 arising from the move to Bracknell and the ever increasing operating
H28  87 costs, our progress, so far as the earnings of the business are
H28  88 concerned, might well slow down for a period of time. ^It is important
H28  89 that I should repeat these remarks. ^We do not minimise the problems
H28  90 which have to be faced but we have a young and energetic staff and now
H28  91 that the move is almost completed and we have the facilities
H28  92 available, we are determined to go ahead with the expansion necessary
H28  93 to absorb these extra expenses and to provide additional profits for
H28  94 the continued growth of the Company.
H28  95 *<*6{0W. E.} NORTON (HOLDINGS) \0LTD.*>
H28  96 *<*2CONTINUED EXPANSION*>
H28  97    |^*0The annual general meeting of {0W. E.} Norton (Machine Tools)
H28  98 \0Ltd., was held on July 10 in London, *2\0MR. {0W. E.} NORTON
H28  99 *0(the chairman) presiding.
H28 100    |^The following is his circulated statement:
H28 101    |^The results achieved by the Company for the period ended 31st
H28 102 March, 1961 reflect the continued progressive growth of the profits of
H28 103 the companies which are now its subsidiaries.
H28 104    |^The Group net profits (before taxation and Directors'
H28 105 remuneration) for the full year to 31st March 1961 show an increase of
H28 106 67% over the adjusted comparable profits for the preceding year.
H28 107    |^The final dividend of 7 1/2% for the period ended 31st March 1961
H28 108 compares with the forecast of 6 1/4% made when the Stock Exchange
H28 109 quotation was obtained on 23rd September, 1960.
H28 110    |^As already announced, the Directors forecast an interim dividend
H28 111 of 7 1/2% payable before 31st December 1961, in respect of the current
H28 112 year ending 31st March, 1962.
H28 113    |^The increased profits have come from a corresponding growth in
H28 114 purchases and sales. ^Continuous efforts are made to enlarge our share
H28 115 of the available business in new and secondhand Machine Tools, at home
H28 116 and abroad. ^The sales value of stock held on 31st March, 1961 in this
H28 117 country and overseas was more than three times the value of stock held
H28 118 on the corresponding date in 1960. ^Our current sales and earnings are
H28 119 well in advance of the results achieved during the same period last
H28 120 year.
H28 121    |^Provided no unforeseen changes occur in the trading pattern,
H28 122 either at home or abroad, I am confident that the Company will
H28 123 continue to make good progress. ^Machine Tools are a pre-requisite for
H28 124 the majority of the goods and services in demand by countries
H28 125 developing basic, primary and secondary industries, just as much as
H28 126 they are an essential to ensure a continuation of the rising standard
H28 127 of living proclaimed by Western Governments to be one of their main
H28 128 concerns.
H28 129    |^The industries which we supply are widely diversified and their
H28 130 needs require many years of specialised study and experience. ^To
H28 131 continue our expansion, we are conscious of the need to train suitable
H28 132 personnel to absorb the particular knowledge required for the
H28 133 efficient conduct of our business. ^We are fortunate, therefore, in
H28 134 having already a nucleus of most able young executives. ^Their loyalty
H28 135 and hard work have greatly contributed to the success of the Company.
H28 136    |^The report was adopted.
H28 137 *<*6ASSAM FRONTIER TEA*>
H28 138    |^*0The 73rd annual general meeting of The Assam Frontier Tea
H28 139 Company Limited will be held on August 2 in London.
H28 140    |^The following is an extract from the circulated statement of the
H28 141 chairman, *2SIR CHARLES MILES, {0O.B.E.}:
H28 142    |^*0The profit for the year ended 31st December, 1960, amounts to
H28 143 *+498,726, and after charging Depreciation of *+74,000, there is a
H28 144 balance of *+424,726, which compares with *+302,624 for the year 1959.
H28 145    |^Contrary to the experience of some Assam producers, your Company
H28 146 was not affected by the drought, and, with an increasing yield from
H28 147 the young tea areas, the crop was the highest so far secured in the
H28 148 Company's history, the yield from our Assam estates rising from 1,100
H28 149 \0lbs. to 1,204 \0lbs. per acre. ^Sales proceeds increased by over
H28 150 *+230,000 but against this there was a rise of approximately *+100,000
H28 151 in upkeep expenditure, largely due to the extra crop harvested.
H28 152    |^We recommend the payment of a final dividend of 7 per \0cent. on
H28 153 the Preferred Stock, making 10 per \0cent. for the year, and a
H28 154 dividend of 25 per \0cent. on the Ordinary Stock.
H28 155    |^With regard to the current year, our crop to the middle of June
H28 156 is 1,279,920 \0lbs., a decrease of 224,400 \0lbs. when compared with
H28 157 the same period last year. ^During the latter part of May and early in
H28 158 June the weather was unusually cold and wet, and growth was checked at
H28 159 a time when the quality teas of the year are made. ^Reports on our
H28 160 early manufacture, however, are satisfactory.
H28 161 *<*6LEWIS & PEAT, LIMITED*>
H28 162 *<*2YEAR OF CONSOLIDATION*>
H28 163    |^*0The 41st annual general meeting of Lewis & Peat, Limited will
H28 164 be held on August 2 in London.
H28 165    |^The following is an extract from the circulated statement of the
H28 166 chairman, *2\0MR. HERBERT BOYDEN:
H28 167    |^*0I would like to mention that, after the period of expansion of
H28 168 the group, your Board has in the last year concentrated mainly on the
H28 169 consolidation of the group's activities.
H28 170    |^As forecast, the trading profit of the group before charging
H28 171 taxation, amounting to *+231,279, shows a slight increase over the
H28 172 figure of *+214,396 for the previous year. ^After deducting taxation
H28 173 of *+114,220, and adjusting for the interests of outside shareholders
H28 174 in subsidiary companies and pre-acquisition profits of subsidiaries,
H28 175 there remains a balance of *+103,654. ^The total distribution to
H28 176 equity shareholders for the year is *+36,444, and is covered more than
H28 177 two and a half times by earnings.
H28 178    |^*4Commodity Interests: ^*0In addition to the diversification of
H28 179 the group's activities which has taken place in recent years, we have
H28 180 retained an interest in our traditional commodity business. ^Rubber,
H28 181 edible oils, oilseeds, oilcake, and spices as well as cocoa are still
H28 182 being dealt with through our subsidiary or associated companies. ^We
H28 183 have also retained our interest, through a subsidiary, in the natural
H28 184 fibre business where we have had a most successful year under
H28 185 comparatively difficult conditions.
H28 186    |^*4Far East: ^*0Lewis & Peat (Singapore) \0Ltd. have maintained
H28 187 their position in the Far Eastern market and have further strengthened
H28 188 their business by acquiring {0W. H.} Day & \0Co. \0Ltd. in May,
H28 189 1960.
H28 190    |^We have further widened our sphere of activities in the Far East
H28 191 by acquiring an investment in the leading sharebroking firm in Malaya
H28 192 and present indications are that this will prove a useful source of
H28 193 income to the group.
H28 194    |^*4West Africa: ^*0Our activities in this area have continued to
H28 195 grow. ^Our export business particularly continues to expand
H28 196 satisfactorily and I am of the opinion that there is a good market in
H28 197 these territories as their economies continue to develop.
H28 198    |^We have recently taken steps to participate in two industrial
H28 199 enterprises in Nigeria, which we believe will make a satisfactory
H28 200 contribution to the group results in course of time.

H29  21 without satisfying the normal conditions for entry.
H29  22 *<*2ADMISSION OF OVERSEAS STUDENTS*>
H29  23    |^*0Applications from overseas students must be accompanied by a
H29  24 statement from the appropriate Government Office or from the person or
H29  25 body which will be responsible for the applicant's maintenance,
H29  26 certifying that he will receive adequate financial support for the
H29  27 duration of his course. ^Applications will not be considered without
H29  28 such an assurance.
H29  29 *<*2SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS*>
H29  30    |^*0Applications of candidates from overseas will be considered
H29  31 only if they are submitted to the University either by the Students'
H29  32 Branch of the Colonial Office (2 Sanctuary Buildings, Great Smith

H29  46    |^*1The University Regulations are published on page 132.
H29  47 *<*2ENTRY FOR EXAMINATIONS*>
H29  48    |^*0All students must obtain the consent of the Dean of the Faculty
H29  49 concerned before entering for examinations, and must take the
H29  50 examinations at the time approved by the Dean. ^No student may
H29  51 postpone or withdraw registration or entry for any examination without
H29  52 the consent of the Dean.
H29  53    |^Students whose progress is considered by the Senate to be
H29  54 unsatisfactory may be required to withdraw from the University.
H29  55 ^Failure in an examination may be regarded as evidence of
H29  56 unsatisfactory progress.
H29  57    |^*1See also University Regulations, Section 3, page 133.
H29  58 *<*2RESIDENCE*>
H29  59    |^*0The University is in principle residential, in the sense that
H29  60 all full-time students for whom there is room are required to live in
H29  61 Halls of Residence.
H29  62    |^In view of the growth in numbers the accommodation in the Halls
H29  63 is, however, now insufficient to house all the students not living at
H29  64 home. ^Approximately half of the places in Hall are reserved for
H29  65 first-year students and a majority of the remaining places are
H29  66 allocated to second-year students. ^Forms of Application for Residence
H29  67 will be sent to all candidates to whom an offer of a place in the
H29  68 University is made.
H29  69    |^Students (other than those living at home) who are not offered
H29  70 accommodation in Hall must live in lodgings approved by the
H29  71 University. ^The allocation of first-year students to Halls is made by
H29  72 the Wardens and students who are required to reside in approved
H29  73 lodgings will be put in touch with the Warden of Lodgings.
H29  74    |^Students must take up residence in Hall or lodgings on the first
H29  75 day of each Term.
H29  76    |^A limited number of students in their second or third years who
H29  77 have previously been in lodgings are admitted to Hall. ^Applications
H29  78 should be made to the Warden.
H29  79 *<*2UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICE*>
H29  80    |^*0A comprehensive health service for students is provided under
H29  81 the direction of the University Medical Officer.
H29  82    |^All students are required to undergo a medical examination during
H29  83 the first session and at such times afterwards as the Medical Officer
H29  84 may advise. ^Students are also strongly advised to make use of the
H29  85 facilities available annually at the University for chest X-ray
H29  86 examination.
H29  87    |^All students, except those living locally and therefore
H29  88 registered with a local doctor, should re-register under the National
H29  89 Health Service arrangements with the University Medical Officer or
H29  90 with a local medical practitioner. ^Students in Hall should consult
H29  91 their Warden before re-registration. ^For purposes of re-registration
H29  92 students *4must *0bring with them to Hull their *1National Health
H29  93 Medical Card. ^(See also University Regulations, Section 5, page 134.)
H29  94    |^*0Sick students, where illness is likely to last more than 24
H29  95 hours, are admitted from Hall, and, when desirable, from lodgings to
H29  96 the Sick Bay, where they will be in the care of the Medical Officer
H29  97 and the Sister of the Sick Bay.

H29 107 *<GENERAL*>
H29 108    |^*0The University expects its students to conduct themselves at
H29 109 all times in an orderly manner creditable to the good name of the
H29 110 University. ^Regulations for the maintenance of good order and
H29 111 discipline are promulgated from time to time. ^It is the duty of all
H29 112 students to take notice of the Regulations and to know and observe
H29 113 them. ^Students on admission must sign a declaration that they will
H29 114 observe the Ordinances of the University and will conform to all such
H29 115 regulations as may from time to time be made for the maintenance of
H29 116 order in the University. ^Students must also make themselves
H29 117 conversant with the academic regulations in the University *1Calendar.
H29 118    |^*0Regulations relating to Halls of Residence, Lodgings and the
H29 119 University Library, have the same force as University Regulations and
H29 120 any breach of them may be dealt with as a breach of University
H29 121 discipline.
H29 122 *<*2UNIVERSITY TERMS*>
H29 123    |^*41. *0The official dates of University terms as published in the
H29 124 *1Calendar *0apply to all students. ^Students (other than new students
H29 125 at the opening of a session and research students) are required to
H29 126 arrive in Hull on the first day of term and, except with the special
H29 127 permission of the Dean of their Faculty, may not go down until the
H29 128 last day. ^The first and last days of term as published are regarded
H29 129 as travelling days on which no lectures or classes will be held. ^The
H29 130 residence of research students will be governed by the requirements of
H29 131 their Head of Department or Supervisor.
H29 132 **[BEGIN INDENTATION**]

H29 136 \6*1exeat *0form from the Dean's office.
H29 137    |^*1(b) Temporary Absence during Term (\6Absit): ^*0Leave of
H29 138 absence may be granted during University terms subject to departmental

H29 140 lodgings regulations. ^Leave for three successive nights will
H29 141 ordinarily be granted only if it includes a Saturday and Sunday.
H29 142    |^The power of granting temporary leave of absence during terms has
H29 143 been delegated by the Deans to Heads of Departments; students seeking
H29 144 such leave should first obtain an \6*1absit *0form from the Dean's

H29 164 consent is normally given only if the examination is for a
H29 165 professional qualification closely related to the student's course.
H29 166 ^Consent for entry to examinations is normally given when the Dean or
H29 167 his deputy signs the student's registration form at the beginning of
H29 168 session. ^Students must enter on their registration form particulars
H29 169 of any external examinations which they propose to take during the
H29 170 session. ^University examinations of any kind will in all cases take
H29 171 priority over any other examinations which a student wishes to take.
H29 172    |^Students absent from classes must report such absence within the
H29 173 first two days to the Warden in the case of students residing in Hall

H30   2 *<*6FAMILY GUIDE TO AUTUMN FOOTWEAR*>
H30   3 *<*1Exciting Colours*>
H30   4 *<New Toe Styles*>
H30   5    |^*6A *2PARTIAL *0retreat from the sharply-pointed Italian toe is
H30   6 indicated in the autumn footwear presentations. ^Taking a look
H30   7 recently at the collection from {0CWS} factories I noted a number of
H30   8 interesting models with the newer square toe.
H30   9    |^Another new style feature is the wine-glass or flared heel, which
H30  10 was shown teamed up with pointed, squared, and chisel toes.
H30  11    |^Colour is highly important in choosing autumn footwear. ^The
H30  12 autumn range of shades is almost bewildering, and there are some
H30  13 exciting new-comers, such as conker calf and charcoal, rocco and
H30  14 Russian violet.
H30  15    |^Quite a lot of attention has been paid by the designers to
H30  16 comfort as well as style in this collection exclusively created for
H30  17 Britain's Co-operative stores. ^I noted the *"bagged**" toplines and
H30  18 tailored ankle fittings, exemplified in a black calf shoe from Norwich
H30  19 which is also available in tan calf and mushroom.
H30  20    |^The comfort element is particularly marked in the Elizabeth shoe
H30  21 family, expressly designed for those of us whose feet are no longer
H30  22 youthful, but who nevertheless like to be fashionably shod. ^None of
H30  23 us could ask for a smarter number, for instance, than a black softie
H30  24 calf shoe with a cushioned heel sock, arch support, and elasticised
H30  25 forepart. ^It is offered also in charcoal.
H30  26    |
H30  27    |^For younger feet the famous Countrysider range brings in the
H30  28 casual. ^Gristle soles and chisel toes are features here, as in an
H30  29 attractive model in dark green and maize. ^These new Countrysiders,
H30  30 with their up-to-the-minute fashion features*- including the
H30  31 kidney-shaped toepiece*- are likely to retain their popularity with
H30  32 our teenagers.
H30  33    |^Fashion these days is as apparent in male footwear as in women's,
H30  34 and this collection offered both square and chisel toe in its
H30  35 stylings*- and here again colour is an essential fashion feature.
H30  36    |^Interesting to see our men breaking away from those traditional
H30  37 browns and blacks into more interesting shades*- as in one of the new
H30  38 Ardingtons shown in the rich dark brown which is going to be one of
H30  39 the autumn's most popular footwear shades for men.
H30  40    |
H30  41    |^As in the autumn clothes collections I have seen, the young
H30  42 folk's styles tend to be junior editions of their elders'. ^For the
H30  43 girls, toe styles run to both the medium pointed and the chisel, and
H30  44 the maids' casuals incorporate the kitten heel, bagged tops, and
H30  45 chisel toes.
H30  46    |^Similarly, the boys' shoes reveal the new toe shape in varying
H30  47 degrees, and one of the Leeds numbers shown me had a vamp decorated in
H30  48 Terylene braid. ^More modish still was a pointed-toe model with a
H30  49 highly masculine-looking buckle, and resin soled; and a rubber-soled
H30  50 casual in the latest styling, unlined, with elastic side insertions
H30  51 and smooth saddle running across the forepart.
H30  52    |^*4*- {0D.L.R.}
H30  53 *<*6BED-TIME LUXURY*>
H30  54    |^E*2IDERDOWNS *0are slippery objects, as restless nights are only
H30  55 too apt to prove. ^To keep you from being left in the cold by these
H30  56 unaccommodating articles the {0CWS} Pelaw Quilt Factory have
H30  57 introduced a new item into their range.
H30  58    |^In the past they have featured a large number of quilts with
H30  59 matching bedspreads. ^Now they are offering you the two in one, in the
H30  60 form of a quilt with matching valance attached. ^This is gusseted to
H30  61 ensure a snug fit over the pillows and the whole has the appearance of
H30  62 an eiderdown covering a bedspread.
H30  63    |^For sheer luxurious warmth in the middle of winter nothing could
H30  64 compare with another newcomer to the range, a continental style quilt.
H30  65 ^Filled with pure down, it is made in down-proof super cambric
H30  66 stitched into four panels.
H30  67    |^There is no danger of this slipping off the bed for it folds
H30  68 cosily around you as you turn.
H30  69    |^The price of about 14 guineas may appear high, but this quilt is
H30  70 designed to last a lifetime. ^You can choose from a colour range of
H30  71 rose, gold, green, blue, and beige, all piped with white.
H30  72    |^During the past two years washable quilts in man-made fibres have
H30  73 come to the fore. ^The Pelaw range includes printed nylons, Terylenes
H30  74 and Tricels, all with Tricel or Terylene fillings. ^These with their
H30  75 flower-scattered designs would add glamour to any bedroom.
H30  76    |^A dainty rose pattern is used for a printed Tricel quilt with
H30  77 frilled edge and plain Tricel back. ^This delightful model can be
H30  78 bought in rose, gold, blue, and lilac, and costs about *+5 7\0s. 6\0d.
H30  79    |
H30  80    |^*6A*2NOTHER *0pretty quilt with printed Terylene front and plain
H30  81 nylon frill and back sells for about *+6 12\0s. ^The colours available
H30  82 are rose, blue, gold, and cerise.
H30  83    |^The traditionally styled quilts are still highly popular, and are
H30  84 harder wearing than those made from man-made fibres. ^An attractive
H30  85 model in embroidered crepe with ruched centre and scalloped edge is
H30  86 made in dark rose, light rose, gold, green, blue, oyster, wine, and
H30  87 lavender. ^It has a feather filling and down-proof back and the price
H30  88 is about *+7 10\0s. 6\0d.
H30  89    |^A reversible quilt in rose, beige, green, blue, wine, or black,
H30  90 is extremely reasonably priced at *+3 16\0s. 6\0d. ^This
H30  91 feather-filled model is in down-proof cambric.
H30  92    |^All prices given are for double-bed size.
H30  93    |^Grandmothers-to-be should make a note to look at the pretty range
H30  94 of pram sets in nylon with Terylene fillings. ^These have delicate
H30  95 designs on the covers and plain matching pillow-cases. ^The prices
H30  96 range from about *+1 14\0s. 6\0d. to *+2, and the colours are pink,
H30  97 sky, ivory, and lemon.
H30  98 *<*6SHIRTS *5are his business*>
H30  99 *<*0says *2ROBERT PEMBERTON*>
H30 100    |^*6A*2RE *0you still wearing a shirt with separate collars and a
H30 101 closed front, \0Mr. Grundy? ^If you are you can count yourself as
H30 102 rather a *"square,**" as young Ron would put it in his jargon.
H30 103    |^In other words you are a little old-fashioned, because 90 out of
H30 104 every 100 males are wearing the collar-attached tunic shirt. ^The
H30 105 non-iron and drip-dry are also highly favoured nowadays. ^Where
H30 106 ironing is necessary the busy housewife finds it much easier to make a
H30 107 good job of pressing the open-front type of shirt.
H30 108    |^I was told this during an interesting chat I had with \0Mr. \0R.
H30 109 Hunt, who manages the {0CWS} Shirt, Pyjama, and Overall Group of
H30 110 five factories at Broughton, Pelaw, Cardiff, Sheffield, and Reading.
H30 111    |^*"Men are not as colour-conscious as women,**" \0Mr. Hunt told
H30 112 me, *"and they are inclined to be more conservative as they grow
H30 113 older. ^There is always a big demand for white, checks are called for
H30 114 quite a lot, especially by the younger men, and there is an indication
H30 115 of a return to stripes. ^Pastel shades have lost some of their
H30 116 popularity.**"
H30 117    |
H30 118    |^*6U*2NTIL *0I toured the Broughton factory I never realised how
H30 119 much research and planning goes into the making of a top-class shirt
H30 120 such as those made at the {0CWS}'s Broughton, Pelaw, and Cardiff
H30 121 factories.
H30 122    |^So many synthetic materials, such as nylons, Terylene, Acrilan,
H30 123 and rayon, are used in the manufacture of shirts that extra care has
H30 124 to be taken to ensure that the inter-linings and the sewing cotton
H30 125 shrink in the same ratio as the main fabric.
H30 126    |^*"In my long experience in the trade there have never been as
H30 127 many technical and scientific problems as there are today,**" said
H30 128 \0Mr. Hunt. ^*"In the production of drip-dry shirts the collar
H30 129 inter-linings are treated with a water repellant, and new types of
H30 130 inter-linings have had to be introduced for the shirts manufactured
H30 131 from man-made fibres.**"
H30 132    |^Everything is done methodically and thoroughly to get the best
H30 133 results. ^For instance, as many as 500 prototypes of the collar of the
H30 134 well-known Lestar shirt were produced, washed, and tested for wear
H30 135 until the near-perfect collar was discovered.
H30 136    |^And there is no resting on their laurels. ^While the Lestar shirt
H30 137 has been an outstanding success for some time, modifications are made
H30 138 when necessary to improve it and keep it right on top.
H30 139    |^No other manufacturer makes such a wide variety of shirts as the
H30 140 {0CWS}. ^Society shirts are made to please all types of wearer, from
H30 141 the artisan to the executive, and for all occasions.
H30 142    |^It doesn't matter either whether you are a giant or a dwarf, your
H30 143 Co-operative society can fit you out with a {0CWS} shirt. ^The
H30 144 Broughton was recently called upon for a shirt with a 22 1/2 \0in.
H30 145 collar and a 66 \0in. chest measurement.
H30 146    |
H30 147    |^*6A*2LL *0the latest machines and gadgets for doing the job
H30 148 speedily and efficiently can be found at the factories, and it is
H30 149 obvious, after seeing them at work in the bright and modern Broughton
H30 150 factory, that there are no more skilful operatives than the girls and
H30 151 men who make the popular Society shirts under their various brand
H30 152 names.
H30 153    |^In making two million garments a year 4,000 miles of cloth are
H30 154 used*- 70 per cent of it from {0CWS} mills. ^The factories require
H30 155 146,000 miles of sewing cotton, 13 million buttons, 12 million pins, 1
H30 156 1/2 million transparent bags, and 500,000 boxes.
H30 157 *<*5Not too old at 40*>
H30 158    |^*6O*2LD *0people are younger today! ^You have only to look around
H30 159 to realise that they have moved with the times just as much as the
H30 160 younger generation.
H30 161    |^Most middle-aged folk can well remember the days when their
H30 162 mothers and grandmothers dressed in sober hues, usually black. ^Life
H30 163 stopped at 50 and old age began. ^Old ladies walked with sticks and
H30 164 often wore veils. ^If they wore anything colourful it was confined to
H30 165 a touch of white round the collar.
H30 166    |^What a change since then! ^Grannies dress as brightly as their
H30 167 daughters these days, and a jolly good thing, too. ^Mothers look just
H30 168 as charming as their offspring and often nearly as young. ^Statistics,
H30 169 too, show that people are living longer. ^A brighter outlook on life
H30 170 plus, of course, many far-reaching advances in medicine, is partly
H30 171 responsible.
H30 172    |^But as older people keep younger so does the need for finding
H30 173 suitable occupations for them increase. ^There is nothing more
H30 174 frustrating than to feel unwanted. ^In this modern world with its full
H30 175 employment and, indeed, its clamour for more and more people to fill a
H30 176 wide variety of jobs, the older person has much to offer the
H30 177 community.
H30 178    |
H30 179    |^Although the advertisement columns of the papers sometimes admit
H30 180 this with their invitation *"age immaterial**" there is still in some
H30 181 quarters a reluctance to recognise that *"too old at forty**" is a
H30 182 very out-dated tag for these times. ^While people are fit and well the
H30 183 world has much use for them.
H30 184    |^That is why this month's *2HOME MAGAZINE *0includes an important
H30 185 article on the work of the Over Forty-Fives Association which, in the
H30 186 words of one of its officials, regards a man of 45 as *"a mere
H30 187 chicken**" and has found work for people as old as 80.
H30 188    |^It is an unfortunate aspect of the otherwise excellent pension
H30 189 arrangements which many firms offer today that they frequently do not
H30 190 allow for employment of older people. ^With everyone now enjoying a
H30 191 State pension when they reach the necessary age, it should not be
H30 192 impossible to find a solution to the problem of individual schemes.
H30 193    |
H30 194    |^Not only have older people much to offer, they find many benefits
H30 195 themselves in continuing to work, providing their health is good
H30 196 enough. ^The contact with younger people, the feeling that they are
H30 197 playing a part in the world around them, the interest their work can
H30 198 hold for them*- all are valuable aids to a complete and happy life.
H30 199 ^Those who are in a position to engage staff might well think of these
H30 200 factors when they next fill a position.
H30 201    |^Meanwhile *2HOME MAGAZINE *0offers you this month its usual rich
