E01 0010  2       Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his
E01 0010 11    training secretly either because his parents don't
E01 0020  6    want sonny-boy to "lift all those old barbell things"
E01 0030  5    because "you'll stunt your growth" **h or because childish
E01 0040  5    taunts from his schoolmates, like "Hey **h lookit Mr&
E01 0050  3    America **h whaddya gonna do with all those muscles
E01 0050 12    (of which he has none at the time)"?
E01 0060  8       After all, a guy's gotta have a little ego!
E01 0070  5       Therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about
E01 0080  5    an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to
E01 0090  2    train in secret **h has never heard one unkind word
E01 0090 12    from his parents **h and never has been taunted by
E01 0100  8    his schoolmates!
E01 0110  1       This happy, always smiling lad with the sunny disposition
E01 0110  9    is our new Junior Mr& Canada- Henri de Courcy.
E01 0120  7       Far from discouraging Henri, his parents urge him
E01 0130  6    on to greater and greater accomplishments. Instead
E01 0140  2    of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally
E01 0150  2    took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority,
E01 0160  1    Professor Roland Claude.
E01 0160  4       And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better
E01 0170  4    hands because "le professeur" knows his muscles from
E01 0180  2    the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down
E01 0180 11    to the tibialis anticus of the leg **h and better still,
E01 0190  9    he knows just what exercises work best for them and
E01 0200  7    what Weider principles to combine them with for fast,
E01 0210  5    fast muscle growth.
E01 0210  8       That's because the good professor teaches only Weider
E01 0220  6    methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which
E01 0230  4    is located at 1821 Mt& Royal East in Montreal. Undoubtedly
E01 0240  2    you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning
E01 0250  1    pupils (every pupil has a physique title of some kind
E01 0250 11    or other). There's Gaetan d'Amours who is our newest
E01 0260  8    Mr& Canada **h Jean-Paul Senesac, whose story appeared
E01 0270  8    here two issues ago **h Jack Boissoneault, who was
E01 0280  6    with us last month **h Charles Harve, who recently
E01 0290  3    won the "Most Muscular Man" subdivision award in the
E01 0300  3    Mr& Canada event **h and a host of others. Yesiree
E01 0300 13    **h the professor knows his muscles!
E01 0310  6       Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall
E01 0320  8    and weighed an astounding 72 pounds, and his greatest
E01 0330  4    desire was to pack on some weight. About that time
E01 0340  1    he began reading Mr& America and Muscle Builder and
E01 0350  2    he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight
E01 0350 12    gaining. Seeing so many illustrations and reading so
E01 0360  7    many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein,
E01 0370  7    those two wonder-working Weider food supplements, he
E01 0380  5    decided to try them and see what they could do for
E01 0390  4    him.
E01 0390  5       Well, sir **h they did real great! For in almost
E01 0400  3    less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight
E01 0400 13    was increasing rapidly. Of course he did some exercising
E01 0410  9    **h he's crazy about water skiing and swimming and
E01 0420  7    this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added
E01 0430  4    food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his
E01 0440  3    skinny frame.
E01 0440  5       Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming
E01 0450  1    and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them
E01 0450 11    very much. But he was totally dissatisfied with his
E01 0460  8    upper body. It was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical.
E01 0470  5    "A real 'nothing' torso", says Henri. "It never seemed
E01 0480  5    to widen **h it just got longer and longer".
E01 0490  1       That's when he went to Professor Claude. And at
E01 0500  1    once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just
E01 0500 12    how to correct it. In his gym the professor has some
E01 0510  9    of the most "knocked out" equipment since Vic Tanny.
E01 0520  4    Mr& Claude is a specialist in torso development and
E01 0530  2    he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-Pull
E01 0540  1    Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set
E01 0540 12    is a pressing or "pushing" movement which accents one
E01 0550  9    sector of a muscle group in a specific way, followed
E01 0560  9    by a "pulling" exercise which works the opposing sector
E01 0570  6    of the same muscle group.
E01 0570 11       So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous
E01 0580  9    "moon" bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull
E01 0590 10    Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm
E01 0600  7    Pullover (the "pull" part of the Push-Pull Super-Set)
E01 0610  5    which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly
E01 0620  2    affects the muscles of the upper back and chest **h
E01 0620 12    and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically
E01 0630  8    works on the chest to build those wide, Reeves-type
E01 0640  6    "gladiator" ~pecs, while stimulating the upper ~lats
E01 0650  4    and frontal deltoids.
E01 0650  7       As you can see, in this Push-Pull Super Set the
E01 0660  8    entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised
E01 0670  3    in alternate sectors by alternate exercises **h so
E01 0680  1    the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!
E01 0680 10       Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull
E01 0690  8    Super-Sets No& 1, the professor allows him about a
E01 0700  7    five-minute rest period before starting him on four
E01 0710  4    complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 2.
E01 0710 11       Super-Set No& 2 is made up of similar exercises,
E01 0720  9    but this time done with dumbbells, and using both "moon"
E01 0730  7    and flat benches. The "push" exercise of this Push-Pull
E01 0740  6    Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well
E01 0750  4    pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of
E01 0760  1    the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation.
E01 0760  9    You need the barbell variation to build width and mass
E01 0770  8    in the ~pecs **h the dumbbell variation develops a
E01 0780  4    most classically sculptured outline to the ~pecs.
E01 0790  1       The "pull" exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell
E01 0800  1    Bent-Arm Pullover. (Note how strongly the upper ~lats
E01 0820  4    and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because
E01 0830  2    of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell
E01 0830 12    variation affords).
E01 0840  2       In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the "push" exercise
E01 0850  2    is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars, while the "pull"
E01 0860  1    exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent
E01 0860 10    arms.
E01 0870  1       The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest
E01 0870 10    pectoral-ribcage
E01 0880  1    stretcher ever invented! This is true only if a very
E01 0880 11    wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible
E01 0890  9    stretch is achieved. You'll know when you've made the
E01 0900  8    greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will
E01 0910  5    touch! As you see, the professor has designed a piece
E01 0920  3    of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e
E01 0930  6    grip **h he has to; he just can't do anything about
E01 0930 17    it at all!
E01 0940  2       But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise
E01 0950  1    at all, because Henri de Courcy- the "happy" bodybuilder-
E01 0960  1    looks as though he were having the time of his life!
E01 0960 12       The last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed
E01 0970  6    program for Henri is a single exercise, done in individual
E01 0980  5    sets with a bit longer pause between sets. By this
E01 0990  4    time Henri's entire chest-back-~lat-shoulder area is
E01 1000  2    pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes
E01 1000 11    time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping
E01 1010  9    work. He has Henri do from four to six sets of the
E01 1020  8    Incline Bench Press (note the high incline). This gives
E01 1030  3    a wide flare to the ~pecs, causing them to flow dramatically
E01 1040  2    upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into
E01 1040  9    the serratus and ~lats.
E01 1050  4       This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests
E01 1060  3    **h that steel-edged "carved-out-of-solid rock" looks
E01 1070  1    of the great champions.
E01 1070  5       So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 1,
E01 1080  5    four of No& 2, four of No& 3 and four to six sets of
E01 1090  4    the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri de
E01 1090 14    Courcy has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping,
E01 1100  9    torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon.
E01 1120  1    @
E01 1120  2       Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size
E01 1120 10    alone **h rarer still is a Mr& America or Mr& Universe
E01 1130 10    of true Herculean build. The aspects of physical development
E01 1140  7    that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence
E01 1150  6    their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the
E01 1160  6    true champion- superior definition of the muscles.
E01 1170  1       Now good definition is one thing that all of us
E01 1170 11    can acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight
E01 1180 10    workouts. But contest definition- that dramatic muscular
E01 1190  7    separation of every muscle group that seems as though
E01 1200  7    it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel- is
E01 1210  2    something quite different. This comes not alone from
E01 1220  2    high-set, high-rep training, but from certain
E01 1220 10    definition-specialization
E01 1230  1    exercises which the champion selects for himself with
E01 1230  9    the knowledge of exactly what works best for him.
E01 1240  8       Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders
E01 1250  6    but less spectacularly for others. Because they are
E01 1260  4    "minority" exercises and have but a limited appeal
E01 1270  2    they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten.
E01 1270 12    Only when the newest Mr& America or Mr& Universe rediscovers
E01 1290  1    them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted
E01 1290 10    with them and once again see how effective they really
E01 1300  8    are.
E01 1300  9       The exercise I shall discuss in this- the first
E01 1310  7    of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization
E01 1320  3    of a particular body part- is the One Leg Lunge. Why
E01 1330  4    it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say
E01 1340  1    because it works perfectly for everyone, no matter
E01 1340  9    whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths!
E01 1350  7       It is the one exercise that drastically influences
E01 1360  4    the definition of the thighs at the hipline- that mark
E01 1370  5    of the champion that sets him apart from all other
E01 1380  1    bodybuilders **h a criterion of muscle "drama" that
E01 1380  9    is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike **h
E01 1390  7    the facet of muscular development that wins prizes.
E01 1400  4       Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is
E01 1410  3    quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters
E01 1410 11    which is easily understandable. The One Leg Lunge is
E01 1420  9    a split and all lifters practice this in their regular
E01 1430  8    workouts.
E01 1430  9       But for purely definition purposes- used in conjunction
E01 1440  7    with your regular Squatting, Leg Curling, Leg Extensor
E01 1450  6    programs- a heavy weight is not needed. Indeed, a lighter
E01 1460  6    weight works much better because a greater, more extensive
E01 1470  3    split can be performed. Used in several sets of high
E01 1480  2    reps once or twice each week it will not be long before
E01 1480 14    your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition
E01 1490  9    in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing
E01 1500  5    and twisting under the skin!
E01 1500 10       Really there is no reason why this fine exercise
E01 1510  9    should not find its way into your leg program at all
E01 1520  7    times, for the following suggestions show why it is
E01 1530  4    so effective:
E01 1530  6    _1._
E01 1530  7       It's a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise.
E01 1550  2    _2._
E01 1550  3       It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from
E01 1560  5    start to finish of each repetition.
E01 1560 11    _3._
E01 1560 12       It improves over-all balance and control for the
E01 1570  9    bodybuilder, and helps to make Squats more easily and
E01 1580  7    more correctly performed.
E01 1580 10    _4._
E01 1580 11       It increases flexibility of the legs.
E01 1590  6    _5._
E01 1590  7       It speeds muscle growth and power development even
E01 1600  5    for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg
E01 1610  5    is exercised separately, thus enabling a massive, concentrated
E01 1620  1    effort to be focused on each.
E01 1620  7       You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine
E01 1630  6    exercise and here's the way it's done:
E01 1640  2    _1._
E01 1640  3       Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their
E01 1650  1    height so that this will correspond to the height of
E01 1650 11    your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as
E01 1660 10    for a heavy Clean.
E01 1660 14    _2._
E01 1660 15       Place a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp
E01 1670  8    the bar (which will rest against the back of your neck);
E01 1680  8    extend your feet forward and backward until you are
E01 1690  5    in a deep leg split.
E01 1690 10       Now raise the weight by straightening your front
E01 1700  5    leg, without moving your feet. When the front knee
E01 1710  6    is straight and locked, allow it to bend again until
E01 1720  5    you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the
E01 1730  1    sides of the Power Stands.
E01 1730  6    _3._
E01 1730  7       After you have taken a breather, reverse the position
E01 1740  4    of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous
E01 1750  4    exercise is now to the rear, and the rear thigh now
E01 1760  4    to the front, and perform the same movement in the
E01 1770  3    same manner.
E01 1770  5       That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell. You should
E01 1780  3    have a couple of training partners to stand by when
E01 1780 13    you make your first experiments **h just for safety.
E01 1800  6    You should also begin this exercise with a very light
E01 1810  7    barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise.
E01 1820  5       Oh, you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first.
E01 1830  3    But don't worry. Before your first training experiment
E01 1840  1    has ended there will be a big improvement and almost
E01 1840 11    before you know it you'll be raising and lowering yourself
E01 1850  7    just like a veteran!
E01 1860  1       Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the
E01 1860 11    back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't
E01 1870  9    make some experiments with the bar held in front of
E01 1880  8    the neck. Squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters
E01 1890  4    would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations
E01 1900  2    providing that they remember to make alternate sets
E01 1900 10    with the left and right leg to the front.
E02 0010  1       THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bed of pansies I've seen was
E02 0010 10    in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day. Pansies are
E02 0020  9    supposed to like it cool, but those great velvety flowers
E02 0030  7    were healthy and perky in the glaring sun. I sought
E02 0040  4    out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce
E02 0050  1    such beauties in that weather. He seemed puzzled by
E02 0050 10    my question. "I just love them", he said.
E02 0060  7       The more I talked with him, the more convinced I
E02 0070  5    became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming.
E02 0080  2    Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.
E02 0090  1    He planted the pansy seeds himself, buying them from
E02 0090 10    a pansy specialist. These specialists, I learned, have
E02 0100  6    done a great deal of work to improve the size and health
E02 0110  6    of the plants and the resulting flowers. Their seeds
E02 0120  2    produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size
E02 0120 10    of the unimproved strains.
E02 0130  3       I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants.
E02 0140  2    Occasionally, when he had an unusual flower that he
E02 0140 11    wanted more of he did; but pansy seeds, he told me,
E02 0150 11    soon "run down". It's best to buy them fresh from a
E02 0160  8    dealer who is working to improve them.
E02 0170  1       His soil was "nothing special", just prairie land,
E02 0170  9    but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose,
E02 0180 10    spongy and brown-black. I fingered it and had the feeling
E02 0190  8    of adequacy that comes with the right texture, tilth
E02 0200  4    and body. It isn't easy to describe it, but every gardener
E02 0210  2    knows it when his fingers touch such soil.
E02 0210 10       Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies.
E02 0220  9    They germinate quickly, the tiny plants appearing in
E02 0230  5    a week, and grow along lustily. It doesn't really matter
E02 0240  3    which month of the year you sow them, but they germinate
E02 0250  1    best when they have a wide variation of temperature,
E02 0250 10    very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours.
E02 0260  8       I like to make a seedbed right in the open, though
E02 0270  6    many people start them successfully in cold frames.
E02 0280  2    Pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have
E02 0280 11    things rugged, with only moderate protection on the
E02 0290  8    coldest days. If you do use a cold frame be sure that
E02 0300  9    its ventilation is adequate.
E02 0310  1       For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little
E02 0310 12    sand added to encourage rooting. I dig it, rake it
E02 0320  8    smooth, sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog
E02 0330  5    spray. Then I cover the sowing with a board. This keeps
E02 0340  2    it cool and moist and protects it from birds. Ants
E02 0340 12    carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are
E02 0350 10    no ant hills nearby.
E02 0360  1       When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove
E02 0360 10    the board. A light, porous mulch applied now keeps
E02 0370  7    the roots cool and the soil soft during these early
E02 0380  4    days of growth. I like sawdust for this, or hay.
E02 0390  1       When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little
E02 0390 12    plants, it's time to set them out where they are to
E02 0400 10    remain. Every time you transplant a pansy you cause
E02 0410  5    its flowers to become smaller. The moral is: don't
E02 0420  2    transplant it any oftener than you must. As soon as
E02 0420 12    they are large enough to move, I put mine 9 inches
E02 0430 11    apart where they are to bloom. I put a little scoop
E02 0440  8    of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into
E02 0450  4    each hole with the plant. That encourages rooting,
E02 0450 12    and the better developed the roots, the larger and
E02 0460  9    more plentiful the flowers.
E02 0470  1       Pansies are gluttons. I doubt if it is possible
E02 0470 10    to overfeed them. I spade lots of compost into their
E02 0480  9    bed; lacking that, decayed manure spread over the bed
E02 0490  7    is fine. One year I simply set the plants in the remains
E02 0500  5    of a compost pile, to which a little sand had been
E02 0510  2    added, and I had the most beautiful pansies in my,
E02 0510 12    or any of my neighbors' experience. In addition to
E02 0520  6    the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water
E02 0530  5    every other week, diluted to the color of weak tea.
E02 0540  2    As a substitute for this, organic fertilizer dissolved
E02 0540 10    in water to half the strength in the directions, may
E02 0550  9    be used.
E02 0550 11       They need mulch. We put a light mulch over the seedlings;
E02 0560 11    now we must use a heavy one. Three inches of porous
E02 0570  8    material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and
E02 0580  5    the soil moist and cool.
E02 0580 10       When winter comes be ready with additional mulch.
E02 0590  6    I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops
E02 0600  6    of the plants show right after a good frost. That keeps
E02 0610  2    in the cold, retains moisture and prevents the heaving
E02 0610 11    of alternate freezing and thawing.
E02 0620  4       Don't miss the pansies that appear from time to
E02 0630  4    time through the winter. Whenever there is a thaw or
E02 0640  1    a few sunny days, you'll be likely to find a brave
E02 0640 12    little blossom or two. If those aren't enough for you,
E02 0650  8    why not grow some just for winter blooming? The pansies
E02 0660  4    I cherished most bloomed for me in February during
E02 0670  2    a particularly cold winter. I started the seed in a
E02 0670 12    flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold
E02 0680 12    frame. (An unheated greenhouse would have been better,
E02 0690  6    if I had had one.) The plants took zero nights in their
E02 0700  6    stride, with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass
E02 0710  3    to protect them. In response to the lengthening days
E02 0710 12    of February they budded, then bloomed their 4-inch
E02 0720  8    velvety flowers. That cold frame was my morale builder;
E02 0730  7    its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made
E02 0740  5    my spirits rise every time I looked at it. Like strawberries
E02 0750  2    in December, pansies are far more exciting in February
E02 0760  1    than in May. Try that late winter pickup when you are
E02 0760 12    so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't
E02 0770  9    take another day of it.
E02 0780  1       The day will come, in midsummer, when you find your
E02 0780 11    plants becoming "leggy", running to tall-growing foliage
E02 0790  7    at the expense of blossoms. Try pegging down each separate
E02 0800  6    branch to the earth, using a bobby pin to hold it there.
E02 0810  6    Pick the flowers, keep the soil dampened, and each
E02 0820  2    of the pegged-down branches will take root and become
E02 0820 12    a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the
E02 0830 11    season. As soon as an experimental tug assures you
E02 0840  4    that roots have taken over, cut it off from the mother
E02 0850  3    plant.
E02 0850  4       A second and also good practice is to shear off
E02 0860  2    the tops, leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf
E02 0860 13    or two on each branch. These cut-down plants will bud
E02 0870  8    and blossom in record time and will behave just as
E02 0880  6    they did in early spring. I like to shear half my plants
E02 0890  3    at a time, leaving one half of them to blossom while
E02 0890 14    the second half is getting started on its new round
E02 0900 10    of blooming.
E02 0910  1       Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to
E02 0910 11    stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed. Nature's
E02 0920  8    aim, different from ours, is to provide for the coming
E02 0930  6    generation. That done, her work is accomplished and
E02 0940  2    she ignores the plant.
E02 0940  6       Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for
E02 0950  5    your pansy seeds. Go to a reputable grower, preferably
E02 0960  1    a pansy specialist. It is no harder to raise big, healthy,
E02 0960 12    blooming plants than weak, sickly little things; in
E02 0970  8    fact it is easier. But you will never get better flowers
E02 0980  7    than the seed you grow.
E02 0990  1       Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks,
E02 0990 10    then their period of growth and bloom is over. That
E02 1000  8    is not true. If the plants are cared for and protected
E02 1010  4    over the winter, the second year is more prolific than
E02 1020  2    the first.
E02 1020  4       Would you like to grow exhibition pansies? Remove
E02 1030  2    about half the branches from each plant, leaving only
E02 1030 11    the strongest with the largest buds. The flowers will
E02 1040  8    be huge.
E02 1040 10       Pansies have character. They stick to their principles,
E02 1050  8    insist upon their due, but grow and bloom with dependable
E02 1060  8    regularity if given it. Treat them right and they'll
E02 1070  5    make a showing every month in the year except the frigid
E02 1080  3    ones. Give them food, some shade, mulch, water and
E02 1080 12    more food, and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.
E02 1090  1       A SALAD WITH greens and tomato is a popular and
E02 1100  8    wonderfully healthful addition to a meal, but add an
E02 1110  7    avocado and you have something really special. This
E02 1120  2    delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in
E02 1120 10    the past thirty years because modern transportation
E02 1130  6    methods have made it possible to ship avocado anywhere
E02 1140  5    in the United States. It has a great many assets to
E02 1150  4    recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part
E02 1160  1    of your diet yet, you really should.
E02 1160  8       You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit
E02 1170  6    you have ever tasted. It is roughly shaped like a large
E02 1180  4    pear, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin
E02 1180 13    covers a meaty, melon-like pulp that has about the
E02 1190 10    consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear, but oily. The
E02 1200  6    avocado should have a "give" to it, as you hold it,
E02 1210  5    when it is ripe. The flavor is neither sweet, like
E02 1220  1    a pear, nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather
E02 1220 13    bland, nut-like. It is a flavor that might take a little
E02 1230 10    getting used to- not because it is unpleasant, but
E02 1240  6    because the flavor is hard to define in the light of
E02 1250  4    our experience with other fruits. Sometimes it takes
E02 1250 12    several "eatings" of avocado to catch that delightful
E02 1260  8    quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout
E02 1270  9    the world. Once you become an avocado fan, you will
E02 1280  6    look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation.
E02 1290  3    #NATURALLY DORMANT AND NO SPRAY DANGER#
E02 1290  9    Today, refrigerated carriers have made the shipping
E02 1300  7    of avocados possible to any place in the world. The
E02 1310  8    fruit is allowed to mature on the tree, but it is still
E02 1320  5    firm at this point. It is brought to packing houses,
E02 1330  1    cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed
E02 1330 11    in protective excelsior. The fruit is then cooled to
E02 1340  8    42`F&, a temperature at which it lapses into a sort
E02 1350  6    of dormant state. This cooling does not change the
E02 1360  2    avocado in any way, it just delays the natural softening
E02 1360 12    of the fruit until a grovelike temperature (room temperature)
E02 1370  9    is restored. This happens on the grocer's shelf or
E02 1380  8    in your kitchen.
E02 1380 11       One of the most attractive things about avocados
E02 1390  8    is that they do not require processing of any kind.
E02 1400  5    There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed. If
E02 1410  3    the temperature is controlled properly, the avocado
E02 1410 10    will delay its ripening until needed. And unlike other
E02 1420  8    fruits, one cannot eat the skin of the avocado. It
E02 1430  7    is thick, much like an egg plant's skin, so that poison
E02 1440  4    sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the
E02 1450  1    consumer.
E02 1450  2    #NUTRITIOUS AND A CHOLESTEROL REDUCER#
E02 1450  7    Good taste and versatility, plus safety from spray
E02 1470  5    poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use
E02 1480  4    of such a fruit, even if its nutritional values were
E02 1490  1    limited. Avocados, however, are very rich in nutrients.
E02 1490  9    Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty
E02 1500  8    acids, so necessary for maintaining the good health
E02 1510  4    of the circulatory system. Aside from this, the average
E02 1520  3    portion contains some protein, an appreciable amount
E02 1520 10    of vitamins ~A and ~C- about one-tenth of the minimum
E02 1530 10    daily requirement, and about a third of the official
E02 1540  8    vitamin ~E requirement. The ~B vitamins are well represented,
E02 1550  6    especially thiamin and riboflavin. Calcium, phosphorus
E02 1560  3    and iron are present in worthwhile amounts, and eleven
E02 1570  3    other minerals also have been found in varying trace
E02 1570 12    amounts. None of these values is destroyed, not significantly
E02 1580  9    altered by refrigeration storage.
E02 1590  2       Dr& Wilson C& Grant, of the Veterans' Administration
E02 1600  2    Hospital, Coral Gables, Florida, and the University
E02 1610  1    of Miami School of Medicine, set out to discover if
E02 1610 11    avocados, because of their high content of unsaturated
E02 1620  8    fatty acids, would reduce the cholesterol of the blood
E02 1630  6    in selected patients. The study comprised 16 male patients,
E02 1640  4    ranging in age from 27 to 72. They were put on control
E02 1650  3    diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal
E02 1650 12    cholesterol level of their blood. Then they were given
E02 1660  9    1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part
E02 1670  8    of their dietary fat consumption.
E03 0010  1       FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, FIRE! The tremendous
E03 0010  9    energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can
E03 0020  8    be felt much better than it can be heard. The pulsating
E03 0030  7    vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach.
E03 0040  5       Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused
E03 0050  2    so much apprehension and fear. Nuclear weapons are
E03 0050 10    fearsome, but the long-range ballistic missile gives
E03 0060  8    them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much
E03 0070  5    more terrifying.
E03 0070  7       A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently
E03 0080  6    overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he
E03 0090  5    were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear
E03 0100  1    rockets. It is relatively easy to go a step further
E03 0100 11    and reason that an attacker, in possession of such
E03 0110  7    absolute power, would simultaneously destroy his opponent's
E03 0120  4    cities and people. With a nation defenseless before
E03 0130  2    it, why would the attacker spare the victim's people?
E03 0140  1    Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people
E03 0140  9    be the logical act of complete subjugation? The nation
E03 0150  7    would be utterly devastated. The will of its people,
E03 0160  6    so crucial in time of peril, would be broken.
E03 0170  1       Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for
E03 0170 10    self-destruction in hours or days; and now rockets
E03 0180  8    have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes.
E03 0190  6    At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities,
E03 0200  3    being "soft", and the people within them are ideally
E03 0210  1    suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.
E03 0210  7       However, because this vulnerability is mutual, it
E03 0220  6    is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the
E03 0230  4    opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent
E03 0240  1    has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal.
E03 0240  9    It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading
E03 0250  5    is not a profitable military tactic.
E03 0260  1       ~ICBMs have given us a capability which could be
E03 0260 10    used in two different ways. They could be used to attack
E03 0270 10    a nation's people (which would inevitably mean the
E03 0280  6    loss of the attacker's own people), or they could be
E03 0290  5    used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military
E03 0300  1    force.
E03 0300  2       If our national interest lies in being able to fight
E03 0310  2    and win a war rather than committing national suicide,
E03 0310 11    then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic
E03 0320  9    missiles. We must determine whether missiles can win
E03 0330  6    a war all by themselves. We must make certain that
E03 0340  3    the aircraft is finished before we give the entire
E03 0340 12    job to the missile.
E03 0350  4       Missiles are very valuable weapons, but they also
E03 0360  2    have their too little known limitations.
E03 0360  8       Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory, the
E03 0370  4    location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately.
E03 0380  4    Placing missiles in submarines, on barges, railroads,
E03 0390  1    highways, surface vessels and in the air provides them
E03 0390 10    with passive protection by taking advantage of the
E03 0400  8    gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today-
E03 0410  4    the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving
E03 0420  5    target with such weapons. One must first detect a fleeting
E03 0430  3    mobile or moving target, decide that it is worthy of
E03 0440  1    destruction, select the missile to be fired against
E03 0440  9    the target, compute ballistics for the flight, and
E03 0450  7    prepare the missile for firing.
E03 0460  2       Even if all these operations could be performed
E03 0460 10    instantaneously, the ~ICBM still has a time of flight
E03 0470  9    to the target of about 30 minutes. Therefore, if the
E03 0480  8    target can significantly change its location in something
E03 0490  5    less than 30 minutes, the probability of having destroyed
E03 0500  3    it is drastically lowered.
E03 0500  7       Because of this, it would appear inevitable that
E03 0510  6    an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will
E03 0520  3    seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile
E03 0530  1    defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high
E03 0530  9    kill probability.
E03 0540  1       In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving,
E03 0540  9    or imprecisely located strategic forces, we must have
E03 0550  7    a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles.
E03 0560  6    Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed
E03 0570  4    by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only
E03 0580  1    means available to us.
E03 0580  5       It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war
E03 0590  3    is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's
E03 0600  1    citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic
E03 0600 10    force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into
E03 0610  6    China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic
E03 0620  4    forces which continued to threaten us.
E03 0630  1       Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile
E03 0630 12    ~ICBM force. It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft
E03 0640  9    such as the ~B-52 or ~B-70 in hunter-killer operations
E03 0650  8    against Soviet railway-based missiles. If we stop thinking
E03 0660  6    in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons
E03 0670  3    and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons
E03 0670 10    which may be more appropriate for most important military
E03 0680  9    targets, it would seem that the ~B-52 or ~B-70 could
E03 0690 10    carry a great many small nuclear weapons.
E03 0700  3       An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons
E03 0710  1    could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress
E03 0710 10    all trains operating within a specified geographic
E03 0720  6    area of Russia- provided that we had used some of our
E03 0730  7    ~ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses before our
E03 0740  3    bombers got there. The aircraft could be used to destroy
E03 0750  1    other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets
E03 0750  8    as well as the known, fixed and hardened targets which
E03 0760  8    can also be destroyed by missile.
E03 0770  2       Why, then, aren't we planning a larger, more important
E03 0780  1    role for manned military aircraft? Is there any other
E03 0780 10    way to do the job?
E03 0790  3       Survivability of our strategic forces (Polaris,
E03 0800  1    mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan,
E03 0800  9    and airborne Skybolt) means that it will take some
E03 0810  8    time, perhaps weeks, to destroy a strategic force.
E03 0820  4    War, under these circumstances, cannot be one massive
E03 0830  2    exchange of nuclear devastation. Forces will survive
E03 0830  9    a surprise attack, and these forces will give depth,
E03 0840  8    or considerable duration, to the conflict.
E03 0850  4    ##
E03 0850  5    THE forces which survive the initial attack must be
E03 0860  3    found and destroyed. Even mobile forces must be found
E03 0860 12    and destroyed. But, how does one go about the job of
E03 0870 11    finding and destroying mobile forces? They are not
E03 0880  6    susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile.
E03 0890  4       Some day, many years in the future, true spacecraft
E03 0900  2    will be able to find and destroy mobile targets. But
E03 0900 12    until we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to
E03 0910  9    the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft.
E03 0920  5       However, the aircraft which we have today are tied
E03 0930  4    to large, "soft" airfields. Nuclear rockets can destroy
E03 0940  2    airfields with ease. Here then is our problem: aircraft
E03 0940 11    are vital to winning a war today because they can perform
E03 0950 11    those missions which a missile is totally incapable
E03 0960  7    of performing; but the airfield, on which the aircraft
E03 0970  5    is completely dependent, is doomed by the missile.
E03 0980  1    This makes today's aircraft a one-shot, or one mission,
E03 0980 11    weapon. Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use
E03 0990  9    them only once.
E03 1000  1       This is the point on which so many people have written
E03 1000 12    off the aircraft in favor of the missile. But remember
E03 1010  8    this- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to
E03 1020  5    nuclear rockets, it is the airfield. Eliminate the
E03 1030  3    vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have
E03 1040  2    essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range
E03 1040  9    ballistic missiles.
E03 1050  2       There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or
E03 1060  1    eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:
E03 1060  9       @ Put aircraft in "bomb-proof" hangars when they
E03 1070  8    are on the ground.
E03 1080  1       @ Build long-range aircraft which can take off from
E03 1080 11    small (3,000-foot) airfields with runways. If we could
E03 1090  7    use all the small airfields we have in this country,
E03 1100  6    we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor
E03 1110  4    of 10 or more.
E03 1110  8       @ Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range
E03 1120  4    military aircraft in the air for the majority of their
E03 1130  1    useful life.
E03 1130  3       @ Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines,
E03 1140  1    develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (~VTOL) long-range
E03 1150  1    military aircraft.
E03 1150  3       We have the technology today with which to build
E03 1160  2    aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200
E03 1160 10    ~psi. We could put a portion of our strategic bombers
E03 1170  9    in such shelters.
E03 1171  1       Large, long-range bombers can be developed which
E03 1180  8    would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot
E03 1190  7    runways, but they would require more powerful engines
E03 1200  2    than we have today. There is little enthusiasm for
E03 1200 11    spending money to develop more powerful engines because
E03 1210  8    of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been
E03 1220  6    made obsolete by the missile.
E03 1220 11       This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense
E03 1230  8    of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort
E03 1240  6    to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft. One seldom
E03 1250  3    hears the analogy "nuclear propulsion will do for the
E03 1260  2    aircraft what it has already done for the submarine".
E03 1270  1       If, for some reason such as economy, we are not
E03 1270 10    going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a
E03 1280  5    sense of national urgency, then we should turn our
E03 1290  3    effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight
E03 1290 13    ratio of 12 or 15 to one. With powerplants such as
E03 1300 11    these, vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft
E03 1310  5    could be built. For example, a 12-to-one engine would
E03 1320  3    power a supersonic ~VTOL fighter. With a 15-to-one
E03 1330  1    engine, a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds
E03 1330  8    could rise vertically. The reason that we are not going
E03 1340  9    ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines
E03 1350  7    is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars- and
E03 1360  4    you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are
E03 1370  2    obsolete.
E03 1370  3       When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields,
E03 1380  1    they are no longer vulnerable to ~ICBMs. If our ~SAC
E03 1390  1    bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise
E03 1390  9    missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or
E03 1400  6    long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia
E03 1410  5    again, and again, and again, those bombers would unquestionably
E03 1420  2    assure our military dominance.
E03 1420  6       We would have the means to seek out and destroy
E03 1430  8    the enemy's force- whether it were fixed or mobile.
E03 1440  5    With such a force of manned bombers we could bring
E03 1450  1    enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure
E03 1450 11    would be selective and extremely discriminating. No
E03 1460  6    need to kill an entire city and all its people because
E03 1470  6    we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively
E03 1480  3    disarm the enemy's military force.
E03 1480  8       Our first necessity, at the very outset of war,
E03 1490  8    is post-attack reconnaissance. In a few years we will
E03 1500  7    have ~SAMOS (semiautomatic missile observation system).
E03 1510  2    But in the case of moving targets, and targets which
E03 1520  1    have limited mobility, what will their location be
E03 1520  9    when it is time to destroy them? What targets have
E03 1530  6    we successfully knocked out? A ballistic missile cannot,
E03 1540  4    today, tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.
E03 1550  1    What targets still remain to be hit? These crucial
E03 1550 10    questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance.
E03 1560  8    ~SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds- and
E03 1570  9    to see in the dark.
E03 1580  1       Even if this is some day possible, there remains
E03 1580  9    the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas
E03 1590  9    target. If the target can change its position significantly
E03 1600  4    during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on
E03 1610  4    its way, the probability of the missile destroying
E03 1610 12    the target is drastically reduced.
E03 1620  4       Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack
E03 1630  5    reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably.
E03 1640  4    It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather
E03 1650  1    that post-attack reconnaissance. It could operate under
E03 1650  9    the clouds and perform infrared photography through
E03 1660  6    clouds and at night.
E03 1670  1       It would be even more valuable because that same
E03 1670  9    aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered-
E03 1680  6    no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from
E03 1690  7    the United States with the chance that the target,
E03 1700  3    if it were mobile, would be gone.
E03 1700 10       A large aircraft, such as the ~B-52 or ~B-70, could
E03 1710 10    carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons. Few
E03 1720  4    people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive
E03 1730  1    power will create 1,000 ~psi overpressure at 100 feet.
E03 1730 10    Or put another way, the hardest missile site planned
E03 1740  8    today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead
E03 1750  7    (1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki)
E03 1760  3    within 100 to 200 feet of the target!
E03 1770  1       It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces
E03 1770 10    the use of very large yield nuclear weapons.
E03 1780  4       Today we have side-looking radar which has such
E03 1790  3    high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows
E03 1790 11    individual buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate
E03 1800  6    spans of bridges, etc&. With these keen "eyes" and
E03 1810  6    small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy, military
E03 1820  2    forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage
E03 1830  1    to urban areas.
E03 1830  4       If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and
E03 1840  2    destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care
E03 1840 10    and precision, and if war comes in spite of our most
E03 1850 10    ardent desires for peace, our choice of alternatives
E03 1860  5    will be truly frightening.
E04 0010  1       THE LYRIC BEAUTIES of Schubert's Trout Quintet-
E04 0020  3    its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make
E04 0020 10    it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners.
E04 0030  9    But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers,
E04 0040  7    the work presents its problems. Since it requires only
E04 0050  5    five players, it would seem to fall into the category
E04 0060  2    of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass, an
E04 0060 13    instrument generally regarded as symphonic. Moreover,
E04 0070  6    the piece is written in five movements, rather than
E04 0080  6    the conventional four of most quintets, and this gives
E04 0090  4    the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.
E04 0090 11       The many and frequent performances of the Trout
E04 0100  8    serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing.
E04 0110  7    Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions, with the
E04 0120  3    contrabass given free rein. Other interpretations present
E04 0130  1    the music as an essentially intimate creation. In these
E04 0130 10    readings, the double bass is either kept discreetly
E04 0140  8    in the background, or it is dressed in clown's attire-
E04 0150  6    the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop. Recently
E04 0160  5    I was struck anew by the divergent approaches, when
E04 0170  2    in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened
E04 0170 12    to no fewer than ten different performances. The occasion
E04 0180  7    for this marathon: Angel's long-awaited reissue in
E04 0190  6    its "Great Recordings of the Century" series of the
E04 0200  5    Schnabel-Pro Arte version. Let me say at the outset
E04 0210  3    that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing
E04 0210 13    as it did on the first.
E04 0220  6       Whether considered alone or in relation to other
E04 0230  3    editions, ~COLH 40 is a document of prime importance.
E04 0240  1    Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart
E04 0250  1    players of all time, and any commentary of his on this
E04 0250 12    repertory is valuable. But Schnabel was a great teacher
E04 0260  7    in addition to being a great performer, and the fact
E04 0270  5    that four of the ten versions I listened to are by
E04 0280  3    Schnabel pupils (Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian
E04 0280 10    Aeschbacher, and Victor Babin) also sheds light on
E04 0290  8    the master's pedagogical skills. Certain pianistic
E04 0300  4    traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions,
E04 0310  2    most notably the "Schnabel trill" (which differs from
E04 0320  2    the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck
E04 0320 12    simultaneously). But the most impressive testimony
E04 0330  6    to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected
E04 0340  6    by the individuality which marks each student's approach
E04 0350  3    as distinctly his own.
E04 0350  7       Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity, his innate
E04 0360  6    rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous intensity all tend
E04 0370  4    to stamp his reading as a symphonic one. Yet no detail
E04 0380  2    was too small to receive attention from this master,
E04 0380 11    and as a result the playing here has humor, delicacy,
E04 0390  8    and radiant humanity. This is a serious-minded interpretation,
E04 0400  6    but it is never strait-laced. And although Schnabel's
E04 0410  3    pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously
E04 0420  1    faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase
E04 0420  8    indications. The piano performance on this Trout is
E04 0430  8    one that really demands a search for superlatives.
E04 0440  5       About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy.
E04 0450  5    I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate
E04 0460  2    with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic playing
E04 0470  2    was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative
E04 0470 11    outlook than the style of the Belgian group. From a
E04 0480 10    technical standpoint, the string playing is good, but
E04 0490  7    the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of
E04 0500  5    things here. The violinist, in particular, is very
E04 0510  1    indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched
E04 0510 11    and edgy. The twenty-five-year-old recording offers
E04 0520  8    rather faded string tone, but the balance between the
E04 0530  6    instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet.
E04 0540  2    There is a break in continuity just before the fourth
E04 0540 12    variation in the "Forellen" movement, and I suspect
E04 0550  8    that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides
E04 0560  7    of the original ~SPs.
E04 0570  1       Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's (London)
E04 0570  9    offers the most sophisticated keyboard work. Every
E04 0580  7    detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought
E04 0590  5    out, and of these I would especially cite the delicious
E04 0600  4    la^ndler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation
E04 0610  2    (an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese
E04 0620  1    musicians), and the gossamer shading throughout. Some
E04 0620  8    of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky, however.
E04 0630  7    Why, for example, does he favor two tempos, rather
E04 0640  4    than one, for the third movement? The assisting musicians
E04 0650  2    from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise,
E04 0660  1    but their contribution is rustic and appealing. (Special
E04 0660  9    compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp:
E04 0670  9    his scrawny, tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity
E04 0680  7    to the performance.)
E04 0690  1       The Glazer-Fine Arts edition (Concert-Disc) is a
E04 0690 10    model of lucidity and organization. It is, moreover,
E04 0700  6    a perfectly integrated ensemble effort. But having
E04 0710  4    lived with the disc for some time now, I find the performance
E04 0720  3    less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's
E04 0730  1    (whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet
E04 0730  8    has still to be recorded) and a good deal less filled
E04 0740  9    with humor than Curzon's. Aeschbacher's work is very
E04 0750  5    much akin to Schnabel's, but the sound on his Decca
E04 0760  4    disc is dated, and you will have a hard time locating
E04 0770  1    a copy of it.
E04 0770  5       The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet (Angel) and
E04 0780  2    Victor Babin-Festival Quartet (~RCA Victor) editions
E04 0790  1    give us superlative string playing (both in symphonic
E04 0790  9    style) crippled by unimaginative piano playing. (Babin
E04 0800  6    has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner, but
E04 0810  4    his playing is of limited insight.) Badura-Skoda-Vienna
E04 0820  1    Konzerthaus (Westminster) and Demus-Schubert Quartet
E04 0830  1    (Deutsche Grammophon) are both warm-toned, pleasantly
E04 0830  8    lyrical, but rather slack and tensionless. Helmut Roloff,
E04 0840  8    playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth
E04 0850  6    Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in much the same
E04 0860  4    vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists. Telefunken
E04 0870  1    has accorded him beautiful sound, and this bargain-priced
E04 0870 10    disc (it sells for $2.98) is worthy of consideration.
E04 0880  8       Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue, I
E04 0890  6    am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's
E04 0900  4    musical penetration. Here is truly a "Great Recording
E04 0910  1    of the Century", and its greatness is by no means diminished
E04 0920  1    by the fact that it is not quite perfect. This recording
E04 0920 12    surely belongs in everyone's collection. MUST records
E04 0940  3    always sound like records?
E04 0940  7       From the beginning of commercial recording, new
E04 0950  5    discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real
E04 0960  4    Thing have regularly been put in circulation. Seen
E04 0970  1    in perspective, many of these releases have a genuine
E04 0970 10    claim to be milestones. Although lacking absolute verisimilitude,
E04 0980  5    they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary
E04 0990  8    materials for re-creation of the original. On the basis
E04 1000  7    of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso
E04 1010  3    sang, appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal
E04 1020  1    under Karl Muck's baton, or sense the type of ensemble
E04 1020 11    Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic.
E04 1030 10       Since the concept of high fidelity became important
E04 1040  8    some dozen years ago, the claims of technical improvements
E04 1050  6    have multiplied tenfold. In many cases the revolutionary
E04 1060  4    production has offered no more than sensational effects:
E04 1070  2    the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning
E04 1080  1    as the gap between sound and substance became clearer.
E04 1080 10    Other innovations with better claims to musical interest
E04 1090  8    survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of
E04 1100  8    classics. If we return to them today, we have no difficulty
E04 1110  5    spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing.
E04 1120  3       Records sound like records because they provide
E04 1130  1    a different sort of experience than live music. This
E04 1130 10    difference is made up of many factors. Some of them
E04 1140  9    are obvious, such as the fact that we associate recorded
E04 1150  5    and live music with our reponses and behavior in different
E04 1160  3    types of environments and social settings. (Music often
E04 1170  1    sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit
E04 1170 12    in something more comfortable than a theatre seat.)
E04 1180  7    From the technical standpoint, records differ from
E04 1190  4    live music to the degree that they fail to convey the
E04 1200  2    true color, texture, complexity, range, intensity,
E04 1200  8    pulse, and pitch of the original. Any alteration of
E04 1210  7    one of these factors is distortion, although we generally
E04 1220  4    use that word only for effects so pronounced that they
E04 1230  3    can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard
E04 1230 12    tests. Yet it is the accumulation of distortion, the
E04 1240  9    fitting together of fractional bits until the total
E04 1250  6    reaches the threshold of our awareness, that makes
E04 1260  3    records sound like records. The sound may be good;
E04 1270  1    but if you know The Real Thing, you know that what
E04 1270 12    you are hearing is only a clever imitation.
E04 1280  6       Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to
E04 1290  5    make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather
E04 1300  1    than a copy of one. Like the recent Scheherazade from
E04 1300 11    London (HIGH FIDELITY, Sept& 1961), it is successful
E04 1310  8    because emphasis has been placed on good musical and
E04 1320  8    engineering practices rather than on creating sensational
E04 1330  4    effects. Because of this, only those with truly fine
E04 1340  3    equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree
E04 1340 12    of the engineers' triumph.
E04 1350  3       The easiest way to describe this release is to say
E04 1360  4    that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg
E04 1370  1    performance with minimal alteration of its musical
E04 1370  8    values. The engineering as such never obtrudes upon
E04 1380  6    your consciousness. The effect of the recording is
E04 1390  4    very open and natural, with the frequency emphasis
E04 1400  1    exactly what you would expect from a live performance.
E04 1400 10    This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not
E04 1410  8    only produces greater fidelity, but it eliminates listener
E04 1420  4    fatigue. A contributing factor is the perspective,
E04 1430  1    the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained.
E04 1430  8    The orchestra is far enough away from you that you
E04 1440  9    miss the bow scrapes, valve clicks, and other noises
E04 1450  5    incidental to playing. Yet you feel the orchestra is
E04 1460  2    near at hand, and the individual instruments have the
E04 1460 11    same firm presence associated with listening from a
E04 1470  7    good seat in an acoustically perfect hall. Command
E04 1480  4    has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation. The
E04 1490  2    music is always allowed the living space needed to
E04 1490 11    attain its full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes
E04 1500  8    as a quasi-performer. The timbre remains that of the
E04 1510  6    instruments unclouded by resonance.
E04 1520  1       All of this would be wasted, of course, if the performance
E04 1520 12    lacked authority and musical distinction. For me it
E04 1530  8    has more of both elements than the majority of its
E04 1540  6    competitors. Steinberg seems to have gone directly
E04 1550  2    back to the score, discounting tradition, and has built
E04 1550 11    his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully
E04 1560  9    as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper.
E04 1570  7       Those accustomed to broader, more romantic statements
E04 1580  4    of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when
E04 1590  3    they hear this one. Without losing the distinctive
E04 1590 11    undertow of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and
E04 1600  9    the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality
E04 1610  6    that makes for maximum cumulative effect. The Presto
E04 1620  3    ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken
E04 1630  2    literally and may shock you, as the real Allegro con
E04 1630 12    spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your
E04 1640 11    feet. In the end, however, the thing about this performance
E04 1650  6    that is most striking is the way it sings. Steinberg
E04 1660  4    obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element
E04 1670  1    which must dominate in this score, and he manages at
E04 1670 11    times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting
E04 1680  8    into song.
E04 1680 10       The engineering provides exactly the support needed
E04 1690  7    for such a result. Too many records seem to reduce
E04 1700  6    a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its
E04 1710  3    accompaniment. The Command technique invites you to
E04 1710 10    listen to the depth of the orchestration. Your ear
E04 1720  9    takes you into the ensemble, and you may well become
E04 1730  6    aware of instrumental details which previously were
E04 1740  2    apparent only in the score. It is this sort of experience
E04 1750  1    that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical
E04 1750 11    significance for the home music listener. The first
E04 1770  3    substantially complete stereo Giselle (and the only
E04 1770 10    one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided ~LP edition
E04 1780 10    of 1958 for Angel), this set is, I'm afraid, likely
E04 1790  8    to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment.
E04 1800  3    The already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve music
E04 1810  2    itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic
E04 1810  8    contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly,
E04 1820  7    if suave, sentimentality. And in its engineers' frantic
E04 1830  6    attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting
E04 1840  4    brilliance, the recording sounds as though it had been
E04 1850  4    "doctored for super-high fidelity". The home listener
E04 1860  1    is overpowered, all right, but the experience is a
E04 1860 10    far from pleasant one. As with the penultimate Giselle
E04 1870  7    release (Wolff's abridgment for ~RCA Victor) I find
E04 1880  6    the cleaner, less razor-edged monophonic version, for
E04 1890  3    all its lack of big-stage spaciousness, the more aurally
E04 1900  2    tolerable- but this may be the result of processing
E04 1900 11    defects in my ~SD copies.
E05 0010  1       At the Westminster ~KC Dog Show in Madison Square
E05 0010 10    Garden, New York on the second day, the Finals of the
E05 0020 11    Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition
E05 0030  7    in the history of this Class. The Class had entries
E05 0040  5    from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky.
E05 0050  4    This year several entries from Canada were entered
E05 0060  1    which made the Junior Class International.
E05 0060  7       Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries
E05 0070  8    were present. It was interesting to note that many
E05 0080  5    of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other
E05 0090  1    classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior
E05 0090 12    Class.
E05 0100  1       As has been the custom for the past several years,
E05 0100 11    John Cross, Jr&, Bench Show Chmn& of Westminster, arranged
E05 0110  8    for the Juniors' meeting before the Class, and invited
E05 0120  7    two speakers from the dog world to address them. Over
E05 0130  6    60 Juniors, parents and guests attended.
E05 0140  1    #MRS& WILLIAM H& LONG, JR& SPEAKS#
E05 0140  7    After the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for
E05 0150  6    qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class, Mrs&
E05 0160  4    William H& Long, Jr& was introduced as the first speaker.
E05 0170  4       In her opening remarks Mrs& Long also welcomed the
E05 0180  3    Juniors and stated, "There isn't any other show quite
E05 0190  1    like Westminster. I know because this is my 37th year
E05 0190 11    with hardly a break. Mrs& Long still feels the same
E05 0200  9    unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present
E05 0210  6    Juniors will experience today but probably will not
E05 0220  3    appreciate in full for a number of years.
E05 0220 11       Twenty years ago her daughter Betsey Long, then
E05 0230  8    13 years of age, won the Grand Challenge Trophy, Children's
E05 0240  5    Handling Class (as they were called then) at Westminster.
E05 0250  5    No sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs&
E05 0260  4    Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch& Cadet
E05 0270  3    or Noranda, another home-bred product, and won!
E05 0280  1       Speaking from long years of experience, Mrs& Long
E05 0280  9    advised the Juniors: "When showing dogs ceases to be
E05 0290  7    fun and excitement, STOP! Dogs have a way of sensing
E05 0300  8    our feelings! When you and your dog step into the Junior
E05 0310  7    ring, it should be just what the dog wants to do as
E05 0320  5    much as what you want him to do. If you walk into the
E05 0330  1    ring because it is fun to show your dog, he will feel
E05 0330 13    it and give you a good performance! He knows your signals,
E05 0340  8    what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted,
E05 0350  8    right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers".
E05 0360  4    #RIGHT ATTITUDE ESSENTIAL!#
E05 0360  7    "Take away your attitude", said Mrs& Long, "and what
E05 0370  9    have you left? Either a nervous dog because you are
E05 0380  8    livid with rage- a sure sign that you are taking things
E05 0390  6    too seriously and had better stop! Or a bored dog because
E05 0400  4    you are more interested in something else- maybe the
E05 0410  2    way you look, or the date you have after the Class,
E05 0410 13    or you are just doing this to please the parents.
E05 0420  7       "The reason you are in the ring today is to show
E05 0430  7    your ability to present to any judge the most attractive
E05 0440  2    picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids
E05 0440 13    can produce. Aids sounds more like a Pony Club, or
E05 0450 10    horsemanship classes- riding a horse and showing a
E05 0460  9    dog are very similar!
E05 0460 13       "Your aids are your attitude, which comes through
E05 0470  8    your voice, your hands and legs- voice to encourage,
E05 0480  6    discourage or whatever the need may be; hands to guide
E05 0490  5    or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of speed.
E05 0500  2    Without right attitude the other aids just do not work
E05 0500 12    right".
E05 0510  1       Mrs& Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class
E05 0510 11    and stated, "Have fun! And may you all continue to
E05 0520 10    show at Westminster in the years to come"!
E05 0530  6    #HARVEY BARCUS, SECOND SPEAKER#
E05 0530 10    The second speaker was Harvey Barcus, President of
E05 0540  8    the Dog Writers Ass'n of America.
E05 0550  4       Mr& Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships
E05 0560  2    for Juniors- with which he is very familiar. Last year
E05 0570  1    a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred
E05 0570 12    Racing Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000. He
E05 0580  8    gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy
E05 0590  9    he sponsored to win the scholarship.
E05 0600  1       "Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project
E05 0600  8    and should be earnestly encouraged"! is one of Mr&
E05 0610  9    Barcus' strong beliefs. He feels very forcibly that
E05 0620  7    the American Kennel Club should take a MORE ACTIVE
E05 0630  5    part in encouraging the Junior Division!
E05 0640  1       In closing, Mr& Barcus also wished all the Juniors
E05 0650  1    luck in their Class.
E05 0650  5    #WESTMINSTER SHOW NOTES#
E05 0650  8    Instead of 3 a&m& in the past, the Juniors Class at
E05 0660  8    Westminster was held at 4:45 p&m&. This gave the Juniors
E05 0670  6    the use of the entire ring at the show- a great advantage
E05 0680  4    to them!
E05 0680  6       Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward
E05 0690  5    announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs
E05 0700  3    around the ring and set them up, they could relax with
E05 0700 14    their dogs. From there on, each Junior was going to
E05 0710 10    be judged individually. This thoughtful gesture was
E05 0720  5    well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry
E05 0730  5    of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour, 45
E05 0740  2    minutes to judge the Class.
E05 0740  7    #ANNE HONE ROGERS JUDGES 28TH FINALS#
E05 0750  1    This year Anne Hone Rogers, outstanding Handler, judged
E05 0750  9    the Class. This is the third time in 28 years of Junior
E05 0760 12    Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has
E05 0770  7    judged the Class.
E05 0770 10       As the Juniors entered the ring, Mr& Spring, the
E05 0780  8    announcer, stated over the public-address system that
E05 0790  6    this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the
E05 0800  4    Finals of the Junior Competition. Juniors competed
E05 0810  1    last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel
E05 0810 10    Club recognized shows to be eligible to compete in
E05 0820  8    this Class- the Finals for the year. A Junior who won
E05 0830  8    two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible.
E05 0840  3       (The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition
E05 0850  1    is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen.
E05 0850 11    Many adults showing at Westminster today are products
E05 0860  8    of this Class.)
E05 0870  1       It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers
E05 0870 10    to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered. A
E05 0880  9    large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to
E05 0890  7    their credit and are seasoned campaigners.
E05 0900  1       After the judge moved all the dogs individually,
E05 0900  9    she selected several from the group and placed them
E05 0910  8    in the center of the ring. She then went over them
E05 0920  5    thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship.
E05 0930  1    #INTERNATIONAL CHAMPION OF THE YEAR#
E05 0930  6    BETTY LOU HAM, age 16, Holyoke, Mass&, showing an Irish
E05 0940  7    Setter, was chosen as International Champion of the
E05 0950  4    year. She was awarded the Professional Handlers' Ass'ns'
E05 0960  2    LEONARD BRUMBY, SR& Memorial Trophy (named for the
E05 0970  4    FOUNDER-ORIGINATOR of the Junior Classes.)
E05 0980  1       Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to
E05 0980 12    her credit last year. In addition to showing an Irish
E05 0990  9    Setter throughout the year, she also scored with an
E05 1000  6    Afghan.
E05 1000  7    #OTHER WINNERS#
E05 1000  9    SYDNEY LE BLANC, age 15, Staten Island, N&Y&, showing
E05 1010  8    a Doberman Pinscher, was 2nd.
E05 1020  3       SUSAN HACKMANN, age 14, from Baltimore, Md&, showing
E05 1030  3    a Dachshund, was 3rd. Last year Susan also placed 3rd
E05 1040  2    in the Finals at Westminster. From the records we keep-
E05 1050  1    Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior
E05 1050 12    Classes in both United States and Canada.
E05 1060  6       KAREN MARCMANN, age 16, Trapp, Penna&, showing a
E05 1070  5    Keeshond was 4th.
E05 1070  8       Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are
E05 1080  8    seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior
E05 1090  6    Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well.
E05 1100  2    #ENTRIES INCREASING- REQUIREMENTS RAISED#
E05 1100  6    In 1960, there were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes.
E05 1110  8    Each year these shows have increased in entries. Next
E05 1120  5    year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show Committee
E05 1130  2    has raised the requirements so that a JUNIOR MUST WIN
E05 1140  1    3 OR MORE JUNIOR CLASSES IN THE OPEN DIVISION ONLY
E05 1140 11    TO QUALIFY FOR WESTMINSTER.
E05 1150  1       PERCY ROBERTS, a leading judge will not be at the
E05 1160  3    International Show this year for the Junior Judging
E05 1160 11    Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia
E05 1170 10    in March.
E05 1170 12    #JUDGING CLASS FOR INTERMEDIATES PROPOSED#
E05 1180  5    It has been suggested many times that a Class be set
E05 1190  6    up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter
E05 1200  1    the Junior Classes. For some time this writer has been
E05 1200 11    suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates
E05 1210  7    over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible
E05 1220  6    to compete in the Junior Class.
E05 1230  1       Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester
E05 1230 11    ~KC Show recently. Not only were the contestants pleased
E05 1240  9    with the Class, but it aroused the interest of all
E05 1250  8    in attendance that day. The Intermediates in the Class
E05 1260  4    with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give
E05 1270  3    their reasons but their decisions did not affect the
E05 1270 12    choice of the Judge.
E05 1280  4       We suggested this Class in the horse world and it
E05 1290  2    was accepted immediately and included in the programs
E05 1290 10    of horse shows At the recent horse show convention
E05 1300  7    in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging
E05 1310  5    Class is meeting with great success and will be a great
E05 1320  6    help to future judges in the horse world.
E05 1330  1       This Class can be just as successful in the dog
E05 1330 11    world if it is given a chance. Last year Robert Harris,
E05 1340  7    a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog Judging Contest
E05 1350  5    (Junior) at the International ~KC of Chicago show and
E05 1360  5    had the highest score in judging of any Junior since
E05 1370  2    the Class' inception. Juniors who attend this Chicago
E05 1370 10    show should make a point to enter this Class as it
E05 1380 11    would be of great help to them.
E05 1390  3    #MORE VOLUNTEER HANDLERS NEEDED TO JUDGE#
E05 1390  9    Superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more
E05 1400  9    difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior
E05 1410  5    Showmanship Competition. The founder of the Junior
E05 1420  3    Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr&
E05 1430  1    (for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster)
E05 1430 10    was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should
E05 1440  7    have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting
E05 1450  6    with the Junior Showmanship Division.
E05 1460  1       Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities
E05 1460 10    who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's
E05 1470  9    ability to show a dog. To overcome this unfair judging,
E05 1480  5    the A&K&C& requires that a licensed Handler be present
E05 1490  4    to judge the Class. If the superintendents do not receive
E05 1500  4    more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested
E05 1510  1    that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this
E05 1510 10    Class. By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested
E05 1520  6    in the dog world, all will be helping to create future
E05 1530  6    dog owners.
E05 1530  8    #OTHER AWARDS FOR JUNIORS#
E05 1535  1    The Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry
E05 1540  8    Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration
E05 1550  7    donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with
E05 1560  8    their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any
E05 1570  3    Show. The Kansas City and the Topeka ~KCs are arranging
E05 1580  3    that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified
E05 1580 13    to win points for Westminster. The Rio Grande ~KC is
E05 1590 10    also considering having their Junior Classes set up
E05 1600  7    so that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster.
E05 1610  5       The American Pointer Club is still continuing to
E05 1620  5    donate a trophies to Juniors who win at Junior Showmanship
E05 1630  2    Classes with Pointers.
E05 1640  1       Traveling through the South- over 16,000 miles-
E05 1640  8    with two Great Danes, an Afghan, and a Persian kitten,
E05 1650  9    we've worked up a regular routine for acceptance at
E05 1660  6    motels.
E05 1660  7       My husband enters the motel office, signs up for
E05 1670  6    a room, and them solemnly asks the proprieter if he
E05 1680  3    accepts pets. "Puppies"? comes the suspicious question.
E05 1690  1    "No", he replies, "full grown, adult show dogs, housebroken,
E05 1700  1    and obedience-trained".
E05 1700  4       We've never been refused!
E05 1710  1       Once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in
E05 1710 10    an out of the way spot, keep them under control in
E05 1720  7    the room, and feed and bench them where they can't
E05 1730  3    do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.
E05 1740  1       In the morning we leave the room looking as neat
E05 1740 11    as a pin!
E05 1750  1       Many a motel owner- when we've stopped there again-
E05 1750 10    has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs
E05 1760  9    to most children.
E05 1770  1       So many times I have wondered why veterinarians
E05 1770  9    do not wipe the table clean before each new canine
E05 1780  7    patient is placed on it for examination. Is it that
E05 1790  4    they don't care? Are they indifferent to the fact that
E05 1800  3    the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding
E05 1800 13    patient?
E06 0010  1       AT ONE TIME, to most Americans, unless they were
E06 0010 10    fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water,
E06 0020 10    boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen,
E06 0030  6    rich people, and the United States Navy.
E06 0040  2       Today the recreational boating scene is awash with
E06 0040 10    heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth
E06 0050  7    of that sport. There are more than 8,000,000 recreational
E06 0060  6    boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000
E06 0070  4    the prediction for within the next decade. About 40,000,000
E06 0080  3    people participated in boating in 1960. Boating has
E06 0090  1    become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation
E06 0090 10    from sea to shining sea. Boats are operated in every
E06 0100  7    state in the Union, with the heaviest concentrations
E06 0110  2    along both coasts and in the Middle West.
E06 0120  1       The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly
E06 0120  9    evident, expectedly, in the areas where boats have
E06 0130  8    always been found: the natural lakes, rivers, and along
E06 0140  5    the nation's coastline. But during the last several
E06 0150  3    years boats were launched in areas where, a short time
E06 0160  1    ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering
E06 0160 13    troughs for livestock.
E06 0170  2       Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources
E06 0180  1    control program of the government, vast, man-made bodies
E06 0180 10    of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit,
E06 0190  7    providing boating and fishing havens all over the country.
E06 0200  6       No matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers
E06 0210  3    of the Southwest had been, for example, they could
E06 0220  1    never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile
E06 0220 10    Lake Texoma, located between Texas and Oklahoma, which
E06 0230  8    resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the
E06 0240  7    Red River. In 1959, according to the Engineers, Lake
E06 0250  5    Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes
E06 0260  2    and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over
E06 0260 11    1,000,000 persons.
E06 0270  2       Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been
E06 0280  1    created by bringing bodies of water to the people,
E06 0280 10    means have been found to take the people and their
E06 0290  7    boats to the water. Providing these means are about
E06 0300  4    ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000
E06 0310  1    boat trailers now in use. It is a simple task to haul
E06 0310 13    a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir
E06 0320 10    on the new, light, strong, easy-to-operate trailers
E06 0330  5    which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small
E06 0340  4    boat and retail from $100 to $2,000. The sight of sleek
E06 0360  1    inboards, outboards, and sailboats being wheeled smartly
E06 0360  8    along highways many miles from any water is commonplace.
E06 0370  8       Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year
E06 0380  6    'round anchorage for their craft, will recall the tedious
E06 0390  5    procedure of loading their gear into the car, driving
E06 0391  2    to the water, and making trip after trip to transfer
E06 0400  8    the gear to the boat. Today, the boat, on its trailer,
E06 0410  9    is brought to the gear and loaded at the door. Arriving
E06 0420  6    at the waterside, the boat is launched, the family
E06 0430  3    taken aboard and, that easily, another day afloat is
E06 0430 12    begun.
E06 0440  1       And trailers for boats are not what they started
E06 0440 10    out to be ten years ago. This year, Americans will
E06 0450  8    discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers
E06 0460  5    that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our
E06 0470  3    nation's national, regional and local boat shows. The
E06 0470 11    boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be
E06 0480  9    coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons.
E06 0490  7       The variety of craft on the country's waters today
E06 0500  4    is overwhelming. They range from an eight-foot pram,
E06 0510  2    which you can build yourself for less than $50, to
E06 0510 12    auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000. Boat
E06 0520  8    prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs.
E06 0530  6    In this respect, boats can be compared with houses.
E06 0540  3    There is no limit to what you can spend, yet it is
E06 0540 15    easily possible to keep within a set budget. There
E06 0550  9    is no question as to just what is available. You name
E06 0560  7    it, our industry is producing it, and it probably is
E06 0570  4    made in different models.
E06 0570  8       There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected
E06 0580  5    waters or for camping trips. There are houseboats which
E06 0590  3    are literally homes afloat, accommodating whole families
E06 0600  1    in comfort and convenience. You can cross an ocean
E06 0600 10    in a fully equipped craft, sail, power, or both, or
E06 0610  7    laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond.
E06 0620  6       You may have your boat of wood, canvas, plywood,
E06 0630  2    plastic, or metal. You may order utility models, inboard
E06 0630 11    or outboard, with or without toilets, galleys, and
E06 0640  8    bunks. You may dress it up with any number of accessories
E06 0650  8    or keep it as simple as you choose.
E06 0660  1       Designers and manufacturers have produced models
E06 0660  7    for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version
E06 0670  9    of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than
E06 0680  7    five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around
E06 0690  3    the block, to the sportiest boatman who insists on
E06 0690 12    all the dash, color, flair and speed possible to encompass
E06 0700 10    in a single boat. You pay your money and you take your
E06 0710  9    choice.
E06 0710 10       American technology in engine and hull design is
E06 0720  7    largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American
E06 0730  4    boating. I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the
E06 0740  4    point that when it comes to boats and their motors,
E06 0740 14    Americans excel over any country in the world in the
E06 0760 10    long run.
E06 0760 12       Russia, whose technology is not quite primitive,
E06 0770  7    is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving
E06 0780  6    the outboard motor, for instance.
E06 0790  1       Now here is truly a marvel. The outboard engine
E06 0790  9    of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower,
E06 0800  7    unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in
E06 0810  4    quantity production. These engines can be removed from
E06 0820  2    a boat with relative ease, wherein lies their greatest
E06 0820 11    advantage. Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the
E06 0830 10    American pocketbook, the range being about $150 to
E06 0840  6    $1,000, depending on size.
E06 0840 10       Great thought has been given to making life easier
E06 0860  8    for the growing boating population of the country;
E06 0870  4    and to making the owning of a boat simpler. There was
E06 0880  2    a time when, if a man wanted to purchase a boat, it
E06 0880 14    was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable
E06 0890 10    amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or
E06 0900  6    wheel. Having a boat financed through a local bank
E06 0910  2    is done much the same way as an automobile loan is
E06 0910 13    extended. Marine dealers and even some manufacturers
E06 0920  7    who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling
E06 0930  5    you to launch now and pay later.
E06 0940  1       Terms range from one to five years and the interest
E06 0940 11    rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles.
E06 0950  9    Of course, individual financing arrangements depend
E06 0960  4    a good deal on the purchaser's earning power, credit
E06 0970  3    rating and local bank policy.
E06 0970  8       Outboard motors, insurance, and boat repairs may
E06 0980  6    also be financed in the same way as boats. Terms and
E06 0990  4    rates of interest for motors generally follow those
E06 1000  1    for home appliances.
E06 1000  4       When the automobile was in its embryonic stage,
E06 1010  2    such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with
E06 1010 12    the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly
E06 1020  8    terrified being about the only rule governing where,
E06 1030  6    when and how fast a car could go. When air travel was
E06 1040  4    in its infancy, the sky was considered big enough and
E06 1050  1    high enough for all. Man had enough to worry about
E06 1050 11    managing to get up there and stay without being burdened
E06 1060  8    with rules once aloft. It was much the same with pleasure
E06 1070  6    boating at first. Come one, come all, the water's fine!
E06 1080  3       As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the
E06 1090  3    airplane are long since relegated to the past, so is
E06 1090 13    the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and
E06 1100  8    may not do; must and should do. However, there is a
E06 1110  6    minimum of legislative restriction on boating.
E06 1120  1       Laws on boating vary according to the state in which
E06 1120 11    the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower.
E06 1130 11    What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly
E06 1140  7    prohibited across the boundary line. The main requirement
E06 1150  4    is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the
E06 1160  3    regulations of the state in which the boat will be
E06 1160 13    principally used. If your state has no provisions for
E06 1170  9    the numbering of pleasure boats, you must apply for
E06 1180  6    a number from the U&S& Coast Guard for any kind of
E06 1190  4    boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than
E06 1190 12    10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways.
E06 1200  9       State numbering laws differ from each other in many
E06 1210  8    ways. Fees are not the same and some states do not
E06 1230  6    require certain craft, such as sailboats with no power,
E06 1240  3    to be registered at all. Many states have laws regulating
E06 1250  1    the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions
E06 1250 10    regarding the age of motor boat operators.
E06 1260  5       Generally, states reserve for communities the right
E06 1270  3    to have local ordinances regulating speed and other
E06 1270 11    activities. It is always wise to consult your marine
E06 1280  9    dealer, local yacht or boat club secretary, or local
E06 1290  7    law enforcement officers if you are not positive what
E06 1300  4    the regulations are. Ignorance of the law is no better
E06 1310  1    excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability
E06 1310 13    and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy.
E06 1320  9       Hand in hand with the legislative program is the
E06 1330  6    industry's self originated and directed safety program.
E06 1340  3    Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the
E06 1350  1    rapid growth of the sport, the industry has been supporting
E06 1350 11    an intense, coordinated educational program with great
E06 1360  6    success since 1947.
E06 1370  1       A primary factor in the success of the safety program
E06 1370 11    has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual
E06 1380  6    manufacturers. The industry has been its own watch
E06 1390  6    dog. With U&S& Coast Guard cooperation, the American
E06 1400  3    Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended
E06 1410  1    practices and standards for boats and their equipment
E06 1410  9    with reference to safety.
E06 1420  3       Industry interest in safety goes even farther. In
E06 1430  2    1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the
E06 1430 11    National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers
E06 1440  7    and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a
E06 1450  5    testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and
E06 1460  4    their equipment. A new waterfront site for the bureau
E06 1470  1    is now being built at Atlantic City, New Jersey, to
E06 1470 11    provide the most modern marine testing facilities as
E06 1480  7    a further tool to keep the sport safe.
E06 1490  3       In addition to these activities, the ~NAEBM, with
E06 1500  2    headquarters at 420 lexington Avenue, New York City,
E06 1500 10    as well as other associations and individual manufacturers,
E06 1510  7    provide and distribute films, booklets, and public
E06 1520  5    services in regard to proper boat handling and safety
E06 1530  3    afloat.
E06 1530  4       It is important to note the work of the United States
E06 1540  4    Power Squadrons and the U&S& Coast Guard Auxiliary.
E06 1550  2    Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes
E06 1550 11    in seamanship piloting and small boat handling. These
E06 1560  8    are not governmentally subsidized organizations. This
E06 1580  4    year, over 100,000 persons will receive this free instruction.
E06 1590  5       As America on wheels was responsible for an industry
E06 1600  4    of motor courts, motels, and drive-in establishments
E06 1610  1    where you can dine, see a movie, shop, or make a bank
E06 1610 13    deposit, the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts
E06 1620  8    have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate
E06 1630  5    them. Instead of motels, for the boatman there are
E06 1640  5    marinas.
E06 1640  6       The word marina was coined by ~NAEBM originally
E06 1650  3    to describe a waterfront facility where recreational
E06 1660  1    boats could find protection and basic needs to lay
E06 1660 10    over in relative comfort. Currently, marina is used
E06 1670  6    to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility
E06 1680  4    where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome or all
E06 1690  3    of the following available: gasoline, fresh water,
E06 1690 10    electricity, telephone service, ice, repair facilities,
E06 1700  6    restaurants, sleeping accommodations, a general store,
E06 1710  5    and a grocery store.
E06 1710  9       Yachtel, a relatively new word, indicates a waterfront
E06 1720  8    type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight
E06 1730  8    accommodations on the premises as well as other services.
E06 1740  6    Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel. It indicates
E06 1750  3    the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically
E06 1760  1    to establishments designed to cater to smaller type
E06 1760  9    boats such as outboards. Regardless of nomenclature,
E06 1770  5    yachtels and boatels are marinas.
E06 1780  1       Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities
E06 1790  1    may rightfully be called marinas.
E06 1790  6       A recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000
E06 1800  4    commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards
E06 1810  2    in the United States, the majority of which are equipped
E06 1820  1    to handle outboard boats.
E07 0010  1    THE design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much
E07 0010 10    like a mechanical puzzle, but once understood, the
E07 0020  6    principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement.
E07 0030  6    In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with
E07 0040  4    each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous
E07 0050  1    moves. The main set of bars are the "tappets" and one
E07 0050 12    tappet is connected to each lever. If the lever is
E07 0060 10    pulled to clear a signal or move a switch, the tappet
E07 0070  7    moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time.
E07 0080  4       Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking
E07 0090  1    bars. These can also move a short distance but at right
E07 0090 12    angles to the tappets. The number of locking bars required
E07 0100 10    depends on how many false moves must be prevented.
E07 0110  6       In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping
E07 0120  5    sides, and connection between the tappets and locking
E07 0130  2    bars consist of cams called "dogs". Two or more dogs
E07 0130 12    are mounted on each locking bar. These slide into and
E07 0140 10    out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are
E07 0150  8    moved, locking and unlocking them.
E07 0160  1       Here's how the scheme works: Suppose the operator
E07 0160  9    pulls the lever to clear a particular signal. This
E07 0170  9    also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever
E07 0180  5    and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side,
E07 0190  4    thus moving one or more locking bars. The dogs on the
E07 0200  1    other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into
E07 0200 11    notches in other tappets. By this scheme, pulling one
E07 0210  7    signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal
E07 0220  5    levers in safe positions until the first signal is
E07 0230  2    again restored to normal.
E07 0230  6       Interlocking signals are normally at stop or "red"
E07 0240  5    position, and a lever must be pulled to "clear" the
E07 0250  2    signal. This is not necessarily to green, however,
E07 0250 10    for in some situations only a yellow indication is
E07 0260  8    given to a train to let it into the "plant".
E07 0270  4       There are other basic rules. A turnout may have
E07 0280  3    two levers, one to actually move the switch points,
E07 0280 12    the other to lock the points. A signal cannot be cleared
E07 0290 10    until all the related turnouts are properly thrown
E07 0300  5    and locked. Such locks are nearly always used where
E07 0310  4    the switch points "face" oncoming traffic. The lock
E07 0320  2    insures that the points are thrown all the way with
E07 0320 12    no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly
E07 0330  9    thrown point. If the points aren't thrown all the way,
E07 0340  5    the turnout cannot be locked, and in turn, the signal
E07 0350  3    cannot be cleared. Generally, these locks on turnouts
E07 0350 11    are called "facing point locks".
E07 0360  5       Figs& 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and
E07 0370  4    signals. Each diagram is accompanied by a "dog chart",
E07 0380  2    a list of the levers that show which other levers any
E07 0380 13    particular lever will lock if pulled. The lines connecting
E07 0390  9    the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at
E07 0400  7    right angles to the tappet bars.
E07 0410  1       By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note
E07 0410  9    several other details. Derails- mechanical track devices
E07 0420  7    that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train
E07 0430  9    passes a "stop" signal- are used in many instances.
E07 0440  5    "Home" signals have two blades. The blacked-in blades
E07 0450  2    indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move. As
E07 0460  1    an engineer approaches the plant the position of the
E07 0460 10    home signal is seen in advance when he passes the "distant"
E07 0470 10    signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking
E07 0480  7    plant. In some low-speed situations, the distant signal
E07 0490  4    is fixed at caution. In other instances where there
E07 0500  2    is no automatic block signaling, the distant has only
E07 0500 11    green and yellow aspects.
E07 0510  4       So much for the prototype.
E07 0510  9       The interlocking frame we built at the MODEL RAILROADER
E07 0520  8    workshop and then installed on Paul Larson's railroad
E07 0530  6    follows the Fig& 1 scheme and is shown beginning in
E07 0540  6    Fig& 7, page 65, and in the photos. Here's how it can
E07 0550  4    be built.
E07 0550  6    #FRAME#
E07 0550  7    The sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame
E07 0560  5    are shown in the notes within Fig& 7, most of the bars
E07 0570  4    being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths. You may
E07 0580  3    change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer
E07 0580 14    levers and locks as you wish. Our instructions assume
E07 0590  9    you are building this particular frame, which is for
E07 0600  7    a junction.
E07 0600  9       When cutting the pieces, dress the ends smooth,
E07 0610  7    and square with a smooth file or sanding disk. Start
E07 0620  3    with the right-hand piece "~B", **f, soldering it to
E07 0630  3    the lower piece "~A" of the same material but 12''
E07 0640  1    long. Let exactly 1'' of "~A" extend beyond "~B" and
E07 0650  1    use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.
E07 0650 12       Now lay 12 pieces of **f cut 5-3/4'' long side by
E07 0660 12    side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material
E07 0670  8    1/2'' sq&. This gives you the spacing for locating
E07 0680  4    the left-hand piece "~B". Compress the assembly when
E07 0690  2    you make the mark to show the location for "~B". Solder
E07 0700  1    this second "~B" to "~A" at right angles. There should
E07 0710  2    be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should
E07 0710 12    be 1'' from an end of the long piece.
E07 0720  9       Cap this assembly (with spacing bars in place) with
E07 0730  6    a **f bar. Tack-solder all the 1/2'' sq& pieces to
E07 0740  4    the 10'' and 12'' members. These will be drilled and
E07 0750  2    tapped later on.
E07 0750  5       Now cut five **f locking bar spacers (which run
E07 0760  3    horizontally). Position these using six intermediate
E07 0760  9    temporary **f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar
E07 0770  9    "~A". Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to
E07 0780  9    the frame. Now place 12 pieces 1/2'' sq& on this edge
E07 0790  6    as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4'' long
E07 0800  5    "tappets", as they are called. Cap with a **f bar and
E07 0810  3    tack-solder in place. Cap the locking bar spacers with
E07 0810 13    two **f directly under the first two "~B" pieces. Remove
E07 0820 10    all the loose spacing bars.
E07 0830  4       Mark and center-punch all the holes required for
E07 0840  2    screws to hold this assembly together. See Fig& 7.
E07 0840 11    Placement of these holes is not critical, but they
E07 0850  9    should be located so that the centers are about 1/8''
E07 0860  6    from any edge. Drill all No& 50 and counter-drill all
E07 0870  4    except the "~A" pieces size 43. Tap the "~A" pieces
E07 0880  2    2-56.
E07 0880  4       Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for
E07 0890  3    the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars ("~A" and
E07 0900  2    "~B" pieces), which are soldered together. Either lay
E07 0910  1    the components aside in proper order or code them with
E07 0910 11    numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their
E07 0920  8    proper positions. Dress all surfaces with a file, cleaning
E07 0930  5    off all solder and drilling burrs.
E07 0940  1       Drill 20 No& 47 holes in the upper piece "~A" as
E07 0940 12    shown in Fig& 7. Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical
E07 0950 11    contact later on. Note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require
E07 0960 10    holes for contacts.
E07 0970  1       Now reassemble the frame, using **f roundhead steel
E07 0970  9    screws and nuts. Put the 12 tappets and some **f locking
E07 0980  9    bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components
E07 0990  6    before you tighten the screws. Be sure the tappets
E07 1000  3    are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq& spacer. As an
E07 1010  2    anchor for the spring lock, insert a **f bar in the
E07 1010 13    lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig& 7.
E07 1020  9    Drill a No& 43 hole through the pieces and secure with
E07 1030  6    a 2-56 nut and screw. Drill two No& 50 holes, one in
E07 1040  4    the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly
E07 1050  1    above it, and tap 2-56. Number all the tappet bars
E07 1050 12    before removing them so they can be replaced in the
E07 1060  8    same slots. Remove all other loose pieces and file
E07 1070  4    the edges of the basic frame smooth. Cut five pieces
E07 1080  1    of **f brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long. These are supporting
E07 1080 12    members for the short locking bars. Locate their positions
E07 1090  9    in Fig& 7 and drill No& 43 to match the corresponding
E07 1100  8    holes in the frame. Cut off excess screw lengths and
E07 1110  5    file flush with either frame or nut. Drill four No&
E07 1120  3    19 and four No& 28 holes in the 12'' long "~A" pieces.
E07 1130  2    Locate the position from Fig& 7.
E07 1130  8    #TAPPETS AND LOCKING BARS#
E07 1140  2    Draw-file No& 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective
E07 1150  1    slot and square the ends. Break the end corners with
E07 1150 11    a slight 45 degree chamfer. Drill a No& 50 hole 1-1/4''
E07 1160  9    from one end and tap 2-56. (See Fig& 7.) Put a 2-56
E07 1170 10    roundhead screw into the hole, cut off the excess threads
E07 1180  5    and file flush with the underside of the bar. To find
E07 1190  3    the other stop screw position, insert the tappet into
E07 1190 12    the frame and hold the screw head tight against the
E07 1200  9    frame edge. Scribe a line across the bar on the other
E07 1210  7    end of the tappet, 1/4'' plus half the diameter of
E07 1220  3    the 2-56 screw head (about 5/64'') away from the frame
E07 1230  1    edge. Total distance is about 21/64''. Tend to make
E07 1230 10    this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the
E07 1240  8    screw head to get exactly 1/4'' tappet movement. Drill
E07 1250  5    a No& 50 hole, tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56
E07 1260  5    screw as you did on the first end. Drill a No& 47 hole
E07 1270  3    crosswise through the tappet at the position shown
E07 1270 11    in Figs& 7 and 8. Repeat these drill and tap operations
E07 1280 10    for each of the tappet bars.
E07 1290  2       To each tappet except 6 and 8, solder a **f piece
E07 1290 13    of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs&
E07 1300 11    6 and 8. These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical
E07 1310  9    contacts.
E07 1310 10       Fitting the locking bars and making the locking
E07 1320  8    pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws, tappets
E07 1330  5    and locking bars must be removed and replaced many
E07 1340  2    times. As the work progresses the frame and moving
E07 1340 11    parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several
E07 1350  8    pieces must be removed before the part you are working
E07 1360  6    on is accessible. A little extra work here will pay
E07 1370  4    off with a smooth, snug-fitting machine when you are
E07 1370 14    finished. Each completed locking bar should remain
E07 1380  7    in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting.
E07 1390  6       The order of fitting is not too important. However,
E07 1400  4    we started with the first row of bars and worked our
E07 1410  2    way back. Since the same method of shaping and fitting
E07 1410 12    the dogs and notches is used throughout, we will only
E07 1420  9    describe the construction of one locking bar. Figs&
E07 1430  6    7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions. All the bars
E07 1440  4    are cut from **f brass. The lengths of each piece are
E07 1450  1    listed at the bottom of Fig& 7. Bar "~C" is 2-3/4''
E07 1450 13    long. Draw-file the edges, square up the ends and put
E07 1460 11    a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag
E07 1470  9    in the frame.
E07 1470 12       Fig& 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin
E07 1480  8    holes. Center-punch and drill the No& 31 hole 7/16''
E07 1490  6    from one end of the bar. Chuck a length of 1/8'' dia&
E07 1500  4    drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning
E07 1510  1    device and while it is rotating file the end square
E07 1510 11    and then file a slight taper 1/8'' long. Cut the piece
E07 1520  9    about 9/32'' or 5/16'' long and drive it into the No&
E07 1530  8    31 hole drilled in the locking bar. File the bottom
E07 1540  5    edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' above the
E07 1550  3    bar. This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet
E07 1550 15    3.
E07 1560  1       Place the locking bar in proper position and insert
E07 1560 10    tappet 3. Scribe a line through the center of the pin
E07 1570 10    and across the face of tappet 3, parallel to piece
E07 1580  6    "~A". See the drawings for the shape of the notch.
E07 1590  4    Scribe ~V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with
E07 1600  2    either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power
E07 1600 14    tool. We used the latter equipped with a carborundum
E07 1610  7    disk about .020'' thick and 1'' dia& fitted on a 1/8''
E07 1620  7    dia& mandrel. Such disks are very handy for cutting
E07 1630  5    and shaping small parts. File to a smooth finish. A
E07 1640  2    Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular
E07 1650  1    shape with only one cutting face will allow you to
E07 1650 11    work a surface without marring an adjoining one. Endeavor
E07 1660  6    to get the notches as much alike as possible. The notch
E07 1670  5    should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will
E07 1680  3    slide easily over it. Assemble the parts in the frame
E07 1680 13    and test the sliding action of the mating pieces. All
E07 1690 10    matching surfaces should be checked frequently and
E07 1700  6    mated on a cut and fit basis.
E07 1710  1       Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia& drill rod
E07 1710 12    in a drill press or electric hand tool. Fashion a sharp
E07 1730  7    scribing point about 3/64'' long on one end, using
E07 1740  6    Swiss pattern files. This tool can also be made with
E07 1750  3    a lathe.
E08 0010  1       Scientists say that the world and everything in
E08 0010  9    it are based on mathematics. Without math the men who
E08 0020  7    are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons
E08 0030  5    for the many things that make the world go 'round would
E08 0040  2    not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and
E08 0040 10    communicating the things they discover and learn. Math
E08 0050  8    and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different
E08 0060  8    problems are, therefore, essential to any scientific
E08 0070  4    endeavor.
E08 0070  5       Hot rodding is a science. It's not a science as
E08 0080  5    involved as determining what makes the earth rotate
E08 0090  1    on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite
E08 0090 12    into orbit but it is, nevertheless, a science. But
E08 0100  8    because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean
E08 0110  3    that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.
E08 0120  1    A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for
E08 0120 12    years without becoming even remotely involved with
E08 0130  7    mathematical problems; however, he will have a clearer
E08 0140  7    understanding of what he is doing and the chances are
E08 0150  4    he will be more successful if he understands the few
E08 0160  1    formulas that apply to rodding.
E08 0160  6       A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern
E08 0170  5    for solving a specific problem. It places the various
E08 0180  2    factors involved in the problem in their correct order
E08 0180 11    in relation to each other so that the influence of
E08 0190  9    factors on each other can be computed.
E08 0200  3       The first step in using a formula is to insert the
E08 0210  1    numerical values of the factors involved in their correct
E08 0210 10    positions in the formula. This changes the formula
E08 0220  8    to an "equation". The equation is used for the mathematical
E08 0230  7    process of solving the problem.
E08 0240  1       Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated.
E08 0240  8    They involve only simple mathematics that are taught
E08 0250  7    in grammar school arithmetic classes. However, it is
E08 0260  5    essential that the various mathematical symbols used
E08 0270  2    in the equations be understood so that the mathematical
E08 0270 11    processes can be done properly and in their correct
E08 0280  9    order. They indicate simple division, multiplication,
E08 0290  4    subtraction, and addition.
E08 0300  1       The symbol for division is a straight line that
E08 0300  9    separates two numbers placed one above the other. The
E08 0310  7    lower number is always divided into the upper number:
E08 0320  3    **f
E08 0320  4       The symbol for multiplication is "~@". It is used
E08 0340  4    to separate two or more numbers in a row. For example:
E08 0350  1    **f Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied
E08 0350 10    in any order. The result will be the same regardless
E08 0360  9    of the order used.
E08 0370  1       The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus
E08 0370  9    sign. This is nothing more than a dash. It separates
E08 0380  8    two or more numbers. The number on the right of the
E08 0390  6    symbol is always subtracted from the number on the
E08 0400  2    left of the symbol. For example: **f When more than
E08 0400 12    two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the
E08 0410  7    subtraction must be carried out from the left to right
E08 0420  7    if the result is to be correct. For example, for the
E08 0430  3    problem **f, 10 from 25 equals 15, then 6 from 15 equals
E08 0440  1    9.
E08 0440  2       Addition is indicated by the ~+ symbol. The symbol
E08 0440 11    is used to separate two or more numbers. For example:
E08 0450 10    **f Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed
E08 0460  7    in any order.
E08 0460 10       When solving an equation that involves division
E08 0470  6    as well as other steps, do all the division steps first
E08 0490  1    to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical
E08 0500  2    value. Multiplication, subtraction, and addition can
E08 0500  8    then be accomplished as they appear in the equation
E08 0510  9    by starting at the left end of the equation and working
E08 0520  7    toward the right. Completing the division first also
E08 0530  4    includes those division parts that require multiplication,
E08 0540  1    subtraction, or addition steps: **f This would be reduced
E08 0550  1    by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product
E08 0550 11    by 12. This part of the equation would then become
E08 0560  7    4.
E08 0560  8       For use in formulas, fractions should be converted
E08 0570  4    to their decimal equivalents. The easiest way to do
E08 0580  4    this is with a conversion chart. Charts for this purpose
E08 0590  1    are available from many sources. They are included
E08 0590  9    in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are
E08 0600  5    stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments.
E08 0610  3       The various mathematical processes can be simplified
E08 0620  3    by carrying the results to only two or three decimal
E08 0620 13    places. Shortening the results in this manner will
E08 0630  8    not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of
E08 0640  6    the final result.
E08 0640  9       Some formulas contain "constants". A constant is
E08 0650  6    a number that remains the same regardless of the other
E08 0660  5    numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation.
E08 0670  2    It is a number without which the equation cannot be
E08 0670 12    solved correctly.
E08 0680  2       Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.
E08 0690  1    The answers they give can often pave the way to performance
E08 0690 12    increases and, quite often, are necessary for completing
E08 0700  7    entry blanks for different events. When it is needed,
E08 0710  6    one formula is as important as another. However, some
E08 0720  3    formulas are used more than others. We'll take them
E08 0730  2    in the general order of their popularity.
E08 0730  9    #ENGINE DISPLACEMENT#
E08 0740  1    A rodder should be able to compute the displacement
E08 0740 10    of his engine. Displacement is sometimes referred to
E08 0750  6    as "swept volume". Most entry blanks for competitive
E08 0760  5    events require engine displacement information because
E08 0770  2    of class restrictions. It is good to be able to compute
E08 0780  1    displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring
E08 0780 10    and stroking can be computed.
E08 0790  4       Factors involved in the displacement formula are
E08 0800  2    the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders, the length
E08 0800 11    of the piston stroke, the number of cylinders in the
E08 0810  9    engine, and a constant. The constant is .7854, which
E08 0820  6    is one-quarter of 3.1416, another constant known as
E08 0830  3    "pi". Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions
E08 0840  1    of circles.
E08 0840  3       Actually, the engine displacement formula is the
E08 0850  2    standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder
E08 0850 11    of any type with an added factor that represents the
E08 0860  8    number of cylinders in the engine. The cross-sectional
E08 0870  5    area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume
E08 0880  4    of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying
E08 0890  1    the area by the stroke length, which is the equivalent
E08 0890 11    of the length of the cylinders. Multiplying the result
E08 0900  7    by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the
E08 0910  6    engine's total displacement.
E08 0910  9       The formula is: **f. Dimensions in inches, and fractions
E08 0920  8    of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches.
E08 0930  6    Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters
E08 0940  3    will give the displacement in cubic centimeters (~cc).
E08 0950  2    One inch equals 2.54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals
E08 0950 11    16.38 cubic centimeters.
E08 0960  3       For example, let's consider a standard 283 cubic
E08 0970  3    inch Chevy ~V8. These engines have a cylinder diameter
E08 0980  1    of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches. The
E08 0980 13    formula, with the fractions converted to decimals,
E08 0990  6    becomes **f.
E08 0990  8       To arrive at the answer, multiply the numbers together
E08 1000  8    by starting at the left of the group and working to
E08 1010  6    the right. The different steps will look like this:
E08 1020  2    **f
E08 1020  3    #COMPRESSION RATIO#
E08 1020  5    A cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing
E08 1030  5    the cylinder's volume, or its displacement, with the
E08 1040  3    total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.
E08 1050  1    Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but
E08 1050  8    combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid.
E08 1060  8       Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same
E08 1070  6    manner as for the displacement formula: **f.
E08 1080  2       To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers
E08 1090  1    in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark
E08 1090 10    plug in the chamber and support the head so that its
E08 1100  8    gasket surface is level. Then pour water or light oil
E08 1110  5    from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the
E08 1120  2    chamber to its gasket surface. Do not overfill the
E08 1120 11    chamber. This is possible with water and other liquids
E08 1130  8    that have a high surface tension. Such liquids will
E08 1140  4    rise to a considerable height above the surface around
E08 1150  2    the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.
E08 1160  1       The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is
E08 1160 10    determined by subtracting the quantity still in the
E08 1170  6    beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity.
E08 1180  4    Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters (~cc),
E08 1190  2    making it necessary to convert the result to cubic
E08 1190 11    inches. However, the displacement of the cylinder can
E08 1200  8    be converted to cubic centimeters. The compression
E08 1210  4    ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same
E08 1220  4    regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters
E08 1220 12    are used. The only precaution is that all volumes used
E08 1230 10    in the formula be quoted in the same terms.
E08 1240  6       The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket
E08 1250  5    must be computed by multiplying its area in square
E08 1260  1    inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of
E08 1260  9    an inch. Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate
E08 1270  7    the square inch area of the opening but the calculation
E08 1280  4    can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it
E08 1290  3    won't affect the final computation. The volume of the
E08 1290 12    opening is added to the combustion chamber volume.
E08 1300  8       Another thing that must be taken into consideration
E08 1310  7    is the volume of the area between the top of the piston
E08 1320  6    and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is
E08 1330  2    in top dead center position. Compute this volume by
E08 1330 11    measuring the distance from the top of the block to
E08 1340 10    the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth
E08 1350  6    micrometer or some other precision measuring device
E08 1360  2    and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth.
E08 1360 13    The formula for this step is: **f This volume is added
E08 1370 11    to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head
E08 1380  7    gasket opening. The total of these three volumes is
E08 1390  5    the "final combustion chamber volume".
E08 1400  1       After the factors just described have been computed,
E08 1400  9    they are applied to the following formula: **f
E08 1410  6       For an example let's dream up an engine that has
E08 1420  6    a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches
E08 1430  2    and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches. Applying
E08 1430 11    these figures to the formula we get the equation: **f
E08 1440  9    The compression ratio is 10 to 1.
E08 1450  4       This method of computing compression ratio cannot
E08 1450 11    be used accurately for engines that have pistons with
E08 1460  9    either domed or irregularly shaped heads. Any irregularity
E08 1470  5    on the piston heads will make it impossible, with normal
E08 1480  5    means, to determine the final combustion chamber volume
E08 1490  3    because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot
E08 1500  1    be readily computed. The only way to determine the
E08 1500 10    final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are
E08 1510  7    used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder
E08 1520  4    head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston
E08 1530  1    is in top dead center position.
E08 1530  7    #GEAR RATIO- SPEED RELATIONSHIPS#
E08 1540  1    There are four versions of the formula that involves
E08 1540 10    the relationships of car speed, engine speed, rear
E08 1550  7    axle gear ratio, and rear tire size. By using the appropriate
E08 1560  6    version any one of these factors can be determined
E08 1570  3    for any combination of the other three.
E08 1570 10       To simplify the formulas a representative symbol
E08 1580  6    is substituted for each of the factors. These are
E08 1590  5       ~MPH for Car speed
E08 1590  9       ~RPM for Engine crankshaft speed
E08 1600  5       ~R for Rear axle gear ratio
E08 1610  1       ~W for Tire size
E08 1610  5       Tire size can be determined in several ways but
E08 1620  4    the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any
E08 1620 15    is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and
E08 1630 10    tire assembly. This is done by measuring the distance
E08 1640  7    from the surface on which the tire is resting to the
E08 1650  5    center of the rear axle shaft. A tire must be inflated
E08 1660  1    to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must
E08 1660 11    be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement
E08 1670  7    is made. The measurement must be in inches. Any fraction
E08 1680  7    of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted
E08 1690  4    to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.
E08 1700  1    When tire size is measured in this manner a constant
E08 1700 11    of 168 is used in the formula.
E08 1710  4       To determine car speed for a given combination of
E08 1720  2    engine speed, gear ratio, and tire size, the formula
E08 1720 11    is: **f For an engine speed of 5000 ~rpm, a gear ratio
E08 1730 11    of 4.00 to 1, and a tire radius of 13 inches, the equation
E08 1740  8    would look like this: **f
E08 1750  1       To determine engine speed for a given combination
E08 1750  9    of the other three factors the formula is: **f Using
E08 1760  7    the same figures as for the previous example, the equation
E08 1770  5    becomes: **f
E08 1770  7       To determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination
E08 1780  8    of the other three factors, the formula is: **f Using
E08 1790  5    the figures from the previous examples, the equation
E08 1800  2    becomes: **f
E09 0010  1    #ORLANDO, FLA&, FEB& 2#
E09 0010  5    - The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben
E09 0020  5    White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner (Mainliner-Highland
E09 0030  1    Ellen), a member of the Dick Williams stable, who was
E09 0040  1    clocked 2:25. She is owned by Ralph H& Kroening, Milwaukee,
E09 0050  1    Wis&, who, according to the railbirds, can feel justly
E09 0050 10    proud of her.
E09 0060  1       Other good miles have been by Debonnie (Dale Frost-Debby
E09 0070  1    Hanover) and Prompt Time (Adios-On Time) in 2:28-:36;
E09 0080  1    Kimberly Gal (Galophone-Kimberly Hanover) 2:26.2; Laguerre
E09 0081  1    Hanover (Tar Heel- Lotus Hanover) and Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle
E09 0090 11    Byrd) in 2:34~h. Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in
E09 0100  8    type and conformation- good body, plenty of heart girth,
E09 0110  9    stands straight on his legs on excellent feet- and
E09 0120  5    has the smoothest gait. This colt is behind most of
E09 0130  3    the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can
E09 0130 14    show about as much pace as any of them. Monel shows
E09 0140 11    improvement with each work-out and looks the makings
E09 0150  7    of a good brood mare after winning her share of races.
E09 0160  4       Stardel (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover), 2:34~h,
E09 0170  2    looks quite promising. Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay),
E09 0180  1    Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover) and Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess
E09 0190  1    Hanover) have been working together but have not equalled
E09 0190 10    their best work done some weeks ago. Fury and Caper
E09 0200  9    worked in 2:35~h and did it with ease. They are two
E09 0210  7    good colts of different type. Fury is upstanding and
E09 0220  3    on the rangy side, and Caper is more the compact type.
E09 0230  1    I have never seen Caper off his feet- he seems to know
E09 0230 13    nothing but 'trot' and keeps trying a little harder
E09 0240  8    if asked to do so. Fury has made a few mistakes but
E09 0250  7    looks like a wonderful prospect, with his impressive
E09 0260  2    gait and stride which certainly make him cover the
E09 0260 11    ground.
E09 0270  1       Trackdown (Torrid-Mighty Lady) has worked a mile
E09 0270  9    in 2:33.3~h. It took this colt several weeks to strike
E09 0280  9    a pace. Then, after emasculation, he was eased up for
E09 0290  7    a couple of weeks. He has thrived on all he has gone
E09 0300  6    through and looks the makings of a good little race
E09 0310  1    horse.
E09 0310  2       Thor Hanover (Adios-Trustful Hanover) is a wonderful
E09 0320  1    looking prospect and another good individual, with
E09 0320  8    solid, rugged conformation, good, flat bone and excellent
E09 0330  6    feet. This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November,
E09 0340  6    and immediately was put into harness and line-driven
E09 0350  4    for a few days, and then put to cart and broken in
E09 0360  1    very nicely, knowing nothing but trot. He appeared
E09 0360  9    in the hopples about November 14, was treated for worms
E09 0370  7    on the 18th, the latter date being the first time he
E09 0380  5    struck a real pace. On December 5 he paced a mile in
E09 0390  2    2:55 on the twice-around, out in third position all
E09 0390 12    the way. This colt has done everything asked of him,
E09 0400  9    and done it with ease. His best mile to date is 2:32.2~h.
E09 0410  7       Gamecock (Tar Heel-Terka Hanover) is another promising
E09 0420  5    colt, and his best time is 2:32.2~h. This is one of
E09 0430  5    the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center. The
E09 0440  2    first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle
E09 0440 12    old mare; the crupper under his tail seemed to be old
E09 0450 10    stuff. The fourth time in harness he walked off like
E09 0460  6    a gentleman. Being blistered for curbs has delayed
E09 0470  2    his work somewhat. But up to date he has shown as much
E09 0470 14    as any in the big Simpson stable.
E09 0480  6       Hustler (Knight Dream-Torkin) is a playful bay rascal
E09 0490  6    of a colt, not the best gaited, but he surely can pace
E09 0500  3    and is right there with them, and sometimes leading
E09 0500 12    them, in the best miles. Torrid Freight (Torrid-Breeze
E09 0510  8    On Hal) is a very rugged, strong-made colt with a wonderful
E09 0520  8    stride who has done with ease everything asked of him.
E09 0530  5    His best time is around 2:33.
E09 0540  1       Strongheart (Adios-Direct Gal), a fair-looking sorrel
E09 0540  8    colt, knows nothing but pace and has been right there
E09 0550  8    in the best miles. Torrid Adios (Torrid-Adios Molly)
E09 0560  4    is not so masculine as most of the colts, but I like
E09 0570  4    his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited
E09 0570 15    pacers on the grounds. Blistered for curbs and laid
E09 0580  9    off three weeks, he is coming along fine and looks
E09 0590  6    like a pacer to me. First Flyer (Frisco Flyer-Castle
E09 0600  3    Light) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois
E09 0610  1    Stakes. His best time is 2:33.2~h.
E09 0610  7       The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything
E09 0620  6    on the fillies, especially the pacers. Justine Hanover
E09 0630  4    (Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover) is improving with
E09 0640  3    each work-out and paced 2:32.4~h weeks ago.
E09 0650  1       Mrs& Freight (Knight Dream-Miss Reed) shows promise
E09 0650  9    and does it in good form, and her best time is about
E09 0660 10    2:35. Hoopla (Tar Heel-Holiday Hanover), a filly that
E09 0670  5    wanted to trot, knocked herself October 31 and November
E09 0680  4    1 fighting the hopples. She was then trained on the
E09 0690  2    trot until December 29, hitched to a breaking cart
E09 0690 11    once around the half-mile track and hoppled again.
E09 0700  7    This time she submitted and in a few days was going
E09 0710  6    good. On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1-:38~h;
E09 0720  1    on Jan& 18 2:37.3-:36.1~h; on Jan& 21, 2:36. This filly
E09 0730  3    is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters,
E09 0740  1    Valentine Day and Cerise- more scale and much better
E09 0740 10    underpinning. She is more like her full brother, Taraday
E09 0750  9    Hanover, but larger. Up to date she is a grand-looking
E09 0760 10    filly.
E09 0760 11       Pete Dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers.
E09 0770  8    Marquis Pick (Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan) seems to be
E09 0780  5    the pick of the stable at the present time. He is a
E09 0790  4    fine-looking colt with a good body, good set of legs
E09 0790 15    and nice way of going. His best mile to date is 2:28-:33.
E09 0800 11    Majestic Pick comes next, with a mile in 2:30-:33.2.
E09 0810  8    This colt is another fine-looking equine. Staley Hanover
E09 0820  6    (Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover) is a little on the
E09 0830  6    small side but a very compact colt and looks like one
E09 0840  3    to stand training and many future battles with colts
E09 0840 12    in his class. Best time to date is 2:34-:34. Step Aside
E09 0850 10    (Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow) has worked in 2:32 on the
E09 0860  8    half-mile track and shows promise.
E09 0870  2       Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked
E09 0880  1    from 2:40 to 2:35. Bonnie Wick (Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary)
E09 0880 11    has gone in 2:36~h; Hickory Ash (Titan Hanover-Misty
E09 0890  9    Hanover) in 2:35. The first time I saw the latter filly
E09 0900 11    she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance
E09 0910  8    that I said to myself, "that must be Hickory Ash".
E09 0920  5    She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot. Hickory
E09 0930  2    Hill (Star's Pride-Venus Hanover) has gone in 2:33~h;
E09 0940  1    Hickory Spark (Harlan-Hickory Tiny) 2:37~h; Buxton
E09 0950  1    Hanover (Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover) 2:35; Faber's Kathy
E09 0960  1    (Faber Hanover-Ceyway) 2:37~h; Honor Rodney (Rodney-Honor
E09 0970  1    Bright) around 2:40. The last-named is a fine-looking,
E09 0970 11    large colt, who has been unfortunate to be laid off
E09 0980  9    for some time due to injuries. He is going sound again
E09 0990  6    now, and looks good.
E09 0990 10       Brief Candle (Harlan-Marcia) has gone in 2:37~h;
E09 1000  7    Lena Faber (Faber Hanover-Chalidale Lena) 2:33~h; Martha
E09 1010  4    Rodney (Rodney-Miss Martha D&) 2:35~h; Checkit (Faber
E09 1020  5    Hanover-Supermarket) 2:35~h; Charm Rodney (Rodney-The
E09 1030  5    Charmer) 2:37~h; Fair Sail (Farvel-Topsy Herring) 2:36~h;
E09 1040  6    Custom Maid (Knight Dream-Way Dream) 2:34.2~h; Jacky
E09 1050  4    Dares (Meadow Gene-Princess Lorraine) 2:36~h; Good
E09 1060  4    Flying (Good Time-Olivette Hanover) 2:36~h; Bordner
E09 1070  3    Hanover (Tar Heel-Betty Mahone) 2:34; Faber's Choice
E09 1080  3    (Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet) 2:36~h; Invercalt
E09 1090  2    (Florican-Inverness) 2:35~h; Duffy Dares (Meadow Gene-Princess
E09 1100  4    Mite) 2:36~h; Harold J& (Worthy Boy-Lady Scotland)
E09 1110  2    2:36; Knightfall (Knight Dream-Miss Worthy Grapes)
E09 1120  2    2:36~h; Next Knight (Knight Dream-Next Time) 2:36~h;
E09 1130  1    Trader Jet (Florican-My Precious) 2:37~h; Trader Rich
E09 1140  2    (Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover) 2:37~h; Good Little Girl
E09 1150  2    (Good Time-Mynah Hanover) 2:36~h; Iosola Hanover (Kimberly
E09 1160  1    Kid-Isoletta Hanover) 2:36~h. The last-named is one
E09 1170  1    of the favorites in the stable, and the boys like her
E09 1170 12    very much. I will be able to tell you more about this
E09 1180  9    string of equines in the near future.
E09 1190  1       I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a
E09 1190 11    mile in 2:34, last quarter in :35.3. In going away
E09 1200 10    Debonnie got behind several lengths, stalling at the
E09 1210  6    start- she is a little fussy. They left the three-quarters
E09 1220  5    together and finished almost together. Prompt Time
E09 1230  2    shows class. This filly is another Adios that wants
E09 1230 11    to trot, and trot she did until forced to do otherwise.
E09 1240 10    After well broken and equipped with 12~oz shoes on
E09 1250  7    behind, bare-footed in front, she would trot a real
E09 1260  5    storm with the master, Delvin, driving. Being placed
E09 1270  1    in the hopples she was completely baffled. She hesitated,
E09 1270 10    she hopped, she roll and rocked, skipped and jumped,
E09 1280  8    but in some two weeks she started to pace, From that
E09 1290  6    time to this she has shown steady improvement and now
E09 1300  3    looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.
E09 1300 13       Rain on Friday prevented many workouts, but there
E09 1310  9    were a few miles of note on Thursday. Those responsible
E09 1330  3    included Stardel Hanover (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover),
E09 1340  5    2:30-:34.3; Lorena Gallon (Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover),
E09 1350  5    2:30-:34.3; Prudent Hanover (Dean Hanover-Precious
E09 1360  4    Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Premium Freight (Titan Hanover-Pebble
E09 1370  5    Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Laguerre Hanover (Tar Heel-Lotus
E09 1380  5    Hanover), 2:30.3-:36.1; Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd),
E09 1390  5    2:30.3-:36.1; Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay), 2:30.3-:36;
E09 1400  5    Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover), 2:30.3-:36; Caper
E09 1410  4    (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover), 2:30.3-:36; Lucky Freight
E09 1420  3    (Knight Dream-Lusty Helen), 2:31.3-:35.3.
E09 1430  1       Sam Caton's Butterwyn (Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn),
E09 1440  1    a light bay filly, knows nothing but trot and has worked

E09 1450  7    Rachel) has gone in 2:38~h. Sam is having his troubles
E09 1460  7    with Layton Hanover (Dean Hanover-Lucy Hanover), but

E09 1580  1    #DEL MAR, CALIF&, FEB& 3#
E09 1580  6    - After 52 rainless days, moisture finally came to
E09 1590  6    Del Mar, resulting in but one workout during the week
E09 1600  4    for most of the horses, and leaving us with less than
E09 1610  1    half our total average rainfall during the season.
E09 1610  9       While 2-year-olds are still gaining most of the
E09 1620  7    attention at the track, green horses are starting to
E09 1630  5    go a bit, and Jimmy Cruise has several that can really
E09 1640  3    make it. Work-outs for the week are as follows: Plain
E09 1650  1    Scotch, 3 (by Scotch Victor), Demon Law, 3 (by Demon
E09 1650 11    Hanover), Coffee Royal, ~p (by Royal Blackstone) and

E10 0010  1       The average reader of this magazine owns more than
E10 0010 10    one gun (we ran a survey to find out) but he's always
E10 0020 10    on the lookout for new and better arms. He's more than
E10 0030  6    a reader of outdoor articles; he's a real hunter and
E10 0040  5    shooter, eager to improve his sport. Well, if you're
E10 0050  1    that kind of sportsman we're here to help you. You've
E10 0050 11    probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to
E10 0060  9    the guns in your rack, but it's not easy to decide
E10 0070  7    on a new one. You still have time to drop a few hints
E10 0080  5    about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time to
E10 0090  2    decide on them is now. As a Christmas service, I've
E10 0090 12    taken a close look at this year's crop of new models.
E10 0100  9    Here they are, with my comments and judgments. Read
E10 0110  5    on, take your pick- and start dropping those hints.
E10 0120  3       First on my own list would be two arms- a rifle
E10 0130  1    and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest
E10 0130 11    sense. For me, a changed barrel length or an improved
E10 0140 10    stock doesn't constitute a truly new design. Such modifications
E10 0150  7    are all for the best but it takes something as different
E10 0160  6    as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts.
E10 0170  4       Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker (under $110)
E10 0180  3    is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all
E10 0180 14    the modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short,
E10 0190 10    light, quick-handling, fast-firing little timber gun
E10 0200  6    designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but
E10 0210  5    with lots of killing power and ample range for our
E10 0220  2    most popular big game- whitetail.
E10 0220  7       Ruger reports that on his recent African safari
E10 0230  6    the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a real work horse.
E10 0240  4    Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot,
E10 0250  1    and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob
E10 0250 10    and wart hog with deadly efficiency; these are fairly
E10 0260  6    large, tough animals.
E10 0270  1       The deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes
E10 0270 11    as no surprise to me. At least five years ago, Tom
E10 0280  8    Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle
E10 0290  3    for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model
E10 0300  1    90 action in 20-gauge size. After figuring out how
E10 0300 11    to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same
E10 0310  9    point of impact, we fired this little 20-inch-barrel
E10 0320  5    job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test
E10 0330  2    gallery. We quickly ran into the same trouble that
E10 0330 11    plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments: Three
E10 0340  7    or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch
E10 0350  7    bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably, one could
E10 0360  3    stray far out of the group.
E10 0360  9       Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity
E10 0370  6    achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of
E10 0380  4    the unjacketed revolver bullet. The new, jacketed slug
E10 0390  1    in .44 Magnum corrected this. But even without jacketed
E10 0390 10    bullets, I had enough faith in my double to take it
E10 0400 10    on an opening-day deer hunt that first year. Within
E10 0410  5    half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped
E10 0420  3    through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just
E10 0420 12    behind the left foreleg at 60 yards. He moved only
E10 0430 10    about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him- and
E10 0440  8    this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling.
E10 0450  4       Three more deer have fallen to this same gun, and
E10 0460  3    all were one-shot kills. My double was made with standard-weight
E10 0470  1    revolver barrels (before cutting to revolver length),
E10 0470  8    and although it compares well in other respects, it's
E10 0480  8    considerably heavier than the Deerstalker, which only
E10 0490  5    scales about 6-1/2 pounds.
E10 0490 10       If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter,
E10 0500 10    this is it. The Deerstalker points with the ease, speed
E10 0510  6    and precision of a fine imported double shotgun, and
E10 0520  4    its trigger pull is light and sharp. The 240-grain
E10 0530  1    bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 ~fps, which gives
E10 0530 10    it all the smash needed at woods ranges. With five
E10 0540  7    shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger
E10 0550  5    finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.
E10 0560  1       The second really new development this year was
E10 0560  9    a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load-
E10 0570  8    the .22 Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire. At present
E10 0580  6    it's available in one model, the fine and familiar
E10 0590  4    Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver (about $110), long a
E10 0600  3    top-quality handgun among target arms. The velocity
E10 0600 11    of this .22-caliber, 40-grain bullet is rated at a
E10 0610  8    very hot 2,460 ~fps, and it's the flattest shooting
E10 0620  4    of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range rise of
E10 0630  3    about an inch over a 100-yard range. This is a varmint
E10 0630 15    load, pure and simple; it's much too explosive for
E10 0640  9    small edible game. It can cut a red squirrel neatly
E10 0650  8    in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers.
E10 0660  3       The most intriguing aspect of the ~S+W Magnum chambered
E10 0670  2    for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22
E10 0670 14    rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers.
E10 0680  9    You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game
E10 0690  8    and plinking arm, although the difference in the point
E10 0700  4    of impact (Jet vs& rim-fire) can be somewhat disconcerting.
E10 0710  1    The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine; I tested
E10 0720  1    it in my scoped ~S+W and it was good enough to allow
E10 0720 13    me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I
E10 0730 10    did my part by holding the handgun steadily.
E10 0740  2    #HUNTING RIFLES, '61#
E10 0740  5    The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the
E10 0750  6    only completely new designs this year doesn't mean
E10 0760  2    that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and
E10 0760 11    calibers. Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of
E10 0770  9    hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time.
E10 0780  6    Here are the brands (in alphabetical order) and the
E10 0790  4    new models.
E10 0790  6       Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning
E10 0800  4    group of bolt-action, high-power rifles. They have
E10 0810  1    fine ~FN actions and a better-than-average finish on
E10 0810 11    both the metal and the stock wood. Barrel weights vary
E10 0820  8    sensibly with the various calibers available, and these
E10 0830  5    include the standard bores (about $165) plus the Magnums
E10 0840  4    (around $170); the latter include the .264, .300 ~H+H,
E10 0850  2    .338, .375 and .458. Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads
E10 0850 11    are standard on all of the Magnums except the .264.
E10 0860  9    Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes.
E10 0870  5       Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with
E10 0880  4    Sako actions, regardless of caliber. The .222's have
E10 0890  1    the short action; the .243 and .308, the medium action,
E10 0890 11    and the .270, **f and the Magnums, the long action
E10 0900  8    (about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for
E10 0910  5    the Custom version). Previously, ~FN actions were used
E10 0920  3    for the larger cartridges.
E10 0920  7       High standard has introduced a .22 auto, the Sport-King,
E10 0930  8    in two grades- field and special (less than $45 and
E10 0940  5    just over $45, respectively). It's a streamlined rifle,
E10 0950  2    fast and well-made.
E10 0950  6       Among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire rifles, 1961's lone newcomer
E10 0960  5    was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader (around $60). Previously
E10 0970  4    known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given this 11-shot
E10 0980  4    hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design,
E10 0980 11    and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum
E10 0990 10    rim-fires.
E10 1000  1       Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest
E10 1010  8    of new offerings. The Model 99 (under $45) is a light-weight,
E10 1020  9    streamlined .22 rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine
E10 1030  5    that holds 18 Long Rifles. It's extremely accurate
E10 1040  2    for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely
E10 1050  1    trouble-free in functioning. The 989 (about $40) is
E10 1050 10    an even newer .22 auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot
E10 1060 11    clip.
E10 1060 12       Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared,
E10 1070  6    but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination.
E10 1080  2    The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert
E10 1090  2    tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives
E10 1090 10    pretty fair accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches
E10 1100  9    long. You can unscrew this tube and replace it with
E10 1110  7    a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells- to
E10 1120  4    break the little Targo clay targets. A trap for throwing
E10 1130  1    these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that
E10 1130 10    the shooter can throw his own targets. A spring trap
E10 1140  8    for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also
E10 1150  5    available. You can have your choice of a seven-shot
E10 1160  1    repeater, the ~340TR (about $40) or a single-shot,
E10 1160 10    the ~320TR ($10 less).
E10 1170  3       The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for
E10 1180  3    economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than
E10 1180 11    it looks to run up a score on the clay birds. They'll
E10 1190 11    travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring
E10 1200  7    trap but it's almost impossible to break one after
E10 1210  4    it passes the 35-foot mark. The combination of thin
E10 1220  1    pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to
E10 1220 10    get on the birds, right now!
E10 1230  3       Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line
E10 1240  1    for 1961, with the addition of the .375 and .458 to
E10 1240 12    the list of Model 725's. These are made on special
E10 1250  7    order only, in Kodiak grade (about $310), with integral
E10 1260  5    muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads; they weigh
E10 1270  3    around nine pounds.
E10 1270  6       A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington
E10 1280  4    742 autoloader also appeared in 1961. This carbine
E10 1290  2    (under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade) has
E10 1290 12    an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by
E10 1300  7    the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a
E10 1310  6    short-barrel. This design is hard to beat for timber
E10 1320  3    hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard. Presently,
E10 1330  1    the ~742C is available in **f.
E10 1330  7       The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99
E10 1340  4    are the 99 Featherweight (about $125) and the 99 Deluxe
E10 1350  3    (under $135), which have a top-tang safety and improved
E10 1350 13    trigger design. The replacement of the slide-lock side
E10 1360  9    safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more
E10 1370  7    appealing than ever since the new safety is easier
E10 1380  4    and faster to operate.
E10 1380  8    #BEGINNERS' GUNS, '61#
E10 1390  1    A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961,
E10 1390 11    and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list
E10 1400  8    if you're wondering what to get for a youngster. The
E10 1410  6    most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 (about $20, $5
E10 1420  3    for a saddle scabbard)- a lever-action single-shot
E10 1420 12    patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action
E10 1430  7    and featuring the Western look. Because of its traditional
E10 1440  6    lines, it probably has more kid appeal than any other
E10 1450  5    model. The action is a drop-block, handling all the
E10 1460  2    standard .22 rim-fires.
E10 1460  6       Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning
E10 1470  4    shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty
E10 1480  1    of barrel weight and ample stock. This is the Model
E10 1480 11    122 (about $20); it's a single-shot bolt-action with
E10 1490  9    an automatic safety- i&e&, the safety goes on every
E10 1500  7    time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the
E10 1510  4    next shot. Stock design is excellent, and this model
E10 1520  1    is a good first gun. Another boy's model is the .22
E10 1520 12    single-shot Remington ~514C (around $20), which comes
E10 1530  6    with a 21-inch barrel and a short- 12-1/2-inch- stock;
E10 1540  5    it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.
E10 1550  1       A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this
E10 1550  9    year. The single-barrel Stevens ~940Y (under $35) is
E10 1560  9    made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever
E10 1570  7    because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate
E10 1580  4    a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does indeed
E10 1590  2    open very easily. This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock
E10 1590 13    and is available in either 20 or .410 gauge. There's
E10 1600  9    another addition to the Stevens line, the pump-action
E10 1610  7    Model 77 in .410 (under $75), which you may or may
E10 1620  5    not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters
E10 1630  1    like this gauge and type of scattergun too.
E10 1630  9    #SHOTGUNS, '61#
E10 1630 11    Although there were no startling developments in shotgun
E10 1640  8    design this year, a number of new models and variations
E10 1650  8    of existing models did hit the market. For example,
E10 1660  5    a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under,
E10 1670  2    the Broadway (from $350 up, depending on grade), differs
E10 1680  1    from standard models in that it is equipped with a
E10 1680 11    full beavertail fore end, a cushion recoil pad and
E10 1690  7    a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting.
E10 1700  2       The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the
E10 1700 11    Standard or Custom Pump Model (about $90 and $150,
E10 1710  9    respectively) in 12, 16 and 20.
E10 1720  5       Firearms International has introduced another import,
E10 1730  2    this one from Finland. It's the Valmet (about $170),
E10 1730 11    a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington
E10 1740  8    32- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still
E10 1750  9    brings high prices.
E10 1750 12       High Standard has also added two models to its line.
E10 1760 10    The Supermatic Trophy (prices begin at less than $135
E10 1770  7    and depend on grade and optional features) is a 12-gauge
E10 1780  6    auto. The Flite-King Trophy (beginning at just over
E10 1790  3    $85) is a pump gun in 12 or 16. Either model is a very
E10 1790 17    good dollar value.
E10 1800  3       Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is the
E10 1810  2    Model 500 (from $73.50); this is an improved version
E10 1810 11    of the old Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun.
E10 1820  9    See page 24 for a complete report on it.
E10 1830  4    #HANDGUNS, '61#
E10 1830  6    Aside from the .22 Jet- which I coupled with the Deerstalker
E10 1840  6    carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments-
E10 1850  3    few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns.
E11 0010  1       LIVERY STABLE- J& VERNON, PROP"& Coaching had declined
E11 0020  1    considerably by 1905, but the sign was still there,
E11 0020 10    near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco,
E11 0030  7    creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years. John
E11 0040  6    Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for- he had
E11 0050  3    prospered, but he could not retire from horsedom. Coaching
E11 0060  1    was in his blood. He had two interests in life: the
E11 0060 12    pleasures of the table and driving. Twice a week he
E11 0070 10    drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road, upland
E11 0080  5    and through the redwood forest, with orchards below
E11 0090  2    him at one hand, and glimpses of the Pacific at the
E11 0090 13    other. The journey back he made along the coast road,
E11 0100  9    traveling hell-for-leather, every lantern of the tallyho
E11 0110  6    ablaze.
E11 0110  7       The southward route was the classic run in California,
E11 0120  7    and the most fashionable. His patronage on this stretch
E11 0130  4    was made up largely of San Franciscans- regulars, most
E11 0140  2    of them, and trenchermen like himself. They did not
E11 0140 11    complain at the inhuman hour of starting (seven in
E11 0150  9    the morning), nor of the tariff, which was reasonable
E11 0160  5    since it covered everything but the tobacco. Breakfast
E11 0170  2    was at the Palace Hotel, luncheon was somewhere in
E11 0170 11    the mountain forest, and dinner was either at Boulder
E11 0180  9    Creek or at Santa Cruz.
E11 0190  2       Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring,
E11 0190 11    so halts were contrived between meals. Then the Chinese
E11 0200  9    hostler, who rode with Vernon on the box, would break
E11 0210  8    open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or
E11 0220  5    sturgeon, sandwiches, pickled eggs, and a rum sangaree
E11 0230  1    to be heated over a spirit lamp.
E11 0230  8       In spring and in autumn the run was made for a group
E11 0240  8    of botanists which included an old friend of mine.
E11 0250  3    They gathered roots, bulbs, odd ferns, leaves, and
E11 0250 11    bits of resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir, which
E11 0260  9    exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly
E11 0270  6    side of these mountains. In the Spanish days Franciscan
E11 0280  3    monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense.
E11 0290  1    It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles
E11 0290 12    of Malabar. Vernon was serviceable on the botanical
E11 0300  7    field trips, but he could arrange no schedule with
E11 0310  5    the cooks, and he was glad when the trips dropped off,
E11 0320  2    and the botanists began to motor out by themselves.
E11 0330  1       My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning
E11 0330 10    of the regular tallyho run. This was an honor, like
E11 0340  8    dining with a captain at his private table. Vernon's
E11 0350  3    office adjoined the stable, and the walls were adorned
E11 0360  2    with brightly colored lithographs, the folk art of
E11 0360 10    the period. They advertised harness polish, liniments,
E11 0370  6    Ball's Rubber Boots, Green River Whiskey, Hood's Sarsaparilla,
E11 0380  6    patent medicines, shoe blacking, and chewing tobacco.
E11 0390  6       The hostler would have the table ready and a pot
E11 0400  6    of coffee hissing on the stove; then a porter from
E11 0410  2    Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his
E11 0410 13    head. It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot
E11 0420 10    a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn
E11 0430  8    fritters. Vernon was consummately fond of oysters,
E11 0440  3    and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil
E11 0450  1    War. Oyster salt roast- oysters on the half shell,
E11 0450 10    cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when
E11 0460  9    served- was a standby at Manning's. Its early morning
E11 0470  4    patrons were coachmen, who fortified themselves for
E11 0480  2    the day with that delicacy.
E11 0480  7       In the 1890's the Palace Hotel began serving an
E11 0490  6    oyster dish named after its manager, John C& Kirkpatrick.
E11 0500  3    This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller made
E11 0510  2    famous by Antoine's in New Orleans, though the Palace
E11 0520  1    chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters.
E11 0520 11    (Gastronomes have long argued about which came first,
E11 0530  8    the Palace's or Antoine's. Antoine's held as mandatory
E11 0540  5    a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach
E11 0550  6    which was used for the underbedding. The Kirkpatrick
E11 0560  2    version holds liqueur as optional.) Vernon, however,
E11 0570  1    held out for plain oyster roast, and plenty of it,
E11 0570 11    unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt, though
E11 0580  7    he did fancy a bit of lemon.
E11 0590  1       After the meal, he and his guests went out to inspect
E11 0590 12    the rig; this was merely a ritual, to please all hands
E11 0600  9    concerned. The tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300. A replica
E11 0610  6    of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club
E11 0620  3    in the East, and matchless west of the Rockies, it
E11 0630  1    was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run. One
E11 0630 12    could shave in the reflection of its French-polished
E11 0640  7    panels, and its axles were greased like those of roulette
E11 0650  5    wheels. The horses were groomed to a high gloss; departing,
E11 0660  3    they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw,
E11 0670  1    for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.
E11 0670 11       But for the start of the Santa Cruz run, the whip
E11 0680 11    fell. The clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace
E11 0690  6    promptly at seven. They had been fed a hunting breakfast,
E11 0700  4    so called because a kedgeree, the dish identified with
E11 0710  2    fox hunting, was on the bill. There are many ways of
E11 0710 13    making a kedgeree, every one of which is right. Here
E11 0720  9    is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family Club's
E11 0730  6    kitchen:
E11 0730  7    #CLUB KEDGEREE#
E11 0730  9    Flake (for three) a cupful of cold boiled haddock,
E11 0740  9    mix with a cupful of cooked rice, two minced hard-boiled
E11 0750  6    eggs, some buttery white sauce done with cream, cayenne,
E11 0760  4    pepper, salt, a pinch of curry, a tablespoonful of
E11 0770  1    minced onion fried, and a bit of anchovy. Heat and
E11 0770 11    serve hot on toast.
E11 0780  1    ##
E11 0780  2    The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast, the Palace's
E11 0780 10    chef, was even more in demand. For decades it was the
E11 0790 11    most popular dish served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast,
E11 0800  8    and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still
E11 0810  6    survive. Native California oysters, salty and piquant,
E11 0820  4    as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a
E11 0830  1    five-cent piece, went into it. The original formula
E11 0830 10    goes thus:
E11 0830 12    #OMELET ARBOGAST#
E11 0840  2    Fry in butter a small minced onion, rub with a tablespoonful
E11 0850  1    of flour, add half a cup of cream, six beaten eggs,
E11 0850 12    pepper, celery salt, a teaspoonful of minced chives,
E11 0860  8    a dash of cayenne, and a pinch of nutmeg. A jigger
E11 0870  6    of dry Sherry follows, and as the mixture stiffens,
E11 0880  2    in go a hundred of the little oysters.
E11 0880 10       Louis Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace,
E11 0890  8    and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he
E11 0900  4    introduced it at his restaurant in New York. J& Pierpont
E11 0910  3    Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco,
E11 0920  1    to attend an Episcopal convention, and brought the
E11 0920  9    restaurateur with him. As things happened, Morgan was
E11 0930  8    installed in the Nob Hill residence of a magnate friend,
E11 0940  6    whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent.
E11 0950  2    Sherry remained in his hotel suite, where he amused
E11 0950 11    himself as best he could. Twice he left everything
E11 0960  9    to his entourage, and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour
E11 0970  8    under Vernon's guidance.
E11 0980  1       In the grand court of the Palace, notable for its
E11 0980 11    tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the
E11 0990  7    maelstrom of vehicles below, Vernon's station was at
E11 1000  4    the entrance. It was a post of honor, held inviolate
E11 1010  1    for him; he had the primacy among the coachmen. Of
E11 1010 11    majestic build, rubicund and slash-mouthed, he resembled
E11 1020  7    the late General Winfield Scott, who was said to be
E11 1030  7    the most imposing general of his century, if not of
E11 1040  4    all centuries. Vernon wore a gray tall hat, a gardenia,
E11 1050  1    and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant
E11 1050  9    jelly.
E11 1060  1       Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court
E11 1060 11    with twelve in the tallyho. He had style: he held his
E11 1070  9    reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked
E11 1080  6    Epsom surtout, and when the horses leaned at a curve,
E11 1090  4    as if bent by the force of a gale, he leaned with them.
E11 1100  1    They cantered down the peninsula, not slackening until
E11 1100  9    the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands
E11 1110  7    begin.
E11 1110  8       The road maps of the region have changed since 1905;
E11 1120  9    inns have burned down, moved elsewhere, or taken other
E11 1130  5    names. Once on the road (and especially if the passengers
E11 1140  4    were all regulars and masculine), the schedule meant
E11 1150  1    nothing. An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the
E11 1150  9    passengers of the tallyho, from which there issued
E11 1160  7    clouds of smoke. Vernon would tilt his hat over one
E11 1170  5    ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard, indulging
E11 1180  2    in a huge cigar. The horses moved at a clump; they
E11 1180 13    were no more on parade than was their driver; one fork
E11 1190 10    of the road was as good as another. The Santa Cruz
E11 1200  7    mountains sprawl over three counties, and the roads
E11 1210  4    twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed
E11 1220  1    columns ripple streams of rain, even when heat bakes
E11 1220 10    the Santa Clara valley below at the left. The water
E11 1230  8    splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery. You
E11 1240  4    arrive there in seersucker, and feel you were half-witted
E11 1250  1    not to bring a mackintosh.
E11 1250  6       Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the
E11 1260  7    establishments that he thought worthy of patronage.
E11 1270  1    A number of them must have fallen into disfavor; they
E11 1270 11    were struck out with remarks in red ink, denouncing
E11 1280  9    both the cooks and the management. He was copious in
E11 1290  6    his praise of those that served food that was good
E11 1300  3    to eat. The horses seemed to know these by instinct,
E11 1300 13    he used to say: such places invariably had stables
E11 1310  8    with superior feed bins.
E11 1320  1       There was Wright's, for one, lost amongst trees,
E11 1320  9    its wide verandas strewn with rockers. Many of its
E11 1330  8    sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet, and
E11 1340  6    lived there to the end of their days. It was the haunt
E11 1350  3    of writer Ambrose Bierce, who admired its redwoods.
E11 1350 11    Acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs
E11 1360 10    (akin to Berkshires), whose "carcass sweepstakes" were
E11 1370  5    renowned. Their ham butts, cured in oak-log smoke,
E11 1380  5    were also esteemed when roasted or boiled, and served
E11 1390  1    with this original sauce:
E11 1390  5    #WRIGHT'S DEVIL SAUCE#
E11 1390  8    Put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy,
E11 1400 10    or of the boiled ham liquor, with a half stick of butter,
E11 1410  7    three teaspoonfuls of made mustard, and two mashed
E11 1420  4    garlic cloves. Contribute also an onion, a peeled tomato
E11 1430  1    and two pickled gherkins, and a mashed lime. After
E11 1430 10    this has simmered an hour, add two tablespoons each
E11 1440  7    of Worcestershire, catsup, and chutney, two pickled
E11 1450  4    walnuts, and a pint of Sherry. Then simmer fifteen
E11 1460  1    minutes longer.
E11 1460  3    ##
E11 1460  4    Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed
E11 1470  3    at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar,
E11 1470 16    so that when its turn came, it was properly mellowed.
E11 1480 10       Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's,
E11 1490  7    and deer were rather a nuisance; they leaped six-foot
E11 1500  5    fences with the agility of panthers. But no one complained
E11 1510  4    when they wound up, regardless of season, in venison
E11 1520  1    pies. No one complained of the white wine either: at
E11 1520 11    this altitude of two thousand feet, grapes acquire
E11 1530  7    a dryness and the tang of gunflint. (The Almaden vineyards
E11 1540  4    have now climbed to this height.) Apple trees grew
E11 1550  3    there also. Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains
E11 1560  1    flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring,
E11 1560 11    the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle.
E11 1570  7       Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple
E11 1580  5    pies at the local bakery, which had a brick oven fired
E11 1590  2    with redwood billets. The merit of the pie, Vernon
E11 1590 11    believed, was due more to its making than to the waning
E11 1600 11    heat of the oven. The recipe, which he got from the
E11 1610  6    baker, and wrote down in his ledger, is basically this:
E11 1620  2    #WRIGHT'S APPLE PIE#
E11 1620  5    Peel, core, and slice across enough apples to make
E11 1630  5    a dome in the pie tin, and set aside. In a saucepan
E11 1640  2    put sufficient water to cover them, an equal amount
E11 1640 11    of sugar, a sliced lemon, a tablespoonful of apricot
E11 1650  8    preserve or jam, a pinch each of clove and nutmeg,
E11 1660  5    and a large bay leaf. Let this boil gently for twenty
E11 1670  2    minutes, then strain. Poach the apples in this syrup
E11 1670 11    for twelve minutes, drain them, and cool.
E11 1680  6       Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin, spread over
E11 1690  4    them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter, with
E11 1700  2    as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a
E11 1700 12    fresh bay leaf, then lay on a cover of pastry, and
E11 1710  9    gild it with beaten yolk of egg.
E12 0010  1       THOSE WHO have never traveled the width and length
E12 0010 10    of this land cannot conceive, on the basis of textbook
E12 0020  9    description alone, the overwhelming space and variety
E12 0030  5    of this country held together under one government.
E12 0040  2    The miracle of democratic America comes home to one
E12 0040 11    most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great
E12 0050 10    Plains of the Midwest; the sky-reaching peaks of the
E12 0060  8    Northwest mountains; the smoke-filled, art-filled,
E12 0070  5    drama-filled life of the great cities of the East;
E12 0080  2    the lush and historic charm of the South. Now, to add
E12 0080 13    to the already unbelievable extremes found in one nation,
E12 0090  8    we have the two new states of Hawaii and Alaska.
E12 0100  7       To hope to cover just one region of this land and
E12 0110  6    to enjoy all of its sights and events and, of course,
E12 0120  2    to bring back pictures of your experiences, requires
E12 0120 10    advance planning. For this reason, U&S& Camera has
E12 0130  7    prepared this special U&S&A& vacation feature. We divided
E12 0140  6    the country into five regions plus Hawaii and Alaska
E12 0150  6    and in each is included a general description of the
E12 0160  4    area plus specific recommendations of places and events
E12 0170  1    to cover. Any special photographic requirements are
E12 0170  8    also given.
E12 0180  1       Use this section to plan now to make the most of
E12 0180 12    your vacation in photogenic America.
E12 0190  4    #THE NORTHEAST#
E12 0190  6    BIRTHPLACE of the nation, the Northeast offers historic
E12 0200  6    battlefields; lovely old villages and a rugged seashore
E12 0210  5    among its many worthwhile sights. The rolling farms
E12 0220  2    of Maryland, the peerless metropolis of New York City,
E12 0230  1    the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included
E12 0230 10    in your Northeast vacation.
E12 0240  2       By automobile from New York, for example, you can
E12 0250  1    take a one or two-day tour to Annapolis, Maryland to
E12 0250 12    see the colonial homes and the U&S& Naval Academy (where
E12 0260  8    you can shoot the dress parade on Wednesdays); to Washington,
E12 0270  7    D&C&, for an eye-filling tour of the city; or to Lancaster,
E12 0280  8    Pa&, the center of the Pennsylvania Dutch country;
E12 0290  5    Philadelphia with its historic buildings and nearby
E12 0300  3    Valley Forge; to West Point, N&Y&, the famous military
E12 0310  3    academy in a beautiful setting on the Hudson River.
E12 0320  1       New England deserves as much of your vacation time
E12 0320 10    as you can afford with such areas as Cape Cod providing
E12 0330  9    wonderful beaches, artists' colonies and quaint townships.
E12 0340  5    From here you can easily include a side trip to the
E12 0350  6    old whaling port of Nantucket, Massachusetts, which
E12 0360  2    looks just as it must have two centuries ago.
E12 0360 11       At Sturbridge Village, Massachusetts, you'll find
E12 0370  5    a completely-restored New England town. North to Acadia
E12 0380  6    National Park, Maine, with views of a rockbound coast
E12 0390  5    and dark, magnificent forests.
E12 0390  9       One of the most exciting ways to end a Northeast
E12 0400  8    vacation would be with a week in New York City. Return
E12 0410  6    through New England, stopping for a visit to Lake Champlain
E12 0420  4    where you can take a boat ride and go to Ethan Allen
E12 0430  2    Park. There you'll witness a view which includes the
E12 0430 11    Adirondack Mts& and the Winooski River.
E12 0440  6       Now you're ready for a whirlwind sightseeing tour
E12 0450  5    of America's most exciting city. The skyline, the bridges,
E12 0460  4    Broadway, and the Staten Island ferry are only a few
E12 0470  4    of the spots to put on your "must" list for New York
E12 0480  1    City.
E12 0480  2    #PHOTOGRAPHING IN THE NORTHEAST#
E12 0480  6    Some tips for shooting in Northeastern locales: In
E12 0490  4    New York City don't miss coverage of the United Nations.
E12 0500  5    These striking, modernistic buildings on the East River
E12 0510  3    are open to the public and every weekday guided tours
E12 0510 13    are available. Pictures can be taken in the public
E12 0520  9    areas and when on tours. However, the use of tripods
E12 0530  6    is not allowed. Photos of Conference Rooms and the
E12 0540  4    General Assembly Hall can be made when these rooms
E12 0550  1    are not being used for meetings. Flash is allowed,
E12 0550 10    subject to above restrictions.
E12 0560  2       Around New England, you'll no doubt want a color
E12 0570  2    shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses. Be careful
E12 0570 11    here not to overexpose this subject since they are
E12 0580  8    extremely bright and light-reflecting. In color, 1/50th
E12 0600  4    of a second between **f and **f will do for bright,
E12 0610  2    frontal sunlight.
E12 0610  4    #THE SOUTH#
E12 0610  6    THE SOUTHERN United States, extending from Florida
E12 0620  5    in the east to Texas in the west, still maintains its
E12 0630  4    unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance.
E12 0640  1    It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural
E12 0640 10    beauty encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation,
E12 0650  7    on the one hand, to places where entertainment and
E12 0660  4    spectacles of all sorts have been provided for the
E12 0670  3    tourist with camera.
E12 0670  6       Of special interest this anniversary year of the
E12 0680  4    war between the states are the many Civil War battlefields
E12 0690  1    where, likely as not, you'll catch some memorial re-enactments.
E12 0700  1    Among the locales to visit are Shiloh, Tennessee; Lookout
E12 0700 10    Mountain, Tennessee; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Richmond,
E12 0710  5    Virginia; Petersburg, Virginia, and Fredericksburg,
E12 0720  5    Virginia.
E12 0720  6       Florida provides tropical scenes unequalled in the
E12 0730  7    United States. At Cypress Gardens special bleachers
E12 0740  5    are set up for photographers at water-ski shows and
E12 0750  3    lovely models pose for pictures in garden settings.
E12 0760  1    Silver Springs features glass-bottom boat rides and
E12 0760  9    in Everglades National Park there are opportunities
E12 0770  5    to photograph rare wildlife. Miami Beach and surroundings
E12 0780  4    feature fabulous "hotel row", palm-studded beaches
E12 0790  2    plus the Miami Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle.
E12 0800  1       One of the most delightful spots in a southern tour
E12 0800 11    is the city of New Orleans. The famous old French and
E12 0810  7    Spanish buildings with their elaborate wrought iron
E12 0820  4    balconies and the narrow streets of the Latin Quarter
E12 0830  2    present an Old World scene.
E12 0830  7       For restoration of early American life the places
E12 0840  5    to visit are Williamsburg, Jamestown and Yorktown,
E12 0850  2    Virginia. Another Virginia sight and a photographic
E12 0850  9    adventure are the Luray Caverns, lit by photofloodlights.
E12 0860  8       The great state of Texas offers metropolitan attractions
E12 0870  8    such as the Dallas Fair Park with its art and natural
E12 0880  8    history museums. In contrast are the vast open stretches
E12 0890  6    of ranch country and oil wells. In San Antonio visit
E12 0900  3    the famous Alamo and photograph 18th Century Spanish
E12 0910  1    buildings and churches.
E12 0910  4       The Great Smoky Mountains is another area of the
E12 0920  4    South well worth a visit. Along the 127-mile route
E12 0920 14    through Great Smoky Mountains National Park you can
E12 0930  8    photograph the breath-taking peaks, gorges and valleys
E12 0940  7    which come into view at every turn. Gatlinburg, Tennessee,
E12 0950  4    is the center of this area. Another scenic spot in
E12 0960  3    Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens
E12 0970  1    are not to be missed.
E12 0970  6       Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks of the
E12 0980  3    South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston,
E12 0990  1    S&C&, Natchez, Miss&, and Savannah, Ga&. At Charlottesville,
E12 1000  1    Va&, shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of
E12 1000  9    the University.
E12 1010  2    #PICTURING THE SOUTH#
E12 1010  5    Foliage is the outstanding photo subject in many of
E12 1020  5    the Southern locales mentioned above and some specific
E12 1030  2    tips on how and where to shoot it are in order. For
E12 1030 14    example, the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg, Tennessee,
E12 1040  8    sponsors special camera tours into the Great Smoky
E12 1050  7    Mountains to get pictures of the profusion of wild
E12 1060  4    flowers flourishing in these wooded regions.
E12 1070  1       Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas
E12 1070  9    where uneven lighting results from shafts of sunlight
E12 1080  6    filtering through the overhead branches. Best solution
E12 1090  3    is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight or
E12 1100  2    shade. In any instance, you should determine the exposure
E12 1100 11    according to the type of light which falls on most
E12 1110 10    of the subject area.
E12 1120  1       Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide
E12 1120  9    a welcome contrast with the many long-view scenics
E12 1130  7    you'll be making.
E12 1130 10       For shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum
E12 1140  9    Southern mansions make sure your equipment includes
E12 1150  5    a tripod. Enough daylight is usually available from
E12 1160  3    the windows, but if you have synchronized flash- use
E12 1170  1    it.
E12 1170  2       For some unusual photographic subjects, if your
E12 1170  9    vacation takes you nearby, try these events: the 600-mile
E12 1180  9    auto race in Charlotte, N& C&, on May 27; the Florida
E12 1190  8    Folk Festival, White Springs, May 5-7; Singing on the
E12 1200  7    Mountain in Linville, North Carolina, on June 25. Peak
E12 1210  5    action photography is your goal at Miami's Seaquarium
E12 1220  2    and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events.
E12 1220  8    #THE MIDWEST#
E12 1230  2    A PLEASANT start to your midwestern vacation is a few
E12 1240  1    days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago. Lake Michigan offers
E12 1240  9    swimming and pictures which combine cityscapes with
E12 1250  7    beaches. A visit to Chicago's museums and a stroll
E12 1260  5    around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold many photogenic
E12 1270  3    subjects to the alert photographer.
E12 1270  8       Wisconsin Dells, where fantastically scenic rocks
E12 1280  6    carved by the Wisconsin River are overgrown with fern
E12 1290  5    and other foliage, rates a stopover when traveling
E12 1300  2    from Chicago.
E12 1300  4       The farmlands forming the heart of America stretch
E12 1310  2    out across the Midwest from Chicago. In North Dakota
E12 1320  1    the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you
E12 1320  8    to translate its wonder on to film. While here, visit
E12 1330  8    Theodore Roosevelt National Park for its spectacular
E12 1340  5    scenery.
E12 1340  6       Another spot with an image-provoking name is the
E12 1350  4    Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier mining
E12 1360  2    town of Deadwood. The Black Hills Passion Play is produced
E12 1370  1    every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting.
E12 1380  1       Of course, while in this vicinity you won't want
E12 1380  9    to miss a visit to Mount Rushmore National Memorial
E12 1390  5    where on the side of a mountain are the famous sculptures
E12 1400  5    of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Theodore
E12 1410  3    Roosevelt.
E12 1410  4       In Missouri (which we are including in our general
E12 1420  4    Midwest region) you can glance into Mark Twain's birthplace
E12 1430  2    at Hannibal, see the landmarks of his life and writings
E12 1440  1    and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief.
E12 1450  1       Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to
E12 1450  9    be seen- his tomb and other landmarks.
E12 1460  5       Minnesota, fabled land of waters, is in itself,
E12 1470  3    ideal vacationland, having within its borders 10,000
E12 1480  6    lakes! Itasca State Park, where the Mississippi River
E12 1490  8    begins, is one of the outstanding tourist spots in
E12 1500  7    Minnesota.
E12 1500  8       Mementoes of the Old West recall the days of Wyatt
E12 1510  8    Earp in Dodge City, Nebraska, where present-day cowboys
E12 1520  5    add a colorful human interest note to your vacation
E12 1530  2    shooting.
E12 1530  3       Of current interest is Abilene, Kansas, the birthplace
E12 1540  3    of ex-President Eisenhower. There's a museum here and
E12 1550  2    also Old Abilene Town, a reconstruction of the cattle
E12 1550 11    boomtown of the 70's and 80's.
E12 1560  6       For a resort area, Mackinack Island, Michigan, is
E12 1570  3    the place to visit. It truly relives another age for
E12 1580  1    the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and
E12 1580  9    old British and French forts are left intact for tourists
E12 1590  8    to visit and record.
E12 1590 12    #PICTURES OF THE MIDWEST#
E12 1600  4    Night scenes will add an exciting touch to your vacation
E12 1610  3    travelogue and what better place to take them then
E12 1610 12    along Chicago's Lake Shore Drive? Just after sunset
E12 1620  8    is a good time to record the city lights in color since
E12 1630  9    you get a "fill-in" light from the sky.
E12 1640  4       Another memo for sightseers: bring your camera along
E12 1650  2    to museums. Photos of historic dioramas of the area
E12 1650 11    you visit will add depth and background to your vacation
E12 1660  9    photo story. Again, be sure your tripod is handy for
E12 1670  8    those sometimes-necessary time exposures.
E12 1680  1       Special events and their dates which will make interesting
E12 1690  1    shooting in the Midwest area, include the following:
E12 1690  9       A re-enactment of the Battle of Lexington, May 18th
E12 1700  8    at Lexington, Missouri; the world-renowned 500-mile
E12 1710  6    auto race at Indianapolis, Indiana, plus a festival
E12 1720  4    from May 27-30; "Song of Hiawatha", in Elgin, Illinois,
E12 1730  3    from June 20 to 24th. Michigan offers the lovely Tulip
E12 1740  2    Festival in Holland, Michigan, May 12-14; the ~USGA
E12 1750  1    Open in Birmingham from June 15-17; and the International
E12 1750 11    Freedom Festival in Detroit, June 29-July 4.
E12 1760  8       For early vacationers there's the fun-filled Fishing
E12 1770  6    Derby in Hot Springs, Arkansas, April 19-23, and the
E12 1780  6    Arkansas Band Festival in Hot Springs, April 20-22.
E12 1790  4    #THE WEST#
E12 1790  6    A WESTERN VACATION is practically synonymous with a
E12 1800  4    visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks
E12 1810  1    in this area. A tour of several of them is possible
E12 1810 12    in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of
E12 1820  9    these natural beauty spots can be of equal reward.
E12 1830  5       In California is located one of the most popular
E12 1840  2    of the national parks- Yosemite. Among its most spectacular
E12 1850  1    features are its falls, the highest being Upper Yosemite
E12 1850 10    which drops 2,425 feet. The Sequoia Grove presents
E12 1860  7    another unique aspect of Yosemite, for these ancient
E12 1870  5    giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten.
E12 1880  1       In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce
E12 1880 11    Canyon National Park. Fantastic colors are to be seen
E12 1890  9    in the fanciful formations of eroded rock which loom
E12 1900  7    out of the semiarid country in both parks.
E12 1910  3       Colorado's Grand Canyon, probably the most famous
E12 1920  1    landmark of the United States, can be the highpoint
E12 1920 10    of your Western vacation.
E13 0010  1       BUILT UPON seven hills, Istanbul, like Rome, is
E13 0010  9    one of the most ancient cities in the world, filled
E13 0020  9    with splendor and contrast. It is an exotic place,
E13 0030  6    so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist
E13 0040  2    is likely to see at first only the contrast and the
E13 0040 13    ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses.
E13 0050  8    At the moment, many of these are being pulled down.
E13 0060  7    Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled
E13 0070  3    to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will
E13 0080  1    show off its treasures to better advantage- the great
E13 0080 10    domes and graceful spires of its mosques, the panorama
E13 0090  7    of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn. Even when they
E13 0100  5    are finished, however, the contrast will remain, for
E13 0110  3    Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built
E13 0110 14    upon two continents. For almost 3,000 years Europe
E13 0120  8    and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets.
E13 0130  5       Founded in the Ninth Century B&C& it was called
E13 0140  4    Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas, ruler of the
E13 0150  2    Megarians, expanded the settlement and named it after
E13 0150 10    himself. About a thousand years after that, when the
E13 0160  8    Roman Empire was divided, it became capital of the
E13 0170  6    Eastern section. On May 11, 330 A&D&, its name was
E13 0180  4    changed again, this time to Constantinople after its
E13 0190  1    emperor, Constantine. In 1453 when the last vestige
E13 0190  9    of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks, the city
E13 0200  8    officially shifted religions- although the Patriarch,
E13 0210  4    or Pope, of the Orthodox Church continued to live there,
E13 0220  4    and still does- and became the capital of the Ottoman
E13 0230  1    Empire. When that was broken up after the First World
E13 0230 11    War, its name was changed once more. Rich in Christian
E13 0240 10    and Moslem art, Istanbul is today a fascinating museum
E13 0250  7    of East and West that recently became a seaside resort
E13 0270  5    as well with the development of new beaches on the
E13 0280  2    Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance
E13 0280 12    from the center of town. Easy to get to, and becoming
E13 0290 10    more popular every year, it is only fourteen hours
E13 0300  6    from New York by Pan American World Airways jet, four
E13 0310  4    hours from Rome.
E13 0310  7    #START OF TOUR#
E13 0310 10    Most of the sights lie in the old section across the
E13 0320  9    Golden Horn from the modern hotels. I started my tour
E13 0330  6    of them at the Turkish Government Tourist Office, next
E13 0340  3    to Pan American's office on the left as you enter the
E13 0350  2    driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel. From there
E13 0350 11    I turned left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels
E13 0360  8    and a park on the left, Republic Gardens, and came
E13 0370  5    in a few moments to Taksim Square, one of the hubs
E13 0380  4    of the city, with the Monument of the Republic, erected
E13 0390  1    in 1928, in its center.
E13 0390  6       Directly across from the Gardens I found a bus stop
E13 0400  5    sign for ~T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus, with
E13 0410  2    the sports center on my left just before I reached
E13 0410 12    the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately
E13 0420  7    after that. There the bus turned right along the Bosphorus,
E13 0430  8    past ocean liners at anchor, to Galata Bridge over
E13 0440  5    the entrance to the Golden Horn, a brown sweep of water
E13 0450  3    that empties into the Bosphorus. Across the bridge
E13 0450 11    on the left I saw St& Sophia with its sturdy brown
E13 0460 11    minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires
E13 0470  7    of the Blue Mosque.
E13 0470 11       On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through
E13 0480 11    Eminonu Square, with Yeni Cami, or the New Mosque,
E13 0490  8    which dates from the Seventeenth Century, just across
E13 0500  4    from the entrance to the bridge. Passing it, the bus
E13 0510  3    climbed a hill, with the covered spice bazaar on the
E13 0510 13    right and Pandelli's, a famous and excellent restaurant,
E13 0520  7    above it. At the top of the hill the buildings on the
E13 0530  9    left gave way to a park. I got off there, crossed the
E13 0540  5    street, walked ahead with St& Sophia on my left, the
E13 0550  3    Blue Mosque on my right, and in a moment came to the
E13 0550 15    entrance of St& Sophia.
E13 0560  4       Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous
E13 0570  3    St& Sophias, the first of which was begun by Constantine,
E13 0580  1    this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532
E13 0580 10    and completed twenty years later. On his first trip
E13 0590  8    to the finished structure he boasted that he had built
E13 0600  7    a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem. A few
E13 0610  3    years later the dome fell in. Nevertheless, it remained
E13 0620  1    one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire,
E13 0620 11    where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned. After the
E13 0630  8    Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it
E13 0640  7    to a mosque, adding the stubby minarets. In the second
E13 0650  4    half of the Sixteenth Century, Sinan, the great architect
E13 0660  1    who is the Michelangelo of the East, designed the massive
E13 0660 11    buttresses that now help support the dome. With the
E13 0670  9    birth of the Turkish Republic after the First World
E13 0680  6    War, St& Sophia became a museum, and the ancient mosaics,
E13 0690  5    which were plastered over by the Moslems, whose religion
E13 0700  3    forbids pictures in holy places, have been restored.
E13 0710  1       Inside over the first door I saw one of these, which
E13 0710 12    shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary
E13 0720  9    and Justinian offering the temple. On the columns around
E13 0730  7    the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing.
E13 0740  4    The eight green columns, I learned, came from the Temple
E13 0750  4    of Artemis at Ephesus, the others, red, from the Temple
E13 0760  1    of the Sun at Heliopolis.
E13 0760  6       Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine
E13 0770  5    Emperors were crowned, a bit of floor protected now
E13 0780  2    by a wooden fence. Behind this is a minber or Moslem
E13 0780 13    pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork,
E13 0790 10    where the emperors and, after them, the sultans, sat.
E13 0800  7    Directly opposite is the emperor's door, through which
E13 0810  4    they entered the building.
E13 0810  8       Outside St& Sophia I walked through the flower garden
E13 0820  9    in front of it, with the Blue Mosque ahead on my left.
E13 0830  8    Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome,
E13 0840  4    now a park. It was laid out in 196 for chariot races
E13 0850  2    and other public games. Statues and other monuments
E13 0850 10    that stood there were stolen, mostly by the waves of
E13 0860  9    Crusaders.
E13 0860 10       At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's
E13 0870 10    Fountain, an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome,
E13 0880  8    built in 1895 by the German Emperor, and on my left,
E13 0890  6    directly across from it, the tomb of Sultan Ahmet,
E13 0900  2    who constructed the Blue Mosque, more properly known
E13 0900 10    by his name.
E13 0910  3       Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed
E13 0920  1    the street, entered the Hippodrome, and walked ahead
E13 0920  9    to the Obelisk of Theodosius, originally erected in
E13 0930  6    Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B&C& by Thutmose, who
E13 0940  5    also built those now in New York, London and Rome at
E13 0950  5    the Lateran. This one was set up here in 390 A&D& on
E13 0960  2    a pedestal, the faces of which are carved with statues
E13 0960 12    of the emperor and his family watching games in the
E13 0970 10    Hippodrome, done so realistically that the obelisk
E13 0980  5    itself is included in them.
E13 0980 10       Beyond it I noted a small green column, about twelve
E13 0990 10    feet below the present ground level- the Serpentine
E13 1000  5    Column, three entwined serpents, which once stood at
E13 1010  5    the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece. Near the end
E13 1020  3    of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column, a truncated
E13 1030  1    obelisk of blocks, all that remains of a monument that
E13 1030 11    once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes.
E13 1040  5    #MAGNIFICENT MOSQUE#
E13 1040  7    Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, only
E13 1050  8    one with six minarets, I entered the courtyard, with
E13 1060  4    a gallery supported by pointed arches running around
E13 1070  2    it and a fountain in the middle. One of the most beautiful
E13 1080  1    buildings in Istanbul, it was constructed in the early
E13 1080 10    years of the Seventeenth Century, with a huge central
E13 1090  6    dome, two half domes that seem to cascade down from
E13 1100  5    it, and smaller full domes around the gallery. The
E13 1110  2    round minarets, tall and graceful, rise from rectangular
E13 1110 10    bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin
E13 1120  8    can chant his call to prayer. Inside, the walls are
E13 1130  5    covered with blue and white tile, the floor with red
E13 1140  3    and cream carpets.
E13 1140  6       Back at the Kaiser's Fountain, I walked left to
E13 1150  5    the streetcar stop and rode up the hill- any car will
E13 1160  3    do- past the Column of Constantine, also known as the
E13 1160 13    Burnt Column, at the top on my right. It stands in
E13 1170 11    the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine,
E13 1180  7    who brought it from Rome.
E13 1190  1       I stayed on the car for a few minutes until, turning
E13 1190 12    right, it entered a huge square, Bayezit, with the
E13 1200  7    Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university
E13 1210  6    just beyond it. There I got off, crossed the square,
E13 1220  3    and on the side directly opposite the gate found a
E13 1220 13    good restaurant, hard to come by in this part of the
E13 1230 11    city. Called the Marmara Gazinosu, it is on the third
E13 1240  7    floor, with signs pointing the way there, and has a
E13 1250  5    terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara. After lunch,
E13 1260  1    in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street
E13 1260 12    I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava-
E13 1270 10    a sweet, flaky cake- in Istanbul. It's a great favorite
E13 1280  9    of the university students, and I joined them there
E13 1290  6    for dessert.
E13 1290  8       Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain,
E13 1300  4    I walked ahead, then left down the street opposite
E13 1310  2    St& Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small,
E13 1320  1    one-story building with a red-tile roof, which is the
E13 1320 12    entrance to the Sunken Palace. Actually an underground
E13 1330  6    cistern, its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars,
E13 1340  7    it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply
E13 1350  4    the palace with water. There is still water in it.
E13 1360  1    I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately.
E13 1370  1       Outside I walked past the entrance to St& Sophia,
E13 1370  9    turned left at the end of it, and continued toward
E13 1380  8    a gate in the wall ahead. Just before reaching it I
E13 1390  5    came to a grey and brown stone building that looks
E13 1400  1    somewhat like an Oriental pagoda, with Arabic lettering
E13 1400  9    in gold and colored tile decorations- the Fountain
E13 1410  6    of Sultan Ahmet.
E13 1420  1       Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall, I entered
E13 1420 11    the grounds of Topkapi Palace, home of the Sultans
E13 1430  8    and nerve center of the vast Ottoman Empire, and walked
E13 1440  5    along a road toward another gate in the distance, past
E13 1450  3    the Church of St& Irene, completed by Constantine in
E13 1460  2    330 A&D& on my left, and then, just outside the second
E13 1470  1    gate, I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right-
E13 1470 15    the Executioner's Spring, where he washed his hands
E13 1480  7    and his sword after beheading his victims.
E13 1490  3       Passing through the gate, with towers on either
E13 1500  1    side once used as prisons, I entered a huge square
E13 1500 11    surrounded by buildings, and on the wall to my right
E13 1510  9    found a general plan of the grounds, with explanations
E13 1520  3    in English for each building. There are a good many
E13 1530  3    of them. At one time about 10,000 people lived there.
E13 1540  1       Following arrowed signs, I veered right toward the
E13 1540  9    former kitchens, complete with chimneys, which now
E13 1550  6    house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese
E13 1560  4    porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services.
E13 1570  2    Next to it is a copper section, with cooking utensils
E13 1580  1    and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate, floor-length
E13 1580 13    robe.
E13 1590  1       In the court once more, I went right toward the
E13 1590 11    Reception House, a long one-story building with a deep
E13 1600  9    portico. Going through a door into another small court,
E13 1610  5    I had the Throne Room directly in front. I walked to
E13 1620  4    the right around it to buildings containing illuminated
E13 1630  1    manuscripts and came to the Treasury, which houses
E13 1630  9    such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds, jewelled
E13 1640  6    swords, rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like
E13 1650  6    thrones as large as small beds, on which the sultans
E13 1660  3    sat cross-legged. They are made of gold and covered
E13 1660 13    with emeralds, pearls and other jewels.
E13 1670  6       Taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building
E13 1680  7    directly beyond it, the Portrait Gallery, I went right
E13 1690  4    at the end of it, through a garden to a small building
E13 1700  1    at the back- a sitting room furnished with low blue
E13 1700 11    divans, its floor covered with carpets, its ceiling
E13 1710  7    painted with gold squares and floral designs.
E14 0010  1       DO start fires one or two hours ahead of time to
E14 0010 12    obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals. Keep ashes from
E14 0020  9    one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if
E14 0030  6    they are too hot, and to stop flames that arise from
E14 0040  3    melting grease.
E14 0040  5       Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect
E14 0050  5    heat.
E14 0050  6       Don't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting
E14 0060  5    with sauces. Clean it meticulously in boiling water
E14 0070  2    and detergent, rinse thoroughly.
E14 0070  6       Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches
E14 0080  8    in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit.
E14 0090  5    Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood
E14 0100  2    for heating vegetables, sauces and such.
E14 0100  8       Don't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of
E14 0110 10    aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface
E14 0120  5    of steaks and chops. Sear on both sides then cover
E14 0130  2    meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest
E14 0130 10    results.
E14 0140  1       Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test
E14 0140 10    them. If doubtful about a steak, boldly cut it in half.
E14 0150  9    If necessary to replace both halves on grill, sear
E14 0160  6    cuts and allot extra time. For roasts, insert meat
E14 0170  2    thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone.
E14 0170 11    Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving
E14 0180  8    spit or hit the coals.
E14 0190  1       Don't practice a new recipe on guests. Have a test-run
E14 0200  1    on the family first, to be sure timing and seasoning
E14 0200 11    are right.
E14 0210  1       Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend
E14 0210 12    to cook it. Keep it no longer than 36 hours before
E14 0220  8    cooking, and keep it in the coldest (but non-freezing)
E14 0230  4    compartment of the refrigerator.
E14 0230  8       Don't plan meals that are too complicated. Limit
E14 0240  8    yourself to good meat and drink, with bread, salad,
E14 0250  6    corn or potatoes as accessories. Keep the desserts
E14 0260  3    simple; fruit does nicely.
E14 0260  7       Do whatever kitchen work, such as fixing a salad,
E14 0270  7    preparing garlic bread, or making a marinade sauce,
E14 0280  4    ahead of time. When you start the outdoor performance,
E14 0290  1    you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips
E14 0290 10    into the kitchen. (This goes for getting a drink tray
E14 0300  8    ready, and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand
E14 0310  6    long before the party begins.)
E14 0311  1       Don't think you have to start with the most expensive
E14 0320 10    equipment in the world. The simplest grill (pan type)
E14 0330  7    or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef. You need
E14 0340  6    tongs to handle meat; long forks for turning potatoes
E14 0350  2    and corn; heavy foil on hand at all times. And lots
E14 0350 13    of hot pads!
E14 0360  2       Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so
E14 0360 12    that when fat from meat drips down and flares up, flames
E14 0370 11    cannot reach the meat.
E14 0380  2       Don't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates,
E14 0390  1    bowls, cups, saucers, and platters for outdoor use.
E14 0390  9    Made of the world's toughest unbreakable plastic, Melamine
E14 0400  5    dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and
E14 0410  5    dozens of colors. There is even one set that has "barbecue"
E14 0420  5    written on it.
E14 0420  8       Do without fancy tablecloths. It's cheaper to buy
E14 0430  6    Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor table. Or buy half
E14 0440  5    a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for
E14 0450  2    different kinds of barbecues. Oilcloth only costs about
E14 0450 10    79~c a yard for the very best. Tougher than plastic,
E14 0460  9    it wears well.
E14 0470  1       Don't forget- when you take to the hills or the
E14 0470 11    beach- that your cooler, which you might have used
E14 0480  8    for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard,
E14 0490  5    is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments.
E14 0500  1    There are many varieties of coolers and they serve
E14 0500 10    many purposes. With them, you can carry steaks and
E14 0510  8    hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures, and also get
E14 0520  4    your frozen food for stews and chowders, to the marina
E14 0530  2    or picnic, in A-1 condition.
E14 0530  8       Do use paper napkins; lots of them. Except when
E14 0540  6    you prepare "do it yourself" shish kebob or a lobster
E14 0550  5    roast. Then you'll want terry cloth towels for mopping
E14 0560  3    up.
E14 0560  4       Don't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes,
E14 0570  1    or seasonal. It's year-round, and everywhere. In the
E14 0570 10    winter, hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs
E14 0580 10    of the fireplace. Even use your portable electric or
E14 0590  6    gas grill in the winter, inside. Summertime supper,
E14 0600  2    outside, is a natural. You'll find, once your technique
E14 0610  1    is perfected, that you can cook on a boat with a simple
E14 0610 13    Bernz-O-Matic.
E14 0620  1       Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups. Get copper or earthenware
E14 0630  2    mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot. Be sure to
E14 0630 13    get a few more than you need. You will discover you
E14 0640 11    keep the sauce for basting meat in one, use six for
E14 0650  7    drinks, serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen-
E14 0660  3    and need one more to mix the salad dressing.
E14 0670  1       Don't forget the joys of a meal on the road. If
E14 0670 11    you travel over the vast U&S&A& you will, no doubt,
E14 0680  7    discover that feeding is an expensive business. Decide
E14 0690  4    in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to
E14 0700  2    work. You can take it with you **h a picnic bag, a
E14 0710  1    grill, a cooler for soft drinks and beer, and for frozen
E14 0720 11    convenience foods. Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings
E14 0730  7    and evenings; or just evenings. Turn off at any one
E14 0740  6    of the marked picnic areas (gasoline companies have
E14 0750  2    touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national
E14 0750 10    parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities)
E14 0760  8    and- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up,
E14 0770  6    hamburger, buns, an array of relishes, and fresh fruit-
E14 0780  4    your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant, and
E14 0790  2    100% more fun. You need a little stove, a coffee pot
E14 0790 13    and a stew pot; maybe a skillet, a basket of essentials
E14 0800  9    like salt, pepper, plates, forks, knives and a can
E14 0810  6    opener. As you pull out of your motel or national park
E14 0820  3    home-for-the-night, visit a market and buy just what
E14 0820 14    you need for the next meal. For 25~c load up the cooler
E14 0830 12    with ice and keep cool pop in the car.
E14 0850  1    #SIMPLE MEAT DISHES#
E14 0850  4    SPICE is a fact of life in the U&S&A&. You only have
E14 0860  8    to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean.
E14 0870  6    Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue
E14 0880  2    basics- cervelat, salami, Vienna sausages, mettwurst,
E14 0890  1    bratwurst, bockwurst, knackwurst, Bologna, pepperoni,
E14 0890  6    blutwurst- and you have a long list of easy specialties.
E14 0900  9    Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes, a bit
E14 0910  6    of green pepper, a fresh white mushroom- any one of
E14 0920  6    these spiced meats makes a man a cook, and a meal a
E14 0920 18    feast.
E14 0930  1       Sure, for the most of us, a frankfurter is the favorite.
E14 0930 12    A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St&
E14 0940 10    Louis, around 1883 served his sausages (grilled) and
E14 0950  7    mustard to his fancy customers. So that his customers
E14 0960  5    should not soil their hands, Feuchtwanger issued white
E14 0970  2    gloves. Discovery that the gloves frequently left with
E14 0970 10    the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat
E14 0980 10    come upon a compromise. He had a bakery make buns sized
E14 0990  8    to fit his franks. Years later, franks-in-buns were
E14 1000  5    accepted as the "first to go" at the New York Polo
E14 1010  3    Grounds.
E14 1010  4       The nations's number one picnic treat is the skinless
E14 1020  4    frankfurter- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or,
E14 1030  1    more sedately, charcoal broiled on a portable grill.
E14 1030  9    Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease
E14 1040 10    of preparation. To make the picnic frank come close
E14 1050  5    to perfection, remember these tips:
E14 1060  2       -Score each frankfurter in four or five places about
E14 1060 11    a third of the way through. This permits the juices
E14 1070  8    to permeate the meat during cooking.
E14 1080  1       -Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank
E14 1090  1    as are buns. Bring along the conventional ones- catsup,
E14 1090 10    pickle relish, mustard, mayonnaise- plus a few extras,
E14 1100  7    such as tangy barbecue sauce, chive cream cheese, or
E14 1110  6    horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.
E14 1120  2       -Using a portable grill permits you to toast the
E14 1120 11    buns, too. Watch closely while browning them, as it
E14 1130  9    doesn't take long.
E14 1140  2       -An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating
E14 1140 10    the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey,
E14 1150  9    lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic. Broil
E14 1160  6    or toast as usual.
E14 1160 10       Contrary to popular opinion, "a la mode" doesn't
E14 1170  7    mean "with ice cream"- it just means, in the latest
E14 1180  9    style. Here are a couple of the latest, highly styled
E14 1190  3    ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard!
E14 1195  1    You'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as
E14 1200  9    their mouths watering!

E15 0010  1    _NOTE:_
E15 0010  2       Directions are written for those who have had previous
E15 0020  1    experience in making pottery. Instructions for preparing
E15 0020  8    clay, drying, glazing and firing are not given.
E15 0030  7    #EQUIPMENT:#
E15 0030  8    Basic pottery studio equipment. Wooden butter molds
E15 0040  6    and cookie presses.
E15 0040  9    #MATERIALS:#
E15 0050  1    Ceramic modeling clay: red, white or buff. Stoneware
E15 0050  9    clay for tiles. Glazes, one-stroke ceramic colors,
E15 0060  8    stains, cones as indicated in the individual instructions.
E15 0070  5    #GENERAL DIRECTIONS:#
E15 0070  7    Use well-wedged clay, free of air bubbles and pliable
E15 0090  7    enough to bend without cracking. Clean wooden molds
E15 0100  5    and presses thoroughly; they must be free of oil, wax
E15 0110  5    and dust.
E15 0110  7    _PRESSING DESIGNS:_
E15 0110  9       The size of wooden mold will determine the amount
E15 0120  6    of clay needed. Roll clay to thickness indicated in
E15 0130  3    individual instructions. Whenever possible, use the
E15 0140  1    wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay. When mold
E15 0140 11    has more than one design cavity, make individual paper
E15 0150  6    patterns. Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay
E15 0160  5    and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position
E15 0170  1    (cut more pieces than required for project to make
E15 0170 10    allowance for defects; experiment with defects for
E15 0180  6    decoration techniques of glazes and colors). Place
E15 0190  4    the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design
E15 0200  2    side of wooden mold. To obtain clear impression of
E15 0200 11    mold, press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity,
E15 0210  8    starting at center and working to outer edges. Trim
E15 0220  5    excess clay away from outer edges. Check thickness
E15 0230  1    of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface
E15 0230 11    with a little water and adding small pieces of clay.
E15 0240  8    Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place
E15 0250  5    without locking in air bubbles. Allow project to stand
E15 0260  4    for about five minutes (if wooden press mold is a good
E15 0270  1    antique, do not leave clay in too long as the dampness
E15 0270 12    may cause mold to crack).
E15 0280  3       To release clay from mold, place hands in a cupped
E15 0290  1    position around project; gently lift the edge on far
E15 0290 10    side, then continue to release edge completely around
E15 0300  6    mold. Slight tapping on the underside of mold will
E15 0310  5    help release the clay, but too much agitation will
E15 0320  1    cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with
E15 0320 11    removal of clay from mold. Place a piece of plaster
E15 0330  8    wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat,
E15 0340  5    clay and mold in one action. This will prevent the
E15 0350  2    clay from twisting or bending, causing warping when
E15 0350 10    fired. Place project on table and carefully lift the
E15 0360  8    mold off. Study surface of clay for defects or desired
E15 0370  5    corrections. If clay is slightly out of shape, square
E15 0380  2    straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed
E15 0380 10    against opposite sides, or smooth round pieces with
E15 0390  8    damp fingers. if the background of design is too smooth,
E15 0400  6    or you wish to create a wood-grained effect, it may
E15 0410  3    be added at this time with a dull tool such as the
E15 0410 15    handle of a fine paintbrush. Make slight, smooth grooves
E15 0420  9    rather than cuts for the texture (cuts could cause
E15 0430  7    air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters
E15 0440  4    in the glaze during firing). Leave the clay on plaster
E15 0450  2    board to dry slowly, covered lightly with a loose piece
E15 0450 12    of plastic or cloth to prevent warping.
E15 0460  6    #RECTANGULAR TILES#
E15 0460  8    (opposite page, right top): Stoneware clay was used.
E15 0470  7    Clay was rolled to 1/4'' thickness. Back of clay scored
E15 0480  6    or roughened for proper gripping surface. No bisque
E15 0490  4    firing. glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white stoneware
E15 0500  2    glaze (no glaze on sides or bottom). Decorated on unfired
E15 0510  1    glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors; raised
E15 0510 11    details of designs were colored in shades of yellow-green,
E15 0520  9    blue-green, brown and pink. Tiles were fired once to
E15 0530  7    cone 05.
E15 0530  9    #ROUND PLAQUE#
E15 0530 11    (opposite page, bottom): White clay was used, rolled
E15 0540  8    to 1/4'' thickness. Bisque fired to cone 05. Stained
E15 0550  7    with Jacquelyn's ceramic unfired stain, polished, following
E15 0560  4    manufacturer's directions. Opaque cantaloupe and transparent
E15 0570  3    wood brown were used. No further firing.
E15 0570 10    #PAPERWEIGHT#
E15 0580  1    (opposite page, top left): Red clay was used, rolled
E15 0590  1    1/2'' thick. Mold was used as pattern and clay cut
E15 0600 10    by holding knife at about 45` angle, to form an undercut,
E15 0610  9    making base smaller than the pattern top. While clay
E15 0620  5    is still pressed in mold, press three equally spaced
E15 0630  2    holes 1/4'' deep, using pencil eraser, in bottom of
E15 0630 11    clay to allow for proper drying and firing. Paperweight
E15 0640  9    may be personalized on back while clay is leather hard.
E15 0650  8    Bisque fired to cone 05. Unglazed.
E15 0651  1    #JARS WITH LIDS#
E15 0660  1    (opposite page, top left): Remove wooden design head
E15 0670  3    from bowl of butter mold. Fill small hole in bowl with
E15 0670 14    clay. Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid
E15 0680 10    (see Fig& 1, opposite page). Measurements for rectangular
E15 0690  3    pattern piece ~A are obtained by measuring inside circumference
E15 0700  5    and depth of butter mold bowl. Pattern for circular
E15 0710  4    base piece ~B is diameter of ~A. Use wooden design
E15 0720  2    head of mold for pattern ~C; pattern ~D for lid fits
E15 0730  1    over top diameter of ~A. Pattern for inner lid piece
E15 0730 11    ~E fits inside ~A. Jars are assembled in bowl of butter
E15 0740 10    mold.
E15 0740 11       Use white or buff clay, rolled to 3/16'' thickness.
E15 0750  9    Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with
E15 0760  9    knife in vertical position. Place clay pieces on wall
E15 0770  5    board.
E15 0770  6       To assemble jar, put paper pattern ~B for base in
E15 0780  5    bottom of mold and clay disk ~B on top. Line sides
E15 0790  2    of mold with paper pattern ~A. Bevel and score ends
E15 0790 12    of clay piece ~A so that they overlap about 1/2'' and
E15 0800 10    make even thickness. Place clay piece ~A inside; use
E15 0810  7    slip to join overlapped ends together. Join ~B to bottom
E15 0820  6    of ~A, scoring and reinforcing with clay coil. Trim
E15 0830  4    excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside while
E15 0840  2    assembling lid.
E15 0840  4       To assemble lid, press clay piece ~C in cavity of
E15 0850  4    wooden design head. Press clay into mold as instructed
E15 0860  1    in General Directions. Score plain side of ~C and leave
E15 0860 11    in mold. Score one side of disk ~D, join to ~C; score
E15 0870 11    other side of ~D and one side of disk ~E and join as
E15 0880 10    before. While assembled lid is still on design head,
E15 0890  6    gently but firmly press it on plaster board. If design
E15 0891  3    head has a deep cavity, clay lid will be quite thick
E15 0900  9    at this point; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4''
E15 0910  8    deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying
E15 0920  7    and firing. Check fit of lid on jar; if inner lid is
E15 0930  5    too big, trim to fit, allowing room for thickness of
E15 0940  2    glaze. Remove lid from head of mold. Remove jar from
E15 0940 12    mold. Place jar on plaster board with lid in place
E15 0950  9    to dry slowly. Bisque fire to cone 08 with lid on jar.
E15 0960  7       For an antique effect on jars, brush Creek-Turn
E15 0970  3    brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off. Glaze
E15 0970 13    with two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze.
E15 0980  9    The large jar was brushed with Creek-Turn green toner
E15 0990  6    and sponged off. Glaze with two coats of matt glazes
E15 1000  4    in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid. When
E15 1010  1    dry they were fired to cone 06-05.
E15 1010  9    #LITTLE FOLKS SET:#
E15 1010 12    (Made from modern wooden molds **f.) Roll white clay
E15 1030  4    to 3/16'' thickness.
E15 1040  1    _SALT AND PEPPER:_
E15 1040  4       Use mold to cut four side pieces. For top and bottom
E15 1050  4    pieces, use short end of mold as measurement guide.
E15 1050 13    Press the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold.
E15 1060 10    Trim excess clay from rim of mold. Cut beveled edge
E15 1080  6    on the long sides of clay at a 45` angle to miter corners.
E15 1090  4    Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold; place
E15 1100  2    design-side up on plaster board. Make all four sides.
E15 1100 12    Cut clay top and base pieces; place on plaster board.
E15 1110  9    Allow all pieces to become leather hard before constructing
E15 1120  6    shaker.
E15 1120  7    _TO ASSEMBLE:_
E15 1130  1       Construct sides, bottom and top as for box, using
E15 1130 10    slip on scored edges and coils of clay to reinforce
E15 1140  7    seams. Join the four sides together first, then add
E15 1150  4    the base; add top last. Use water on finger to smooth
E15 1160  1    seams and edges. Turn shaker upside down. Recess base
E15 1160 10    slightly to allow room for stopper. Cut hole in base
E15 1170  9    for cork stopper. Add holes in top, forming "~S" for
E15 1180  6    salt and "~P" for pepper. Set aside to dry thoroughly.
E15 1190  5    _SUGAR AND CREAMER:_
E15 1190  8       Cut a strip of clay for sides long enough and wide
E15 1200  8    enough for three impressions of mold design. Press
E15 1210  3    clay into cavity of one mold three times; bevel overlapping
E15 1220  1    ends for splice joint, score beveled edges. Form clay
E15 1220 10    strip into a cylinder; use slip to join scored ends.
E15 1230 10    Place cylinder on a disk of clay slightly larger than
E15 1240  8    cylinder. Score bottom edge of cylinder and join to
E15 1250  4    disk with slip. Trim away excess clay; reinforce seam
E15 1260  2    with a coil of clay. This will form the sugar bowl.
E15 1260 13    Make creamer the same.
E15 1270  3       Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' wide
E15 1280  1    and 3-1/2'' long. To add handle, place a wooden dowel
E15 1280 12    against the inside wall of creamer. Score outside of
E15 1290  9    container where handle ends will be joined. Bend handle;
E15 1310  2    press scored handle ends firmly in place using dowel
E15 1320  4    to reinforce container while pressing; use slip to
E15 1330  1    join. To form spout, between two designs, dampen area
E15 1330 10    slightly and gently push clay outward. Make lid for
E15 1340  8    sugar bowl the same as jar lids, omitting design disk.
E15 1341  4    Cut a notch in lid for spoon handle if desired. Set
E15 1360  2    aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl.
E15 1360 10    _VASES:_
E15 1360 11       Make same as salt and pepper shakers, leaving off
E15 1370  8    top pieces. Vases may be made into candles by filling
E15 1380  5    with melted wax and a wick.
E15 1390  1    _NAPKIN HOLDER:_
E15 1390  1       Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each
E15 1390 13    about **f (long enough for three impressions of mold).
E15 1400  7    Press the two sides into cavity of one mold three times.
E15 1410  7    Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry to firm leather-hard
E15 1420  5    state. Score side edges of base; join sides and base
E15 1430  3    with slip and reinforce with coil. A cardboard pattern
E15 1430 12    cut to fit inside holder will help to prevent warping.
E15 1440  9    Place pattern inside holder; use three strips of clay
E15 1450  7    to hold in place (see Fig& 2, page 71). Do not use
E15 1460  7    wood as it will not shrink with the clay and would
E15 1470  2    cause breakage.
E15 1470  4       Let all projects dry slowly for several days. Clean
E15 1480  3    greenware. Bisque fire to cone 08. Inside of pieces
E15 1490  1    was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green
E15 1490 11    antique glaze. Outside was finished with Creek-Turn
E15 1500  7    brown toner brushed on and sponged off to give antique
E15 1510  5    finish. Fired to cone 06-05.
E15 1520  1    #CHANGING COLORS#
E15 1530  1    _TO CHANGE FROM ONE COLOR YARN TO ANOTHER:_
E15 1530  1       When changing from one color to another, whether
E15 1530  9    working on right or wrong side, pick up the new strand
E15 1540  8    from underneath dropped strand. Photograph shows the
E15 1550  3    wrong side of work with light strand being picked up
E15 1560  2    under dark strand in position to be purled.
E15 1570  1    _TO MEASURE WORK:_
E15 1570  1       Spread article on flat surface to required width
E15 1570  9    before measuring length at center.
E15 1580  4    #MEASURING ARMHOLE#
E15 1580  6    _TO MEASURE ARMHOLE:_
E15 1585  1       Mark row on which first stitches have been bound
E15 1590  4    off for armhole by drawing a contrasting colored thread
E15 1600  5    through it. Place work on a flat surface and smooth
E15 1610  3    out. Measure straight up from marked row. See illustration.
E15 1620  1    _TO INSERT MARKERS:_
E15 1620  4       When directions read "~sl a marker on needle", put
E15 1630  5    a small safety pin, paper clip, or commercial ring
E15 1640  2    marker on needle. In working, always slip marker from
E15 1640 11    one needle to another. To mark a row or stitch, tie
E15 1650 10    contrasting thread around end of row or stitch to be
E15 1660  7    marked.
E15 1660  8    #BACKSTITCHING SEAM#
E15 1670  1    _TO SEW SEAMS WITH BACKSTITCH:_
E15 1670  3       Most seams are sewn with backstitch, especially
E15 1680  1    on curved, slanted or loose edges. Pin right sides
E15 1680 10    of pieces together, keeping edges even and matching
E15 1690  6    rows or patterns. Thread matching yarn in tapestry
E15 1700  4    needle. Run end of yarn through several stitches along
E15 1710  2    edge to secure; backstitch pieces together close to
E15 1710 10    edge. Do not draw yarn too tight. See illustration.
E15 1730  1    _TO SEW IN SLEEVES:_
E15 1730  1       Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center
E15 1730  9    of sleeve cap at shoulder seam. Ease in any extra fullness
E15 1740  7    evenly around. Backstitch seam.
E15 1750  1    #WEAVING SEAM#
E15 1750  3    _TO WEAVE SEAMS TOGETHER:_
E15 1750  7       Straight vertical edges, such as those at the back
E15 1760  8    seam of a sock, can be woven together invisibly. Thread
E15 1770  3    matching yarn in tapestry needle. Hold edges together,
E15 1780  2    right side up.
E16 0010  1       HOTEI is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and
E16 0010 13    every inch a family boat. Menfolk can ride in the forward
E16 0020 10    cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view. Youngsters
E16 0030  7    can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin
E16 0040  6    which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom, bunks for three,
E16 0050  2    galley and marine toilet. The gals can sun themselves
E16 0050 11    in the roomy aft cockpit. All are well distributed,
E16 0060  8    not crowded together near the stern. And with passenger
E16 0070  6    weight shifted forward, Hotei levels off for speed
E16 0080  4    under power of a Merc 800. The 80-~hp motor drives
E16 0090  1    her at 25 ~mph with six aboard!
E16 0090  8       With only two aboard, Hotei does better than 27
E16 0100  1    ~mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed
E16 0110  2    even in a three-foot chop. She also banks into a turn
E16 0110 14    like a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside
E16 0120 10    to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small
E16 0130  8    cabin cruiser. Nor is she a wet boat. We've been out
E16 0131  4    in five-foot waves and stayed dry.
E16 0140  1       A lot of thought went into storage space construction.
E16 0150  7    There's a large compartment in the forward cockpit
E16 0160  5    for charts and other items. The cabin has several shelves
E16 0170  4    for small items and storage under the bunks for water
E16 0171  2    skiis, life jackets, etc&. The aft cockpit has a **f
E16 0180  7    storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat.
E16 0190 10    On each side of the motor well there's storage for
E16 0200  5    battery, bumpers, line and spare props with six-gallon
E16 0210  3    gas tanks below. The well itself is designed to take
E16 0210 13    two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room
E16 0220 11    for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it.
E16 0230  7       Needless to say, you can't build Hotei in a couple
E16 0240  6    of weeks. Our building time was slightly over 400 hours-
E16 0250  4    but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom,
E16 0260  1    sink, head and hardware was under $800. A comparable
E16 0260 10    manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000. Consider
E16 0270  8    what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000
E16 0280  6    and your building time is well worth it. A Gator trailer,
E16 0290  3    Model 565, is used to transport the boat to the waterways.
E16 0300  1    This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but
E16 0300 11    it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in
E16 0310  9    a few years.
E16 0310 12       All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which,
E16 0320  8    in the dressed state you buy it, is about the 13/16-inch
E16 0330  8    thickness specified in the drawings. Therefore, the
E16 0340  2    lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens,
E16 0350  1    etc&, on a table saw. Besides flathead bronze screws,
E16 0350 10    silicon bronze Stronghold nails (made by Independent
E16 0360  6    Nail + Packing Co&, Bridgewater, Mass&) are used extensively
E16 0370  6    in assembly and Weldwood resorcinal glue is used in
E16 0380  6    all the joints.
E16 0380  9       Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings.
E16 0390  8    Start by laying out the six frames and the transom
E16 0400  5    on a level floor. Draw each outline in a different-color
E16 0410  1    chalk, one on top of the other. In this way you will
E16 0410 13    be able to detect any obvious mistakes.
E16 0420  7       The transom frame is made first with the joints
E16 0430  5    lapped, glued and fastened with one-inch, No& 12 Stronghold
E16 0440  3    nails. After notching it for the keelson, chines and
E16 0441  1    battens, the half-inch plywood transom is secured to
E16 0441 10    it with glue and the same type nails. All frames are
E16 0460  5    butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are
E16 0470  2    glued and nailed on each side of each joint, again
E16 0470 12    using the one-inch, No& 12 nails. The frames are notched
E16 0480  8    only for the keelson and the chines. If notched for
E16 0490  7    the battens, they would require more work, be weakened
E16 0500  3    and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge
E16 0510  1    water could flow through. Nowhere in the boat do the
E16 0510 11    frames come in contact with the plywood planking.
E16 0520  6       The jig is erected after the frames and transom
E16 0530  4    are complete. This is an important step because any
E16 0540  2    misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment
E16 0540  8    in the hull as you advance in construction. Be sure
E16 0550  8    all members are parallel, vertical and level as required.
E16 0560  6       After the frames and transom are set up on the jig
E16 0570  7    and temporarily braced, a piece of three-inch-wide
E16 0580  1    mahogany (only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch
E16 0580 11    thickness is used throughout) is butted between frames
E16 0590  8    one and two below the line of the keelson. The frames
E16 0600  6    are glued and screwed to this piece. The joints are
E16 0610  3    also reinforced on each side with small blocks set
E16 0610 12    in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed. It is
E16 0620  7    over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson
E16 0630  5    are spliced.
E16 0630  7       The keelson, made of two three-inch widths, is next
E16 0640  7    installed. The first piece is glued and screwed to
E16 0650  4    the frames and transom and the piece butted between
E16 0650 13    frames one and two. The second piece is in turn glued
E16 0660 11    and screwed to the first. Note, however, that it is
E16 0670  7    six inches shorter at the forward end. One-inch, No&
E16 0680  4    10 screws are used in both cases.
E16 0680 11       A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily
E16 0690 11    fastened to frame one. The stem is laminated from four
E16 0700  9    pieces. Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them
E16 0710  5    down the center of the thickness to make the four.
E16 0720  3    Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces
E16 0720 14    and bend them into place on the jig. The first two
E16 0730 11    pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson
E16 0740  7    and are glued and screwed to the brace between the
E16 0750  3    first two frames. The second two pieces lap over the
E16 0750 13    inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer
E16 0760 10    member. They're glued and screwed to the inner member
E16 0770  8    of the keelson. A number of ~C clamps hold the pieces
E16 0780  5    together on the jig until the glue sets.
E16 0790  1       All bottom battens are two inches wide. The side
E16 0790 10    ones are a half-inch narrower. The battens are carefully
E16 0800  6    fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all
E16 0810  5    frames. Glue and 1-1/2-inch, No& 10 screws are used.
E16 0820  3    Placement is important because the rear seat, bunks
E16 0820 11    and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many
E16 0830 11    of the side battens. With the exception of two battens,
E16 0840  7    all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed
E16 0850  5    after careful beveling. The chines go in the same way
E16 0860  2    except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch
E16 0860 13    wood for strength and easier bending.
E16 0870  4       Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can
E16 0880  4    be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a
E16 0880 14    simple jig. I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to
E16 0890 11    the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips. The
E16 0900  8    aluminum, flush against the battens, acted as a fairing
E16 0910  5    stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson
E16 0920  1    to the proper bevels easily. If you don't own a planer
E16 0920 12    and don't want to buy one, it's well worth renting.
E16 0930  9       The planking is five-ply, 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood
E16 0940  8    Royal Marine plywood. This can be obtained in 42-inch
E16 0950  7    widths 24 feet long. The 42-inch width leaves very
E16 0960  3    little waste. Four pieces are used. Plank the sides
E16 0960 12    first, using glue and one-inch, No& 12 Stronghold nails
E16 0970 10    at all battens, the stem and the transom. Another person
E16 0980  8    inside with a weight against each batten will help
E16 0990  5    in the fastening. The best procedure is to have a few
E16 1000  4    friends hold the planking in place while you mark it
E16 1000 14    off. Then trim the excess. I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig
E16 1010 11    made by Porter Cable for this job. It's good for cutting
E16 1020  9    all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade
E16 1030  8    at high ~rpm and does not chatter the plywood like
E16 1040  4    a saber saw.
E16 1040  7       When cut, the planking is clamped in place for a
E16 1050  5    final and careful trimming. Then it is marked on the
E16 1060  1    inside where it comes in contact with the transom,
E16 1060 10    frames, keelson and all the battens. It may then be
E16 1070  8    pre-drilled for the fastenings. The next step is to
E16 1080  5    remove it and spread glue where it has been marked
E16 1080 15    at the contact points. Then it is replaced and fastened.
E16 1090 10    The bottom planking is applied in the same manner.
E16 1100  7       After planking, the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas.
E16 1110  6    The spray rails are first glued on the outside and
E16 1120  3    fastened from the inside with screws. Then the chines
E16 1120 12    are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation.
E16 1130 11    Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails,
E16 1140 10    they are also rough-sanded in that area. The cloth
E16 1150  6    is laid on one half of the bottom at a time. A 50-inch
E16 1160  6    width is used on each side and it laps the keel line
E16 1170  1    by about three inches. Lay the cloth in place and trim
E16 1170 12    it to size. Then remove it and give the whole bottom
E16 1180  9    a coat of resin. When the resin has hardened, mix up
E16 1190  5    another batch with a pigment added if you wish. I used
E16 1200  3    bright red, mixing the pigment in thoroughly before
E16 1200 11    adding the hardener. Using a cheap brush, coat one
E16 1210  9    side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the
E16 1220  7    cloth. When the cloth is smooth, apply another coat
E16 1230  3    of resin, spreading it with a paint roller. Be sure
E16 1230 13    it is well saturated and then allow it to harden.
E16 1240  9       When the whole bottom has hardened, use a disk sander
E16 1250  7    to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line
E16 1260  5    and near the spray rail. Then lay a three-inch-wide
E16 1270  1    strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom
E16 1270 11    to the point of the stem. Before the resin has hardened,
E16 1280  8    screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline.
E16 1290  5    This protects the bottom in beaching. Fiberglas materials
E16 1300  3    are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co&, 1605 W&
E16 1310  3    Elizabeth ave&, Linden, N& J&. They will also supply
E16 1320  2    literature on application.
E16 1320  5       The hull is now turned over (with the help of about
E16 1330  7    seven friends) and placed in a level, well-braced position.
E16 1340  2    I set it on the Gator trailer. I laid three layers
E16 1350  1    of glass cloth on the inside of the stem, also installing
E16 1350 12    a bow eye at this time. For added strength, I also
E16 1360  9    fastened a small block on each side of every frame
E16 1370  6    and batten joint. Again, these blocks were set in resin-saturated
E16 1380  5    glass cloth and nailed.
E16 1380  9       After trimming off the excess on the frames and
E16 1390  8    transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at
E16 1400  5    a working height, the top of the side planking is installed.
E16 1410  1    This is made up of scraps left over from the sides
E16 1410 12    and bottom. These flaring parts really help to keep
E16 1420  8    the boat dry. When they're on, the top edges are planed
E16 1430  7    even with the sheer batten.
E16 1430 12       The sides of the motor well run from the bottom
E16 1440 10    battens to the top and from frame six to the transom,
E16 1450  6    forming a real strong transom brace. Note another piece
E16 1460  3    of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom
E16 1460 13    between these pieces.
E16 1470  3       The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood.
E16 1480  2    All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior
E16 1490  1    fir plywood. Most floor battens are glued and screwed
E16 1490 10    to the flooring. The exception is where the flooring
E16 1500  7    butts. These battens are glued and screwed to the frames.
E16 1510  6       With all deck battens in place, the bilge is cleaned
E16 1520  4    and painted up to the floor line. Use one coat of Firzite
E16 1530  2    and one coat of marine paint. Bottoms of the floorboards
E16 1530 12    are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in
E16 1540 10    place.
E16 1540 11       After the decking is on, the cabin sides are installed.
E16 1550 10    They're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as
E16 1560  8    illustrated. The windshield glass is shatterproof and
E16 1570  4    Plexiglas is used in the cabin.
E16 1570 10       Inside, bunks are framed up and installed as indicated.
E16 1580  9    A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one
E16 1590  8    under a removable section of the port bunk. The sink
E16 1600  5    in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the
E16 1610  2    head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the
E16 1610 13    bulkhead above the sink. For padding the seats and
E16 1620  8    bunks, I used Ensolite, Type ~M. Lightweight, non-absorbent,
E16 1630  4    fire resistant and dimensionally stable, it is easily
E16 1640  4    bonded to the wood with contact cement. Available in
E16 1650  2    **f sheets, it costs about a dollar a square foot.
E17 0010  1    You can build this vacation cottage yourself. It is
E17 0010 10    a full scale, small, but efficient house that can become
E17 0020  7    a year 'round retreat complete in every detail. Because
E17 0030  5    of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski,
E17 0040  2    you can build most of it in your own home workshop
E17 0050  1    in your spare time. Most of it is panelized and utilizes
E17 0050 12    standard materials, and requires the use of only simple
E17 0060  8    tools. On the following pages and in the following
E17 0070  6    issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation
E17 0080  3    cottage, from choosing the proper site to applying
E17 0080 11    the final trim.
E17 0095  1       In recognition of the growing trend for second homes,
E17 0100  1    or vacation cottages, we have designed this one specifically
E17 0100 10    with the family handyman in mind. It is a big project,
E17 0110 11    not to be taken lightly. But each step has been broken
E17 0120  7    down into easy stages, utilizing standard materials
E17 0130  3    and simple tools, well within the capabilities of the
E17 0140  1    handyman.
E17 0140  2    #THE THEORY#
E17 0140  4    The idea behind our design is modular units, or panelization.
E17 0150  3    Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes
E17 0160  2    and measurements of materials. Wall panels and structural
E17 0160 10    timbers are standard as are windows and doors, making
E17 0170  9    for a minimum of cutting. We have developed an ingenious
E17 0180  6    method of interlocking these so that you can make the
E17 0190  6    major part of your house in your own workshop, panel
E17 0200  2    by panel, according to plan. Thus, when you have prepared
E17 0200 12    your foundation and laid the floor, these can be trucked
E17 0210 10    to the site and erected with a small crew of friends
E17 0220  7    in a weekend. The roof timbers are precut and the panels
E17 0230  5    standard so that the house can be completely enclosed
E17 0240  1    in a matter of three or four days. Then you can do
E17 0240 13    the finishing touches at your leisure.
E17 0250  5    #A WARNING#
E17 0250  7    Due to the fact that building codes and regulations
E17 0260  4    vary so much throughout the country, the first thing
E17 0270  2    to do is to find out what, if any, they are. Close
E17 0270 14    to a large city they might even specify the size of
E17 0280  9    the nails used; in a remote section there might be
E17 0290  5    no restrictions at all. This can usually be found out
E17 0300  4    at the nearest town hall. At the same time check the
E17 0300 15    electrical, plumbing, and sanitary requirements, as
E17 0310  6    well as possible zoning regulations. Whether electricity
E17 0320  4    and public water and sewers are available or not, check

E17 0400  5    Plans Department.
E17 0400  7    #THE SITE#
E17 0400  9    Some general things to look for in a site, if you haven't
E17 0410 11    already bought one, are accessibility, water drainage,
E17 0420  4    and orientation. How are the roads, and how will they
E17 0430  5    stand up? Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property;
E17 0440  1    swampy areas or intermittent springs? A visit in the
E17 0440 10    early spring after a thaw will be very informative.
E17 0450  9    Note where the sun rises and sets, and ask which direction
E17 0460  7    the prevailing winds and storms come from. Will the
E17 0470  5    view be something you can live with? Don't worry too
E17 0480  3    much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up
E17 0480 13    alternative foundations later on.
E17 0490  4    #THE MATERIALS#
E17 0490  6    With this first issue we give you a list of the materials
E17 0500  9    needed to build the basic (~A version) and the expandable
E17 0510  5    (~B version). This will be for the shell of the house
E17 0520  5    only (roof, walls, and floor), and does not include
E17 0530  1    the carport or balcony. This will permit you to get
E17 0530 11    a rough estimate of how much the materials for the
E17 0540  9    shell will cost. Bear in mind that this does not include
E17 0550  6    interior panels for partitions, fancy flooring, appliances
E17 0560  3    and fixtures, electrical wiring, and plumbing, all
E17 0570  2    of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.
E17 0570 13       The wall panels are constructed of a framework of
E17 0580  9    standard **f and **f of a good grade, free from structural
E17 0590  7    faults. They should be as straight as possible, as
E17 0600  4    this will effect their ability to mesh properly when
E17 0610  1    the walls are erected. The outside surface of the solid
E17 0610 11    units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board
E17 0620  9    such as plywood, plastic coated panel board, high density
E17 0630  5    particle board, asbestos-cement board, or any other
E17 0640  3    product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your
E17 0640 10    building supply dealer. The inner panels do not have
E17 0650  9    to be weatherproof, and the choice will depend on the
E17 0660  7    quality of finish desired. All panel board comes in
E17 0670  4    standard **f foot size. It is recommended that panels
E17 0680  1    be both glued as well as nailed to the frame. The fixed
E17 0680 13    window panels with louvers should have a good grade
E17 0690  8    of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing
E17 0700  6    compound. The louvers are constructed as shown in the
E17 0710  4    detail, with a drop door for ventilation. There are
E17 0710 13    standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum
E17 0720  8    frames for those panels requiring them. The door panels
E17 0730  6    are designed to accommodate standard doors which should
E17 0740  4    be of exterior grade. The filler panels for the gable
E17 0750  1    ends are cut from full **f sheets as shown, leaving
E17 0750 11    no wastage. The battens covering the joints are of
E17 0760  7    **f stock and are applied after the walls are erected.
E17 0770  5    All nails should be rustproof, and aluminum is highly
E17 0780  2    recommended. Note: If 1/2-inch panel board is used
E17 0780 11    inside and out, or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the
E17 0790 12    other, and 1/8-inch glass is used, stock lumber in
E17 0800  6    **f, **f, and **f can be used in making the glass panels.
E17 0810  3    Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special
E17 0820  1    size lumber for the glass trim. In any case, there
E17 0820 11    is no special milling or rabbeting required for the
E17 0830  6    panels.
E17 0840  1       With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude
E17 0840  9    of cutting tools, fixtures, and attachments available,
E17 0850  6    the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool.
E17 0860  6    The drill press consists of a vertical shaft (spindle)
E17 0870  3    which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill
E17 0880  2    chuck, a tubular housing (quill) in which the spindle
E17 0880 11    is mounted, a head in which the quill is mounted, a
E17 0890 10    feed lever which moves the quill up or down, a power
E17 0900  7    source, and a movable table upon which the work is
E17 0910  2    placed. There is often a means of locking the quill
E17 0910 12    and, on larger presses, the table can be tilted.
E17 0920  7       The size of the press is usually expressed in terms
E17 0930  5    of chuck capacity (the maximum diameter tool shank
E17 0940  2    it will hold) or distance between the spindle center
E17 0940 11    and the column. A press with an 11 inch capacity lets
E17 0950 10    you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle.
E17 0960  8       A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity
E17 0970  5    has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done
E17 0980  1    at any angle. The head is mounted on a horizontal arm
E17 0980 12    that swivels on the supporting column to position the
E17 0990  7    drill bit instead of the work.
E17 1000  1    #SET-UP AND MAINTENANCE#
E17 1000  5    The drill press should be leveled and, depending on
E17 1010  2    whether it is a bench or floor model, bolted securely
E17 1010 12    to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor
E17 1020 10    with lag or expansion screws. This will reduce vibration
E17 1030  5    and increase accuracy.
E17 1030  8       A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of
E17 1040 11    wax paper will protect the polished surface of the
E17 1050  5    table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage
E17 1060  3    rusting of the column and quill. Presses not fitted
E17 1070  1    with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil
E17 1070 11    now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill.
E17 1080  7    The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting
E17 1090  4    with a clean rag or brush.
E17 1090 10       Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and
E17 1100  9    grease. Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of
E17 1110  4    two locking bolts and a movable motor mount. Keep the
E17 1120  2    belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when
E17 1120 12    pulled by hand; excess tension will only cause undue
E17 1130  8    wear on the motor and spindle bearings. Most drill
E17 1140  4    presses have a quill return spring that raises the
E17 1150  2    spindle automatically when the feed lever is released
E17 1150 10    and holds the quill in the raised position. The return
E17 1160  9    spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements
E17 1170  6    by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers
E17 1180  6    (to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released),
E17 1190  3    loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing
E17 1200  1    until the desired tension is achieved. Turning the
E17 1200  9    housing clockwise will reduce tension, counter-clockwise
E17 1210  6    will increase it.
E17 1210  9    #DON'T LOSE THE CHUCK KEY#
E17 1220  5    Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide
E17 1230  1    a socket for the chuck key; otherwise, you'll have
E17 1230 10    to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable
E17 1240  9    spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the
E17 1250  6    key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom
E17 1260  2    of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way
E17 1260 15    when not in use.
E17 1270  3    #FEEDS AND SPEEDS#
E17 1270  6    Drill speeds are important if you want a good job.
E17 1280  4    Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed,
E17 1290  1    depending on the material worked. On most drill presses,
E17 1290 10    it is impossible to get the exact speed, but you can
E17 1300  9    come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone
E17 1310  7    pulleys. You will find a chart giving the various speed
E17 1320  3    ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere
E17 1330  1    in the instruction booklet that came with the tool.
E17 1330 10    See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds.
E17 1340  8    Generally, the larger the tool and the harder the material,
E17 1350  7    the slower the speed.
E17 1350 11       Feed pressure is also of major importance. Too much
E17 1360  8    pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity
E17 1370  6    and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools.
E17 1380  4    Too light a feed, particularly with metal or other
E17 1380 13    hard material, causes overheating of the tool and burning
E17 1390  9    of the cutting edge. The best results will be obtained
E17 1400  8    by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure
E17 1410  6    that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate.
E17 1420  2    #COMMON DRILLING TOOLS#
E17 1420  5    There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill
E17 1430  5    holes. The most common are the twist drill, the solid
E17 1440  2    center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades, the
E17 1440  9    double spur bit, and the power wood bit. All will do
E17 1450 10    a good job if sharp, but the twist drills don't cut
E17 1460  5    quite as smoothly as the others, since they do not
E17 1470  3    have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before
E17 1470 12    actual boring starts.
E17 1480  3       The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting
E17 1490  1    large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size
E17 1490 12    discs by reversing the cutter blade. Since fly cutters
E17 1500  8    are one sided and not balanced, they should be used
E17 1510  6    at the slowest speed available, and fed very slowly
E17 1520  3    to avoid binding. Fly cutters can fool you into putting
E17 1530  1    your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to
E17 1530 13    avoid nicked fingers, keep your hands well out of the
E17 1540  8    way.
E17 1540  9    #SIMPLE HOLE DRILLING OPERATIONS#
E17 1550  1    When drilling all the way through a workpiece, always
E17 1550 10    place a piece of scrap wood underneath. This will not
E17 1560  9    only protect the work table, but also assure a clean
E17 1570  7    breakthrough. Another method of assuring a clean hole
E17 1580  4    is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through,
E17 1590  1    then drill half way with the dimensional bit, turn
E17 1590 10    the piece over, and finish from the other side. In
E17 1600  8    soft woods with pronounced grain, there is sometimes
E17 1610  4    a tendency for the hole to wander, due to the varying
E17 1620  1    hardness of the wood. In this case, drilling a small
E17 1620 11    pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve
E17 1630  9    accuracy.
E17 1630 10       When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth,
E17 1640  9    mark the depth on the side of the stock, then run the
E17 1650  7    bit down so that it is even with the mark. The depth
E17 1660  3    gauge rod can now be set, and any number of holes bored
E17 1660 15    to exact and identical depth.
E18 0010  1       The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in
E18 0010 10    Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects.
E18 0020  8    For their length, their types of construction, their
E18 0030  5    picturesque settings, and their literary associations,
E18 0040  2    they should be known and remembered. In this sequence
E18 0050  1    I shall write about them in the order of their erection.
E18 0050 12       The first bridge known to have been covered wholly
E18 0060  9    or in part,- and perhaps the most interesting one,
E18 0070  5    connected Newbury (now Newburyport) with Salisbury
E18 0080  2    Point. Its building was first proposed in 1791, when
E18 0080 11    a group of citizens, mostly Newburyport men, petitioned
E18 0090  8    the General Court for an act of incorporation. This
E18 0100  7    document began:
E18 0110  1    _"NO& 1 NEWBURY PORT, MAY 30TH, 1791_
E18 0110  7          "Whereas, a Bridge over Merrimack River, from
E18 0120  4    the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf, Esquire, in
E18 0130  3    Newbery, to Deer Island, and from said Island to Salisbury,
E18 0140  1    would be of very extensive utility, by affording a
E18 0140 10    safe Conveyance to Carriages, Teams and Travellers
E18 0150  3    at all seasons of the year, and at all Times of Tide.
E18 0160  7       "We, the Subscribers, do agree, that as soon as
E18 0170  5    a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this,
E18 0180  2    or a similar Writing, We will present a petition to
E18 0180 12    the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
E18 0190  8    praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic
E18 0200  9    the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build
E18 0210  6    such a Bridge, and a Right to demand a Toll equal to
E18 0220  5    that received at Malden Bridge, and on like Terms,
E18 0230  1    and if such an Act shall be obtained, then we severally
E18 0230 12    agree each with the others, that we will hold in the
E18 0240 10    said Bridge the several shares set against our respective
E18 0250  5    Names, the whole into two hundred shares being divided,
E18 0260  3    and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times
E18 0270  1    and in such Manners, as by the said proposed Corporation,
E18 0270 11    shall be directed and required".
E18 0280  5       This paper was signed by forty-five persons, subscribing
E18 0290  3    a total of two hundred shares.
E18 0290  9       A month later the General Court served notice to
E18 0300  8    the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built.
E18 0310  7    The matter was considered and reconsidered, and finally
E18 0320  3    opposed, but in spite of many objections, the Court
E18 0330  1    granted a charter on January 9, 1792. On November 26
E18 0330 11    of that year the bridge was completed and opened.
E18 0340  6       Timothy Palmer, who invented and later patented
E18 0350  4    the arch type of construction for wooden bridges, was
E18 0360  2    the genius who planned and supervised the building
E18 0360 10    of the Essex, or "Deer Island" bridge although the
E18 0370  7    actual work was carried out under the direction of
E18 0380  6    William Coombs, who received @ 300 as recompense.
E18 0390  1       This two-part bridge is best described by Rev& Timothy
E18 0400  1    Dwight, president of Yale College, in his "Travels
E18 0400  9    in New-England and New-York", published in New Haven
E18 0410  8    in 1821. He says of it:
E18 0420  3       "It consists of two divisions, separated by an island
E18 0430  1    at a small distance from the southern shore. The division
E18 0430 11    between the island and this shore, consists principally
E18 0440  8    of an arch; whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet,
E18 0450  8    and whose vortex is forty feet (it was actually 37
E18 0460  4    feet) above the high-water mark. In appearance and
E18 0470  1    construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge. The
E18 0470  8    whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty
E18 0480  8    feet and its breadth thirty-four. I have already mentioned
E18 0490  5    that Mr& Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor
E18 0500  4    of the arched bridges in this country. As Mr& Palmer
E18 0510  2    was educated to house-building only, and had never
E18 0510 11    seen a structure of this nature; he certainly deserves
E18 0520  8    not a little credit for the invention".
E18 0530  4       It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered
E18 0540  3    bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby
E18 0550  1    Rowley; that he moved with his parents to West Boxford
E18 0550 11    when he was sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed
E18 0560  8    to a builder and architect, Moody Spofford. It was
E18 0570  5    indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no
E18 0580  5    experience of bridge building should have applied the
E18 0590  1    principle of the arch, which appears in his famous
E18 0590 10    bridges at Portsmouth, Haverhill, and Philadelphia.
E18 0600  4       The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was
E18 0610  5    not covered. As far as we know, no American bridge
E18 0620  2    had been thus protected in 1792. Richard S& Allen is
E18 0620 12    the authority for the statement that the northern section
E18 0630  9    was probably roofed by 1810. Its original appearance
E18 0640  6    is shown in an engraving published in the "Massachusetts
E18 0650  4    Magazine" in May 1793, which is reproduced herewith
E18 0660  2    (Fig& 1). A brief description accompanying the picture
E18 0670  1    says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons
E18 0670 10    of timber. Between the abutments on the Newbury shore
E18 0680  7    and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span
E18 0690  5    or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north shore
E18 0700  2    of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an
E18 0700 12    arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw
E18 0710 11    forty feet long.
E18 0710 14       A dinner and celebration in honor of this piece
E18 0720  9    of engineering took place July 4, 1793, in a tavern
E18 0730  7    erected by the corporation on the island. It is said
E18 0740  4    that the eccentric Timothy Dexter, who was one of the
E18 0750  1    first share-holders, stood on the table and made a
E18 0750 11    speech worthy of the occasion. The "Essex Journal"
E18 0760  5    says that he "delivered an oration on the bridge, which
E18 0770  5    for elegance of style, propriety of speech or force
E18 0780  3    of argument, was truly Ciceronian". The reporter must
E18 0780 11    have written this with tongue in cheek, because Dexter's
E18 0790  9    oration could hardly be understood; and, although he
E18 0800  7    later explained that he was talking French, it seems
E18 0810  5    rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys
E18 0820  3    of the evening.
E18 0820  6       The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth
E18 0830  4    the cost of construction, although it proved to be
E18 0830 13    twice what was estimated in the beginning. It stood
E18 0840  9    in its original form until 1882. The southern half,
E18 0850  6    however, on account of its underbracing, was considered
E18 0860  3    by boat owners a menace to navigation. In 1810 it was
E18 0870  2    torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge.
E18 0870 11    This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted
E18 0880  7    by James Finley of Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Timothy
E18 0890  4    Palmer had general supervision of the work.
E18 0900  4       An advertisement in the "Newburyport Herald", December
E18 0910  2    21, 1810, shows Palmer in a new light as an expert
E18 0910 13    on chain bridges. It reads:
E18 0920  4    _"CHAIN BRIDGES_
E18 0920  6          "Information is hereby given that Mr& Timothy
E18 0930  7    Palmer of Newburyport, Mass& has agreed to take charge
E18 0940  6    of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge,
E18 0950  3    in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont,
E18 0960  1    Rhode Island, and Connecticut, so far as relates to
E18 0960 10    the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain
E18 0970  9    Bridges.
E18 0970 10       "Mr& Palmer will attend to any applications relating
E18 0980  8    to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site,
E18 0990  7    and lay out and superintend the work, or recommend
E18 1000  4    a suitable person to execute it.
E18 1000 10       John Templeman
E18 1020  1       "Approved, Timothy Palmer"
E18 1020  4       This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden
E18 1030  6    arch on the Salisbury end. It fell, February 6, 1827,
E18 1040  4    carrying with it a horse and wagon, two men and four
E18 1050  1    oxen. The horse and men were saved, but the oxen drowned.
E18 1050 12    In spite of this catastrophe, the bridge was rebuilt
E18 1060  8    on the same plan and opened again on July 17, 1827.
E18 1070  6    This second chain bridge was 570 feet long, had two
E18 1080  3    thirty-foot towers and a draw, and a double roadway.
E18 1090  1       The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868,
E18 1090 10    when the County Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack
E18 1100  7    bridges as highways.
E18 1110  1       Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous
E18 1120  1    use, the old covered, wooden bridge that spans the
E18 1120 10    Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive
E18 1130  7    part in the week-long observance of the first land
E18 1140  5    battle of the Civil War at its home site, May 28th
E18 1150  2    to June 3rd. Colonel Frederick W& Lander, impersonated,
E18 1160  1    will again make his break-neck ride down the steep
E18 1160 11    declivity of Talbott's (now College) Hill and thunder
E18 1170  6    across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F& Kelley's
E18 1180  4    (West) Virginia Infantry, then swarming through the
E18 1190  3    streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates.
E18 1200  1    He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops-
E18 1200 11    thus the old bridge has another distinction; that of
E18 1210  8    being the first such structure secured by force of
E18 1220  5    arms in the war of the '60s.
E18 1220 12       The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the
E18 1230  9    elements, war, fire, and floods, as well as injuries
E18 1240  7    incident to heavy traffic, for more than a hundred
E18 1250  3    years. Twice during the Civil War it was saved from
E18 1250 13    destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and
E18 1260  9    prayers of a local minister. It still stands as a monument
E18 1270  7    to the engineering skills of the last century and still
E18 1280  5    serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on
E18 1290  2    U&S& Route 250- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike.
E18 1300  1    It is one of the very few, if not the only surviving
E18 1300 13    bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U&S&
E18 1310 11    highway system, thus it is far more than a relic of
E18 1320  9    the horse and buggy days.
E18 1320 14       This covered, wooden bridge is so closely identified
E18 1330  8    with the first action in the early morning of June
E18 1340  7    3, 1861, and with subsequent troop movements of both
E18 1350  3    armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part
E18 1360  1    and parcel of the war story. So frequently has pictures
E18 1360 11    of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications
E18 1370  8    that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers
E18 1380  7    Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in
E18 1390  3    West Virginia.
E18 1390  5       Completed and opened for traffic in 1852, the bridge
E18 1400  5    was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his
E18 1410  3    brother, Eli, of Beverly. The Chenoweth brothers were
E18 1410 11    experienced bridge builders, and against the competition
E18 1420  7    of other, and better known, bridge designers and builders
E18 1430  6    they had constructed nine of the covered, wooden bridges
E18 1440  5    on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years
E18 1450  4    before, as well as many other bridges for several counties.
E18 1460  1    The Philippi bridge, however, was the Chenoweth master
E18 1460  9    piece, with its 139-foot, dual lane, span- and it stands
E18 1470 11    today as a monument to its builders. Never rebuilt,
E18 1480  6    the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers,
E18 1490  5    a concrete floor, and a walk-way along the upper side
E18 1500  2    in order to care for modern traffic.
E18 1500  9       During the war it was in constant use by the wagon
E18 1510  8    trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton
E18 1520  4    to the troops operating in the interior. Union soldiers
E18 1530  2    at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from
E18 1530 12    the rain or other inclement weather, and some of them
E18 1540 10    left momentoes of their stay by carving their names
E18 1550  6    and small tokens on its walls and beams.
E18 1560  1       But what the elements could not do was seriously
E18 1560 10    threatened when Brigadier General William E& (Grumble)
E18 1570  7    Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden
E18 1580  7    raid in May, 1863. General Jones was fresh from a long
E18 1590  7    series of bridge burnings, including the long bridge
E18 1600  3    at Fairmont, and, after seeing a great drove of horses
E18 1610  1    and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge,
E18 1610 10    he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and
E18 1620  7    around it. Reverend Joshual Corder, a Baptist minister,
E18 1630  4    gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies, to
E18 1640  2    call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure;
E18 1640 13    he reasoned and argued, pointing out that Jones or
E18 1650  9    other Confederate commanders would need it should troops
E18 1660  7    pass that way in retreat. Jones relented, he did not
E18 1670  5    order his men to apply the torch- the drove of livestock
E18 1680  2    was driven up the valley, via Beverly, and across the
E18 1680 12    mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army, while
E18 1690  9    Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join
E18 1700  6    forces with Imboden.
E18 1710  1       Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union
E18 1710  9    soldiers planned to destroy it, after filling its two
E18 1720  8    lanes with hay and straw- but for what reason is not
E18 1730  6    recorded nor remembered, certainly not because of pressure
E18 1740  3    from an opposing Confederate force. On the second occasion
E18 1750  1    it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers
E18 1750 12    from their purpose.
E18 1760  2       Centering around this historic old structure, a
E18 1760  9    group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have
E18 1770  8    organized and planned a week-long series of events,
E18 1780  7    beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd,
E18 1790  4    to observe most appropriately the centennial of the
E18 1800  2    first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi.
E19 0010  1       It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired
E19 0010 13    a swimming pool- eight enlightening, vigorous, rigorous,
E19 0020  5    not wholly unrewarding years. We have learned a lot-
E19 0030  7    a dash of hydrochemistry here, a bit about plumbing
E19 0040  4    and pump-priming there. We have had sound grounding
E19 0050  1    in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove
E19 0050 11    school of diplomacy. We have become amateur insurance
E19 0060  6    experts and fine-feathered yard birds. True, our problems
E19 0070  5    have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors
E19 0080  3    have built their own pools, thereby diluting our spectacular
E19 0090  1    attractions. But problems cling to pools, as any pool
E19 0090 10    owner knows. So our innate generosity of spirit prompts
E19 0100  8    us to share our trials, errors and solutions with any
E19 0110  6    who are taking the pool plunge for the first time-
E19 0120  3    in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.
E19 0130  1    #WHERE TO PUT IT#
E19 0130  5    Position may not be everything, but in the case of
E19 0140  3    a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties, social
E19 0140 11    and/or physical. We speak from varying viewpoints.
E19 0150  7    One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near
E19 0160  7    the house. The other has his pool far away from the
E19 0170  3    house in a field high on a hill.
E19 0170 11       If you are dreaming of a blue, shimmering pool right
E19 0180  7    outside your living room windows, close your eyes firmly
E19 0190  5    and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children,
E19 0200  2    damp towels, squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated
E19 0210  1    plastic toys. You are likely to be nearer the truth.
E19 0210 11       You can also see that the greater the proximity
E19 0220  8    of the pool to your main living quarters, the greater
E19 0230  4    the chance for violation of family privacy, annoying
E19 0240  1    noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude.
E19 0240 11    On the other hand, out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind
E19 0250 13    when children cannot be easily observed and you have
E19 0260  8    to make a long trek to reach the pool.
E19 0270  2       Another dilemma: As picturesque as a sylvan pond
E19 0270 10    in the forest may be, trees offer a leaf and root hazard
E19 0280 12    to the well-being of a pool. Yet a grassy approach
E19 0290  8    can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the
E19 0300  5    grass is mowed.
E19 0300  8       As in choosing a wife, it is only sensible to consider
E19 0310  6    also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather
E19 0320  4    as well as in good. In the colder climes, for instance,
E19 0330  1    you will have to live through the many unglamorous
E19 0330 10    winter months when your pool will hardly look its best.
E19 0340  8    It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt
E19 0350  4    hay, or an ice floe studded with logs. Even a neat,
E19 0360  2    plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold.
E19 0360 12    (We do, however, recommend those patented covers to
E19 0370  7    prevent both people and junk- flora and fauna generally-
E19 0380  7    from accidentally wintering in the pool.)
E19 0390  2       Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all
E19 0390 12    counts. Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent
E19 0400 10    by the shape and size of your land. But if space and
E19 0410  9    money are no problem and small children are not on
E19 0420  4    hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have
E19 0430  1    your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate
E19 0430 10    environs of the house. And a good several feet around
E19 0440 10    the pool should be neither greensward nor woods, but
E19 0450  5    good hard pavement.
E19 0450  8       The placement of your pool, however, will not of
E19 0460  8    itself solve the two major problems of pool owning-
E19 0470  4    those that involve your social life and those pertaining
E19 0480  1    to safety. Coping with them demands stern discipline-
E19 0480  9    of yourself as well as of your family, neighbors, friends
E19 0490  9    and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet.
E19 0500  7       Eight years ago while we were going through the
E19 0510  4    mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were each
E19 0520  2    solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening
E19 0520 12    home-comings to a cool family collected around the
E19 0530  8    pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord
E19 0540  6    and master's delectation. But not even our first pool-side
E19 0550  1    gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.
E19 0560  1    We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion
E19 0560  9    right in our own backyards. Our respective families
E19 0570  5    looked as if they had quadrupled. Had we taken a lien
E19 0580  6    on a state park? Not at all. We had merely been discovered
E19 0590  2    by the pool sharks. We were in business!
E19 0590 10       From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen
E19 0600  9    was a short step- no more than the change from city
E19 0610 10    clothes to trunks. Nai^ve of us, maybe, but the results
E19 0620  5    of our impulsive invitations to "come over next summer
E19 0630  3    and swim in our new pool" were both unexpected and
E19 0630 13    unsettling.
E19 0640  1    #OUR BOOK OF ETIQUETTE#
E19 0640  5    After the first few weeks, it was obvious that rules
E19 0650  4    had to be made, laid down and obeyed- even if our popularity
E19 0660  2    ratings became subnormal as a result. So rules we made,
E19 0670  1    in unabashed collusion. Since our viewpoints in this
E19 0670  9    respect coincided precisely, we present the fruits
E19 0680  6    of our efforts herewith as a single social code for
E19 0690  4    pool owners.
E19 0690  6       First and foremost: No one- no, not anyone- in the
E19 0700  6    family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his
E19 0710  3    or her own circle. Just short of forty lashes we finally
E19 0710 14    managed to coerce our children to this view. Their
E19 0720  9    friends and ours are welcome to share the pool, but
E19 0730  7    on our terms and at our times.
E19 0740  1       No friends are to arrive without an invitation or
E19 0740 10    without at least telephoning beforehand.
E19 0750  2       No ringers, either- even if they are trailing legitimate
E19 0760  2    invitees. We want to know when the Potlatches telephone
E19 0770  1    exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that
E19 0770 11    we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like
E19 0780 10    Coney Island in August.
E19 0790  1       No young children may come without adults except
E19 0790  9    for a specific, organized, chaperoned party. And accompanying
E19 0800  6    adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye
E19 0810  7    on their responsibilities. A gaggle of gabbling mothers,
E19 0820  4    backs to the pool, is no safeguard.
E19 0820 11       No bottle pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our
E19 0830  8    lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our
E19 0840  7    bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run.
E19 0850  3    (Sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant
E19 0850 11    took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently
E19 0860  9    became the neighborhood free-drink stop.)
E19 0870  4       We designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood
E19 0880  3    teen-agers might swim at definite hours. This has saved
E19 0890  2    us from constant requests seven days a week and made
E19 0890 12    us feel less brutal to the young "less fortunate" than
E19 0900  8    ours.
E19 0900  9       We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon
E19 0910  7    swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend
E19 0920  5    guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch
E19 0930  2    en famille. We gently usher them to an island of tables
E19 0940  1    and chairs strategically placed on the far side of
E19 0940 10    the pool where they can amuse each other until we get
E19 0950  9    ready to merge sides.
E19 0950 13       All dressing (undressing to be more exact) must
E19 0960  8    be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers'
E19 0970  6    homes. (To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping
E19 0980  3    parade through your house, it is a good idea to have
E19 0980 14    a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct
E19 0990 10    outdoor route between the pool and the parking area.)
E19 1000  7    We do, however, provide a limited number of extra suits,
E19 1010  5    mainly for children, and we stock extra towels and
E19 1020  2    a few inexpensive bathing conveniences. Life-preservers,
E19 1020  9    the buckle-on kapok-filled kind, are held in readiness,
E19 1030  8    too, for the very young.
E19 1040  1    #PRESERVING LIFE AND LIMB#
E19 1040  5    Safety rules, of course, are more important than all
E19 1050  4    the others put together.
E19 1050  8       In many localities, now, the law requires all pools
E19 1060  7    to be fenced, usually to a minimum height of 5 feet.
E19 1070  5    But fenced or unfenced, no pool-side is the place for
E19 1080  2    running or horseplay. We allow no underwater endurance
E19 1080 10    contests, either, or inexpert versions of water polo.
E19 1090  8       Diving boards must have non-skid surfaces (coco
E19 1100  6    matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots
E19 1110  3    quickly, but grit-impregnated paints are excellent).
E19 1110 10    And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap,
E19 1120 10    either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge.
E19 1130  8       Our pools also have wide, shallow steps- for the
E19 1140  3    benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced
E19 1150  3    to the water with far greater safety than a ladder
E19 1150 13    affords.
E19 1160  1       All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from
E19 1160 11    the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of
E19 1170  9    plastic or metal cups.
E19 1180  1       When you first acquire a pool, we earnestly recommend-
E19 1180 10    for your own mental health- a good long chat with your
E19 1190 10    insurance agent. You should be prepared to cope with
E19 1200  7    any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow
E19 1210  4    ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.
E19 1220  1       Soignee pools, alas, do not just happen. They are
E19 1220 10    the result of a constant and careful contest with the
E19 1230 10    elements. Unless you want to make your wife a pool
E19 1240  9    widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours
E19 1250  3    nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and feeding-
E19 1260  1    from ~pH content to filtering and vacuuming- is best
E19 1260 10    left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service.
E19 1270  9    Of course, if your pool is close to the house, your
E19 1280  8    wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores (you
E19 1290  3    hope). Or you can make pool care the price of swimming
E19 1300  1    for teen-agers. Even so, every pool owner, in case
E19 1300 11    of emergency, should have some idea of what makes things
E19 1310  9    work. A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders
E19 1320  6    may well be appreciated in a future crisis.
E19 1330  2    #PRESERVING THE POOL#
E19 1330  5    A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool
E19 1340  5    poison green overnight. You need more chlorine. The
E19 1350  1    walls feel slippery. You need algaecide. With or without
E19 1350 10    professional help, you will have to be able to do some
E19 1360 11    of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time
E19 1370  7    pool nurse.
E19 1370  9       You should see to it that the trap, the dirt-catcher
E19 1380  7    in front of the filter, is always clean. A pool is
E19 1390  4    no place for a shut trap.
E19 1390 10       You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair
E19 1400  7    pins be worn in the water. When shed, they leave rust
E19 1410  4    marks.
E19 1410  5       You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning,
E19 1420  2    your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing
E19 1430  1    and furbishing. It has happened.
E19 1430  6       Many hours of spring cleaning will be saved, however,
E19 1440  5    if you remove the main drain grate when you close the
E19 1450  3    pool season in the fall. As the pool is emptied, stand
E19 1450 14    by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are
E19 1460 11    still wet. Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily
E19 1470  8    removed when damp, but requires dynamite if allowed
E19 1480  3    to dry. If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you
E19 1480 17    may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is
E19 1490 11    out. Of course, when your 6-inch torrent of water is
E19 1500  8    released, it may cause a lot of comment as it passes
E19 1510  4    through or by neighboring properties. Do not forget
E19 1520  1    this possibility.
E19 1520  3       If your pool is located on or near sloping ground,
E19 1530  2    it may have natural drainage which is certainly more
E19 1530 11    desirable than to be faced with the annual expense
E19 1540  9    and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping
E19 1550  7    out all the debris.
E19 1550 11       It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an
E19 1560  7    evening scene, but lights also attract all the insect
E19 1570  4    life for miles around. Once on the water, these little
E19 1580  2    visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering
E19 1580 11    and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping
E19 1590  8    good time for all those present. Often one floodlight
E19 1600  5    high in a tree will provide all the light you need
E19 1610  3    at much less expense.
E19 1610  7       Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy
E19 1620  7    the best equipment possible, from pipes to brushes.
E19 1630  1    Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be
E19 1630 10    sure that one person (in the family or not) is regularly
E19 1640  9    responsible for each aspect of the job, with no chance
E19 1650  7    for claiming, "It wasn't my turn".
E19 1660  1       Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at
E19 1660 12    the valves- even if the little boys do want to play
E19 1670 10    space ship. You may find yourself hitting bottom, literally,
E19 1680  4    as you discover that water is running out even while
E19 1690  4    you are putting it in.
E20 0010  1       DRAW a line across the country at the latitude of
E20 0010 11    lower Pennsylvania. Any house built now below that
E20 0020  7    line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10
E20 0030  6    years. Fortunately, it is the ~FHA which has arrived
E20 0040  4    at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment
E20 0050  1    of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and
E20 0050 12    thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress. Even
E20 0060  8    if you live above that line, the ~FHA will back you,
E20 0070  6    for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning
E20 0080  4    in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged.
E20 0090  3       New simplified packaged units, recently devised
E20 0100  1    prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on
E20 0100  9    techniques make it possible to acquire a system for
E20 0110  8    an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to
E20 0120  5    $900. Two men can often do the installation in a day.
E20 0130  2    You can install it yourself- this is a central system
E20 0130 12    that will cool every part of your house. Its upkeep?
E20 0140  9    No less an authority than the ~FHA concurs that the
E20 0150  7    savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset
E20 0160  5    its operating costs.
E20 0170  1    _IS IT WORTH-WHILE?_
E20 0170  1       Home air conditioning has come a long way from the
E20 0170 11    early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock
E20 0180  8    they inflicted. We know now that a 15-degree differential
E20 0190  7    in temperature is the maximum usually desirable, and
E20 0200  3    accurate controls assure the comfort we want.
E20 0210  1       We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer
E20 0210 11    cooling. On the contrary, there are fewer colds and
E20 0220  7    smaller doctor bills. The filtered air benefits allergies,
E20 0230  4    asthma, sinus, hay fever. Control of temperature and
E20 0240  2    humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid.
E20 0240 12    Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the
E20 0250  7    stresses brought on by oppressive heat.
E20 0260  2       Housekeeping is easier. The cleaner air means less
E20 0270  2    time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry
E20 0270 12    cleaners, lighter loads for the washing machine. The
E20 0280  7    need for reupholstering, redecorating, repainting becomes
E20 0290  3    more infrequent. Clothes hold their shape better, and
E20 0300  3    mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.
E20 0300 10       It will improve your disposition. When you're less
E20 0310  8    fatigued, things just naturally look brighter. The
E20 0320  6    children can have their daytime naps and hot meals,
E20 0330  4    and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.
E20 0340  1    You'll sleep longer and better, too, awake refreshed
E20 0340  9    and free of hot weather nerves.
E20 0350  4       You can forget about screens, and leave the storm
E20 0360  2    windows up all year around.
E20 0360  7       Best of all, central air conditioning is something
E20 0370  3    you can afford. Like its long-lived cousin, the refrigerator,
E20 0380  3    a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years
E20 0390  1    or more. That brings its per-year cost down mighty
E20 0390 11    low.
E20 0400  1    _FOR ANY HOUSE._
E20 0400  2       No matter what style your home is, ranch, two-story,
E20 0400 12    Colonial or contemporary, central air conditioning
E20 0410  6    is easily installed. The equipment won't take up valuable
E20 0420  6    space either. It can go in out-of-the-way waste space.
E20 0430  3       But there's no denying that the easiest and most
E20 0440  3    economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning
E20 0450  1    is when you build. If that's done, the house can be
E20 0450 12    designed and oriented for best operation, and this
E20 0470  8    can mean savings both in the size of equipment and
E20 0480  5    in the cost of the house itself.
E20 0480 12       If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling
E20 0490 10    included when building, by all means make provision
E20 0500  6    for its easy adding later. Manufacturers have designed
E20 0510  3    equipment for just such circumstances, and your savings
E20 0520  2    over starting from scratch will be substantial.
E20 0520  9       If your house is to have a forced warm air system,
E20 0530 10    cooling can be a part of it. This costs less than having
E20 0540  7    a completely separate cooling system, for your regular
E20 0550  4    heating ductwork, filters and furnace blower do double
E20 0560  1    duty for cooling. You can get year-'round air conditioners
E20 0560 11    in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace
E20 0570 11    alone- high or low boy, horizontal or counterflow.
E20 0580  6    The units can be installed in basement, attic, crawlspace,
E20 0590  3    or in a closet located in the living area. The cooling
E20 0600  2    coil is located in the furnace's outlet. From the coil
E20 0610  1    small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration
E20 0610  9    section set in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.
E20 0620  8       If you plan to add cooling later to your heating
E20 0630  6    system, there are things to watch for. Be sure ducts
E20 0640  4    that require insulation get it when they are installed.
E20 0650  1    They may be inaccessible later. Be sure your ducts
E20 0650 10    and blower are big enough to handle cooling. This is
E20 0660  8    especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone.
E20 0670  7    Be sure you get a perimeter heating system, and diffusers
E20 0680  3    that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating.
E20 0690  2       You can get a hot water system that will also work
E20 0700  1    for cooling your house. For cooling, chilled water
E20 0700  9    is circulated instead of hot water. Instead of radiators
E20 0710  7    you'll have cooling-heating units, each with its own
E20 0720  6    thermostat. These systems are more expensive than year-'round
E20 0730  4    forced air systems. The minimum cost for an average
E20 0740  1    one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to
E20 0740 11    run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone.
E20 0750  7    _SEPARATE SYSTEMS._
E20 0750  9       If the problems of combining cooling with your heating
E20 0760  7    are knotty, it may be cheaper to plan on a completely
E20 0770  6    separate cooling system. The simplest kind of separate
E20 0780  3    system uses a single, self-contained unit. It is, in
E20 0780 13    effect, an oversize room conditioner equipped with
E20 0790  7    prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled,
E20 0800  5    cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.
E20 0810  1       In a long, rambling ranch, two such units can be
E20 0810 11    installed, one serving the living area, the other the
E20 0820  9    sleeping zone. In a two-story house, one unit may be
E20 0830  6    installed in the basement to serve the first floor,
E20 0840  2    another in the attic to cool the second. In each case,
E20 0840 13    having separate systems for living and sleeping areas
E20 0850  8    has the advantage of permitting individual zone control.
E20 0860  5    _THE HEAT PUMP._
E20 0860  8       One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems
E20 0870  8    is one that can be switched to heating. As you know,
E20 0880  6    a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the
E20 0890  2    heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors.
E20 0890 12    A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses
E20 0900  5    the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward,
E20 0910  4    and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned
E20 0920  3    indoors.
E20 0920  4       Up until recently, this heat pump method of warming
E20 0930  3    air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and
E20 0930 13    when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees. Now,
E20 0940  8    the machine has been improved to a point where it is
E20 0950  8    generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures
E20 0960  3    down to 15 degrees. You can get this added heating
E20 0970  1    feature for as little as $200 more than the price of
E20 0970 12    cooling alone.
E20 0980  1       Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost,
E20 0980 10    for those emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard
E20 0990  8    holds up fuel delivery, or for cool summer mornings
E20 1000  6    or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole
E20 1010  4    heating plant.
E20 1010  6    _WHAT SIZE CONDITIONER?_
E20 1010  9       How large a cooling unit you need, and the method
E20 1020  9    of its installation, depends on a variety of factors.
E20 1030  6    Among other things, besides the nature of your house
E20 1040  3    and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms
E20 1040 14    from the outside, it will depend upon your personal
E20 1050  9    habits and the makeup of your family. Families with
E20 1060  6    children usually don't want the house quite so cool.
E20 1070  4    If you are a party thrower, you may need added capacity.
E20 1080  1    The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can
E20 1080 13    easily double your cooling load.
E20 1090  4       Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms
E20 1100  2    of ~BTU's. A ~BTU is a unit of heat, and the ~BTU rating
E20 1110  2    of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine
E20 1110 12    can pump out of your house in an hour. A very rough
E20 1120 12    rule of thumb is that, under favorable conditions,
E20 1130  5    you'll need 15 ~BTU's of cooling for every square foot
E20 1140  5    of your house. This is if outdoor temperatures have
E20 1150  2    a high average of 95 degrees. You'll need more if the
E20 1150 13    high average is above that, less if it's below.
E20 1160  9       Coolers are also rated by tons. A ton of cooling
E20 1170  8    compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of
E20 1180  5    ice. By accepted definition, a 1-ton conditioner will
E20 1190  1    provide 12,000 ~BTU of cooling in one hour.
E20 1190  9       You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower.
E20 1200  6    It is generally an inaccurate method of rating, for
E20 1210  5    the horsepower is that of the compressor motor, and
E20 1220  2    many other components beside it determine how much
E20 1220 10    cooling you'll get. A 1-~hp conditioner, for example,
E20 1230  8    may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 ~BTU to
E20 1240  6    well over 10,000 ~BTU.
E20 1240 10       The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate
E20 1250  9    the size of the unit you need, rather than trying to
E20 1260  7    do this yourself.
E20 1260 10       Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra
E20 1270  9    cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough. Better
E20 1280  6    to have your equipment slightly undersized than too
E20 1290  3    big. Here's why:
E20 1290  6       Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling.
E20 1300  5    An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly,
E20 1310  1    then shut down for a long period. Before it cycles
E20 1310 11    on again, humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable
E20 1320  8    even though the temperature is still low. With a unit
E20 1330  7    of the right size, a compressor will run continuously
E20 1340  3    during hot weather, reducing humidity as evenly as
E20 1340 11    it does temperature.
E20 1350  3    _MONEY-SAVING TIPS._
E20 1350  6       Attention to details can cut in half the size unit
E20 1360  7    you need and pare operating expense proportionately.
E20 1370  1    A well-designed, 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably
E20 1370 11    cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year, or
E20 1380 11    $11 a month.
E20 1390  1       If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate
E20 1390 10    easily, your unit will have less heat to remove. Keep
E20 1400  8    the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won
E20 1410  5    the first battle. In a new house, generous roof overhangs
E20 1420  2    are a logical and effective solution. If the house
E20 1420 11    you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs,
E20 1430  9    you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off
E20 1440  7    walls and windows with properly designed trellises,
E20 1450  2    fences and awnings.
E20 1450  5       Shade trees, too, are a big help, so keep them if
E20 1460  5    you can. Drawn blinds and draperies do some good, but
E20 1470  2    not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside
E20 1470 12    of the house.
E20 1480  1       The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof,
E20 1480 10    the greater its heat impact. The way a house is set
E20 1490 10    on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling
E20 1500  4    you're going to need. A shift in the walls, or a change
E20 1510  4    in the roof slope, so the sun hits them more obliquely,
E20 1510 15    can save you money.
E20 1520  4       You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun,
E20 1530  2    double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation.
E20 1530 10    Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides
E20 1540 10    of the house. They're easier to shade there. An attic
E20 1550  8    space above insulation makes a house easier to cool.
E20 1560  6    You'll even gain by putting your water heater outside
E20 1570  3    the conditioned space, and using an electric range
E20 1570 11    instead of a gas one. Gas adds to the moisture load.
E20 1580 11       Insulate, weatherstrip, double-glaze to the maximum.
E20 1590  6    In insulation, the numbers to remember are 6-4-2. They
E20 1600  7    stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the
E20 1610  3    ceiling, 4 inches in the side walls, 2 inches in the
E20 1610 14    floors. Such extra-thick insulation not only permits
E20 1620  8    a much smaller cooling installation, but will continue
E20 1630  5    to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling.
E20 1640  4    A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per
E20 1650  2    cent.
E20 1650  3       It costs two to three times as much to remove a
E20 1650 14    ~BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter, so
E20 1660 12    every solitary ~BTU is worth attention. You'll foil
E20 1670  6    them in droves, along with their pal humidity, by having
E20 1680  6    and using a kitchen range exhaust fan, a bathroom ventilator
E20 1690  3    for when you shower, and an outside vent for the clothes
E20 1700  2    drier.
E20 1700  3    _KEEPING CONDITIONERS QUIET._
E20 1700  6       It's no use pretending that all conditioners are
E20 1710  5    quiet, but the noise they produce can be kept to a
E20 1720  5    minimum. Good workmanship is important in the installation,
E20 1730  1    so if you're doing your own contracting, don't award
E20 1730 10    the job on the basis of price alone.
E20 1740  6       Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom.
E21 0010  1    ##
E21 0010  2    MOST RECREATION WORK calls for a good deal of pre-planning.
E21 0020  1    This is particularly true in site selection. You must
E21 0020 10    know before you start what the needs and objectives
E21 0030  8    of your organtion are; you must have a list of requirements
E21 0040  7    on where, how many, and what type sites are needed.
E21 0050  3    With such a program you can make constructive selections
E21 0060  1    of the best sites available.
E21 0060  6       Begin the examination of a site with a good map
E21 0070  5    and aerial photos if possible. These are becoming more
E21 0080  1    and more available through the work of counties and
E21 0080 10    other government agencies. The new editions of topographic
E21 0090  7    maps being made by the federal government are excellent
E21 0100  4    for orienting yourself to the natural features of the
E21 0110  4    site. These are inexpensive and available from the
E21 0110 12    U& S& Geological Society, Washington 25, D& C&. In
E21 0120  9    recent years many counties and the U& S& Forest Service
E21 0130 10    have taken aerial photos which show features in detail
E21 0140  8    and are very good for planning use. Most counties also
E21 0150  5    have maps available from the county engineer showing
E21 0160  2    roads and other features and from the assessor's office
E21 0170  1    showing ownerships of land.
E21 0170  5       Inspect the site in the field during the time of
E21 0180  4    the year when the area will be most heavily used for
E21 0190  1    recreation. This gives you a better opportunity to
E21 0190  9    get the feel of the climate conditions, the exposure
E21 0200  5    to the sun and wind, the water interests, etcetera,
E21 0210  2    which vary greatly with the seasons. It is usually
E21 0210 11    helpful to make a sketch map in the field, showing
E21 0220 10    the size and location of the features of interest and
E21 0230  7    to take photographs at the site. These are a great
E21 0240  4    aid for planning use back at the office.
E21 0240 12    ##
E21 0240 13    FOR SITE PLANNING WORK, it is best to have a qualified
E21 0250 11    and experienced park planner to carry through the study.
E21 0260  8    However, there is also much to be gained by making
E21 0270  6    use of the abilities of the local people who are available
E21 0280  2    and interested in recreation. County judges, commissioners,
E21 0290  1    engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in
E21 0290  9    the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge
E21 0300  7    regarding the site or opinions to offer from their
E21 0310  5    varied professional experiences. A visit to the site
E21 0320  1    by a group of several persons can usually bring out
E21 0320 11    new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning
E21 0330  7    study of any recreation area.
E21 0340  1       How much study is required? This, of course, depends
E21 0340 10    on the character of the site itself, the previous experience
E21 0350 10    of the investigator, and the number of factors needed
E21 0360  7    to arrive at a good decision. It is too easy for the
E21 0370  7    inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a
E21 0380  3    few values of the area and base a decision on these
E21 0380 14    alone. Usually there are more factors to good site
E21 0390  8    planning than first impressions. A site may be a rundown
E21 0400  7    slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today
E21 0410  2    but have excellent potentials for the future with a
E21 0410 11    little development or water. The same is true of areas
E21 0420 10    which at first look good because of a few existing
E21 0430  7    recreation features but may actually be poor areas
E21 0440  4    to develop for general public use.
E21 0440 10       In looking for the best sites available that meet
E21 0450  7    the requirements, you need information to compare the
E21 0460  4    site with others. You need answers to four important
E21 0470  1    questions.
E21 0470  2       @ What are the existing recreation features?
E21 0480  1       @ How well can the site be developed?
E21 0480  9       @ How useful will it be to the public?
E21 0490  7       @ Is this site available?
E21 0500  1       Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation
E21 0500 11    interests already existing at the site. Naturally,
E21 0510  7    a park site with scenic views, a good lake, trees,
E21 0520  6    and sand dunes, will attract more people than a nearby
E21 0530  4    area with only trees and dunes. Quality is vitally
E21 0530 13    important. Frontage on a body of clear, clean water
E21 0540  9    will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage
E21 0550  7    on polluted water. Some recreation features, such as
E21 0560  4    scenic values and water interest, also have greater
E21 0570  1    overall value than other interests.
E21 0570  6       One of the most desirable features for a park are
E21 0580  6    beautiful views or scenery. It may be distant views
E21 0590  2    of a valley or the mountains or natural features such
E21 0590 12    as a small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual
E21 0600  8    trees. A site which overlooks a harbor or river may
E21 0610  7    offer interest in the activities of boating traffic.
E21 0620  2    An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the
E21 0620 13    surf rolling in on a beach. A site may also be attractive
E21 0630 12    just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs. Note
E21 0640  9    extent of these interests and how available they will
E21 0650  5    be for the public to enjoy.
E21 0650 11       Water interest is one of the most valuable factors
E21 0660  8    you can find for a recreation site. Most park planners
E21 0670  5    look to water frontage for basic park areas. This follows
E21 0680  3    naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake
E21 0690  1    provides scenic values and opportunities for the very
E21 0690  9    popular recreation activities of bathing, fishing,
E21 0700  5    boating, and other water sports. A body of water is
E21 0710  6    usually the center of interest at parks which attract
E21 0720  1    the greatest picnic and camping use. It also cools
E21 0720 10    the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild
E21 0730  7    life.
E21 0730  8       The amount of water frontage, the quantity and quality
E21 0740  6    of the water, and the recreation afforded by it are
E21 0750  5    important. A restricted frontage may be too crowded
E21 0760  1    an area for public use. The quantity of water flow
E21 0760 11    may be critical; a stream or pond which is attractive
E21 0770  8    in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late
E21 0780  5    summer. If the site is on a reservoir, the level of
E21 0790  2    the water at various seasons as it affects recreation
E21 0790 11    should be studied. Check the quality of the water.
E21 0800  8    A stream which has all of its watershed within a national
E21 0810  6    forest or other lands under good conservation practices
E21 0820  2    is less likely to be affected by pollution than one
E21 0830  1    passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial
E21 0830  9    area. Other factors, such as water temperature, depth
E21 0840  7    of water, the fish life it supports, wave action, flooding,
E21 0850  5    etcetera, will affect its recreation value.
E21 0860  2    ##
E21 0860  3    OTHER NATURAL FEATURES which can be of high interest
E21 0870  1    are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast,
E21 0870  8    beaches, sand dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera
E21 0880  5    with which the area is blessed. Just as the national
E21 0890  5    and state parks place emphasis on features which are
E21 0900  2    of national or state significance, counties should
E21 0900  9    seek out these features which are distinctive of their
E21 0910  7    area. Although the site may not contain the features
E21 0920  5    themselves, there are often opportunities to include
E21 0930  3    them as additional interest to the site. The route
E21 0930 12    to the park may lead people past them or display views
E21 0940 10    of them. A group of native trees or plants which are
E21 0950  7    outstanding in a particular county can be featured
E21 0960  3    at the site.
E21 0960  6       The fish, animals, and birds which may be found
E21 0970  4    at the site are another interest. Fishing interest
E21 0970 12    calls for a check of the species found, quantity and
E21 0980 10    size, the season they are available, and the stocking
E21 0990  6    program of the fish commission. Animals may be present
E21 1000  4    at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas. The
E21 1010  1    site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory
E21 1010 12    birds or have its own resident bird life. Clams, crabs,
E21 1020  7    and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas.
E21 1030  5    ##
E21 1030  6    EACH AREA has its own historical interests with which
E21 1040  4    much can be done. Park visitors are always eager to
E21 1050  3    learn more about the area they are in. The historical
E21 1050 13    sign tells its story, but nothing gets interest across
E21 1060  9    as well as some of the original historical items or
E21 1070  5    places themselves which still have the character of
E21 1080  3    the period covered. Notice should be taken of unusual
E21 1080 12    rock formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's
E21 1090  8    crust in your region. Those which tell a story of the
E21 1100  8    earth's formation in each area can add geological interest
E21 1110  5    to the recreation sites. An old shipwreck, a high dam,
E21 1120  4    an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other
E21 1130  1    semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera
E21 1130 11    may be of interest. Some areas may provide archeological
E21 1140  6    values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting
E21 1150  5    areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera.
E21 1160  1       How well can the site be developed? Look at the
E21 1160 10    physical features of the land to determine how desirable
E21 1170  8    it is for use, what can be done to correct the faults,
E21 1180  5    and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs
E21 1190  2    in comparison to other sites. Many things need to be
E21 1190 12    checked:
E21 1200  1    #SIZE AND SHAPE#
E21 1200  4    - The size of the area alone can be a determining factor.
E21 1210  2    An area may be too small for the needs of the project.
E21 1220  1    Areas should be large enough to include the attractions,
E21 1220 10    have ample space for the use of facilities needed,
E21 1230  8    and have room around the edges to protect the values
E21 1240  5    of the area from encroachment by private developments.
E21 1250  1    Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as
E21 1250 11    recreation areas are never too large for the future
E21 1260  9    and it is often more economical to operate one large
E21 1270  5    area than several small ones.
E21 1270 10       Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions
E21 1280 11    and needs of the development. A large picnic area or
E21 1290  7    camping development is most efficient in shape as a
E21 1300  5    square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in
E21 1310  2    preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred
E21 1310 12    feet wide. This is true because of savings in utility
E21 1320  8    lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful
E21 1330  5    radius equal in all directions. However, a narrow strip
E21 1340  3    may be very practical for small developments, or to
E21 1340 12    provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's
E21 1350  7    trail, or include scenic strips within the park unit.
E21 1360  7    #ADJOINING AREAS#
E21 1360  9    - The values of the site may be affected by the appearance
E21 1370 10    of the adjoining lands, ownership and use of the land,
E21 1380  7    and the utilities available there. For instance, a
E21 1390  3    site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as
E21 1390 11    a national forest or a public road, may be desirable,
E21 1400  9    whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not.
E21 1410  7    The utilities available nearby may provide a savings
E21 1420  4    in the cost of extending electricity or water to the
E21 1430  1    site.
E21 1430  2    #TOPOGRAPHY#
E21 1430  3    - Topography is very important. Check the elevation
E21 1440  2    of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage,
E21 1440 11    rock outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as
E21 1450  9    subsoil. Nearly level areas are required for parking
E21 1460  6    areas, beaches, camp areas, ballfields, etcetera. Determine
E21 1470  3    how much topography limits useful area or what the
E21 1480  2    costs of earth moving or grading might be.
E21 1480 10    #WATER#
E21 1480 11    - In addition to its recreation interests, water is
E21 1490  7    needed for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation. The
E21 1500  4    quantity and quality of water sources is often a big
E21 1510  4    factor in site selection. The area may provide good
E21 1510 13    springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal
E21 1520 11    water lines. Figure the cost of providing water to
E21 1530  7    the use areas.
E21 1530 10    #PLANTS#
E21 1530 11    - The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking.
E21 1540  8    Look at the trees as to size and interest, the amount
E21 1550  8    of shade they provide, how healthy they are, the problems
E21 1560  5    of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw, etcetera.
E21 1570  2       An area may have been partially logged and requires
E21 1580  1    removal of stumps or clean up. Some shrubs may be of
E21 1580 12    good landscaping value, other areas of brush may need
E21 1590  8    to be cleared. The extent and location of open areas
E21 1600  4    is noted.
E21 1600  6    #EXPOSURE#
E21 1600  7    - How much will wind, rain, sun, and temperature affect
E21 1610  6    the use? An area sheltered from strong winds may be
E21 1620  5    highly desirable for recreation use. The direction,
E21 1630  1    velocity, and season of these winds should be noted
E21 1630 10    as to just how they will affect the recreation use
E21 1640  7    and your maintenance and operation of the area. Lack
E21 1650  5    of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the
E21 1660  2    development of shade and irrigation of a site to make
E21 1660 12    it useable. Sometimes, you have a choice of exposure
E21 1670  8    for sites where the topography or trees of the area
E21 1680  6    will provide afternoon shade, morning sun, or whatever
E21 1690  2    may be most desirable for the use intended.
E21 1690 10    #IMPROVEMENTS#
E21 1700  1    - Some areas may already have been improved and contain
E21 1700 12    buildings, roads, utilities, cleared land, etcetera
E21 1710  6    which may raise the cost of the site.
E22 0010  1       Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff
E22 0010  8    to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of
E22 0020  8    Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure, because
E22 0030  5    I admire the music of Prokofieff; and with sober purpose,
E22 0040  5    because the development of Prokofieff personifies,
E22 0050  1    in many ways, the course of music in the Union of Soviet
E22 0050 13    Socialist Republics.
E22 0060  2       The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United
E22 0070  2    States of America was gay, witty, mercurial, full of
E22 0070 11    pranks and bonheur- and very capable as a professional
E22 0080  9    musician. These qualities endeared him to both the
E22 0090  7    musicians and the social-economic haute monde which
E22 0100  4    supported the concert world of the post-World War /1,
E22 0110  3    era. Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor
E22 0120  1    in America was, indeed, brilliant.
E22 0120  6       Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an
E22 0130  6    ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained
E22 0140  4    musician still in his twenties. To the Traditionalists,
E22 0150  1    it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the Neo-Classicists,
E22 0160  1    it was a challenge to the pre-war world. What was it
E22 0160 13    to Prokofieff? A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century
E22 0170  9    ideas; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate
E22 0180  7    of the times; a brilliant piece de resistance? Certainly
E22 0190  4    its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon.
E22 0200  6       I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time
E22 0210  5    when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927. All
E22 0220  2    musical Paris was there. Some musicians were enthusiastic,
E22 0220 10    some skeptical. I myself was one of the skeptics (35
E22 0230 10    years ago). I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer, shouting
E22 0240  7    in his high-pitched voice: "**h it may be a tour de
E22 0250  8    force, mais mon Dieu, can anyone take this music seriously"?
E22 0260  4       The answer is, "Yes"! Certainly, America took Prokofieff
E22 0270  4    and his Classical Symphony seriously, and with a good
E22 0280  5    deal of pleasure. His life-long friend, Serge Koussevitzky,
E22 0290  2    gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances
E22 0300  1    in Boston, New York, and Washington, D& C&, to which
E22 0310  1    he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole
E22 0310  9    nation. Chicago was also a welcome host: there, in
E22 0320  7    1921, Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the
E22 0330  4    Love for Three Oranges, and played the first performance
E22 0340  2    of his Third Piano Concerto. "Uncle Sam" was, indeed,
E22 0350  1    a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war
E22 0350 11    victory years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations
E22 0360  8    and extravaganzas, enjoyment and pleasure: "The Golden
E22 0370  5    Twenties". We attended the premieres of his concertos,
E22 0380  5    symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught, and performed
E22 0390  3    his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches;
E22 0400  1    we bought his records and played them in our schools
E22 0400 11    and universities. We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff
E22 0410  6    had won his rights as a world citizen to the first
E22 0420  7    ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers.
E22 0430  1       Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by
E22 0430  7    Paris during the Twenties: the Paris which was the
E22 0440  8    artistic center of the Western World- the social Paris
E22 0450  4    to which Russian aristocracy migrated- the chic Paris
E22 0460  6    which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America-
E22 0470  1    the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky,
E22 0480  1    Cocteau, Picasso- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism
E22 0490  1    and ultramodern art- the Paris sympathique which took
E22 0490  9    young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy
E22 0500 10    enthusiasms.
E22 0510  1       So young Prokofieff was the darling of success:
E22 0510  9    in his motherland; in the spacious hunting grounds
E22 0520  6    of "Uncle Sam"; in the exciting salons of his lovely,
E22 0530  5    brilliant Paris- mistress of gaiety- excess and abandon-
E22 0540  4    world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone, color,
E22 0550  1    dance, design, and thought.
E22 0550  5       Meanwhile, three great terrible forces were coagulating
E22 0560  4    and crystallizing. In this world-wide conscription
E22 0570  1    of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled
E22 0570  9    to his native land. The world exploded when Fascism
E22 0580  8    challenged all concepts of peace and liberty, and the
E22 0590  7    outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist
E22 0600  2    and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist
E22 0610  1    tyranny into cringing submission. After this holocaust,
E22 0610  8    a changing world occupied the minds of men; a world
E22 0620  8    beset with new boundaries, new treaties and governments,
E22 0630  4    new goals and methods, and the age-old fears of aggression
E22 0640  1    and subjugation- hunger and exposure.
E22 0640  6       In this changed world, Prokofieff settled to find
E22 0650  7    himself, and to create for large national purpose.
E22 0660  4    Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune proved
E22 0670  2    that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic
E22 0680  1    order fighting for its very existence and ideals in
E22 0680 10    a truculent world. Here, Prokofieff became a workman
E22 0690  6    in the vineyards of Socialism- producing music for
E22 0700  4    the masses.
E22 0700  6       It is at this point in his life that the mature
E22 0710  4    Prokofieff emerges. One might have expected that such
E22 0720  2    a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed
E22 0720 10    the creative flair of a composer, especially one whose
E22 0730  8    works were so fluent and spontaneous.
E22 0740  1       But no: Prokofieff grew. He accepted the environment
E22 0750  1    of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature
E22 0750 12    of his early promise. By 1937 he had clarified his
E22 0760  9    intentions to serve his people: "I have striven for
E22 0770  6    clarity and melodious idiom, but at the same time I
E22 0780  5    have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the
E22 0790  1    accepted methods of harmony and melody. This is precisely
E22 0790 10    what makes lucid, straightforward music so difficult
E22 0800  6    to compose- the clarity must be new, not old". How
E22 0810  6    right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural defection
E22 0820  2    of experimentation as an escape for those who dare
E22 0820 11    not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern
E22 0830 10    traditionalism. And with what resource did Prokofieff
E22 0840  6    back up his Credo of words- with torrents of powerful
E22 0850  4    music. Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty
E22 0860  2    between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony
E22 0860 10    and his big, muscular, passionate, and eloquent Fifth
E22 0870  8    Symphony; or the Love for Three Oranges (gay as it
E22 0880  8    is) with the wonderful, imaginative, colorful, and
E22 0890  3    subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet, The Stone
E22 0900  3    Flower. This masterpiece has gaiety, too, but it is
E22 0910  1    the gaiety of dancing people: earthy, salty and humorous.
E22 0910 10       Of course, these works are not comparable, even
E22 0920  8    though the same brain conceived them. The early works
E22 0930  5    were conceived for a sophisticated, international audience;
E22 0940  2    the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life
E22 0950  3    for fellow citizens. However, in all of Prokofieff's
E22 0950 11    music, young or mature, we find his profile- his "signature"-
E22 0960 10    his craftsman's attitude. Prokofieff never forsakes
E22 0970  6    his medium for the cause of experimentation per se.
E22 0980  6    In orchestration, he stretches the limits of instrumentation
E22 0990  5    with good judgment and a fine imagination for color.
E22 1000  3    His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable.
E22 1010  1    His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic
E22 1010  9    dance tunes and love songs is captivating: witty, clever,
E22 1020  7    adroit, and subtle. His counterpoint is pertinent,
E22 1030  4    skillful, and rarely thick.
E22 1030  8       Also, it should be noted that the polytonal freedom
E22 1040  9    of his melodies and harmonic modulations, the brilliant
E22 1050  4    orchestrations, the adroitness for evading the heaviness
E22 1060  3    of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint were
E22 1070  2    not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular
E22 1070 12    historical dramas of the stage and cinema, where a
E22 1080  9    large, dramatic canvas of sound was required. That
E22 1090  4    Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally
E22 1100  3    routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that he
E22 1110  2    was less of an "original" than we prefer to believe.
E22 1110 12    Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue
E22 1120  9    and instability.
E22 1130  1       Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero,
E22 1130  9    who, by the force of his creative life, helped preserve
E22 1140  6    the main stream of tradition, to which the surviving
E22 1150  3    idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually
E22 1160  1    added and integrated.
E22 1160  4       At this date, it seems probable that the name of
E22 1170  3    Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History,
E22 1180  1    as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware
E22 1180  9    of the lure and danger of experimentation, and used
E22 1190  5    it as it served his purpose; yet was never caught up
E22 1200  5    in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics. Certainly,
E22 1210  2    it is the traditional clarity of his music which has
E22 1210 12    endeared him to the Western World- not his experimentations.
E22 1230  1       So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical
E22 1230  8    talents and harvest a rich reward from them. Nor can
E22 1240  7    anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better,
E22 1250  4    or even as well, under different circumstances. His
E22 1260  2    fellow-countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not.
E22 1260  9    Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity,
E22 1270  7    while Stravinsky (who leaped into fame like a young
E22 1280  6    giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness? I think
E22 1290  3    the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words:
E22 1300  1    "the clarity must be new, not old". When Prokofieff
E22 1300 10    forged his new clarity of "lucid, straightforward music,
E22 1310  7    so difficult to compose", he shaped his talents to
E22 1320  6    his purpose.
E22 1320  8       When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting
E22 1330  7    scenes of many cultures, many salons, many dialectics,
E22 1340  3    many personalities, he tried to refashion himself into
E22 1350  2    a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate
E22 1350 11    cultures. Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction
E22 1360  8    by the life of his own people- by the compass of their
E22 1370  6    national ideas. But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes
E22 1380  6    of whatever culture he was reflecting. In all his
E22 1390  3    miscalculations,
E22 1390  4    Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming
E22 1400  3    that he could transform other composers' inspirations-
E22 1410  3    representing many peoples, time periods and styles-
E22 1410 10    into his own music by warping the harmony, melody,
E22 1420  7    or form, to verify his own experiments. Because of
E22 1430  3    the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic
E22 1440  1    materials, and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant
E22 1440  9    Petruchka, his savage Sacre du Printemps, his incisive
E22 1450  8    Les Noces- the world kept hoping that he could recapture
E22 1460 11    the historical direction for which his native talents
E22 1470  7    were predisposed.
E22 1470  9       But time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's
E22 1480  9    admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra
E22 1490  7    firma. His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks
E22 1500  4    of a house divided against itself: Supra-Expressionism,
E22 1510  1    Neo-Paganism, Neo-Classicism, Neo-Romanticism, Neo-Jazz,
E22 1520  3    Neo-Ecclesiasticism, Neo-Popularism, and most recently,
E22 1530  1    Post-Serialism- all competing with each other within
E22 1530  9    one composer! What a patchwork of proclamations and
E22 1540  7    renunciations! Meager and shabby by-products linger
E22 1550  6    to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist;
E22 1560  1    a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem
E22 1560  8    (The Star-Spangled Banner); a poor attempt to write
E22 1570  9    an idiomatic jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants;
E22 1580  8    his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be
E22 1590  7    used for popular American commercial songs! Stravinsky,
E22 1600  3    nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic
E22 1610  1    bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another,
E22 1610  9    searching for a home.
E22 1620  3       How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded. Prokofieff
E22 1630  1    was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly
E22 1630 11    changing world without losing his particular force
E22 1640  7    and direction. In the process, his native endowments
E22 1650  4    were stretched, strengthened and disciplined to serve
E22 1660  3    their human purpose.
E22 1660  6       With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique,
E22 1670  4    he wove the materials of national heroes and events,
E22 1680  2    national folklore and children's fairy tales- Slavic
E22 1680  9    dances and love songs- into a solid musical literature
E22 1690  9    which served his people well, and is providing much
E22 1700  7    enjoyment to the World at large.
E22 1710  1       Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving
E22 1710 11    this historical feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources
E22 1720  7    of his people behind him; time and economic security;
E22 1730  6    symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies; choruses,
E22 1740  3    chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings; broadcastings;
E22 1750  2    television; large and eager audiences. It must be conceded
E22 1760  4    that his native land provided Prokofieff with many
E22 1770  1    of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive:
E22 1770  9    economic security and cultural opportunities, incisive
E22 1780  6    idioms, social fermentations for a new national ideology-
E22 1790  6    a sympathetic public and a large body of performers
E22 1800  4    especially trained to fulfill his purpose.
E22 1810  1       Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist
E22 1810  8    Republics produced one of the great composers of the
E22 1820  8    Twentieth Century. That his moods, even in his early
E22 1830  5    years, are those of his people, does him honor, as
E22 1840  2    his music honors those who inspired it. That he mastered
E22 1840 12    every aspect of his medium according to his own great
E22 1850  9    talents and contemporary judgments, is a good and solid
E22 1860  7    symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures
E22 1870  2    of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;
E22 1880  1    and perhaps of even greater significance- his music
E22 1880  9    is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness
E22 1890  5    of Evolution, based on a broad Traditionalism for the
E22 1900  4    creative art of music.
E22 1910  1       April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical
E22 1910 11    history- indeed in the musical history of the entire
E22 1920 11    eastern United States. On that date the Musicians Emergency
E22 1930  7    Fund, organized to furnish employment for musicians
E22 1940  4    unable to obtain engagements during the depression
E22 1950  2    and to provide relief for older musicians who lost
E22 1950 11    their fortunes in the stock market crash, observed
E22 1960  7    its 30th anniversary.
E23 0010  1    ROY MASON IS ESSENTIALLY A LANDSCAPE PAINTER whose
E23 0010  9    style and direction has a kinship with the English
E23 0020  7    watercolorists of the early nineteenth century, especially
E23 0030  3    the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman.
E23 0040  2    And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects
E23 0050  1    in large, simplified masses which, though they seem
E23 0050  9    effortless, are in reality the result of skilled design
E23 0060  8    born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the
E23 0070  4    natural form that inspired them.
E23 0070  9       As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting
E23 0080 10    the goodness of the out-of-doors, its tang of weather,
E23 0090  8    its change of seasons, its variable moods. His father,
E23 0100  4    a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter,
E23 0110  2    took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and
E23 0110 10    imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature.
E23 0120  9    Out of this background of hunting and fishing, it was
E23 0130  6    only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew
E23 0140  3    best: hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream,
E23 0140 12    ducks and geese on the wing- almost always against
E23 0150  9    a vast backdrop of weather landscape. It is this subject
E23 0160  7    matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic
E23 0170  5    following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional
E23 0180  1    performance with this motif that commends him to artists
E23 0180 10    and discerning collectors.
E23 0190  3       Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself
E23 0200  2    exclusively to painting. Like many others, he had to
E23 0200 11    work hard, long hours in a struggling family business
E23 0210  9    which, though it was allied to art of a kind- the design
E23 0220  9    and production of engraved seals- bore no relation
E23 0230  6    to the painting of pictures. But it did teach Roy the
E23 0240  3    basic techniques of commercial art, and later, for
E23 0240 11    twelve years, he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising
E23 0250  9    art studio in Philadelphia. On the death of their father,
E23 0260  7    they returned to their home in Batavia, New York. After
E23 0270  6    more years of concentrated effort, Roy and his brother
E23 0280  4    Max finally established a thriving family business
E23 0290  1    at the old stand.
E23 0290  5       During all this time Roy continued to paint, first
E23 0300  2    only on weekends, and then, as the family business
E23 0300 11    permitted, for longer periods. Gradually he withdrew
E23 0310  7    from the shop altogether, and for the past thirty years,
E23 0320  7    he has worked independently as a painter, except for
E23 0330  3    his continued hunting and fishing expeditions. But
E23 0330 10    even on these, the palette often takes over while the
E23 0340 10    shotgun cools off!
E23 0350  1       Except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey
E23 0350 10    Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction
E23 0360  8    he ever had- and this was limited to a few lessons,
E23 0370  8    though the two artists often went on painting trips
E23 0380  3    together- Roy developed his art by himself. In the
E23 0390  1    best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then
E23 0390 10    to draw with accuracy and assurance, and then to paint.
E23 0400  7    He worked in oil for years before beginning his work
E23 0410  4    in watercolor, and his first public recognition and
E23 0420  2    early honors, including his election to the Academy,
E23 0420 10    were for his essays in the heavier medium. Gradually
E23 0430  8    watercolor claimed his greater affection until today
E23 0440  4    it has become his major, if not exclusive, technique.
E23 0450  2       It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason
E23 0460  1    on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia.
E23 0460 10    More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave
E23 0470 10    my own work and stand at a respectable distance where
E23 0480  5    I could watch this man transform raw nature into a
E23 0490  3    composed, not imitative, painting. What I have observed
E23 0500  1    time and time again is a process of integration, integration
E23 0500 11    that begins as abstract design and gradually takes
E23 0510  7    on recognizable form; color patterns that are made
E23 0520  5    to weave throughout the whole composition; and that
E23 0530  3    over-all, amazing control of large washes which is
E23 0530 12    the Mason stylemark. Finally come those little flicks
E23 0540  7    of a rigger brush and the job is done. Inspiring- yes;
E23 0550  6    instructive- maybe; duplicable- no!
E23 0560  4       But for the technical fact, we have the artist's
E23 0570  1    own testimony:
E23 0570  3       "Of late years, I find that I like best to work
E23 0580  2    out-of-doors. First I make preliminary watercolor sketches
E23 0580 11    in quarter scale (approximately **f inches) in which
E23 0590  8    I pay particular attention to the design principles
E23 0600  5    of three simple values- the lightest light, the middle
E23 0610  4    tone, and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms of
E23 0620  2    my subject to these large patterns. If a human figure
E23 0620 12    or wild life are to be part of the projected final
E23 0630  9    picture, I try to place them in the initial sketch.
E23 0640  5    For me, these will belong more completely to their
E23 0650  2    surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage,
E23 0650 11    though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add
E23 0660 11    or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves
E23 0670  7    my final purpose.
E23 0670 10       "I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors
E23 0680  5    suffer because the artist expects nature will do his
E23 0690  5    composing for him; as a result, such pictures are only
E23 0700  2    a literal translation of what the artist finds in the
E23 0700 12    scene before him. Just because a tree or other object
E23 0710  9    appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to
E23 0720  6    place it in the same position in the painting, unless
E23 0730  2    the position serves the design of the whole composition.
E23 0740  1    If the artist would study his work more thoroughly
E23 0740 10    and move certain units in his design, often only slightly,
E23 0750  8    finer pictures would result. Out of long experience
E23 0760  5    I have found that incidental figures and other objects
E23 0770  2    like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the
E23 0770 12    original sketch and moved about in the major areas
E23 0780  9    on the final sheet until they occupy the right position,
E23 0790  5    which I call 'clicking'.
E23 0800  1       "Speed in painting a picture is valid only when
E23 0800  9    it imparts spontaneity and crispness, but unless the
E23 0810  6    artist has lots of experience so that he can control
E23 0820  4    rapid execution, he would do well to take these first
E23 0820 14    sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve
E23 0830  8    a unified composition.
E23 0840  1       "If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of
E23 0840 10    the composition, I mean to project equal concern for
E23 0850  8    color. Often, in working out-of-doors under all conditions
E23 0860  7    of light and atmosphere, a particular passage that
E23 0870  3    looked favorable in relation to the subject will be
E23 0880  1    too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when
E23 0880 12    viewed indoors in a mat. When this occurs, I make the
E23 0890  9    change on the sketch or on the final watercolor- if
E23 0900  4    I have been working on a full sheet in the field.
E23 0910  1       "When working from one of my sketches I square it
E23 0910 11    up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor
E23 0920  9    sheet with charcoal. When this linear draft is completed,
E23 0930  7    I dust it down to a faint image. From this point, I
E23 0940  6    paint in as direct a manner as possible, by flowing
E23 0950  2    on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can
E23 0950 14    manage. However, first I thoughtfully study my sketch
E23 0965  6    for improvement of color and design along the lines
E23 0970  5    I have described. Then I plan my attack: the parts
E23 0980  3    I will finish first, the range of values, the accenting
E23 0980 13    of minor details- all in all, mechanics of producing
E23 0990  9    the finished job with a maximum of crispness. The longer
E23 1000  8    I work, the more I am sure that for me, at least, a
E23 1010  7    workmanlike method is important. Trial and error are
E23 1020  3    better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping
E23 1020 12    for miracles in the final painting.
E23 1030  5       "As for materials, I use the best available. I work
E23 1040  5    on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently
E23 1050  1    resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes
E23 1050 11    from undue strain. In my studio I work at a tilt-top
E23 1060 11    table, but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move
E23 1070  7    it freely to control the washes. I have used a variety
E23 1080  4    of heavy-weight hand-made papers, but prefer an English
E23 1090  1    make, rough surface, in 400-pound weight. After selecting
E23 1090 10    a sheet and inspecting it for flaws (even the best
E23 1100  9    sometimes has foreign 'nubbins' on its surface), I
E23 1110  5    sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean, cold
E23 1120  3    water. Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so
E23 1120 13    that it will lie flat as a board.
E23 1130  8       "In addition to the usual tools, I make constant
E23 1140  4    use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes,
E23 1150  1    but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to
E23 1150 12    open up lights in dark washes. The great absorbency
E23 1160  7    of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control
E23 1170  6    than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist.
E23 1180  2    I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large
E23 1185  1    washes in the studio.
E23 1190  1       "My brushes are different from those used by most
E23 1200  3    watercolorists, for I combine the sable and the bristle.
E23 1200 12    The red sables are @8; two riggers, @6 and @10; and
E23 1210 11    a very large, flat wash brush. The bristles are a Fitch
E23 1220  9    @2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel
E23 1230  8    edge.
E23 1230  9       "My usual palette consists of top-quality colors:
E23 1240  6    alizarin crimson, orange, raw sienna, raw umber, burnt
E23 1250  4    sienna, sepia, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, French ultramarine
E23 1260  2    blue, Winsor green, Hooker's green @2, cadmium yellow
E23 1270  1    pale, yellow ochre, Payne's gray, charcoal gray, Davy's
E23 1270  9    gray, and ivory black".
E23 1280  4       In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason, the first
E23 1290  3    thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness,
E23 1300  1    yet this word has such a varied connotation that it
E23 1300 11    needs some elaboration here. True, a Mason watercolor
E23 1310  6    is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a
E23 1320  6    detailed inventory. Unlike many decorative patterns
E23 1330  1    that present a static flat convention, this artist's
E23 1330  9    pictures are full of atmosphere and climate.
E23 1340  7       Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape
E23 1350  5    can be reduced to three essential planes: a foreground
E23 1360  3    in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents
E23 1370  1    or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often
E23 1370 11    containing the major motif; and a background, usually
E23 1380  7    a silhouetted form foiled against the sky. In following
E23 1390  5    this general principle, Mason provides the observer
E23 1400  2    with a natural eye progression from foreground to background,
E23 1410  1    and the illusion of depth is instantly created.
E23 1410  9       When painting, Mason's physical eyes are half-closed,
E23 1420  7    while his mind's eye is wide open, and this circumstance
E23 1430  7    accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey.
E23 1440  5    He does not insist on telling all he knows about any
E23 1450  2    given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer
E23 1450 10    to draw on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia.
E23 1460  8    It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects
E23 1470  7    that require specific recognition of place for their
E23 1480  5    enjoyment. His pictures generalize, though they are
E23 1490  3    inspired by a particular locale; they universalize
E23 1490 10    in terms of weather, skies, earth, and people. By dealing
E23 1500  9    with common landscape in an uncommon way, Roy Mason
E23 1510  7    has found a particular niche in American landscape
E23 1520  2    art. Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience
E23 1530  1    of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive
E23 1530 11    interpretor, a breath and breadth of the outdoor world
E23 1540  9    to help man honor the Creator of it all.
E23 1550  6       The artist was born in Gilbert Mills, New York,
E23 1560  3    in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife
E23 1560 15    moved to California, he lived in western New York,
E23 1570  9    in Batavia. When I looked up the actual date of his
E23 1580  9    birth and found it to be March 15th, I realized that
E23 1590  5    Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist:
E23 1600  3    the water sign of Pisces (February 18-March 20). And
E23 1610  2    how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes,
E23 1610 13    and how appropriate that he should appear in AMERICAN
E23 1620  9    ARTIST again, in his natal month of March!
E23 1630  7       Over the years, beginning in 1929, Mason has been
E23 1640  5    awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals;
E23 1650  2    two Ranger Fund purchase awards; the Joseph Pennell
E23 1660  1    Memorial Medal; two American Watercolor Society prizes;
E23 1660  8    the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor, Art Institute
E23 1670  7    of Chicago; and others in Buffalo, New York, Chautauqua,
E23 1680  8    New Haven, Rochester, Rockport, and most recently,
E23 1690  5    the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach
E23 1700  4    Art Association,
E23 1700  6       He was elected to the National Academy of Design
E23 1710  4    as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 (after receiving
E23 1720  3    his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy
E23 1730  1    in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940.

E24 0010  1       The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American
E24 0010 11    gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason- they
E24 0020  9    were better. They were better trained, better looking,
E24 0030  5    better built, better disciplined **h and something
E24 0040  3    else- they were better dancers. Our athletes are only
E24 0050  2    just beginning to learn that they must study dance.
E24 0050 11    The Russians are all trained as dancers before they
E24 0060  8    start to study gymnastics.
E24 0070  1       But why gymnastics at all? And is the sport really
E24 0070 11    important? After all, we did pretty well in some other
E24 0080 10    areas of the Olympics competition. But if it is important,
E24 0090  7    what can we do to improve ourselves? It is more than
E24 0100  5    just lack of dance training that is our problem, for
E24 0110  2    just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has
E24 0110 11    some very important things to learn from gymnastics.
E24 0120  7       Taking first things first, let's understand the
E24 0130  5    sport called gymnastics. It is made up of tumbling,
E24 0140  3    which might be said to start with a somersault, run
E24 0140 13    through such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels,
E24 0150  7    backbends, and culminate in nearly impossible combinations
E24 0160  6    of aerial flips and twists **h and apparatus work.
E24 0170  5    The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight
E24 0180  3    in American gyms, but about 1930 it was dropped in
E24 0180 13    favor of games. The parallel bars, horse, buck, springboard,
E24 0190  9    horizontal bar, rings, and mats formerly in the school
E24 0200  8    gyms were replaced by baseball, volleyball, basketball
E24 0210  3    and football.
E24 0210  5       But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step
E24 0220  6    in training for all other sports because it provides
E24 0230  3    training in every basic quality except one, endurance.
E24 0230 11    The gymnast must develop strength, flexibility, coordination,
E24 0240  7    timing, rhythm, courage, discipline, persistence and
E24 0245  6    the desire for perfection. In short, gymnastics uses
E24 0250  5    every part of the body and requires a great deal of
E24 0270  3    character as well. The addition of endurance training
E24 0270 11    later, when the body is mature enough to benefit from
E24 0280 10    it without danger of injury, provides that final quality
E24 0290  5    that makes the top athlete, soldier or citizen.
E24 0300  3       Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that
E24 0310  1    it can be started very early in life. (An enterprising
E24 0310 11    teacher or parent could start training a healthy child
E24 0320  7    at the age of seven days. Most Europeans have been
E24 0330  5    exercising newborn infants for centuries.) In most
E24 0340  3    sports, as in most walks of life, the angels are on
E24 0340 14    the side of those who begin young, and the Russian
E24 0350  9    competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training
E24 0360  6    behind him. The American is very lucky if he has three.
E24 0370  5       If a nation wished to get a head start in physical
E24 0380  2    fitness over all other nations, it would start its
E24 0380 11    kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the
E24 0390  8    day they entered and thus eliminate a large number
E24 0400  5    of the problems that plague American schools. First
E24 0410  2    of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional
E24 0410 11    tension, since action relieves both. Oddly enough,
E24 0420  7    it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty.
E24 0430  6    Certainly there would be less anxiety, fewer accidents
E24 0440  3    (it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries),
E24 0450  1    and higher scholastic averages, since alert children
E24 0450  8    work better. Russia knows this, and that is why there
E24 0460  9    were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates
E24 0470  5    for the Olympic gymnastic team. Eighty thousand won
E24 0480  3    top honors and a chance to try for the team itself.
E24 0480 14    We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of
E24 0490 10    over 180 million people.
E24 0500  1       And what has dancing to do with all this? A great
E24 0500 12    deal. Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before
E24 0510  8    having the rigorous training on apparatus. Well-stretched,
E24 0520  6    trained in posture and coordinated movement, and wedded
E24 0530  4    to rhythm, they presented the audiences in Rome with
E24 0540  3    one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic
E24 0550  1    contest. American audiences in particular learned two
E24 0550  8    valuable lessons. They saw completely masculine and
E24 0560  6    obviously virile men performing with incredible grace.
E24 0570  4    They were further stripped of old wive's tales by seeing
E24 0590  3    the slender, lovely Russian girls performing feats
E24 0590 10    requiring tremendous strength **h and with not one
E24 0600  8    bulging muscle.
E24 0610  1       President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically
E24 0610  9    fit nation. If we wait until children are in junior
E24 0620  8    high or high school, we will never manage it. To be
E24 0630  5    fit, one has to start early with young children, and
E24 0640  2    today the only person who really reaches such children
E24 0640 11    is the teacher of dance. If the dance teachers of America
E24 0650  9    make it their business to prepare their young charges
E24 0660  6    for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools
E24 0670  6    are really responsible, we will be that much ahead.
E24 0680  2    School teachers, all too unprepared for the job they
E24 0680 11    must do, will need demonstrators. There should be youngsters
E24 0690  8    who know how to do a headstand, and also how to help
E24 0700  8    other children learn it. They should know simple exercises
E24 0710  4    that could prepare less fortunate children for the
E24 0720  2    sports we will demand be taught.
E24 0720  8       Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's
E24 0730  4    request not only through their regular dance work,
E24 0740  3    but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that
E24 0740 13    makes for strength and flexibility.
E24 0750  5       Very little in today's living provides the strength
E24 0760  4    we need **h and nothing provides the flexibility. Dancers
E24 0770  2    do have flexibility. They often fail, however, to develop
E24 0780  1    real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength.
E24 0780  9    Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three
E24 0790 10    chin-ups and the results, considering the amount of
E24 0800  5    physical training they have had, will be very disappointing.
E24 0810  3    Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas.
E24 0820  1    This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29
E24 0820 10    percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin
E24 0830 10    themselves once, and that English school girls outdo
E24 0840  6    them in almost every test (even dashes and endurance).
E24 0850  3    The only area in which American boys hold their own
E24 0860  1    is the baseball throw.
E24 0860  5    #THE CHINNING BAR#
E24 0860  8    For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended.
E24 0870  7    It should be installed over a door that is in full
E24 0880  7    view of everyone, and a chair should be placed under
E24 0890  2    it, a little to one side. Those children who can chin
E24 0890 13    themselves should be told to do one chin up each time
E24 0900 11    they pass under it. Those who are too weak, should
E24 0910  7    climb on the chair and, starting at the top of the
E24 0920  4    chin, let themselves slowly down. When they can take
E24 0930  1    ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have
E24 0930 10    the strength to chin up. Parents should be informed
E24 0940  7    about this system and encouraged to do the same with
E24 0950  6    the whole family at home.
E24 0950 11    #THE HORSE KICK#
E24 0960  1    Arm, shoulder, chest, upper and lower back strength
E24 0960  9    will be aided with the Horse Kick. Start on hands and
E24 0970  8    feet. Keeping the hands in the starting position, run
E24 0980  5    in place to a quick rhythm. After this has become easy,
E24 0990  3    use slower and slower rhythms, kicking higher and higher.
E24 1000  1    Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room
E24 1000 11    to the other on all fours, kicking as high as possible.
E24 1010  8    #PUSH-UPS#
E24 1010 10    Push-ups are essential, but few have the strength for
E24 1020  8    them at first. Start on the knees in a large circle.
E24 1030  6    Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body
E24 1040  3    down to rest on the floor. Push back up and repeat.
E24 1040 14    Do this exercise six times each class period. As strength
E24 1050  9    improves start in a standing position with legs wide
E24 1060  7    apart and upper body bent forward. Start by falling
E24 1070  4    forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength
E24 1080  1    improves, fall farther and farther out. Try to push
E24 1080 10    back to the stand position from the stretched position
E24 1090  6    without any intermediate pushes from the hands. The
E24 1100  5    push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top
E24 1110  2    of the push-up with legs spread wide. Let the body
E24 1110 13    down slowly, taking at least five seconds for the letting
E24 1120  9    down. Five of these done daily for about a week will
E24 1130  8    develop the strength for one push-up.
E24 1140  1    #HANDSTANDS#
E24 1140  2    Handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders have
E24 1150  2    developed at least a minimum of strength. Of course
E24 1150 11    those who have developed more will find them easier.
E24 1160  9    Start with the class standing in a circle, with weight
E24 1170  7    on the right foot and the left extended a little way
E24 1180  4    into the circle. At first each child should do a kick
E24 1190  1    up by himself so that the teacher can determine those
E24 1190 11    ready to work alone, and those who need help. Drop
E24 1200  8    both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the
E24 1210  5    right foot up in back. The left will follow at once.
E24 1220  2    The right will land first, followed by the left. Return
E24 1220 12    to the standing position. Care should be taken to see
E24 1230  9    that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick
E24 1240  7    starts and also that the landing foot is brought as
E24 1250  4    close to the hands as possible. This will prevent flat
E24 1260  1    falls and toe injuries. Bare feet are better for such
E24 1260 11    work than any form of slipper. Eventually the class
E24 1270  7    will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher
E24 1280  5    can catch the leading leg. The child should then bring
E24 1290  3    both legs together overhead, point the toes and tighten
E24 1290 12    the seat muscles. Be sure that the landing foot is
E24 1300 10    brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands
E24 1310  8    at a time.
E24 1310 11    #BACKBENDS#
E24 1310 12    The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of
E24 1320  9    free gymnastics, and, as with all acrobatics, the sooner
E24 1330  7    begun the better the results. Have the class lie supine
E24 1340  5    with knees apart and bent. Place flat palms on either
E24 1350  2    side of the head a few inches away from the ears, fingers
E24 1350 14    pointing toward the shoulders. Arch the back upwards
E24 1360  8    to make a bridge. Be sure the head drops backward so
E24 1370  8    that the child looks at the floor rather than toward
E24 1380  4    the ceiling. As flexibility improves, the feet will
E24 1390  1    move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher.
E24 1390 11    Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide
E24 1400  8    a walkover.
E24 1400 10    #BACK CIRCLE#
E24 1410  1    To further increase back flexibility, work on the back
E24 1410 10    circle. Have the class lie prone. Place the hands in
E24 1420  9    front of the chest. Keep the legs straight and the
E24 1430  6    toes pointed. Straighten the arms slowly, this arches
E24 1440  3    the back. At the peak of the arch, tip the head back
E24 1440 15    and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head.
E24 1450 12    Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance
E24 1460  6    between toes and head.
E24 1460 10    #SOMERSAULTS#
E24 1470  1    The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program
E24 1470  9    is the somersault, or forward roll. This used to be
E24 1480  9    part of every child's bag of tricks, but few children
E24 1490  7    can do it today; some are actually incapable of rolling
E24 1500  4    forward and are completely confused when not sitting
E24 1510  1    or standing upright. For most small children, learning
E24 1510  9    a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another
E24 1520  9    child who can. After it has been seen, have the child
E24 1530  6    start on a mat on hands and knees (a thin, inexpensive
E24 1540  2    mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not
E24 1540 11    require falling). He places the hands on either side
E24 1550  9    of the head, keeping the chin down on the chest. He
E24 1560  8    then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides
E24 1570  4    it over. One or two practice runs should be sufficient
E24 1580  1    for solo. If, however, the child is weak, overweight,
E24 1580 10    or afraid, more help will be needed. When the child
E24 1590  9    raises his seat into the air, the teacher takes hold
E24 1600  5    under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter what
E24 1610  2    happens, the child's performance will be controlled.
E24 1610  9    By lifting the seat upwards a little, the weight is
E24 1620  9    taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded.
E24 1630  6       These are beginnings, but correctly learned they
E24 1640  3    prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can
E24 1640 11    be performed by a strong, flexible body (we are not
E24 1650  9    talking of eccentric extremes). Even if gymnastics
E24 1660  4    are not the ultimate goal, the good tumbler will be
E24 1670  3    a better dancer, a better athlete, and a human being
E24 1670 13    with a greater margin of safety in any activity.
E24 1680  9       It is very important for parents to understand that
E24 1690  6    early training is imperative. And dancing school, so
E24 1700  3    helpful in artistic and psychological development,
E24 1700  9    also contributes to this essential early training-
E24 1710  7    and can contribute even more.
E25 0010  1       EVERY taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of
E25 0010 11    our annual defense budget and most of our readers also
E25 0020  8    realize that a large portion of these expenditures
E25 0030  4    go for military electronics. We have noted how some
E25 0040  2    electronic techniques, developed for the defense effort,
E25 0040  9    have evenutally been used in commerce and industry.
E25 0050  7    The host of novel applications of electronics to medical
E25 0060  5    problems is far more thrilling because of their implication
E25 0070  4    in matters concerning our health and vitality.
E25 0080  1       When we consider the electronic industry potential
E25 0080  8    for human betterment, the prospect is staggering. The
E25 0090  6    author has recently studied the field of medical electronics
E25 0100  6    and has been convinced that, in this area alone, the
E25 0110  4    application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.
E25 0120  1    The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine
E25 0120  9    may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery.
E25 0130  9    We use the term "bio-medicine" because of the close
E25 0140  7    interrelation between biology and medical research.
E25 0150  4       Electronics has been applied to medicine for many
E25 0160  3    years in the form of such familiar equipment as the
E25 0160 13    x-ray machine, the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy
E25 0170  6    machine. Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic
E25 0180  5    vibration machines for deep massage of bruises, contusions,
E25 0200  2    and simple bursitis.
E25 0200  5       Commonly used electronic devices which are found
E25 0210  5    in practically every hospital are closed-circuit ~TV
E25 0220  2    and audio systems for internal paging and instruction,
E25 0230  1    along with radiation counters, timers, and similar
E25 0230  8    devices.
E25 0240  1       In this article we will concentrate on the advances
E25 0240 10    in the application of electronics in bio-medical research
E25 0250  7    laboratories because this is where tomorrow's commonplace
E25 0260  5    equipment originates. From the wealth of material and
E25 0270  4    the wide variety of different electronic techniques
E25 0280  1    perfected in the past few years we have selected a
E25 0280 11    few examples which appear to be headed for use in the
E25 0290  9    immediate future and which offer completely new tools
E25 0300  3    in medical research.
E25 0300  6    #ULTRAVIOLET MICROSCOPY#
E25 0310  1    Many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are
E25 0310  8    transparent to visible light and must be stained for
E25 0320  7    microscopic investigation. This stain often disrupts
E25 0330  3    the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside.
E25 0340  1    A completely new insight into living cells and their
E25 0340 10    structure will be possible by use of a new technique
E25 0350 10    which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation
E25 0360  4    and combines a microscope with a color-~TV system to
E25 0370  3    view the results.
E25 0370  6       Fig& 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet
E25 0380  5    microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics
E25 0390  2    Center of Rockefeller Institute. By combining the talents
E25 0400  2    of a medical man, Dr& Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr&
E25 0401  1    Berkely, and an electronics expert, Dr& Zworykin, this
E25 0410  8    novel technique has been developed which promises to
E25 0420  7    open broad avenues to understanding life processes.
E25 0430  3       Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation
E25 0440  2    are selected by the variable filters placed in front
E25 0440 11    of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the
E25 0450  9    ultraviolet sources. These wavelengths are reflected
E25 0460  5    in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror;
E25 0470  3    the specimen is magnified by the microscope. Instead
E25 0480  1    of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the ~TV
E25 0480 11    camera does the "looking". The microscope and orthicon
E25 0490  8    are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet
E25 0500  7    spectrum, which means that all lenses must be quartz.
E25 0510  5       The video signal is amplified and then switched,
E25 0520  2    in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources
E25 0520 10    which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that
E25 0530  9    during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength,
E25 0540  6    corresponding to red, green, or blue, is seen. (Note:
E25 0550  3    Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source
E25 0560  1    to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like
E25 0560 11    assembly rotated by a synchronous motor. This assembly
E25 0570  7    also supplies a 20-~cps switching gate for the electronics
E25 0580  6    circuitry.) This is the same system as was used in
E25 0590  5    the field-sequential color-~TV system which preceded
E25 0600  1    the present simultaneous system. Three separate amplifiers
E25 0600  8    then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube. The result is a
E25 0610 11    color picture of the specimen where the primary colors
E25 0620  6    correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths.
E25 0630  2       Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent
E25 0640  3    to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter
E25 0670  1    wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum. Different
E25 0670  7    parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different
E25 0680  6    wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal
E25 0690  5    portions of cells in a different color. Where the microscope
E25 0700  4    under visible light may show only vague shadows or
E25 0710  2    nothing at all, ultraviolet illumination and subsequent
E25 0710  9    translation into a color ~TV picture reveal a wealth
E25 0720  9    of detail.
E25 0720 11       At the present time the research team which pioneered
E25 0730  8    this new technique is primarily interested in advancing
E25 0740  5    and perfecting it.
E25 0740  8    #BREATHING- ELECTRONICALLY ANALYZED#
E25 0750  3    The medical title of "Lobar Ventilation in Man" by
E25 0760  4    Drs& C& J& Martin and A& C& Young, covers a brief paper
E25 0770  4    which is one part of a much larger effort to apply
E25 0770 15    electronics to the study of the respiratory process.
E25 0780  8    At the University of Washington Medical School, the
E25 0790  6    electronics group has developed the "Respiratory Gas
E25 0800  4    Analyzer" shown in Fig& 3. This unit, affectionately
E25 0810  2    dubbed "The Monster", can be wheeled to any convenient
E25 0820  1    location and provides a wealth of information about
E25 0820  9    the patient's breathing.
E25 0830  2       In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates
E25 0840  2    the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from
E25 0840 10    the upper and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume
E25 0850 10    of inhalation per breath, the flow of air from both
E25 0860  7    lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes with respect
E25 0870  3    to each other. Usually the patient breathes into a
E25 0870 12    mouthpiece while walking a treadmill, standing still,
E25 0880  7    or in some other medically significant position. From
E25 0890  4    the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects
E25 0900  3    with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail.
E25 0900  9    #HEART-MEASURING TECHNIQUES#
E25 0910  2    The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates
E25 0920  2    irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques
E25 0920  9    allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through
E25 0930  9    the aorta, dimensioning of the heart and its chambers,
E25 0940  7    and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat. For
E25 0950  4    many of these measurements the chest must be opened,
E25 0960  1    but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.
E25 0960 11       A group of researchers at the University of Washington
E25 0970 10    have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these
E25 0980  9    techniques. One simple method of measuring the expansion
E25 0990  6    of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube, filled with
E25 1000  4    mercury, around the heart and record the change in
E25 1010  2    resistance as the tube is stretched. A balanced resistance
E25 1010 11    bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation
E25 1020 10    needed.
E25 1030  1       Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the
E25 1030 11    heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite
E25 1040  6    sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one
E25 1050  4    with some pulsed ultrasonic energy. The travel time
E25 1060  2    of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second
E25 1060 12    thus it takes about 16 |msec& to traverse 25 mm& of
E25 1070  7    tissue. A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and
E25 1080  5    time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue
E25 1090  3    evaluation. In addition to the heart and aorta, successful
E25 1100  1    measurements of liver and spleen have also been made
E25 1100 10    by this technique. The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic
E25 1110  6    signals, can be employed to measure the flow of blood
E25 1120  6    without cutting into the blood vessel.
E25 1130  1       A still more sophisticated system has been devised
E25 1130  9    for determining the effective power of the heart itself.
E25 1140  8    It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement
E25 1150  3    of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted
E25 1160  2    into the bloodstream. The latter measures the heat
E25 1160 10    carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of
E25 1170  9    the velocity of the blood flow. It is also possible
E25 1180  6    to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted at the end
E25 1190  4    of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left
E25 1200  1    ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart
E25 1200 10    itself. This pressure measurement may be made at the
E25 1210  7    same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement
E25 1220  2    is made. A simplified version of the instrumentation
E25 1230  1    for this procedure is shown in Fig& 2. Outputs of the
E25 1230 12    two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit
E25 1240  9    and a resistance bridge, followed by a simple analogue
E25 1250  6    computer which feeds a multichannel recorder. From
E25 1260  2    this doctors can read heart rate, change in diameter,
E25 1260 11    pressure, and effective heart power.
E25 1270  5    #RADIO-TRANSMITTER PILLS#
E25 1270  8    Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio
E25 1280 10    transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the
E25 1290  7    patient and which would then radio internal pressure
E25 1300  2    data to external receivers. This original capsule contained
E25 1310  1    a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about
E25 1310 10    1 cm& in diameter. Battery life limited the use of
E25 1320  8    this "pill" to about 8 to 30 hours maximum.
E25 1330  5       A refinement of this technique has been described
E25 1340  1    by Drs& Zworykin and Farrar and Mr& Berkely of the
E25 1340 11    Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute.
E25 1350  7    In this novel arrangement the "pill" is much smaller
E25 1360  8    and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor
E25 1370  6    is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer. As shown
E25 1380  4    in Fig& 4, an external antenna is placed over or around
E25 1390  3    the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short
E25 1390 13    400-kc& bursts. The energy received by the "pill" causes
E25 1400  9    the resonant circuit to "ring" on after the burst and
E25 1410  9    this "ringing" takes place at the resonant frequency
E25 1420  6    of the "pill". These frequencies are amplified and
E25 1430  4    detected by the ~FM receiver after each burst of transmitted
E25 1440  3    energy and, after the "pill" has been calibrated, precise
E25 1450  2    internal pressure indications can be obtained.
E25 1450  8       One of the advantages of this method is that the
E25 1460  9    "pill" can remain in the patient for several days,
E25 1470  5    permitting observation under natural conditions. Applications
E25 1480  2    to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are
E25 1490  1    planned for future experiments.
E25 1490  5    #SONAR IN MEDICAL RESEARCH#
E25 1490  9    One of the most gratifying applications of an important
E25 1500  9    technique of submarine detection is in the exploration
E25 1510  6    of the human body. Our readers are familiar with the
E25 1520  5    principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out
E25 1530  2    in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects.
E25 1530 11    Various methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying
E25 1540  7    these sound waves are used to detect submarines, map
E25 1550  5    ocean floors, and even communicate under water. In
E25 1560  2    medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers
E25 1560  9    and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and
E25 1570  8    different scanning techniques may be used, but the
E25 1580  6    principles involved are the same as in sonar.
E25 1590  1       Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission
E25 1590  9    of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles
E25 1600  8    and blood vessels. Bones and cartilage transmit poorly
E25 1610  6    and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals. Based on
E25 1620  4    this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used
E25 1630  1    this method to "look through" human organs. A good
E25 1630 10    example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation
E25 1640  7    is contained in papers presented by Dr& G& Baum who
E25 1650  7    has explored the human eye. He can diagnose detachment
E25 1660  4    of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness
E25 1670  2    due to glaucoma. The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically
E25 1680  1    is illustrated in Fig& 6. The transducer is coupled
E25 1680 10    to the body through a water bath, not shown. For display,
E25 1690 10    Dr& Baum uses a portion of an **f, an airborne radar
E25 1700  9    indicator, and then photographs the screen to obtain
E25 1710  5    a permanent record.
E25 1710  8       A typical "sonogram" of a human eye, together with
E25 1720  7    a description of the anatomical parts, is shown in
E25 1730  5    Fig& 5. The frequency used for these experiments is
E25 1740  2    15 mc& and the transducer is a specially cut crystal
E25 1740 12    with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters
E25 1750  7    smaller than one millimeter. The transducer itself
E25 1760  4    moves the beam in a sector scan, just like a radar
E25 1770  3    antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved
E25 1770 11    over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to "look into"
E25 1780 12    all corners. The total picture is only seen by the
E25 1790  7    camera which integrates the many sector scans over
E25 1800  3    the entire 90-degree rotation period.
E25 1800  9       Drs& Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado
E25 1810  8    Medical School have applied the same sonar technique
E25 1820  5    to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely
E25 1830  3    good results. By submerging the patient in a tub and
E25 1840  2    rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on,
E25 1840 10    they have been able to get cross-section views of the
E25 1850  9    neck, as shown in Fig& 7, as well as many other hitherto
E25 1860  6    impossible insights. As mentioned before, bone reflects
E25 1870  3    the sound energy and in Fig& 7 the portion of the spine
E25 1880  2    shows as the black area in the center. Arteries and
E25 1880 12    veins are apparent by their black, blood-filled centers
E25 1890  7    and the surrounding white walls.
E25 1900  2       A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown
E25 1900 13    in Fig& 8 with the various parts labeled.
E26 0010  1       OERSTED'S boyhood represented a minimal chance of
E26 0010  8    either attaining greatness or serving his people so
E26 0020  8    well and over so long a span of life. He was born in
E26 0030  8    the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of
E26 0040  4    Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August
E26 0050  1    14, 1777. His father Soeren was the village apothecary
E26 0050 10    whose slender income made it difficult to feed his
E26 0060  8    family, let alone educate them in a town without even
E26 0070  7    a school. The two older boys, Hans and Anders, his
E26 0080  2    junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home
E26 0080 12    of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction
E26 0090  7    in German; his wife taught the two boys to read and
E26 0100  8    write Danish. Other brothers later joined them for
E26 0110  3    instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also
E26 0110 10    arithmetic was added to Bible reading, German, and
E26 0120  8    Danish in the informal curriculum. Oldenburg's contributions
E26 0130  4    were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider
E26 0140  8    circle of the town's learned, such as the pastor, to
E26 0150  4    supplement the simple teaching. From the town surveyor,
E26 0160  1    Hans learned drawing and mathematics and, from a university
E26 0160 10    student, some academic subjects. The mayor of the town
E26 0170  9    taught them English and French. Whatever Hans or Anders
E26 0180  7    learned separately they passed on to each other; they
E26 0190  6    read every book that they could borrow in the village.
E26 0200  2    At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father
E26 0200 12    in the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his
E26 0210  8    interest in medicine and science. His earlier love
E26 0220  6    for literature and history remained with him for his
E26 0230  4    entire life.
E26 0230  6       In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University
E26 0240  3    of Copenhagen (founded in 1479) and the following spring
E26 0250  2    found them at the university preparing to matriculate
E26 0250 10    for the autumn session. While Hans devoted himself
E26 0260  7    to the sciences of medicine, physics, and astronomy,
E26 0270  4    his brother studied law. The brothers continued to
E26 0280  2    help each other during their studies, sharing a joint
E26 0280 11    purse, lodging together in the dormitory and dining
E26 0290  8    together at the home of their aunt. They supplemented
E26 0300  5    their income by small government assistance, by tutoring
E26 0310  3    and economizing wherever they could. So impressive
E26 0320  1    were those serious years of study at the university
E26 0320 10    that Hans later wrote, "to be perfectly free, the young
E26 0330  8    man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and
E26 0340  5    imagination; there is a struggle there, in which, if
E26 0350  2    he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is
E26 0350 14    freedom of utterance there, which draws after it no
E26 0360  9    irreparable consequences on society **h. I lived in
E26 0370  6    this onward-driving contest where each day overcame
E26 0380  2    a new difficulty, gained a new truth, or banished a
E26 0380 12    previous error". He openly proclaimed his pleasure
E26 0390  7    in lecturing and writing about science. In this third
E26 0400  6    year at the university, Hans, in 1797, was awarded
E26 0410  3    the first important token of recognition, a gold medal
E26 0410 12    for his essay on "Limits of Poetry and Prose". He completed
E26 0420 11    his training in pharmacy also, taking his degree with
E26 0430  8    high honors in 1797, and in 1799 was awarded the degree
E26 0440  8    of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay
E26 0450  6    in medicine. He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis
E26 0460  1    which later was accepted in chemical practices.
E26 0460  8    #FERMENT OF SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITY#
E26 0470  2    HAN'S STUDENT DAYS were at a time when Europe was in
E26 0480  3    a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions
E26 0480 10    in America and in France, Germany and Italy were rising
E26 0490  9    from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual
E26 0500  7    awareness was sweeping the Continent.
E26 0510  2       The new century opened with Oersted beginning his
E26 0520  2    professional career in charge of an apothecary shop
E26 0520 10    in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university. He
E26 0530  8    was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery
E26 0550  2    of chemical electricity and he immediately applied
E26 0560  1    the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis.
E26 0560 10    The following year he devoted to the customary "Wanderjahr",
E26 0570  8    traveling in Germany, France, and the Netherlands,
E26 0580  6    meeting the philosophers Schelling, Fichte, and Tieck.
E26 0590  4    He also met Count Rumford (born Benjamin Thompson in
E26 0600  3    Woburn, Mass&) who was then serving the Elector of
E26 0610  2    Bavaria, and the physicist Ritter; these were Oersted's
E26 0610 10    main contacts in science.
E26 0620  4       From Go^ttingen (1801) where he stayed for 10 days,
E26 0630  4    he wrote, "The first question asked everywhere is about
E26 0640  2    galvanism. As everybody is curious to see the battery
E26 0640 11    of glass tubes I have invented, I have had quite a
E26 0650 10    small one made here of four glass tubes (in Copenhagen
E26 0660  4    I used 30) and intend to carry it with me". Oersted
E26 0670  2    joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks,
E26 0670 13    continuing their correspondence after he left. With
E26 0680  7    Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of
E26 0690  6    ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized
E26 0700  4    mind. Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay
E26 0710  4    in French which was submitted to the Institut de France
E26 0720  1    for its annual prize of 3,000 francs. The sound discoveries
E26 0720 11    of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of
E26 0730 10    fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him. In
E26 0740  7    May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight of fancy, wrote
E26 0750  4    to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.
E26 0760  1    He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena
E26 0760 10    and indicated that the years of maximum inclination
E26 0770  8    of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important
E26 0780  6    electrical discoveries. Thus, 1745 corresponded to
E26 0790  2    the invention of the "Leiden" jar by Kleist, 1764 that
E26 0800  2    of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser
E26 0800 11    of Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile. Ritter proceeded,
E26 0810  9    "You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the
E26 0820 10    year 1819 or 1820, you will have to reckon. This we
E26 0830  5    might well witness". Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted
E26 0840  2    not only lived to see the event occur but was the author
E26 0840 14    of it.
E26 0850  2       In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied
E26 0850 10    for the university's chair in physics but was rejected
E26 0860  9    because he was probably considered more a philosopher
E26 0870  5    than a physicist. However, he continued experimenting
E26 0880  2    and lecturing, publishing the results of his experiments
E26 0890  1    in German and Danish periodicals. In 1806 his ambition
E26 0890 10    was realized and he became professor of physics at
E26 0900  9    the Copenhagen University, though not realizing full
E26 0910  5    professorship (ordinarius) until 1817.
E26 0920  1       During Oersted's attendance at the university, it
E26 0920  8    was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting
E26 0930  7    in the sciences. He was, however, fortunate in his
E26 0940  7    contact with Prof& J& G& L& Manthey (1769-1842), teacher
E26 0950  6    of chemistry, who, in addition to his academic chair,
E26 0960  4    was also proprietor of the "Lion Pharmacy" in Copenhagen
E26 0980  2    where Oersted assisted him. Manthey maintained a valuable
E26 0990  1    collection of physical and chemical apparatus which
E26 0990  8    was at Oersted's disposal during and after his graduation.
E26 1000  7    In 1800, Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed
E26 1010  6    manager of the Lion Pharmacy. In February 1801, Oersted
E26 1020  4    did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and
E26 1030  2    reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of
E26 1030 10    600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments
E26 1040  9    with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead. In the
E26 1050  7    following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously with
E26 1060  2    Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength
E26 1060  9    of a voltaic battery more than did salts. Eager as
E26 1070  8    he was to pursue this promising line, he was so loaded
E26 1080  6    down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures
E26 1090  3    in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the
E26 1090 11    university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons
E26 1100  8    to "galvanizing".
E26 1110  1       He assumed his academic career with the same intensity
E26 1110 10    and thoroughness that had marked every step in his
E26 1120  9    rise from boyhood. The university was the only one
E26 1130  6    in Denmark and the status of professor represented
E26 1140  2    the upper social level. His broad interest in literary,
E26 1140 11    political, and philosophical movements opened many
E26 1150  6    doors to him. His friends were numerous and their ties
E26 1160  6    to him were strong.
E26 1160 10       The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France
E26 1170 10    again, but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek
E26 1180  8    out the philosophers as he had on his first journey.
E26 1190  3    In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws
E26 1200  1    of nature in German and this was issued in French translation
E26 1200 12    (Paris, 1813) under the title Recherches sur l'identite
E26 1210  8    des forces chimiques et electriques, a work held in
E26 1220  7    very high esteem by the new generation of research
E26 1240  3    chemists. His interest in finding a relationship between
E26 1250  1    voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated.
E26 1250  9    Chapter /8, is entitled "On Magnetism" and in it are
E26 1260 10    included such remarks as, "One has always been tempted
E26 1270  8    to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical
E26 1280  4    forces. The great resemblance between electrical and
E26 1290  2    magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity
E26 1290  9    of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison.
E26 1300  8    It is true, that nothing has been found comparable
E26 1310  6    with electricity by communication; but the phenomena
E26 1320  4    observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending
E26 1330  2    on electrical distribution that one could not find
E26 1330 10    the slightest difference **h. The form of galvanic
E26 1340  7    activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the
E26 1350  6    electrical form. There, forces are more latent than
E26 1360  2    in electricity, and less than in magnetism **h. But
E26 1360 11    in such an important question, we would be satisfied
E26 1370  8    if the judgment were that the principal objection to
E26 1380  5    the identity of forces which produce electricity and
E26 1390  2    magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which
E26 1390 12    is contrary to it **h. One could also add to these
E26 1400 11    analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat, which
E26 1410  7    proves that steel becomes a better conductor through
E26 1420  3    a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.
E26 1430  1    It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies
E26 1430 11    of nature, as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb. By that,
E26 1440  8    one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical
E26 1450  7    forces. An attempt should be made to see if electricity,
E26 1460  5    in its most latent stage, has any action on the magnet
E26 1470  2    as such". His plan and intent were clearly charted.
E26 1480  1       Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part
E26 1480  9    in university and political discussions. In one debate
E26 1490  6    he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to
E26 1500  4    dogma, in another he held that the practice of science
E26 1510  1    was in fact an act of religious worship. He continued
E26 1510 11    as a popular lecturer. He devised a detonating fuse
E26 1520  7    in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric
E26 1530  7    current.
E26 1530  8       In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very
E26 1540  5    successful geological expedition to Bornholm, one of
E26 1550  3    the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in
E26 1550 12    the expedition. It was with the assistance of one of
E26 1560  9    the members of this expedition, Lauritz Esmarch, that
E26 1570  4    Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an
E26 1580  4    electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an
E26 1580 12    electric current was made to flow. Together they also
E26 1590  9    developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden
E26 1600  9    trough was replaced by one of copper, thereby producing
E26 1610  4    stronger currents. Esmarch was among those who witnessed
E26 1620  3    Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery.
E26 1620  9    #DISCOVERY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM#
E26 1630  3    THE ASSOCIATION between electric (both electrostatic
E26 1640  3    and voltaic) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized
E26 1650  2    by investigators for many decades. Electrical literature
E26 1660  1    contained numerous references to lightning that had
E26 1660  8    magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass
E26 1670  7    needles. In the late 1700's Beccaria and van Marum,
E26 1680  5    among others, had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic
E26 1690  3    charge through it. Beccaria had almost stumbled on
E26 1700  1    a lead to the relationship between electricity and
E26 1700  9    magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent
E26 1710  7    transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel
E26 1720  5    making its ends magnetic. The resulting magnetic effect
E26 1730  2    proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise.
E26 1740  1    The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already
E26 1740  9    been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect
E26 1750  9    relationship between these two primary forces. Oersted's
E26 1760  5    own earlier experiments were unimpressive, possibly
E26 1770  2    because he had, like other experimenters, laid the
E26 1770 10    conducting wire across the compass needle instead of
E26 1780  8    parallel with it.
E26 1790  1       The sequence of events leading to his important
E26 1790  9    discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that
E26 1800  6    one of the advanced students at the university related
E26 1810  3    that the first direct event that led to the publication
E26 1820  1    of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture
E26 1820  9    made before a group of other advanced students in the
E26 1830 10    spring of 1820. At this lecture Oersted happened to
E26 1840  6    place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic
E26 1850  4    needle.
E27 0010  1    Knowing specifically what the many feed additives can
E27 0010  9    do and how and when to feed them can make a highly
E27 0020 11    competitive business more profitable for beef, dairy,
E27 0030  5    and sheep men.
E27 0030  8       The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which
E27 0040  7    additives do what. All the additives listed here are
E27 0050  4    sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration
E27 0060  1    of the federal government. All comments concerning
E27 0060  8    effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully
E27 0070  8    reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with ~FDA.
E27 0080  5       This article assumes that the rations you are feeding
E27 0090  5    your beef, dairy cattle, and sheep are adequately balanced
E27 0100  2    with protein, vitamins, and minerals.
E27 0100  7       The drug's chemical name is listed, since most states
E27 0110  8    require feed processors to use this name instead of
E27 0120  7    the trade name on the feed tag. In some instances,
E27 0130  1    the trade name is shown in parentheses following the
E27 0130 10    chemical name. This indicates that this drug is being
E27 0140  9    marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory
E27 0150  6    organizations have approved its use on the feed tag.

E27 1610  6    #DRUG'S CHEMICAL NAME:#

E27 1620  2    _WHAT IT DOES:_
E27 1620  5       A tranquilizer fed to cattle (other than lactating
E27 1630  3    dairy cows) prior to their being subjected to stress
E27 1640  1    conditions such as vaccinating, shipping, weaning calves,
E27 1640  8    and excessive handling.
E27 1650  2    _HOW TO FEED:_
E27 1650  5       Not less than .75 milligram but not more than 1.25
E27 1660  4    milligrams of additive per pound of body weight.
E27 1670  1    _CAUTION:_
E27 1670  1       Additive should not be fed 72 hours before animals
E27 1670 10    are slaughtered. There are three principal feed bunk
E27 1690  7    types for dairy and beef cattle: (1) Fence-line bunks-
E27 1700  5    cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from
E27 1710  5    the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons;
E27 1720  1    (2) Mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot,
E27 1720 10    are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface;
E27 1730  8    (3) Special bunks- as discussed here, they permit cattle
E27 1740  9    to eat from all sides. Feed is put in with an elevator.
E27 1750  6       Several materials or combinations of materials can
E27 1760  3    be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk. The
E27 1760 12    selection of materials depends on skills of available
E27 1770  8    labor for installation, cost of materials available
E27 1780  5    locally, and your own preference. No one material is
E27 1790  4    best for all situations. Selecting bunks by economic
E27 1800  1    comparison is usually an individual problem.
E27 1800  7    #FENCE-LINE FEEDING.#
E27 1810  1    Animals eat only from one side, so the fence-line bunk
E27 1810 12    must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk. These
E27 1820  8    bunks also serve as a fence, so part of the additional
E27 1830  6    cost must be attributed to the fence. Because of their
E27 1840  3    location, on the edge of the feed lot, fence-line bunks
E27 1840 14    are not in the way of mechanical manure removal. Filling
E27 1850 10    these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used
E27 1860  7    to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more
E27 1870  4    time and operations.
E27 1870  7       All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding
E27 1880  7    floor so access will be possible all year. This will
E27 1890  4    be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.
E28 0010  1    MARKETING in the new decade will be no picnic- for
E28 0010 11    the sixties will present possibly the most intense
E28 0020  7    competitive activity that you have experienced in the
E28 0030  5    last 20-25 yr&.
E28 0030  9       Why? Companies of all types have made great advances
E28 0040  7    in production capabilities and efficiencies- in modern
E28 0050  5    equipment and new processes, enlarged ~R+D facilities,
E28 0060  2    faster new product development. Many companies have
E28 0060  9    upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling,
E28 0070  8    distribution, and promotion techniques to gain a bigger
E28 0080  6    competitive edge.
E28 0080  8       Given this kind of business climate, what competitive
E28 0090  7    marketing problems will your company face in the next
E28 0100  6    10 yr&? Based on our experience with clients, we see
E28 0110  4    14 major problems which fall into three broad groups-
E28 0120  3    the market place itself, marketing methods, and marketing
E28 0120 11    management.
E28 0130  1    #1. PROBLEMS IN THE MARKET#
E28 0140  1    _@ GREATER PRICE-CONSCIOUSNESS._
E28 0140  1       There has been an intensification of price-consciousness
E28 0140  9    in recent years; there is every indication it will
E28 0150  8    continue. Frequently, wittingly or unwittingly,
E28 0160  3    price-consciousness
E28 0160  5    has been fostered by manufacturers, distributors, and
E28 0170  3    dealers. Despite generally good levels of income, we
E28 0180  3    see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling
E28 0190  1    back along the chain from consumer to distributor to
E28 0190 10    manufacturer.
E28 0200  1       Here are some key areas to examine to make sure
E28 0200 11    your pricing strategy will be on target:
E28 0210  5       Has the probable price situation in your field been
E28 0220  4    forecast as a basis for future planning? Have cost
E28 0230  1    studies been made of every phase of your operation
E28 0230 10    to determine what might be done if things get worse?
E28 0240  7    Have you actually checked out (not just mentally tested)
E28 0250  4    different selling approaches designed to counter the
E28 0260  2    price competition problem?
E28 0270  1    _@ INCREASED CUSTOMER SOPHISTICATION._
E28 0270  1       Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated
E28 0270  7    regarding product and advertising claims, partly because
E28 0280  7    of widespread criticism of such assertions. This problem
E28 0290  6    can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds
E28 0300  4    of businesses. Have you examined this problem of increasing
E28 0310  2    consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your
E28 0310  9    own company?
E28 0320  1    _@ GREATER DEMAND FOR SERVICES._
E28 0320  6       Need for service is here to stay- and the problem
E28 0330  6    is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties. There
E28 0340  3    are two reasons for this. First, most products tend
E28 0340 12    to become more complex. Second, in a competitive market,
E28 0350  9    the customer feels his weight and throws it around.
E28 0360  8       Providing good customer service requires as thorough
E28 0370  5    a marketing and general management planning job as
E28 0380  3    the original selling of the product. Too often it is
E28 0390  1    thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.
E28 0390 11       Good service starts with product design and planning:
E28 0400  8    Many products seem to be designed for a production
E28 0410  7    economy, not for a service one. Proper follow-through
E28 0420  3    requires training your own sales organization, and
E28 0430  1    your distributor organizations, not only in the techniques
E28 0430  9    but also in good customer relations.
E28 0440  5       Have you assessed the importance of service and
E28 0450  3    given it proper attention?
E28 0460  1    _@ WIDER DISCRETIONARY CHOICES FOR CUSTOMERS._
E28 0460  4       In spending his money today, the consumer is pulled
E28 0470  2    in many directions. To the manufacturer of the more
E28 0470 11    convenient-type product- the purchase of which can
E28 0480  6    be switched, delayed, or put off entirely- the implications
E28 0490  6    are important. Your competition is now proportionately
E28 0500  4    greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers
E28 0510  1    in the same field but also against a vast array of
E28 0510 12    manufacturers of other appealing consumer products.
E28 0520  6       Many industry trade associations are developing
E28 0530  4    campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's
E28 0540  4    dollar being spent on their particular products. Has
E28 0550  2    your company thought through its strategy in this whole
E28 0550 11    "discretionary buying" area?
E28 0560  3    _@ GEOGRAPHIC SHIFT OF CUSTOMERS._
E28 0570  1       The trends have been in evidence for many years-
E28 0570 10    population shifts to the Southwest and Far West, and
E28 0580  8    from city to suburbs. These shifts will continue in
E28 0590  4    the next 10 yr&. Have you considered the implications
E28 0600  1    of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force
E28 0600 10    allocation, strength of distributor organizations,
E28 0610  5    and even plant location?
E28 0620  1    _@ MARKET CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN FEWER ACCOUNTS._
E28 0630  1       We have already witnessed great changes through
E28 0630  7    mergers and acquisitions in the food industry- at both
E28 0640  7    the manufacturing and retail ends. Instead of relatively
E28 0650  4    small sales to many accounts, there are now larger
E28 0660  1    sales to or through fewer accounts.
E28 0660  7       The change may require different products, pricing,
E28 0670  4    packaging, warehousing, salesmanship, advertising and
E28 0680  2    executive attention- practically every link in the
E28 0680  9    marketing network may have to be adjusted. Have you
E28 0690  9    examined these trends, forecast the effects, and planned
E28 0700  6    your marketing strategy to compete effectively under
E28 0710  3    changing circumstances?
E28 0710  5    #2. PROBLEMS IN MARKETING METHODS#
E28 0720  2    _@ MORE PRIVATE LABEL COMPETITION._
E28 0720  7       In the area of private label competition, it is
E28 0730  7    logical to expect a continuation of trends which have
E28 0740  4    been under way during the first decade. As mass dealer
E28 0750  1    and distributor organizations grow in size, there is
E28 0750  9    every reason to expect them to try to share in the
E28 0760 10    manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits-
E28 0770  3    which is, in effect, what the sale of private brands
E28 0780  2    tends to do.
E28 0780  5       Average manufacturer frequently has helped build
E28 0790  3    private brand business, delivering largely the same
E28 0790 10    qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as
E28 0800  8    in branded. Moreover, the larger and more aggressive
E28 0810  6    mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted
E28 0820  4    on high quality- and the customer seems to have caught
E28 0830  2    on.
E28 0830  3       If you are up against private brand competition,
E28 0840  1    have you formulated a long-term program for researching
E28 0840 10    and strengthening your market position? If private
E28 0850  6    brand competition hasn't been felt in your product
E28 0860  5    field as yet, have you thought how you will cope with
E28 0870  2    it if and when it does appear?
E28 0880  1    _@ LESS PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP._
E28 0880  1       Display merchandising, backed by pre-selling through
E28 0880  8    advertising and promotion, will continue to make strides
E28 0890  8    in the sixties. It has multiple implications and possible
E28 0900  6    headaches for your marketing program.
E28 0910  1       How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of
E28 0910 12    outlet and still maintain relationships with older
E28 0920  7    existing outlets which are still important? If you
E28 0930  5    have a higher-quality product, how can you make it
E28 0940  3    stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken
E28 0950  1    word? Salesmanship is still necessary, but it's a different
E28 0950 10    brand of salesmanship.
E28 0960  3       Have you carefully examined the selling techniques
E28 0970  1    which best suit your products? Have you studied the
E28 0970 10    caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in
E28 0980  9    relation to requirements for effective marketing? Are
E28 0990  5    you experimenting with different selling slants in
E28 1000  3    developing new customers?
E28 1010  1    _@ HIGHER COSTS OF DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY._
E28 1010  2       Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive
E28 1020  1    pressure, some by the fact that the customers have
E28 1020 10    come to expect certain niceties and flourishes. No
E28 1030  6    manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out
E28 1040  4    the costs involved.
E28 1040  7       The use of bulk handling is continuously growing.
E28 1050  5    Computers are being used to keep branch inventories
E28 1060  2    at more workable levels. "Selective selling"- concentrating
E28 1080  2    sales on the larger accounts- has been used effectively
E28 1090  1    by some manufacturers.
E28 1090  4       There may be possible economies at any one of a
E28 1100  4    number of links in your marketing and distribution
E28 1100 12    chain. Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these
E28 1110  9    links regularly and carefully- and with some imagination?
E28 1120  7    In your sales force, will a smaller number of higher-priced,
E28 1130  6    high-quality salesmen serve you best, or can you make
E28 1140  5    out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen?
E28 1150  1       Will your trade customers settle for less attention
E28 1150  9    and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can
E28 1160 10    share? In one company covering the country with a high-quality
E28 1170  8    sales force of 10 men, the president personally phones
E28 1180  4    each major account every 6 mos&. As a result, distribution
E28 1190  3    costs were cut, customer relations improved.
E28 1200  1       Distribution costs are almost bound to increase
E28 1200  8    in the sixties- and you will never know what you can
E28 1210  9    do to control them unless you study each element and
E28 1220  4    experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.
E28 1230  1    _@ HIGHER COSTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION._
E28 1230  8       From the manufacturer's point of view, the increasing
E28 1240  6    cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem
E28 1250  6    to be faced in the sixties. It is accentuated by the
E28 1260  3    need for pre-selling goods, and private label competition.
E28 1270  1       How much fundamental thinking and research has your
E28 1270  9    company done on its advertising program? Are you following
E28 1280  9    competition willy-nilly- trying to match dollar for
E28 1290  8    dollar- or are you experimenting with new means for
E28 1300  5    reaching and influencing consumers? Have you evaluated
E28 1310  2    the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion
E28 1320  1    in your total marketing program- from the standpoint
E28 1320  9    of effort, money, and effectiveness?
E28 1340  1    _@ INCREASING TEMPO OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT._
E28 1340  1       Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting
E28 1340  8    products on the horizon. Will you be out in the market
E28 1350 11    place with some of these sales-building new products?
E28 1360  5       If competition beats you to it, this exciting new
E28 1370  4    product era can have real headaches in store. On the
E28 1380  2    other hand, the process of obsoleting an old product
E28 1380 11    and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive.
E28 1390  8    As markets become larger and marketing more complex,
E28 1400  5    the costs of an error become progressively larger.
E28 1410  2       Is your ~R+D or product development program tuned
E28 1420  1    in to the commercial realities of the market? Are there
E28 1420 11    regular communications from the field, or meetings
E28 1430  6    of sales and marketing personnel with ~R+D people?
E28 1440  4    Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing, but it's
E28 1450  3    useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register.
E28 1460  1       Are there individuals in your organization who can
E28 1460  9    shepherd a new product through to commercialization;
E28 1470  7    who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume,
E28 1480  5    production, and distribution costs; and translate the
E28 1500  3    whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures
E28 1500 12    which management can act on with some assurance? We
E28 1510  9    have seen good new products shelved because no one
E28 1520  6    had the assignment to develop such facts and plans-
E28 1530  3    and management couldn't make up its mind.
E28 1530 10    #3. PROBLEMS IN MARKETING MANAGEMENT#
E28 1550  1    _@ SHORTAGE OF SKILLED SALESMEN._
E28 1550  1       There is a shortage of salesmen today. In the future,
E28 1550 11    quantitative demand will be greater because of the
E28 1560  8    expansion of the economy, and the qualitative need
E28 1570  4    will be greater still.
E28 1570  8       While many companies have done fine work in developing
E28 1580  7    sales personnel, much of it has been product rather
E28 1590  3    than sales training. Nor has the training been enough
E28 1600  1    in relation to the need. Most marketing people agree
E28 1600 10    it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future
E28 1610  8    requirements.
E28 1610  9       Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for
E28 1620  8    the future (both quantitatively and qualitatively)?
E28 1630  3    Has your company developed selection and training processes
E28 1640  3    that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen
E28 1650  1    you will need in the next 10 yr&?
E28 1660  1    _@ SHORTAGE OF SALES MANAGEMENT TALENT._
E28 1660  2       With the growing complexity of markets and intensity
E28 1670  1    of competition, sales management, whether at the district,
E28 1670  9    region or headquarters level, is a tough job today-
E28 1680  8    and it will be tougher in the future. Men qualified
E28 1690  5    for the broader task of marketing manager are even
E28 1700  3    more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications
E28 1710  1    called for by this type of management work. The growth
E28 1710 11    of business has outdistanced the available supply,
E28 1720  6    and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in
E28 1730  5    the sixties.
E28 1730  7       Does your company have a program for selecting and
E28 1740  4    developing sales and marketing management personnel
E28 1750  1    for the longer term? Does your management climate and
E28 1750 10    your management compensation plan attract and keep
E28 1760  6    top-notch marketing people?
E28 1770  1    _@ COMPLEXITY OF COMPLETE MARKETING PLANNING._
E28 1770  7       Every single problem touched on thus far is related
E28 1780  8    to good marketing planning. "Hip-pocket" tactics are
E28 1790  3    going to be harder to apply. Many food and beverage
E28 1800  2    companies are already on a highly planned basis. They
E28 1800 11    have to be. With greater investments in plant facilities,
E28 1810  9    with automation growing, you can't switch around, either
E28 1820  7    in volume or in product design, as much as was formerly
E28 1830  7    possible- or at least not as economically.
E28 1840  1       Are planning and strategy development emphasized
E28 1840  7    sufficiently in your company? We find too many sales
E28 1850  9    and marketing executives so burdened with detail that
E28 1860  6    they are short-changing planning.
E28 1870  1       Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your
E28 1870  8    management group to get the perspective of all individuals
E28 1880  9    and get everyone on the marketing team? Do you have
E28 1890  6    a long-term (5- or 10-yr&) marketing program?
E28 1900  2       The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in
E28 1900 11    defining your company's marketing problems realistically.
E28 1910  6    Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately
E28 1920  7    pinpoint your problems, whether they be in the market,
E28 1930  7    in marketing methods or in marketing management.
E28 1940  2       If companies will take the time to give objective
E28 1950  1    consideration to their major problems and to the questions
E28 1950 10    they provoke, then a long constructive step will have
E28 1960  8    been taken toward more effective marketing in next
E28 1970  4    decade.
E29 0010  1    The controversy of the last few years over whether
E29 0010 10    architects or interior designers should plan the interiors
E29 0020  6    of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus
E29 0030  4    one important difference of opinion. The architects
E29 0040  1    do not believe that the education of the interior designer
E29 0040 11    is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare
E29 0050  7    with that of the architect and that, therefore, the
E29 0060  5    interior designer is incapable of understanding the
E29 0070  2    architectural principles involved in planning the interior
E29 0080  1    of a building.
E29 0080  4       Ordinary politeness may have militated against this
E29 0090  2    opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide
E29 0090 12    acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through
E29 0100  9    the many round tables, workshops or panel discussions-
E29 0110  4    whatever they are called- on this subject will recognize
E29 0120  3    that the final, boiled down crux of the matter is education.
E29 0130  2       It is true that most architectural schools have
E29 0130 10    five year courses, some even have six or more. The
E29 0140 10    element of public danger which enters so largely into
E29 0150  6    architectural certification, however, would demand
E29 0160  3    a prolonged study of structure. This would, naturally,
E29 0170  1    lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic
E29 0170  9    demands of interior designer's training.
E29 0180  3       We may then dismiss the time difference between
E29 0190  2    these courses and the usual four year course of the
E29 0190 12    interior design student as not having serious bearing
E29 0200  8    on the subject. The real question that follows is-
E29 0210  6    how are those four years used and what is their value
E29 0220  4    as training?
E29 0220  6       The American Institute of Interior Designers has
E29 0230  3    published a recommended course for designers and a
E29 0240  2    percentage layout of such a course. An examination
E29 0240 10    of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses
E29 0250  6    in interior design, for the most part schools accredited
E29 0260  4    by membership in the National Association of Schools
E29 0270  2    of Art, and a further "on the spot" inspection of a
E29 0270 13    number of schools, show their courses adhere pretty
E29 0280  8    closely to the recommendations. One or two of the schools
E29 0290  7    have a five year curriculum, but the usual pattern
E29 0300  4    of American education has limited most of them to the
E29 0310  2    four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable
E29 0310 13    institutions.
E29 0320  1       The suggested course of the A&I&D& was based on
E29 0330  2    the usual course offered and on the opinion of many
E29 0330 12    educators as to curricular necessities. Obviously,
E29 0340  4    the four year provision limits this to fundamentals
E29 0350  3    and much desirable material must be eliminated.
E29 0360  1       Without comparing the relative merits of the two
E29 0360  9    courses- architecture versus interior design- let us
E29 0370  6    examine the educational needs of the interior designer.
E29 0380  5       To begin with, what is an interior designer? "The
E29 0390  3    Dictionary of Occupational Titles" published by the
E29 0400  3    U& S& Department of Labor describes him as follows:
E29 0400 12    "Designs, plans and furnishes interiors of houses,
E29 0410  7    commercial and institutional structures, hotels, clubs,
E29 0420  4    ships, theaters, as well as set decorations for motion
E29 0430  4    picture arts and television. Makes drawings and plans
E29 0440  2    of rooms showing placement of furniture, floor coverings,
E29 0440 10    wall decorations, and determines color schemes.
E29 0450  6       Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval.
E29 0460  6    Makes necessary purchases, places contracts, supervises
E29 0470  3    construction, installation, finishing and placement
E29 0480  1    of furniture, fixtures and other correlated furnishings,
E29 0480  8    and follows through to completion of project".
E29 0490  6       In addition to this the U& S& Civil Service Bureau,
E29 0500  7    when examining applicants for government positions
E29 0510  3    as interior designers, expects that "when various needed
E29 0520  2    objects are not obtainable on the market he will design
E29 0520 12    them. He must be capable of designing for and supervising
E29 0530 10    the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the
E29 0540  8    furnishings".
E29 0540  9       This seems like a large order. The interior designer,
E29 0550  9    then, must first be an artist but also understand carpentry
E29 0560  7    and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance.
E29 0570  4    Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this
E29 0580  1    and any reputable interior designer does know all this
E29 0580 10    and does practice it. And further he must understand
E29 0590  7    his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical
E29 0600  7    necessities but also to enhance and improve his life
E29 0610  3    and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.
E29 0620  1       Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or
E29 0620 11    with the wording of their curriculum. It is in the
E29 0630  8    quality of the teaching of all this that a question
E29 0640  4    may arise.
E29 0640  6       The old established independent art schools try
E29 0650  3    their best to fulfill their obligations. Yet even here
E29 0660  1    many a problem is presented; as in a recent design
E29 0660 11    competition with a floor plan and the simple command-
E29 0670  8    "design a luxury apartment"; no description of the
E29 0680  5    client or his cultural level, no assertion of geographical
E29 0690  2    area or local social necessities- simply "a luxury
E29 0700  1    apartment". Working in a vacuum of minimal information
E29 0700  9    can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions
E29 0710  9    and catalogs and may please the public relations department
E29 0720  6    but have little to do with the essence of interior
E29 0730  4    design.
E29 0730  5       It is possible, of course, to work on extant or
E29 0740  4    projected buildings where either architect or owner
E29 0740 11    will explain their necessities so that the student
E29 0750  8    may get "the feel" of real interior design demands.
E29 0760  6    Unfortunately, the purely synthetic problem is the
E29 0770  4    rule.
E29 0770  5       It is like medical schools in India where, in that
E29 0780  3    fairy-land of religious inhibition, the dissection
E29 0780 10    of dead bodies is frowned upon. Instead they learn
E29 0790  8    their dissection on the bulbs of plants. Thus technical
E29 0800  5    efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience.
E29 0810  4       In the earlier years of training certain phases
E29 0820  2    of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem
E29 0820 12    has its use. But to continue to divorce advanced students
E29 0830  9    from reality is inexcusable.
E29 0840  1       Consultation with architects, clients, real estate
E29 0840  7    men, fabric houses and furniture companies is essential
E29 0850  8    to the proper development of class problems just as
E29 0860  6    in actual work. Fortunately, although only a few years
E29 0870  5    ago they held the student at arms length, today the
E29 0880  2    business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the
E29 0880 10    student, not only from an increased sense of community
E29 0890  7    responsibility but also from the realization that the
E29 0900  5    student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow-
E29 0910  1    that the student already is "in the trade".
E29 0910  9       Even the "history of furniture" can hardly be taught
E29 0920  9    exclusively from photographs and lantern slides. Here,
E29 0930  6    too, the reality of actual furniture must be experienced.
E29 0940  4       The professional organizations such as American
E29 0950  3    Institute of Interior Designers, National Society of
E29 0960  2    Interior Designers, Home Fashions League and various
E29 0960  9    trade associations, can and do aid greatly in this
E29 0970  8    work. Certainly every educator involved in interior
E29 0980  4    design should be a member and active in thework of
E29 0990  2    one of these organizations.
E29 0990  6       Not only should every educator above the rank of
E29 1000  5    instructor be expected to be a member of one of the
E29 1010  2    professional organizations, but his first qualification
E29 1010  8    for membership as an educator should be so sharply
E29 1015  8    scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to
E29 1020  5    certification to teach the subject.
E29 1030  1       Participation for the educator in this case, however,
E29 1030  9    would have to be raised to full and complete membership.
E29 1040  8    The largest of these organizations at present denies
E29 1050  4    to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and
E29 1060  3    standards of the group and, indeed, refuses him even
E29 1060 12    the right to attach the customary initials after his
E29 1070  9    name in the college catalog.
E29 1080  1       This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail
E29 1080  9    to lower his standing in the eyes of the students.
E29 1090  9    The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence
E29 1100  6    in his classes of an organization in the policies and
E29 1110  4    standards of which he has no voice.
E29 1110 11       This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute
E29 1120  7    educational qualifications for membership which the
E29 1130  5    organizations profess are ever enforced, the educator
E29 1140  2    will have the molding of the entire profession in his
E29 1140 12    hands.
E29 1150  1       In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice
E29 1150 11    to the schools. That is in the continuance of the "grandfather
E29 1160 11    clauses" in their membership requirements.
E29 1170  5       When these groups were first formed many prominent
E29 1180  5    and accomplished decorators could not have had the
E29 1190  3    advantage of school training since interior design
E29 1190 10    courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth.
E29 1210  5    Long hard years of "on the job" training had brought
E29 1220  5    them to their competence.
E29 1220  9       The necessity of that day has long disappeared.
E29 1230  7    There is plenty of opportunity for proper education
E29 1240  4    today. It is discouraging for students to realize that
E29 1250  2    the societies do not truly uphold the standards for
E29 1250 11    which they are supposed to stand.
E29 1260  5       The reason and the day of "grandfather clauses"
E29 1270  2    has long since passed. No one can deny that these "back
E29 1280  1    door" admissions to membership provisions have been
E29 1280  8    seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in
E29 1290  8    the admission of downright incompetents to membership
E29 1300  3    in supposedly learned societies.
E29 1300  7       Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to
E29 1310  8    subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves.
E29 1320  5    It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have
E29 1330  3    adequate education, a depth and breadth of knowledge
E29 1330 11    far beyond the immediate necessities of his course
E29 1340  8    plus complete dedication to his subject and to his
E29 1350  7    students. The local decorator who rushes in for a few
E29 1360  5    hours of teaching may but more likely may not have
E29 1360 15    these qualifications.
E29 1370  2       Nor will the hack, the Jack-of-all-trades, still
E29 1380  1    found in some of the smaller art schools, suffice.
E29 1380 10       Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated
E29 1390  9    a request for a teacher of interior design. At the
E29 1400  6    end of its letter was the information that applicants
E29 1410  3    for this position "must also be prepared to teach costume
E29 1420  1    design and advertising art". This kind of irresponsibility
E29 1420  9    toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional
E29 1430  9    attitude in the future designer.
E29 1440  5       We must build a corp of highly professional teachers
E29 1450  2    of interior design who have had education, experience
E29 1460  1    in the profession and are willing to take on the usual
E29 1460 12    accompaniments of teaching- minimal income and minimal
E29 1470  7    status among their confreres.
E29 1480  1       Considerable specialization in teaching subjects
E29 1480  6    such as architecture, furniture design, textiles and
E29 1490  5    color is also desirable.
E29 1500  1       In all "degree" courses in interior design a number
E29 1500 10    of "academic" or "general studies" courses are included.
E29 1510  7    It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses
E29 1520  7    in English, history, psychology and so on be as well
E29 1530  7    informed in matters of art, especially interior design,
E29 1540  2    as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects.
E29 1540 12    The proper correlation of the art with the academic
E29 1550  9    can be achieved only if this standard is observed.
E29 1560  6    The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for
E29 1570  3    art objectives also must be taken into account.
E29 1580  1       One technical question of school organization comes
E29 1580  7    to mind here. For proper accreditation of schools,
E29 1590  5    teachers in any course must have a degree at least
E29 1600  5    one level above that for which the student is a candidate.
E29 1610  1    Since there are almost no schools in the country offering
E29 1610 11    graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at
E29 1620  9    present be observed. Indeed, it has only been a matter
E29 1630  8    of the last few years that reputable schools of art
E29 1640  4    have granted degrees at all. The question, however,
E29 1650  1    cannot be ignored for long. The basic problem involved
E29 1650 10    is that a college setting up a graduate school must
E29 1660  7    have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced
E29 1670  4    degree. Most professors in the course must, naturally,
E29 1680  1    again have a higher degree than the course offers.
E29 1680 10    One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education
E29 1690  8    but it is a poor substitute. It is a sort of academic
E29 1700  7    ring-around-a rosy and you solve it.
E29 1710  1       This brings us to the question of accreditation
E29 1710  8    of art schools in general. Only the independent art
E29 1720  5    schools, that is, those not connected with any university
E29 1730  4    or college, receive severe and separate investigation
E29 1740  1    before accreditation by the various regional organizations.
E29 1740  8    It has been the custom for most universities to stretch
E29 1750  9    the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts
E29 1760  5    school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts
E29 1770  4    department. This, plus the habit of many schools of
E29 1780  1    simply adding interior design to the many subjects
E29 1780  9    of their home economics department, yet, nevertheless,
E29 1790  4    claiming that they teach interior design, has contributed
E29 1800  4    to the low repute of many university courses in interior
E29 1810  3    design. In spite of this, many universities offer adequate
E29 1820  1    and even distinguished courses in the subject.
E29 1820  8       There will be no mitigation of these offences until
E29 1830  7    all art schools, whether independent or attached to
E29 1840  4    universities have separate accreditation- as do medical
E29 1850  2    schools- by an art accreditation group such as the
E29 1850 11    "National Association of Schools of Art".
E29 1860  6       Independent art schools granting degrees must, naturally,
E29 1870  5    follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate
E29 1880  4    regional group.
E30 0010  1    #GENERAL#
E30 0010  2    How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives
E30 0020  1    of your benefit and service program? Have you permitted
E30 0020 10    it to become a giveaway program rather than one that
E30 0030  8    has the goal of improved employee morale and, consequently,
E30 0040  4    increased productivity?
E30 0040  6       What effort do you make to assess results of your
E30 0050 10    program? Do you measure its relation to reduced absenteeism,
E30 0060  6    turnover, accidents, and grievances, and to improved
E30 0070  4    quality and output?
E30 0070  7       Have you set specific objectives for your employee
E30 0080  5    publication? Is it reaching these goals? Is it larger
E30 0090  5    or fancier than you really need? Are you using the
E30 0100  2    most economical printing methods, paper, etc&. Are
E30 0100  9    there other, cheaper communications techniques that
E30 0110  5    could be substituted?
E30 0120  1       Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged
E30 0120  8    an excess of free "government" work in your plant?
E30 0130  8       Is your purchasing agent offering too much free-buying
E30 0140  7    service for employees?
E30 0150  1       When improvements are recommended in working conditions-
E30 0150  8    such as lighting, rest rooms, eating facilities,
E30 0160  6    air-conditioning-
E30 0160  8    do you try to set a measure of their effectiveness
E30 0170  8    on productivity?
E30 0170 10       When negotiating with your union, do you make sure
E30 0180  9    employees have a choice between new benefits and their
E30 0190  6    cents-per-hour cost in wages.
E30 0200  1       Can you consider restricting any additional employee
E30 0200  8    benefits to those paid for by profit-sharing money,
E30 0210  7    such as was done in the union contract recently signed
E30 0220  3    by American Motors Corporation?
E30 0220  7    #INSURANCE#
E30 0230  1    Do your employees understand all the benefits to which
E30 0230 10    your insurance entitles them? Are they encouraged to
E30 0240  7    take full legal advantage of these benefits? Have you
E30 0250  6    publicized the cents-per-hour value of the company's
E30 0260  4    share of insurance premiums?
E30 0260  8       When did you last compare your present premium costs
E30 0270  7    with the costs of insurance from other sources?
E30 0280  4       Can your insurance company aid you in reducing administrative
E30 0290  2    costs?
E30 0290  3       Do you try to maintain the principle of employee-contributed
E30 0300  4    (as opposed to fully company-paid) programs?
E30 0310  1    #HOLIDAYS, TIME OFF, OVERTIME#
E30 0310  5    Do you protect your holiday privileges with an attendance
E30 0320  5    requirement both before and after the holiday?
E30 0330  1       Do you plan to limit additional holidays to area
E30 0330 10    and/or industrial patterns?
E30 0340  3       Have you investigated the possibility of moving
E30 0350  3    midweek holidays forward to Monday or back to Friday
E30 0350 12    in order to have an uninterrupted work week?
E30 0360  8       Are you carefully policing wash-up time and rest
E30 0370  7    periods to be certain that all other time is productive?
E30 0380  3       Are you watching work schedules for boiler operators,
E30 0390  2    guards, and other 24-hour-day, 7-day-week operations
E30 0390 12    in order to minimize overtime?
E30 0400  4       Are you careful to restrict the number of people
E30 0410  3    on leave at one time so that your total employment
E30 0410 13    obligation is minimized?
E30 0420  3    #PLANT FEEDING FACILITIES#
E30 0420  6    Have you considered using vending equipment to replace
E30 0430  6    or reduce the number of cafeteria employees?
E30 0440  2       What are the possibilities for operating your cafeteria
E30 0450  2    for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines
E30 0460  1    or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift
E30 0460 11    operations?
E30 0470  1       Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your
E30 0470  9    cafeteria operation in order to save administrative
E30 0480  7    costs?
E30 0480  8       Are there possibilities of having cafeteria help
E30 0490  6    work part-time on custodial or other jobs?
E30 0500  3       Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity
E30 0510  1    strain on your feeding facilities?
E30 0510  6       Would it be feasible to limit the menu in order
E30 0520  6    to reduce feeding costs?
E30 0520 10       Have you considered gradual withdrawal of subsidies
E30 0530  5    to your in-plant feeding operation?
E30 0540  1       Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings
E30 0550  1    or discussions?
E30 0550  3    #RECREATION FACILITIES#
E30 0550  5    Are your expenses in this area commensurate with the
E30 0560  6    number of employees who benefit from your program?
E30 0570  3       Have you audited your program recently to weed out
E30 0580  2    those phases that draw least participation?
E30 0580  8       Do employees contribute their share of money to
E30 0590  7    recreational facilities?
E30 0600  1       Have you considered delegating operational responsibility
E30 0600  6    to your employee association and carefully restricting
E30 0610  5    your plant's financial contribution?
E30 0620  2       Could an employee's garden club take over partial
E30 0630  1    care of plant grounds? Would a camera club be useful
E30 0630 11    in taking pictures pertinent to plant safety?
E30 0640  6       Are you spending too much money on team uniforms
E30 0650  5    that benefit only a few employees? Are you underwriting
E30 0660  2    expensive team trips?
E30 0660  5       Are you utilizing vending machine proceeds to help
E30 0670  5    pay for your program?
E30 0670  9    #TRANSPORTATION AND PARKING#
E30 0680  3    Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access
E30 0690  1    roads and parking lots?
E30 0690  5       If you use parking attendants, can they be replaced
E30 0700  4    by automatic parking gates?
E30 0700  8       Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain
E30 0710  6    the bus stops at your plant?
E30 0720  1       If you provide inter-plant transportation, can this
E30 0720  9    be replaced by available public transportation? If
E30 0730  6    you use company transportation to meet trains or to
E30 0740  6    haul visitors, would taxis be cheaper?
E30 0750  1       How efficient and necessary are your intra-company
E30 0750  9    vehicles? Can they be re-scheduled? Can part-time drivers
E30 0760  9    be assigned to other productive work?
E30 0770  3    #PAID VACATIONS#
E30 0770  5    Which is more economical for your plant- a vacation
E30 0780  5    shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra employees
E30 0790  2    for vacation fill-ins?
E30 0790  6       Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months
E30 0800  5    to minimize the number of employee fill-ins?
E30 0810  1       Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take
E30 0810  9    their vacations during plant shutdowns?
E30 0820  4       What can your sales and purchasing departments do
E30 0830  3    to curtail orders, shipments, and receipts during vacation
E30 0840  1    shutdown periods?
E30 0840  3    #RETIREMENT#
E30 0840  4    Is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually costing
E30 0850  6    your plant money?
E30 0850  9       What sort of effort do you make to assure that older
E30 0860  9    or disabled workers are fully productive? Would early
E30 0870  4    retirement of non-productive, disabled employees reduce
E30 0880  2    the number of make-work jobs?
E30 0880  8       Will your union accept seniority concessions in
E30 0890  5    assigning work for older or disabled employees?
E30 0900  1    #MEDICAL AND HEALTH#
E30 0900  4    Can you share medical facilities and staff with neighboring
E30 0910  5    plants?
E30 0910  6       If you have a full-time doctor now, can he be replaced
E30 0920  7    with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee-per-case
E30 0930  6    basis only?
E30 0930  8       Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid
E30 0940  6    man who works full-time on some other assignment?
E30 0950  1       Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected
E30 0960  1    health problems and avoid treating the latter?
E30 0960  8       Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical
E30 0970  6    services- flu shots, sun lamp treatments, etc&?
E30 0980  5       If you have an annual or regular physical examination
E30 0990  3    program, is it worth what it is costing you?
E30 1000  1    #A PROGRAM TO FIT YOUR NEEDS#
E30 1000  7    Consider what you can afford to spend and what your
E30 1010  6    goals are before setting up or revamping your employee
E30 1020  1    benefit program. Too many plant officials are all too
E30 1020 10    eager to buy a package program from an insurance company
E30 1030  9    simply because it works for another plant.
E30 1040  4       But even if that other plant employs the same number
E30 1050  3    of workers and makes the same product, there are other
E30 1050 13    facts to consider. How old is your working force? What's
E30 1060 10    your profit margin? In what section of the country
E30 1070  8    are you located? Are you in a rural or urban area?
E30 1080  8    These factors can make the difference between waste
E30 1090  3    and efficiency in any benefit program.
E30 1090  9       Above all, don't set up extravagant fringe benefits
E30 1100  7    just to buy employee good will. Unions stress fringe
E30 1110  5    benefits, but the individual hourly worker prefers
E30 1120  2    cash every time.
E30 1120  5       Aim to balance your employee benefit package. Some
E30 1130  3    plants go overboard on one type of fringe- say a liberal
E30 1140  1    retirement plan- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere.
E30 1140  8    They're asking for union trouble.
E30 1150  5    #COMMUNICATIONS#
E30 1150  6    If you want credit for your employee services program,
E30 1160  6    let your workers know what they're entitled to. Encourage
E30 1170  4    them to exercise their benefits. This can be done by
E30 1180  5    stories in your house organs, posters, special publications,
E30 1185  2    letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth
E30 1190  5    through your chain of command.
E30 1190 10       Some companies find a little imagination helpful.
E30 1200  6    Hallmark Cards, Inc&, Kansas City, Mo&, has a do-it-yourself
E30 1210  8    quiz game called "Benefit Bafflers", which it distributes
E30 1220  4    to employees. ~M + ~R Dietetic Laboratories, Inc&,
E30 1230  2    Columbus, gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook-
E30 1240  3    each check showing the amount the company spends on
E30 1240 12    a particular fringe. U& S& Rubber Company, New York,
E30 1250  8    passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits.
E30 1260  6    The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package,
E30 1270  4    for example, costs $227.72.
E30 1270  8    #INSURANCE#
E30 1270  9    Have the insurance company or your own accounting department
E30 1280  9    break down the cost of your insurance package periodically.
E30 1290  8    You may find certain coverage costing much more than
E30 1300  6    is economically feasible, thereby alerting you to desirable
E30 1310  4    revisions.
E30 1310  5       Check to see if some of your benefits- such as on-the-job
E30 1320  6    disability pay- can be put on a direct payment rather
E30 1330  3    than an insured basis at a savings to you.
E30 1340  1       Use deductable insurance wherever feasible. It can
E30 1340  8    put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with
E30 1350  6    your insurance rates. Also, beware of open-end policies,
E30 1360  5    especially in the medical field. This will mean that
E30 1370  2    every time there's an increase in hospital rates your
E30 1370 11    cost will go up in like manner. Put a dollar-and-cents
E30 1380 11    limit on benefits.
E30 1390  1       Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits
E30 1390  9    only upon death. Generally, your employee will greatly
E30 1400  6    appreciate benefits that protect him during his working
E30 1410  6    life or during retirement.
E30 1410 10    #SPECIAL TIME OFF#
E30 1420  2    In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum
E30 1420  9    time off and list what the worker's relation to the
E30 1430  9    deceased must be to qualify. Thus, you avoid headaches
E30 1440  5    when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's
E30 1450  2    funeral. Also, reserve the right to demand proof of
E30 1460  1    death despite the fact that you'll probably never use
E30 1460 10    it.
E30 1460 11       Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated.
E30 1470 10    Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the
E30 1480  8    cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of
E30 1490  3    production time. If coffee is sold at the cafeteria,
E30 1500  1    let a few workers in each department get it for the
E30 1500 12    whole group. Consider installing supplemental serving
E30 1510  4    lines in production areas. Make sure milk for the coffee
E30 1520  6    is placed in dispensers rather than in containers,
E30 1530  1    if you are supplying the coffee. Otherwise, you may
E30 1530 10    be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers.
E30 1540 10    #RETIREMENT POLICIES#
E30 1550  1    Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen
E30 1550  9    such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job
E30 1560 10    for the convenience of the company. And so deadheads
E30 1570  4    on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible
E30 1580  2    age. Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job
E30 1580 14    requirements tied into your pension plan. Younger men
E30 1590  8    usually don't think of pensions as an important job
E30 1600  7    benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change
E30 1610  4    jobs several times before settling down.
E30 1610 10       Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory
E30 1620  7    pension plans. There are two sides of a coin for this
E30 1630 10    decision. Workers usually think more of a plan they
E30 1640  6    contribute to. And they can at least collect the money
E30 1650  3    they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company.
E30 1650 13    A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the
E30 1660 10    worker until he retires. Thus, there is an added incentive
E30 1670  8    to stay on the job.
E30 1670 13    #HOLIDAYS#
E30 1680  1    Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when
E30 1680 11    an employee would not otherwise be working. These include:
E30 1690  8    leaves of absences, illnesses, and layoffs.
E30 1700  4       Consider adopting a system of holidays in which
E30 1710  3    time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience
E30 1720  1    to the operation of the plant. It's usually not too
E30 1720 11    hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer
E30 1730  9    holiday periods. For example, the Friday after Thanksgiving
E30 1740  5    can be substituted for Washington's birthday. This
E30 1750  3    reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and
E30 1760  1    startups.
E30 1760  2       Require each employee to work his last shift both
E30 1770  1    before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay.
E30 1770 11    This cuts the absentee rate.
E30 1780  2    #EATING FACILITIES#
E30 1780  4    Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized
E30 1790  4    cafeterias. Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable
E30 1800  1    prices, and at a profit to you. If a concessionaire
E30 1800 11    runs the cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and
E30 1810  9    price. If the soup tastes like dishwater, your employees
E30 1820  5    won't blame the concessionaire. You'll take the rap.
E30 1830  4       Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's
E30 1840  2    convenient for most employees. You may save valuable
E30 1840 10    production minutes with a change.
E30 1850  5    #VACATIONS#
E30 1850  6    Spread your vacation period over the widest possible
E30 1860  5    span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks.
E30 1870  2    This will cut the expense of vacation replacements.
E30 1870 10    And with the shutdown method there will be no argument
E30 1880  9    as to who gets the choice vacation dates.
E30 1890  3       Also make sure you have reasonable requirements
E30 1900  1    as to hours worked before a production employee is
E30 1900 10    entitled to a vacation. You might try providing standard
E30 1910  7    vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend
E30 1920  5    on the number of hours worked in the previous year.
E31 0010  1    THE LONG and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is
E31 0010 10    now moving into a new era. Modern times have changed
E31 0020  8    the world beyond recognition. The early years of the
E31 0030  6    twentieth century seem very far away. But with all
E31 0040  2    the changes in philosophy, dress and terrain- a few
E31 0040 11    things remain constant, including the devotion of Americans
E31 0050  7    to the great field sports, hunting and fishing.
E31 0060  5       As the generations move on, clothes become more
E31 0070  3    suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports. Sporting
E31 0080  1    firearms change, markedly for the better. Just as modern
E31 0080 10    transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered
E31 0090  7    wagon, the demand of today's sportsmen and women has
E31 0100  6    necessitated changes in their equipment.
E31 0110  1       The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers
E31 0110  7    through diligent research and technical development
E31 0120  6    have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot
E31 0130  7    arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders, extremely
E31 0140  2    accurate bolt, lever, and slide action firearms. And
E31 0150  1    millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms
E31 0150 11    ammunition, designed for today's hunting and target
E31 0160  7    shooting.
E31 0160  8       And due to modern resource-use and game management
E31 0170  8    practices, there is still game to shoot, even with
E31 0180  6    the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water.
E31 0190  2    Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not
E31 0190  8    as an expendable natural resource, but as an annual
E31 0200  7    harvest to be sown and also reaped. Unlimited game
E31 0210  4    bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states,
E31 0220  1    on shooting preserves (one of the newer phases of modern
E31 0220 11    game-management) for five and six months each year.
E31 0230  8       Close to two million game birds were harvested on
E31 0240  6    1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves, and
E31 0250  3    on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas
E31 0260  1    during the 1960-61 season. The shooting development
E31 0260  9    program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers'
E31 0270  6    Institute has successfully published these facts in
E31 0280  5    all major outdoor magazines, many national weeklies
E31 0290  2    and the trade papers.
E31 0290  6       The most effective way to develop more places for
E31 0300  5    more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed
E31 0310  2    shooting preserves. This has been the aim of the director
E31 0320  1    of the shooting development program, the New York staff
E31 0320 10    of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau, and the ~SAAMI shooting
E31 0330  7    preserve field consultants since the start of the program
E31 0340  9    in 1954.
E31 0340 11       Following the kick-off of ~SAAMI's shooting development
E31 0350  8    program in 1954, a most interesting meeting took place
E31 0360  9    in Washington, D& C&. The group known as the American
E31 0370  7    Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation
E31 0380  4    (a division of the National Education Association)
E31 0390  2    initiated a conference which brought together representatives
E31 0400  1    of the National Rifle Association, ~SAAMI and the American
E31 0410  1    Fishing Tackle Manufacturers. This meeting was called
E31 0410  8    to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch
E31 0420  9    what is known as the Outdoor Education Project.
E31 0430  5       The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of
E31 0440  4    the fact, so often overlooked, that athletic activities
E31 0450  2    stressed in most school programs have little or no
E31 0450 11    relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests
E31 0460  9    of later life. The various team sports assuredly have
E31 0470  6    their place in every school, and they are important
E31 0480  4    to proper physical development. But with the exception
E31 0490  1    of professional athletes, few contact sports and physical
E31 0490  9    education activities in our schools have any carryover
E31 0500  8    in the adult life of the average American man or woman.
E31 0510  7       Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation
E31 0520  3    and leadership development by ~OEP director Dr& Julian
E31 0530  3    Smith, today thousands of secondary schools, colleges
E31 0540  1    and universities have shooting and hunting education
E31 0540  8    in their physical education and recreation programs.
E31 0550  5    ~SAAMI's financial support since 1955 has contributed
E31 0560  5    to the success of this project in education. Personnel
E31 0570  2    assigned through the shooting development program have
E31 0580  1    proudly participated in over 53 state and regional
E31 0580  9    workshops, at which hundreds of school administrators,
E31 0590  5    teachers, professors, and recreational leaders have
E31 0600  3    been introduced to Outdoor Education. Considering that
E31 0610  2    the current school-age potential is 23 million youths,
E31 0610 11    the project and its message on hunting and shooting
E31 0620  8    education have many more to reach.
E31 0630  3       In 1959 ~SAAMI's shooting development program announced
E31 0640  2    a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age
E31 0640 12    boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the
E31 0650 10    participation in the shooting sports. This program
E31 0660  6    is now nationally known as "Teen Hunter Clubs".
E31 0670  3       Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated
E31 0680  3    members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation. The
E31 0690  2    first program was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss, Hempstead,
E31 0690 11    New York, under the direction of Special Events director
E31 0700  9    Jennings Dennis. Other pilot programs were conducted
E31 0710  7    by ~A + ~S, Babylon, New York; J& L& Hudson, Detroit;
E31 0720  7    Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.
E31 0730  1       Other ~THC activities followed, conducted by shopping
E31 0740  1    centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers,
E31 0740  7    radio-~TV stations, newspapers, and other organizations
E31 0750  6    interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters
E31 0760  6    with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development
E31 0770  5    of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting
E31 0780  4    and wise use of our natural resources. ~SAAMI's field
E31 0790  2    men have served as consultants and/or have participated
E31 0790 10    in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached
E31 0800  9    over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans.
E31 0810  3       Through the efforts of ~SAAMI's shooting development
E31 0820  3    program these shooting activities, and many others,
E31 0830  2    including assists in the development of public and
E31 0830 10    privately financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues,
E31 0840  8    rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted,
E31 0850  5    to mention only a few.
E31 0860  1       The continuation and expansion of the shooting development
E31 0860  8    program will assure to some degree that national and
E31 0870  8    community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing
E31 0880  6    need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting
E31 0890  3    and shooting in answer to public demand. While individual
E31 0900  1    sportsmen are aware of this situation, too many of
E31 0900 10    our political, social, educational and even religious
E31 0910  6    leaders too often forget it. Help is needed from dealers,
E31 0920  5    at the grass-roots level.
E31 0920 10       The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor
E31 0930  6    a successful promotional program through their industry
E31 0940  4    trade association. Since ~SAAMI's conception in 1926,
E31 0950  4    and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting
E31 0960  2    Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and
E31 0960 10    promotional man-hours have gone into the development
E31 0970  8    of more places to shoot for more youths and adults.
E31 0980  6    We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition dealer,
E31 0990  2    have benefited through additional sales of equipment.
E31 1000  1       Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports?
E31 1000 10    Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions
E31 1010  8    of American boys and girls, who will grow up to enjoy
E31 1020  8    a traditional American way of life- ranging the fields
E31 1030  6    with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition?
E31 1035  2       Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department
E31 1050  1    primed for the expanding horizons?
E31 1050  6       Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting
E31 1060  6    programs, and have information on seasons including
E31 1070  4    six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting
E31 1080  3    preserves? Ask Sammy Shooter. WE WERE CAMPING a few
E31 1090  6    weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land
E31 1100  3    of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's
E31 1110  1    famed Outer Banks. This beach campground with no trees
E31 1110 10    or hills presents a constant camping show with all
E31 1120  7    manner of equipment in actual use.
E31 1130  2       With the whole camp exposed to view we could see
E31 1130 12    the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are
E31 1140  8    camping now. There were umbrella tents, wall tents,
E31 1150  5    cottage tents, station wagon tents, pup tents, Pop
E31 1160  3    tents, Baker tents, tents with exterior frames, camper
E31 1160 11    trailers, travel trailers, and even a few surplus parachutes
E31 1170  9    serving as sunshades over entire family camps.
E31 1180  6       Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves,
E31 1190  6    lanterns, coolers, bedding, games, fishing tackle,
E31 1200  1    windbreaks and sunshades. We saw similar displays in
E31 1200  9    the other three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long National
E31 1210  9    Seashore Recreation Area. Dealers would do well to
E31 1220  7    visit such a campground often, look at the equipment
E31 1230  4    and talk with the campers. Here you begin to appreciate
E31 1240  1    the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing
E31 1240  9    the industry.
E31 1250  1       Camping is big and getting bigger. No one knows
E31 1250 10    where it will stop. Almost every official who reflects
E31 1260  7    on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings
E31 1270  6    opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets.
E31 1280  4    You read various guesses on how many Americans are
E31 1290  2    camping. The number depends on who is talking at the
E31 1290 12    moment. The figures range as high as 15 million families.
E31 1300  9    I've heard 10 million mentioned often, but I'm more
E31 1310  6    inclined to think there may be a total of some five
E31 1320  5    to seven million families camping. Seven million families
E31 1340  1    would total 30 million Americans or more. Consider
E31 1340  9    the equipment needed to protect this many from the
E31 1350  8    weather, to make their cooking easy and their sleeping
E31 1360  5    comfortable.
E31 1360  6    #MORE CAMPERS THAN CAMPSITES#
E31 1370  1    Harassed state park officials often have more campers
E31 1370  9    than they know what to do with. They are struggling
E31 1380  9    to meet the demand for camping space, but families
E31 1390  4    are being turned away, especially on holiday weekends.
E31 1400  2    The National Parks, always popular camping places,
E31 1400  9    are facing the same pressure. The National Park Service
E31 1410  8    hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for
E31 1420  6    100,000 campers a day- almost twice what there are
E31 1430  5    at present. The U& S& Forest Service cares for hundreds
E31 1440  3    of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests
E31 1450  1    and is increasing its facilities steadily.
E31 1450  7       But the campers still come. They bring their families
E31 1460  6    and tents and camp kitchens and bedding. They bring
E31 1470  3    their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits.
E31 1480  1    They come prepared for family fun because Americans
E31 1480  9    in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the
E31 1490  8    way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family
E31 1500  5    experience of lasting importance.
E31 1500  9    #WHY THEY KEEP COMING#
E31 1510  3    There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for
E31 1520  1    the migration to the campgrounds. Among them, according
E31 1520  9    to the U& S& Department of Commerce, are: (1) shorter
E31 1530  8    work weeks, (2) higher pay, (3) longer paid vacations,
E31 1540  7    (4) better transportation, (5) earlier retirement,
E31 1550  3    and (6) more education. The more people learn about
E31 1560  1    their country, the more they want to learn. Camping
E31 1560 10    is family fun, and it is helping more Americans see
E31 1570  8    more of the country than they ever saw before.
E31 1580  3       But make no mistake about it, the first reason people
E31 1590  2    turn to camping is one of economy. Here is the promise
E31 1590 13    of a vacation trip they can afford.
E31 1600  5       The American Automobile Association, computing the
E31 1610  3    cost for two people to vacation by automobile, comes
E31 1620  1    up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29.
E31 1620 10    The ~AAA then splits it down this way: $10.50 for meals,
E31 1630 10    $9.50 for lodging, $7 for gas and oil, and $2 for tips
E31 1640 10    and miscellaneous.
E31 1640 12       What does the camping couple do to this set of figures?
E31 1650 10    The $9.50 for lodging they save. Because they prepare
E31 1660  6    their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good
E31 1670  5    portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of
E31 1680  2    the tip money. The automobile expenses are about the
E31 1680 11    only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or
E31 1690  7    pare down drastically by camping along the way.
E31 1700  4       Where Americans used to think of a single vacation
E31 1710  2    each summer, they now think about how many vacations
E31 1710 11    they can have. Long weekends enable many to get away
E31 1720 10    from home for three or four days several times a year.
E31 1730  7    And even if they stay in resorts part of the time,
E31 1740  4    they might, if the right salesman gets them in tow,
E31 1740 14    develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare
E31 1750  9    with a camping trip into the wide open spaces.
E31 1760  6       It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of
E31 1770  3    beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts
E31 1780  1    of home. They're not. Home is the place to find the
E31 1780 12    comforts of home. They're buying fun and adventure
E31 1790  7    and family experiences. But it would also be a mistake
E31 1800  7    for them not to realize how comfortable camping has
E31 1810  3    become. This is no longer a way of life for the bearded
E31 1820  1    logger and the wandering cowboy. Today's campers want
E31 1820  9    comforts, and they have them. And this helps explain
E31 1830  8    why so many people are now going camping. It's fun,
E31 1840  4    and it's easy- so easy that there is time left after
E31 1850  3    cooking, and tent keeping, for the women to get out
E31 1850 13    and enjoy outdoor fun with their families.
E31 1860  7       Camp meals are no great problem. Neither are beds,
E31 1870  5    thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags. Neither
E31 1880  2    are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs
E31 1880 12    of every camper or prospective camper.
E31 1890  5       But there is still the sometimes complex problem
E31 1900  3    of helping campers choose the best equipment for their
E31 1910  2    individual needs.
E32 0010  1    @ Throughout history, the man who showed superior performance
E32 0010 10    has become the commander of others- for good or bad.
E32 0020  9    Since the Industrial Revolution, when factories emerged,
E32 0030  5    this classical pattern has been followed. Until recently.
E32 0040  4       There have always been tales of disillusionment-
E32 0050  3    the competent technician who became an administrator,
E32 0060  1    willingly or not, and found he didn't like it; the
E32 0060 11    scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper
E32 0070  8    work; and much more commonly in recent years, the engineer
E32 0080  7    who found that other duties interfered with- or eliminated-
E32 0090  3    his engineering contributions. There have been many
E32 0100  4    extremely competent men who have been converted into
E32 0110  1    very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work,
E32 0110  9    to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss.
E32 0120  6       This has been more evident since our products have
E32 0130  6    incorporated astronomically increased technology. The
E32 0140  3    remedies have been many and varied- attempts to teach
E32 0150  2    management techniques- either in plant, at special
E32 0150  9    schools, or in university "crash" courses- provision
E32 0170  6    of management-trained assistants or associates. But
E32 0180  4    the realization has been growing that these are not
E32 0190  4    the complete answer. Some men have no talent for or
E32 0200  1    interest in management; forcing them into management
E32 0200  8    can only create trouble. The old shop adage still holds:
E32 0210  8    "A good mechanic is usually a bad boss".
E32 0220  4       Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition
E32 0230  1    of managerial status as the gage of success. Labor
E32 0230 10    fights to change its collar from blue to white. All
E32 0240  9    grades of management seek more resounding titles and
E32 0250  5    incomes because of social pressures. As several recent
E32 0260  2    books have over-emphasized, we have become the most
E32 0260 11    status-conscious nation in the world.
E32 0270  5       What can be done for the "individual contributor"
E32 0280  4    who is extremely important- and likely to be more so-
E32 0290  6    in the operation of the technically oriented company?
E32 0300  2    He is usually conscious of the social pressures at
E32 0300 11    home and outside; usually concerned about America's
E32 0310  6    belief that attainment and success are measured in
E32 0320  6    dollars and titles. Yet titles are traditionally given
E32 0330  2    only to management men, and income tends to rise with
E32 0340  1    title.
E32 0340  2       Even the college professor in America has been affected.
E32 0350  1    It is, as one engineer says, "indeed a difficult thing
E32 0350 11    for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on
E32 0360 11    his technical merit as he could employing managerial
E32 0370  4    skills. This difficulty arises even though we can give
E32 0380  4    examples of men who have actually followed this course.
E32 0380 13    This leads one to conclude, as you have, that there
E32 0390 10    is inevitably more prestige in a management position
E32 0400  6    in the minds of our people".
E32 0410  1       Nobody should be more able to answer the questions
E32 0410 10    on this score than engineering vice-presidents and
E32 0420  5    chief engineers. So we asked such men in major companies
E32 0430  5    in the design field to offer their opinions on the
E32 0440  2    "dual-road-up" problem- and more importantly- their
E32 0440 10    solutions. In the paragraphs that follow, we quote
E32 0450  8    from 32 men who are identified on the final page.
E32 0460  5    #FIRST: WHAT TITLE, WHAT SETUP?#
E32 0460 10    Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement
E32 0470  9    is that of General Electric. This is not a mutually
E32 0480  8    exclusive plan; there is no one point in a man's career
E32 0490  9    at which he must select either the technical or the
E32 0500  4    managerial path upward. Further, the management path
E32 0510  1    does not open the door to higher opportunities than
E32 0510 10    are offered by the more technical path. It is common
E32 0520  8    to shift back and forth, working up through a number
E32 0530  5    of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.
E32 0540  1       Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor
E32 0550  1    positions in both operating departments and in the
E32 0550  9    company-wide "services" operation that are filled by
E32 0560  6    men with successful managerial experience who are currently
E32 0570  5    broadening their capabilities.
E32 0570  8       Also, moving into a managerial position does not
E32 0580  8    necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical
E32 0590  5    expert. As examples at ~GE: Glen B& Warren, formerly
E32 0600  4    manager of the Turbine Division, widely recognized
E32 0610  1    as a turbine designer. The late W& R& G& Baker, a pioneer
E32 0620  1    in television design and long-time ~vp + ~gm of the
E32 0620 12    Electronics Division, and later, by his own choice,
E32 0630  8    an individual consultant. Harold E& Strang, expert
E32 0640  5    in switchgear design, for a long period ~vp + ~gm of
E32 0650  5    the Measurements + Industrial Products Division, and
E32 0660  2    who currently, approaching retirement, is vice-president
E32 0660  9    and consulting engineer in the Switchgear + Control
E32 0670  7    Division.
E32 0670  8       In the ~GE plan, a number of individual contributors
E32 0680  9    have positions and compensation higher than those of
E32 0690  7    many managers. These positions carry such titles as:
E32 0700  5       Consultant- Advanced Development
E32 0710  1       Consulting Engineer
E32 0710  3       Consulting Engineer- Heat Transfer
E32 0720  1       Consulting Electrical Engineer
E32 0720  4       Senior Electrical Engineer
E32 0730  2       Senior Physicist
E32 0730  4       Westinghouse has a similar system, with two classifications
E32 0740  5    representing various levels of competence on the strictly
E32 0750  4    technical side: consulting engineer or scientist, as
E32 0760  2    the case may be, and advisory engineer or scientist.
E32 0760 11    Many companies have systems, particularly in ~R + ~D,
E32 0770  9    which work more or less well, depending upon size and
E32 0780  8    actual belief in the policy on the part of administration,
E32 0790  5    as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations.
E32 0800  2       Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel
E32 0810  1    recognition is, as one man says it: "**h that the fad
E32 0810 12    for educating top people along managerial lines is
E32 0820  7    yielding to the technically trained approach".
E32 0830  3    _SENIOR STAFF ENGINEER?_
E32 0830  6       One company instituted, early in 1959, a vertical
E32 0840  6    classification system consisting of four levels. There
E32 0850  3    is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;
E32 0860  1    the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer,
E32 00  9    enj+oys status and pay ranging up to that for the second
E32 0870 10    level of engineering supervision. The second level,
E32 0880  4    senior engineer, rates slightly below first-level supervision.
E32 0890  2    The expectation is that first-level supervisors will
E32 0900  1    be selected in approximately equal numbers from the
E32 0900  9    second and third engineering level, with very few coming
E32 0910  7    from the first level.
E32 0920  1       The company expects to extend upward both compensation
E32 0920  9    and status for non-supervisory engineers, but probably
E32 0930  6    not into executive levels. In this organization, about
E32 0940  5    half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment
E32 0950  4    are in supervision, engineering or elsewhere. This
E32 0960  1    reflects the very heavy engineering content of the
E32 0960  9    products- which are not military. Several other examples:
E32 0980  1    _CENTRAL AND SATELLITE_
E32 0980  1       "We have over 20 divisions- each of which has an
E32 0980 11    engineering department headed by a chief engineer.
E32 0990  7    We have set up a central ~R + ~D department, as well
E32 1000  6    as engineering-management departments- about 80 people
E32 1010  6    working on problems related to those of our plants.
E32 1020  1    A separate research department is, of course, confined
E32 1020  9    to new or future designs. Part of this headquarters
E32 1030  6    staff, however, are engineering managers who work between
E32 1040  5    divisional chief engineers and headquarters management.
E32 1050  2    These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president-
E32 1060  3    Engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers
E32 1060  9    and chief engineers on product problems as well as
E32 1070  8    aid with design; and many are engineers who have been
E32 1080  5    advanced from the divisions. These men are considered
E32 1090  2    managers of engineers. They must learn to wear several
E32 1090 11    hats, so to speak, working with management, sales and
E32 1100  9    engineering problems related to the product.
E32 1110  5       "We do not have people in our organization termed
E32 1120  2    'consultants' or 'fellows', who are specialists in
E32 1130  2    one particular technical subject. I suppose it is because
E32 1130 11    we are just not big enough. We have a few 'consultants'-
E32 1140 10    retired engineers retained and called in on certain
E32 1150  7    problems. The only 'fellows' in our company are those
E32 1160  6    who have been honored by ~ASME, ~AIEE or ~AIChE **h
E32 1170  4    I am sure that the engineer who enters management is
E32 1180  3    nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities
E32 1190  1    than he would have as a technical specialist- because
E32 1190 10    of his wider accountability".
E32 1200  1    _ANOTHER STRUCTURE_
E32 1200  3       "We have tried to make both paths attractive, so
E32 1210  4    that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction
E32 1220  1    in either. One way to formalize this is in the job
E32 1220 12    structure. We have these positions, which compare directly:
E32 1230  8    **f
E32 1230  9       "Above these jobs we have chief engineer for the
E32 1240  9    company and vice-president of ~Engrg, ~R + ~D. The
E32 1250  7    latter jobs include major management responsibilities
E32 1260  2    and have been filled by those who have come up primarily
E32 1270  1    through the engineering-management side **h We have
E32 1270  9    not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical
E32 1280  7    specialization comparable to our higher levels of management,
E32 1290  7    but I believe we will trend in this direction **h but
E32 1300  6    not to exceed vice-president".
E32 1310  1    _TOP JOB: RESEARCH SCIENTIST_
E32 1310  4       "Approximately four years ago, we initiated a dual
E32 1320  4    ladder of advancement for technical persons **h The
E32 1330  1    highest position is known as a 'research scientist'.
E32 1330  9    This approach has not been entirely satisfactory. The
E32 1340  7    primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical
E32 1350  5    people themselves, and their concept of what constitutes
E32 1360  2    status in present-day society. Scientists who agitate
E32 1370  1    hardest for technical recognition are often the most
E32 1380  8    reluctant to accept it **h We have discovered that
E32 1390  7    the outward trappings such as private offices and private
E32 1400  4    secretaries are extremely important; and although we
E32 1410  2    have attempted to provide these status symbols, support
E32 1410 10    of the 'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted **h
E32 1420  9    despite the creation of a salary potential for a research
E32 1430  8    scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial
E32 1440  6    positions.
E32 1440  7       "A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder
E32 1450  5    approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities
E32 1460  3    and standards of performance for each level. With no
E32 1470  3    set standards, there is the tendency to promote to
E32 1470 12    the next highest level when the top of a salary band
E32 1480 11    is reached regardless of performance **h promotion
E32 1490  5    is too often based on longevity and time in salary
E32 1500  4    grade instead of merit. If no specific organization
E32 1510  1    plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each
E32 1510 10    salary level, the result is a department top-heavy
E32 1520  8    with high-level, high-salaried personnel".
E32 1530  1    _STAFF ENGINEER @ DEPT MANAGER_
E32 1530  6       "We have two approaches for the technical man: the
E32 1540  6    position of staff engineer, which is rated as high
E32 1550  5    in salary as department manager; and an administrative
E32 1560  1    organization to take the routine load away from department
E32 1560 10    managers and project engineers as much as possible,
E32 1570  8    thus allowing them more time for strictly technical
E32 1580  4    work. These are only halfway measures, and the answer
E32 1590  3    will come when some way is found to allow the technical
E32 1590 14    man in industry **h to progress without limit in salary
E32 1600 10    and prestige".
E32 1610  1    _A COMPLETE PLAN_
E32 1610  4       "We have made limited application of the 'parallel
E32 1620  1    ladder' plan. The highest rated non-supervisory engineering
E32 1630  1    title is 'research engineer'. The salary schedule permits
E32 1630  9    remuneration greater than the average paid to the first
E32 1640  9    level of engineering supervision (engineering section
E32 1650  4    head). We also have an 'engineering section head- research
E32 1660  4    engineer' classification which has salary possibilities
E32 1670  2    equivalent to that of a research engineer. Above this
E32 1680  1    point there is no generally used parallel ladder.
E32 1680  9       "We also do a number of things to build up the prestige
E32 1690 11    of the engineer as a 'professional' and also to give
E32 1700  5    public recognition to individual technical competence.
E32 1710  2    These include encouragement of, and assistance to,
E32 1720  2    the engineer in preparation and publication of technical
E32 1720 10    papers. We have two media for publicizing individual
E32 1730  8    technical activity, a magazine widely distributed both
E32 1740  4    within and without the company, and an information
E32 1750  2    bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the
E32 1750  9    homes of all engineers. Publicity is given to the award
E32 1760 10    of patents to our egnineers and financial support is
E32 1770  7    provided for individual membership in technical societies.
E32 1780  4       "A recent, and more pertinent action, has been the
E32 1790  4    establishment of a technical staff reporting to the
E32 1800  1    vice-president for Engineering. This function is staffed
E32 1800  9    by engineers chosen for their technical competence
E32 1810  6    and who have the title, member of the technical staff'.
E32 1820  5    Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first
E32 1830  4    two or three levels of management. Additional symbols
E32 1840  1    of status are granted, such as reserved parking, distinctive
E32 1840 10    badge passes authorizing special privileges, and a
E32 1850  6    difference in the treatment of financial progress through
E32 1860  5    merit.
E32 1860  6       "We presently are involved in inaugurating a new
E32 1870  5    development center. Operations of this nature offer
E32 1880  2    the best opportunity to recognize scientific status.
E32 1880  9    All scientific staff members will have the title, 'research-staff
E32 1890  9    member'. The salary level of an individual within the
E32 1900  9    group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance
E32 1910  4    of him as an authority in his scientific field. Contrary
E32 1920  3    to usual organization-position evaluations, the position
E32 1930  3    to which research-staff members report administratively
E32 1930 10    will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff
E32 1940 10    member, therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as
E32 1950  7    highly.
E32 1950  8       "These recent steps do not offer the possibility
E32 1960  8    of extension to the great number of senior engineers
E32 1970  4    who have displayed technical competence. It is doubtful
E32 1980  3    that the complete solution to the over-all problem
E32 1980 12    can result entirely from company efforts. Fundamental
E32 1990  6    to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige
E32 2000  4    is the fact that, in the business community, prestige
E32 2010  2    and status are conferred in proportion to the authority
E32 2010 11    that one man has over others and the extent of which
E32 2020 11    he participates in the management functions".
E33 0010  1       SIXTY MILES NORTH of New York City where the wooded
E33 0010 11    hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the
E33 0020 10    Hudson River there is a new home development called
E33 0030  7    "Oakwood Heights". As a matter of fact you could probably
E33 0040  6    find a new home development in every populated county
E33 0050  2    in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages
E33 0060  1    in the $14,000 range. But Oakwood Heights is unique
E33 0060 10    in one particular **h its oil for heating is metered
E33 0070  8    monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central
E33 0080  6    storage point.
E33 0080  8       This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity
E33 0090  6    chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation,
E33 0100  3    with principal offices in New York State. Its president
E33 0110  3    is Otis M& Waters, partner in the law firm of Timen
E33 0120  1    + Waters, 5404 Chrysler Bldg&, New York City. Vice-president
E33 0130  1    is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark
E33 0130 10    Ritter. Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and
E33 0140  9    president of Kahler-Craft Distributors, Inc&, Newburgh,
E33 0150  4    N&Y&.
E33 0150  5       The idea of a central tank with lines to each house
E33 0160 10    is not in itself a novelty. Not a year goes by but
E33 0170  7    what several local companies in the U& S& and Canada,
E33 0180  3    even overseas, write to FUELOIL + OIL HEAT to inquire
E33 0190  1    if it's feasible and where it is being done. Its editors
E33 0190 12    only knew of one example to point to, a public housing
E33 0200 11    development of 278 homes in New Haven described by
E33 0210  7    John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue. This has survived
E33 0220  4    the years but there has been considerable concern among
E33 0230  2    the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered.
E33 0230 13    Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and
E33 0240  8    charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons
E33 0250  7    in the family.
E33 0250 10       Common complaints included "Mrs& Murphy" leaving
E33 0260  5    her windows open all the time, a fresh air fan, or
E33 0270  6    the family was visiting "Aunt Minnie" with the house
E33 0280  3    shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil.
E33 0280 14    As a result of that attitude, others have been discouraged
E33 0290  9    from trying central distribution.
E33 0300  2       A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks
E33 0310  1    the situation at Oakwood Heights. Called a "Slo-Flo"
E33 0310 10    meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries
E33 0320 11    of Los Angeles, a key individual being Don Nelson.
E33 0330  7    Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for
E33 0340  5    the northern, principal heating states.
E33 0350  1       There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State
E33 0350 11    headed by a lawyer. The earlier New Haven development
E33 0360  9    was public housing, so it easily leaped over the problems
E33 0370  8    met in a private venture. These have to do with property
E33 0380  6    rights, municipal official attitudes and a host of
E33 0390  4    others. In working out the practical legal conclusions
E33 0390 12    President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot
E33 0400  9    project, for it is planned to duplicate this program
E33 0410  6    or system in other builder developments nationally.
E33 0420  2       It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming,
E33 0430  1    to get approval of any kind of line under a public
E33 0430 12    street, as one example. To overcome this, the builder
E33 0440  7    lays and completes the street himself, then deeds it
E33 0450  5    to the community while retaining a perpetual easement
E33 0460  2    for the oil lines. When a family buys a home the title
E33 0460 14    is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State. For
E33 0470  9    the central storage, Tri-State buys one acre, Buries
E33 0480  7    its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that
E33 0490  4    piece. In other words, the whole storage and pipeline
E33 0500  1    system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the
E33 0500 11    town but rather to Tri-State.
E33 0510  4       How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan?
E33 0520  2    It leases the whole facility to a large oil company,
E33 0520 12    at least large enough to have a strong credit position.
E33 0530  9    This first test is being leased for ten years but future
E33 0540  8    projects will require at least 15 years. The amount
E33 0550  5    paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of
E33 0560  2    its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying
E33 0560 11    all the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally
E33 0570  9    must be profitable to both parties.
E33 0580  4       On this first venture the central storage is 20,000
E33 0590  2    gallons, in two tanks, or an average of 400 gallons
E33 0590 12    for each of the 50 homes. The supplier delivers at
E33 0600  8    his convenience in transport loads, so as to maintain
E33 0610  6    two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies.
E33 0620  2    However, that is not all he has to do. He must undertake
E33 0630  2    complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure
E33 0630 10    fine heating. In the present project the heating is
E33 0640  9    by circulating hot water form Paragon boiler-burner
E33 0650  5    units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups.
E33 0660  3    Again, the oil man must read the meters at such intervals
E33 0670  1    as he finds best.
E33 0670  5       For this first development the supplier signing
E33 0680  2    the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal
E33 0680 14    is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil
E33 0690  8    distributor. The major gets the assured gallonage for
E33 0700  6    the life of the lease and the distributor apparently
E33 0710  2    can do well because delivery cost is low.
E33 0710 10    #INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS#
E33 0720  2    The officers of the new corporation have naturally
E33 0730  1    explored many angles, as well as personalities that
E33 0730  9    might be affected. For example, the officials of Poughkeepsie
E33 0740  7    town (township) where the project is located think
E33 0750  5    highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing
E33 0760  2    problem. The central storage is near a main artery
E33 0760 11    quite easy to reach with large transports on a short
E33 0770 10    crescent swing, with fewer trucks in the residential
E33 0780  5    streets.
E33 0780  6       The Public Service Commission has ruled that this
E33 0790  5    is not a public utility, subject to their many regulations.
E33 0810  3       Several financial institutions, both banks and insurance
E33 0820  3    companies, have been sounded out. They like it and
E33 0820 12    would supply most of the capital because of the long
E33 0830 10    term leases by strong oil companies.
E33 0840  3       The Government housing agencies consider it feasible
E33 0850  2    with one special stipulation. There must be a restriction
E33 0850 11    in the deed to provide that the customer may not be
E33 0860 11    charged more than the current market price for the
E33 0870  6    oil **h an obvious precaution, since the account is
E33 0880  3    permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.
E33 0890  1       For a few details of the system **h the lines are
E33 0890 12    1-1/4'' X-Tru-Coat, a product of Republic Steel Corp&,
E33 0900 10    and all lines are welded. They are laid a minimum of
E33 0910  9    24'' deep and in some areas four feet down, particularly
E33 0920  6    under roads, to stay clear of all other piping such
E33 0930  4    as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy
E33 0940  1    trucking. The meter is mounted high on the basement
E33 0940 10    wall. Its figures are a half inch high and very easy
E33 0950  9    to read, even into tenth gallons. It will accommodate
E33 0960  4    firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.
E33 0970  1       Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total
E33 0970  9    cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution
E33 0980  7    system is no greater than would be gas heating systems
E33 0990  6    in the houses plus their lines and meters. He believes
E33 1000  3    that this is a sound approach to gas competition in
E33 1000 13    builder developments where gas is available.
E33 1010  6       It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State
E33 1020  7    system in old neighborhoods, and that's an understatement.
E33 1030  3    The job of getting property easements and street easements
E33 1040  2    and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging.
E33 1050  1    But in a new development where everything starts from
E33 1050 10    scratch the solutions are simple.
E33 1060  5    #FUTURE PLANS#
E33 1060  7    What does Tri-State actually want to do, now that it
E33 1070  7    has the meters under franchise and certain phases of
E33 1080  3    its piping system in the "patent applied for" stage?
E33 1090  1    It wants to interest builders and oil companies in
E33 1090 10    the idea of including its facility in their new home
E33 1100  7    projects, by financing and installing the storage,
E33 1110  3    piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years,
E33 1120  1    with renewal options, to a strong oil company. It may
E33 1120 11    also work in one other way- by licensing its system
E33 1130  7    patents and supplying the meters, letting the oil company
E33 1140  5    or even the builder install the facilities.
E33 1150  1       This whole development is certain to be of interest
E33 1150 10    to the readers, for the idea has so often been mentioned,
E33 1160  9    somewhat wistfully. But it's too early yet to go visit
E33 1170  9    Oakwood Heights. Only eight of the 50 houses were completed
E33 1180  6    at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th; others
E33 1190  4    were building. The big tanks were at the site but still
E33 1200  2    sunning themselves. A big mechanical ditcher was running
E33 1200 10    the trenches, and the town building inspector was paying
E33 1210  8    a friendly, if curious, visit.
E33 1220  2       The oilheating industry is looking up, led by a
E33 1220 11    revival of research and development. A primary ingredient
E33 1230  8    in these fields is imagination, and Tri-State Pipeline
E33 1240  7    Corporation deserves a very good mark.
E33 1260  1       EVERY YEAR about this time National Gargle Your
E33 1260  9    Cooling System week rolls around. It pays in the long
E33 1270 10    (hot) run to take good care of the water works. Do
E33 1280  7    it this way for the summer gargle:
E33 1290  1       @ First, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer.
E33 1290 11    Don't save the anti-freeze, even if it the expensive
E33 1300 10    "permanent" type. The word means it won't boil away
E33 1310  8    easily, nothing else. The rust inhibitors in the fluid
E33 1320  5    are used up after one year, and you don't want to risk
E33 1330  3    the rust that two years' use could mean. Pitch it out.
E33 1340  1       @ If a lot of rust shows in the drain, use a good
E33 1340 14    flushing cleaner.
E33 1350  1       @ Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor.
E33 1350 11    Of course, you'll want to use the softest water you
E33 1360 10    can in your radiators.
E33 1370  1       @ Now, check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections,
E33 1380  1    around the freeze-out plugs, gaskets, water pump seals
E33 1380 10    and heater fittings.
E33 1390  2       @ Next, run the engine and let it heat up so the
E33 1390 14    thermostat opens, and then look for leaks again. Be
E33 1400  9    sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator
E33 1410  8    fins. Use the air hose for this job. Check the temperature
E33 1420  4    gage and be sure it is working.
E33 1420 11       If you use one of the new year-round cooling system
E33 1430 10    fluids such as "Dowguard" be sure to check it. Dow
E33 1440  7    says that the fluid can be used now for two years.
E33 1450  4    Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it
E33 1450 11    in during the summer.
E33 1460  4       Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid those
E33 1470  2    unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature
E33 1470 10    zooms this summer.
E33 1480  3       Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out
E33 1490  2    of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs
E33 1490 10    of yours. Spring and summer may be here officially,
E33 1500  8    but those thermos stay in.
E33 1510  2       The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat
E33 1510 12    from any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase
E33 1520  8    the fuel consumption, reduce power and contribute to
E33 1530  6    spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive
E33 1540  3    carbon deposits on the insulators.
E33 1540  8       If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck,
E33 1550  9    check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat. The
E33 1560  5    thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating
E33 1570  3    temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its
E33 1570 12    most efficient temperature through the proper circulation
E33 1580  7    of the coolant.
E33 1590  1       Are you paying too much for your truck insurance?
E33 1590 10    There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage,
E33 1600 10    not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting
E33 1610  7    some corners that can be cut.
E33 1620  1       Have a talk with your insurance agent. Be careful
E33 1620 10    that you keep adequate coverage, but look for places
E33 1630  7    to save money. First go over the type of coverage you
E33 1640  5    now have. Look for these features which may mean you
E33 1650  2    can save:
E33 1650  4       @ Duplicate coverage. Avoid doubling up on the same
E33 1660  4    item. For example, don't pay in a truck policy for
E33 1660 14    medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health
E33 1670 11    and accident policy.
E33 1680  1       @ Does your policy have a lay-up clause? This means
E33 1680 12    that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than
E33 1690 11    30 days, insurance can be suspended and a proportionate
E33 1700  7    return of your premium made to you. This applies to
E33 1710  5    repair work or winter storage.
E33 1710 10       The figure five is important in insurance. With
E33 1720  7    many company policies you get a fleet discount if you
E33 1730  6    insure five or more rigs. This means either cars or
E33 1740  2    trucks. Discounts run up to 2% of cost.
E33 1740 10       Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying
E33 1750  7    deductibles to your liability plan. For example: If
E33 1760  5    your bodily injury claims start payment after the first
E33 1770  3    $250, a 25% premium saving is often made.
E34 0010  1    In the period since the end of World War /2,- a period
E34 0015  1    coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful,
E34 0020  7    the unusual, and the original in signs and displays-
E34 0030  5    plastics have come on so strong that today they are
E34 0050  3    the acknowledged leaders in the field. The importance
E34 0050 11    of the sign industry to the plastics industry, however,
E34 0060  8    is not in terms of volume alone. Designers of signs
E34 0070  6    and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the
E34 0080  4    adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings
E34 0090  1    of other industries. Many of today's developments in
E34 0090  9    thermoforming stem from original work done with signs
E34 0100  8    and displays; the art of preprinting in distortion
E34 0110  4    was similarly perfected by the sign makers; and the
E34 0130  3    reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for
E34 0130 10    escutcheons, medallions, etc&, owes much to the field,
E34 0140  8    as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting
E34 0150  7    properties of the transparent plastics.
E34 0160  2       There is much that many industries can continue
E34 0160 10    to learn from some of the more recent developments
E34 0170  9    described below. The concept of trans-illumination
E34 0180  5    (as shown by the photo on p& 92), as just one example,
E34 0190  3    offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems-
E34 0200  3    no matter what industry is involved.
E34 0200  9    #A VOLUME MARKET#
E34 0200 12    According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey, plastics
E34 0210  9    units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales.
E34 0220 10    Five years ago, they had only 10% of the market, with
E34 0230  7    the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of
E34 0240  3    neon tubing. And it's far from the end for plastics.
E34 0250  1    Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the
E34 0250 10    signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction.
E34 0260  8    Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent
E34 0270  9    activities of such leading companies in the field as
E34 0280  5    Advance Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&. Four years
E34 0290  3    ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon
E34 0300  1    signs; today, 85% is in plastics.
E34 0300  7       From the volume standpoint, the total market represented
E34 0310  5    by the sign industry is impressive. Aggregate sales
E34 0320  2    during 1960 reached approximately $500 million. Currently,
E34 0330  1    there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging
E34 0330 10    from small firms with a handful of employees to major
E34 0340  8    concerns having complete facilities for production
E34 0350  3    of metal, electrical, and plastic components.
E34 0360  1    #WHY THE TREND TO PLASTICS?#
E34 0360  5    What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the
E34 0370  5    sign and display field? Out of many factors which might
E34 0380  2    be cited, five are most important:
E34 0380  8    _1._
E34 0380  9       Plastics combine such properties as built-in color,
E34 0390  7    light weight, optional transparency or translucency,
E34 0400  3    resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication.
E34 0410  1    _2._
E34 0410  2       Plastic signs are economical. According to one major
E34 0420  2    producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are
E34 0420 10    approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable
E34 0430  8    neon unit. Shipping cost is also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft&
E34 0440  9    plastic sign weighs about 120 lb&, compared to 275-300
E34 0450  5    lb& for neon. The weight advantage, plus greater durability
E34 0460  2    of the plastic unit, yields a saving of about one-fifth
E34 0470  1    in shipping. The lighter weight also means less costly
E34 0470 10    supports and mountings are needed. Finally, maintenance
E34 0480  5    costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile
E34 0490  6    neon signs.
E34 0490  8    _3._
E34 0490  9       They offer exceptional design freedom, making it
E34 0500  1    possible to incorporate contours and details which
E34 0510  2    give free range to the talents of the designer. Vacuum-
E34 0510 13    and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between
E34 0520  7    cardboard and molded plastics. Pre-decoration, low-cost
E34 0530  3    molds, and the freedom to form large and small, thick
E34 0540  4    and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the
E34 0550  1    industry.
E34 0550  2    _4._
E34 0550  3       Plastics signs work around the clock. Internal illumination,
E34 0560  2    protected from the elements, gives them powerful visual
E34 0570  1    appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant
E34 0570  9    colors command attention and interest.
E34 0580  4    _5._
E34 0580  5       Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques
E34 0590  2    give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely
E34 0590 10    wide choice of production techniques, ranging from
E34 0600  7    injection molding for intricate, smaller-size, mass-production
E34 0610  6    signs (generally 5000 units is the minimum) to vacuum
E34 0620  5    and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs.
E34 0630  2    Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display
E34 0630 11    field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding.
E34 0650  1    _WHAT PLASTICS TO USE?_
E34 0650  3       For outdoor signs and displays, acrylic, with its
E34 0650 11    outstanding optical characteristics, weather resistance
E34 0660  5    and formability, strongly dominates the picture. At
E34 0670  5    present, both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer
E34 0680  4    extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers,
E34 0690  1    with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of
E34 0690  9    the total. (See panel, p& 166, for a comparison.)
E34 0700  7       Of interest is a recent announcement by Du Pont's
E34 0710  1    Polychemicals Dept& of a new methyl methacrylate monomer
E34 0720  2    designated as Monocite ~H 100, which was developed
E34 0730  1    specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets
E34 0730  8    for the sign and lighting industry. Sheeting cast from
E34 0740  6    this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much
E34 0750  6    as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather, and
E34 0760  2    will not yellow. Its high impact strength, even at
E34 0760 11    low temperatures, resists chipping, cracking, and crazing,
E34 0770  6    according to Du Pont.
E34 0780  1       Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for
E34 0780  8    vacuum-formed signs, background panels, and molded
E34 0790  6    or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness,
E34 0800  3    ease of forming, and excellent weathering properties.
E34 0810  1    Its clarity and good optical properties are other important
E34 0820  1    factors. New to the field is a duplex type butyrate
E34 0820 11    laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are
E34 0830  8    of different color. Thermoforming the laminate and
E34 0840  4    then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical
E34 0850  1    way to produce a two-color sign. (see ~MPl, Mar& 1961,
E34 0860  1    p& 98).
E34 0870  2       For specialized types of displays, such as large
E34 0870 10    three-dimensional units reproducing a product, package,
E34 0880  6    human or animal figures, etc&, reinforced plastics
E34 0890  4    and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other
E34 0900  3    materials frequently used.
E34 0900  6       A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester
E34 0910  6    film, now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated
E34 0920  4    signs (see below).
E34 0920  7       For outdoor signs and displays, where the problem
E34 0930  5    of weathering resistance is no longer a factor, the
E34 0940  3    choice of plastics is almost unlimited. Here may be
E34 0940 12    found regular and impact styrene, cellulose acetate,
E34 0950  7    cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate, acrylic,
E34 0960  4    vinyl, expandable styrene foam, and polyethylene. The
E34 0970  2    final choice of material depends upon such factors
E34 0970 10    as costs, method of fabrication, degree of complexity,
E34 0980  8    number of units required, time available for tooling,
E34 0990  6    and projected life expectancy of the unit. Often, the
E34 1000  5    finished sign or display incorporates several types
E34 1010  1    of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques.
E34 1010  9    #TRANS-ILLUMINATED BILLBOARDS#
E34 1020  2    One of the most significant advancements in design
E34 1030  1    of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated
E34 1030 10    billboard, now being produced by several large sign
E34 1040  7    manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles,
E34 1050  6    and Industrial Electric Inc&, New Orleans, La&.
E34 1060  4       The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated
E34 1070  3    boards and existing billboards is that the former,
E34 1080  1    constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted
E34 1080  8    from within. With the source of light behind the copy,
E34 1090  9    there is no loss of lumen output, as with conventional
E34 1100  4    boards illuminated by means of reflected light. Also,
E34 1110  2    the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather
E34 1110 11    exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.
E34 1120  9       The copy itself, including any text or illustrations,
E34 1130  6    is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar
E34 1140  5    polyester film by a photo screen process. The film
E34 1150  2    has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be
E34 1150 13    stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign,
E34 1160  7    and also to be stripped off for replacement by new
E34 1170  4    copy as required. Spare sets of face panels simplify
E34 1180  1    the change from one copy or message to another; new
E34 1180 11    panels are exchanged for the old right in the field
E34 1190  8    on a single trip. Panels with outdated copy are returned
E34 1200  5    to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.
E34 1210  1       Signs of this type have already made their appearance
E34 1220  1    in several larger cities, and others are on the way.
E34 1220 11    It is believed that these boards will, within the next
E34 1230  7    few years, replace many of the conventional flood-lighted
E34 1240  4    boards now in use.
E34 1240  8       Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in
E34 1250  6    other directions. As used by Industrial Electric Inc&,
E34 1260  3    the film panels are printed one at a time, as are 24-sheet
E34 1270  4    posters. Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted
E34 1270 14    translucent plastics faces; they can also be applied
E34 1280  8    to opaque panels for use on cutouts, or they can be
E34 1290  9    applied directly to painted bulletin faces. In this
E34 1300  4    way, the sign maker has an economical means for displaying
E34 1310  1    uniform copy on different sign media.
E34 1310  7       Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new
E34 1320  5    development made possible by modern plastic materials-
E34 1330  3    a revolving spectacular sign. Comprised of 16 triangular
E34 1340  2    trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible
E34 1340 10    to combine three different signs in a single unit.
E34 1350  9    The triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which
E34 1360  6    permits 9 sec& of viewing time for each poster subject.
E34 1370  4    Sixteen panels, each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft& wide,
E34 1380  2    make up the 25-ft& length of the sign.
E34 1380 11    #CHANGEABLE LETTERS FILL MANY NEEDS#
E34 1390  4    Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of
E34 1400  2    design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs
E34 1400 11    and displays would be to look at what is happening
E34 1410  9    in only one of the areas in this complex field- changeable
E34 1420  4    signs.
E34 1420  5       Signs are meant to convey a message, and in most
E34 1430  6    cases, this requires words and letters. Frequently,
E34 1440  1    the message must be changed at intervals to feature
E34 1440 10    new products, price changes, etc&. The huge market
E34 1450  7    for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand
E34 1460  4    for individual plastic letters, in all shapes and sizes-
E34 1470  3    and a number of companies are set up to supply them.
E34 1470 14    Here are some of the newer items currently available:
E34 1480  9       Poster Products Inc&, Chicago, Ill&: a changeable
E34 1490  6    copy and display sign which consists of an extruded
E34 1500  6    impact styrene background in choice of colors, onto
E34 1510  3    which are mounted snap-in letters, figures, or words
E34 1510 12    screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock.
E34 1520  9    The background, which is available in various widths
E34 1530  4    and continuous lengths, is extruded with parallel undercut
E34 1540  3    grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.
E34 1550  1       The Adaptaplex Co&, Beaverton, Ore&; letters molded
E34 1560  1    of butyrate, available in several sizes in either red
E34 1560 10    or black. Ideal for merchandising use, they are
E34 1570  6    weather-resistant,
E34 1570  8    and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings
E34 1580  9    in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel.
E34 1590  3       For large letters, e&g& thermoformed of acrylic
E34 1600  3    or butyrate, there are other techniques. For example,
E34 1610  1    in a typical store installation, fifty 24-in& and six
E34 1610 11    36-in& red acrylic letters were mounted against a white
E34 1620  8    painted wood background. The fact that even the larger
E34 1630  7    letters weighed only 5 lb& each made it possible to
E34 1640  4    secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic
E34 1650  1    angle brackets cemented to the letters. Stainless steel
E34 1650  9    screws were used to minimize corrosion stains. For
E34 1660  7    mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds, very small
E34 1670  4    holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and
E34 1680  2    stainless steel wire threaded through the openings,
E34 1680  9    its ends twisted behind the panels.
E34 1690  5       Large injection-molded letters are also available
E34 1700  3    for sign installations. Wagner Sign Service Inc&, Chicago,
E34 1710  2    for example, supplies them in several colors, in heights
E34 1710 11    of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 17 inches. They are molded of a
E34 1720 13    special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate.
E34 1730  5    Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars,
E34 1740  6    extruded of transparent acrylic material, which may
E34 1750  3    be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.
E34 1760  1    Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft&, the bars are shaped
E34 1760 13    in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered
E34 1770 10    slots molded in back of the letters.
E34 1780  4       Still another approach to the changeable letter
E34 1790  1    type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt
E34 1790 11    Products, Azusa, Calif&. This vacuum formed sign is
E34 1800  7    comprised of 27-in& (or smaller) panels formed of 0.080-in&
E34 1810  7    clear butyrate sheet stock, masked and sprayed on the
E34 1820  5    rear side. Finished signs are produced by sliding the
E34 1830  2    separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in& aluminum,
E34 1840  1    which may be mounted to various surfaces. The sheets
E34 1840 10    are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties
E34 1850  6    Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&.
E34 1860  1       On large-area units, where additional structural
E34 1860  8    requirements are imposed, one recent approach utilizes
E34 1870  7    modular extruded or formed channels (e&g& right-angled
E34 1880  5    corrugations) of the acrylic or butyrate. Joined side
E34 1890  3    by side, such channels make possible construction of
E34 1900  2    continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50
E34 1900 10    ft& high and of unlimited width. Letters may be wired
E34 1910  8    to the face of the combined channels, painted on the
E34 1920  5    first surface, or handled in other ways.
E35 0010  1    #NEW RULE NO& 2: DON'T BUILD FROM THE OUTSIDE IN- TRY
E35 0010 12    TO BUILD FROM THE INSIDE OUT#
E35 0030  4    Don't insert your components into fixed openings, they
E35 0040  2    may or may not fit; position your components before
E35 0040 11    you close them in. For example:
E35 0050  5       Don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall
E35 0060  5    cabinets and set the appliances. It's a lot quicker
E35 0070  1    and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets
E35 0070 11    and erect the end wall after they are all in place.
E35 0080 10       Set your bathtub before you close in the end of
E35 0090  7    the bathroom. Don't try to wrestle a 400-~lb tub **f
E35 0100  5    through a narrow doorway.
E35 0100  9       Finish your plumbing before you frame it in (most
E35 0110  7    economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition
E35 0120  2    on either side of the pipes).
E35 0120  8       Finish installing and connecting up your furnace
E35 0130  5    and your water heater before you wall them in. There
E35 0140  3    is no better way to waste time than trying to install
E35 0140 14    a furnace in a finished **f closet.
E35 0150  7       Don't position your studs before you insert your
E35 0160  5    windows in conventional construction; that way you
E35 0170  2    may pay more to shim the window into place than you
E35 0170 13    paid for the window. You can save all that shimming
E35 0180  8    time if you set your windows in one, two, three order-
E35 0190  6    first the stud on one side, then the window, then the
E35 0200  3    stud on the other side.
E35 0200  8       Install your disappearing stair (or stairs) to the
E35 0210  6    attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall
E35 0220  3    the ceiling.
E35 0220  5       Don't close in your house until everything has been
E35 0230  3    carried in. Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall
E35 0240  1    between the house and garage. That way he can truck
E35 0240 11    his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof.
E35 0250  8       No auto maker would dream of putting the head on
E35 0260  7    the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block.
E35 0270  4    And trailer makers, those most industrialized and therefore
E35 0280  1    most efficient of homebuilders, say they save hundreds
E35 0280  9    of dollars by always building from the inside out.
E35 0290  8    #NEW RULE NO& 3 RETHINK EVERYTHING TO GET ALL THE BIG
E35 0310  6    SAVINGS THE REVOLUTION IN MATERIALS HANDLING OFFERS
E35 0320  2    YOU#
E35 0320  3    This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less
E35 0330  1    news of all, because **h
E35 0330  6    _1._
E35 0330  7       It makes it easy to handle much heavier units, so
E35 0340  3    you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier
E35 0340 13    prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures
E35 0350  8    alongside.
E35 0360  1    _2._
E35 0360  1       It makes materials handling the only construction
E35 0360  8    cost that (like earthmoving and roadbuilding) should
E35 0370  5    be lower today than in 1929.
E35 0380  1    _3._
E35 0380  1       It changes the answers to "Who should do what, and
E35 0380 11    where"? It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication
E35 0390 10    and increases the chance for shop fabrication, where
E35 0400  7    almost everything can be made better and cheaper.
E35 0410  4    _4._
E35 0410  5       It changes the answers on when to do what at the
E35 0420  3    site. For example, instead of putting in your driveways
E35 0420 12    last (as many builders do) you can now save money by
E35 0430 11    putting them in first. Instead of closing the house
E35 0440  6    in first (as most builders do) you can now cut your
E35 0450  4    costs by not closing it in until you have to (see ~p
E35 0460  1    121).
E35 0460  2    _5._
E35 0460  3       It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations.
E35 0470  1    Not so long ago many builders were finding they could
E35 0470 11    cut their costs by "buying direct" and short-cutting
E35 0480  7    the dealer. But now many of these same builders are
E35 0490  5    finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up
E35 0500  2    with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most
E35 0500 13    efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything
E35 0510  4    just where it is needed- drywall inside the house,
E35 0520  7    siding along the sides, trusses on the walls, roofing
E35 0530  2    on the roof, etc&.
E35 0530  6       Says Clarence Thompson: "We dealers must earn our
E35 0540  5    mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper
E35 0550  2    than he could do it himself". The revolution now under
E35 0560  1    way in materials handling makes this much easier.
E35 0570  1    _THE REVOLUTION IS WELL UNDER WAY, BUT MUCH MORE REMAINS
E35 0570  9    TO BE DONE_
E35 0570 12       Five years ago a HOUSE + HOME Round Table cosponsored
E35 0580  8    by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily:
E35 0590  5       "Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle
E35 0600  8    unit loads; only one box car in eight has the wide
E35 0610  6    doors needed for unit loads; only one producer in a
E35 0620  3    hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads;
E35 0620 12    only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive
E35 0630  8    unit loads.
E35 0630 10       "So from raw materials to finished erection the
E35 0640  8    costs of materials handling (most of it inefficient)
E35 0650  5    add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost
E35 0660  2    of housing".
E35 0660  4       "That HOUSE + HOME Round Table was the real starting
E35 0670  5    point for today's revolution in materials handling",
E35 0680  2    says Clarence Thompson, long chairman of the Lumber
E35 0680 10    Dealers' Research Council. "It made our whole industry
E35 0690  8    recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between
E35 0700 10    manufacturer, carrier, equipment maker, dealer, and
E35 0710  4    builder, all working together to cut the cost of materials
E35 0720  3    handling. Before that we lumber dealers were working
E35 0730  1    almost single-handed on the problem".
E35 0740  1    _HERE IS WHERE THINGS STAND TODAY:_
E35 0740  2       _1._
E35 0740  3       Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater
E35 0750  1    primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of
E35 0750 11    this year's new houses are mechanized. There are few
E35 0760  7    areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped
E35 0770  5    to save him money by delivering everything at lower
E35 0780  3    cost just where his workmen will need it.
E35 0780 11    _2._
E35 0780 12       Practically all bulky housing products can now be
E35 0790  8    ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for
E35 0800  4    mechanical handling- including lumber, asphalt shingles,
E35 0810  2    glass block, face brick, plaster, lime, hardboard,
E35 0810  9    gypsum wallboard and sheathing, cement, insulation
E35 0820  6    sheathing, floor tile, acoustical tile, plaster base,
E35 0830  4    and asbestos shingles.
E35 0830  7    _3._
E35 0830  8       Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now
E35 0840  6    offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding
E35 0850  5    need. For some significant new items see the pictures.
E35 0860  4    _4._
E35 0860  5       More than 50% of all lumber is unitized; an ~NLRDA
E35 0870  3    survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap
E35 0880  2    their shipments for mechanized handling. Of these,
E35 0880  9    376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in
E35 0890  8    standard units, because they save enough on mechanized
E35 0900  5    carloading to offset their strapping cost. Most of
E35 0901  3    the others will swallow their 50@ to $3 charge rather
E35 0910  9    than lose a good customer. "With a 15,500-~lb fork-lift,
E35 0920 10    dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box
E35 0930  7    cars for 30@/~mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload
E35 0940  7    loose lumber one piece at a time", says James Wright
E35 0950  3    of ~NLRDA.
E35 0950  5    _5._
E35 0950  6       Lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed
E35 0960  4    on a standard unit for unitized shipments- 48'' wide
E35 0970  5    by a nominal 30'' high (or six McCracken packets 24''
E35 0980  2    wide by nominal 7'' high). These units make it easy
E35 0980 12    to load as much as 48,000 ~bd ~ft (say 120,000 ~lb
E35 0990 11    in a 50' box car- much more than the average for loose-loaded
E35 1000  9    cars.
E35 1000 10    _6._
E35 1000 11       The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more
E35 1010  8    box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading
E35 1020  6    (a 21% increase while the total number of box cars
E35 1030  5    was falling 6%) and by cutting their freight rates
E35 1040  1    twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars. First
E35 1040 10    was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of
E35 1050  9    the load in excess of 40,000 ~lb; later came a 1961
E35 1060  6    cut on the West Coast (still pending elsewhere) of
E35 1070  2    7@/~cwt on 70,000 ~lb-plus carloads (which works out
E35 1070 11    to more than $4/~mbf on that portion of the load in
E35 1080 11    excess of 70,000 ~lb).
E35 1090  2    _7._
E35 1090  3       More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars,
E35 1100  1    and ~NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with
E35 1100 10    the new Type 6-~B floating-load method can be unloaded
E35 1110  9    for at little at 5.4@/~mbf. For long hauls these shipments
E35 1120  6    should be protected with water-proof paper. This costs
E35 1130  4    from 75@ to $2.30/~mbf, but the cover can pay off if
E35 1140  4    the lumber is to be stored in the open.
E35 1150  1    _THESE CARRIERS CUT HANDLING COSTS FOR THE DEALER-
E35 1150  7    AND THE BUILDER_
E35 1150 10       Says ~NRLDA's James Wright: "Since 1958 carriers
E35 1160  6    that move material from the yard to the job site have
E35 1170  9    undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's
E35 1180  6    other equipment".
E35 1180  8       The reason: today's components and lumber packages
E35 1190  5    are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and
E35 1200  5    a helper. So manufacturers have pioneered a new type
E35 1210  2    of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier. It cuts the
E35 1210 11    lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man-
E35 1220  8    the driver- to unload it, and because it unloads in
E35 1230  7    a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost
E35 1240  4    of hand unloading. and it helps the builder because
E35 1240 13    it can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can
E35 1250  9    deliver it to the best spot (in some cases, right on
E35 1260  7    the roof or inside the house), and never takes any
E35 1270  3    of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.
E35 1280  1       Says Wright: "Our survey shows that one third of
E35 1280 10    the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization
E35 1300  7    of their materials handling in the coming two years.
E35 1310  6    And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles".
E35 1320  2    #NEW RULE NO& 4: RESTUDY WHAT YOUR MEN DO, TO HELP
E35 1330  3    THEM WASTE LESS OF THE TIME YOU PAY FOR#
E35 1330 12    Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted
E35 1340  9    because the job was not planned right, so the right
E35 1350  4    tools were not handy at the right place at the right
E35 1360  1    time, or the right materials were not delivered to
E35 1360 10    the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in
E35 1370  7    the right order for erection, or you bought cheap materials
E35 1380  4    that took too long to fit, or your workmen had to come
E35 1390  3    back twice to finish a job they could have done on
E35 1390 14    one trip.
E35 1400  1       Even "America's most efficient builder", Bob Schmitt
E35 1410  1    of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000
E35 1410 11    per house as a result of the time-+-motion studies
E35 1420  8    now being completed on his operation by industrial
E35 1430  3    efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works. Already
E35 1440  1    this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation
E35 1440 10    manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and
E35 1450  9    wasted motion.
E35 1450 11       Builder Eddie Carr of Washington, past president
E35 1460  7    of ~NAHB, cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by
E35 1470  6    adopting the "~SCR masonry process" worked out after
E35 1480  4    careful time-+-motion studies by the Structural Clay
E35 1490  2    Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do
E35 1490  9    better work for less. A midwestern builder cut his
E35 1500  9    labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50
E35 1510  6    by adopting this same process, cut them another $7.50
E35 1520  2    to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot
E35 1520 13    100-brick packages. The ~SCR process, with its precision
E35 1530  8    corner-posts, its precision guide lines, its working
E35 1540  7    level scaffold, and its hand-level brick supply takes
E35 1550  4    eight manhours to get set, but once ready it makes
E35 1560  3    it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a
E35 1560 13    day. See page 156.
E35 1570  3       One good way to cut your labor waste is to make
E35 1580  1    sure you are using just the right number of men in
E35 1580 12    each crew. Reports Jim Lendrum: "By studying men on
E35 1590  7    the job, we found that two men- a carpenter and a helper-
E35 1600  8    can lay a floor faster than three. We found that three
E35 1610  4    men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall panels
E35 1620  2    or trusses more economically than four men- because
E35 1620 10    four men don't make two teams; they make one inefficient
E35 1630  9    three-men-and-a-helper team. We found that wherever
E35 1640  6    you can use two teams on a job, five men, not four,
E35 1650  5    is the magic number".
E35 1650  9       No house was ever built that could not have been
E35 1660  7    built better for less if the work had been better planned
E35 1670  4    and the work better scheduled.
E35 1670  9    #NEW RULE NO& 5: DON'T WASTE ANY 10@-A-MINUTE TIME
E35 1680  9    ON GREEN LUMBER TO SAVE 3@ A STUD#
E35 1690  3    This is the most penny-wise, pound-foolish chisel a
E35 1690 13    builder can commit.
E35 1700  3       Green lumber was all very well back in the days
E35 1710  1    of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to
E35 1710 11    swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the
E35 1720  9    gypsum. But now that all production builders build
E35 1730  3    with drywall and all smart builders build with panels,
E35 1740  1    green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.
E35 1740  9       Green studs cost about 65@; dry studs cost less
E35 1750  9    than 3@ more. So if a green stud makes a carpenter
E35 1760  7    or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20
E35 1770  3    seconds, the green stud becomes more expensive than
E35 1770 11    a dry stud.
E36 0010  1       There comes a time in the lives of most of us when
E36 0010 13    we want to be alone. Not necessarily to be off all
E36 0020  9    by ourselves, but away from the crowds and common happenstance.
E36 0030  5    If you've travelled in Europe a time or two, it is
E36 0040  6    quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone
E36 0050  1    feeling or that you will get it on your next visit
E36 0050 12    across the Atlantic. Following a guide, and gratefully
E36 0060  6    so, is an excellent way to see all the important places
E36 0070  6    when everything is strange and new. However, after
E36 0080  2    you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas,
E36 0080 10    the places and forums, the churches and museums, the
E36 0090  9    palaces and castles, and begin to feel at home in the
E36 0100  9    capitals of Europe, you'll want to change your course
E36 0110  4    and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market
E36 0120  1    places.
E36 0120  2       The champagne at Troyes, the traditional capital
E36 0130  1    of the champagne country, has more ambrosial taste
E36 0130  9    somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de
E36 0140  9    la Paix or at Tour d'Argent. You can relive history
E36 0150  4    and follow, in fancy, the Crusaders in their quest
E36 0160  1    for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi,
E36 0160 11    an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot. And you
E36 0170 10    don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which
E36 0180  6    has remained almost untouched by time and tourists
E36 0190  3    since the Middle Ages. Time stands still as you climb
E36 0200  1    the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging
E36 0200  9    to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book
E36 0210  7    towns, perched atop lofty crags, their faces turned
E36 0220  4    to the sea. They've been there since the days of the
E36 0230  3    Moors and the Saracens. And what better way to end
E36 0230 13    a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a
E36 0240 10    squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean?
E36 0250  5       An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth
E36 0260  5    on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the
E36 0270  3    wheel of a car and head for the open road.
E36 0270 13       For those who need or want and can afford another
E36 0280  9    car, buying one and driving it on the grand tour, then
E36 0290  7    shipping it home, is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself
E36 0300  5    pilgrimage. Then, of course, there are those of us
E36 0310  1    who either do not want or need or cannot afford another
E36 0310 12    car. The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone
E36 0320 10    and arrange to rent one. It is that elemental.
E36 0330  5       Almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you.
E36 0340  5    You can call one of the car rental services directly
E36 0350  1    (Hertz, Avis, Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental, and others)
E36 0350  9    and ask them to reserve a car of your choice, and some
E36 0360 11    transportation lines offer this service as well. With
E36 0370  7    few exceptions, your car will be waiting for you at
E36 0380  4    dockside, airport, railroad station or hotel when you
E36 0390  1    arrive, oftentimes at no additional cost. You can wait,
E36 0390 10    of course, until you arrive in Europe before renting
E36 0400  7    your car. The disadvantages to this method are that
E36 0410  6    you may not have as great a choice of models readily
E36 0420  2    available or you may have to wait a few days or, during
E36 0420 14    the busy tourist season, when cars are in great demand,
E36 0430  9    you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at
E36 0440  7    all. Since charges are relatively the same, reserving
E36 0450  3    a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of
E36 0460  1    having one on tap when you want it.
E36 0460  9       For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route
E36 0470  6    and return by another some agencies offer a service
E36 0480  3    whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival
E36 0480 15    and leave it in another city, or even another country,
E36 0490  9    when you are ready to return home. At some cities,
E36 0500  6    this pick-up and delivery service is without additional
E36 0510  2    charge, and, if you are budget-wise, when you are planning
E36 0520  1    your itinerary, you will take advantage of these free
E36 0520 10    delivery and collection stations in major cities within
E36 0530  8    the larger European countries.
E36 0540  1       International Touring Documents are usually provided
E36 0550  1    with the car as are road maps and touring data. A valid
E36 0550 13    American driving license is accepted in all countries
E36 0560  8    except Portugal, Spain, Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe.
E36 0570  2    If you plan to visit any of these countries, you can
E36 0580  3    obtain your International Driving Permit before you
E36 0590  1    leave at a nominal fee- around $3.00. Your insurance,
E36 0590 10    too, with most agencies, is provided with the car,
E36 0600  8    covering comprehensive fire, theft, liability and collision
E36 0610  5    with a deductible clause which varies in different
E36 0620  3    countries. If you would feel happier with full collision
E36 0630  1    insurance, there is a small additional charge, again
E36 0630  9    varying from country to country and depending on the
E36 0640  7    term of such insurance. The average charge for this
E36 0650  4    additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day.
E36 0660  1    The charge is variable, however, and goes as low as
E36 0660 11    50@ a day in Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in
E36 0670 10    Greece.
E36 0670 11       Rental fees are variable, too, throughout the countries
E36 0680  7    of Europe. There are as many rates as there are countries
E36 0690  7    and models of cars available. As in the United States,
E36 0700  4    there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few
E36 0710  3    cents per kilometer driven, and the per-day rate drops
E36 0710 13    if the car is retained for a week. It drops again after
E36 0720 10    fifteen and/or twenty-one days.
E36 0730  2       It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost
E36 0730 13    from 80@ to 90@ for the equivalent of a United States
E36 0740 11    gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford,
E36 0750  8    Chevrolet or even a Cadillac, which are available in
E36 0760  5    some countries, it is probably wiser to choose the
E36 0770  2    smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five
E36 0770 10    and even forty miles to the gallon.
E36 0780  7       Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed
E36 0790  3    by the number of people travelling in your group. With
E36 0800  2    the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny
E36 0800 12    sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing
E36 0810  8    to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical
E36 0820  5    transportation. There is a large variety of models
E36 0830  3    to choose from in most countries, however, including
E36 0830 11    6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental
E36 0840  8    fee isn't all that much greater than for the wee sedans.
E36 0850  8       The basic costs are generally pretty much the same
E36 0860  5    regardless of the agency through which you reserve
E36 0870  2    your car, but some of them offer supplementary advantages.
E36 0880  1    There is the free intra-city "rent it here, leave it
E36 0880 12    there" service, as an example, the free delivery and
E36 0900  8    collection at the airport, dockside or your hotel,
E36 0910  4    luggage racks, touring documents and information and
E36 0920  2    other similar services. A little investigation by telephone
E36 0920 10    or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines
E36 0930  9    will give you these pertinent details on the additional
E36 0940  6    money-saving benefits. The investigation will be well
E36 0950  4    worth your time.
E36 0950  7       All model cars are not available in all countries.
E36 0960  5    Quite naturally, there is a greater availability of
E36 0970  2    those models which are manufactured within a specific
E36 0970 10    country. If you would like to start your tour in Italy,
E36 0980 11    where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe,
E36 0990  8    Fiats in all sizes are available, as are Alfa Romeo
E36 1000  5    Giulietta models. If you wish to budget closely on
E36 1010  3    transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge
E36 1010 10    in luxuries, one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at
E36 1020  9    only $1.26 a day plus 3@ a kilometer and the Fiat 2100
E36 1025  7    Station Wagon, seating six, at just $1.10 a day and
E36 1040  5    10-1/2@ a kilometer. If you will be using your car
E36 1050  1    more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the
E36 1050 10    daily rates drop quite sharply to 86@ a day for the
E36 1060 10    Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal 30@ a day for the
E36 1070  6    Fiat 2100 Station Wagon. With six in the group, the
E36 1080  3    cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the
E36 1080 15    daily fee.
E36 1090  2       In the majority of countries, however, the rates
E36 1090 10    range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans
E36 1100 10    and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger,
E36 1110  8    luxury European models, with the rate per kilometer
E36 1120  3    driven starting at 3@ and going up as high as 12@.
E36 1130  1    The same model car might be available in six or eight
E36 1130 12    countries, yet not two countries will have the same
E36 1140  8    rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer
E36 1150  5    driven. The variations are not too great. Rates for
E36 1160  2    American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about
E36 1160 10    $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible,
E36 1170 10    but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same
E36 1180  7    as for the larger European models. Rates in Greece
E36 1190  4    and Finland are fairly high, actually the highest in
E36 1200  2    Europe, and, surprisingly enough, they are also quite
E36 1200 10    high in Ireland.
E36 1210  1       If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than
E36 1210 11    a month, it might be wise for you to lease a car. The
E36 1220 13    actual over-all cost, for the first month, will perhaps
E36 1230  8    not be too much lower than the rental charges for the
E36 1240  5    same period of time, but you will receive a new car.
E36 1250  2    You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new
E36 1250 13    car owner, which includes the factory guarantee and
E36 1260  7    the services valid at authorized dealers throughout
E36 1270  3    Europe. Further, there is no mileage charge or mileage
E36 1280  3    limitations when you lease a car, and you pay only
E36 1280 13    the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents
E36 1290  9    and insurance since the car is registered and insured
E36 1300  7    individually for your trip. There is a fairly wide
E36 1310  4    selection of models of English, German and French manufacture
E36 1320  1    from which you can choose from the very small Austin
E36 1320 11    7, Citroe^n 2 ~CV, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger
E36 1330  9    Simca Beaulieu. Leasing a car is not as common or as
E36 1340 11    popular as renting a car in Europe, but for long periods
E36 1350  8    it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory.
E36 1360  3    After the first month, rates are considerably less,
E36 1370  2    averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger
E36 1380  1    models.
E36 1380  2       There are reasons for some people not wanting to
E36 1380 11    rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan. For
E36 1390 11    one thing, the driver usually sees less and has less
E36 1400  7    fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary
E36 1410  3    for him to keep at least one eye on the road. Then,
E36 1420  1    too, European drivers have reputations for being somewhat
E36 1420  9    crazy on the road and some Americans are not particularly
E36 1430  9    keen on getting mixed up with them. Still there is
E36 1440  7    a way for those who want to see some of the back country
E36 1450  5    of Europe by car. The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven
E36 1460  1    car. It isn't as expensive as most people believe it
E36 1460 11    to be.
E36 1470  1       Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00
E36 1470  8    to $12.00 a day, but this charge is the same whether
E36 1480 10    you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger
E36 1490  7    Peugeot or Fiat 1800. The big spread is in the charge
E36 1500  6    for each kilometer driven, being governed by the rate
E36 1510  3    at which gasoline is consumed. Since most European
E36 1510 11    cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than
E36 1520  8    American cars, it naturally follows that the cost per
E36 1530  6    kilometer for these models will be less, but the greater
E36 1540  4    seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize
E36 1550  1    this, provided your group is sufficiently large to
E36 1550  9    fill a 7-passenger limousine.
E36 1560  2       The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars
E36 1570  1    vary in the different countries in the same manner
E36 1570 10    as they do for the drive-yourself cars. However, whether
E36 1580  7    you arrange to have a European or American model, if
E36 1590  5    you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in
E36 1600  2    relation to the number of people in your party, your
E36 1600 12    transportation expense will average very close to $10.00
E36 1610  8    per day per passenger. This will include your helpful,
E36 1620  6    English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average
E36 1630  5    of 150 kilometers in any one day. If you drive greater
E36 1640  1    distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface
E36 1640 10    and will never discover the enchantment, fascination
E36 1650  6    and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore
E36 1660  8    the hinterlands. Of course, if you want to throw all
E36 1670  5    caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac
E36 1680  1    limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have
E36 1680 10    a memorable tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is
E36 1690 10    not recommended unless you own a producing oil well
E36 1700  5    or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.
