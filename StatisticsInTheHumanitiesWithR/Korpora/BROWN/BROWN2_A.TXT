A01 0010  1       The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation
A01 0020  1    of Atlanta's recent primary election produced "no evidence"
A01 0020  9    that any irregularities took place.
A01 0030  5       The jury further said in term-end presentments that
A01 0040  3    the City Executive Committee, which had over-all charge
A01 0050  2    of the election, "deserves the praise and thanks of
A01 0050 11    the City of Atlanta" for the manner in which the election
A01 0060 11    was conducted.
A01 0070  1       The September-October term jury had been charged
A01 0070  9    by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate
A01 0080  8    reports of possible "irregularities" in the hard-fought
A01 0090  6    primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen
A01 0100  5    Jr&.
A01 0100  6       "Only a relative handful of such reports was received",
A01 0110  6    the jury said, "considering the widespread interest
A01 0120  3    in the election, the number of voters and the size
A01 0130  1    of this city".
A01 0130  4       The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's
A01 0140  1    registration and election laws "are outmoded or inadequate
A01 0150  1    and often ambiguous".
A01 0150  4       It recommended that Fulton legislators act "to have
A01 0160  4    these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing
A01 0170  1    and improving them".
A01 0170  4       The grand jury commented on a number of other topics,
A01 0180  4    among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing
A01 0190  1    departments which it said "are well operated and follow
A01 0190 10    generally accepted practices which inure to the best
A01 0200  8    interest of both governments".
A01 0210  1    #MERGER PROPOSED#
A01 0210  3    However, the jury said it believes "these two offices
A01 0220  3    should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and
A01 0220 11    reduce the cost of administration".
A01 0230  5       The City Purchasing Department, the jury said, "is
A01 0240  5    lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result
A01 0250  4    of city personnel policies". It urged that the city
A01 0250 13    "take steps to remedy" this problem.
A01 0260  6       Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law
A01 0270  4    was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
A01 0280  1       It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling
A01 0280  9    funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly
A01 0290 11    implementation of the law may be effected".
A01 0300  6       The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare
A01 0310  3    Department's handling of federal funds granted for
A01 0320  1    child welfare services in foster homes.
A01 0320  7       "This is one of the major items in the Fulton County
A01 0330  7    general assistance program", the jury said, but the
A01 0340  5    State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute
A01 0350  1    these funds through the welfare departments of all
A01 0350  9    the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton
A01 0360  9    County, which receives none of this money.
A01 0370  5       The jurors said they realize "a proportionate distribution
A01 0380  2    of these funds might disable this program in our less
A01 0390  1    populous counties".
A01 0390  3       Nevertheless, "we feel that in the future Fulton
A01 0400  3    County should receive some portion of these available
A01 0410  1    funds", the jurors said. "Failure to do this will continue
A01 0410 11    to place a disproportionate burden" on Fulton taxpayers.
A01 0420  7       The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's
A01 0430  7    court which has been under fire for its practices in
A01 0440  6    the appointment of appraisers, guardians and administrators
A01 0450  2    and the awarding of fees and compensation.
A01 0450  9    #WARDS PROTECTED#
A01 0460  1    The jury said it found the court "has incorporated
A01 0460 10    into its operating procedures the recommendations"
A01 0470  6    of two previous grand juries, the Atlanta Bar Association
A01 0480  6    and an interim citizens committee.
A01 0490  1       "These actions should serve to protect in fact and
A01 0490 10    in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its
A01 0500  9    appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms",
A01 0510  5    the jury said.
A01 0510  8       Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport,
A01 0520  7    the jury recommended "that when the new management
A01 0530  6    takes charge Jan& 1 the airport be operated in a manner
A01 0540  6    that will eliminate political influences".
A01 0550  1       The jury did not elaborate, but it added that "there
A01 0550 11    should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices
A01 0560  8    of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the
A01 0570  7    prices reasonable".
A01 0570  9    #ASK JAIL DEPUTIES#
A01 0580  2    On other matters, the jury recommended that:
A01 0580  9    _(1)_
A01 0590  1       Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton
A01 0590  8    County Jail and "a doctor, medical intern or extern
A01 0600  7    be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail".
A01 0610  5    _(2)_
A01 0610  6       Fulton legislators "work with city officials to
A01 0620  3    pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment
A01 0630  1    of a fair and equitable" pension plan for city employes.
A01 0640  1       The jury praised the administration and operation
A01 0640  8    of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's
A01 0650  7    Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady
A01 0660  6    Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.
A01 0680  1       Mayor William B& Hartsfield filed suit for divorce
A01 0680  9    from his wife, Pearl Williams Hartsfield, in Fulton
A01 0695  6    Superior Court Friday. His petition charged mental
A01 0700  5    cruelty.
A01 0700  6       The couple was married Aug& 2, 1913. They have a
A01 0710  7    son, William Berry Jr&, and a daughter, Mrs& J& M&
A01 0720  4    Cheshire of Griffin.
A01 0720  7       Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property
A01 0730  9    settlement has been agreed upon.
A01 0740  2       The petition listed the mayor's occupation as "attorney"
A01 0750  1    and his age as 71. It listed his wife's age as 74 and
A01 0750 14    place of birth as Opelika, Ala&.
A01 0760  6       The petition said that the couple has not lived
A01 0770  4    together as man and wife for more than a year.
A01 0780  1       The Hartsfield home is at 637 E& Pelham Rd& ~NE.
A01 0790  1       Henry L& Bowden was listed on the petition as the
A01 0790 11    mayor's attorney.
A01 0800  1       Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta, with exception
A01 0810  1    of one brief interlude, since 1937. His political career
A01 0810 10    goes back to his election to city council in 1923.
A01 0820  8       The mayor's present term of office expires Jan&
A01 0830  6    1. He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr&, who became
A01 0840  4    a candidate in the Sept& 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield
A01 0850  2    announced that he would not run for reelection.
A01 0860  1       Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement
A01 0860  7    to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a
A01 0870  9    top official said Wednesday.
A01 0880  1       Robert Snodgrass, state ~GOP chairman, said a meeting
A01 0890  1    held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic
A01 0890  9    responses from the audience.
A01 0900  4       State Party Chairman James W& Dorsey added that
A01 0910  3    enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held
A01 0910 14    Sept& 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen&
A01 0920 10    John Tower will be the featured speaker.
A01 0930  6       In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned
A01 0940  5    that entering a candidate for governor would force
A01 0950  1    it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain
A01 0950 11    the signatures of registered voters.
A01 0960  4       Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote
A01 0970  3    to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who
A01 0970 11    attended.
A01 0980  1       When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait
A01 0980 11    one more term to make the race, it voted no- and there
A01 0990 12    were no dissents.
A01 1000  1       The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to
A01 1000  9    face is a state law which says that before making a
A01 1010  9    first race, one of two alternative courses must be
A01 1020  4    taken:
A01 1020  5    _1._
A01 1020  6       Five per cent of the voters in each county must
A01 1030  5    sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed
A01 1040  2    to place names of candidates on the general election
A01 1040 11    ballot, or
A01 1050  2    _2._
A01 1050  3       The Republicans must hold a primary under the county
A01 1050 12    unit system- a system which the party opposes in its
A01 1060  9    platform.
A01 1070  1       Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations
A01 1070  8    director, resigned Tuesday to work for Lt& Gov& Garland
A01 1080  9    Byrd's campaign.
A01 1090  2       Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some
A01 1100  1    time. He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville,
A01 1100 11    who has been an assistant more than three years. When
A01 1110  9    the gubernatorial campaign starts, Caldwell is expected
A01 1120  5    to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd.
A01 1140  1       The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session
A01 1140 10    Monday and head for home- where some of the highway
A01 1150 10    bond money it approved will follow shortly.
A01 1160  4       Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the Senate
A01 1170  2    is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators
A01 1180  1    allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what
A01 1180 10    adjustments should be made.
A01 1190  3       Gov& Vandiver is expected to make the traditional
A01 1200  1    visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.
A01 1200 10    Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway
A01 1210  7    bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first
A01 1220  7    priority item.
A01 1220  9    #CONSTRUCTION BONDS#
A01 1220 11    Meanwhile, it was learned the State Highway Department
A01 1230  8    is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million
A01 1240  9    worth of highway reconstruction bonds.
A01 1250  2       The bond issue will go to the state courts for a
A01 1260  1    friendly test suit to test the validity of the act,
A01 1260 11    and then the sales will begin and contracts let for
A01 1270  7    repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled
A01 1280  4    highways.
A01 1280  5       A Highway Department source said there also is a
A01 1290  6    plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth
A01 1300  2    of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction
A01 1300 11    work.
A01 1310  1    #A REVOLVING FUND#
A01 1310  4    The department apparently intends to make the Rural
A01 1320  3    Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds
A01 1320 12    would be issued every time a portion of the old ones
A01 1330 11    are paid off by tax authorities.
A01 1340  2       Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with
A01 1350  1    a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of
A01 1350 10    $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed
A01 1360  7    by then Gov& Marvin Griffin.
A01 1370  2       The Highway Department source told The Constitution,
A01 1380  1    however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about
A01 1380 10    the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds.
A01 1400  1       Schley County Rep& B& D& Pelham will offer a resolution
A01 1410  1    Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of
A01 1410 11    Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense
A01 1420 10    allowances.
A01 1430  1       Pelham said Sunday night there was research being
A01 1430  8    done on whether the "quickie" vote on the increase
A01 1440  6    can be repealed outright or whether notice would have
A01 1450  4    to first be given that reconsideration of the action
A01 1460  1    would be sought.
A01 1460  4       While emphasizing that technical details were not
A01 1470  2    fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would
A01 1470 10    seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the
A01 1480  7    House voted through 87-31.
A01 1490  1       A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote
A01 1490 11    of 29-5. As of Sunday night, there was no word of a
A01 1500 11    resolution being offered there to rescind the action.
A01 1510  6       Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November
A01 1520  4    rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators
A01 1530  1    to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.
A01 1540  1       A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the
A01 1540  9    Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education,
A01 1550  8    something it has consistently opposed in the past.
A01 1560  5       Rep& Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House
A01 1570  4    in a privilege resolution to "endorse increased federal
A01 1580  1    support for public education, provided that such funds
A01 1580  9    be received and expended" as state funds.
A01 1590  6       Barber, who is in his 13th year as a legislator,
A01 1600  5    said there "are some members of our congressional delegation
A01 1610  2    in Washington who would like to see it (the resolution)
A01 1620  1    passed". But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen
A01 1620 10    specifically asked him to offer the resolution.
A01 1630  7       The resolution, which Barber tossed into the House
A01 1640  6    hopper Friday, will be formally read Monday. It says
A01 1645  4    that "in the event Congress does provide this increase
A01 1650  8    in federal funds", the State Board of Education should
A01 1660  6    be directed to "give priority" to teacher pay raises.
A01 1670  5    _COLQUITT_
A01 1670  6       - After a long, hot controversy, Miller County has
A01 1680  4    a new school superintendent, elected, as a policeman
A01 1690  2    put it, in the "coolest election I ever saw in this
A01 1690 13    county".
A01 1700  1       The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a
A01 1700  9    veteran agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush,
A01 1710  7    a school principal and chairman of the Miller County
A01 1720  6    Democratic Executive Committee.
A01 1730  1       Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election,
A01 1730  8    and Bush got 402. Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with
A01 1740  8    a pistol, stood by at the polls to insure order.
A01 1750  6       "This was the coolest, calmest election I ever saw",
A01 1760  5    Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said. "Being at the
A01 1770  3    polls was just like being at church. I didn't smell
A01 1780  1    a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble".
A01 1780 13       The campaign leading to the election was not so
A01 1790  9    quiet, however. It was marked by controversy, anonymous
A01 1800  5    midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence.
A01 1810  3       The former county school superintendent, George
A01 1820  1    P& Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days
A01 1820 11    after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county
A01 1830 10    school board.
A01 1840  1       During the election campaign, both candidates, Davis
A01 1840  7    and Bush, reportedly received anonymous telephone calls.
A01 1850  5    Ordinary Williams said he, too, was subjected to anonymous
A01 1860  6    calls soon after he scheduled the election.
A01 1870  1       Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities
A01 1880  1    at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to
A01 1880 11    carry a gun and promised an orderly election.
A01 1890  6       Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently
A01 1900  3    made good his promise.
A01 1900  7       "Everything went real smooth", the sheriff said.
A01 1910  6    "There wasn't a bit of trouble".
A02 0010  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 0010  3       - Committee approval of Gov& Price Daniel's "abandoned
A02 0020  2    property" act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant
A02 0030  1    protests of Texas bankers.
A02 0030  5       Daniel personally led the fight for the measure,
A02 0040  4    which he had watered down considerably since its rejection
A02 0050  2    by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before
A02 0060  1    the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.
A02 0060  8       Under committee rules, it went automatically to
A02 0070  6    a subcommittee for one week. But questions with which
A02 0080  4    committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses
A02 0090  1    left little doubt that they will recommend passage
A02 0090  9    of it.
A02 0100  1       Daniel termed "extremely conservative" his estimate
A02 0100  7    that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase
A02 0110  8    an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the
A02 0120  6    end of the current fiscal year next Aug& 31.
A02 0130  2       He told the committee the measure would merely provide
A02 0130 11    means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on
A02 0140 10    the books "since Texas was a republic". It permits
A02 0150  7    the state to take over bank accounts, stocks and other
A02 0160  4    personal property of persons missing for seven years
A02 0170  2    or more.
A02 0170  4       The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally,
A02 0180  1    would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies
A02 0180  8    and other corporations to report such property to the
A02 0190  8    state treasurer. The escheat law cannot be enforced
A02 0200  5    now because it is almost impossible to locate such
A02 0210  2    property, Daniel declared.
A02 0210  5       Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler lawyer representing the
A02 0220  4    Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition keynote
A02 0230  2    when he said it would force banks to violate their
A02 0230 12    contractual obligations with depositors and undermine
A02 0240  6    the confidence of bank customers.
A02 0250  2       "If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something
A02 0260  1    to the economy", he said. "You take out of circulation
A02 0260 11    many millions of dollars".
A02 0270  4       Rep& Charles E& Hughes of Sherman, sponsor of the
A02 0280  4    bill, said a failure to enact it would amount "to making
A02 0290  2    a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance
A02 0300  1    and pipeline companies".
A02 0300  4       His contention was denied by several bankers, including
A02 0310  3    Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B& Jones of Houston,
A02 0320  3    J& B& Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.
A02 0330  1       Cox argued that the bill is "probably unconstitutional"
A02 0340  1    since, he said, it would impair contracts.
A02 0340  8       He also complained that not enough notice was given
A02 0350  7    on the hearing, since the bill was introduced only
A02 0360  3    last Monday.
A02 0370  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 0370  3       - Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill
A02 0380  1    of Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment
A02 0390  1    of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four
A02 0390 12    other largest counties.
A02 0400  1       The bill is designed to provide special schooling
A02 0400  9    for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced
A02 0410 10    cost to the state.
A02 0420  1       There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill
A02 0420 11    on to the House.
A02 0430  2       It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to
A02 0430 10    establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties
A02 0440 10    of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children
A02 0450  6    between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools,
A02 0460  6    permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas
A02 0470  2    School for the Deaf here.
A02 0470  7       Operating budget for the day schools in the five
A02 0480  6    counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant and El Paso
A02 0490  4    would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460
A02 0500  1    yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000
A02 0500 10    was absorbed, Parkhouse told the Senate.
A02 0510  5       The ~TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics
A02 0520  5    to attend the day school in Dallas County, saving them
A02 0530  3    from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.

A02 0540  2    DALLAS MAY GET to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels
A02 0550  1    soon between Reps& V& E& (Red) Berry and Joe Ratcliff.
A02 0560  1       While details are still be to worked out, Ratcliff
A02 0560 10    said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he
A02 0570 11    thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should
A02 0580  4    be rejected.
A02 0580  6       "We're getting more 'pro' letters than 'con' on
A02 0590  8    horse race betting", said Ratcliff. "But I believe
A02 0600  6    if people were better informed on this question, most
A02 0610  4    of them would oppose it also. I'm willing to stake
A02 0620  1    my political career on it".
A02 0620  6       Rep& Berry, an ex-gambler from San Antonio, got
A02 0630  5    elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies. A
A02 0640  2    House committee which heard his local option proposal
A02 0640 10    is expected to give it a favorable report, although
A02 0650  8    the resolution faces hard sledding later.

A02 0660  4    THE HOUSE passed finally, and sent to the Senate, a

A02 0680  9    THE SENATE quickly whipped through its meager fare
A02 0690  7    of House bills approved by committees, passing the
A02 0700  5    three on the calendar. One validated acts of school
A02 0710  3    districts. Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont
A02 0720  1    Navigation District.
A02 0720  3       The third amended the enabling act for creation
A02 0730  2    of the Lamar county Hospital District, for which a
A02 0730 11    special constitutional amendment previously was adopted.

A02 0740  7    WITHOUT DISSENT, senators passed a bill by Sen& A&
A02 0750  8    R& Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment
A02 0760  5    in the future of a school for the mentally retarded
A02 0770  4    in the Gulf Coast district. Money for its construction
A02 0780  1    will be sought later on but in the meantime the State
A02 0780 12    Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a
A02 0790  9    site.

A02 0790 11    TWO TAX REVISION bills were passed. One, by Sen& Louis
A02 0800  8    Crump of San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers
A02 0810  9    who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating
A02 0820  6    the requirement that each return be notarized. Instead,
A02 0830  4    retailers would sign a certificate of correctness,
A02 0840  1    violation of which would carry a penalty of one to
A02 0840 11    five years in prison, plus a $1,000 fine. It was one
A02 0850 10    of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research
A02 0860  5    League.

A02 0860  7    THE OTHER BILL, by Sen& A& M& Aikin Jr& of Paris, would

A02 0930  2    MARSHALL FORMBY of Plainview, former chairman of the

A02 0940 10    by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature
A02 0950  6    and Congress, eliminating the need for costly special
A02 0960  5    elections.
A02 0960  6       Under Formby's plan, an appointee would be selected

A02 1000  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 1000  3       - State representatives decided Thursday against
A02 1010  1    taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer
A02 1010 12    to pay.
A02 1020  1       An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs
A02 1020 13    Committee a bill which would order the referendum on
A02 1030  9    the April 4 ballot, when Texas votes on a U&S& senator.
A02 1040  7       Rep& Wesley Roberts of Seminole, sponsor of the
A02 1050  6    poll idea, said that further delay in the committee
A02 1060  2    can kill the bill.
A02 1060  6       The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten
A02 1070  5    Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it
A02 1080  2    for public hearing on Feb& 22. The proposal would have
A02 1080 12    to receive final legislative approval, by two-thirds
A02 1090  7    majorities, before March 1 to be printed on the April
A02 1100  8    4 ballot, Roberts said.
A02 1100 12       Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't
A02 1110  7    give enough information about tax proposals for the
A02 1120  6    voters to make an intelligent choice.
A02 1130  1       All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep&
A02 1130  9    Bill Jones, who was absent.
A02 1150  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 1150  3       - Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas'
A02 1160  1    big cities Thursday.
A02 1160  4       Rep& James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a
A02 1170  4    water development bill passed by the Texas House of
A02 1180  2    Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas
A02 1180 11    and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a
A02 1190  9    Wise County hamlet of 250 people.
A02 1200  4       When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114 to
A02 1210  2    4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal
A02 1210 12    is being sponsored by Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas.
A02 1220  7       Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against
A02 1230  6    Dallas and Sen& Parkhouse. The bill would increase
A02 1240  4    from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the
A02 1250  2    state could make to a local water project.
A02 1250 10       Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse
A02 1260  8    to help Dallas and other large cities get money which
A02 1270  5    Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for
A02 1280  3    rural Texas.
A02 1280  5       Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying
A02 1290  4    for all its water program by local bonds, and that
A02 1290 14    less populous places would benefit most by the pending
A02 1300  9    bill, did not sway Cotten's attack.
A02 1310  3       The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators
A02 1320  2    like J& W& Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika) de la Garza
A02 1330  4    of Mission, Sam F& Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman
A02 1340  1    of Sulphur Springs.
A02 1340  4       "This is a poor boy's bill", said Chapman. "Dallas
A02 1350  4    and Fort Worth can vote bonds. This would help the
A02 1360  3    little peanut districts".
A02 1370  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A02 1370  3       - A Houston teacher, now serving in the Legislature,
A02 1380  1    proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning
A02 1380 10    "educational methods".
A02 1390  2       Rep& Henry C& Grover, who teaches history in the
A02 1400  4    Houston public schools, would reduce from 24 to 12
A02 1400 13    semester hours the so-called "teaching methods" courses
A02 1410  8    required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching
A02 1420  9    certificate. A normal year's work in college is 30
A02 1430  7    semester hours.
A02 1430  9       Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers
A02 1440  6    to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject
A02 1450  5    they are teaching. The remainder of the 4-year college
A02 1460  2    requirement would be in general subjects.
A02 1460  8       "A person with a master's degree in physics, chemistry,
A02 1470  8    math or English, yet who has not taken Education courses,
A02 1480  8    is not permitted to teach in the public schools", said
A02 1490  5    Grover.
A02 1490  6       College teachers in Texas are not required to have
A02 1500  6    the Education courses.
A02 1500  9       Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately
A02 1510  6    joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal.

A02 1530  4       - The board of regents of Paris Junior College has
A02 1540  3    named Dr& Clarence Charles Clark of Hays, Kan& as the

A02 1550  6       Dr& Clark will succeed Dr& J& R& McLemore, who will
A02 1560  6    retire at the close of the present school term.
A02 1570  3       Dr& Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree
A02 1580  2    from the University of Oklahoma. He also received a
A02 1580 11    Master of Science degree from Texas ~A+~I College and

A02 1750  1       State and federal legislation against racial discrimination
A02 1750  8    in employment was called for yesterday in a report
A02 1760  9    of a "blue ribbon" citizens committee on the aid to
A02 1770  7    dependent children program.
A02 1780  1       The report, culminating a year long study of the
A02 1780 10    ~ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare
A02 1790  9    consulting firm, listed 10 long range recommendations
A02 1800  4    designed to reduce the soaring ~ADC case load. The
A02 1810  4    report called racial discrimination in employment "one
A02 1820  1    of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion,
A02 1820 10    and ~ADC dependency".
A02 1830  2    #"MUST SOLVE PROBLEM"#
A02 1830  5    The monthly cost of ~ADC to more than 100,000 recipients
A02 1840  8    in the county is 4.4 million dollars, said C& Virgil
A02 1850  5    Martin, president of Carson Pirie Scott + Co&, committee
A02 1860  5    chairman.
A02 1860  6       "We must solve the problems which have forced these
A02 1870  5    people to depend upon ~ADC for subsistence", Martin
A02 1880  2    said.
A02 1880  3       The volume of ~ADC cases will decrease, Martin reported,
A02 1890  3    when the community is able to deal effectively with
A02 1900  2    two problems: Relatively limited skills and discrimination
A02 1910  1    in employment because of color. These, he said, are
A02 1910 10    "two of the principal underlying causes for family
A02 1920  5    breakups leading to ~ADC".
A02 1930  1    #CALLS FOR EXTENSION#
A02 1930  4    Other recommendations made by the committee are:
A02 1940  2       Extension of the ~ADC program to all children in
A02 1950  1    need living with any relatives, including both parents,
A02 1950  9    as a means of preserving family unity.
A02 1960  4       Research projects as soon as possible on the causes
A02 1970  4    and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.
A03 0010  1       Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary
A03 0010  8    trial made statements indicating their guilt at the
A03 0020  7    time of their arrest, Judge James B& Parsons was told
A03 0030  6    in Criminal court yesterday.
A03 0040  1       The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense
A03 0040  7    counsel, startled observers and was viewed as the prelude
A03 0050  8    to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing
A03 0060  3    the eight former policemen now on trial.
A03 0070  1       Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge
A03 0070  9    Parsons to grant his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate
A03 0080  8    trial. Bellows made the request while the all-woman
A03 0090  5    jury was out of the courtroom.
A03 0090 11    #FEARS PREJUDICIAL ASPECTS#
A03 0100  2    "The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client",
A03 0110  2    Bellows told the court. "Some of the defendants strongly
A03 0120  1    indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property.
A03 0120  9    It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the
A03 0130 10    defendants made statements involving themselves and
A03 0140  4    others".
A03 0140  5       Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired,
A03 0150  5    "You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting
A03 0160  2    this"?
A03 0160  3       "Yes, your honor", replied Bellows. "What this amounts
A03 0170  5    to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all fight
A03 0180  2    in this case. There is a conflict among the defendants".
A03 0200  1    _WASHINGTON, JULY 24_
A03 0200  4       - President Kennedy today pushed aside other White
A03 0210  2    House business to devote all his time and attention
A03 0210 11    to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver
A03 0220  9    tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide
A03 0230  5    television and radio.
A03 0230  8       The President spent much of the week-end at his
A03 0240 10    summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of
A03 0250  6    portions of the address with the help of White House
A03 0260  3    aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.
A03 0260 12       Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington
A03 0270  9    in midmorning from Hyannis Port, Mass&, a White House
A03 0280  8    spokesman said the address text still had "quite a
A03 0290  8    way to go" toward completion.
A03 0300  1    #DECISIONS ARE MADE#
A03 0300  4    Asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White House press
A03 0310  3    secretary, replied, "I would say it's got to go thru
A03 0320  2    several more drafts".
A03 0320  5       Salinger said the work President Kennedy, advisers,
A03 0330  3    and members of his staff were doing on the address
A03 0340  1    involved composition and wording, rather than last
A03 0340  8    minute decisions on administration plans to meet the
A03 0350  7    latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands
A03 0360  4    and proposals for the city.
A03 0370  1       The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov&
A03 0370 11    8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge
A03 0380  7    John M& Karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained
A03 0390  6    evidence "by unfair and fundamentally illegal means".
A03 0400  3       Karns said that the cases involved a matter "of
A03 0410  3    even greater significance than the guilt or innocence"
A03 0420  1    of the 50 persons. He said evidence was obtained "in
A03 0420 11    violation of the legal rights of citizens".
A03 0430  6       Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases.
A03 0440  6    In the two other cases he ruled that the state had
A03 0450  2    been "unable to make a case". Contempt proceedings
A03 0450 10    originally had been brought against 677 persons in
A03 0460  8    133 precincts by Morris J& Wexler, special prosecutor.
A03 0470  4    #ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS#
A03 0470  7    Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued
A03 0480  9    grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in
A03 0490  7    the election investigation, questioned the individuals
A03 0500  3    in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them
A03 0510  1    before the grand jury.
A03 0510  5       Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election judges in
A03 0520  3    the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure
A03 0530  1    constituted intimidation. Wexler has denied repeatedly
A03 0530  7    that coercion was used in questioning.
A03 0540  5       Karns said it was a "wrongful act" for Wexler to
A03 0550  4    take statements "privately and outside of the grand
A03 0560  1    jury room". He said this constituted a "very serious
A03 0560 10    misuse" of the Criminal court processes.
A03 0570  6       "Actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted
A03 0580  5    a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county, altho
A03 0590  3    vindication of the authority of that court is not the
A03 0600  1    function of this court", said Karns, who is a City
A03 0600 11    judge in East St& Louis sitting in Cook County court.
A03 0610  8    #FACED SEVEN CASES#
A03 0620  1    Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases
A03 0620 11    involving 35 persons. Wexler had charged the precinct
A03 0630  7    judges in these cases with "complementary" miscount
A03 0640  3    of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one
A03 0650  3    candidate and given to another.
A03 0650  8       The cases involved judges in the 33d, 24th, and
A03 0660  7    42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st and 28th precincts
A03 0670  4    of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward,
A03 0680  1    and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.
A03 0680  9       The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the
A03 0690  7    23d ward had been heard previously and taken under
A03 0700  2    advisement by Karns. Two other cases also were under
A03 0700 11    advisement.
A03 0710  1    #CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING#
A03 0710  4    After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward
A03 0720  4    case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled
A03 0730  2    for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed,
A03 0730 11    he would dismiss them.
A03 0750  1    _WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_
A03 0750  4       - President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new
A03 0760  2    medical care program whereby social security taxes
A03 0760  9    on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay
A03 0770  8    the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million
A03 0780  6    Americans over 65 who are covered by social security
A03 0790  3    or railroad retirement programs.
A03 0790  7       The President, in a special message to Congress,
A03 0800  7    tied in with his aged care plan requests for large
A03 0810  4    federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships,
A03 0820  1    build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and
A03 0820 11    expand child health care and general medical research.
A03 0830  7       The aged care plan, similar to one the President
A03 0840  6    sponsored last year as a senator, a fight on Capitol
A03 0850  4    hill. It was defeated in Congress last year.
A03 0850 12    #COST UP TO $37 A YEAR#
A03 0860  6    It would be financed by boosting the social security
A03 0870  1    payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the
A03 0870 14    workers now paying such taxes.
A03 0880  4       The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent-
A03 0890  3    3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first
A03 0890 14    $4,800 of pay per year. The Kennedy plan alone would
A03 0900 10    boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax
A03 0910  8    to 6.5 per cent- 3.25 per cent each. Similar payroll
A03 0920  3    tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad
A03 0930  1    retirement system.
A03 0930  3       The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent
A03 0940  5    starting Jan& 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because
A03 0950  1    the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent
A03 0950 13    on that date to pay for other social security costs.
A03 0960  8    #OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE#
A03 0960 11    Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical
A03 0970  9    plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical
A03 0980  9    benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the
A03 0990  8    first year, 1963. Both figures would go higher in later
A03 1000  4    years.
A03 1000  5       Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail
A03 1010  3    federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars
A03 1010 12    over the next 10 years. These would be paid for out
A03 1020 11    of general, not payroll, taxes.
A03 1030  2    #NURSING HOME CARE#
A03 1030  5    The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons
A03 1040  4    over 65 who are under the social security and railroad
A03 1050  1    retirement systems:
A03 1050  3    _1._
A03 1050  4       Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90
A03 1060  5    days for each illness, except that the patient would
A03 1070  1    pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.
A03 1070 13    _2._
A03 1070 14       Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180
A03 1080  9    days following discharge from a hospital. A patient
A03 1090  5    could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home
A03 1100  2    care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care
A03 1100 12    for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care
A03 1110 11    credit.
A03 1110 12    _3._
A03 1120  1       Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for
A03 1120  6    all costs in excess of $20 a patient.
A03 1130  5    _4._
A03 1130  6       Community visiting nurse services at home for up
A03 1140  3    to 240 days an illness.
A03 1140  8       The President noted that Congress last year passed
A03 1150  4    a law providing grants to states to help pay medical
A03 1160  1    bills of the needy aged.
A03 1160  6    #CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST#
A03 1160  9    He said his plan is designed to "meet the needs of
A03 1170  9    those millions who have no wish to receive care at
A03 1180  5    the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless staggered
A03 1190  2    by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-
A03 1200  3    caused by an extended hospital stay".
A03 1200  9       "This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely
A03 1210  7    essential needs", he said, "and with sufficient 'deductible'
A03 1220  5    requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary
A03 1230  4    overcrowding of our hospitals.
A03 1230  8       "This is not a program of socialized medicine. It
A03 1240  9    is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute
A03 1250  6    freedom of choice guaranteed. Every person will choose
A03 1260  4    his own doctor and hospital".
A03 1260  9    #WOULDN'T PAY DOCTORS#
A03 1270  3    The plan does not cover doctor bills. They would still
A03 1280  1    be paid by the patient.
A03 1280  6       Apart from the aged care plan the President's most
A03 1290  2    ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships,
A03 1300  1    and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.
A03 1300 11       The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47
A03 1310 10    dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed
A03 1320  8    to meet the rising need for health care. Moreover,
A03 1330  5    he said, many qualified young people are not going
A03 1340  3    into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford
A03 1340 11    the schooling costs.
A03 1350  3    #CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS#
A03 1350  6    The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions
A03 1360  4    to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a
A03 1370  4    year for one-fourth of the first year students. The
A03 1380  1    schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships,
A03 1380 11    based on need, of up to $2,000 a year per student.
A03 1390  9       In addition, the government would pay a $1,000 "cost
A03 1400  6    of education" grant to the schools for each $1,500
A03 1410  3    in scholarship grants. Officials estimated the combined
A03 1420  1    programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year
A03 1430  7    and would go up to 21 millions by 1966.
A03 1440  4       The President recommended federal "matching grants"
A03 1450  2    totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing
A03 1460  1    new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity
A03 1460 10    of existing ones.
A03 1470  2    #MORE FOR NURSING HOMES#
A03 1470  6    In the area of "community health services", the President
A03 1480  4    called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a
A03 1490  3    year federal grants for nursing home construction.
A03 1490 10    He asked for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation
A03 1500  8    for "stimulatory grants" to states to improve nursing
A03 1510  7    homes.
A03 1510  8       He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum
A03 1520  7    for experimental hospitals.
A03 1530  1       In the child health field, the President said he
A03 1530 10    will recommend later an increase in funds for programs
A03 1540  8    under the children's bureau. He also asked Congress
A03 1550  5    to approve establishment of a national child health
A03 1560  3    institute.
A03 1560  4    #ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS#
A03 1560  7    The President said he will ask Congress to increase
A03 1570  7    grants to states for vocational rehabilitation. He
A03 1580  2    did not say by how much.
A03 1580  8       For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar
A03 1590  7    a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, in matching
A03 1600  3    grants for building research facilities. The President
A03 1610  1    said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified
A03 1610 10    amount, the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget
A03 1620  8    for direct government research in medicine.
A03 1630  3       The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable
A03 1640  1    elements in a sound health program- people, knowledge,
A03 1650  1    services, facilities, and the means to pay for them".
A03 1650 10    #REACTION AS EXPECTED#
A03 1660  3    Congressional reaction to the message was along expected
A03 1670  1    lines. Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care
A03 1670 10    under the social security system criticized the President's
A03 1680  8    plan. Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed
A03 1690  9    the message.
A03 1690 11       Senate Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill&] and House
A03 1700  7    Republican Leader Charles Halleck [Ind&] said the message
A03 1710  7    did not persuade them to change their opposition to
A03 1720  6    compulsory medical insurance. Halleck said the voluntary
A03 1730  4    care plan enacted last year should be given a fair
A03 1740  1    trial first.
A03 1740  3       House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D&, Tex&] called the
A03 1750  3    Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no
A03 1750 12    prediction on its fate in the House.
A03 1770  1    _WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_
A03 1770  4       - Acting hastily under White House pressure, the
A03 1780  2    Senate tonight confirmed Robert C& Weaver as the nation's
A03 1790  1    federal housing chief.
A03 1790  4       Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was
A03 1800  4    no record vote. A number of scattered "ayes" and "noes"
A03 1810  2    was heard.
A03 1810  4       Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to
A03 1820  3    speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator
A03 1820 11    of the housing and home finance agency.
A03 1830  5       In the last eight years, all Presidential appointments,
A03 1840  3    including those of cabinet rank, have been denied immediate
A03 1850  3    action because of a Senate rule requiring at least
A03 1860  1    a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.
A03 1860 12    #ENFORCE BY DEMAND#
A03 1870  1    The rule was enforced by demand of Sen& Wayne Morse
A03 1870 11    [D&, Ore&] in connection with President Eisenhower's
A03 1880  7    cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's
A03 1890  7    in 1961.
A04 0010  1    _OSLO_
A04 0010  2       The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo
A04 0010 11    meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign
A04 0020  7    Ministers has been the freer, franker, and wider discussions,
A04 0030  7    animated by much better mutual understanding than in
A04 0040  4    past meetings.
A04 0040  6       This has been a working session of an organization
A04 0050  5    that, by its very nature, can only proceed along its
A04 0060  3    route step by step and without dramatic changes. In
A04 0060 12    Oslo, the ministers have met in a climate of candor,
A04 0070 10    and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding
A04 0080  7    one another's problems.
A04 0090  1       This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly
A04 0090  8    noticeable where relations are concerned between the
A04 0100  7    "colonialist" powers and those who have never, or not
A04 0110  8    for a long time, had such problems. The nightmare of
A04 0120  4    a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated
A04 0130  1    by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing
A04 0130  8    them, and other allies who intellectually and emotionally
A04 0140  6    disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these
A04 0150  5    troubles about, has been conspicious by its absence.
A04 0160  3    #EXPLOSION AVOIDED#
A04 0160  5    In the case of Portugal, which a few weeks ago was
A04 0170  6    rumored ready to walk out of the ~NATO Council should
A04 0180  2    critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has
A04 0180 11    been a noticeable relaxation of tension. The general,
A04 0190  8    remarkably courteous, explanation has left basic positions
A04 0200  6    unchanged, but there has been no explosion in the council.
A04 0210  6    There should even be no more bitter surprises in the
A04 0220  3    ~UN General Assembly as to ~NATO members' votes, since
A04 0230  2    a new ad hoc ~NATO committee has been set up so that
A04 0240  1    in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed
A04 0240 11    in advance.
A04 0250  1       Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with
A04 0250 10    the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on
A04 0260  9    the track behind the ~NATO locomotive. Even Norway,
A04 0270  4    despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic
A04 0280  2    arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the
A04 0280 12    alliance, is today closer to the ~NATO line.
A04 0290  8       On the negative side of the balance sheet must be
A04 0300  8    set some disappointment that the United States leadership
A04 0310  4    has not been as much in evidence as hoped for. One
A04 0320  2    diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State
A04 0320 10    Dean Rusk's speeches as "inconclusive". But he hastened
A04 0330  7    to add that, if United States policies were not always
A04 0340  8    clear, despite Mr& Rusk's analysis of the various global
A04 0350  6    danger points and setbacks for the West, this may merely
A04 0360  5    mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed
A04 0370  2    its policy.
A04 0370  4    #EXPLORATORY MOOD#
A04 0370  6    A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical
A04 0380  5    appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting
A04 0390  2    is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet
A04 0390 12    correspondents accredited.
A04 0400  2       The impression has nevertheless been given during
A04 0410  3    these three days, despite Mr& Rusk's personal popularity,
A04 0420  1    that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a
A04 0420 11    somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more
A04 0430  8    ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy
A04 0440  6    on a global scale with detailed application to individual
A04 0450  3    danger spots.
A04 0450  5       The Secretary of State himself, in his first speech,
A04 0460  6    gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside
A04 0470  3    and outside the United States that has preoccupied
A04 0470 11    the new administration in the past four months.
A04 0480  8       But where the core of ~NATO is concerned, the Secretary
A04 0490  7    of State has not only reiterated the United States'
A04 0500  5    profound attachment to the alliance, "cornerstone"
A04 0510  2    of its foreign policy, but has announced that five
A04 0520  1    nuclear submarines will eventually be at ~NATO's disposal
A04 0520  9    in European waters.
A04 0530  3       The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated
A04 0540  1    a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States
A04 0540 11    will not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation
A04 0550 10    once again taken up by the council as a whole.
A04 0560  8    #CONFLICT SURVEYED#
A04 0560 10    The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the
A04 0570  6    rekindling of ~NATO realization that East-West friction,
A04 0580  5    wherever it take place around the globe, is in essence
A04 0590  5    the general conflict between two entirely different
A04 0600  1    societies, and must be treated as such without regard
A04 0600 10    to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.
A04 0610  7       The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in
A04 0620  7    three main directions: more, deeper, and more timely
A04 0630  4    political consultation within the alliance, the use
A04 0640  1    of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
A04 0640  9    (when ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to
A04 0650  9    the underdeveloped countries, and the need for strengthening
A04 0660  6    conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the
A04 0670  4    nuclear deterrent.
A04 0670  6       This increase in the "threshold", as the conventional
A04 0680  5    forces strengthening is called, will prove one of the
A04 0690  5    alliance's most difficult problems in the months to
A04 0700  2    come. Each ally will have to carry out obligations
A04 0700 11    long since laid down, but never completely fulfilled.
A04 0720  1    _WASHINGTON_
A04 0720  2       The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward
A04 0720  8    a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate
A04 0730  9    over its foreign policy erupts for the first time.
A04 0740  6       There is little optimism here that the Communists
A04 0750  4    will be any more docile at the conference table than
A04 0760  2    they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.
A04 0760 12       The United States, State Department officials explain,
A04 0770  7    now is mainly interested in setting up an international
A04 0780  7    inspection system which will prevent Laos from being
A04 0790  5    used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring
A04 0800  1    Thailand and South Viet Nam.
A04 0800  6       They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending
A04 0810  6    the Geneva conference to achieve this.
A04 0820  2       The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet
A04 0830  1    would not become Communist dominated. But it is apparent
A04 0830 10    that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent
A04 0840  7    such a possibility.
A04 0840 10    #POLICIES MODIFIED#
A04 0850  2    The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire
A04 0860  1    in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification
A04 0860 11    of the cease-fire by the international control commission
A04 0870  8    before participating in the Geneva conference.
A04 0880  5       This is another of the modifications of policy on
A04 0890  4    Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled
A04 0900  1    to make. It excuses these actions as being the chain
A04 0900 11    reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration.
A04 0910  8       Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time
A04 0920  8    enough to institute reforms in military and economic
A04 0930  4    aid policies in the critical areas.
A04 0930 10       But with the months moving on- and the immediate
A04 0940  9    confrontations with the Communists showing no gain
A04 0950  5    for the free world- the question arises:
A04 0960  1       How effective have Kennedy administration first
A04 0960  7    foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist
A04 0970  7    aggression?
A04 0980  1       Former Vice-President Richard M& Nixon in Detroit
A04 0980  8    called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet
A04 0990  8    Union. He was critical of what he feels is President
A04 1000  7    Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.
A04 1010  1    #~GOP RESTRAINED#
A04 1010  3    It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most
A04 1020  5    Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation
A04 1030  2    as Republicans see it. They can hardly restrain themselves
A04 1040  1    from raising the question of whether Republicans, if
A04 1040  9    they had been in power, would have made "amateurish
A04 1050  7    and monumental blunders" in Cuba.
A04 1060  2       One Republican senator told this correspondent that
A04 1060  9    he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack
A04 1070  9    the Kennedy administration on this score. His reply,
A04 1080  6    he said, was that he agreed to the need for unity in
A04 1090  5    the country now. But he further said that it was better
A04 1100  2    politics to let others question the wisdom of administration
A04 1100 11    policies first.
A04 1110  2       The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through
A04 1120  1    Senator Thruston B& Morton (~R) of Kentucky, chairman
A04 1130  1    of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy
A04 1130  9    administration would be held responsible if the outcome
A04 1140  8    in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist
A04 1150  5    domination.
A04 1150  6       Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed
A04 1160  6    now from another direction by 70 Harvard, Boston University,
A04 1170  6    Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
A04 1180  3    educators.
A04 1180  4    #DETENTE URGED#
A04 1180  6    This group pleads with the administration to "give
A04 1190  6    no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile
A04 1200  5    groups". It recommends that the United States "seek
A04 1210  2    instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist
A04 1210 11    bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption
A04 1220 10    of trade relations; and concentrate its constructive
A04 1230  5    efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America
A04 1240  5    the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism
A04 1250  2    feeds".
A04 1250  3       Mr& Nixon, for his part, would oppose intervention
A04 1260  2    in Cuba without specific provocation. But he did recommend
A04 1270  1    that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist
A04 1270  9    countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it
A04 1280  9    would not be tolerated.
A04 1290  1       Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military
A04 1290  9    victories in Laos, almost any observer would have said
A04 1300  7    that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected,
A04 1310  5    generally, the opinions voiced both by Mr& Nixon and
A04 1320  4    the professors.
A04 1320  6    #AID PLANS REVAMPED#
A04 1320  9    Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin
A04 1330  8    through diplomatic channels, a high official source
A04 1340  5    disclosed, that the new administration would react
A04 1350  3    even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would
A04 1350 10    during the formative period of the administration.
A04 1360  7       Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking
A04 1370  7    from administration statements. Policies on nuclear
A04 1380  3    test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed. But
A04 1390  1    thus far there has been no response in kind.
A04 1390 10       Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater
A04 1400  6    emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political
A04 1410  3    reform in recipient nations.
A04 1410  7       In Laos, the administration looked at the Eisenhower
A04 1420  6    administration efforts to show determination by sailing
A04 1430  4    a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless
A04 1440  4    gesture.
A04 1440  5       Again and again it asked the Communists to "freeze"
A04 1450  3    the military situation in Laos. But the Communists
A04 1460  1    aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.
A04 1460 10       And after several correspondents went into Pathet
A04 1470  5    Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up, administration
A04 1490  2    spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a "great service"
A04 1500  3    and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty
A04 1510  1    Organization.
A04 1510  2       ~SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans
A04 1520  3    for coping with the military losses in Laos. But the
A04 1530  2    Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any
A04 1530  9    one time for the United States to want to risk a limited
A04 1540 10    or an all-out war over Laos. (Some ~SEATO nations disagreed,
A04 1550  5    however.)
A04 1550  6       There was the further complication that the administration
A04 1560  8    had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to
A04 1570  7    be an ally, unlike its more determined neighbors, Thailand
A04 1580  3    and South Viet Nam.
A04 1580  7       The administration declared itself in favor of a
A04 1590  7    neutralized Laos. The pro-Western government, which
A04 1600  3    the United States had helped in a revolt against the
A04 1610  2    Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did
A04 1610  8    appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao
A04 1620 10    Army.
A04 1620 11       There certainly was not any more energy displayed
A04 1630  8    after it was clear the United States would not back
A04 1640  5    the pro-Western government to the hilt.
A04 1650  1       If the administration ever had any ideas that it
A04 1650 10    could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna
A04 1660  6    Phouma, whom it felt was too trusting of Communists,
A04 1670  5    it gradually had to relinquish them.
A04 1680  1       One factor was the statement of Senator J& W& Fulbright
A04 1680 11    (~D) of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
A04 1690  9    Committee. He declared on March 25 that the United
A04 1700  9    States had erred a year and a half ago by "encouraging
A04 1710  8    the removal" of Prince Souvanna.
A04 1730  1    _WASHINGTON_
A04 1730  2       The White House is taking extraordinary steps to
A04 1730 10    check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the
A04 1740  9    United States.
A04 1750  1       The President is deeply concerned over this problem
A04 1750  9    and its effect upon the "vitality of the nation".
A04 1760  7       In an important assertion of national leadership
A04 1770  4    in this field, he has issued an executive order establishing
A04 1780  3    the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and
A04 1790  2    Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory
A04 1800  1    Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.
A04 1800  8       The President asks the support and cooperation of
A04 1810  8    Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation
A04 1820  6    to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts
A04 1830  5    in combating this disturbing crime trend.
A04 1840  1    #OFFENSES MULTIPLY#
A04 1840  3    The President has also called upon the Attorney General,
A04 1850  2    the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and
A04 1860  1    the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts
A04 1860  9    "in the development of a program of federal leadership
A04 1870  7    to assist states and local communities in their efforts
A04 1880  5    to cope with the problem.
A04 1880 10       Simultaneously the President announced Thursday
A04 1890  5    the appointment of David L& Hackett, a special assistant
A04 1900  5    ot the Attorney General, as executive director of the
A04 1910  4    new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime.
A04 1920  2       His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the
A04 1930  1    fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more
A04 1930 10    than doubled since 1948, each year showing an increase
A04 1940  7    in offenders.
A04 1940  9       Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of
A04 1950  7    Investigation in 1959, about half for burglary and
A04 1960  5    larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.
A05 0010  1       East Providence should organize its civil defense
A05 0010  8    setup and begin by appointing a full-time director,
A05 0020  7    Raymond H& Hawksley, the present city ~CD head, believes.
A05 0030  6       Mr& Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing
A05 0040  5    to go before the city council "or anyone else locally"
A05 0050  3    to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.
A05 0060  1       East Providence now has no civil defense program.
A05 0060  9    Mr& Hawksley, the state's general treasurer, has been
A05 0070  7    a part-time ~CD director in the city for the last nine
A05 0080  9    years. He is not interested in being named a full-time
A05 0090  6    director.
A05 0090  7       Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense
A05 0100  5    Department the major responsibility for the nation's
A05 0110  3    civil defense program, Mr& Hawksley said the federal
A05 0120  1    government would pay half the salary of a full-time
A05 0120 11    local director.
A05 0130  1       He expressed the opinion the city could hire a ~CD
A05 0130 11    director for about $3,500 a year and would only have
A05 0140 10    to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis
A05 0150  5    to defray the salary costs.
A05 0150 10       Mr& Hawksley said he believed there are a number
A05 0160  8    of qualified city residents who would be willing to
A05 0170  6    take the full-time ~CD job. One of these men is former
A05 0180  4    Fire Chief John A& Laughlin, he said.
A05 0180 11       Along with a director, the city should provide a
A05 0190  9    ~CD headquarters so that pertinent information about
A05 0200  5    the local organization would be centralized. Mr& Hawksley
A05 0210  3    said.
A05 0210  4       One advantage that would come to the city in having
A05 0220  5    a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence
A05 0230  1    would become eligible to apply to the federal government
A05 0230 10    for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for
A05 0240  7    a sound civil defense program.
A05 0250  2       Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement
A05 0250 10    of such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks,
A05 0260  9    he said.
A05 0260 11       Mr& Hawksley believes that East Providence could
A05 0270  7    use two more rescue trucks, similar to the ~CD vehicle
A05 0280  7    obtained several years ago and now detailed to the
A05 0290  5    Central Fire Station.
A05 0290  8       He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the
A05 0300  8    Riverside section of the city and the other to the
A05 0310  4    Rumford area.
A05 0310  6       Speaking of the present status of civil defense
A05 0320  3    in the city, Mr& Hawksley said he would be willing
A05 0330  1    to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would
A05 0330 13    know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy
A05 0340 12    attack.
A05 0340 13       The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly
A05 0350  7    point, he said, and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would
A05 0360  5    be another. Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk
A05 0370  5    assembly point.
A05 0370  7       Mr& Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents
A05 0380  6    for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in
A05 0390  3    case of an air attack.
A05 0390  8       Such vital information, he said, has to be made
A05 0400  6    available to the public frequently and at regular intervals
A05 0410  2    for residents to know.
A05 0410  6       If the city council fails to consider appointment
A05 0420  3    of a full-time ~CD director, Mr& Hawksley said, then
A05 0430  3    he plans to call a meeting early in September so that
A05 0430 14    a civil defense organization will be developed locally.
A05 0440  8       One of the first things he would do, he said, would
A05 0450 10    be to organize classes in first aid. Other steps would
A05 0460  6    be developed after information drifts down to the local
A05 0470  4    level from the federal government.
A05 0480  1       Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales
A05 0480 10    law with possible revisions in mind.
A05 0490  4       Governor Notte said last night he plans to name
A05 0500  4    a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations
A05 0510  1    for possible changes in time for the next session of
A05 0510 11    the General Assembly.
A05 0520  2       The governor's move into the so-called "blue law"
A05 0530  2    controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary
A05 0530 13    R& Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls. A copy
A05 0540 10    was released to the press.
A05 0550  3       Mr& Notte was responding to a resolution adopted
A05 0560  1    by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent
A05 0560 12    to the state house by Miss Grant. The resolution urges
A05 0570  8    the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday
A05 0580  6    sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the
A05 0590  3    next session of the legislature.
A05 0590  8       While the city council suggested that the Legislative
A05 0600  6    Council might perform the review, Mr& Notte said that
A05 0610  5    instead he will take up the matter with Atty& Gen&
A05 0620  2    J& Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views".
A05 0630  1    He will then appoint the study committee with Mr& Nugent's
A05 0640  1    cooperation, the governor said.
A05 0640  5       "I would expect the proposed committee to hold public
A05 0650  5    hearings", Mr& Notte said, "to obtain the views of
A05 0660  4    the general public and religious, labor and special-interest
A05 0670  1    groups affected by these laws".
A05 0670  6       The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned
A05 0680  8    for some time "with the continuous problem which confronts
A05 0690  4    our local and state law enforcement officers as a result
A05 0700  4    of the laws regulating Sunday sales".
A05 0700 10       The attorney general has advised local police that
A05 0710  8    it is their duty to enforce the blue laws. Should there
A05 0720  6    be evidence they are shirking, he has said, the state
A05 0730  4    police will step into the situation.
A05 0730 10       There has been more activity across the state line
A05 0740  9    in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks
A05 0750  6    toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws. The statutes,
A05 0760  4    similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and
A05 0770  2    dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely
A05 0770 11    limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on
A05 0780 10    the Sabbath.
A05 0780 12       The Central Falls City Council expressed concern
A05 0790  7    especially that more foods be placed on the eligible
A05 0800  7    list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores
A05 0810  4    be allowed to do business on Sunday.
A05 0810 11       The only day they "have a chance to compete with
A05 0820  9    large supermarkets is on Sunday", the council's resolution
A05 0830  5    said. The small shops "must be retained, for they provide
A05 0840  6    essential service to the community", according to the
A05 0850  4    resolution, which added that they "also are the source
A05 0860  1    of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors". It declares
A05 0860 10    that Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue"
A05 0870  7    to the local government.
A05 0880  1       The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets,
A05 0890  1    factory outlets and department stores not be allowed
A05 0890  9    to do business" on Sunday. They "operate on a volume
A05 0900  8    basis", it was contended, "and are not essential to
A05 0910  6    provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of
A05 0920  4    the community".
A05 0930  1       Liberals and conservatives in both parties- Democratic
A05 0930  8    and Republican- should divorce themselves and form
A05 0940  6    two independent parties, George H& Reama, nationally
A05 0950  5    known labor-management expert, said here yesterday.
A05 0960  3       Mr& Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at
A05 0970  2    its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about
A05 0980  1    half of the people in the country want the "welfare"
A05 0980 11    type of government and the other half want a free enterprise
A05 0990  9    system. He suggested that a regrouping of forces might
A05 1000  7    allow the average voter a better pull at the right
A05 1010  4    lever for him on election day.
A05 1010 10       He said he was "confessing that I was a member of
A05 1020  7    the Socialist Party in 1910". That, he added, was when
A05 1030  6    he was "a very young man, a machinist and toolmaker
A05 1040  2    by trade.
A05 1040  4       "That was before I studied law. Some of my fellow
A05 1050  4    workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist
A05 1060  1    Party. The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me
A05 1060 11    off the Socialist track. He steered me to the right
A05 1070  8    track- the free enterprise track".
A05 1080  1       He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the
A05 1080 12    party called for government operation of all utilities
A05 1090  8    and the pooling of all resources. He suggested that
A05 1100  6    without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national
A05 1110  4    victory, most of its original program has come to pass
A05 1120  2    under both major parties.
A05 1120  6       Mr& Reama, who retired as vice president of the
A05 1130  4    American Screw Co& in 1955 said, "Both parties in the
A05 1140  3    last election told us that we need a five per cent
A05 1140 14    growth in the gross national product- but neither told
A05 1150  9    us how to achieve it".
A05 1160  1       He said he favors wage increases for workers- "but
A05 1160 10    manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze"- and
A05 1170  8    raises should only come when the public is conditioned
A05 1180  7    to higher prices, he added.
A05 1190  1       Indicating the way in which he has turned his back
A05 1190 11    on his 1910 philosophy, Mr& Reama said: "A Socialist
A05 1200  6    is a person who believes in dividing everything he
A05 1210  5    does not own". Mr& Reama, far from really being retired,
A05 1220  4    is engaged in industrial relations counseling.
A05 1230  1       A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700
A05 1230 10    Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council
A05 1240  8    last night as what is hoped will be the first step
A05 1250  6    in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.
A05 1260  1       William A& Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens
A05 1260  8    Group of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his
A05 1270  8    left hand to his right hand after the council voted
A05 1280  6    to accept them at the suggestion of Council President
A05 1290  2    Raymond Fortin Sr&.
A05 1290  5       The law which governs home rule charter petitions
A05 1300  5    states that they must be referred to the chairman of
A05 1310  3    the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures
A05 1320  1    within 10 days and Mr& Martinelli happens to hold that
A05 1320 11    post.
A05 1330  1       Mr& Martinelli explained that there should be more
A05 1330  9    than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of
A05 1340  7    a vote on the home rule charter and possible election
A05 1350  4    of a nine member charter commission within 70 days.
A05 1360  2    He explained that by law the council must establish
A05 1360 11    procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after
A05 1370 11    the board of canvassers completes its work.
A05 1380  4       A difference of opinion arose between Mr& Martinelli
A05 1390  2    and John P& Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact
A05 1400  1    manner in which the vote is handled. Mr& Martinelli
A05 1400 10    has, in recent weeks, been of the opinion that a special
A05 1410  9    town meeting would be called for the vote, while Mr&
A05 1420  6    Bourcier said that a special election might be called
A05 1430  4    instead.
A05 1430  5       Mr& Bourcier said that he had consulted several
A05 1440  2    Superior Court justices in the last week and received
A05 1450  1    opinions favoring both procedures. He assured Mr& Martinelli
A05 1450  9    and the council that he would study the correct method
A05 1460 10    and report back to the council as soon as possible.
A05 1470  7       Mr& Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens
A05 1480  4    Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further
A05 1490  3    strategy in the charter movement. He said that the
A05 1490 12    group has no candidates for the charter commission
A05 1500  8    in mind at present, but that it will undoubtedly endorse
A05 1510  6    candidates when the time comes.
A05 1520  1       "After inspiring this, I think we should certainly
A05 1520  9    follow through on it", he declared. "It has become
A05 1530  8    our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group
A05 1540  6    will spearhead the movement".
A05 1550  1       He said he would not be surprised if some of the
A05 1550 11    more than 30 members of the group are interested in
A05 1560  7    running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts
A05 1570  4    on the charter commission.
A05 1570  8       "Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness
A05 1580  7    of the movement", he indicated, "and to tell them what
A05 1590  6    this will mean for the town". He expects that if the
A05 1600  4    present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled
A05 1610  1    during the last week in September.
A05 1610  7       Some opposition to the home rule movement started
A05 1620  4    to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the town's
A05 1630  2    insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against
A05 1630  8    the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal
A05 1640  9    league charter. Increasing opposition can be expected
A05 1650  6    in coming weeks, it was indicated.
A05 1660  1       Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule
A05 1660 10    charter was cited as a factor which has caused the
A05 1670 10    Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were
A05 1680  5    termed "false pretenses". Several signers affixed their
A05 1690  3    names, it was learned, after being told that no tax
A05 1700  1    increase would be possible without consent of the General
A05 1700 10    Assembly and that a provision could be included in
A05 1710  9    the charter to have the town take over the Johnston
A05 1720  5    Sanitary District sewer system.
A05 1730  1       Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who
A05 1730  9    plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines
A05 1740  8    at the local police station may be taken at Monday's
A05 1750  5    special North Providence Town Council meeting.
A05 1760  1       Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday
A05 1770  1    he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor
A05 1770 11    Michael A& Abatuno to draft the ordinance.
A05 1780  6       At the last session of the General Assembly, the
A05 1790  4    town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a
A05 1800  3    means of making enforcement of minor offenses more
A05 1800 11    effective. Nothing has been done yet to take advantage
A05 1810  9    of the enabling legislation.
A05 1820  1       At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District
A05 1830  1    Court for disposition. Local police have hesitated
A05 1830  8    to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs
A05 1840  7    involved even for the simplest offense.
A06 0010  1    _PLAINFIELD_
A06 0010  1       - James P& Mitchell and Sen& Walter H& Jones ~R-Bergen,
A06 0020  3    last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign
A06 0030  1    issue a remark by Richard J& Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial
A06 0040  1    candidate, that the ~GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass
A06 0050  1    of Eisenhower Republicanism".
A06 0050  4       Mitchell was for using it, Jones against, and Sen&
A06 0060  4    Wayne Dumont Jr& ~R-Warren did not mention it when
A06 0070  4    the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke
A06 0080  1    at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park
A06 0080 10    Hotel.
A06 0090  1       The controversial remark was first made Sunday by
A06 0090  8    Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail
A06 0100  5    party at the Scotch Plains Country Club. It was greeted
A06 0110  6    with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday
A06 0120  3    at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.
A06 0130  1       Hughes said Monday, "It is the apparent intention
A06 0130  9    of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass
A06 0140  9    of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism, but the
A06 0150  4    heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after
A06 0160  3    Eisenhower retired. Now he's gone, the Republican Party
A06 0170  2    is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains
A06 0170 13    to the people of the state". Sunday he had added, "We
A06 0180 10    can love Eisenhower the man, even if we considered
A06 0190  7    him a mediocre president **h but there is nothing left
A06 0200  5    of the Republican Party without his leadership".
A06 0210  1       Mitchell said the statement should become a major
A06 0210  9    issue in the primary and the fall campaign. "How can
A06 0220 10    a man with any degree of common decency charge this"?
A06 0230  6    he asked. The former secretary of labor said he was
A06 0240  6    proud to be an Eisenhower Republican "and proud to
A06 0250  2    have absorbed his philosophy" while working in his
A06 0250 10    adminstration.
A06 0260  1       Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last
A06 0260 10    fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower
A06 0270  8    Republicanism was a dead issue.
A06 0280  5    #REGRETS ATTACK#
A06 0280  7    Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal
A06 0290  5    attack on a past president. "He is wrong to inject
A06 0300  2    Eisenhower into this campaign", he said, "because the
A06 0300 10    primary is being waged on state issues and I will not
A06 0310 11    be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign".
A06 0320  5       The audience last night did not respond with either
A06 0330  5    applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.
A06 0340  1       Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary.
A06 0340 11    He then launched into what the issues should be in
A06 0350 10    the campaign. State aid to schools, the continuance
A06 0360  6    of railroad passenger service, the proper uses of surplus
A06 0370  4    funds of the Port of New York Authority, and making
A06 0380  2    New Jersey attractive to new industry.
A06 0380  8    #DECRIES JOBLESSNESS#
A06 0390  1    Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the
A06 0390 10    state and said the Meyner administration and the
A06 0400  6    Republican-controlled
A06 0400  8    State Senate "Must share the blame for this". Nothing
A06 0410  8    that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co&
A06 0420  9    plant, he said industry will not come into this state
A06 0430  6    until there is tax reform.
A06 0430 11       "But I am not in favor of a sales or state income
A06 0440 12    tax at this time", Mitchell said.
A06 0450  2       Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited
A06 0450  9    to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions,
A06 0460 10    saved his barbs for Mitchell. He said Mitchell is against
A06 0470  8    the centralization of government in Washington but
A06 0480  4    looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet
A06 0490  4    New Jersey school and transportation crises.
A06 0490 10       "He calls for help while saying he is against centralization,
A06 0500 10    but you can't have it both ways", Jones said. The state
A06 0510 10    is now faced with the immediate question of raising
A06 0520  6    new taxes whether on utilities, real estate or motor
A06 0530  4    vehicles, he said, "and I challenge Mitchell to tell
A06 0540  2    the people where he stands on the tax issue".
A06 0540 11    #DEFENDS IKE#
A06 0550  1    Earlier, Mitchell said in a statement:
A06 0550  7       "I think that all Americans will resent deeply the
A06 0560  6    statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard
A06 0570  4    J& Hughes. His reference to 'discredited carcass' or
A06 0580  3    'tattered remains' of the president's leadership is
A06 0590  2    an insult to the man who led our forces to victory
A06 0590 13    in the greatest war in all history, to the man who
A06 0600  9    was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people
A06 0610  4    as president of the United States, and who has been
A06 0620  2    the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions
A06 0620 12    of the free nations.
A06 0630  2       "I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking
A06 0640  1    a position in public life could demonstrate such poor
A06 0640 10    judgment and bad taste.
A06 0650  3       "Such a vicious statement can only have its origin
A06 0660  1    in the desire of a new political candidate to try to
A06 0660 12    make his name known by condemning a man of world stature.
A06 0670  8    It can only rebound to Mr& Hughes' discredit".
A06 0680  3    #SEES JONES AHEAD#
A06 0680  6    Sen& Charles W& Sandman, ~R-Cape May, said today Jones
A06 0690  8    will run well ahead of his ~GOP opponents for the gubernatorial
A06 0700  8    nomination. Sandman, state campaign chairman for Jones,
A06 0710  6    was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel,
A06 0720  4    Newark, of Essex County leaders and campaign managers
A06 0730  2    for Jones.
A06 0730  4       Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers
A06 0740  3    on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones
A06 0750  1    will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with
A06 0750  9    the largest majority given a candidate in recent years.
A06 0760  7       Sandman said: "The announcement that Sen& Clifford
A06 0770  5    Case ~R-N&J&, has decided to spend all his available
A06 0780  6    time campaigning for Mr& Mitchell is a dead giveaway.
A06 0790  5    It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate
A06 0800  1    who has proven he cannot answer any questions about
A06 0800 10    New Jersey's problems.
A06 0810  2       "We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to
A06 0820  2    project Mr& Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate
A06 0820 12    from Washington. That failed.
A06 0830  4       "We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to
A06 0840  4    Mr& Mitchell some of the glow of Sen& Case's candidacy
A06 0850  2    of last year. That, too, will fail".
A06 0850  9       Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs& Harriet
A06 0860  6    Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave&, Westfield,
A06 0870  4    as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones
A06 0880  4    Committee.
A06 0880  5       Mrs& Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's
A06 0890  5    Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman.
A06 0910  1       County Supervisor Weldon R& Sheets, who is a candidate
A06 0910 10    for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today
A06 0920  6    called for an end to paper ballots in those counties
A06 0930  6    in the state which still use them. The proposal, Sheets
A06 0940  3    said, represents part of his program for election reforms
A06 0950  2    necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than
A06 0950 11    a "lip service word".
A06 0960  3       Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state
A06 0970  2    financing aid for the purchase of voting machines,
A06 0970 10    enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year
A06 0980 10    period without interest or charge. Sheets added that
A06 0990  4    he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in
A06 1000  2    the state by January, 1964.
A06 1000  7       Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation
A06 1010  4    impinging on home rule is basically distasteful, he
A06 1020  2    added that the vital interest in election results transcended
A06 1030  1    county lines.
A06 1040  1       The candidacy of Mayor James J& Sheeran of West
A06 1040 10    Orange, for the Republican nomination for sheriff of
A06 1060  2    Essex County, was supported today by Edward W& Roos,
A06 1070  6    West Orange public safety commissioner.
A06 1080  1       Sheeran, a lawyer and former ~FBI man is running
A06 1090  1    against the Republican organization's candidate, Freeholder
A06 1090  7    William MacDonald, for the vacancy left by the resignation
A06 1100  9    of Neil Duffy, now a member of the State Board of Tax
A06 1110 10    Appeals.
A06 1110 11       "My experience as public safety commissioner", Roos
A06 1120  7    said, "has shown me that the office of sheriff is best
A06 1130  9    filled by a man with law enforcement experience, and
A06 1140  3    preferably one who is a lawyer. Jim Sheeran fits that
A06 1150  2    description".
A06 1160  1    _TRENTON_
A06 1160  1       - William J& Seidel, state fire warden in the Department
A06 1170  1    of Conservation and Economic Development, has retired
A06 1170  8    after 36 years of service.
A06 1180  5       A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore
A06 1190  2    A& Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction
A06 1200  1    in the number of forest fires in the state.
A06 1200 10       Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division
A06 1210  7    fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University
A06 1220  4    of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment
A06 1230  1    with private lumber companies. In October 1944, he
A06 1230  9    was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest
A06 1240  8    Fire Section.
A06 1240 10       Under his supervision, the state fire-fighting agency
A06 1250  8    developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines
A06 1260  6    and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor
A06 1270  3    units for fire fighting.
A06 1270  7       He also expanded and modernized the radio system
A06 1280  4    with a central control station. He introduced regular
A06 1290  2    briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first
A06 1290 10    aid training for section wardens. He is credited with
A06 1300  8    setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program
A06 1310  6    in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department
A06 1320  4    of Education.
A06 1330  1    _BOONTON_
A06 1330  1       - Richard J& Hughes made his Morris County debut
A06 1340  1    in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination
A06 1340  9    here last night with a pledge "to carry the issues
A06 1350  8    to every corner of the state".
A06 1360  1       He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee
A06 1360  8    members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn: "When
A06 1370  9    I come back here after the November election you'll
A06 1380  6    think, 'You're my man- you're the kind of governor
A06 1390  6    we're glad we elected'".
A06 1390 10       He said, "We Democrats must resolve our issues on
A06 1400  9    the test of what is right and just, and not what is
A06 1410  9    expedient at the time".
A06 1410 13    #ATTACKS REPUBLICANS#
A06 1420  2    In his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said,
A06 1430  1    "The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping
A06 1430  9    over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary.
A06 1440 10    But we'll have a liberal, well planned, forward looking,
A06 1450  7    honest platform. We'll not talk out of one side of
A06 1460  7    our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side
A06 1470  3    in Hudson.
A06 1470  5       "We'll take the truth to the people, and the people
A06 1480  4    will like the truth and elect their candidate and party
A06 1490  1    in November".
A06 1490  3       He said, "You can see signs of the Republicans'
A06 1500  1    feeble attack on the Meyner administration. But I shall
A06 1510  1    campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of
A06 1510 11    the years ahead".
A06 1520  1       He urged New Jersey to "become a full partner in
A06 1520 11    the courageous actions of President Kennedy". He called
A06 1530  7    for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to
A06 1540  8    the piracy of industry by Southern states, and a strong
A06 1550  5    fight against discrimination in business and industry.
A06 1560  2       "We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean",
A06 1570  1    the former Superior Court judge said. "To prevent hoodlums
A06 1580  1    from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican
A06 1580 11    administration in the early 1940s".
A06 1590  5       Calling the Democrats the "party that lives, breathes
A06 1600  4    and thinks for the good of the people", Hughes asked,
A06 1610  2    "a representative Democratic vote in the primary for
A06 1610 10    a springboard toward victory in November".
A06 1620  5       Hughes supported Gov& Meyner's "Green Acres" plan
A06 1630  5    for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush
A06 1640  5    of urban development. He said legislation for a $60
A06 1650  3    million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected
A06 1650 12    to be introduced Monday.
A06 1660  3    #CONSERVATION PLAN#
A06 1660  5    The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open
A06 1670  6    land by the state. The other $15 million is to be alloted
A06 1680  5    to municipalities on a matching fund basis.
A06 1690  1       Hughes said, "This is not a plan to conquer space-
A06 1690 10    but to conserve it", pointing out the state population
A06 1700  7    has increased 125,000 each year since 1950. He said
A06 1710  6    "Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps
A06 1720  3    are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be
A06 1720 13    no land left to preserve".
A06 1730  4       Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other
A06 1740  3    issues in which the Republican candidates are involved.
A06 1740 11    He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued
A06 1750 12    that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the
A06 1760 10    Republicans. "After the primary", he promised, "I'll
A06 1770  5    be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong,
A06 1780  5    dynamic administration. I'm not afraid to tangle with
A06 1790  2    the Republican nominee".
A06 1800  1    _TRENTON_
A06 1800  1       - Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee
A06 1810  1    who are retiring- voluntarily- this year were honored
A06 1810  9    yesterday by their colleagues.
A06 1820  3       The outgoing members, whose four-year terms will
A06 1830  2    expire a week after the April 18 primary election,
A06 1830 11    received carved wooden elephants, complete with ivory
A06 1840  6    tusks, to remember the state committee by.
A06 1850  3       There may be other 1961 state committee retirements
A06 1860  1    come April 18, but they will be leaving by choice of
A06 1860 12    the Republican voters.
A06 1870  2       A special presentation was made to Mrs& Geraldine
A06 1880  1    Thompson of Red Bank, who is stepping down after 35
A06 1880 11    years on the committee. She also was the original ~GOP
A06 1890  9    national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early
A06 1900  7    1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment.
A06 1910  3    She served one four-year term on the national committee.
A07 0010  1       Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic
A07 0010  7    district leaders and some county leaders at reports
A07 0020  7    that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term
A07 0030  6    with Paul R& Screvane and Abraham D& Beame as running
A07 0040  3    mates.
A07 0040  4       At the same time reaction among anti-organization
A07 0050  1    Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the
A07 0050 10    Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable.
A07 0060  6       Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program
A07 0070  6    an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within
A07 0080  3    the Democratic party that has been going on for the
A07 0090  1    last three years.
A07 0090  4       The resentment among Democratic organization leaders
A07 0100  2    to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly
A07 0100 10    at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates
A07 0110 10    without consulting the leaders. Some viewed this attempt
A07 0120  7    as evidence that Mr& Wagner regarded himself as bigger
A07 0130  5    than the party.
A07 0130  8    #OPPOSITION REPORTED#
A07 0140  1    Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported
A07 0140  9    trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of
A07 0150  7    Brooklyn to oppose Mr& Wagner for the Mayoral nomination
A07 0160  6    in the Sept& 7 Democratic primary.
A07 0170  2       These contend there is a serious question as to
A07 0170 11    whether Mr& Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic
A07 0180  9    rank and file in the city. Their view is that last-minute
A07 0190 10    changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic
A07 0200  6    ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance
A07 0210  3    as Mayor.
A07 0210  5       In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary
A07 0220  5    slate, Mr& Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with
A07 0230  2    Representative Charles A& Buckley, the Bronx Democratic
A07 0240  1    leader, and with Joseph T& Sharkey, the Brooklyn Democratic
A07 0250  1    leader.
A07 0250  2    #MAYOR VISITS BUCKLEY#
A07 0250  5    As usual, he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine
A07 0260  5    G& De Sapio, the Manhattan leader. He is publicly on
A07 0270  4    record as believing Mr& De Sapio should be replaced
A07 0280  1    for the good of the party.
A07 0280  7       Last night the Mayor visited Mr& Buckley at the
A07 0290  4    Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation.
A07 0300  1    Apparently he believes Mr& Buckley holds the key to
A07 0300 10    the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices
A07 0310  6    for running mates without a struggle.
A07 0320  4       In talks with Mr& Buckley last week in Washington,
A07 0330  3    the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent
A07 0340  1    to dropping Controller Lawrence E& Gerosa, who lives
A07 0340  9    in the Bronx, from this year's ticket. But Mr& Buckley
A07 0350  9    seems to have assumed he would be given the right to
A07 0360  9    pick Mr& Gerosa's successor.
A07 0370  1    #SCREVANE AND BEAME HAILED#
A07 0370  5    The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters
A07 0380  3    yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had
A07 0390  2    decided to run and wanted Mr& Screvane, who lives in
A07 0390 12    Queens, to replace Abe Stark, the incumbent, as the
A07 0400  9    candidate for President of the City Council and Mr&
A07 0410  7    Beame, who lives in Brooklyn, to replace Mr& Gerosa
A07 0420  4    as the candidate for Controller.
A07 0420  9       The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties
A07 0430  9    Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx. After
A07 0440  7    his speech, reporters asked him about the report of
A07 0450  6    his political intentions, published in yesterday's
A07 0460  1    New York Times. The Mayor said:
A07 0460  7       "It didn't come from me. But as I have said before,
A07 0470 10    if I announce my candidacy, I will have something definite
A07 0480  6    to say about running mates".
A07 0490  1    _BOSTON, JUNE 16_
A07 0490  4       - A wave of public resentment against corruption
A07 0500  1    in government is rising in Massachusetts.
A07 0500  7       There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion
A07 0510  7    toward politics. The taxi driver taking the visitor
A07 0520  4    from the airport remarks that politicians in the state
A07 0530  1    are "all the same".
A07 0530  5       "It's 'See Joe, see Jim'", he says. "The hand is
A07 0540  6    out".
A07 0540  7       A political scientist writes of the growth of "alienated
A07 0550  6    voters", who "believe that voting is useless because
A07 0560  4    politicians or those who influence politicians are
A07 0570  1    corrupt, selfish and beyond popular control. **h These
A07 0570  9    voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy,
A07 0580  7    the object of which is to plunder them".
A07 0590  3       Corruption is hardly a recent development in the
A07 0600  2    city and state that were widely identified as the locale
A07 0600 12    of Edwin O'Connor's novel, "The Last Hurrah". But there
A07 0610  8    are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject.
A07 0620  8       A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused
A07 0630  6    the public within the last year. Graft in the construction
A07 0640  5    of highways and other public works has brought on state
A07 0650  3    and Federal investigations. And the election of President
A07 0660  1    Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical
A07 0660  9    climate of his home state.
A07 0670  4       A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape
A07 0680  2    the impression that petty chicanery, or worse, is the
A07 0680 11    norm in Massachusetts public life. Day after day some
A07 0690  7    new episode is reported.
A07 0700  1       The state Public Works Department is accused of
A07 0700  9    having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a
A07 0710  9    state judge on his waterfront property. An assistant
A07 0720  4    attorney general is directed to investigate.
A07 0730  1    _WASHINGTON, JUNE 18_
A07 0730  4       - Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply
A07 0740  2    contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.
A07 0740  8       In the Senate, several bills are expected to pass
A07 0750  8    without any major conflict or opposition. In the House,
A07 0760  6    the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make
A07 0770  4    another major stand in opposition to the Administration's
A07 0780  1    housing bill, while more jockeying is expected in an
A07 0780 10    attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill.
A07 0790  8       The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee.
A07 0800  6    It is expected to be reported out Tuesday, but this
A07 0810  3    is a little uncertain.
A07 0810  7       The panel's action depends on the return of Representative
A07 0820  6    James W& Trimble, Democrat of Arkansas, who has been
A07 0830  6    siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules
A07 0840  4    Committee in moving bills to the floor. Mr& Trimble
A07 0850  1    has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday.
A07 0850 11    #LEADERSHIP IS HOPEFUL#
A07 0860  3    The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition
A07 0870  2    by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative
A07 0880  1    Republicans. The Democratic leadership, however, hopes
A07 0880  7    to pass it sometime this week.
A07 0890  4       The $6,100,000,000 measure, which was passed last
A07 0900  2    Monday by the Senate, provides for forty-year mortgages
A07 0900 11    at low down-payments for moderate-income families.
A07 0910  7    It also provides for funds to clear slums and help
A07 0920  6    colleges build dormitories.
A07 0920  9       The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled
A07 0930  7    in the Rules Committee, where two Northern Democratic
A07 0940  5    members who usually vote with the Administration are
A07 0950  3    balking because of the religious controversy. They
A07 0960  1    are James J& Delaney of Queens and Thomas P& O'Neill
A07 0960 11    Jr& of Massachusetts.
A07 0970  3    #THREE GROUPS TO MEET#
A07 0970  7    What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress
A07 0980  8    on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act
A07 0990  4    of 1958. This would provide for long-term Federal loans
A07 1000  3    for construction of parochial and other private-school
A07 1010  1    facilities for teaching science, languages and mathematics.
A07 1020  1       Mr& Delaney and Mr& O'Neill are not willing to vote
A07 1020 11    on the public-school measure until the defense education
A07 1030  8    bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee.
A07 1050  1       About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned
A07 1050  9    to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious
A07 1060  8    groups, according to an official of the corps.
A07 1070  4       In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted
A07 1080  1    for Congressional approval, $26,000,000 would be spent
A07 1080  8    through universities and private voluntary agencies.
A07 1090  6       Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at
A07 1100  7    the contract-negotiation stage, Gordon Boyce, director
A07 1110  3    of relations with the voluntary agencies, said in a
A07 1120  2    Washington interview. Six of these were proposed by
A07 1120 10    religious groups. They will be for teaching, agriculture
A07 1130  7    and community development in Southeast Asia, Africa,
A07 1140  5    the Middle East and Latin America.
A07 1150  1    #QUESTION RAISED#
A07 1150  3    Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed
A07 1160  1    that this development has raised the question whether
A07 1160  9    the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for
A07 1170  9    church and state over methods, means and goals.
A07 1180  5       There are a number of ways this could happen, the
A07 1190  3    churchmen pointed out, and here is an example:
A07 1200  1       Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered
A07 1200  9    when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate
A07 1210 10    had been doubled. When he protested, the hotel owner
A07 1220  4    said:
A07 1220  5       "Why do you worry? The U& S& Government is paying
A07 1225  6    for it. The U& S& Government pays for all its overseas
A07 1230  6    workers".
A07 1230  7    #MISSIONARY EXPLAINS#
A07 1240  2    "I don't work for the Government", the American said.
A07 1250  2    "I'm a missionary".
A07 1250  5       The hotel owner shrugged. "Same thing", he said.
A07 1260  5       And then, some churchmen remarked, there is a more
A07 1270  5    classical church-state problem:
A07 1270  9       Can religious agencies use Government funds and
A07 1280  6    Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve
A07 1290  5    the constitutional requirement on separation of church
A07 1300  3    and state?
A07 1300  5       R& Sargent Shriver Jr&, director of the corps, is
A07 1310  5    certain that they can. No religious group, he declared
A07 1320  2    in an interview, will receive Peace Corps funds unless
A07 1320 11    it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes.
A07 1340  1    _MOSCOW, JUNE 18_
A07 1340  4       - At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno
A07 1350  2    of Indonesia, Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets
A07 1360  1    and said, beaming: "Look, he took everything I had"!
A07 1370  1       Mr& Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood
A07 1370  9    of the successful banker. Indonesia is one of the twenty
A07 1380  8    under-developed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin
A07 1390  5    America that are receiving Soviet aid.
A07 1400  1       The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist
A07 1400 10    bloc are rapidly expanding their economic, technical
A07 1410  5    and military assistance to the uncommitted nations.
A07 1420  4       The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000
A07 1430  3    in economic aid alone last year, according to Western
A07 1440  1    estimates. This was the biggest annual outlay since
A07 1440  9    the Communist program for the under-developed countries
A07 1450  7    made its modest beginning in 1954. In 1960 more than
A07 1460  7    6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries.
A07 1480  1    _UNITED NATIONS, N& Y&, JUNE 18_
A07 1480  7       - A committee of experts has recommended that a
A07 1490  4    country's population be considered in the distribution
A07 1500  1    of professional posts at the United Nations. This was
A07 1500 10    disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified
A07 1510  8    efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role
A07 1520  7    in the staff and operation of the United Nations.
A07 1530  2       One effect of the proposal, which puts a premium
A07 1540  1    on population instead of economic strength, as in the
A07 1540 10    past, would be to take jobs from European nations and
A07 1550  9    give more to such countries as India. India is the
A07 1560  6    most populous United Nations member with more than
A07 1570  2    400,000,000 inhabitants.
A07 1570  4       The new formula for filling staff positions in the
A07 1580  5    Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made
A07 1590  2    by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report.
A07 1590 13    The report was completed after nearly eighteen months
A07 1600  7    of work on the question of the organization of the
A07 1610  5    United Nations.
A07 1610  7    #FORMULA IS DUE THIS WEEK#
A07 1620  1    The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
A07 1620  8    Questions is expected to receive the report this week.
A07 1630  9    The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines:
A07 1640  6    _@_
A07 1640  7       Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would
A07 1650  5    get two professional posts, such as political affairs
A07 1660  3    officer, a department head or an economist, to start.
A07 1670  1    #@#
A07 1670  2    Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000
A07 1670 11    people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or
A07 1680  9    a maximum of fifteen posts.
A07 1690  1    #@#
A07 1690  2    Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would
A07 1700  1    get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000
A07 1700  9    people up to an unspecified cut-off point.
A07 1720  1    _GENEVA, JUNE 18_
A07 1720  4       - The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin
A07 1730  1    negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government
A07 1730  8    that would unite the war-ridden kingdom.
A07 1740  6       The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum,
A07 1750  5    Premier of the pro-Western royal Government; Prince
A07 1760  2    Souvanna Phouma, leader of the nation's neutralists
A07 1770  1    and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc, and
A07 1770 10    Prince Souphanouvong, head of the pro-Communist Pathet
A07 1780  7    Lao forces. The latter two are half-brothers.
A07 1785  5       Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western
A07 1790  8    delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth
A07 1800  4    plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on
A07 1810  2    the future of Laos. An agreement among the Princes
A07 1810 11    on a coalition government would ease their task, diplomats
A07 1820  7    conceded. But no one was overly optimistic.
A07 1830  5    #TACTICS STUDIED IN GENEVA#
A07 1830  9    W& Averell Harriman of the United States, Malcolm MacDonald
A07 1840  8    of Britain, Maurice Couve de Murville, France's Foreign
A07 1860  7    Minister, and Howard C& Green, Canada's Minister of
A07 1870  6    External Affairs, concluded, meanwhile, a round of
A07 1880  5    consultations here on future tactics in the conference.
A07 1890  2    The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing
A07 1890 12    week.
A07 1900  1       Princess Moune, Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter,
A07 1910  1    read the Princes' statement. They had a two-hour luncheon
A07 1910 11    together in "an atmosphere of cordial understanding
A07 1920  7    and relaxation", she said.
A07 1930  2       The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda
A07 1930 11    for their talks, which are to last three days.
A07 1940  9       The Princess said it was too early to say what would
A07 1950  9    be decided if no agreement was reached after three
A07 1960  3    days.
A07 1960  4    #TO DEAL WITH PRINCIPLES#
A07 1960  8    The meetings in Zurich, the statement said, would deal
A07 1970  7    only with principles that would guide the three factors
A07 1980  5    in their search for a coalition Government.
A08 0010  1       Appointment of William S& Pfaff Jr&, 41, as promotion
A08 0015  1    manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was
A08 0020  8    announced Saturday by John F& Tims, president of the
A08 0030  8    company.
A08 0030  9       Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke, who resigned.
A08 0040  5       The new promotion manager has been employed by the
A08 0050  6    company since January, 1946, as a commercial artist
A08 0060  2    in the advertising department.
A08 0060  6       He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen
A08 0070  5    Elementary school, Fortier High school and Soule business
A08 0090  1    college.
A08 0090  2       From June, 1942, until December, 1945, Pfaff served
A08 0100  4    in the Army Air Corps. While in the service he attended
A08 0110  3    radio school at Scott Field in Belleville, Ill&.
A08 0120  1       Before entering the service, Pfaff for five years
A08 0120  9    did clerical work with a general merchandising and
A08 0130  7    wholesale firm in New Orleans.
A08 0140  1       He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has
A08 0140 11    a daughter, Karol, 13. They reside at 4911 Miles dr&.
A08 0160  1    _WASHINGTON_
A08 0160  1       - Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected
A08 0170  1    along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the
A08 0170  9    White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan& 20.
A08 0180  9       Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day,
A08 0190  7    hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this
A08 0200  5    thoroughfare as President John F& Kennedy and retiring
A08 0210  3    President Dwight D& Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following
A08 0220  2    the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic
A08 0220 11    ceremonial route.
A08 0230  2       Pennsylvania Avenue, named for one of the original
A08 0240  1    13 states, perhaps is not the most impressive street
A08 0240 10    in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint.
A08 0250  7    But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it.
A08 0260  5    #MANY BUILDINGS#
A08 0260  7    Within view of the avenue are some of the United States
A08 0270  8    government's tremendous buildings, plus shrines and
A08 0280  4    monuments. Of course, 1600 Pennsylvania, the White
A08 0290  2    House, is the most famous address of the free world.
A08 0300  1       Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania
A08 0300 10    Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue, begins
A08 0310  6    a series of great federal buildings, some a block long
A08 0320  6    and all about seven-stories high.
A08 0330  1       Great chapters of history have been recorded along
A08 0330  9    the avenue, now about 169 years old. In the early spring
A08 0340  9    of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to
A08 0350  5    watch 5000 women parade. They were the suffragettes
A08 0360  1    and they wanted to vote. In the 1920 presidential election
A08 0370  1    they had that right and many of them did vote for the
A08 0370 13    first time.
A08 0380  1    #SEATS ON SQUARE#
A08 0380  3    Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from
A08 0390  1    the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the
A08 0390 11    National Archives building where hundreds of thousands
A08 0400  6    of this country's most valuable records are kept. Also
A08 0410  5    the department of justice building is located where
A08 0420  3    J& Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of
A08 0430  1    investigation.
A08 0430  2       Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania,
A08 0440  1    powered with lines that are underground.
A08 0440  7       Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage
A08 0450  7    points bordering Lafayette Square, opposite the White
A08 0460  4    House. In this historic square are several statutes,
A08 0470  2    but the one that stands out over the others is that
A08 0470 13    of Gen& Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans.
A08 0490  1       Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette
A08 0490  8    Square will be at least 40 marching units. About 16,000
A08 0500  9    military members of all branches of the armed forces
A08 0510  6    will take part in the parade.
A08 0510 12       Division one of the parade will be the service academies.
A08 0520 10    Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts
A08 0530  6    and Texas, the respective states of the President and
A08 0540  6    of Vice-President L& B& Johnson. Then will come nine
A08 0550  5    other states in the order of their admission to the
A08 0560  3    union.
A08 0560  4       Division three will be headed by the Marines followed
A08 0570  2    by 12 states; division four will be headed by the Navy,
A08 0580  1    followed by 11 states; division five, by the Air Force
A08 0580 11    followed by 11 states. Division six will be headed
A08 0590  8    by the Coast Guard, followed by the reserve forces
A08 0600  5    of all services, five states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
A08 0610  2    Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the trust territories
A08 0610  9    and the Canal Zone.
A08 0630  1    _JACKSON, MISS&_
A08 0630  3       - What does 1961 offer in political and governmental
A08 0640  1    developments in Mississippi?
A08 0640  4       Even for those who have been observing the political
A08 0650  5    scene a long time, no script from the past is worth
A08 0660  3    very much in gazing into the state's immediate political
A08 0670  1    future.
A08 0670  2       This is largely because of the unpredictability
A08 0670  9    of the man who operates the helm of the state government
A08 0680 10    and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants-
A08 0690  7    Gov& Ross Barnett.
A08 0700  1       Barnett, who came into office with no previous experience
A08 0700 10    in public administration, has surrounded himself with
A08 0710  6    confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but
A08 0720  6    his friends as well.
A08 0720 10       Consequently, it is uncertain after nearly 12 months
A08 0730  8    in office just which direction the Barnett administration
A08 0740  4    will take in the coming year.
A08 0740 10    #COULD BE SCRAMBLE#
A08 0750  3    Some predict the administration will settle down during
A08 0760  1    1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had
A08 0760 12    thus far.
A08 0770  1       The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus
A08 0770  9    far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others
A08 0780  7    who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at
A08 0790  4    some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's
A08 0800  1    office.
A08 0800  2       There are many who predict that should Barnett decide
A08 0810  1    to call the Legislature back into special session,
A08 0810  9    it will really throw his administration into a scramble.
A08 0820  7       Certainly nobody will predict that the next time
A08 0830  7    the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able
A08 0840  4    to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful
A08 0850  1    "honeymoon" he had in the 1960 legislative session.
A08 0850  9       If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961,
A08 0860  8    it will be the first year in the last decade that the
A08 0870  8    Legislature has not met in regular or special session.
A08 0880  3       The odds favor a special session, more than likely
A08 0890  2    early in the year.
A08 0890  6    #DISTRICTS ISSUE#
A08 0890  8    Legislators always get restless for a special session
A08 0900  6    (whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem
A08 0910  4    is not certain) and if they start agitating. Barnett
A08 0920  1    is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.
A08 0920 11       The issue which may make it necessary to have a
A08 0930  9    session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting
A08 0940  4    the state's congressional districts from six to five
A08 0950  3    to eliminate one congressional seat.
A08 0950  8       With eyes focused on the third congressional district,
A08 0960  6    the historic Delta district, and Congressman Frank
A08 0970  3    E& Smith as the one most likely to go, the redistricting
A08 0980  1    battle will put to a test the longstanding power which
A08 0980 11    lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature.
A08 0990  9       Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic
A08 1000  6    party will be at a crossroads during 1961, with the
A08 1010  5    first Democratic president in eight years in the White
A08 1020  4    House.
A08 1020  5       Split badly during the recent presidential election
A08 1030  2    into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists
A08 1030 10    and independents, the Democratic party in Mississippi
A08 1040  7    is currently a wreck. And there has been no effort
A08 1050  7    since the election to pull it back together.
A08 1060  1    #FUTURE CLOUDED#
A08 1060  3    Barnett, as the titular head of the Democratic party,
A08 1070  2    apparently must make the move to reestablish relations
A08 1080  1    with the national Democratic party or see a movement
A08 1080 10    come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him
A08 1090  6    as a party functionary.
A08 1100  1       With a Democratic administration, party patronage
A08 1100  7    would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had
A08 1110  8    held its Democratic solidarity in the November election.
A08 1120  5       Now, the picture is clouded, and even ~US Sens&
A08 1130  3    James O& Eastland and John C& Stennis, who remained
A08 1140  2    loyal to the ticket, are uncertain of their status.
A08 1150  1       Reports are that it is more than probability that
A08 1150  9    the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support
A08 1160  7    the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage
A08 1170  5    which flows to congressmen.
A08 1180  1    _BATON ROUGE, LA&_
A08 1180  4       - The Gov& Jimmie H& Davis administration appears
A08 1190  2    to face a difficult year in 1961, with the governor's
A08 1200  1    theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.
A08 1200 10       The year will probably start out with segregation
A08 1210  8    still the most troublesome issue. But it might give
A08 1220  6    way shortly to another vexing issue- that of finances
A08 1230  4    in state government.
A08 1230  7       The transition from segregation to finances might
A08 1240  4    already be in progress, in the form of an administration
A08 1250  1    proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent
A08 1250 12    to 3 per cent.
A08 1260  3       The administration has said the sales tax proposal
A08 1270  1    is merely part of the segregation strategy, since the
A08 1270 10    revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a
A08 1280  7    grant in aid program.
A08 1280 11       But the tardiness of the administration in making
A08 1290  7    the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the
A08 1300  5    tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage
A08 1310  2    of cash than to segregation.
A08 1310  7    #LEGISLATORS WEARY#
A08 1310  9    Indeed, the administration's curious position on the
A08 1320  7    sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its
A08 1330  8    defeat. The administration could not say why $28 million
A08 1340  6    was needed for a grant-in-aid program.
A08 1350  1       The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up
A08 1350  9    some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales
A08 1360  5    tax bill may play a part in determining whether it
A08 1370  3    can muster the required two-thirds vote.
A08 1370 10       The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday
A08 1380  9    in the House when the Legislature reconvenes.
A08 1390  4       Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect
A08 1400  4    a transition from special sessions of the Legislature
A08 1410  1    to normalcy.
A08 1410  3       If it fails to pass, he can throw up his hands and
A08 1420  1    say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts
A08 1420 11    to prevent integration. He could terminate special
A08 1430  6    sessions of the Legislature.
A08 1435  1       Actually, Davis would have to toss in the towel
A08 1440  9    soon anyway. Many legislators are already weary and
A08 1450  7    frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token
A08 1460  5    integration.
A08 1460  6       This is not the sort of thing most politicos would
A08 1470  6    care to acknowledge publicly. They would like to convey
A08 1480  4    the notion something is being done, even though it
A08 1480 13    is something they know to be ineffectual.
A08 1490  7    #UNDERLYING CONCERN#
A08 1490  9    Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis
A08 1500 10    the means to effect a transition. He could tell the
A08 1510  7    Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry
A08 1520  5    on the battle.
A08 1520  8       Then he could tell them to go home, while the administration
A08 1530  6    continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in
A08 1540  5    extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in
A08 1550  1    over an eight months period.
A08 1550  6       It is difficult to be certain how the administration
A08 1560  3    views that $28 million, since the views of one leader
A08 1570  1    may not be the same as the views of another one.
A08 1570 12       But if the administration should find it does not
A08 1580  8    need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program, a
A08 1590  6    not unlikely conclusion, it could very well seek a
A08 1600  2    way to use the money for other purposes.
A08 1600 10       This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying
A08 1610  6    concern in the administration- the shortage of cash.
A08 1620  7    It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal
A08 1630  2    year.
A08 1630  3       If the administration does not succeed in passing
A08 1640  1    the sales tax bill, or any other tax bill, it could
A08 1640 12    very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session
A08 1650  8    of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma.
A08 1660  2       Since the constitution forbids introduction of a
A08 1670  3    tax bill at a fiscal session, the administration will
A08 1670 12    either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates
A08 1680  9    of anticipated revenues.
A08 1690  1    #CONSTANT PROBLEM#
A08 1690  3    In either case, it could call a special session of
A08 1700  2    the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab
A08 1700 11    at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser.
A08 1710  7       The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant
A08 1720  6    one for any governor. It is one that most try to avoid,
A08 1730  6    as long as they can see an alternative approach to
A08 1740  2    the problem.
A08 1740  4       But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked
A08 1750  1    off, it can be expected the Davis administration will
A08 1750 10    take steps to trim spending at the spring session of
A08 1760  9    the state Legislature.
A08 1770  1       This might be done to arouse those who have been
A08 1770 11    squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the
A08 1780  8    Legislature, so it would be more receptive to a tax
A08 1790  5    proposal later in the year.
A08 1790 10       A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals
A08 1800  6    for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he
A08 1810  6    has not tried to economize.
A08 1810 11       Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some
A08 1820  7    of his followers have been using their administration
A08 1830  3    affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.
A08 1840  1       The new year might see some house-cleaning, either
A08 1840 10    genuine or token, depending upon developments, to give
A08 1850  7    Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms.
A09 0010  1       City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday
A09 0010  7    that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project
A09 0020  8    were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting
A09 0030  5    company which had "an inside track" with the city.
A09 0040  4       Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job
A09 0050  2    have ranged as high as $200,000.
A09 0050  8    #'SHORTCUTS' UNNOTICED#
A09 0060  1    Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co& contracted
A09 0060 10    to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid
A09 0070 12    that was far less than the "legitimate" bids of competing
A09 0080  6    contractors.
A09 0080  7       The Hughes concern then took "shortcuts" on the
A09 0090  7    project but got paid anyway, Hemphill said.
A09 0100  3       The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest
A09 0110  3    development in an investigation which also brought
A09 0110 10    these disclosures Tuesday:
A09 0120  3       The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400
A09 0130  4    performance bond covering the contract.
A09 0130  9       The Philadelphia Transportation Co& is investigating
A09 0140  6    the part its organization played in reviewing the project.
A09 0150  7       The signature of Harold V& Varani, former director
A09 0160  6    of architecture and engineering in the Department of
A09 0170  5    Public Property, appeared on payment vouchers certifying
A09 0180  2    work on the project. Varani has been fired on charges
A09 0180 12    of accepting gifts from the contractor.
A09 0190  6       Managing Director Donald C& Wagner has agreed to
A09 0200  6    cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp
A09 0210  4    disagreement on the matter.
A09 0210  8       The announcement that the city would sue for recovery
A09 0220  8    on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor
A09 0230  4    David Berger at a press conference following a meeting
A09 0240  3    in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the
A09 0240 13    city and the ~PTC as well as representatives of an
A09 0250 10    engineering firm that was pulled off the El project
A09 0260  7    before its completion in 1959.
A09 0260 12    #CONCERN BANKRUPT#
A09 0270  2    The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries,
A09 0280  1    Inc&, both of 3646 N& 2d st&, filed for reorganization
A09 0280 11    under the Federal bankruptcy law. On Monday, the Hughes
A09 0290  9    concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors
A09 0300  6    indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization.
A09 0310  7       Business relations between the companies and city
A09 0320  5    have been under investigation by Hemphill and District
A09 0330  2    Attorney James C& Crumlish, Jr&.
A09 0330  7    #INTERVENES IN CASE#
A09 0340  2    The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas
A09 0340 13    Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding
A09 0350  9    firms. Travelers Indemnity Co& and the Continental
A09 0360  5    Casualty Co&.
A09 0360  7       At Berger's direction, the city also intervened
A09 0370  6    in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U& S& District Court
A09 0380  6    in a move preliminary to filing a claim there.
A09 0390  2       "I am taking the position that the contract was
A09 0390 11    clearly violated", Berger said.
A09 0400  4       The contract violations mostly involve failure to
A09 0410  4    perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along
A09 0420  1    the El track. The contract called for overhauling of
A09 0420 10    102 joints. The city paid for work on 75, of which
A09 0430 10    no more than 21 were repaired, Hemphill charged.
A09 0440  3    #WIDE RANGE IN BIDS#
A09 0440  7    Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the
A09 0450  6    repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint. The bid from
A09 0460  5    A& Belanger and Sons of Cambridge, Mass&, which listed
A09 0470  3    the same officers as Hughes, was $600 per joint.
A09 0480  1       But, Hemphill added, bids from other contractors
A09 0480  8    ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint.
A09 0490  5       Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of
A09 0500  3    the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the
A09 0500 12    morning press conference. Wagner said the city paid
A09 0510  8    only $37,500 to the Hughes company. "We won't know
A09 0520  5    the full amount until we get a full report", Wagner
A09 0530  3    said.
A09 0530  4       "We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond",
A09 0540  4    Berger said.
A09 0540  6       Wagner replied, "Can't you just see the headline:
A09 0550  5    'City Hooked for $172,000'"?
A09 0550  9    #'KNOW ENOUGH TO SUE'#
A09 0560  4    Berger insisted that "we know enough to sue for the
A09 0570  4    full amount".
A09 0570  6       Douglas M& Pratt, president of the ~PTC, who attended
A09 0580  5    the meeting, said the transit company is reviewing
A09 0590  2    the work on the El.
A09 0590  7       "We want to find out who knew about it", Pratt said.
A09 0600  5    "Certain people must have known about it".
A09 0610  1       "The ~PTC is investigating the whole matter", Pratt
A09 0620  1    said.
A09 0630  1       Samuel D& Goodis, representing the Philadelphia
A09 0630  7    Hotel Association, objected on Tuesday to a proposed
A09 0640  7    boost by the city in licensing fees, saying that occupancy
A09 0650  5    rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent
A09 0660  6    last year.
A09 0660  8       Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's
A09 0670  3    Finance Committee.
A09 0670  5       For hotels with 1000 rooms, the increased license
A09 0680  6    fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year, Goodis said.
A09 0690  5    #TESTIFIES AT HEARING#
A09 0690  8    His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising
A09 0700  8    fees for a wide variety of licenses, permits and city
A09 0710  4    services. The new fees are expected to raise an additional
A09 0720  1    $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more
A09 0720 10    a year after that.
A09 0730  3       The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming
A09 0740  1    houses, hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room.
A09 0740 11    The cost of a license now is $2, with an annual renewal
A09 0750  9    fee of $1.
A09 0750 12       Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent
A09 0760  8    of the accomodations in some hotels.
A09 0770  2    #REVENUE ESTIMATED#
A09 0770  4    The city expects the higher rooming house, hotel and
A09 0780  4    apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000
A09 0790  1    a year.
A09 0790  3       The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan,
A09 0800  1    spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia,
A09 0800  9    on behalf of association members who operate apartment
A09 0810  8    houses.
A09 0810  9       A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection
A09 0820 10    from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer, who formerly raised
A09 0830  6    pedigreed dogs. The ordinance would increase fees from
A09 0840  5    $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog.
A09 0850  4    #COMMISSIONER REPLIES#
A09 0850  6    Mrs& Knauer said she did not think dog owners should
A09 0860  5    be penalized for the city's services to animal care.
A09 0870  2       In reply, Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R& Leary
A09 0880  2    said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually
A09 0880 11    to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000
A09 0890  8    in fees.
A09 0890 10       He reported that the city's contributions for animal
A09 0900  7    care included $67,000 to the Women's S&P&C&A&; $15,000
A09 0910  6    to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000
A09 0920  7    to investigate dog bites.
A09 0920 11    #BACKS HIGHER FEES#
A09 0930  3    City Finance Director Richard J& McConnell indorsed
A09 0940  2    the higher fees, which, he said, had been under study
A09 0940 12    for more than a year. The city is not adequately compensated
A09 0950 10    for the services covered by the fees, he said.
A09 0960  7       The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner
A09 0970  4    of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health
A09 0980  3    Commissioner Eugene A& Gillis.
A09 0990  1       Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown
A09 0990  9    attorney Julian W& Barnard will be presented to the
A09 1000  8    Montgomery County Court Friday, it was disclosed Tuesday
A09 1010  6    by Horace A& Davenport, counsel for the widow of the
A09 1020  6    man killed last Nov& 1 by Barnard's hit-run car.
A09 1030  2       The petitions will be presented in open court to
A09 1030 11    President Judge William F& Dannehower, Davenport said.
A09 1040  7       Barnard, who pleaded no defense to manslaughter
A09 1050  7    and hit-run charges, was fined $500 by Judge Warren
A09 1060  6    K& Hess, and placed on two years' probation providing
A09 1070  2    he does not drive during that time. He was caught driving
A09 1080  2    the day after the sentence was pronounced and given
A09 1080 11    a warning.
A09 1090  1       Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery,
A09 1090  9    39. His widow started the circulation of petitions
A09 1100  7    after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation.
A09 1120  1       The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved
A09 1120  8    agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment
A09 1130  7    Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000
A09 1140  6    Eastwick Redevelopment Area project.
A09 1150  1       The commission also approved a novel plan that would
A09 1150 10    eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.
A09 1160  8       One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick
A09 1170  8    Corp& to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865.
A09 1180  5    The tract is bounded by Island ave&, Dicks ave&, 61st
A09 1190  4    st&, and Eastwick ave&.
A09 1190  8    #FOUR PARKS PLANNED#
A09 1200  1    It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment
A09 1210  1    Authority's master plan and will feature row houses,
A09 1210  9    garden apartments, four small parks, schools, churches,
A09 1220  6    a shopping center and several small clusters of stores.
A09 1230  5       The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal
A09 1240  3    Co& and the Samuel A& and Henry A& Berger firm, a Philadelphia
A09 1250  4    builder, for work in the project.
A09 1250 10       The second agreement permits the authority to sell
A09 1260  7    a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia
A09 1270  6    Builders Eastwick Corp&, a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia
A09 1280  7    area builders, which is interested in developing part
A09 1290  4    of the project.
A09 1290  7    #WOULD BAR VEHICLES#
A09 1290 10    The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians
A09 1300  7    was developed by Dr& Constantinos A& Doxiadis, former
A09 1310  5    Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting
A09 1320  6    planner for the New Eastwick Corp&.
A09 1330  1       The plan calls for dividing the project into 16
A09 1330 10    sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic.
A09 1340  6    It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and
A09 1350  3    a central esplanade that would eventually run through
A09 1360  1    the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length
A09 1360 12    of the project.
A09 1370  1       The esplanade eliminates Grovers ave&, which on
A09 1370  8    original plans ran through the center of the development.
A09 1380  9    The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over
A09 1390  5    roads in the project.
A09 1400  1    _KANSAS CITY, MO&, FEB& 9 (~UPI)_
A09 1400  7       - The president of the Kansas City local of the
A09 1410  6    International Association of Fire Fighters was severly
A09 1420  3    injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he
A09 1420 14    left home for work.
A09 1430  4       Battalion Chief Stanton M& Gladden, 42, the central
A09 1440  3    figure in a representation dispute between the fire
A09 1440 11    fighters association and the teamsters union, suffered
A09 1450  7    multiple fractures of both ankles. He was in Baptist
A09 1460  8    Memorial hospital.
A09 1460 10    #IGNITION SETS OFF BLAST#
A09 1470  3    The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his
A09 1480  1    1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway
A09 1480 10    of his home so that he could take his other car to
A09 1490  8    work.
A09 1490  9       "I'd just turned on the ignition when there was
A09 1500  6    a big flash and I was lying on the driveway", he said.
A09 1510  3       Gladden's wife and two of his sons, John, 17, and
A09 1520  3    Jim, 13, were inside the house. The younger boy said
A09 1520 13    the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall.
A09 1530 10    #HOOD FLIES OVER HOUSE#
A09 1540  1    The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over
A09 1540 11    the roof of the house. The left front wheel landed
A09 1550  8    100 feet away.
A09 1550 11       Police laboratory technicians said the explosive
A09 1560  6    device, containing either ~TNT or nitroglycerine, was
A09 1570  4    apparently placed under the left front wheel. It was
A09 1580  4    first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter.
A09 1590  1       Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone
A09 1590  9    calls in recent months and reportedly received one
A09 1600  8    last night.
A09 1600 10       The fire department here has been torn for months
A09 1610  9    by dissension involving top personnel and the fight
A09 1630  1    between the fire fighters association and the teamsters
A09 1640  2    union.
A09 1640  3    #LED FIGHT ON TEAMSTERS#
A09 1640  7    Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present
A09 1650  6    city administration and led his union's battle against
A09 1660  3    the teamsters, which began organizing city firemen
A09 1670  1    in 1959.
A09 1670  3       The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000
A09 1670 11    reward for information leading to the arrest of the
A09 1680  9    person or persons responsible for the bombing. A $500
A09 1690  6    reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas
A09 1700  4    City, Kas&.
A09 1700  6       The association said it would post 24 hour guards
A09 1710  7    at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and
A09 1720  3    Eugene Shiflett. Mining is secretary-treasurer of the
A09 1730  1    local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee.
A09 1730 11    Both have been active in the association.
A09 1750  1    _ANKARA, TURKEY, OCT& 24 (~AP)_
A09 1750  6       - Turkish political leaders bowed today to military
A09 1760  5    pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front
A09 1770  2    government with Gen& Cemal Gursel as president.
A09 1780  1       An agreement between the leaders of four parties
A09 1780  9    which contested indecisive elections on Oct& 15 was
A09 1790  6    reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining
A09 1800  2    under the threat of an army coup d'etat.
A09 1810  1       By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey
A09 1810  8    since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months
A09 1820  7    ago, the army general staff, led by Gen& Cedvet Sunay,
A09 1830  6    had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national
A09 1840  5    coalition government.
A09 1840  7       The army leaders threatened to form a new military
A09 1850  6    government if the parties failed to sign an eight point
A09 1860  4    protocol agreeing on Gen& Gursel as president. Gen&
A09 1870  1    Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months.
A09 1880  1       The military also had demanded pledges that there
A09 1880  8    would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta
A09 1890  8    and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison
A09 1900  4    would be pardoned.
A09 1900  7       Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently
A09 1910  5    satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been
A09 1920  3    reached on a solution to the crisis created by the
A09 1920 13    elections which left no party with enough strength
A09 1930  8    to form a government on its own.
A10 0010  1       Vincent G& Ierulli has been appointed temporary
A10 0010  8    assistant district attorney, it was announced Monday
A10 0020  7    by Charles E& Raymond, District Attorney.
A10 0030  3       Ierulli will replace Desmond D& Connall who has
A10 0040  3    been called to active military service but is expected
A10 0040 12    back on the job by March 31.
A10 0050  7       Ierulli, 29, has been practicing in Portland since
A10 0060  4    November, 1959. He is a graduate of Portland University
A10 0070  1    and the Northwestern College of Law. He is married
A10 0070 10    and the father of three children.
A10 0090  1       Helping foreign countries to build a sound political
A10 0090  9    structure is more important than aiding them economically,
A10 0100  8    E& M& Martin, assistant secretary of state for economic
A10 0110  7    affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday
A10 0120  5    night.
A10 0120  6       Martin, who has been in office in Washington, D&
A10 0130  6    C&, for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting
A10 0140  4    at the Multnomah Hotel. He told some 350 persons that
A10 0150  3    the United States' challenge was to help countries
A10 0150 11    build their own societies their own ways, following
A10 0160  8    their own paths.
A10 0170  1       "We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which,
A10 0170 12    if not identical, is congenial with ours", he said
A10 0180  7    but adding that if they do not develop the kind of
A10 0190  6    society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality
A10 0200  1    and loyalty.
A10 0200  3    #PATIENCE NEEDED#
A10 0200  5    Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice,
A10 0210  6    he said, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union.
A10 0220  2       He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet
A10 0230  2    rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep
A10 0230 13    the people in, and added, "so long as people rebel,
A10 0240  9    we must not give up".
A10 0250  1       Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.
A10 0260  1       "The countries are trying to build in a decade the
A10 0260 10    kind of society we took a century to build", he said.
A10 0270  8       By leaving our doors open the United States gives
A10 0280  5    other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare,
A10 0290  3    he said.
A10 0290  5    #INDIVIDUAL HELP BEST#
A10 0290  8    "We have no reason to fear failure, but we must be
A10 0300  8    extraordinarily patient", the assistant secretary said.
A10 0310  3       Economically, Martin said, the United States could
A10 0320  3    best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.
A10 0330  1    Private business is more effective than government
A10 0330  8    aid, he explained, because individuals are able to
A10 0340  6    work with the people themselves.
A10 0350  1       The United States must plan to absorb the exported
A10 0350 10    goods of the country, at what he termed a "social cost".
A10 0360 10       Martin said the government has been working to establish
A10 0370  8    firmer prices on primary products which may involve
A10 0380  5    the total income of one country.
A10 0390  1       The Portland school board was asked Monday to take
A10 0390 10    a positive stand towards developing and coordinating
A10 0400  6    with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's
A10 0410  6    schools in event of attack.
A10 0420  1       But there seemed to be some difference of opinion
A10 0420 10    as to how far the board should go, and whose advice
A10 0430  6    it should follow.
A10 0430  9       The board members, after hearing the coordination
A10 0440  5    plea from Mrs& Ralph H& Molvar, 1409 ~SW Maplecrest
A10 0450  5    Dr&, said they thought they had already been cooperating.
A10 0460  3       Chairman C& Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps
A10 0470  4    this was not strictly a school board problem, in case
A10 0480  1    of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate
A10 0480 10    so far as possible to get the children to where the
A10 0490  8    parents wanted them to go.
A10 0495  1       Dr& Melvin W& Barnes, superintendent, said he thought
A10 0500  5    the schools were waiting for some leadership, perhaps
A10 0510  7    on the national level, to make sure that whatever steps
A10 0520  7    of planning they took would "be more fruitful", and
A10 0530  3    that he had found that other school districts were
A10 0540  1    not as far along in their planning as this district.
A10 0540 11       "Los Angeles has said they would send the children
A10 0550  8    to their homes in case of disaster", he said. "Nobody
A10 0560  5    really expects to evacuate. I think everybody is agreed
A10 0570  4    that we need to hear some voice on the national level
A10 0580  2    that would make some sense and in which we would have
A10 0580 13    some confidence in following.
A10 0590  3       Mrs& Molvar, who kept reiterating her request that
A10 0600  2    they "please take a stand", said, "We must have faith
A10 0610  1    in somebody- on the local level, and it wouldn't be
A10 0610 11    possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their
A10 0620 10    children".
A10 0620 11       Dr& Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling
A10 0630  9    that evacuation plans, even for a high school where
A10 0640  6    there were lots of cars "might not be realistic and
A10 0650  2    would not work".
A10 0650  5       Mrs& Molvar asked again that the board join in taking
A10 0660  6    a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program. The board
A10 0670  3    said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so
A10 0670 14    far and asked for more information to be brought at
A10 0680 10    the next meeting.
A10 0690  1       It was generally agreed that the subject was important
A10 0690 10    and the board should be informed on what was done,
A10 0700  8    is going to be done and what it thought should be done.

A10 0850  5       A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5
A10 0860  4    million for construction of the two 900-student schools
A10 0870  1    was defeated by district voters in January.
A10 0870  8       Last week the board, by a 4 to 3 vote, decided to
A10 0890  6    ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 (junior high
A10 0900  6    school) system or the 8-4 system. Board members indicated
A10 0910  2    Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll
A10 0910 12    to be taken on Nov& 15, the same date as a $581,000

A10 1040  1    _OAK GROVE (SPECIAL)_
A10 1040  4       - Three positions on the Oak Lodge Water district
A10 1060  2    board of directors have attracted 11 candidates. The
A10 1060 10    election will be Dec& 4 from 8 a&m& to 8 p&m&. Polls
A10 1070 12    will be in the water office.
A10 1080  4       Incumbent Richard Salter seeks re-election and is
A10 1090  3    opposed by Donald Huffman for the five-year term. Incumbent
A10 1100  1    William Brod is opposed in his re-election bid by Barbara
A10 1100 12    Njust, Miles C& Bubenik and Frank Lee.
A10 1110  7       Five candidates seek the place vacated by Secretary
A10 1120  5    Hugh G& Stout. Seeking this two-year term are James
A10 1130  4    Culbertson, Dwight M& Steeves, James C& Piersee, W&M&
A10 1140  2    Sexton and Theodore W& Heitschmidt.
A10 1150  1       A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp
A10 1150 11    on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the
A10 1160  9    29th general council of the Assemblies of God, in session
A10 1170  7    at the Memorial Coliseum.
A10 1180  1       The council revised, in an effort to strengthen,
A10 1180  8    the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966.
A10 1190  7       The changes, unanimously adopted, were felt necessary
A10 1200  4    in the face of modern trends away from the Bible. The
A10 1210  3    council agreed it should more firmly state its belief
A10 1210 12    in and dependence on the Bible.
A10 1220  6       At the adoption, the Rev& T& F& Zimmerman, general
A10 1230  4    superintendent, commented, "The Assemblies of God has
A10 1240  4    been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days
A10 1250  1    and has, without compromise, stood for the great truths
A10 1250 10    of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing
A10 1260 10    to give their lives".
A10 1270  1    #NEW POINT ADDED#
A10 1270  4    Many changes involved minor editing and clarification;
A10 1280  1    however, the first belief stood for entire revision
A10 1280  9    with a new third point added to the list.
A10 1290  8       The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination, now
A10 1300  4    reads:
A10 1300  5       "The scriptures, both Old and New Testament, are
A10 1310  4    verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of
A10 1320  2    God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith
A10 1320 11    and conduct".
A10 1330  1       The third belief, in six points, emphasizes the
A10 1330  9    Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ, and:
A10 1340  7       - emphasizes the Virgin birth
A10 1350  1       - the sinless life of Christ
A10 1350  6       - His miracles
A10 1360  3       - His substitutionary work on the cross
A10 1360  9       - His bodily resurrection from the dead
A10 1370  5       - and His exaltation to the right hand of God.
A10 1380  4    #SUPER AGAIN ELECTED#
A10 1380  7    Friday afternoon the Rev& T& F& Zimmerman was reelected
A10 1390  6    for his second consecutive two-year term as general
A10 1400  4    superintendent of Assemblies of God. His offices are
A10 1410  2    in Springfield, Mo&. Election came on the nominating
A10 1410 10    ballot.
A10 1420  1       Friday night the delegates heard the need for their
A10 1420 10    forthcoming program, "Breakthrough" scheduled to fill
A10 1430  6    the churches for the next two years. In his opening
A10 1440  7    address Wednesday the Rev& Mr& Zimmerman, urged the
A10 1450  4    delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program,
A10 1460  1    with "Breakthrough" the theme for the first two years.
A10 1470  1       The Rev& R& L& Brandt, national secretary of the
A10 1470  9    home missions department, stressed the need for the
A10 1480  7    first two years' work.
A10 1490  1       "Surveys show that one out of three Americans has
A10 1490 10    vital contact with the church. This means that more
A10 1500  8    than 100 million have no vital touch with the church
A10 1510  5    or religious life", he told delegates Friday.
A10 1520  1    #CHURCH LOSES PACE#
A10 1520  4    Talking of the rapid population growth (upwards of
A10 1530  2    12,000 babies born daily) with an immigrant entering
A10 1530 10    the United States every 1-1/2 minutes, he said "our
A10 1540  9    organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge".
A10 1550  7       "In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches", the
A10 1560  5    Rev& Mr& Brandt said, adding that the denomination
A10 1570  3    had a national goal of one church for every 10,000
A10 1580  1    persons.
A10 1580  2       "In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois,
A10 1590  1    where we have 200; 800 in Southern New England, we
A10 1590 11    have 60; we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none",
A10 1600 10    he said.
A10 1600 12       To step up the denomination's program, the Rev&
A10 1610  7    Mr& Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies
A10 1620  7    of God churches in the next 10 years.
A10 1630  2       To accomplish this would necessitate some changes
A10 1630  9    in methods, he said.
A10 1640  3    #'CHURCH MEETS CHANGE'#
A10 1640  6    "The church's ability to change her methods is going
A10 1650  8    to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this
A10 1660  5    hour".
A10 1660  6       A capsule view of proposed plans includes:
A10 1670  1       - Encouraging by every means, all existing Assemblies
A10 1680  1    of God churches to start new churches.
A10 1680  8       - Engaging mature, experienced men to pioneer or
A10 1690  7    open new churches in strategic population centers.
A10 1700  1       - Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers
A10 1710  2    (laymen, who will be urged to move into the area of
A10 1710 13    new churches in the interest of lending their support
A10 1720  9    to the new project).
A10 1730  3       - Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from
A10 1730 10    6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches.
A10 1750  1       U&S& Dist& Judge Charles L& Powell denied all motions
A10 1760  1    made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance
A10 1760  9    fraud trial.
A10 1770  2       Denials were of motions of dismissal, continuance,
A10 1770  9    mistrial, separate trial, acquittal, striking of testimony
A10 1780  7    and directed verdict.
A10 1790  2       In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated
A10 1800  1    that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other
A10 1800 11    courts and that "a person may join a conspiracy without
A10 1810  8    knowing who all of the conspirators are".
A10 1820  2       Attorney Dwight L& Schwab, in behalf of defendant
A10 1830  2    Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence linking
A10 1830 10    Weinstein to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared
A10 1840  8    this is a matter for the jury to decide.
A10 1850  6    #PROOF LACK CHARGED#
A10 1850  9    Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's
A10 1860  7    entering a conspiracy to use the U&S& mails to defraud,
A10 1870  5    to which federal prosecutor A& Lawrence Burbank replied:
A10 1880  3       "It is not necessary that a defendant actually have
A10 1890  3    conpired to use the U&S& mails to defraud as long as
A10 1900  2    there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails were
A10 1900 12    then used to carry it out".
A10 1910  5       In the afternoon, defense attorneys began the presentation
A10 1920  3    of their cases with opening statements, some of which
A10 1930  1    had been deferred until after the government had called
A10 1930 10    witnesses and presented its case.
A11 0010  1    _MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_
A11 0010  5       - The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of
A11 0020  2    being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League
A11 0030  1    clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition
A11 0030 10    decision, this one to the Kansas City Athletics by
A11 0040  9    a score of 5 to 3.
A11 0050  1       Indications as late as the top of the sixth were
A11 0050 11    that the Birds were to end their victory draought as
A11 0060  8    they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage.
A11 0080  1    #SIEBERN HITS HOMER#
A11 0080  4    Over the first five frames, Jack Fisher, the big righthandler
A11 0090  5    who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for
A11 0100  4    a drive on the 1961 American League pennant, held the
A11 0110  2    ~A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits.
A11 0120  1       Then Dick Hyde, submarine-ball hurler, entered the
A11 0120  8    contest and only five batters needed to face him before
A11 0130  8    there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock.
A11 0140  1       A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast
A11 0140 12    by Bill Tuttle tied the game, and single runs in the
A11 0150 10    eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory
A11 0160  5    in eight starts.
A11 0160  8    #HOUSE THROWS WILD#
A11 0170  1    With one down in the eighth, Marv Throneberry drew
A11 0170 10    a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle. Catcher
A11 0180  7    Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry
A11 0190  7    was wide and in the dirt.
A11 0190 13       Then Heywood Sullivan, Kansas City catcher, singled
A11 0200  7    up the middle and Throneberry was across with what
A11 0210  6    proved to be the winning run.
A11 0220  1       Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde
A11 0220  7    at the start of the ninth and gave up the ~A's fifth
A11 0230  9    tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser, a wild
A11 0240  5    pitch, and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop
A11 0250  2    Jerry Adair's glove into center.
A11 0250  7       The Orioles once again performed at the plate in
A11 0260  8    powderpuff fashion, gathering only seven blows off
A11 0270  5    the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers. Three
A11 0280  1    were doubles, Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv
A11 0280 10    Breeding one.
A11 0290  2    #HARTMAN IMPRESSIVE#
A11 0290  4    Bill Kunkel, Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound
A11 0300  5    chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play
A11 0310  3    the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium.
A11 0320  1       The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs
A11 0320 12    off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the
A11 0330  9    fourth. Hartman, purchased by the ~A's from the Milwaukee
A11 0340  7    Braves last fall, allowed no hits in his scoreless
A11 0350  4    three-inning appearance, and merited the triumph.
A11 0360  1       Keegan, a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder, gave up the
A11 0360 12    Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames,
A11 0370  8    escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds
A11 0380  7    threatened but failed to tally.
A11 0390  4    #ROBINSON DOUBLES AGAIN#
A11 0400  3    In the ninth, Robinson led off with his second double
A11 0410  2    of the night, a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into
A11 0410 14    left.
A11 0420  1       Whitey Herzog, performing in right as the Orioles
A11 0420  9    fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring,
A11 0430  7    worked Keegan for a base on balls.
A11 0440  2       Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce.
A11 0450  1       Pete Ward was sent in for House and, after failing
A11 0450 11    in a bunt attempt, popped to Howser on the grass back
A11 0460  9    of short.
A11 0460 11       John Powell, batting for Adair, fanned after fouling
A11 0470  8    off two 2-and-2 pitches, and Buddy Barker, up for Stepanovich,
A11 0480  7    bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end
A11 0490  7    the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest.
A11 0500  1       The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding,
A11 0500 12    along with Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of
A11 0510 10    hits, doubled to right center, moved to third on Russ
A11 0520  7    Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild
A11 0530  4    pitch into the dirt in front of the plate.
A11 0540  1       The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on
A11 0540 12    three straight hits after two were out.
A11 0550  5       Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short
A11 0560  3    to start the rally.
A11 0560  7    #LUMPE ERRS#
A11 0560  9    Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove
A11 0570  7    and beat it out for a single, and when Lumpe grabbed
A11 0580  4    the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's
A11 0590  1    head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error.
A11 0600  1       Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center
A11 0600 10    to score both runners. When Robinson tried to stretch
A11 0610  7    his blow into a triple, he was cut down in a close
A11 0620  7    play at third, Tuttle to Andy Carey.
A11 0630  1       The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring
A11 0630  8    in the sixth went like this:
A11 0640  3       Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face
A11 0640 13    Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next
A11 0650  9    toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center.
A11 0660  7    #CAREY SINGLES#
A11 0660  9    Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which
A11 0670  9    Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first.
A11 0680  6    It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit.
A11 0690  1       Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play.
A11 0690  9    Breeding to Adair to Gentile, setting up Tuttle's 390-foot
A11 0700 10    homer over the wall in left center.
A11 0710  5       If the Orioles are to break their losing streak
A11 0720  2    within the next two days, it will have to be at the
A11 0720 14    expense of the American League champion New York Yankees,
A11 0730  9    who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single
A11 0740  9    test Sunday afternoon.
A11 0750  1    _MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_
A11 0750  5       - The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League
A11 0760  3    news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles
A11 0770  1    were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations
A11 0770 10    under the Army's military training program and is ready
A11 0780  9    for belated spring training.
A11 0790  3       Hansen, who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers
A11 0800  3    and drove in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average, completes
A11 0800 14    the Birds' spring squad at 49 players.
A11 0810  7       The big, 22-year-old shortstop, the 1960 American
A11 0820  5    league "rookie-of-the year", flew here late this afternoon
A11 0830  4    from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated
A11 0840  1    $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss
A11 0840 12    to Kansas City- the winless Birds' sixth setback in
A11 0850  7    a row.
A11 0850  9    #15 POUNDS LIGHTER#
A11 0860  2    The 6-foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds,
A11 0870  1    15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring.
A11 0870 10    He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before
A11 0880  9    the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence.
A11 0890  3       When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox,
A11 0900  2    Ky&, Hansen's weight had dropped to 180- "too light
A11 0910  1    for me to be at my best" he said.
A11 0910 10       "I feel good physically", Hansen added, "but I think
A11 0920  6    I'll move better carrying a little less weight than
A11 0930  4    I'm carrying now".
A11 0930  7    #SEEKS "IMPROVED FIELDING"#
A11 0940  1    The rangy, Albany (Cal&) native, a surprise slugging
A11 0950  1    sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive
A11 0950 12    whiz, set "improved fielding" as his 1961 goal.
A11 0970  1       "I think I can do a better job with the glove, now
A11 0970 13    that I know the hitters around the league a little
A11 0980  9    better", he said.
A11 0990  1       Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami
A11 0990 10    Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game
A11 1000  9    weekend series with the New York Yankees.
A11 1010  3       Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm, the Flock's veteran
A11 1020  2    knuckleball specialists, are slated to oppose the American

A11 1110 12    from St& Petersburg, including Joe Dimaggio and large
A11 1120  8    crowds are anticipated for both weekend games. The
A11 1130  6    famed Yankee Clipper, now retired, has been assisting

A11 1140 11    Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after
A11 1150 10    completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime
A11 1160  6    military course, also at Fort Knox, Ky&. The 22-year-old
A11 1170  8    southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen.
A11 1180  5       Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now

A11 1210  2    "Take a ride on this one", Brooks Robinson greeted
A11 1220  1    Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat, headed
A11 1220 11    for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double
A11 1230  9    off the left-centerfield wall tonight.
A11 1240  3       It was the first of two doubles by Robinson, who
A11 1250  2    was in a mood to celebrate.
A11 1250  8       Just before game time, Robinson's pretty wife, Connie
A11 1260  4    informed him that an addition to the family can be
A11 1270  3    expected late next summer.
A11 1270  7       Unfortunately, Brooks' teammates were not in such
A11 1280  6    festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit
A11 1290  4    pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers.

A11 1310  9    of the Oriole board of directors, and Public Relations
A11 1320  8    Director Jack Dunn.
A11 1330  1       Their flight was delayed, Dunn said, when a boarding

A11 1590  1    _CLEVELAND, MARCH 17 (~AP)_
A11 1590  5       - George Kerr, the swift-striding Jamaican, set
A11 1610  3    a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of
A11 1610 15    Columbus track meet tonight, beating Purdue's Dave
A11 1620  7    Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1.
A11 1630  4       Kerr, who set the world record earlier this month
A11 1640  1    in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3, wiped out Mills's
A11 1640 12    early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king
A11 1650 11    by 5 yards. Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8
A11 1660  8    set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield.
A11 1670  1       Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through
A11 1670 11    two thirds of the race. Then Kerr, a graduate student
A11 1680  8    from Illinois, moved past him on a straightaway and
A11 1690  6    held off Mills's challenge on the final turn. Mills
A11 1700  2    was timed in 1.10.4.
A11 1700  6       The crowd at the twenty-first annual K& of C& Games,

A11 1720 11    broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile
A11 1730 11    run.
A11 1730 12       Mrs& Grace Butcher, of nearby Chardon, a 27-year-old
A11 1740  9    housewife who has two children, finished in 2.21.6.

A11 1780  1    _SAN FRANCISCO, MARCH 17 (~AP)_
A11 1780  6       - Bobby Waters of Sylvania, Ga&, relief quarterback
A11 1790  4    for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football
A11 1800  2    League, will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin
A11 1810  1    Hospital here.
A11 1810  3       Waters injured his left knee in the last game of
A11 1820  3    the 1960 season. While working out in Sylvania a swelling
A11 1830  1    developed in the knee and he came here to consult the

A12 0010  1    _AUSTIN, TEXAS_
A12 0010  3       - A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's
A12 0020  2    plays, Eldon Moritz, ranks fourth in Southwest Conference
A12 0030  1    scoring after three games.
A12 0030  5       Time stands still every time Moritz, a 26-year-old
A12 0040  5    Army Signal Corps veteran, goes into the field. Although
A12 0050  1    he never gets to play while the clock is running, he
A12 0050 12    gets a big kick- several every Saturday, in fact- out
A12 0060  7    of football.
A12 0070  1       Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads
A12 0070 10    but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn
A12 0080  8    team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma
A12 0090  5    in the Cotton Bowl.
A12 0090  9       That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points
A12 0100  9    in 15 tries. He ran his string of successful conversions
A12 0110  6    this season to 13 straight before one went astray last
A12 0120  5    Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington
A12 0130  1    State.
A12 0130  2       Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right
A12 0140  1    halfback, the position at which he lettered on the
A12 0140 10    1956 team. But ask coach Darrell Royal what position
A12 0150  7    he plays and you'll get the quick response, "place-kicker".
A12 0160  5       A 208-pound, 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford,
A12 0170  4    Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking. Last year,
A12 0180  2    when he worked out at halfback all season, he didn't
A12 0180 12    get into a single game.
A12 0190  5       "This year, coach Royal told me if I'd work on my
A12 0200  4    place-kicking he thought he could use me", said Moritz.
A12 0210  1    "So I started practicing on it in spring training.
A12 0210 10       Moritz was bothered during the first two games this
A12 0220  9    year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right (kicking)
A12 0230  8    leg and, as a result, several of his successful conversions
A12 0240  4    have gone barely far enough.
A12 0240  9       Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and, as a
A12 0250 10    result, he hopes to start practicing field goals this
A12 0260  5    week. He kicked several while playing at Stamford High
A12 0270  3    School, including one that beat Anson, 3-0, in a 1953
A12 0280  1    district game.
A12 0280  3       "I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during
A12 0290  2    three years in high school", he said, "and made 26
A12 0290 12    in a row at one time. I never did miss one in a playoff
A12 0300 13    game- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my
A12 0310  9    last two years".
A12 0310 12       Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football
A12 0320 10    efforts were hampered by a knee injury. He missed the
A12 0330  8    1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee,
A12 0340  4    then played 77 minutes in 1956. His statistical record
A12 0350  1    that year, when Texas won only one game and lost nine,
A12 0350 12    was far from impressive: he carried the ball three
A12 0360  7    times for a net gain of 10 yards, punted once for 39
A12 0370  6    yards and caught one pass for 13 yards.
A12 0380  1       He went into the Army in March, 1957, and returned
A12 0380 11    two years later. But he was scholastically ineligible
A12 0390  6    in 1959 and merely present last season.
A12 0400  3       Place kicking is largely a matter of timing, Moritz
A12 0410  1    declared.
A12 0410  2       "Once you get the feel of it, there's not much to
A12 0420  2    it. I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick
A12 0420 14    and some of them can't seem to get the feel. Practice
A12 0430 10    helps you to get your timing down.
A12 0440  3       "It's kind of like golf- if you don't swing a club
A12 0450  4    very often, your timing gets off".
A12 0450 10       Moritz, however, kicks only about 10 or 12 extra
A12 0460  8    points during each practice session.
A12 0470  1       "If you kick too much, your leg gets kinda dead",
A12 0470 11    he explained. @

A12 0480  4       In their first three games, the Longhorns have had
A12 0490  3    the ball 41 times and scored 16 times, or 40 per cent
A12 0500  1    **h their total passing yardage in three games, 447
A12 0500 10    on 30 completions in 56 attempts, is only 22 yards
A12 0510  8    short of their total passing yardage in 1959, when
A12 0520  4    they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries **h. Tailback
A12 0530  1    James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total
A12 0530  9    for his brilliant sophomore season, when he netted
A12 0540  6    271 yards on 55 carries; he now has 273 yards in 22
A12 0550  7    tries during three games **h. Saxton has made only
A12 0560  2    one second-half appearance this season and that was
A12 0560 11    in the Washington State game, for four plays: he returned
A12 0570  8    the kickoff 30 yards, gained five yards through the
A12 0580  6    line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before
A12 0590  3    retiring to the bench **h. Wingback Jack Collins injured
A12 0600  1    a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll
A12 0600 11    be ready for Oklahoma **h. Last week, when Royal was
A12 0610  9    informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's
A12 0620  6    top four in rushing, he said: "That won't last long".
A12 0630  5    It didn't; Monday, he had four Longhorns in the top
A12 0640  5    four **h.
A12 0650  1       A good feeling prevailed on the ~SMU coaching staff
A12 0650 10    Monday, but attention quickly turned from Saturday's
A12 0660  7    victory to next week's problem: Rice University. The
A12 0670  5    Mustangs don't play this week.
A12 0680  2       "We're just real happy for the players", Coach Bill
A12 0690  1    Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy.
A12 0690 13    "I think the big thing about the game was that our
A12 0700 11    kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching
A12 0710  6    and kept the pressure on. It was the first time we've
A12 0720  5    been ahead this season (when John Richey kicked what
A12 0730  2    proved to be the winning field goal)".
A12 0730  9       Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as
A12 0740  6    "a good feeling, I think, on the part of the coaches
A12 0750  6    and the players. We needed it and we got it".
A12 0760  1       Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive
A12 0770  1    performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy
A12 0770  9    Gannon. Both turned in top jobs for the second straight
A12 0780  9    game.
A12 0780 10       "Nelson played magnificent football", Meek praised.
A12 0790  5    "He knocked down the interference and made key stops
A12 0800  5    lots of times. And he caused the fumble that set up
A12 0810  4    our touchdown. He broke that boy (Air Force fullback
A12 0810 13    Nick Arshinkoff) in two and knocked him loose from
A12 0820  9    the football".
A12 0830  1       Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons'
A12 0830  8    aerial thrusts in the late stages.
A12 0840  5       One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang
A12 0850  3    21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory.
A12 0860  1       "As soon as it started to form, Gannon spotted it",
A12 0860 11    Meek said. "He timed it just right and broke through
A12 0870 10    there before the boy (halfback Terry Isaacson) had
A12 0880  6    time to turn around. He really crucified him **h he
A12 0890  4    nailed it for a yard loss".
A12 0890 10       The Air Force's, and the game's, final play, was
A12 0900  7    a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon
A12 0910  5    intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards.
A12 0920  3       "He just lay back there and waited for it", Meek
A12 0930  1    said. "He almost brought it back all the way".
A12 0930 10       Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback
A12 0940  8    Mike Rice, Meek expects the squad to be physically
A12 0950  6    sound for Rice.
A12 0950  9       "Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game", Meek
A12 0960  8    said. "He'll be out of action all this week. He got
A12 0970  7    hit from the blind side by the split end coming back
A12 0980  3    on the second play of the game. There is definitely
A12 0980 13    some ligament damage in his knee".
A12 0990  6       Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the
A12 1000  5    opener with Maryland.
A12 1000  8       "He's looking a lot better, and he's able to run",
A12 1010  9    Meek explained. "We'll let him do a lot of running
A12 1020  8    this week, but I don't know if he'll be able to play".
A12 1030  5       The game players saw the Air Force film Monday,
A12 1040  2    ran for 30 minutes, then went in, while the reserves
A12 1040 12    scrimmaged for 45 minutes.
A12 1050  4       "We'll work hard Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday",
A12 1060  3    Meek said, "and probably will have a good scrimmage
A12 1070  1    Friday. We'll work out about an hour on Saturday, then
A12 1070 11    we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week, then taper
A12 1080 10    off".

A12 1260  1       The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their
A12 1260 10    third victory in four American Football League starts-
A12 1270  7    a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos- but their
A12 1280  6    visit will be a short one.
A12 1290  1       The Texans have two more road games- at Buffalo
A12 1290  9    and Houston- before they play for the home folks again,
A12 1300  9    and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet
A12 1310  5    the Bills just as they are developing into the kind
A12 1320  3    of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings.
A12 1330  1       Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey, who has become one
A12 1330  9    of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks,
A12 1340  5    apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National
A12 1350  6    Football Leaguers, M& C& Reynolds and Warren Rabb.
A12 1360  4       Rabb, the former Louisiana State field general,

A12 1380  1    and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory
A12 1380 12    over the Houston Oilers, defending league champions.
A12 1390  5       "Just our luck"! exclaimed Stram. "Buster would
A12 1400  4    solve that quarterback problem just as we head that
A12 1410  5    way".
A12 1410  6       Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself,
A12 1420  2    for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid
A12 1430  1    effort against Denver, and the Texans were able to
A12 1430 10    whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of
A12 1440  6    a top star, Jack Spikes, though he did the team's place-kicking
A12 1450  7    while nursing a knee injury.
A12 1460  1       "Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally
A12 1460  9    well", said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed
A12 1470 10    movies of the game. "In fact our whole defensive unit
A12 1480  8    did a good job".
A12 1490  1       The Texans won the game through ball control, with
A12 1490 10    Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes.
A12 1500  6       "We always like to keep the ball as much as we can
A12 1510  8    against Denver because they have such an explosive
A12 1520  2    attack", explained Stram. "They can be going along,
A12 1530  1    doing little damage, then bang, bang- they can hit
A12 1530 10    a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you
A12 1540  8    in trouble".
A12 1540 10       The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final
A12 1550  9    period against the Texans, but Dallas had enough of
A12 1560  5    a lead to hold them off.
A12 1560 11       The principal tactic in controlling the ball was
A12 1570  7    giving it to Abner Haynes, the flashy halfback. He
A12 1580  3    was called upon 26 times- more than all of the other
A12 1590  1    ball-carriers combined- and delivered 145 yards.
A12 1590  8       The Texans made themselves a comforting break on
A12 1600  7    the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was
A12 1610  4    jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson, the speedy
A12 1620  3    halfback, hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it
A12 1630  2    for Dallas. A quick touchdown resulted.
A12 1630  8       "That permitted us to start controlling the ball
A12 1640  7    right away", said Stram, quipping, "I think I'll put
A12 1650  5    that play in the book".
A12 1660  1       The early Southwest Conference football leaders-
A12 1660  7    Texas, Arkansas and Texas ~A+~M- made a big dent in
A12 1670  9    the statistics last week.
A12 1680  2       Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave
A12 1690  1    the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards
A12 1690 11    (1,065 rushing and 447 passing) a new ~SWC high.
A12 1700  8       Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards
A12 1710  6    passing (on 5 completions in 7 tosses) and a tough
A12 1720  3    defense to whip ~TCU, and ~A+~M, with a 38-point bulge
A12 1730  2    against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play
A12 1730 12    since 1950. Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards,
A12 1740  9    the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards.
A12 1750  5       Texas leads in per-game rushing averages, 355 yards,
A12 1760  3    and passing 149 (to Baylor's 126), but idle Baylor
A12 1760 12    has the best defensive record (187.5 yards per game
A12 1770  9    to Texas' 189). ~A+~M has the best defense against
A12 1780  7    passes, 34.7 yards per game.
A12 1790  1       Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on
A12 1790  8    the liveliness of baseballs currently in use, the major
A12 1800  8    leagues have ordered their own tests, which are in
A12 1810  5    progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A13 0010  1       Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching
A13 0010  8    Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over
A13 0020 10    Indianapolis, 5-3.
A13 0030  1       The husky 6-3, 205-pound lefthander, was in command
A13 0030 11    all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only
A13 0040 10    949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver
A13 0050  5    area.
A13 0050  6       It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the
A13 0060  5    new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to
A13 0070  3    four straight. They now lead Louisville by a full game
A13 0070 13    on top of the American Association pack.
A13 0080  7       Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton
A13 0090  6    in the third inning. He has given only the one pass
A13 0100  5    in his 27 innings, an unusual characteristic for a
A13 0110  1    southpaw.
A13 0110  2       The Bears took the lead in the first inning, as
A13 0120  1    they did in Sunday's opener, and never lagged.
A13 0120  9       Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles
A13 0130  8    against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack.
A13 0140  6    After Al Paschal gruonded out, Jay Cooke walked and
A13 0150  4    Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe. Alusik then moved
A13 0160  2    Cooke across with a line drive to left. Jay Porter
A13 0160 12    drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's
A13 0170 11    smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout.
A13 0180  7       The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe
A13 0190  5    dropped a double into the leftfield corner, Paschal
A13 0200  2    doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled
A13 0200 10    off Phil Shartzer's glove.
A13 0210  3       Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians
A13 0220  4    bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the
A13 0230  1    sixth. Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner,
A13 0230  9    Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infielder
A13 0240  8    roller accounted for the tallies.
A13 0250  3       The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's
A13 0260  3    double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert.
A13 0270  1       Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for
A13 0270 10    the third Indianapolis run in the ninth.
A13 0280  5       Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked
A13 0290  3    off in 1:48, thanks to only three bases on balls and
A13 0290 14    some good infield play.
A13 0300  4       Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder
A13 0310  2    in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some
A13 0320  1    good stops and showed a strong arm at third base.
A13 0320 11    #BINGLES AND BOBBLES:#

A13 0430  1    _DALLAS, TEX&, MAY 1- (~AP)_
A13 0430  6       - Kenny Lane of Muskegon, Mich&, world's seventh
A13 0450  4    ranked lightweight, had little trouble in taking a
A13 0460  3    unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler, Tex&,
A13 0460 11    here Monday night.
A13 0480  1    _ST& PAUL-MINNEAPOLIS, MAY 1- (~AP)_
A13 0480  7       - Billy Gardner's line double, which just eluded
A13 0490  6    the diving Minnie Minoso in left field, drove in Jim
A13 0500  5    Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last
A13 0510  2    of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory
A13 0510 14    over the Chicago White Sox Monday.
A13 0520  5       Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game,
A13 0530  5    a liner to center. He came all the way around on Gardner's
A13 0540  2    hit before 5777 fans. It was Gardner's second run batted
A13 0550  1    in of the game and his only ones of the year.
A13 0550 12       Turk Lown was tagged with the loss, his second against
A13 0560  9    no victories, while Ray Moore won his second game against
A13 0570  7    a single loss.
A13 0570 10       The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when
A13 0580  8    Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base
A13 0590  5    and scored on Lenny Green's double to left.
A13 0600  1       The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of
A13 0600 14    the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits- a triple by Roy
A13 0610 11    Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon- a walk and a
A13 0620  5    sacrifice fly.
A13 0620  7       Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first
A13 0630  8    inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead, but Harmon Killebrew
A13 0640  4    came back in the bottom of the first with his second
A13 0650  2    homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard.
A13 0660  1       Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth- his
A13 0660 11    fourth homer of the campaign- tied the score and Carreon's
A13 0670  9    first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox
A13 0680  9    back in front.
A13 0680 12       A double by Green, Allison's run-scoring 2-baser,
A13 0690  7    an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single
A13 0700  5    to center put the Twins back in front in the last of
A13 0710  5    the fifth.
A13 0720  1    _OGDEN, UTAH, MAY 1- (~AP)_
A13 0720  6       - Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday
A13 0740  5    night he was through playing baseball.
A13 0750  1       "I've had it", he told a newsman. "I know when my
A13 0750 12    reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th
A13 0760 11    man on the ball club".
A13 0770  1       This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden
A13 0770 11    walkout.
A13 0780  1       Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130
A13 0780 13    batting average in the first 12 games.
A13 0790  6       He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday,
A13 0800  2    without an official word to anybody, and has stayed
A13 0810  1    away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation
A13 0810 11    to Reno, Nev&, where his wife, former Olympic Diving
A13 0820  7    Champion Zoe Ann Olsen, awaited.
A13 0830  2       She said, when she learned Jackie was heading home:
A13 0840  1    "I'm just speculating, but I have to think Jack feels
A13 0840 11    he's hurting Boston's chances".
A13 0850  4       The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner, City of
A13 0860  4    San Francisco, stopped in Ogden, Utah, for a few minutes.
A13 0870  4    Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard
A13 0880  1    Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him.
A13 0880 10       The conductor said to Ritchie: "I don't think you
A13 0890  8    want to talk to him. You'll probably get a ball bat
A13 0900  7    on the head. He's mad at the world".
A13 0910  2       But Jackie had gone into the station. Ritchie walked
A13 0920  1    up to him at the magazine stand.
A13 0920  8       "I told him who I was and he was quite cold. But
A13 0930  6    he warmed up after a while. I told him what Liston
A13 0940  2    had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and
A13 0940 13    said anything he (Liston) got was through a keyhole.
A13 0950  8    He said he had never talked to Liston".
A13 0960  4       Liston is Bill Liston, baseball writer for the Boston
A13 0970  4    Traveler, who quoted Jensen as saying:
A13 0980  1       "I can't hit anymore. I can't run. I can't throw.
A13 0990 10    Suddenly my reflexes are gone.
A13 1010  1       JUST WHEN IT SEEMS baseball might be losing its
A13 1010 10    grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions
A13 1020  9    of tongues to wagging.
A13 1030  1       And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old
A13 1030 13    Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against
A13 1040  8    the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating
A13 1050  4    with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday.
A13 1060  2       Both, of course, were remarkable feats and further
A13 1060 10    embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national
A13 1070  9    pastime.
A13 1080  1       Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's
A13 1080  9    hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts.
A13 1090  6       It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know
A13 1100  8    who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone. And
A13 1110  2    one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked, "Wish
A13 1120  1    I was 40, and a top-grade big leaguer.
A13 1120 10    #@#
A13 1120 11    THE MODEST AND HAPPY Spahn waved off his new laurels
A13 1140  8    as one of those good days. But there surely can be
A13 1150  6    no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with
A13 1160  2    the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history.
A13 1170  1       Yes, with Bob Grove, Carl Hubbell, Herb Pennock,
A13 1170  9    Art Nehf, Vernon Gomez, et al.
A13 1180  5       Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly
A13 1190  4    fine fellow, a ball player's ball player, as they say
A13 1200  2    in the trade.
A13 1200  5       I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless
A13 1210  3    exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct& 14, 1951, before
A13 1220  1    a new record crowd for the period of 18,792.
A13 1220 10    #@#
A13 1220 11    "SPAHNIE DOESN'T KNOW how to merely go through the
A13 1240  9    motions", remarked Enos Slaughter, another all-out
A13 1250  6    guy, who played rightfield that day and popped one
A13 1260  5    over the clubhouse.
A13 1260  8       The spectacular Mays, who reaches a decade in the
A13 1270  7    big leagues come May 25, joined six other sluggers
A13 1280  2    who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings.
A13 1290  1       Incidentally, only two did it before a home audience.
A13 1290 10    Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home
A13 1300 11    and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts
A13 1310  6    Field.
A13 1310  7       Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies, the
A13 1320  8    Braves' Joe Adcock, Lou Gehrig of the Yankees, Pat
A13 1330  6    Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito, then with
A13 1340  4    Cleveland, made their history on the road.
A13 1340 11    #@#
A13 1350  1    WILLIE'S BIG DAY REVIVED the running argument about
A13 1360  1    the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle.
A13 1370  8       This is an issue which boils down to a matter of
A13 1380  8    opinion, depending on whether you're an American or
A13 1390  4    National fan and anti or pro-Yankee. The record books,
A13 1400  2    however, would favor the Giants' ace.
A13 1400  8       In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as
A13 1410  7    many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases.
A13 1420  5    Once the figure was 30-30. Willie's lifetime batting
A13 1430  1    average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's.
A13 1430  9       The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their
A13 1440 11    windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in
A13 1450  7    Milwaukee's park. It will forever be a baseball mystery
A13 1460  5    how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing
A13 1470  3    slump.
A13 1470  4    #@#
A13 1470  5    THE DENVER-AREA ~TV audience was privileged to see
A13 1480  6    Mays' four home runs, thanks to a new arrangement made
A13 1490  4    by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked
A13 1500  1    out when his Bears are playing at home.
A13 1500  9       This rule providing for a blackout of televised
A13 1510  6    baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or
A13 1520  4    minor league game in any area comes from the game's
A13 1520 14    top rulers.
A13 1530  2       The last couple of years the Bears management got
A13 1540  1    the business from the "Living Room Athletic Club" when
A13 1540 10    games were cut off. Actually they were helpless to
A13 1550  9    do anything about the nationwide policy.
A13 1560  2       This year, I am told, the ~CBS network will continue
A13 1570  3    to abide by the rule but ~NBC will play to a conclusion
A13 1580  1    here. There are two more Sunday afternoons when the
A13 1580 10    situation will arise.
A13 1590  3       It is an irritable rule that does baseball more
A13 1600  1    harm than good, especially at the minor league level.
A13 1600 10    You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed
A13 1610  6    away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television
A13 1620  6    policy.
A13 1620  7       This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that
A13 1630  5    the video not be terminated before the end of the game.
A13 1650  1    _CINCINNATI, OHIO (~AP)_
A13 1650  4       - The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world
A13 1660  5    series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati,
A13 1670  1    crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday
A13 1670 11    in the loosely played finale.
A13 1680  3       With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action
A13 1690  4    due to injuries, the American League champs still mounted
A13 1700  1    a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati
A13 1700 11    pitchers, the most ever used by one team in a series
A13 1710 11    game.
A13 1710 12       Johnny Blanchard, Mantle's replacement, slammed
A13 1720  4    a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay
A13 1730  4    in a 5-run first inning. Hector Lopez, subbing for
A13 1740  2    Berra, smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during
A13 1740 12    another 5-run explosion in the fourth.
A13 1750  5       The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati
A13 1760  3    errors.
A13 1760  4       The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud.
A13 1770  3       In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home
A13 1780  2    run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right
A13 1780 12    center, about 400 feet away, with two men on. Momentarily
A13 1790  9    the Reds were back in the ball game, trailing only
A13 1800  6    6-3, but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled
A13 1810  2    out with men on second and third and two out.
A13 1810 12       In the fifth, Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off
A13 1820 11    Bud Daley, but by that time the score was 11-5 and
A13 1830  9    it really didn't matter.
A13 1830 13       The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third
A13 1840  9    man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series
A13 1850  9    victory in his first year as a manager. Only Bucky
A13 1860  4    Harris, the "boy-manager" of Washington in 1924, and
A13 1870  3    Eddie Dyer of the St& Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished
A13 1880  1    the feat.
A14 0010  1    _PHILADELPHIA, JAN& 23_
A14 0010  4       - Nick Skorich, the line coach for the football
A14 0020  2    champion Philadelphia Eagles, was elevated today to
A14 0020  9    head coach.
A14 0030  2       Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary
A14 0030 11    believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year.
A14 0040  9    He succeeds Buck Shaw, who retired at the end of last
A14 0050  8    season.
A14 0050  9       The appointment was announced at a news conference
A14 0060  6    at which Skorich said he would retain two members of
A14 0070  4    Shaw's staff- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer.
A14 0080  1       Williams is a defensive coach. Gauer works with
A14 0080  9    the ends.
A14 0090  1    #CHOICE WAS EXPECTED#
A14 0090  4    The selection had been expected. Skorich was considered
A14 0100  3    the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin
A14 0110  1    permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota
A14 0110 11    Vikings, the newest National Football League entry.
A14 0120  7       Van Brocklin, the quarterback who led the Eagles
A14 0130  7    to the title, was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday.
A14 0140  4    Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection
A14 0150  2    after he had refused to reconsider his decision to
A14 0150 11    end his career as a player.
A14 0160  6       With Skorich at the helm, the Eagles are expected
A14 0170  3    to put more emphasis on running, rather than passing.
A14 0170 12    In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's
A14 0180 10    aerials.
A14 0190  1       Skorich, however, is a strong advocate of a balanced
A14 0190 10    attack- split between running and passing.
A14 0200  5    #COACH PLAYED 3 YEARS#
A14 0200  9    Skorich, who is 39 years old, played football at Cincinnati
A14 0210 10    University and then had a three-year professional career
A14 0220  8    as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh
A14 0230  4    Steelers.
A14 0230  5       An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948
A14 0240  6    season. He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh
A14 0250  1    Central Catholic High School in 1949. He remained there
A14 0260  1    for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic
A14 0260  9    Institute in Troy, N& Y&. He was there one season before
A14 0270 11    rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach.
A14 0280  5       Four years later he resigned to take a similar job
A14 0290  5    with the Green Bay Packers. The Eagles signed him for
A14 0300  3    Shaw's staff in 1959.
A14 0300  7       Skorich began his new job auspiciously today. At
A14 0310  3    a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson
A14 0320  1    Dilworth, the Eagles were honored for winning the championship.
A14 0330  1       Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches
A14 0330 10    and team officials who received an engrossed copy of
A14 0340  8    an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks
A14 0350  7    shaped like a football.
A14 0360  1       With the announcement of a "special achievement
A14 0360  8    award" to William A& (Bill) Shea, the awards list was
A14 0370  9    completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth
A14 0380  6    annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter, Baseball
A14 0390  4    Writers' Association of America, at the Waldorf-Astoria
A14 0400  3    Hotel.
A14 0400  4       Shea, the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee,
A14 0410  3    will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn, the southpaw
A14 0420  3    pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves; Frank Graham,
A14 0430  1    the Journal-American sports columnist; Bill Mazeroski,
A14 0430  8    the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and
A14 0440  9    Casey Stengel, the former manager of the Yankees.
A14 0450  7       Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award.
A14 0460  6    Mazeroski, whose homer beat the Yankees in the final
A14 0470  4    series game, will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the
A14 0480  2    outstanding player in the 1960 world series.
A14 0480  9       Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service
A14 0490  7    to baseball and will get the William J& Slocum Memorial
A14 0500  5    Award. To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award
A14 0510  4    as the chapter's player of the year.
A14 0510 11    #SHOW FOLLOWS CEREMONIES#
A14 0520  3    A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies, which
A14 0530  2    will be followed by the show in which the writers will
A14 0530 13    lampoon baseball personalities in skit, dance and song.
A14 0540  8       The 53-year-old Shea, a prominent corporation lawyer
A14 0550  6    with a sports background, is generally recognized as
A14 0560  5    the man most responsible for the imminent return of
A14 0570  2    a National League club to New York. Named by Mayor
A14 0570 12    Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included
A14 0580  7    James A& Farley, Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume, Shea
A14 0590  7    worked relentlessly.
A14 0600  1       His goal was to obtain a National League team for
A14 0600 11    this city. The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers
A14 0610  8    to California left New York with only the Yankees.
A14 0620  5       Despite countless barriers and disappointments,
A14 0630  1    Shea moved forward. When he was unable to bring about
A14 0640  1    immediate expansion, he sought to convince another
A14 0640  8    National League club to move here.
A14 0650  5       When that failed, he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid
A14 0660  2    in the formation of a third major league, the Continental,
A14 0670  1    with New York as the key franchise. The Continental
A14 0670 10    League never got off the ground, but after two years
A14 0680  9    it forced the existing majors to expand.
A14 0690  3    #FLUSHING STADIUM IN WORKS#
A14 0690  7    The New York franchise is headed by Mrs& Charles Shipman
A14 0700  7    Payson. A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing
A14 0710  4    Meadow Park is in the works, and once the lease is
A14 0720  2    signed the local club will be formally recognized by
A14 0720 11    Commissioner Ford C& Frick. Shea's efforts figure prominently
A14 0730  8    in the new stadium.
A14 0740  2       Shea and his wife, Nori, make their home at Sands
A14 0750  1    Point, L& I&. Bill Jr&, 20; Kathy, 15, and Patricia,
A14 0760  1    9, round out the Shea family.
A14 0760  7       Shea was born in Manhattan. He attended New York
A14 0770  4    University before switching to Georgetown University
A14 0780  1    in Washington. He played basketball there while working
A14 0780  9    toward a law degree.
A14 0790  4       Later, Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians,
A14 0800  2    a minor league professional football team. He was the
A14 0800 11    lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National
A14 0810 10    Football League.
A14 0820  2    #@#
A14 0820  3    All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the
A14 0830  3    local National Leaguers yesterday. On Friday, Roger
A14 0830 10    Maris, the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American
A14 0840  9    League's most-valuable-player award, will meet with
A14 0850  5    Roy Hamey, the general manager. Maris is in line for
A14 0860  6    a big raise.
A14 0870  1       Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those
A14 0870 10    honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan
A14 0880  8    Golf Writers Association tonight. The dinner will be
A14 0890  6    held at the Hotel Pierre.
A14 0900  1       Palmer, golf's leading money-winner in 1960, and
A14 0900  8    Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada
A14 0910  8    Cup matches last June in Dublin. Deane Beman, the National
A14 0920  5    Amateur champion, and all the metropolitan district
A14 0930  2    champions, including Bob Gardner, the amateur title-holder,
A14 0940  1    also will receive awards.
A14 0940  5       The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe
A14 0950  7    of Plainfield, N& J&, and Palm Beach, Fla&, for his
A14 0960  6    sponsorship of charity tournaments. Horton Smith of
A14 0970  3    Detroit, a former president of the Professional Golfers
A14 0980  1    Association, will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for
A14 0980  9    his comeback following a recent illness.
A14 0990  5       The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington,
A14 1000  3    Democrat of Missouri.
A14 1010  1    #GOLF'S GOLDEN BOY#
A14 1010  4    ARNOLD PALMER has been a blazing figure in golf over
A14 1020  4    the past twelve months. He won the Masters, the United
A14 1030  1    States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money. He
A14 1030 11    was heralded as "Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated,
A14 1040  9    and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the "Professional
A14 1050  8    Athlete of the Year", a distinction that earned for
A14 1060  7    him the $10,000 diamond- studded Hickok Belt.
A14 1070  3       But he also achieved something that endeared him
A14 1080  2    to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot. A couple of
A14 1080 13    weeks ago, he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole.
A14 1090 11    It made him human. And it also stayed the hands of
A14 1100  7    thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating
A14 1110  2    the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were
A14 1110 10    driving them to despair. If such a paragon of perfection
A14 1120 10    as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege, there
A14 1130  7    was hope left for all.
A14 1140  1       It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a
A14 1140 10    yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold.
A14 1150  4    He merely became victimized by a form of athletics
A14 1160  3    that respects no one and aggravates all. The world's
A14 1170  1    best golfer, shooting below par, came to the last hole
A14 1170 11    of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every
A14 1180  9    intention of delivering a final crusher. He boomed
A14 1190  6    a 280-yard drive. Then the pixies and the zombies took
A14 1200  3    over while the banshees wailed in the distance.
A14 1200 11    #NO MARGIN FOR ERROR#
A14 1210  3    On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole, Arnold whipped
A14 1220  1    into his second shot. The ball went off in a majestic
A14 1220 12    arc, an out-of-bounds slice. He tried again and once
A14 1230 10    more sliced out of bounds. He hooked the next two out
A14 1240  7    of bounds on the opposite side.
A14 1250  1       "It is possible that I over-corrected", he said
A14 1250 10    ruefully. Each of the four wayward shots cost him two
A14 1260  9    strokes. So he wound up with a dozen.
A14 1270  2       "It was a nice round figure, that 12", he said as
A14 1280  1    he headed for the clubhouse, not too much perturbed.
A14 1280 10       From the standpoint of the army of duffers, however,
A14 1290  8    this was easily the most heartening exhibition they
A14 1300  3    had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during
A14 1310  2    his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open. The
A14 1310 13    idol of the hackers, of course, is Ray Ainsley, who
A14 1320  9    achieved a 19 in the United States Open. Their secondary
A14 1330  5    hero is another pro, Willie Chisholm, who drank his
A14 1340  4    lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way
A14 1350  2    out of a rock-strewn gully. Willie's partner was Long
A14 1350 12    Jim Barnes, who tried to keep count.
A14 1360  6    #STICKLER FOR RULES#
A14 1360  9    "How many is that, Jim"? asked Willie at one stage
A14 1370  9    of his excavation project.
A14 1380  1       "Thirteen", said Long Jim.
A14 1380  5       "Nae, man", said Willie, "ye must be countin' the
A14 1390  8    echoes". He had a 16.
A14 1400  1       Palmer's dozen were honestly earned. Nor were there
A14 1400  9    any rules to save him. If there had been, he would
A14 1410 10    have found a loophole, because Arnold is one golfer
A14 1420  5    who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote
A14 1430  3    the book. This knowledge has come in handy, too.
A14 1430 12       His first shot in the Open last year landed in a
A14 1440 11    brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway.
A14 1450  7    The ball floated downstream. A spectator picked up
A14 1460  3    the ball and handed it to a small boy, who dropped
A14 1460 14    this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.
A14 1470  9       Arnold sent for Joe Dey, the executive secretary
A14 1480  6    of the golf association. Joe naturally ruled that a
A14 1490  4    ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had
A14 1500  1    originally entered the stream.
A14 1500  5       "I knew it all along", confessed Arnold with a grin,
A14 1510  5    "but I just happened to think how much nicer it would
A14 1520  4    be to drop one way up there".
A14 1520 11       For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious
A14 1530  8    intensity, Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor
A14 1540  5    that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from
A14 1550  2    jangling like banjo strings. Yet he remains the fiercest
A14 1550 11    of competitors. He'll even bull head-on into the rules
A14 1560  9    when he is sure he's right. That's how he first won
A14 1570  8    the Masters in 1958.
A14 1580  1       It happened on the twelfth hole, a 155-yarder. Arnold's
A14 1580 11    iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding
A14 1590  8    the green, an embankment that had become soft and spongy
A14 1600  7    from the rains, thereby bringing local rules into force.
A14 1610  4    #RULING FROM ON HIGH#
A14 1610  8    "I can remove the ball, can't I"? asked Palmer of an
A14 1620  7    official.
A14 1620  8       "No", said the official. "You must play it where
A14 1630  8    it lies".
A14 1630 10       "You're wrong", said Arnold, a man who knows the
A14 1640  9    rules. "I'll do as you say, but I'll also play a provisional
A14 1650 10    ball and get a ruling".
A14 1660  1       He scored a 4 for the embedded ball, a 3 with the
A14 1660 13    provisional one. The golfing fathers ruled in his favor.
A14 1670  9    So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball
A14 1680  5    and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke.
A14 1690  3       Until a few weeks ago, however, Arnold Palmer was
A14 1700  2    some god-like creature who had nothing in common with
A14 1700 12    the duffers. But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became
A14 1710 10    one of the boys, a bigger hero than he ever had been
A14 1720  7    before.
A14 1730  1       A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis
A14 1730 10    Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule
A14 1740  8    to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football
A14 1750  6    League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today.
A14 1760  4       Other items on the agenda during the meetings, which
A14 1770  3    are expected to continue through Saturday, concern
A14 1770 10    television, rules changes, professional football's
A14 1780  5    hall of fame, players' benefits and constitutional
A14 1790  4    amendments.
A14 1790  5       The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team
A14 1800  8    league to play a home-and-home series with teams in
A14 1810  4    its division, plus two games against teams in the other
A14 1820  1    division. However, this would require a lengthening
A14 1820  8    of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks.
A14 1830  6       Pete Rozelle, the league commissioner, pointed out:
A14 1840  3       "We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and
A14 1850  5    weather at the other".
A14 1850  9       Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks
A14 1860  6    and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates.
A15 0010  1       If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the
A15 0010 10    Phillies, they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower
A15 0020  9    start this season.
A15 0030  1       "Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat", Mauch
A15 0030  9    said here the other day. "The Pirates showed they could
A15 0040  9    outclass the field last year. They have the same men,
A15 0050  8    no age problem, no injuries and they also have Vinegar
A15 0060  5    Bend Mizell for the full season, along with Bobby Shantz".
A15 0070  3       Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals, who gave the
A15 0080  3    Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960, breaking
A15 0080 13    even with them, will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's
A15 0090 11    world champions. The Pirates have a 9-6 record this
A15 0100  9    year and the Redbirds are 7-9.
A15 0110  3    #CHANGE IN PITCHERS.#
A15 0110  6    Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher,
A15 0120  3    from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio, for several reasons:
A15 0130  2    1. Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run
A15 0130 13    mark against Pittsburgh a year ago; 2. The desire to
A15 0140 10    give Broglio as many starts as possible; 3. The Redbirds'
A15 0150  8    disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday.
A15 0160  5       Manager Hemus, eager to end a pitching slump that
A15 0170  6    has brought four losses in the five games on the current
A15 0180  4    home stand, moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting
A15 0190  1    assignment. After Thursday's open date, Solly plans
A15 0190  8    to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday
A15 0200  8    night.
A15 0200  9       Harvey Haddix, set back by the flu this season,
A15 0210  9    will start against his former Cardinal mates, who might
A15 0220  5    be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's
A15 0230  3    game at Busch Stadium. Boyer is suffering from a stiff
A15 0240  1    neck.
A15 0240  2       Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds, despite
A15 0250  1    only a 1-3 mark in 1960.
A15 0250  8       Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided
A15 0260  5    between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game. Mizell
A15 0270  3    has won both of his starts.
A15 0270  9    #NIEMAN KEPT IN LINEUP.#
A15 0280  1    After a lengthy workout yesterday, an open date, Hemus
A15 0280 10    said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup.
A15 0290  9    That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench
A15 0300  7    on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home
A15 0310  4    run day against the Giants.
A15 0310  9       "I have to stay with Nieman for a while", Hemus
A15 0320  7    said. "Bill White (sore ankles) should be ready. With
A15 0330  5    a lefthander going for Pittsburgh, I may use Don Taussig
A15 0340  4    in center".
A15 0340  6       "Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25
A15 0350  4    minutes, and he looked good", Hemus said. "He should
A15 0360  2    be getting back in the groove before long. Our pitching
A15 0370  1    is much better than it has shown".
A15 0370  8       The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates
A15 0380  4    needed extra batting practice, but Murtaugh also turned
A15 0390  3    his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday.
A15 0390 10    #SIX BUCKS OVER .300.#
A15 0400  2    Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati
A15 0410  1    over the weekend, the champions had eight men hitting
A15 0410 10    over .300. Despite the recession, Pittsburgh came into
A15 0420  6    town with this imposing list of averages: Smoky Burgess
A15 0430  5    .455, Gino Cimoli .389, Bill Virdon .340, Bob Clemente
A15 0440  4    and Dick Groat, each .323, Dick Stuart .306, Don Hoak
A15 0450  3    .280 and Bob Skinner .267.
A15 0450  8       Bill Mazeroski with .179 and Hal Smith with .143
A15 0460  7    were the only Pirates dragging their feet.
A15 0470  2       Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over
A15 0470 11    the news that Musial probably will sit out most of
A15 0480 10    the series is Bob Friend, who was beaten by The Man
A15 0490  7    twice last season on dramatic home runs. Friend is
A15 0500  4    off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely
A15 0510  1    to see action here this week.
A15 0510  7       "We're getting Friend some runs for a change, and
A15 0520  7    he has been pitching good", Murtaugh said. "Virdon
A15 0530  2    has been blasting the ball. No plunkers for him".
A15 0540  1    #SIX BUCS OVER .300.#
A15 0540  4    The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last
A15 0550  3    year, when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held
A15 0550 13    them even over the season. On last May 1, the Cardinals
A15 0560 11    stood at 7-6, ending a two-season fall-off on that
A15 0570  8    milestone. In 1958, the Birds were 3-10 on May 1. A
A15 0580  7    year later they were 4-13.
A15 0580 13       Since 1949, the St& Louis club has been below .500
A15 0590  8    on May 1 just four times. The '49 team was off to a
A15 0600  7    so-so 5-5 beginning, then fell as low as 12-17 on May
A15 0610  3    23 before finishing with 96 victories.
A15 0610  9       The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88
A15 0620 11    triumphs, the club's top since 1949. Then last season
A15 0630  5    the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before
A15 0640  3    recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories.
A15 0640 14       Since 1949, the only National League club that got
A15 0650 10    off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was
A15 0660 10    the '55 Dodger team. Those Dodgers won their first
A15 0670  5    10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead
A15 0680  2    by May 8. The club that overcame the worst start in
A15 0680 13    a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's
A15 0690  9    '51 Giants, who dropped 11 of their first 13.
A15 0710  1       They honored the battling Billikens last night.
A15 0710  8    Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise
A15 0720  8    to a group of St& Louis University players who, in
A15 0730  5    the words of Coach John Benington, "had more confidence
A15 0740  3    in themselves than I did".
A15 0740  8       The most valuable player award was split three ways,
A15 0750  7    among Glen Mankowski, Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer.
A15 0760  5    In addition, a special award was given to Bob (Bevo)
A15 0770  4    Nordmann, the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the
A15 0780  2    season because of a knee injury.
A15 0780  8       "You often hear people talk about team spirit and
A15 0790  6    that sort of thing", Benington said in a conversation
A15 0800  2    after the ceremonies, "but what this team had was a
A15 0800 12    little different. The boys had a tremendous respect
A15 0810  8    for each other's ability. They knew what they could
A15 0820  7    do and it was often a little more than I thought they
A15 0830  5    could do.
A15 0840  1       "Several times I found the players pepping me up,
A15 0850  4    where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver
A15 0860  2    the fight talk. We'd be losing at halftime to a good
A15 0860 13    team and Hartweger would say, 'Don't worry, Coach-
A15 0870  8    we'll get 'em all right'".
A15 0880  3       The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were
A15 0890  2    introduced by Bob Broeg, sports editor of the Post-Dispatch.
A15 0900  1       Kieffer, the only junior in the group, was commended
A15 0900 10    for his ability to hit in the clutch, as well as his
A15 0910 11    all-round excellent play.
A15 0920  1       Mankowski, the ball-hawking defensive expert, was
A15 0920  8    cited for his performance against Bradley in St& Louis
A15 0930  8    U&'s nationally televised victory. Benington said,
A15 0940  5    "I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski
A15 0950  8    did against Bradley that day".
A15 0960  1       Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that
A15 0960  9    he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because
A15 0970  9    he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball
A15 0980  7    skills. After the coach listed all the boy's faults,
A15 0990  4    Hartweger said, "Coach before I leave here, you'll
A15 1000  2    get to like me".
A15 1000  6       Mrs& Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what
A15 1010  5    she could to persuade her husband that the boy might
A15 1020  2    help the team.
A15 1020  5       As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl, he said,
A15 1030  3    "I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into
A15 1030 13    letting me play".
A15 1040  3       Bob Burnes, sports editor of the Globe-Democrat,
A15 1050  1    presented Bob Nordmann with his award. Bevo was congratulated
A15 1050 10    for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help
A15 1060 12    the team if his knee healed in time. Within a week
A15 1070  8    after the injury, suffered in St& Louis's victory in
A15 1080  4    the final game of the Kentucky tournament, Nordmann
A15 1090  1    was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could
A15 1090 11    to help Benington.
A15 1100  2       On the clock given him was the inscription, "For
A15 1110  1    Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball, 1960-61".
A15 1110  8       Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9
A15 1120 11    record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation
A15 1130  8    Tournament were: Art Hambric, Donnell Reid, Bill Nordmann,
A15 1140  7    Dave Harris, Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich.
A15 1150  4       "This team set a precedent that could be valuable
A15 1160  5    in the future", Benington pointed out. "By winning
A15 1170  2    against Bradley, Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams'
A15 1180  1    home courts, they showed that the home court advantage
A15 1180 10    can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn's take a
A15 1190  8    super team to do it".
A15 1200  1       St& Louis University found a way to win a baseball
A15 1200 11    game. Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game,
A15 1210  9    said to be the first in Billiken baseball history,
A15 1220  5    as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State
A15 1230  3    College, 5-1, at Crystal City.
A15 1230  9       The victory was the first of the season for the
A15 1240  9    Billikens after nine defeats and a tie. The tie was
A15 1250  6    against Southeast Missouri last Friday.
A15 1260  1       Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits
A15 1260 11    in five trips including a double, Len Boehmer also
A15 1270  6    was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a
A15 1280  4    home run and a triple.
A15 1280  9       St& Louis U& was to be in action again today with
A15 1290  9    a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University
A15 1300  2    at Ligget Field.
A15 1300  5       The game opened a busy week for Washington. The
A15 1310  5    Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at
A15 1320  3    3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy, Ill&,
A15 1330  1    Saturday.
A15 1340  1    #HAPPY HITTING#
A15 1340  3    If it's true that contented cows give more milk, why
A15 1350  2    shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits?
A15 1360  1       The two top talents of the time, Mickey Mantle and
A15 1360 11    Willie Mays, have hit the ball harder and more successfully
A15 1370  8    so far this early season than at any period in careers
A15 1380  7    which, to be frank about it, never have quite reached
A15 1390  3    expectations.
A15 1390  4       And that's meant as a boost, not a knock.
A15 1400  3       Mays and Mantle, both 10-year men at 30, have so
A15 1410  1    much ability that, baseball men agree, they've never
A15 1410  9    hit the heights. Their heights, that is.
A15 1420  5       Mantle, the bull-necked blond switch-hitter, had
A15 1430  2    one sensational triple-crown season, 1959, when he
A15 1430 10    batted .365 and also led the American League in home
A15 1440 10    runs, 52, and ~RBIs, 130.
A15 1450  2       Like the Yankees' slugger, Mays, the terror of the
A15 1460  2    Giants, has had seasons that would be considered the
A15 1460 11    ultimate by most players, but not by- or for- Willie.
A15 1470  9    His best years were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers
A15 1480  8    and '55 when he belted 51 home runs, drove in 127 and
A15 1490  5    stole 24 bases.
A15 1490  8       Now, apparently happier under new managers, Mays
A15 1500  5    and Mantle, the perfect players, are behaving as though
A15 1510  3    they're going to pass those previous peaks.
A15 1510 10    #LABOR RELATIONS#
A15 1520  1    Yes, we know, they're professionals, men paid to play,
A15 1520 10    and they shouldn't care how they're handled, just as
A15 1530  9    long as their names are spelled correctly on the first
A15 1540  8    and fifteenth of each month.
A15 1550  1       The truth is, though, that men react differently
A15 1550  9    to different treatment. For that matter, Stan Musial
A15 1560  7    is rare, possessing the disposition that enabled him
A15 1570  4    to put out the same for seven managers, reserving his
A15 1580  2    opinions, but not his effort.
A15 1590  3       Mantle, it's apparent, resented Casey Stengel's
A15 1600  4    attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the
A15 1610  3    veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility. The
A15 1610 11    old man was almost too possessive. Stengel inherited
A15 1620  8    DiMaggio, Rizzuto, but HE brought up Mantle from Class
A15 1630  8    ~C to the majors, from Joplin to New York.
A15 1640  5       With the speed and power of the body beautiful he
A15 1650  3    saw before him, Ol' Case wanted No& 7 to be not only
A15 1660  2    the best homerun hitter, but also the best bunter,
A15 1660 11    base-runner and outfielder. Stengel probably preached
A15 1670  5    too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop
A15 1680  6    his bubble gum and sow his oats.
A15 1680 13       Inheriting a more mature Mantle, who now has seen
A15 1690  9    the sights on and off Broadway, Ralph Houk quietly
A15 1700  4    bestowed, no pun intended, the mantle of authority
A15 1710  2    on Mickey. The Major decided that, rather than be led,
A15 1720  1    the slugger could lead. And what leadership a proud
A15 1720 10    Mantle has given so far.
A15 1730  3       The opinion continues here that with a 162-game
A15 1730 12    schedule, pitching spread thin through a 10-team league
A15 1740  9    and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley
A15 1750  6    Field Jr&, Mantle just might break the most glamorous
A15 1760  5    record on the books, Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927.
A15 1770  3    #FOUR FOR ALVIN#
A15 1770  6    Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the
A15 1780  5    kids and Commies this year. Willie's wonderful walloping
A15 1790  2    Sunday- four home runs- served merely to emphasize
A15 1790 10    how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark.
A15 1800 10       Next to Leo Durocher, Dark taught Mays the most
A15 1810  6    when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo
A15 1820  5    Grounds 10 years ago this month, to help the Giants
A15 1830  1    win a dramatic pennant.
A16 0010  1       ROMANTIC news concerns Mrs& Joan Monroe Armour and
A16 0020  1    F& Lee H& Wendell, who are to be married at 4:30 p&
A16 0020 13    m& tomorrow in the Lake Forest home of her brother,
A16 0030  9    J& Hampton Monroe, and Mrs& Monroe. Only the families
A16 0040  7    and a dozen close friends will be present.
A16 0050  4       The bride's brother, Walter D& Monroe Jr&, will
A16 0060  3    give her in marriage. In the small group will be the
A16 0060 14    junior and senior Mrs& Walter Monroe; the bridegroom's
A16 0070  8    parents, the Barrett Wendells, who are returning from
A16 0080  8    a winter holiday in Sarasota, Fla&, for the occasion;
A16 0090  5    and his brother, Mr& Wendell Jr&, and his wife, who
A16 0100  6    will arrive from Boston. Mr& Wendell Jr& will be best
A16 0110  4    man.
A16 0110  5       Also present will be the bride's children, Joan,
A16 0120  2    13, and Kirkland, 11. Their father is Charles B& Armour.
A16 0130  1    The bridegroom's children were here for the Christmas
A16 0130  9    holidays and can't return. Young Peter Wendell, a student
A16 0140  9    at the Westminster school, has measles, and his sister,
A16 0150  7    Mrs& Andrew Thomas, and her husband, who live in Missoula,
A16 0160  8    Mont&, have a new baby. Their mother is Mrs& Camilla
A16 0170  5    Alsop Wendell.
A16 0170  7       Mr& Wendell and his bride will live in his Lake
A16 0180  9    Forest house. They will take a wedding trip later.
A16 0190  4    #'BACK WITH THE MET'#
A16 0190  8    "We are back with the 'Met' again now that the 'Met'
A16 0200  8    is back in Chicago", bulletins Mrs& Frank S& Sims,
A16 0210  6    president of the women's board of the University of
A16 0220  5    Chicago Cancer Research Foundation. The New York Metropolitan
A16 0230  3    Opera Company will be here in May, and the board will
A16 0240  2    sponsor the Saturday night, May 13, performance of
A16 0240 10    "Turandot" as a benefit. Birgit Nilsson will be starred.
A16 0250  9       "Housed in the new McCormick Place theater, this
A16 0260  8    should prove to be an exciting evening", adds Mrs&
A16 0270  5    Sims. The board's last money raising event was a performance
A16 0280  5    by Harry Belafonte- "quite off-beat for this group",
A16 0290  4    decided some of the members. Mrs& Henry T& Sulcer of
A16 0300  3    Winnetka, a new board member, will be chairman of publicity
A16 0310  1    for the benefit. Her husband recently was appointed
A16 0310  9    vice president of the university, bringing them back
A16 0320  7    here from the east.
A16 0320 11    #PARICHY-HAMM#
A16 0330  1    Because of the recent death of the bride's father,
A16 0330 10    Frederick B& Hamm, the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm
A16 0340  9    to John Bruce Parichy will be a small one at noon tomorrow
A16 0350  9    in St& Bernadine's church, Forest Park. A small reception
A16 0360  6    will follow in the Oak Park Arms hotel.
A16 0370  2       Mrs& Hamm will not come from Vero Beach, Fla&, for
A16 0380  2    the wedding. However, Mr& Parichy and his bride will
A16 0380 11    go to Vero Beach on their wedding trip, and will stay
A16 0390 11    in the John G& Beadles' beach house. The Beadles formerly
A16 0400  7    lived in Lake Forest.
A16 0410  1       Harvey B& Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece

A16 0470  3    at a cocktail party and buffet supper beginning at
A16 0480  2    5:30 p& m& tomorrow. Later, a bus will carry members
A16 0480 12    to the Chicago Stadium to see Jack Kramer's professional
A16 0490  8    tennis matches at 8 p& m&.
A16 0510  1       WITH loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the
A16 0510 10    Presbyterian-St& Luke's Fashion show still ringing
A16 0520  6    in her ears, its director, Helen Tieken Geraghty [Mrs&
A16 0530  5    Maurice P& Geraghty] is taking off tomorrow on a 56
A16 0540  8    day world trip which should earn her even greater acclaim
A16 0550  3    as director of entertainment for next summer's International
A16 0560  1    Trade fair. Armed with letters from embassies to ministers
A16 0570  1    of countries, especially those in the near and far
A16 0570 10    east, Mrs& Geraghty "will beat the bushes for oriental
A16 0580  8    talent".
A16 0580  9       "We [the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry]
A16 0590  8    expect to establish closer relations with nations and
A16 0600  6    their cultural activities, and it will be easy as a
A16 0610  8    member of the fair staff to bring in acts", explains
A16 0620  2    Mrs& Geraghty. "For instance, Djakarta, Indonesia,
A16 0630  1    has three groups of dancers interested in coming here.
A16 0630 10    I'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes
A16 0640  8    of Damascus"!
A16 0640 10       The last obstacle in Mrs& Geraghty's globe-girdling
A16 0650  8    trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria
A16 0660  7    called upon her to explain that his brother would meet
A16 0670  5    her at the border of that country- so newly separated
A16 0680  2    from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't
A16 0690  1    been able to obtain a visa.
A16 0690  7    #FIRST, HONOLULU#
A16 0690  9    Honolulu will be Mrs& Geraghty's first stop. Then Japan,
A16 0700  7    Hong Kong, Manila, India, Pakistan, Damascus, Beirut,
A16 0710  5    and to Rome, London, and Paris "to look over wonderful
A16 0720  5    talent".
A16 0720  6       Dec& 22 is the deadline for Mrs& Geraghty's return;
A16 0730  5    the Geraghtys' youngest daughter, Molly, bows in the
A16 0740  5    Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next night. Molly
A16 0750  3    already has her cotillion gown, and it's fitted, says
A16 0760  1    her mother. Also, invitations have been addressed to
A16 0760  9    Molly's debut tea the afternoon of Dec& 29 in the Arts
A16 0770 10    club.
A16 0770 11       It won't be a "tea", however, but more of an international
A16 0780 10    folk song festival, with singers from Chicago's foreign
A16 0790  6    groups to sing Christmas songs from around the world.
A16 0800  6    The international theme will be continued with the
A16 0810  3    Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys
A16 0810 12    will give in the Racquet club after the tea. Miss Abra
A16 0820 11    Prentice's debut supper dance in the Casino will wind
A16 0830  9    up the day.

A16 0840  1    The Richard S& Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting
A16 0850  1    for the wedding reception for their daughter, Helen
A16 0850  9    Lambert, and the young Italian she met last year while
A16 0860  8    studying in Florence during her junior year at Smith
A16 0870  6    college. He is Aldo Rostagno, son of the Guglielmo
A16 0880  2    Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year
A16 0880 11    in Europe. The Burkes, who now live in Kankakee, are

A16 0900  4       Miss Burke, a graduate of Miss Hall's school, stayed

A16 0920  8    English into Italian. He will be coming here on business
A16 0930  8    in December, when the wedding is to take place in Wayne.

A17 0610  5       Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset
A17 0620  4    at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer
A17 0630  5    st&.
A17 0630  6       The pert, gray-haired woman who came to Denver three
A17 0640  6    years ago from Buffalo, N&Y&, is a "civilian" with
A17 0650  4    the Army.
A17 0650  6       Her position covers a number of daily tasks common
A17 0660  5    to any social director. The job also covers a number
A17 0670  2    of other items.
A17 0670  5       "Mom" Marr, as the more than 80 men at the center
A17 0675  4    call her, is the link that helps to bridge the gulf
A17 0680 10    between alcoholics and the outside world and between
A17 0690  8    parolees and society.
A17 0700  1       Her day starts early, but no matter how many pressing
A17 0700 11    letters there are to be written (and during May, which
A17 0710 10    is National Salvation Army Week, there are plenty),
A17 0720  6    schedules to be made or problems to be solved, Mrs&
A17 0730  5    Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is
A17 0740  3    out.
A17 0740  4       MRS& MARR is the first contact a Skid Row figure
A17 0750  2    talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself
A17 0750 12    up.
A17 0760  1       She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee
A17 0760 12    awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents
A17 0770  8    the rules of the center and explains procedures.
A17 0780  3       "Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society
A17 0790  3    and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle
A17 0800  1    with his fellow men", Mrs& Marr explained.
A17 0800  8       The Denverite has worked out an entire program to
A17 0810  8    achieve this using the facilities of the center.
A17 0820  4       "And I bum tickets to everything I can", she said.
A17 0830  3    "I've become the greatest beggar in the world".
A17 0835  1       IN ADDITION to the tickets to the movies, sporting
A17 0840  8    events and concerts, Mrs& Marr lines up candy and cookies
A17 0850 10    because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace
A17 0860  8    the sugar in their system.
A17 0870  1       Mrs& Marr also has a number of parolees to "mother",
A17 0870 11    watching to see that they do not break their parole
A17 0880 10    and that they also learn to readjust to society.
A17 0900  1       By mid-June, millions of Americans will take to
A17 0900 10    the road on vacation trips up and down and back and

A17 0920  2       In another four weeks, with schools closed across
A17 0920 10    the nation, the great all-American summer safari will
A17 0930  9    be under way. By July 1, six weeks from now, motel-keepers
A17 0940  9    all over the nation will, by 6 p&m&, be switching on
A17 0950  7    that bleak- to motorists- sign, "No Vacancy".
A17 0960  2       No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer,
A17 0970  2    probably a hundred times as many gas up the family
A17 0970 12    car, throw suitcases, kids and comic books in the back
A17 0980  9    seat, and head for home. And where is "home", that
A17 0990  5    magic place of the heart?
A17 0990 10       Ah, that is simple. Home is where a man was born,
A17 1000 11    reared, went to school and, most particularly, where
A17 1010  5    grandma is. That is where we turn in the good old summertime.
A17 1020  4       The land lies ready for the coming onslaught. My
A17 1030  2    husband and I, a month ahead of the rush, have just
A17 1030 13    finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson,
A17 1040 11    Ariz&, to New York City:
A17 1050  3    #SET FOR INFLUX#
A17 1050  6    I can testify that motels, service and comfort stations
A17 1060  4    (they go together like Scots and heather), dog wagons,
A17 1070  2    roadside restaurants, souvenir stands and snake farms
A17 1070  9    are braced and waiting.
A17 1080  3       I hope it can be said without boasting that no other
A17 1090  3    nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety
A17 1090 10    and beauty of scene, such an excellent network of roads
A17 1100  9    on which to enjoy it and such decent, far-flung over-night
A17 1110  7    accommodations.
A17 1110  8       Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry,
A17 1120  6    but it certainly looks that way from the highway.
A17 1130  6       There are motels for all purposes and all tastes.
A17 1140  4    There are even motels for local weather peculiarities,
A17 1150  1    as I discovered in Shamrock, Tex&. There the Royal
A17 1150 10    Motel advertises "all facilities, vented heat, air
A17 1160  7    conditioned, carpeted, free ~TV, storm cellar".
A17 1170  5    #MANY WITH POOLS#
A17 1170  8    Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming
A17 1180  8    pools ("swim at your own risk" is the hospitable sign
A17 1190  7    poised at the brink of most pools). Some even boast
A17 1200  4    two pools, one for adults and one for children. But
A17 1210  1    the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered
A17 1210 12    the comfort and security of a storm cellar.
A17 1220  7       Motorists like myself who can remember the old "tourists
A17 1230  6    accommodated" signs on farm houses and village homes
A17 1240  4    before World War /2, can only marvel at the great size
A17 1250  2    and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing
A17 1250 12    motel business.
A17 1260  1    #ALL FOR $14!#
A17 1260  4    At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester, Va&, we accidentally
A17 1270  4    drew the honeymoon suite, an elegant affair with wall-to-wall
A17 1280  4    carpeting, gold and white furniture, pink satin brocade
A17 1290  1    chairs, 24-inch ~TV and a pink tile bath with masses
A17 1290 12    of pink towels. All for $14.
A17 1300  4       That made up for the "best" motel in Norman, Okla&,
A17 1310  2    where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when
A17 1320  1    we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.
A17 1330  1       Oxnard, Calif&, will be the home of the Rev& Robert
A17 1330 11    D& Howard and his bride, the former Miss Judith Ellen
A17 1340 10    Gay, who were married Saturday at the Munger Place

A17 1390  7    and Perkins School of Theology, ~SMU.
A17 1400  2       Dr& W& B& I& Martin officiated, and the bride was
A17 1410  4    given in marriage by her father. Honor attendants for
A17 1420  1    the couple were Miss Sandra Branum and Warren V& McRoberts.
A17 1430  1       The couple will honeymoon in Sequoia National Park,
A17 1430  9    Calif&.
A17 1450  1       Miss Joan Frances Baker, a graduate of ~SMU, was
A17 1450 10    married Saturday to Elvis Leonard Mason, an honor graduate

A17 1500  2    Kappa Gamma and a member of Mortar Board at ~SMU. Her
A17 1510  1    husband, who is the son of Alton John Mason of Shreveport,
A17 1510 12    La&, and the late Mrs& Henry Cater Parmer, was president
A17 1520 10    of Alpha Tau Omega and a member of Delta Sigma Pi at
A17 1530 11    Lamar Tech, and did graduate work at Rhodes University
A17 1540  6    in Grahamstown, South Africa, on a Rotary Fellowship.
A17 1550  5       The Rev& Richard Freeman of Texas City officiated
A17 1560  4    and Charles Pabor and Mrs& Marvin Hand presented music.
A17 1570  3    The bride was given in marriage by her father.
A17 1580  1       She wore a court-length gown of organdy designed
A17 1580 10    with bateau neckline and princesse skirt accented by
A17 1590  6    lace appliques. Her veil was caught to a crown, and
A17 1600  5    she carried gardenias and stephanotis.
A17 1600 10       Miss Mary Ross of Baird was maid of honor, and bridesmaids
A17 1610 11    were Miss Pat Dawson of Austin, Mrs& Howard M& Dean

A17 1660  6    McEachern of New Orleans, La&. Lee Jackson and Ken
A17 1670  5    Smith, both of Houston, and Alfred Neumann of Beaumont
A17 1680  3    seated guests.
A17 1680  5       After a reception at The Mayfair, the newlyweds
A17 1690  3    left for a wedding trip to New Orleans, La&. They will
A17 1700  2    live in Corpus Christi.
A17 1710  1       Miss Shirley Joan Meredith, a former student of
A17 1710  9    North Texas State University, was married Saturday
A17 1720  6    to Larry W& Mills, who has attended Arlington State
A17 1730  5    College. They will live at 2705 Fitzhugh after a wedding
A17 1740  4    trip to Corpus Christi.
A17 1740  8       Parents of the couple are Ray Meredith of Denton
A17 1750  7    and the late Mrs& Meredith and Mrs& Hardy P& Mills

A17 1770  1       The Rev& Melvin Carter officiated at the ceremony

A17 1780 10    Beam presented music and the bride was given in marriage
A17 1790  9    by her father.
A17 1800  1       She wore a gown of satin designed along princesse
A17 1800  9    lines and featuring a flared skirt and lace jacket
A17 1810  7    with bateau neckline. Her veil was caught to a pearl
A17 1820  5    headdress, and she carried stephanotis and orchids.
A17 1830  1       Miss Glenda Kay Meredith of Denton was her sister's

A17 1840 10    best man. Robert Lovelace and Cedric Burgher Jr& seated

A17 1870  1       The First Christian Church of Pampa was the setting
A17 1870 10    for the wedding last Sunday of Miss Marcile Marie Glison
A17 1880  9    and Thomas Earl Loving Jr&, who will live at 8861 Gaston
A17 1890  9    after a wedding trip to New Orleans, La&

A18 0010  1       "A Night in New Orleans" is the gayety planned by
A18 0010 11    members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont
A18 0020 11    Country Club. The women have a reputation for giving
A18 0030  8    parties that are different and are fun and this year's
A18 0040  7    promises to follow in this fine tradition. Mrs& H&
A18 0050  3    J& Grinsfelder is chairman.
A18 0050  7       The Louisiana city is known, of course, for its
A18 0060  8    fine food, good music and its colorful hospitality
A18 0065  2    "and, when guests arrive at Philmont that night", says
A18 0080  2    Mrs& Grinsfelder, "that is exactly what we expect to
A18 0080 11    offer them. We've been working for weeks. The prospects
A18 0090  9    look great. We are keeping a number of surprises under
A18 0100  9    our hats. But we can't tell it all now and then have
A18 0110  8    no new excitement later".
A18 0110 12    #BASIN STREET BEAT#
A18 0120  2    But she does indicate festivities will start early,
A18 0120 10    that a jazz combo will "give with the Basin Street
A18 0130 10    beat" during the cocktail and dinner hours and that
A18 0140  7    Lester Lanin's orchestra will take over during the
A18 0150  4    dancing.
A18 0150  5       As for food, Mrs& Henry Louchheim, chairman of this
A18 0155  4    phase, is a globetrotter who knows good food. "New
A18 0170  1    Orleans"? she says, "of course I've had the best. It
A18 0180  1    is just bad luck that we are having the party in a
A18 0180 13    month with no ~R's, so no oysters. But we have lots
A18 0190  8    of other New Orleans specialties. I know they will
A18 0200  5    be good. We've tried them out on the club chef- or
A18 0210  4    say, he has tried them out on us and we have selected
A18 0210 16    the best".
A18 0220  1    #SCENIC EFFECTS#
A18 0220  3    Guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic effects.
A18 0230  2    There will be masses of flowers, reproductions of the
A18 0240  1    handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other
A18 0240  9    things that are typical of New Orleans. Mrs& Harry
A18 0250  7    K& Cohen is chairman of this phase and she is getting
A18 0260  6    an artistic assist from A& Van Hollander, display director
A18 0270  3    of Gimbel Brothers.
A18 0270  6       The gala is the Thrift Shop's annual bundle party
A18 0280  5    and, as all Thrift Shop friends know, that means the
A18 0290  5    admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition,
A18 0300  1    contributions of household equipment, bric-a-brac and
A18 0300  9    such to stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters
A18 0310  8    at 1213 Walnut St&.
A18 0320  1    #BUNDLE CENTERS#
A18 0320  3    For the convenience of guests bundle centers have been
A18 0330  3    established throughout the city and suburbs where the
A18 0330 11    donations may be deposited between now and the date
A18 0340  9    of the big event. In addition to the bundles, guests
A18 0350  5    pay the cost of their dinners. Members of the young
A18 0360  4    set who would like to come to the party only during
A18 0360 15    the dancing time are welcomed.
A18 0370  4       The Thrift Shop, with Mrs& Bernhard S& Blumenthal
A18 0380  3    as president, is one of the city's most successful
A18 0390  1    fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies.
A18 0390  9    Some idea of the competence of the women is indicated
A18 0400  9    in the contribution made by them during the past 25
A18 0410  7    years that totals $840,000.
A18 0410 11    #IT'S BIG BUSINESS#
A18 0420  2    "Big business, this little Thrift Shop business", say
A18 0430  2    the members. For most of the 25 years the operation
A18 0430 12    was under feminine direction. In the past few years
A18 0440  7    the men, mostly husbands of members, have taken an
A18 0450  4    interest. Louis Glazer is chairman of the men's committee
A18 0460  2    that, among other jobs, takes over part of the responsibility
A18 0470  1    for staffing the shop during its evening hours.
A18 0470  9       Mrs& Theodore Kapnek is vice chairman of the committee
A18 0480  8    for the gala. Mrs& Richard Newburger is chairman of
A18 0490  6    hostesses.
A18 0490  7       Mrs& Arthur Loeb is making arrangements for a reception;
A18 0500  8    Mrs& Joan Lichtenstein, for publicity; Mrs& Harry M&
A18 0510  6    Rose, Jr&, for secretarial duties; Mrs& Ralph Taussig,
A18 0520  5    for junior aides; Mr& and Mrs& B& Lewis Kaufnabb, for
A18 0530  6    senior aides, and Mrs& Samuel P& Weinberg, for the
A18 0540  5    bundles.
A18 0540  6       In addition, Mr& and Mrs& Allan Goodman are controllers,
A18 0550  5    Mrs& Paul Stone is treasurer and Mrs& Albert Quell
A18 0560  5    is in charge of admittance for the dancing at 9 P&
A18 0570  4    M&.
A18 0570  5       Besides the bundle centers where contributions may
A18 0580  2    be made there will be facilities at Philmont Country
A18 0580 11    Club for those who would like to bring the bundles
A18 0590 10    on the night of the party.
A18 0610  1       The women's committee of St& David's Church will
A18 0610  9    hold its annual pre-Fair pink parade, a dessert bridge
A18 0620 10    and fashion show at 1 P& M& on Monday, April 17, in

A18 0650  1    which includes Mrs& James A& Moody, Mrs& Frank C& Wilkinson,

A18 0710  3    Clyde Newman.
A18 0710  5       The fashion show, by Natalie Collett will have Mrs&
A18 0720  5    John Newbold as commentator. Models will be Mrs& Samuel
A18 0730  4    B& D& Baird, Mrs& William H& Meyle, Jr&, Mrs& Richard

A18 0770  2    Frederick C& Wheeler, Jr&, Mrs& William ~A Boyd, ~Mrs
A18 0780  6    F& Vernon Putt.
A18 0790  1       Col& Clifton Lisle, of Chester Springs, who headed
A18 0790  9    the Troop Committee for much of its second and third
A18 0800  9    decades, is now an honorary member. Each year he invites
A18 0810  6    the boys to camp out on his estate for one of their
A18 0820  5    big week ends of the year.
A18 0820 11       The Troop is proud of its camping-out program- on
A18 0830  7    year-round schedule and was continued even when sub-zero
A18 0840  5    temperatures were registered during the past winter.
A18 0850  2       "We worry", say the mothers. "But there never is
A18 0860  1    any need. The boys love it".
A18 0860  7       Mrs& John Charles Cotty is chairman of publicity
A18 0870  5    for the country fair and Mrs& Francis G& Felske and
A18 0880  3    Mrs& Francis Smythe, of posters. They all are of Wayne.
A18 0900  1       "Meet the Artist" is the invitation issued by members
A18 0900 10    of the Greater Philadelphia Section of the National
A18 0910  8    Council of Jewish Women as they arrange for an annual
A18 0920  8    exhibit and sale of paintings and sculpture at the
A18 0930  5    Philmont Country Club on April 8 and 9.
A18 0940  1       A preview party for sponsors of the event and for
A18 0940 11    the artists is set for April 8. The event will be open
A18 0950  9    to the public the following day. Proceeds will be used
A18 0960  5    by the section to further its program in science, education
A18 0970  2    and social action on local, national and international
A18 0980  1    levels.
A18 0980  2    #NOTED ARTIST#
A18 0980  4    Mrs& Monte Tyson, chairman, says the work of 100 artists
A18 0990  5    well known in the Delaware Valley area will be included
A18 1000  2    in the exhibition and sale. Among them will be Marc

A18 1020  8    a portrait of the family of the person who wins the
A18 1030  6    door prize.
A18 1030  8       The event is the sixth on the annual calendar of
A18 1040  5    the local members of the National Council of Jewish
A18 1050  2    Women. It originated with the Wissahickon Section.
A18 1050  9    When this and other units combined to form the present

A18 1780  5    Pierson was chosen to rule over the festivities, presented
A18 1790  3    at the Muncipal Auditorium and chosen as her ladies
A18 1800  2    in waiting were Misses Clayton Nairne, Eleanor Eustis,
A18 1800 10    Lynn Chapman, Irwin Leatherman of Robinsonville, Miss&
A18 1810  7    and Helene Rowley. The large municipal hall was ablaze
A18 1820  8    with color, which shown out from the bright array of
A18 1830  7    chic ballgowns worn by those participating in the "maskers'
A18 1840  4    dances".
A18 1840  5       The mother of young queen, Mrs& G& Henry Pierson
A18 1850  5    Jr& chose a white brocade gown made on slim lines with
A18 1860  5    panels of tomato-red and bright green satin extending
A18 1870  1    down the back. Mrs& Thomas Jordan selected a black
A18 1870 10    taffeta frock made with a skirt of fringed tiers and
A18 1880  9    worn with crimson silk slippers. Mrs& Clayton Nairne,
A18 1890  4    whose daughter, was among the court maids, chose a
A18 1900  3    deep greenish blue lace gown. Mrs& Fenwick Eustis,
A18 1900 11    whose daughter was also a maid to the queen, wore an
A18 1910 11    ashes of roses slipper satin gown. Mrs& Peter Feringa
A18 1920  6    Jr&, last year's Achaeans' queen, chose an eggshell
A18 1930  5    white filmy lace short dress made with a wide decolletage
A18 1940  4    trimmed with an edging of tulle. Mrs& Eustis Reily's
A18 1945  1    olive-green street length silk taffeta dress was embroidered
A18 1950  8    on the bodice with gold threads and golden sequins
A18 1960  9    and beads.
A19 0010  1       The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday
A19 0010  8    it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by
A19 0020  9    10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective
A19 0030  6    at 12.01 A&M& next Saturday. The current monthly payroll
A19 0040  4    comes to about $15,000,000.
A19 0040  8       Howard E& Simpson, the railroad's president, said,
A19 0050  6    "A drastic decline in freight loading due principally
A19 0060  5    to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods
A19 0070  4    has necessitated this regrettable action".
A19 0070  9       The reduction in expenses will affect employees
A19 0080  7    in the thirteen states in which the B& + O& operates.
A19 0090  7    #SALARY CUT AND LAY-OFFS#
A19 0090 12    It will be accomplished in two ways:
A19 0100  7    _1._
A19 0100  8       A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of
A19 0110  6    all officers, supervisors and other employees not belonging
A19 0120  3    to unions. There are about 3,325 officers and employees
A19 0130  1    in this class.
A19 0130  4    _2._
A19 0130  5       Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring
A19 0140  2    about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense.
A19 0140 13       Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual
A19 0150  9    union members under contract, it must accomplish its
A19 0160  7    payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough,
A19 0170  6    a B&+O& spokesman said.
A19 0170 10       Those union members kept on their jobs, therefore,
A19 0180  8    will not take a cut in their wages.
A19 0190  2       The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot
A19 0200  1    be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out
A19 0200 11    in each area depending on what men are most needed
A19 0210  7    on the job.
A19 0220  1       A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol
A19 0220 13    last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and
A19 0230  9    Mount streets.
A19 0230 11       The victim, Norman B& Wiley, 38, of the 900 block
A19 0240 10    North Charles street, was treated for cuts at Franklin
A19 0250  7    Square Hospital after the robbery.
A19 0260  1       The driver told police he followed as the Negro
A19 0260 10    man got out of the cab with his money. The victim was
A19 0270 11    beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit.
A19 0280  5       He said the assailant, who was armed with a .45-caliber
A19 0290  5    automatic, entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue
A19 0300  1    and Gold street.
A19 0300  4       In another attack, Samuel Verstandig, 41, proprietor
A19 0310  2    of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street, told
A19 0310 13    police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole
A19 0320 10    $150 from the cash register after choking and beating
A19 0330  6    him.
A19 0340  1       A baby was burned to death and two other children
A19 0340 11    were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged
A19 0350  9    their one-room Anne Arundel county home.
A19 0360  3       The victim Darnell Somerville, Negro, 1, was pronounced
A19 0370  3    dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in
A19 0380  2    Annapolis.
A19 0380  3       His sister and brother, Marie Louise, 3, and John
A19 0390  2    Raymond, Jr& 22 months, were admitted to the hospital.
A19 0390 11    The girl was in critical condition with burns over
A19 0400  9    90 per cent of her body.
A19 0410  1    #BOY IN FAIR CONDITION#
A19 0410  5    The boy received second-degree burns of the face, neck
A19 0420  4    and back. His condition was reported to be fair.
A19 0430  1       Police said the children's mother, Mrs& Eleanor
A19 0430  8    Somerville, was visiting next door when the fire occurred.
A19 0440  9       The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south
A19 0450  8    of Severna Park, at Jones Station, police said.
A19 0470  1    _ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_
A19 0470  4       - The Anne Arundel county school superintendent
A19 0480  1    has asked that the Board of Education return to the
A19 0480 11    practice of recording its proceedings mechanically
A19 0490  6    so that there will be no more question about who said
A19 0500  5    what.
A19 0500  6       The proposal was made by Dr& David S& Jenkins after
A19 0510  5    he and Mrs& D& Ellwood Williams, Jr&, a board member
A19 0520  4    and long-time critic of the superintendent, argued
A19 0530  1    for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting.
A19 0530  9       The disagreement was over what Dr& Jenkins had said
A19 0540  8    at a previous session and how his remarks appeared
A19 0550  6    in the minutes presented at the following meeting.
A19 0560  2    #CITES DISCREPANCIES#
A19 0560  4    Mrs& Williams had a list which she said contained about
A19 0570  5    nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr&
A19 0580  3    Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up
A19 0580 11    for the board's approval.
A19 0590  4       "I hate to have these things come up again and again",
A19 0600  5    Dr& Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion. "These
A19 0610  2    are the board's minutes. I'll write what you tell me
A19 0620  2    to".
A19 0620  3       For a number of years the board used a machine to
A19 0630  1    keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice
A19 0630  9    about two years ago.
A19 0640  1       It was about that time, a board member said later,
A19 0640 11    that Dr& Thomas G& Pullen, Jr&, State superintendent
A19 0650  3    of schools, told Dr& Jenkins and a number of other
A19 0660  8    education officials that he would not talk to them
A19 0670  5    with a recording machine sitting in front of him.
A19 0680  1       The Board of County Commissioners, the Sanitary
A19 0680  8    Commission, the Planning and Zoning Board and other
A19 0690  8    county official bodies use recording machines for all
A19 0700  6    public business in order to prevent law suits and other
A19 0710  4    misunderstandings about what actually happened at their
A19 0720  1    meetings.
A19 0720  2       Dr& Jenkins notes, however, that most of the school
A19 0730  2    boards in the State do not do so.
A19 0740  1       State Senator Joseph A& Bertorelli (D&, First Baltimore)
A19 0750  1    had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the
A19 0750 11    200 block of West Pratt street.
A19 0760  5       He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal
A19 0770  4    ambulance.
A19 0770  5       Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed
A19 0780  3    on the right side. His condition was said to be, "fair".
A19 0790  2       Police said he became ill while parked in front
A19 0790 11    of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street.
A19 0800  9    #BARBER SUMMONED#
A19 0800 11    He called Vincent L& Piraro, proprietor of the shop,
A19 0810  8    who summoned police and an ambulance.
A19 0830  1       The vice president of the City Council complained
A19 0830  9    yesterday that there are "deficiencies" in the city's
A19 0840  8    snow clearing program which should be corrected as
A19 0850  6    soon as possible.
A19 0850  9       Councilman William D& Schaefer (D&, Fifth) said
A19 0860  6    in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting
A19 0870  5    crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should
A19 0880  3    be kept on the job longer than they were last month.
A19 0880 14    #WERNER CRITICIZED#
A19 0890  2    Conceding that several cities to the north were in
A19 0900  2    worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm, Mr&
A19 0900 11    Schaefer listed several improvements he said should
A19 0910  7    be made in the snow plan here.
A19 0920  1       He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly
A19 0920 12    in December. Equipment should be in operation "almost
A19 0930  7    immediately after the first snowfall", Mr& Schaefer
A19 0940  5    said.
A19 0940  6       The Councilman, who is the Administration floor
A19 0950  6    leader, also criticized Bernard L& Werner, public works
A19 0960  4    director, for "halting snow operations" on Tuesday
A19 0970  2    night after the Sunday storm.
A19 0970  7    #SENT HOME FOR REST#
A19 0970 11    Mr& Werner said yesterday that operations continued
A19 0980  7    through the week. What he did, Mr& Werner said, was
A19 0990  8    let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some
A19 1000  4    rest. Work resumed Wednesday, he said.
A19 1010  1       Mr& Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency
A19 1010  8    route plan, under which parking is banned on key streets
A19 1020  9    and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on
A19 1030  7    them, should be "strictly enforced".
A19 1040  1       Admitting that main streets and the central business
A19 1040  9    district should have priority, the Councilman said
A19 1050  7    it is also essential that small shopping areas "not
A19 1060  5    be overlooked **h if our small merchants are to survive".
A19 1070  3       Recounting personal observations of clearance work,
A19 1080  2    the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of
A19 1080 10    equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and
A19 1090  8    urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave
A19 1100  7    behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes.
A19 1120  1    _ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7 (SPECIAL)_
A19 1120  5       - The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney
A19 1130  4    and his wife, who were murdered early today in their
A19 1140  2    Chesapeake Bay-front home, has been sent to Spring
A19 1140 11    Grove State Hospital for detention.
A19 1150  4       The victims were H& Malone Dresbach, 47, and his
A19 1160  4    wife, Shirley, 46. Each had been shot in the back several
A19 1170  2    times with a .22-caliber automatic rifle, according
A19 1170 10    to Capt& Elmer Hagner, chief of Anne Arundel detectives.
A19 1180  8       Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding
A19 1190  7    the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile
A19 1200  7    accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail. The
A19 1210  4    Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing
A19 1220  3    in Juvenile Court.
A19 1220  6       #YOUNGER SON CALLS POLICE#
A19 1230  1    Soon after 10 A&M&, when police reached the 1-1/2-story
A19 1230 12    brick home in the Franklin Manor section, 15 miles
A19 1250  8    south of here on the bay, in response to a call from
A19 1260  6    the Dresbach's other son, Lee, 14, they found Mrs&
A19 1270  3    Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor. Her
A19 1280  1    husband was lying on the kitchen floor, police said.
A19 1280 10       The younger son told police his brother had run
A19 1290  8    from the house after the shootings and had driven away
A19 1300  5    in their mother's car.
A19 1300  9       The description of the car was immediately broadcast
A19 1310  7    throughout Southern Maryland on police radio.
A19 1320  4    #TWO BROTHERS ADOPTED#
A19 1320  7    Police said the boys are natural brothers and were
A19 1330  6    adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.
A19 1340  1       Trooper J& A& Grzesiak spotted the wanted car, with
A19 1360  1    three boys, at a Route 2 service station, just outside
A19 1360 11    Annapolis. The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs'
A19 1370  7    son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station,
A19 1380  5    police said.
A19 1390  1    _ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_

A19 1400  2    his administrative assistant, as Maryland's Secretary
A19 1410  1    of State.
A19 1410  3       Mr& Simpkins will move into the post being vacated
A19 1420  1    by Thomas B& Finan, earlier named attorney general
A19 1420  9    to succeed C& Ferdinand Sybert, who will be elevated
A19 1430  8    to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of
A19 1440  6    Appeals.
A19 1440  7       Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in
A19 1450  6    ceremony will be held in his office next Friday.
A19 1460  3    #SIMPKINS FROM SOMERSET#
A19 1460  6    Mr& Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county, and
A19 1470  5    he and the Governor, also a Somerset countian, have
A19 1480  2    been friends since Mr& Simpkins was a child.
A19 1490  1       Now 38, Mr& Simpkins was graduated from the University
A19 1490  9    of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947.
A19 1500  6       Five years later, he was awarded the university's
A19 1510  5    degree in law.
A19 1510  8       Mr& Simpkins made a name for himself as a member
A19 1520  9    of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958. From
A19 1530  5    the outset of his first term, he established himself
A19 1540  2    as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.
A19 1550  1       MARYLAND contracts for future construction during
A19 1550  7    October totaled $77,389,000, up to 10 per cent compared
A19 1560  9    to October, 1960, F& W& Dodge, Dodge Corporation, reported.
A19 1570  6       Dodge reported the following breakdown:

A19 1600  2    engineering at $9,841,000, down 45 per cent.
A19 1600  9       The cumulative total of construction contracts for
A19 1610  6    the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000,
A19 1620  3    a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding
A19 1630  1    period of last year.
A19 1630  5       A breakdown of the ten-month total showed:
A19 1640  2       Nonresidential at $253,355,000, up 22 per cent;
A19 1640  9    residential at $278,877,000, up 12 per cent; and heavy
A19 1650  9    engineering at $102,285,000, down 33 per cent.
A19 1660  6       Residential building consists of houses, apartments,
A19 1670  4    hotels, dormitories and other buildings designed for
A19 1680  2    shelter.
A19 1690  1       The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments,
A19 1690 11    which began about six years ago, has more than tripled
A19 1700 10    within that span of time.
A19 1710  2       In 1961, it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings
A19 1720  1    will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in
A19 1720 12    residential construction.
A19 1730  1       While availability of mortgage money has been a
A19 1730  9    factor in encouraging apartment construction, the generally
A19 1740  7    high level of prosperity in the past few years plus
A19 1750  8    rising consumer income are among the factors that have
A19 1760  5    encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building
A19 1770  1    field.
A19 1770  2       Although economic and personal circumstances vary
A19 1780  2    widely among those now choosing apartments, Leo J&
A19 1780 10    Pantas, vice president of a hardware manufacturing
A19 1790  7    company, pointed out recently that many apartment seekers
A19 1800  5    seem to have one characteristic in common: a desire
A19 1810  3    for greater convenience and freedom from the problems
A19 1820  1    involved in maintaining a house.
A19 1820  6    #CONVENIENCE HELD KEY#
A19 1820  9    "Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market
A19 1830  9    today. Trouble-free, long-life, quality components
A19 1840  5    will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising
A19 1850  5    of new housing in 1960", Pantas predicted.
A19 1870  1       SIXTY-SEVEN living units are being added to the
A19 1870 10    165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill
A19 1880  8    section.
A19 1880  9       Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units,
A19 1890  7    in two-story and three-story structures. Various of
A19 1900  4    the apartments are of the terrace type, being on the
A19 1910  3    ground floor so that entrance is direct. Others, which
A19 1910 12    are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs,
A19 1920 10    have balconies.
A19 1930  1       The structures housing the apartments are of masonry
A19 1930  9    and frame construction. Heating is by individual gas-fired,
A19 1940  7    forced warm air systems.
A19 1960  1       CONSTRUCTION in 1962 will account for about 15 per
A19 1960 10    cent of the gross national product, according to a
A19 1970  8    study by Johns-Manville Corporation.
A20 0010  1    _LONDON, FEB& 9_
A20 0010  4       - Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine,
A20 0020  2    the Dreadnought, and, by implication, of the entire
A20 0020 10    United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet,
A20 0030  8    were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring, secret
A20 0040  7    service agents testified today.
A20 0050  1       The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by
A20 0050  9    the United States in 1959 and was launched last year.
A20 0060  9    It is a killer sub- that is, a hunter of enemy subs.
A20 0070  7    It has a hull patterned on that of the United States
A20 0080  3    navy's Nautilus, the world's first atomic submarine.
A20 0090  1    Its power unit, however, was derived from the reactor
A20 0090 10    of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack.
A20 0100  6    #FIVE HELD FOR TRIAL#
A20 0110  1    The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought
A20 0110  9    had been stolen was made in Bow st& police court here
A20 0120  9    at the end of a three day hearing. A full trial was
A20 0130  6    ordered for:
A20 0130  8       Two British civil servants, Miss Ethel Gee, 46,
A20 0140  6    and her newly devoted friend, Harry Houghton, 55, and
A20 0150  4    divorced. They are accused of whisking secrets out
A20 0160  1    of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard.
A20 0160  9       Gordon A& Lonsdale, 37, a mystery man presumed to
A20 0170  8    be Russian altho he carries a Canadian passport. When
A20 0180  5    arrested, he had the submarine secrets on a roll of
A20 0190  5    candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets
A20 0190 14    in Christmas gift wrapping, it was testified.
A20 0200  7    #FLASHED TO MOSCOW#
A20 0200 10    A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger,
A20 0210  8    bookseller, and wife, Joyce.
A20 0220  2       [In Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
A20 0230  1    identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen, an
A20 0230 10    American couple formerly of New York City.]
A20 0240  7       In their suburban cottage the crown charges, the
A20 0250  6    Krogers received secrets from the mystery man, usually
A20 0260  3    on the first Saturday evening of each month, and spent
A20 0270  2    much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow,
A20 0270 13    either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen
A20 0280  9    floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books.
A20 0290  7    Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition
A20 0300  4    as a drawing, a printed page, or a manuscript.
A20 0310  1       All five pleaded innocent. Only Miss Gee asked for
A20 0310 10    bail. Her young British lawyer, James Dunlop, pleaded
A20 0320  8    that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by
A20 0330  7    her widowed mother, 80, her maiden aunt, also 80 and
A20 0340  5    bedridden for 20 years, and her uncle, 76, who once
A20 0350  1    ran a candy shop.
A20 0350  5    #REFUSES TO GRANT BAIL#
A20 0350  9    "I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them", said
A20 0360  8    the magistrate, K&J&P& Baraclough.
A20 0370  1       The trial will be held, probably the first week
A20 0370 10    of March, in the famous Old Bailey central criminal
A20 0380  9    court where Klaus Fuchs, the naturalized British German
A20 0390  6    born scientist who succeeded in giving American and
A20 0400  5    British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed
A20 0410  3    world history during the 1950s, was sentenced to 14
A20 0410 12    years in prison.
A20 0420  3       Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced
A20 0430  1    by the new five, who may have altered history in the
A20 0430 12    1960s. Fuchs, after nine and a half years, was released,
A20 0440  9    being given time off for good behavior. He promptly
A20 0450  4    went to communist East Germany.
A20 0450  9       The magistrate tonight refused to return to the
A20 0460  8    five $29,000 in American and British currency, mostly
A20 0470  5    $20 bills, and in British government bonds and stocks.
A20 0480  4       "This is Russian money", said Mervin Griffith-Jones
A20 0490  1    for the attorney general's office. He asserted that
A20 0500  1    the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow, Lonsdale the
A20 0500 10    Red paymaster, and the two civil servants the recipients
A20 0510  8    for selling their country's secrets.
A20 0520  2    #"OF HIGHEST VALUE"#
A20 0520  5    The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought, and thereby
A20 0530  5    of the American undersea fleet, were involved in the
A20 0540  3    spy case had been hinted at earlier.
A20 0540 10       But just before luncheon today the fact was announced
A20 0550  7    grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet
A20 0560  6    on underwater warfare, Capt& George Symonds. He said
A20 0570  4    that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details
A20 0580  2    about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped
A20 0580 11    roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested
A20 0590  9    with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater
A20 0600  6    Saturday afternoon, Jan& 7.
A20 0610  1       The information, he said, would have been of the
A20 0610 10    highest value to a potential enemy.
A20 0620  4    #COURT CLEARED#
A20 0620  6    Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when
A20 0630  5    the ring, watched for six months, was broken remained
A20 0640  2    untold.
A20 0640  3       The British defending lawyers, who today increased
A20 0650  1    from three to four, demanded to know if they could
A20 0650 11    make the information involved seem of little value
A20 0660  6    to a jury, the chances of their clients would improve.
A20 0670  4    So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the
A20 0680  2    court of all except officials to allow the captain
A20 0680 11    to elaborate for almost an hour.
A20 0690  5       Almost any information about the Dreadnought would
A20 0700  2    also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet.
A20 0710  1    Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere
A20 0710 11    until the American government decided to end a ban
A20 0720  7    on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been
A20 0730  5    imposed after Fuchs blabbed. The United States offered
A20 0740  3    to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like
A20 0750  1    that used in the Skipjack.
A20 0750  6       With the machinery went a complete design for the
A20 0760  4    hull.
A20 0760  5       The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub,
A20 0770  3    much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which
A20 0770 13    preceded it.
A20 0780  2    #NAVY'S FUTURE INVOLVED#
A20 0780  5    "Much of the navy's future depends upon her", an American
A20 0790  6    naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival
A20 0800  4    in British waters in August, 1959, for exhibition to
A20 0810  2    selected high officers at Portland underwater research
A20 0810  9    station. It was there that the two accused civil servants
A20 0820 10    were at work.
A20 0830  1       "Her basic hull form [a teardrop] and her nuclear
A20 0830 10    power plant will be used for almost all new submarines,
A20 0840 10    including the potent Polaris missile submarines", the
A20 0850  5    statement went on.
A20 0850  8       The atom reactor, water cooled, was the result of
A20 0860  8    almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch
A20 0870  6    of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric
A20 0880  2    Corp&. Thru development, the reactor and its steam
A20 0890  2    turbines had been reduced greatly in size, and also
A20 0890 11    in complexity, allowing a single propeller to be used,
A20 0900  8    the navy said.
A20 0900 11       The hull was also a result of almost a decade of
A20 0910 11    work. It was first tried out on a conventional submarine,
A20 0920  6    the Albacore, in 1954.
A20 0920 10       The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built.
A20 0930  8    Reputedly it could outrun, underwater, the fastest
A20 0940  5    destroyers. It could, reputedly, go 70,000 miles without
A20 0950  4    refueling and stay down more than a month.
A20 0960  1       It was of the hunter-killer type, designed to seek
A20 0960 10    out ships and other submarines with its most advance
A20 0970  6    gear and destroy them with torpedoes.
A20 0980  1       The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions
A20 0980 11    found in Miss Gee's purse would, if completed and handed
A20 0990 10    back, have given the Kremlin a complete picture "of
A20 1000  8    our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown
A20 1010  6    what we are doing in research and development for the
A20 1020  3    future".
A20 1020  4    #INTERESTED IN DETECTOR#
A20 1020  7    The spy ring also was particularly interested in ~ASDIC,
A20 1030  6    the underwater equipment for detecting submarines,
A20 1040  4    it was testified. Range was a vital detail. Designs
A20 1050  2    of parts were sought.
A20 1050  6       Six radiomen told how, twice on two days after the
A20 1060  6    ring was nabbed, a transmitter near Moscow was heard
A20 1070  2    calling, using signals, times and wavelengths specified
A20 1070  9    on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's
A20 1080  8    apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened
A20 1090  6    to the transmitter lid. Oddly, the calls were still
A20 1100  5    heard 11 days after the five were arrested.
A20 1110  1       The charge that the federal indictment of three
A20 1110  9    Chicago narcotics detail detectives "is the product
A20 1120  6    of rumor, combined with malice, and individual enmity"
A20 1130  4    on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was
A20 1140  2    made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge
A20 1140 10    Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court.
A20 1150  7       The three- Miles J& Cooperman, Sheldon Teller, and
A20 1160  5    Richard Austin- and eight other defendants are charged
A20 1170  4    in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal
A20 1180  2    narcotic laws.
A20 1180  4       In his opening statement to a jury of eight women
A20 1190  4    and four men, Bernard H& Sokol, attorney for the detectives,
A20 1200  1    said that evidence would show that his clients were
A20 1200 10    "entirely innocent".
A20 1210  2    #'HAD TO KNOW PEDDLERS'#
A20 1210  6    "When they became members of the city police narcotics
A20 1220  7    unit", Sokol said, "they were told they would have
A20 1230  5    to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics
A20 1240  2    were sold and they would have to get to know people
A20 1240 13    in the narcotics racket. They, on occasion, posed as
A20 1250  9    addicts and peddlers".
A20 1260  1       Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes
A20 1260  8    worked together, Sokol continued, rivalries developed
A20 1280  3    when they were "aiming at the same criminals". This,
A20 1290  6    he added, brought about "petty jealousies" and "petty
A20 1300  3    personal grievances".
A20 1300  5       "In the same five year period that the United States
A20 1310  8    says they [the detectives] were engaged in this conspiracy",
A20 1320  6    Sokol continued, "these three young men received a
A20 1330  5    total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations,
A20 1340  2    and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the
A20 1350  1    mayor's medal".
A20 1350  3    #NO COMMENTS BY U&S&#
A20 1350  7    In opening, D& Arthur Connelly, assistant United States
A20 1360  6    attorney, read the indictment, but made no comments.
A20 1370  5    Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only
A20 1380  3    that there was no proof of their clients' guilt.
A20 1390  1       Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700
A20 1390  8    worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler, Otis
A20 1400  7    Sears, 45, of 6934 Indiana av&. Among other acts, Teller
A20 1410  5    and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears.
A20 1420  3       The first witness, Moses Winston Mardis, 5835 Michigan
A20 1430  2    av&, a real estate agent and former bail bondsman,
A20 1430 11    took the stand after opening statements had been made.
A20 1440  8    But court adjourned after he testified he introduced
A20 1450  5    James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings, two of the
A20 1460  4    defendants, and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy,
A20 1470  2    a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted.
A20 1480  1       Buaford Robinson, 23, of 7026 Stewart av&, a ~CTA
A20 1480 10    bus driver, was slugged and robbed last night by a
A20 1490 10    group of youths at 51st street and South Park way.
A20 1500  6    Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a
A20 1510  4    cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee.
A20 1520  1    His losses included his money bag, containing $40 to
A20 1520 10    $50 and his $214 paycheck.
A20 1530  2       Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd
A20 1540  2    of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded
A20 1540 11    his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational
A20 1550  9    High school, 30th street and South Park way, and began
A20 1560  8    "skylarking".
A20 1560  9       When 51st street was reached, Robinson related,
A20 1570  7    he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going
A20 1580  6    to call the ~CTA supervisor. As he left the bus with
A20 1590  4    his money bag, Robinson added, the largest youth accosted
A20 1600  1    him, a quarrel ensued, and the youth knocked him down.
A20 1600 11    Then the youths fled with his money.
A20 1620  1       Mrs& Blanche Dunkel, 60, who has spent 25 years
A20 1620 10    in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder
A20 1630  7    in 1935 of her son-in-law, Ervin Lang, then 28, appealed
A20 1640  5    for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois
A20 1650  3    pardon and parole board members, John M& Bookwalter
A20 1660  1    and Joseph Carpentier. She had been sentenced to 180
A20 1660 10    years in prison, but former Gov& Stratton commuted
A20 1670  7    her term to 75 years, making her eligible for parole,
A20 1680  5    as one of his last acts in office.
A20 1690  1       Mrs& Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the
A20 1690 10    son-in-law became her lover after the death of her
A20 1700  8    daughter in 1934. It was when he attempted to end the
A20 1710  5    relationship that the murder took place.
A20 1720  1       The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined
A20 1720 10    $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for
A20 1730  9    leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase
A20 1740  6    over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan& 20.
A20 1750  2       The defendant, William L& Stickney /3, 23, of 3211
A20 1760  2    Park pl&, Evanston, who pleaded guilty to reckless
A20 1760 10    driving, also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to
A20 1770  8    attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night
A20 1780  5    for one month.
A20 1780  8       Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing, Inc&, 2544
A20 1790  6    Green Bay rd&, Evanston, a food brokerage and grocery
A20 1800  5    chain firm, of which his father, William L& Jr&, is
A20 1810  3    president.
A20 1810  4       Patrolman James F& Simms said he started in pursuit
A20 1820  5    when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart
A20 1830  1    avenue at Central street.
A20 1830  5       At Jenks street, Simms said, the car skidded completely
A20 1840  5    around, just missed two parked cars, and sped east
A20 1850  3    in Jenks.
A20 1850  5       The car spun around again, Simms said, before Stickney
A20 1860  3    could turn north in Prairie avenue, and then violated
A20 1870  1    two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette
A20 1870 10    in Prairie.
A21 0010  1    _ST& JOHNS, MICH&, APRIL 19._
A21 0010  6       - A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old
A21 0020  6    Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the
A21 0030  3    bludgeon slaying of Mrs& Anna Hengesbach.
A21 0030  9       Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion.
A21 0040  7    He returned to his cell in the county jail, where he
A21 0050  7    has been held since his arrest last July, without a
A21 0060  3    word to his court-appointed attorney, Jack Walker,
A21 0060 11    or his guard.
A21 0070  2    #STEPSON VINDICATED#
A21 0070  4    The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's
A21 0080  4    stepson, Vincent Hengesbach, 54, who was tried for
A21 0090  2    the same crime in December, 1958, and released when
A21 0090 11    the jury failed to reach a verdict. Mrs& Hengesbach
A21 0100  7    was killed on Aug& 31, 1958.
A21 0110  1       Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since.
A21 0110 10    When the verdict came in against his young neighbor,
A21 0120  9    Hengesbach said:
A21 0130  1       "I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion
A21 0130 11    removed. Still, I don't wish to appear happy at somebody's
A21 0140  9    else's misfortune".
A21 0150  1    #LIVES ON WELFARE#
A21 0150  4    Hengesbach, who has been living on welfare recently,
A21 0160  2    said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled
A21 0160 12    by his grandfather in Westphalia, 27 miles southwest
A21 0170  8    of here.
A21 0180  1       Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since
A21 0180  8    his house and barn were burned down after his release
A21 0190  6    in 1958.
A21 0190  8       Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned
A21 0200  5    about several fires in the Westphalia area by State
A21 0210  3    Police.
A21 0210  4       He also admitted killing Mrs& Hengesbach. However,
A21 0220  2    the confession, which was the only evidence against
A21 0220 10    him, was retracted before the trial.
A21 0230  6    #CHARGES IN DOUBT#
A21 0230  9    Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis, who tried both the
A21 0240  7    Hengesbach and Pohl cases, said he did not know what
A21 0250  7    would be done about two arson charges pending against
A21 0260  2    Pohl.
A21 0260  3       Circuit Judge Paul R& Cash did not set a date for
A21 0270  4    sentencing. Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in
A21 0270 14    prison or probation.
A21 0280  3       Walker said he was considering filing a motion for
A21 0290  2    a new trial which would contend that the verdict was
A21 0290 12    against the weight of the evidence and that there were
A21 0300  9    several errors in trial procedure.
A21 0310  2    #LOCKED IN MOTEL#
A21 0310  5    A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p&m& after almost
A21 0320  4    13-1/2 hours of deliberation. The jury, which was locked
A21 0330  3    up in a motel overnight, was canvassed at the request
A21 0330 13    of Walker after the verdict was announced.
A21 0340  7       The jury foreman, Mrs& Olive Heideman, of rural
A21 0350  5    Elsie, said that a ballot was not even taken until
A21 0360  3    yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation
A21 0370  1    was spent in going over the evidence.
A21 0370  8       She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession
A21 0380  4    was valid.
A21 0380  6       The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written
A21 0390  7    definition of the difference between first and second-degree
A21 0400  4    murder and manslaughter.
A21 0400  7       The verdict came three hours later.
A21 0410  4       Some 30 spectators remained in the court during
A21 0420  1    the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read.
A21 0420 12    The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than
A21 0430  8    a week.
A21 0440  1       A Sterling Township family of six surviving children,
A21 0440  9    whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire
A21 0450 10    that also killed one of the children, found today they
A21 0460  7    had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends.
A21 0470  4       While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's
A21 0480  3    duties, fund-raising events were being planned by a
A21 0480 12    homeowners association and a student council for the
A21 0490  8    hard-hit Henry Kowalski family, 34220 Viceroy.
A21 0500  4       Mrs& Eleanor Kowalski, 42, died yesterday afternoon
A21 0510  4    in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire
A21 0520  4    that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night
A21 0520 12    at the flat of her widowed mother, Mrs& Mary Pankowski,
A21 0530  9    in the adjoining suburb of Warren.
A21 0540  4    #SERVICES TOMORROW#
A21 0540  6    Funeral services for Mrs& Kowalski and her daughter,
A21 0550  5    Christine, 11, who died of burns at the same hospital
A21 0560  4    Monday, have been scheduled for 10 a&m& tomorrow in
A21 0570  2    St& Anne's Catholic Church, 31978 Mound, in Warren.
A21 0575  1       The mother and daughter, who will be buried side
A21 0580  9    by side in Mt& Olivet Cemetery, rested together today
A21 0590  5    in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home,
A21 0600  3    31730 Mound, Warren.
A21 0600  6       Mrs& Pankowski, 61, remained in Holy Cross Hospital
A21 0610  7    as a result of the explosion, which occurred while
A21 0620  4    Mrs& Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's
A21 0630  1    small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile road east.
A21 0630 10    #HELD CANDLE#
A21 0640  2    Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes
A21 0650  1    apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the
A21 0650 11    three Kowalski girls present held for her mother, because
A21 0660  8    the flat lacked electricity.
A21 0670  1       Christine's twin sister, Patricia, and Darlene Kowalski,
A21 0680  1    8, escaped with minor burns. They are home now with
A21 0680 11    the other Kowalski children, Vicky, 14; Dennis, 6;
A21 0690  6    Eleanor, 2; and Bernardine, 1.
A21 0700  2       "All we have left in the world is one another, and
A21 0700 13    we must stay together the way Mother wanted", Kowalski
A21 0710  9    said in telling his children of their mother's death
A21 0720  7    yesterday afternoon.
A21 0730  1       Kowalski, a roofer who seldom worked last winter,
A21 0730  8    already was in arrears on their recently purchased
A21 0740  5    split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with
A21 0750  3    medical and funeral bills.
A21 0750  7    #$135 DONATED#
A21 0750  9    Neighbor women, such as Mrs& Sidney Baker, 2269 Serra,
A21 0760  9    Sterling Township, have been supplying the family with
A21 0770  7    meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's
A21 0780  3    sister-in-law, Mrs& Anna Kowalski, 22111 David, East
A21 0790  3    Detroit.
A21 0790  4       Another neighbor, Mrs& Frank C& Smith, 2731 Pall
A21 0800  4    Mall, Sterling Township, surprised Kowalski by coming
A21 0810  2    to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward
A21 0810 11    the $400 funeral costs.
A21 0820  4       John C& Houghton, president of the Tareytown Acres
A21 0830  2    Homeowners Association, followed that by announcing
A21 0830  8    plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout
A21 0840 11    their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family.
A21 0850  7    #STUDENTS HELP OUT#
A21 0850 10    Houghton said 6 p&m& Friday had been set for a canvass
A21 0860 11    of all 480 homes in the subdivision, which is located
A21 0870  7    northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile road east. He said
A21 0880  6    contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box
A21 0890  3    553, Warren Village Station.
A21 0890  7       Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of
A21 0900  6    her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her
A21 0910  4    family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann
A21 0910 12    Junior High School, 5155 Fourteen Mile road east.
A21 0920  8       Principal Clayton W& Pohly said he would allow a
A21 0930  9    further collection between classes today, and revealed
A21 0940  5    that ~Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide
A21 0950  5    a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs& Kowalski.
A21 0960  1    #FUNDS FROM DANCES#
A21 0960  4    Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski
A21 0970  4    family would be given the combined proceeds from a
A21 0980  2    school dance held two weeks ago, and another dance
A21 0980 11    for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night.
A21 0990  6       "Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been
A21 1000  5    a spontaneous effort, started largely among the students
A21 1010  2    themselves, because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy
A21 1010 10    for her entire family, Pohly said.
A21 1020  6       There also were reports of a collection at the County
A21 1030  5    Line Elementary School, 3505o Dequindre, which has
A21 1040  3    been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children
A21 1040 13    including Christine.
A21 1050  2    #EXPRESSES THANKS#
A21 1050  4    Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last
A21 1060  6    Saturday. But today he wanted to make a public statement.
A21 1070  2       "I never knew there were such neighbors and friends
A21 1080  2    around me and my family. I wasn't sure there were such
A21 1080 13    people anywhere in the world. I'll need more than a
A21 1090 10    single day to find the words to properly express my
A21 1100  7    thanks to them".
A21 1110  1       An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated
A21 1110 11    by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless
A21 1120  9    driving conviction against a youthful motorist.
A21 1130  4       Patrolman George Kimmell, of McClellan Station,
A21 1140  2    said he would recommend a special safety citation for
A21 1150  1    Ralph Sisk, 9230 Vernor east, a third grader at the
A21 1150 11    Scripps School, for his assistance in the case.
A21 1160  7       Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children
A21 1170  4    across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when
A21 1180  2    a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly
A21 1180 10    inside the pedestrian crosswalk.
A21 1190  3    #GETS CAR NUMBER#
A21 1190  6    Kimmell ordered the driver to back up, watched the
A21 1200  6    children safely across and was approaching the car
A21 1210  3    when it suddenly "took off at high speed", he said,
A21 1210 13    narrowly missing him.
A21 1220  3       Commandeering a passing car, Kimmell pursued the
A21 1230  2    fleeing vehicle, but lost it in traffic. Returning
A21 1230 10    to the school crossing, the officer was informed by
A21 1240  7    the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver, a neighbor,
A21 1250  5    and had obtained the license number.
A21 1260  1       The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees,
A21 1260  8    17, of 2433 McClellan, currently on probation and under
A21 1270  6    court order not to drive.
A21 1280  1    #GIVEN 15 DAYS#
A21 1280  4    He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by
A21 1290  2    Traffic Judge George T& Murphy, who continued his no-driving
A21 1300  1    probation for another year and ordered him to spend
A21 1300 10    15 days in the Detroit House of Correction. The jail
A21 1310  6    sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates
A21 1320  4    from Eastern High School in June.
A21 1330  1       The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown
A21 1330 10    today.
A21 1340  1       Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union
A21 1340 10    to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire.
A21 1350  7    #HELP ASKED#
A21 1350  9    In Vientiane, the royal Laotian government decided
A21 1360  6    today to ask its "friends and neighbors" for help in
A21 1370  5    fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening
A21 1380  2    the southeast Asian kingdom.
A21 1380  6       Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire
A21 1390  9    timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary
A21 1400  5    Lord Home.
A21 1400  7       He said Britain also proposed that the international
A21 1410  5    truce commission should be reconvened, sent to New
A21 1420  4    Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire.
A21 1430  1       A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on
A21 1430 11    May 5, he said.
A21 1440  3    #PLEA FOR ARMS#
A21 1440  6    The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign
A21 1450  4    Minister Tiao Sopsaisana. He indicated that requests
A21 1460  1    would be made for more U&S& arms and more U&S& military
A21 1470  1    advisers.
A21 1470  2       He declared the government is thinking of asking
A21 1480  1    for foreign troops if the situation worsens.
A21 1480  8       One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision
A21 1490  7    was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged
A21 1500  6    military assistance group instead of the current civilian
A21 1510  3    body.
A21 1510  4       A note making the request was handed to U&S& Ambassador
A21 1520  3    Winthrop G& Brown.
A21 1520  6    #HEAVY SUPPORT#
A21 1520  8    The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel
A21 1530  9    attacks had been launched, heavily supported by troops
A21 1540  6    from Communist North Viet Nam.
A21 1550  1       The minister, describing the attacks which led up
A21 1550  9    to the appeal, said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese
A21 1560  8    were fighting royal army troops on one front- near
A21 1570  7    Thakhek, in southern-central Laos.
A21 1580  1       There was no confirmation of such massive assaults
A21 1580  9    from independent sources. In the past such government
A21 1590  7    claims have been found exaggerated.
A21 1610  1    _HAVANA, APRIL 19._
A21 1610  4       - Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by
A21 1620  2    firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began
A21 1620 10    decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces
A21 1630  8    and suspected collaborators.
A21 1640  1       A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans
A21 1650  1    as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair.
A21 1650  8       The executions took place at dawn only a few hours
A21 1660  9    after Havana radio announced their conviction by a
A21 1670  4    revolutionary tribunal at Pinar del Rio, where the
A21 1680  1    executions took place.
A21 1680  4    #ARMS PLOT CHARGED#
A21 1680  7    The broadcast said Anderson, a Seattle ex-marine and
A21 1690  7    Havana businessman, and McNair, of Miami, were condemned
A21 1700  5    on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels.
A21 1710  1       Anderson operated three Havana automobile service
A21 1710  7    stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion
A21 1720  9    post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro's
A21 1730  7    regime.
A21 1730  8       Anderson's wife and four children live in Miami.
A21 1740  8       McNair, 25, was seized March 20 with four Cubans
A21 1750  6    and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles
A21 1760  3    in Pinar del Rio, about 35 miles from Havana.
A21 1760 12    #REPORT OTHERS HELD#
A21 1770  3    At least 20 other Americans were reported to have been
A21 1780  2    arrested in a mass political roundup.
A21 1780  8       Among them were a number of newsmen, including Henry
A21 1790  6    Raymont, of United Press International, and Robert
A21 1800  3    Berrellez, of Associated Press.
A21 1800  7       So many Cubans were reported being swept into the
A21 1810  8    Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium
A21 1820  5    and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift
A21 1830  3    jails. More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested-
A21 1840  3    100 of them Roman Catholic priests.
A21 1850  1       Of the millions who have served time in concentration
A21 1850 10    camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet
A21 1860  8    state, few emerge in the West to tell about it.
A21 1870  6       M& Kegham- the name is a pseudynom- was a teacher
A21 1880  6    in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary
A21 1890  1    Federation (~ARF)- two reasons the Communists put him
A21 1900  1    away when they arrived in 1945.
A21 1900  7       Today, M& Kegham was in Detroit, en route to join
A21 1910  5    his wife and children in California.
A22 0010  1       Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday
A22 0010  8    that it was prepared to accept students of any race
A22 0020 10    as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible.
A22 0030  8       "Emory University's charter and by-laws have never
A22 0040  7    required admission or rejection of students on the
A22 0050  4    basis of race", board chairman Henry L& Bowden stated.
A22 0060  2       But an official statement adopted by the 33-man
A22 0060 11    Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that
A22 0070  9    state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock
A22 0080  6    to accepting Negroes.
A22 0080  9       The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution
A22 0090  7    and state law, tax-exempt status is granted to educational
A22 0100  8    institutions only if they are segregated.
A22 0110  3       "Emory could not continue to operate according to
A22 0120  2    its present standards as an institution of higher learning,
A22 0120 11    of true university grade, and meet its financial obligations,
A22 0130  9    without the tax-exemption privileges which are available
A22 0140  7    to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned
A22 0150  5    constitutional and statutory provisions", the statement
A22 0160  3    said.
A22 0160  4       The statement did not mention what steps might be
A22 0170  3    taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation.
A22 0180  1       An Emory spokesman indicated, however, that the
A22 0180  8    university itself did not intend to make any test of
A22 0190  9    the laws.
A22 0190 11       The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the
A22 0200  6    power to exempt colleges from property taxation if,
A22 0210  4    among other criteria, "all endowments to institutions
A22 0220  1    established for white people shall be limited to white
A22 0220 10    people, and all endowments to institutions established
A22 0230  7    for colored people shall be limited to colored people".
A22 0240  6       At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area
A22 0250  5    now or in the past have had integrated student bodies,
A22 0260  2    but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged
A22 0260 11    by the state.
A22 0270  2       Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church. Some
A22 0280  1    church leaders, both clerical and lay, have criticized
A22 0280  9    the university for not taking the lead in desegregation.
A22 0290  1    #URGED IN 1954#
A22 0290  4    The student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, as early as
A22 0300  8    the fall of 1954 called for desegregation.
A22 0310  3       "From its beginning", the trustees' statement said
A22 0320  3    Friday, "Emory University has assumed as its primary
A22 0330  1    commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian
A22 0330  8    higher learning. Teaching, research and study, according
A22 0340  6    to highest standards, under Christian influence, are
A22 0350  4    paramount in the Emory University policy.
A22 0360  1       "As a private institution, supported by generous
A22 0360  8    individuals, Emory University will recognize no obligation
A22 0370  7    and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its
A22 0380  7    purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian
A22 0390  4    education.
A22 0390  5       "There is not now, nor has there ever been in Emory
A22 0400  7    University's charter or by-laws any requirement that
A22 0410  3    students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race,
A22 0420  1    color or creed. Insofar as its own governing documents
A22 0420 10    are concerned, Emory University could now consider
A22 0430  6    applications from prospective students, and others
A22 0440  1    seeking applications from prospective students, and
A22 0450  2    others seeking the opportunity to study or work at
A22 0450 11    the university, irrespective of race, color or creed.
A22 0460  7    #CORPORATE EXISTENCE#
A22 0460  9    "On the other hand, Emory University derives its corporate
A22 0470  9    existence from the State of Georgia. **h
A22 0480  6       "When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional
A22 0490  3    and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to
A22 0500  3    the maintenance of its educational program and facilities,
A22 0510  1    Emory University will consider applications of persons
A22 0510  8    desiring to study or work at the University without
A22 0520  9    regard to race, color or creed, continuing university
A22 0530  4    policy that all applications shall be considered on
A22 0540  2    the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other
A22 0540 11    criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective
A22 0550  8    conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its
A22 0560  6    mission as an institution of Christian higher education".
A22 0580  1       A young man was killed and two others injured at
A22 0580 11    midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid
A22 0590  8    into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street,
A22 0600  4    ~NE, police said.
A22 0600  7       The dead youth was identified as Robert E& Sims,
A22 0610  7    19, of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir&, ~SE.
A22 0620  2       Patrolman G& E& Hammons said the car evidently slid
A22 0630  2    out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into
A22 0630 12    the pole.
A22 0640  2       The other occupants were James Willard Olvey, 18,
A22 0640 10    of 963 Ponce de Leon Ave&, ~NE, and Larry Coleman Barnett,
A22 0650 11    19, of 704 Hill St&, ~SE, both of whom were treated
A22 0660 11    at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises.
A22 0680  1       The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands
A22 0680  9    for movie theater integration Friday and threatened
A22 0690  6    picketing and "stand-ins" if negotiations failed.
A22 0700  4       The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners
A22 0710  5    of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for
A22 0720  2    Human Rights.
A22 0720  4    #'INTEND TO ATTEND'#
A22 0720  7    "We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the
A22 0730  7    first of the year", the identically worded letters
A22 0740  3    said.
A22 0740  4       The letters set a Nov& 15 deadline for the start
A22 0750  4    of negotiations. They indicated that stand-ins and
A22 0760  1    picketing would be started if theater owners failed
A22 0760  9    to cooperate.
A22 0770  1       Downtown and art theater managers and owners, contacted
A22 0770  9    Friday night for comment on the ~COAHR request, said
A22 0780  9    they had no knowledge of such a letter, and that it
A22 0790  8    was not in the Friday mail. However, three of the managers
A22 0800  5    did say that they would agree to attend the proposed
A22 0810  2    meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend.
A22 0810 12    #GATHER HERE#
A22 0820  2    The ~COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering
A22 0830  1    of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here
A22 0830 10    Sunday. Several theater operators said, however, that
A22 0840  7    there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed
A22 0850  6    during the three-day affair.
A22 0860  1       Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate
A22 0860  8    theater integration several months ago. Charles A&
A22 0870  6    Black, ~COAHR chairman, said Friday that three theater
A22 0880  6    representatives had agreed to meet with the students
A22 0890  4    on Oct& 31 but had failed to show up. He declined to
A22 0900  2    name the three.
A22 0900  5       Friday's letters asked for a Nov& 15 meeting. Failure
A22 0910  3    to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend,
A22 0920  1    the letters said, would be considered a "sign of indifference".
A22 0930  1       Black said ~COAHR "hoped to be able to integrate
A22 0930 10    the theaters without taking direct action, but we are
A22 0940  9    pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at
A22 0950  6    our disposal **h"
A22 0950  9       A prepared statement released by the student group
A22 0970  7    Friday stated that "extensive research by ~COAHR into
A22 0980  5    techniques and methods of theater integration in other
A22 0990  4    cities indicated that the presence of picket lines
A22 0995  1    and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop
A22 1000  7    in profits **h"
A22 1010  1       Besides managers of downtown theaters, the students
A22 1010  8    sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown
A22 1020 10    area and Buckhead.
A22 1030  1    #R& E& KILLINGSWORTH#
A22 1030  4    Raymond E& Killingsworth, 72, died Sunday at his home
A22 1040  5    at 357 Venable St&, ~NW.
A22 1040 10       Mr& Kililngsworth was a foreman with ~S and ~W Cafeteria.
A22 1050  9    He was born in Pittsboro, Miss&, and was a veteran
A22 1060  8    of World War /1,. He was a member of the Baptist church.
A22 1070  8       Survivors include two brothers, C& E& Killingsworth,
A22 1080  4    Atlanta, and John Killingsworth, Warren, Ohio; and
A22 1090  4    two sisters, Miss Minnie Kililngsworth and Mrs& Bessie
A22 1100  3    Bloom, both of Gettysburg, Pa&.
A22 1100  8    #JOHN W& BALL#
A22 1110  1    John William Ball, 68, of 133 Marietta St& ~NW, Apartment
A22 1120  1    101~B, died Sunday at his home.
A22 1120  7       Mr& Ball was a house painter. He was a member of
A22 1130  7    the Oakland City Methodist Church and a native of Atlanta.
A22 1140  6       Funeral services will be at 2 p&m& Tuesday at Blanchard's
A22 1150  4    Chapel with the Rev& J& H& Hearn officiating.
A22 1160  2       Survivors include his sister, Mrs& Emma B& Odom
A22 1170  3    of Atlanta.
A22 1170  5    #MRS& LOLA HARRIS#
A22 1170  8    Mrs& Lola M& Harris, a native of Atlanta, died Sunday
A22 1180  8    at her home in Garland, Tex&.
A22 1190  2       Survivors include a son, Charles R& Fergeson, Memphis,
A22 1200  1    Tenn&; two daughters, Mrs& Gene F& Stoll and Miss Nancy
A22 1210  2    Harris, both of Garland; her father, H& T& Simpson,
A22 1220  1    Greenville, S&C&, and three sisters, Mrs& W& E& Little
A22 1230  1    and Mrs& Hal B& Wansley, both of Atlanta, and Mrs&
A22 1230 11    Bill Wallace, Wilmington, N&C&.
A22 1250  1       A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after
A22 1250 11    breaking into the home of relatives in search of his
A22 1260 10    wife, hitting his uncle with a rock and assaulting
A22 1270  5    two police officers who tried to subdue him, police
A22 1280  2    said.
A22 1280  3       Patrolmen J& W& Slate and A& L& Crawford Jr& said
A22 1290  3    they arrested Ronald M& Thomas, of 1671 Nakoma St&,
A22 1300  2    ~NW, after he assaulted the officers.
A22 1300  8    #POLICE ACCOUNT#
A22 1310  1    The officers gave this account:
A22 1310  6       Thomas early Sunday went to the home of his uncle
A22 1320  7    and aunt, Mr& and Mrs& R& C& Thomas, 511 Blanche St&,
A22 1330  4    ~NW, looking for his wife, Margaret Lou Thomas, 18,
A22 1340  3    and their 11-month-old baby.
A22 1340  9       The younger Thomas ripped a screen door, breaking
A22 1350  6    the latch, and after an argument struck his uncle with
A22 1360  4    a rock, scratching his face. He also struck his aunt
A22 1370  1    and wife, and during the melee the baby also suffered
A22 1370 11    scratches.
A22 1380  1       When police arrived the man was still violent, Slate
A22 1380 10    said.
A22 1380 11    #ATTACKS OFFICER#
A22 1390  2    He attacked one of the officers and was restrained.
A22 1400  1    About five minutes later he jumped up, Slate said,
A22 1400 10    and struck the two policemen again.
A22 1410  4       He was then subdued and placed in the police car
A22 1420  2    to be taken to Grady Hospital for treatment of scratches
A22 1420 12    received in the melee. Then he attacked the two officers
A22 1430 10    again and was again restrained, Slate related.
A22 1440  4       Slate said he and Crawford received cuts and scratches
A22 1450  4    and their uniforms were badly torn.
A22 1460  1       Thomas was charged with four counts of assault and
A22 1460 10    battery. Two counts of assault on an officer, resisting
A22 1470  7    arrest, disturbance and cursing, police said. A hearing
A22 1480  5    was set for 8:30 a&m& Tuesday.
A22 1490  1       Mrs& Mary Self, who knows more than any other person
A22 1490 11    about the 5,000 city employes for whom she has kept
A22 1500 10    personnel records over the years, has closed her desk
A22 1510  7    and retired.
A22 1510  9       Over the weekend, Mrs& Self, personnel clerk, was
A22 1520  6    a feted and honored guest of the Atlanta Club, organization
A22 1530  4    of women employes at City Hall.
A22 1540  1       After 18 years in the personnel office, she has
A22 1540 10    taken a disability pension on advice of her doctors.
A22 1550  6       As personnel clerk, she handled thousands of entries,
A22 1560  4    ranging from appointments to jobs, to transfers to
A22 1570  2    other employments, to pensions.
A22 1570  6       "I have enjoyed it and will feel a bit lost at least
A22 1580  8    for a while", she said wistfully Friday.
A22 1590  1       One of the largest crowds in the club's history
A22 1590 10    turned out to pay tribute to Mrs& Self and her service.
A22 1610  1       Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying
A22 1610  7    its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay
A22 1620  9    ahead of the fast-spreading pest.
A22 1630  2       The department is planning to expand its eradication
A22 1640  1    program soon to four additional counties- Troup, Pierce,
A22 1640  9    Bryan and Bulloch- to treat 132,000 acres infested
A22 1650  8    by the ants, according to W& E& Blasingame state entomologist.
A22 1660  7       Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical,
A22 1670  7    heptachlor, over 30,000 acres in Troup, 37,000 acres
A22 1680  5    in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties.
A22 1700  1       The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and
A22 1710  2    Jones counties, over 37,679 acres. The department has
A22 1710 10    just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas
A22 1720  7    of Macon.
A22 1720  9       Also being treated are Houston, Bleckley, Tift,
A22 1730  6    Turner and Dodge counties, Blasingame said. The fire
A22 1740  5    ant is thought to infest approximately two million
A22 1750  3    acres of land in Georgia, attacking crops, young wildlife
A22 1760  1    and livestock and can be a serious health menace to
A22 1760 11    humans who are allergic to its venom, Blasingame said.
A22 1780  1       The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th
A22 1780 10    Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic
A22 1790  8    hours this week.
A22 1800  1       This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete
A22 1800 10    the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway.
A22 1810  9    Students have been using electric computers and high
A22 1820  6    speed movie cameras during the study. Perhaps the engineers
A22 1830  4    can find out what causes all the congestion and suggest
A22 1840  2    methods to eliminate it.
A22 1840  6       Incidentally, 14th Street and the Expressway is
A22 1850  5    the high accident intersection during daylight hours.
A22 1860  2    It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue,
A22 1860 11    ~NE; the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways
A22 1870  9    and Jones Avenue and Marietta Street, ~NW.
A22 1890  1       Four persons died in Georgia weekend traffic crashes,
A22 1890  9    two of them in a fiery crash near Snellville, the State
A22 1910  9    Patrol said Sunday.
A22 1920  1       The latest death reported was that of 4-year-old
A22 1920 11    Claude Douglas Maynor of Calvary. Troopers said the
A22 1930  7    child ran into the path of a passing car a half-mile
A22 1940  8    north of Calvary on Georgia 111 in Grady County.
A22 1950  2       That death occurred at 6:50 p&m& Friday and was
A22 1960  2    reported Sunday, the patrol said.
A22 1960  7    #BURSTS INTO FLAMES#
A22 1960 10    An auto overturned, skidding into a stopped tractor-trailer
A22 1970  9    and burst into flames near Snellville, the patrol said.
A22 1980  7       Bobby Bester Hammett, 21, of Rte& 3, Lawrenceville,
A22 1990  6    and Mrs& Lucille Herrington Jones, 23, of Lawrenceville,
A22 2000  5    died in the flaming car, the patrol said.
A23 0010  1    _SALEM (SPECIAL)_
A23 0010  3       - For a second month in a row, Multnomah County
A23 0020  1    may be short of general assistance money in its budget
A23 0020 11    to handle an unusually high summer month's need, the
A23 0030  7    state public welfare commission was told Friday.
A23 0040  4       It is the only county in the state so far this month
A23 0050  4    reporting a possible shortage in ~GA category, for
A23 0060  1    which emergency allotment can be given by the state
A23 0060 10    if necessary.
A23 0070  1       William Smythe, director of field service, told
A23 0070  8    the commissioners that Multnomah, as of Aug& 22, had
A23 0080  8    spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category,
A23 0090  5    leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month.
A23 0100  1       At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks
A23 0100 11    of the month, this could mean a shortage of as high
A23 0110 10    as $17,000. But it probably will be less because of
A23 0120  6    a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month,
A23 0130  3    Smythe said. No request for emergency allotment had
A23 0130 11    yet been received, however.
A23 0140  4    #BOARD OKS PACT#
A23 0140  7    The commission, meeting for the first time with both
A23 0150  7    of its newly-appointed commissioners, Roy Webster,
A23 0160  2    of Hood River, and Dr& Ennis Keizer, of North Bend,
A23 0170  1    approved a year's contract for a consultant in the
A23 0170 10    data processing department who has been the center
A23 0180  7    of considerable controversy in the past.
A23 0190  3       The contract with Ray Field, who has been converting
A23 0200  1    the agencies electronic data processing program to
A23 0200  8    magnetic tape, would renew his present salary of $8
A23 0210  7    an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month.
A23 0220  3       Field does the planning for the machine operations
A23 0230  1    and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing
A23 0230 11    system to new programs as they are made necessary by
A23 0240  9    legislative and policy changes.
A23 0250  1       Acting Administrator Andrew F& Juras said that because
A23 0260  1    of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program,
A23 0260 10    the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he
A23 0270  9    was not continued for a period.
A23 0280  3       But he emphasized that the agency must train people
A23 0290  1    within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles,
A23 0290 10    and he said he personally "regrets very much that the
A23 0300  6    agency has not done this in the past".
A23 0310  2       He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency
A23 0320  1    was literally dependent now on the machine processing,
A23 0320  9    "and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it
A23 0330  9    broke down or the three or four persons directing it
A23 0340  4    were to leave".
A23 0340  7    #SALARY TERMED MODEST#
A23 0340 10    Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant
A23 0350 10    basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator
A23 0360  8    of the agency and not to other agencies of the government.
A23 0370  7    He also said that the salary, in terms of going rates
A23 0380  5    in the field, was "modest" in terms of the man's responsibility.
A23 0390  2    The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed,
A23 0400  1    he said, and added Field's long service in state government
A23 0410  1    and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare
A23 0410 10    program.
A23 0420  1       "Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative
A23 0420 12    session and defend this contract"? asked Mrs& Grace
A23 0430  7    O& Peck, representative from Multnomah County, of the
A23 0440  6    commission chairman, Joseph E& Harvey Jr&.
A23 0450  3       "My feeling at the moment", he said, "is that we
A23 0460  4    have no alternative, irrespective of some of the arguments
A23 0470  1    about him. The continued operation of this program
A23 0470  9    depends on having his service".
A23 0480  3    #HARVEY CRITICIZED#
A23 0480  5    Mrs& Peck, later joined by the commission's vice-chairman,
A23 0490  6    Mrs& Lee Patterson, took Harvey to task for comments
A23 0500  5    he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday.
A23 0510  3       A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service,
A23 0520  2    of which Harvey is president, quoted him as saying
A23 0520 11    the welfare office move to Salem, instead of "crippling"

A24 0880  5    who had ruled previously that the Warwick board erred
A24 0890  5    when it named Maurice F& Tougas as coordinator of audio-visual
A24 0900  4    education without first finding that the school superintendent's
A24 0910  2    candidate was not suitable.
A24 0910  6       Supt& Clarence S& Taylor had recommended Roger I&
A24 0920  7    Vermeersch for the post.
A24 0940  1       Milton and Rosella Lovett of Cranston were awarded
A24 0940  9    $55,000 damages from the state in Superior Court yesterday
A24 0950  9    for industrial property which they owned at 83 Atwells
A24 0960  7    Ave&, Providence, and which was condemned for use in
A24 0970  6    construction of Interstate Route 95.
A24 0980  1       The award was made by Judge Fred B& Perkins who
A24 0980 11    heard their petition without a jury by agreement of
A24 0990  8    the parties.
A24 0990 10       The award, without interest, compared with a valuation
A24 1000  7    of $57,500 placed on the property by the property owners'
A24 1010  6    real estate expert, and a valuation of $52,500 placed
A24 1020  4    on it by the state's expert.
A24 1020 10       The property included a one-story brick manufacturing
A24 1030  7    building on 8,293 square feet of land.

A24 1515  1    _BIRMINGHAM, ALA&- (~AP)_
A24 1515  4       - The ~FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge
A24 1530  5    one of the members of the jury that failed to reach
A24 1540  1    a verdict in the "Freedom Rider" bus burning trial
A24 1540 10    four weeks ago.
A24 1550  2       U&S& Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint,
A24 1560  1    charged that the juror gave false information when
A24 1560  9    asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection
A24 1570  7    of jury.
A24 1570  9       He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker, 59,
A24 1580  8    a farmer of Hartselle, Ala&.
A24 1590  2       Eight men were tried together in U&S& District Court
A24 1600  2    in Anniston, Ala&, on charges of interfering with interstate
A24 1610  1    transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white
A24 1610  9    mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first
A24 1620  8    of the Freedom Riders. The bus was burned outside Anniston.
A24 1630  4       One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed
A24 1640  5    verdict of acquittal. A mistrial was declared in the
A24 1650  2    case against the other seven when the jury was unable
A24 1650 12    to agree on a verdict.
A24 1660  3       The arrest of Mr& Parker marks the third charge
A24 1670  1    of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case.
A24 1670 10       The first incident occurred before the trial got
A24 1680  7    under way when Judge H& Hobart Grooms told the jury
A24 1690  6    panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts.
A24 1700  2       He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone
A24 1710  1    outside the court had spoken to them about the case.
A24 1710 11    Two members of the panel later told in court about
A24 1720  9    receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous
A24 1730  4    persons expressing interest in the trial. Neither was
A24 1740  2    seated on the jury.
A24 1740  6       Then, when the case went to the jury, the judge
A24 1750  4    excused one of the jurors, saying the juror had told
A24 1750 14    him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel
A24 1760 11    the night before the trial opened. The juror said the
A24 1770  7    masked men had advised him to be lenient. The judge
A24 1780  3    replaced the juror with an alternate.
A24 1780  9       No formal charges have been filed as a result of
A24 1790  9    either of the two reported incidents.
A24 1800  2       At the opening of the trial, the jury panel was
A24 1800 12    questioned as a group by Mr& Weaver about Ku Klux Klan
A24 1810 11    connections.
A24 1820  1       One member of the panel- not Mr& Parker- indicated
A24 1830  1    he had been a member of the ~KKK at one time. He was
A24 1830 14    not seated on the jury.
A24 1840  4       The perjury charge against Mr& Parker carries a
A24 1850  2    maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment
A24 1850 11    on conviction.

A25 0010  1    _ASILOMAR, MARCH 26_
A25 0010  4       Vast spraying programs conducted by "technicians
A25 0020  1    with narrow training and little wisdom" are endangering
A25 0020  9    crops and wildlife, Carl W& Buchheister, president
A25 0030  7    of the National Audubon Society, said today.
A25 0040  4       "It is like handing a loaded .45 automatic to an
A25 0050  4    8-year-old and telling him to run out and play", he
A25 0060  1    commented.
A25 0060  2       Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon
A25 0070  1    Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed
A25 0070  8    to destroy its target, the fire ant.
A25 0080  6       "But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer
A25 0090  5    and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane
A25 0100  1    crop", he said.
A25 0100  4       The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying
A25 0110  3    had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming. There
A25 0120  1    have even been serious errors in the U& S& Forest Service,
A25 0130  1    whose officials pride themselves in their scientific
A25 0140  7    training, he added.
A25 0150  1       "The news of their experiments reach the farmers
A25 0150  9    who, forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural
A25 0160  8    enemies of insects and rodents, are encouraged to try
A25 0170  5    to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their
A25 0180  3    grapes or their blueberries", Buchheister told the
A25 0180 10    delegates.
A25 0190  1       In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial
A25 0190  9    spraying, Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness
A25 0200  8    bill, creation of national seashore parks, including
A25 0210  6    Point Reyes; preservation of the wetlands where birds
A25 0220  6    breed; a pesticides co-ordination act; stronger water
A25 0230  3    pollution control programs, and Federal ratification
A25 0240  1    of an international convention to halt pollution of
A25 0240  9    the sea by oil.
A25 0260  1       The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in
A25 0260 10    Marin county on Friday officially became the property
A25 0270  8    of the National Audubon Society.
A25 0280  2       Mrs& Norman Livermore, president of the Marin Conservation
A25 0290  2    League, handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands
A25 0300  1    tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W& Buchheister,
A25 0300 10    president of the Society.
A25 0310  4       The presentation was made before several hundred
A25 0320  2    persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney
A25 0320 12    Hall, College of Marin, Kentfield.
A25 0330  5       Buchheister pledged the land would be an "inviolate"
A25 0340  5    sanctuary for all birds, animals and plants.
A25 0360  1       Seventeen years ago today, German scientist Willy
A25 0360  8    Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed
A25 0370  6    in a ~V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly
A25 0380  6    of a Heinkel bomber.
A25 0380 10       The World War /2, German bomber rolled down a runway
A25 0390  9    and took off.
A25 0400  1       The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive
A25 0400 11    was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the
A25 0410  9    airstrip. This had never been done before.
A25 0420  2       Now a quiet-spoken, middle-aged man, Fiedler is
A25 0420 11    an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and
A25 0430  7    Space Division at Sunnyvale, where he played a key
A25 0440  8    role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile.
A25 0450  4       He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that
A25 0460  3    historic flight in 1944.
A25 0460  7       "The first two pilots had crashed", he said. "I
A25 0470  6    had developed the machines and therefore knew them.
A25 0480  3    It was time to go up myself".
A25 0480 10       Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's
A25 0490  5    super-secret "Reichenberg project", which remained
A25 0500  3    unknown to the Allies until after the war.
A25 0510  1       About 200 of the special ~V-1 rocket-bombs were
A25 0510 11    to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive
A25 0520  7    warhead. The target was Allied shipping- a desperate
A25 0530  3    effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe.
A25 0540  2       The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's
A25 0550  1    flight.
A25 0550  2       Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled
A25 0550 10    by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism, the scientist
A25 0560  8    waited while the bomber gained altitude.
A25 0570  5       At 12,000 feet, Fiedler signaled "release", and
A25 0580  3    started the roaring pulse-jet engine- then streaked
A25 0590  1    away from beneath the Heinkel.
A25 0590  6       To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became
A25 0600  5    a faint black speck, hurtling through the sky at the
A25 0610  4    then incredible speed of 420 m&p&h&.
A25 0610 10       It was probably man's first successful flight in
A25 0620  6    a missile. "She flew beautifully", said Fiedler. "There
A25 0630  4    was only one power control- a valve to adjust the fuel
A25 0640  5    flow. I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test
A25 0650  3    strip".
A25 0650  4       Using a steering system that controlled the modified
A25 0660  2    rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons,
A25 0670  1    Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially
A25 0670 11    bolted under the fuselage.
A25 0680  2       He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing
A25 0680 11    speed of 200 m&p&h&- fast even for a modern jet plane
A25 0690 11    touchdown- and banked into the airfield.
A25 0700  8       Moments later the ~V-1 skimmed across the landing
A25 0710  4    strip, edging closer and closer to a touchdown- then
A25 0720  4    in a streamer of dust it landed.
A25 0720 11       Fiedler went on to make several other test flights
A25 0730  5    before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles.
A25 0740  2       The missiles were to be armed with an underwater
A25 0750  1    bomb. Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into
A25 0750 11    the water, striking below the waterline of individual
A25 0760  7    ships.
A25 0760  8       A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks
A25 0770  9    of volunteers, but the project was halted before the
A25 0780  5    end of the war, and the missiles later fell into Allied
A25 0790  2    hands.
A25 0790  3       Now a family man with three children, Fiedler lives
A25 0800  2    in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant
A25 0800 11    at Sunnyvale. His spare time is spent in soaring gliders.
A25 0810  9       "It's so quiet", he said, "so slow, serene- and
A25 0820  9    so challenging".

A25 1200  8    Stein's janitor firm, the National Maintenance company,
A25 1210  6    in three years ending in 1959, Stein disclosed in an
A25 1220  5    interview.
A25 1220  6       "I put Arger on the payroll because he promised
A25 1230  4    to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier",
A25 1240  2    Stein said. "But Arger never was able to produce it,
A25 1240 12    so I cut him off my payroll".
A25 1250  7    #CONNECTION IS SOUGHT#
A25 1250 10    Other witnesses, after appearances before the jury,
A25 1260  6    which reportedly is probing into possible income tax
A25 1270  5    violations, disclosed that government prosecutors were
A25 1280  2    attempting to connect Stein and his company with a
A25 1280 11    number of gangsters, including Glimco and Alex.
A25 1290  6       The federal lawyers, according to their witnesses,
A25 1300  5    also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant.
A25 1310  3    Under scrutiny, two of the witnesses said, were payments
A25 1320  1    and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at
A25 1320  9    543 Madison st&.
A25 1330  2       The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick
A25 1340  1    Place and factories, liquor firms, and other businesses.
A25 1340  9    #LEE A WITNESS#
A25 1350  3    Among the witnesses were Ed J& Lee, director of McCormick
A25 1360  2    Place; Jerome Leavitt, a partner in the Union Liquor
A25 1370  1    company, 3247 S& Kedzie av&, Dominic Senese, a teamster
A25 1370 10    union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin
A25 1380 11    of Tony Accardo, onetime gang chief; and Frank W& Pesce,
A25 1390  7    operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm, the
A25 1400  4    Best Sanitation and Supply company, 1215 Blue Island
A25 1410  3    av&.
A25 1410  4       Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement
A25 1420  3    in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors
A25 1430  1    in McCormick Place. Stein's fee, Lee said, was 10 per
A25 1430 11    cent of the janitors' pay. Stein estimated this amount
A25 1440  8    at "about $1,500 or $1,600 a month".
A25 1450  5    #A $12,500 PAYMENT#
A25 1450  8    Leavitt, as he entered the jury room, said he was prepared
A25 1460  8    to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm
A25 1470  4    paid to Stein for "labor consultant work" with five
A25 1480  2    unions which organized Leavitt's workers. Leavitt identified
A25 1490  1    the unions as a warehouseman's local, the teamsters
A25 1490  9    union, a salesman's union, the janitors' union, and
A25 1500  6    a bottling workers' union.
A25 1510  1       Government attorneys, Leavitt said, have questioned
A25 1510  7    him closely about "five or six loans" totaling about
A25 1520  8    $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the
A25 1530  7    last year.
A25 1530  9       All of the loans, in amounts up to $5,000 each,
A25 1540  7    have been repaid by Stein, according to Leavitt. Stein
A25 1550  4    said he needed the money, Leavitt said, to "meet the
A25 1560  2    payroll" at National Maintenance company.
A25 1560  7       The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the
A25 1570  9    headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers'
A25 1580  4    union at 1213-15 Blue Island av&.
A25 1590  1       The radiation station of the Chicago board of health
A25 1590 10    recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation
A25 1600  9    per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday.
A25 1610  3       The reading, which has been watched with interest
A25 1620  2    since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday, was
A25 1620 11    4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday, a level far below
A25 1630 11    the danger point, according to the board of health.
A25 1640  7       The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive
A25 1650  3    fallout from the test might arrive here next week.
A25 1660  1    A board of health spokesman said there is no reason
A25 1660 11    to believe that an increase in the level here will
A25 1670  8    occur as a result of the detonation.
A25 1690  1       Curtis Allen Huff, 41, of 1630 Lake av&, Wilmette,
A25 1690 10    was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant
A25 1700  7    charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount
A25 1710  4    of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association,
A25 1720  4    1 S& Dearborn st&, where he formerly was employed as
A25 1730  2    an attorney.
A25 1730  4       Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may
A25 1740  3    total $20,000, altho a spokesman for the association
A25 1740 11    estimated its loss at approximately $10,000.
A25 1750  6    #LIEN PAYMENTS INVOLVED#
A25 1750  9    Huff's attorney, Antone F& Gregorio, quoted his client
A25 1760  8    as saying that part of the embezzlement represented
A25 1770  7    money paid to Huff, as attorney for the loan association,
A25 1780  6    in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on
A25 1790  4    which the association held mortgages.
A25 1790  9       Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay
A25 1800  9    "the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living".
A25 1810  5       Huff, who received a salary of $109 a week from
A25 1820  5    the loan association from October of 1955 until September
A25 1830  1    of this year, said that his private practice was not
A25 1830 11    lucrative. Huff lives with his wife, Sue, and their
A25 1840  9    four children, 6 to 10 years old, in a $25,000 home
A25 1850  6    with a $17,000 mortgage.
A25 1850 10    #CHARGE LISTS 3 CHECKS#
A25 1860  2    The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed
A25 1860 12    by Leo Blaber, an attorney for the association.
A25 1870  8       The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to
A25 1880  6    report for work on Sept& 18. On that date, according
A25 1890  4    to Gregorio, Huff left his home and took a room in
A25 1900  2    the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence av&. There,
A25 1900 11    Gregorio said, Huff wrote a complete statement of his
A25 1910  9    offense.
A25 1910 10       Later, Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at
A25 1920  9    the Sherman House, using a credit card. All bounced.
A25 1930  6       When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there
A25 1940  4    Monday, hotel officials called police.
A25 1950  1    _BONN, OCT& 24 (~UPI)_
A25 1950  5       - Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement
A25 1960  3    under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims
A25 1970  2    of Nazi persecution, it was announced today.
A26 0010  1       PROBABLY THE hottest thing that has hit the Dallas
A26 0010 10    investment community in years was the Morton Foods
A26 0020  8    stock issue, which was sold to the public during the
A26 0030  7    past week.
A26 0030  9       For many reasons, the demand to buy shares in the
A26 0040  7    Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous. It was
A26 0050  3    not a case of the investment bankers having to sell
A26 0050 13    the stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares
A26 0060 11    to a number of customers and explaining to others why
A26 0070  6    they had no more to sell.
A26 0070 12       Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended
A26 0080  9    up with 25, and customers who had put in a bid to buy
A26 0090  9    400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves
A26 0100  4    lucky to get that many.
A26 0100  9       In fact, very few customers, anywhere in the nation,
A26 0110  7    were able to get more than 100 shares. Some Dallas
A26 0120  4    investment firms got only 100 shares, for all of their
A26 0130  2    customers.
A26 0130  3       A measure of how hot the stock was, can be found
A26 0140  2    in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading
A26 0140 14    began.
A26 0150  1       The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price
A26 0150 11    of $12.50 a share. The first over-the-counter trade
A26 0160  7    Wednesday afternoon at Eppler, Guerin + Turner, the
A26 0170  5    managing underwriter, was at $17 a share. And from
A26 0180  2    that the stock moved right on up until it was trading
A26 0180 13    Thursday morning at around $22 a share.
A26 0190  7       But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it
A26 0200  6    was on the market. Indeed, from the moment the reports
A26 0210  2    of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas
A26 0210 11    last January, the inquiries and demand for the stock
A26 0220  9    started building up.
A26 0230  1       Letters by the reams came in from investment firms
A26 0230 10    all over the nation, all of them wanting to get a part
A26 0240 10    of the shares that would be sold (185,000 to the public
A26 0250  7    at $12.50, with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods
A26 0260  4    employes at $11.50 a share).
A26 0260  9       There was even a cable in French from a bank in
A26 0270  9    Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas
A26 0280  4    stock offering. "We subscribe 500 shares of Morton
A26 0290  1    Foods of Texas. Cable confirmation", it said translated.
A26 0290  9    But E&G&T& could not let the Swiss bank have even 10
A26 0300 11    shares.
A26 0310  1       After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and
A26 0310  9    52 selling group members from coast to coast there
A26 0320  7    were not many shares for anyone.
A26 0330  1       But the result of it all was, E&G&T& partner Dean
A26 0330 11    Guerin believes, an effective distribution of the stock
A26 0340  8    to owners all over the nation.
A26 0350  4       "I feel confident the stock will qualify for the
A26 0360  2    'national list'", he said, meaning its market price
A26 0360 10    would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the
A26 0370  9    country.
A26 0370 10       He was also pleased with the wide distribution because
A26 0380  8    he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas
A26 0390  6    investment men can do just as good a job as the big
A26 0400  5    New York investment bankers claim only they can do.
A26 0400 14       But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such
A26 0405 10    a hot one?
A26 0410  1       The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.
A26 0420  1       First, the general stock market has been boiling
A26 0420  9    upward for the last few months, driving stocks of all
A26 0430  7    kinds up. As a result, it is not easy to find a stock
A26 0440  6    priced as the Morton issue was priced (at roughly 10
A26 0450  2    times 1960 earnings, to yield a little over 5 per cent
A26 0450 13    on the 64~c anticipated dividend).
A26 0460  3       Second, the "potato chip industry" has caught the
A26 0470  4    fancy of investors lately, and until Morton Foods came
A26 0480  2    along there were only two potato chip stocks- Frito
A26 0480 11    and H& W& Lay- on the market.
A26 0490  6       Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price
A26 0500  3    on the market in recent months, both were selling at
A26 0500 13    higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was
A26 0510  9    coming to market at, and everyone who knew anything
A26 0520  7    about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up.
A26 0530  7       And third, the potato chip industry has taken on
A26 0540  3    the flavor of a "growth" industry in the public mind
A26 0540 13    of late. Foods, which long had been considered "recession
A26 0550  9    resistant" but hardly dynamic stocks, have been acting
A26 0560  8    like growth stocks, going to higher price-earnings
A26 0570  5    ratios.
A26 0570  6       The potato chip industry these days is growing,
A26 0575  4    not only as a result of population increase and public
A26 0590  1    acceptance of convenience foods, but also because of
A26 0590  9    a combination of circumstances that has led to growth
A26 0600  6    by merger.
A26 0600  8       The history of the U&S& potato chip industry is
A26 0610  6    that many of today's successful companies got started
A26 0620  4    during the deep depression days. Those that remain
A26 0630  1    are those that were headed by strong executives, men
A26 0630 10    with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive
A26 0640  9    survival of the fittest.
A26 0650  1       But today many of those men are reaching retirement
A26 0650 10    age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate
A26 0660  8    tax problem with their closely held companies and also
A26 0670  6    that they have no second-echelon management in their
A26 0680  3    firms.
A26 0680  4       So they go looking for mergers with other firms
A26 0690  2    that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they
A26 0690 11    pound on the doors of firms like Frito.
A26 0700  7       All those things combined to make the Morton Foods
A26 0710  5    stock the hot issue that it was and is.
A26 0720  1       Now, if Morton's newest product, a corn chip known
A26 0720 10    as Chip-o's, turns out to sell as well as its stock
A26 0730 10    did, the stock may turn out to be worth every cent
A26 0740  6    of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to. Dallas
A26 0760  2    and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing
A26 0760 12    and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and
A26 0770  8    supplies, valued in the millions of dollars.
A26 0780  4       More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas
A26 0790  3    and one large manufacturer is located to the north
A26 0790 12    at Sherman.
A26 0800  2       It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's
A26 0810  1    Association is meeting here this week for the 46th
A26 0810 10    time in their 52-year history.
A26 0820  4       The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the
A26 0830  2    State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million
A26 0830 12    dollars. It weighs in the tons, so the proximity of
A26 0840  9    factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an
A26 0850  6    outstanding exhibit each year.
A26 0850 10       A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood
A26 0860  8    of $250,000, and it's a safe assumption that a large
A26 0870  7    percentage of new gins in the U&S& and foreign countries
A26 0880  4    contain machinery made in this area.
A26 0890  1       The Murray Co& of Texas, Inc&, originated in Dallas
A26 0890 10    in 1896. They've occupied a 22-acre site since the
A26 0900  9    early 1900's. More than 700 employes make gin machinery
A26 0910  6    that's sold anywhere cotton is grown.
A26 0920  1       Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment
A26 0920  9    except for driers and cleaners, and this machinery
A26 0930  8    is purchased from a Dallas-based firm.
A26 0940  2       The Continental Gin Co& began operations in Dallas
A26 0950  2    in 1899. The present company is a combination of several
A26 0950 12    smaller ones that date back to 1834.
A26 0960  7       Headquarters is in Birmingham, Ala&. Factories are
A26 0970  4    located here and in Prattville, Ala&. About 40 per
A26 0980  3    cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant
A26 0980 13    by more than 200 employes.
A26 0990  5       The company sells a complete line of gin machinery
A26 1000  3    all over the cotton-growing world.
A26 1000  9       Hardwicke-Etter Co& of Sherman makes a full line
A26 1010  8    of gin machinery and equipment. The firm recently expanded
A26 1020  5    domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result
A26 1030  5    of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co&. They export
A26 1040  2    also.
A26 1040  3       The company began operation in 1900 with hardware
A26 1050  1    and oil mill supplies. In 1930, they began making cotton
A26 1050 11    processing equipment. Presently, Hardwicke-Etter employs
A26 1060  6    300-450 people, depending on the season of the year.
A26 1070  7       The Lummus Cotton Gin Co& has had a sales and service
A26 1080  7    office in Dallas since 1912. Factory operations are
A26 1090  3    in Columbus, Ga&. The district office here employs
A26 1100  1    about 65.
A26 1100  3       The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co& and Gordin Unit
A26 1110  2    System of Ginning have joint headquarters here. The
A26 1110 10    cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and
A26 1120  8    the unit system, which turns out a complete ginning
A26 1130  6    system, began operations in 1959.
A26 1140  1       Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock.
A26 1140  7       The John E& Mitchell Co& began work in Dallas in
A26 1150  8    1928. The firm is prominent in making equipment for
A26 1160  5    cleaning seed cotton, driers, and heaters, and they
A26 1170  3    lay claim to being the first maker (1910) of boil extraction
A26 1180  1    equipment.
A26 1180  2       The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton
A26 1180  9    makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern
A26 1190  9    gin operation.
A26 1200  1       Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people. They
A26 1200 10    export cotton ginning machinery.
A26 1210  3       The Hinckley Gin Supply Co& is a maker of "overhead
A26 1220  3    equipment". This includes driers, cleaners, burr extractors,
A26 1230  2    separators and piping that's located above gin stands
A26 1230 10    in a complete gin.
A26 1240  4       The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells
A26 1250  1    equipment in the central cotton belt, including the
A26 1250  9    Mississippi Delta.
A26 1260  2       The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co& has home offices
A26 1270  1    and factory facilities here. They make gin saws and
A26 1270 10    deal in parts, supplies and some used gin machinery.
A26 1280  6       The Stacy Co& makes cleaning and drying equipment
A26 1290  4    for sale largely in Texas. They've been in Dallas since
A26 1300  4    1921.
A26 1300  5       Cotton Belt Gin Service, Inc& of Dallas makes gin
A26 1310  5    saws and started here 14 years ago. They distribute
A26 1320  1    equipment in 11 states. The firm also handles gin and
A26 1320 11    oil mill supplies such as belting, bearings, etc&.
A26 1330  6       Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment
A26 1340  5    of Dallas business economy. New car sales in Dallas
A26 1350  6    County during March showed slight signs of recovering
A26 1360  2    from the doldrums which have characterized sales this
A26 1360 10    year.
A26 1370  1       Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked
A26 1370  9    the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year.
A26 1380 10       Totaling 3,399, sales jumped 14 per cent over February's
A26 1390  8    2,963. However, compared with March 1960 new car sales
A26 1400  7    of 4,441, this March was off 23 per cent.
A26 1410  2       On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, the first quarter
A26 1410 11    of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind
A26 1420 11    the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744.
A26 1430  6       This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely
A26 1440  3    follows the national trend- estimated sales of domestic
A26 1450  1    cars in the U&S& for first three months of 1961 were
A26 1450 12    about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the
A26 1460 11    first quarter a year earlier.
A26 1470  1       With the March pickup, dealers are optimistic that
A26 1470  9    the April-June quarter will equal or top last year.
A26 1480 10    The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging
A26 1490  6    enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules
A26 1500  3    for the next quarter.
A26 1500  7       On the local level, compacts continue to grab a
A26 1510  6    larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced
A26 1520  4    standard models and foreign cars. Only three standard
A26 1530  1    models- Buick, Chrysler, and Mercury- had slight year-to-year
A26 1540  1    gains in March sales in the county.
A26 1550  1       The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas
A26 1550  9    County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales
A26 1560  9    Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p&m& Tuesday in the
A26 1570  7    Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel as the
A26 1580  4    club winds up its annual Distributive Education project.
A26 1590  2       Now in its third year, the program is designed to
A26 1600  2    provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers
A26 1600 10    in marketing and salesmanship. Business firms provide
A26 1610  6    20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom
A26 1620  4    instruction in these fields.
A26 1630  1       More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part
A26 1630  9    in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational
A26 1640  7    rather than a need basis.
A26 1650  1       Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T&
A26 1650  8    Owens, national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical

A26 1820  1       The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban
A26 1820  8    renewal proposals, particularly their effect on the
A26 1830  7    Federal Housing Administration, came under fire in
A26 1840  5    Dallas last week.
A26 1840  8       The Administration's proposals, complex and sweeping
A26 1850  5    as they are, all deal with fringe areas of the housing
A26 1860  5    market rather than its core, stated Caron S& Stallard,
A26 1870  3    first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association
A26 1880  1    of America.
A27 0010  1    _SANTA BARBARA_
A27 0010  3       - "The present recovery movement will gather steady
A27 0020  1    momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak
A27 0020 11    by this autumn", Beryl W& Sprinkel, economist of Harris
A27 0030  7    Trust + Savings Bank, Chicago, predicted at the closing
A27 0040  7    session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn&, California
A27 0050  4    group, conference.
A27 0050  6       Another speaker, William H& Draper, Jr&, former
A27 0060  7    Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto
A27 0070 10    venture capital firm of Draper, Gaither + Anderson,
A27 0080  4    urged the U&S& to "throw down the gauntlet of battle
A27 0090  4    to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed
A27 0100  2    arouny any more". He urged support for President Kennedy's
A27 0110  1    requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations.
A27 0110  9    #'NOT FLASH IN PAN'#
A27 0120  4    Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement
A27 0130  1    in economic activity was not a "temporary flash in
A27 0130 10    the pan" but the beginning of a substantial cyclical
A27 0140  8    expansion that will carry the economy back to full
A27 0150  6    employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional
A27 0160  2    growth pattern.
A27 0160  4       "In view of the current expansion, which promises
A27 0170  3    to be substantial" he said the odds appear to favor
A27 0180  1    rising interest rates in coming months, but "there
A27 0180  9    is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt
A27 0190  9    as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960".
A27 0200  6    #THESIS REFUTED#
A27 0200  8    Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist
A27 0210  5    thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow
A27 0220  4    growth, declaring that this pessimism "is based on
A27 0230  1    very limited and questionable evidence".
A27 0230  6       Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60
A27 0240  7    as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for
A27 0250  3    growth", he said "it should be viewed as a lesson well
A27 0260  2    learned which will increase the probability of substantial
A27 0260 10    improvement in this recovery".
A27 0270  4    #DANGER CITED#
A27 0270  6    He cautioned that "the greater danger in this recovery
A27 0280  6    may be excessive stimulation by government which could
A27 0290  3    bring moderate inflation".
A27 0290  6       The economist does not look for a drastic switch
A27 0300  8    in the budget during this recovery and believes it
A27 0310  4    "even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively
A27 0320  2    tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the
A27 0320 11    upturn as was the case in 1958".
A27 0330  7       The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion, he said, was
A27 0340  4    not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our
A27 0350  1    economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate
A27 0350 10    economic policies combined with retrenching decisions
A27 0360  5    resulting from the steel strike.
A27 0370  1    #SACRIFICES NEEDED#
A27 0370  3    Draper declared, "As I see it, this country has never
A27 0380  4    faced such great dangers as threaten us today. We must
A27 0390  2    justify our heritage. We must be ready for any needed
A27 0390 12    sacrifice".
A27 0400  1       He said that from his experience of two years with
A27 0400 11    Gen& Clay in West Berlin administration, that "Russia
A27 0410  8    respects our show of strength, but that presently we're
A27 0420  7    not acting as we should and must".
A27 0430  2       He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail
A27 0440  1    action, and noted that in war "you can't buy yourself
A27 0440 11    out and that's what we're trying to do".
A27 0450  7       While he declined to suggest, how, he said that
A27 0460  5    sooner or later we must get rid of Castro, "for unless
A27 0470  3    we do we're liable to face similar situations in this
A27 0480  1    hemisphere. Its the start of a direct threat to our
A27 0480 11    own security and I don't believe we can permit that".
A27 0500  1    _NEW YORK (~AP)_
A27 0500  4       - Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery,
A27 0510  2    erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press
A27 0520  1    average and making the largest gain in about two weeks.
A27 0520 11       Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery
A27 0530 10    drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when
A27 0540  6    the list sank to a hoped-for "support level" represented
A27 0550  3    by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average.
A27 0560  2    It was a level at which some of the investors standing
A27 0560 13    on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal
A27 0570 10    issues represented in the averages.
A27 0580  4    #SOME GOOD NEWS#
A27 0580  7    Although it looked like a routine technical snapback
A27 0590  3    to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news.
A27 0610  3    A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable
A27 0610 13    goods was reported for last month.
A27 0620  6       Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy
A27 0630  4    is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year,
A27 0640  2    paving the way for lower taxes.
A27 0640  8       The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to
A27 0650  5    687.87.
A27 0650  6       Of 1,253 issues traded, 695 advanced and 354 declined.
A27 0660  5    New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14.
A27 0670  4       Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day.
A27 0680  1    Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million
A27 0680 10    Monday.
A27 0690  1       A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion
A27 0690 10    economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by
A27 0700  8    Peter G& Peterson, head of one of the world's greatest
A27 0710  7    camera firms, in a key address before the American
A27 0720  3    Marketing Assn&.
A27 0720  5       However, Peterson, president of Bell + Howell, warned
A27 0730  6    800 U&S& marketing leaders attending a national conference
A27 0740  4    at the Ambassador, that the future will belong to the
A27 0750  4    industrialist of creative and "unconventional wisdom".
A27 0760  1    #CREATION'S NEEDED#
A27 0760  3    "As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted
A27 0770  4    for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer
A27 0780  1    expenditures that will be required to reach that goal,
A27 0780 10    management can well be restless about how this tremendous
A27 0790  9    volume and number of new products will be created and
A27 0800  6    marketed", Peterson said.
A27 0810  1       "With this kind of new product log-jam, the premium
A27 0810 10    for brilliant product planning will obviously go up
A27 0820  6    geometrically".
A27 0820  7       The executive paid tribute to research and development
A27 0830  7    and technology for their great contributions in the
A27 0840  5    past, but he also cautioned industry that they tend
A27 0850  3    to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly
A27 0850 13    even pace within an industry and fail to give it the
A27 0860 10    short-term advantage which it often needs.
A27 0870  4    #NOTHING TO FEAR#
A27 0870  7    Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world
A27 0880  5    competition if it dares to be original in both marketing
A27 0890  2    and product ideas. He cited, as an example, how the
A27 0890 12    American camera industry has been able to meet successfully
A27 0900  9    the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor
A27 0910  7    costs, by improving its production know-how and technology.
A27 0920  5       He also used as an example the manufacturer who
A27 0930  3    introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany, with
A27 0940  1    the result that it became the best selling camera in
A27 0940 11    the German market.
A27 0960  1       Election of Howard L& Taylor to membership in Pacific
A27 0960 10    Coast Stock Exchange, effective Tuesday, has been announced
A27 0970  8    by Thomas P& Phelan, president of the exchange.
A27 0980  7       Taylor, president and voting stockholder of Taylor
A27 0990  6    and Co&, Beverly Hills, has been active in the securities
A27 1000  5    business since 1925.
A27 1010  1       Union Oil Co& of California Tuesday offered $120
A27 1010  9    million in debentures to the public through a group
A27 1020  9    of underwriters headed by Dillon, Read + Co&, to raise
A27 1030  7    money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp&.
A27 1040  5       Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877
A27 1050  3    shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures
A27 1060  2    plus cash, according to Union. Under the new offering,
A27 1060 11    only $60 million in debentures are convertible into
A27 1070  8    923,076 common shares.
A27 1080  1    #DUE IN 1986#
A27 1080  4    The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth
A27 1090  2    of 4-7/8 debentures, due June 1, 1986, at 100%, and
A27 1090 13    $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures
A27 1100  8    due June 1, 1991, at 100%. The convertible debentures
A27 1110  6    are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by
A27 1120  7    June 1, 1966; $70 by 1971; $75 by 1976; $80 by 1981;
A27 1130  4    $85 by 1986, and $90 thereafter.
A27 1140  1    _NEW YORK(~AP)_
A27 1140  3       - American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly
A27 1150  1    solid rise but here also trading dwindled. Volume was
A27 1150 10    1.23 million shares, down from Monday's 1.58 million.
A27 1160  7    Gains of 2-3/4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic

A27 1180  3    2-1/2 each.
A27 1190  1    _QUESTION_
A27 1190  1       - I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock
A27 1190  9    Fund on Oct& 23, 1959, and 50 more shares of the same
A27 1200 12    mutual fund on Feb& 8, 1960. Something has gone wrong
A27 1210  8    some place. I am getting dividends on only 50 shares.
A27 1220  6    In other words, I am getting only half the dividends
A27 1230  3    I should.
A27 1230  5    _ANSWER_
A27 1230  6       - Write to the fund's custodian bank- the First
A27 1240  3    National Bank of Jersey City, N&J&. That bank handles
A27 1250  4    most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock
A27 1260  1    Fund, Fundamental Investors, Diversified Investment
A27 1260  6    Fund and Television-Electronics Fund.
A27 1270  4       The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data
A27 1280  4    processing system to handle things. But it seems that
A27 1290  2    this "electronic brain" wasn't "programmed" correctly.
A27 1300  1       This resulted in a great number of errors. And letters
A27 1300 11    began to come in to this column from irate shareholders.
A27 1310 10       I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about
A27 1320 10    the situation. At that time, the people at the bank
A27 1330  6    said they felt that they had the situation in hand.
A27 1340  3    They indicated that no new errors were being made and
A27 1340 13    that all old errors would be corrected "within 60 days".
A27 1350  4       That 60-day period is over and letters are still
A27 1360  8    coming in from shareholders of these four funds, complaining
A27 1370  5    about mistakes in their accounts.
A27 1380  1       Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away
A27 1380  9    than the bankers expected. Any shareholder of any of
A27 1390  7    these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly
A27 1400  5    should get in touch with the bank.
A27 1410  1       Doyle cannot undertake to reply to inquiries. He
A27 1410  8    selects queries or general interest to answer.
A27 1430  1    _WASHINGTON (~AP)_
A27 1430  3       - Alfred Hayes, president of the Federal Reserve
A27 1440  2    Bank of New York, said Tuesday "there is no present
A27 1440 12    need for far-reaching reforms" which would basically
A27 1450  8    alter the international financial system.
A27 1460  3       Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively
A27 1470  4    with short-term capital movements between nations,
A27 1480  1    "there is no reason, in my judgment why the international
A27 1480 11    financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at
A27 1490  7    least the foreseeable future".
A27 1510  1    _WASHINGTON (~UPI)_
A27 1510  3       - New York Central Railroad president Alfred E&
A27 1520  2    Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat
A27 1520 11    of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake + Ohio and Baltimore
A27 1530  9    + Ohio Railroads merge.
A27 1540  2       Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate
A27 1540 10    effect of the merger, but could possibly be an ultimate
A27 1550 10    effect.
A27 1550 11       The railroad president made the statement in an
A27 1560  8    interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened
A27 1570  4    Round 2 of its hearing into the ~C+~O's request to
A27 1580  3    control and then merge with the ~B+~O.
A27 1590  1       "All these kind of things weaken us", Perlman said.
A27 1590 10    #BAD CONDITION#
A27 1600  2    Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore + Ohio
A27 1610  1    Railroad Co&, testified the ~B+~O was in its worst
A27 1610 10    financial condition since the depression years and
A27 1620  7    badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation
A27 1630  7    with the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad.
A27 1640  1       "The financial situation of the Baltimore + Ohio,
A27 1650  1    has become precarious- much worse than at any time
A27 1650 10    since the depression of the 1930s", he told the hearing.
A27 1660  8       ~C+~O president Walter J& Tuohy was summoned back
A27 1670  7    for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys
A27 1680  4    before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex
A27 1690  3    case.
A27 1690  4       The New York Central also has asked the ~ICC to
A27 1700  3    permit it to gain control of the ~B+~O.
A27 1710  1       Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads
A27 1710  8    in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger.
A27 1720  7    The proposed ~C+~O-~B+~O railroad would make it the
A27 1730  5    hemisphere's second largest.
A27 1740  1    _WASHINGTON (~AP)_
A27 1740  3       - The government's short-term borrowing costs rose

A27 1780  1    _WASHINGTON, MARCH 11 (~UPI)._
A27 1780  5       - "Consumer uncertain about economic conditions".
A27 1790  2       This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook
A27 1800  2    given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National
A27 1810  1    Housing Center.
A27 1810  3       Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of
A27 1820  2    the builders were "resistance to high interest rates,
A27 1820 10    cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed,
A27 1830  7    shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable
A27 1840  4    to qualify".
A27 1840  6    #INCREASE EXPECTED#
A27 1840  8    The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders'
A27 1850  9    intentions conference. It disclosed that the builders:
A27 1860  6       Expect their own production volume, and presumably
A27 1870  4    sales, to jump 30 percent in 1961.
A27 1880  1       Look for home building nationally to advance less
A27 1880  9    than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,7000 non-farm
A27 1890  8    housing starts. The industry has said 1960 was a poor
A27 1900  7    year. Starts were down 20 percent from 1959.
A27 1910  2       Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts
A27 1910  9    for themselves and for the industry?
A27 1920  6    #LEADERS OF INDUSTRY#
A27 1920  9    The reason, says the Housing Center, is that the builders
A27 1930 10    invited to the intentions conference "are generally
A27 1940  5    among the more successful businessmen, and usually
A27 1950  3    do somewhat better than their fellow builders".
A28 0010  1    _ELBURN, ILL&_
A28 0010  3       - Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in
A28 0020  2    a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales:
A28 0020 13    "We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have
A28 0030 10    good prospects for 10 more. We sold only four pickers
A28 0040  8    all last year".
A28 0040 11       Gus Ehlers, competitor of Mr& Houtz in this farm
A28 0050  8    community, says his business since August 1 is running
A28 0060  6    50% above a year earlier. "Before then, my sales during
A28 0070  5    much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20%", he
A28 0080  2    says.
A28 0080  3       Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing
A28 0090  2    are above average for their business, farm equipment
A28 0090 10    sales are climbing in most rural areas. Paradoxically,
A28 0100  8    the sales rise is due in large measure to Government
A28 0120  4    efforts to slash farm output. Although the Administration's
A28 0130  3    program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since
A28 0140  2    1934, farmers, with the help of extra fertilizer and
A28 0140 11    good weather, are getting such high yields per acre
A28 0150  8    that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines.
A28 0160  6    Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are
A28 0170  5    so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently.
A28 0190  1    The higher price supports provided by the new legislation,
A28 0200  1    together with rising prices for farm products, are
A28 0200  9    pushing up farm income, making it possible for farmers
A28 0210  6    to afford the new machinery.
A28 0220  1       Seven of the eight companies that turn out full
A28 0220 10    lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers
A28 0230  6    since the start of August have shown gains averaging
A28 0240  3    nearly 10% above last year. "In August our dealers
A28 0250  1    sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and
A28 0250 11    in September retail sales were 14% higher than last
A28 0260  8    year", says Mark V& Keeler, farm equipment vice president
A28 0270  6    of International Harvester Co&. For the year to date,
A28 0280  7    sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still
A28 0290  3    lag about 5% behind 1960.
A28 0290  8    #TWO OF THREE REPORT GAINS#
A28 0300  1    Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score
A28 0300  9    of states, two out of three report their sales since
A28 0310  9    August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier, with
A28 0320  6    the increases ranging from 5% to 50%. Not all sections
A28 0330  4    are showing an upswing, however; the drought-seared
A28 0340  1    North Central states are the most notable exceptions
A28 0340  9    to the uptrend.
A28 0350  1       The significance of the pickup in farm machinery
A28 0350  9    sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry. The
A28 0360  7    demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick
A28 0370  6    of rural buying generally. Farmers spend more of their
A28 0380  4    income on tractors and implements than on any other
A28 0380 13    group of products. More than 20 million people live
A28 0390  9    on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks,
A28 0400  7    buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide
A28 0410  4    a major market for home appliances, chemicals and other
A28 0420  2    products.
A28 0420  3       Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're
A28 0430  2    haggling less over prices than they did a year ago,
A28 0430 12    dealers report.
A28 0440  2       "Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year
A28 0440 10    so we can get more money on a sale", says Jack Martin,
A28 0450 12    who sells J& I& Case tractors and implements in Sioux
A28 0460  8    City, Iowa. "This morning, we allowed a farmer $600
A28 0470  7    on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model.
A28 0480  5    Last year, we probably would have given him $700 for
A28 0490  2    a comparable machine". Mr& Martin sold 21 tractors
A28 0490 10    in August; in August of 1960, he sold seven.
A28 0500  8    #DEALERS' STOCKS DOWN#
A28 0510  1    With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about
A28 0510  9    25% below a year ago, the affects of the rural recovery
A28 0520  8    are being felt almost immediately by the country's
A28 0530  4    farm equipment manufacturers. For example, farm equipment
A28 0540  2    shipments of International Harvester in August climbed
A28 0550  1    about 5% above a year earlier, Mr& Keeler reports.
A28 0550 10       Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson, Ltd&, of
A28 0560  7    Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from
A28 0570  7    869 in the like period a year earlier, says John Staiger,
A28 0580  4    vice president.
A28 0580  6       With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up
A28 0590  6    demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages
A28 0600  4    of some implements. Merritt D& Hill, Ford Motor Co&
A28 0610  2    vice president, says his company is starting to get
A28 0610 11    calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery
A28 0620  7    or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn
A28 0630  6    pickers.
A28 0630  7       Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961,
A28 0640  7    retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier
A28 0650  3    levels since the latter part of 1959. The rise in sales
A28 0660  1    last winter was checked when the Government's new feed
A28 0660 10    grain program was adopted; the program resulted in
A28 0670  7    a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and, as
A28 0690  5    a result, reduced the immediate need for machines.
A28 0700  1       Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and
A28 0700  9    dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly
A28 0710  9    from the recent improvement in crop prospects. Total
A28 0720  5    farm output for this year is officially forecast at
A28 0730  3    129% of the 1947-49 average, three points higher than
A28 0740  1    the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final
A28 0740 11    figure for 1960.
A28 0750  1       The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects.
A28 0750  9    Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government
A28 0760  6    this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special
A28 0770  7    subsidies and incentive payments, well above the record
A28 0780  5    $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million
A28 0790  2    of 1960. Price support loans may total another $1 billion
A28 0800  1    this year. With cash receipts from marketings expected
A28 0800  9    to be slightly above 1960, farmers' gross income is
A28 0810  7    estimated at $39.5 billion, $1.5 billion above 1960's
A28 0820  4    record high. Net income may reach $12.7 billion, up
A28 0830  2    $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953. The
A28 0830 12    Government reported last week that the index of prices
A28 0840  9    received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September
A28 0850  9    for the third consecutive month, reaching 242% of the
A28 0860  5    1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July.
A28 0880  1       KENNEDY OPPOSES any widespread relief from a High
A28 0880  9    Court depletion ruling.
A28 0890  3       The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the
A28 0900  4    case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which
A28 0900 14    it mined. The company, in figuring its taxable earnings,
A28 0910  9    deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for
A28 0920  7    its finished products. Such "depletion allowances",
A28 0930  2    in the form of percentages of sales are authorized
A28 0940  1    by tax law for specified raw materials producers using
A28 0940 10    up their assets. The High Court held that the company
A28 0950  9    must apply its percentage allowance to the value of
A28 0960  6    the raw materials removed from the ground, not to the
A28 0970  4    revenue from finished products.
A28 0970  8       A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning
A28 0980  6    softened the ruling's impact, on prior-year returns
A28 0990  4    still under review, for clay-mining companies that
A28 1000  1    make brick and tile products. The measure allows such
A28 1000 10    companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion
A28 1010  8    allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products
A28 1020  6    rather than the lower value of raw clay alone.
A28 1030  2       President Kennedy, in signing the relief measure
A28 1040  1    into law, stressed he regarded it as an exception.
A28 1040 10    "My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing
A28 1050  9    a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation
A28 1060  4    for other mineral industries", the President said.

A28 1160  1    A RULE on the Federal deductibility of state taxes
A28 1170  1    is contested.
A28 1170  3       A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax under
A28 1180  2    Federal law, on its gain from the sale of property
A28 1180 12    disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation. Louisiana,
A28 1190 10    however, collected an income tax on the profits from
A28 1200  8    the sale. The corporation, in filing its final Federal
A28 1210  4    income return, claimed the state tax payment as a deductible
A28 1220  2    expense, as permitted under U&S& tax law.
A28 1220  9       The Revenue Service disallowed the claim, invoking
A28 1230  7    a law provision that generally bars deductions for
A28 1240  2    expenses incurred in connection with what it said was
A28 1250  4    tax-exempt income. The Tax Court rejected this view.
A28 1260  1    It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed
A28 1260 13    not from the exempt status of the income but from a
A28 1270  9    special rule on corporate liquidations.
A28 1280  1       The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding

A28 1740  1    _WASHINGTON_
A28 1740  1       - Consumer spending edged down in April after rising
A28 1750  1    for two consecutive months, the Government reported.
A28 1750  8       The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted
A28 1760  5    sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18
A28 1770  5    billion in April, down 1% from the March level of more
A28 1780  4    than $18.2 billion. April sales also were 5% below
A28 1790  1    those of April last year, when volume reached a record
A28 1790 11    for any month, $18.9 billion (see chart on Page One).
A28 1800  8       The seasonal adjustment takes into account such
A28 1810  5    factors as Easter was on April 2 this year, two weeks
A28 1820  4    earlier than in 1960, and pre-Easter buying was pushed
A28 1830  1    into March.
A28 1830  3       Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain
A28 1840  2    the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge
A28 1840 12    of consumer buying in March. Adjusted sales that month
A28 1850  8    were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month
A28 1860  8    before, which in turn were slightly higher than the
A28 1870  4    January low of $17.8 billion.

A29 0210  4    Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for
A29 0220  4    a fun piece simple because "It's unlike me".

A29 0230  1    IN PRIVATE LIFE, Miss Garson is Mrs& E& E& Fogelson
A29 0240  2    and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas,
A29 0245  1    where they maintain an apartment, to their California
A29 0250  8    home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch
A29 0260  7    in Pecos, New Mexico. Therefore, her wardrobe is largely
A29 0270  5    mobile, to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake
A29 0280  4    out without a wrinkle.
A29 0280  8       Her creations in fashion are from many designers
A29 0290  5    because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any
A29 0300  3    one designer any more than she wants "all of her pictures
A29 0310  1    by one painter".
A29 0310  4    ##
A29 0310  5    A FAVORITE is Norman Norell, however. She likes his
A29 0320  5    classic chemise. Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell,
A29 0330  4    a black and white organdy and silk jersey.
A29 0330 12       Irene suits rate high because they are designed
A29 0340  8    for her long-bodied silhouette. She also likes the
A29 0345  5    femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and
A29 0360  2    Helen Rose.
A29 0360  4       Balenciaga is her favorite European designer.
A29 0370  2       "I bought my first dress from him when I was still
A29 0380  1    a struggling young actress", she reminisces. "I like
A29 0380  9    his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate
A29 0390  8    the great impact he has on fashion".
A29 0400  3    ##
A29 0400  4    BLACK AND WHITE is her favorite color combination along
A29 0410  3    with lively glowing pinks, reds, blues and greens.
A29 0420  1       Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent, Greer Garson
A29 0420  8    was born in County Down, Ireland. Her mother was a
A29 0430 10    Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney
A29 0440  6    Isles.
A29 0440  7       Reared in England, she studied to be a teacher,
A29 0450  7    earned several scholarships and was graduated with
A29 0460  2    honors from the University of London. She took postgraduate
A29 0470  1    work at the University of Grenoble in France and then
A29 0470 11    returned to London to work on market research with
A29 0480  9    an advertising firm.
A29 0480 12    ##
A29 0490  1    HER ACTING began with the Birmingham Repertory Company
A29 0500  1    and she soon became the toast of the West End. Among
A29 0500 12    stage performances was a starring role in "Golden Arrow"
A29 0510  8    directed by Noel Coward. It was during "Old Music"
A29 0520  7    at the St& James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B&
A29 0530  5    Mayer spotted her.
A29 0530  8       After signing a motion-picture contract, she came
A29 0540  8    to America and had "Goodbye, Mr& Chips" as her first
A29 0550  6    assignment after a year's wait. Other triumphs include
A29 0560  4    "Random Harvest", "Madame Curie", "Pride and Prejudice",
A29 0570  4    "The Forsythe Saga" and "Mrs& Miniver" (which won her
A29 0580  5    the Academy Award in 1943).
A29 0580 10    ##
A29 0580 11    HONORS that have come to Greer Garson are countless.
A29 0590  9    Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time
A29 0600  9    for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt
A29 0610  7    in "Sunrise at Campobello". She gave a fine portrayal
A29 0620  6    of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared
A29 0630  4    in live television from "Captain Brassbound's Conversion"
A29 0640  2    to "Camille". She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in
A29 0650  2    London, a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary
A29 0650 12    colonel in many states.
A29 0660  4       She is adept at skeet shooting, trout fishing, Afro-Cuban
A29 0670  3    and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology.
A29 0680  1    She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas
A29 0680 12    Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and
A29 0690  8    on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine
A29 0700  7    Arts. She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis
A29 0710  5    and Cancer Associations. Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher
A29 0720  6    husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America
A29 0730  4    and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that
A29 0740  1    flourishes in New Mexico.
A29 0750  1       Back in college, today's handsome Gander was the
A29 0750  9    only male member of a Texas Tech class on food. The
A29 0760 10    pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long- but
A29 0770  6    he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy.
A29 0780  1       Last October he gave a public speech in Washington,
A29 0780 10    D&C& entitled "Are Women Here to Stay"? So you can
A29 0790 10    see that Gerald G& Ramsey, director of ~SMU's food
A29 0800  7    services, is not the ordinary type of craven, women-trodden
A29 0810  7    chef. He is apt to rear back and claim his rights.
A29 0820  5    ##
A29 0820  6    RAMSEY, as ~SMU's food wrangler, buys enough groceries
A29 0830  5    to serve 32,000 meals a week. Tell that to the little
A29 0840  5    wife when she moans at the woman's burden!
A29 0850  1       He also dishes up 3,000 snacks. And he operates
A29 0850 10    three cafeterias in the Student Center, along with
A29 0860  7    McElvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables.
A29 0870  3       Ramsey, 6-3, 195 and ruggedly slim, says, "I can't
A29 0880  3    remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me
A29 0890  1    to cook".
A29 0890  3    ##
A29 0890  4    HE WAS IN CHARGE of the Hockaday School meals from
A29 0900  3    1946 to 1950, before he moved to ~SMU. And you'll notice
A29 0910  2    that in both places, there are acres of charming young
A29 0910 12    ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line.
A29 0920 10       What does he feed his ~SMU football mastodons at
A29 0930  6    the training table?
A29 0940  1       "Mostly meat and potatoes- they have to have that
A29 0940  9    go-go-go without getting too fat", says Ramsey. So
A29 0950  7    he hides the mayonnaise. And to keep athletes' stomachs
A29 0960  4    from getting jumpy under physical duress, he bans all
A29 0970  4    highly flavored condiments.
A29 0970  7    ##
A29 0970  8    WHAT DO the pretty ~SMU girls like on their plates?
A29 0980  8       "Pretty much hamburger, hotdogs, steak and, at night,
A29 0990  7    maybe pizza", says the handsome food expert. "Unfortunately,
A29 1000  4    there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower".
A29 1010  4       Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman, Henry Cabot Lodge,
A29 1020  4    the King of Morocco, Clement Atlee and other shiny
A29 1030  3    characters. Once four Tibetan monks, in their saffron
A29 1030 11    robes, filed through the cafeteria line.
A29 1040  6       "They aren't supposed to look at women, you know",
A29 1050  7    Ramsey recalled. "What with all those pretty girls
A29 1060  4    around, they had a hard time".
A29 1060 10    #CHICKEN CADILLAC#
A29 1070  1    Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest. Salt
A29 1070 11    and pepper each breast. Dip in melted butter and roll
A29 1080  9    in flour. Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking
A29 1090  8    pan. Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F& until
A29 1100  3    lightly brown.
A29 1100  5       Add enough warmed cream, seasoned to taste with
A29 1110  4    onion juice, to about half cover the chicken breasts.
A29 1120  1    Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer.
A29 1120  9       While this is baking, saute mushrooms, fresh or
A29 1130  5    canned, in butter. Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts.
A29 1140  4    Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham
A29 1150  1    and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes.
A29 1150  7       (Leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac,
A29 1160  8    says Ramsey.)
A29 1170  1       Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor
A29 1170  8    straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern, many
A29 1180  7    design facets, warmth, dignity and an effect of utter
A29 1190  6    comfort and livability.
A29 1190  9       That is the goal of two new collections being introduced
A29 1200  8    in Dallas this month.
A29 1210  1       Though there has been some avant garde indication
A29 1210  9    that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy
A29 1220  8    look of the '20's and '40's, two manufacturers chose
A29 1230  4    to take the approach of the sophisticated, but warm
A29 1240  3    look in contemporary. These two, Heritage and Drexel,
A29 1250  1    chose too not to produce the exactly matching design
A29 1250 10    for every piece, but a collection of correlated designs,
A29 1260  7    each of which could stand alone.
A29 1270  1       The Heritage collection, to be shown by Sanger-Harris
A29 1270 10    and Anderson's Studio, has perhaps more different types
A29 1280  8    of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer
A29 1290  6    ever assembled together at one time. Called Perennian,
A29 1300  4    to indicate its lasting, good today and tomorrow quality,
A29 1310  2    the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical
A29 1310 10    pieces.
A29 1320  1       Walnut, wormy chestnut, pecan, three varieties of
A29 1320  8    burl, hand-woven Philippine cane, ceramic tiles, marble
A29 1330  8    are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of
A29 1340  7    permanence, the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled
A29 1350  4    floors, brick or paneled walls, windows that bring
A29 1360  1    in the outdoors. It is a collection with a custom-design
A29 1360 12    look, offering simplicity with warmth, variety and
A29 1370  6    vitality.
A29 1370  7       The Drexel collection, called Composite, to be shown
A29 1380  6    by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating,
A29 1390  4    a mature modern that is a variation of many designs.
A29 1400  2       Rounded posts give a soft, sculptured look, paneled
A29 1410  1    doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus
A29 1410 10    softening arches, table tops are inlaid in Macassar
A29 1420  7    ebony or acacia. A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach
A29 1430  6    serving, a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked
A29 1440  3    under each end, recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch
A29 1450  1    long chest.
A29 1450  3       An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented,
A29 1460  1    with a young, basic, functional group of chests, dressers
A29 1460 10    and corner units and a canted headboard. The other
A29 1470  9    bedroom has heavier styling, door-fronted dressers
A29 1480  4    with acacia panels, a poster bed or a bed with arched
A29 1490  3    acacia panels and matching mirror.
A29 1490  8       Colorful, bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics, with
A29 1500  5    the magenta, pink and white tones predominating as
A29 1510  3    well as golden shades are used with Composite. The
A29 1520  1    fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles.
A29 1530  1       Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms
A29 1530  8    but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's
A29 1540  5    fall 1961 group, Composite. The spider-leg pedestal
A29 1550  5    table has a base finished in an ebony, to set off the
A29 1560  4    lustrous brown of the walnut top. See-through design
A29 1560 13    of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back
A29 1570  9    and an Oriental shoji flavor. To bring warmth to the
A29 1580  7    dining area, golden orange tones are used in the fabrics.
A29 1590  6       Dignity and comfort, in a contemporary manner, reflecting
A29 1600  3    the best aspects of today's design, with substance
A29 1610  1    and maturity, keynote the Perennian collection from
A29 1610  8    Heritage. Center panel, hand-screened wood, actually
A29 1620  6    is a back of one of the tall bookcases. Mellow bronzy-green-gold
A29 1630  6    fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic
A29 1640  5    accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander
A29 1650  1    Smith carpet in all wool loop pile.
A29 1660  1       The Vagabonds are "on the road" again. Members are
A29 1660 10    on their way to Saledo, not by stage coach, but in
A29 1670 10    air-conditioned cars.
A29 1680  1       This coming weekend they have reserved the entire
A29 1680  9    Stagecoach Inn and adjoining country club, Saledo,
A29 1690  6    for festivities. Invitations have been extended to
A29 1700  5    some Austin dignitaries including Gov& and Mrs& Price
A29 1710  3    Daniel.
A29 1710  4       Stagecoach Days is the theme for the weekend on
A29 1720  3    the Old Chisholm Trail.
A29 1720  7    ##
A29 1720  8    THE GET-TOGETHER Friday night will be a banquet at
A29 1730  8    the country club patio and pool, and an orchestra will
A29 1740  5    play for dancing.
A29 1740  8       Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm
A29 1750  5    Trail Days. Ginghams and calico will be popular dress
A29 1760  4    for the women. The men will be in western attire, including
A29 1770  2    Stetsons and colored vests.
A29 1770  6    ##
A29 1770  7    DECORATING the ballroom will be the yellow rose of
A29 1790  7    Texas, in tall bushes; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes.
A29 1800  4    There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with
A29 1810  3    eyes that flash at the guests.
A29 1810  9       Mr& and Mrs& Phil G& Abell are chairmen for the
A29 1820  8    Saledo trip. Committee members aiding them in planning
A29 1830  5    the entertainment are ~Messrs and ~Mmes Roy McKee,
A29 1840  3    George McElyee, Jack Fanning, W& H& Roquemore and Joe
A29 1850  3    Darrow.
A29 1850  4    ##
A29 1850  5    THE TRAVEL CLUB is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples
A29 1860  5    who have as their motto "Go Somewhere, Anywhere, Everywhere".
A29 1870  2    Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of
A29 1880  2    1962 when they go to Europe.
A29 1880  8       In the past, the men and women have chartered planes
A29 1890  4    to Las Vegas and Jamaica, buses to Mineral Wells and
A29 1900  3    Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport
A29 1900 10    and Galveston.
A29 1910  2       Four parties are given a year. Two of these are
A29 1920  1    in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity.
A29 1920 12       Serving on the club's board are ~Mmes R& P& Anderson,
A29 1930 10    president; A& F& Schmalzried, secretary; W& H& Roquemore,
A29 1950  1    treasurer, and the following chairmen: ~Mmes McKee,
A29 1950  8    publicity; Lawrence B& Jones, yearbook, and Sam Laughlin,
A29 1960  8    scrapbook.
A30 0010  1       A cooky with caramel filling and chocolate frosting
A30 0010  9    won $25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th
A30 0020  8    annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday.
A30 0030  2       Mrs& Alice H& Reese, wife of an engineer and mother
A30 0040  2    of a 23-year-old son, was awarded the top prize at
A30 0040 14    a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Mrs& Reese
A30 0050  8    entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals.
A30 0060  7       Second grand prize of $5,000 went to Mrs& Clara
A30 0070  7    L& Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring, a rich yeast
A30 0080  5    bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze.
A30 0090  1    #MOTHER OF FIVE#
A30 0090  3    Mrs& Oliver is mother of five children and wife of
A30 0100  2    a machinist. She lives in Wellsville, Mo&.
A30 0100  9       Mrs& Reese baked her cookies for only the third
A30 0110  8    time in the Bake-off finals. And the third time was
A30 0120  6    the charm.
A30 0120  8       She dreamed up the cooky recipe, tried it, liked
A30 0130  4    it and entered it in the contest. The second baking
A30 0140  1    was for photographing when told she was a finalist.
A30 0140 10    The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton
A30 0150  9    ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges.
A30 0170  1       Mr& and Mrs& Joseph R& Bolker will give a dinner
A30 0180  1    on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs&
A30 0180 12    Norman Chandler, chairman of the Music Center Building
A30 0190  7    Fund Committee, and Mr& Chandler.
A30 0200  3       Mr& Bolker heads a group within the building and
A30 0210  2    development industry to raise funds in support of this
A30 0210 11    cultural center for the performing arts.
A30 0220  6       A feature of the party will be a presentation by
A30 0230  5    Welton Becket, center architect, of color slides and
A30 0240  2    renderings of the three-building complex.
A30 0240  8    #FOLIAGE WILL GLOW AT FORMAL FALL PARTY#
A30 0250  5    Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los Angeles
A30 0260  2    Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening.
A30 0270  1    More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which
A30 0270 11    is matched in the spring.
A30 0280  3       Among those with reservations are Messrs& and Mmes&
A30 0290  2    William A& Thompson, Van Cott Niven, A& B& Cox, David
A30 0300  2    Bricker, Samuel Perry and Robert D& Stetson.
A30 0310  1       Others are Drs& and Mmes& Alfred Robbins, and J&
A30 0310 10    Lafe Ludwig and Gen& and Mrs& Leroy Watson.
A30 0320  7    #GUESTS FROM ACROSS U&S& HONOR DR& SWIM#
A30 0330  4    When Dr& W& A& Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at
A30 0340  4    the Wilshire Country Club, guests came by chartered
A30 0350  1    plane from all over the country.
A30 0350  7       A flight originating in Florida picked up guests
A30 0360  5    on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from
A30 0370  3    Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points.
A30 0380  1       Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more
A30 0380 10    than 100 persons who had known Dr& Swim when he practiced
A30 0390  9    in Los Angeles. He started practice in 1917, and served
A30 0400  6    on the State Board of Medical Examiners.
A30 0420  1       Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for
A30 0420 11    Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg, a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler
A30 0430  7    had predicted would have a promising career on the
A30 0440  7    concert stage.
A30 0440  9       A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end
A30 0450  9    to the 10-hour daily practicing. She put the violin
A30 0460  5    away and took out some linen, needles and yarn to while
A30 0470  2    away the long, idle days in Budapest.
A30 0470  9       Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on
A30 0480  5    two continents and, at 26, she feels she is on the
A30 0490  4    threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles.
A30 0490 13       Her days as an art student at the University of
A30 0500 10    Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian
A30 0510  5    uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled
A30 0520  3    to Vienna.
A30 0520  5       There they continued their studies at the university,
A30 0530  4    she in art, he in architecture. And there she had her
A30 0540  2    first showing of tapestry work.
A30 0550  1       There's a lot of talk about the problem of education
A30 0550 11    in America today. What most people don't seem to realize,
A30 0560  9    if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am, is that
A30 0570 11    90% of the problem is transportation.
A30 0580  1       I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved
A30 0590  1    until, at long last, both of my boys got squeezed into
A30 0590 12    high school. It seems like only last year that we watched
A30 0600 10    them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day
A30 0610  9    in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar
A30 0620  4    school.
A30 0620  5       Getting to and from school was no problem. They
A30 0630  3    either walked or were driven.
A30 0630  8    #@#
A30 0630  9    Now they go to a high school that is two miles away.
A30 0640  9    One might think the problem would be similar. They
A30 0650  4    could walk, ride on a bus or be driven.
A30 0660  1       It's much more complex than that. Generally, they
A30 0660  9    go to school with a girl named Gloriana, who lives
A30 0670  7    down the block, and has a car.
A30 0680  1       This is a way of getting to school, but, I understand,
A30 0680 12    it entails a certain loss of social status. A young
A30 0690  9    man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school
A30 0700  7    in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher
A30 0710  4    class than he is, and is also a girl.
A30 0710 13       "Why don't you walk to school then"? I suggested.
A30 0720  8    "My father walked, through two miles of snow, in Illinois".
A30 0730  8       "Did you"? I was asked.
A30 0740  4       "No", I said, "I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois".
A30 0750  4       I explained, however, that I had my share of hardship
A30 0760  3    in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom.
A30 0760 13    #@#
A30 0770  1    I had to ride a streetcar two miles. Sometimes the
A30 0770 11    streetcar was late. Sometimes there weren't even any
A30 0780  8    seats. I had to stand up, with the ladies. Sometimes
A30 0790  6    I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at
A30 0800  4    all, but wound up at the ocean, or some other dismal
A30 0800 15    place, and had to spend the day there.
A30 0810  8       I've tried to compromise by letting them take the
A30 0820  6    little car now and then. When they do that my wife
A30 0830  3    has to drive me to work in the big car. She has to
A30 0830 16    have at least one car herself. I feel a certain loss
A30 0840 10    of status when I am driven up in front of work in a
A30 0850  8    car driven by my wife, who is only a woman.
A30 0860  1       Even that isn't satisfactory. If they have to take
A30 0860 10    any car, they'd rather take the big one. They say that
A30 0870 10    when they take a car, Gloriana doesn't take her car,
A30 0880  7    but rides with them. But when Gloriana rides with them
A30 0890  5    they also have to take the two girls who usually ride
A30 0900  2    with her, so the little car isn't big enough.
A30 0900 11    #@#
A30 0900 12    The logic of that is impeccable, of course, except
A30 0910  9    that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in
A30 0920  8    a little car, by my wife, when everybody knows I have
A30 0930  4    a big car and am capable of driving myself.
A30 0930 13       The solution, naturally, is the bus. However, it's
A30 0940  8    a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to
A30 0950  9    the bus, and it's too hard on my legs.
A30 0960  2       My wife could drive us down the hill and we could
A30 0960 13    all walk from there. But that's hardly realistic.
A30 0980  7       Nobody walks any more but crackpots and Harry Truman,
A30 0990  7    and he's already got an education.
A30 1010  1       Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does
A30 1010 10    not mention names dropped as did the notices for the
A30 1020  9    New York Social Register which made news last week.
A30 1030  6       Published annually by William Hord Richardson, the
A30 1040  4    1962 edition, subtitled Society Register of Southern
A30 1050  2    California, is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's
A30 1060  1    postman.
A30 1060  2       Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book "but
A30 1070  1    it still remains the compact reference book used by
A30 1070 10    so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers,
A30 1080  6    addresses, other residences, club affiliations and
A30 1100  3    marriages".
A30 1100  4    #STARS FOR MARRIAGE#
A30 1100  7    Stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages
A30 1110  7    during the past year. Last two to be added before the

A30 1220  7    Jr&, to Todd Huntington, son of the David Huntingtons.
A30 1240  6    #PASADENA LISTINGS#
A30 1240  8    Listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the
A30 1250 10    new book are Mr& and Mrs& Samuel Moody Haskins /3,.
A30 1260  5    She is the former Judy Chapman, daughter of John S&

A30 1360  4    residence in Southern California for Mexico City.
A30 1370  2    #MORE NEW ADDRESSES#
A30 1370  5    Judge and Mrs& Julian Hazard are now at Laguna Beach,

A30 1480  7    Mrs& Werner H& Althaus, formerly of Switzerland.
A30 1500  1       HERE'S an idea for a child's room that is easy to
A30 1500 12    execute and is completely charming, using puppets for
A30 1510  8    lamp bases. Most children love the animated puppet
A30 1520  5    faces and their flexible bodies, and they prefer to
A30 1530  4    see them as though the puppets were in action, rather
A30 1530 14    than put away in boxes. Displayed as lamps, the puppets
A30 1540 10    delight the children and are decorative accent.
A30 1550  5       To create such a lamp, order a wired pedestal from
A30 1560  5    any lamp shop. Measure the puppet to determine the
A30 1570  2    height of the light socket, allowing three to four
A30 1570 11    inches above the puppet's head. Make sure that the
A30 1580  7    metal tube through which the wire passes is in the
A30 1590  5    shape of an inverted "~L", the foot of the "~L" about
A30 1600  3    three inches long, so that the puppet can hang directly
A30 1610  1    under the light.
A30 1610  4    #PULLING STRINGS#
A30 1610  6    Using the strings that manipulate the puppet, suspend
A30 1620  4    him from the light fixture by tying the strings to
A30 1630  3    the lamp base. In this way, you can arrange his legs
A30 1630 14    and arms in any desired position, with feet, or one
A30 1640  9    foot, barely resting on the pedestal. If the puppets
A30 1650  6    are of uniform size, you can change them in accord
A30 1660  3    with your child's whims.
A30 1660  7       Although a straight drum shade would be adequate
A30 1670  5    and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be
A30 1680  2    changed without disharmony, it is far more fun to create
A30 1680 12    shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime. Those
A30 1690 10    illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round.
A30 1700 10    The scalloped edge is particularly appealing.
A30 1720  1       TODAY'S trend toward furniture designs from America's
A30 1730  1    past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed
A30 1730 10    respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial
A30 1740  6    era.
A30 1740  7       A generation ago there were plenty of people who
A30 1750  7    appreciated antiques and fine reproductions. In the
A30 1760  3    background lurked the feeling, however, that these
A30 1760 10    pieces, beautiful as they were, lacked the utilitarian
A30 1770  8    touch. So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out
A30 1780  6    with heavy, nondescript pieces that supposedly could
A30 1790  3    take the "hard knocks", while the fine secretary was
A30 1800  2    relegated to the parlor where it was for show only.
A30 1800 12       This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's,
A30 1810 10    according to decorator consultant, Leland Alden.
A30 1820  4       Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways
A30 1830  4    of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs,
A30 1840  1    says Mr& Alden and they are doing it largely because
A30 1840 11    Colonial craftsmen had "an innate sense of the practical".
A30 1850  9    #SOLID INVESTMENT#
A30 1860  1    There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century
A30 1870  1    designer had to develop "down to earth" designs- or
A30 1870 10    go out of business.
A31 0010  1       HOTEL ESCAPE'S Bonanza room has a real bonanza in
A31 0020  1    its new attraction, the versatile "Kings /4, Plus Two".
A31 0030  1       This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long
A31 0030 13    while- a well integrated, fast moving outfit specializing
A31 0040  6    in skits, vocals, comedy and instrumentals all of it
A31 0050  6    distinctly displaying the pro touch.
A31 0060  1       Show spotlights the Kings- George Worth, Bill Kay,
A31 0060  9    Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson, flanked by Dave Grossman
A31 0070  9    and Ron Stevens.
A31 0080  1       The plus two remain at a fixed position with drums
A31 0090  1    and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a
A31 0090 11    batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine,
A31 0100  6    and the beat is solid.
A31 0100 11       In the comedy division, the Kings simply augmenting
A31 0110  8    talent and imagination with a few props. Net result
A31 0120  7    is some crazy-wonderful nonsense, part of which can
A31 0130  4    be classed as pure slapstick.
A31 0130  9       Kings /4, have rated as a popular act in Vegas and
A31 0140 10    Western nightclubs. If they can't chalk up BIG business

A31 0290  5    AL FIKE, an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado, is currently
A31 0300  4    pursuing the three ~R's- rhythm, reminiscence and repartee-
A31 0310  3    in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel.
A31 0320  2       Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes
A31 0320 12    for a smoother operation but it's substantially the
A31 0330  8    same format heard last spring.
A31 0340  3       Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano, Wes Robbins,
A31 0350  1    bass and trumpet, and Jack Kelly on drums. It's a solid
A31 0350 12    show but, except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie,
A31 0360  9    it's Al's all the way.
A31 0370  4       Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality,
A31 0380  1    and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience.

A31 0390 10    himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers
A31 0400  7    in on the act.

A31 1080  3       - A series of high school assemblies to acquaint
A31 1090  1    junior and senior students with the Junior Achievement
A31 1090  9    program begins at St& Thomas Aquinas Monday.
A31 1100  6       Subsequent assemblies will be held at Stranahan
A31 1110  6    High School Tuesday, at Pompano Beach High Wednesday,
A31 1120  3    and at Fort Lauderdale high Thursday.
A31 1120  9       The business education program operates with the
A31 1130  7    cooperation of local high schools and business firms.
A31 1150  1       Is there anything a frustrated individual can do
A31 1150  9    about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and
A31 1160  7    around the world?
A31 1170  1       More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there
A31 1170  9    is and as many more are expected to prove it again
A31 1180  7    for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p&m& Sunday
A31 1190  6    at First Presbyterian Church.
A31 1190 10       At that time the second half of the Christian Youth
A31 1200  9    Crusade against Communism will be staged. A young real
A31 1210  7    estate salesman, Kern first got seriously interested
A31 1220  4    in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy
A31 1230  2    Air Force. He was particularly struck by a course on
A31 1230 12    Communist brainwashing.
A31 1240  2       Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy
A31 1250  3    of Communism, but never felt there was anything he,
A31 1260  1    as an individual, could do about it.
A31 1260  8       When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade
A31 1270  4    school here about six months ago, Jim became convinced
A31 1280  4    that an individual can do something constructive in
A31 1300  2    the ideological battle and set out to do it.
A31 1300 11       The best approach, he figured, was to try to influence
A31 1310  8    young people like the high schoolers he and his wife
A31 1320  6    serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church.
A31 1330  1       And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only
A31 1330 12    learn about Communist but also about what he feels
A31 1340  9    is the only antidote- a Biblically strong Christianity.
A31 1350  7       So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn
A31 1360  5    developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult
A31 1370  4    advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat
A31 1380  1    enthralled at the four-hour program.
A31 1380  7       This Sunday those attending the second session will
A31 1390  5    hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation; a review
A31 1400  3    of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack,
A31 1410  1    another real estate agent who became interested as
A31 1410  9    a philosophy major at the University of Miami; and
A31 1420  8    talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in
A31 1430  6    learning about and fighting Communism during high school
A31 1440  3    and college days, by Ted Place, director of Greater
A31 1440 12    Miami Youth for Christ, and Jon Braun, director of
A31 1450  9    Campus Crusade for Christ.
A31 1460  3       The second half of the film "Communism on the Map"
A31 1470  3    and the movie "Operation Abolition" also will be shown.
A31 1480  1       Response to the program has been so encouraging,
A31 1480  9    Kern said, that a city-wide youth school at Dade County
A31 1490 11    Auditorium may be set up soon.
A31 1500  4       And to encourage other churches to try their own
A31 1510  1    programs, Kern said this Sunday's sessions- including
A31 1510  8    the free dinner- will be open to anyone who makes reservations.
A31 1530  1       The need for and the way to achieve a Christian
A31 1530 11    home will be stressed in special services marking National
A31 1540  7    Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week.
A31 1550  7       Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter
A31 1560  4    family, 3181 ~SW 24th Ter&, will be the Family Dedication
A31 1570  3    Service planned for 10:50 a&m& Sunday at First Christian
A31 1580  3    Church.
A31 1580  4       It will be the second time the assistant manager
A31 1590  4    of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken
A31 1600  2    part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with
A31 1600 12    new babies.
A31 1610  1       The first one, two years ago, changed the routine
A31 1610 10    of their home life.
A31 1620  3       "When you stand up in public and take vows to strive
A31 1630  2    to set an example before your children and to teach
A31 1630 12    them the fundamentals of the Christian faith, you strive
A31 1640  8    a little harder to uphold those vows", explains the
A31 1650  5    slender vice president of the young couples Sunday
A31 1670  2    school class.
A31 1670  4       Until that first dedication service, he and Lois
A31 1680  4    felt their children were too young to take part in
A31 1690  1    any religious life at home. They have five daughters-
A31 1690 10    Coral Lee, 5, Glenda Rae, 4, Pamela, 3, Karen, 2, and
A31 1700 10    Shari, five months.
A31 1710  1       But after that service, they decided to try to let
A31 1710 11    the girls say grace at the table, have bedtime prayers,
A31 1720  8    and Bible stories. To their surprise, the children
A31 1730  4    all were eager and quite able to take part. Even the
A31 1740  3    two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time
A31 1740 15    without her.

A31 1860  3    EVERY family of Riviera Presbyterian Church has been
A31 1870  4    asked to read the Bible and pray together daily during
A31 1880  2    National Christian Family Week and to undertake one
A31 1880 10    project in which all members of the family participate.
A31 1890  9       To start the week of special programs at the church,
A31 1900  9    the Rev& John D& Henderson will preach on "A Successful
A31 1910  7    Marriage" at 9:40 and 11 a&m& Sunday. New officers

A32 0010  1       Enrique Jorda, conductor and musical director of
A32 0010  8    the San Francisco Symphony, will fulfill two more guest
A32 0020  7    conducting engagements in Europe before returning home
A32 0030  6    to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season, it
A32 0040  3    was announced.
A32 0040  5       The guest assignments are scheduled for November
A32 0050  3    14 and 18, with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in
A32 0060  2    Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne. The season
A32 0060 11    in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert
A32 0070  9    on November 22.
A32 0080  1       During his five-month visit abroad, Jorda recently
A32 0080  9    conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique de Bordeau in
A32 0090  7    France, and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome.
A32 0100  5       In announcing Jorda's return, the orchestra also
A32 0110  4    announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th
A32 0120  2    anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box
A32 0120 11    office on Wednesday.
A32 0130  2       Guest performers and conductors during the coming
A32 0140  1    season will include many renowned artists who began
A32 0140  9    their careers playing with the orchestra, including
A32 0150  5    violinists Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, Ruggiero Ricci
A32 0160  4    and David Abel; pianists Leon Fleisher, Ruth Slenczynka
A32 0170  3    and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray.
A32 0190  1       The Leningrad Kirov Ballet, which opened a series
A32 0190  9    of performances Friday night at the Opera House, is,
A32 0200  8    I think, the finest "classical" ballet company I have
A32 0210  5    ever seen, and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky
A32 0220  4    "Sleeping Beauty" with which it began the series is
A32 0230  4    incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure
A32 0230 13    of witnessing.
A32 0240  2       This work is no favorite of mine. I am prepared
A32 0250  1    to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit
A32 0250 11    of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar, infantile, and
A32 0260  8    reactionary aspect; that its persistent use by ballet
A32 0270  6    companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that
A32 0280  3    old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it
A32 0280 13    ever was; that its presentation in this country is
A32 0290  8    part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people;
A32 0300  6    that its choreography is undistinguished and its score
A32 0310  4    a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms. All of
A32 0320  2    this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in
A32 0320 13    the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation.
A32 0330  6    #PRECISE#
A32 0330  7    The reasons for this enchantment are numerous, but
A32 0340  7    most of them end in "ova", "eva", or "aya". In other
A32 0350  6    words, no merely male creature can resist that corps
A32 0360  5    de ballet. It seems to have been chosen exclusively
A32 0370  1    from the winners of beauty contests- Miss Omsk, Miss
A32 0370 10    Pinsk, Miss Stalingr **h oops, skip it.
A32 0380  7       These qualities alone, however, would not account
A32 0390  5    for their success, and it took me a while to discover
A32 0400  2    the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective
A32 0410  1    personality. It is a kind of friendliness and frankness
A32 0410 10    of address toward the audience which we have been led
A32 0420  9    to believe was peculiar to the American ballet.
E32 0430  4    Oh-the-pain-of-it,
A32 0430  9    that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls
A32 0440  5    convey the idea that they are all the daughters of
A32 0450  2    impoverished Grand Dukes driven to thestage out of
A32 0450 10    filial piety, is totally absent from the Kirov. This
A32 0460  8    is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to
A32 0470  6    ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics.
A32 0480  2    But, obviously, at least some things have changed for
A32 0490  1    the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned.
A32 0490 12       Irina Kolpakova, the Princess Aurora of Friday's
A32 0500  7    performance, would be a change for the better anywhere,
A32 0510  8    at any time, no matter who had had the role before.
A32 0520  4    She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes
A32 0530  1    on, and her dancing has a feminine suavity, lightness,
A32 0530 10    sparkle, and refinement which are simply incomparable.
A32 0540  5    #HIT#
A32 0540  6    Alla Sizova, who seems to have made a special hit in
A32 0550  9    the East, was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her
A32 0560  4    partner, Yuri Soloviev, was wonderfully virile, acrobatic,
A32 0570  2    and poetic all at the same time, in a tradition not
A32 0570 13    unlike that of Nijinsky. Vladilen Semenov, a fine "danseur
A32 0580  9    noble"; Konstantin Shatilov, a great character dancer;
A32 0590  7    and Inna Zubkovskaya, an excellent Lilac Fairy, were
A32 0600  6    other outstanding members of the cast, but every member
A32 0610  5    of the cast was magnificent.
A32 0610 10       The production, designed by Simon Virsaladze, was
A32 0620  6    completely traditional but traditional in the right
A32 0630  5    way. It was done with great taste, was big and spacious,
A32 0640  2    sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly
A32 0640 12    costumes, but sumptuous in a muted, pastel-like style,
A32 0650  9    with rich, quiet harmonies of color between the costumes
A32 0660  6    themselves and between the costumes and the scenery.
A32 0670  4       Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large
A32 0680  2    orchestra, one containing excellent soloists- the violin
A32 0690  1    solos by the concertmaster, Guy Lumia, were especially
A32 0690  9    fine- but one in which the core of traveling players
A32 0700  8    and the body of men added locally had not had time
A32 0710  5    to achieve much unity.
A32 0720  1       Mail orders are now being received for the series
A32 0720 10    of concerts to be given this season under the auspices
A32 0730  9    of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society.
A32 0740  3       The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers
A32 0750  2    in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p& m& with
A32 0760  1    a concert by the Mills Chamber Players.
A32 0760  8       Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert
A32 0770 10    season; annual members may attend for $16. Participating
A32 0780  5    members may attend five of the concerts for $9 (not
A32 0800  4    all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier
A32 0800 12    in The Chronicle).

A32 0840  1       San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week
A32 0840  8    with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys
A32 0850  8    for distribution to needy children.
A32 0860  1       Fire Fighters Local 798, which is sponsoring the
A32 0860  9    toy program for the 12th straight year, issued a call
A32 0870  9    for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys, which
A32 0880  7    will be repaired by off-duty firemen.
A32 0890  1       Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year.
A32 0890 10    They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View
A32 0900 10    Federal Savings and Loan Association, at a collection
A32 0910  6    center in the center of the Stonestown mall, and at
A32 0920  4    the Junior Museum, 16th street and Roosevelt way.
A32 0930  1       From the collection centers, toys will be taken
A32 0930  9    to a warehouse at 198 Second street, where they will
A32 0940  8    be repaired and made ready for distribution.
A32 0950  3       Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain
A32 0960  2    toys by writing to Christmas Toys, 676 Howard street,
A32 0960 11    San Francisco 5, and listing the parent's name and
A32 0970  9    address and the age and sex of each child in the family
A32 0980  9    between the ages of 1 and 12. Requests must be mailed
A32 0990  4    in by December 5. Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his
A32 1000  7    instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday
A32 1010  5    and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal. He
A32 1020  2    was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow
A32 1020 13    night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin. President
A32 1030  9    Kennedy's invitation to the Spanish-born master said,
A32 1040  8    "We feel your performance as one of the world's greatest
A32 1050  8    artists would lend distinction to the entertainment
A32 1060  4    of our guests".
A32 1070  1       FOR A GOOD MANY SEASONS I've been looking at the
A32 1070 11    naughty stuff on television, so the other night I thought
A32 1080 10    I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other
A32 1090  8    side of the fence in movies. After all, this year's
A32 1100  4    movies are next year's television shows.
A32 1110  1       So I went to see "La Dolce Vita".
A32 1110  9       It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality.
A32 1120  7    All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected
A32 1130  6    into this three-hour film. If that's all the Romans
A32 1140  4    did, it's a surprise to me that Rome fell.
A32 1150  1       After television, "La Dolce Vita" seems as harmless
A32 1150  8    as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night. I cannot
A32 1160 10    imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier
A32 1170  8    manner on ~TV every week.
A32 1180  1       I believe ~TV watchers will be bored.
A32 1180  8       "La Dolce Vita" has none of the senseless brutality
A32 1190  8    or sadism of the average ~TV Western. Week in, week
A32 1200  6    out, there is more sex to be seen in "The Adventures
A32 1210  4    of Ozzie and Harriet". There is more decadence on "77
A32 1220  3    Sunset Strip". There are more obvious nymphomaniacs
A32 1230  1    on any private-eye series.
A32 1230  6    #@#
A32 1230  7    IN ANOTHER RESPECT, television viewers will feel right
A32 1240  6    at home because most of the actors are unknowns. With
A32 1250  4    the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg, the credits
A32 1260  3    are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge
A32 1270  1    Theater.
A32 1270  2       Most of the emphasis has been placed on a "wild
A32 1280  1    party" at a seaside villa. Producer Fellini should
A32 1280  9    have looked at some of the old silent films where they
A32 1290  9    really had PARTIES! The Dolce Vita get-together boasted
A32 1300  7    a strip tease (carried as far as a black slip); a lady
A32 1310  8    drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around
A32 1320  4    on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her
A32 1330  1    face; a frigid beauty, and three silly fairies.
A32 1330  9       Put them all together and they spell out the only
A32 1340  8    four-letter word I can think of: dull.
A32 1350  2       Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties
A32 1360  1    had begun to pall. What a swinging group they must
A32 1360 11    have been when they first started entertaining!

A32 1370  6    AS A MORAL SHOCKER it is a dud. But this doesn't detract
A32 1380  9    from its merit as an interesting, if not great, film.
A32 1390  6    The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly:
A32 1400  5       "This is a long picture and a controversial one,
A32 1410  2    but basically it is a moral, enthralling and heartbreaking
A32 1420  1    description of humans who have become unlinked from
A32 1420  9    life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political,
A32 1430  7    cultural and religious glories".
A32 1440  2       And when they sell it to television in a couple
A32 1450  1    of years, it can be shown without editing.

A32 1610  1       THE WEEK WENT along briskly enough. I bought a new
A32 1610 11    little foreign bomb. It is a British bomb. Very austere
A32 1620 10    yet racy.
A32 1630  1       It is very chic to drive foreign cars. With a foreign
A32 1630 12    car you must wear a cap- it has a leather band in the
A32 1640 11    back. You must also wear a car coat.
A32 1650  4       The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive.
A32 1660  1    But we couldn't really get along without it.

A32 1660 10    "WHERE DO YOU put the lighter fluid, ha, ha"? asked
A32 1670 10    the gas station man. The present crop of small cars
A32 1680  8    is enriching American humor.
A32 1690  1       Gas station people are very debonair about small
A32 1690  9    cars.
A32 1700  1       When I drove a car with tail fins, I had plenty
A32 1700 11    status at the wind-and-water oases. My car gulped 20
A32 1710  6    gallons without even wiping its mouth.
A32 1720  1       This excellent foreign bomb takes only six.
A32 1720  8       When I had my big job with the double headlights
A32 1730 10    and yards of chrome, the gas people were happy to see
A32 1740  7    me.
A32 1740  8       "Tires OK? Check the oil and water, sir?"
A32 1750  6       They polished the windshield. They had a loving
A32 1760  5    touch.
A32 1760  6    #@#
A32 1760  7    THE MAN STUCK the nozzle in the gas tank. "What kind
A32 1770  7    of car is it"? he asked gloomily.
A32 1780  1       "It is a British Austin, the smallest they make".
A32 1790  1       "Get much mileage"?
A32 1790  3       "About 35".
A32 1790  5       The gas station man sighed unhappily.
A32 1800  4       "What I always say is what if somebody clobbers
A32 1810  3    you in a little car like that? Crunch, that's all she
A32 1820  2    wrote".
A32 1820  3       "I will die rich".
A32 1820  7       "That will be $1.80", said the gas station man.
A32 1830  7    "The windshield looks pretty clean".

A32 1840  3    AH, THE FAIR-WEATHER friends of yesteryear! When I
A32 1850  3    wheeled about, finned fore and aft, I was the darling
A32 1850 13    of the doormen. Dollar bills skidded off my hands and
A32 1860  9    they tipped their caps politely.
A32 1870  2       With a small bomb, I tuck it between Cadillacs.
A32 1880  1    (The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself.
A32 1880 12    High blood pressure can get the best of any of us.)
A33 0010  1       AT LAST the White House is going to get some much-copied
A33 0020  1    furniture by that master American craftsman, Duncan
A33 0020  8    Phyfe, whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when
A33 0030  8    the U& S& Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad
A33 0040  7    for their furnishings.
A33 0040 10       The American Institute of Decorators has acquired
A33 0050  6    a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to
A33 0060  6    be placed in the Executive Mansion's library. The suite
A33 0070  3    has been in the same family since the early 1800's.
A33 0080  1    The gift is being presented by "heirs and descendants
A33 0080 10    of the Rutherford family of New Jersey, whose famous
A33 0090  7    estate, "Tranquility", was located near the Duncan
A33 0100  6    Phyfe workshop at Andover, N& J&.
A33 0110  1       Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are
A33 0110  8    uncommon, although millions of American homes today
A33 0120  7    display pieces patterned after the style trends he
A33 0130  6    set 150 years ago. This acquisition is a matched, perfect
A33 0140  3    set- consisting of two sofas six feet long, plus six
A33 0150  1    sidechairs and two armchairs.
A33 0150  5       THE ~AID HAS undertaken the redecoration of the
A33 0160  5    White House library as a project in connection with
A33 0170  3    the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's
A33 0180  1    Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for
A33 0180  9    the presidential home. It is the ~AID's intention to
A33 0190  8    create in the library "a miniature museum of Americana"
A33 0200  7    before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this
A33 0210  5    fall.
A33 0210  6       The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians
A33 0220  5    would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe
A33 0230  3    furniture. The ~AID has found a mantlepiece attributed
A33 0240  1    to Samuel McIntyre of Salem, Mass&, an architect and
A33 0240 10    woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol
A33 0250  9    here in 1792.
A33 0260  1       The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem
A33 0260 10    house and is being fitted over the White House library
A33 0270  9    fireplace. It will be painted to match the paneling
A33 0280  6    in the room.
A33 0280  9       The ~AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration,
A33 0290  7    Mrs& Henry Francis Lenygon, was in town yesterday to
A33 0300  7    consult with White House staff members on the project.
A33 0310  5    Mrs& Lenygon's committee associates, announced formally
A33 0320  3    yesterday by the ~AID in New York, include Mrs& Allen
A33 0330  2    Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J& Jussel, both wellknown
A33 0340  1    Manhattan decorators. Regional representatives appointed
A33 0340  6    to serve from each section of the country include Frank
A33 0350  9    E& Barnes of Boston.
A33 0370  1       PRESIDENT KENNEDY couldn't stay away from his desk
A33 0370  9    for the 75-minute young people's concert played on
A33 0380  9    the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania
A33 0390  7    Symphony Orchestra from Brevard, N& C&. But he left
A33 0400  6    the doors to his office open so he could hear the music.
A33 0410  5       At 4 p& m& the President left the White House to
A33 0420  3    welcome the young musicians, students from the ages
A33 0420 11    of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music
A33 0430 12    Center summer camp, and to greet the 325 crippled,
A33 0440  7    cardiac and blind children from the District area who
A33 0450  4    were special guests at the concert.
A33 0450 10       It was the first in the series of "Concerts for
A33 0460  9    Young People by Young People" to be sponsored by First
A33 0470  7    Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House. She was
A33 0480  5    not present yesterday, however, to enjoy the music
A33 0490  2    or watch the faces of the delighted audience.
A33 0490 10       She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in
A33 0510  7    Hyannis Port, Mass&, and in his welcoming remarks,
A33 0520  4    the President said he was representing her.
A33 0530  1       As he approached the open bandstand, erected facing
A33 0530  9    the South entrance to the Executive Mansion, the band
A33 0540  8    struck up the "Star Spangled Banner" and followed it
A33 0550  5    with "Hail to the Chief".
A33 0560  1       "I think they played Hail to the Chief better than
A33 0560 11    the Marine Corps Band, and we are grateful to them",
A33 0570  9    President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand
A33 0580  5    and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl.
A33 0590  4       AFTER PAYING tribute to the conductor and his white-clad
A33 0600  5    youthful students, President Kennedy said, "As an American
A33 0610  4    I have the greatest possible pride in the work that
A33 0620  1    is being done in dozens of schools stretching across
A33 0620 10    the United States- schools where devoted teachers are
A33 0630  8    studying with interested young men and women and opening
A33 0640  7    up the whole wide horizon of serious music".
A33 0650  1       He added "**h I think that sometimes in this country
A33 0660  1    we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary
A33 0660 12    work that is being done in this field".
A33 0670  7       Displaying his knowledge of music, the New England-born
A33 0680  6    President remarked that "probably the best chamber
A33 0690  3    music in the world is played in Vermont, by young Americans-
A33 0700  3    and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary
A33 0710  1    musicians and teachers, and their work is being duplicated
A33 0710 10    all across the United States.
A33 0720  4       "This is a great national cultural asset, and therefore
A33 0730  3    it is a great source of satisfaction to me, representing
A33 0740  1    as I do today my wife, to welcome all of you here today
A33 0740 14    at the White House".
A33 0750  3       As he left the bandstand to return to his office,
A33 0760  1    the slender, sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along
A33 0760  9    the way to shake hands with the members of the audience
A33 0770  9    in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field
A33 0780  7    tent set up for the guests.
A33 0780 13       He expressed surprise to learn that pretty, blonde
A33 0790  8    Patricia Holbrook, 16, of Mount Rainier, had attended
A33 0800  3    the Joseph P& Kennedy School for the Handicapped in
A33 0810  5    Boston. "The nuns there do a wonderful work", the President
A33 0820  3    commented. Patricia now attends the C& Melvin Sharpe
A33 0830  2    Health School in the District.
A33 0830  7       Each of the children invited to the concert wore
A33 0840  6    a name tag marked with a red, white and blue ribbon.
A33 0850  3    They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and
A33 0850 11    during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of
A33 0860  9    members of the White House staff.
A33 0870  3       MANY of the music-loving members of the President's
A33 0880  1    staff gathered around the tent listening and watching
A33 0880  9    the rapt attention given by the young seated audience.
A33 0890  9    And it turned out to be more of a family affair than
A33 0900  9    expected. Henry Hall Wilson, a student at the music
A33 0910  5    camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff
A33 0920  2    as liaison representative with the House of Representatives,
A33 0920 10    turned guest conductor for a Sousa march, the "Stars
A33 0930  9    and Stripes Forever".
A33 0950  1       Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday
A33 0950  7    that Mrs& Kennedy's Social Secretary, Letitia Baldrige,
A33 0960  6    told about plans for White House youth concerts before
A33 0970  8    the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia
A33 0980  5    last spring.
A33 0980  7       He said he contacted a friend, Henry Hall Wilson,
A33 0990  6    on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra
A33 1000  5    could play, in the series. A flow of correspondence
A33 1010  1    between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation
A33 1020  1    to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the
A33 1020 11    first concert.
A33 1040  1       ONE OF THE MOST interested "students" on the tour
A33 1040 10    which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery
A33 1050  9    yesterday following their concert at the White House,
A33 1060  7    was Letitia Baldrige, social secretary to First Lady
A33 1070  5    Jacqueline Kennedy.
A33 1070  7       "I was an art major in college", Miss Baldrige explained.
A33 1080  7    "I've been here so many times I couldn't count them".
A33 1090  8    She turned out to be a fan, too, of Margaret Bouton,
A33 1100  5    the Gallery's associate curator of education.
A33 1110  1       Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that
A33 1110 11    went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed
A33 1120  9    at 5 p& m&. The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the
A33 1140  9    Gallery at 6 p& m&, remaining for about 45 minutes.
A33 1150  5       The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the
A33 1160  5    beginning of the tour but warmed up later. They decided
A33 1170  1    that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him
A33 1170  9    look "sad"**h they noticed Roman buildings in the background
A33 1180  8    of Raphael's "Alba Madonna" and "texture" in a Monet
A33 1190  8    painting of Rheims Cathedral. Everybody had heard of
A33 1200  6    Van Gogh, the French impressionist.
A33 1210  1       Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group,
A33 1210  8    standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby
A33 1220 10    to speak to them. He pointed out to the young musicians
A33 1230  8    that the National Gallery "is the only museum in the
A33 1240  6    country to have a full-time music director **h Richard
A33 1250  3    Bales **h I'm sure you've heard af him **h and his
A33 1260  1    record, 'The Confederacy'".
A33 1260  4       Along with the gallery aide who explained the various
A33 1270  5    paintings and sculptures to each group, went one of
A33 1280  3    the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards.
A33 1280  8       In 45 minutes, the Gallery leaders had given the
A33 1290  7    students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance
A33 1300  4    to the late 19th Century.
A33 1300  9       A few of them said they "preferred contemporary
A33 1310  5    art".
A33 1310  6       Among the other artists, whose paintings were discussed
A33 1320  6    were Boucher, Courbet, Fra Angelico.
A33 1330  2       The thing that impressed one of the visitors the
A33 1330 11    most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain **h "because
A33 1340  8    it's on the second floor".
A33 1360  1       That imposing, somewhat austere, and seemingly remote
A33 1360  8    collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its
A33 1370  8    threshold at 1733 16th st& nw& took on bustling life
A33 1380  6    yesterday.
A33 1380  7       More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered
A33 1390  6    in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their
A33 1400  6    most prominent leader, Albert Pike, who headed the
A33 1410  2    Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891.
A33 1410  8       They came together in the huge, high-ceilinged Council
A33 1420  6    Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized. C& Wheeler
A33 1430  3    Barnes of Denver, head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado,
A33 1440  3    praised Pike as a historian, author, poet, journalist,
A33 1450  1    lawyer, jurist, soldier and musician, who devoted most
A33 1450  9    of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic
A33 1460  8    Order.
A33 1460  9       The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at
A33 1470  9    the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple. A reception
A33 1480  6    and tea followed.
A33 1480  9       About 1500 delegates are expected to register today
A33 1490  7    for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted
A33 1500  4    Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the
A33 1510  3    United States.
A33 1510  5       The opening session of the 5-day session will begin
A33 1520  3    at 10 a& m& today. There will be a pilgrimage to Mount
A33 1530  2    Vernon at 2:30 p& m&. A wreath will be placed at the
A33 1540  1    tomb of George Washington, one of this Nation's first
A33 1540 10    Masons- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge
A33 1550  8    22 in Alexandria.
A33 1560  1       THE MARRIAGE of John and Mary Black had clearly
A33 1560 10    reached the breaking point after eight years.
A33 1570  7       John had a job in a small firm where the work was
A33 1580  6    dull and monotonous. He would come home in the evening
A33 1590  3    tired and discouraged- in no frame of mind to play
A33 1590 13    with their three children, or spend much time chatting
A33 1600  9    with his wife.
A33 1610  1       Hurt by his lack of interest and attention, Mary
A33 1610 10    complained often that he didn't help around the house,
A33 1620  8    and that he didn't really care about the family. She
A33 1630  6    accused him of ignoring her. He in turn told her she
A33 1640  3    demanded too much. They were both discouraged, disgusted
A33 1650  1    and miserable.
A33 1650  3       Mary decided she had had enough. Without any definite
A33 1660  1    plan in mind, she went to a judge to see what could
A33 1660 13    be done. The judge listened quietly as the young woman
A33 1670  8    poured out her frustrations- then discussing with her
A33 1680  7    the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service
A33 1690  2    before going to a lawyer.
A33 1690  7       Family Service, sharing in ~UGF, has five agencies
A33 1700  6    in the Washington area. They offer to the people of
A33 1710  5    this community case work service and counseling on
A33 1720  1    a wide variety of family problems.
A33 1720  7       Because neither of them really wanted their marriage
A33 1730  4    to break up, Mr& and Mrs& Black agreed to a series
A33 1740  4    of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia,
A33 1750  1    the agency nearest them. For nearly a year, they have
A33 1750 11    been receiving counseling, separately and together,
A33 1760  5    in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms
A33 1770  4    which had given rise to the possibility of divorce.
A33 1780  1    The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation
A33 1780 12    of the problems confronting the other. They are now
A33 1790  9    working together toward solving their difficulties.
A33 1800  4       JOHN received a promotion in his firm. He gives
A33 1810  6    credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life.
A33 1820  2    Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home
A33 1820 12    in the evenings, and the children's bed-time is frequently
A33 1830  8    preceeded by a session of happy, family rough-housing.
A33 1840  6       To outsiders, the Blacks seem to be an ordinary,
A33 1850  5    happy family, and they are- but with a difference.
A33 1860  1    They know the value of being just that- an ordinary,
A33 1860 11    happy family.
A33 1870  1       Family Service has helped hundreds of families in
A33 1870  9    this area. Perhaps to some their work does not seem
A33 1880 10    particularly vital. But to the families it serves,
A33 1890  6    their help cannot be measured. Family Service could
A33 1900  2    not open its doors to a single family without the financial
A33 1910  1    support of the United Givers Fund.
A33 1920  1       Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive
A33 1920  8    failed to materialize yesterday, park rangers said,
A33 1930  6    and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of
A33 1940  6    the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze.
A34 0010  1    #FOR CRUCIAL ENCOUNTER#
A34 0010  4    One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy
A34 0020  2    at his first news conference last January was about
A34 0020 11    his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev.
A34 0030  8    Mr& Kennedy replied:
A34 0040  2       @ "I'm hopeful that from @ more traditional exchanges
A34 0050  2    we can perhaps find greater common ground".
A34 0050  9       The President knew that a confrontation with Mr&
A34 0060  8    Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable
A34 0070  5    and even desirable. But he was convinced that the realities
A34 0080  4    of power- military, economic and ideological- were
A34 0090  4    the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists
A34 0090 13    and that these could not be talked away at a heads
A34 0100 10    of government meeting. He wanted to buy time to strengthen
A34 0110  7    the U& S& and its allies and to define and begin to
A34 0120  6    implement his foreign policy.
A34 0120 10       Last Friday the White House announced:
A34 0130  5       President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier
A34 0150  4    Nikita S& Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4.
A34 0160  2       The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration
A34 0170  1    in East-West relations. The heightened tension, in
A34 0170  9    fact, had been a major factor in the President's change
A34 0180  8    of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet
A34 0190  7    leader. He was not going to Vienna to negotiate- the
A34 0200  4    simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow
A34 0210  1    last week stressed that no formal negotiations were
A34 0210  9    planned. But Mr& Kennedy had become convinced that
A34 0220  7    a personal confrontation with Mr& Khrushchev might
A34 0230  4    be the only way to prevent catastrophe.
A34 0240  1       That objective set the high stakes and drama of
A34 0240 10    the Vienna meeting. Despite efforts by Washington last
A34 0250  6    week to play down the significance of the meeting,
A34 0260  4    it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters
A34 0270  1    of the cold war. @
A34 0270  6    #ROAD TO VIENNA#
A34 0270  9    The U& S& and Soviet heads of Government have met three
A34 0280  8    times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced
A34 0290  5    a new word into international diplomacy with his call
A34 0300  4    for a fresh approach to the problem of peace "at the
A34 0310  1    summit of the nations".
A34 0310  5       The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big
A34 0320  4    Four summit meeting produced the "spirit of Geneva".
A34 0330  1    The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow
A34 0330 11    made inroads into the Middle East.
A34 0340  5       In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev
A34 0350  4    held an informal session in the U& S&. That meeting
A34 0360  3    produced the "spirit of Camp David"- a spirit, it later
A34 0370  2    turned out, that masked a basic misunderstanding about
A34 0370 10    progress toward a Berlin settlement.
A34 0380  5       On the third occasion- another Big Four summit session
A34 0390  5    at Paris a year ago- there was no problem of an illusory
A34 0400  4    "spirit". Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference
A34 0410  1    at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of
A34 0410 10    the U& S& for the ~U-2 incident. The episode tended
A34 0420  9    to confirm the U& S& belief that propaganda, the hope
A34 0430  7    of one-sided concessions, and the chance to split the
A34 0440  6    Allies, rather than genuine negotiation, were the Soviet
A34 0450  3    leader's real aims in summitry.
A34 0450  8    #PRE-INAUGURAL POSITION#
A34 0460  1    Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before
A34 0460  8    inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with
A34 0470  9    the new President, Mr& Kennedy was confronted with
A34 0480  5    a delicate problem. Shortly before his nomination he
A34 0490  3    had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations
A34 0500  1    with the Soviet leader in these words:
A34 0500  8       "As long as Mr& Khrushchev is convinced that the
A34 0510  8    balance of world power is shifting his way, no amount
A34 0520  6    of either smiles or toughness, neither Camp David talks
A34 0530  3    nor kitchen debates, can compel him to enter fruitful
A34 0535  1    negotiations".
A34 0540  1       The President had set for himself the task, which
A34 0550  1    he believed vital, of awakening the U& S& and its allies
A34 0550 12    to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that
A34 0560 10    balance. He did not want the effort weakened by any
A34 0570  8    illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary.
A34 0580  3    He wanted time, too, to review the United States' global
A34 0590  2    commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited
A34 0600  1    and new ones he was formulating. Above all, he did
A34 0600 11    not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier
A34 0610  9    Khrushchev's doorstep.
A34 0610 11    #ATTITUDE FLEXIBLE#
A34 0620  2    At the same time the President took pains not to rule
A34 0630  2    out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader. Ideally,
A34 0630 11    he knew, it should be preceded by concrete progress
A34 0640  8    at lower levels. But Mr& Kennedy saw value even in
A34 0650  6    an informal meeting, provided that undue hopes were
A34 0660  3    not raised in connection with it. It would give him
A34 0660 13    an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary
A34 0670 10    in the cold war, to try to probe Mr& Khrushchev's intentions
A34 0680  8    and to make clear his own views. Moreover, an eventual
A34 0690  7    meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to
A34 0700  5    satisfy world opinion that the U& S& was not inflexible
A34 0710  2    and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.
A34 0720  1       Both elements- the caution about a meeting, the
A34 0720  9    willingness eventually to hold one- were reflected
A34 0730  7    in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn
A34 0740  4    E& Thompson brought back to Russia late in February.
A34 0750  4    The letter, dated Feb& 22, was delivered to Premier
A34 0760  2    Khrushchev in Novosibirsk, Siberia, on March 9. It
A34 0760 10    dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues.
A34 0770 10    But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a
A34 0780  6    meeting with Mr& Khrushchev before the end of the year
A34 0790  6    if the international climate were favorable and schedules
A34 0800  2    permitted.
A34 0800  3       Developments over the next two months, however,
A34 0810  1    caused the President to reconsider the question of
A34 0810  9    the timing. There were intense discussions in the inner
A34 0820  8    councils of the White House about the advisability
A34 0830  4    of an early meeting, not because the international
A34 0840  1    climate was improving, but precisely because it was
A34 0840  9    deteriorating alarmingly.
A34 0850  2    #DEADLOCK ON TESTS#
A34 0850  5    The President was especially concerned about the deadlock
A34 0860  5    in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva. The
A34 0870  3    deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand
A34 0880  1    for a three-man (East, West and neutral) directorate,
A34 0880 10    and thus a veto, over the control machinery. In the
A34 0890  7    U& S&, strong pressures have been building up for a
A34 0900  7    resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may
A34 0910  2    be secretly testing.
A34 0910  5       Mr& Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility
A34 0920  4    than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown, or even
A34 0930  3    continued stalemate, would mean an unchecked spread
A34 0930 10    of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a
A34 0940  9    fatal blow to any hope for disarmament. There was reason
A34 0950  4    to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned
A34 0960  3    about a possible spread of nuclear weapons, particularly
A34 0970  1    to Communist China. The question arose as to whether
A34 0970 10    a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader
A34 0980  8    had not become urgent. Moreover, Moscow appeared determined
A34 0990  4    to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive
A34 1000  4    organs of all international bodies, including the U&
A34 1010  3    N& Secretariat and the International Control Commission
A34 1020  1    for Laos. Mr& Kennedy was convinced that insistence
A34 1020  9    on the demand would make international agreements,
A34 1030  5    or even negotiations, impossible.
A34 1040  1       Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the
A34 1040  9    advisability of an early summit meeting. Initially
A34 1050  7    the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges
A34 1060  6    with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had
A34 1070  4    dampened prospects for a meeting. At the same time,
A34 1080  1    there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest
A34 1080 10    the Soviet leader, as a result of those episodes, come
A34 1090  8    to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's
A34 1100  4    ability and determination to resist Communist pressure.
A34 1110  2       In Cuba, the U& S& had blundered badly and created
A34 1120  2    the impression of impotency against Communist penetration
A34 1120  9    even on its own doorstep. In Laos, the picture was
A34 1130 10    almost equally bad. U& S& willingness to accept a neutral
A34 1140  8    Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that
A34 1150  5    other areas could be "neutralized" on Soviet terms.
A34 1160  4    Beyond that, Allied disagreement about military intervention
A34 1170  1    in Laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed
A34 1180  1    Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military
A34 1180 11    and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the
A34 1190  6    pro-Communist forces. As a result, the West is in a
A34 1200  6    poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations
A34 1210  2    on Laos, and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast
A34 1220  1    Asia are under increased pressure.
A34 1220  6       In the light of those events, there appeared to
A34 1230  5    be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach
A34 1240  3    himself. Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that
A34 1250  2    the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive.
A34 1250 10    He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin
A34 1260  8    before the year is out. The President and his advisers
A34 1270  5    felt that the time might have come to warn Premier
A34 1280  2    Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas
A34 1280  9    such as Berlin, Iran or Latin America from which there
A34 1290 10    would be no turning back.
A34 1300  2       It was in the midst of such White House deliberations
A34 1310  1    that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries
A34 1310 10    through the U& S& Embassy in Moscow about a meeting
A34 1320  9    with the President in the near future. Mr& Kennedy
A34 1330  6    told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after
A34 1340  5    consultation with the Allies. The response from London,
A34 1350  2    Paris and Bonn was favorable. Firm arrangements for
A34 1350 10    the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange
A34 1360 10    between Moscow and Washington last week. Apparently
A34 1370  5    at the insistence of the U& S&, the simultaneous announcements
A34 1380  4    issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized
A34 1390  4    the "informal" nature of the meeting. The Washington
A34 1400  2    announcement said:
A34 1400  4       @ "The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand
A34 1410  3    that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating
A34 1420  3    or reaching agreement on the major international problems
A34 1430  1    that involve the interest of many other countries.
A34 1430  9    The meeting will, however, afford a timely and convenient
A34 1440  8    opportunity for the first personal contact between
A34 1450  4    them and a general exchange of views on the major issues
A34 1460  3    which affect the relationships between the two countries".
A34 1470  1    @
A34 1470  2    #THE OUTLOOK#
A34 1470  4    The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned,
A34 1480  1    67-year-old veteran of the cold war who, in Mr& Kennedy's
A34 1490  1    own words, is "shrewd, tough, vigorous, well-informed
A34 1490  9    and confident", and a 44-year-old President (his birthday
A34 1500  9    is May 29) with a demonstrated capacity for political
A34 1510  5    battle but little experience in international diplomacy.
A34 1520  2    The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter
A34 1530  2    produced strong reactions in the U& S& of both approval
A34 1540  1    and disapproval.
A34 1540  3       The approval did not arise from an expectation of
A34 1550  2    far-reaching agreements at Vienna. The inclination
A34 1550  9    was to accept the statement that there would be no
A34 1560  8    formal negotiations. But those who were in favor of
A34 1570  6    the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the
A34 1580  2    two men and an opportunity to size one another up would
A34 1580 13    prove salutary. Mr& Khrushchev is known to rely heavily
A34 1590  8    on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a
A34 1600  7    shrewd judge of men. The feeling was that he would
A34 1610  4    sense an inner core of toughness and determination
A34 1610 12    in the President and that plain talk by Mr& Kennedy
A34 1620  9    would give him pause.
A34 1630  1       Apart from the personal equation, another reason
A34 1630  8    advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often
A34 1640 10    in the past the U&S& appeared to have been dragged
A34 1650  6    reluctantly to the summit. Premier Khrushchev has made
A34 1660  3    propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end
A34 1660 13    got his summit meeting anyway. This time the initiative
A34 1670  9    came, in part at least, from Washington.
A34 1680  5    #OTHER ALLIES CONSULTED#
A34 1680  8    There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr&
A34 1690 10    Khrushchev, the President will have completed conversations
A34 1700  5    with all the other principal Allied leaders. Thus he
A34 1710  4    will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader
A34 1720  1    of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.
A34 1730  1       Finally, there was a wide area of agreement on the
A34 1730 10    value of the President's making a final effort in the
A34 1740  7    summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord. There is
A34 1750  4    no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings
A34 1760  1    throughout the world. If tests are to be resumed, the
A34 1760 11    argument went, it is vital that the U& S& make plain
A34 1770 10    that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union.
A34 1780  4       Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on
A34 1790  2    the belief that the timing could hardly be worse. After
A34 1790 12    Cuba and Laos, it was argued, Mr& Khrushchev will interpret
A34 1800 10    the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence
A34 1810  8    of Western weakness- perhaps even panic- and is certain
A34 1820  9    to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he
A34 1830  5    holds. Moreover, the President is meeting the Soviet
A34 1840  2    leader at a time when the Administration has still
A34 1840 11    not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign
A34 1850  8    policy commitments. The question was raised, for example,
A34 1860  6    as to what attitude the President would take if Mr&
A34 1870  5    Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending
A34 1880  1    from Southeast Asia to the Middle East.
A35 0010  1       THERE ARE, so my biologist friends tell me, mechanisms
A35 0010 10    of adaptation and defense that are just too complete
A35 0020  9    and too satisfactory. Mollusks are a case in point.
A35 0030  7    The shell, which served the strain so well at a relatively
A35 0040  6    early stage in the evolutionary scheme, tended to cancel
A35 0050  3    out the possibility of future development. Though this
A35 0050 11    may or may not be good biology, it does aptly illustrate
A35 0060 11    the strength and the weakness of American Catholic
A35 0070  6    higher education.
A35 0070  8       There can be no doubt that the American Catholic
A35 0080  8    accomplishment in the field of higher education is
A35 0090  5    most impressive: our European brethren never cease
A35 0100  2    to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges
A35 0100 13    and universities. The deeper wonder is how this miracle
A35 0110  8    was accomplished in decades, rather than in centuries
A35 0120  5    and by immigrant minorities at that. By way of explanation
A35 0130  5    we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement
A35 0140  1    stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity
A35 0140 10    which brought the parochial school system into existence.
A35 0150  8       There is, however, one curious discrepancy in this
A35 0160  8    broad and flattering picture. Viewing the American
A35 0170  4    Catholic educational achievement in retrospect, we
A35 0180  2    may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from
A35 0180 12    grade school to university. But the simple truth is
A35 0190  8    that higher education has never really been an official
A35 0200  6    American Catholic project; certainly not in the same
A35 0210  5    sense that the establishment of a parochial school
A35 0220  1    system has been a matter of official policy.
A35 0220  9       Official encouragement is one thing, but the down-to-earth
A35 0230  9    test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds.
A35 0240  4    American Catholics have responded generously to bishops'
A35 0250  3    and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create
A35 0260  2    parochial schools but they have not contributed in
A35 0260 10    a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions
A35 0270  7    of higher learning. They have not done so for the simple
A35 0280  8    reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made.
A35 0290  4    Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this
A35 0300  1    as their direct responsibility.
A35 0300  5       All of this may be understandable enough: it is,
A35 0310  4    however, in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities
A35 0320  2    could have acted otherwise. Yet for better or for worse,
A35 0330  1    the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic
A35 0330 11    colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic
A35 0340  8    support but rather to the initiative, resourcefulness
A35 0350  4    and sacrifices of individual religious communities.
A35 0360  2    Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell
A35 0370  2    which has made the achievement possible.
A35 0370  8       To understand the past history- and the future potential-
A35 0380  8    of American Catholic higher education, it is necessary
A35 0390  6    to appreciate the special character of the esprit d'
A35 0400  5    corps of the religious community. It is something more
A35 0410  2    than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety
A35 0410 11    and detachment. A religious community with a vital
A35 0420  8    sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation
A35 0430  6    and group identification seldom found elsewhere. The
A35 0440  3    fact that the group orientation and group identification
A35 0450  1    are founded on supernatural principles and nourished
A35 0450  8    by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a
A35 0460  7    deeper and more satisfying dimension. The net result
A35 0470  4    is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship, the
A35 0480  2    kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts
A35 0480 10    the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship.
A35 0490  6       American Catholic colleges and universities are,
A35 0500  4    in a very real sense, the product of "private enterprise"-
A35 0510  1    the "private enterprise" of religious communities.
A35 0520  1    Had it not been for such private enterprise, diocesan
A35 0520 10    authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing
A35 0530  9    institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish
A35 0540  6    collections and staffed by religious as paid employees.
A35 0550  4    There is however no point in speculating about such
A35 0560  1    a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions
A35 0560 12    of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit
A35 0570  9    not unlike that which produces the "family business".
A35 0580  5    This "family-community" spirit is the real explanation
A35 0590  5    of the marvel of our achievement.
A35 0590 11    ##
A35 0600  1    IT IS this spirit which explains some of the anomalies
A35 0600 11    of American Catholic higher education, in particular
A35 0610  6    the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas. I
A35 0620  6    think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully
A35 0630  3    small enrollments, clustered within a few miles of
A35 0640  1    a major Catholic university, which is also co-educational.
A35 0640 10    This is not an isolated example; this aspect of the
A35 0650  8    total picture has been commented upon often enough.
A35 0660  4    It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot.
A35 0670  3       Apart, however, from the question of wasteful duplication,
A35 0680  1    there is another aspect of the "family business" spirit
A35 0690  1    in American Catholic higher education which deserves
A35 0690  8    closer scrutiny. For while the past needs of the Church
A35 0700  9    in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate
A35 0710  6    institutions, which in temper and tone closely resembled
A35 0720  3    junior colleges and finishing schools, it would seem
A35 0730  2    that today's need is for the college which more closely
A35 0730 12    resembles the university in its "pursuit of excellence".
A35 0740  8    At the earlier "pre-academic excellence" stage of Catholic
A35 0750  7    education, the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural
A35 0760  8    community basis. But with today's demand for professional
A35 0770  4    qualifications and specialized training, the need for
A35 0780  4    "outsiders" become more pressing.
A35 0780  8    ##
A35 0780  9    THE PROBLEM is not merely that more "outside teachers"
A35 0790  8    are needed but that a different brand is called for.
A35 0800  8    Commenting on the earlier stage, the Notre Dame Chapter
A35 0810  5    of the American Association of University Professors
A35 0830  1    (in a recent report on the question of faculty participation
A35 0840  1    in administrative decision-making) noted that the term
A35 0840  9    "teacher-employee" (as opposed to, e&g&, "maintenance
A35 0850  6    employee") was a not inapt description. Today however,
A35 0860  7    the "outsider" is likely to have professional qualifications
A35 0870  5    of the highest order (otherwise the college would not
A35 0880  5    be interested in hiring him) and to be acclimatized
A35 0890  1    to the democratic processes of the secular or state
A35 0890 10    university. And while no one expects total democracy
A35 0900  7    on the academic scene, the scholar will be particularly
A35 0910  4    sensitive to a line between first and second class
A35 0920  2    citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic
A35 0920 12    rank or professional achievement.
A35 0930  4       In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame
A35 0940  4    Chapter of the American Association of University Professors,
A35 0950  2    the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges
A35 0960  1    very clearly in the very statement of the problem as
A35 0960 11    the members see it: "Even with the best of intentions
A35 0970  8    he (the President of the university) is loath to delegate
A35 0980  6    such authority and responsibility to a group the membership
A35 0990  5    of which, considered (as it must be by him) in individual
A35 1000  2    terms, is inhomogeneous, mortal and of extremely varying
A35 1010  1    temperament, interests and capabilities. It is natural
A35 1010  8    that he should turn for his major support to a select
A35 1020  9    and dedicated few from the organization which actually
A35 1030  3    owns the university and whose goals are, in their opinion,
A35 1040  3    identified with its highest good and (to use that oft-repeated
A35 1050  1    phrase) 'the attainment of excellence'".
A35 1050  6       The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar
A35 1060  7    to Notre Dame: it is simply that the paradox involved
A35 1070  5    in this kind of control of the institution by "the
A35 1080  3    organization which actually owns" it, becomes more
A35 1080 10    obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished
A35 1090  9    "outside" faculty. It is particularly interesting that
A35 1100  6    those who framed the report should refer to "the organization
A35 1110  6    which actually owns the university": this seems to
A35 1130  4    show an awareness of the fact that there is more to
A35 1140  2    the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay
A35 1140 11    tension. But in any case, one does not have to read
A35 1150 10    very closely between the lines to realize that the
A35 1160  5    situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one.
A35 1170  2    "Outside" faculty members want to be considered partners
A35 1170 10    in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees
A35 1180  9    of a family business.
A35 1190  1       There are two reasons why failure to come to grips
A35 1190 11    with this demand could be fatal to the future of the
A35 1200 11    Catholic university. In the first place there is the
A35 1210  8    obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel.
A35 1220  2    Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession,
A35 1230  1    much given to attending meetings and conferences. Expressions
A35 1240  1    of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college
A35 1240 10    faculty member has the effect of confirming the already
A35 1250  8    existing stereotype. In the academic world there is
A35 1260  6    seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott:
A35 1270  3    all that happens is that the better qualified teacher
A35 1270 12    declines to gamble two or three years of his life on
A35 1280 11    the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution
A35 1290  5    will be as good as those elsewhere.
A35 1300  1       To appreciate the nature of the gamble, it should
A35 1300 10    be realized that while college teaching is almost a
A35 1310  8    public symbol of security, that security does not come
A35 1320  6    as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary
A35 1330  4    school system or in the Civil Service. Much has been
A35 1340  2    made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now
A35 1340 11    guarantee firm tenure. This is a significant advance
A35 1350  8    but its import should not be exaggerated. When a man
A35 1360  6    invests a block of his years at a university without
A35 1370  2    gaining the coveted promotion, not only is he faced
A35 1370 11    with the problem of starting over but there is also
A35 1380  9    a certain depreciation in the market value of his services.
A35 1390  7    A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects
A35 1400  5    that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions
A35 1410  2    is being reserved for members of the "family".
A35 1410 10    ##
A35 1410 11    JUST AS IT is possible to exaggerate the drawing power
A35 1420 10    of the new tenure practices, it is also possible to
A35 1430  8    exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate
A35 1440  6    salaries paid by major Catholic institutions. Adequate
A35 1450  2    compensation is indispensable. Yet adequate compensation-
A35 1460  3    and particularly merely adequate compensation is no
A35 1460 10    substitute for those intangibles which cause a man
A35 1470  8    to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking
A35 1480  5    up college teaching in the first place. Broadly speaking
A35 1490  2    the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible
A35 1500  1    but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation
A35 1500 12    and mature responsibility in the total work of the
A35 1510  8    university. Religious who derive their own sense of
A35 1520  6    purpose through identification with the religious community
A35 1530  2    rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate
A35 1540  1    both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need
A35 1540 10    for this identification.
A35 1550  2       There is no need here to spell out the conditions
A35 1560  1    of creative teaching except to point out that, at the
A35 1560 11    college level, the sense of community and of community
A35 1570  9    responsibility is even more necessary than it is at
A35 1580  7    other levels. The college teacher needs the stimulus
A35 1590  3    of communication with other faculty members but he
A35 1590 11    also needs to feel that such communication, even informal
A35 1600  9    debates over the luncheon table, are a contribution
A35 1610  6    to the total good of the institution. But this in turn
A35 1620  5    means that decisions are not merely imposed from the
A35 1630  2    top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty
A35 1630 12    participation.
A35 1640  1       The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy
A35 1650  1    between faculty members who are part of the "in-group"
A35 1650 11    that owns and operates the institution and those who
A35 1660  7    are merely paid employees, is, therefore, the baneful
A35 1670  4    effect on the caliber of the teaching itself. This
A35 1680  2    is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions
A35 1680 10    of salary and tenure. Yet though it may seem difficult
A35 1690  9    to envision any definitive resolution of the problem
A35 1700  5    of ownership and control, there are nevertheless certain
A35 1710  2    suggestions which seem to be in order.
A35 1710  9       The first is a negative warning: there is no point
A35 1720  9    in the creation of faculty committees and advisory
A35 1730  4    boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority.
A35 1740  2    In the case of academic personnel the "feeling" of
A35 1750  1    participation can hardly be "faked". Competent teachers
A35 1750  8    are well versed in the technique of leading students
A35 1760  8    to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students'
A35 1770  4    illusion that they are making their own decisions.
A35 1780  2    Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar
A35 1790  1    with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student
A35 1790  9    government to be taken in by "busy-work" and ersatz
A35 1800  9    decision making.
A35 1810  1       In any case it is by no means clear that formally
A35 1810 12    structured organs of participation are what is called
A35 1820  6    for at all. In the Notre Dame report, reference was
A35 1830  3    made to the fact that faculty members were reduced
A35 1840  1    to "luncheon-table communication". In itself there
A35 1840  8    is nothing wrong with this form of "participation":
A35 1850  6    the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that
A35 1860  5    those faculty members who are in a position to implement
A35 1870  3    policy, i&e&, members of the religious community which
A35 1880  1    owns and administers the institution, have their own
A35 1880  9    eating arrangements.
A36 0010  1    SEN& JOHN L& McCLELLAN of Arkansas and Rep& David Martin
A36 0020  2    of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the
A36 0020 12    unions under the anti-monopoly laws. Once more the
A36 0030  9    fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since
A36 0040  5    business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws,
A36 0050  2    there must be a corresponding restriction against labor
A36 0050 10    unions: the law must treat everybody equally. Or, in
A36 0060  9    the words of Anatole France, "The law in its majestic
A36 0070  7    equality must forbid the rich, as well as the poor,
A36 0080  6    from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges".
A36 0090  2       The public atmosphere that has been generated which
A36 0100  1    makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from
A36 0100 10    the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen
A36 0110  8    as a result of Mr& McClellan's hearings into corruption
A36 0120  4    in labor-management relations and, later, into the
A36 0130  3    jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations
A36 0140  1    at the missile sites. The Senator was shocked by stoppages
A36 0140 11    over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile
A36 0150  8    program. In addition, disclosures that missile workers
A36 0160  5    were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for
A36 0170  6    equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation
A36 0180  1    on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing
A36 0180 10    the bill.
A36 0190  1       It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays
A36 0190 11    for high wages, but he pays the employers' strike expenses
A36 0200  7    when the latter undertakes to fight a strike. Business
A36 0210  6    Week (Aug& 9, 1961) reports that the United Aircraft
A36 0220  4    Company, against which the International Association
A36 0230  1    of Machinists had undertaken a strike, decided to keep
A36 0230 10    its plants operating. The company incurred some $10
A36 0240  7    million of expenses attributable to four factors: advertising
A36 0250  5    to attract new employees, hiring and training them,
A36 0260  4    extra overtime, and defective work performed by the
A36 0270  2    new workers. The company has billed the United States
A36 0270 11    Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the
A36 0280  8    Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type
A36 0290  6    generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for
A36 0300  3    the conduct of the contractor's business.
A36 0300  9       Rep& Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this
A36 0310  8    problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee.
A36 0320  7    The committee remains unresponsive. Neither has Congressman
A36 0330  4    Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the
A36 0340  6    matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses
A36 0350  2    by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions.
A36 0350 11    ##
A36 0350 12    THE RECENT publicity attending the successful federal
A36 0360  7    prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number
A36 0370  8    of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect
A36 0380  6    for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by
A36 0390  3    their rationale nor by the results they have obtained.
A36 0390 12    The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must
A36 0400 10    compete, but along completely undefined lines; it must
A36 0410  5    play a game in which there never is a winner. The fact
A36 0420  5    is that any business that wants to operate successfully
A36 0430  1    cannot follow the law. Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer
A36 0430 10    to a foolish public policy.
A36 0440  4       Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry
A36 0450  2    in which General Electric, Westinghouse and a number
A36 0450 10    of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging
A36 0460  8    in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market.
A36 0470  8    The industry is so structured that price-setting by
A36 0480  5    a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead
A36 0490  2    charges are allocated- whether marginal or average
A36 0490  9    pricing is applied.
A36 0500  3       The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise
A36 0510  1    is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of
A36 0510 11    other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment.
A36 0520  8    Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale
A36 0530  8    for almost any price. Naturally, enterprises of the
A36 0540  4    size of General Electric are in a position to structure
A36 0550  2    their prices in such a way that the relatively small
A36 0550 12    competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short
A36 0560 11    time. Should these giants really flex their competitive
A36 0570  5    muscles, they would become the only survivors in the
A36 0580  4    industry. Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating
A36 0590  1    a monopoly by "unfair competition". But if they show
A36 0590 10    self-restraint, they don't get the orders.
A36 0600  6       Under the circumstances, the only protection for
A36 0610  5    the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in
A36 0620  2    exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for
A36 0620 11    which the latter were convicted. Engaging in such a
A36 0630  7    conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants. The paradox
A36 0640  6    implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand
A36 0650  3    of the government, after the conviction, that General
A36 0650 11    Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would
A36 0660 10    not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with
A36 0670  8    its fellows. In other words, the anti-trust laws, designed
A36 0680  6    to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday, Wednesday
A36 0690  2    and Friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer
A36 0700  1    on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. And which theory
A36 0700  9    would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday?
A36 0710  9    ##
A36 0710 10    THE QUESTION might be asked: "Don't the managements
A36 0720  7    of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these
A36 0730  4    facts? Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas,
A36 0740  5    throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be
A36 0750  3    good boys thereafter, expressing their complete confidence
A36 0750 10    in the laws"?
A36 0760  3       The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management
A36 0770  2    was explained by Thurman Arnold, in The Folklore of
A36 0770 11    Capitalism, back in 1937. He wrote: "(P& 211) **h the
A36 0780 10    anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which
A36 0790  9    unconsciously felt the need of great organizations,
A36 0800  4    and at the same time had to deny them a place in the
A36 0810  3    moral and logical ideology of the social structure.
A36 0810 11    (P& 214) **h anti-trust laws became the greatest protection
A36 0820  9    to uncontrolled business dictatorship. (P& 215) **h
A36 0830  6    when corporate abuses were attacked, it was done on
A36 0840  5    the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked
A36 0850  1    rather than control. **h In this manner, every scheme
A36 0850 10    for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective
A36 0860  9    rock of the anti-trust laws. (Pp& 228-229) **h in any
A36 0870  8    event, it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not
A36 0880  4    prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial
A36 0890  1    empires the world has ever known, held together by
A36 0890 10    some of the most fantastic ideas, all based on the
A36 0900  7    fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual
A36 0910  4    who can trade and exchange goods without control by
A36 0920  2    the government".
A36 0920  4       This escape from control has led to management's
A36 0930  1    evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution
A36 0930  8    as worth while. A plea of nolo contendere, followed
A36 0940  9    by a nominal fine, after all is a small price to pay
A36 0950  9    for this untrammeled license. (The penalties handed
A36 0960  3    out in the electrical case, which included jail sentences,
A36 0970  2    were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions, perhaps
A36 0970  9    because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness
A36 0980  7    in their pricing activities.)
A36 0990  2       If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control
A36 1000  1    of a fictitious impersonal market, quite obviously
A36 1000  8    some method must be devised for representing the public
A36 1010  7    interest. A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly
A36 1020  5    such a vehicle. However, one can argue that no such
A36 1030  3    control is necessary as long as one pretends that the
A36 1030 13    anti-trust laws are effective and rational. Quite clearly
A36 1040  8    the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational-
A36 1050  6    and yet the argument goes that they should be extended
A36 1060  5    to the labor union.
A36 1060  9       THOSE WHO favor placing trade unions under anti-trust
A36 1070  8    laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform.
A36 1080  5       Before 1933, individuals who opposed trade unions
A36 1090  3    and collective bargaining said so in plain English.
A36 1100  1    The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national
A36 1100  9    policy in 1934, implicit in the writing of Section
A36 1110  7    7~A of the National Industrial Recovery Act, has made
A36 1120  5    it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle.
A36 1130  3    The Wagner Act, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin
A36 1140  1    Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.
A36 1150  1       The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining
A36 1150  9    system is the removal of wages from competition. If
A36 1160  9    a union cannot perform this function, then collective
A36 1170  5    bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic
A36 1180  4    fraud.
A36 1180  5       The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their
A36 1190  5    ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply
A36 1200  1    and price of labor is one of the things that create
A36 1200 12    a legal profession. The problem must be faced squarely.
A36 1210  7    If laborers are merely commodities competing against
A36 1220  3    each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat
A36 1230  3    and corn (unsupported, by the way, by any agricultural
A36 1230 12    subsidy), then they may be pardoned for reacting with
A36 1240  9    complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status
A36 1250  8    upon them.
A36 1250 10       Human labor was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth-
A36 1260  9    and nineteenth-century America. As early as 1776, Adam
A36 1270  7    Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations: "We have no acts
A36 1280  6    of Parliament against combining to lower the price
A36 1290  5    of work; but many against combining to raise it".
A36 1300  1    Eighteenth-century
A36 1300  3    England, upon whose customs our common law was built,
A36 1310  2    had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies.
A36 1310  9    In 1825, the Boston house carpenters' strike for a
A36 1320  8    ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers,
A36 1330  5    who declared: "It is **h considered that all combinations
A36 1340  4    by any classes of citizens intended to **h effect the
A36 1350  2    value of labor **h tend to convert all its branches
A36 1350 12    into monopolies".
A36 1360  1       There were no pious hypocrisies then about being
A36 1360  9    for collective bargaining, but against labor monopoly.
A36 1370  7    The courts shared the opinion of the employers. In
A36 1380  8    People vs& Fisher, Justice Savage of the New York Supreme
A36 1390  7    Court declared:
A36 1400  1       "Without any officious and improper interference
A36 1400  6    on the subject, the price of labor or the wages of
A36 1410  8    mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured
A36 1420  4    article and the value of that which is paid for it;
A36 1430  3    but the right does not exist to raise **h the wages
A36 1430 14    of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means".
A36 1440  7       Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge
A36 1450  6    with how Congressman Martin, according to the Daily
A36 1460  4    Labor Report of Sept& 19, 1961, defends the necessity
A36 1470  3    of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of
A36 1470 12    labor "if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of
A36 1480  9    wages, production or prices and if we wish to preserve
A36 1490  8    the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract
A36 1500  4    on wages, hours and conditions of employment".
A36 1510  1       Senator McClellan is proposing the application of
A36 1510  8    anti-trust measures to unions in transportation. His
A36 1520  7    bill, allegedly aimed at Hoffa, would amend the Sherman,
A36 1530  6    Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the
A36 1540  4    issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation
A36 1550  1    strike and would make it illegal for any union to act
A36 1550 12    in concert with any other union- even a sister local
A36 1560  9    in the same international.
A36 1570  1       Paradoxically, the same week in which Senator McClellan
A36 1570  9    was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor
A36 1580 10    in transportation, the Civil Aeronautics Board was
A36 1590  6    assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to
A36 1600  5    eliminate many costly features of air travel, the action
A36 1610  1    would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act.
A36 1610 12    Indeed, it is in the field of transportation that Congress
A36 1620  9    has most frequently granted employers exemption from
A36 1630  5    the anti-trust laws; for example, the organization
A36 1640  3    of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the
A36 1650  1    encouragement of railroads to seek mergers. At the
A36 1650  9    very moment that every attempt is being made to take
A36 1660  8    management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust
A36 1670  4    legislation, a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining
A36 1680  2    under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws
A36 1680 11    to unions who want no more than to continue to set
A36 1690 10    wages in the same way that ship operators set freight
A36 1700  5    rates.
A36 1700  6    ##
A36 1700  7    THE passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies.
A36 1710  8    It was most effective against trade unions. In the
A36 1720  5    famous Danbury Hatters case, a suit was brought against
A36 1730  3    the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices,
A36 1740  1    e&g&, trying to persuade consumers not to purchase
A36 1740  9    the product of the struck manufacturer. The suit against
A36 1750  8    the union was successful and many workers lost their
A36 1760  6    homes to pay off the judgment.
A36 1770  1       In 1914, the Clayton Act attempted to take labor
A36 1770 10    out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating
A36 1780  7    that human labor was not to be considered a commodity.
A36 1790  4    The law could not suspend economics. Labor remained
A36 1800  1    a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted
A36 1800  9    immunization from the anti-trust laws.
A36 1810  6       The courts, by interpretation, emasculated the act.
A36 1820  4    In 1922, the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado
A36 1830  2    Coal Company. The company sued under the anti-trust
A36 1830 11    laws, alleging that the union's activity interfered
A36 1840  7    with the movement of interstate commerce. (What other
A36 1850  5    purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt
A36 1860  4    the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise?) The
A36 1870  1    court first ruled that the strike constituted only
A36 1870  9    an indirect interference with commerce.
A37 0010  1    #THE NATION#
A37 0010  3    _THE THREE-FRONT WAR_
A37 0010  7       At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week,
A37 0020  6    Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final
A37 0030  3    report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
A37 0040  1    U&S& affairs abroad. Afterward, Tennessee's Democratic
A37 0040  7    Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen. What
A37 0050  9    Herter presented, said Gore, was "not a very encouraging
A37 0060  8    review". That was something of an understatement in
A37 0070  5    a week when the underlying conflict between the West
A37 0080  3    and Communism erupted on three fronts. While Communists
A37 0090  1    were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the
A37 0090  9    Congo from chaos, two other Communist offensives stirred
A37 0100  6    the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences
A37 0110  4    and serious decisions.
A37 0120  1    _1) CUBA._
A37 0120  1       Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and
A37 0120 11    artillery, Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted
A37 0130  5    the U&S& with a blunt and drastic demand: within 48
A37 0140  5    hours, the U&S& had to reduce its embassy and consulate
A37 0150  4    staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons (the embassy
A37 0160  2    staff alone totaled 87 U&S& citizens, plus 120 Cuban
A37 0170  1    employees). President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a&m&
A37 0170  8    meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers,
A37 0180  7    decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately.
A37 0190  3    "There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect
A37 0200  5    can endure", said the President. "That limit has now
A37 0210  3    been reached".
A37 0210  5       Through Secretary Herter, Ike offered President-elect
A37 0220  4    Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration
A37 0230  2    with the breakoff decision. Kennedy, through Secretary-designate
A37 0240  1    of State Dean Rusk, declined. He thus kept his hands
A37 0250  1    free for any action after Jan& 20, although reaction
A37 0250 10    to the break was generally favorable in the U&S& and
A37 0260  8    Latin America (see THE HEMISPHERE).
A37 0270  3    _2) LAOS._
A37 0270  5       After a White House huddle between the President
A37 0280  4    and top lieutenants, the Defense Department reacted
A37 0290  1    sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of
A37 0290 11    Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had
A37 0300  7    invaded Laos from North Viet Nam. "In view of the present
A37 0310  8    situation in Laos", said the Pentagon's announcement,
A37 0320  3    "we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase
A37 0330  3    the readiness of our forces in the Pacific". Cutting
A37 0340  1    short a holiday at Hong Kong, the aircraft carriers
A37 0340 10    Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South
A37 0350  8    China Sea, accompanied by a swarm of destroyers, plus
A37 0360  7    troopships loaded with marines. On the U&S&'s island
A37 0370  5    base of Okinawa, Task Force 116, made up of Army, Navy,
A37 0380  5    Marine and Air Force units, got braced to move southward
A37 0390  2    on signal.
A37 0390  4       But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was
A37 0400  3    read as an exaggeration (see FOREIGN NEWS), and the
A37 0410  2    U&S& was agreeing with its cautious British and French
A37 0410 11    allies that a neutralist- rather than a pro-Western-
A37 0420  9    government might be best for Laos.
A37 0430  5    _FRENCH + INDIANS._
A37 0430  8       There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation
A37 0440  6    that said much about all other cold-war fronts. Political,
A37 0450  3    economic and military experts were all agreed that
A37 0460  1    chaotic, mountainous little Laos was the last place
A37 0460  9    in the world to fight a war- and they were probably
A37 0470  9    right. "It would be like fighting the French and Indian
A37 0480  5    War all over again", said one military man. But why
A37 0490  4    was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground?
A37 0500  1       At Geneva in 1954, to get the war in Indo-China
A37 0500 12    settled, the British and French gave in to Russian
A37 0510  8    and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting
A37 0520  6    up of a Communist state, North Viet Nam- which then,
A37 0530  3    predictably, became a base for Communist operations
A37 0540  1    against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos. The late
A37 0540 10    Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the
A37 0550  8    1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement, saw
A37 0560  6    that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming
A37 0570  5    a calamity for the West. He began the diplomatic discussions
A37 0580  2    that resulted in the establishment of ~SEATO. "The
A37 0590  2    important thing from now on", he said, "is not to mourn
A37 0590 13    the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent
A37 0600 10    the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension
A37 0610  8    of Communism throughout Southeast Asia".
A37 0620  3       Russian tanks and artillery parading through the
A37 0630  2    streets of Havana, Russian intrigue in the Congo, and
A37 0630 11    Russian arms drops in Laos (using the same Ilyushin
A37 0640  9    transports that were used to carry Communist agents
A37 0650  6    to the Congo) made it plain once more that the cold
A37 0660  4    war was all of a piece in space and time. Soviet Premier
A37 0670  1    Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect
A37 0680  1    Kennedy, and got a cool acknowledgment in reply. Considering
A37 0680 10    the state of the whole world, the cold war's three
A37 0690 10    exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous; but,
A37 0700  6    in Senator Gore's words, it was "not a very encouraging"
A37 0710  5    situation that would confront John F& Kennedy on Inauguration
A37 0720  4    Day.
A37 0720  5    #THE CONGRESS#
A37 0730  1    _TURMOIL IN THE HOUSE_
A37 0730  2       As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week,
A37 0730 11    liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to
A37 0740  9    open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules
A37 0750  5    Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation
A37 0760  2    to the floor. The liberal pressure bloc (which coyly
A37 0770  1    masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group)
A37 0770  8    had fought the committee before, and had always lost.
A37 0780  7    This time, they were much better prepared and organized,
A37 0790  4    and the political climate was favorable. They had the
A37 0800  4    unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy, whose
A37 0800 11    own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee
A37 0810  9    bottleneck. And counting noses, they seemed to have
A37 0820  8    the votes to work their will.
A37 0830  1    _DEADLY DEADLOCK._
A37 0830  3       There were two possible methods of breaching the
A37 0840  2    conservative barriers around the Rules Committee: 1)
A37 0840  9    to pack it with additional liberals and break the
A37 0850  8    conservative-liberal
A37 0850 10    deadlock, or 2) to remove one of the conservatives-
A37 0860  9    namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer
A37 0870  6    (pronounced Calmer). Caucusing, the liberals decided
A37 0880  3    to go after Colmer, which actually was the more drastic
A37 0890  1    course, since seniority in the House is next to godliness.
A37 0900  1       A dour, gangling man with a choppy gait, Colmer
A37 0900 10    looks younger than his 70 years, has gradually swung
A37 0910  7    from a moderate, internationalist position to that
A37 0920  3    of a diehard conservative. He is generally and initially
A37 0930  1    suspicious of any federal project, unless it happens
A37 0930  9    to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents. He is, of course,
A37 0940  8    a segregationist, but he says he has never made an
A37 0950  8    "anti-Negro" speech. For 20 years he has enjoyed his
A37 0960  4    power on the Rules Committee. There his vote, along
A37 0970  1    with those of Chairman Howard Smith, the courtly Virginia
A37 0970 10    judge, and the four Republican members, could and often
A37 0980  9    did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out,
A37 0990  1    Democratic-sponsored
A37 0990  3    welfare legislation (a tactic often acceptable to the
A37 1000  7    Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing
A37 1010  4    votes).
A37 1010  5    _EQUAL TREATMENT._
A37 1010  7       There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's
A37 1020  6    ouster: he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy
A37 1030  7    electors in Mississippi. Reprisals are not unheard
A37 1040  4    of in such situations, but the recent tendency has
A37 1050  1    been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons.
A37 1050 10    In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their
A37 1060  5    1948 rebellion against Harry Truman, and in 1957, after
A37 1070  2    Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight
A37 1080  3    Eisenhower in 1956, his fellow Democrats did not touch
A37 1090  1    his committee assignments, although they did strip
A37 1090  8    him temporarily of his patronage. (In the heat of the
A37 1100  9    anti-Colmer drive last week, Judge Smith threatened
A37 1110  3    reprisal against Powell. Said he: "We will see whether
A37 1120  3    whites and Negroes are treated the same around here".)
A37 1130  1    But Speaker Sam Rayburn, after huddling in Palm Beach
A37 1130 10    with President-elect Kennedy, decided that this year
A37 1140  8    something had to be done about the Rules Committee-
A37 1150  6    and that he was the only man who could do anything
A37 1160  3    effective.
A37 1160  4       In a tense, closed-door session with Judge Smith,
A37 1170  3    Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add
A37 1180  1    three new members to the Rules Committee (two Democrats,
A37 1180 10    including one Southerner, and one Republican). Smith
A37 1190  7    flatly rejected the offer, and Mister Sam thereupon
A37 1200  5    decided to join the rebels. The next morning he summoned
A37 1210  4    a group of top Democrats to his private office and
A37 1220  1    broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust Colmer,
A37 1220 12    whom he is said to regard as "an inferior man".
A37 1230  9       News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out. When
A37 1240  6    Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word, he turned
A37 1250  5    purple. "Unconscionable"! he shouted, and rushed off
A37 1260  3    to the Speaker's Room to object: "A dangerous precedent"!
A37 1270  1    Cannon, a powerful, conservative man, brought welcome
A37 1270  8    support to the Smith-Colmer forces: as chairman of
A37 1280  9    the Appropriations Committee, he holds over each member
A37 1290  7    the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional
A37 1300  5    district from federal pork-barrel projects. Sitting
A37 1310  2    quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge
A37 1320  1    Smith ally, Georgia's Carl Vinson, chairman of the
A37 1320  9    Armed Services Committee.
A37 1330  2    _THREAT OF WAR._
A37 1330  5       As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses,
A37 1340  3    it became clear that Judge Smith could lose. His highest
A37 1350  2    count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly
A37 1350 11    twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic
A37 1360  9    caucus. The liberals, smelling blood, were faced with
A37 1370  6    the necessity of winning three big votes- in the Democratic
A37 1380  6    Committee on Committees, in the full party caucus,
A37 1390  3    and on the floor of the House- before they could oust
A37 1400  1    Colmer. (One big question: If Colmer was to be purged,
A37 1400 11    what should the House do about the other three senior
A37 1410  9    Mississippians who supported the maverick electors?)
A37 1420  4    In all three arenas, they seemed certain of victory-
A37 1430  3    especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash.
A37 1440  1       But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed
A37 1440 10    the specter of losing a costlier war. If the Southerners
A37 1450  9    were sufficiently aroused, they could very well cut
A37 1460  6    the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their
A37 1470  3    vantage point of committee chairmanships, leaving Sam
A37 1480  1    Rayburn leading a truncated, unworkable party. With
A37 1480  8    that possibility in mind, Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately
A37 1490  7    delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees,
A37 1500  7    and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and
A37 1510  5    Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving
A37 1520  4    compromise. "Here are two old men, mad at each other
A37 1530  1    and too proud to pick up the phone", said a House Democratic
A37 1530 13    leader. "One wants a little more power, and the other
A37 1540 10    doesn't want to give up any".
A37 1550  5    _BATTLE IN THE SENATE_
A37 1550  9       The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own
A37 1560  6    version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle,
A37 1570  2    but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed
A37 1580  1    as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech. Question
A37 1580 10    at issue: How big a vote should be necessary to restrict
A37 1590 10    Senate debate- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying
A37 1600  6    filibusters?
A37 1600  7       A wide-ranging, bipartisan force- from Minnesota's
A37 1610  5    Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican
A37 1620  4    Leverett Saltonstall- was drawn up against a solid
A37 1630  6    phalanx of Southern Democrats, who have traditionally
A37 1640  1    used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills. New
A37 1640 10    Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change
A37 1650  8    the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths
A37 1660  8    of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate,
A37 1670  6    instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds. Fair
A37 1680  2    Dealer Humphrey upped the ante, asked cloture power
A37 1680 10    for a mere majority of Senators. Georgia's Dick Russell
A37 1690  8    objected politely, and the battle was joined.
A37 1700  6       Privately, the liberals admitted that the Humphrey
A37 1710  4    amendment had no chance of passage. Privately, they
A37 1720  2    also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's
A37 1720 10    three-fifths modification depended on none other than
A37 1730  7    Republican Richard Nixon. In 1957 Nixon delivered a
A37 1740  6    significant opinion that a majority of Senators had
A37 1750  3    the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each
A37 1760  1    new Congress, and that any rules laid down by previous
A37 1760 11    Congresses were not binding.
A37 1770  3       Armed with the Nixon opinion, the Senate liberals
A37 1780  1    rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke
A37 1780 10    off debate on the filibuster battle this week. Hopefully,
A37 1790  8    the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought
A37 1800  8    to a settlement once and for all.
A37 1810  1    #REPUBLICANS#
A37 1810  1    _LAST ACT_
A37 1810  3       Since Election Day, Vice President Richard Nixon
A37 1820  3    had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public
A37 1830  1    view. But with the convening of the new Congress, he
A37 1830 11    was the public man again, presiding over the Senate
A37 1840  7    until John Kennedy's Inauguration. One day last week,
A37 1850  5    Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required
A37 1860  3    him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to
A37 1870  1    hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote,
A37 1870 10    and then to make "sufficient declaration" of the election
A37 1880  7    of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential
A37 1890  7    election. Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace,
A37 1900  4    then went beyond the required "sufficient declaration".
A37 1910  1       "This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate
A37 1920  1    for the presidency announced the result of an election
A37 1920 10    in which he was defeated", he said.
A38 0010  1       The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what
A38 0010  9    it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves.
A38 0020  9    Gary Player, the small, trim South African, was the
A38 0030  6    eventual winner, but in all his 25 years he never spent
A38 0040  5    a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory
A38 0050  2    to drop in his lap. Arnold Palmer, the defending champion,
A38 0050 12    lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes
A38 0060 11    of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping
A38 0070  7    in disbelief.
A38 0070  9       "Just when you think you have it licked, this golf
A38 0080  8    course can get up and bite you", Player had said one
A38 0090  5    afternoon midway through the tournament. And that is
A38 0100  3    just what happened on the last few holes. The Augusta
A38 0100 13    National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player
A38 0110 10    and Palmer.
A38 0120  1       Player was the first to feel its teeth. After playing
A38 0120 11    a splendid first nine holes in 34- two strokes under
A38 0130  8    par- on this fifth and final day of the tournament
A38 0140  5    (Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent
A38 0150  4    rainstorm when it was only half completed), Player's
A38 0160  1    game rapidly fell to pieces. He bogeyed the 10th. After
A38 0160 11    a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed
A38 0170  7    the 13th. He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt
A38 0180  6    and finally scrambled through the last three holes
A38 0190  2    without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole
A38 0190 15    total of 280.
A38 0200  3       As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course,
A38 0210  1    Player was almost in tears. He could read on the nearby
A38 0210 12    scoreboard that Palmer, by then playing the 15th hole,
A38 0220  9    was leading him by a stroke. Palmer had started the
A38 0230  5    round four strokes behind Player, and at one point
A38 0240  3    in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes.
A38 0240 14    Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect
A38 0250 13    the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf.
A38 0260  6       When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway
A38 0270  5    on the 72nd hole, he seemed to have the championship
A38 0280  1    won. But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the
A38 0280 12    green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight
A38 0290 10    depression. In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge
A38 0300  8    Palmer bounced the ball over the green, past spectators
A38 0310  3    and down the slope toward a ~TV tower.
A38 0310 11       Afterwards, Palmer told Charlie Coe, his last-round
A38 0320  8    partner, that he simply played the hole too fast. He
A38 0330  8    did seem hasty on his second and third shots, but then
A38 0340  5    there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while
A38 0350  1    Coe graciously putted out, giving Palmer a chance to
A38 0350 10    recover his composure, which he had quite visibly lost.
A38 0360  7       When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth
A38 0370  6    shot, he overshot the hole by 15 feet. Palmer was now
A38 0380  4    putting merely for a tie, and Player, who was sitting
A38 0390  1    beside his wife and watching it all on television in
A38 0390 11    Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment,
A38 0400  5    stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt.
A38 0410  5       Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was
A38 0420  4    a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest
A38 0430  1    pro, but it was barely good enough for a second-place
A38 0430 12    tie with Coe. The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur,
A38 0440  7    who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many
A38 0450  5    years, refused to let the Masters jitters overtake
A38 0460  2    him and closed the tournament with his second straight
A38 0460 11    69.
A38 0470  1    #END AT SEVEN#
A38 0470  3    Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played
A38 0480  1    seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters- four
A38 0480 10    last year and three this- without ever being out of
A38 0490  9    first place. As evening approached and Palmer finished
A38 0500  5    his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par
A38 0510  4    73, this remarkable record was still intact, thanks
A38 0510 12    to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69. His
A38 0520 11    three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than
A38 0530  8    the next best score, a 213 by Bill Collins, the tall
A38 0540  4    and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very
A38 0550  2    well all winter long.
A38 0550  6       But Palmer knew, as did everybody else at Augusta,
A38 0560  4    that his streak was about to be broken. Half an hour
A38 0570  1    after he finished his round, Player holed out at the
A38 0570 11    18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206,
A38 0580 10    four strokes ahead of Palmer.
A38 0590  1       More than a streak had ended. Long after the erratic
A38 0590 11    climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have
A38 0600 10    become meteorological footnotes, the 1961 Masters will
A38 0610  6    be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between
A38 0620  5    Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. Unlike most such sports
A38 0630  3    rivalries, it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously,
A38 0640  1    although this was not exactly the case.
A38 0640  8       When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January
A38 0650  8    there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering
A38 0660  4    prestige. As if to confirm his stature, he quickly
A38 0670  3    won three of the first eight tournaments. Player won
A38 0670 12    only one. But as the tour reached Pensacola a month
A38 0680 10    ago, Player was leading Palmer in official winnings
A38 0690  6    by a few hundred dollars, and the rest of the field
A38 0700  5    was somewhere off in nowhere. On the final round at
A38 0710  1    Pensacola, the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player
A38 0710 11    in the same threesome and, although it was far from
A38 0720  8    obvious at the time, the gallery was treated to the
A38 0730  5    first chapter of what promises to be one of the most
A38 0740  3    exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.
A38 0740 13       On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer
A38 0750  8    nor Player was leading the tournament and, as it turned
A38 0760  7    out, neither won it. But whichever of these two finished
A38 0770  5    ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial
A38 0780  1    leader of the tour. Player immediately proved he was
A38 0780 10    not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of
A38 0790  8    Palmer. He outplayed Palmer all around the course and
A38 0800  6    finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71. Thereafter,
A38 0810  3    until the Masters, Player gradually increased his lead
A38 0820  3    over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament
A38 0820 12    victory at Miami. When they reached Augusta last week,
A38 0830  9    together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to
A38 0840  8    date.
A38 0840  9    #INSTANT RIVALRY#
A38 0840 11    On Thursday, the first day of the Masters, the contest
A38 0850  9    between Palmer and Player developed instantly. It was
A38 0860  6    a dismal, drizzly day but a good one on which to score
A38 0870  6    over the Augusta National course. The usually skiddy
A38 0880  2    greens were moist and soft, so the golfers were able
A38 0880 12    to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick
A38 0890  9    and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry
A38 0900  7    about the consequences. Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got
A38 0910  3    him off to an early lead, which he shared with Bob
A38 0910 14    Rosburg. But Player was only one stroke back, with
A38 0920  9    a 69.
A38 0920 11       Even so, it was still not clear to many in the enormous
A38 0930 12    horde of spectators- unquestionably the largest golf
A38 0940  7    crowd ever- that this tournament was to be, essentially,
A38 0950  5    a match between Palmer and Player. A lot of people
A38 0960  3    were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus, the spectacular
A38 0970  1    young amateur, who had a 70; or Ken Venturi, who had
A38 0970 12    a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better; or
A38 0980  9    Rosburg, whose accurate short game and supersensitive
A38 0990  4    putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries;
A38 1000  1    or even old Byron Nelson, whose excellent 71 made one
A38 1010  1    wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf.
A38 1010 11    (On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking
A38 1020  7    of Charlie Coe.)
A38 1030  1       On Friday, a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday
A38 1030 10    had been gray and ugly, the plot of the tournament
A38 1040  7    came clearly into focus. Rosburg had started early
A38 1050  4    in the day, and by the time Palmer and Player were
A38 1060  1    on the course- separated, as they were destined to
A38 1060 10    be for the rest of the weekend, by about half an hour-
A38 1080  6    they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted
A38 1090  3    around the course that Rosburg, who ended with a 73,
A38 1100  2    was not having a good day.
A38 1100  8       As Player began his second round in a twosome with
A38 1110  5    amateur Bill Hyndman, his share of the gallery was
A38 1120  2    not conspicuously large for a contender. Player began
A38 1120 10    with a birdie on the first hole, added five straight
A38 1130  8    pars and then another birdie at the 9th. On the back
A38 1140  7    nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery
A38 1150  3    that stayed with him the rest of the tournament. He
A38 1150 13    birdied the 13th, the 15th and the 18th- five birdies,
A38 1160 10    one bogey and 12 pars for a 68.
A38 1170  4       Starting half an hour behind Player in company with
A38 1180  1    British Open Champion Kel Nagle, Palmer birdied the
A38 1180  9    2nd, the 9th, the 13th and the 16th- four birdies,
A38 1190  9    one bogey and 13 pars for a 69. The roar of Palmer's
A38 1200  7    gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out
A38 1210  3    across the parklike landscape of Augusta, only to be
A38 1210 12    answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery
A38 1220  9    for a similar triumph. At one point late in the day,
A38 1230  8    when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th,
A38 1240  5    a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green
A38 1250  2    unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the
A38 1250  9    final hole. Without so much as a grimace or a gesture
A38 1260 10    to show that he had noticed (although he later admitted
A38 1270  5    that he had) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer,
A38 1280  4    and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling
A38 1290  1    back along the intervening fairways in reply.
A38 1290  8    #THE BOLDNESS OF CHAMPIONS#
A38 1300  1    Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under
A38 1300 11    way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted
A38 1310  9    golfers were playing this most difficult golf course.
A38 1320  6    It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the
A38 1330  4    game of golf for any period of time attack their shots
A38 1340  1    with a vehemence bordering on violence. The bad luck
A38 1340 10    that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is
A38 1350  9    simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous
A38 1360  4    boldness of these champions. Bob Jones played that
A38 1370  2    way. Byron Nelson did, Hogan did. And last week at
A38 1370 12    the Masters Palmer and Player did.
A38 1380  5       As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday
A38 1390  4    and the duel was resumed in earnest, it was Player's
A38 1400  1    superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead.
A38 1400  9    This day Palmer had started first. As Player stepped
A38 1410  9    on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the
A38 1420  8    first two holes and already was 2 under par for the
A38 1430  6    day. Player immediately proceeded to follow suit. In
A38 1440  2    fact, he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well,
A38 1440 14    to go 4 under par for the first eight holes.
A38 1450  7       But Player's real test came on the ninth hole, a
A38 1460  6    downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards. He
A38 1470  2    hit a poor tee shot, pulling it off into the pine woods
A38 1470 14    separating the 9th and first fairways. Having hit one
A38 1480  9    of the trees, the ball came to rest not more than 160
A38 1490  7    yards out. Player then had the choice of punching the
A38 1500  3    ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and
A38 1500 14    settling for a bogey 5, or gambling. The latter involved
A38 1510 10    hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and
A38 1520  9    toward the clubhouse, hoping to slice it back to the
A38 1530  6    deeply bunkered 9th green.
A38 1530 10       "I was hitting the ball well", Player said later,
A38 1540  7    "and I felt strong. When you're playing like that you'd
A38 1550  6    better attack".
A38 1550  8       Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot
A38 1560  9    that few who saw it will ever forget. It struck the
A38 1570  5    9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge.
A38 1580  2    From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a
A38 1580 13    par 4.
A38 1590  1       Palmer, meanwhile, had been having his troubles.
A38 1590  8    They started on the 4th hole, a 220-yard par-3. On
A38 1600 10    this day the wind had switched 180` from the northwest
A38 1610  4    to the southeast, and nearly every shot on the course
A38 1620  2    was different from the previous few days. At the 4th
A38 1620 12    tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood
A38 1630 11    was the proper club, so he put the ball in a bunker
A38 1640  8    in front of the green. His bogey 4 on this hole and
A38 1650  3    subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at
A38 1650 14    8 brought him back to even par.
A38 1660  6       Starting the second nine, Palmer was already four
A38 1670  3    strokes behind Player and knew it.
A39 0010  1       When Mickey Charles Mantle, the New York Yankees'
A39 0010  9    man of muscle, drives a home run 450 feet into the
A39 0020 11    bleachers, his feat touches upon the sublime. When
A39 0030  5    Roger Eugene Maris, Mantle's muscular teammate, powers
A39 0040  3    four home runs in a double-header, his performance
A39 0050  1    merits awe. But when tiny, 145-pound Albert Gregory
A39 0050 10    Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels, who once caught
A39 0060  7    three straight fly balls in center field because, as
A39 0070  4    a teammate explained, "the other team thought no one
A39 0080  3    was out there", hits seven home runs in four months
A39 0080 13    (three more than his total in 1958, 1959, and 1960),
A39 0090 10    his achievement borders on the ridiculous. This is
A39 0100  6    Baseball 1961. This is the year home runs ranged from
A39 0110  3    the sublime to the ridiculous.
A39 0110  8       It is the year when (1) amiable Jim Gentile of the
A39 0120  7    Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive
A39 0130  4    innings with the bases loaded and, in unprecedented
A39 0140  1    style, delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs;
A39 0140  8    (2) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed
A39 0150  7    a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to
A39 0160  6    stroke four home runs in a game; (3) the Milwaukee
A39 0170  2    Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home
A39 0170 11    runs in three games and lost two of them; and (4) catcher
A39 0180 12    Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a
A39 0190  8    record with home runs in four successive times at bat,
A39 0200  5    two of them as a pinch-hitter.
A39 0200 12       Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats,
A39 0210  8    the shrinking strike zone, and the fact that the knock-down
A39 0220  9    pitch is now illegal. Experts point to the thinning
A39 0230  5    of pitching talent in the American League caused by
A39 0240  2    expansion. Whatever the reasons, not in 30 years has
A39 0240 11    a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon
A39 0250  6    the bureau of baseball records, home-run division.
A39 0260  4       Of all the records in peril, one stands apart, dramatic
A39 0270  3    in its making, dramatic in its endurance, and now,
A39 0280  1    doubly dramatic in its jeopardy. This, of course, is
A39 0280 10    baseball's most remarkable mark: The 60 home runs hit
A39 0290  8    in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure, the incredible
A39 0300  4    athlete, George Herman (Babe) Ruth of the Yankees.
A39 0310  2       Since 1927, fewer than a dozen men have made serious
A39 0320  1    runs at Babe Ruth's record and each, in turn, has been
A39 0320 12    thwarted. What ultimately frustrated every challenger
A39 0330  6    was Ruth's amazing September surge. In the final month
A39 0340  6    of the 1927 season, he hit seventeen home runs, a closing
A39 0350  5    spurt never matched.
A39 0350  8    #DOUBLE THREAT:#
A39 0355  1    Always, in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record,
A39 0360  8    one man alone- a Jimmy Foxx (58 in 1932) or a Hank
A39 0370  9    Greenberg (58 in 1938) or a Hack Wilson (56 in 1930)-
A39 0380  5    made the bid. But now, for the first time since Lou
A39 0390  3    Gehrig (with 47 home runs) spurred Ruth on in 1927,
A39 0390 13    two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on
A39 0400 10    60. Their names are Mantle and Maris, their team is
A39 0410  6    the Yankees, and their threat is real.
A39 0420  1       After 108 games in 1927, Ruth had 35 home runs.
A39 0420 11    After 108 games in 1961, Mickey Mantle has 43, Roger
A39 0430  9    Maris 41. Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces
A39 0440  5    over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games, and, mathematically,
A39 0450  4    each will hit more than 60 home runs. This is the great
A39 0460  2    edge the two Yankees have going for them. To better
A39 0460 12    Ruth's mark, neither needs a spectacular September
A39 0470  7    flourish. All Mantle needs is eight more home runs
A39 0480  7    in August and ten in September, and he will establish
A39 0490  5    a new record. In Ruth's day- and until this year- the
A39 0500  2    schedule was 154 games. Baseball commissioner Ford
A39 0500  9    Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official
A39 0510  9    unless it is broken in 154 games.)
A39 0520  5       "Even on the basis of 154 games, this is the ideal
A39 0530  4    situation", insists Hank Greenberg, now vice-president
A39 0540  1    of the Chicago White Sox. "It has to be easier with
A39 0540 12    two of them. How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle"?
A39 0550 10    #ROOMMATES:#
A39 0560  1    Neither Mantle nor Maris, understandably, will predict
A39 0560  8    60 home runs for himself. Although both concede they
A39 0570  7    would like to hit 60, they stick primarily to the baseball
A39 0580  6    player's standard quote: "The important thing is to
A39 0590  5    win the pennant". But one thing is for certain: There
A39 0600  2    is no dissension between Mantle, the American League's
A39 0610  1    Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957, and Maris, the
A39 0610 11    ~MVP in 1960. Each enjoys seeing the other hit home
A39 0620 10    runs ("I hope Roger hits 80", Mantle says), and each
A39 0630  7    enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ("and
A39 0640  5    I hope I hit 81").
A39 0640 10       The sluggers get along so well in fact, that with
A39 0650  8    their families at home for the summer (Mantle's in
A39 0660  3    Dallas, Maris's in Kansas City), they are rooming together.
A39 0670  2    Mantle, Maris, and Bob Cerv, a utility outfielder,
A39 0670 10    share an apartment in Jamaica, Long Island, not far
A39 0680  9    from New York International Airport. The three pay
A39 0690  6    $251 a month for four rooms (kitchen, dining room,
A39 0700  3    living room, and bedroom), with air-conditioning and
A39 0710  2    new modern furniture. Mantle and Cerv use the twin
A39 0710 11    beds in the bedroom; Maris sleeps on a green studio
A39 0720  7    couch in the living room. They divide up the household
A39 0730  5    chores: Cerv does most of the cooking (breakfast and
A39 0740  2    sandwich snacks, with dinner out), Mantle supplies
A39 0740  9    the transportation (a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible),
A39 0750  7    and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment
A39 0760  8    house to Yankee Stadium. Mantle, Maris, and Cerv probably
A39 0770  6    share one major-league record already: Among them,
A39 0780  3    they have fifteen children- eight for Cerv, four for
A39 0790  2    Mantle, and three for Maris.
A39 0790  7       As roommates, teammates, and home-run mates, Mantle,
A39 0800  6    29, who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago, and
A39 0810  3    Maris, 26, who came to the Yankees from Kansas City
A39 0820  1    two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds.
A39 0820  8    Both were scholastic stars in football, basketball,
A39 0830  5    and baseball (Mantle in Commerce, Okla&, Maris in Fargo,
A39 0840  5    N&D&); as halfbacks, both came close to playing football
A39 0850  4    at the University of Oklahoma ("Sometimes in the minors",
A39 0860  4    Maris recalls, "I wished I had gone to Oklahoma").
A39 0870  1       To an extent, the two even look alike. Both have
A39 0870 11    blue eyes and short blond hair. Both are 6 feet tall
A39 0880 11    and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds, but Mantle, incredibly
A39 0890  7    muscular (he has a 17-1/2-inch neck), looks bigger.
A39 0900  4    With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders,
A39 0910  1    both must have their clothes made to order. Maris purchases
A39 0910 11    $100 suits from Simpson's in New York. Mantle, more
A39 0920  9    concerned with dress, buys his suits four at a time
A39 0930  9    at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250
A39 0940  6    each.
A39 0940  7    #LIGHT READING:#
A39 0940  9    Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified
A39 0950  6    an intellectual, but lately Mantle has shown unusual
A39 0960  4    devotion to an intellectual opus, Henry Miller's "Tropic
A39 0970  2    of Cancer". Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate
A39 0980  1    literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by
A39 0980  9    reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips.
A39 0990  6       Mantle is not normally given to public speaking-
A39 1000  5    or, for that matter, to private speaking. "What do
A39 1010  3    you and Mickey talk about at home"? a reporter asked
A39 1020  1    Maris recently.
A39 1020  3       "To tell you the truth", Maris said, "Mickey don't
A39 1030  2    talk much".
A39 1030  4       This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer. What
A39 1040  4    is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris,
A39 1050  1    under constant pressure from writers and photographers,
A39 1050  8    are trying to be cooperative.
A39 1060  4       Of the two, Mantle is by nature the less outgoing,
A39 1070  2    Maris the more outspoken. But last week, when a reporter
A39 1080  1    was standing near Mantle's locker, Mickey walked up
A39 1080  9    and volunteered an anecdote. "See that kid"? he said,
A39 1090  8    pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy. "That's
A39 1100  6    [Yogi] Berra's. I'll never forget one time I struck
A39 1110  6    out three times, dropped a fly ball, and we lost the
A39 1120  3    game. I came back, sitting by my locker, feeling real
A39 1120 13    low, and the kid walks over to me, looks up, and says:
A39 1130 12    'You stunk'".
A39 1140  1       Maris, in talking to reporters, tries to answer
A39 1140  9    all questions candidly and fully, but on rare occasions,
A39 1150  8    he shuns newsmen. "When I've made a dumb play", he
A39 1160  7    says, "I don't want to talk to anyone. I'm angry".
A39 1170  4       By his own confession, Maris is an angry young man.
A39 1180  4    Benched at Tulsa in 1955, he told manager Dutch Meyer:
A39 1190  1    "I can't play for you. Send me where I can play". (Meyer
A39 1200  1    sent him to Reading, Pa&.) Benched at Indianapolis
A39 1200  9    in 1956, he told manager Kerby Farrell: "I'm not learning
A39 1210  9    anything on the bench. Play me". (Farrell did- and
A39 1220  8    Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series.)
A39 1230  6    "That's the way I am", he says. "I tell people what
A39 1240  7    I think. If you're a good ballplayer, you've got to
A39 1250  4    get mad. Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll
A39 1260  1    give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you
A39 1260 12    nine out of ten times".
A39 1270  3    #IDOLS' IDOLS:#
A39 1270  5    One good indication of the two men's personalities
A39 1280  3    is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.
A39 1290  1    Maris's was Ted Williams. "When I was a kid", Maris
A39 1300  1    told a sportswriter last week, "I used to follow Williams
A39 1300 11    every day in the box score, just to see whether he
A39 1310 10    got a hit or not".
A39 1320  1       "When you came up to the majors, did you seek out
A39 1320 12    Williams for advice"?
A39 1330  1       "Are you kidding"? said Maris. "You're afraid to
A39 1340  3    talk to a guy you idolize".
A39 1340  9       Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio. "When Mickey went
A39 1350  5    to the Yankees", says Mark Freeman, an ex-Yankee pitcher
A39 1360  5    who sells mutual funds in Denver, "DiMaggio still was
A39 1370  3    playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker,
A39 1380  1    just aching for some word of encouragement from this
A39 1380 10    great man, this hero of his. But DiMaggio never said
A39 1390  8    a word. It crushed Mickey. He told me he vowed right
A39 1400  7    then that if he ever got to be a star, this never would
A39 1410  3    be said of him". Mantle has kept the vow. Among all
A39 1420  1    the Yankees, he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.
A39 1420 11       Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball
A39 1430  9    above all else. If laying ties on a railroad track,
A39 1440  8    which he once did for $1 an hour, paid more than playing
A39 1450  5    right field for the Yankees, Maris would lay ties on
A39 1460  4    a railroad track. If working in a zinc mine, which
A39 1460 14    he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour, paid more than
A39 1470 11    playing center field for the Yankees, Mantle would
A39 1480  5    work in a zinc mine. But since railroading and mining
A39 1490  3    are not the highest paid arts, Mantle and Maris concentrate
A39 1500  1    on baseball. They try to play baseball the best they
A39 1500 11    can.
A39 1510  1       Each is a complete ballplayer. Mantle, beyond any
A39 1510  9    question, can do more things well. ("One of the reasons
A39 1520  9    they get along fine", says a sportswriter who is friendly
A39 1530  7    with the two men, "is that both realize Mantle is
A39 1540  4    head-and-shoulders
A39 1540  7    above Maris".) Hitting, Mantle has an immediate advantage
A39 1560  5    because he bats both left-handed and right-handed,
A39 1570  1    Maris only left-handed. They both possess near classic
A39 1575  1    stances, dug in firmly, arms high, set for fierce swings.
A39 1580 10    Mantle is considerably better hitting for average (.332,
A39 1590  6    fourth in the league, to .280 for Maris so far this
A39 1600  6    year).
A39 1600  7       Both are good bunters: Maris once beat out eighteen
A39 1610  5    of nineteen in the minor leagues; Mantle is a master
A39 1620  4    at dragging a bunt toward first base. Both have brilliant
A39 1630  1    speed: Mantle was timed from home plate (batting left-handed)
A39 1630 11    to first base in 3.1 seconds, faster than any other
A39 1640 10    major leaguer; Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds
A39 1650  9    in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio,
A39 1660  5    the swift, base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox.
A39 1670  3    Both are good, daring fielders: Mantle covers more
A39 1680  1    ground; Maris's throwing arm is stronger.
A39 1680  7       Yet with all their skills, the appeal of Mantle
A39 1690  6    and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic: The home
A39 1700  4    run. With this ultimate weapon, the two Yankees may
A39 1710  2    have saved baseball from its dullest season. (American
A39 1710 10    League expansion created, inevitably, weaker teams.
A39 1720  5    Only two teams in each league [the Yankees and Detroit,
A39 1730  5    the Dodgers and Cincinnati] are battling for first
A39 1740  3    place.
A39 1740  4       Appropriately, the emphasis on the home run, at
A39 1750  3    a peak this year, came into being at baseball's lowest
A39 1750 13    moment. In 1920, as the startling news that the 1919
A39 1760 10    White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked
A39 1770  7    out, fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball.
A39 1780  5    Something was needed to revive interest; the something
A39 1790  3    was the home run.
A40 0010  1       Into Washington on President-elect John F& Kennedy's
A40 0020  1    Convair, the Caroline, winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra
A40 0030  1    and his close Hollywood pal, Cinemactor Peter Lawford,
A40 0030  9    Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law. Also included in the
A40 0040  9    entourage: a dog in a black sweater, Frankie and Peter
A40 0050  8    had an urgent mission: to stage a mammoth Inauguration
A40 0060  4    Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard
A40 0070  3    Armory. Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas, as he
A40 0080  2    had hinted upon his arrival: "It's really tremendous
A40 0080 10    when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia.
A40 0090  8    I could talk to you for three hours and still not be
A40 0100  9    able to give you all of our plans"! As the plans were
A40 0110  5    laid, some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced
A40 0120  3    in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes
A40 0120 13    priced at $10,000 each. The biggest single act would
A40 0130  9    doubtless be staged by Frankie himself: his Inaugural
A40 0140  6    wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don
A40 0150  4    Loper, who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles. Soon
A40 0160  2    after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered
A40 0170  1    "two of everything" just "in case he spills anything",
A40 0170 10    Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed
A40 0180 11    he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing. @
A40 0190  5    ##
A40 0190  6    A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior
A40 0200  4    to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps, General
A40 0210  2    David M& Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in
A40 0220  2    the form of a "happy, warless New Year" greeting to
A40 0220 12    his Pentagon staff. Said Leatherneck Shoup: "A year
A40 0230  8    ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands. After
A40 0240  9    pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the
A40 0250  5    moldboard, I lifted the lines from the dust and found
A40 0260  2    hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a
A40 0260 13    rein on. Little geeing and hawing have been necessary".
A40 0270  7    But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots. Speaking
A40 0280  8    of "pride", he deplored the noncommissioned officer
A40 0290  4    "whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who
A40 0300  3    retired in 1940; the officer with the yellow socks

A40 0690  7    One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers,
A40 0700  5    the U&S&S&R&'s daily Izvestia, enterprisingly interviewed
A40 0710  5    Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa,
A40 0720  7    where he has been in self-exile since 1952. Chaplin,
A40 0730  6    71, who met K& when the Soviet boss visited England
A40 0740  3    in 1956, confided that he hopes to visit Russia some
A40 0750  2    time this summer because "I have marveled at your grandiose
A40 0750 12    experiment and I believe in your future". Then Charlie
A40 0760  9    spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he
A40 0770  8    had glimpsed: "I was captivated by his humor, frankness
A40 0780  5    and good nature and by his kind, strong and somewhat
A40 0790  3    sly face".
A40 0800  1       G& David Thompson is one of those names known to
A40 0800 11    the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen
A40 0810  7    in Europe's best hotels, but he is somewhat of an enigma
A40 0820  8    to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh.
A40 0830  3    There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth, a
A40 0840  1    reputation for eccentricity, and an ardor for collecting
A40 0840  9    art. Last week, in the German city of Du^sseldorf,
A40 0850  7    G& David Thompson was making headlines that could well
A40 0860  6    give Pittsburgh pause. On display were 343 first-class
A40 0870  4    paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection-
A40 0880  3    and every single one of them was up for sale.
A40 0880 13       Like Philadelphia's late Dr& Albert C& Barnes who
A40 0890  7    kept his own great collection closed to the general
A40 0900  5    public (TIME, Jan& 2), Thompson, at 61, is something
A40 0910  5    of a legend in his own lifetime. He made his fortune
A40 0920  2    during World War /2, when he took over a number of
A40 0920 13    dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom.
A40 0930 10    Even before he hit big money, he had begun buying modern
A40 0940  8    paintings. He gave the impression of never having read
A40 0950  5    a word about art, but there was no doubt that he had
A40 0960  3    an eye for the best.
A40 0960  8       He was able to smell a bargain- and a masterpiece-
A40 0970  4    a continent away, and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred
A40 0980  2    Barr said of him: "I have never mentioned a new artist
A40 0990  1    that Thompson didn't know about". He might barge into
A40 0990 10    a gallery, start haggling over prices without so much
A40 1000  8    as a word of greeting. He could be lavishly generous
A40 1010  6    with friends, cab drivers and bellboys, but with dealers
A40 1020  4    he was tough. He bought up Cezannes, Braques, Matisses,
A40 1030  1    Legers, a splendid Picasso series, more than 70 Giacometti
A40 1040  1    sculptures. He gathered one of the biggest collections
A40 1040  9    of Paul Klees in the world. All these he hung in his
A40 1050 10    burglarproof home called Stone's Throw, outside Pittsburgh,
A40 1060  4    and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see
A40 1070  5    them.
A40 1070  6       Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to
A40 1080  3    the city. But he insisted that it be housed in a special
A40 1090  1    museum. Pittsburgh turned him down, just as Pittsburgh
A40 1090  9    society had been snubbing him for years. He went then
A40 1100  9    to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler,
A40 1110  5    with whom he had long been trading pictures. Last year
A40 1120  3    Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees
A40 1130  1    to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which will
A40 1130 10    house them in a museum that is yet to be built. Last
A40 1140 10    week most of the other prizes, once offered to Pittsburgh,
A40 1150  5    went on the block.
A40 1150  9       At the opening of the Du^sseldorf show, Thompson
A40 1160  6    himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was
A40 1170  5    seeing together for the last time. In fact he seemed
A40 1180  2    delighted to get rid of them. Some observers speculated
A40 1180 11    that this might be his revenge on his home town. Thompson
A40 1190 11    himself said: "I want to enjoy once more the pleasure
A40 1200  9    of bare walls waiting for new pictures".
A40 1220  1    #BREAK IN GEORGIA#
A40 1220  4    The University of Georgia has long claimed that it
A40 1230  2    does not discriminate against any applicant on the
A40 1230 10    basis of race or color. But in all its 175 years, not
A40 1240 12    a single Negro student has entered its classrooms.
A40 1250  6    Last week Federal District Judge William A& Bootle
A40 1260  4    ordered the university to admit immediately a "qualified"
A40 1270  3    Negro boy and girl. Their entry will crack the total
A40 1280  2    segregation of all public education, from kindergarten
A40 1280  9    through graduate school, in Georgia- and in Alabama,
A40 1290  7    Mississippi and South Carolina as well.
A40 1300  4       For 18 months, Hamilton Holmes, 19, and Charlayne
A40 1310  2    Hunter, 18, had tried to get into the university. They
A40 1310 12    graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School,
A40 1320  7    where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and
A40 1330  8    Charlayne third. The university rejected them on a
A40 1340  5    variety of pretexts, but was careful never to mention
A40 1350  3    the color of their skins. Holmes went to Atlanta's
A40 1350 12    Morehouse (Negro) College, where he is a B+ student
A40 1360  9    and star halfback. Charlayne studied journalism at
A40 1370  5    Detroit's Wayne State University. Last fall, after
A40 1380  4    they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court,
A40 1390  2    Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again.
A40 1390  9       Charlayne was "tentatively" admitted for next fall,
A40 1400  7    after state investigators questioned her white roommate
A40 1410  5    at Wayne State. But Holmes was rejected again "on the
A40 1420  4    basis of his record and interview". The evidence in
A40 1430  2    court was testimony about the interview, which for
A40 1430 10    Holmes lasted an hour, although at least one white
A40 1440  8    student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple
A40 1450  6    phone conversation. Holmes was asked if he had ever
A40 1460  3    visited a house of prostitution, or a "beatnik parlor
A40 1460 12    or teahouse". No, said he, but officials still called
A40 1470  8    him "evasive". They also said he lied in saying that
A40 1480  9    he had never been "arrested". Their reason: Holmes
A40 1490  4    once paid a $20 speeding fine, had his license suspended.
A40 1500  2       Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white
A40 1510  1    students, found that many were hardly interviewed at
A40 1510  9    all- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton
A40 1520  8    Holmes. The real reason for his rejection, they argued,
A40 1530  6    is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off
A40 1540  3    funds for any desegregated school.
A40 1540  8       Judge Bootle's decision: "The two plaintiffs are
A40 1550  6    qualified for admission to said university and would
A40 1560  6    already have been admitted had it not been for their
A40 1570  3    race and color". The state will appeal- but few think
A40 1580  1    it will actually try to close the university. "Surprised
A40 1580 10    and pleased", Students Holmes and Hunter may enter
A40 1590  7    the University of Georgia this week.
A40 1595  3    #CATCH FOR CHICAGO#
A40 1595  6    When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence
A40 1600  4    A& Kimpton submitted his resignation last March, a
A40 1610  7    mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway. Out went letters
A40 1620  7    to 60,000 old grads, asking for suggestions. Such academic
A40 1630  4    statesmen as James B& Conant were consulted. Two committees
A40 1640  3    pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors, including
A40 1650  1    Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon, and Harvard's Dean
A40 1650  8    McGeorge Bundy. The debate led to a decision that Chicago
A40 1660 10    needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic
A40 1670  8    administrator, but rather, as Trustee Chairman Glen
A40 1680  5    A& Lloyd put it, "a top scholar in his own right"-
A40 1690  4    a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago.
A40 1700  1       Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar
A40 1700  9    in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty: dynamic Geneticist
A40 1710  8    George Wells Beadle, 57, who shared the 1958 Nobel
A40 1720  8    Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how
A40 1730  4    genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry
A40 1740  2    (TIME, Cover, July 14, 1958).
A40 1740  7       It fell to Chancellor Kimpton, now a Standard Oil
A40 1750  6    (Indiana) executive, to spend his nine-year reign tidying
A40 1760  6    up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert
A40 1770  3    Maynard Hutchins. He threw out some of Hutchins' more
A40 1780  2    wildly experimental courses, raised sagging undergraduate
A40 1780  8    enrollment to 2,100, nearly doubled endowment to $139.3
A40 1790  8    million. But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he
A40 1800  7    felt was working order, some old grads feel that it
A40 1810  4    still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled
A40 1810 13    it in the heady Hutchins era.
A40 1820  6       At Caltech, Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to
A40 1830  5    his research as head of the school's famous biology
A40 1840  1    division since 1946. But he has shown a sixth-sense
A40 1840 11    ability to spot, recruit and excite able researchers,
A40 1850  6    and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising
A40 1860  5    and speech-making. Beadle is even that rare scientist
A40 1870  1    who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads
A40 1870 11    the Wall Street Journal, and took delight in driving
A40 1880  9    a $250 model ~A Ford for 22 years, then selling it
A40 1890  8    for $300.
A41 0010  1       A philosopher may point out that the troubles of
A41 0010 10    the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently
A41 0020  7    will never end. But a historian might put his finger
A41 0030  5    on a specific man and date, and hold out the hope that
A41 0040  2    the troubles will sometime pass away. The man was King
A41 0040 12    Leopold /2, of the Belgians, who in 1885 concluded
A41 0050  9    that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing
A41 0060  7    was still good. By force, he took under his protection,
A41 0070  3    or stole, 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central
A41 0080  1    Africa. This is an area nearly as large as Western
A41 0080 11    Europe; and it was filled then as now by quarreling
A41 0090 10    tribes with no political or historical unity. Its boundaries
A41 0100  6    had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings;
A41 0110  4    they were determined by the points at which Leopold's
A41 0120  1    explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.
A41 0120  8       The population of the Congo is 13.5 million, divided
A41 0130  8    into at least seven major "culture clusters" and innumerable
A41 0140  5    tribes speaking 400 separate dialects. The religions
A41 0150  4    of the people include Christianity, Mohammedanism,
A41 0160  1    paganism, ancestor worship and animism. The climate
A41 0160  8    ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate.
A41 0170  7    The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants
A41 0180  4    or run over by sports cars. To make one nation out
A41 0190  3    of these disparities would be a problem large enough
A41 0190 12    in any case; it has been made far more difficult by
A41 0200 10    what the Belgians have done, or failed to do, in the
A41 0210  8    Congo since 1885.
A41 0210 11       At first the Belgian royal family administered the
A41 0220  6    Congo as its own private property. But by 1908 its
A41 0230  5    record of brutality had touched the national conscience.
A41 0240  1    The Belgian government itself took over administration,
A41 0240  8    commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the
A41 0250  8    history of colonialism. One definition of paternalism
A41 0260  5    is "The principle or practice, on the part of a government,
A41 0270  7    of managing the affairs of a country in the manner
A41 0280  3    of a father dealing with his children". The honor of
A41 0280 13    the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned-
A41 0290 10    only their judgment. Ordinarily a father permits his
A41 0300  6    children to grow up in due time- but when the colony
A41 0310  7    received independence in 1960 the Congolese child,
A41 0320  1    if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was
A41 0320 12    52 and had until then been treated as an infant.
A41 0330  7    ##
A41 0330  8    The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic
A41 0340  5    development of the Congo, which is rich in copper,
A41 0350  2    tin, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and uranium, and cotton
A41 0350 10    and palm oil. The colony was administered from Brussels,
A41 0360  8    with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians
A41 0370  6    having any vote. The beneficiaries of this administration
A41 0380  4    were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals
A41 0390  2    and the Belgian government itself held stock. In Inside
A41 0400  1    Africa, John Gunther describes one of these, the Societe
A41 0400 10    Generale, as "the kind of colossus that might be envisaged
A41 0410 10    if, let us say, the House of Morgan, Anaconda Copper,
A41 0420  8    the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, the
A41 0430  6    Pennsylvania Railroad, and various companies producing
A41 0440  3    agricultural products were lumped together, with the
A41 0450  2    United States government as a heavy partner".
A41 0450  9       Had they been truly ruthless, the Belgians might
A41 0460  8    have exploited the Congolese without compassion. But
A41 0470  4    they were not. They provided a social security system
A41 0480  3    which covered all their African employes; their program
A41 0490  1    of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the
A41 0490 11    continent; they put much effort into public housing.
A41 0500  8    They also instituted a ration system under which all
A41 0510  5    employers in the Congo were required to furnish their
A41 0520  2    employes with clothing and adequate food. But instead
A41 0520 10    of delivering the ration- either in actual commodities
A41 0530  8    or in cash- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a
A41 0540  8    month, the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more
A41 0560  6    often. Would not the children, if they received all
A41 0570  1    their food on the first day of the month, eat it up
A41 0570 13    immediately, and later go hungry?
A41 0580  4       The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education.
A41 0590  3    During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools
A41 0590 13    in the Congo. But almost all the schools were primary.
A41 0600 10    The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle
A41 0610  7    out the meaning of "la chatte" and "le chien" and write
A41 0620  6    his name. Some schools were technical- the Belgians
A41 0630  3    needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the
A41 0640  2    land, and trained many. But they did not believe in
A41 0640 12    widespread secondary education, much less in college.
A41 0650  7    It was their conviction that the people should be "brought
A41 0660  7    up together", a grade at a time, until in some indefinite
A41 0670  5    future some might be ready to tackle history, economics
A41 0680  2    and political science. Indeed, the Belgians discouraged
A41 0690  1    higher education, fearing the creation of a native
A41 0690  9    intellectual elite which might cause unrest. When the
A41 0700  7    Congo received its independence in 1960 there were,
A41 0710  5    among its 13.5 million people, exactly 14 university
A41 0720  1    graduates.
A41 0720  2    ##
A41 0720  3    Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony
A41 0730  2    so manifestly unprepared to accept it? In one large
A41 0730 11    oversimplification, it might be said that the Belgians
A41 0740  8    felt, far too late, the gale of nationalism sweeping
A41 0750  5    Africa. They lacked time to prepare the Congo, as the
A41 0760  5    British and French had prepared their colonies. The
A41 0770  1    Congolese were clamoring for their independence, even
A41 0770  8    though most were unsure what it meant; and in Brussels,
A41 0780  9    street crowds shouted, "Pas une goutte de sang!" (Not
A41 0790  7    one drop of blood!). The Belgians would not fight for
A41 0800  6    the privilege of being the detested pedagogue; rather
A41 0810  2    than teach where teaching was not wanted, they would
A41 0820  1    wash their hands of the mess. It is hard to blame them
A41 0820 13    for this. Yet there were other motivations and actions
A41 0830  7    which the Belgians took after independence for which
A41 0840  4    history may not find them guiltless.
A41 0850  1       As the time for independence approached there were
A41 0850  8    in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties, or
A41 0860  7    approximately eight for each university graduate. There
A41 0870  3    were four principal ones. First, there were those Congolese
A41 0880  2    (among them Joseph Kasavubu) who favored splitting
A41 0880  9    the country into small independent states, Balkanizing
A41 0890  7    it. Second, there were those (Moise Tshombe) who favored
A41 0900  7    near-Balkanization, a loose federalism having a central
A41 0910  5    government of limited authority, with much power residing
A41 0920  4    in the states. Third, there were those (notably Patrice
A41 0930  1    Lumumba) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong
A41 0930 11    central government. And fourth, there were moderates
A41 0940  7    who were in no hurry for independence and wished to
A41 0950  6    wait until the Congo grew up. However, the positions
A41 0960  3    of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.
A41 0970  1       A final factor which contributed greatly to the
A41 0970  9    fragmentation of the Congo, immediately after independence,
A41 0980  7    was the provincial structure that had been established
A41 0990  5    by the Belgians for convenience in administration.
A41 1000  1    They had divided the Congo into six provinces- Leopoldville,
A41 1010  1    Kasai, Kivu, Katanga, Equator and Eastern- unfortunately
A41 1020  1    with little regard for ethnic groupings. Thus some
A41 1020  9    provinces contained tribes which detested each other,
A41 1030  6    and to them independence meant an opportunity for war.
A41 1040  5       The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with
A41 1050  2    what seemed a workable Western-style form of government:
A41 1060  1    there were to be a president and a premier, and a bicameral
A41 1060 13    legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces.
A41 1070  8    Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo
A41 1080  8    would quickly assume a respectable position in the
A41 1090  4    society of nations. If internal frictions arose, they
A41 1100  2    could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army,
A41 1100 11    the Force Publique, which had been trained and was
A41 1110  8    still officered by white Belgians. The president, Joseph
A41 1120  5    Kasavubu, seemed an able administrator and the premier,
A41 1130  4    Patrice Lumumba, a reasonable man.
A41 1130  9       Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen
A41 1140  7    commenced fighting each other. Presently the well-armed
A41 1150  7    members of the Force Publique- many of them drawn from
A41 1170  6    savage and even cannibalistic tribes, erupted in mutiny,
A41 1180  4    rioting, raping and looting. Terror engulfed the thousands
A41 1190  1    of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country.
A41 1190 10    The Belgian government decided to act, and on July
A41 1200  8    10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo. On July 11 the
A41 1210  8    head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga, Moise
A41 1220  3    Tshombe, announced that his province had seceded from
A41 1230  1    the country. Confusion became chaos; each succeeding
A41 1230  8    day brought new acts of violence. Lumumba and Kasavubu
A41 1240  8    blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians,
A41 1250  5    and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to
A41 1260  5    oust them.
A41 1260  7    ##
A41 1260  8    On July 14 the Security Council- with France and Great
A41 1270  7    Britain abstaining- voted the resolution which drew
A41 1280  3    the U&N& into the Congo. Vague in wording, it called
A41 1290  2    for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the
A41 1290 10    Secretary-General "to take the necessary steps **h
A41 1300  7    to provide the [Congolese] Government with such military
A41 1310  5    assistance as may be necessary, until, through the
A41 1320  3    efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical
A41 1330  1    assistance of the United Nations, the national security
A41 1330  9    forces may be able, in the opinion of the Government,
A41 1340 10    to meet fully their tasks **h".
A41 1350  2       Secretary-General Hammarskjo^ld decided that it
A41 1360  1    would be preferable if the U&N& troops sent into the
A41 1360 11    Congo were to come from African, or at least nonwhite,
A41 1370  9    nations- certainly not from the U&S&, Russia, Great
A41 1380  3    Britain or France. He quickly called on Ghana, Tunisia,
A41 1390  5    Morocco, Guinea and Mali, which dispatched troops within
A41 1400  3    hours. Ultimately the U&N& army in the Congo reached
A41 1410  2    a top strength of 19,000, including about 5,000 from
A41 1410 11    India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden, who
A41 1420 10    were the only whites.
A41 1430  1       It took the U&N& three months to bring a modest
A41 1430 11    form of order to the Congo. The Belgians were reluctant
A41 1440  9    to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U&N&
A41 1450  5    efforts. The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba
A41 1460  4    caused constant problems- he frequently announced that
A41 1470  2    he wanted the U&N& to get out of the Congo along with
A41 1480  1    the Belgians, and appealed to Russia for help. (However,
A41 1480 10    there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was
A41 1490  8    a Communist. Before appealing to the U&N& or to Russia,
A41 1500  7    he first appealed to the U&S& for military help, and
A41 1510  5    was rejected.) Lumumba further complicated the U&N&'s
A41 1520  3    mission by initiating small "wars" with the secessionist
A41 1530  2    province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under
A41 1540  1    Albert Kalonji, wanted to secede as well. Meanwhile
A41 1540  9    Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo,
A41 1550  7    sending Lumumba equipment for his "wars", dispatching
A41 1560  4    "technicians" and even threatening, on occasion, to
A41 1570  4    intervene openly.
A41 1570  6       But by the end of the three-month period, in October
A41 1580  4    1960, something approaching calm settled on the Congo.
A41 1590  3    President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba
A41 1590  9    and fired him. Lumumba fired Kasavubu. Control of the
A41 1600  9    government- such control as there was and such government
A41 1610  8    as there was- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu,
A41 1620  6    chief of staff of the Congolese army. Mobutu promptly
A41 1630  3    flung out the Russians, who have not since played any
A41 1640  1    significant part on the local scene, although they
A41 1640  9    have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U&N&
A41 1650  5    headquarters in New York. The Belgians- at least officially-
A41 1660  6    departed from the Congo as well, withdrawing all of
A41 1670  4    their uniformed troops. But they left behind them large
A41 1680  3    numbers of officers, variously called "volunteers"
A41 1680  9    or "mercenaries", who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe
A41 1690 10    in Katanga, the seceded province which, according to
A41 1700  7    Tshombe, holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire
A41 1710  7    country.
A41 1710  8       From October 1960 to February 1961, the U&N& forces
A41 1720  7    in the Congo took little action. There was no directive
A41 1730  5    for it- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned
A41 1740  4    political matters, and in any case the United Nations
A41 1750  2    by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the
A41 1750 13    political affairs of any nation, whether to unify it,
A41 1760  9    federalize it or Balkanize it.
A41 1770  2       During the five-month lull, civil war smoldered
A41 1770 10    and flickered throughout the Congo. In February the
A41 1780  8    murder of Patrice Lumumba, who had been kidnaped into
A41 1790  7    Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe, again stirred
A41 1800  4    the U&N& to action. On Feb& 21 the council passed another
A41 1810  4    resolution urging the taking of "all appropriate measures
A41 1820  2    to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo,
A41 1820 12    including **h the use of force, if necessary, in the
A41 1830 10    last resort". Although the resolution might have been
A41 1840  6    far more specific, it was considerably tougher than
A41 1850  3    the earlier one. It also urged that the U&N& eject,
A41 1860  2    and prevent the return of, all Belgian and other foreign
A41 1860 12    military and political advisers; ordered an investigation
A41 1870  7    of Lumumba's death; urged the reconvention of the Congolese
A41 1880  8    Parliament and the reorganization of the army.
A42 0010  1    #THE PRESIDENCY: TALKING AND LISTENING#
A42 0010  6    Though President John F& Kennedy was primarily concerned
A42 0020  6    with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament
A42 0030  3    adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev,
A42 0040  1    his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy
A42 0040  9    involved him in other key problems of U&S& foreign
A42 0050  9    policy last week.
A42 0060  1       High up on the President's priority list was the
A42 0060 10    thorny question of Bizerte. On this issue, the President
A42 0070  8    received a detailed report from his U&N& Ambassador
A42 0080  6    Adlai Stevenson, who had just returned from Paris,
A42 0090  4    and Mr& Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving
A42 0100  1    way- for both Paris and Tunis- out of the imbroglio.
A42 0110  1    Ideally, the President would like the French to agree
A42 0110 10    on a "status quo ante" on Bizerte, and accept a new
A42 0120  9    timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean
A42 0130  6    base. To continue their important conversations about
A42 0140  3    the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems,
A42 0150  3    Mr& Kennedy invited stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend.
A42 0170  1       The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock
A42 0170  8    with the No& 2 man in the Tunisian Government, Defense
A42 0180 10    Minister Bahi Ladgham, who flew to Washington last
A42 0190  7    week to seek U&S& support. The conversation apparently
A42 0200  4    convinced Mr& Kennedy that the positions of France
A42 0210  4    and Tunisia were not irreconcilable. Through Ladgham,
A42 0220  1    Mr& Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian
A42 0230  1    President Habib Bourguiba; and one U&S& official said:
A42 0230  9    "The key question now is which side picks up the phone
A42 0240 11    first".
A42 0250  1       On the Latin American front, the President held
A42 0250  9    talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon
A42 0260  6    before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American
A42 0270  5    Economic and Social Council (which the President himself
A42 0280  2    had originally hoped to attend). Main purpose of the
A42 0290  1    meeting: To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for
A42 0290  8    Progress.
A42 0300  1       And that was not all. In conferences with Nationalist
A42 0300 10    China's dapper, diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng,
A42 0310  7    Mr& Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that
A42 0320  7    the U&S& is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission
A42 0330  8    of Red China to the United Nations. Chen was equally
A42 0340  5    adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer
A42 0350  3    Mongolia; however the President, who would like to
A42 0350 11    woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking
A42 0360  9    and Moscow, would promise Chen nothing more than an
A42 0370  7    abstention by the U&S& if Outer Mongolia's admission
A42 0380  3    comes to a vote.
A42 0380  7       The President also conferred with emissaries from
A42 0390  6    Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid.
A42 0400  4    To Africa, he sent his most trusted adviser, his brother,
A42 0410  3    Attorney General Robert Kennedy, on a good-will mission
A42 0420  1    to the Ivory Coast. All week long the President clearly
A42 0420 11    was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs;
A42 0430  8    in effect, he was practicing what he preached in his
A42 0440  6    Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared: "We
A42 0450  2    shall always be prepared to discuss international problems
A42 0460  1    with any and all nations that are willing to talk,
A42 0460 11    and listen, with reason".
A42 0470  2    #CRIME: 'SKYJACKED'#
A42 0470  4    From International Airport in Los Angeles to International
A42 0480  6    Airport in Houston, as the great four-jet Boeing 707
A42 0490  6    flies, is a routine five hours and 25 minutes, including
A42 0500  2    stopovers at Phoenix, El Paso, and San Antonio. When
A42 0510  1    Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off
A42 0510  9    at 11:30 one night last week, there was no reason to
A42 0520  9    think it would take any longer.
A42 0530  1       The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a&m& in Phoenix.
A42 0540  1    Thirty-one minutes later, when it took off for El Paso,
A42 0540 12    hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers
A42 0550 12    paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who
A42 0560  9    had come aboard. At 3:58 a&m&, with the plane about
A42 0570  5    twenty minutes out of El Paso, passenger Robert Berry,
A42 0580  2    a San Antonio advertising man, glanced up and saw the
A42 0590  1    man and boy, accompanied by a stewardess, walking up
A42 0590 10    the aisle toward the cockpit. "The man was bent over
A42 0600  8    with his hand on his stomach", Berry said. "I figured
A42 0610  5    he was sick".
A42 0610  8       John Salvador, a farmer from Palm Desert, Calif&,
A42 0620  6    was sitting up front and could see through the door
A42 0630  5    as the trio entered the cockpit. "The kid had a .45
A42 0640  3    automatic, like they issue in the Army", he said. "The
A42 0640 13    other fellow had a .38". Salvador saw the youth hold
A42 0650 10    his .45 against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey;
A42 0660  6    the man put his .38 at the head of Capt& Byron D& Rickards.
A42 0670  6       To Rickards, a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the
A42 0680  6    air, it was an old story: His plane was being hijacked
A42 0690  3    in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930,
A42 0690 14    when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor
A42 0700 10    at Arequipa. But last week's pirates, like the Cuban-American
A42 0710  8    who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra (NEWSWEEK,
A42 0720  6    Aug& 7), wanted to go to Havana.
A42 0730  4    _STALLING:_
A42 0730  5       "Tell your company there are four of us here with
A42 0750  2    guns", the elder man told Rickards. The pilot radioed
A42 0760  1    El Paso International Airport with just that message.
A42 0760  9    But, he told the "skyjackers", the 707 didn't carry
A42 0770  8    enough fuel to reach Havana; they would have to refuel
A42 0780  7    at El Paso.
A42 0780 10       Most passengers didn't know what had happened until
A42 0790  7    they got on the ground. Jerry McCauley of Sacramento,
A42 0800  5    Calif&, one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board,
A42 0810  4    awoke from a nap in confusion. "The old man came from
A42 0820  3    the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers
A42 0830  1    to go to Cuba", McCauley said, "and like a nut I raised
A42 0830 13    my hand. I thought he was the Air Force recruiter".
A42 0840  9       What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer
A42 0850  7    as hostages, along with the crew. They chose four:
A42 0860  4    Jack Casey, who works for Continental Airlines in Houston;
A42 0870  3    Fred Mullen from Mercer Island, Wash&; Pfc& Truman
A42 0890  2    Cleveland of St& Augustine. Fla&, and Leonard Gilman,
A42 0900  1    a former college boxer and veteran of the U&S& Immigration
A42 0910  1    Service Border Patrol. Everybody else was allowed to
A42 0910  9    file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso
A42 0920  9    at 4:18 a&m&.
A42 0930  1       They found a large welcoming group- El Paso policemen,
A42 0930 10    Border Patrol, sheriff's deputies, and ~FBI men, who
A42 0940  7    surged around the plane with rifles and submarine guns.
A42 0950  7    Other ~FBI men, talking with the pilot from the tower,
A42 0960  6    conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to
A42 0970  3    Havana. The ground crew, which ordinarily fuels a 707
A42 0970 12    in twenty minutes, took fully three hours. Still more
A42 0980  8    time was consumed while the pilot, at the radioed suggestion
A42 0990  7    of Continental president Robert Six, tried to persuade
A42 1000  5    the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven
A42 1010  4    Douglas ~DC-7.
A42 1010  7       Actually, the officers on the ground had no intention
A42 1020  7    of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of
A42 1030  4    an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight
A42 1040  1    from President Kennedy, who thought at first, as did
A42 1040 10    most others, that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel
A42 1050  8    Castro who had taken over the 707. Mr& Kennedy had
A42 1060  6    been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal
A42 1070  4    the plane, kept in touch throughout by telephone. At
A42 1080  1    one time, while still under the impression that he
A42 1080 10    was dealing with a Cuban plot, the President talked
A42 1090  6    about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba.
A42 1100  4       As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas
A42 1110  1    sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains, police
A42 1110 10    got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage
A42 1120 10    compartment. From the luggage, they learned that the
A42 1130  6    two air pirates, far from being Cubans, were native
A42 1140  3    Americans, subsequently identified as Leon Bearden,
A42 1150  1    50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge, Ariz&, and his
A42 1150 11    son, Cody, 16, a high-school junior.
A42 1160  6    _TENSION_
A42 1160  7       The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens.
A42 1170  6    The father, by accident or perhaps to show, as he said,
A42 1180  4    "we mean business", took the .45 and fired a slug between
A42 1190  2    the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons. At 7:30
A42 1190 11    a&m&, more than three hours after landing, the Beardens
A42 1200  9    gave an ultimatum:
A42 1210  1       Take off or see the hostages killed.
A42 1210  8       The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a&m&,
A42 1220 10    and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway.
A42 1230  6       Several police cars, loaded with armed officers,
A42 1240  3    raced alongside, blazing away at the tires of the big
A42 1250  2    jet. The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one
A42 1250 11    of the inboard engines; the plane slowed to a halt.
A42 1260  8    Ambulances, baggage trucks, and cars surrounded it.
A42 1270  5       The day wore on. At 12:50 p&m& a ramp was rolled
A42 1280  5    up to the plane. A few minutes later, ~FBI agent Francis
A42 1290  2    Crosby, talking fast, eased up the ramp to the plane,
A42 1290 12    unarmed. While Crosby distracted the Beardens, stewardesses
A42 1300  7    Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door.
A42 1310 10    So did hostages Casey, Cleveland, and Mullen. That
A42 1320  5    left only the four crew members, Crosby, and Border
A42 1330  3    Patrolman Gilman, all unarmed, with the Beardens. The
A42 1340  2    elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand, the other
A42 1340 12    in a hip pocket. Gilman started talking to him until
A42 1350  7    he saw his chance. He caught officer Simmons' eye,
A42 1360  4    nodded toward young Bearden, and- "I swung my right
A42 1370  4    as hard as I could. Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy
A42 1380  1    and it was all over".
A42 1380  6       Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p&m&, the
A42 1390  3    Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges
A42 1400  1    of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across
A42 1400  9    state lines. (Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the
A42 1410  7    plane to Castro, and live high in Cuba.) Back home
A42 1420  5    in Coolidge, Ariz&, his 36-year-old wife, Mary, said:
A42 1430  3    "I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs".
A42 1440  2    #CONGRESS: MORE MUSCLE#
A42 1440  5    Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol
A42 1460  2    Hill last week was the military strength of the nation.
A42 1470  3    The Senate put other business aside as it moved with
A42 1470 13    unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0-
A42 1480  9    the largest peacetime defense budget in U&S& history.
A42 1490  6       With the money all but in hand, however, the Administration
A42 1500  7    indicated that, instead of the 225,000 more men in
A42 1510  6    uniform that President Kennedy had requested, the armed
A42 1520  3    forces would be increased by only 160,000. The "hold-back",
A42 1530  1    as Pentagon mutterers labeled it, apparently was a
A42 1530  9    temporary expedient intended to insure that the army
A42 1540  8    services are built up gradually and, thus, the new
A42 1550  5    funds spent prudently.
A42 1550  8       In all, the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion,
A42 1560  7    which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested
A42 1570  4    the week before by President Kennedy, but tacked on
A42 1580  3    $754 million more than the President had asked for.
A42 1580 12    (The Senate, on its own, decided to provide additional
A42 1590  9    ~B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic
A42 1600  7    Air Command.) The House, which had passed its smaller
A42 1610  5    appropriation before the President's urgent call for
A42 1620  3    more, was expected to go along with the increased defense
A42 1630  1    budget in short order.
A42 1630  5       In other areas, Congressional action last week included:
A42 1640  3       @ The Senate (by voice vote) and the House (by 224-170)
A42 1650  4    passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm
A42 1660  2    bill which the President is expected to sign, not too
A42 1660 12    unhappily.
A42 1670  1       @ The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance
A42 1670 10    the government's health, welfare, and labor activities.
A42 1680  6       Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill, with
A42 1700  3    its controversial long-range proposals, had just begun
A42 1710  4    on the Senate floor at the weekend. White House legislative
A42 1720  2    aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.
A42 1730  1    #FOOD: STEW A LA MULLIGATAWNY#
A42 1730  6    Most members of the U&S& Senate, because they are human,
A42 1740  5    like to eat as high on the hog as they can. But, because
A42 1750  4    they are politicians, they like to talk as poor-mouth
A42 1760  1    as the lowliest voter. As a result, ever since 1851
A42 1760 11    when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of
A42 1770  8    the Capitol Building, the senators have never ceased
A42 1780  4    to grumble about the food- even while they opposed
A42 1790  2    every move that might improve it.
A42 1790  8       Over the years, enlivened chiefly by disputes about
A42 1800  5    the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes, the
A42 1810  3    menu has pursued its drab all-American course. Individual
A42 1820  1    senators, with an eye to the voters back home, occasionally
A42 1820 11    introduced smelts from Michigan, soft-shell crabs from
A42 1830  8    Maryland, oysters from Washington, grapefruit from
A42 1840  5    Florida. But plain old bean soup, served daily since
A42 1860  2    the turn of the century (at the insistence of the late
A42 1870  2    Sen& Fred Dubois of Idaho), made clear to the citizenry
A42 1870 12    that the Senate's stomach was in the right place.
A42 1880  9       In a daring stroke, the Senate ventured forth last
A42 1890  7    week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year
A42 1900  8    French-born maitre d'hotel.
A43 0010  1       Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements
A43 0010  9    in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes.
A43 0020  7       Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems
A43 0030  7    clearly upward. Higher toll rates also are helping
A43 0040  4    boost revenues.
A43 0040  6       Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by
A43 0050  6    bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative.
A43 0060  1       Things are looking up these days for many of the
A43 0070  1    State turnpikes on which investors depend for income
A43 0070  9    from their toll-road bonds.
A43 0075  2       traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.
A43 0080  1    That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and
A43 0080 10    quarters at toll gates.
A43 0085  2       As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes, investors
A43 0090  1    who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked
A43 0090 10    as outright speculations are now finding new hope for
A43 0100  8    their investments.
A43 0105  1       Another result is that buyers are tending to bid
A43 0110  9    up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds.
A43 0120  4       Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments
A43 0130  2    hit a price peak on February 21, according to Standard
A43 0140  1    + Poor's average. On balance, prices of those bonds
A43 0140 10    have slipped a bit since then. However, in the same
A43 0150  9    three-month period, toll-road bonds, as a group, have
A43 0160  6    bucked this trend. On these bonds, price rises since
A43 0170  2    February 21 easily outnumber price declines.
A43 0170  8    #TAX-FREE RETURNS.#
A43 0180  1    Investors, however, still see an element of more-than-ordinary
A43 0190  1    risk in the toll-road bonds. You find the evidence
A43 0190 11    of that in the chart on this page.
A43 0200  5       Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at
A43 0210  2    prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of
A43 0210 12    4 per cent, or very close to that. And this is true
A43 0220 10    in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have
A43 0230  5    risen close to, or beyond, the point at which the roads
A43 0240  3    start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest
A43 0240 12    on the bonds.
A43 0250  3       That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to
A43 0250 14    be had on good corporation bonds. It's not much more,
A43 0260 10    in fact, than the return that is offered on U& S& Treasury
A43 0270 10    bonds.
A43 0270 11       For investors whose income is taxed at high rates,
A43 0280  9    though, a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high. It
A43 0290  8    is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor
A43 0300  2    with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed, or for
A43 0310  1    a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income.
A43 0310 11    #SWELLING TRAFFIC.#
A43 0320  2    A new report on the earnings records of toll roads
A43 0320 12    in the most recent 12-month period- ending in February
A43 0330  9    or March- shows what is happening. The report is based
A43 0340  8    on a survey by Blyth + Company, investment bankers.
A43 0350  3       Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues
A43 0360  3    during the period.
A43 0360  6       And there is the bright note: The gains were achieved
A43 0370  5    in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960
A43 0380  3    and early in 1961 as a result of business recession.
A43 0380 13    Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe
A43 0390 11    winter.
A43 0390 12       Indication: The long-term trend of turnpike traffic
A43 0400  8    is upward.
A43 0410  1       Look, for example, at the Ohio Turnpike. Traffic
A43 0410  8    on that road slumped sharply in January and February,
A43 0420  6    as compared with those same months in 1960. Then March
A43 0430  5    brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues- after
A43 0440  4    operating costs.
A43 0440  6       As a result, the road's net revenues in the 12 months
A43 0450  5    ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest
A43 0460  1    payments on the turnpike bonds. That was up from 173
A43 0460 11    per cent in the preceding 12 months.
A43 0470  6       That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts
A43 0480  5    Turnpike. Operating revenues were off in the first
A43 0490  3    three months of 1961, but up for the 12 months ending
A43 0490 14    in March. Costs were held down, despite a bitter winter.
A43 0500  9       For the year, the road earned 133 per cent of its
A43 0510 10    interest costs, against 121 per cent in the preceding
A43 0520  6    period. The road's engineers look for further improvement
A43 0530  2    when the turnpike is extended into Boston.
A43 0530  9    #SLOW SUCCESSES.#
A43 0540  1    Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long
A43 0540 10    enough to prove what they can do. The 187-mile Illinois
A43 0550 11    State Toll Highway, for example, was not opened over
A43 0560  7    its entire length until December, 1958. In the 12 months
A43 0570  5    ended in February, 1960, the highway earned enough
A43 0580  1    to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the
A43 0580 12    remainder paid out of initial reserves. In the 12 months
A43 0590  9    ended in February, 1961, this highway earned 93 per
A43 0600  6    cent of its interest.
A43 0600 10       That improvement is continuing. In the first two
A43 0610  7    months of 1961, earnings of the Illinois highway available
A43 0620  4    for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early
A43 0630  3    1960.
A43 0630  4       Success, for many turnpikes, has come hard. Traffic
A43 0640  2    frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy
A43 0640 11    estimates. In these cases, the turnpike managements
A43 0650  7    have had to turn to toll-rate increases, or to costly
A43 0660  7    improvements such as extensions or better connections
A43 0670  2    with other highways.
A43 0670  5       Many rate increases already have been put into effect.
A43 0680  6    Higher tolls are planned for July 1, 1961, on the
A43 0690  4    Richmond-Petersburg,
A43 0690  6    Va&, Turnpike, and proposals for increased tolls on
A43 0700  4    the Texas Turnpike are under study.
A43 0700 10    #EASIER ACCESS.#
A43 0710  2    Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists'
A43 0710 10    access to many turnpikes. The Kansas Turnpike offers
A43 0720  8    an illustration. Net earnings of that road rose from
A43 0730  8    62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957
A43 0740  4    to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb& 28, 1961.
A43 0750  2       Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike
A43 0760  1    are expected late in 1961, with the opening of a new
A43 0760 12    bypass at Wichita, and still later when the turnpike
A43 0770  7    gets downtown connections in both Kansas City, Kans&,
A43 0780  5    and Kansas City, Mo&. Meanwhile, there appears to be
A43 0790  4    enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the
A43 0800  2    interest deficiency for eight more years.
A43 0800  8    #FOR SOME ROADS, TROUBLES.#
A43 0810  1    Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities
A43 0810  9    find that not all roads are nearing their goals.
A43 0820  9       Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have
A43 0830  6    been a great disappointment to planners and investors
A43 0840  3    alike. If nothing is done, the prospect is that that
A43 0850  1    road will be in default of interest in 1962. West Virginia
A43 0850 12    toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months, and,
A43 0860  8    despite recent improvement in revenues, holders of
A43 0870  5    the bonds are faced with more of the same.
A43 0880  1       These, however, are exceptions. The typical picture
A43 0880  8    at this time is one of steady improvement.
A43 0890  7       It's going to take time for investors to learn how
A43 0900  6    many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full. Already,
A43 0910  3    however, several of the turnpikes are earning enough
A43 0920  1    to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins.
A43 0920  8    Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push
A43 0930  7    revenues up to the break-even point.
A43 0950  1    ##
A43 0950  2    @ A top American official, after a look at Europe's
A43 0960  1    factories, thinks the U&S& is in a "very serious situation"
A43 0970  1    competitively.
A43 0970  2       Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges, accompanied by
A43 0980  3    a member of our staff, on May 10 toured plants of two
A43 0990  2    of Italy's biggest companies- Fiat, the auto producer,
A43 1000  1    and Olivetti, maker of typewriters and calculating
A43 1000  8    machines.
A43 1010  1       Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows-
A43 1010  9       "Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant,
A43 1020  7    and you learn this:
A43 1030  1       "One, modern equipment- much of it supplied under
A43 1030  9    the Marshall Plan- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars
A43 1040 10    a day. About half of these are exported.
A43 1050  6       "Two, wage costs are a fraction of the U&S& costs.
A43 1060  5    A skilled worker on the assembly line, for example,
A43 1070  3    earns $37 a week.
A43 1070  7       "Three, labor troubles are infrequent. Fiat officials
A43 1080  5    say they have had no strikes for more than six years.
A43 1100  4       "Said Secretary Hodges: 'It's a tough combination
A43 1110  2    for the U&S& to face'.
A43 1110  7       "Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges. Olivetti
A43 1120  8    took over Underwood, the U&S& typewriter maker, in
A43 1130  6    late 1959. Within a year, without reducing wages, Underwood's
A43 1140  4    production costs were cut one third, prices were slashed.
A43 1150  4    The result has been that exports of Underwood products
A43 1160  2    have doubled.
A43 1160  4       "The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout,
A43 1170  3    modern machinery. The firm is design-conscious, sales-conscious,
A43 1180  3    advertising-conscious.
A43 1180  5       "Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to
A43 1200  7    go to the U&S&. The inflow of foreign capital would
A43 1210  5    help the U&S& balance of payments.
A43 1220  1       "Hodges predicted: 'I think we will see more foreign
A43 1220 10    firms coming to the U&S&. There are many places where
A43 1240  6    we can use their vigor and new ideas'".
A43 1250  5    ##
A43 1250  6    @ Foreign competition has become so severe in certain
A43 1260  6    textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling
A43 1270  4    competitive imports.
A43 1270  6       The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the
A43 1280  6    international textile market can be significant for
A43 1290  3    American businessmen in many lines.
A43 1290  8       Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are
A43 1300  8    these:
A43 1310  1       An international conference of the big textile-importing
A43 1310  8    and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly
A43 1320  6    by President Kennedy.
A43 1330  1       Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth
A43 1330  9    noting.
A43 1340  1       The U&S& will try to get agreement among the industrialized
A43 1350  1    countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed
A43 1360  1    countries over the years.
A43 1360  5       Point is that developing countries often build up
A43 1370  4    a textile industry first, need encouragement to get
A43 1380  2    on their feet. If they have trouble exporting, international
A43 1380 11    bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise
A43 1390 10    would.
A43 1400  1       Idea is to let these countries earn their way as
A43 1400 10    much as possible.
A43 1410  1    ##
A43 1410  2    @ At the same time, another purpose of the conference
A43 1420  1    will be to get certain low-wage countries to control
A43 1420 11    textile exports- especially dumping of specific products-
A43 1430  8    to high-wage textile-producing countries.
A43 1440  2       Japan, since 1957, has been "voluntarily" curbing
A43 1450  2    exports of textiles to the U&S&. Hong Kong, India and
A43 1460  3    Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types
A43 1470  1    of textiles to Britain for several years under the
A43 1470 10    "Lancashire Pact".
A43 1480  1       None of these countries is happy with these arrangements.
A43 1490  1       The Japanese want to increase exports to the U&S&
A43 1500  1    While they have been curbing shipments, they have watched
A43 1500 10    Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of
A43 1510  9    the big U&S& market.
A43 1520  1       Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their
A43 1520  8    exports to Britain, while Spanish and Portuguese textiles
A43 1530  8    pour into British market unrestrictedly.
A43 1540  4       The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar
A43 1550  5    restrictions on the British market for similar reasons.
A43 1560  3       The Kennedy hope is that, at the conference or through
A43 1570  3    bilateral talks, the low-wage textile-producing countries
A43 1580  1    in Asia and Europe will see that "dumping" practices
A43 1580 10    cause friction all around and may result in import
A43 1590  9    quotas.
A43 1590 10       Gradual, controlled expansion of the world's textile
A43 1600  7    trade is what President Kennedy wants. This may point
A43 1610  6    the way toward international stabilization agreements
A43 1620  2    in other products. It's an important clue to Washington
A43 1630  3    thinking.
A43 1630  4    ##
A43 1630  5    @ Note, too, that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward
A43 1640  5    modernization or shrinkage of the U&S& textile industry.
A43 1650  3       "Get competitive or get out". In veiled terms, that's
A43 1660  4    what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American
A43 1670  3    textile industry. The Government will help in transferring
A43 1680  2    companies and workers into new lines, where modernization
A43 1690  1    doesn't seem feasible. Special depreciation on new
A43 1690  8    textile machinery may be allowed. Government research
A43 1700  6    will look into new products and methods.
A43 1710  4       Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national
A43 1720  4    interest is involved.
A43 1720  7       But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import
A43 1730  4    quotas. Rather, they are impressed with the British
A43 1740  4    Government's success in forcing- and helping- the British
A43 1750  5    textile industry to shrink and to change over to other
A43 1760  2    products.
A43 1760  3       What's happening in textiles can be handwriting
A43 1770  1    on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing
A43 1770 10    with imports from low-wage countries.

A43 1780  7    @ Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U&S&
A43 1790  6    coal miners. Yet U&S& coal is cheap enough to make
A43 1800  5    foreign steelmakers' mouths water.
A43 1810  1       Steel Company of Wales, a British steelmaker, wants
A43 1810  8    to bring in Virginia coal, cut down on its takings
A43 1820  8    of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively-
A43 1830  6    especially in foreign markets.
A43 1840  1       Virginia coal, delivered by ship in Wales, will
A43 1840  9    be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered
A43 1850  9    by rail from nearby mines.
A43 1860  1       U&S& coal is cheap, despite high wages, because
A43 1870  1    of widespread mechanization of mines, wide coal seams,
A43 1870  9    attactive rates on ocean freight. Many of the coal
A43 1880  8    seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting,
A43 1890  4    narrow and very deep.
A43 1890  8       Productivity of U&S& miners is twice that of the
A43 1900  9    British.
A43 1900 10       Welsh coal miners, Communist-led, are up in arms
A43 1910  9    at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American
A43 1920  7    coal. They threaten to strike.
A43 1930  1       The British Government will have to decide whether
A43 1930  9    to let U&S& coal in. The British coal industry is unprofitable,
A43 1940 10    has large coal stocks it can't sell.
A44 0010  1       EVERY library borrower, or at least those whose
A44 0010  9    taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals, knows
A44 0020  8    what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically,
A44 0030  3    "I'm sorry, but we don't have that book. There wouldn't
A44 0040  4    be much demand for it, I'm afraid".
A44 0050  1       Behind this reply, and its many variations, is the
A44 0050 10    ever-present budget problem all libraries must face,
A44 0060  6    from the largest to the smallest. What to buy out of
A44 0070  6    the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles? What
A44 0080  2    to buy for adult and child readers, for lovers of fiction
A44 0080 13    and nonfiction, for a clientele whose wants are incredibly
A44 0090  9    diversified, when your budget is pitifully small? Most
A44 0100  7    library budgets are hopelessly inadequate. A startlingly
A44 0110  4    high percentage do not exceed $500 annually, which
A44 0120  2    includes the librarian's salary, and not even the New
A44 0130  1    York Public has enough money to meet its needs- this
A44 0130 11    in the world's richest city. The plight of a small
A44 0140  8    community library is proportionately worse.
A44 0150  2       Confronted with this situation, most libraries either
A44 0160  2    endure the severe limitations of their budgets and
A44 0160 10    do what they can with what they have, or else depend
A44 0170  9    on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement
A44 0180  5    their annual funds. In some parts of the country, however,
A44 0190  4    a co-operative movement has begun to grow, under the
A44 0200  2    wing of state governments, whereby, with the financial
A44 0200 10    help of the state, libraries share their book resources
A44 0210  7    on a county-wide or regional basis.
A44 0220  2       New York State has what is probably the most advanced
A44 0230  1    of these co-operative systems, so well developed that
A44 0230 10    it has become a model for others to follow. Because
A44 0240  8    it is so large a state, with marked contrasts in population
A44 0250  5    density, the organization of the New York co-operative
A44 0260  4    offers a cross-section of how the plan works. At one
A44 0270  2    extreme are the systems of upper New York State, where
A44 0270 12    libraries in two or more counties combine to serve
A44 0280  9    a large, sparsely populated area. At the other are
A44 0290  6    organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library
A44 0300  1    System, in a high-density area, with ample resources
A44 0300 10    and a rapidly growing territory to serve.
A44 0310  5       Both these types, and those in between, are in existence
A44 0320  6    by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that
A44 0330  2    began at Albany as early as 1950, with the creation
A44 0330 12    by the legislature of county library systems financed
A44 0340  7    by county governments with matching funds from the
A44 0350  6    state. It was a step in the right direction, but it
A44 0360  3    took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish
A44 0360 12    fully the thriving systems of today.
A44 0370  6       Under this law annual grants are given to systems
A44 0380  4    in substantial amounts. An earlier difficulty was overcome
A44 0390  2    by making it clear that individual libraries in any
A44 0390 11    area might join or not, as they saw fit. Some library
A44 0400 10    boards are wary of the plan. A large, well-stocked
A44 0410  6    library, surrounded in a county by smaller ones, may
A44 0420  3    feel that the demands on its resources are likely to
A44 0420 13    be too great. A small library may cherish its independence
A44 0430  9    and established ways, and resist joining in a cooperative
A44 0440  8    movement that sometimes seems radical to older members
A44 0450  5    of the board.
A44 0450  8       Within a system, however, the autonomy of each member
A44 0460  6    library is preserved. The local community maintains
A44 0470  2    responsibility for the financial support of its own
A44 0470 10    library program, facilities, and services, but wider
A44 0480  7    resources and additional services become available
A44 0490  4    through membership in a system. All services are given
A44 0500  4    without cost to members. So obvious are these advantages
A44 0510  1    that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York
A44 0510 12    State now has access to a system, and enthusiastic
A44 0520  9    librarians foresee the day, not too distant, when all
A44 0530  6    the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op.
A44 0540  4    ##
A44 0540  5    TO SET up a co-operative library system, the law requires
A44 0550  2    a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes
A44 0550 10    as the nucleus, and the system is organized around
A44 0560  9    it. The collection may be in an existing library, or
A44 0570  7    it may be built up in a central collection. Each system
A44 0580  3    develops differently, according to the area it serves,
A44 0590  1    but the universal goal is to pool the resources of
A44 0590 11    a given area for maximum efficiency. The basic state
A44 0600  6    grant is thirty cents for each person served, and there
A44 0610  5    is a further book incentive grant that provides an
A44 0620  2    extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita, if
A44 0620 12    a library spends a certain number of dollars.
A44 0630  6       In Nassau County, for example, the heavily settled
A44 0640  4    Long Island suburb of New York City, the system is
A44 0650  3    credited by the state with serving one million persons,
A44 0650 12    a figure that has doubled since 1950. This system,
A44 0660  8    by virtue of its variety and size, offers an inclusive
A44 0670  6    view of the plan in operation.
A44 0680  1       The Nassau system recognizes that its major task
A44 0680  9    it to broaden reference service, what with the constant
A44 0690  6    expansion of education and knowledge, and the pressure
A44 0700  4    of population growth in a metropolitan area. The need
A44 0710  2    is for reference works of a more specialized nature
A44 0710 11    than individual libraries, adequate to satisfy everyday
A44 0720  6    needs, could afford. Nassau is currently building a
A44 0730  5    central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead
A44 0740  4    headquarters, which will reach its goal of 100,000
A44 0750  1    volumes by 1965.
A44 0750  4       The major part of this collection is in the central
A44 0760  2    headquarters building, and the remainder is divided
A44 0760  9    among five libraries in the system designated as subject
A44 0770  8    centers. Basic reference tools are the backbone of
A44 0790  6    the collection, but there is also specialization in
A44 0800  2    science and technology, an indicated weakness in local
A44 0800 10    libraries. On microfilm, headquarters also has a file
A44 0810  8    of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to
A44 0820  8    the present day, as well as bound volumes of important
A44 0830  4    periodicals. The entire headquarters collection is
A44 0840  2    available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary
A44 0840 11    loans.
A44 0850  1       Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day.
A44 0850  8    It is connected by teletype with the State Library
A44 0860  7    in Albany, which will supply any book to a system that
A44 0870  6    the system itself cannot provide. The books are carried
A44 0880  2    around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to
A44 0880 11    the other libraries.
A44 0890  2       Each subject center library was chosen because of
A44 0900  2    its demonstrated strength in a particular area, which
A44 0900 10    headquarters could then build upon. East Meadow has
A44 0910  8    philosophy, psychology, and religion; Freeport houses
A44 0920  4    social science, pure science, and language; history,
A44 0930  2    biography, and education are centered in Hempstead;
A44 0930  9    Levittown has applied science, business, and literature;
A44 0940  7    while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art, music,
A44 0950  7    and foreign languages. The reference coordinator at
A44 0960  5    headquarters also serves as a consultant, and is available
A44 0970  4    to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen
A44 0980  1    local reference service.
A44 0980  4       This kind of cooperation is not wholly new, of course.
A44 0990  5    Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending
A44 1000  2    books to each other by mail for a quarter-century,
A44 1000 12    but the system enables this process to operate on an
A44 1010  8    organized and far more comprehensive basis. Local libraries
A44 1020  4    find, too, that the new plan saves tax dollars because
A44 1030  4    books can be bought through the system, and since the
A44 1040  2    system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts
A44 1040 13    than would be available to an individual library. The
A44 1050  8    system passes on these savings to its members. Further
A44 1060  6    money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical
A44 1070  3    detail as the result of central billing.
A44 1080  1       Books are not the only resource of the system. Schools
A44 1080 11    and community groups turn to the headquarters film
A44 1090  7    library for documentary, art, and experimental films
A44 1100  4    to show at libraries that sponsor local programs, and
A44 1110  2    to organizations in member communities. The most recent
A44 1110 10    film catalogue, available at each library, lists 110
A44 1120  8    titles presently in the collection, any of which may
A44 1130  6    be borrowed without charge. This catalogue lists separately
A44 1140  3    films suitable for children, young adults, or adults,
A44 1150  1    although some classics cut across age groups, such
A44 1150  9    as "Nanook of the North", "The Emperor's Nightingale",
A44 1160  7    and "The Red Balloon". Workshops are conducted by the
A44 1170  8    system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of
A44 1180  6    member libraries, teaching them the effective use of
A44 1190  3    film as a library service.
A44 1190  8       The system well understands that one of its primary
A44 1200  6    responsibilities is to bring children and books together;
A44 1210  4    consequently an experienced children's librarian at
A44 1220  2    headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to
A44 1220  9    promote well-planned library activities, cooperating
A44 1230  4    with the children's librarians in member libraries
A44 1240  4    by means of individual conferences, workshops, and
A44 1250  2    frequent visits. Headquarters has also set up a central
A44 1250 11    juvenile book-review and book-selection center, to
A44 1260  8    provide better methods of purchasing and selection.
A44 1270  4    Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters,
A44 1280  3    where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or
A44 1280 11    in workshop groups. Story hours, pre-school programs,
A44 1290  8    activities with community agencies, and lists of recommended
A44 1300  7    reading are all in the province of the children's consultant.
A44 1310  5       Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly
A44 1320  5    busy place these days, threatening to expand beyond
A44 1330  2    its boundaries. In addition to the interlibrary loan
A44 1330 10    service and the children's program, headquarters has
A44 1340  7    a public relations director who seeks to get wider
A44 1350  7    grassroots support for quality library service in the
A44 1360  4    county; it prepares cooperative displays (posters,
A44 1370  1    booklists, brochures, and other promotional material)
A44 1370  7    for use in mber libraries; it maintains a central
A44 1380  6    exhibi/t collection to share displays already created
A44 1390  3    and used; and it publishes Sum and Substance, a monthly
A44 1400  3    newsletter, which reports the system's activities to
A44 1410  1    the staffs and trustees of member libraries. The system
A44 1410 10    itself is governed by a board of trustees, geographically
A44 1420  7    representing its membership.
A44 1430  1       In Nassau, as in other systems, the long-range objective
A44 1440  1    is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear
A44 1440 11    on the schools, and on adult education in general.
A44 1450  6    Librarians, a patient breed of men and women who have
A44 1460  5    borne much with dedication, can begin to see results
A44 1470  1    today. Library use is multiplying daily, and the bulk
A44 1470 10    of the newcomers are those maligned Americans, the
A44 1480  6    teen-agers. To them especially the librarians, with
A44 1490  4    the help of co-ops, hope they will never have to say,
A44 1500  2    "I'm sorry, we don't have that book".
A44 1510  1       TODAY, more than ever before, the survival of our
A44 1510 10    free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed
A44 1520  9    and concerned. The great advances made in recent years
A44 1530  7    in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy
A44 1540  5    require an educated citizenry in the Western world.
A44 1550  2    The need for lifetime reading is apparent. Education
A44 1550 10    must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing
A44 1560 11    process through our entire lives, for it is only through
A44 1570  8    knowledge that we, as a nation, can cope with the dangers
A44 1580  6    that threaten our society.
A44 1580 10       The desire and ability to read are important aspects
A44 1590  8    of our cultural life. We cannot consider ourselves
A44 1600  4    educated if we do not read; if we are not discriminating
A44 1610  2    in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we
A44 1620  1    do read. We must not permit our society to become a
A44 1620 12    slave to the scientific age, as might well happen without
A44 1630  7    the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from
A44 1640  4    the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed
A44 1650  2    from the written word.
A44 1650  6       A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today
A44 1660  5    is the book found in our libraries. Although progress
A44 1670  2    has been made in America's system of libraries it still
A44 1680  1    falls short of what is required if we are to maintain
A44 1680 12    the standards that are needed for an informed America.
A44 1690  7    The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge,
A44 1700  6    and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the
A44 1710  3    written word, continue to expand. The inadequacy of
A44 1710 11    our library system will become critical unless we act
A44 1720  9    vigorously to correct this condition. There are, for
A44 1730  6    example, approximately 25,000,000 people in this country
A44 1740  5    with no public library service and about 50,000,000
A44 1750  1    with inadequate service. In college libraries, 57 per
A44 1750  9    cent of the total number of books are owned by 124
A44 1760  9    of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U&S&
A44 1770  6    Office of Education. And over 66 per cent of the elementary
A44 1780  5    schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library
A44 1790  2    at all.
A44 1790  4    ##
A44 1790  5    IN every aspect of service- to the public, to children
A44 1800  3    in schools, to colleges and universities- the library
A44 1810  1    of today is failing to render vitally needed services.
A44 1810 10    Only public understanding and support can provide that
A44 1820  7    service.
A44 1820  8       This is one of the main reasons for National Library
A44 1830  9    Week, April 16-22, and for its theme: "For a richer,
A44 1840  7    fuller life, read"!
