<W1B-025 Tribunal letters><I><W1B-025$A><h> 26th Nov 1991 </h><p> <#> Dear Sir, </p> <h> <bold> <#> Re: County Draft Development Plan 1991 - 72 acres approx. Beverton, Donabate for "Bovale Developments Limited" </bold> </h><p> <#> On behalf of my clients, I wish to made representations and list these below in support for changing the zoning of these lands to residential use. </p><p> <#> I enclose a location map showing the lands edged red and further small scale plan showing how a pedestrian link could be planned to accommodate a short safe way to the school and shops. </p><p> <#> Also enclosed is a layout plan showing a suggested layout for a housing development of 510 houses and incorporating a leisure centre. </p><p> <#> There is an existing golf course to the north of this site and a new one to be built to the western boundary of the site known as Turvey House, these form natural boundaries for development. <#> The site is also close to the centre of village and on the eastern side of the railway which means vehicles leaving this site quickly connect to the Belfast/Dublin Road without passing through the centre of the village. </p><p> <#> These lands are immediately adjacent to the Kinane Development lands and any service road or footpath connections could be provided. </p><p> <#> Bovale Developments Limited have built many houses in the Swords area and the only available lands now left for development are in a few hands, my clients therefore see this site in Donabate as a well located site for development which has the advantage of a good rail service for people working in Dublin and good roads for travelling to Dublin and the Airport. </p><p> <#> The site is located within easy reach of the village school and shops and has the advantage of the local amenities such as beaches and Newbridge House and grounds. </p><p> <#> Should this site be rezoned for residential development, my clients would be willing to phase the development in order that integration with the local community and services could take place at a reasonable pace. </p><p> <#> There is a 12 <*> inch sign </*> diameter public foul sewer in adjoining lands and surface water could be discharged through water courses to the tidal outfall to the north of this site. </p><p> <#> It is, therefore, our contention that the above lands are well located and adjacent to the existing village with its amenities and would form a logical extension to same and would enhance the area with a good choice of house designs together with a new leisure centre which would be available for use by all the residents of the area. </p><p> <#> We therefore urge your Council to give careful consideration to these lands and rezone them for residential use. </p></I><I><W1B-025$A><p> <#> Dear Sir </p> <h> <#> Re: Draft Development Plan 1991 - 4 hectares of lands at Lime Tree Avenue, Portmarnock - "Bovale Developments Limited" </h><p> <#> On behalf of my clients Messrs. Bovale Developments Limited, I wish your Council to review and change the zoning on the above lands to residential use. </p><p> <#> I enclose a plan showing the location of the lands on Ordnance Survey Sheet and a further map showing its relationship to existing residential development to the south and church and school on the eastern boundary. </p><p> <#> Since the lands referred to are not a viable proposition for agricultural use due to the close proximity of the high density housing and school, we would urge your Council to reconsider the zoning for residential development for affordable houses for first time purchasers. </p><p> <#> This market is not being satisfactorily catered for this locality. </p><#> Yours faithfully<#> Alan S.

Hon. Mr. Justice Seamus Henchy, <#> Chairman, <#> The Independent Radio and Television Commission, <#> Marine House, <#> Clanwilliam Court, <#> Dublin, 2. </h><h> <#> 17th February, 1989. </h><h> <#> OB/JS/ra. </h><#> Dear Chairman, <p> <#> We wish to advise you that at a Board Meeting of Century Communications Limited held on Tuesday 14th February, Laurence Crowley was co-opted to the Board of Directors and elected Chairman, Terry Wogan and Chris de Burgh were also co-opted to the Board of Directors. <#> In due course the new directors will be participating in up to 12 1/2 <*> per cent sign </*> of the company 's equity. <#> This information remains confidential until 17.00 hrs Monday 20 February when it will be released to the Press. </p><p> <#> The Board Meeting reviewed the question of transmission charges. <#> They were of the unanimous opinion that the <*> pound sign </*> 375,000 offered to RTE for full transmission service was, given the advice that they had from the IBA, fair and reasonable. <#> Furthermore, they were of the unanimous view that they were not prepared to negotiate or increase that offer as it would effect the viability of the service. <#> They expressed their concern that RTE, as custodian of the National transmission network, had an obvious conflict of interest with their role as providers of transmission services to the independent broadcasters and that in the circumstances they could not understand why, given that the Minister has power under the Act, a directive has not been given to RTE. </p><p> <#> At the public hearing on 12th January 1989, we stated that we could provide the service within 90 days of the signing of contracts. <#> At that time there was 108 days to the 1st May. <#> When the award was made on 18th January, there were 102 days left. <#> We received the Broadcast Contract on 9th February and would hope to be able to agree the terms of that contract by the end of next week. <#> As of today, there are 72 days left to the 1st May and we are particularly concerned that the issue of the transmission charges has not been resolved and that there appears to be no way in which it is going to be resolved to meet that date. <#> We are prepared to meet all the extra studio installation costs associated with a shorter deadline and be on air 1st May but we are particularly concerned that there appears to be no urgency to resolve the issue on transmission. </p><p> <#> At this stage we must advise you that unless the matter is resolved within the next seven days there is no way in which we can be expected to meet the original date envisaged and furthermore we will have to reconsider our entire position. </p><p> <#> Such is the urgency of this matter that we remain available to meet with you at any time to suit your convenience. </p><#> Yours sincerely, <#> Oliver Barry <#> James Stafford<#> DIRECTORS: OLIVER BARRY, JAMES JOSEPH STAFFORD</I><I><W1B-025$E><h> <#> 15 February 1989 </h> <h> <#> Mr. Ray Burke, T. D. <#> Minister for Communications <#> Department of Industry <*> ampersand </*> Commerce <#> Kildare Street <#> Dublin 2 </h><h> <#> BY FAX. To 760431 </h><#> Dear Minister <p> <#> I refer to our discussions on 14 February 1989 in connection with points put to you by the IRTC in relation to charges proposed by us for the provision of various transmission services for Century Communications Ltd. </p><p> <#> The Commission referred to various levels of charge by the IBA in the UK. <#> It is our strongly held view that comparison between such charges and our proposals are invalid for a number of reasons e.g. area covered, accessibility of sites, costs of equipment (lower VAT rates in UK), Irish Pound/Sterling exchange differentials etc. </p><p> <#> We have, however, as requested, reviewed very fully again our charges. <#> In relation to the final annual charge of <*> pound sign </*> 692,000 quoted, there are two areas we have specially examined. <#> A full maintenance service is included in this figure for <*> pound sign </*> 364,000. <#> We expect to achieve worthwhile reductions in labour costs in this area over the next two years and are prepared now to anticipate this and pass the benefit on immediately in our proposed charges. <#> This will give a reduction of <*> pound sign </*> 44,000 in the <*> pound sign </*> 364,000 figure. </p><p> <#> We have also considered the overheads allocation previously shown at 10 <*> per cent sign </*>. <#> Because of the specialist nature of the services to be provided, we can accept that it would be more appropriate to charge only a proportion of that figure viz. 5 <*> per cent sign </*>. </p><p> <#> Taking these two provisions into account will reduce our earlier figure of <*> pound sign </*> 692,000 down to <*> pound sign </*> 614,000 per annum. <#> Depending on actual physical implementation of the project, we would expect a build up to this final figure in the following approximate manner (all at October 1988 prices):<p> <#> 1989 <*> pound sign </*> 200,000 <#> 1990 <*> pound sign </*> 430,000 <#> 1991 <*> pound sign </*> 530,000 <#> 1992 <*> pound sign </*> 614,000</p><p> <#> On a final point of detail, I can confirm that in all our figures there are no accelerated rates of depreciation used. <#> Our computations provide for rates used in our audited accounts - accepted industry norms. </p><p> <#> I trust the foregoing additional information will enable us very quickly now to conclude all outstanding matters with the Commission or Century Communications, as appropriate. <#> We are very conscious that it is now just ten weeks to 1st May next - a date which RTE would be just as concerned to achieve as all the other interested parties. </p><p><#> Yours sincerely<#> Vincent Finn </p></I><I><W1B-025$F><h> <#> 6 February 1989 </h> <h> <#> Mr Ray Burke TD <#> Minister for Communications </h><p> <#> Dear Minister <#> I enclose copies of documentation in connection with the charges being sought by RTE for providing transmission services to Century Communications for the independent national radio station. </p><p> <#> The matter is now extremely urgent as contracts for the provision of the new transmission equipment must be signed in the next few days if the new station is to make the proposed start-up date of May 1st. <#> In the circumstances I would appreciate your urgent observations/decision on the charges being sought. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely<#> Sean Connolly<#> Secretary </p></I>
