<#> Say hello. <#> Well, I 'm coming up to the end of the second term on the course <*> ampersand </*> I 'm exhausted. <#> I 'm really glad I did it, but <}> <-> theres </-> <+> there 's </+> </}> been no room for anything else. <#> Today I literally came up for air and have been thinking thinking thinking like bloody Spancil Hill, in fact. <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Brdiget (Kirwan)? <#> Give her my best. <#> I hope all is well with her? <#> and Desmond. <#> I haven't seen very much of Suzi; <}> <-> shes </-> <+> she 's </+> </}> fighting the usual fights the 40's are not a pretty sight/time/state/etc. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Maire? <#> She 's lovely Jen, I hope she is happy. <#> <}> <-> Shes </-> <+> She 's </+> </}> like one of my own, for obvious reasons. <#> How 's the baby. <#> Bob went home for a few days with his friend close the gate, as we call him. <#> (Gath is the chap 's name). <#> He 's huge big guy from Jordan. <#> Big, like an old fashioned Garda Siochana. <#> He cracks his head <*> ampersand </*> has had more stitches on his head than you can believe. <#> Bob wanted to see Se&/an, he likes Kevin, but he got involved with the hooha <*> ampersand </*> didn't know where to go. <#> <}> <-> Hes </-> <+> He 's </+> </}> ok in London <*> ampersand </*> is fairly street wise here, no mean feat. <#> It takes courage to take on London. <#> You think Dublin is a hoor of a city! </p><p> <#> I don't think I 'll be going to college next year, although I 'll try, for the challenge. <#> I always run away from interviews <*> ampersand </*> forms etc. <#> The give me the horrors <*> ampersand </*> insomnia. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Abbey? <#> <}> <-> Shes </-> <+> She 's </+> </}> very like Dan at the same time <}> <-> theres </-> <+> there 's </+> </}> a bit of her reminds me of Robin especially when she starts to smile. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Freds </-> <+> Fred 's </+> </}> applying for jobs overseas as <}> <-> theres </-> <+> there 's </+> </}> no permanent jobs here, at all. <#> The cold wind of cut-backs is howling into all the hospitals <*> ampersand </*> <}> <-> universitys </-> <+> universities </+> </}> <*> ampersand </*> they are cutting grants. <#> London is great if you are studying or learning, but otherwise it would be very hard to stay here. <#> I don't fancy being a cranky old bag with me shopping trolley here. <#> Bob is the only one at home now <*> ampersand </*> <}> <-> hes </-> <+> he 's </+> </}> off to college next autumn. <#> So, if a job comes up next year we will probably take it. <#> At least I can't really hang around waiting for Godot! <#> I suppose I 'm very arrogant really I won't accept people or situations telling me this far I can go and no further. <#> However sometimes I wish I was half thick <*> ampersand </*> didn't give a shit. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Timmy are things any better? <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> very worrying when you can't do anything about what you see. </p><p> <#> I 'm trying to grow out of the last stage. <#> I 've had to look at myself rather closely having gone back to painting, it was always a place that made me look inwards once a convent school girl always one! <#> However if you find a lot of shit on your door step, <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> impossible to pretend <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> not there. </p><p> <#> One positive thing I 've lost a stone weight since I saw you last. </p><p> <#> I hope to come over for a long weekend in the next few weeks but I don't know when. <#> If I do I will give you a ring. <#> Give my love to all the kids (adults now! <#> I hate clocks) <#> I often think of you and have talks with you - I 'm remembering your Aunt with the sweeping brush. </p><p><#> Love <#> Eileen xxx </p></I><I><W1B-015$A><#> 19th April '94<p> <#> Dear Jen, <#> Just thought I would drop you a line to say hello. <#> How are you keeping? <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Dan and Abbey? <#> Thanks for the phone call <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> always like a bombshell from another dimension! </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> a lovely day here and I seem to have landed in the kitchen at the table, with the house empty after a year of activity. <#> Things always come to an end. <#> I 'm waiting for an interview in two weeks time for Wimbledon, I 'm going to become a middleaged Womble. <#> If not I 'll get a job (if any!) <*> ampersand </*> paint. <#> In some ways I 'd rather do that anyhow. </p><p> <#> When are you coming over to London? <#> I might try and get to Dublin over the next 2 months. <#> I went out to ring Suzy, <}> <-> shes </-> <+> she 's </+> </}> in a bit of a down phase at the moment. <#> She said her sister was coming over today to see her. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Nora? <#> And <}> <-> hows </-> <+> how 's </+> </}> Bridget? <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Maire and the baby? <#> Give her my love. <#> Tommy often speaks of her. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Hes </-> <+> He 's </+> </}> back at school on Monday. <#> This will be his last term at school! <#> The end of an era! <#> <}> <-> Hes </-> <+> He 's </+> </}> either getting a job in London for the summer or going over to Ronan to work in Dublin. <#> <}> <-> Hes </-> <+> He 's </+> </}> into music <*> ampersand </*> needs money for lessons. </p><p> <#> The winter has only ended this week. <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> been very cold and wet. <#> I went over to Paris for a week with Fred and stayed in Nora 's room while she was over here, gas lot my family. <#> We walked everywhere <*> ampersand </*> visited the Louvre etc. <#> It was very cold <*> ampersand </*> rained incessantly there was a transport strike on also although it didn't affect us at all. <#> It was nice to get out of London for a bit. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Hows </-> <+> How 's </+> </}> Robin <*> ampersand </*> Timmy? <#> Did you decide to do some more about the calligraphy? </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Noras </-> <+> Nora 's </+> </}> flat is in the Jewish quarter over a synagogue. <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> really safe there. <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> medieval Paris. <#> I love it there, nobody bothers anybody, she says she loves it. <#> It was very emotional walking into her empty room. <#> All the bits <*> ampersand </*> pieces; I felt like a voyeur! <#> Strange conflict of emotions. </p><p> <#> How 's Dan? <#> Say hello. <#> I hope you 'll come <*> ampersand </*> see us when you 're over, if you can that is. <#> Life is never convenient, is it. </p><p> <#> Angela is in Spain. <#> I 've just written to her. <#> Ronan is thinking of going to Canada, a family of wanderers, I have. </p><p> <#> Are you reading anything interesting? <#> I owe the library (plural) a fortune in late return fines. <#> They are mainly art books <*> ampersand </*> seem to be impossible to finish. </p><p> <#> Well. <#> I will stop now Jen, I hope to see you soon there or here. <#> Keep in touch. </p><p> <#> Love <#> Eileen xx </p></I><I><W1B-015$A><#> Saturday<p> <#> Dear Jen, <#> Thanks for your letter. <#> It was a welcome event here in London! <#> It 's Saturday afternoon and the weather has changed for the better.</p><p> <#> I hope you are OK? <#> and that your mind is at rest about your lump. <#> I understand <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> to your advantage that you fed all the babies yourself. <#> Let 's know, <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> indeed a real thing to worry about. <#> So don't be too hard on yourself. </p><p> <#> I 'm not a very exciting letter writer. <#> I have to get into the 'flow' hence miles of verbiage.! </p><p> <#> How 's Jane Kelly? <#> tell her I said hello. <#> I 'm coming to the end of my book - I 've been reading it for nearly a year <*> ampersand </*> I will miss it when I 'm finished it. <#> I hate finishing books, my routine changes. </p><p> <#> I 've been cleaning the flat since I got back! <#> But I have quite enjoyed it, strange as it may seem. <#> I 'm also back at work in my office block, 5-7pm every evening. <#> Unfortunately my left hand/working hand is very painful. <#> I 'm afraid of losing the use of my hands! </p><p> <#> I miss Wednesdays <*> ampersand </*> Fridays! <#> However, for some reason you <*> ampersand </*> Dublin don't seem so far away any more! <#> <*> ampersand </*> I don't feel so isolated as I did before last year! <#> Since when is our perception of distance a state of mind! <#> London is a stressful place, but I don't seem to have the awful fears any more! <#> I immediately spot <*> ampersand </*> secure! <#> Zap! </p><p> <#> Fred is glad I 'm back, I think , he was feeling lonely <*> ampersand </*> depressed. <#> Nora is coming around tomorrow, she now has the chest infection <*> ampersand </*> Fred has just recovered from it. <#> I think <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> pollution <*> ampersand </*> people knocking half the street down with the resulting shite landing on us! </p><p> <#> Angela is working away <*> ampersand </*> got us two tickets to a concert, where she works - a blues player <*> ampersand </*> band called Buddy Guy. <#> She 's fine <*> ampersand </*> seems more happy in herself, although she 'd ate the arse off you in the most mercurial way for the most unlikely <*> ampersand </*> bizarre reasons - like I can't describe! <#> She 's all right though <*> ampersand </*> we have a few laughs sometimes. </p><p> <#> Ronan rings up the odd time <*> ampersand </*> seems ok. <#> He says the new job is probably going to be a sweet-shop, but it might be good for him. <#> Everything seems to be ok in Clonskeagh, so much for the "control factor/freak"! </p><p> <#> I 've just woken up from a glass of wine induced snooze I can't drink any more either. <#> I 'm glad you 're getting more friendly with Riona. <#> I rather liked her too. <#> Did she mention M&/air&/in Gallagher (how do you spell her name?) </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Whats </-> <+> What 's </+> </{> the news with Timmy 's school? <#> I hope Rathmines fares out better. <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> gas, fucking gas, I should say - schools everywhere, bursting with professional educators, bursting to educate <*> ampersand </*> a little young fellow in 'need' of a big, finds nought but a <ul> drought! </ul> <#> Rathmines, Angela says, was very nice <*> ampersand </*> she much preferred it to everywhere else she went. <#> It cost me a mild fortune to find that out! </p><p> <#> Are the lassies still not speaking? <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> strange how the world sees our babies; mutually so, I might add, as adults. <#> <}> <-> Thats </-> <+> That 's </+> </{> not a very good sentence. <#> I hope you know what I mean <*> ampersand </*> do I have to add fear of illiteracy to my list (I ask myself fearfully) of fears! </p><p> <#> Tommy has just finished his exams and is exhausted, has gone out to meet his friends and get drunk. <#> <}> <-> Hes </-> <+> He 's </+> </}> , fortunately, got a job for the summer, in <}> <-> Freds </-> <+> Fred 's </+> </}> hospital on the computers. <#> I 'm so glad, as he will be busy <*> ampersand </*> not too broke! </p><p> <#> I think I will stop now as I need some tea, pause! xx </p><p> <#> Hello there old friend! <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> Monday morning <*> ampersand </*> I 'm preparing to face going into college on Thursday, to work in the final <}> <-> years </-> <+> years ' </+> </}> show. <#> The nerves; the nerves! <#> I have done it before! <#> I rang <*> ampersand </*> organized it! <#> I 'm a <}> <-> practicing </-> <+> practising </+> </}> painter! -3 secure thoughts. <#> Well <}> <-> thats </-> <+> that 's </+> </}> that for the moment. </p><p> <#> Nora came around yesterday she 's ill <*> ampersand </*> we had such a nice time. <#> Her <*> ampersand </*> her chaps are grating off each other at the moment. <#> Following your advice I nod knowingly <*> ampersand </*> say nothing, just look encouraging. <#> Since I haven't a clue anyhow, <}> <-> theres </-> <+> there 's </+> </}> shag all else I can do anyhow. <#> I 've kind of distanced myself from them in the sense of the total responsibility in favour of respecting not only their independence but also my own <*> ampersand </*> I don't feel guilt ridden! <#> Hurray! </p><p> <#> I hope <}> <-> Dans </-> <+> Dan 's </+> </}> well and Marymount is not eating him alive, all jobs are alive <*> ampersand </*> hungry! </p><p> <#> Give Abbey a kiss for me. <#> I miss her stories - including the <}> <-> eponymus </-> <+> eponymous </+> </}> (<#> nice word, what does it mean? <#> Ask her <*> ampersand </*> is it spelt right?) slugs. <#> My small dictionary (from 2 year school) has Epoch, Epode - <quote> "the third <*> ampersand </*> last part of an ode" </quote> then Equable! <#> So I don't know. </p><p> <#> > How are the little <}> <-> ones </-> <+> ones ' </+> </}> ears noses <*> ampersand </*> tonsils - all the little pink <*> ampersand </*> vulnerable parts we mind <*> ampersand </*> worry <*> ampersand </*> cure. <#> Give my love to the girls. </p><p> <#> I haven't finished my book. <#> I walked back to Nottinghill with Nora and Fred last night <*> ampersand </*> had a cup of tea <*> ampersand </*> had a chat <*> ampersand </*> then walked back again - she had left her antibiotics on the chair, so her chap kindly cycled back, there, here <*> ampersand </*> then back there for them, with them. <#> Oh tit-willow! <#> Oh what grand deeds and earth-shattering life acts I <}> <-> envisiged </-> <+> envisaged </+> </}> when I looked up words in my incomplete dictionary. <#> The imperfections reveal more truth and humour and life than anything else. <#> What an earth-shattering discovery. </p><p> <#> Well I will stop bolloxing on now <*> ampersand </*> go <*> ampersand </*> buy some milk for the Weetabix and tea. <#> Letter writing is very thirst-inducing. <#> I 'm afraid the word frugal doesn't apply to my writing, verbose the full palate maybe. </p><p> <#> I will post this on my way back from the shop. <#> So I hope all goes well for you today Jen. </p><p> <#> Your loving friend <#> Eileen xxx </p></I>
