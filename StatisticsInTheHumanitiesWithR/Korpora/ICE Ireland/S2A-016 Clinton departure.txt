<ICE-IRE:S2A-016 Clinton departure><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Well there is uhm some uh hope that he 's going to arrive very shortly <#> At the moment as you can see the security presence is there on the roof of the terminal buildings and we there are no there 's a very strong police presence and military presence here this morning <#> Uhm as the camera pans around there you 're shortly going to see that there is a huddle of people down at the uh <.> ba </.> the foot of the steps of Air Force One <,> but they haven't yet formed into any kind of a receiving line or anything like that <,> which I 'm sure they would have done if they were about to <,> if the presidential party were in fact about to arrive <#> We have a few more details now about the family that he is likely to meet <#> It is in fact the Filipovic family <,> uhm from Bosnia who originally were from Sarajevo <,> and what makes this family particularly relevant is that the little girl who was a member of the family <,> Zlata <,> wrote a book which you may recall being published called Zlata 's Diary <,> which wrote about her times as a child growing up in war-torn Sarajevo <#> So she will <,> she and her family will be the family who will greet uhm the president when he actually arrives <,> and with them will be a friend of Zlata 's called Mirna Pedalo who also uh comes from Sarajevo and is a close friend of Zlata 's <#> So that 's uhm a little bit more detail that might not have been uh <,> you might not have been aware of so far <,,><&> unclear speech from studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Precisely <#> I mean that 's the point that Foreign Affairs are making here <#> They say that this is yet another way of linking the visit if you like <#> You may also remember that uh you know throughout his visit to Dublin yesterday he made numerous references to Ireland 's role as a peace-keeper <,> as a peace-maker in the world even though we were such a small nation <#> And I think that <.> mov </.> <.> ee </.> particularly now that the Americans are so keen to enhance their peace-keeping role with this assignment of troops to Bosnia <,> I think this may be another uh <,> quite a small link <,> but a but a link nonetheless in a chain of of of a a peace-keeping momentum that he would be keen to build from this visit <,,><&> unclear speech from studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Precisely <#> Now if I can cut away from that theme for the moment Brian <,> you may see from the television pictures that the crew appear to be heading for the plane now <#> Uhm <.> w </.> they obviously would be preparing their flight plan for going to the US base <,> army base at Ramstein just outside Frankfurt and uh so <,> presumably now that means that we must be coming quite close to a time when the presidential party are going to arrive <#> A very small detail but this might be of relevance <,> uhm you may <.> noti </.> <,> you may recall yesterday there was miles and miles of red carpet out on the tarmac <#> I think it was something like three hundred feet of red carpet were laid for the uh receiving line and for the ceremonials that were here yesterday <#> A very very short piece of carpet there at the foot of the steps into Air Force One <#> And I think that that is because there is going to be a very very brief ceremony <#> There was there aren't going to be any long walks <,> there aren't going to be any long uh receiving lines <#> It 'll all be handled in a very very quick way to get him on his way as speedily as possible <,,> <#> Well yes I mean Brian I think that 's the key difference between the the visits that we saw of President Reagan and uhm I I I only barely recall the the the the the Kennedy visit <#> But the key difference is that I mean there was serious business on the table this time <#> There was serious peace initiative to be sorted out <,> there were <,> uh uh uh I we all know how serious the logjam was until Tuesday <#> It remains to be seen how far we will go beyond that <#> But there 's no doubt but that he came here not just for ceremonials <,> not just the walkabouts but to create a real moral imperative <,> to move the process on <,> and that you know the business doesn't end here <,> the business is moving on to uh Bosnia <,> to Germany and to Bosnia now which will be significant <#> Now if I can bring you back to the pictures if you <,> you may have seen there there were cars arriving <,> a motorcade coming in through the <,> the the tarmac behind Air Force One <#> So that 's just gone behind the terminal building now where the the the B pier <,> where we all get our usual flights out of Dublin Airport <#> So I 'm sure they will come round from behind that very shortly <,,> <#> Yes I mean I think the rain is not quite as heavy as it was <#> Uhm uh <,> I certainly picked the wrong moment to be out in it <,> but uhm you can see there that there is now much more activity around the foot of the plane and uh having seen some cars on their way at the back of the tarmac as I said a moment ago <,> I 'm sure that we are going to see some action very very shortly <,,><&> person speaks in studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> They they may well have done that uh I think a number of people I met last night were feeling very sorry for President Robinson who seemed to be in quite light clothing <,> so I 'd say it 's just as well she wasn't here this morning <#> You see there some of the security presence I assume <,> uh all looking very concerned to make sure that everything goes as well as possible <#> Just on a slightly different note Brian uhm one thing that struck me uh last night I was out with some friends and a number of <,> a everybody talks about how they remember where they were when President Kennedy was here <#> Nobody ever refers to Jackie Kennedy and to her role in the visit <,> and yet everybody last night was talking about what a strong presence Hillary Clinton had had <,,> <#> I would have thought <#> That 's Christy Spring <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Dick Spring <#> And that must be Proinsias <#> Thanks Brian <#> Yes the dignatories are just coming onto the tarmac now <,> uh you see there Dick Spring <,> Christy Spring his wife <,> and <.> ver </.> a short time ago we saw John Bruton being escorted by two uh army officers onto the tarmac <,> he 's just behind them <,> there 's Proinsias de Rossa and his wife Monica <#> So clearly uh the arrival must be imminent <#> Everybody <.> warm </.> <.> wraply </.> warmed up <.> f </.> <.> w </.> <,> warmly wrapped up <,> sorry <,> for for this morning against the elements <,,><&> person speaks in studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Uh he may well be <,> he may also be looking at a few helicopters that were around here a short time ago <#> Uhm <.> the </.> there there you see the Taoiseach and his wife Finola Bruton being escorted to the receiving point and I understand that that means that the arrival should be fairly imminent <,,><&> person speaks in studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Indeed <,> <#> Precisely <,> that 's uh Brigadier General Bill Dwyer <,> General Officer Eastern Command <,> and uh the Chief of Staff is Lieutenant General McMahon <,> <#> And Brian I understand that the motorcade has just been cleared for arrival <#> So I would imagine that that crowd of people will start forming into a fairly orderly line uh pretty soon now <,> <#> Yes you can see people trying to shepherd them into position now <,,> <#> Uh I have no indication as to where they are <,> uhm we 're still trying to find out exactly where they are going to be <,> but uhm as you see there 's quite a disorderly crowd there which could which could be anybody really <#> Uhm there 's some <.> si </.> some attempt to put some security uh presence on <.> I </.> or to put it into order <#> But uhm we 'll just have to wait and see what happens <#> I mean I understand that this Bosnian element was added pretty much as <,> <.> a </.> at the last minute <#> So uh we 'll just have to wait and see how that pans out <#> Sorry <.> t </.> not to be able to give you any further details on that <,,> <#> No it certainly seems to have cleared up <#> I think there may be some slight drizzle out there but nothing you couldn't live with <#> Uhm I think it would have been a shame if that torrential rain had continued and had marred the departure <,> because <.> a </.> as your panellists and yourself have been saying <,> it really has been an extraordinarily successful visit and I think that while there <.> a </.> there aren't the crowds here at the airport that we saw before <,> there aren't the crowds we saw in College Green <#> This is a low-key departure <#> But it 's an important element <,> it 's a send-off <,> it 's the final moment of <,> of the trip <,> and it would be a shame to see even that marred by bad weather <,,> <#> Yes but as you said earlier I mean <,> the uh what makes this business <.> di </.> <,> this uh trip different is that there is a huge business element to it <,> and I think <,> given the pressing business that the Minister <,> that the President faces in uh Germany in relation to the Bosnian troops and the peace-keeping mission there <,> I 'm sure that if there is any slight breach of protocol involved that everybody will be prepared to overlook that and to live with it <#> I mean these things run a little bit late <,> we just have to live with that sort of thing <,,> <#> Well you see there the red carpet line-up has is starting Brian <#> So I mean that clearly is an indication that uh the arrival is imminent <,,> <#> Yes well I mean <,> I think uh most of us who have been to Dublin Airport are familiar with the with the rolling green fields that surround it <#> Uhm <,> it really is a a a a quite a <.> bri </.> brightening up into quite a nice morning <,> surprisingly for anyone who has <.> be </.> who has been here since since earlier <,,><&> person speaks in studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> No we have no update <,> but as you say <,> I mean everybody 's just standing by <,> I I <.> thi </.> I think given that uh these things can run a little bit late <#> I mean there may have been a delay at at the Ambassador 's residence where he was overnighting in saying good-bye to the Ambassador uh <#> These these things can take a little while longer and <,,><&> person speaks in studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Yes that 's <.> in </.> that 's indeed true <,> but just to bring you up to date uh <,> they have actually now stopped all other flights coming in or going out of Dublin Airport <,> so that is a clear indicator that the arrival is imminent and we are just standing by <#> We can actually see there are some motorcycle riders on the tarmac but I don't think that they 're associated with the actual presidential motorcade <,> I think they may have been associated with uhm the earlier arrival of some of the dignatories <#> And overhead you can see some helicopters <,> probably a security presence there for the uh for the departure <#> I mean <,> uh <.> th </.> I think uh it 's hard to overstate how worried the entourage surrounding the President are about the security issue <#> I mean it is such a huge worry for them <,> that even in what <,> <.> i </.> in circumstances that you and I would sort of take for granted <,> they are paranoid about it <#> Uh uh maybe that 's the wrong word to use given that they have had horrible instances in the past where presidents have been assassinated in America <#> But they are so conscious of every every every final detail that uh you can understand why there 's <,> you know everything tenses up when the President is about to arrive <,> and not just uh out of anticipation <,,><&> person speaks in studio </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Absolutely <#> Brian if I can just uh bring you up to date <#> We 're going to go over to Paul Hick now in uhm in Air Traffic Control <#> Paul what 's the latest<ICE-IRE:S2A-016$B> <#> Uh Ingrid uh we 've done the security sweep of the taxiway and runway and we 're awaiting the startup of Air Force One <#> I believe the motorcade has just reached the airport so they 're obviously a bit behind schedule<ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> So do you have an estimated time of departure now<ICE-IRE:S2A-016$B> <#> Well it depends uh it takes them to say goodbye really on the apron <#> Uhm I would say taxi would probably be inside ten minutes<ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> Inside ten minutes<ICE-IRE:S2A-016$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S2A-016$A> <#> That 's great Paul <#> Thanks very much indeed for for giving us that <#> So as you can see <,> people are still assembled at the bottom of the plane and waiting for the motorcade <,> but as Paul was saying <,> the motorcade has reached the airport <,> that all incoming and outgoing flights have been stopped <,> and we 're just waiting for the next step which is the arrival of the actual presidential party <,,> <#> Not that far actually uh uh I I 'm sure anyone who 's been to Dublin Airport will be aware of that circular pier where all of the flights the B twenty-one to B twenty-eight gates are <#> It 's not parked into one of those tunnel things that you go in and out of to get on and off the planes <#> It 's parked on the apron I 'd say about two hundred <.> yar </.> two hundred yards away from that <#> Possibly <,> possibly closer <#> But what is interesting is that here at the airport <,> oh sorry <,> here he <.> i </.> <,> here he comes <#> We can see the motorcade arriving <,> first a Garda car and then the <.> mo </.> the the motorcycle outriders <,> another Garda car <,> presumably Special Branch <,> and here comes the presidential car <,,> <#> And they 're taking a circular route around the plane <,> round the back of the plane and coming round to the front where they will be greeted by the reception committee <,,> <#> It 's amazing how many cars are actually in the cavalcade because uh you kind of wonder who 's in them all <,,> <#> And as the President just about arrives in front of the plane they 're still coming from behind <,> an awful lot of American limousines <,,> <#> Oh yes I 'm sure it is <#> It 's just uh I suppose we in Ireland are not used to this level of uhm administration or of protocol if you like <,> so it 's quite impressive to see it when when you do <#> And the car has stopped at the foot of the <.> pl </.> steps to the plane <#> Security men as usual watching for anything in the crowd that could go wrong before they will let the presidential party out of the car <,,> <#> And <,,> and <,> and there is President Clinton in the car preparing to <.> dis </.> disembark <,,> <#> Looking fresh after a late night in Dublin Castle last night <,,> <#> Absolutely <,> uhm but then he 's on to very subdued business <#> I suppose that could explain it <#> Saying good-bye to Finola Bruton there <,,> <#> Hillary Clinton giving Finola Bruton a kiss <,> so obviously they must have got on very well <#> Looking very crisp in a <,> what looks like a dark brown jacket trimmed in white with gold buttons</I>
