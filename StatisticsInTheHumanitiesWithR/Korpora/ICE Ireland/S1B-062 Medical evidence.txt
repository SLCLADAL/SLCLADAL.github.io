Early <,> the first dated October seventeenth nineteen ninety-four <,> the second <,> September nineteenth nineteen ninety-six <#> Dr Early will you outline to His Lordship your qualifications and position<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> I 'm a consultant dermatologist at Craigavon Area Hospital <#> My qualifications are <,> Doctor of Medicine and Member of the Royal College of Physicians of London<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now you first examined uh the plaintiff on the fourteenth of October nineteen ninety-four <#> Is that correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> And you ascertained that <,> you took a history from the plaintiff at that stage <#> Is that right<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Could you outline the<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$D> <unclear> several words </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> You uh reached a diagnosis on the basis of the history taken and your examination of the plaintiff uh at that time <,> isn't that right Doctor<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> And what was the diagnosis<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> I felt that he had a <.> co </.> contact dermatitis affecting his hands and forearms<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> And were you able to attribute that to anything in particular at that time<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> I thought it was most likely due to uh the wetness <,> the continuous wetness at work <,> but also uh possibly due to the <.> irritan </.> irritancy of the plasticised PVC paste and uh methylated spirits<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> How serious was the rash at the time that you examined him initially<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> It seemed to be quite bad at the time when I saw him in October uh nineteen ninety-four <#> Uh he had a lot of eczematous dermatitis affecting several fingers <#> Some of the fingers had deep fissures or cuts in them uh which were making uh bending of the fingers difficult <#> It was worse on the right hand than on the left hand <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now you re-examined on the thirteenth of September nineteen ninety-six <#> Is that correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> And at that time <,> on examination uh what did you find<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$B> <#> His rash appeared to be much less at that stage <,> uhm he had some eczematous dermatitis on the sides of his right middle finger <,> and some on the sides of the left little finger <,> and the web space between the right ring <,> right forefinger and middle finger <#> Otherwise the skin was was uh quite normal<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now at the time of your uh initial inspection you <.> ha </.> didn't have access to the plaintiff 's General Practitioner 's notes <#> Is that correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Apart from uh referral letters to the Craigavon Area Hospital where I work<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now you you had the entire uh General Practitioner 's notes by the time that you examined on the second occasion<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> And did anything arise from those which had a bearing on your diagnosis and your what your consideration of the plaintiff 's condition<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Uhm it was quite clear that Mr Mallory had attended his General Practitioner on a number of occasions with rash on his forearms and hands and uh the General Practitioner had also considered this to be possibly work-related <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> There was reference in the General Practitioner 's notes to uh other skin uh related problems<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is right <#> Uhm in I think August nineteen ninety-three he appeared to have a rash on his scalp <#> Uhm no diagnosis was made by the General Practitioner and he was referred on to Craigavon Area Hospital<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> And what diagnosis was made there<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> They made a diagnosis of this being psoriasis affecting his scalp<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Did you reach any view as regards that uh that rash and that diagnosis<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Uh according to the hospital notes he was reviewed once afterwards uh and the rash on his scalp had improved well <#> Uhm I can only presume that he may have had psoriasis on the scalp <#> I personally didn't see it myself <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Did it have any bearing on your uh diagnosis of a contact irritant dermatitis caused by substances in work<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> I don't think the fact that he had psoriasis on his scalp would uhm influence the fact that he could have had an irritant contact dermatitis on his hands <#> In other words <,> a separate condition<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> There were <,> there was another uh reference in relation to a skin problem uh round about the same time in nineteen ninety-three <#> Is that correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> I don't think that appears in the General Practitioner notes <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Will you just look at your your General Practitioner paragraph A of the General Practitioner 's notes in your second report <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> And we 're we 're referring to what date<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> That 's your report of<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Yes <#> Sorry what date for the General Practitioner<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> November twenty-ninth nineteen ninety-three <#> The reference is Dr Stack <,> who 's a colleague <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[> at Craigavon Hospital<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> <[> That 's right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> She 's a an associate specialist at Craigavon Area Hospital uh where he had attended with his scalp rash and his hand rash<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now in relation to the scalp rash and hand rash again was that the same attendance<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Both were uhm <.> me </.> both were mentioned at the at the first attendance with Dr Stack<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Then there 's the second <.> atten </.> that first attendance is the twenty-seventh of September nineteen <.> eight </.> ninety-three <#> The plaintiff 's second attendance was November twenty-ninth nineteen ninety-three<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> And what was what was that in relation to<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That again uh was a review appointment uh by Dr Stack <#> She felt that the uh scalp uh psoriasis had cleared well <#> In fact she said it <.> c </.> cleared <.> complet </.> completely <#> Uhm but at this stage he <,> uh Mr Mallory was complaining of <,> or was noted to have scattered eczema on his body<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now there 's reference to that being attributable to using a a perfumed body spray<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Would that have a bearing on your diagnosis of contact irritant dermatitis especially on the hand<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Uh it is difficult to know exactly what was being <,> what was uh causing this this eczema on his body <#> I really don't know what this was <#> Uh he does not appear subsequently on patch testing to be allergic to perfume but I couldn't rule that out <#> Uh it may be that he is more likely to develop eczema because he has what is known as an atopic tendency <,> that is he also suffers from asthma <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> If he does suffer from asthma would that have any bearing on his uh potential for uh contracting a condition such as uh dermatitis<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That 's most certainly would have uh an influence <#> It is well recognised that people who suffer from asthma or hay-fever or who have had a past history of eczema are more likely to develop uh contact dermatitis <,> especially of the irritant type when put in work with skin irritants or wet work <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now at the time that you carried out your uh second examination and prepared the second report you had the benefit of seeing the safety data sheet which had been furnished by the defendant <#> Is that correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now these show that the the plaintiff was in uh contact with a number of substances <#> First of all <,> methylated spirits <#> Would methylated spirits be a substance which could cause uh skin problems<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Yes <#> Uh <.> methyla </.> methylated spirits uh is basically alcohol which would de-fat skin and make it much more likely to develop irritant contact dermatitis <,> or to even cause it in the first place <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> What would be the usual way to protect the the user of methylated spirits from uh contracting dermatitis<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> To wear gloves <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now you also uh had access to the safety data sheet in respect of the plastic paste <#> Is that right<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Was there any reference there to their effect on the skin<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Yes the data sheet indicated that the <.> plastici </.> the plasticiser or PVC was a mild irritant on the skin <,> and if there was uh skin contact that uh it should be washed off with large amounts of soap and water <#> It is also suggested in these data sheets that <.> neopre </.> neoprene gloves should be worn while working with this substance <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now they 're described as mildly irritant on the skin<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> That is correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Now <.> ho </.> uh uh <,> can you uh describe to or explain to His Lordship how a mild irritant would cause skin trouble<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Yes <&> clears throat </&> <#> Irritant contact dermatitis uh is caused often by the accumulative effect of a number of uh agents acting on the skin over fairly protracted uh periods of time <#> I would see the irritants here as being firstly wetness at work <,> uh also the <.> plasticise </.> plasticised PVC paste and DIP moulding materials <,> and also methylated spirits to be cumulative in their effect against the skin <#> I wouldn't attribute this rash to any particular one of those agents but to the cumulative effect of all of them <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> The plaintiff uh says that he still <,> or would say that he still suffers from flare-ups from the rash even now that he 's been moved to a clean dry job <#> Can you explain that<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Yes <#> Uhm once uh hand eczema or irritant contact dermatitis has been established <,> it is well recognised that flare-ups can occur <,> often for no good and apparent reason for between nine and eighteen months <.> a </.> after the person is removed from the source of the irritant <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> What would be the prognosis in this case<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> I think the prognosis uh generally would be good uhm if this gentleman was removed from wet work <,> work with skin irritants and potential skin allergens <,> I think with time his hands should settle back to normal <,> uh and he <,> if he was not placed in a similar position would uh <,> his hands would would revert to normal <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Finally the plaintiff was patch tested uhm to see if he was allergic to the substances and this all turned out to be negative<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$C> <#> Yes <#> Uh patch testing to all of these substances uh was negative <,> indicating that he was not or did not seem to be allergic to any of them<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$D> <#> Uh <,> I haven't really had an opportunity to read the reports in detail <#> I 'd quite like to have that opportunity <#> Uhm so if you would leave further <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> until after lunch<ICE-IRE:S1B-062$A> <#> Yes indeed <#> Could I ask My Lord <,> uhm Dr McGillen <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-062$D> <#> Yes indeed <#> I 'd be much obliged</I>
