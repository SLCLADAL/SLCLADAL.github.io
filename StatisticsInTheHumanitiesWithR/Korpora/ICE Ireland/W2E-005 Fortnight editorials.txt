Despite some deep-seated reservations the government has gone along with the strategy to date and it may well be too late to get out." </quote> </p><p> <#> Ministers were rocked on their heels by Mr Adams ' remark, echoed by the IRA, that peace was not a "prerequisite" of the ... peace process! <#> After the Shankill bomb, the t&/anaiste, Dick Spring, said that 'process' had been dealt a <quote> "grievous blow". </quote> </p><p> <#> Yet Mr Adams ' response to the t&/anaiste 's comments suggested that he was the government, the latter a mere bystander. <#> He slapped him down thus: <quote> "Mr Spring has to allow me to be the best judge of how I move forward". </quote> </p><p> <#> It is an appalling catalogue of error. <#> There must now be an end to what Dick Walsh of the <it> Irish Times </it> called <quote> "fooling around with words". </quote> <#> Engaging in an airy disquisition about 'Irish self-determination' while claiming simultaneously to be seeking unionist 'agreement' is self-delusion: ever heard of anyone supporting 'self-determination' who wanted to remain inside a state? <#> The inevitable unionist riposte was that <it> they </it> had the right of 'self-determination', to secede from the rest of the island. <#> We 've had that argument for a century and, while the slaughter continues, we can go round that circle for ever. </p><p> <#> There has been much facile comparison of Northern Ireland with the middle east and South Africa - mindless of the fact that these two conflicts were prisoners of the cold war, whose demise made the breakthrough possible. <#> Last month, Padraig O'Malley of the Opsahl Commission, who has closely studied South Africa, drew the real parallel: the relative 'manageability' of the Northern Ireland conflict, the argued, meant there was not the same pressure on politicians to compromise. <#> It may, he gloomily concluded, have to get a lot worse before it gets better. </p><p> <#> The two government must now recapture the initiative. <#> They must elaborate positive proposals that can command acceptance across Northern Ireland. <#> People are crying out for the <quote> "vision of hope" </quote> called for by Archbishop Eames. <#> The 'realities' identified by the Opsahl report, based on a widespread survey of opinion, offer a ready-made framework. </p><p> <#> If they do not, that human appeal of the Shankill relative will be in vain. </p></I><I><W2E-005$A><h> <#> <bold> leader </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Popular power </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Robin Wilson </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> The pieces inside by Adrian Guelke (p12) and (in the supplement) Eamonn Gallagher should make arresting reading for any complacent minister or official in London or Dublin </bold> . <#> Can any <it> still </it> be complacent after the miasma into which the 'peace process' collapsed last month? </p><p> <#> In giving the Downing Street Declaration a fair wind ( <it> Fortnight 324 </it> ), we suppressed our doubts about the way it hinged on the notion of 'self-determination' ( <it> Fortnight 321 </it> ). <#> Yet it is now evident that what Mr Gallagher calls the <quote> 'paradigm of conflicting self-determinations' </quote> , which has been at the heart of attempts to achieve a settlement since direct rule, is fundamentally flawed. </p><p> <#> As the former Opsahl commissioner argues, <quote> "While academic research during the past 20 years or so has concentrated on the problem as principally an internal conflict largely confined to Northern Ireland but with external ramifications, politics has concentrated on the self-determination paradigm - with, and perhaps for that reason, limited success." </quote> </p><p> <#> Prof Guelke, having written on international dimensions of the conflict as well as on his native South Africa, is similarly well placed to comment. <#> Making self-determination hinge on whether nationalists or unionists hold a majority, he points out, is not only not new; it does not offer a formula for breaking down the sectarian divide. <#> Instead, it risks "placing a political premium on the maintenance of community solidarity and offering no incentives for cross-community co-operation". </p><p> <#> Last month 's messy exchanges between Sinn F&/ein, the two governments and sundry other players entirely missed the point - which is not whether the declaration is 'clarified' or not. <#> Paradoxically, to 'clarify' it for Sinn F&/ein, to make it more akin to Hume-Adams, would entail making key elements <it> less </it> clear - particularly the majority-consent principle and the neutrality of the British, both of which would be qualified into an implied long-term withdrawal formula. </p><p> <#> So are we inevitably destined to spend weeks, months, years more 'Waiting for Provo'? <#> There is now no doubt that the republican movement will not accept the declaration as it stands, and equally none that the 'clarification' Gerry Adams has sought would see crucial liberal Protestant support (see p14) disappear like snow off a ditch. </p><p> <#> But there is another way. <#> Republicans have tentatively indicated that what <it> could </it> be acceptable is a clear and incontrovertible commitment by the British government on foot of the declaration to introduce a series of measures which would <quote> "empower the nationalist community" </quote>. </p><p> <#> They frankly admit that the rank-and-file republican view of the declaration is that it has nothing to offer. <#> They point to the disillusioning experience of the first hunger strike, when a vague and general document produced by the British did not lead to the expected concrete steps (until after the next one). <#> And they are convinced that, even were the IRA to accept the declaration as it stands, another IRA would take its place. </p><p> <#> But what if, as was suggested in <it> Fortnight 323 </it>, the British government was to commit itself - and, where possible, rapidly introduce - a raft of measures which secured the 'empowerment' of nationalists (without disempowering unionists) which the Opsahl Commission held out? <#> A promise that any new political institutions would entrench equality, not just majoritarian power-sharing; a pledge to give legal recognition of nationalism so that Northern Ireland no longer enshrined unionist cultural dominance; new north-south structures so that relationship on the island were between Irish men and women alone; a bill of right and repeal of 'emergency legislation'; phased withdrawal of the army, initially to barracks; a fundamental review of policing, to establishing a service which no longer entailed the majority policing the minority; a programme of social and economic reconstruction for ghetto areas; phased release and reintegration of paramilitary prisoners; and so on. </p><p> <#> This would give republican leaders something to 'sell' as a rationale for a purely peaceful politics, would indicate the <it> bona fides </it> of the British state and would clearly help, rather than hinder, the long-term goal of unification by consent. </p><p> <#> None of these principles need prejudice renewed interparty talks. <#> Indeed, the latter frankly have no chance of success unless such a clear framework is established for them. <#> For by ending the ludicrous separation between 'peace' and 'talks' - not to mention the latter's baroque 'three strands' division - we could then get on to the business of fleshing out the cross-sectarian consensus that Opsahl sketched and to which Prof. Guelke alludes. </p><p> <#> The big question, as ever though, is this: would the <it> British government </it> be prepared, given the Conservatives ' implacable hostility to root-and-branch reform of the British constitution, to entertain such a radical rethink, to make a settlement possible in Northern Ireland? </p></I><I><W2E-005$A><h> <#> <bold> The final phase </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Robin Wilson </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> Last month, most of the political class in these islands was still asking the wrong question.</bold> <#> 'Will the republican movement accept the joint declaration?' was answered in December ( <it> Fortnight 324 </it> ). <#> The real question is <quote> 'Can IRA (and other) violence be brought to an end?' </quote> <#> The answer to that could now be yes. </p><p> <#> The <it> Economist </it> rightly attacked both government last month for their lack of forethought at the time of the declaration as to what they would do if the IRA did not accept it. <#> Subsequent inertia in London has let Sinn F&/ein roll forward off its heels with the endless, synthetic calls for <it> British </it> 'clarification' - as if a 16-page document from an <it> Irish </it> government wasn't good enough! <#> Last month, that inertia entailed an unbelievably stupid defence of the Prevention of Terrorism Act - as if to validate those defiant IRA mortars at Heathrow - in continued contravention of the European Convention of Human Rights. </p><p> <#> Yet Dublin has also encouraged northern nationalist immobilism, echoing the Hume-Adams rejection of an 'internal settlement' - when, as the Social Democratic and Labour leader himself surely appreciates, the very dichotomy of 'internal' <it> versus </it>'external' pertains to a period of absolute 'national sovereignty' obsolete in the modern Europe. <#> The genius of the Opsahl report was to address 'internally' - via legal recognition of northern nationalism and other innovations - aspirations it was traditionally conceived could only be met by 'external' means. </p><p> <#> In the light of the defeat of the 'liberal' Chris McGimpsey at the Ulster Unionist agm and the histrionics by the Democratic Unionist leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, in Downing Street, the <it> Economist </it> was also right to conclude: <quote> <#> "Northern Ireland 's politicians cannot, and probably will never be able to, formulate among themselves ... a settlement." </quote> <#> But it continued: <quote> "Nevertheless, polls show that a vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are fed up with the province 's [sic] political stalemate as well as the convoluted rationale given by the IRA for its violent campaign ... <#> The two governments must now exploit this desire for a settlement, and the growing anger at the IRA, by proposing how peace, and justice, in Northern Ireland can be achieved." </p><p> <#> Just so ( <it> Fortnight 326 </it> ). <#> Start with the right question. <#> And the initial answer is that <it> already </it> IRA violence has been constrained, by such evidence of popular anger as the recent north-south poll for BBC 's <it> On the Record. </it> <#> Civilian casualties are now out, as are huge bombs in Protestant towns. </p><p> <#> Result? <#> Only two IRA victims this year, as we went to press. <#> That 's no consolation to the five Catholics slayed by sectarian assassins, but even that killing rate, horrendous though it is, is down on the last two years of bloody loyalism. <#> No one has been killed by the police or army since November 1992. </p><p> <#> The republican leadership is also hoist by its own petard. <#> As after Heathrow, every act of IRA violence now only devalues Mr Adams ' peace-loving credentials. <#> The web of three governments SF drew around itself, party <it> via </it> Mr Hume, is falling apart - as impatience grows not only in London but in Dublin and Washington, and is no longer even concealed by Mr Hume 's party colleagues. </p><p> <#> The <it> Andersonstown News </it> could not be further, in class or national terms, from the aloof assuredness of the <it> Economist. </it> <#> But last month it set out a fuller answer to the (right) question: <#> <quote> "It surprises us that usually sane people should thing that, after 20 years of armed conflict and thousands of deaths, the situation could be rectified without a fundamental and radical change in society." </quote> </p><p> <#> And it went on, echoing Opsahl: <quote> "No matter about the nitty gritty of constitutional change or the argument about self-determination, the ethos of the state here has to change to accommodate the identity and outlook of all its citizens." </quote><p> <#> It 's an argument compellingly made inside by the leader of SF on Belfast City Council, Alex Maskey (p28), in a demand for real parity of esteem. <#> In this state, such liberalism and pluralism <it> would be </it> <quote> 'fundamental and radical change'. </quote> </p><p> <#> It 's been the role of <it> this </it> leader column in recent months to point the way through the impasse by highlighting this legitimate republican demand for empowerment of the northern minority, as against perpetuating in intractable 'argument about self-determination'. </p><p> <#> In last month 's Lords debate on Opsahl, the former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Rees said: <quote> "The report is a remarkable document ... It influence and should influence the steps that are to be taken." </quote> <#> Its beauty is that, should IRA (and other) violence become increasingly perfunctory, it provides steps - such as a bill or charter of rights - which republicans can welcome to ease them out of the political ghetto into a wider <it> realpolitik, </it> yet which liberals and pluralists can endorse as a necessary substratum of new institutions. </p><p> <#> And, just as importantly, its overall recommendations - supported by a 'vast majority' in the subsequent poll as they were - provide a basis on which the two governments can establish just how 'peace, and justice' are to be secured. </p></I>
