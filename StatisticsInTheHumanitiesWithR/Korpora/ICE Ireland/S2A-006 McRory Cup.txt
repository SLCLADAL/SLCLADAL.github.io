<ICE-IRE:S2A-006 McRory Cup><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Magherafelt trying to raise the tempo <,> but if they do <,> Maghera are certainly matching them Peter<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yes and giving the ball away <,> they 're they 're now got <,> they 're <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> now <#> They obviously don't play the ball as long <#> Whatever breeze they 're playing into is making it difficult for them to kick a long accurate ball <,> and they 've given the ball away three four times in a row<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Stephen Crozier drives it in <#> Owen McNicholl watched it the whole way <,> even on his knees <,> still has time to play that ball out <#> That 's a foul <#> Young Conor Scullion <,> that could be his last <,> effort today <#> We feel that he 's the man who 's being taken off <,> in fact he certainly is <,> and he is being replaced by Kevin Gormley from Desertmartin <#> So Saint Mary 's Magherafelt make their second change <#> Kevin Gormley <,> he 's coming on <,> and he 's taking the place of Conor Scullion <,,> <#> So young Kevin Gormley helped Desertmartin to win the Derry Minor Championship <#> He 's taking the place of the corner forward then Conor Scullion <#> So play restarts <,> and Kevin Gormley a a cousin of Enda Gormley <,> so trying to plot the downfall of Enda 's former alma mater<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Magherafelt have also made changes upfront Jimmy <#> Paul Kielty has gone into the full forward line <,> Colin Devlin has come out to field<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Still <,> Magherafelt <,> pouring forward again <#> That 's a hopeful kick by John O'Boyle <,> the Randalstown man <,> drives it in <,> beautifully taken <#> Plucked out of the air by Mark Lynch and driven down as far only as Cathal Doyle <,> Ballymaguigan man as Magherafelt try to get their first score <#> Mickey Convery has blown a foul on the Maghera player so there 'll be a free for <,> Magherafelt and with almost twenty minutes gone in the second half <,> is this an opportunity for Magherafelt to get their first score<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yes they 've never really been able to get a running game going in this second half <#> They 're usually very good pouring forth in the half back side <#> That was obviously hampered by the loss of Michael McIvor <,> uh but as well <,> the Maghera tackling and what happened here this free was given because the <,> the runner who give the ball was blocked <,> uhm so a combination of those three things have been effective and I must say as well <,> uh Magherafelt 's general play in this half Jimmy has been only a shadow of the performance they produced in the first<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Colin Devlin <,> scorer of two points in the first half <,> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> certainly getting plenty of time to hold his breath <#> John McElhone quickly taking a free <,> turns inside <,> and falls into the path of Joe O'Kane <#> Still Magherafelt gain possession <,> McEldowney the substitute kicks it <,> but kicks it wide<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> And just as in the first half Jimmy when nothing seemed to be <,> go right for Maghera <,> uhm <,> but now Magherafelt are having great difficulty <#> This was as good a chance as they 've had in this second half <#> Uh <,> granted it was a substitute that hasn't been on the board very much <,> uh but in these sort of games that was a relatively simple chance<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> It was indeed <#> And the text number 's on the screen <,> o double seven six four three double five two o two for any messages that you want to send <,> anything you feel <,> you 'd like to say about this McRory Final <,> as Magherafelt move in again <#> And it 's the Maghera defence that have really come out on top in this second half <#> Gavin Scullion <,> plays that cross-field ball <,> driven in long by Lynch <#> Nice strike <,> Brendan Mullan <,> scored a point earlier in this second half <,> and the big Dungiven player does it again<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Gerard O'Kane <,> instrumental in sorting this out <#> A poor ball from uh Colly Devlin <,> picked up by the full back <,> moved out to Gerard O'Kane and then a good ball inside <#> And Mullan was enjoying himself there<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Yes wonderful <,> the pressure off <#> Magherafelt <,> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> the substitute <#> Off his chest <#> Away it goes over the line<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> He has made a difference in there Jimmy <#> He 's certainly competed for ball <,> uhm he 's made himself available <,> and it has been and it 'll turn out to be a master stroke <,,><ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> This time it 's well spotted by Mark Collins <#> Cathal Doyle <,> three Maghera men around him <#> And certainly this second half has belonged to Maghera <#> Those sort of passes were going crisply into the chest in the first half but now Magherafelt have no time to dwell the ball at all as Ruairi Murray drives that ball across to the middle of the field expect to collect again <#> It 's Mark Lynch who 's taken down and out of it <#> And he claims it was his shoulder <#> It 'll be interesting to see what Mickey Convery thinks about it as he calls Ciaran McCallion to the one side<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yeah I thought for a minute Jimmy that was Stephen Crozier who was booked remember for that challenge on Gerard O'Kane earlier on <#> I 'd say he 's going in the book <#> Uhm but I mean Maghera 's woes at this stage <,> Magherafelt 's woes at this stage cannot be simply put down to the breeze <#> Their passing <,> uhm their composure <,> everything has changed from the first half <#> But I mean all credit to Maghera <#> They reorganised regrouped at half-time <,> uhm got their heads up and came sprinting out of the blocks <,> in what is after all a sixty minute game <,> plus injury time<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Yes and Aidan McGuckin in there having a word <,> about the tug on the jersey <#> Yes we could see that clearly from here as Kevin Bradley 's jersey was held so it 's a free out for Magherafelt but it 's not frees Magherafelt need at the moment <#> It 's scores and plenty of them<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yes you 'd have to say Micky Convery in <,> <.> i </.> in what was possibly a difficult game for him uhm has missed very little Jimmy<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> He has indeed <#> Now it 's Niall McEldowney as the ball goes over the sideline <#> Seconds ticking away <,> almost twenty-five minutes gone in this second half and Magherafelt have yet to score <#> It 's been all Saint Pat 's Maghera <#> They 've turned round <,> trailing at half time by one four to two points <,> but it 's now they who lead by one nine to one four <#> A goal and seven from them in the second half <#> It 's that long hopeful kick from Charlie <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> <#> Goes to the right of the post and wide but it 's purely academic at the moment <#> The old phrase Peter that the wide is as good as a score certainly holds true<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yes even even five minutes remaining and possibly one or two uh injury time <,> uh that keeps Magherafelt pinned back in their own half <#> And they 're having difficulty getting constructive ball out of this half of the field<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Broken down again <#> This time it 's collected well by Cathal Doyle <#> Doyle is fouled <,> his progress impeded <,> but that 's all Maghera need to do <,> stop the man moving with the ball <#> This time it 's Stephen Crozier <#> An All-Ireland medal in his pocket <,> he thought that he would add a McRory Cup to it especially after the blistering first half that they had <#> That 's Cathal Doyle is surrounded by three Derry players but Mickey Convery notes that while they stood over him someone put a boot in and there 's a free in then<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Well I must say Cathal Doyle has never stopped trying here <#> He 's been on the ball a lot <#> He 's been prompting and pushing forward <,> uhm <,> trying to make something happen<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> Crozier <,> Crozier 's held <#> Toal 's swung around <#> Mickey Convery waves play on <#> That 's about the only contentious decision today <#> I think he was thinking about a bit of advantage <#> They could easily have had a penalty Peter<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yes <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> And that would have been the reason why<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yeah well Mickey Convery was on the spot <,> saw what was happening <,> uhm <,> maybe he thought he was going to get an advantage <#> Here he goes again <#> Well there wasn't any tugging Jimmy it was <,> you know it was clear momentum going forward that tossed him<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> Sheer weight of numbers then wins the day <#> Owen McNicholl in absolutely no rush <,> seconds ticking by <,> we 're in the twentieth minute of the second half as that ball is driven out <#> <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> over the sideline <#> Stephen Crozier 's there <,> the man who was up at the goal a moment ago is now back in his own half-back line <#> Long ball <,> put in again <,> this time it 's John O'Boyle who 's there <#> O'Boyle <,> loses out <#> And I think that just about sums up the second half for Magherafelt <#> Here comes Maghera pouring forward <#> There 's a Maghera player down <#> Still Maghera keep possession <#> Through the middle they go <,> held up by their wing half-back <#> Cathal Scullion 's kick however just drops into the hands of Ryan Kidd who tried to find McEldowney <#> Can McEldowney keep it in <#> He can <#> He can't <#> It looked from here as if he 'd done all the hard work <#> So even the little things are going wrong for them <{> <[> aren't they </[><ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <,> like John O'Boyle losing that ball up in the corner uh in what <,> he seemed to be in perfectly good position <#> That ball being just a little over-kicked by the keeper <#> All those things begin to matter<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> And it it 's just been announced that the man of the match today is Mark Lynch <#> He was certainly man of the match in the Semi-Final <,> instrumental in setting up the goal which brought Maghera here <#> So another award for the Banagher player as Maghera drive that ball in <#> Three minutes left <#> At least three it 's been decided so we have about a minute of normal time plus at least three of injury time <#> And can Magherafelt do something in that short period <#> It 's very very doubtful <#> Or will Maghera hold on to collect their twelfth McRory Cup<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Well the only thing that 's going to make any difference to Magherafelt is is that they need to score a goal <#> But before they do that they need to get the ball up into the the Maghera half of the field and they 're having difficulty with that now <#> I 'll give a lot of credit to the Maghera players for their work rate <,> their tackling <,> uh their pressure on the defenders coming out with the ball<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> That free played expertly into the path of the half forward <#> So a substitute then for Saint Mary 's Magherafelt <#> Chris Brown <,> or Conan Brown <,> son of Chris <,> is coming on <#> He 's going to to replace Joe O'Kane <#> So that 's Magherafelt 's third substitute <,> when he 's allowed out onto the field <#> That should be any time because the ball has now gone dead <#> But Maghera take the free too quickly so Conan Brown will just have to wait <#> Magherafelt through their captain Ruairi Murray pouring forward again <#> And young Murray seems to have picked up a cramp as play continues and Magherafelt win a free <#> So seconds tick away <#> We 're now over the thirty minutes <,> we 're now in injury time <#> Rory McEldowney <,> or Niall McEldowney <,> his substitute will come on <#> Certainly he 's worked as hard as possibly he could to try and pull this game out of the fire as Conan Brown gets a few last instructions from Eunan Conway on the sideline <,> <#> So Ruairi Murray still being attended to again he went down after he kicked that last ball <#> Looked to me like cramp <#> And he 's certainly been one of Saint Mary 's more industrious players today Peter<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yes he is a key player <,> obviously the captain uhm from left-hand back he has <,> he has tried his best to push things forward <#> Uh I suppose that <,> the fact that he is suffering with cramps is a testament to the amount of work he has done <#> Uh but Maghera have been fairly <,> have been good Jimmy at curbing his his attacking runs<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$A> <#> They have indeed <#> And they 've been very alert in this second half and none more so than their corner back Paul Donnelly <#> Donnelly has fouled <,> there 's a free out <#> Yes <,> clearly signalled by Mickey Convery <,> Dermot McNicholl round the back of the goals <#> Just as a player he 's covered every blade of grass that there is in Casement Park <#> And Mickey Convery going to have a word with Murtagh O'Brien and I think you can you can just put that down to sheer frustration<ICE-IRE:S2A-006$B> <#> Yes I suppose the the cliche/s will be rolled out Jimmy about the game with two halves and so on <,> uh and I don't think it 's down <,> down to the wind <#> Uh the wind hasn't been a big big factor <,> flags are dead really at this stage <#> Uhm a much more purposeful performance by Maghera in the second half uh they 're bigger players <,> uh great courage from Gerard O'Kane to come back on <,> uh Mark Lynch found his feet <,> uhm and Michael Friel in full forward was a revelation in that first twenty minutes of the half</I>
