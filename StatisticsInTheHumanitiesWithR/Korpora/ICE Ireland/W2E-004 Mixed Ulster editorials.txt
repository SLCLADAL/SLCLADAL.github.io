<W2E-004 Mixed Ulster editorials><I><W2E-004$A><h> <#> <bold> Balancing act </bold> </h><p> <#> EVEN before the Republic's new coalition government was finalised, Sir Patrick Mayhew was offering some pointed advice on Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution. <#> They were regarded as <quote> "an unhelpful territorial claim" </quote> to part of the UK and would be a central ingredient, he said, in discussions about a resumption of political talks in Northern Ireland. </p><p> <#> His remarks confirm that Articles 2 and 3 were the main stumbling block to agreement. <#> The Unionists wanted an assurance that a referendum "would" be held in the event of agreement being reached on new structures, but Dublin would only say that it "could". </p><p> <#> Sir Patrick was lending weight to the unionist case, providing a necessary counter-balance to his sympathetic appraisal of the nationalist tradition in his Coleraine speech before Christmas. </p><p> <#> Anyone who thought he was <quote> "going soft" </quote> by suggesting that Sinn Fein could qualify for early inclusion of the talks now knows the true position: there would have to be a <quote> "sufficient period" </quote> after renunciation of violence before dialogue with the authorities would be possible. </p><p> <#> The message to the new government in Dublin is equally clear. <#> If there is no change on Articles 2 and 3, which confer a "constitutional imperative" on governments to pursue Irish unity, further talks are pointless. </p><p> <#> It remains to be seen how serious the new coalition administration is in facing up to the Northern Ireland problem. <#> The agreed document between Fianna Fail and Labour only promised a referendum for any <quote> "agreed package" </quote>, emphasising a "balanced accommodation" and avoiding all mention of the disputed articles. </p><p> <#> The hope must be that, since it was Mr Dick Spring who broke ranks last year by proposing a suspension of Anglo-Irish conferences, his moderating influence will soon be felt. <#> With more boldness, progress could be made but that is an unlikely prospect. </p><p> <#> Although Mr Reynolds has been more realistic than his predecessors, neither he nor Mr Spring will want to risk coalition solidarity over the North, at least until after Ulster 's local government elections in May. <#> For them, there are far more pressing economic problems to resolve. <#> Here, unfortunately, the parties are starting to dig their trenches already. </p></I><I><W2E-004$B><h> <#> <bold> Sectarian fires </bold> </h><p> <#> THE recent spate of arson attacks on Catholic and Protestant churches and Orange Halls epitomises the sick sectarian undercurrent present in this province. <#> It is a low-life form of ethnic cleansing, striking at the religious affiliations and cultural traditions of the opposing community. </p><p> <#> The material cost of the fire-raising is substantial. <#> Scores of buildings have been attacked. <#> In some instances they have been so badly damaged that they can never be restored to their former state. <#> Part of our heritage is being put to the torch. </p><p> <#> There is a more insidious cost. <#> The attacks raise the level of mistrust and suspicion among neighbours and heighten community tension. <#> They add fuel to an already explosive mix. <#> Saddest of all, these irreligious acts are often carried out in the name of religion. </p><p> <#> There is one saving grace. <#> Frequently the outrages lead to a true Christian response in affected communities. <#> Clergy and laity cross the divide to offer support, both spoken and financial, to those who have been attacked. <#> They recognise that it is a battle of good against evil. </p><p> <#> A most fundamental civil right is under attack in both communities. <#> The arsonists are the enemy of all. <#> They defend no cause but attack our freedoms. <#> There is only one place for them. <#> Behind bars. </p></I><I><W2E-004$C><h> <#> <bold> Life savers </bold> </h><p> <#> CHEAP they may be, but smoke alarms have proved their worth as life-saving devices. <#> At least 145 people escaped uninjured from house blazes here last year after being alerted by the warning sirens. <#> The number of fatalities fell to 15, almost half the previous year's total. </p><p> <#> As advertisements show, fires take hold with frightening rapidity and it is essential that householders are given the earliest possible warning of any outbreak. <#> Strategically sited alarms are the best safeguard and every home should have at least one. </p><p> <#> The devices are inexpensive. <#> Special schemes are available to install them free of charge for people like pensioners. <#> Get one now. <#> It could save your life. </p></I><I><W2E-004$D><h> <#> <bold> Critical list </bold> </h><p> <#> THE consultation process continues, but the future of hospital reorganisation in the Eastern Board area is much clearer from today. <#> The Belfast Telegraph 's exclusive revelations on the future purchasing plans of the board provide the fullest picture yet of how the existing hospitals will expand or contract in the years to come. </p><p> <#> A previous consultation document set out the Board 's criteria for evaluating hospital services, from which hospitals like Downe concluded that they would lose patients. <#> Now they know the worst, and it appears that the biggest losers are the Royal, City and Downe hospitals, while the Mater, Lagan Valley and Ulster hospitals all attain a higher status. </p><p> <#> The Board 's reasoning is that since it becomes a purchaser of services from April 1, it must spend its money where the population will get the maximum benefit. <#> As it has lost out financially, because of changes in funding, it would say there is no alternative to rationalisation of expensive services, while not wanting patients to have to travel too far. </p><p> <#> The result is that the Board will be relying less on the Royal and City and more on outlying hospitals like the Lagan Valley in Lisburn and Ulster in Dundonald, which are easily accessible to people who have moved out of Belfast. <#> It will be up to the two Belfast-based hospitals, which will get self-governing trust status from April, to consider how best they will meet this challenge. <#> Less duplication and perhaps and eventual merger may be on the cards, but their teaching hospital status must be preserved. </p><p> <#> There is no easy answer to the problems facing the hospital service, as medical technology develops new means of treatment at the same time as patients ' expectations grow and funding, in real terms, declines. <#> The Eastern Board is about to put its proposals on the table, which must be anathema for those hospitals and communities which see their services down-graded. </p><p> <#> The protests will continue, and adjustments may still be possible. <#> But the Government 's reform laid down the ground rules, with their concept of a free market in medicine, and it will be difficult to upset them. </p></I><I><W2E-004$E><h> <#> <bold> Killing stakes </bold> </h><p> <#> A year ago this week-end eight Protestant workmen were murdered by the IRA who blew up their minibus at Teebane. <#> It was a sickening atrocity which shocked the province. <#> But it was also a signal for an upsurge in sectarian violence. </p><p> <#> Today we are still reaping the whirlwind of Teebane. <#> Last night a Catholic man was shot dead by loyalists and a Protestant seriously wounded by republicans. <#> The murder of the workmen unleashed the dogs of war. </p><p> <#> The loyalist counter violence - including two multiple murder attacks on bookmakers ' shops in Belfast - demonstrated the new ruthlessness and chilling effectiveness of the restructured UFF and UVF. <#> They have demonstrated their willingness and capacity to equal, indeed outpace, the IRA in the killing stakes. </p><p> <#> Terrorists of whatever hue now know their actions will be answered in kind. <#> Their continued campaigns show that they no longer pretend to de defenders of their respective communities. <#> By their actions they bring only retaliation onto their own streets. </p><p> <#> What can be done to counter the violence? <#> Part of the answer is for the ordinary people to unite against the terrorists. <#> Two women - one Catholic, one Protestant - widowed in Tyrone last week later met to share their grief. <#> They showed they feel the same anguish. <#> Murder is murder, no matter who perpetrates it. </p></I><I><W2E-004$F><h> <#> <bold> Home promotion </bold> </h><p> <#> THE visit of a 40-strong EC team to Londonderry today shows the value of determined self promotion. <#> John Hume has influential contacts in Europe and America and uses them to show to a wider audience the problems facing his native city. </p><p> <#> If there is a criticism, it would be that Mr Hume, as a MEP for the whole province, should have drawn up a wider itinerary for his visitors. <#> Doubtless, though, he would argue that the difficulties of Derry are more acute than in other areas and the self-help initiatives employed to tackle them more innovative. </p><p> <#> The exercise demonstrates the need for Ulster 's politicians to take a more positive international role. <#> Belfast MPs, Cecil Walker and Joe Hendron, proved on their recent visit to America that there are jobs and investment to be found abroad. </p><p> <#> Belfast, whose image has been ill-served by some of its councillors in recent times, is also to engage in a big jobs and tourism promotion, costing <*> pound sign </*> 5m over the next five years. <#> Perhaps more of our politicians are now learning that economic revival is more important than bickering over issues which they cannot influence. </p></I><I><W2E-004$G><h> <#> political column </h><h> <#> <bold> Summit of aspirations </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Emily O'Reilly </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> The taoiseach has set the deadline. <#> By nightfall on December 3rd - or whatever day his summit in Dublin with the British prime minister takes place - we shall know whether the "possibility of peace" is a reality. </bold> </p><p> <#> Throughout Leinster House, politicians are holding their breath. <#> Either Albert Reynolds is naive or, in his 35-minute, completely private meeting with John Major on the margins of the October Brussels summit, he found out something about British government intent to which no one else is privy. </p><p> <#> The northern secretary is resisting the notion of deadlines. <#> He is also resisting the belief of the government in Dublin that any round of talks in the old, 'three-strand' process would be largely futile without a prior cessation of violence. </p><p> <#> Sir Patrick Mayhew wants the talks to begin anyway. <#> If peace flows from that, well and good, he believes. <#> If not, they may still yield other benefits. </p><p> <#> The difference is not one of tactics, or even emphasis. <#> When Mr Reynolds speaks of a cessation of violence, he is speaking in the first instance of a cessation of IRA violence. <#> And he knows that persuasion alone will not win that. </p><p> <#> To get the IRA to stop, it must be given something. <#> And it is that 'something' the British are resisting, through their insistence that a cessation of violence should not be the main priority. </p><p> <#> The taoiseach has already ruled out a British declaration of intent to withdraw by a certain date. <#> He knows it 's not on, and he knows that such a declaration would further inflame a murderously sensitive situation. </p><p> <#> His government does, however, want the British to make a declaration. <#> What this is it will not spell out in public but, at the very least, it wants the British to get off the neutral fence and become proactive in the drive for a solution. </p><p> <#> If the British remain neutral, the republic's government fears that the <italic> status quo </quote> will remain, that the talks will end up in the same cul-de-sac as before - and that violence on both sides will increase. </p><p> <#> Dick Spring 's six principles do not, according to the Sinn F&/ein president, Gerry Adams, address the fundamentals of the Hume-Adams plan. <#> They do not contain a mechanism by which the unionists could be compelled to look for a solution outside the narrow framework of an internal settlement. </p><p> <#> Yet it is clear from government sources in Dublin that the taoiseach and the t&/anaiste realise that just such a dynamic must be part of any new framework for progress worked out by both government. </p><p> <#> One possibility is contained in a draft document from the republic 's side, leaked to me last month. <#> This talks of a <quote> "reciprocal endorsement" </quote> of the constitutional positions of both governments, in which the republic would reaffirm its commitment to the no-change-without-consent principle on the north. <#> In that context, it suggests, the British would <quote> "acknowledge the full legitimacy and value of the goal of Irish unity by consent, cherished by the greater number of people living in Ireland, and the consequential need for practical provisions to give that objective equally meaningful operational expression and opportunity, including in any future structures within Northern Ireland and between North and South" </quote> . </p><p> <#> In public at least, there is no sign that the British want to play ball, despite Mr Major 's honeyed words in the Guildhall. <#> While welcome, from Dublin 's point of view, in tone and emphasis - plus the deliberate use of language similar to that of Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring - the speech contained nothing new. </p><p> <#> Privately, British officials say that their government is not about to join the ranks of the 'persuaders'. <#> This implies that it is content to remain neutral, focus exclusively on the talks process and hope for the best. </p><p> <#> But if John Hume has done nothing else, he has at least convinced the republic 's government that the talks process is insufficient on its own, and that only a separate, British-backed initiative can break the logjam. </p><p> <#> To date, Dublin 's strategy has been to sweet-talk the British and the unionists and risk short-term nationalist alienation for the sake of longer-term nationalist gain. <#> The assurances to the unionists, topped up with a stated willingness to neuter articles 2 and 3, should, they hope, put pressure on the British to reciprocate. </p></I>
