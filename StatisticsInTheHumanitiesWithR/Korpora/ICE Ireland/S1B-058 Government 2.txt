<ICE-IRE:S1B-058 Government 2><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> In relation to uh what Deputy Kenny said no we haven't made any trace uh in relation to that particular area either <#> The position about the staff <,> all the staff that are available uh in the country for the Attorney General 's office have now been interviewed in relation to it and each and every one of them uh has indeed said that uh that they have no knowledge whatsoever <#> There are <,> there were three up to a half an hour ago there 's uh two uh left <#> One will be arriving in Frankfurt at six twenty-five <,> will be on the ground in Frankfurt about six twenty-five uh and the other person is on uh holiday in the west coast of America and the chances of being able to track that person down although we have been on to uh uh a brother and sister that live in Dublin <#> That 's our best effort so far and I have to say that that uh up to now uh that there has been no threat and no member of the staff that has been interviewed can indeed assist in this regard and they say that nothing like that exists or they have no knowledge of it <#> Uh there also I understand has been a statement uh a public statement by the Cardinal to say that uh no such uh letter was ever sent <#> Uh but we will continue to uh inquire from everybody uh the last two remaining people and uh <#> If I believe now that the that the agreement of the House is that we proceed or hopefully proceed with uh the debate at five o'clock and if I have any more up-to-date information by five o'clock I will give you that uh but if I haven't I haven't and uh that 's a matter for the House <#> Here this morning <,> here this morning I was asked <,> I was told not to come back without having <.> be </.> or being in a position to give full details to the House <#> I have to say that I don't have any uh more information than I had the last time I was here and I believed it was uh a strong wish of the House that I should give the full facts and I will give the full facts as I have them when I have them but uh I have to say that that is the position as I have it now<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$B> <#> But <{> <[> I suggest </[> therefore that it is rather pointless for this House to resume at five five o'clock if one of the people the people that has to be interviewed will not be arriving in Frankfurt until six twenty-five <#> So <.> there </.> therefore all of the facts will not presumably be available as you can locate them <#> Uhm could could I ask in terms of uh the people that have been interviewed whether the person who the Taoiseach told us yesterday was the sole official dealing with the file <,> has that person been <.> in </.> <.> in </.> interviewed as yet<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> <[> Proinsias de Rossa </[>

</unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Very well <#> Uh Deputy Mary Harney<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> I 'd like to thank Deputy Bruton <#> Uhm could I ask the Taoiseach if the former Attorney General has been spoken to today <,> and secondly could I ask the <.> Attor </.> the Taoiseach will there be any resignations from his government <#> I notice the Minister for Justice is not here <,> is that significant<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> Is any what significant<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> Do you expect any resignations from your government<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> Uh <,> no I don't <,> <#> Uh in relation to uhm the former Attorney General uh provided the the information uh or <,> as far <,> I I 'll check that out precisely now as to when and what date that information was given and I 'll give it when I come back in at five o'clock<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> Taoiseach was the former Attorney General<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> Well that 's what I 'm saying <#> I want to check that uh I mean it isn't very fair I want to be very careful about it <#> I have to check was it on <,> from his his uh information that what 's in my speech yesterday came or was it from an official <#> <{> <[> I 'll make that I 'll make that clear to you at five o'clock </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> <[> No but what I asked you Taoiseach was was he spoken to </[> </{> <#> Did you speak to the former Attorney General today <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> Or did anybody speak on your behalf<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> No not today no<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> He hasn't been spoken to<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> May I call Deputy John Bruton<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$B> <#> He says that the information has not been turned up in the Attorney General 's office <#> Are any other departments being investigated at this point in time<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> No <,> uh because I think the <.> info </.> the information given here uh was that the supposed uh information was in existence in files in the Attorney General 's office<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$B> <#> That 's not what was said here<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> Well if you <,> I mean I 'll be quite open about this and I hope you could be as open <#> If you could give me any steer <,> any direction <,> any help <,> I will go to whatever Department of State is supposed to be have anything here and I will disclose it in full facts in this House <#> I 'm not in the business of covering up for anybody or hiding anything <#> If you give me any help you have <,> <#> I don't expect you to give me my <,> give your sources as Deputy Rabbitte rightly said <,> but put us in the right direction if you have <,> and if you haven't please withdraw it<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$B> <#> I would <{> <[> expect that the Taoiseach would investigate </[> these circumstances with whatever department is involved in that case directly or indirectly<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> <[> Order I want I I I 'm anxious to call Deputy John Bruton </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> Including the Department of Justice<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$B> <#> Including the Department of Justice<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Can I call Deputy John <{> <[> Bruton </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$E> <#> <[> Sir </[> </{> sir as you will recall and I 'm sure the Taoiseach will too that Fine Gael merely asked a routine query about whether all the officials dealing with the Smyth case uh were <,> had been spoken to to determine the veracity of the statement that no representations were made <#> Now we made no allegations whatever and indeed we have no solid basis for any allegation and never have had <#> We have simply asked the question <,> were the people asked <#> Now what I would like to ask the Taoiseach now is <,> why is it that these people weren't asked these questions <,> which are normal enough questions anyway <,> why the Attorney General before he presented his report to the government <,> why were they we having to ask them all these questions at this stage<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> Pardon<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> That 's a different <,> that 's a different position as I understand it today and if that is the position then I can tell the House quite openly that only one official dealt with the Smyth case <#> One <#> None others <#> But the <.> s </.> what the the the message given to my office by the Whip was a different it wasn't <,> it was a different uh well as I as I if if that information is wrong forget about it <#> Only one official dealt with <,> the Smyth case <,> has been interviewed <,> and that 's it<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$E> <#> Well just to clarify it uh <{> <[> we may </[> save time afterwards by clarifying it now <#> The position is that Deputy Kenny last night simply in as is the case with anybody <.> con </.> pursuing an inquiry would try to look for proofs for any statements that are made <,> asking who was asked to verify whatever statements were made and this was one statement made in the Attorney General 's office <#> That was all <#> Uhm we were not satisfied that the Taoiseach 's answers last night were completely categorical <,> because he said he he would talk about things to his knowledge but he hadn't <,> gone any further than what was to his knowledge and Deputy Kenny 's query today at half past eleven was simply asking the Taoiseach to verify the thing further to go beyond his knowledge and state categorically that no representations had been made <,> that 's all <#> It was simply pinning down what the Taoiseach was saying <#> That was all we were doing uh and I think it 's a it 's an a normal legitimate matter for any Opposition to do we <,> you don't accept anything on face value from anybody in circumstances like this <,> it 's your job to look for the proof<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> <[> Deputy John Bruton </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> Ceann Comhairle<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Yes can <,> let 's not forget the time factor mentioned <#> Uh five o'clock was mentioned <#> There 's been quite an erosion of of that time uh <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> an hour <#> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> an hour <#> Deputy Mary Harney<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$D> <#> Ceann Comhairle <,> Ceann Comhairle I don't understand quite honestly what the Taoiseach has been at all day <#> Could I ask the Taoiseach has he asked for the resignation of any member of the government<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$A> <#> I have not asked for any resignation of any member of the government<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Deputy de Rossa<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$B> <#> Could I could I just ask the Taoiseach if he would clarify why it is that he considers that it would be worthwhile to return here in an hour if he does not expect to have interviewed one of the staff concerned in the Attorney General 's office by six twenty-five and if he has not yet carried out any investigation for instance <,> for instance <,> in relation to the role that may have been played by the Department of Justice in this matter<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$F> <#> Ceann Comhairle just on a point of <{> <[> information </[> for the House and for Deputy de Rossa the Whips met briefly as I said we were in session coming up to four o'clock and we agreed because I understood it was the consensus of the Whips opposite that they wanted this debate to start at five o'clock or in an hour 's time <#> Uhm I outlined <.> t </.> two options to two of the Whips and I 'm not sure if Deputy Rabbitte was in at the time uh that that we would start almost immediately when we got the mechanics of this out of the way <,> that we would start almost immediately but because the Taoiseach hadn't the full information requested in the House earlier this morning that the Minister for Finance would lead on <,> and that the Taoiseach would come into the House when he had that information available but no later than ten o'clock tomorrow or half ten tomorrow morning to explain to the House whether or not he had the information sought <#> That was that was one of the options uh and the other option that I put to the two Whips uh was that we would start uh we would adjourn because we haven't the information available <,> that we would adjourn until ten thirty tomorrow morning and we would start the formal confidence debate and I I I think the two Whips opposite can confirm that <#> They were two options and I said if the opposition have a third option or another option let them put it forward <#> When <,> I had to leave the room for approximately three or four minutes and when I came back in it was my clear understanding from what was said although it was a rushed conversation that the three Whips had agreed that the debate the confidence debate should start this evening and that the Taoiseach should come in to lead off on that debate and uh explain whatever information he had uh at <,> when he started and to make it quite clear uh what exactly he had now <#> That 's my understanding <#> If I 'm wrong somebody tell me<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> <[> Minister of State </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Order order <#> Deputy Enda Kenny<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$F> <#> Somebody who was actually in the room when we made the<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$C> <#> Deputy Enda Kenny has been called <,> <#> Deputy Enda Kenny<ICE-IRE:S1B-058$G> <#> Ceann Comhairle <,> uh first of all I want to say this <#> This party is very anxious that there will be no disruption of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation uh developments which which is due to meet on Friday <#> Now uh this is a motion of confidence in the government and it will be expected by everybody in the House here that the motion will be led off by the Taoiseach as leader of the government and the Whips were anxious uh that at the commencement of this motion of confidence that the lead-off speaker would be the Taoiseach <#> As the uh Whips' meeting so has not absolutely concluded we would be uh we would be anxious that the debate would commence with the Taoiseach leading off <#> We would be anxious to have uh a recess after his speech in order to assimilate the importance of it and if uh and when the three remaining people from the Attorney General 's office are interviewed and have been interviewed by the Taoiseach 's personnel we would be uh <.> facil </.> we would facilitate uh the extra information if any that is available from those three people being given to the House here during the course of the debate <,> and I think that 's a matter that the Whips can organise uh subsequent to the adjournment here <#> But as I said <,> we 're anxious that this matter would be cleared up finally before Friday 's meeting of the uh Forum for Peace and Reconciliation</I>
