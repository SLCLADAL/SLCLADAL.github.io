<W2C-014 Clare Champion><I><W2C-0141$A><h> <bold> <#> KILRUSH ROCKED BY LEADMORE CLOSURE </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> WEST Clare, and Kilrush in particular, was dealt another body low this week with the closure of ice cream manufacturers, Leadmore Dairies, with the loss of forty jobs. </bold> </p><p> <it> <#> Thirty employees at the Kilrush production plant and a further ten at their Cork distribution depot were made redundant last Friday and a meeting of Leadmore 's creditors has been fixed for Thursday next, December 22.</it> </p><p> <#> This latest setback for Kilrush has prompted local public representatives to make an urgent appeal to Shannon Development and other state agencies to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the industry is saved. </p><p> <#> Competition and weather related factors were blamed by a company spokesman for the problems which led to the closure of Leadmore Dairies which has been in operation since 1946. <#> However, he stressed that the company would continue to trade for the moment with agents distributing their ice cream and frozen food products from existing stocks. </p><p> <#> The spokesman said the company had been forced to make their employees redundant after negotiations with a potential buyer fell through. <#> But, he hastened to add, there were ongoing negotiations with two other prospective buyers and he was hopeful that a deal could be struck with one of them to keep the long established industry going in West Clare. </p><p> <#> Kilrush U.D.C. Chairman, Gerry O'Malley, summed up the feelings of townspeople when he described the closure of Leadmore Dairies as a <quote> "real tragedy". </quote> <#> He said it was a terrible blow for the thirty employees and their families coming so close to Christmas. <#> Mr. O'Malley also expressed his regret at the loss of the other jobs at the company 's Cork base. </p><p> <#> <quote> "The closure of leadmore Dairies marks the end of an era for Kilrush", </quote> said Mr. O'Malley. <#> <quote> "The company provided good employment for many people since 1946". </quote> </p><p> <#> The Council Chairman said the latest round of job losses in Kilrush represented a cut of five per cent in the town 's industrial employment base. <#> He said that if the proposed E.S.B. rationalisation programme was implemented, with the net effect of 200 job losses at Moneypoint, West Clare could be labelled an industrial blackspot. </p><p> <#> Mr. O'Malley said that every possible effort should be made to secure a new owner for the company. <#> He believed that Leadmore Dairies had enormous potential if new products were developed and new markets opened up. </p><p> <#> The Council Chairman appealed to business people in the area to show their support for Leadmore by continuing to buy their products which were being distributed by agents from stock. </p><p> <#> A Shannon Development spokesman said they were doing everything possible to facilitate a takeover of Leadmore by a new owner. <#> He expressed the hope that a deal could be sealed with one of two interested parties. <#> The spokesman said the possibility of getting Leadmore involved in a joint venture with another company could also be considered and this would involve diversifying into a new range of products aimed at a different area of the ice cream market from that which they had traditionally serviced. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile Clare Co. Council suspended standing orders on Monday to discuss an emergency motion which sought the immediate intervention of the Government in averting the closure of the Kilrush plant. </p><p> <#> Describing the announcement of the job losses <quote> "as a black day for West Clare", </quote> Fianna Fail councillor Bill Chambers tabled the motion, unanimously adopted, which called on the Government, the I.D.A. and Shannon development to come up with a rescue package to save Leadmore Dairies. </p><p> <#> His views were endorsed by fellow party member, Patrick Keane, who said that the loss of thirty jobs in Kilrush was comparable to the loss of three hundred jobs in cities like Cork and Dublin. <#> <quote> "It 's important that the Government and some other state agencies step in and save the jobs at the Kilrush plant", </quote> he remarked. </p><p> <#> Kilrush councillor, Tom Prendeville, said that his immediate reaction to the close of the factory was one of deep regret and disappointment. <#> Leadmore Dairies prided itself in the abiding loyalty and great sense of cooperation that existed between workers and management in this family-owned entreprise right up to the closure announcement last Friday. </p><p> <#> Leadmore Dairies was one of the most successful ventures ever undertaken by the Glynn family in Kilrush. <#> Close on sixty people were employed there during the high season and represented a huge injection of <*> pound sign </*> 1 million annually into the local economy through wages and services. </p><p> <#> However, he said the closure wasn't totally unexpected. <#> In recent months various factors had militated against the continued commercial viability of he operation. <#> Despite increased marketing emphasis, sales of ice cream products had remained static, a matter not helped by poor weather, the impact of cheap imported ice cream products, depressed profit margins and ever tightening credit controls. </p><p> <#> <quote> "The closure of Leadmore Dairies is another body blow to the economy of West Clare which is still reeling from the fallout effects of the closure of Woodfab, Ceremacis, Glynn 's Mills and the threat of job cutbacks through the E.S.B. rationalisation plan at Moneypoint", </quote> he commented. </p><p> <#> Cllr. Prendeville said that there still remained <quote> "a slight glimmer of hope" </quote> that the Leadmore Dairies factory could be sold as a going concern and in that event some of the jobs lost last Friday could be salvaged under a new consortium. </p><p> <#> Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn has described the loss of 40 jobs at Leadmore Dairies as a <quote> "tragedy" </quote> and a major economic setback to Kilrush. <#> It was also a family disaster for the Glynn family who have been good employers in the town, she said. </p><p> <#> She said that every effort must now be made to find a purchaser or arrange a joing venture between different parties to take over the operation of Leadmore Dairies which had been very successful in the past. <#> All agencies, private and semi-private, would also have to give every backing possible to rescue the plant and ensure that the jobs were put back in place. </p><p> <#> <quote> "The people and the areas cannot survive such a setback, in addition to the 200 jobs already under threat at Moneypoint Power Station", </quote> said Senator Taylor-Quinn. </p></I><I><W2C-0141$B><h> <bold> <#> Flash Floods After Deluge </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> A number of homes were flooded in Bridgetown and Ennistymon and traffic was disrupted on a number of roads around the county as a result of Tuesday morning 's deluge. </bold> </p><p> <#> Fortunately the flash floods, which followed from the half inch of rain that fell in a matter of hours, had subsided by Tuesday evening and everything was back to normal. </p><p> <#> However, three families in Bridgetown and one in Ennistymon have been left to count the cost of the heavy rain as their properties were damaged by flooding. <#> The houses on the outskirts of Sourth East Clare village were flooded to a depth of over a foot when water cascaded off the land and Killaloe Fire Brigade was called to deal with the emergency. </p><p> <#> In Ennistymon, Bill and May Chapman 's two hundred year old Connell 's Cottage home at Deerpark, was flooded to a depth of two feet when a <}> <-> steam </-> <+> stream </+> </}> to the rear of their home burst its banks. <#> The local fire brigade had to pump out the house. </p><p> <#> While there was minor flooding on some roads and a number of motorists ran into difficulties when their cars stalled, Gardai reported no major problems. </p><p> <#> A considerable amount of farmland, particularly in the North Clare area was also hit by the flooding, creating problems with foddering livestock for some farmers. </p></I><I><W2C-014$C><h> <bold> <italics> <#> Patients Test Positive in Hepatitis Screen </bold> </italics> </h><p> <bold> <#> FIVE of the patients who attended the Hepatitis B screening programme at Limerick Regional Hospital on Friday last have tested positive for infection, according to a statement issued by the Mid-Western Health Board on Wednesday. </bold> </p><p> <#> Out of a total of 1,520 patients, mainly from the Clare/Limerick area, who were contacted by the Health Board, 407 attended the screening programme and the five patients who tested positive have been contacted to reattend for further tests. </p><p> <#> The screening programme was ordered after Dr. Umesh Gaud who worked in five Irish hospitals during the late 1980s was convicted in London last October for practising while knowingly concealing the fact that he suffered from Hepatitis B. <#> He is now serving a jail sentence in Britain. </p><p> <#> Dr. Gaud had worked in the Accident and Emergency Department at the Regional Hospital, Limerick for six months in 1987. </p><p> <#> However, Regional Hospital General Manager, Ian Carter said this week that there was still no evidence that Dr. Gaud had caused any infection to any of the hospital 's patients during his stay in Limerick. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile, the screening programme continues at the Regional Hospital this week and the special Helpline 1800-512500 is available to the public between 9.30 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. </p><p> <#> Results of tests are made available within 48 hours. </p></I><I><W2C-014$D><h> <bold> <h> Drink Law Hitting Rural Communities </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> Rural communities are now prisoners in their homes and are afraid to venture out because of the draconian penalties attached to the Road Traffic Act, said the Vintners ' Federation of Ireland when discussing plans to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday next to review the new drink-driving level which has caused a huge drop in trade in many pubs all over the country. </bold> </p><p> <#> For the second week-end in a row, Clare publicans were hit by the new law and they spoke of bleak times ahead for the rural pub, particularly over the Christmas and New Year periods. </p><p> <#> The new drink-driving limit and penalties have sparked off the biggest ever crisis in the VFI, said <}> <-> it 's </-> <+> its </+> </}> president Michael Moloney of Ruan, who forecast that many pubs will close and thousand of jobs will be lost over the tougher drink driving regulations. <#> Publicans and members of the public were expressing fear, anger and frustration. </p><p> <#> The VFI, which represents 6,000 pub owners outside of Dublin, has not been sitting back and has highlighted the implications of the new restrictions over the past number of months, said Mr. Moloney. <#> He added that their warnings, however, were not listened to. </p><p> <#> The VFI President described national advertising advising motorists to use Dart and bus services as offensive to people in rural areas who could not avail of such services. <#> He had already made contact with the Bus Eireann operations manager in Dublin to provide extra and later bus services in country areas. <#> He was told, however, that they did not intend providing such services. </p><p> <#> <quote> "This is disgraceful and the Government should put pressure on them to provide them", </quote> said Mr. Moloney. </p><p> <#> He also called on the legislators to reduce the fines for drink-driving offences and said that the new regulations would also be a big blow to tourism as when visitors arrived in country areas they would find no shops, no Garda station, no post office and no pub. </p><p> <#> VFI chief executive Tadgh O'Sullivan, also contacted the Ministers for the Environment and Justice this week, expressing their concern. <#> He said there was no public transport in rural Ireland - not even taxis or cabs. <#> The national safety council 's adverts only served to further annoy the community. </p><p> <#> <quote> "The fact that a person who has consumed two pints is deemed as guilty, with mandatory penalties, as someone who has consumed 20 pints, is unacceptable", </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> He forecast that deaths on the roads will increase over Christmas and said that the new legislation would bring loss of life as well as loss of jobs as they would have people walking and cycling on dark country roads who would be the victims of those speeding, untouched by the law. </p><p> <#> He called for action to modify the penalties: give discretion to the courts in place of mandatory penalties: allow a more reasonable approach by gardai (stopping people on the way to work must cease) and provide much needed public transport in rural areas. </p></I><I><W2C-0141$E><h> <bold> <#> Schoolgirl dies in road tragedy </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> THERE was widespread sympathy for the family of Lissycasey schoolgirl who was killed in a traffic accident on the main Ennis to Kilrush Road last week-end. </bold> </p><p> <#> Eleven year old Joan Melican, Decomade, Lissycasey, died instantly following a collision with a passing car as she made her way to Lissycasey National School. <#> The accident happened a short distance from her home just before 9.30 a.m. on Friday morning. </p><p> <#> Joan was the youngest member of a family of six and she is survived by her parents, Patrick and Peggy, her four sisters and one brother. </p><p> <#> There were huge attendances at both the removal of remains from Normoyles Funeral Home on Saturday evening to the local church and at the funeral on Sunday. <#> Joan 's schoolmates at Lissycasey school and members of the local GAA club formed a guard of honour on both days. </p></I>
