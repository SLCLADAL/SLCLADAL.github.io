<ICE-IRE:S1B-050 Trinity students><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> Student affairs <,> including clubs and societies <,> are administered by five groups <,,> the Students ' Union <,> the Graduate Students ' Union <,> The Publications Committee <,> DUCAC <,> and the Central Societies Committee <,> who mainly control the cash <#> The CSC has a budget approaching one hundred and seventy thousand pounds for its eighty plus societies <#> Its chairperson is Mary Butler<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> It 's actually <,> what you might call the governing body of all the student societies in Trinity <#> It has various functions <,> basically administration and that <#> We seek our capitation fee from the Capitation Committee <,> and then distribute that fairly between the ninety student societies here in Trinity <#> We also provide facilities <,> for the societies up here in our offices <#> And <,> act of <,> what you might call court of appeal if any disputes arrive arise <,> between societies or <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[> So you 're </[> </{> in a very <,> lofty position then<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> You could call it that I <{> <[> guess </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[> I mean </[> </{> you give out the cash<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> We do indeed yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> What facilities do you offer<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> Ehm as you can see from the outside office we have <,> a number of computers <,> telephone lines <,> a fax machine <,> photocopying <,> stuff like that <,> which are practical facilities for the societies <#> We also provide we 've staff members who help do up posters or invitations anything that societies may need to help them function in their day-to-day activities <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> And uhm <,> what sort of interest do the students themselves have in this<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> In the societies <{1> <[1> are they </[1> <,> <#> There actually is a great interest <#> I think <,> every student going through college will at some stage <,> join at least one society <,> if not more <#> I think Freshers ' Week <,> is a great week where first years probably join about ten societies and then decide after one year <,> weedle out the ones they 're interested in <,> <#> <{2> <[2> Uh </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[2> What </[2> </{2> do you think are the most famous societies <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> Uhm <,> I suppose historically <,> the Philosophical Society and the Historical Society<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> What do you think are the liveliest societies <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> Well the Science Fiction Society would be one of our largest and most <,> probably one of our most active<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> In your experience Mary what sort of student comes to Trinity <#> How would you describe the <,,> kind of <,> typical Trinity student<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> I think the image of <.> Trin </.> the Trinity student has changed a lot throughout the years <#> I think now there 're more <#> I think if you go into any school around <,> the Dublin area or around the country <,> pick any student <,> they could be a <.> s </.> a Trinity student <#> I I don't think there is a typical Trinity student <{> <[> anymore </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[> Yet the </[> </{> perception 's often that Trinity is a fairly posh expensive middle-class institution<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$B> <#> Well this is it <#> This is the perception <#> I think that 's being reinforced somewhat by <,> you know <,,> even now the the the promotion of the Trinity student being a very posh student <#> I don't think that 's the case <#> In my class alone I 'd say <,> the majority are working-class students <#> And I think that is the case throughout Trinity as a whole now <#> It 's it 's not no longer <,> a posh upper-class student<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> Hello <#> This is Jimmy Smith the <,> famous Clare hurler <#> How are you Jimmy<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$C> <#> Very good thanks Brendan <,> <#> <{> <[> Nice to meet you </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[> Well what 're you </[> </{> doing in college<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> Well I 'm I 'm back after thirty-five years in the wilderness <,> back doing Philosophy <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> And you 're enjoying <{> <[> it </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> I love it yeah <#> <{> <[> It 's grand to be back </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[> Are you a member of </[> </{> any society yourself<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$C> <#> I 'm not really <#> Now I 'm joining the the Hurling Club here <#> I see and I 've decided to join it <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> That brings <{> <[> back memories alright </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$C> <#> <[> That brings </[> </{> back memories <#> Yeah it does <#> It 's nice to see these fellas coming in from the country in here and doing it in their spare time <#> There 's a lot of hard work here <,> and this 'd be a great kind of sideline for them during the course of the year<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> You chose a fairly difficult <{> <[> subject but I <,> </[> I suppose a good hurler is capable of doing anything<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$C> <#> <[> Ah it 's very I <unclear> words </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$C> <#> Well you see when you 're training for a number of years and you you <.> ev </.> <.> ev </.> every hurler is a philosopher in his own way <#> Because everybody you see and uh you meet on the pitch <,> you have to <.> s </.> you have to size them up <#> You have to know what they 're thinking <#> You have to see them <,> you have to know what they 're thinking before they actually get to the ball<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$D> <#> Man is a very young fresher <,> just trying to get him to join hurling and football clubs like you know <#> He 's from Wexford so he 's probably no good but we 'll sign him up anyway like <,> you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> Which part of Wexford are you from<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$E> <#> I 'm from <,> outside New Ross called Campile<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> And is uh is uh football popular there<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$E> <#> Oh it 's fairly fairly popular yeah <#> GAA is very you know <,> it 's doing well like <,> you know what I mean <#> It 's uh <,> it 's a fairly good club down there alright<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> And what 're you going to <.> pl </.> <,> what <,> which club are you going to join here<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$E> <#> Oh I 'll join the both of them and be damned you know uh sort of <{> <[> <,> the </[> hurling and football club<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> <[> Did you </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> You might get a game with either the <{> <[> football or the hurling club </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$E> <#> <[> It 's uh you never </[> </{> know you know <#> It 's uh <#> There you go lads<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$D> <#> We 've got the we 've got the League Cup here the University League which we 've won for the last two years <,> and which is a great uh achievement for Trinity like because before that uh the club was uh <,> you know it it was struggling to survive <#> We <.> ne </.> we didn't have the the members <#> Uh it 's only in the last few years Mr Kennelly 'll tell you when he came to college <,> there was there was a very small take <#> But in the last few years we 've got far more members <#> And we we ended up beating UCD <,> which for any Trinity team is the ultimate in success <#> No matter what you win <,> if you beat UCD <,> that <,> I mean that is uh that is heaven <#> And we beat UCD in the in the Fitzgibbon Shield two years ago <,> and uh it was probably the greatest achievement uh on the field that the club has ever had<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$F> <#> I 've just signed up to the fencers <,> the college fencers <,> who I didn't know about <#> I never knew there was fencers until <,> a couple of weeks ago and I was <&> laughs </&> when I was looking them up to help to be involved in this thing that I 'm doing at the moment a a thing for players a show for players <#> And uhm <,> I went down and they had so much fun doing it <#> And there was actually a <.> wim </.> uh a woman running the thing and she 's been running it for the last six years<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$G> <#> I used the weight room facility in college for exercising <#> I exercise from physiotherapy that I had to do <,> <#> And that 's a terrifly <&> mispronounces </&> male-dominated <#> To go into the gym then there I <,> the stink of male sweat as <&> laughs </&> soon as you open the door <#> And then after that it 's there 's there 's uh burly men there lifting weights <#> And I mean women really are looked as <,> <#> You you 're told to use the weight machines because really you 're only down here for toning your muscles<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$?> <#> DUCAC ahm <,> the the retreat for every man in college who feels he 's being harassed or intimidated by us women <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> DUCAC <,> that sweating centre of males <,> happily harassed by women <,> is administered by Cathy Doyle one of the most popular staff members in Trinity <#> Cathy talks to Maura Lee about the Central Athletic Committee<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> The initials <,> DUCAC stand for <,> Dublin University Central Athletic Committee <,> and it is a committee of around twenty people <,> made up of students and members of staff at the college<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$I> <#> Where does DUCAC get its funds from<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> DUCAC gets <,> most of its funds <,> from the Capitation Committee in college <#> When the students come into college <,> as well as paying their fees <,> they pay a capitation fee which is approximately fifty pounds <#> All these fifty pounds go into a fund <,> administered by the Capitation Committee <,> and that money is distributed among five bodies in Trinity <,> of which DUCAC is one<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$I> <#> So basically DUCAC uhm administers funds and controls the clubs <,> the sporting clubs in college <#> Is that it<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> We don't actually control them <,> but we <,> they come to us <#> They apply to DUCAC for grants <,> so that they can hold their fixtures so they can travel away to <,> on tours <,> uhm so that they can host visiting teams in Trinity <,> so that they could either go to intervarsities <,> or host intervarsities <,> <#> And they apply to us for funds <#> Our committee of twenty people sit down and we discuss the grants <,> and decide how the money is going to be spent <#> And then the clubs come back to see how well they got on or how well they didn't get on <#> <&> laughs </&> And I administer the money uh distribute it to the to the clubs<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$I> <#> So you 're a fairly important lady if you control the money <,> the purse strings<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> They think I am <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$I> <#> And which are the bigger clubs <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> The swimming club is the <,> for the last few years has been the biggest club <#> For some reason swimming is very very popular<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$I> <#> I would 've thought maybe the football club might 've <{> <[> been the biggest </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> <[> The <,> the </[> </{> football club is a big club <,> <#> It 's one of the older clubs as well in the <,> in <.> ge </.> in the college<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$I> <#> Is it something to do with being around young people that you enjoy<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> I think that 's it <#> Yeah I do enjoy being round young people <,> <#> The one thing I <,> find very <,> ah maybe unusual isn't the word <,> difficult maybe <,> is that the majority of people that are there are only there for four years <,> <#> So if you have made very good friends of some students unfortunately they 're gone <#> Now we do <,> people I have got friendly with and maybe they 've gone to America and things like that they would still <,> contact me when they come back into Dublin and things like that <#> And we would meet <#> But it 's not maybe like in a workplace <,> where <,> you 'd be working with the same people for fourteen years or fifteen years <#> There is a turnover all the time of students<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$I> <#> Do you see much of a change in the students over the years<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$H> <#> Uh they 're more sophisticated <#> They seem to be more <#> I feel they 're more dress-conscious <#> I also think they are more studious <#> That they had to work so hard to get into college in the first instance I feel they seem to worry more about their exams <#> In the first term <,> that is sort of October to December <,> it 's not important at all <#> Second term maybe they realise <,> hey I 've done nothing this year <#> And then when third term comes you don't see them at all <#> Uhm <,> they realise <,> I 've exams in May you know <,> I 'd better get the head down <#> Where I think maybe ten years ago <,> the pressure on exams and that <,> that wasn't there <&> music </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-050$A> <#> Colm O'Dwyer you 're the Entertainments Officer of the Students ' Union <#> Uh <,> what precisely do you do<ICE-IRE:S1B-050$J> <#> I run uh <,> pretty much all the student entertainment that goes on in the college <,> that 's the uhm <,> the concerts we 'd have in The Buttery <,> which is pretty much every night of the week <,> all the Balls throughout the year <,> and then I 'd <,> be in charge I 'm Music Officer for the Trinity Ball <,> so I 'd organise that end of things for that</I>
