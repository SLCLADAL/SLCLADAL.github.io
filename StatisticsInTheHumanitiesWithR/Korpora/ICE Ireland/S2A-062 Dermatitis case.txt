<ICE-IRE:S2A-062 Dermatitis case><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> If it please Your Lordship My Lord I appear for the plaintiff <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-062$B> <#> If it please Your Lordship My Lord I appear for the defendant<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> My Lord the plaintiff is a thirty-six year old process worker employed by the defendant in a factory in Lurgan and he uh contracted dermatitis in the course of uh that employment <#> The defendant <,> Your Lordship is probably aware <,> manufactures various uh components for use <,> for medical purposes <#> The <,> formerly the the <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in Lurgan <#> The plaintiff has worked in various departments in the factory <,> first under uh as <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and then as Rush manufacturing since the early nineteen eighties <#> He 's been there approximately fifteen years <,> <#> For approximately five years starting in the early nineteen nineties the plaintiff was working at a particular process which involved the the use of plasticised PVC pastes to make plastic funnels uh which were used for uh in the manufacture of uh stomach or tracheostomy tubes <#> I 'm handing up to Your Lordship uh a set of photographs <,> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> <#> If Your Lordship looks at uh photograph number one you 'll see some plastic bags which uh uh contain the finished product <#> You 'll see some <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> <[> Sorry I 'm not finding it easy </[> </{> to follow exactly what you 're saying Mr McCorry <#> Would you please try to speak up<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> I beg Your Lordship 's pardon <#> The end product is contained in the uh plastic bag<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> Small green plastic funnels<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> You see some of them laid out on the the actual table either side of the guillotine which is used to trim them <#> That would be at the final stage in the process<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> The work also involved the use of methylated spirits uh in order to clean the equipment<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> And during the entire process My Lord the plaintiff 's hands would have been wet<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> Now if I could describe the th' actual process to Your Lordship<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> At the time material to the action <,> it was carried out in a small room which measured twenty-seven feet by twenty-one feet <#> At various stages uh it was carried out in different rooms Your Lordship but at the time uh when the plaintiff contracted this rash it was uh in this particular room <#> That room is now used as a storeroom <#> You 'll see it in photograph number six <#> If Your Lordship looks at photograph number two you 'll see the room in which the process is presently carried out <#> That 's not the room that the plaintiff would have been working in when he contracted the rash <#> But the equipment and the <.> pro </.> uh <,> used <,> and the the process that followed would have been the same<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> Now basically Your Lordship the the plaintiff would take a a steel mould which is made up of nail-like pins set into the frame <,> and if Your Lordship looks at photograph number two you 'll see that to the uh centre left there 's a stool and sitting on the stool there is a a one of the frames containing the pins which actually <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> the mould<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> That is put into a an oven in order to heat it<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> The ovens are those blue uh structures in the in the photograph <#> When the mould is taken out of the <,> of the oven it 's mounted in a frame which is situated over a tank of plasticised paste <,> <#> Now if Your Lordship looks at photograph number three you 'll see the uh tank containing <,> the tank containing containing the plasticised paste and suspended above it is the uh the mould <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> Those pins are immersed in the tank for approximately fifteen seconds <,> and basically what happens is that the pins become coated in the paste <#> The entire mould is then removed and is placed in one of the ovens for curing <#> That takes about three minutes <,> <#> After curing it 's removed from the oven and it 's placed in a water tank which is shown in photograph number uh four <#> Now Your Lordship may actually have photograph number four a <,> there was apparently there was some confusion <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> return the photograph but it basically shows the same thing uh <,> Your Your Lordship will see in that photograph a large stainless steel tank of water and you 'll see the uhm the frame containing the uh pins sitting above that water <#> Immersed in the water tank <,> that pool <,> the uh the mould and the uh and the cured uh funnels <,> then placed above the uh the tank in the way shown in photograph number four to allow the water to run off <#> And then the final stage in the process as shown in photograph number one the plaintiff takes the the the funnel off the mould and at that table he would use the guillotine to uh to trim them <#> Now at that stage Your Lordship they would still be wet <#> Whilst the plaintiff <,> is carrying out that trimming <,> there would be another batch of uh uh uh of funnels in one of the ovens so it 's an on-going process and the plaintiff 's hands would be wet throughout that process<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> Now in addition to this Your Lordship the plaintiff has to top the tank up with PVC paste uh in the mornings and uh at various stages throughout the day <#> And the first thing that he would do when he starts work in the morning is that he would take the paste out of an open drum <#> He takes it out using the jug shown in photograph number five <,> just an ordinary plastic jug <,> pours it from the jug into a a plastic bucket <,> and again it 's just an ordinary plastic bucket which you 'll see at the bottom right of photograph photograph number two<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> It 's then placed in a vacuum in order to take the air bubbles out of it and then <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S2A-062$C> <#> <[> In a what </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S2A-062$A> <#> Into a vacuum <,> in order to remove the air bubbles <,> and then the plaintiff would use the jug to remove paste from the bucket and top up the tank throughout the day <#> Unfortunately he would get the uh plastic <,> plastic paste onto his hands <,,> <#> And the other substance with which he 'd come into contact is the methylated spirits and you would use that to clean the various uh components <,> his equipment <#> He 's not doing that so regularly as he did from time to time My Lord <,,> <#> The plaintiff 's working hours were from seven thirty to four thirty on Monday to Thursday with a fifteen minute uh morning break and a forty-five minute uh lunch break <#> On Friday he would work from seven thirty to twelve thirty and in addition to that he would regularly have worked overtime <#> By way of protective clothing he was provided with uh a white coat which was closed at the wrists <,> and he also wore a hat <,> disposable type hat <#> Now the plaintiff uh didn't wear the white coat all the time <#> It was generally worn uh when he was carrying out this process in uh uh another room which was known as the clean room <#> At the time when the plaintiff was working <unclear> several sylls </unclear> was working in uh the room in which he contracted the uh the rash he in fact was wearing no <.> ru </.> uh coat at all and would have been working in a T-shirt <,> <#> The plaintiff never wore gloves whilst he was carrying out this process <#> He 'd been taught the process by uh another uh process worker in the factory uh and that man hadn't worn gloves either <#> No-one ever told the plaintiff that he should wear gloves <#> And the case would be that the supervisors would have saw him constantly at work and would have been aware that no gloves were worn <#> At no stage was it suggested to him that he should wear gloves <,> <#> Good washing and drying facilities were provided in the main factory uh toilets and washrooms uh approximately thirty yards away from uh the room in which the plaintiff worked <#> But there were no drying facilities whatsoever uh in the the room where he actually carried out the process <,> and given the nature of the job and the fact that it 's a continuous process <,> it wasn't feasible for the plaintiff to be going back and forward all day uh uh in order to dry his hands <#> The result was that his hands therefore were constantly wet <,,> <#> The defendant furnished the uh safety data sheet relating to the various substances with which the plaintiff had come into contact with <,> namely the methylated spirits and the <,> the PVC paste <,> <#> These show My Lord that the the paste is a a mild skin irritant and it 's recommended that gloves be worn and in fact a particular type of glove is mentioned <,> uh neoprene <,> N E O P R E N E gloves <#> The manufacturers recommend that when one 's working with this substance uh neoprene gloves uh should be worn <#> The plaintiff first noticed a a rash on his right hand and that would have been during the first half of nineteen ninety-three <#> He did nothing about it at that stage My Lord because it was of no great significance and it didn't appear to be getting any worse so he basically left it and continued on working <#> In the early part and in the middle part of nineteen ninety-four the rash became much worse <#> It involved both hands and it spread up the forearms to the elbows <#> He 'd been at Craigavon Hospital at that time uh on his general practitioner 's referral <#> It was also noted at that time that he 'd a rash on his scalp <,> <#> When the plaintiff uh drew the defendant 's attention to the rash he was sent then to uh Dr Adams the uh defendant 's <,> the factory doctor <,> and uh he diagnosed a contact dermatitis and directed that the plaintiff be moved to another job and that happened the plaintiff has moved to a clean dry job in the factory <,> <#> And when he was moved the the rash significantly improved <#> The current situation is that he would experience uh flare-ups which at the present time would be occurring perhaps every six to seven weeks <#> They 'd last a week or so when they come and the plaintiff can treat them himself using uh a <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> uh cream <#> He took just two weeks off work <,> special damages are agreed at two hundred and fifty pounds <,> <#> Evidence is to be given <.> b </.> for the plaintiff by Dr Eadie a consultant dermatologist at Craigavon Area Hospital who has diagnosed an an irritant contact dermatitis <,> caused by the wet work and the constant exposure to the paste the the uh plasticised paste and to methylated spirits <,> <#> The defendants were put on notice uh My Lord of the intention to apply for leave to amend the uh Statement of Claim <,> <#> It 's a very minor amendment My Lord and the intention of it was to uh uh add uh methylated spirits to the list of offending substances <#> Now I had directed in fact that uh <.> pa </.> paragraph three should read uh uh <,> at the fifth line should read contact with plasticised PVC paste <,> methylated spirits and water <#> Now unfortunately it has not methylated spirits hasn't been inserted there <#> I 'd also directed that it be inserted in the Particulars of Negligence and uh if Your Lordship turns up the page you 'll see that it was added at that point <#> So although it wasn't put in at paragraph number three it does appear on the uh Particulars of Negligence and the plaintiff has therefore noted that uh it is alleged that the methylated spirits played a role in the plaintiff <,> our plaintiff 's condition</I>
