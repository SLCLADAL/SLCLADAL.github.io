<ICE-IRE:S2B-010 BBC NI><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-010$A> <#> Speaking at the scene of the attack in Newry this afternoon the Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew said the IRA don't care who they kill or maim<&> Sir Patrick Mayhew speaks </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-010$A> <#> The Catholic Primate Cardinal Cahal Daly has said the IRA 's campaign is morally evil and sinful <#> In his first response to Sinn Fe/in 's rejection of the Downing Street Declaration Dr Daly said it was a tragedy for Republicans that the process of shaping a new political future seems set to proceed without them<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> Well joining me now live from our outside broadcast unit in Newry is the Presbyterian Moderator Dr David McGaughey <#> Good evening Moderator<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$C> <#> Good evening<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> Uh despite the the number of injuries and the fact that some of them were serious Newry must be giving thanks today that it wasn't a lot worse<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$C> <#> Well certainly when I visited the police station this morning and saw what the mortars had done to the station <,> and also to the uh outside buildings <,> I feel it is a miracle that more people were not injured and certainly some people were not killed <#> It 's a miracle <#> I think it 's uh <,> but for the grace of God there would have been a lot more casualties<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> What message do you think the IRA is sending with this attack in a week when Gerry Adams has been insisting that the peace process as he calls it is alive and well<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$C> <#> Well it would seem to me that they 're sending a message that they 're not really interested in peace <#> A couple of days ago there was a policeman 's car had a booby trap bomb under it in Newcastle <#> I think it was yesterday the forces were attacked in Belfast and now we have this terrible attack in Newry this morning <#> And surely they 're saying through this that they 're not really interested in peace <#> They 're talking peace <,> but uh with their hands <,> they 're going out to shed innocent blood<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> Well Sinn Fe/in 's Martin McGuinness has said Sinn Fe/in is trying to create the conditions in which attacks like these would become a thing of the past<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$C> <#> Surely <.> i </.> if we are going to create conditions uh for peace <,> then the very first thing that we should do is to stop the violence <#> There can't be real peace until violence and all violence is stopped <,> because uhm <,> without that there can be no <,> talking together <,> there can be no uh planning for the future and I believe that violence of all types and descriptions has to stop before peace can be established<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> You 've accused the Government of reneging on its promise to clamp down on terrorism if the Downing Street Declaration failed to put an end to violence <,> but realistically what more can the Government do<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$C> <#> Well I am not a security uh advisor <,> but I understand uh in December the prime ministers did say that there would be a massive clampdown on terrorism if the peace process uh was uh rejected <,> and uh <,> I <.> wou </.> would feel that they only said that because up until that moment uh and since then <,> uh they haven't been really targeting the terrorists uh as we might have expected them to do so <#> And I would hope that uh as the terrorists have shown now that they 've no real interest in peace that the government will take strong measures and will ensure that uh people who are killing and maiming are removed from our society so that those of us who want to live in peace together can indeed uh do this <#> I believe that this morning we had a criminal act <#> This was a crime to me <,> as uh innocent people were injured <,> uh both in the security forces and in the civilian population<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> Dr McGaughey thank-you very much for joining us this evening<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$A> <#> The headlines this evening <#> Forty-four people are injured in an IRA mortar bomb attack in Newry <#> Sir Patrick Mayhew says we have to be thankful people weren't killed by the dozen <#> And coming later the thousands who queued for tea and buns with Donegal 's famous son<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> Two people died in a fire at a flat in Ballymena this morning despite the efforts of local people to save them <#> Police say the cause of the fire is not yet known <#> Paul Waters reports<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$D> <#> The fire took the lives of thirty year old Kenneth McPeake of Ballykeele estate in the town <,> and twenty year old Margaret Elizabeth Wilson who lived in the flat above a kitchen furniture shop on the corner of Mount Street and Thomas Street <#> Flames and smoke were spotted coming from the windows on the first floor around a quarter to seven this morning<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$E> <#> I looked over and that whole place there was burning <,> and uh I said to my husband the place is on fire over there <#> And uh <,> then the next thing there was a big bang you know and <,> this was <.> if </.> the smoke was all flying everyplace<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$D> <#> People working at the nearby Fairhill Shopping Centre saw a woman upstairs in the burning flat <#> People on the street tried to coax the woman to jump from the top floor window but she moved back out of sight and wasn't seen again <#> The fire brigade say people on the street tried to save the pair<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$F> <#> People did attempt to uh a rescue <,> but because of the intensity of the fire <,> it was very very hot in there <,> uh it was uh thick dense smoke <#> There is no way <,> without the proper equipment <,> or proper training that anyone could have actually got in there<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$D> <#> Fire fighters using breathing apparatus found two bodies on the second floor <,> and forensic experts have been examining the flat to determine the cause of the fire<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$A> <#> The Receiver appointed yesterday for the Dungiven building company P and J McNicholl says there 's no chance of saving the firm <#> This morning thirty-five of the company 's two hundred workers were made redundant <#> The closure has sent shock waves across the building trade in the north west<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$G> <#> This morning workers were still unclear about their future as they arrived for a meeting with the Receiver at the local community centre <#> Company owner Patrick McNicholl was also there but didn't attend the actual meeting <#> Thirty-five of the fifty men directly employed were told they 'd be made redundant <#> The future for the rest is uncertain <#> This man worked for the firm for nearly thirty years<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$H> <#> Well we haven't been told anything and I 'm here bar but to go to the dole on Monday morning <#> Come down to Limavady<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$G> <#> And how 's it going to affect you now<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$H> <#> Well it 'll affect me uh <,> well I need the job I need money<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$I> <#> Well I 'm <.> unem </.> unemployed now <#> I 've no money coming in <#> Got a house and a mortgage <#> They 've got to be paid<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$G> <#> McNicholls have been involved in eighteen sites across the northwest including Derry City Council 's new six million pound offices <#> All work ceased yesterday <#> It 's thought the firm owes some two and a half million pounds <#> The Receiver says there 's no hope of saving the company<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$J> <#> No <,> I I believe that the the financial situation of the company is too bad and that there is no possibility of the company surviving<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$G> <#> The closure is likely to have repercussions for the whole Dungiven area<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$K> <#> Well I think there are a lot of people will find a great deal of hardship as a result <#> The uhm as I say the employment uh <,> numbers extend far beyond the immediate employment of the <,> direct employment of the firm itself<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$G> <#> The local community centre was today asked to facilitate workers in putting in benefit claims<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$A> <#> The season for offshore salmon fishing in the Foyle fisheries area came to an end last night <#> It 's been the job of the government 's protection vessel to make sure boats haven't been flouting the law <#> Our environment correspondent Kevin Magee joined the crew on their last patrol of the season<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$L> <#> A sight fishermen aren't always glad to see <#> The fisheries protection vessel the Ken Vickers <,> carrying out a spot check to make sure they 're using the right gear at the right time <#> The crew of this vessel has considerable powers <#> And if necessary it can even call on the Royal Navy for support<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$M> <#> We as fishers inspectors are uh British sea-fishery officers and these give us powers to uh stop boats <,> to board boats <,> to look at their documents to ensure that they 're suitably licensed for the fish that they 're catching <#> We also can ask them to haul their gear and ensure that it is uh complying with the conservation regulations <#> Uh if needs be we can detain vessels and ask them to come to port for further investigation<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$L> <#> The vessel spends most of its time on the Irish sea policing trawlermen <#> For the past six weeks it has been searching for poachers and enforcing conservation regulations on licensed salmon fishermen along the north coast <#> Eleven court cases are now pending <#> The vessel has a top speed of seventeen knots and can sail in anything up to force eight conditions <#> She 's at sea one hundred and fifty days a year and during that time covers about twenty thousand miles along our coastline <#> Another spot check and everything is in order <#> All the salmon on board this boat were caught legally <#> But the fishermen say the regulations are too stringent<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$N> <#> It really restricts our fishing hours very tight <,> whereas a few extra hours in the day can make all that difference<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$O> <#> It 's a pity we couldn't get more time at it you know as the time 's very short you know <#> The twelve hour day 's fairly <,> it 's fairly short you know<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$L> <#> Fisheries protection can involve a sophisticated game of cat and mouse <#> The vessel 's main weapons are speed and radar and protection is not without its moments of tension on the high seas<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$P> <#> Sometimes you get some very thorny situations and uh as I say <,> very rarely you get two the same and you 've got to just work with it as you find it and uh caution and safety for crew and the fish are upmost in your mind<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$L> <#> Eighty percent of salmon returning from the Atlantic end up in the fishermen 's nets <#> The inspectorate says if it wasn't doing its job salmon may never make it past the final hurdle on their journey back to our rivers<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$B> <#> Kevin Magee braving the high seas for us there and we stay with a nautical theme <#> Yachtsmen and women from all over Britain are setting course for Carrickfergus this weekend <#> They 're taking part in the round Britain rally which began in Portsmouth just over a month ago<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$Q> <#> Those taking part in the rally are on the seventh leg of their tour <#> They left Craobh Haven in Scotland last night and have been arriving at Carrick marina today <#> It 's the first time the rally has stopped off in Northern Ireland<&> English speaker </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-010$Q> <#> Many of the yachts were becalmed off Scotland overnight but there was no shortage of wind in Belfast Lough this afternoon <#> Ken and Barbara Shaw from Sutton Coldfield were among the first to be welcomed at Carrickfergus Sailing Club<&> English speakers </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-010$Q> <#> There is to be an official welcome by the Mayor of Carrickfergus this evening and competitors and their crews will tour the Antrim coast by coach tomorrow <#> Should they all survive the hospitality they 'll set off on the next leg of their tour to Conwy in Wales on Sunday morning<ICE-IRE:S2B-010$A> <#> Well it 's not just going to be a weekend for the yachtspeople <#> There 's quite a weekend in store for motorsports fans <#> Here 's Mark Forsythe</I>
