<ICE-IRE:S2B-031 Statues><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-031$A> <#> Hello <#> Like our languages <,> our literatures and the games we play <,> the public statues and monumental sculpture of Ireland constitute an important aspect of our cultural expression <#> The statues themselves <,> the figures they represent <,> the sculptors who made them <,> the locations chosen for them <,> and the acclaim or outrage with which they were received <,> all have important stories to tell <#> In this programme we 'll take a closer look at these silent reminders of times past<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> Behind me is an unusual view of Daniel O'Connell <,> not the sort of view that one normally sees <#> And we must consider when looking at this monument that the streets of Dublin are peopled with such statues <#> Now how many of the public actually look at these statues <#> Have they simply become furnishings on the streets <,> or do people actually explore them <,> as they walk around doing their daily activities <#> What we propose to do in this programme <,> is to explore some of these monuments in terms of Irishness in Irish art <&> musical interlude begins </&> <#> The taste for public monuments was considered to have broken out into a statue monument memorial mania in the nineteenth century <#> If the Greeks were the first to confer statues as a mark of honour <,> the silent statuesque portraits erected in the nineteenth century in Dublin <,> might be considered evidence of the nation 's triumphs and tragedies <#> At the beginning of the century there were few public monuments <#> Those that were in place <,> mainly depicted royalty <,> and several amongst them were portraits of an equestrian nature <,> <#> The most prominent public sculpture in Dublin at the beginning of the nineteenth century <,> was here in College Green <#> Tell us about it <,><ICE-IRE:S2B-031$C> <#> Well the equestrian monument of William the Third was erected in seventeen o-one <,> having been executed by the English sculptor Grinling Gibbons <#> And <,> it would have <,> looked in seventeen o- one what you would have seen was <,> William the Third seated on his horse dressed in imperial Roman <,> military costume <#> Now this shows that it 's in a direct line back to the <,> equestrian monuments of ancient Rome <,> and it was here that the symbolism for majesty and power and authority was established with the use of the equestrian monument to depict the emperors and then subsequently placed throughout the empire<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> And <,> what was the significance of this type of monument for the Irish people<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$C> <#> Well <,> in being placed in Dublin though of course using a very foreign style if you like at the same time would have been an instantly recognisable <,> convention if you like for the depiction of unquestionable majesty and authority<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> And were there any other equestrian monuments <#> I know this was an eighteenth century one but did any go up in the nineteenth century<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$C> <#> Well probably the best known would have been the Gough monument <,> in the Phoenix Park which was erected in eighteen eighty and had been executed by the London-based Irish sculptor John Henry Foley <#> Now there was several attempts as there had been with William the Third to destroy this monument and it was finally removed in nineteen fifty-seven<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> So these monuments uh the equestrian monument we can expect to be a controversial monument<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$C> <#> Well I think so because William the Third here in Dame Street became a a focus for political uhm processions, became a political rallying point basically both for those that uhm supported the whole concept that this was there to illustrate<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$C> <#> And those that<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$C> <#> Opposed it <{> <[> pretty vehemently </[><ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> <[> And certainly </[> </{> not the sort of monument <&> musical interlude begins </&> we 're going to expect to find on the streets in the twentieth century<ICE-IRE:S2B-031$C> <#> No I don't think so <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-031$B> <#> The execution of the Wellington monument was more problematic <,> long drawn out as it was and perhaps even today it cannot be considered entirely complete <#> The obelisk <,> erected in the early part of the century <,> was to have been accompanied by an equestrian portrait <,,> and the pedestal was in place to receive it <#> However <,> there was never sufficient money <,> to commission the statue <,> and so the pedestal was removed <,> before the unveiling ceremony which did not take place until eighteen sixty-one <#> The Nelson and Wellington monuments rising to a soaring height in the city <,> employed scale <,> in a manner which must have appeared to many <,> as aggressive <,><#> College Green along with Sackville Street was a focal point for sculptural work in the nineteenth century <#> And when the Grattan statue was first mooted for this location <,> it was considered problematic that it might be as they said dwarfed into a pygmy by the equestrian monument to William the Third <#> However <,> there were those who thought it much more significant that Grattan would be standing positioned with his back to his royal majesty <#> This site was also problematic because it had been intended for a statue to Prince Albert but that particular statue was slow in coming to fruition so the Corporation was gently if firmly persuaded to hand over the location to the Grattan Committee <#> Queen Victoria is said to have been displeased and the Prince Albert memorial was positioned instead in Leinster Lawn <#> The Grattan statue is the work of John Henry Foley and it accompanies two other works by this Irish sculptor who was based in London <#> These two monuments are in front of Trinity College and are statues of Goldsmith and of Burke <&> musical interlude begins </&> <#> Goldsmith was not the first Irish poet commemorated on the streets of Dublin <#> Tom Moore the nationalist balladeer can claim that particular prize <#> The decision to erect a statue to Moore shortly after he died in eighteen fifty-two was greeted with enthusiasm <,> as this would be the first significantly Irish public commemoration <#> However when the statue was unveiled in College Green in eighteen fifty-seven <,> there followed general public outcry <#> The sculptural portrait was not liked <#> It was described as a stigma on our streets <#> Letters to the newspapers called for its removal <#> Even today it is criticised <#> The committee was considered to have made the wrong choice when they selected Christopher Moore to execute the work <#> A sketch model had been submitted by the eminent John Hogan and this design was generally considered to have been more successful <#> Yet if we examine the two <,> the Hogan is a studied exercise in lyricism <,> a contrived presentation of a poet <,> while the Moore bronze has a certain solid down-to-earth friendliness <#> Certainly Joyce 's comment on the aptness of placing a portrait likeness of Tom Moore over a urinal <,> because of his ballad on the meeting of the waters <,> would not have seemed appropriate to the daintiness of the Hogan design <#> Nonetheless <,> with every subsequent commission for a street monument <,> committees were reminded <,> of what had happened here in College Green <#> Moore was joined in this location by Goldsmith and Burke <,> fellow graduates of Trinity College <,> in the eighteen sixties <#> However none of these statues was considered adequately powerful in nationalist terms <,> and it was deemed outrageous that Dublin still had no public monument to Daniel O'Connell <,,> <#> This was the first politically nationalist monument commissioned for Dublin in the nineteenth century and has to have been the most controversial <,> particularly because of the choice of sculptor <#> The Irish people wanted a resident local sculptor to get the commission and Thomas Farrell was the name most often mooted <,> but the committee decided instead to put the commission out to competition <#> The competition was advertised not just in the Irish newspapers but also in England and in Scotland <,> a fact that worried those who insisted that the commission be given to a resident Irish sculptor <#> The closing date for the submission of designs was January the first eighteen sixty-five <,> and of the sixty designs submitted <,> and exhibited in the City Hall <,> amongst which triumphal arches and gothic canopies <,> none was deemed acceptable <#> A further competition was held <,,> with exactly the same result <#> At which stage the committee decided to offer the commission directly to John Henry Foley <,> whom they had really always wanted to execute the monument <#> Foley <,> was an Irish sculptor who had trained initially in Dublin before going for further training to London in eighteen thirty-four and eventually setting up his studio there <#> Foley was considered therefore by some to have <,> as they put it <,> succumbed to the blandishments of Babylon <,> and certainly the choice of this sculptor for such an important work in Dublin revealed <,> a lack of confidence in local talent <#> Although this monument was not erected in Dublin until eighteen eighty-two <,> Foley exhibited a sketch model of the work in the City Hall in eighteen sixty-seven <#> He had chosen a three-tiered monument with the heroic figure <,> atop a drum and four victory figures at the base <#> Now it is in the drum area that Foley has chosen to reveal O'Connell 's interrelationship with the people of Ireland <#> And if we examine the drum we find the figure of Erin in the centre with the detail of shamrocks in her hair as she tramples upon the chains with which she had been bound and holds in her hand the Act of Catholic Emancipation pointing aloft to O'Connell the Liberator <#> And approaching the figure of Erin around the drum we find members of the community <,> a variety of different people brought together from <,> peasant through lawyer to poet uh all of these people gathered together <,> walking forward around the drum approaching this significant figure <#> It is interesting to note that in this particular area <,> apart obviously from the figure of Erin <,> there are actually no women included <#> This use of relief figures on a drum <,> was to influence Thomas Farrell <,> in one of the great Catholic Church commissions of the century <,> the statue commemorating the first Irish cardinal Paul Cullen in the Pro-Cathedral <#> Here <,> the figure of religion <,> takes the place of that of Erin <#> Even more politically nationalist than the O'Connell monument was the decision to commemorate William Smith O'Brien in eighteen sixty-seven <#> This statue was originally located on the far side of O'Connell Bridge <,> and although commissioned after the O'Connell monument <,> it was complete and in position some ten years earlier than the Foley work <#> It was a controversial work uh because of the particular type of politics espoused by Smith O'Brien <,> and the unveiling ceremony which was a huge public affair was peppered with fiery speeches <#> John Martin a staunch supporter of Smith O'Brien and the man who performed the unveiling ceremony <,> drew attention to the fact that the monuments on the streets of Dublin <,> tended to reflect the haughty mastery of the English people <#> And he admired the fact that now finally we were getting somebody who was going to be of more significance to the Irish people and that also it would be the work of a resident Irish sculptor in this case Thomas Farrell <#> While there was a delay in the execution of the O'Connell monument <,> and <,> Smith O'Brien was positioned on the other side of the Liffey <,> it was Sir John Gray who was first to join Nelson in O'Connell Street <#> This type of presentation with the portrait statue set on a pedestal <,> brought the image much closer to the people than Nelson who was no more than a distant symbol skyed atop his pillar <#> Gray was the proprietor of the Freeman 's Journal <,> and a Protestant supporter of the nationalists <,> and he was also the driving force behind the Vartry scheme which made drinking water more available for the people of Dublin <#> And it was for this public duty spiritedly undertaken <,> while also for his political motivation <,> that he was given <,> such a prominent location in Dublin <#> This leads to what I like to call the do-gooder commemorations of the nature of Lord Ardilaun <,> whose elegant bronze likeness is positioned in Saint Stephen 's Green <,> <#> Now why is he here <#> Because he was instrumental in having the Green opened to the public <#> Sir Benjamin Guinness seated outside Saint Patrick 's Cathedral is a statue of a similar nature <,> <#> He is in this particular location because he had contributed so much money to the restoration fund <#> In the garden of Saint Patrick 's Cathedral there is another public work <,> Liberty Bell <,> by <,> Vivienne Roche</I>
