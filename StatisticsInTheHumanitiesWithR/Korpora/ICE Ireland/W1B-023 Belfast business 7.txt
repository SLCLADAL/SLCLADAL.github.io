January 2002 Shell Direct will be donating <*> pound sign </*> 1 for every 1000 litres of domestic home heating oil sold to ChildLine Northern Ireland. <#> ChildLine is the free national 24-hour helpline for children in trouble, need or danger. <#> The agency aims to protect children who are at risk from harm, to help children resolve or alleviate their problems and to raise public awareness of issues that affect the welfare and rights of children. <#> The young people of Northern Ireland clearly need a local ChildLine service. <#> (6000 attempted calls to ChildLine every week from the young people in Northern Ireland.) <#> Staff and volunteer counsellors with first-hand knowledge of children 's lives in Northern Ireland can develop close working relationships with child welfare and emergency services, provide a service tailored to the needs of young people in Northern Ireland and answer more calls. <#> We hope to connect many children to ChildLine. </p><p> <quote> <#> "ChildLine Northern Ireland is delighted to receive the support of Shell Direct. <#> The support of Shell Direct and your Northern Ireland domestic consumers will greatly help ChildLine in answering many more local children and young people who so desperately need the confidential counselling service that our trained volunteers provide." </quote> <#> Martin McClure, Business Development Manager, ChildLine Northern Ireland. </p><p> <#> Due to the change of marketing direction as of 1 January 2002 Shell Direct will unfortunately no longer be issuing AirMiles to our customers. <#> Please be reassured that AirMiles will be awarded for any deliveries received on or before 31st December 2001. <#> If you have any queries regarding your AirMiles account please feel free to call 028 9055 3838 leaving your details and we will get back to you directly. </p><p> <#> We would also like to remind you that as well as quality Shell Home Heating Oil at competitive prices all year round, we also

will be able to find the time to read this paper in advance of our next meeting. <#> It may help you to know that it is in two main parts: (1) a summary of the key areas of agreement arising from the interviews and the areas where opinion was clearly divided; and (2) a fuller outline of the various discussion points including:<#> <*> bullet point </*> level of computer usage <#> <*> bullet point
