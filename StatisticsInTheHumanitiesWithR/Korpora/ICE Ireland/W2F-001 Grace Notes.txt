<W2F-001 Grace Notes><I><W2F-001$A><h> <#> Grace Notes </h><p> <#> She went down the front steps and walked along the street to the main road. <#> At this hour of the morning there was little or no traffic. <#> If there was a car, then it sounded just like that - a car going past in the wet - there was no other city noise. <#> It was still dark and the street lights were reflected on the road surface. <#> She tucked her hair back and put her collar up as far as it would go. <#> The raincoat was creased as if it had just been unpacked. <#> She made her way to the bus station on foot carrying a small hold-all. </p><p> <#> She was early at the airport stance and walked up and down the concrete pavement. <#> It was lined and felt, through the soles of her shoes, like hard sand close to the water 's edge. <#> It was a way of not thinking - to concentrate on her surroundings. <#> Somewhere a man was whistling - at least she assumed it was a man. <#> Women rarely whistled. </p><p> <#> In the bus she chose a place towards the back and put her knees up against the seat in front of her. <#> The bus was empty and warm. <#> She watched the chrome seat rails vibrate in unison as the engine idled. <#> If she stared at things, then it helped block out stuff. <#> Like Anna. <#> She did not dare think about that. <#> Two people got on. <#> She noticed that her fists were clenched and she consciously relaxed them, turned her hands palm upwards on her lap to see if it would make a difference. </p><p> <#> On the motorway they drove towards the January dawn, a sky of yellow light and dark cloud. <#> Then as the bus careered through the rain and spray thrown up by the growing traffic, at seventy miles an hour, she began to cry. <#> It came over her and she just let it happen. <#> She tried to make as little noise as possible but the others on the bus heard her and looked round. <#> It helped her to stop when she saw her distorted face reflected in the window. <#> She had done it before - used the bathroom mirror in the same way. <#> You just looked so awful, you stopped. </p><p> <#> In the airport she bought her tickets with the money Peter and Liz had lent her. <#> She sat in the middle of the concourse trying to think of nothing, trying not to listen to the airport chimes, the flight announcements. <#> People walked around her but she did not look up. <#> She continued to stare at her feet. <#> She was wearing brown court shoes and denim jeans. <#> Somehow talcum powder had got on to her left shoe and dulled the leather. <#> She wondered how it had survived the rain. </p><p> <#> At one side of the lounge men were building a staircase, hammering incessantly. <#> Somebody was sawing wood by hand - better than the scream of a power-saw. <#> She thought the sound nostalgic - like the hee-haw of a donkey. <#> Somewhere a baby was crying. <#> It was a very young - a week, maybe two. <#> The exhalation of each cry seemed infinitely long. <#> She did not dare to think of babies. </p><p> <#> She needed the toilet. <#> Beside the sign for LADIES and GENTS was one for a BABY CHANGING ROOM. <#> If only it was as easy as that. <#> Don't particularly like this baby, would you mind changing it?' <#> Afterwards, washing her hands, she looked in the mirror and saw her eyes puffy with crying. </p><p> <#> An airport was the place for such things. <#> People meeting and people parting. <#> Tears of one sort or another. <#> Some things were too painful. <#> Offspring and what they did to you. </p><p> <#> Everybody said she took after her father. <#> The urge to cry came over her again but this time, facing herself in the mirror, she controlled it. <#> She wondered what it would be like to face the mirror in a moment of joy. <#> But this seemed such an impossibility. <#> She took one of her red and grey capsules and washed it down, gulp-swallowing water sipped from the arc of a drinking fountain. </p><p> <#> Outside the toilets school parties from France and Germany stood in stiff groups photographing themselves. <#> They talked loudly without removing their Walkmans. <#> Their headsets sizzled and tished. <#> Two policemen went past in shirtsleeves - one hugging a machine-gun close to his chest. </p><p> <#> Her flight was called and she went through Security and then through Special Security for those people travelling to Northern Ireland. <#> The body search the uniformed woman gave her was close to being offensive. <#> Breasts and buttocks flicked by her touch. <#> A Special Branch policeman looked at her ticket. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'The reason for your trip?' </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> 'I 'm going home.' </quote> </p> <p> <#> <quote> 'Business or pleasure?' </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> 'Neither.' </quote> </p><p> <#> He looked at her, his fingers playing with the ticket. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'For what reason?' </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> 'A funeral.' </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> 'Someone close? '</quote> </p><p> <#> She nodded. <#> He handed her back her ticket. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'Sorry. <#> On you go.' </quote> </p><p> <#> As the plane turned, the runway lights formed a squat triangle to the horizon. <#> The window was covered with shuddering droplets of rain.<#> The engine note changed, went up an octave, as they raced for take-off. <#> Being pressed back into her seat as they accelerated was a kind of swooning. <#> At this speed with the engine note almost a scream the rain droplets became minute, with tails streaking across the glass - like individual sperm. </p><p> <#> On holiday her father wore an Arran sweater, full of cable and blackberry stitching, knitted with untreated wool - he said the untreated nature of the wool repelled the rain. <#> Her mother said it repelled her too. <#> The smell of it was something awful. <#> Like a wet dog. </p><p> <#> His voice was one of the greatest things in the world - just talking. <#> He had a big Adam 's apple which bobbed when he spoke. <#> When she was very young she would sit on his knee and reach out a finger to touch it as it moved - the sound he made, guttural, so deep it resonated with her insides. </p><p> <#> When they dropped down through the cloud at Aldergrove she saw how green the land was. <#> And how small the fields. <#> A mosaic of vivid greens and yellows and browns. <#> Home. <#> She wanted to cry again. </p><p> <#> The bus into Belfast was stopped at a checkpoint and a policeman in a flak jacket, a young guy with a ginger moustache, walked up the aisle towards her, his head moving in a slow no as he looked from side to side, from seat to opposite seat for bombs. <#> He winked at her, <quote> 'Cheer up love, it might never happen.' </quote> </p><p> <#> But it already had. </p><p> <#> On the bus home she watched the familiar landmarks she used as a child pass one by one. <#> Toomebridge, her convent school, the drop into low gear to take the hill out of Magherafelt. </p><p> <#> The bus stopped at a crossroads on the outskirts of her home town and a woman got off. <#> Before she walked away, the driver and she had a conversation, shouted over the engine noise. <#> This was the crossroads where the Orangemen held their drumming matches. <#> It was part of her childhood to look up from the kitchen table on still Saturday evenings and hear the rumble of the drums. <#> Her mother would roll her eyes, <quote> 'They 're at it again.' </quote> </p><p> <#> It was a scary sound - like thunder. <#> Like the town was under a canopy of dark noise. <#> One summer 's evening she 'd been out a walk with her father and they 'd come across a drumming match as it was setting up. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'Oi oi, Catherine, would you look at this nonsense.' </quote> <#> He held her hand tighter. <#> Land-Rovers and vans had been drawn up on to the grass verges. <#> A party of men was gathering. <#> A couple of drums were being taken from the back of a Land-Rover. <#> The drums were two to three feet deep as well as huge in circumference. <#> They were so big that it took two men to help each drummer struggle into his harness. <#> They hung the drum around his neck and each drummer leaned back as far as he could and supported the drum against his stomach. <#> Then they handed him two long rods. <#> There was a thin drummer and a fat one. <#> Both were hatless and in shirt-sleeves. <#> The fat one had a tanned face which stopped at his hat line. <#> Above that, his skin was white. <#> He rattled the rods against the skin of the drum, testing it. <#> The drum was so big in relation to the man that Catherine thought of a penny-farthing. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'They 're made of goat skin,' </quote> said her father. <#> <quote> 'King Billy-goat skin. <#> You could smell the stink of it from Omagh.' </quote> </p><p> <#> When she 'd heard the drums in her home their rhythm had been fudged by distance and the sound had become an indistinct rumble. <#> Now here, close up, it was a different thing altogether. <#> Her father leaned over to her ear as if to shout something above the noise of the drumming, but instead shook his head. <#> When the drums ceased, he whispered to her, <quote> 'They 're supposed to be able to play different rhythms, different tunes - <it> Lilliburlero </it> and what have you - but it all sounds the same to me. <#> A bloody dunderin. <#> On the Twelfth they thump them so hard and so long they bleed their wrists. <#> Against the rim. <#> Sheer bloody bigotry.' </quote> <#> Catherine stared at the flailing sticks, felt her eardrums pummelled. <#> <quote> 'They practise out here above the town to let the Catholics know they 're in charge. <#> This is their way of saying the Prods rule the roost.' </quote> </p><p> <#> But Catherine was thrilled by the sound, could distinguish the left hand 's rhythm from the right. <#> She tried to keep time with her toes inside he shoes. <#> There were slaps and dunts on the off-beats, complex rhythms she couldn't begin to write down - even now, never mind then. <#> The two sticks were working independently. <#> The hands tripping each other up. <#> A ripple bouncing back and interfering with the other ripples which had first started it. <#> The drums were battered so loud she felt the vibrations in her body, was sure the sky and the air about her were pounding to the beat. <#> It didn't exactly make her want to dance, more to sway. <#> But there was an edge as well - of fear, of tribal war drumming. <#> The gathering of men turned to stare across the road. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'Come on,' </quote> said her father. <#> <quote> 'You 're looking at a crowd whose highest ambition, this year and every year, it to march down streets where they 're not wanted. <#> Nothing to do with the betterment of mankind of the raising of the human spirit.' </quote> <#> Her father 's hand tightened on hers to that it began to hurt. <#> <quote> 'It 's their right, their heritage. <#> God love a duck. <#> Bowler-hatted dunderheads. <#> Gather-ups. <#> The Orange dis-Order, I call them. <#> And the politicians that lead them are ten times worse, for they should know better. <#> The whole problem, Catherine, is racist. <#> I 've heard Protestants saying, <quote> "The one side is as bad as the other"</quote> . <#> It 's just not true. <#> It 's the Protestant side 's bigoted. <#> The Catholics are only reacting to being hated. <#> And it 's a polite kind of hatred, too. <#> Around the Twelfth the Prods 'll say, <quote> "Hello." </quote> <#> Any other time of the year they 'll say, <quote> "Hello, Brendan." </quote> <#> And it 's not just the guttersnipes. <#> If anything, the bloody lawyers and doctors and businessmen are worse - men who 've been educated.' </quote> </p><p> <#> In the town itself she was surprised to see a Chinese restaurant and a new grey fortress of a police barracks. <#> She stood, ready to get off at her stop. <#> There was something odd about the street. <#> She bent at the knees, crouched to look out at where she used to live. <#> It was hardly recognisable. <#> Shop-fronts were covered in hardboard, the Orange Hall and other buildings bristled with scaffolding. <#> Some roofs were covered in green tarpaulins, others were protected by lath and sheets of polythene. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'What 's happened here?' <quote> she asked the bus driver. </p><p> <#> <quote> 'It got blew up. <#> A bomb in October.' </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> 'Was anybody hurt?' </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> 'They gave a warning. <#> The whole place is nothing but a shell.' </quote> </p></I>
