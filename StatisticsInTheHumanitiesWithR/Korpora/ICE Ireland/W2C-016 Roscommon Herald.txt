<W2C-016 Roscommon Herald><I><W2C-016$A><#> <h> <bold> Environment Award For Council </bold> </h><p> <#> Roscommon County Council this week picked up its second major award in two years from the Department of Environment 's Local Authority Environment Awards scheme. </p><p> <#> Two years ago, it won the overall award and this year was the winning authority in the County Council category. <#> It received a cheque for <*> pound sign </*> 5,000 which will be used to upgrade and enhance the amenity area at Dalton Terrace, Ballaghaderreen. </p><p> <#> This year 's win, said the Minister for Environmental Protection John Browne, was evidence of the <quote> "consistently high quality" </quote> of the council 's work. </p><p> <#> In particular, he added, it had established a Farming Community Programme in association with the IFA which encouraged farmers to take care when disposing of waste plastic arising from round-baled silage. </p><p> <#> In addition, a free paint scheme was available for the Tidy Towns committees and a freephone service was provided during Clean-Up Roscommon Week. <#> This was linked to a recycling programme which included a cardboard recycling scheme as well as glass and can recycling schemes. </p><p> <#> Overall, the judges considered that the submission was particularly comprehensive. <#> They were also impressed by the Council 's decision to base their environmental programme on the results of a questionnaire completed by local community groups. </p><p> <#> The overall winner for 1994 was Drogheda Corporation which also won the 15,000 plus urban authorities category. </p></I><I><W2C-016$B><#> <h> <bold> Garda Crackdown Gains Momentum </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> As the Garda crackdown on drinking and driving moves into top gear throughout the county publicans have warned that thousands of jobs will be lost unless the Government quickly provides a late night public transport service and eases the penalties under the new legislation. </bold> </p><it> <bold> <#> By Christina McHugh </it> </bold><p> <#> This week Crime Prevention Officer for the Roscommon/East Galway Garda Division, Sergeant Larry Shine, warned motorists who intend taking a drink over the Christmas period to <quote> "arrange to have a competent sober friend" </quote> available to drive them home, ensuring that they are properly <}> <-> ensured </-> <+> insured </+> </}> to do so. <#> <quote> "Eliminating excessive speed and drunk driving will make a major contribution towards safer roads," </quote> said Sergeant Shine. </p><p> <#> Warning of Garda checkpoints on all roads in the county, he reminded motorists that following the new legislation, which came into effect on December 2nd, that a conviction for drunk driving can lead to the imposition of a penalty of <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 and or six months imprisonment with automatic disqualification from driving for a period of two years for a first offence. <quote> "You may have to undergo a driving test before you get your driving licence back or obtain a certificate of fitness," </quote> he explained. <quote> <#> "People who need a vehicle in their line of business, to get to work or tend to family needs should consider these factors," </quote> Sgt. Shine stressed. </p><p> <#> However, as the new legislation begins to take its toll on rural publicans in particular, the President of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, Mr. Michael Moloney, stressed that already business is down by almost 50 <*> percent sign </*> in some areas since the new drink driving limit was introduced. </p><p> <#> Warning of the loss of thousands of jobs, Mr. Moloney said that <quote> "this piece of legislation will be the cause of pub closures and job losses around the country because the penalties for enjoying oneself are now so severe that the Irish people are frightened to go out to their local pub or to a friend 's house." </quote> </p><p> <#> He described the situation in rural villages as even <quote> "worse than the rest of the country", </quote> adding that people have now become prisoners in their own homes. </p><p> <#> Mr. Moloney suggested that the Government should ensure that people are treated more fairly and with more respect. <#> <quote> "The government should reduce the penalties and introduce immediately alternative transport arrangements around the country," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> <quote> "Ordinary people all around the country are frustrated with this new legislation. <#> Normally local politicians would listen to the people of Ireland and act as their voice at national level, but politicians today are too busy looking after their own affairs about being in or out of Government. <#> They are not paying any attention to the things which are causing the destruction of a vital part of Irish culture," </quote> claimed Mr. Moloney. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile with Christmas shopping in full swing and the January sales just around the corner Gardai ask shoppers to take precautions as regards their personal security and the security of their vehicles. </p><p> <#> Sgt. Shine advises the public to bring only the minimum amount of money to meet shopping needs and not to leave goods on view <}> <-> ion </-> <+> in </+> </}> unattended vehicles. </p><p> <#> <quote> "With hazardous driving conditions a likely feature on our roads in the coming weeks, we suggest that now is an appropriate time to check that your vehicle is in a roadworthy condition" </quote> said the Sergeant. <#> <quote> "Excessive speed is a contributing factor in many road accidents. <#> Motorists should allow sufficient time to complete their journeys and obey the speed limits." </quote> </p><p> <#> For pedestrians the Gardai have this advice- <quote> "walk on the correct side of the roadway. <#> When walking during the <}> <-> house </-> <+> hours </+> </}> of darkness wear bright coloured outer clothing and wear an armband." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-016$C><#> <h> <bold> Man Given Warning on Attitude to Gardai </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> A Ballymote man who claimed he was <quote> "hassled" </quote> by a Garda had summonses against him dismissed when he apologised before Boyle District Court and when the court heard that he had a hearing problem. </bold> </p><p> <#> Before Judge John Neilan for driving without insurance, giving a false name and not wearing a set belt at Greatmeadow, Boyle on August 3rd last was Brian Leonard, Carrowkeel, Ballymote. <#> The owner of the vehicle, Gerry Clarke, Clerhone, Ballintogher, Co. Sligo, who was a passenger in the vehicle, was fined <*> pound sign </*> 200 and had his licence endorsed by Judge Neilan for allowing his car to be driven without insurance. <#> The summons for driving without insurance was dismissed against Leonard. </p><p> <#> Garda Gerald Barry told the court that when he and Garda Peter Lennon stopped Clarke 's Opel Kadett car, he heard Leonard give an incorrect name to Garda Lennon. <#> The defendant subsequently gave his correct name. </p><p> <#> <quote> "I recall saying to Mr. Leonard to give his correct name which he did," </quote> explained the Garda, but replying to Mr. John Kelly, Solicitor for Leonard, he admitted that he couldn't say whether the other Garda asked the defendant for his name. </p><p> <#> Mr. Kelly 's contention was that in relation to Leonard giving a false name, that of Gerard Clarke, when questioned on that night, his client believed that Garda Lennon asked him who owned the car and not for his name. </p><p> <#> Leonard, in giving evidence, said that he had been at a dance in Roscommon. <#> When the dance was over, Clarke requested that he drive his (Clarke 's) car home, in view that he (Clarke) had had a <quote> "few pints" </quote> too many. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> The </-> </}> Witness said that he first made sure that he was fully covered on Clarke 's insurance, which he believed he was. </p><p> <#> He went on to say that when the car was later stopped by Gardai, he remembered Garda Lennon asking him <quote> "who owns the car"? </quote> <#> He replied <quote> "Gerry Clarke." </quote> <#> He informed Judge Neilan that subsequently, the Garda had used <quote> "abusive language", </quote> and told him to <quote> "get out of the car." </quote> <quote> <#> "He accused me of being drunk," </quote> explained the defendant. <#> He added that he did not remember Garda Barry saying anything. </p><p> <#> Under cross-examination from Supt. P.J. Ward, Leonard denied that the accompanying Garda had asked him to give his correct name, and confirmed again that Garda Lennon was being abusive. <quote> <#> "He told me to get out of the f <*> dash sign </*> ing car and accused me of being drunk" </quote> said Leonard. </p><p> <#> When Leonard told the court that he was still seated in the car when Garda Barry came over <quote> "five or six minutes" </quote> after the other Garda had asked him <quote> "to get out", </quote> Judge Neilan wondered how he could reconcile such a statement. </p><p> <#> The Judge also added that <quote> "the defendant had levelled very serious accusations against Garda Lennon. <#> It 's a serious allegation to make." </quote> </p><p> <#> Solicitor, Mr. Kelly said that there appeared to be <quote> "a lot of confusion" </quote> over the time-scale of events, and felt that <quote> "people have a different perspective of time." </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> "<}> <-> There 's </-> <+> There </+> </}> appears to be some misunderstanding as to what was said that night," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> The Judge responded by saying <quote> "I 'm not prepared to stand idly by, and allow accusations to go unfounded." </quote> </p><p> <#> Leonard, in trying to clarify the situation said: <quote> "He (Garda Lennon) told me to walk up and down the road, and accused me of being drunk. <#> He was hassling me." </quote> <#> The defendant, who explained he didn't take a drink, went on to say <quote> "I thought I was doing Clarke a good turn." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "Why do you have a difficulty with the Gardai carrying out their duties," </quote> he asked. </p><p> <#> Supt. Ward explained to the court that if the defendant was unhappy with the Garda 's behaviour the options were there for him to make a complaint. </p><p> <#> Leonard, a single, unemployed man, was warned of his attitude to Gardai by the judge, who declared that they are <quote> "citizens of the state and should be treated with a degree of dignity." </quote> </p><p> <#> The charge of insurance was dismissed against him, but he was initially fined <*> pound sign </*> 25 for giving a false name, and further fined <*> pound sign </*> 15 for not wearing a seat-belt. <#> However, the summonses were later dismissed when Leonard apologised to the court, and when it was later discovered that the defendant had a hearing problem. </p></I><I><W2C-016$D><#> <h> <bold> Working Group Set Up To Examine Boyle College </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> The proposed changes in the second level educational scene in the Boyle and Ballghaderreen catchments were once again the subject of queries from members of the Co. Roscommon Vocational Education Committee at its December meeting on Monday. </bold> </p><it> <#> By Brian Cunniffe </it><p> <#> The meeting was told by the Committee Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kevin McBrien, that the <*> pound sign </*> 1.7m Department of Education allocation for Boyle 's new school would be for new buildings only. <#> He added that the Department of Education were currently making a survey of work needed on the existing buildings. <#> He also informed the meeting that the V.E.C. had no plans to dispose of its property in Ballaghderreen. </p><p> <#> Providing the meeting with an update on the Boyle developments since the last meeting Mr. McBrien said that a meeting took place on December 6th in Boyle. <#> The Managements of the three schools and representatives of all the staffs met then with the Independent Facilitator and there was a very frank and open discussion. <#> A working group was set up consisting of parents, management and teachers to examine various modules of Community Colleges in existence <quote> "to see which of those would be availed of" </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr. Christy Brady said that there was delight around the Boyle area that a new school was coming. <#> He then queried the nature of the <*> pound sign </*> 1.7m allocation as to whether or not some of it would be expended on refurbishing existing buildings. </p><p> <#> Mr McBrien- <quote> I understand the <*> pound sign </*> 1.7m is in respect of new buildings. <#> I admit it would take quite a considerable sum to refurbish some existing buildings. </quote> </p><p> <#> Regarding Ballaghaderreen Mr. McBrien said that a meeting was arranged for January 12th next involving the Management of the three schools in Ballaghaderreen, the teacher representatives and union representatives to discuss the pros and cons associated with the staffing situation involving the amalgamated schools. </p></I><I><W2C-016$E><#> <h> <bold> A Guide to Choosing Toys </bold> </h><p> <#> Parents and relatives buying toys for Christmas have been asked to consider the "play value" of toys, as well as the safety factors when deciding on gifts. <#> The appeal comes from the National Children 's Resource Centre who have just launched, with Dunnes Stores, a free guide for parents and guardians on selecting toys for children and young people. </p><p> <#> Entitled "A Guide To Choosing Toys", the booklet has been compiled to help parents and relatives make the right toy choices in order to encourage the development of children in their care. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Children learn through play," </quote> says Angela Canavan from the National Children 's Resource Centre. <quote> <#> "Play helps children to acquire new skills and abilities, fosters creativity and enhances overall development. <#> Toys play an integral part in this process, whether to develop independence, encourage sharing, stimulate intellectual development or fostering creativity." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Guide includes basic criteria for selecting toys and includes suggestions for each stage of development, from a baby, up through pre-school years and up to teenagers. </p><p> <#> The Dunnes Stores guide is available free of charge from the National Resource Centre (Tel: 01 - 4539699) and copies can be obtained by sending a stamped-addressed envelope (.30p) to the National Children 's Resource Centre, Barnardo 's, Christchurch Square, Dublin 8. </p></I>
