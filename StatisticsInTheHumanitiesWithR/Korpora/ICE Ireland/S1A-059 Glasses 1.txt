uhm <,> you know that one where <,> it 's a very posh lady <,> Keeping up Appearances<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Don't like <{> <[> that </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> <[> And I like </[> </{> <#> You

married at all<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Oh yeah <#> Oh yeah I 'd say so<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> So we 're told at any rate<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> No they wouldn't get away with that kind of thing <#> They wouldn't be getting away with it I mean <#> They <,> they wouldn't be getting away with all the appearances and all the <,> you know all the uh kind of show and everything <#> They 're definitely married <#> I 'd say so<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Maybe maybe <#> I wrote a letter to Simon today for Christmas<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Did you<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Because I don't

Christmas <,> so I 've written the letter to them<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Oh right okay <#> Yeah <#> Anyway how are your glasses <,> <&> cough </&> working out<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Very <.> prob </.> problematic<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Hmm <#> Well<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> I find it difficult with the two different sights in the glasses <#> <{> <[> You feel </[> that you 're going to fall down when you look down which is the reading part<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> What you have the bifocals<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Yeah <,> and you look up and it 's for ordinary outdoor walking or driving whatever<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Well <,> I find with my glasses now mine aren't bifocal like yours are <#> Aren't they bifocal <#> They are <#> Mine aren't bifocal but <,> I find like that <,> if you wear if they 're for reading and you wear them out <,> there 's <,> I don't know it 's sort of like uhm <,> they 're uncomfortable <#> Your sight is uncomfortable<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Wearing spectacles is definitely <,> a problem<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Why<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Ah <,> I keep losing mine <#> I 've three pairs now<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> You 're the only one I know <,> who keeps losing their glasses <#> I don't know how you manage <,> <&> laughter </&> I don't know how you manage to lose them so much<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> I 'll do like Anna Fitzgibbon and I 'll get myself one of those things <,> you hang around your neck and the glasses hang on <#> The only problem is I 'd need three of those<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> That 's a waste of time <#> Really is <#> You know I mean <,> what you have to do is just <,> if you had the one pair <,> probably wouldn't lose them<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Well I 've all sorts of problems which are too deep <,> and too long-winded to go into now <{> <[> like </[> watching television <#> If I lie on the couch I can't see<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Oh yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> What<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> If I 'm watching television and I lie on the couch with my varifocal glasses I can't see <{> <[> I 'm </[> uncomfortable<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> And then if I go to look for my ordinary glasses for watching television I seemed to have misplaced them<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <,> well I don't lose mine at all <#> But then again now I only bring them into college <,> so <,> you can't really go too wrong <,> can you<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Well talking about eyes and teeth <,> I think it 's about time you went for an appointment to the dentist<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Okay <,> <{> <[> I haven't </[> I went last no actually <,> I don't think it is <#> I went last <,> around the time of summer <#> I went in <,> September and thankfully there was nothing wrong <#> Actually <,> I 'll tell you what <,> I haven't had a filling <,> since I 'd say two years now<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> <[> It 's </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> I didn't know you went in September <#> I know there was a bill in for June which you were disputing <,> and I asked the dentist about it and they said you had definitely been<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Did you see the hygienist<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> What did she say<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> She just cleaned my <{> <[> teeth </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[> She she </[> </{> didn't say anything <#> She scraped your teeth<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> This week when I went to the dentist he said I 'd nothing to have done either <#> He said I was doing remarkably well considering it was two years since I 'd been with him<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> That 's crazy <#> Barmy <#> Ah no no in all fairness now I only go about once every <,> eight months <#> About once every eight months<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Ah sure that 's enough I think really <#> You haven't had any problem at all with your teeth <#> <{1> <[1> Eithne 's supposed to go </[1> Eithne 's supposed to go down to uh Garret Fitzwilliam about hers <#> And she 's just putting it on the long finger <#> I mean he may have <{2> <[2> the answer for her </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[1> I have about five fillings </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[2> She was supposed </[2> </{2> to go down <#> Oh she 's <,> last night<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Well she made no effort <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <#> Well it 's her business <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> It is her business to a point <#> The only thing is that she 's<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> It 's her business completely<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> <.> Sh </.> <,> well if they get really bad and she has to have a lot of work done on them your father 's paying for them cos she doesn't have enough PRSI contributions <#> By the way talking about PRSI contributions did you organise your tax rebate<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Well well lucky for you you 're so wealthy you don't have to bother<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> There 's only a bit I have left to do <#> Not too much longer<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Not too <{> <[> much longer for what </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[> Ah but it 'll be </[> </{> <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> It 'll be groovy to be getting all my money in for a change <,> cos I 've been paying so much tax <#> It 's not funny at all<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Well basically it 's your own fault<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Well it is my own fault <#> But I mean <,> it 's it 's you know it 's a stupid system that the tax office don't cop on that I 'm only earning twenty pounds a week <,> and they insist on charging forty-eight percent tax on it<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Well that 's the way they work emergency tax <#> And that 's to make you <{> <[> get your affairs in order </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[> What exactly is </[> </{> emergency tax anyway<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Exactly what you you 're paying<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> But why do they call it emergency<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> You pay<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Emergency tax <,> when you haven't got your tax free allowances in order <#> And it makes you go all the faster to <{> <[> go and get it </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <[> So </[> </{> emergency means quick to the tax Revenue Commissioner 's office and get your tax <{> <[> free allowance </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> <[> And full and full </[> </{> amount<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Full amount <#> Oh cos you end up paying forty-eight percent anyway <#> Well that 's what I 'm on at the moment <,> and I really do think it 's crazy <,> absolutely crazy<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Are you working on Sunday night<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Mm <,> no <#> I 've got Vivian to do it for me <,> which is just as well <#> <{> <[> <,> Cos I can't keep working </[> that much <#> Quite sufficient <#> It 's absolutely perfect<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> <[> Yeah one night a week is quite sufficient for you to work </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> It 's ridiculous if you would even consider working any more than that<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> Yeah it is you see <#> And I told <,> the manager that I couldn't work <,> uh <,> more than the one night a week you know <#> So <,> he uh he said yeah fine <#> And of course <,> he 's a bit of head like a sieve <,> and it went in one ear and out the next <#> And the next week sure wasn't I on <,> wasn't I on the two nights <#> You know it 's crazy really I mean if you can't remember that kind of thing <#> I mean that 's what the manager 's there for<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Maura you 're a little insignificant person in their eyes<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> There 's only twenty of us twenty-five of us in the bar <#> I 'm twenty I 'm one twenty-fifth of the whole bar<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A>

</{><ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Six hours work per week<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> Some day <,> some day I might do more <#> I might do more during my summer after my block <#> Actually I don't know what I 'm going to do for this summer <,> cos I just can't decide what I 'm going to do <#> I mean it 's not even near the summer now but like<ICE-IRE:S1A-059$A> <#> Earn heaps of money
