cross between Humpty Dumpty and Rip Van Winkle <,> and all the king 's horses and all the king 's men <,> couldn't put Humpty together again <#> Cos there was more pieces than I thought were originally there <#> Spent so much time looking at a grey silent concrete wall till its emptiness screams at you <,> and you examine the mind fiercely <,> to put pictures <,> on that wall <,> to create your own art gallery <,> keep yourself sane <,> to find a place to look at <#> I came home <,> I spent about six months <,> travelling around Ireland <,> telling myself I was looking for a place to live <#> I went to visit a friend in Cork <,> and he said to me quite prophetically <,> you 'll know it when you get there <#> I didn't believe him <,> until I came here <,> and then it caught me <#> It captures anybody 's eye <,> and it holds the eye fixed on it <#> It 's like looking at a painting <#> You examine it <,> its depth and all its colours and its contours and its shapes <#> And here <,> in this <,> most desolate but exquisitely beautiful place you find an echo of some of those pictures you hung on those concrete walls <&> music </&> <#> I 'm greedy <#> I need open spaces <#> This a panorama vast <,> <#> There 's a wonderful light because you 're you 're you 're on the on the western seaboard and there 's nothing but the Atlantic and America at the far side of it <#> The sky and the landscape changes <,> constantly <#> There 'll be skies at about five o'clock <#> They 're like heaven 's own embroidery <#> The colour and and the change of colour uh is incredible <#> The sky roars at you here <,> <#> You get a sense of your own tininess and insignificance <#> I 'm just a piece of dust in the wind <,> when I confront all this <&> music </&> <#> Up here 's a kind of <,> place that you can be still in <#> Sometimes I think <,> walking around here <,> <.> tha </.> that those stones <,> and I 've seen lots of stones in my time <,> but something makes me think of <,> notations on a music script <#> I don't know why <#> It 's as if the stones themselves are <,> are speaking with their own kind of rhythm <#> It was up behind us over the hill <,> where I first came to stay <,> in a priest 's retreat <,> a house offered to me without me asking for it <#> And as I drove up the hill that late October <,> and saw <,> this autumnal landscape and all the colour and I thought <,> maybe <#> And I arrived at the cottage <,> and opened the door <,> and held myself chilled <,> as I entered <#> It was as if it said to me <,> something 's going to happen here <,> and I was a bit terrified <#> But because I 'm stubborn said I'm going to stay and find out <#> It was that night <,> and then the next day <,> looking around the old whitewashed walls I said to myself <,> if I take the chair out of here and the table out of here I 've been in this room before <#> There 's rooms in the hills of Lebanon <,> that I slept in and tried to sleep in <,> and it was as if I was back there <#> Uh <,> but this time it was only me making myself stay <#> So I stayed <,> and in that cottage <,> at the foot of that hill <,> it all did begin there the <,> reclaiming of yourself <,> of putting back the pieces <#> I drove over Sion Hill coming into town <,> and as I got to the top of the hill and saw this Ethiopian monstrosity I put the brakes on in the car and stopped dead <,> and said <,> and I can remember the moment crystal clear in my head <,> oh Holy Jesus <#> Croagh Patrick <#> Saint Patrick and the Christian Church put a name to it <#> That mountain 's been holy before Christianity proclaimed holiness <#> It 's a disturbing place <&> music </&> <#> Right away struck <,> it was as if the mountain itself was pointing the finger and saying <,> here <,> come here <#> I find when I first came here arrive in to Westport <,> I saw the mountain quite <,> nearly like it is today <,> and it terrified me <,> but it compelled me <#> And for some strange reason that I don't care to fathom <,> because it intrigues me <,> I went to live <,> nearly at the foot of that and behind that mountain <,> on my own <,> to sort my own self out<&> talks to

baggage <,> even though I thought I 'd purged myself of it <,> having gone to university and met other people from <,> different parts of Ireland with different viewpoints to me <,> but was still with me <,> years and years later <#> And I 'm quite grateful for it <,> that sense of <,> being resistant <,> of being <,> defensive <#> I know what no surrender means cos I was born with it <,> but I 'd
