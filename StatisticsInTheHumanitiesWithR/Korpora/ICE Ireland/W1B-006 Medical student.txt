<W1B-006 Medical student><I><W1B-006$A><h> <#> 17 Florentine Way , <#> Belfast. <#> 29 <sp> th </sp> October </h><p> <#> <&French> Ma cherie Roisin, <#> Ca va? <#> Merci beaucoup pour ta carte postale. </&French> <#> There you are; another snippet from my extensive French repertoire. <#> Hopefully it makes a bit more sense than my usual drunken Snackbar babblings, even though it 's probably not grammatically correct. <#> But what can you expect from a mere medical student? </p><p> <#> Indeed my English is likely to be a little dodgy as I have only yesterday returned to civilisation after a 3-week sojourn to Derry. <#> This was for the express purpose of looking into <}> <-> peoples </-> <+> people 's <+> </}> ears, up their noses and down their throats. <#> The <}> <-> cognesenti </-> <+> cognoscenti </+> </}> call it otorhinolaryngology, but most people can understand it as Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT.) <#> As for our prowess at the subject, we certainly managed to get up a few <}> <-> peoples </-> <+> people 's </+> </}> noses, but unfortunately failed miserably to get down their throats (at the discos, you understand!) </p><p> <#> Alas it is now 16 days since I last was drunk - the longest period since you left. <#> Only Alex and myself are big drinkers amongst the crowd banished to Derry, so there 's not much drinking done there. <#> Even back in Belfast last weekend I was sober since I was racing on Satruday. <#> I actually went to Mulhouse completely sober...and enjoyed it. <#> It 's amazing just how much more gossip you remember without the company of Mr. Guinness. </p><p> <#> Prior to that sobering experience I had really been doing some serious drinking. <#> Three-legged pub crawl, Mystery tour, etc - all <ul> MUST </ul> events. <#> We staged the customary trick played by 4th years on the 1st years on their 1st day. <#> 2 of the lads dressed up as "Doctors" and were introduced as such by a suitably bribed lecturer. <#> They asked alternate questions to 1st years and a few 4th year plants scattered throughout the lecture theatre. <#> Innocent little me was asked to come up to the front and demonstrate some of the movements of the shoulder joint. <#> All according to our hastily arranged script, except no-one told me that to do so properly required me to remove my tee-shirt and stand beetroot - faced in front of a packed lecture theatre, including about 1/2 of our year who had crammed into the back to watch the crack. <#> Still, all in a bit of crack. <#> Since then some of the 1st years have approached me and complimented me on my acting ability; however none of the girls have yet offered me sex having viewed my broad sinews. </p><p> <#> We are settling in nicely into 17. <#> The house has survived <}> <-> it 's </-> <+> its </+> </}> first christening party. <#> The phone, however, did not <}> <-> fair </-> <+> fare </+> </}> as well - Anthony managed to miss everyone with a basin full of water - except the phone. <#> It sounded distinctly sick for a few weeks thereafter and we diagnosed the condition as terminal and invested in a payphone. </p><p> <#> Andrew seems to be coping admirably as the lone non-medic. <#> Well at least technically speaking he isn't, as Gregory is a science student this year - he 's doing an intercalated BSc. <#> Sad to say, we are missing the benefits of the girls...NOT!! <#> No more strange grunting noises from the front room brothel; no more of Jane 's strange friend; able to watch the soccer on a Wednesday night in peace. <#> Allegedly Yasmin is still operating from nearby Florentine Street, but as yet I haven't had the misfortune of bumping into her petite body. </p><p> <#> I 'm just considering my costume for the fancy dress, next week. <#> It can be as ridiculous as ever, but it must fulfil 3 characteristics: 1.) Cheap; 2.) Easy and not too time consuming to assemble; 3.) Not constricting on the night - I decided that the only possible reason for me not getting a tackle last year was that my face was painted green! </p><p> <#> So how 's it going yourself. <#> I 'm glad to hear that you seem to be settling in well and are meeting loads of new people - make sure you don't get too comfortable over there, so that you don't come back to us. <#> Have you found a suitable Guinness drinker to <}> <-> discretely </-> <+> discreetly </+> </}> sip away at his pints. <#> I 've noticed I get more Guinness in my pints these days! </p><p> <#> Do drop us a note if you get a free minute away from all the partying (and studying???) <#> Looking forward to seeing ye at Christmas. </p><p> <#> Best of Luck and Loads of Love, <#> Kevin. </p></I><I><W1B-006$A><h> <#> 16B Newtown Rd. <#> Antrim. <#> 31st January. </h><p> <#> <&French> Ma ch&/ere Roisin, </&French> <#> Sorry that this is going to arrive late. <#> I intended to write last night, but got drunk instead. <#> I 'm sure you 'll understand. </p><p> <#> How 's it going? <#> It seems like only last Friday that I was talking to you in the Mandela. <#> I hope the exams went well, <&French> comme toujours </&French>! <#> Have you been taking swimming lessons recently...or making sandbags, umbrellas. <#> I hear there 's a good profit to be made in such goods in your part of the world. <#> Ha! Ha! </p><p> <#> Things here have been fairly quiet. <#> The main reason for this is not a radical fitness drive, nor lack of money, but that I 'm living back home in happening, party-on-down Antrim. <#> The reason for this in turn is that I 'm working with the nutters in the local madhouse. <#> In particular, I 'm assigned to the 'really fucked up ward.' <#> Here I have the pleasure of being locked in with convicts, psychos, druggies and some plain <}> <-> wierdos </-> <+> weirdos </+> </}> and discussing with them their philosophies in life, why God chose them to rule the world and their psychosexual history. <#> I feel quite at home really. </p><p> <#> It does have its lighter moments. <#> I brought a chronic alcoholic into the interview room and asked him what his major complaint was. <#> He replied that a former schoolmate was coming into the ward each night and cutting a bit of his penis off and that his penis was now this big (placing his thumb and finger a couple of centimetres apart), and what would he do it he chopped it off altogether. <#> Just how to you answer that question or try to console the poor bastard. <#> The worst thing was that his chronic drinking had damaged his brain, so that he couldn't form new memory and hence he kept on forgetting that he had told me this story, so he kept on repeating it, looking for a sensible answer each time. <#> See what alcohol can do to you! </p><p> <#> The next big event on the social calendar is the faculty ball on Fri 3rd (not the only big event that day!) <#> As usual I 'm being accompanied by Mr. Guinness - he may be dear (dear at heart), but at least he doesn't require a ticket ( <*> pound sign </*> 22). <#> Guess who they put in charge of pouring the champagne at the reception. <#> I probably won't remember the rest of the night, but I hope at least that I don't forget telling some medical student in the future that my penis is being chopped off! </p><p> <#> Unfortunately my running is at a standstill, so to speak. <#> I went down to Dublin to see the Irish team doctor with a slight stiffness in the right knee and he injected it with cortisone (a nasty steroid, but don't tell anyone.) <#> By the time I got back to Belfast, the local anaesthetic was beginning to wear off. <> #> By the next morning I couldn't walk because of the pain. <#> That 's bloody doctors for you - don't trust any of them - especially if you know them! <#> By the way, Eddie Condon was on TV last weekend, running in his first GB Senior international. </p><p> <#> Everyone else here is fine. <#> At least I think they are, since I haven't seen them for a couple of weeks (probably not since you have!) </p><p> <#> I must go now to finish writing up my case history of a manic-depressive. <#> So have a great (or should that be past tense) birthday and take care not to get into any mischief. </p><p> <#> Loads of love, <#> Kevin. </p><p> <#> P.S. I just have realised that this is going to be even later than anticipated - your address is in Florentine. </p></I><I><W1B-006$A><h> <#> 17 Florentine Way, <#> 8th June 1995. </h><p> <#> Dear Roisin, <#> How 's it going? <#> Just a quick letter to say <quote> 'hello' </quote> before I pop off to Australia for the summer. <#> I have been meaning to write for some time (bought the Air Mail stamp some time ago indeed), but as usual I have left it to the last minute (I head early on 11th June and have still 2 cases and an essay to write for Friday, a party to go to on Friday night and all my shopping and packing to do!) </p><p> <#> Things had been relatively quiet until recently. <#> I must have seen you last towards the end of April. <#> Since then I have tried to limit my drinking to one night a week, <}> <-> or be it </-> <+> albeit </+> </}> one very big night a week.</p><p> <#> The first weekend in April, our 'section' of the class headed on our first trip to Sellafield (that lovely safe, clean nuclear power station on the other side of the Irish Sea, which has nothing to do at all with leukaemia in children in Co. Down!!) <#> As you can see, they have managed to bullshit and bribe us well - who knows what a few free Guinness and a free meal can do!! <#> We even got to stand on top of a nuclear reactor, and I didn't even get a tan. <#> On the way back from Sellafield, 4 of us jumped off the bus and headed to Glasgow to meet up with another bunch of medics who were meeting up with some Glasgow medics. <#> A nasty weekend indeed - to the tune of <*> pound sign </*> 125. <#> But well worth the lack of memories!!</p><p> <#> The following weekend we had the pleasure of entertaining 4 <&French> jeune femme </&French> from Galway. <#> I would describe them more as 'jolly' than <&French> 'jolie'. </&French> <#> However much alcohol was consumed by all and soon 'jolly' became 'jollier' and finally progressed to <&French> 'jolie' </&French> under the influence of beer glasses. <#> Ask Bill O'Neill sometime - who else? <#> Of course I was too sober to indulge...</p><p> <#> Things got pretty quiet after that, so myself and my entrepreneurial (my, what a big word for a medical student!) partner, Mr Fiachra Ryan took it upon ourselves to organise a 'mystery' tour. <#> To most of us it still remains a mystery, not least to myself. <#> The first destination was a bar in Bushmills where we spent considerable time getting drunk and "singing" <}> <-> karioke </-> <+> karaoke </+> </}> . <#> Considering I was directing the bus-driver <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> a wonder we ever got back at all. <#> At least I did better than Fergie. <#> Apparently he took it upon himself to direct the driver in a difficult reversing manoeuvre at the end of our journey and he navigated the bus directly into a railing. <#> 'Good man, Fergy.' </p><p> <#> The last big social event on the calendar was the year formal last week in the Castle. <#> I even brought a partner this year....the inimitable, stunning, personable...Mr. Patrick Casey. <#> Well he had just finished his exams that day, and he had no-one else to go out with to celebrate, and...well, yes, I am a sad bastard. <#> Nevertheless he enjoyed it, I enjoyed it...all in all, a good <}> <-> nights </-> <+> night 's </+> </}> crack....except for being blown out by a CU girl. <#> I thought that we had her well corrupted and allegedly we had tackled before when we were both very drunk (hence I can't remember it), but obviously she still doesn't know the meaning of a good time!! </p><p> <#> Enough about me and my sad existence. <#> What 's the crack with yourself. <#> I hope you're still enjoying yourself and having a whale of a time and not doing any work. <#> I suppose that the weather 's getting better (it couldn't be worse than here!) and that you're getting lovely and brown and attracting loads of tall, dark and handsome Belgians. <#> Any scandal? </p><p> <#> Must go now before I run out of paper. <#> It 's 2am and I have to still write up another case. <#> So best of luck in the exams and other pursuits. <#> I suppose you 'll be home again before me (27th August), so see ye then. </p><p> <#> <&French> Au revoir et bisses </&French> , Idiom or idiotic? <#> Kevin. </p><p> <#> PS: My address in Aussie (19th June - 28th July) is; Queens Base Hospital, Sydney, NSW3691. </p></I>
