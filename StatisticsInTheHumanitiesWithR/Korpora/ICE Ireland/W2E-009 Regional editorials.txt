<W2E-009 Regional editorials><I><W2E-009$A><h> <bold> <#> BUY IRISH AND BUY LOCAL THIS CHRISTMAS </bold> </h><p> <#> In an era, when the level of international trade reaches new heights, the facility to buy overseas products is easier than ever. <#> But should we not think first before we buy? </p><p> <#> Local jobs should be supported where possible. </p><p> <#> Here in Waterford, we have many fine industries producing excellent products that deserve patronisation this Christmas. <#> For those on a higher budget, you could buy glass from Waterford Crystal. <#> Children could be bought Milton Bradley toys. <#> Individual gifts could be purchased that are locally made, whether by local crafts people. <#> The emphasis could also be on local food and drink. <#> We should try and keep business and employment in the area, where possible. </p><p> <#> According to recent statistics released by the Waterford Trades Council last month, <*> pound sign </*> 6 is spent on imported goods for every <*> dollar sign </*> 4 spent on Irish made goods. <#> If the balance could be split the other way, 30,000 to 40000 jobs could be created. <#> Other countries are very proud of their home produce. <#> The French rave about their wonderful food and their great cars, which they buy more than foreign ones. <#> In England, foreign goods have tended to be very popular, has the same trend started here, with goods being sourced often in low cost countries? </p><p> <#> The large preponderance of foreign owned stores in Ireland in the past ten years has led to more consumer imports. </p><p> <#> The Trades Council has advised shoppers before Christmas to ask to see the Irish made product and compare the quality and price with other goods. <#> Positive action can be taken at Christmas time, when there is a consumer boom, to spend more on Irish and locally produced goods where possible. </p><p> <#> We, in the "Munster Express", feel that our local advertisers also deserve support at this time of year. <#> There is often the temptation to go to Cork or to Dublin, or even further afield as people chase bargains. <#> This year, the big rush has been to Northern Ireland, now that we have a ceasefire. </p><p> <#> Waterford city centre has progressed a great deal over the past decade in terms of shopping choice. <#> It is now a truly regional shopping mecca, given the large number of shopping malls that we now have. </p><p> <#> In line with the growth and trade in Waterford, other towns such as Dungarvan, New Ross and Carrick on Suir are making a bigger push to get a slice of the retail spend, emphasising their strengths such as parking and convenience for the shopper. </p><p> <#> We would ask our readers to encourage their families and friends to support local retailers and local products, as the Waterford Trades Council has done. </p><p> <#> This year could be a record Christmas in terms of spending power and should give a boost to shops, some of whom may have had a difficult year to date. </p><h> <bold> <#> CHARITIES DESERVE SUPPORT </bold> </h><p> <#> Local charities such as the Vincent de Paul deserve our support as well at this time of year. <#> They are in the front line of contact with those who are badly in need of help. <#> In last week 's paper, we related a story revealing that by the end of this year a quarter of a million pounds will be spent on its services, which included 16,000 visits. </p><p> <#> The Lions Club appeal will also assist many needy families at Christmas, auction items of which we carry on page 29. </p><p> <#> Bishop of Waterford, Most Rev. Dr. William Lee, has said that the increased demands on the St. Vincent de Paul Society would need to be met so that families in need could look to the future with some glimmer of hope. <#> Contributions were never so badly needed as at present. </p><p> <#> We would hope that the people of Waterford would support their local charities. <#> At this time of year, many charities actively fundraise, we should encourage local charities as much as possible. <#> City Manager, Michael Doody, said that every penny collected by the Society went straight into aid. </p></I><I><W2E-009$B><h> <ul> <bold> <#> VOICE OF THE PEOPLE </ul> </bold> </h><h> <it> <bold> <#> Public pay is the key to growth </it> </bold> </h><p> <#> THE PROSPECTIVE political partners are just now finalising their programme for what they describe as a <it> Government for Renewal. </it> <#> If they can indeed provide a sense of renewal after the appalling conflicts of the last few weeks, then their new administration will be widely welcomed. </p><p> <#> But they do have a major task ahead. <#> The current negotiations are private, but we must assume that public sector pay is one of the key problems to be sorted out. <#> If this issue is not tackled head on, then this incoming Government will fail to deliver the economic and social benefits which are the essential dynamo for growth. </p><p> <#> The entire thrust of recent government policy has been to tax wage earners highly, to penalise industry and to extract the very maximum taxation on all economic activity. <#> This extra money has been expropriated from the public by the Revenue Commissioners with ruthless efficiency. <#> That has been the real policy of the outgoing government and the Revenue Commissioners have carried out that policy dutifully. <#> That is their job. </p><p> <#> The money collected has been transferred from individual wage earners in the private sector directly into the pockets of those working in the public sector. <#> Thus, since 1987 wages in the public sector have risen by 70 <*> percent sign </*> , compared with a 44 <*> per cent sign </*> increase for everyone else. </p><p> <#> Not only has that policy been unfair, it has had the effect of seriously slowing down, if not strangling, firms which otherwise would have been able to offer more employment. <#> That policy has to stop, it has to be reversed. </p><p> <#> The outgoing Government constantly told us how good they were, but there was a large element of bluff in all their insistent assurances. <#> In fact, the last Government was held to ransom by the public sector. <#> The price was paid dearly by the unemployed and by those tens of thousands of bright young people who had to emigrate. <#> The funds which should have generated jobs were swept away into the public purse. <#> That was the true record of the last Government. </p><p> <#> It was a policy which denied hundreds of thousands of our young people a right to live their lives, and to develop their careers here. <#> Those educated young people who are working in London, Birmingham, Paris and Berlin and as illegals in the United States have been cheated also of their Irish inheritance. <#> That policy can be changed, it must be changed. </p><p> <#> The incoming Government must reduce taxes for lower paid workers. <#> That is the only way in which their standard of living can increase. <#> The new administration must insist on striking a more equitable balance between the public and the private sectors. </p><p> <#> We believe that the Democratic Left, Fine Gael and the Labour Party will receive a strong, positive response if, together as a united front, they adopt a policy of social reform, based on equality and justice. </p><p> <#> The Democratic Left is a Party with concise and practical ideas on the creation and the distribution of wealth and we do not believe that they are in any way the Party of extremists, as they are sometimes portrayed. </p><p> <#> Similarly, once the Labour Party abandon their excessive use of shallow, public relations hyperbole and empty moral platitudes, they will gain greatly in public respect and will be in a better position to implement policies of genuine reform. <#> Fine Gael should also be able to work well with these partners because, despite its traditional middle class support, it has always been inspired by popular radicalism which was epitomised over a generation ago by Declan Costello 's <it> Just Society </it> document. <#> For all these reasons we believe that the partners share a common idealism and zeal for reform. </p><p> <#> The new partners certainly have the potential and they have the will. <#> All they require is a genuine unity of purpose, a spirit of tolerance and a determination to be truly loyal to each other, at least for their term in office. <#> It can be done. <#> In the interests of the country it must be done. </p></I><I><W2E-009$C><h> <bold> <#> Time to Think of the Electorate </bold> </h><p> <#> Over the past week John Bruton 's star seems to have taken on a new brightness in the political firmament. <#> Up to a few weeks ago many were writing him, and his party, off for anything better than the opposition benches. <#> Now all that has changed. <#> The in-words of accountability and transparency have been joined by the new brand of truth launched by Ray Burke last week - "unvarnished". <#> Mr. Burke wants a visible and immediate presence of the new product. </p><p> <#> We don't know just yet where the compass will stop or how much left of centre the new coalition will be. <#> John Bruton will need to be a firm negotiator and Taoiseach if he is to build into the formula the required measure of control of the economy, at a time when public spending is three times more than the rate of inflation. <#> The Labour Party, during all the huffs and the kiss-and-make-up sagas reached highs and lows in its stance on the "high moral ground". <#> It was left to Geraldine Kennedy of the "Irish Times" to come up with a very crucial and well written story which seemed to put the final nail in the coffin of the Fianna Fail/Labour alliance. <#> Indeed some women came into their own in a very responsible way and the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Mary Harney, was the star of the nation during some of the earlier contributions in Leinster House. <#> In all coalitions compromise is the name of the game in policies and in the selection of the Cabinet. <#> Misfits in essential key portfolios would be our downfall. </p><p> <#> As we write the show is still very much in rehearsal, and the controversies as to who said what and when, continue. <#> We have had our share of entertainment over the past fortnight. <#> Now comes the real business of running the country. <#> There is no room for farce, comedy, stage-Irishism, buffoonery or ineptitude. <#> The electorate should have been given the opportunity to make the choice, but since that has not happened we can only hope and pray that what comes out of the bag will serve us well over the next few years. </p><h> <bold> <#> A Minimal Sacrifice </bold> </h><p> <#> The St. Vincent de Paul Society have launched their annual appeal and all indications are that the demands are ever growing to help meet the needs of the poor and underprivileged. </p><p> <#> Those of us who indulge in excesses of food and drink and cosset ourselves with some of the luxuries of life, could easily make a gesture which could be significant for many families in need. <#> If we decide that we will be spending <*> pound sign </*> 20 on these excesses could we not with much benefit to our health set aside half of that amount for the St. Vincent de Paul Society? <#> It would make Christmas so much more meaningful and it can be done with little effort by very many who at present make little or no contribution. </p></I>
