<ICE-IRE:S2A-059 Candles><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-059$A> <#> Hello there and you 're very welcome to our final programme before Christmas <#> Well today we 're going to make candles <#> And in fact it 's rather a repeat of one that I did last year because it was so popular <,> and so many of you wrote in wanting to know how to do the candles that I said I had to do them all over again <#> So we have a variety of candles here on display on the table <#> They 're all lit at the moment <,> <#> So of course when you light candles always be very careful <#> And uh I 'll just show them to you very quickly <#> First of all we have these ones <#> They 're called uh rock candles <#> And they 're in bright colours pink and yellow there <#> Then uh we have a variety of striped ones <#> Here are the striped ones here <,> look like that lots of different colours and they look very well <#> And uh we also have ones which are <,> we call sand-cast candles and here they are in front <#> And if you hold them up there you can see that they 're all coated with uh sand underneath so they give them a sort of a sand covering and that 's why they 're called sand-cast candles <#> And then finally we have sort of more conventional ones <,> these ones here uhm in various different shapes <,> round ones and <,> rectangular ones and various ones like that <#> And they 're made from sort of conventional moulds <#> So those are the candles <#> And uh as usual if you 'd like to come over with me here <,> and uh we 'll show you all the bits and pieces that you need <#> And this week you might need to do a little bit of shopping because I 'm sure you won't have a lot of the ingredients at home <#> But uh we 'll show you what 's uh on display here and then you can decide what you need <#> The first thing you need is some candle wax <#> And uh you can either buy it in a bag like this in crystal form <,> it looks a bit like a bag of sugar <,> or you can actually buy just ordinary white candles that you can get in a supermarket or a hardware shop and melt them down <#> Now a lot of people had problems last year saying they couldn't get this wax <,> so don't worry if you can't get this wax <,> just get this sort of stuff <#> The next thing you need is some candle wick <#> You 'll get that in most craft shops <,> <#> Then you need ordinary crayons <,> any crayons that 's used for colouring <#> Uhm you need some tin cans empty tin cans <,> some wooden clothes pegs <#> It 's better to use the wooden ones than the plastic ones cos they tend to melt <#> You also need some uhm paper cups or you can use yoghurt cartons or cream cartons <#> You need a milk carton and uh you need a bucket of sand or a basin of sand <#> Just something to hold some sand in <#> So uhm <,> that 's the first things that you need <#> Now the <,> starting off what you have to do is you have to sort of set yourself up and you decide what colours you 're going to use <#> And uh you start with your <,> uhm bag of wax <,> and you need an empty tin can <#> So <,> you put some <,> wax <,> into the tin can <,> and uh just fill it about that much a sort of a little thickish layer at the end of the can <#> And uh we 'll put this wax away cos we won't need it any more for the moment <#> And then you decide on what colours you want <#> So say we 're going to do a pink one <#> You get your pink crayon and you tear off the paper <#> You don't use the papers <,> and uh <,> tear it off <,> all gone and then just break it in half <,> so that uh it 's like that in the top of the wax <#> And all you do then is get uhm a wooden clothes peg and clip it on there <#> And the wooden the reason we use the wooden ones is the the if you use the plastic ones they tend to melt <#> And you have to <.> al </.> have already set up on your cooker <,> uhm a saucepan of <,> uh boiling water <#> And you sort of turn it down to a simmer but uhm <,> make sure that the water is fairly hot and be very careful when you 're doing this <#> Now I 'll just <,> clip <,> the can <,> down to the side <,> uh of <,> the <,> uhm saucepan <,> like that <#> So I have a variety of different colours set up there <#> I have pink and green and blue and orange and that 's the way we go <#> So we decide <.> wha </.> we 're going to do the first ones are striped candles and we 're going to use a paper cup <#> So we start off with the paper cup <#> And then you can cut some some wick <,> and make the wick <,> uh taller than the actual <,> uhm paper cup <#> So put a little bit of masking tape on the end of it <#> You can also use sellotape if you don't have this masking tape but the masking tape <,> tends to work a little bit better <#> So then you get a pencil <#> Oops this is sticking to the end here <#> <.> Jus </.> get a pencil <,> and uh flatten it down inside like this <,> like that <,> okay <#> And uh <,> all you do then is uh you get your pencil <,> and then <,> you roll it <,> around like this several times <,> <#> So <,> you 're using it <,> like that so it rests on the top of the cup <#> And then you get some more masking tape or sellotape whichever <,> and uh you just keep it down like that <#> So that 's how you set up for the actual uh striped candles <#> Now the next thing you do <,> is that you decide say at this stage that uh some of your wax has melted <#> So uhm we 'll just <,> stir around here <,> different cans and we have some here <#> And uh say we 'll start with some green wax <#> So you go over to <,> your can and uh try and use <,> uhm an oven glove or something <,> to hold the can because it will be very hot <#> So just mix it around with a little stick <,> and then <,> pour in <,,> a layer <,> like that <#> So you just put in half a layer really <,> just a small layer at the end <,> and uh you leave that aside and you let it set <#> So we 'll just put this candle over here <,> and you let it set <#> And then when that has set you would add in another layer of wax and then you let that set <#> So that uh eventually <,> you will come to the stage where your cup is nearly filled up with wax <#> There 's some green wax <#> And a good idea really is to put a little uhm notice on the front <#> Stick a bit of paper onto the front of your cup and put down the different colours <#> Say one is going to be blue two red green or whatever <#> So we 're going to put the final coat on top of that <#> And uh I think uh we 'll top it off with some orange wax <#> So we have <,> some orange wax melted here <#> And this one has come off slightly so we 'll just pin it on <,> <#> So we make the <.> w </.> orange wax <#> Uhm <,> melt it round like this <,> and then <,> top off the candle <,,> top like that <#> Okay <#> So there you see your orange wax <#> Alright <#> So again you leave that to set <#> And you really have to leave it to set for about an hour or so <,> until eventually hopefully uhm it 's <,> completely uhm set <#> So all we do then is we just bring over our candles <#> We 've some here that we 've already set earlier on <,> and uhm <,> you just roll off this part here <#> Take off the the wick and then you can get your scissors <,,> and uh trim the wick <,,> like that <,> and then <,,> you can <,> cut open the paper cup <#> Now be careful <,,> so that uh <,> <#> And there you can see <,> the various different colours <,> coming to light <#> Okay <#> So there you 've got a very nice <,> striped candle <#> We 'll just do <.> i </.> quickly with this one <,> to give us another idea <#> Trim off the wick <,> take off the pencil <#> And uh <,> just cut into the top of the cup <,> and we 'll just see what colours uh this one reveals <,> <#> All sorts of greens and <,> blues <,> and <,> purples <#> So uh <,> there 's another one <#> And uh there you 've got two nice striped candles <#> So those are the first ones <#> And we 'll set all these aside <,> and uh we 'll move the candles over here for the moment <#> Now the second ones we 're going to do <,> are the ones with the sand <#> And you start off with the bucket of sand or any sort of a container really which will hold sand <#> You get a little bit of wick <,,> and uh <,,> you put the wick in there <,> <#> And you roll it round the top <,,> uh <,> top of your stick <#> And then get a little bit of masking tape once more <#> And uh this is fairly simple <#> You make a hole as I have done there <,> with the spoon <#> See the hole I 've made there with the spoon I just uh pressed that out there with the spoon <#> And all you have to do then is uhm to get your wax <,> and say we decide this is going to be a blue one <,> you have some blue <,> wax melting away here <#> So we just lift out the blue wax <,> take off the peg <,> if you want to <,> hold it up <,> and then <,,> pour it in like that <,> <#> Now <,> that should be enough <,> to there <#> And uh you really in fact have to leave these uh sand-cast ones to <,> set overnight <#> So that uh we 'll just put it aside here <#> And the wax has just gone a little bit running around the sand <,> but eventually <,> uhm when it 's set overnight it should uh look like this one here <,> fairly solid <#> So all we do is once more <,> just uh roll off your pen or whatever you have <,> holding up the wick <,> trim if off <,> and then <,> get a spoon <,,> and dig it out <,> <#> So now you see you 've got a a nice coating of sand all around the back of the candle <,> and uh that 's what it looks like in front <#> So that 's called a sand-cast candle <#> And I 'll put it down there beside the striped ones <#> Okay <#> So they 're very simple to do <#> Uh the next ones <,> are with uh the milk carton <#> And uh you need in fact for this <,> a a candle that you can buy in uh a supermarket <,> the ordinary white candles I was telling you to use if you don't get the candle wax <#> Get that <,> say cut it into half <,> get your milk carton and cut it down to around that size <#> Okay <#> Uh you also need some ice cubes for this <#> Well we 'll start first of all <,> uhm <,> with our wax <#> So we 'll start say with some red wax here <#> And what you do is <,> take the wax off <,,> lift off the peg <#> Be gentle <#> You pour a little bit of wax <,,> into <,> the end of uh your carton <#> Then you get in your candle <,> and you set it in <,> and the wax should hold on to it <#> And then what you do is you get your ice cubes <,> a bowl of ice cubes <,> and you start to <,> fill up all around the candle <,> with some ice cubes <#> Okay <,> <#> So uh <,> we 're just filling it up here with ice cubes <,> oops <,,> and around here <#> Your hands will be fairly cold after all this <#> And uh there you go <#> We should have uh enough ice cubes around that <#> You can sort of leave the candle sticking up a bit <#> Okay so <,> finally what you do then with this one is <,> you go back to get your wax again <,> and then you just pour it all over <,> the ice cubes <,> <#> And you can even pour it round the candle a little bit <,> <#> And in fact <,> the uh wax sets pretty quickly because uhm <,> the ice actually harden its hardens it <#> So uh <,> there you go <#> Have a look at it like that <#> Alright <#> So now you actually have to leave those to set overnight as well <#> And uh when they are set overnight <,> you should end up <,> with I have two here one in orange and one in pink <#> And uh you 'll begin to see that there 's water coming to the top of them <#> And what actually has happened is that the ice has melted <,> and all these bubbly shapes you <.> se </.> you see there <,> they have all been formed by the ice cubes <#> So what you do is then you go over to your sink <,> and uh <,> you just pour out the water <#> Just empty them out <,> <#> It should be <,> more or less emptied out now <#> And then we just go back <,> and get our scissors once more <,> and <,,> start to cut <,> and then take off <#> And uh you get a really nice shaped <.> cand </.> <#> These ones are my favourite I must say <#> They 're called rock candles cos you get very interesting shapes <,> and uh they sort of look different each time</I>
