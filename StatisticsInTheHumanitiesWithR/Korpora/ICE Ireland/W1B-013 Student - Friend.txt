<W1B-013 Student - Friend><I><W1B-013$A><h> <#> Kevin O'Neill <#> <*> hash sign </*> 24, Beacon Crt. <#> 61 Hill St.<#> Perth W.A. 6000 <#> Australia </h><p> <#> Dear Ben, <#> Hi Ben I thought I 'd write about this time of the year so as to give you a refreshing break from the turgid pile of exam papers that must be adorning your desk about now. <#> As the recent request for a reference lets you know I have eventually found a job. <#> As is my style I seem to have <}> <-> dscovered </-> <+> discovered </+> </}> the new frontier just as it has finished squandering <}> <-> it 's </-> <+> its </+> </}> wealth and is <}> <-> sliping </-> <+> slipping </+> </}> into a 70's style Irish recession. <#> Over the last three months I have applied for the few jobs on offer but my visa restricted me a great deal. <#> At one point I had a locum position but the funding was withdrawn - does that sound familiar? <#> However it never dribbles but it pisses out of the heavens as they say in Dublin, once the first offer came through it was followed by six more in the next four days! <#> My only guess is that next <}> <-> years </-> <+> year 's </+> </}> budgets have just been cleared and can only <}> <-> acommodate </-> <+> accommodate </+> </}> temporary positions. <#> The job I 've accepted is for three months and as you can see from the letter from the Royal Perth Hospital will be a challenge and a learning experience.</p><p> <#> I 'm still looking into studying medicine in the States or indeed here. <#> Things look good here if I can become a resident, then it will not cost me anything and I may be eligible for grants. <#> So I 'm applying for a permanent visa at the moment. <#> The chances are that I 'll have to return to Ireland in the Autumn to apply to the embassy there as the law has recently been changed making it difficult to apply from here. <#> Experience in a hospital setting will be a great advantage in any interviews I may have to do. <#> I think I need to accumulate as many accountable factors in my favor, as for whatever reasons my college academic performance most probably will not be good enough on <}> <-> it 's </-> <+> its </+> </}> own. <#> In autumn I am going to sit the American College Admissions Test but for <}> <-> know </-> <+> now </+> </}> I need to get a copy of "my transcript" - I 'm hoping you know what that is. <#> I 've enclosed a paragraph referring to it in the hope you may enlighten me. <#> I have copies of my course format - lecture and clinical hours. <#> I also need a copy of a transcript of my academic results while in college, perhaps this is what they mean? <#> I would appreciate if you could find the time to send whatever it is you think they want and my academic record. <#> Thanks. </p><p> <#> So far my travels have been a great experience, eating an unusual ethnic fruit in <}> <-> Singapores </-> <+> Singapore 's </+> </}> China Town that was as close as I 've come to cannabalism since living in Rooms in college; searching the Out-Back for half the night on horse back for my older brother whose sense of direction was directly proportional to the <}> <-> horses </-> <+> horses 's </+> </}> IQ and this horse was no Mr. Edd and the stories could go on. <#> The weather is fabulous and the beaches <}> <-> superbe </-> <+> superb </+> </}> so while the summer lasted things were quite leisurely. <#> Now you 'll be pleased to know the weather has turned, it was a cool 26 <*> degrees sign </*> C today. <#> In September we are going to tour the country and <}> <-> Thialand </-> <+> Thailand </+> </}> if money and plans work out. <#> I 'll send you a post card from somewhere along the trail. <#> Until then I hope you and your family have a good summer. </p><p> <#> Thanks for your help.<#> Yours sincerely <#> Kevin O'Neill </p><p> <#> Excuse the typing but I seem to have a blind <}> <-> typewritter </-> <+> typewriter. </+> </}></p></I><I><W1B-013$B><h> <#> Tues/snowing/ugh </h><p> <#> Liz! <#> A few hours ago I spoke to Irene - she told me 'sorta' all <*> ampersand </*> no doubt she told me you my all, I think <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> just the AGE! <#> You can only adjust to so much <*> ampersand </*> then it goes. <#> She 'll be OK - it sounds to me. <#> I was trying to get her defer this year at college - perhaps. <#> Her trouble is she refuses to go into depth if you know what I mean. <#> Just put her head down <*> ampersand </*> goes for it all the time closing down her parameters. </p><p> <#> Sometimes I feel as if I could sit there write the script, hand it to her <*> ampersand </*> she 'd laugh <*> ampersand </*> cry at the right intervals <*> ampersand </*> <}> <-> thats </-> <+> that 's </+> </}> called social exchange <*> ampersand </*> I have suspected for a long time she does it to herself <*> ampersand </*> Jim <*> ampersand </*> children as well. </p><p> <#> Anyway she knows where I am and I 'm sane <*> ampersand </*> normal since I managed to persuade doctors their job is not just to give me antibiotics <*> ampersand </*> beta blockers (neither of which I take). <#> I 've been there, bought the tee shirt, read the book, bought the CD, seen the video et al. </p><p> <#> Madness (not real serious stuff. <#> N. breakdowns) seem to be coming out of the woodwork at the moment. <#> Spent all yesterday trying to get a friend sectioned to the bin who thinks Putney is a suburb of Russia <*> ampersand </*> she 's married to a guy from Star Wars boy was that a boring film. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Whats </-> <+> What 's </+> </}> wrong with Stephen Rea - I 'd eat him for breakfast - know people who know him but decided I couldn't wangle an invite as I might <}> <-> salavate </-> <+> salivate </+> </}> at the table just that bit too much. </p><p> <#> Well <}> <-> whats </-> <+> what 's </+> </}> new! <#> Well me for one - back in the land of the living. <#> HRT - I <}> <-> heartilly </-> <+> heartily </+> </}> recommend horse piss. <#> Great stuff. <#> 3 days <*> ampersand </*> <}> <-> your </-> <+> you 're </+> </}> human again. <#> Had all the allergy tests pollen/trees/cats/horses <*> ampersand </*> guinea pigs?
