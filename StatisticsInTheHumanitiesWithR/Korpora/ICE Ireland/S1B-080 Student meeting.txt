stuff going on that is problematic <,,> <#> Uhm Orla <,> who will be listening to this <#> Can you omit certain bits and pieces of it<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> It 's all highly confidential and they don't care about the content <#> It 's just the structural <,> structure of Hiberno-English<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Do we have to be serious about those forms<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> What do you mean <#> Yes <,> Adrian<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Whoops <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Okay <#> Okay that 's fine okay that 's fine <#> Come in <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> Okay uhm in Medicine I 'm getting hospital IDs <,> we don't get hospital IDs from Saint James 's <,> I need to acquire them <#> We 've been talking a little bit about that before <#> I 've made progress actually I 've been talking to the CEO in Saint James 's <#> He was down in Kilkenny <,> oh yeah yeah we were in Kilkenny you know and he goes oh yeah that 's right <,> have a chat <,> so I 'm <{> <[> getting <,> </[> I 'm getting progress on that <#> Sorry<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Sorry<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> Mr Cahill<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> No that 's Nab <.> K </.> no no no <#> <.> Fre </.> Fred O'Regan<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$E> <#> Oh yeah <#> He was on my working group<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> He 's small and boring<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$E> <#> <{> <[> He 's a <,> very nice man </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$F> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Lesbians<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$E> <#> Sh<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Right anyway back to the subject at hand <#> Another problem in Medicine is the <,> is Simpson <,> Professor Simpson is determined to introduce a surgery exam by the end of this year in complete contravention <,> in complete contravention of the college calendar <#> Now he really is delusional <,> probably some sort of psychotic break he 's had because he thinks he can just bypass the college calendar <,> eh <,> which is absolute rubbish <#> And it 's something that I will actually have to face him down on and it 's not something I 'm looking forward to because he 's a <#> I don't <,> he 's he 's very odd and he 's a bit kind of vindictive <#> So <#> It 's going to be fun <#> Uhm <,> fifth year <,> sixth year <,> they 're kind of ticking along <#> There 's too much focus on <,> fourth year because they want to fix it therefore fifth year are neglected<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> Someone has to suffer<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Someone has to suffer and sadly people have to suffer <#> But that 's pretty much it <#> Uhm <,> <.> med </.> <,> nursing<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> Uhm <,> the biggest thing from the first years is their classroom size <,> too small <,> too crowded <#> And their schedule <,> because it 's booked so late they 've early <.> m < </.> early starts and late finishes so their day is actually very long <#> That 's all I 've got from them so far<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> But uhm <,> the biggest problem with me is actually contacting students <#> I 've had resistance as I said to you from the tutors already <#> They don't want me to contact them through classrooms <,> so they <.> t </.> want me to go through Trinity <,> and I 'm not authorised yet to access the email listings <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> <,> so hopefully soon<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> <[> Hopefully soon </> </{> <,> hopefully soon<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> That 'll open up the channel of communication <#> I 'll be able to get somewhere then <,> get more topics going<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Okay well just get on to Stephanie Brennan and the various course co-ordinators and just try and sort that there out <#> They know all know about the situation<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> They all know about me yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> They all know about you so it 's just really tackle it from there <#> Well just go <,> but I mean like <,> whenever I hit a brick wall what I do is actually I go to the person at the top and then you work your way down from the top <{> <[> to </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[> Are </[> </{> you not meant to start from the bottom and work your way up Tom<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> No but you 'll hit <,> they 'll just say no and then you 'll you 'll spend <{> <[> three layers going through </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> But as you you hit a blank wall <[> you just go up higher </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> No but you you just <,> you you hit resistance <,> then you hit resistance then you hit resistance <,> because the one at the top can tell the one at the very bottom <#> So you don't have to through the whole chain of demand <#> The one at the top <{> <[> just says </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> <[> But could </[> </{> you not piss a lot of people off when you 're doing it that way<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> Yeah that 's <,> that 's what I 've been told<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> You can piss a lot of people off <,> you have to <{> <[> <,> you have to be tactful </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[> Cos like I 'm told I have to go to staff </[> </{> meetings <,> school committee <,> faculty exec <{> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$J> <#> <[> That 's for big decisions </[> </{> but if you 've a problem that needs solved such as getting in contact <{> <[> with students </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[> Oh yeah that's fair enough </[> </{> <#> You just go <{> <[> straight up </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> <[> I mean I know that my </[> </{> <,> I 'm not just doing I can't do my <,> act out my role when I can't contact the <{1> <[1> students </[1> <#> And then they 've heard of me <,> I know that they know there 's somebody appointed but they 've no contact with <{2> <[2> me either </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> <#> Well <.> ge </.> <,> get on to Stephanie Brennan <{1> <[1> anyway </[1> and sort it with her <#> You you actually are in a unique role by <{2> <[2> having <,> such a lot of people lot of people to deal with </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> <[2> Yeah <,> no <,> I 've already spoken to a lot of <,> I was actually </[2> </{2> <,> I was lecturing psychiatry students from Pat 's <,> Brendan 's and uhm Saint Loman 's last week so I spoke to all of them and gave them all my email address like <,> for any student issues but they haven't got back to me on any yet <#> So they know about me anyway<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> There probably won't be very much going on in the School of Nursing that is problematic <#> Most of your role will be helping out the School of Nursing in the whole faculty <{1> <[1> perspective </[1> <{2> <[2> anyway </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[2> Once they know </[2> </{2> <,> I think<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> Once they know about me and can contact me it <{> <[> should be </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$G> <#> <[> It 's unfortunate as well </[> </{> <,> because of nursing you 're going to run into problems with <,> they 're going to be under pressure from the government to try and get as many nurses in as they can<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$G> <#> So they 're always going to throw that back to you <,> <#> Och Jesus <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> I suppose it <,> it 's going to <,> and obviously you talked before about starting up a nursing society <#> That 'll all come in time <,> <{> <[> as they come </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> <[> That will that will </[> </{> we 'll we 'll work on that <#> By the end of this year we 'll have <{> <[> one set up </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[> Do they want to </[> </{> go under the therapy society<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> They 're an awful large crowd<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> There 's a huge amount <#> I mean I 've <,> I 've been given like fifteen like <,> I 've been given a list of just thirty student reps already<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> What<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Oh wow<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> That I 've <,> that are under me <#> I actually have their names representing midwifery and and I 've thirty names already I 've been given<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> And uh that 's not including most of the post-grads <,> that 's all undergraduates and<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> How many are there altogether anyway <,> undergrads<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> I think it 's fifteen hundred students in total<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> Oh my God<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Oh yeah <#> There 's going to be there 's going to be over two and a half thousand in four years ' time<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> Yeah <#> There 's fifteen hundred at the moment and there 's thirty reps <,> <{> <[> the names I 've been given </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> <[> That 's why </[> </{> <,> yeah <,> that 's why it 's very important to get a handle on the whole nurses ' course now<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> But I 've <.> al </.> I 've already written to Drogheda and the Rotunda <,> like to the school of whatever <,> the School of Nursing to let them know about me and try and get the reps <,> you know <,> to register with the students union but I 've heard nothing back<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Just keep <,> just just keep plugging on that one but <,> co-ordinate with Stephanie <#> Have you have you actually met her yet<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> Yeah I did <#> In Kilkenny yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Well now get <,> well <,> on the nineteenth of November we 'll be meeting everybody anyway <#> So get onto them there <#> Uhm <,> anything else<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$D> <#> No that 's it for the moment<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Right <#> Your good self Adrian <#> What 's to report<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Big strike in Dental Hospital<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Has that started<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Yes <#> <{> <[> It 's </[> in the second week now<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> <[> Well </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> How many<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> There 's talk of it being resolved by next week<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> There 's going to be a lot of talk on <{> <[> this matter </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[> Who 's striking </[> </{> and why<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Part-time staff <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> Administration <#> Or<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> No <,> clinical staff <,> clinical teachers<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> Right <#> Okay<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Well not just clinical teachers <,> all the part-time teaching staff <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> What exactly do they want<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> They want recognition of <,> their teaching <#> They want uh<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> But all you have to<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Certify as uh <,> do you remember we

anyway<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> Yeah but still we all went to the other groups <#> I remember that yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$C> <#> Yeah <,> the one about retentions of <{> <[> part-time staff </[> was certification of teaching and teaching abilities and all that kind of stuff <#> They want that <#> Uhm apparently they 're also getting <,> which the students don't really know <,> is that they 're also getting a hundred percent pay increase as well<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> Well you see it 's money that uh that really cannot be changed <#> I mean it goes through <,> it comes from the Department of Health <,> their salary as teachers <,> and <{> <[> that really cannot be changed </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#> <[> I don't think it 's our concern though </[> </{> is it <#> Those people striking <#> <{> <[> I mean it 's not like </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> <[> Yes it is </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-080$B> <#>

only<ICE-IRE:S1B-080$A> <#> You see the thing is is <,> the thing though is that <,> the thing that you must appreciate is that when you have a deadlock between the staff and other staff <,> it 's
