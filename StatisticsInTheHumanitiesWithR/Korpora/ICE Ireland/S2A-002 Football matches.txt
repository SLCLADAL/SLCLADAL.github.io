<ICE-IRE:S2A-002 Football matches><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-002$A> <#> As they say it 's all to play for in the second half <#> Cavan four points in front <,> and Martin McHugh will have told them that they must play and play for these thirty minutes <,> because the lead isn't great considering the conditions <,> <#> Pat Dooley for Roscommon <,> you can see the ease with which he kicked that ball in the wind <#> Good block <,> very good block from Gerry Sheridan on Don Connellan but Connellan wins possession again and this time Sheridan not so cultured <#> Free kick for Roscommon <#> And with the conditions as they are <,> you would expect <,> you would expect Nigel Dineen to be able to point from here <#> And if you give away needless frees like that Cavan <,> you 'll find in no time the sides will be back level <#> So Dineen the ball <,> as you can see <,> practically on the thirteen metre line <#> You should be pointing them from there and Dineen certainly is capable of it <#> One goal in five <,> just five points <,,> <#> Interesting to see how Brendan McCormick copes with the conditions on the kick-out <#> Again the ball hanging and dropping <#> And Dineen <,> winning possession fouled on the forty-five metre line <,> and he take the kick himself <#> Martin McHugh will be hoping against hope that that lead isn't eaten away in the first five minutes of the second half <#> Promotion to division two guaranteed for Cavan if they win today <#> You have to fancy them to be in the quarter final stages <,> <#> And that one 's wasted from Nigel <,> and much to the delight of the three thousand or so fans <,> the sun has returned and let 's hope it shines for the rest of the game <,,> <#> Pat Shiels breaking and Roscommon getting the breaking ball again through Vinnie Glennon <,> and Vinnie plays it out the wing and it 's Lorcan Dowd <,> too much space Lorcan Dowd and he makes more for himself <#> Dowd has a look at the target <,> <#> Well-taken point <#> Lorcan Dowd for Roscommon <#> There 's just two between them <,,> <#> Well if the sun is shining for anyone it 's shining for Paul Ross at the moment <#> Brendan McCormick thought he had to deal with hailstones in the second half now it 's the sun shining in his eyes that 's the problem <#> We 're having every form of weather condition today <#> This is Adrian Lambe for Cavan <,> trying to make himself some space <,> the ball cleared by Tom Grehan <,> and there 's open space now for Nigel Dineen <,> but McCormick arrives in time <,> or has he <#> Lorcan Dowd <,> Dowd punches and Dowd scores <,> but really <,> there should have been a goal for Roscommon a moment ago <#> However <,> Lorcan Dowd <,> picking up the breaking ball and punching it over the bar <#> That 's a vital score <,> <#> The bad news for Cavan is the fact that Brendan McCormick while making that very good save has injured his thigh <#> It seems like a dead leg from here <,> and to try and play in goal with such an injury is practically impossible <#> So Martin McHugh may consider taking on the sub-goalkeeper <#> The advice sometimes is to run the injury off but when you 're a goalkeeper it 's exceptionally difficult to do that and when you have a dead leg it tends to become stiffer and stiffer as the game goes by <#> So disadvantage Cavan at the moment but advantage to them in the way that McCormick came out to stop Dineen a few moments ago <,> <#> There 's just a point between them <#> It 's one five Cavan <,> seven points Roscommon <#> And it 's broken again <,> <#> The referee decides that 's a free in favour of Roscommon <#> Don Connellan leaves it to Nigel Dineen <#> Dineen may decide here to take it out of his hands <#> No he 's elected to <,> try again with the left foot <,> <#> Nigel Dineen of course who played for Connaught in the Railway Cup <,> very respected player <,> Dineen <,> usually noted for his free-taking but hasn't really been on form this afternoon <#> Stephen King has possession for Cavan he 's also won a free kick <#> He takes it quickly <,> <#> Philip Smith puts it down the middle <,> but not to any advantage for the Cavan men <#> There 's King again <#> Tower of strength for Cavan <,> Stephen King <,> and Deery 's <,> equal to that for Roscommon <#> Glen Mc <,> Glen McDonald <,> <#> And now <,> Don Connellan <,> and again Don Connellan 's fouled <#> He 's fouled by Gerry Sheridan <,> and Sheridan tends to use that option which shows a weakness in any corner back <,> giving away a free so easily <#> I 'm sure that will be noted by opposition not only in the National League but also in the Ulster Championship <#> So Nigel Dineen with the chance of the equalising score for Roscommon <#> As I mentioned a few moments ago <,> it 's exactly what Martin McHugh didn't want <,> the four point half time lead eaten away so quickly <#> But the sides are now level <#> Eight points each <,> one five to eight points <,> <#> This 'll be a test of the character of the Cavan side <,> the only side in the National League who came into today 's game with a one hundred percent record <,> Seamus Donoghue <,> that heavy tackle there from Vinnie Glennon <,> the free kick is for Cavan <#> It 's Seamus Donoghue <#> There 's Larry McCormick <,> battling with the breeze Larry McCormick <#> He gets it through to Adrian Lambe <#> Another free for the Cavan men <#> And Ronan Carolan will take this <#> You wouldn't expect it to really be within the shooting range so he takes the quick one and it's back to Carolan <,> and now it 's with Larry again <#> Larry McCormick <,> but it 's given away <#> And Roscommon could build from here <,> but first of all they 've got to get possession <#> And the Cavan men close the door on them <#> That 's a free-out for the blues <,> a free against James Hannigan <,> in favour of Aidan Connolly <#> Aidan takes the kick himself out towards John Brady <#> Most players getting more space now in the second half than they were allowed in the first <,> <#> Doing well John Brady <#> In danger of over-running <,> <#> Cavan now confident that they can build another attack from here <#> Adrian Lambe <,> can't find a way through <#> Looking for support <,> comes in the form of who other than Stephen King <#> And King 's fouled <#> The Roscommon fans don't agree with the Leitrim referee Seamus Friar <#> King leaves it to Carolan <#> Cavan would like another score now <,> particularly now <#> Cos they don't want to allow Roscommon to get in front <#> And as I mentioned before <,> Ronan <,> he 's facing a very stiff wind indeed <,> <#> Goes through the same routine <,> <#> But it 's a missed opportunity and the sides are still level at eight points to one goal and five for Cavan <#> Eight points Roscommon <,> one five for the visitors</I><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-002$B> <#> So Glentoran get this the second local Cup Final of the season underway <#> Crusaders ' last Final was of course last year when they beat Bangor in the Ulster Cup <#> John Hunter scored the winner then <#> And the Glens haven't been in a final for a couple of years <,> that was the County Antrim Shield and they lost to Carrick in a replay <#> Crusaders immediately on the offensive <,> and Armstrong has to come out and make a very good save <#> Martin Dale hasn't cleared it yet <,> but George Neill should now <,> <#> What a good opportunity immediately for the Crus <,> <#> There 's the referee for this evening <,> David Magill <,> <#> Hit by Dunlop <,> headed away by Parker <#> Parker with the headband knocking it forward <,> <#> That 's striker Duncan Campbell who replaces the ineligible Trevor Smith this evening <#> Campbell on loan from Smith 's old club <,> Hamilton Accies <,> <#> Another throw to Crusaders <,> <#> Stephen Stuart I think will take that <,> <#> Thirty-one years of age Stephen Stuart <,> in his ninth season at the club <#> George Neill 's header <,> <#> John Hunter gets a toe to that <#> Stephen Baxter has it now <,> <#> Baxter just trying to hold it up <#> And he still has it as well <,> turns <,> and a foul says the referee <,> <#> Indeed the referee doesn't give a foul there <,,> <#> Kirk Hunter 's header <,> <#> George Neill 's long throw to Justin McBride to chase <#> Cut out by Callaghan <#> Free kick though says the referee <#> Justin McBride wonders why <,> <#> Eleven goals in twelve games this season for Justin McBride <,> <#> Now that 's Robbie Lawlor at right back <#> He fronts it forward <#> Push in the back says the referee <#> Free kick taken quickly <#> George Neill 's in possession for the Glens <,> <#> Nice one touch stuff from them <#> Given away though <,> <#> Another throw for Stephen Stuart <,> <#> Thought about that quick one back to the keeper <#> Kirk Hunter who <,> Gary McCartney number seven <#> Nice turn by Hunter <,> <#> A back flick by Hunter <#> Baxter has it now for Crusaders <#> And he 'll be a handful this evening I 'm sure <#> Strong tackle by Darren Parker <,> <#> Darren Parker who apparently had flu and then suspected appendicitis <,> but as you can see <,> he 's perfectly alright now <,> gets on with the game for Crusaders <,> I 'm sure they 'll move all their big men forward for this one <,> <#> Sid Burrowes will take it <#> And there 's the view from our camera behind the goal <#> As you can see the big men have moved forward for Crusaders <#> Kirk Hunter 's in there <#> Good punch away <,> out as far as Murray <#> Hunter got a head to that <#> Here 's Burrowes <#> Still danger for Glentoran <,> <#> Oh lovely skill by Martin Dale <,> and away <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> by Campbell <#> Campbell races up this far touch line <#> Campbell <,> pretty adventurous shot <#> A good stop from the on-loan striker <,> <#> Well Glentoran 's first real chance of the game <#> He 's got a bit of pace has Campbell <#> He can strike it as well <#> That one was well off target <,,> <#> Well there 's the view that Neil Armstrong has the moment <#> He 's at the near post all on his own <#> Goal kick <#> Gary McCartney can't manage to control <,> <#> There is Gary McCartney <,> scored that superb winner of course in the Semi-finals against Linfield <,> <#> Header by Lawlor <#> Here 's Murray <#> Nice ball out to Stuart who 's free on this near side <#> Hunter 's touch doesn't reach him <,> <#> Could have been a good ball by Stephen Stuart <#> Robbie Lawlor just didn't move fast enough to get onto the end of it <,> <#> Michael Smith <,> takes a throw for the Glens <#> And that 's confused the defence <#> And here 's a super chance <#> He 's all on his own <#> And it 's in <#> Glentoran take the lead <#> And Duncan Campbell is the scorer <#> The Glentoran fans go wild <,> and rightly so <#> Well there was confusion in the Crusaders ' defence <#> And Duncan Campbell just scrambled through the defence and <unclear> 2 sylls <unclear> <#> What a start for the striker <,> <#> Glentoran manager Tommy Cassidy says that Duncan Campbell isn't here for five weeks <,> he 's not just on loan <#> He wants to have a future at the club <,> and he might well just have one after that</I>
