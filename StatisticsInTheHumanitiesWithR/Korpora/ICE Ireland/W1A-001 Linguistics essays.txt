<W1A-001 Linguistics essays><I><W1A-001$A><p> <#> This book outlines two uses of language. <#> It outlines how language can be used to achieve effective communication; this is contrasted with how language can be used to help maintain power and prestige in society. <#> The former is a description of how language is used; the latter is a catalogue of prescribed rules based on attitudes. </p><p> <#> Language development is part and parcel of a child 's socialization. <#> What a child learns instinctively is the basic rules described by linguistic analysis. <#> He may be introduced to notions of 'bad' language, but this will have only a superficial effect. <#> The need to communicate is infinitely more important, so he grasps the grammar and builds his vocabulary. </p><p> <#> Social distinction is based on such aspects as wealth and formal education. <#> Members of these classes can be recognized by the cues they signal, consciously or unconsciously, to others. <#> Language is the vehicle for this communication; it is not only what is said and how it is said, but what is not said. <#> For those who always use the standard English dialect there would be strict conformity to the grammar, vocabulary and accent associated with that dialect. <#> Grammatical constructions such as: 'I seen him' would be avoided. <#> Slang might be employed providing it supported the solidarity of that particular group. <#> Useless words which fill gaps in sentences would probably be similar to phrases like: 'in my view' rather than phrases like 'ye know'. <#> Other strategies might be avoiding features such as the 'double negative'. </p><p> <#> But if we look scientifically at linguistic behaviour, we see other dialects allow us to communiate just as effectively. <#> When the word 'youse' is used the basic rules are applied; there is reference to the plural form. <#> Slang and swearing are presented in sentences with correct grammar; 'Who gives a fuck?' <#> This phrase has no symbol function (little or no meaning) but is has symptom and signal function; the emotional state of the speaker is transferred to the listener. <#> So the rules are implicit; in any century there is diverse use of English, and the language is always changing. </p><p> <#> We must also remember that we use language differently in different social contexts. <#> Sociolinguistics gives us a complete model of language use; besides grammar and vocabulary, there is register and style. <#> In a formal situation we are more rigid in our application of grammar, more careful in our choice of words. <#> If we are performing as a member of a profession, we may use words which we regard as appropriate and significant. <#> This use of register may make them feel excluded by what they regard as jargon. <#> Style is a heading for the appropriate use of various forms of languge use. <#> A performer can move to and fro along a spectrum; at one end of this spectrum is highly formal, at the other end is highly informal. <#> So writing an essay and talking to a friend require different styles of language use. <#> We may feel someone is moving closer to us if they include more slang and swearing. <#> We can still use the dialect of standard English (spoken with the accent of another dialect) to swear or employ the language of an 'expert'. <#> So a strange sounding dialect, which uses slang and swearing, can communicate much more than a verbose speech which contains empty phrases such as 'Everything possible will be done'. </p><p> <#> Over the centuries the phonetic, semantic and grammatical aspects of language alter. <#> But there always has been an effort to establish what is correct. <#> Trudgill and Anderson describe studies which reveal the impact of geographical location and socio-economic variation. <#> Here we move back from description to prescription; the emphasis is on how language reflects the structure of society itself. <#> Linguistic variables such as saying 'ing' rather than 'in' at the end of a word are used to map out region and class. <#> The upper class is numbered 1; the lowest socio-economic class is numbered 4. <#> This is placed on the vertical axis. <#> Class 4 shows the largest variation of dialect. <#> Class 1 seeks to maintain standard English. <#> But members of all classes are sensitive to received pronunciation, and most increase their efforts to say 'ing' rather than 'in' at the end of a word. <#> But this 'correctness' is imposed by convention; it varies according to culture. <#> In the U.S. will include 'r' after a vowel, in the U.K. the 'r' is dropped. <#> So the highest socio-economic group in both countries have an opposing view of what is 'correct'. <#> But we must not confuse socially significant signals regarding class with the real proesses of language in everyday use. <#> These notions of 'correct' language use are arbitrary. <#> What matters is the successful communication of thought and feeling from one 's inner world out into a shared world. <#> The fact that some features such as accent is deemed to be 'correct', perhaps reminds us of the old saying: 'money talks'. </p><p> <#> I agree with the arguments presented by Anderson and Trudgill. <#> To view language use as correct only when standard English is observed is to be very narrow minded. <#> Attitudes based on class distinction restrict our response to others; feeling and thought can be expressed powerfully in any dialect. <#> Shakespeare used language that would certainly not be considered 'nice'. </p><p> <#> We will resist inevitable change in language if we put one dialect on a pedestal. <#> We will resist contact with those who introduce new forms of language use; this is foolish arrogance; there are two hundred million speakers of English in America alone. <#> The language can only become richer the more it is used. </p><p> <#> In schools a need to conform to a standard usage need not put aside respect for local dialect. <#> The local alterations of grammar or vocabulary are not mistakes; these alterations are legitimate. <#> Language does not belong to anyone. <#> Even the language of the drug culture soon changes from private slang to words in everyday use: 'fix', 'high'. <#> Words like <}> <-> 'gallavant' </-> <+> gallivant </+> </}> which belongs to Ulster slang add colour and comedy to conversation. <#> Those who look back to the rules of Latin, forget that it does not change because it is no longer used. <#> We should not waste our energies saying: 'It is I'. <#> We should use language to reach out, not hide behind verbosity. <#> To take ourselves too seriously and pompously assume we know best about language use, is to live in a shrinking world. </p></I><I><W1A-001$B><p> <#> The acquisition of language is an extremely long, complex process - one which most people go through and few can do without. </p><p> <#> Although the first real evidence of progress comes in the first year, when the child utters its first words, language development begins long before the child is able to speak. </p><h> <#> 0-8 weeks </h><p> <#> During this stage the child produces sounds which reflect discomfort or distress of some sort, such as crying ( <ul> reflexive </ul> noises). <#> Sucking, burping and other such sounds which are uttered because of bodily functioning are known as <ul> vegetative </ul> noises. <#> These sounds share some of the features found in later speech: vocal folds are used, an air stream mechanism produces the noise and there is rhymical vocalization. </p><h> <#> 8-20 weeks </h><p> <#> At this point the child has begun to laugh and coo. <#> Cooing sounds are strung together sometimes producing syllables very like those in proper speech. <#> During this time children learn to use the tongue and lips in co-ordination with the vocal folds and this is essential training for later speech. </p><h> <#> 25-50 weeks </h><p> <#> During the early weeks of this stage, a small set of sounds are used frequently and repetitively to produce sounds like 'ga-ga', known as <ul> reduplicative babbling. </ul> <#> This develops into <ul> variegated babbling, </ul> with shifts between consonants and vowels. <#> Rhythm and syllable length begin increasingly to resemble that of later speech. <#> These utterances have no meaning, although they may seem to, but they are essential of the child 's mastery of sounds necessary for speech production. </p><h> <#> 9-18 months </h><p> <#> Sounds produced by the child are more varied that they previously were and are known as <ul> melodic utterances. </ul> <#> Often parents can infer meaning from these utterances and there is at this stage no doubt that the <}> <-> childs </-> <+> child 's </+> </}> language skills are really developing. </p><p> <#> A perception of speech is necessary before the child can begin to speak itself, and it is surprising how highly developed this perception is. <#> Even new-born babies have impressive auditory abilities and by four weeks they can clearly distinguish between different sounds. <#> Babies also develop comprehension abilities extremely quickly, being able to respond to differing tones of voice from around 2 months, and understanding as many as 60 words by the end of their first year. <#> (H. Benedict, 1979) </p><p> <#> Another factor important in child language acquisition is the influence of <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> mother. <#> Mothers talk to their children from the moment they are born even though the child can obviously not yet speak. <#> As the transcripts in Appendix 2 show, mothers pick up on all their children 's utterances in an an attempt to make some kind of conversation. <#> This, importantly fosters in the child an awareness of what exactly a conversation is, and how to take part in one. </p><p> <#> We can break the development of language and communication skills into several areas: </p><h> <#> PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT </h><p> <#> Even around the age of one, when children are able to recognise certain words, they have difficulty in pronouncing those words themselves. <#> This ability develops gradually. <#> Consonants are more easily pronounced when they are at the beginning of words rather than at the end, and some are more easily pronounced than others. <#> For example, [p] [b] [k] [n] [f] [d] [g] [m] and [h] are common as beginning for words by the end of the second year but only [p] [b] [k] [n] and [f] are easily used as word endings. <#> Usually by the age of four, all vowels and diphthongs and almost all consonants can be pronounced correctly. <#> Often when children are unable to pronounce a word correctly, they reduplicate sounds which the are able to make, forming an approximation of the word. <#> 'Bottle' might become [bubu] and 'water' may be pronounced [wowa]. <#> It is likely that reduplication helps children learn to pronounce in stages and to express meaning by pronouncing the most prominent phones or 'sound units'. <#> Around 1, children begin learning the correct use of intonation, a process which is not finished even when the child is in <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> teens. <#> In the first year, intonation might be used to express such states as surprise, fear and greeting, and in following years more complex uses are learned. <#> Appendix 1(a) illustrates the anxious attempt of a child trying desperately to make himself understood through intonation, since he is unable to do so with his limited vocabulary. </p><h> <#> GRAMMATICAL DEVELOPMENT </h><p> <#> Between 12 and 18 months, children are usually able only to form one word utterances, although these can function almost as sentences. <#> Admittedly, some phrases are known, but the child will think of these as only one word and they should not be viewed as being proper sentences. <#> Single word utterances can function as sentences because of intonation and gesture - they have no real grammatical form. </p><p> <#> Around 18 months children begin to grasp morphological aspects of grammar such as word-endings. <#> This ability develops considerably over the next two years, but as Appendix 1 shows, even a four year old can have problems with tense and other morphologies. <#> Children begin to string two word sentences together at about 18 months, and although these are often ungrammatical, they can nevertheless convey a considerable amount of meaning. <#> Sentences comprising several words emerge around the age of three, the child begins to learn the complexities of grammatical structure and to form sentences contining more than one clause. <#> By four years, the child is surprisingly competent with grammar, and by ten, even most subtle grammatical rules have been mastered. <#> The two year old in Appendix 1(c) is unable to use the past tense, but the four year old in 1(d) is quite competent, although still prone to such mistakes as 'Father Christmas bring bringed us our toys'. <#> That these mistakes are made is not surprising: tenses do not always follow regular rules. </p><h> <#> SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT </h><p> <#> Young children learn vocabulary with amazing rapidity but the ability to actually pronounce vocabulary lags behind the ability to comprehend it. <#> By 18 months, most children understand around 250 words, but only have the capacity to say about 50 words. <#> Six months later, spoken vocabulary exceeds 200 words. <#> Once children reach the age of four, it become increasingly difficult to measure their vocabulary because of the incredibly rapid lexical expansion which takes place around the age of three. <#> Even when a child uses a word grammatically, it may not fully understand <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> meaning. <#> 'If', 'so', 'because', 'should', 'since' and other clauses cause a lot of problems. <#> Only at about six years to children gain the ability to comprehend those subtle aspects of language whose meaning is implicit rather than explicit. </p><h> <#> PRAGMATIC DEVELOPMENT </h><p> <#> As well as knowing how to speak, children must learn the conversational skills necessary for social interaction. <#> These abilities begin to develop at around two years of age, and by three children are starting to take into account their <}> <-> listeners </-> <+> listeners' </+> </}> needs for clarity and the chance to participate fully in a conversation. <#> They also become aware of appropriate responses <#> Between three and five, children learn to use polite language such as 'please' and 'thankyou', 'Mr' and 'Mrs'. <#> Their skills at initiating and sustaining conversations, as well as manipulating them, also expand. </p><p> <#> As this essay has shown, there is more to acquiring language than meets the eye (or ear), although we all take it for granted. <#> For most, the learning process develops naturally and rapidly. <#> Schools and observation of <}> <-> other's </-> <+> others ' </+> </}> language play a high part in learning, but no learning would take place were it not for the innate ability for form a lingual system of communication. <#> It is certain though that all would agree that child language acquisition is a fascinating phenomenon, and one which brings a great deal of enjoyment to all who observe it. </p></I>
