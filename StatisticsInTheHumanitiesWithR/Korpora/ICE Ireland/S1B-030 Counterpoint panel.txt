<ICE-IRE:S1B-030 Counterpoint Panel><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> Well joining us in the Counterpoint studio here in Belfast is the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford John Taylor <,> and from Belfast the Progressive Unionist David Ervine <#> In Dublin we have the security correspondent of the Irish Independent newspaper <#> That 's Tom Brady <#> And in London we have the SDLP 's justice spokesman <,> Seamus Mallon <#> Seamus Mallon how much fear uh do you assess in your community<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$B> <#> I think there 's great apprehension at the present moment of time <#> We have heard the uh the clips that you have broadcast already <#> I think that tells a little bit of the story because there 's so much that we hasn't been made public yet and uh that must be taken into account as well<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> What do you mean by what hasn't been made public<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$B> <#> I think the number of people who have had to move house as a result of direct threats on their lives has not got into the public domain yet <#> I know that from uh practical experience <#> I know that uh instances where that has happened <#> And I think when you add up this entire picture <,> what you see is an absolute threat to the Nationalist community for political reasons <#> And those political reasons you have uh enumerated some of them <,> are as spurious as they ever were <#> And what the what the Loyalist uh paramilitary groupings are saying is that those who don't agree with their peculiar warped twisted type of political uh agenda are legitimate targets <#> Members of our party uh eighteen of them <,> have been attacked in the recent months <,> very murderous attacks indeed <#> Other people have been uh uh victims of this in other ways which I will not specify at this moment of time <#> And that is showing very clearly that it is an attack on the entire Catholic community <#> And I agree totally with Father Dan White <,> when he says every time it looks as if the Nationalist community might get a little bit of place in the sun within the North of Ireland then this type of attack uh <.> ta </.> attacks start from within the Loyalists paramilitary groupings <#> Could I also say this <,> because we have heard the reasons <,> it it was supposed to be in reaction to IRA violence <#> I never believed that <#> I don't think anybody else ever did <#> It is very much uh a political type of terrorism <#> <{1> <[1> And that <,> that is increased </[1> <#> And could I make this point because it 's crucially important at this moment <#> That has been increased by the utterances of some Unionist politicians <#> And when you look at the words of John Taylor yesterday in the House of Commons about Irish people who are working in the Channel <.> Tunl </.> Tunnel and Irish firms uh uh who are uh involved there <#> That is sheer incitement to hatred <#> That is racism at its worst <#> <{2> <[2> And that is <,> that is the type <,> that is the type </[2> of incitement to hatred <{3> <[3> which leads these people to pick out </[3> their targets<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <[1> Let me ask you something </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <[2> How do you answer that John Taylor <,> okay <#> Point made </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> <[3> Well I can answer that very simply </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> Okay Seamus Mallon <#> Point made <#> <{> <[> How do you answer it John Taylor </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> <[> I can answer </[> </{> I can answer that very simply by saying that the Minister uh agreed with what I said and confirmed that indeed there would be proper vetting of all people involved in the sub-contracts that had been allocated <{1> <[1> to Southern Irish firms <#> And it is only right </[1> that there should be vetting and I 'm glad that the government have agreed to do that <#> <{2> <[2> Now </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$B> <#> <[1> I think you should apologise to the Irish people <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <[2> Are you uh </[2> </{2> prepared to apologise<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> Not in the least <#> <{> <[> It 's very important </[> that we do not have any risk to the public who use the Eurotunnel <#> We know that Irish people support the IRA <#> Luckily most Irish people are against the IRA <#> But there are no Greeks no French no Germans in the IRA <#> They 're all Irish <,> and therefore they are a risk<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$B> <#> <[> I think you should </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <{1> <[1> Well there are Greeks and Germans in other terrorist organisations but <#> Let no I I wanted to address </[1> another point that <{2> <[2> Seamus Mallon made </[2> <#> And it it is this that that the Loyalist terrorists are pursuing political aims <#> They 've got a political agenda <#> How long it is going to be before the Unionist politicians set the political agenda and tell the terrorists to leave it alone<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$B> <#> <[1> They 're pointing their guns guns and their words at specific targets </[1><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> <[1> Could I uh <,> come come back to this </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> <[2> Yeah <,> yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> Well of course the political agenda has been coloured by Republican terrorism for over twenty years now <#> Uh listening to this programme you would think that it is only Nationalist politicians who are being attacked but we remember that the republican terrorists killed Edgar Graham Sir Norman Strong James Strong Robert Bradford and almost myself <#> The Protestant community have been living in great fear from Republican terrorism for the last twenty-five years <#> And regrettably now and it 's quite right <,> the the it 's true uh it 's that the Catholic community are now suffering the same fear <#> And this is the kind of thing we 've got to get out of Ulster politics <#> You know <,> if you kill one Catholic today and one Protestant tomorrow it doesn't change the political situation in Northern Ireland <#> There will still be over six hundred thousand Catholics left in Northern Ireland and still around one million Protestants <#> <{> <[> And </[> those two groups have to learn to live with each other<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <[> David Ervine </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> David Ervine why why do you think Unionists <,> Loyalists seem to get it so wrong<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$D> <#> I 'm not sure I understand that we get it wrong <#> I think we 're a deeply misunderstood people <#> Seamus Mallon said something interesting when he said <,> when there is progress it looks like the Nationalists are going to have a little place in the sun within Northern Ireland <#> That 's a significant statement from Seamus <,> because hitherto Seamus has been telling the Unionist population for a very long time <,> one you do not have a legitimate political philosophy <,> that uh you come from <,> or this is uh a failed political entity <,> and that indeed uh challenges to our culture and challenges of to our way of life <#> Seamus Mallon has no difficulty with his Irishness <#> He has a problem with my Britishness<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> Well I 'm not sure that all those quotes are <,> are attributable to you Seamus Mallon <#> Are they<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$B> <#> <{1> <[1> I was very surprised to hear those </[> <#> I mean the reality of the situation is that I have been at pains for a number of weeks now if not months <,> to try and explain to people that the real essence of the the self-determination as defined in the Joint Declaration is that it is based on the consent of a majority of the people in the north of Ireland <#> And I think that 's something which is fundamental to the whole uh to <.> t </.> <.> who </.> to the whole approach <#> And that is something which the Unionist people should look at and understand and realise <,> that that has been given since nine eight nineteen eighty-six <,> in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration and given willingly by the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland <#> <{2> <[2> And the key </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$D> <#> <{1> <[1> They 're certainly attributable to the SDLP </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <[2> Do you have a </[2> </{2> problem with David Ervine 's Britishness<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$B> <#> I have no problem with it whatsoever <#> I have lived in the north of Ireland all my life <#> I will continue to live there <#> I have no problem whatsoever with the political views or the cultural views of any of the people that I live among <#> What I have a problem is with <.> i </.> <.> i </.> is and I I say it now <#> It is this <#> Where you have the type of division that we have <,> where you have loyal uh Loyalist paramilitaries doing what they 're doing <,> and where you have unionist politicians almost apologising for that <,> uh trying to explain it <,> giving the most <.> exspur </.> <,> most spurious of reasons <,> instead of standing up like men and leading their people <,> and leading their people on the basis of the the the of approach which was presented to them <,> for years <,> by the Nationalist community <,> by a community which has stood up against the IRA and everyone else who would try to impose their will on people uh by by force of arms <#> That is what the Unionist politicians should be doing <#> Instead of doing that they are skulking around the edges of paramilitarism <,> they 're making excuses for them and they are not giving leadership <#> And that is why the Unionist community at the present moment of time <,> I feel uh feel themselves disadvantaged <#> And looking <{> <[> and listening to Mr Taylor and </[> others I can understand why they feel disadvantaged<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$?> <#> <[> Right <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> Okay I 'll I 'll let you both in in just one moment but Tom Brady 's waiting patiently in Dublin <#> Now one of the things Loyalist <.> pa </.> paramilitaries or Loyalist terrorists <,> have done this year Tom is they 've gone across the border with the incendiary bomb <#> What 's the reaction there at the moment <#> What 's the fear about the fact that Loyalists seem to be perfecting the bomb better and better and next time it mightn't be an incendiary <,> it might be something much more powerful<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$E> <#> Well there is considerable concern at the sporadic campaign that the Loyalists have been carrying out here mainly through incendiary devices <#> And that concern was heightened last September when the RUC chief constable decided to go public with his warning that the Loyalists were perfecting their bombing capabilities and that there was a uh likelihood of massive bomb attacks in the south <#> But it has been very much a hit-and-miss campaign so far <#> And what there is more concern about among the <.> sesc </.> security forces is the possibility of uh close-quarter shooting <#> And as a result of that there has been uh increased protection for potential targets such as senior politicians and judges <#> It has also been a step-up in security at Leinster House where the Senate and the Da/il sits<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> So it 's being taken as a genuine threat<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$E> <#> Yes it is yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> Okay Tom I 'll I 'll hope to get back to you before the end of the programme <#> I apologise if I don't because the two gentlemen here in Belfast have a lot to answer <,> from Seamus Mallon and and the gist of it seems to be the weakness of the Unionist leadership<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> Oh of course that 's old Seamus all over again <#> Uhm <,> it it is an unfair criticism of Jim Molyneaux and the and the Ulster Unionist party <#> There uh from his leadership downwards there has been total rejection of violence at all occasions <,> and no explanation why violence is taking place or no apologies for violence taking place <#> We have always condemned Loyalist violence <{> <[> from the </[> leadership downwards<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> But there 's a difference between condemning it and trying to stop it <#> And whether you like it or not I think you 've got to admit that the what the SDLP have done through John Hume in their talks with Sinn Fe/in is to try and get the gun out of that side of the equation which would lead to the gun being taken out of politics <,> full stop<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> Well the SDLP have been at it for twenty-five years <#> They certainly haven't stopped the IRA killing <#> We 've had another example of their failure today <,> in the slaughter of that young policeman in the in South Belfast<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> But at least they 're trying to persuade Sinn Fe/in to persuade the IRA to stop<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$C> <#> Well John Hume was but <,> he said he was in secret talks but of course we 've never <.> n </.> heard what took place in those talks and nor have we seen the actual document which I think Seamus Mallon hasn't seen either <#> So we don't really know what we 're talking about <#> <{> <[> It 's hearsay </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-030$A> <#> <[> David Ervine </[> </{> <,> what about persuading Loyalists <,> so-called Loyalists <,> to drop the gun and the bomb<ICE-IRE:S1B-030$D> <#> It 's a great idea and it 's a great theory <#> I don't think it 's likely to happen until such times as the IRA <,> lay down their weapons <#> I might say that to Seamus Mallon if I could that the the arrogance of Nationalism <,> when John Hume and Gerry Adams and John Hume is challenged by Gerry at the polls or <,> the SDLP are challenged by Sinn Fe/in at the polls <,> I don't see that the Loyalist paramilitaries <,> uh or the Loyalist terrorists as you wish to call them uhm are being challenged or are challenging the uh official Unionist Party or the Democratic Unionist Party at the polls <#> Uh Nationalism has given greater credence to the terrorist on the Nationalist side than Loyalism ever has <#> And they are realities</I>
