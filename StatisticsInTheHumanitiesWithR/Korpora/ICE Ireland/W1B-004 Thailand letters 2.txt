<W1B-004 Thailand letters 2><I><W1B-004$A><h> <#> 18.4.97 </h><p> <#> Hi Lynne, <#> How 's things? <#> I got your letter about a month ago - <#> I 'm sorry I didn't write sooner but you know what am I like when it comes to writing letters. <#> Well, I 'm glad to hear that you are keeping well and having lots of fun with your new Thai friends. <#> I 'll be wanting your autograph next ha ha. <#> I 'm sure they think you are super star on the radio. <#> I hope you didn't mention the incident where a middle-aged woman stripped off her clothing in a "public bar" - <#> maybe that 's not such a big deal in Thailand. </p><p> <#> Well things are ticking away here nicely. <#> It 's only five months to the "big" day so I 'm trying to get organised as much as possible. <#> I have bought my dress and I 'm getting Terry 's made. </p><p> <#> Also Luke and I have bought a house in Crossgar - <#> <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> just past Crossgar High School and on the opposite side of road - <#> <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> called "53 Oakland Drive". <#> You may recognise <del> them </del> where it is if you look at the picture. <#> It is a 2 storied semi detached - <#> <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> really nice but the decor is awful but we can change that through time. <#> We only got it a few days ago so you can imagine the novelty hasn't <}> <-> woren </-> <+> worn </+> </}> off yet! <#> I have Luke tortured trying to get it cleaned. <#> I wish you were here to enjoy the crack. </p><p> <#> I 'm not sure whether Allanah told you but did you know that Ger and Mary Beth are coming to live in Ireland for good. <#> They told Luke and I at Christmas but we were not allowed to break the news until February past. <#> They came home for a few days in February because they had job interviews <#> They don't have definite jobs yet but I don't think they will have any problems as they are well educated and have a lot work experience. <#> They come home on 12 May and are staying in Ger 's mum 's house for a while. <#> They may well rent our house for a while until they get something of their own. <#> This will be good for us as it will help to pay our mortgage until we get married. <#> So I 'm afraid you 're going to miss a big house warming and welcome home party - <#> I 'll be thinking about you. </p><p> <#> I haven't seen Allanah in a while because we haven't been down at the Dufferin. <#> Since we knew our offer was accepted on the house we 've had to save quite a lot of money - so unfortunately we 've had to cut down on our socialising. <#> It 's a pity because we had some good crack down in the Dufferin. </p><p> <#> I have started the aerobics in the Dufferin - <#> <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> on twice a week and <}> <-> Bety </-> <+> Betty </+> </}> is really good - <#> you would enjoy it - although I haven't managed to persuade Allanah to go yet. <#> I can really notice my <}> <-> thys </-> <+> thighs </+> </}> and bum toning up although you have to work at it. <#> Do you do any form of exercise apart from drinking glasses of whiskey ha ha? </p><p> <#> So you haven't met anyone special yet! <#> I 'm sure you have had a few one night stands staying over night in that big house of yours or are you missing Fizz too much - <#> remember he did win the lottery! </p><p> <#> Oh by the way did you know that Margaret had a wee girl called Eithne the day after you left. <#> She is really beautiful and is the picture of Cormac. <#> Mairead 's baby is due on 5 June so that will be something else to look forward to. </p><p> <#> It 's pity you 're not going to be here when Ger and Mary Beth come home as I think it will be really good crack but I suppose it will be no time until you are home yourself for good. </p><p> <#> Well, I have to go now and get my stuff ready for work in the morning. <#> Luke, Mum, Dad, Terry <*> ampersand </*> Eamon all say hello and said you 've not to be too hard on those students of yours! </p><p> <#> Take care, <#> Write soon <#> Love Paula <#> XXXX <#> P.S I hope you enjoyed your holidays. </p></I><I><W1B-004$B><p> <#> Yo there Lynnie!! <#> How the fuck are ya girl!?! <#> Well I got your letter - <#> 'tis great!! <#> And I 've been speaking to Eileen who gave me your message that the job starts on May 1st! <#> EEEK!!! </p><p> <#> Well, when I got the letter I was jumping about all set to go - but since then I 've been in an utter muddle...and I still am. <#> And because I 'm in an utter muddle, I still haven't got it together to send my CV!!! <#> EEEK. <#> Promise I 'll do it this week. <#> I have to write one first!! </p><p> <#> Basically, I 'm in a muddle because I can't decide to go or not. <#> The reason for this <ul> is </ul> I really want to do the good tefl in July. <#> It 's expensive but I could go to Holland for May <*> ampersand </*> June to make some cash, keep paying rent on me room so I 'd have it to come back to in July so I 'd be in my own settled wee pad to study like fuck for 5 weeks. <#> I know this job doesn't entail doing a tefl - but I guess that 's the problem. <#> It all sounds great - especially being there with you - but I don't know where this job will get me. <#> My plan since I came home was to get a good decent qualification <*> ampersand </*> go and teach for a year <*> ampersand </*> hopefully then like you, <}> <-> Ester </-> <+> Esther </+> </}> , Ron, Sally-Anne <*> ampersand </*> so many of my friends I would finally know what the fuck I was doing. <#> I 've been feeling <}> <-> FREEKED </-> <+> freaked </+> </}> about myself, my life, my career for 2 years now - basically since I graduated. <#> Maybe I am too young to get so <}> <-> freeked </-> <+> freaked </+> </}> about it, but believe me when yer in my situation looking at all your friends, <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> like <quote> "Oh my God - where did I go wrong?" </quote> <#> The one thing I 've had playing in my mind that 's been constant through all my other ideas is Tefl. <#> I don't know if I 'll enjoy or even if I can do, but I think <*> ampersand </*> hope I will <*> ampersand </*> can. </p><p> <#> And this job isn't teaching. <#> And that 's the main reason why I 've reservations. <#> I guess I just don't know enough about what the actual job entails. <#> It sounds easy enough, the money is <(> fan-fucking-tastic </(> (<*> ampersand </*> I 've <ul> never </ul> had money so U you can imagine the temptation the job is to me) but my main fear is going over, finding myself in a job that sounds more like a glorified librarian than a teacher <*> ampersand </*> sitting for a year still thinking <quote> "where am I going" </quote> <*> ampersand </*> <quote> "what am I doing" </quote> etc. <#> If it was <ul> teaching </ul> in that school I 'd be over like a shot, but I 'm so scared of feeling I 'm not progressing in what I want to do - or <ul> think </ul> I want to do. </p><p> <#> I mean, if I went out to Khorat <*> ampersand </*> could teach for a year, I could come home with you and we could both live together <*> ampersand </*> do the masters at Coleraine <ul> OR </ul> I could do a PGCE in primary school teaching which would leave me able to have a skill and I could sub my way through my masters in 'Anthropology <&> ampersand </&> Film' in Manchester which I rather fancy in a couple of years. </p><p> <#> Do you know what I mean?? <#> I 'm gonna try to do the cheap, shitty tefl in case I come out in April to do the job if I get it - <#> leave no doors closed eh? <#> I wish I could have a seriously long chat with you as I need to know more about the job <*> ampersand </*> what it could lead to. </p><p> <}> <-> Annieway </-> <+> Anyway </+> </}> , I hope you know despite all this I 'm still considering it seriously - <#> in fact I haven't stopped thinking about it for 2 seconds since you phoned - <#> need some advice - QUICKLY!! </p><p> <#> I just don't know what 's the best thing to do. <#> I mean if I stay <*> ampersand </*> do the good RSA tefl in July, I would still come to Khorat in August for a year - no probs - if I could get a job. <#> You would know better than me what the chances of that are. <#> If maybe you could put my CV in a few places saying I have the RSA tefl AND all the rest of the stuff (I.V.S etc) <*> ampersand </*> I would be available from mid August or whatever, something might turn up. <#> I 'm gonna try to phone U tomorrow - but yer probably still away. </p><p> <#> What do you think?? <#> What 's the chances of me getting a job that good in August instead of May? <#> Could you put my CV about? <#> Do you know more about the job? <#> Could I get experience teaching? <#> What do you mean by <quote> "developing materials?" </quote> <#> How long is it for? <#> Do U think it could lead to other things ie good tefl jobs? <#> What should I do? <#> EEK - I need to make up my mind really really soon. </p><p> <#> Sorry this letter is such a big serious rant, but I really want to be sure I make the right decision. <#> I need the address of the school. <#> Will I fax my CV to your work? <#> Are the Thais really OK in Khorat? <#> My nasty little experiences with Thai men still play in my mind. <#> I try not to let it effect my thoughts of going. - <#> All that shit was on the islands - which as U say is another world. <#> <}> <-> Ester </-> <+> Esther </+> </}> will be home soon so I can talk to her. <#> Fuck, what a fuckin' amazin' opportunity <*> ampersand </*> I can't think of anyone I 'd rather be in Thailand <*> ampersand </*> hopefully travel with than you <*> ampersand </*> yet I 'm hesitating? <#> WHY? <#> Maybe I 've just got settled in a Belfast rut <*> ampersand </*> am too scared <ul> OR </ul> maybe I really need to do that tefl for myself <*> ampersand </*> my own confidence. <#> Can I do an RSA tefl anywhere in Khorat? <#> Maybe that would be the answer. <#> I know it 's possible to do it in Bangkok <ul> BUT </ul> time off work <*> ampersand </*> where would I live etc. </p><p> <#> OOh er missus - what a tizzy I 'm in!!!! </p><p> <#> I mean to say - what am I so scared <}> <-> off </-> <+> of </+> </}> ? <#> What am I fucking like? <#> <}> <-> Annieway </-> <+> Anyway </+> </}> me lovely, sorry again this letter is so crappy - <#> if you can PLEASE give me a phone. <#> I need your advice. <#> What would U do?? <#> I 'll get the CV over soon. <#> Maybe I should just wise up, take the bull by the horns <*> ampersand </*> get me arse over 4 some fun <*> ampersand </*> frolicks. <#> The job I 've been in for 9 months has done my head in, <*> ampersand </*> my confidence <*> ampersand </*> self-esteem as far as "work" goes has been seriously knocked. <#> It 's been O.K. though cause I 've loved living in this house <*> ampersand </*> I 've lots of good friends here etc so all has not been lost. <#> I 'm scared of feeling that crap in a job again - especially in a foreign country. <#> Where have my balls gone? <#> I promise I 'll be out in August if I can get a job if I don't come next month. <#> EEK!! </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Annieway </-> <+> Anyway </+> </}> , I hope you had a total ball in Vietnam <*> ampersand </*> if I come over (no - WHEN) U have to go diving again with me! <#> And we have to get a motorbike!!! <#> I hear Eileen <*> ampersand </*> maybe Fred as well will be out in the summer - <#> EXCELLENT!! <#> Any skank yet? <#> I split up with Jimmy for good last Saturday - <#> fuck him - <#> he 's frigid and has made me feel unsexy for a long time - <#> so it 's back on the <}> <-> single 's </-> <+> singles' </+> </}/ market 4 for me - <#> probably just as well really - <#> I don't need that shit!! <#> I just keep telling myself I 'm a sexy bitch <*> ampersand </*> he 's an immature frigid shit. <#> I may as well. <#> I 'll be damned if I let him make me feel shitty about myself. <#> Men!! <#> I really give up. <#> <}> <-> Janets </-> <+> Janet 's </+> </}> very happy with her woman!! <#> Maybe she 's got the right feckin' idea eh what! </p><p> <#> Well, I 'll love ya <*> ampersand </*> leave ya - <#> please please contact me soon with all the <.> info </.> you can. <#> I 'll hopefully see U in April <*> ampersand </*> if not in August!! </p><p> <#> Lots <*> ampersand </*> lots of sex, drugs <*> ampersand </*> <(> fanfeckintastic </(> vibes, <}> <-> wwwhiskey </-> <+> whiskey </+> </}> , stout, gin <&> ampersand </&> spicyness, <#> Paulette <#> XOXOXOX </p></I>
