<ICE-IRE:S1B-022 Belfast politics><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> The talks at Stormont <,> it looked as though the Ulster Unionists were going to go there with the UDP and the PUP and then this bomb <,> in Market Hill today <#> Now as I understand it <,> nobody 's claimed responsibility for this so far but David Trimble of the Ulster Unionists says <,> kick Sinn Fe/in out of the talks <#> Ulster Unionists here <,> Dermot Nesbit why if there isn't a claim <,> why if there isn't a claim would you say <,> kick Sinn Fe/in out of the talks <#> What 's the point<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$B> <#> Well the point is very simple <#> We wish to embark upon a process of discussion among constitutional parties to resolve the difficulty in Northern Ireland <#> But before you embark upon a consultative process and discussion we must agree the rules of discussion <#> And we have simply said for one Tony Blair said on Saturday morning that if the IRA or any of the front organisations associated with the IRA was to recommence violence then Sinn Fe/in would be out <#> The Taoiseach also said this week that he was expecting the whole as he I think he said the Republican Family to abide by the preace <&> peace </&> process <#> <{> <[> How </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> He used the </[> </{> phrase Republican Movement<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> And that was subsequently queried and there 's a lot of debate now as to whether Sinn Fe/in and the IRA are part of the Republican Movement<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> The terminology now is Republican Family<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$B> <#> Yes <{> <[> Republican Movement or </[> Republican Family<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> But the or </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> Yeah to get back to the main point <#> A bomb went off today <#> Nobody 's claimed it and you say kick Sinn Fe/in out <#> <{> <[> In </[> the sentence why<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$B> <#> <[> The </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$B> <#> The precise process is that we have lodged that Sinn Fe/in should be removed <#> The Chairman of the talks process will then ask the various parties for their opinion <#> The Government will then have to make up their mind <#> And I repeat what Tony Blair has said that if the IRA or any of the front organisation has carried out any act of violence and I think no one here doubts <,> that it is not someone from the Republic Movement <#> It was a very large bomb <#> The Chief Constable said it was done with great expertise and very <,> detailed planning <{> <[> so one </[> does not doubt that<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> Mm okay </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> Right we 'll come back to it <#> Gentleman beside you just two along <#> Yes sir<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$C> <#> Well <,> I come from outside Lisburn <#> The question I would like to ask if given the opportunity <.> wou </.> is <,> can our politicians handle the peace <,> or are we going to have to suffer their negativity <,> their play on semantics and their inability <,> to negotiate on a group to group basis<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> Yeah but what about the point that the Unionists make <,> and it 's also been made perhaps with greater force by the UK Unionist party the DUP you cannot go in and you cannot negotiate with people who are either terrorists or friends of terrorists<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$C> <#> But sure <{> <[> the <.> u </.> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> Do you </[> </{> not believe that<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$C> <#> Sure the Unionists have been doing this<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> How have they been doing it <#> <{> <[> Explain </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$C> <#> <[> Well they 've been </[> </{> doing it with the the the two small <,> uh fringe Loyalist parties <#> Uh the uh leader of their party <,> fraternised with persons in Portadown of of uhm <,> dubious<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> I think the word you 're looking for is hypocrisy <&> laughter </&> <#> Is that the <{> <[> word you 're looking </[> for <#> Right one second Mo <#> Uh this gentleman here is that yes sir<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$C> <#> <[> Yes yes </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$D> <#> Andy Frew Green Party <#> I think we should recognise that there 's fragmentation on the Loyalist side and on the Republican side <#> But the question I would like to have answered is can the unionists agree to share power with Catholics and Nationalists or <,> will they have the British impose a solution with in consultation with the <{> <[> Irish government </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> You think that 's a </[> </{> possibility<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$D> <#> I think we have to look to an end-game here instead of shilly-shallying about with with these issues <#> We shouldn't leave a veto in this process to the last five eejits with some explosives<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> Alright <#> This lady<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$E> <#> I don't think that I 'm from the Ulster Unionist Party as well David that shilly-shallying about is what we would see as happening today <#> Today was a very serious day for us <#> We were trying to look at this process in a in a in a positive manner <#> And I think for people to say that we 've been negative about this process is just wrong because we have been criticised for being positive about this process <#> And we have to take David is uh David Trimble is taking this slowly and I think he has every right to take it slowly given what we have suffered this past thirty years<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> But you see the gentleman over here wants to know how come the Unionists can do business <,> with the Loyalists<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$E> <#> Well for a start-off the Loyalists have now had a three-year cease fire and I know you 're now <{> <[> going to say </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> With with </[> </{> yes <#> I 'm going to tell you there has been the odd very serious blip<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$E> <#> There has indeed but <.> the </.> can I say that they have signed up to the Mitchell principles and there 's been no shilly-shallying about that <#> And can I also say that they had abject remorse for what they have done over the past years something which the IRA Sinn Fe/in movement have not been able to do<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> Yeah I I I don't know uhm I 'm going to come to this gentleman over here because I I 'm not sure now <#> I talked to David Ervine and Gary McMichael today in Talkback <#> I 'm not sure I know <,> what was affirmed on behalf of whom <,> because David Ervine said to me today I think he used the term there there was an assumption <,> that the UVF were signing up to those <#> I 'm not sure <,> I got clarification to the point that I could say to you oh yes they did <#> What were you going to say sir<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> Well David I was just going to say uhm it 's a pity that such an ambitious programme is starting by looking back <#> Now it 's a long way to May <#> There 're going to be <{> <[> obstacles <#> There 're going to be obstacles </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> No I don't I don't </[> </{> <.> understa </.> <#> Now <{1> <[1> come </[1> on sir <{2> <[2> you </[2> cannot say that <#> We had the opening of talks at Stormont <#> There is a big bomb in Market <{3> <[3> Hill </[3> today and if you think we can walk away and leave that well I 'm <{4> <[4> sorry </[4> you 've got the wrong guy<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> <[1> Sir </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> <[2> No </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> <[3> Right </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> <[4> No </[4> </{4><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> I no I the point I 'm making is we have a commitment to a timetable which leads us to <.> M </.> to May <#> There 're going to be many people try to derail the peace process and the democratic process and is this will test the commitment of everybody politicians and community people alike <#> And we really have got to steel ourselves for being put under pressure from all directions<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> And you say that despite what happened today that all the parties should get in there and talk<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> In spite of it<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> In spite of <{> <[> it </[> <#> Okay yes sir<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$F> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$G> <#> I 'm just I 'm very disappointed in the Unionists ' response <#> It 's something we 've been listening to from day one of the peace process <#> They seem <,> unwilling to to engage with other people <#> And and I I have wondered why they 're so frightened of peace because that 's the objective of the talks <{> <[> to arrive at peace </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> What view would you what general </[> </{> <,> view would you hold <#> Where would your support be<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$G> <#> I 'd be a Republican <{> <[> sympathiser </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> You 'd be </[> </{> Republican<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$G> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> A Republican sympathiser <#> So what are you saying that that that the Unionists are just simply trying to shy away from talking to <.> Repub </.> <#> It 's as simple as that<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$G> <#> I think it 's more than that <#> I think they fear that for the fifty years that they had complete control of this state <,> when they abused power and that 's it 's historical fact <#> It 's no longer a debating point<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$E> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$G> <#> But well you can come back in on that later <#> Let me make the point <#> They abused the power they had for fifty years <#> They now seem to have this oh if if anybody else is in control what 'll happen to us <#> I don't want that happening <#> I 'd want an equality <#> I think that should happen before negotiations that all people should have the same rights <#> And that 's something this state still has to deal with <{> <[> the question </[> of equality<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> Yeah it 's something </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> It it 's uhm I mean we 'll may get into it in a moment or two and I I I don't uh because Arlene I think you want to come back briefly to answer that <#> But you we could get into a sticky area about consent <,> and what people understand by consent <#> And there are about three different versions of that <#> Yes you uh briefly Arlene<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$E> <#> I just wanted to say that again we 're being attacked for being negative but it it 's our party that is putting forward the adoption of the European Convention on Human Rights into this country <#> And I just want to make that point clear to everybody<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> Okay would you would you hold on <#> I 'll come back to you on this side because I am deserting the good people who are over on this side <#> And I 'm just going to talk to a couple of ladies here and I 'll be up with you in a second or two <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$H> <#> Okay I 'm Brenda Callaghan from the Northern Ireland Women 's Coalition <#> And while today was obviously very disappointing and I think a lot of people have been hurt by what happened in Market Hill I think the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are keen to see some sort of political process and progress <#> And therefore the only way to do that is actually to get in and let 's start talking <#> And I think that 's the message that 's coming across from everywhere <#> People are urging the Unionist Family to take some risks for progress and to actually get in there <#> It 's not good enough to be hanging around their headquarters saying should we or shouldn't we <#> They have a responsibility to the people they represent to get in there and make their voice heard in the way all the other parties who have an electoral mandate whether they like it or don't have a right to have their voices heard as well<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> Okay let 's have a view from the reverend gentleman there from Newtownabbey <#> Yes sir what<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$I> <#> The speaker two before who referred to himself as a Republican sympathiser is he prepared <.> co </.> to condemn the bomb in Market Hill <#> We 've heard no condemnation <,> from the Sinn Fe/in Republican movement of that bomb uh in in Market Hill taking <{> <[> place </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{> what is your position on the bomb in Market Hill<ICE-IRE:S1B-022$G> <#> If I thought it would stop it I would certainly condemn it <#> Does that answer <{1> <[1> you <#> We 've had twenty-seven years of condemnation and it has achieved </[1> absolutely nothing <#> If my condemnation could stop the <{2> <[2> whole thing <,> I could do it <#> I 'm not speaking of Sinn Fe/in </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$I> <#> <[1> But why don't you condemn it now <#> <.> C </.> Why <,> why do you condemn </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$I> <#> <[2> But Sinn Fe/in have got to show <,> Sinn Fe/in have got to show that they </[2> </{2> are now in favour of peace <{1> <[1> <#> And </[1> they 've got to show the same condemnation of any acts of violence from whatever quarter they come from and <{2> <[2> I 'd I 'm </[2> happy to see them in the talks <#> <{3> <[3> I 'm happy to </[3><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$I> <#> <[1> But but </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$I> <#> <[2> It 's </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-022$G> <#> <[3> But condemnation </[3> </{3> didn't change anything</I>
