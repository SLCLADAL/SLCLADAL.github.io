<W1B-014 Aran Islands><I><W1B>-014$A><h> <#> Friday </h><p> <#> Hi Muriel, <#> How are you faring with the pigs? <#> Thanks a million for your letter - I got it when I came back from Inis M&/or on Wednesday. <#> I 'm sorry that I didn't send any postcards but I couldn't see any post box on the island. <#> I went there with Neasa from work - the girl who wanted to go to the IRMA awards, remember? <#> Oh Muriel, she is <}> <-> definetly </-> <+> definitely </+> </}> not on my wavelength. <#> Maeve was supposed to go with me but because she didn't have a job she couldn't so Neasa said she 'd come. <#> She 's very quiet <*> agus sign </*> after a while I just had nothing to say to her; I mean I couldn't think of anything at all. <#> We got the bus to Galway <*> agus sign </*> then we got a bus to Inverin in Connemara where the airport is <*> agus sign </*> we flew out in a plane that holds 10 people including the pilot <*> agus sign </*> is very confined! <#> It only takes around 10 minutes to fly but if it 's very windy the flight is very very bumpy. <#> There we got a bus to Kilronan <*> agus sign </*> went to our B <*> agus sign </*> B - Bay View (how original!) <#> It was lovely, right on the sea with The American Bar of Waterboys fame just around the corner. <#> We got the whole package for <*> pound sign </*> 60 (1 night 's B <*> agus sign </*> B, so we had like 24 hours on the island). <#> The first night (Tuesday), we went for a walk around <*> agus sign </*> looked at the craft shops - they have no tacky crap at all, thank God. <#> Then the heavens opened <*> agus sign </*> we were practically drowned (no exaggeration - it was pouring!) <*> agus sign </*> of course the only other clothes I had brought was my pyjamas <*> agus sign </*> a pair of shorts! <#> So I spent the rest of the night going round in green checky shorts <*> agus sign </*> a flowery tee shirt from my pyjamas! <#> As least I didn't meet anyone who knew me! <#> We went to the fast food place for something to eat - it was nice at the time but I felt sick after around an hour. <#> We then proceeded to the American Bar where we drank <}> <-> Guiness </-> <+> Guinness </+> </}> (me bottles <*> agus sign </*> Neasa pints) from 1/2 8 until quarter to one. <#> It was too wet to go walking anywhere so we stayed put. <#> I really enjoyed the pub because we met lots of people. <#> The place was crawling with tourists - nearly all of them tanned European couples that would make you sick with envy <*> agus sign </*> yearning! <#> The natives are kind of reserved or something <*> agus sign </*> I felt a bit like an intruder but if you spoke Irish to them they were slightly more friendly because then at least they knew you were Irish. </p><p> <#> The first person we met in the pub was this guy from Mayo who was a fisherman (he was around 30, I think <*> agus sign </*> told us that he had been a sparring partner for Barry McGuigan <*> agus sign </*> how his mother had died when he was 16. <#> He was kind of merry so you wouldn't know whether to believe his or not. <#> He looked a bit like Des from Glenroe. <#> We met him again the next day <*> agus sign </*> he was still in the pub, god help us! <#> Then we met this family from Longford who were staying in The Mainistir Hostel on the road up to D&/un Aengus. <#> It had gotten a great review in the Sunday Independent by this man <*> agus sign </*> his wife who have published books about good places to eat <*> agus sign </*> stay around Ireland but these people thought that it was so bad that they left the next morning on the ferry at 10.30 <*> agus sign </*> they didn't have to pay for their <}> <-> accomodation </-> <+> accommodation </+> </}> or anything. <#> Then we met Nigel <*> agus sign </*> Tom (or it could have been Todd, I 'm not too sure) <*> agus sign </*> they were working on some building that was going on at the time. <#> They were really nice guys. <#> Nigel was 22 <*> agus sign </*> had been going out with his girlfriend for 12 years (can you imagine?) but he wasn't in love with her. <#> They grew up together <*> agus sign </*> it seemed to be expected that they go out with each other - pathetic isn't it? <#> Then Todd or Tom told us how he had been going out with a girl for 9 months <*> agus sign </*> when he came back from being away working, she was going out with his best friend. <#> They thought anyway that we 'd find the right person without any problem <*> agus sign </*> that they 'd be flattered if a girl asked them out (?) <*> agus sign </*> that it was just as hard for a guy to ask a girl out as vice versa. <#> They walked back to the B <*> agus sign </*> B with us (even though it was just around the corner) and were just really nice. </p><p> <#> Then the next day was beautiful <*> agus sign </*> sunny with an incredible wind from the sea - it was so clean. <#> The night before I opened the window going to bed <*> agus sign </*> you could hear the tide coming in which was wonderful. <#> We rented bikes <*> agus sign </*> the plan was we 'd cycle up to D&/un Aengus 8 km away. <#> It 's uphill all the way <*> agus sign </*> we were 3/4 of the way there when Neasa decided she wanted to go back so I said that that was fine, but that I was going to keep going so she said she 'd come <*> agus sign </*> we hadn't gone on for 10 minutes when it started to drizzle <*> agus sign </*> we turned back <*> agus sign </*> came back into Kilronan. <#> After lunch I said I was going to go up there on one of the buses so we headed off again. <#> We met Tom Mullane <*> agus sign </*> his pony Polly <*> agus sign </*> his trap with reflectors on the back of it. <#> Oh Muriel he was so cute you 'd just run away with him! <#> We had to walk around 20 minutes up to Dun Aengus which is around 300 ft above sea level. <#> It was built by the Fir Bolg, I think <*> agus sign </*> is basically at the edge of the world. <#> It was so beautiful up there that it just defies description. <#> I took loads of photos up there so I 'll have them when you come down. <#> On our way back down to the bus, I was (as my mother would say!) looking one way <*> agus sign </*> going the other when I fell. <#> It 's really rocky there <*> agus sign </*> I think I must have broken my leg (only joking!) <#> Seriously though, I think I bruised the bone because it swelled around the place where it got cut <*> agus sign </*> there 's a huge bruise that 's really sore. <#> But I don't care because it was worth it. <#> There are 850 people living there, 6 pubs, 3 national schools <*> agus sign </*> 1 technical school. <#> I 'm definitely going back but the next time I 'll stay for at least a week. <#> I 'd love to live there but I suppose that 's out of the question in terms of a job etc - bloody typical. </p><p> <#> I saw the Fisher King again on Sunday, it 's so good isn't it? <#> We got Hamlet last night but only watched half of it because we got it at around 10 o'clock <*> agus sign </*> it 's kind of difficult to watch if you are tired. <#> Yesterday I went out to the art gallery in Blennerville; Maeve got a few hours there for 2 weeks, in the mornings <*> agus sign </*> she 's working afternoons for the festival. <#> I bought a gorgeous red scarf/shawl there <*> agus sign </*> I think my mother thought I 'd lost the head altogether because I looked like Caitl&/in N&/i; Houlihan going around with my long pleated grey skirt, white cotton top and red shawl. </p><p> <#> I 'm going up to Spiddal on the 21st I think - it 's today week anyway. <#> I 'm going to see Fionnuala Murphy. <#> I 'm going Friday and coming home Sunday. <#> She 's working in Col&/aiste U&/i Chadhaill <*> agus sign </*> has weekends off so I said I 'd go up. <#> You 'd never know, I might bump into Glen Dunne, I think he lives in Spiddal now. <#> I can't wait to go up <*> agus sign </*> hopefully it 'll be good craic. </p><p> <#> Are you coming down so, the week of the festival? <#> Please do Muriel because Ali 's going away on the 25th <*> agus sign </*> you can have her room <*> agus sign </*> we 'll have the place to ourselves for a day or two anyway. <#> There is nothing on for the festival only a c&/eil&/i in the square <*> agus sign </*> I think there 's a classical music thing on too but I 'll find out about that. <#> Would you like to go to Dingle for a day? <#> The bus is <*> pound sign </*> 4 return I think <*> agus sign </*> we could go to see Fungi an all. <#> Let me know next letter ok? </p><> <#> I know what you mean about Bryan Ferry. <#> He 's such a change from those pigs <*> agus sign </*> that cook needs a good kick up the rear end. <#> What kind of things does she make? <#> I hate that kind of shit; it 's so superficial, isn't it? <#> As for Dr. Tony - is that an honorary doctorate? <#> He 'd hardly have the brains to work for one, would he? </p><p> <#> I hope Pat Dunphy gets on ok in Dublin <*> agus sign </*> that she doesn't strangle Catherine - she sounds like a frightful wanker altogether. <#> That dinner ye had sounds divine. <#> Your plans for the /s/ /&^s/ are great altogether - it must be difficult for him to do it though, you know, focusing on something that must be embarrassing for him but it 's hard for you too if he 's accusing you of picking holes. <#> Anyway, I think it 's great experience for you. <#> I 've just thought - what are you going to do for your clinic? <#> And have you any idea when the term starts in October? <#> I hope it 's not until the 12th - that would be great because I could take a week off work before going back. <#> I 'm looking forward to going back but not to study - the same story as last year! </p><p> <#> Muckross is gorgeous isn't it? <#> Did you see the <}> <-> the </-> </}> enormous dining table there? <#> I just love it but I hate that room with all the stuffed animals - talk about gross. <#> The scenery around Killarney is amazing isn't it? <#> I hope the day was clear because you 'd see nothing with the fog. <#> Kenmare is lovely isn't it? <#> The church is in a lovely place <*> agus sign </*> there 's a gorgeous celtic high cross there <*> agus sign </*> lovely craft shops. <#> Where did ye eat? <#> We went to the Coachman 's Inn, I think, on our way back from Bantry. <#> What did you have to eat. <#> I had a letter from Aoife yesterday - she seemed in good enough form. <#> I must ask her what happened about the job in the shop from last year. </p><p> <#> The Little green riding hood - the T-shirt was the one that you were giving to the Vincent de Paul remember? <#> it 's green with kind of wine <*> agus sign </*> dark mustardy pattern, short sleeves <*> agus sign </*> a plain green hoodie thing.. <#> <*> agus sign </*> Aoife kept a white one with a collar <*> agus sign </*> an orange one. <#> Oh the poem - I just love it - it 's by D.H. Lawrence. <#> As for the tooth, well at the moment it 's firmly in place <*> agus sign </*> hopefully it 'll stay that way. </p><p> <#> I just remembered that last week on day when we were going up to the warehouse in the van <*> agus sign </*> I nearly fainted. <#> I got such a fright <*> agus sign </*> it took a good few minutes before I could breathe properly. <#> The bitch would not let me sit on her lap so myself Kate <*> agus sign </*> Benedict asked Se&/an, the production manager who is brain dead by the way! to give us a lift up in his car. <#> It took nearly an hour <*> agus sign </*> a half for me to recover; my hands were shaking, my legs were like jelly <*> agus sign </*> I thought I 'd throw up. <#> Everybody except that beached whale asked me was I alright. <#> Talk about ignorant! <#> Benedict was so nice to me, God he 's lovely <*> agus sign </*> when we were going home in the evening he made a big fuss trying to squash in next to her <*> agus sign </*> suggested that he sit in her lap - it was priceless! </p><p> <#> I 'm sorry that I wasn't there when you rang, but thank you for calling - I hope my mother didn't keep you talking all night! <#> As for putting on 1/2 a stone - Muriel don't worry about it - my mother <*> agus sign </*> Ali are forever telling me that I have an enormous appetite <*> agus sign </*> that they can't get over how much I eat - they 'll give me a complex about it at the rate they 're going. <#> We threw away our weighing scales <*> agus sign </*> didn't bother to get a new one so I 'm trying to convince myself that I haven't put on any weight but when I 'm working, I go for coffee <*> agus sign </*> a bar or 2 of chocolate at my break (everyday!) which is a very bad idea. <#> I 'll have to control myself! </p><p> <#> Oh yes, Fionnuala B 's birthday is on September 17 - what will we do? <#> I haven't written to her at all yet, I 'd better drop her a line I suppose! <#> I still have to write to Aoife <*> agus sign </*> Audrey so I 'd better go now or I 'll be at this all day! <#> How did Pat Keating get on at the hospital - is she ok? <#> Tell her I said "hi" <*> agus sign </*> give her a hug from me. </p><p> <#> Let me know when you 're coming - I 'm dying to see you.<#> Loads of love <*> agus sign </*> hugs <*> agus sign </*> kisses, <#> Sarah Jane xxxxxxxxxxxx </p></I>
