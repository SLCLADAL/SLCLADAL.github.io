<ICE-IRE:S1B-057 Government 1><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Thank-you <{> <[> Deputy </[> <#> Can we 've Mary Harney<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$B> <#> <[> And we 're equally anxious <unclear> several sylls </unclear> with the Taoiseach </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$C> <#> Ceann Comhairle I must say I find the whole thing bizarre quite honestly <#> The Taoiseach is telling us that one official can't be contacted until twenty-five past six and that somebody else is on their holidays <#> If that is the case we 're not going to have all the facts <,> and it seems to me the Taoiseach is only making these enquiries because of Deputy Kenny 's questions<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$X> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$C> <#> No not just because of that <#> Could I just ask if the Ta/naiste could please throw some light on what 's going on because it 's really quite confusing<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$X> <#> Stalling tactic<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$D> <#> I have made <,> I have made it clear in the House that there was very very serious uh charges made here in the House and I was asked to investigate them fully <#> I was also requested not to start this debate until I was in a position to give all the facts as I could find them out <#> That I am prepared to do <#> I offered this morning to have this debate start uh with the Minister for Finance and that I would indeed place before the House the full facts <,> unvarnished facts that 's what you 'll get <,> everything I have <#> It was a very serious allegation by Deputy Rabbitte <#> I was entitled to and indeed I 'm sure he he would want me to and members of the House wanted me as well <,> to go into it in depth <,> and that 's what I 'm doing <#> It is not my fault that uh one of the members of the staff is on his way from Macedonia and we know he 'll be touching down at six twenty-five in Frankfurt <,> so I 'm not a bit <,> I 'm not idle as you might suggest all afternoon <#> I 'm down to two at this stage and if I <,> if the House can help me to accelerate them <,> I 'm only to happy to<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Can we 've Pat Rabbitte<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$E> <#> Uh Ceann Comhairle uh <,> I wonder could we clarify firstly <,> could we clarify firstly the point made by uh Deputy Kenny <,> that after the Taoiseach makes his opening statement that the House would adjourn for an hour to give the Opposition an opportunity to assimilate that statement <#> Uhm secondly <,> can I clarify on the matter that Deputy Bruton raised that it related to the <,> statement made yesterday in the House by the Taoiseach when he said that he was assured that there was no outside interference <,> in the matter of the warrants for Brendan Smyth <#> And the question related to whether or not there was indeed outside interference or representations <#> And finally may I ask the Taoiseach if he accepts <,> that it is the former Attorney General and the Taoiseach who have to answer questions in this House <,> not Deputy Kenny and I<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$F> <#> Well <,> it 's very difficult to know where the Democratic Left is coming from <#> I have Deputy de Rossa stand up and say that it 's useless to start this debate uh without the full facts <#> I have Deputy Rabbitte sitting right beside him getting up and saying <,> after the Taoiseach makes his opening uh statement this evening can we have a <&Irish> sos </&Irish> <#> So if you could sort out between yourselves what you really want I will try and facilitate you <#> I will try and facilitate you <#> In relation <,> in relation to questions in this House I stand over my statement yesterday in relation to the the the questions raised by Deputy Kenny and yourself about outside influence or outside contacts <,> contacting either me <,> the <.> Attor </.> or the Attorney General or the person that handled the file <,> I was asked to widen it <,> into the whole areas of if files existed or if a letter was on a file and all that particular area and as I say it has progressed to the stage I 've already progressed <#> We were quite happy to start this debate this morning if the House so wished in relation to Deputy Ahern and that I will come into the House with the full facts as I have assembled them whenever you 're ready <#> So whichever you <,> whichever this House wants me to do I 'm open to do it<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$X> <#> It 's a stalling tactic<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$F> <#> It 's not a stalling tactic <#> If the House makes up their mind we can start the debate now and I 'll come into it later on this evening or if you want me to go with the information available to me I will go in an hour 's time when the House wants to readjourn <#> But I would suggest that the best thing you could do is let the Whips get on with their business and sort it out<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> <[> Deputy John Bruton <#> I will call <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Deputy Bruton<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$G> <#> Well I I <#> The reason the debate didn't start this morning was that the person who should have opened it <,> namely the Taoiseach <,> was unwilling or unable to do so <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> Unable to open it <#> And unable for his own <,> out of his own failure to open it at the appropriate time <#> Now at this stage we have a situation where six ministers apparently are not attending Cabinet meetings <#> We don't have a government <#> We don't have a government I understand at this time and I think it 's important <,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> I think it 's important <,> I think it 's important that this matter be cleared up quickly<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$X> <#> Do you want to say something Dick<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Deputy Shatter has an offering<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$F> <#> There was no <#> I want just in response to Deputy Bruton <,> it 's not a question of being unable or unwilling <,> there was no Cabinet meeting today<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Deputy Alan Shatter<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$H> <#> Sir I I think it 's only fitting after the last question that I follow up and ask the Taoiseach a very <,> a very fundamental question that the entire country is looking into this House and wondering about <#> And I think it 's time sir that both you and the Tanaiste got off the fence and told this House <,> is the partnership government still in being or is part of the partnership semi-detached and heading off to the country <#> I think we 're entitled to know that and we 're entitled to bring the farce that 's being enacted out in this House to an end at this stage <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Uhm may I <,> may I express the hope that when we <,> when we do adjourn that we shall be in a position to proceed with the business of the House today and I would advise the House to take sufficient time as will ensure that that is so <#> How much time do we want<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$E> <#> Ceann Comhairle it 's my understanding that one hour will be sufficient<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Uhm perhaps a final question from Deputy de Rossa<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$?> <#> I didn't hear the statement Ceann Comhairle<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> One hour Deputy is suggested <{> <[> of </[> a recess<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$X> <#> <[> From now </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Uhm that the House do <,> does reconvene in an hour 's time<&> break in recording while sitting is suspended </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$G> <#> I rose here <,> about an hour ago and uh I haven't since uh found any further evidence of <,> in response to the queries raised here <#> Uh I suppose like other places I too am getting getting phonecalls and saying would you check this and check that and I suppose that 's only to be expected in those set of circumstances <#> But if any member of the House has any genuine information <,> and I don't mean wild allegations <,> because Deputy Rabbitte did say that what he was speaking about would rock the foundations of this State <#> That 's a very very serious statement to make <#> And I think it 's incumbent on all of us to produce any evidence we have and as I say again <,> I will not shirk my responsibility in trying to find out information for this House and for the general public<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$X> <unclear> several words </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$G> <#> I made a statement in this House yesterday regarding the circumstances of the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan to the presidency of the High Court <#> I also referred yesterday to my total commitment to public accountability and on that basis I make this further statement to the House <,> <#> Not down yet<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$?> <#> He 'll be here in a few minutes<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Please now<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$C> <#> I just want to ask the Taoiseach is he going to start<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$F> <#> We 'll have a script for you in a few minutes<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$?> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-057$A> <#> Let 's let 's have an orderly debate now <#> Members will have an opportunity of intervening at the appropriate time<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$C> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> really ask the Taoiseach if he would tell us is he going to circulate a speech<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$G> <#> Of course yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$C> <#> Thank-you<ICE-IRE:S1B-057$G> <#> Of course <#> I 'm sorry it 's not down here <#> I explained fully the circumstances of the case and I answered all questions fully and honestly on the basis of information then available to me <#> In nominating the former Attorney General to this high judicial office I was honouring the precedents which had been established by successive governments since the foundation of this state <#> In honouring this commitment <,> I was dealing with Mr Harry Whelehan on the same basis as I had dealt with people all my life <,> in business and in politics <#> That is <,> my word is my bond <#> Having made that commitment on the basis of long-standing precedents I felt duty bound to honour it <#> The decision was made by the government on the assumption that the legal <.> vice </.> <,> the legal advice from the then chief law officer of the State was the full detailed information available both in law and in fact <,> and was based on the fullest enquiries being made as I had initially directed <#> When I appointed the new Attorney General Mr Fitzsimons <,> the Minister for Justice on my behalf <,> requested him to conduct a full and detailed investigation of the file in the Smyth case and to report back <#> The investigation carried out has produced the information that the Smyth case was not the first which fell to be considered under these provisions of the nineteen eighty-seven Act <#> At all times and in his report to the Government of last week the former Attorney General stated that the Smyth case was the first to be applied under the same provisions <#> This was given as one of the reasons for the delay in processing the case <#> The investigation of the new Attorney General Mr Fitzsimons has shown that in a nineteen ninety-two extradition case <,> namely Duggan <,> executed by the former Attorney General Mr Whelehan <,> the section fifty provisions were considered <#> At all times my colleagues and I in government were told by Mr Whelehan <,> in whom we placed our total trust <,> that the Smyth case was the first in which those provisions of the nineteen eighty-seven act had to be addressed for the first time <#> I would have expected that the most senior legal officer of the State would have known of the Duggan case of nineteen ninety-two <,> considering that he himself cleared the warrants for endorsement by the Garda Commissioner and would have made this information known to me and the Government <#> This information was not made known to me and the Government by the former Attorney General <#> Had my colleagues and I been aware of these facts last week we would not have proposed or supported the nomination of Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> I <#> If you want facts and truth <,> that 's what you 're getting <#> I 'm informed that the former Attorney General had forgotten about the Duggan case when he prepared and approved the report sent to me <#> I am informed that the official in the Attorney General 's office who was involved in the preparation of that report was similarly not conscious of the existence of the case when the report was prepared <#> In fact the official who had dealt with the Duggan case did not remember it when requested to assist in the Attorney General 's investigation <#> This file was turned up <,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> This file was turned up <,> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> This file was turned up by another official who in the course of the investigation was putting together details of other extradition cases <#> However I would also have to say that in my view the report was seriously misleading to the House</I>
