<ICE-IRE:S1B-056 Attorney General><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-056$A> <#> As regards to the rush to the Park uh Taoiseach <,> uhm can I ask you at what stage did you discover that the Labour ministers were absenting themselves <#> Uh did you proceed to the Park to put Mr Whelehan beyond accountability to this House in the belief that the Labour ministers had merely dropped out to hear the latest from the count centre in Cork <,> <#> Secondly can I ask you Taoiseach <,> if you were satisfied that the Minister for Justice was unaware of the existence of these warrants <,> is it not the case that matters of far less serious import than a child abuser at loose in this jurisdiction would have been drawn to the personal attention of the Minister for Justice and that in this case this information was brought to her desk <#> And finally Taoiseach can I ask you to answer the question that the people uh of Ireland want to know <,> which is why you would put your government at risk and your own reputation and future as Taoiseach for the purposes of making Mr Whelehan President of the High Court <#> And can I ask you if you can recall with me the intervention of the then Attorney General to direct his Senior Counsel to intervene when you were being questioned on the motivation for your decisions as Minister for Industry and Commerce before the Beef Tribunal and that as a result of his intervention the <.> Cabine </.> the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality was given rise to which had the effect of saving your political neck <,> and that the reason <,> that the reason that you have appointed Mr Harry Whelehan President of the High Court is to repay that debt despite his lamentable performance <&> unclear simultaneous speech from members </&> despite his lamentable performance<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> He should be very careful about such innuendo <#> Such innuendo should not be <,> should not happen in this House <#> An Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$C> <#> I have no <,> I 've no intention of raising to the bait of such outrageous allegations being made in this House <,> outrageous<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$A> <#> There 's nothing outrageous about it <&> unclear

<#> I know who 's threatening to look into the backgrounds of Deputy McDowell<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> Deputy Rabbitte <,> would Deputy Rabbitte wish to monopolise the remaining seven minutes <,> <#> <&Irish> An </&Irish> Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$C> <#> I 've no intention as I say as to <.> ri </.> to rising <&> Muffled speech of Deputies in background </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> <&Irish> An </&Irish> Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$C> <#> To rising to that bait <#> Determination in all those facts was carried out by one Justice Liam Hamilton and I 'll leave his report intact <#> Uh in relation to this uh colourful mad rush to the Park if <,> Deputy Rabbitte and I I I I don't know you must have been out because otherwise I explained in detail to Deputy Mitchell who raised that particular problem or raised that particular aspect of this case <#> I have said and I <,> repeat that uh there was no mad rush to the Park as you would suggest in relation to it <,> that uh the the Secretary of the Government was asked after the Cabinet meeting to make the appropriate uh arrangements for it uh as I say other uhm diaries of of commitments already given had to be taken into consideration and I 'm sure the deputy will appreciate that <,> that uh Saturday was not suitable uh for <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> reasons <,> Saturday was not suitable <#> There was no mad rush to the Park <#> The the Government 's Secretary made the appropriate arrangements and we had to comply and indeed make availability <,> make our availability indeed to dovetail with somebody else 's in <.> rela </.> in relation to their particulars <#> I want to <&> unclear simultaneous speech </&> <#> I want to put it on the record that at no time <,> and I want to say this <.> equiv </.> unequivocally at no time did I discuss whatever Deputy Rabbitte is trying to infer here I don't know <,> in relation to somehow uh the former Attorney General involving himself some way or another which I know nothing about and if if Deputy Rabbitte wants to substantiate that I 'll be glad to have it investigated for him<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> Deputy Bobby Molloy <&> unclear simultaneous speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-056$C> <#> Sorry <#> <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle <#> I have part of an answer <#> I still have another part of an answer in relation to Deputy Rabbitte and that is the <.> ques </.> the whole question again of the role of the Department of Justice <#> The impression created by today 's media reporting of the role of the Department of Justice in the Smyth extradition case is misleading in that it proceeds on the false assumption that the Department of Justice was in possession of certain essential information <#> The factual position does not say so <#> As is normal practice in extradition cases <,> a copy of the warrants in the Smyth case was sent <&> unclear simultaneous speech </&> <#> If I <,> If I <,> If I am asked here <,> I 'm not

<&> unclear simultaneous speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> Too many interruptions from either side of the House please<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$C> <#> However <,> however the <.> infor </.> however the

know I put a statement on the record <#> If <,> if Deputy <,> if Deputy <,> if Deputy Rabbitte wants the information read out that 's his prerogative <#> If he wants to ask supplementary questions arising out of the information that 's still his <,> is his prerogative <#> I am not going to read the rest <#> If Deputy Rabbitte is happy with what I 've given him I 'll leave out the other two pages<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> Deputy Robert Molloy <,> <#> I call Deputy Molloy if he wishes to uh put a question<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$D> <#> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Can I ask uh some questions of the Taoiseach please just three points <#> First of all uh in the Taoiseach 's opinion is the Attorney General responsible for maladministration in his office <#> That 's one question <#> Uhm in view of the fact that uh for <.> sev </.> some months prior to the President of the High Court being appointed the Taoiseach was well aware uh of the strong opposition of uh his colleagues in the partnership government Labour Party <#> Why then did he persist in proceeding uhm with that appointment <#> And also finally could he tell the House uh how he could possibly come to the conclusion that the Labour Party were merely absenting themselves from the Government meeting merely to uhm register their non-participation uh in the decision uh to appoint Harry Whelehan uh as the Attorney General uh when they obviously remained out for the remainder uh of that uh Government meeting <#> Uh <.> exp </.> the explanation given Taoiseach in your statement to the House so far is not plausible that you could possibly have come to that decision<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> <&Irish> An </&Irish> Taoiseach<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$C> <#> Well the indeed uh the explanation as to what went wrong in the system is it may <,> it 's not plausible it 's not acceptable and I agree with Deputy Molloy in that regard <#> Uh as uh the question of responsibility I dealt with that very clearly I dealt with responsibility I dealt with accountability and I dealt with culpability <#> Here today in my statement <,> here today in relation to many questions as well <#> The <.> respons </.> responsibility I quoted W T Cosgrave and somebody questioned questioned that here <&> unclear simultaneous speech </&> responsibility <,> the responsibility<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$F> <#> <unclear> several words

that<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$B> <#> Three minutes and I want to accommodate the final Deputy<ICE-IRE:S1B-056$C> <#> The <.> respons </.> the responsibility <,> if people if people don't accept what was there and I accept what Deputy McDowell said but the Constitution hasn't been changed in that regard from an earlier supplementary that he asked <,> uh the responsibility clearly lies with the government as a whole in relation to what W T Cosgrave has said <,> that the President of the Executive Council nineteen twenty-four stated given the necessity to have someone to answer for the Attorney General in this House where he was not a member and I quote <,> <quote> in this arrangement the Executive Council has the general responsibility and must be prepared to answer for the

that it is time to look <,> and it 's in everybody 's interest in this House <,> it is time to look at the nineteen twenty-four Ministers and Secretaries Act again <#> Not alone <,> not alone from a government 's point of view but <,> but indeed in relation to Secretaries of Departments who are finding themselves in invidious positions regarding decisions taken down the line <#> I think this is an issue that this Da/il could indeed address and address itself quite profitably in that regard because if my colleague sitting beside me <,> if my colleague sitting beside me Deputy Bertie Ahern has a hundred <,> as Minister for the Public Service has a hundred and eighty-seven odd thousand uh employees under his direction <,> as <,> is this House seriously suggesting that any single member of a

<quote> in my opinion it follows that I personally and the Government as a whole must take some responsibility for the deficiencies in the <.> op </.> in the operation of extradition procedures in the

him in relation to page twenty of his speech <,> in which he says <,> my view of good government is that it must be decisive <,> is he contrasting this with the Labour Party 's insistence on accountability as indecision and isn't he isn't he in effect getting in his retaliation first so to speak <#> And finally may I ask the Taoiseach <,> why is it that none of the seventeen or so
