<W2D-014 Bowling matters><I><W2D-014$A><h> <#> Corky 's Column </h><h> <#> Irish international and tv-commentator, David Corkill, has joined Today 's Bowler to pass on his many experiences and give his views on the game and how he sees it developing. </h><h> <#> SCOTLAND WITHOUT! </h><p> <#> The Home International Series took place in my home town of Belfast with arguably the best team (they were after all the holders) not involved. </p><p> <#> Last month former Scottish international Gary Hood gave his views on the decision of his country to pull out of the event and many others have also passed comment. </p><p> <#> I personally believe that it was a decision taken in haste. </p><p> <#> The reason given was that the financial contribution by Scotland was too high, maybe so. <#> The figure of 35p levied on all bowlers is on top of the <*> pound sign </*> 10,000 each country pays towards the Championship/Series. <#> Scotland 's contribution was therefore <*> pound sign </*> 33,000 which on the face of it, accepting that England pay a lot more, is substantial. </p><p> <#> The issue for me though is not the cost of money terms it is more about the repercussions for the bowlers of Scotland. </p><p> <#> The losers in the withdrawal were definitely the bowlers. </p><p> <#> Players in the outdoor game compete in many different competitions but for most it is the National Championships that are of the greatest importance. </p><p> <#> This is for two reasons. </p><p> <#> Firstly, to enable an uncapped player to come to the attention of the national selectors, thus giving them a chance to be selected for the trials (or equivalent) and subsequently for the national team and secondly, to compete in the British Isles Championships. </p><p> <#> The decision to pull out of the BIBC Championships in Belfast has made both these objectives obsolete. <#> Unless Scotland decide to go back into the fray next year at Worthing, then the Scottish trials or their equivalent, will be unnecessary. </p><p> <#> Most competitive bowlers harbour an ambition to represent their country. <#> The Scots are renowned for being fiercely patriotic, which is a definite strength, but they are also one of the best bowling nations in the world. <#> The ordinary punters trying to break into that level of bowls can, for the time being, pack their bags. <#> Without a full international team, where can they go if they aspire to wear the coveted international blazer? </p><p> <#> This will also impact on the teams selected for Commonwealth Games and World Championships. </p><p> <#> Of course, a small squad of players have been selected and representatives are to be chosen from the chosen few. <#> How <}> <-> eletist </-> <+> elitist </+> </}> is that option when you have no way to prove your worth at international level? </p><p> <#> The current Scottish National title-holders who were due to come to Belfast will now not get the chance and according to all reports were not asked their opinions before they were forced to withdraw. </p><p> <#> The issue surrounding the players who qualified for the British Isles Championships is, I believe, a different case in some respects to the international team-members. </p><p> <#> They are not subject to the vagaries of selection as they have earned their right to compete by winning the respective national championships. <#> That gave them the right to come to Belfast. </p><p> <#> Could they have done so without the backing of the Scottish Bowling Association (SBA)? </p><p> <#> Not being a lawyer, I have no idea but are we straying into the area of legal argument? <#> Could the BIBC give them permission to compete? <#> The answer appears to have been NO. <#> But is this a legally correct decision? <#> I 'm not sure as to the constitution of the BIBC but I hope someone has read it very carefully and taken legal advice before issuing the decision. </p><p> <#> High Court action relating to bowls is not uncommon. <#> You only have to look back at the fiasco the Irish Bowls Association were involved in when they challenged a player 's right to use coloured bowls in the early stages of a national competition. </p><p> <#> I have been asked about aggression shown on the green - was it intimidation or natural <}> <-> exhuberance </-> <+> exuberance </+> </}>? <#> I replied that I felt so long as no code-of-conduct on player 's behaviour or the unwritten rules of sportsmanship were broken it was a behaviour pattern to be encouraged. <#> Noise will never replace skill but there is no harm in unsettling opponents and lifting your own side. </p><p> <#> Next month I 'll give an update on the more interesting points of the International Series. </p></I><I><W2D-014$B><h> The Umpire - BRYAN DALY </h><p> <#> A Bowls magazine wouldn't be complete without a column on umpiring. <#> This is where I make my entrance. </p><p> <#> At the recent World Indoor Bowls Council championships in Belfast where I was performing as Chief Umpire I had a lengthy conversation with Mr John Graham, editor of Bowls 2Day. <#> I enjoy reading and in particular anything to do with Bowls and sport in general. <#> After some bargaining I eventually bought one of his magazines, and before you say any more, Yes, I still had to pay the full price. <#> Still it was worth a try. </p><p> <#> I thoroughly enjoyed reading this bright new publication. <#> I am glad to see that it covers all bowls in the province and definitely adds the touch of having that local interest. <#> It certainly has something for everyone. </p><p> <#> The championships held in Belfast in April certainly had a different look about it. <#> We incorporated some of the features introduced by the World Bowls Tour in Blackpool last year and Potters this year. <#> Such changes as, No dead ends, best of 2 sets (7 ends / 9 ends), 3m T and match tiebreaks certainly caught everyone 's attention. </p><p> <#> Overall the event went extremely well attracting some of the best bowlers in the world. <#> Having this attraction the large crowds were very well entertained. <#> It was certainly a learning experience for most people coping with the rule changes. <#> It put a lot of pressure on the umpires who were interested in not only keeping themselves right but also the players. <#> I would like to take this opportunity in congratulating the Umpires for all their help before and during the event. <#> Every single one of them are true professionals of their sport and should be proud of the fantastic work they did for me. </p><p> <#> As already mentioned we had some very exciting matches and thankfully most went off trouble free. <#> The only major problem I had was during one of the ladies singles round robin matches. <#> One player was leading by 5 shots after 6 ends of a 7 end set. <#> The player leading wanted to play the last end. <#> On questioning the lady I ascertained that although she was leading and could not <}> <-> loose </-> <+> lose </+> </{> the set she wanted to play the last end to try and increase her score (bearing in mind that in the round robin stages shots scored could decide who would qualify for the quarter finals if the match wins were equal). <#> I accepted she had an argument but the rules clearly states that the set or match is over when at any stage it becomes impossible for your opponent to win. <#> She accepted this and the game continued. </p><p> <#> While I am on the rules of the game, I would take this opportunity in asking you to send your questions, queries and suggestions to me via 'Bowls 2 Day' and I will do my best to consider and answer your points. <#> I would like to kick this off by asking you to send me your views on what the outcome would be in the problems faced in the last issue with Cyril 's bowls in 'The Archers'. </p><p> <#> I will also share with you in the next issues, my experiences and views on, Local, National, International and World Bowls in Short mat, Indoor and Outdoor. </p><p> <#> So GET WRITING NOW! </p></I><I><W2D-014$C><h> <#> BE BOWLED OVER BY DENNIS </h><p> <#> For anyone

BOWLS THEM OVER IN NORTHERN IRELAND </h><p> <#> Dennis, the manufacturers of mowing and grounds care machinery, have appointed the Cyril Johnston company of Carryduff as its latest dealer for Northern Ireland. </p><p> <#> Cyril Johnston have extensive showroom facilities, and their team of dedicated sales executives promote, advise on and demonstrate a wide range of turf care equipment to their large client portfolio in both private and public sectors. <#> They have selected the Dennis line-up, which includes trailed gang mowers, pedestrian mowers and modular turf care systems, to fill a specific niche, between domestic equipment on one hand, and large high work-rate machinery on the other, such as that used by golf courses and local authorities. </p><p> <#> "Dennis equipment is absolutely ideal for grounds men at smaller sports clubs, and particularly for use on bowling greens," says the company 's David Johnston. <#> "Interest in bowls is currently very strong in Northern Ireland, and clubs are keen to promote the highest standards of turf quality. <#> With purpose-built Dennis machinery, they can achieve perfect greens." </p><p> <#> The Dennis line-up includes the versatile FT range, which can be fitted with numerous 'cassettes' for a host of maintenance tasks including mowing, scarifying, brushing, verti-cutting and sweeping. <#> The company 's pedestrian and towed mowers are renowned for their quality of finish, and Dennis can also supply powered barrows, anti-theft systems for turf products, and a range of hand tools. </p></I><I><W2D-014$D><h> <#>
