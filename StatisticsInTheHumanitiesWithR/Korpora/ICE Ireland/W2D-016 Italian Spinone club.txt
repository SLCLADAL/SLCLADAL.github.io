Hawthorne in April '93. </p><p> <#> Until the three litters born in '94 (see review of '94) there have only been two matings that introduced new bloodlines into our stock in this country. <#> The first mating was Drackett Anika ex Colourbox Hell Oh producing the first litter to the Colheath kennel in April '93. <#> The second mating was Mr. J. Hawthorne 's Drackett Armedia exNantiderri Fit the Bill which was imported by Mr. John Wallace, producing a litter also in April '93. </p><p> <#> In the past nine years there have only been eight litters bred in Ireland so it would be fair to say that the breed is still in its infancy here. <#> It is therefore up to us to ensure we maintain all the finer qualities of the breed as we head into the next decade. <#> We should be proud that over 80 <*> percent sign </*> of Italian Spinoni in Ireland are working gundogs and therefore truly fulfil the Dual Purpose qualities of the breed. <#> HEATHER TIMMINS (Colheath) </p></I><I><W2D-016$B><h> <#> REVIEW OF THE YEAR 'S EVENTS DURING 1994 </h><p> <#> On February 20th '94 the inaugural meeting of the Italian Spinone Club of Ireland took place. <#> The aims of the Club are to provide information, support and encourage comradeship for Spinone owners or those who hold an interest in the Breed. <#> In October of '94 the Club became officially affiliated to the Irish Kennel Club Ltd. </p><p> <#> It really proved to be an excellent year for the Breed in Ireland. <#> We were really pleased to welcome several new exhibitors from England and Scotland, we would like to congratulate one of those exhibitors in particular on her achievements. <#> Mrs. Laurie Craig whose dog Wynsett Steady Under Fire at Baillieston was the top winning Spinone here for 1994 and achieved the title Annual Champion '94 under I.K.C. Rules. </p><p> <#> Mrs. Marie Fox from Cornwall also achieved top honours when her dog Colheath Noble Fir won Best of Breed at the first official Club Show. <#> 'Flint' was also pulled in the final line up for Gundog Puppy at St. Patrick 's Day last year. </p><p> <#> However, the highlight of the year for me personally came in June when my bitch Drackett Athena bred by Mr. Finn Cuthbert became the first IR. SHOW CHAMPION SPINONE and truly earned her place in any history of the Breed here. </p><p> <#> We also look forward to seeing a new generation of Spinoni in the field and show ring this year following the birth of three litters in 1994. <#> The first in September to Mr. Peter Brannigan 's Beanie 's Belle ex Drackett Alban, the second in October to my own Sh. Ch. Drackett Athena ex An. Ch. Wynsett Steady Under Fire at Baillieaton and finally to mark a perfect end to the year a Christmas litter to Joyce Ruigrok <*> ampersand </*> Dan Delaney 's Inostricani Rossa ex their Drackett Alban. </p><p> <#> It must also be noted that this year perhaps more than any other there has been an incredible interest in the working abilities of the Spinone and full credit must be given to those owners who rough shoot with their dogs and promote the Breed through that <}> <-> closness </-> <+> closeness </+> </}> between handler and dog this does more to promote the abilities of the Spinone than any written word.</p><#> <p> HEATHER TIMMINS (Colheath) </p></I><I><W2D-016$C><h> <bold> INSIGHT INTO TRAINING THE ITALIAN SPINONE </h> </bold><p> <#> Dear Members, <#> Well I have been scratching my head since being asked to write about the training of the Spinone, trying to find areas which would interest non-working owners. </p><p> <#> Firstly I will outline very briefly my involvement with gundogs. <#> I started over 14 years ago training Springers having reasonable success in tests, then due to a change in my shooting I moved to Labs, once again having success in tests. <#> I still run both breeds both for myself and handling dogs on occasions for other people <#> I have trained dogs for friends and to date, not had any comebacks as to their performances. <#> I moved to Spinones because I felt other breeds were being overbred and spoiled for monetary gains. </p><p> <#> I have <}> <+> at </+> </}> long last found a breed which is being cared for in the correct manner. <#> It would be a shame to see this breed go the same way through lack of careful and select matings. <#> We must all insist that hip scoring and eye checks are carried out to ensure we all maintain a happy and healthy breed. <#> I am so impressed by the Spins nature and work, I don't require to look elsewhere for a good companion and worker. </p><p> <#> Now that I have bored the pants off all of you, please allow me to give some hard earned advice to future trainers and handlers. </p><h> <#> TRAINING TIPS </h><p> <#> 1. Do not start serious training until your pup is at least 6 months plus. <#> (Take your time don't rush, remember it 's better to take your time and have a well trained dog which is going to last 10 years, than a monster, which is a pain in the bum for the rest of <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> natural life. </p><p> <#> 2. Do not allow your pup to retrieve sticks and stones, this very often causes hard mouth. <#> Also don't play tug of war, you will only regret it, especially when your clever Spin brings in <}> <-> it's </-> <+> its </+> </}> first retrieve - you can't get much meat off a pair of pheasant wings whichever way you cook them. </p><p> <#> 3. Do not enforce walking to heel as this will only make if difficult when you expect your dog to leave your side to start hunting. </p><p> <#> 4. <}> <-> Don </-> <+> Do </+> </}> not try and force your pup to quarter for too long, this is a sure way of turning him into a plodder. </p><p> <#> 5. Do not take your pup to ground which has large amounts of rabbit scent, or you'll turn it into a hoover. <#> Remember these <}> <-> air </-> <+> are </+> </}> scenting dogs. </p><p> <#> 6. Just because Spins are gundogs it doesn't mean they enjoy having a gun fired over their heads. <#> This is something which takes time and patience. </p><p> <#> 7. POINTING is something which very often happens over-night. <#> Very careful monitoring of your pup as he starts to give any indication of pointing, needs to be encouraged once it starts. <#> This generally begins with slight pointing, once your <}> <-> pups </-> <+> pup </+> </}> stops and stands still, quietly walk up alongside him. <#> Do not approach along the line of the pups behind, this will often spook him, always approach from the flank, this way you won't upset the pup. <#> When you 're alongside softly repeat the command 'HOLD', at the same time gently stroke the <}> <-> pups </-> <+> pup 's </+> </}> stomach, this has a soothing <}> <-> affect </-> <+> effect. </+> </}> <#> When the pup is contented carefully raise his tail if not already done, bear in mind, the tail should only be in line with its back. <#> After a short length of time flush the object being pointed by any means available to you. <#> A word of warning do not try for the world record in pointing, as you will only encourage faults such as shaking, tail twitching or even worse moving in before being told to do so. </p><p> <#> WATERWORK should be done at the <}> <-> pups </-> <+> pup 's </+> </}> pace. <#> Never get frustrated enough to throw a young dog into the deep end expecting it to swim like a fish, all you will do is scare the dog for life. </p><p> <#> I hope this hasn't been too boring for you all, as you can imagine there is a lot more to gundog training than meets the eye. <#> It 's not as horrendous a picture as I may have painted it. <#> There 's always a bright side to it, and nothing is more embarrassing than when at the end of a hard <}> <-> days </-> <+> day 's </+> </}> trailing the judge asks your dog to make a <}> <-> reasonable </-> <+> reasonably </+> </}> difficult water retrieve, your faithful hound looks up at you and blatantly yawns before <}> <-> sawntering </-> <+> sauntering </+> </}> down to the water leisurely swims out and back makes his delivery looks at the judge and yawns again. <#> Who could ask for more? </p><p> <#> So come on folks have a 'go'! <#> STEVE KIMBERLEY </p></I><I><W2D-016$D><h> <ul> <#> Preparing an Italian Spinone </ul> </h><p> <#> How to start the task of preparing your Spinone. <#> First of all start with a clean dog. <#> Yes, he can have a bath! <#> This should be done a week before the show. <#> Beard and legs can be rinsed the night before <#> For hand stripping your dog the best tool and the cheapest of course, is finger and thumb, a good stripping comb and thinning scissors. <#> NEVER USE STRAIGHT SCISSORS </p><h> <#> THE HEAD: </h> <p> <#> Start with the head. <#> The skull and occiput should be short and smooth. <#> Gently strip towards the back skull and from the outer corner of the eyes to the beginning of the cheek. <#> The eyebrow should be combed through, then gently strip out any over hanging brow. <#> I have never found it necessary to trim the beard. <#> If you use a fine comb regularly this keeps it in trim. <#> However, this can be kept tidy with thinning scissors. <#> EARS must also be kept tidy. <#> They are set on level with the eyes, triangular in shape, slightly rounded at the tip, hanging no more than two inches at the jaw line. <#> You can have a surplus of two inches or more hanging from the ears - this needs to come off. </p><h> <ul> <#> THE NECK: </ul> </h> <p> <#> The Spinone is known for growing a lion 's ruff around the neck and shoulders. <#> If this is not stripped out this can give the impression of no neck at all. <#> Hand strip down the neck and shoulders. <#> The dewlap should also be clean and tidy. <#> Continue down from the shoulderblades and onto the back towards the tail. </p><h> <#> THE TAIL: </h> <p> <#> The tail should be carried out or down. <#> If your Spinone carries his tail high the last thing <}> <+> you </+> </}> want to see is a flag hanging from it. </p><h> <#> LEGS: </h> <p> <#> Forelegs should be straight, bone oval, strong well defined tendons. <#> Elbows neither turning in or out, pasterns slightly sloping when viewed from the side. <#> If your Spinone has got all this why cover it with excess hair and fringing? <#> The Standard says the coat should be shorter on the front of the limbs and on the feet. <#> The same goes for the hindquarters. <#> Particular attention should be made to keeping the elbows and hocks tidy, also the stifle. <#> The Standard does not ask for exaggeration on this point, so again long fringing should not be left on. <#> This includes the underline which should not be fringed excessively. <#> Finally feet - front compact and round, hindfeet slightly oval, toes arched, covered with short hair especially between the toes. <#> Nails strong and arched. <#> If you find this area difficult to strip out it can be done with thinning scissors. </p><p> <#> The preparation of your Spinone should not be done in haste. <#> Do a little at a time so he does not get bored and you don't make the mistake of taking off too much. <#> The end result will be worth it. <#> By LINDA COLLINS (WYNSETT) </p></I>
