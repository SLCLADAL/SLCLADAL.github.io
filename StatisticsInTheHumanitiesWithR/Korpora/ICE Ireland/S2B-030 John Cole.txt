<ICE-IRE:S2B-030 John Cole><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-030$A> <#> The first time I ever remember coming to Portrush I must have been probably about seven in nineteen thirty-five or thereabouts <#> And it really was a magical experience <#> We came as a family the four of us my father and mother and elder brother and myself <&> music </&> <#> When we approached Portrush in my father 's old Fiat car <,> my brother and I on the back seat used to compete with each other as to who could see the sea first <,> and then we would come over the crest of a hill and there spread out before us would be the Atlantic with the sun sparkling on it <#> The sun always seemed to shine when I was young <#> I think everybody finds it never seemed to rain when they were children <#> Portrush for me is about memory <,> a sort of a recollection of happiness and youth <&> conversation with waiter </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-030$A> <#> In the thirties we stayed in a boarding house in Kerr Street run by a lady called Mrs Grossie <#> It was what in these more grandiloquent days you would call a private hotel <#> My mother regarded my brother and myself as rather picky or fussy eaters <#> She had a terrible trouble getting us to eat what she thought we ought to eat <#> So uh <,> in the apartment set-up she bought the food <,> bought what we liked <,> what she could make us eat in effect <,> and the landlady cooked it <#> I I think I was quite a shy boy in those days at least so people tell me <#> So whatever brashness I may have developed is a later fruit I suppose of the hard world of journalism <&> music </&> <#> I came here first I suppose when I was about <,> five or six or so and this was called in those pre-sexism days the ladies ' bathing place <#> That 's what it called it in the old postcards but it wasn't only ladies it was uh children as well and also non-swimming men like my father <#> But the climate up here is <,> very nice today but shall we say fitful <,> and it could be very cold <#> So after my brother and I came out from a bathe here and <.> flor </.> frolicking around in the waves <,> my mother would sort of get on our jerseys and send us out to the longer beach across this way and say Now go go for a good long run and get yourselves warmed up again and I 'll have hot chocolate ready for you when you come back <#> And that was the sort of incentive to go in for a bathe because we were sometimes a little reluctant <#> That area round the arcadia is a kind of a natural social centre <#> It 's a bit of an amphitheatre <#> Uh parents with young children it 's a natural place for them to bring them with a little pool for them to sail their boats and a fairly safe place for them to bathe <#> The older people are there sitting on the benches taking in whatever sun there may be <,> chatting to their cronies <,> occasionally pursing their lips at the follies of youth <#> All the time I meet people that I know <#> Uh and it 's very nice to hear what 's happened to them in the interim <#> People are very open here <&> conversation with locals </&> <#> I used to come up here to take part in the tennis tournament <#> They 'd a very good tennis tournament <#> And we combine tennis with uh <,> social life girlfriends and the rest of it <#> And I met my wife here <#> I 'd known her slightly before but we teamed up while up here and you know had a lot of fun on the beach and the dances and things <,> the kind of things that uh young people did at the time <#> Nineteen forty-five was a very crucial for year for me as for many other people <#> It was the year when I was due to get my results from what was the equivalent then of A-levels <#> And I was with my parents and went up from the beach to make a telephone call to the school to find out how I 'd done in these exams <#> And the results were alright but on the way back down I saw a newspaper billboard which said <,> Atomic bomb dropped on Japan <#> And uh I came down and my father said Well what were the results like and I said oh they 're alright but uh what 's an atomic bomb <#> And he said he 'd never heard of it <#> The general public including ourselves knew nothing about atomic weapons at that stage <,> so it came like a bolt from the blue <#> The school results led onto the career in journalism <#> And the dropping of that bomb <,> and the consequences of it for <,> uh international affairs has been the backdrop of the whole of my <,> forty-five forty-six years in journalism <#> I 've always been very fond of the sea having been brought up in Belfast <,> on the north side of Belfast <,> you 're always in sight of Belfast Lough <#> But but I 've always felt slightly uncomfortable when I 'm living too far from the sea <#> Even <,> my present <,> way of life at Westminster when I 'm walking across the bridge in the mornings if I come in by train <,> I tend to look down the river to where <,> the outside world begins because I <.> w </.> feel that in cities you 're somewhat <,> cabined and confined <,> whereas if you 've got access to the sea <,> it sort of opens your mind and your imagination <#> August on the north coast of Ireland is really my great break from Westminster <#> Parliament usually rises at the end of July <,> the party conferences begin again in September so there 's this oasis <#> And I try to use it not only for physical refreshment but we pack a <,> a big cardboard box of books into the boot of the car <#> We never get through them all here but at least it gives you some chance for intellectual as well as physical refreshment <#> <quote> These beauteous forms <,> through a long absence have not been to me as is a landscape to a blind man 's eye <,> but oft in lonely rooms and mid the din of towns and cities I have owed to them in hours of weariness <,> sensation sweet <,> felt in the blood and felt along the heart <,> and passing even into my purer mind with tranquil restoration </quote> <#> Well that was Wordsworth <,> and for my money the greatest poet of nature talking about how he escaped very different places <#> This for me these beaches these headlands these waves are the escape from the ordinary world of Westminster <#> Just like to come up here and walk and read a bit <,> and think <#> I mean as I 've grown older <,> I 've become more interested in nature <#> And I do like this rugged kind of <,> tortured scenery <,> that gives you some sense of having been here forever <#> You have a great sense of the elements here <,> and of eternity <,,> <#> I suppose it must be the Puritan in me but I 've always seen some kind of merit in swimming in cold water <#> I enjoy coming down here because <,> there 's a sort of physicality about the sea and about these kind of rockwaters that we have around this north coast of Ireland <#> I had uh <,> major heart surgery about seven years ago <,> a a coronary artery bypass <#> And I think that what swimming in this kind of sea does for me is that it <,> convinces me that I 've still got some of my youth left and a certain amount of survivability <#> And although one has occasional doubts about the state of one 's health <,> I think throwing yourself into a cold sea which obviously I know won't do me any harm <,> but I think it does sort of make you realise that you can do things you <.> s </.> did when you were <,> young and I 'm lucky enough to be doing it in the same kind of place that I did it when I was young <#> And I suppose the swimming in the sea is a kind of a personal <,> testimony to myself <#> Well that was very nice <#> It 's actually much warmer than it looks <#> I suppose my ludicrous self-image is that of Chairman Mao <,> who at the age of about eighty used to swim across the Yangtze <#> I don't know whether I 'll still be doing him out when I 'm eighty but I 'm enjoying it in the meantime <&> music </&> <#> Portrush for me is about memory <#> I mean I 'm enough of a Freudian to think that <,> what happens to you in early childhood does influence your attitude to life <#> And I think it was the kind of family life I had and the kind of holidays associated with it that make me on the whole <,> I wouldn't say a wholly optimistic person but a basically happy person</I>
