<W2B-014 Student life><I><W2B-014$A><h> <bold> <#> who to turn to when life gets tough in the student world </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> student life has its fair share of problems. <#> shane donaghey reports on what to do when a crisis arrives </p><p> <#> It 's an extremely lucky student who gets through their entire time in third-level education without one sort of crisis or another. </p><p> <#> What can start out as a trivial matter can quickly explode into something much more serious if not dealt with quickly. </p><p> <#> Problems can range from harassment to tenancy agreements, to drug dependency, unplanned pregnancy, stress and overwork. <#> They can cover educational matters too. </p><p> <#> What is important is that there is any number of people who can help with every problem a student is likely to face. <#> Advice is nearly always free, and, importantly, non-judgmental. </p><p> <#> The first port of call for most students with a problem is their Students ' Union. </p><p> <#> The unions have several, frequently full-time officers who can offer advice on welfare, housing, accommodation etc. <#> They also have an extensive network of advisers on which to draw upon. </p><p> <#> The education officer, for example, can advise on changing courses, difficulties and delays in obtaining a grant, postgraduate courses, funding and even changing colleges. </p><p> <#> If an academic situation has become so bad that you are up before the beak (your faculty progress or disciplinary committee), the education officer can help you make a case out of something other than bursting into tears and hoping for the best. <#> They can also be present at the committee hearing. </p><p> <#> With grants and accommodation becoming worse, officials dealing with student welfare are finding their workload increasing. </p><p> <#> Queen 's Students ' Union has improved its service this year with the introduction of the Welnet computer database. <#> The system contains information on accommodation, employment and finance. </p><p> <#> The idiot-proof system can print a CV, a useful little item in the big world. </p><p> <#> The Student Counselling Service can also provide a helpline. <#> The service provides a confidential, friendly and professional service with fully-trained counsellors. <#> As well as practical help, student counsellors are also trained to deal with more complicated personal and emotional problems from depressions to bereavement. </p><p> <#> Methods are based normally on non-directive counselling. <#> It is strictly confidential unless the student is agreed that information may be given to another person if he or she believes it would help overcome the problem. </p><p> <#> In the excitement of leaving home and moving into a new environment, the issue of health is sometimes forgotten. <#> It is easily done, but health should not be neglected. </p><p> <#> Both universities require medicals from their freshers. <#> It is a good idea to register with their health services as well, or with a GP. <#> Colleges offer the same full range of health care cover as the local health centre. </p><p> <#> An increasing concern is the health of students when they are away over the summer, either on holiday, field trips or gaining experience. </p><p> <#> College medical staff are also on call when needed. </p><p> <#> For those who would rather speak with fellow students in complete confidence, there is the Nightline service. <#> It provides someone to talk to over the phone at night from 8pm to 8am. <#> From 8pm to 10pm you can also call in at 41 University Street. <#> (This address is likely to change over the next few months.) </p><p> <#> Both universities have an extensive network of chaplains covering most major religions. <#> Up-to-date details can be found in the universities ' handbooks. </p><p> <#> While drink is taken to be as much a part of university life as exams, alcohol can cause serious problems for students. <#> The Northern Ireland Council on Alcohol offers and education service to guide students at either 40 Elmwood Avenue, Belfast (0232) 664434, 461 Falls Road, 330499, or 219 Albertbridge Road, 731602. </p><p> <#> The Samaritans have an outstanding record in dealing with problems of health, relationship or bereavement worries 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. </p><p> <#> The organisation provides a listening ear in complete confidentiality. <#> The caller 's name is not needed. <#> They will listen to anyone with any kind of trouble that may be bothering them. <#> They also welcome callers for talk on a one-to-one basis. </p><p> <#> There are branches throughout the north. <#> The Derry number is 265511, Coleraine 320000 and Belfast 664422. </p><p> <#> It 's important to remember that no matter how big or small the problem, there is someone who can offer advice or an ear. <#> It may be a cliche, but a problem shared is a problem halved. </p></I><I><W2B-014$B><h> <bold> <#> educate to liberate: women find freedom </bold> </h><p> <#> women get some degree of equality at university, says maeve quigley, but they need to play an active role in their students ' union to ensure they get an equal say </p><p> <#> UNIVERSITIES are probably the only places in existence where women have achieved some significant degree of equality. </p><p> <#> For years at school, in the home, in the workplace and elsewhere, women encountered some kind of marginalisation, so while they 're at university it 's important they make the best of their time. </p><p> <#> Most women find that university provides a lot more freedom than school, sometimes too much. <#> You can be left behind by the university whirl unless you make a concerted effort to become involved, not just in your studies and social life, but in the countless clubs and societies that your university and students ' union offer. </p><p> <#> It is essential that women involve themselves with the politics of their union, as, just like any other political arena, student politics is essentially a male-dominated pastime due more to social conditioning in second-level education rather than to the political structure of the students ' union itself. </p><p> <#> The problem with this is that if more women do not start attending Union General Meetings (UGMs) and standing for council and sabbatical elections, policies on abortion and women 's rights decided by a majority of men who, even though they may be the most PC males on the planet, still can't fully understand what being a woman entails. </p><p> <#> Inside your students ' union you may well find a women 's group, but before you dismiss it as being full of short-haired, bra-burning, men-hating feminists, why not go and see for yourself. <#> You 'll be pleasantly surprised to find a group of people around your own age who just get together to discuss issues relevant to female students, and not a dungaree in sight! </p><p> <#> Probably the most important issue for a woman at university is safety. <#> Over the past few years sexual attacks have been becoming more and more prolific in and around the universities, around the halls of residences and on the campuses themselves. <#> As recently as mid-September, the welfare office at Queen 's University issued a warning to prevent female students desperate for accommodation leaving their addresses and telephone numbers on notice boards for their own personal safety. </p><p> <#> But at Queen 's Students' Union, safety for women is high on the agenda, as Welfare Officer Alison Ahern explains: <quote> "There is a feeling that the streets are more dangerous for women than before. </p><p> <#> "Here we are constantly putting up posters for the Rape Crisis Centre and Nexus to remind victims of sexual attacks that they can find support. </p><p> <#> "The Women 's officer and myself can be approached at any time for help on matters to do with pregnancy, sexual harassment or any other problems that are causing difficulties for the student." </quote> </p><p> <#> For their own personal protection, female students are advised to get a personal safety alarm at the beginning of the year. <#> These are readily available from the Queen 's Students' Union shop at discount prices. </p><p> <#> They have been recommended by the police as from the union, and have the added feature of a panic button. <#> Queen 's also runs a women 's night-time minibus service seven nights a week. </p><p> <#> For your own protection you must always remember these safety rules: <#> 1 Try not to walk anywhere by yourself in the dark. <#> If walking in the dark alone: <#> <*> bullet point </*> make sure you have a personal safety alarm <#> <*> bullet point </*> carry your keys in your hand to defend yourself <#> <*> bullet point </*> stick to well lit areas, and areas where it is likely to be busy <#> <*> bullet point </*> always make sure that someone else knows where you are </p><p> <#> These are necessary safety precautions, but there 's no point in being too terrified to go outside either. <#> For male and female students alike, socialising will play a very big part in your university career so the best advice that you can get is enjoy it while it lasts! </p></I><I><W2B-014$C><h> bold> <#> it 's tidy, it 's cheap - it doesn't exist </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> Good houses are rare - and prices are rocketing. <#> John Lappin looks at student accommodation </bold> </p><p> <#> YES, there is a housing crisis this year and no, we can't give you any numbers to prove it. <#> There is always a rush for flats and houses in September, <}> <-> increasingly </-> <+> increasing </+> </}> the underlying stresses in the student market. </p><p> <#> If you are a first-year you should be alright, having priority with the universities. <#> If you are not, there is a greater chance you will be sleeping on a friend 's sofa or commuting from home in the back of beyond. </p><p> <#> <}> <-> Statistic </-> <+> Statistics </+> </}> are hard to find but the time it takes to get a flat gets longer each year. <#> Estate agents have had to cope with students coming to their offices in tears because they can't find a flat. <#> Welfare offices are under more strain while the Student Housing Association <}> <-> Cooperatiave </-> <+> Cooperative </+> </}> (Shac), a non-profit-making housing organisation, has a waiting list stretching back to April in Belfast and to February in Coleraine. </p><p> <#> The days when if you were stuck at the start of term it was because you had stayed on two weeks too long at your summer job in America are long over. </p><p> <#> If you do find yourself without a roof over your head what can you do? <#> The first thing is not to panic and make sure you keep in contact with your welfare officer and university accommodation office. <#> But don't just depend on things being done for you. <#> Keep looking at accommodation notice boards and in newspapers, ask your friends - many houses and rooms can be let through word of mouth. </p><p> <#> As for that little flat in Stranmillis with central heating, economy 7, microwave, jacuzzi, satellite TV, cocktail bar and charming balcony <}> <-> compete </-> <+> complete </+> </}> with climbing roses, and all for <*> pound sign </*> 80 a month, some Tory student at Queen 's probably got daddy to buy it for him. </p><p> <#> Queen 's Welfare Officer Alison Ahern was seeing 15 students a day a week before term began. <#> She found an average price of <*> pound sign </*> 110 a month for a single room but with more students than ever paying from <*> pound sign </*> 85 to <*> pound sign </*> 110 a month for sharing a room. </p><p> <#> She said: <quote> "We 've just got the database up and running. <#> We 're appealing to landlords to send us information about vacancies so we can advertise it as soon as possible. <#> I let people use the phone so they can phone up quickly and let them know their rights as tenants but I can't build houses." </quote> </p><p> <#> Accommodation manager at Queen 's, Conor Brown, had no worries about housing first-years but conceded that there was no enough student housing in Belfast. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The university intake is not as high as it was last year. <#> At this time of year we specialise in first-year students. <#> My impression is that this year is not as bad <}> <-> a </-> <+> as </+> </}> former years," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> At the University of Ulster, Jordanstown and Magee seem to have less of a problem but many UUJ students choose to live in Belfast, increasing pressures on the city 's housing stock. </p><p> <#> There are difficulties in Coleraine, highlighted by Shac, who has encountered problems with rising student numbers and slower student turnover. <#> The recession meant fewer jobs in their home towns or abroad so students worked near campus over the summer and held on to their houses. </p><p> <#> Another problem is that some bed and breakfasts insist that students clear out belongings at weekends and holidays to make way for other guests. </p><p> <#> Jan O'Neil, speaking for Shac in Coleraine, said new buildings were needed to squeeze the worst of the landlords out of the market but added that there were often objections to planning applications in the area. </p><p> <#> The greatest squeeze seems to be in Belfast. <#> Houses are in demand not just from students but from former students now working in Belfast. <#> In other cases landlords have sold up because the Housing Executive is enforcing multiple occupation regulations. </p><p> <#> Renovation has priced many houses and flats out of the student market. <#> The background to this has been increasing student number in the last few years at both universities while new building programmes have not matched the increase, putting more pressures on the existing stock. <#> Finally many English-based insurance companies have withdrawn cover from student houses and this has had some impact this side of the Irish Sea. </p><p> <#> Ray Cashell, director of Shac in Belfast, says: <quote> "There are a lot of different angles on this but at this stage we 're talking about a shortfall of several hundred people who have not an answer to their housing problem. <#> People will tend to find somewhere but somewhere is often sleeping on a settee or doubling in a room." </quote> </p></I>
