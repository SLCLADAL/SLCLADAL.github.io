<W2C-003 Sunday Life 1><I><W2C-003$A><h> <#> Hounded - for taking a leak! <#> Stephanie Bell </h><h> <#> Spending a penny behind a wall cost and Ulsterman his freedom - and Scottish police a small fortune! </h><p> <#> Police in Stranraer tracked Lurgan man Paul McCann to Northern Ireland <bold> <it> last week </bold> </it> for urinating behind a wall in Scotland <bold> <it> a year ago! </bold> </it> </p><p> <#> He was then: arrested by the CID in front of his girlfriend and nine-year-old son in Belfast Harbour airport. <#> Held for three hours in Holywood Barracks. <#> Hand-cuffed and escorted by two Scottish policemen onto the Seacat. <#> Locked in a police cell in Stranraer for seventy-two hours. <#> Brought to court on Monday and fined fifty pounds for giving a false name and address to police in Stranraer on September twenty-fifth nineteen ninety-two. <#> Mr. McCann, thirty two, who had no idea he had been summonsed for the offence, was returning to England, where he now lives, on Friday after visiting his mother in Lurgan. </p><p> <#> When he was released he was left to find his own way back to Belfast and on to his home in England. </p><p> <#> The nightmare ordeal related to an incident when Mr McCann was living in Scotland last year. </p><h> <#> Drunk </h><p> <quote> <#> "I had been to a disco and was pretty drunk. <#> It was about two thirty am and I went to have a pee behind a wall," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> <quote> "When the police arrested me I gave them a bit of stick and a false name and address. <#> They put me in a cell overnight and when I sobered up the next morning I co-operated fully with them. <#> They told me if I didn't hear anything in four weeks that I probably wouldn't be summonsed." </quote> </p><p> <#> Six weeks later Mr McCann left Scotland thinking the police had decided not to charge him. </p><p> <#> He had forgotten all about the incident until last Friday. </p><p> <#> He said: <quote> "We had just checked out bags in at the airport when a CID man put his hand on my shoulder and told me there was a warrant for my arrest. </p><p> <#> I was devastated. <#> It was really embarrassing being arrested in front of everybody, I felt like a murderer. </p><p> <#> My girlfriend and son had to fly home not knowing what was happening to me." </quote> </p><p> <#> He pleaded guilty to three charges in Stranraer District Court on Monday and was admonished on two - disorderly behaviour and urinating in public. </p><p> <#> He said: <quote> "I had to find my own way home and spend another night in Northern Ireland before I could get a flight back to England." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr McCann works as an overhead linesman in Devon. </p><p> <#> He said: <quote> "I 've missed three days at work and lost about two hundred and fifty pounds in wages. <#> I can't believe that the police would go to so much trouble and expense. </p><p> <#> If I had known about the summons I would have went to court. <#> They didn't have to treat me like some dangerous criminal." </quote> </p><p> <#> Police in Stranraer described Mr. McCann as <quote> "the unfortunate victim of circumstances." </quote> </p><p> <#> Sergeant Neil McCleod told Sunday Life: <quote> "It is standard procedure regardless of the nature of the offence that a warrant is issued for the arrest of a person who fails to answer a summons. </p><h> <#> Summons </h><p> <#> Mr McCann has failed one way or another to answer the summons and unfortunately police are legally obliged to arrest him no matter where he is. </p><p> <#> Friday was probably the worst day he could have been arrested as the next court he could have appeared at was not until Monday." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-003$B><h> <#> Paisley preaches for men 's mag! </h><p> <#> A racy men 's magazine has featured the secrets of Ian Paisley 's preaching - alongside instructions on how to smoke <{> <-> cannibis </-> <+> cannabis </+> </}> and undress an actress! </p><p> <#> In a wide-ranging series on experts in their own field, the magazine 'Esquire' asked the firebrand Free Presbyterian Moderator how to capture a congregation 's attention. </p><p> <#> But it sandwiches the DUP leader 's advice to aspiring clergymen between bizarre tips on: how to blow smoke rings. <#> How to breed koi fish. <#> How to get an actress to take her clothes off. <#> How to roll a three-skin joint. </p><p> <#> Among the "experts" interviewed by the magazine are cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, glamour photographer John Stoddard, rock guitarist Rick Parfitt and American sprinter Carl Lewis. </p><p> <#> Dr Paisley 's tips of successful preaching included the advice to keep the message simple, use plain English and simple words. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Transparency gives the sermon clarity. <#> If the preacher really knows what he 's talking about, he can make the message clear and plain. <#> It means simple words, short sentences and clear diction. </p><p> <#> Temper gives it conviction. <#> The preacher must not only have mastered his subject, but his subject must have mastered him," </quote> he added. </p></I><I><W2C-003$C><h> <#> Bitter Legacy of the Lover Priests </h><p> <#> A year ago, in the wake of the Bishop Eamonn Casey love scandal, controversial Larne priest Father Pat Buckley formed a support group for the lovers of 'celibate' Catholic clergy. </p><p> <#> For the first time, a journalist has been allowed to attend a meeting of the group and experience at first hand the bitter legacy of the romeo priests. </p><p> <#> Names have been changed to protect the women 's identities. </p><p> <#> The meeting is discussing the main item on the agenda - heartbreak. </p><p> <#> Suddenly, tears flow down the cheeks of Sandra, an attractive, dark-haired girl in her late twenties. <#> Soon, she is sobbing uncontrollably. </p><p> <#> The scene is just one of many which encapsulate the way Ireland 's priest romeos are leaving a terrible legacy of heartbreak and grief in the wake of illicit love affairs. </p><p> <#> In a pattern played out time after time, they are shattering the lives of their lovers; frequently by accusing them of Eve-like, seducing them into breaking their celibacy vows. </p><p> <#> Then they dump them without mercy, leaving them to pick up the wreckage of their lives. </p><p> <#> Sandra 's tears came during a secret meeting of an organisation established to give these casualties of Ireland "celibate" clerics some emotional support. </p><p> <#> Set up by controversial priest Father Pat Buckley, it now has fifty-four members - a number which will astonish the many Catholics who believe that their priests are paragons of purity and virtue. </p><p> <#> The meeting of the organisation, Bethany Revisited, named after a scene in the Bible, was held at a secret location in Ireland. </p><p> <#> Among the heart-breaking stories which emerged were how one woman has had two babies after falling for a priest. <#> Another priest has a nun as a lover, and yet another has six lovers - all at the one time! </p><h> <quote> <#> 'He said that I tried to trap him' </quote> </h><p> <#> Before her flood of tears, Sandra had revealed that she was just seventeen when she met a handsome Catholic curate in her local parish. </p><p> <quote> <#> "I went to see him about some problems I was having," </quote> she said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "I never, ever dreamed that anything could happen. <#> I respected him as a priest. <#> That 's the way I was brought up: very strictly. </quote> </p><h> <#> Kiss </h><p> <#> <quote> "He started it. <#> He grabbed me one day out of the blue and kissed me. <#> I don't mean a little peck. <#> It was a full, passionate kiss. </p><p> <#> He pinned me to the wall. <#> He did this a few times, and he started something within me. <#> I just fell in love with him. </p><p> <#> To hide what we were doing, we had to do all this cloak and dagger stuff." </quote> </p><p> <#> They stopped short of full intercourse. <#> However eventually, after a lengthy period of time, the two made love when the priest had decided to leave his active ministry - while still technically remaining a priest. </p><p> <#> Sandra says she has now had two children to him. </p><p> <#> Her tears come from a broken heart because he considers her an Eve for leading him into temptation. </p><p> <quote> <#> "After I became pregnant, he said I had tried to trap him," </quote> she explained. </p><p> <quote> <#> "But I had only done so to prove to him that I loved him." </quote> </p><p> <#> Sobbing, Sandra recalled the astounding answer the priest came up with to her pregnancy problem: <quote> <#> "He told me I could have the baby adopted or have an abortion. </quote> </p><h> <#> Blamed </h><p> <quote> <#> "He wanted me to go to England to get rid of our baby to save himself embarrassment. <#> I couldn't believe it. </p><p> <#> As a Catholic priest, he was sworn to protect life. <#> And he blamed me for all of it." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-003$D><h> <#> Government cash to protect Sinn Fein <#> Alan Murray </h><p> <#> The Government is expected to provide financial assistance to help protect Sinn Fein advice centres from loyalist attacks. </p><p> <#> Sunday Life has learned that the Northern Ireland Office will stump up taxpayers ' money to the IRA 's political wing for the protection of its premises. </p><h> <#> Attacks </h><p> <#> It is understood the NIO will provide a percentage of the total cost of installing extra security measures at centres. </p><p> <#> The change of policy follows recent attacks by loyalist paramilitaries on Sinn Fein advice centres. </p><h> <#> Siege </h><p> <#> In May loyalists opened fire on Sinn Fein advice centre in Lepper Street, north Belfast. <#> Two men were later arrested - one was shot by an Army marksman and the other taken from a house following a siege. </p><p> <#> Two months later, in a separate incident, the Lepper Street advice centre was attacked by the UFF. </p><p> <#> A blast bomb was thrown but the device failed to explode. </p><p> <#> A source told Sunday Life: <quote> 'The NIO will provide financial assistance to Sinn Fein to provide security measures at its advice centres. </p><p> <#> "Even though most of its offices are protected with security grills and reinforced doors, the NIO will provide money for any more security measures that are needed." </quote> </p><p> <#> Sinn Fein councillors have also applied to the NIO for financial assistance for security measures at their homes, but this has been turned down. </p><p> <#> A number of councillors are asking for a judicial review of an RUC decision not to give them the go-ahead to get personal protection weapons. </p><p> <#> A decision on the review is expected in the High Court within the coming weeks. </p><p> <#> An NIO spokesman told Sunday Life: <quote> 'The matter of providing financial assistance for security at Sinn Fein advice centres is still under consideration." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-003$D><h> <#> The March of Time </h><p> <#> Special report on how the Army has changed in twenty-four years on the streets of Ulster. </p><p> <#> The march of time in Ulster has transformed the British soldier, as these pictures reveal. <#> Almost twenty-five years after the troops were first deployed in the province their equipment, combat gear, training and role in the conflict has changed dramatically. </p><p> <#> The tin-hatted soldiers who were sent into to quell riots on the troubled street of Londonderry and Belfast must look enviously at the gear provided for the modern soldier. </p><p> <#> For the troops who were sent here in the summer of nineteen sixty-nine were ill-prepared for urban conflict. </p><p> <quote> <#> "In the early years training was haphazard. <#> For a start, few were absolutely certain what to train for,' </quote> recalled one former officer. </p><p> <#> Sent into to keep the peace between warring communities the first soldiers had no more legal powers than the ordinary citizen until the Special Powers Act gave them power to stop and question, search and arrest without a warrant. </p><p> <#> Most noticeably the troops were poorly equipped to deal with riots. </p><p> <#> Their standard British Army issue tin helmets were not fitted with any kind of visor to protect against stones and other missiles. </p><p> <#> And when the first visors were introduced they made the heavy hats flop down over the troops ' faces. </p><p> <#> Lighter glass-reinforced helmets, with better ballistic and shock protection, were later developed. </p><p> <#> Riot shields were issued in nineteen seventy but they were clumsy, metal shields which were later replaced by perspex versions. </p><p> <#> And the early soldiers had to endure heavy, badly fitting World War II style combat clothes until the mid-nineteen seventies. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Today 's fatigues are lighter but warmer, showerproof and give a limited protection against flames also. <#> They are a lot more comfortable," </quote> said an Army spokesman. </p><p> <#> Communications were also a nightmare for first soldiers in Ulster - their primitive radio sets were a disaster in built-up areas. </p><p> <#> Helicopters were used to provide an airborne relay station but if they were shot down or ran out of fuel, soldiers on the ground often had to resort to the GPO telephone system. </p><p> <#> Over the years the Army turned to off-the-shelf civilian radio equipment to provide essential communications. </p><p> <#> Army training has also changed dramatically as a result of the Ulster conflict. </p><p> <#> A standard Northern Ireland training package has been in operation for some time including intensive urban and rural patrolling, riot control techniques, shooting at fleeting targets, powers of arrest, orders for opening fire, bomb and weapon recognition. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Soldiers now go to Northern Ireland well-prepared and trained," </quote> said one officer. </p></I>
