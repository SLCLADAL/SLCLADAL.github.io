uhm <,> I thought six hundred and something sterling<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#> That 's okay<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$A> <#> Wasn't it very good <,> wasn't it<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#> Yeah <,> it is <#> <{> <[> Have you booked it </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-047$A> <#> <[> No <,> it only crossed </[> </{> my mind <,> no I haven't booked it <,> but <{> <[> I just thought well </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#> <[> Yes <#> It 's getting fairly </[> </{> late by the hour<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$A> <#> Yeah <,> and you see <,> Israel and getting a visa<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$A> <#> You know <{> <[> and </[> I have a visa for Damascus on my visa so I don't know if<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#> Well yeah <,> it 's it 's a group <,> you don't need a visa for Israel <,> you <{1> <[1> need a visa for Jordan </[1> <,> yes <,> and a group visa does if they have more than twenty people <,> cos I was supposed to be going <{2> <[2> last </[2> Christmas <,> yes <,> yeah yeah <,> and then the <{3> <[3> friend </[3> I was going with <,> her sister had to be <,> her sister died <{4> <[4> so </[4> it was cancelled and uhm <,> but we were travelling on a group visa cos we were more than twenty <{5> <[5> people </[5> to Jordan and <{6> <[6> you don't need one </[6> for <{7> <[7> Israel </[7> but you just have to see to it I think that the Israelis don't

<[3> to go </[3> so <#> For just go somewhere <#> <{4> <[4> And I </[4> began to think maybe I shouldn't bother spending all that much money because I think <,> I have neglected I used to do Spanish last <{5> <[5> year </[5> <,> and I thought maybe if I spent one month in Spain next summer <{6> <[6> <,> doing an intensive course </[6> because I 've had to give up <#> I haven't time to do Spanish this term <,> <#> It was too intensive and we had too much <{7> <[7> homework <,> </[7> <#> So I just couldn't do it at all<ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-047$B> <#>
