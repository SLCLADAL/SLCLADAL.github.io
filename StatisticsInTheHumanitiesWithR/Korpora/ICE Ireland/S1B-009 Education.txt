<ICE-IRE:S1B-009 Education><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Did any of your schools <,> or the students walk out or anything<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$B> <#> Ours tried to <&> laughter </&> <#> But I have to say the gates were locked <&> laughter </&> <#> There 's another one at one o'clock tomorrow<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$C> <#> Tried to walk out today did they<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$B> <#> Aye <#> But they were just told to get back to class and to wise up <&> laughs </&> <,> basically<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Yeah <#> Two of my daughters are on opposite sides of this debate in their school<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$B> <#> Did you get your letter this morning in the post <#> There was a letter from Fortwilliam<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Is that right <#> No I didn't I have <,> I haven't seen it yet<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$B> <#> Just to say that the children were obliged to stay in school for health and safety reasons <&> laughter </&> <#> It was posted out under parent and guardian names<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$D> <#> We sent a letter out too<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Okay <#> Well what I want to do uhm <,> this evening 's session <,> the uhm there 's a couple of things <#> First of all I want to pick up pick up on some of the issues that we touched on last week around issues of uhm sort of rights and and diversity and difference <#> Uhm and so I want to cover some issues around that first of all <,> some <,> some some data and information around that and that 's partly why I gave you this uhm that little questionnaire on ethnic minorities <#> That was used in a uhm little study that uh I was involved in a couple of years ago <,> where we certainly got a large number of teachers to try and get a sense of uhm the extent to which uh teachers were aware of uh some of these uh issues related to ethnic minorities <,> and so uh just wanted to <,> I gave you that questionnaire <,> your responses with the primary responses from the larger group of teachers that we uhm we were engaged with <#> The uhm <,> uh <,> and then I want to give the time to talk through some of the stuff that 's coming out of the yellow forms <,> I mean <,> uh the assignment <,> uh well the impression I get is that everything 's fine <#> No problem <&> laughter </&> <#> The uh <,> uh <,> and then the uhm <,> uh the the last part of the session I want to start addressing the issue about uhm the role of of uh schools uh in uh addressing reconciliation and tolerance and some of the ways in which that has been addressed over the years <#> Okay <,> so that 's the sort of agenda for this evening 's session <#> First of all <,> is there anything coming out of last week that that anyone wanted to revisit briefly <#> Uh last week we spent most of the time playing games <&> laughter </&> <,> so uhm uh okay so if there 's nothing there <,> okay what I want to do then in this first session is just look look at some <,> some issues around uh gender and and and race really <#> Uhm <,> and the first thing I want to look at is <,> is some issues around gender <#> By tradition uh gender issues in education have have tended to to revolve around the uhm uh <,> have tended to revolve around uh the uh the differential and unfair treatment accorded to girls <#> Uh traditionally it was uh close enough access to uh to girls <,> with particular aspects of the curriculum uhm uh so there 's actually still <,> I mean if you look back at uh educational <,> official documents produced even as late as the nineteen sixties <,> it really is quite astonishing the uh <,> the some of the basic taken-for-granted assumptions there were about the type of curriculum that was appropriate for boys and for girls and how different they were and how this wasn't <,> it was never it didn't appear to be seen as an issue at all <#> And a lot of the stuff that was written around gender issues in education in the sixties and the nineteen seventies uh revolved around that that particular issue <,> attempts to try and promote equal opportunities uh for girls and uh and women <#> Uhm more recently the <,> that has changed <#> Uh and in some <.> res </.> respects that has changed in a bizarre way right <.> acr </.> in the other direction <,> uhm it 's now <,> a lot of the uhm official talk in terms of gender in education being about the under-achievement of boys<&> later in class </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> So this this is a fairly simple way of analysing a relationship between two variables <#> This is for all the <,> the co-ed uh grammar schools in uh ninety-eight ninety-nine <#> So <,> the that 's what the graph is about but but what can we conclude from the graph<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$E> <#> Considerably more girls ' schools <,> that girls are <,> seem to be achieving more than boys <,> one two three four <,> boys ' schools or co-ed schools or whatever are actually <,> you know the boys are out <,> the over-achieving girls<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Yeah <#> And even in three of those cases those three <,> the difference is relatively small <#> They 're not that <,> they 're not that uh widely different from the this uh sort of common common common line <#> This is the only case where there 's <,> the proportion of boys is markedly higher than the proportion of girls <#> And in all the other cases uh the proportion of girls <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is higher than the proportion of boys in the picture <#> Okay so that would suggest <,> what<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$F> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> doing better than boys <,> you know they 've done better in the results <,> whatever the underlying reasons for it are<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Right okay <,> so <,> so in terms of the co-ed grammar schools the <,> that evidence suggests that by and large the girls are doing better than the boys <,> in <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> education <#> Okay <#> The uhm <,> this is the data for uh single-sex grammar schools where the yellow dots are the uhm single-sex girls ' schools and the white dots are the single-sex uh boys ' schools <#> Uh and you can't obviously put them in the same type of graph because they 're different schools <,> okay so they 're not <,> you can't simply compare them in the same the same sort of uh sort of way <#> So what I 've done is simply to rank order the scores for the uh proportions for the <.> gi </.> for the boys and for the girls from the lowest to the highest <#> Okay so that 's simply the rank order of the girls ' schools <,> all single-sex girls ' schools from the highest <,> or uh sorry from the lowest to the highest and the boys ' schools from the lowest to the highest <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> <#> There 's three more uh girls ' schools which is why the the boys are there and there <#> So <,> what can we tell from that<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$G> <#> Girls outperform boys again<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Right okay <#> Is it as simple as that<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$H> <#> It 's more <,> it 's <,> girls ' uh grammar schools are very consistent in high performance<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Yeah <#> Yeah <#> So there 's there 's a great consistency in in the in the girls ' schools <#> So the the lowest is eighty-nine percent <,> uh the highest one hundred percent <#> So quite a narrow <,> uh a narrow sort of variation across them <#> A much wider variation across the boys ' schools for some reason <#> Uh anything else <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$I> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Well that 's just the <,> I just put these in the the same <,> the single-sex boys ' schools <,> this is the one that had the lowest <{> <[> and </[> again that 's the one with the highest <#> I put them in that rank order <,,> <#> Is it the case that all the girls ' schools schools are doing better than all the boys ' schools<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$I> <#> <[> Right so that 's </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$?> <#> <{> <[> No </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$J> <#> <[> No </[> </{> <#> No it 's four schools <,> four boys ' schools that are doing better than some of the girls ' schools<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Yeah yeah <#> And those ones aren't <,> those ones there aren't far off it<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$J?> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$?> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> So there 's a degree of overlap as well <#> So sometimes the way people talk about it it seems that <.> boy </.> <,> girls are doing better than boys <,> the but there 's actually <,> it 's like any sort of spread I suppose <,> there is a degree of overlap <#> That that 's not the very <,> that 's a very crude way of showing it <#> But it shows some degree of overlap <#> So it 's not simply a matter <,> all girls do better than all boys <#> Uh there 's <,> uh there 's it 's a slightly more nuanced picture than than uh than that <#> This is these are the same data for uh secondary schools in the same year <#> Uh this is also the co-ed schools <#> Uh the same principle <,> this is the scores for the boys <,> this is the scores for the <,> for the girls <#> This time it 's the criterion <,> it 's the proportion uh passing five or more uh good GCSEs uh at year twelve <#> Uh uh and this is again it 's the same for the uh co-ed schools <#> What 's happening <,> what 's happening there<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$J> <#> The same picture <#> Girls are outperforming boys virtually uh <,> virtually without exception<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Yeah <#> There 's a few places where boys are doing better but there 's not that widely different from the <,> the centre line <#> Uh the vast majority of the schools are on the other side of the line where the girls are tending to do better <,> and there 's a lot <,> there 's an awful lot more of the schools where the girls are doing markedly better than the uhm <,> than the boys <#> Okay so in a sense that 's sort of <,> it 's it 's very similar to the sort of pattern that was found for the uh co-ed uh grammar schools <#> Uhm <,> and then the uh single-sex secondary schools <,> again rank order uh from lowest to highest uh <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> for the boys ' schools and for the girls ' schools<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$B> <#> There 's not as much difference this time <,> in the low <,> much closer<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Yeah <#> There 's there 's there 's quite a <,> there 's a reasonable degree of variation across them all <#> <{> <[> I </[> mean that fits in with the the high degree of variation we get with the secondary schools more generally <#> Uhm the uh <,> the there 's much more overlap<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> In terms of the scores <,> so there 's there 's <,> some of the the boys ' schools are markedly lower than any of the girls ' schools but not that many of them <,> uh and there 's not that many of the girls ' schools are above all of the <,> the boys ' schools <#> So it 's much more a case of overlap even though there 's sort of a broadly consistent pattern where the girls are on average clearly doing doing better <#> Okay <#> Now <,> so so what can we conclude from all of these things in relation to the uh the this sort of data on this uh issue about boys doing better or girls doing better <#> What would be a a reasonable set of conclusions to take <,> take out of out of those data<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$?> <#> Well using exam results as you know raw data the girls seem to be coming out on average slightly better but there are exceptions to the rule and anybody <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> co-ed works that way I mean might turn round and say <,> look well my son or daughter 's going to a single-sex school because of the advantages of that over co-ed <{> <[> and </[> look at it that way<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Yeah yeah <#> There is I think a widespread <,> well there appears to be a sort of a popular uh <,> there 's probably a good number of parents who do want their daughters to go to single-sex schools and their sons to go to co-ed schools which obviously is a mutually contradictory set of aspirations <#> But uhm <,> uh uh partly because there is a belief that girls will do better in single-sex schools <,> uh whereas boys will be civilised in co-ed schools <&> laughter </&> <#> Uh I don't know <,> I don't know about the latter bit of it but uh what 's happening in practice is that girls generally do better regardless <#> So the evidence doesn't suggest that single-sex schools provide any performance uh any benefit <,> uhm partly because of this sort of pattern that uhm girls are doing uh doing better <,> doing better generally<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$J?> <#> Is there a comparison at all between boys in a single <.> s </.> <,> you know boys in a single-sex and boys in a co-ed <#> Rather than all pupils in a<ICE-IRE:S1B-009$A> <#> Uhm <,> I honestly can't remember <#> The uhm most of the analysis on these things has tended to focus on on girls <#> Uhm and I wouldn't want to say uh <,> my suspicion is that statistically it wouldn't make much of a difference</I>
