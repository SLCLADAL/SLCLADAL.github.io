<W2D-017 Driving test><I><W2D-017$A><h> <ul> <#> All About the Driving Test </h> </ul><h> <bold> <#> REQUIREMENTS FOR UNDERGOING YOUR DRIVING TEST </bold> </h><p> <#> 1. Take along a valid Irish provisional licence for the category of the driving test you are now undergoing. </p><p> <#> 2. Your vehicle must be in roadworthy condition, with lights, brakes and signals in working order. </p><p> <#> 3. Your vehicle must display a current tax disc with proper registration number shown. </p><p> <#> 4. Your vehicle must display a valid insurance disc (if Irish registered) with registration number, not chassis number, shown. </p><p> <#> 5. L plates (15 cm <sp> 2 </sp> ) with a red L on a white background should be displayed front and rear of all vehicles except motorbikes and tractors. </p><p> <#> 6. Bring along your appointment slip. <#> If you cannot keep this appointment, you should give at least 10 days notice, otherwise you will forfeit your fee and have to re-apply for a new test. </p><p> <#> Conditions 1 to 5 are legal requirements. <#> Failing any of these, your driving test will not be conducted and you will lose your fee and go back to the end of the waiting list. </p><p> <#> Please note that your driving examiner is exempt from wearing a seat belt (if he/she so wishes), do not insist on him/her wearing it. </p><p> <#> Also note that if either tax or insurance disc is faded or illegible, you must have them replaced prior to the test. <#> Trade plates are not acceptable for undergoing your test. </p><p> <#> Use the boxes provided on page 9 to tick off requirements several days before your test, thus giving you the time to have everything in order for the day. </p><p> <#> <bold> N.B. </bold> <#> If you have just realised that <bold> your provisional licence is out of date </bold> for the day of your test, you will need to have it replaced. <#> This procedure is not as simple as it used to be. <#> Driving licences or provisional licences are not handed out over the counter as was the practice previously. <#> Now you must receive your documents through the post. <#> In some areas this may take several weeks. <#> However, if your driving test is imminent, you should bring your driving test appointment slip and a completed provisional licence form, not forgetting two photographs, to your relevant licencing authority, and see the supervisor in charge. <#> He/she will normally issue your licence within a couple of hours. <#> Note that the licence application, depending on your category, may require general medical information. <#> You may use the form D501, available through your local tax office, and have it completed and signed by your general practitioner. <#> Persons over the age of 70 will also need this certificate of fitness (D501). </p><p> <bold> <#> Eyesight Test: </bold> all applicants for a provisional licence for categories A1, A, B, EB or W must undergo a once-off eyesight test. <#> If your optician has stated that you must wear corrective lenses, you should not forget them for the test, or indeed ever drive without them. <#> This information is recorded on your licence with the words, <quote> "corrective lenses must be worn." </quote> </p><p> <bold> <#> Medical Test: </bold> <#> Applicants for a provisional licence for categories C, C1, D, D1, EC, EC1, ED or ED1 must undergo a medical examination (see page 101). </p><p> <bold> <#> Special Driving Tests: </bold> <#> Candidates applying for a driving test, who have any disability (difficulty of hearing or any other physical disability) should have their practitioner fill out the form D501, certificate of fitness. <#> It would also be courteous to include any detail they might find informative to the Department, e.g. any special adaptations to the vehicle they propose to use for the driving test. <#> These should be attached and sent to: <#> <it> The Driver Testing Section, Department of the Environment, Government Offices, Ballina, Co.Mayo. Phone: 096-70677 </it><p> <#> If you have any special queries regarding your particular disability, you should write to or phone the above address. </p><h> <bold> <&Irish> <#> An Scr&/ud&/u Tiom&/ana&/iochta: </bold> <&/Irish> </h><h> <#> (The Driving Test <it> in Irish </it> ) </h><p> <#> In order to undergo a driving test through the Irish language you must fill out a special application form, available through your local Motor Taxation Office. <#> Your test will then be conducted through Irish, i.e. the Questions and Answers part of the test and directions for your practical driving. <#> There is also a separate form for those wishing to have their Driving Licence document in Irish. <#> To obtain these forms you should contact your local taxation office. </p><&> vehicle descriptions </&><h> <bold> <#> STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE TEST </bold> </h><p> <#> The diagram shows the main points an examiner looks out for. <#> They are not necessarily in order as it will depend on the examiner on the day and the direction he chooses to take. <#> However, you may use it as a guide to the amount you will have to do on the day. </p><p> <#> The diagram on page 17 is based on a category B driving test (see page 12) which lasts about 45 minutes. <#> Other categories may well last longer (see HGV, page 102). </p><p> <#> Do not overlook the minutes of relaxation after your driving test as you will have been stressed throughout that period. <#> Rest for several minutes before returning to the road. <#> This will have a calming down effect immediately after your test. </p><h> <bold> <#> General procedure on the day of the test </bold> </h><p> <#> Arrive at the test centre at least 10 minutes prior to your appointed time. <#> You should wait in the waiting room and let the receptionist know you are there. <#> Your name will be called in due course. </p><p> <#> The initial part will start after you produce your current Irish provisional licence to the examiner and sign the required administration forms including a Declaration of Road Worthiness and Insurance (see page 19). <#> The Questions and Answers part of the examination should then take place, after which you will be asked to identify some road traffic signs. </p><p> <#> You will then accompany the examiner to the vehicle where he/she will check your tax and insurance disc and inspect your L plates (front and rear) and generally check the condition of your vehicle. <#> In the case of a HGV, the examiner will check the lights, indicators, stop lights and generally all electrics, not forgetting the minimum number of mirrors, one left and one right. <#> Before moving away, your examiner will say words to this effect: <quote> "There should be no further conversation in the vehicle between you and me other than to tell you to turn right or left. <#> In the absence of a right or a left, I would like you to assume straight. <#> If, however, you don't understand, you may ask and I will repeat." </quote> <#> Don't be unduly worried about this, as it is all part of the test. <#> Try not to be put off by his/her presence in the vehicle. <#> Your examiner may take notes during your diving test. <#> Do not be alarmed at this as it is normal procedure. <#> If you show that you are a competent and confident driver you should pass your test. <#> Remember your training! </p><p> <#> He/she will ask you to move away and take whatever direction the examiner has planned. <#> You will be asked to go right or left. <#> For the most part, a high percentage of examiners will ask you to do a turnabout as a first manoeuvre, followed shortly by a reverse into a limited opening on the left. <#> This is almost certainly followed by arm/handsignals and finally a hill start. <#> This may not be the exact sequence in your test centre, as this will depend on the number of examiners working from the test centre on that day and on the obstructions and traffic within the areas intended for your manoeuvres. </p><p> <#> Your test route will be a well balanced drive including moving away, right turns, left turns, driving along main roads, emerging at junctions, traffic lights, use of traffic lanes, road position, use of controls, mirrors and signals. <#> And remember general observation will play a very big part in your test. </p><p> <#> Almost before you know it, you will be on the way back to the test centre. <#> You will have been concentrating so much, you will wonder where the time went! </p><p> <#> Examiners are not normally allowed to speak to you during your test. <#> Most examiners will not do so. <#> This is because it is felt that it would impair your concentration. <#> In fact, many an examiner has been reprimanded for trying to calm a person down or for trying to help them relax. <#> Complaints have been known to be made when such situations have occurred, this is why the rule now rigidly applies. </p><p> <#> On your return to the test centre, you will accompany the examiner into the centre where you will be informed whether you gained your Certificate of Competency or not. <#> Examiners are not allowed to discuss the reasons for failing (see page 68 on the K Form). <#> A very high percentage of failures are due to three main reasons: <#> 1. faults relating to vehicle control and road procedure <#> 2. lack of professional tuition <#> 3. incorrect observation </p><p> <#> Remember, nerves alone should not bring about a refusal of a Certificate of Competency. </p><h> <bold> <#> General points - Rules of the Road </bold> </h><p> <#> Study the Rules of the Road handbook as this book, <it> The Driving Test in Ireland, </it> is not meant to replace the one which is issued by the National Safety Council for the Minister of the Environment. </p><p> <#> The contents of this government handbook are tested orally at the Questions and Answers part of the test. <#> It is indeed recommended that a person who has passed the driving test should periodically read the latest edition, as new laws, regulations and EC directives are introduced all the time. </p><p> <#> You should be able to answer questions in your own words. <#> You should know all the warning signs: regulatory and informative, road signs and road markings. <#> A key factor in answering any question on the Rules of the Road would be to think of the safety aspect first. <#> Although this book refers a lot to the "Driving test", it must go without saying that "test standard" is a good standard to maintain for the rest of your life. <#> Never think, "I have to drive like this for a test" and the next day forget all you have been taught. <#> Your life could depend on the good habits acquired under the guidance of your driving instructor! </p><&> questionnaire </&><h> <bold> <ul> <#> Control Procedure </bold> </ul> </h><h> <bold> <#> COCKPIT DRILL </bold> </h><p> <#> The proper procedure should be to demonstrate to the examiner the use of the normal everyday pre-start checks. </p><#> D/S/S/S/M<p> <bold> <#> Doors: </bold> <#> Make sure all doors are properly closed. </p><p> <bold> <#> Seats: </bold> <#> Properly adjusted, mainly to suit your clutch control as this pedal is generally the only one that reaches the floor. </p><p> <bold> <#> Steering: </bold> <#> Allow the back of your seat to be sufficiently forward for your arms not to have to stretch. <#> A proper position would be with the elbows bent. </p><p> <bold> <#> Seat belts: </bold> <#> Make sure you have placed your seat belts flat across your body with no twist as this could have the effect of a knife 's edge in the case of a sudden stop. </p><p> <bold> <#> Mirrors: </bold> <#> Ensure that all available mirrors are adjusted to suit you and are kept clean at all times. <#> Adjust inside mirror by using the top and bottom of the mirror base, without touching the glass itself. </p><h> <bold> <ul> <#> USE OF CONTROLS </bold> </ul> </h><h> <bold> <#> Accelerator </bold> </h><p> <#> You should be able to operate it smoothly and sensibly. <#> Never accelerate too fast for the conditions you are driving in. <#> This is for control reasons, not to mention the cost factor in doing so as the harsher the acceleration/deceleration is, the more fuel you use.</p><h> <bold> <#> Footbrake </bold> </h><p> <#> You should be able to stop smoothly, effectively and without jerking, except in an emergency. </p><h> <bold> <#> Clutch </bold> </h><p> <#> You should be able to operate your clutch smoothly, know your 'biting point' (gripping point) and use only when required. <#> When finished using the clutch, remove your foot completely from the pedal as a partially depressed clutch will burn out the clutch. <#> You should be able to coordinate the clutch with the handbrake and accelerator when moving off from a stationary position and when on a hill. <#> Do not coast to a stop, that is to say, do not travel with your clutch depressed for an distance greater than necessary. </p><h> <bold> <#> Steering </bold> </h><p> <#> Keep both hands on the wheel at all times except when operating a control or giving a signal. <#> Your hands should be level on the wheel i.e. ten to two or a quarter to three (clock face position). <#> This is the best operating position for the pull/push movement which is recommended. </p><h> <bold> <#> Horn </bold> </h><p> <#> Many people are reluctant to use the horn during a driving test when in fact, at times, it is imperative. <#> For instance, it could be recommended to attract the attention of a pedestrian who is about to step onto the road in front of you and who, you feel, is not aware of you presence, or in a sharp turn where visibility is limited or obscured. </p><p> <#> These are just two instances. <#> However, normal use of this instrument should not be excessive or aggressive. </p><p> <#> One should also note that between the hours of 11.30 pm (23.30) and 7.00 am (07.00), the horn should not be used except for a traffic emergency. </p></I>
