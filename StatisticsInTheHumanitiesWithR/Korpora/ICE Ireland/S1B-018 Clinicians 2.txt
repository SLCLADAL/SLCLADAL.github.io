<ICE-IRE:S1B-018 Clinicians 2><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Okay <,> uh <,> oh yeah so just in relation to <,> if you notice that there are like we 'll say that there 's one group member <,> like when I popped just into yours<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Uh it did seem that Laura <,> was getting <.> m </.> now this is only the bit I saw <,> but she was talking a bit more than Ted and she tended to jump in even though you may have directed the question to him <,> <#> Uh she had <,> I mean she knew the answer but she tended to kind of jump in <#> <{1> <[1> So </[1> you 'd need to watch that she doesn't we 'll say dominate <,> <{2> <[2> within the group </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[2> Yeah you know </[2> </{2> he improved a lot <{> <[> though didn't he </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[> Yeah it kind of </[> </{> changed the other way <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Okay<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah <#> But just to kind of try and ensure that it 's balanced like <,> that everyone gets their their turn or whatever <,,> <#> Okay any other questions now from this morning<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> What do we do if somebody says <,> <&> sighs </&> I don't want to be here <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$?> <#> <{> <[> Mm </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> Now </[> </{> who was saying like they didn't want to <{> <[> be there </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[> Kim </[> </{> initially didn't know why he was there <,> and he didn't want to be there <,> <{1> <[1> this type </[1> <,> <#> Like so I don't want to be there and everybody seemed like <{2> <[2> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[2> Oh so he </[2> </{2> was missing woodwork <{> <[> was it <#> And then </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[> Was like and then </[> </{> I said to him don't worry <#> We won't be doing that again <#> Do you feel better <#> He <{> <[> said oh yeah I do now </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> Oh yes the time </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> There 's a <{> <[> guy </[> in my group who <,,> wouldn't <#> Tom wouldn't miss woodwork either<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[> To </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Now what time is he <,> does he have woodwork at though<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> What time did I go in at <,> eleven <,> so it was at eleven forty<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> He has woodwork at eleven <{1> <[1> forty </[1> <,,> <#> Oh yeah and we have him down for the <{2> <[2> well </[2> we have to change that group anyway <,> <{3> <[3> because </[3><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[3> Especially so </[3> </{3> because Ted wants the earlier <,> would prefer the earlier slot because he has woodwork at twenty past twelve<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> And then the <,> well you see the two <,> there are two people in your group at eleven forty <{1> <[1> who go for counselling </[1> at twelve so we need to change that group anyway <,> <#> <{2> <[2> Okay </[2> <,> <#> So we could conceivably switch that to five past eleven <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> <#> And then Fred Lappin has woodwork at twelve forty <{4> <[4> no twelve twenty </[4><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[1> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[2> Okay </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[3> Okay </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[4> Twenty </[4> </{4> <,,> and wasn't impressed<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> That 's fair enough <#> I can understand that <#> And <,> Tom O'Byrne has woodwork at eleven forty <,,> <#> Okay so we 'll just have to <,> your groups 'll stay the same but the timing will be different <.> p </.> <{> <[> possibly </[> more than likely<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Because uhm it was a bit confusing today because my group was earlier <,> <#> <{1> <[1> But </[1> I was like oh what do you have <,> at eleven or whatever <#> And I think <,> Laura was on about that she had reading with Mr Duffy <#> And then I was there <,> oh maybe you 're not going to have it now <#> I don't know <,> <#> <{2> <[2> I think but </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[1> Well </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[2> Right well I think </[2> </{2> that today is all because Melanie brought the people<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> Mm yeah that was my fault<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> No it doesn't matter like <,> but it just meant that you know <{1> <[1> it things sort of went </[1> in the order we were <{2> <[2> anticipating </[2> <,> <#> Uhm so hopefully Tim Duffy will have the appointment cards for the students <,> for next week so that they 'll just know the time and they 'll arrive <#> But we 'll have to give them the updated schedule <,> <#> Okay uh so then you just need to go and plan yeah <,> what are you going to do for next week <#> So for the people who are doing <,,> literacy yeah I mean uh <,> I can't really say any more than what 's in this <{3> <[3> already </[3> so a higher level of particularly phoneme<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[1> It was just <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[2> In synch </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> Do you know the way when you <,> I mean that 's a higher level but at the moment <,> I don't know how much phonemes they know or they don't know about phoneme <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> So I am just going start at <,> step one <#> And if <,> I mean we might fly through step one two and three <ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> But I 'm just going to literally start with the alphabet <{> <[> like </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> because the work kind of up until Christmas really is diagnostic <#> <{1> <[1> And it 's a kind of </[1> just finding out at what level they 're operating at <,> and so that you can kind of pitch your therapy then at <{2> <[2> the right </[2> level<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[1> Yeah <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> So is step one like alphabet <,> kind of <,> grapheme phoneme <{> <[> correspondence </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> That 's </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah <,> yeah <,,> <#> Okay so syllable organisation <,> your phonemes within clusters <#> Uhm <,> so that 's literacy group one <,> but literacy group two then however <,> that 's the same thing but more syllable <,> level <#> Okay so the vocabulary work then <#> Yeah look at things like <,> there 's downstairs you know the uh Vanilla Vocabulary I think it 's called<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Yeah I looked at the vocabulary maps<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah <#> That 's another one<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Okay <,> so like would I actually start with stuff like that<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Oh absolutely <{> <[> yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> and just get <,,> like just get them working on the English vocabulary and geography vocabulary <{> <[> or whatever </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <,> and like using kind of multi-modal <,> in <{1> <[1> that </[1> like <#> It 's not just the written word <#> You may have pictures to go along with <{2> <[2> it </[2> or a story that puts the words in <{3> <[3> context </[3> <#> Uhm and as you 're also talking about uhm <,> like that 's written here <,> so word families <#> So you might talk about nouns <,> verbs <,> adjectives <{4> <[4> <,> uhm </[4> words that mean almost the same as <,,> <#> Okay <#> So <{5> <[5> that </[5> if you 're talking about <,> uhm let me think <,,> word from geography like exploration <,> was one of the ones I did last year <#> So you 've exploration in terms of going to Antarctica <{6> <[6> as </[6> an explorer <{7> <[7> <,> but </[7> you 've exploration in terms of oil wells and <.> dr </.> you know that kind of <{8> <[8> thing <#> So </[8> that you give them like <,> the range of meanings for the word <,> and then maybe if it 's <,> and if it 's appropriate words that mean almost the same or words that are the <{9> <[9> opposite </[9> <#> Oh <{10> <[10> okay </[10> <#> So they 're kind of establishing those <{11> <[11> links </[11> semantically <#> Uhm and again anyone get got uh <,,> you got an English book didn't you <#> <{12> <[12> Uhm </[12> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[4> Okay </[4> </{4><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[5> Yeah </[5> </{5><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[6> Yeah </[6> </{6><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[7> Mm </[7> </{7><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[8> Yeah <,> okay </[8> </{8><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[9> Okay </[9> </{9><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[10> Mm </[10> </{10><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[11> Okay </[11> </{11><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[12> Yeah </[12> </{12><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$?> <#> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Oh okay<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> Like should I read the whole book <,> <#> You know<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Oh no <{> <[> I 'd </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[> I 'd say </[> </{> scan<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> For the word<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> I <.> j </.> I can't scan <#> I don't know <#> I can't do that<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Well then pick a chapter <{> <[> and </[> <#> Oh hang on it 's the whole of I mean you just got the <.> t </.> the book The Outsiders out <#> Sorry yeah <#> Thought you meant a textbook <,> <#> Then I 'd read the first chapter<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$?> <#> And the last chapter<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah exactly <&> laughter </&> and see <,> you know <,> what kind of <,> the kind of vocabulary <#> You 're working on expressive language isn't it<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Uhm <,,> I would look at the kind of vocabulary that 's <,> cropping up<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> So the vocabulary to watch out for<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah <{> <[> and can <,> do they </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[> And I suppose if there 's </[> </{> any examples of figurative language that I <{> <[> can <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> Absolutely </[> </{> yeah <,,> <#> Okay so it doesn't just have to be like English and <,> geography words or <{1> <[1> whatever </[1> you know <#> <.> Discu </.> I suppose having from today hopefully you have <,> discussed with them <,> you know <,> what are the kind of things that they find easy <#> Which things do they find difficult in terms of subjects <#> Are there <{2> <[2> any subjects </[2> in particular that they like <,> <#> And you could always kind of take a subject that they like and target the vocabulary <,> <{3> <[3> in that </[3> <{4> <[4> subject </[4> <#> Uh just one thing to do <,> or another thing to do with vocabulary as well is when you 're teaching it <,> if you 're going to give <#> Like giving a definition is really only one way of knowing a word <#> <{5> <[5> Okay </[5> <#> So and often then what happened last year was that if you went to the dictionary to define the word <,> the first definition in the dictionary <{6> <[6> wasn't </[6> necessarily the one that you had intended to teach <{7> <[7> <#> So </[7> just to watch out for that kind of thing <#> Uhm <,> and <,> so getting them to use the word in a sentence as well <,> it 's not enough to just be able to define it <{8> <[8> but </[8> can they use it <#> Uhm <,,> and just be clear as well yourself about the definition of the <{9> <[9> word </[9> like we talked about this morning in relation to the <{10> <[10> figurative language </[10><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[3> Okay </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[5> Yeah </[5> </{5><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[6> is wrong </[6> </{6><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[7> Yeah </[7> </{7><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[8> Yeah </[8> </{8><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[9> Yeah </[9> </{9><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[10> Mm </[10> </{10> to take a back seat<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah that we had different ideas as to what it meant<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Yeah okay<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Okay <,,> <#> So that 's vocabulary <#> Uhm <,> so there 's yeah Vanilla Vocabulary downstairs and the vocabulary with <,> what do they call it<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Vocabulary maps<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Vocabulary maps yeah <#> There is a programme as well <,> now I don't know if we have it any more <,> or maybe they have it in the school <,> called Inspiration <#> And it 's just it 's doing that kind of vocabulary mapping on a computer programme <#> <{> <[> <,> And </[> it 's very good cos you can organise<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> It 's on computer here is it<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> I don't <{> <[> think so </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[> I think </[> </{> Felice had the programme or something<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Yeah and you could get it for a trial <{> <[> period </[> or whatever <,> but then it <.> r </.> goes out <#> Uh like it self-destructs after however many days <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> What<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> Not really<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> That 's like <&> laughter </&> I thought you were <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> And this CD <{1> <[1> if you do </[1> survive it will self-destruct <&> laughter </&> <#> No it 's sort <{2> <[2> of it 's </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[1> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> dangerous </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[2> It 's all </[2> </{2> confidential <&> laughter </&> <#> You can only have it for a certain amount of time<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> No you yeah exactly you can only use if for <{1> <[1> thirty </[1> days or whatever <,> <#> Uhm <,,> okay the expressive language group then uh <,> that 's you isn't it <{2> <[2> Vera </[2> <,> <#> Okay so the figurative language <,,> uhm now uh <#> And again there is that book downstairs Saying One Thing Meaning <{3> <[3> Another </[3> <#> And there 's a I 'm sure there 's another one on figurative language down there as well <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> There 's one about <{> <[> cartoons </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$B> <#> <[> There </[> </{> is yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Is it <#> Yeah maybe that 's <{> <[> the one I 'm thinking </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$D> <#> <[> There 's a few </[> </{> <#> Yeah there 's other cartoons <{> <[> there </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> so there 's plenty of <{> <[> materials </[> <,> there like whatever<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> Should I be like <,> say <,,> like <,> say for my individual level like I want to be hitting like <,> say her reader and vocabulary <,> figurative language <,> and literacy <#> Should I be spending ten minutes in each of those four areas<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> That 's a <#> Yeah you can decide <{> <[> to do it like that </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[> Is that what I should be trying to do </[> </{> or should I be focusing on one <,> or two a week and<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Well I think I 'd like <#> I 'd leave that up to you to decide <#> See what you think is<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> Which is more efficient<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> Mm <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> Cos I don't want to totally boggle her either <{> <[> you know </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> exactly <#> So you don't want to have too much <#> I think it 's a good idea to actually specify how long you 're going to spend on each <{1> <[1> activity </[1> because then you have your session nicely structured and you know how much time you have <{2> <[2> cos </[2> uh <,,> the time <,> of course <,> is important as <{3> <[3> well </[3> <#> And I know today was different but that that you 're ready to <,> once we have the <,> room that you 're ready to start so that you know you 've ten minutes for this ten minutes for this <,> and you 're keeping an eye on the time and you know <,> okay I have to finish at twenty to twelve <,,> and then you 're ready to finish<ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-018$C> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3></I>
