<W2B-032 Computing><I><W2B-032$A><h> <bold> <#> Magee show BT voice and video link </bold> </h><h> <#> By Karl Gallagher, Northern Ireland manager, Digital </h><p> <#> A new type of telephone line looks set to bring Ulster businesses closer to European and world markets. </p><p> <#> The all-digital lines can carry video, data and voice, all at once. <#> It is now entirely possible to send a file to a customer in Germany, open the file on their computer and discuss its contents across a voice and video link, all from one telephone socket. </p><p> <#> The service is known as ISDN, Integrated Services Digital Network. <#> British Telecom has been supplying ISDN-like telephone links since 1987, but there have been compatibility problems when making calls to other countries. </p><p> <#> All that has been resolved and the new look service, named Euro-ISDN, was demonstrated simultaneously throughout 18 European countries and 50 cities, in December last year. </p><p> <#> Magee College in Derry was chosen as one of the six sites in the UK to show the ISDN phones lines off at the launch. </p><p> <#> Omega Design, a graphic design company based in Derry uses its recently installed ISDN connection to get closer to both its suppliers and its markets. <#> Omega uses reprographics resources and printers in Belfast, and used to send material by courier and train. </p><p> <#> Now it dials the supplier on the ISDN line and delivers and receives artwork instantaneously. <#> From Derry it also inspects and amends work in progress, in Belfast, using desktop conferencing software. </p><p> <#> Omega claims it is now able to tender and compete for work in France and Germany, where even last year they would not have thought it was viable. </p><p> <#> It is looking to servicing existing clients who have offices in Europe, and in the future to use video conferencing to take briefs from clients across the ISDN link. </p><p> <#> There are two types of ISDN line, one for individuals and small companies, known as Basic Rate Access, and one for large corporations, called Primary Rates Access. <#> British Telecom offer the Basic Rate Service as ISDN-30. </p><p> <#> Both are dial-up services. <#> ISDN-2 has two voice and data lines which can support voice, data and image both still and moving; ISDN-30 with 30 voice and data lines can offer refinements on this. </p><p> <#> Transparent to the customer, BT will support both its proprietary ISDN implementation and Euro-ISDN. <#> This is important for doing business with the other countries which have subscribed to the memorandum of understanding agreed between the European PTTs. </p><p> <#> In looking at ISDN, we should also look at the benefits of national and province-wide connection. <#> Many companies have isolated, local 'islands of computing' relying solely upon one of or two PCs. <#> These users would have an intermittent need to access central information. </p><p> <#> Using ISDN, and a product such as Pathworks, from Digital Equipment Corporation, these PCs may be integrated readily with central information bases. </p><p> <#> The benefit is low cost, high performance integration for such users - a solution which is impossible by other means. <#> This brings teleworking or working from home much closer. </p><p> <#> Another application which lends itself to an ISDN solution is video surveillance. <#> Organisations using video for security can cost effectively centralise management using ISDN. </p></I><I><W2B-032$B><h> <bold> <#> CD-ROM... The REVOLUTION is just beginning </bold> <h><h> <#> by Lynn Boyd </h><p> <#> A CD-ROM (compact disk read only memory) looks like a standard audio CD but instead of music holds information suitable for computer use. </p><p> <#> The main advantage of such a disk is that is capable of holding a much greater amount of information than the standard floppy disk. </p><p> <#> One CD-ROM can hold the equivalent of 500 3.5 inch floppy disks, 200,000 pages of text, or 72 minutes of video play. </p><p> <#> Such disks can be reproduced very cheaply. <#> Once you have your information encoded on CD-ROM, you can simply take your mastercopy CD to a company which will replicate it for about <*> pound sign </*> 1 per copy for large print-runs. </p><p> <#> Once written, the information on CD-ROM cannot be changed. <#> This makes it excellent for storing large amounts of archival material such as medical records, examination papers for universities and examining boards, or for storing inspection records for industry. </p><p> <#> CD-ROM is the standard format for music but it is also now becoming the standard format for other areas such as the ubiquitous computer game. </p><p> <#> This is because the disk can hold so much information, is cheap to produce and has a longer shelf-life than the equivalent information stored on vinyl. </p><p> <#> Many libraries, including those at Queen 's University, have CD-ROM facilities available, as do a growing number of secondary schools. </p><p> <#> It can be used for multi-media publishing, with interactive programmes using sound, graphics and digitised video animations. </p><p> <#> The information is constructed in such a way as to allow users to carry out text searches easily, requesting further information. </p><p> <#> So how widespread have the uses of this technological innovation become? <#> In 1992 there were some between six and seven million drives in use. </p><p> <#> This year the price has fallen dramatically, so that the average cost of a DC-ROM drive to be used in conjunction with a PC is now around <*> pound sign </*> 200. </p><p> <#> CD-I (Compact Disk-Interactive) is already widely used. <#> The system from which it operates looks like a CD player and hooks up to a TV like a VCR. </p><p> <#> As well as playing normal audio CDs, interactive multimedia CD-I offers high quality images, hi-fi sound and complete interactivity. </p><p> <#> This means children can watch a cartoon, recolour its character and even change the soundtrack and play back their own version. </p><p> <#> The CD-I device will soon become a means of receiving multimedia information and other services, such as interactive games, access to electronic databases, and even home shopping. </p><p> <#> In the foreseeable future you should be able to rent a video without visiting a video rental shop you 'll simply dial it up. </p><p> <#> You will be able to tune into almost any sports event being played anywhere in the world, perhaps even choosing the camera angle and controlling your own instant replays. </p><p> <#> You could have instant success to almost any home shopping catalogue (complete with mini commercials and product demonstrations). </p><p> <#> You might also wish to access information in libraries around the world or from financial services such as banking, investing or insurance. </p><p> <#> CD-ROM is also beginning to play an important role in the world of photography. <#> It is now possible to take slides to a commercial processor, and, for an extra fee, have them put on CD-ROM. </p><p> <#> With the addition of a small box to your TV or home PC you could then access them on screen. <#> It is also possible to produce photos from CD, but the technology is not widely available. </p><p> <#> A more immediately accessible use of CD-ROM can be identified for creative professional such as graphic designers. </p><p> <#> They can now store photographs on disk, which has obvious implications for saving storage space, particularly as this form of archiving is less prone to deterioration than storing film. </p><p> <#> With the arrival of CD recorders at about the same price as an average office photo-copier, it is possible to have a machine that produces CD-ROMs containing thousands of pages of information relevant to your own organisation. </p><p> <#> As the price of CD-ROM drives continues to fall, the day is not far off when every office will have one. <#> This will enable large volumes of reference and archival material to be accessed by other CD-ROM users. </p><p> <#> Among local companies which are currently using CD-ROMs is Textflow Services of Belfast, which is currently archiving QUB examination papers and encoding a publishing firm 's journals into CD-ROM. </p><p> <#> Dr Paul Mackey of Textflow said: <quote> "If all journals were encoded onto disk in this way, institutions such as libraries could then buy the journal on disk at the end of each year, thereby saving an enormous amount of library space." </quote> </p><p> <#> The full technological capabilities of CD-ROM are just beginning to emerge. </p><p> <#> Already CD-ROMs are being used to teach novice computer users the fundamentals of computer hardware and software, with the aid of graphics and animation. </p></I><I><W2B-032$C><h> <bold> <#> Grasping the essentials </bold> <h><h> <#> By Rodney Waite </h><h> <#> Carrickfergus Enterprise Agency </h><p> <#> Fifteen years ago the workplace was a less demanding place. <#> There was certainly technology and more manpower available than now to get the job done. </p><p> <#> Of course, you had to work hard, the range of skills required by the average employee must have been less than those required by today 's employer. </p><p> <#> Technology had its effect on most activities in the workplace. <#> Computer controlled machines on the shop floor are commonplace but perhaps the largest impact is now being experienced in the office. </p><p> <#> We have now all heard of word processing - many more are now familiar with terms such as computerised accounts, payroll, spreadsheets, and desk top publishing. </p><p> <#> These terms may be used in everyday conversation but how many would be happy to apply for a job that now demands even the most basic computer skills or expect you to handle a 'mouse' - not for the squeamish! </p><p> <#> Increasingly throughout the country, job descriptions are being changed and updated to include phrases like <quote> "must be RSA III word processing qualified"</quote> , <quote> "must be computer literate" </quote> , or <quote> "must have keyboard skills" </quote> . </p><p> <#> Many people returning to work are only acquainted with mechanical or at best electric typewriters, the latter of which looked like technology 's leading edge in the old days. </p><p> <#> How do you graduate from the 'steam' equipment to the slick, fast, accurate, versatile machinery in everyday use in business. </p><p> <#> Initially it looks like a difficult transition to make, now "user friendly training" (another new term) makes the experience not only useful but enjoyable as well. </p><p> <#> Throughout the province many existing training establishments have, over the past few years, set up new computer training facilities. </p><p> <#> Such is the demand created by employers that new specialised training companies are springing up every day. </p><p> <#> It is also true that some companies claim to train operators with a two day crash course CRASH being the operative word. </p><p> <#> Unless you are already very computer literate the two day courses on offer may not be your cup of tea! <#> Another possibility is to spread the training process, say three-hourly sessions with weekly intervals. <#> Remember, with computers, learning at your own speed is the road to success! </p><p> <#> If you need a computer literacy and information technology course or word processing, spreadsheets, accounts, payroll, or desktop publishing, you should find a good selection of training agencies to choose from in your area. </p><p> <#> It is not uncommon for schools as well as technical colleges to offer adult classes in computer skills. </p><p> <#> There are in most regions, community organisations that can help, and we must not forget the very specialised commercial training agencies. </p><p> <#> Cost of courses can vary and as competition for your custom is keener it pays to shop around. <#> A word of caution, make sure the training instructors are well qualified and recognised examination centres are also available. </p><p> <#> The man who said that <quote> "in years to come most garden sheds will have an abandoned computer gathering dust" </quote> is probably right! </p><p> <#> However, as sure as day follows night computers will spread into more and more business activities, and it follows that more and more employers will demand a workforce that is computer literate. </p></I><I><W2B-032$D><h> <#> Belfast firm in Irish Top Ten </h><p> <#> A Belfast computer company has been named as one of the top ten in Ireland by the Irish Computer magazine. </p><p> <#> Sybex Computing from <}> <-> Stanmillis </-> <+> Stranmillis </+> </}>, which has a turnover of around <*> pound sign </*> 4.5 m, was the only Northern Ireland company to be included in the list. </p><p> <#> The magazine noted that last year, Sybex had changed its profile from being a hardware sales organisation to one which specialised in consultancy and software. </p><p> <#> The company 's main emphasis now is on a workflow and document image processing system which Sybex calls BPI, for Business Process Improvement. </p><p> <#> Among recent contracts secured by Sybex were the provisions of systems for the Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland Electricity and Scottish Power. </p><p> <#> For the Department of Agriculture, the task was to install a computerised office automation system in the Agri-Food Development Service. </p><p> <#> At NIE 's Belfast office, Sybex developed an information system detailed underground electricity cables in the city. </p><p> <#> The system holds a database of 80,000 colour diagrams drawn from notebooks which date back to 1925, and which are constantly being updated. </p><p> <#> Engineers trying to trace a fault can call up the appropriate diagram, produce a colour print which they take with them to the scene, thereby speeding up the restoration of power. </p></I>
