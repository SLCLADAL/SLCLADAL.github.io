Kismayo <,> on the eve of the arrival of American troops in the country <#> And there are reports this morning that gunmen in Mogadishu killed five Somalis working for international relief agencies in two attacks <#> Aid officials said the killings yesterday and other shootings pointed to mounting tension in the capital before President Bush 's New Year visit to US troops later this week <#> The

Palestinians has been rejected by Lebanon <#> Israel offered to allow a Red Cross medical team to visit the deportees if Lebanon agreed to let through deliveries of food and water <#> But the Lebanese government argued that the group of Palestinians stranded in a no-man 's-land were in Israeli occupied territory and Israel should provide them with food and medical supplies <#> Official sources said President Hrawi told the UN envoy Mr James Jonah <,> that Lebanon was adamant that he couldn't pass through Lebanese lines to visit the deportees <#> Mr Jonah had travelled from Israel <,> to Beirut <,> <#> In Brazil Mr Fernando Collor has resigned as President <#> His resignation was announced shortly after the <.> s </.> uh senate opened a trial to vote on whether to impeach and remove him from his post on corruption charges <#> Mr Collor had been suspended from his post three months ago <,,> <#> Six soldiers from a British parachute regiment are expected to be charged later today in

between three and eight degrees <#> Remaining dry after dark with sharp ground frost developing where skies are clear <#> That 's it from me <#> Michael<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$A> <#> Thank you Emer <#> And later in the programme the formation of a new government <#> We ask who might be in and who might be out in a Labour Fianna Fa/il coalition <#> From Israel the latest on the stalemate over the <.> Panes </.> over the Palestinians in no man 's land <,> <#> Somalia <,> as some gunmen return to the streets of Mogadishu we hear from an aid worker on the increasing tension in the city <#> And in our schools why one economist believes that religion is losing out to the point system <#> Join us after the break<&> break in transcription </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-020$A> <#> Well back home again <,> the moves to form the next government are continuing today with the Labour Party negotiators consulting with their economic advisors <#> Tomorrow it 's face-to-face talks with Fianna Fa/il again <#> I 'm now joined by Stephen Collins political correspondent of the Sunday Press <#> Stephen how close are we to agreement at this stage<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$C> <#> Well I think we 're fairly close to agreement <#> I think a lot of talking still has to be done but I think there are basic agreement on principles anyway <#> And it 's a question of getting detailed work done uh this week on the budget <#> Next January 's budget is going to be a very difficult one to sort out <#> And the whole figures for nineteen ninety-three are not very good <#> So Labour and Fianna Fa/il are going to have to talk through the <.> wh </.> all the budgetary situation and then talk maybe about budgetary policy into the future <#> But once that is done I think then we 'll see a deed being wrapped up early next week or in the middle of next week<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$A> <#> Over recent days there has been much speculation about the position of Foreign Minister David Andrews <#> Is it on the cards that Labour will squeeze him out in favour maybe even of Dick Spring<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$C> <#> I think certainly Labour will be looking for a number of senior ministries <#> I think in their earlier talks with Fine Gael and the PDs Labour were insisting on getting a Taoiseach 's job in in rotating around <#> Uh with Fianna Fa/il I think they 've dropped the demand to be Taoiseach but I think they 're going to insist on getting some of the top portfolios in government <#> So I think uh the the impression now is that Labour will not be pressing for uh the Finance for the Department of Finance uh on the basis that a lot of top decisions have to be taken there and Fianna Fa/il want to hold on to that <#> So they 'll want to get other senior ministries instead and Foreign Affairs is one of the ones they 've targeted <#> I think Labour certainly are saying they 'll want <,> an a major economic ministry and <.> th </.> there 's going to be new Department of Employment and Enterprise come out of these talks <#> I think Labour will want that <#> Uh they 'll probably want to get the Environment as well <,> and maybe Dick Spring then maybe Foreign Affairs or Justice <#> I 'm I think it 's not all signed or sealed on that level <{> <[> yet but <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S2B-020$A> <#> <[> But if they did get </[> </{> Foreign Affairs what would be the reaction of Fianna Fa/il <#> What would be the reaction of either of David Andrews himself to that<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$C> <#> Well I think at the end of the day David Andrews like any other politician will accept uh <.> th </.> the <.> ch </.> choices made by his own leader <#> He will serve in government I think wherever uh his Taoiseach decides to <,> send him <#> Naturally I <.> th </.> he would like to stay on in Foreign Affairs <#> He has uh a very high public profile <#> He 's got a lot of plaudits for the work he 's done there <#> And it would be quite understandable that he 'd want to remain in Foreign Affairs <#> And I think both Mr Andrews and Fianna Fa/il will try and and hold on to the post <#> However I think at the end of the day <,> it 's going to come down to a decision between Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring <#> Uh the issue of posts is not part of the negotiations between the two sets of negotiating teams <#> Uh they they 're a matter for uh Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring <#> They 've had some informal discussions about the I the the posts and where they might go but nothing has been uh announced yet <#> <{> <[> And I think it </[><ICE-IRE:S2B-020$A> <#> <[> So what about </[> </{> the other traditional non-Labour portfolios Justice and Agriculture<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$C> <#> Yeah well I don't think Agriculture would really uh <.> w </.> will go to Labour <#> I don't think Fianna Fa/il would be willing to concede Agriculture to Labour and I don't think it 'd be one of Labour 's priorities <#> Uhm I think if Labour if they got the <.> decis </.> uh the Department of Employment if the Environment was also available and if they got Justice or Foreign Affairs <#> I 'm not sure that they will get both <#> They would look for one or the other <#> I think Agriculture will be left to Fianna Fa/il <#> Uhm <.> F </.> Fianna Fa/il is <.> f </.> the farmers uh <.> pa </.> party which farmers vote for in in big numbers <#> Labour would be a party who who wouldn't have the confidence of great great <.> ma </.> many farmers in the country<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$A> <#> So to continue with the speculation at this stage on the Fianna Fa/il side <,> who are the likely casualties <,><ICE-IRE:S2B-020$C> <#> Well the Albert Reynolds does have the advantage that he has four positions vacant because the two PDs left government <,> and he 's got Padraig Flynn going to the EC Commission <#> Uh so he who 's going to be dropped <,> <#> Uh <,> most of the speculation centres around John O'Connell <,> uhm <,> who indicated a certain amount of frustration with his role in the Department of Health and frustration with the way the Department of Finance treated the <.> oth </.> the other departments in his post-election comments <#> And then it 'd be it it seems to be a toss up but uh Seamus Brennan or Michael Woods are the names most often mentioned the two Dublin Ministers <#> Uh <,> Fianna Fa/il wouldn't want to run down the number of ministers in Dublin too much but they have other uh <.> o </.> other ministers in the city and neither of those two would be particularly close to Albert Reynolds <#> So I <.> th </.> think they 'll they 're the possible casualties<ICE-IRE:S2B-020$A> <#> And on the Labour side who might be getting the Mercs</I>
