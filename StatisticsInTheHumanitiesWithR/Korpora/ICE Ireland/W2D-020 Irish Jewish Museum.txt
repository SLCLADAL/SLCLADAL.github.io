<W2D-020 Irish Jewish Museum><I><W2D-020$A><h> <#> EDITORIAL </h><p> <#> This was the first bulletin to be produced by the team working on the FAS/Irish Jewish Museum project. <#> By issuing the bulletin we hope to keep you in the community aware of the work we are doing here and to encourage anyone who wishes to become involved at the museum. </p><p> <#> The project, which has been running since July 23rd, has two basic aims. <#> The first is to produce a usable catalogue of all the material stored in the museum. <#> As a part of this we hope to run occasional exhibitions on aspects of the museum. <#> The first such will highlight the paintings and portraits on display here. </p><p> <#> The second aim the project has is to research the history of Jewish settlement in Ireland. <#> We expect to be concentrating on the settlement in and around Dublin and to this end we hope that the work will involve interviews with members of the Jewish Community. </p><p> <#> The course is expected to last at least twelve months. <#> The trainees working on the project will be taught many research skills including Word Processing and report writing. <#> It is hoped also that the trainees will acquire basic preservation and restoration skills. </p><p> <#> Another aspect of the course will involve the trainees being taught French as it is actually spoken rather than by grammatical means. <#> (The aim would not be to produce fluent French speakers, but to give the trainees basic conversational skills). </p><p> <#> Any help that any individual member of the community can give us in our work would be gratefully received. </p><p> <#> Participants in the Irish Jewish museum project are;<#> Co-Ordinator; Eoin Duffy. <#> Assistant Co-Ordinators; Marie Christine Gallonnier and Rosemary Horan. </p><p> <#> Research Assistants; James Corrigan, Raymond Farrell, Ross Hackett, Niamh Hayden, Gerard Lysaght, Ronan Mac Aongusa, Mary T. Murphy, Susan Nolan, Francis O'Doherty, Deborah Paget, Damien Walker. </p><p> <#> Eoin Duffy </p></I><I><W2D-020$B><h> <#> EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS FROM THE MUSEUM COLLECTION </h><p> <#> An exhibition of paintings is being organised from the collection in the museum. <#> Featuring in it will be works by Harry Kernoff and Estella Solomons. <#> These include oil paintings, pastels, pencil drawings and prints. <#> Both artists were well known in their time for recording everyday scenes of Dublin life, some of which have been used as illustrations in publications. </p><p> <#> A lot of preparation is being put into organising this exhibition, with research being carried out in the National Library and the National Gallery. <#> Accompanying it will be a leaflet, giving a brief outline on the lives of the artists and also a short note on the works exhibited. </p><p> <#> This is the first of many public events to be held in the museum during the coming months. <#> It will also give visitors an opportunity to view the other exhibits in the museum. </p><p> <#> Further details on the exhibition will be posted out to the community in advance. <#> All are welcome! <#> Susan Nolan </p></I><I><W2D-020$C><h> <#> THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE MUSEUM ARTIFACTS </h><p> <#> As many of you may already know, we are computerising the artifacts and archives of the museum. <#> As there is limited storage space on the premises, it was decided that it would be impractical to hold paper records. <#> Therefore all data is being stored on the computer 's hard disk and is backed up on floppy disks. </p><p> <#> Thanks to the Co-Ordinator of the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot FAS project, Brendan Teeling, we have a Data Base III plus programme which has been customised for our particular purposes. </p><p> <#> Due to having some past experience, the computing has become a major element of my work at the museum. <#> Currently we are inputting entries for each item in the Synagogue section of the museum, a task which is nearing completion. <#> The speed at which we are progressing is entirely due to the "user friendly" nature of the DBase programme. </p><p> <#> When all the records have been stored in the computer 's memory, it will be necessary to devise a programme which allows the information to be readily accessible to anyone wishing to use it. <#> This will involve the creation of standard "search headings". <#> By this I mean that all information relating to common topics will be stored under the same heading. <#> This will ensure that the data will be in the most accessible form possible. </p><p> <#> In the long term, the records will be available for the purpose of serious research, and above all there will be a working catalogue of the contents of the museum available to all. <#> This will help to ensure that a permanent record of the Irish Jewish Community will be retained for future generations. </p><p> <#> If anyone is particularly interested in this aspect of the project, call to the museum where I would be more than willing to arrange a time to give a demonstration. <#> Rosemary Horan </p></I><I><W2D-020$D><h> <#> <&French> FRAN&5CAIS <&/French> </h><p> <#> The French module is an important part of the project. <#> Its objective is that the trainees become used to hearing and to speaking a foreign language. <#> This will become more and more useful, as we are on the brink of 1992. <#> Also a good knowledge of French will give the trainees and added advantage in the job market. </p><p> <#> For that reason, the ability to speak the language is more important than being able to read or write it. <#> In most cases, the trainees already had the grammatical approach at school, while the oral one was neglected, so books are used as little as possible, while conversation is the main aim. <#> The Alliance Fran&5caise runs several types of activities, of which the most interesting to the trainees are the films shows. <#> These movies are in French and un-subtitled. <#> This exercise is excellent in that it helps the trainees to become accustomed to the new language. </p><p> <#> The second objective of this module is to produce the Irish Jewish Museum catalogue in bilingual form. <#> Currently we are planning an exhibition, centred on H. Kernoff and E. Solomons. <#> All the text concerning the exhibition has already been translated into French by the trainees and put in the computer. </p><p> <#> Contacts have been established with the new Jewish Museum which is going to be opened in Paris in 1992. <#> The Irish Jewish Museum will sent it the different catalogue, booklets and brochures which we will produce in French. <#> Maybe an exchange of items, for exhibitions for instance, could be organised? <#> Marie Christine Galonnier </p></I><I><W2D-020$E><h> <#> TALKS GIVEN BY THE JEWISH COMMUNITY </h><p> <#> Since our project began our knowledge of the Jewish way of life has greatly increased due to various members of the Jewish community coming into the museum to give us talks. </p><p> <#> Raphael Siev introduced us to the museum with a discussion on the history of the Synagogue in Walworth Road, which helped a great deal as it gave us an insight into when and where the artefacts came from the gave us a background and history to the objects we are cataloguing. </p><p> <#> From the kitchen in the museum, Mrs. Joan Lynn explained some of the different elements of Jewish family life to us. <#> The different parental roles and the importance of the Dietary Laws. </p><p> <#> A general outline of Jewish settlement in Ireland was given by Asher Benson and Mrs. Marilyn Taylor spoke on many different aspects of Judaism. </p><p> <#> From talks about the Jews and the Jewish way of life, Friday afternoons developed into other areas concerning Irish life. <#> How Focus Point and The Simon Community opened our eyes to homelessness in Ireland, and how these organisations have grown over the years. </p><p> <#> We would appreciate any input from members of the community and maintain all contacts we have made so far. <#> Niamh Hayden </p></I><I><W2D-020$F><W2D-020$G><h> <#> LIMERICK 1904 </h><p> <#> On joining the Irish Jewish Museum project, we were particularly involved in researching Jewish settlement in Limerick. <#> In the course of the research, we investigated the growth of the Jewish population in Limerick and the events which occurred there during 1904. <#> This, of course, involved investigating the infamous sermons preached by Redemptorist priest Rev. Fr. John Creagh, his motives for preaching those sermons and the reactions of various members of the community to them and their consequences, particularly the economic boycott of the Jewish community which resulted. </p><p> <#> Interest in the events which occurred in Limerick was still evident in 1984 when The Irish Times became the forum for a series of letters contributed by different <}> <-> corespondents, </-> <+> correspondents, </+> </}> including Mr Jim Kemmy, Mr Pat Kelly, Mr. Manus O'Riordan, researcher with the I.T.G.W.U. and Fr. Michael Baily, a Redemptorist priest. </p><p> <#> While Fr. Baily was at pains to justify Fr. Creagh 's outbursts, denouncing Rabbi Elias Bere Levin as a master of public relations, the other contributors all disagreed with claims by Creagh apologists that the priest was only acting in defence of the poor, illiterate members of the Limerick population. <#> Indeed, several writers pointed out that the speed at which the Jewish community disintegrated with the onset of the economic boycott was the ultimate refutation of Creagh 's position and his accusation that the Limerick Jews were "moneylenders". <#> It has also been suggested that Fr. Creagh 's motives had less to do with his desire to protect the population of Limerick from "Jewish moneylenders" and more to do with the survival of his co-operative bank which was in the process of being established. </p><p> <#> The interest in the events of 1904 lies in the fact that it was the only popular demonstration of anti-semitism ever to take place in Ireland. <#> It succeeded in destroying Limerick 's tiny Jewish community. <#> Ironically though it led to the downfall of the man who instigated the whole sorry story. <#> Shortly after the "pogrom", Fr. Creagh was disowned by the Catholic hierarchy, who had remained silent throughout the crisis. <#> He left for Australia to work with the pearl fishermen there. <#> Francis O'Doherty <*> ampersand sign </*> Gerard Lysaght </p></I><I><W2D-020$H><h> <#> <&Hebrew> CHADASHOT <&/Hebrew> </h><p> <#> <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> began publication in 1963 boasting to be <quote> "Dublin 's only Jewish weekly". </quote> <#> It was entirely written and published by the young, but served the community as a whole. <#> Over the years it had to compete with other Jewish magazines but more of these were short-lived while <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> remained constant. </p><p> <#> The aims of <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> were to inform on up-coming events, report on past events, but most of all to give an editorial on community topics. <#> This often got them into trouble. <#> The editorial was often of a serious nature, so to compensate, the remainder of the magazine was generally written with a light-hearted air. <#> There was a sports column giving details of results and matches at Maccabi. <#> It also served the community by announcing births, deaths, wedding, engagements, etc. and in general kept its <}> <-> redership </-> <+> readership </+> </}> up to date. </p><p> <#> Even though it claimed to be a "weekly" magazine it would sometimes be delayed a couple of weeks due to insufficient funds or staff shortages. <#> On a few occasions it had to become a monthly or fortnightly. </p><p> <#> <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> was looked on with furrowed brows by elders and prominent members of the community for its <}> <-> irreverant </-> <+> irreverent </+> </}> and often controversial stance on important topics. <#> It often had to print apologies but overall it maintained the support of most of the community. </p><p> <#> It received many "angry" letters over the years, but just as many expressed gratitude for dealing with topics which needed airing. </p><p> <#> <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> stopped publication in the early 1970s' due to the editorial staff (who were voluntary) going on to do other things. <#> In its seven years of existence it produced interest and enthusiasm never since re-created. <#> It is true to say that it is missed. <#> Ross Hackett </p></I><I><W2D-020$I><h> <#> MAN CAN NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE </h><h> <#> (Or the importance of the apple danish in the lives of FAS trainees) </h><p> <#> Whilst cataloguing some of the archival material in the museum I came across an article on one Morgan Hackett and his Bretzel bakery situated just around the corner from us in Lennox Street. <#> The heading caught my eye for one of two reasons, one because it involved food and two because it said that <quote> "Ireland leads the way with Kosher pizza". </quote> <#> What, I wondered, was special about a Kosher pizza. </p><p> <#> I 'm not quite sure who was the first of our merry little bunch to actually venture down Lennox Street, I think it may have been Frank with his weakness for doughnuts, but that was it. <#> WE were hooked. <#> Thereafter, everyday at 11 o'clock sharp one of us would take orders and undertake the pilgrimage down to the Bretzel so as to feed our compatriots. </p><p> <#> This is not only an important stop-off for FAS trainees but also an important focal point for the whole of the Dublin-Jewish community. <#> Mr. Hackett inherited the bakery from his father Christie who as an assistant to a Kosher baker learned the skill first and the religious significance of his work later. <#> He passed on his skill to Morgan who is now one of the most popular bakers in Dublin 's inner city. </p><p> <#> Morgan is also a very popular man at times of weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and other events and one of his favourite orders for such occasions is his St. <}> <-> Honeres </-> <+> Honore 's </+> </}> Gateau. <#> St. Honore is the patron saint of bakers and with Morgan being a devout Catholic it seems an appropriate name. </p><p> <#> The shop itself has become a meeting place on Sunday mornings for long standing customers and members of the community. <#> They meet there for a chat and to buy their favourite pastries and breads. <#> Working on this course has opened my eyes to the cultural elements of the Jewish religion but my favourite bit so far was my introduction to the Kosher apple danish. <#> Ray Farrell </p></I>
