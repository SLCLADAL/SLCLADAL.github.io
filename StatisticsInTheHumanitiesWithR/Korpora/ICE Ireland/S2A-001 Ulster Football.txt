<ICE-IRE:S2A-001 Ulster Football><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> All good teachers Jerome accept a a note from parents <#> Referee today is Eugene Murtagh from Longford <.> wh </.> who refereed the All-Ireland Junior Football Final of two thousand and one between Kerry and Roscommon and also a Fermanagh Donegal game two years ago <#> So the last piece of the jigsaw 's underway <#> It 's Monaghan in the blue and white who are playing from left to right <,> slightly favoured by the wind <,> with their captain Dermot Duffy <#> Tried to pick up that poor pass <,> ball looked as if it was touching the ground <#> This could be an early opportunity for the men of Monaghan against the Down side which contains six of the players who brought the All-Ireland minor title to the county in nineteen ninety-nine<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> I didn't know Jerome cared Jimmy <#> But anyway <,> this is not the place to foul against Monaghan <#> Paul Finlay 's left foot recorded I think it was eight or nine scores in Clones <,> he could start off in the same vein here<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> That 's exactly what he does <,> exactly thirty-nine seconds on the clock <#> Paul Finlay <,> son of Ciaran Finlay <,> a former Monaghan legend <,> but a star in his own right<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> A few bits and pieces of changes as well on the Monaghan team <#> Michael Slowey 's out at centre half forward and the two Freeman brothers are now playing on either side of Raymond Ronaghan on the full forward line <,,><ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> The Armagh defence learns to its cost just how deadly young Finlay could be from a played ball <#> We 'll see if Paddy O'Rourke and the Down boys have learnt from that <#> Down coming into this game had the poorest championship record of of any Down team <#> It 's four years since they won a a match <#> That was in nineteen ninety-nine in the semi-final against Tyrone but here 's one man intent on making sure that that record is put to rest <#> That 's the number twelve <,> Colm McCrickard from Leitrim Fontenoy <,> he 's a nephew of the famous Joe McCrickard <,> and he 's the one who brings them level after almost two minutes <,> <#> Immediately Jason Hughes got that ball he was closed down <#> Quickly taken free <,> spread across the middle to the full forward Raymond Ronaghan who has come from the edge of the square <#> Feeds it back to the Castleblayney player and captain Dermot Duffy back to Ronaghan again <#> Where Ronaghan goes <,> so does Brendan Burns <,> or Brian Burns I should say <#> And now it 's Paul Finlay with the left foot again <,> from free kick or from play <,> the man from Ballybay <#> Three years a minor <,> two years an under twenty-one <,> and he 's got two points <#> Monaghan have two <,> Down have one <,> <#> An excellent jump and punch by Gregory McCartan <,> head into the path of Walsh <,> Walsh faced by Padraig McKenna <,> blocked by McKenna <,> and loses again <#> So it 's a side-line for Down <,> <#> Liam Doyle <,> with that left foot <,> drives it in towards the square <#> Murphy kept his eye on it all the way and fed it out to Nicholas Corrigan <#> The half forward-back in his half-back line <#> That 's a cross field ball <,> there are three Down men there and the one to come away with it is Liam Doyle <#> He took that side-line ball a second ago <#> Dan Gordon <,> Loughinisland man <,> holds it up <,> turns <,> heaves it back to McCartan <,> McCartan with a languid left foot <#> That 's an excellent strike <#> Gregory McCartan from Castlewellan<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> And he again the long ball in Jimmy to Dan Gordon working well <#> He ignored Ben Coulter going through the middle <,> gave it to McCartan <,> and McCartan has finally found the range<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Nicely into the hands of Martin Cole as the sun comes out in Casement Park <#> Walsh <,> off his man <,> nice-angled ball <,> bravely up for it <,> and is caught <#> That was Martin Cole going through <#> He didn't take his eye off the ball and just got his hand to it and was caught on the way down<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> I don't think there was anything intentional there Jimmy <#> Just as the ball came across it was uh Michael Walsh picking him out <,> both players going for the ball <,> obviously Micky Cole was in a better position and he got a slap on the face <,,><ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Nice kick again <#> Liam Doyle kicks it over <,> puts Down into the lead <#> And that 'll please his Uncle Pat and all the other Leitrim Fontenoy supporters who are watching this match at home <,> <#> Another huge kick by Glenn Murphy but an even more impressive catch <#> McCartan was there <,> and such was the drive and determination of McCartan that he managed to engineer a free out of that <#> That time the kick was with the right foot <,> Down 's Michael Walsh <#> Walsh holds it up <,> feeds it inside but <,> poor pass collected by Owen Lennon <#> Monaghan moving out from the back <#> Damien Freeman <,> now it 's picked up by Corrigan <#> Four Down men were around him <#> Brian Burns was there <,> all over the Monaghan forward <#> And we 've a free for Monaghan <#> So Monaghan 's ploy of just playing the two men inside is certainly having its moments as well<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Yes and as you <,> it was he was in there on his own <#> They 're switching in and out Jimmy <#> Raymond Ronaghan is in there with uh Damien Freeman from time to time <#> Damien Freeman then is taking a run out and Thomas is going in <,> and it 's causing it 's causing problems for the Down defenders <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> All eyes on Paul Finlay <#> And as usual <,> the man from Ballybay doesn't disappoint <#> Three points for Paul Finlay <,> three for Monaghan and three for Down<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Yes <#> Sweet strike <,> perfect position for him<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Michael McVeigh <,> surveys the wide open space of Casement Park <,> drives it in under the stand <#> Back come Monaghan again <#> Good work by the corner back <,> John Clarke <,> one of six of the All-Ireland Minor Team <#> And here 's the man who captained them that day <#> That was Liam Doyle <,> driven in by the captain Sean Ward but allowed to run through <#> Collected by Glenn Murphy <#> Fed out to Owen Lennon <#> Away comes Lennon <#> And now it 's the man wearing the substitute 's jersey <,> Anthony Rooney <,> who would come in for the A N Other <#> He 's moving all on his own <#> Does he want to shoot <#> He certainly does <#> Does he score <#> The umpires say that he does <#> Michael McVeigh said it was a wide <#> But that was an inspirational score <#> Remember that started as a shot at the far end <#> He picked it up from his midfielder and he had only one thought on his mind<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Heads out to field in the middle of the park for his club Clontibert <#> This was a tremendous run <#> Uhm <,> we 're looking at this almost in line with the shot <#> And I wasn't as sure as the umpire is that it was over Jimmy <,> but uh as you say <,> it certainly deserved a score<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Paul Finlay <#> Takes the quick one <#> Into Ronaghan and he seemed to be surprised by it <#> But Finlay again <,> toe-taps with the left <,> shoots with the right <#> Men hang down below <#> Brilliant catch by Nicholas Corrigan <#> Gets it <,> holds it <#> Now needs a little bit of help <#> A little bit of footballing skills on the ground from Michael Slowey <#> The Clones player dummies <#> And again <#> Now pursuing him is Alan Molloy <#> He switches onto the left foot <#> That 's a brilliant score <#> That score was all about guts and determination <,> and none showed it better than Michael Slowey who came back from a very serious back injury<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> It was a great combination of persistence and skill <#> There 's a solo dummy <,> dummy inside with a bounce <#> I thought he was going to get caught here <#> But no he stepped back inside onto his less-favoured left foot and had the confidence to knock it over <#> There 's a couple of great scores for Monaghan in a row <#> They play with great confidence Jimmy <,> working harder in the middle third of the field <,> a lot of breaking ball out there <#> And they 're winning probably the the majority of them at the minute as they did against Armagh<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Yes now whether <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> they 're prepared to dive in after them <#> Paul Finlay out <#> There 's a young man certainly on top of his game <#> Nice transfer inside <#> Hooked over the shoulder <#> Over the bar it goes <#> He shakes the hand of the man who passed the ball to him <#> Excellent score<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Again <,> sorry Jimmy <,> again Finlay involved <,> uh but it was Thomas Freeman that finished it but a great ball in <,> one in the middle of the field <,> a great ball played into the corner in the space <#> Finlay made great work of it <,> and it was a great finish by Freeman from a tight angle <#> Monaghan are on a roll now<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Twenty-two minutes gone in this first half <#> Alan Molloy <,> plenty of time on the ball for a change <,> kicks it high up towards Dan Gordon <,> the ploy which worked so well in the early stages <#> Back to Walsh again and now it 's Gordon <#> Holds it up <,> feeds it off intelligently to the man on the run <#> That 's his midfielder and the big number nine <,> Gregory McCartan <,> in fact it 's Sean Ward <,> the other midfielder who gets it <#> It was the right foot that was the clue in that instance<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Right a great burst through the middle and in fairness Down needed that Jimmy <#> They 'd fallen behind to four consecutive uhm <,> five consecutive Monaghan points <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Glenn Murphy certainly not getting the distance that Michael McVeigh is getting <#> Broken down by Coulter into the path of Martin Cole <#> Cole <,> fed it over the head of Coulter but it was always going to be a defender 's ball <#> Owen Lennon as Nicholas Corrigan <,> a man who has <,> even at this early stage has covered almost every blade of the Casement Park grass <#> Feeds it into Thomas Freeman <,> scorer of one point <,> gives it into Ronaghan <#> Ronaghan holds it up <,> almost too long one would have thought and now the man of the moment Finlay who 's faced by Alan Molloy <,> shrugs him off <#> Now that 's a narrow angle for anybody but not for Paul Finlay <#> What a brilliant score by Finlay <#> It 's no wonder he danced his way out <#> Played the ball up <,> did everything right and I 'm sure Molloy thought <,> like all the rest of us <,> he couldn't score from here<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Yes Down have changed Alan Molloy onto him to try to counter his height <,> his fielding <,> uh but obviously there <,> the best score so far out of his six <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> A huge jump again by McCartan <#> Down <,> get the break <,> come away with the ball <#> Nice ball into the path of Coulter <#> Coulter holds it <#> But once again Monaghan 's resolve however <,> that was Freeman loses out <#> Dan Gordon <,> the quick flick inside <,> goes to Michael Walsh <#> Walsh <,> to the man all on his own and that man is Liam Doyle <#> So while Down have their left-footed ace in Paul Finlay <,> Liam Doyle with his three points <,> that 's his first from play <,> it proving to be the ace in the Down attack<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Down people dream about this sort of attacks Jimmy from the class of ninety-nine <,> these minors <#> Lovely laid-off ball by uh the full forward to Michael Walsh <,> to Liam Doyle going by him <,> and a good finish<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> Rory Woods is the man who 's come on <#> Players tossing off the ball <,> and there 's a free and I think it 's to Down <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Yes Down worked that fairly well Jimmy <#> From a free kick in the middle of the field in a non-scoring position <,> they now find themselves uh with Liam Doyle with a good chance of scoring <#> And it wasn't a free that Monaghan needed to give away<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$A> <#> A minute and twenty seconds into injury time <#> Liam Doyle floats over his fourth point of the afternoon <#> It 's Down 's seventh <#> And Down needed that<ICE-IRE:S2A-001$B> <#> Yes another good effort and it literally <,> the ball 's not going to be kicked out <#> It was on the blow and it brings the <,> the difference to just two points</I>
