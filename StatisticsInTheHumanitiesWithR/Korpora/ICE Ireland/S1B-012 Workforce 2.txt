<ICE-IRE:S1B-012 Workforce 2><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-012$A> <#> Thirdly <,> it identifies the human resource department as a source of expert knowledge in the firm <,,> <#> There is <,,> now somebody on board who can tell us about <,> how we 're planning and what we 're doing <#> Who is somebody <,> who can do succession planning who can use the computer models that exist and so on <,> which you 've become <.> ac </.> acquainted with depending on the <,> HR department you join <,> should you pursue that career <,,> <#> Cathy Monks <,> mentioned Sean Tyson here <,> four weeks ago she was here <#> And Sean Tyson has three models of the human resource function <#> One is the clerk of works <,> starting with at the bottom <,> where the clerk is given the plans and has a very rudimentary elementary <,> plan interpretation role <#> Followed by the engineer <,> <&> writing on board </&> who has more of a discretionary role <,,> in interpreting plans <,,> <#> And finally the architect mode <,> according to Tyson <,> who would be <,> if you like <,> the most <,> strategic type of role <,> to use a building or construction analogy <,> given that architects work with blank sheets of paper and somebody 's idea of how the school <,> prison <,> university <,> factory should look <#> In other words Tyson says that in being given the importance of strategic decision-making <&> writing on board </&> and the different levels of strategic <.> decis </.> decision-making that exist <,> in any organisation <,> depending on how involved the human resources person is <,> determines <,> their influence in the organisation <,> and the mode of operation they 're capable of <#> So many Irish organisations <,> clearly do not have architects in their HR function <,> do not have somebody who can lay the organisation out in front of them as a series of blueprints or charts and say how would we like this organisation to look <,> to design elements of the organisation <,> to develop and grow people through HR strategies <#> They are the more likely instead to have the plan decided <,> at a higher level than HR then given to the HR person to implement <#> It 's like the building site which this building has been part of <,> for perhaps too long <#> In other words <,> the engineer wasn't involved necessarily in the design of the building but he <,> takes some critical decisions in the course of its building <#> The clerk of works is a more lowly person again <,> who may reports to the engineer and is responsible for <,> one small section of the wall going up straight or something <,> or for the materials arriving on time <,> Ormond brick from Kilkenny or whoever <,> that they arrived <,> that they sent in the four thousand bricks that they said they would they were all brown they weren't cracked <,> or whatever <#> As you can see very <,> uh low level in terms of its strategic nature <#> And that I think is a useful model <#> That 's what Cathy Monks was referring to when she was here from DCU four or five weeks ago <#> Anyhow the <,> more complicated <,> the more complex the workforce planning operation then the more it fits with the architect mode of operation <,,> <#> Fifthly there is the notion that <,> in some way if we plan for our work force we are engaged in change management <#> Cos why would we plan if we didn't need some change to happen or we <.> didn </.> we didn't expect some change <#> Contentious point maybe <,,> <#> Sixth <,> there is this very tiny quote which you can't see so I 'll call it out <,,> <#> This is from Gunnigle and Flood nineteen <,> ninety <,> if you want to write that down Gunnigle and Flood G U double-N I G L E <,> G U N N I G L E Gunnigle and Flood <,> Paddy Gunnigle and Patrick Flood <,> and they say that effective manpower planning <,> as you can guess why I 've called it workforce planning <#> Effective manpower planning in their terms is a prerequisite <,,> in their opinion to the successful execution of related personnel activities <,,> <#> In other words there 's a whole set of activities undertaken by the personnel function <,> which this <,,> operation this <,> function <,> workforce planning precedes <#> And unless you have some clear plan as to where you 're going <,> then what you are likely to find in your functional personnel activity is a lot of activity <,> not really knowing its mm mm from its elbow <#> And if we hadn't a tape I 'd have said arse for that <&> laughter </&> <,> you know what I mean <#> And you know what I mean <,> okay good do you have all that <#> That 's Gunnigle and Flood G U N N I G L E and Flood nineteen ninety <,,> <#> <&French> Excellent </&French> <#> Let us at this stage take uhm the next <,> show and tell <,> so that we can have different voices on the tape <#> If you 're interested in that we 're going to have some <,> and these are <.> stu </.> the next team up I I I I know are are chosen particularly <,> for their uh unique accentual variations <#> Who 's next <,,> <#> Here we go right <,,> <#> First up <,> let 's do it <,,> <&> class prepares </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-012$B> <#> Uhm our article is taken from Personnel Management and it 's called Managing Healthily <#> How an <.> NS </.> <,,> an NHS region is promoting change <#> The NHS in Britain is considered to be inefficient <,> top heavy <,> with administration grossly underfunded <,> and not serving the population all that well <#> On the other hand measures to introduce a modern management culture are viewed with suspicion <#> They are seen as wasteful and a diversion of <.> s </.> resources <,> which could be better spent directly on patient care <#> One of the problems with the NHS is that there is no neat link between general management and professional teams <,> ie the doctors <,> who 're actually responsible for seventy percent of the expenditure <,> within the hospital <#> The hospitals are hospitals are in need of an <,> cohesive workforce <,> all pulling in the same direction and now we 're going to explain the new management techniques that they <,> introduced to achieve this<ICE-IRE:S1B-012$C> <#> And the NHS has had to introduce uhm major strategic shifts to cope with uhm changes in the health system <#> And in the health system in Britain now there 's more concentration on long term patients <,> long term care for patients and also community care <,> so they 've had to change their modes of control and control to cope with this <#> And also they 're changing uhm <,> they 're changing the way uhm management is uhm <,> they 're changing the way management is introduced <#> Now they 're bringing in professionals into the management uhm roles rather than just administrative people <#> They 're bringing in nurses and doctors uhm who are passing on from their uhm jobs on the wards into the <.> a </.> more administrative roles <#> And they have planned uhm career paths to make this a structured uhm way into the <.> fo </.> they 're they 're making a formal bridge from the <,> role in the hospital to the administrative role<ICE-IRE:S1B-012$D> <#> Uhm basically the the national health service in England is in very bad shape just like the health service <,> in Ireland <#> That 's a bit of an understatement <#> Uhm <,> so they decided that they needed uh major strategic shifts uh because technology was what was driving change within the organisation <#> Uh because of technology they saw the role of the hospital you know narrowing <,> uh to the <.> s </.> to as Joanne said to now community care and very specialised services <#> So they felt that uhm as a result of this that the actual way that management is made up and namely of that of the <.> f </.> the four strategic components that of the buyers <,> the suppliers <,> and the professional people themselves <,> both private and and public sector hospitals that uhm <,> the they will have to encourage doctors uh and nurses to get involved in the managerial aspect of the hospital and in running it <#> So they decided that education was the best uh vehicle to to bring about this change <#> So they brought about an MBA programme in Durham University whereby each year they 're going to send a hundred uhm members of staff <,> of which fifty percent will be women <,> to do a two-year MBA programme <#> And hopefully they 're looking for these uh MBA people to be the catalysts for change <,> to bring about a new culture <,> uh which will encourage uh nurses and doctors to <,> you know be more <.> pro </.> proactive uh as regards strategy in the managerial level of the NHS service<ICE-IRE:S1B-012$E> <#> I 'm just going to fill you in on the MBA foundation programme <#> Uhm it looks at the knowledge and competence in the areas such as marketing <,> HR management and accounting <#> A series of electives provide the opportunity for students ' individual managerial interests to be followed <#> The programme also provides an opportunity for research into health aspects <#> However <,> by itself this MBA programme cannot bring about cultural change required by NHS <,> but it will bring modern manager skills <,> fresh thinking and innovation <#> It will challenge the system to produce a change <#> For the executive level management which lacks clear direction <,> they propose a school of excellence <,> where senior managers could rapidly develop the leadership skills required to effect the major changes in progress <#> Management in the health service has improved significantly with the implementation of this train of thought <,> but if it is to continue to be effective <,> it requires the NHS to develop a management structure with certain sufficient flexibility for the new purchasing managers to experiment and develop the provision of health care <,> in a way that satisfies the needs of particular communities<ICE-IRE:S1B-012$A> <#> Very good <#> Thank you <#> And you could call moving into the foyer at uh half two in the course of the ball at Jury 's a strategic shift <,> but that would be <,> <&> laughter </&> something for us <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> The issue of to as to whether or not a group of MBA students <,> or MBA graduates can come back into an organisation and produce strategic change is an interesting one <#> What might the reaction of people be to an MBA person who 's come back in <,,> <#> What 's a likely personal reaction <,,><&> simultaneous and unclear </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-012$A> <#> Exactly <#> Some kind of hostility <,> it 's what you 're trying to say <,> isn't it <#> Good <#> Uh the issue of what you know that makes you somewhat different or better to the rest of us <#> Why should you be the vehicle for change <#> You 're such a doodah anyway <,> type thing <#> Like the reaction you 're going to get when you join organisations perhaps as the first graduate to be taken on <#> Blarney Woollen Mills that successful group for instance took on its first graduate <,> four years ago <,> who had taken HR in her final year from Professor Walsh <,> who left after a year <,> because there was a lot of hostility to graduates in that organisation <,> just to mention one small case example <#> They 've since changed a little <#> As we know there was a lot of tension in that organisation <,> exemplified by the retirement of its or the resignation of its present or previous Chief Executive <,> the debate being whether or not they should move on this line of professional managers ie graduates <,> or not <#> Which was actually the decision <,> except that the person who walked in there as the first graduate didn't know that <#> She just thought this was great being hired <#> She was actually kind of the meat in the sandwich quite a lot <#> So that 's an interesting point as to whether or not these people can go away on an external exchange programme and come back in and be <,> the change agents <#> In other words should change start within <,,> and use these people as well <,> rather than rely completely on the MBA programme <,> to drive change <#> Interesting question and good example <#> Uh Maiden Airways do we have <,,> an opportunity <#> <&French> Merci </&French></I>
