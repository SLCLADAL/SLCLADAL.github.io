<W1A-015 Language purism><I><W1A-015$A><h> <quote> <#> 'language was made for man, not man for language' </quote> <sp> 1 </sp> </h><p> <#> There exists a prevalent misconception amongst the middle-aged that the world is going to the dogs. <#> A priomordial fallacy: a misbelief maintained from ancient Nestor reflecting forlornly on the glorious heroics of the past to John Major remembering the illusory Britain of old where patriotism and harmony still presided; there seems to be a patent injustice in the obsession of comparing the present with what has gone before. </p><p> <#> This is because the worry, however, is not only confined to the state of the world but also to the supposed decline of the English language; the demise of which has been bemoaned in the past by literators such as Swift and Dr Johnson. <#> Johnson claimed that English was <quote> 'resigned to the tyranny of time and fashion, and exposed to the corruptions of ignorance, and caprices of innovation' </quote> <sp> 2 </sp>; a pedagogic avowal which has worryingly found contemporary resonance in the words of Michael Dummett, a Professor of Philosophy at Oxford University. <#> In his latest polemic he hysterically remonstrates that the language is on the brink of anarchic degeneration and expounds a "conspiracy theory" of Kennedyesque proportions which lays the blame for this alleged malaise at the door of the whole educational establishment, accusing it of propagating a "descriptivist" doctrine from the highest echelons of academia right down to the teaching of primary school children. </p><p> <#> Now, it would be easy to dismiss these hypotheses as simply the rantings of a reactionary obsessive. <#> This is, after all, a man who by his own admission records all the grammatical <}> <+> ? </+> </}> he reads or hears. <#> But this is supposedly an eminent member of the linguistic intelligentsia, one of the literati; how can he fail to comprehend the inherent folly of letting nostalgia or social snobbery turn us into priggish purists? <#> Dummett discusses language construction as if the "rules" were engraved on one of the tablets that Moses brought down from Mount Sinai. <#> He has obviously yet to embrace the elementary concept that language needs to evolve and be open to change if it is to remain vibrant. <#> Language is not a monolithic entity which is sacrosanct and immune to innovation; language change is a universal characteristic of human behaviour. <#> As linguists Andersson and Trudgill cogently postulate, the English we speak today will probably not be recognisable to any English-speakers a thousand years from now.<sp> 3 </sp> <#> Language change is simply part of the human condition. </p><p> <#> Unable to establish a sensible symposium, therefore, our dear professor simply resorts to cheap sensationalism in a desperate attempt to stir up a moral panic. <#> His rhetoric becomes sated with alarmist phrases such as <quote> 'linguistic pollution' </quote> and <quote> 'linguistic immune systems' </quote> as if "bad" language is impregnating the system like some sort of inexorable plague. <#> What does this man propose? <quote> <#> "Linguistic cleansing?" </quote> <#> Who are he and his ilk to pronounce themselves judge and jury over what constitutes "good" language and what constitutes "bad" language? <#> As Andersson and Trudgill assert: <quote> 'Nothing is good or bad in itself. <#> It is bad only in the eyes of those who evaluate and look at the language.' </quote> <sp> 4 </sp> <#> Everybody should have the right to enrich their language and this is better achieved by presenting alternatives and possibilities than by giving restrictions and prohibitions. <#> Pronouncing judgement upon the merits or inadequacies of other uses of language can only be retrogressive at a time when all the signs indicate that the English language is flourishing. </p><p> <#> Such is the present climate that many native speakers of the English language are actually scared stiff about "making mistakes". <#> This is the generation where mercenary companies scurrilously exploit these anxieties with magnanimous promises of linguistic salvation. <quote> <#> 'Have you ever been let down by your English?' </quote> they ask. <quote> <#> 'Have you ever been ashamed of the way you speak?' </quote> <#> If you have, you can sleep easy in the knowledge that you can send away for their do-it-yourself guides to correct English. </p><p> <#> Is this really the path which Dummett and his cohorts want us to go down? <#> A Utopian Yellow Brick Road with the rhapsodic whimsy of linguistic transcendence at the end? <#> If so, it 's a fool 's paradise. <#> Contrary to Dummett 's protestations, native speakers for the most part do speak their native language perfectly. <#> True, we all make occasional errors from time to time, but this hardly necessitates the sort of cultural backlash that has been whipped up. <#> And if these faux pas become accepted as linguistic norms, so what? <#> Language use can never be frozen in a particular form. <#> As long as a language is used, as long as it lives, it will keep on changing. <#> So if 'creditable' does in time come to replace 'credible', why should we even attempt to resist the transition? <#> Linguistic changes are an inevitable and natural part of all human languages. <#> Those Canutes who attempt to stem the tide of change will inevitably find themselves brushed effortlessly aside. </p><p> <#> This is the axiomatic crux which lies at the heart of my contempt for Mr Dummett. <#> Here is a man who in his unswerving arrogance believes he can actually halt the irresistible linguistic tide. <#> When he harangues about the need for native speakers to resist these external forces on the language, his diatribe even has the alarming resonance of the invidious rhetoric espoused by <}> <-> jingoisic </-> <+> jingoistic </+> </}> nationalists. <#> What this man fails to comprehend is that the language "purifies" itself in the same sort of way that nature does. <#> As a dead body or other decaying matter does not last long in the wild, so redundant constructions do not last long in the language. <#> If, as Dummett grumbles, there is a lot of jargon around, it is there for a reason. </p><p> <#> My argument is simply that Dummett 's report of the death of the English language, like the report of Mark Twain 's death, is an exaggeration. <#> There may be profound changes afoot, but they are healthy, manageable, and on the whole beneficial. </p></I><I><W1A-015$B><h> <#> Response to <ul> The Campaign for Real Grammar. </ul> </h><h> <#> Purging the Purists </h><p> <it> <#> In last week 's edition of The Oldie, Michael Dummett, Professor of Philosophy at Oxford University, published a plea for a return to the old days of linguistic purity. <#> Arguing that the English of grammar books is in retreat, he believes that unless something is done to reverse this process, we are in danger of becoming straddled with a language that impedes communication rather than encourages it. </it> </p><p> <quote> <#> "Like everything else, even mountains, languages change. <#> Unlike mountains, languages are human artefacts; we, their speakers, therefore determine in which respects they change and in which they do not." </quote> </p><p> <#> So said the opening of last week 's article in which Michael Dummet argued that we <it> can </it> in fact stem the tide of linguistic change. <#> While some changes to language are inadvisable, Dummett argues that other variations are desirable. <#> He places great import on the misuse of the word <quote> "creditable" </quote> by an anonymous <quote> "eminent" </quote> person on <it> Channel 4 News, </it> claiming that this is a prime example of the way that our use of the English language is rapidly deteriorating. <#> Languages, he suggests, are finely tuned instruments and without rules to govern them they become useless as tools of communication, and therefore cannot survive. </p><p> <#> Of course, in the event of every English speaker on the planet suddenly heading off on a tangent and creating their own personal dialect, things would get a little difficult, however, linguistic change is a gradual thing, words and phrases don't just appear from nowhere, but enter our everyday speech in a variety of gradual ways. </p><p> <#> Dummett belongs to the letters page of <it> The Times, </it> where it seems that scores of pedants write in to complain about he likes of John Major 's recent misuse of <quote> "lay" </quote> for <quote> "lie" </quote>. <#> What these people seem to be incapable of comprehending is that language is a living breathing thing. <#> By its very nature language <it> needs </it> to grow and evolve, it is after all how language developed in the first place. <#> To attempt to stem the flow of linguistic change is to try to halt an ongoing process that dates back to the dawning of intelligent life on the planet. <#> Language is a thing that must be respected, some may argue that this is what Professor Dummett was saying in his article, however, it would only be correct to think of language in terms of being <it> our </it> master and not the other way about. </p><p> <#> Professor Dummett cites a letter to the <it> Independent </it> from a professor of cultural studies, who stated that in principle, it is impossible for a native language speaker to make a mistake: <quote> "language consists in whatever native speakers say." </quote> <#> Dummett refutes this by asking if this principle extends to young children and if so, at what age does a child become incapable of making a mistake? <#> Noted linguists L.G. Andersson and Peter Trudgill state that <quote> "children know the basics of the phonological, morphological and syntactic systems of language. <#> These are the central parts of the sound system and the grammar. <#> Other parts of the language take more times to learn, in particular vocabulary and pragmatics....we keep learning vocabulary and situation-specific language all through our lives." </quote> <#> We are all guilty of grammatical slip-ups and malapropisms, the sheer volume of talking that we "perform" everyday renders even the most eloquent and articulate speaker capable of occasional error. <#> Language is a spontaneous thing, there is very little time to prepare or construct the perfect grammar or vocabulary, when we speak, the sentence that comes out will depend on various factors and we will frequently stall for time with planning elements or fillers like <it> er, um, eh. </it> <#> These small particles of speech do not even exist in the written language, they have no meaning and do not add any dignity to the act of speech. <#> Professor Dummett might take note that it is men with an academic education that <it> er </it> the most, also making the hardest to interrupt, a skill he has perhaps himself used many times when arguing with linguists. </p><p> <#> Upon reading in last week 's article, that Dummett 's book on <quote> "correct" </quote> grammar had been <quote> "widely welcomed" </quote>, I would have to concede that this is not surprising at all, there is a growing number of people who welcome the idea of a return to Victorian values about <quote> "correct" </quote> language, no doubt accompanied by Victorian teaching methods as well, this conjuring up scenes picturing left-handed children with the offending arm tied behind their backs, to ensure that they write as well as speak in a correct manner. </p><p> <#> One point of concession that I would make is that children should be able to use a more formal method of speech when a situation requires it, but not at the expense of their own dialect and slang. <#> We all change our way of speaking according to what situation we find ourselves in, and it is imperative that this ability is not stamped our by an eventual triumph by one dialect, whether it be the Standard English of Professor Dummett or the various types of slang and dialect that he and his supporters so vehemently oppose. </p><p> <#> All language is a beautiful thing, the world would be less interesting if we all spoke the same way. <#> I suggest that Professor Dummett and his like should learn to tolerate if not appreciate the diverse forms of English language that are apparent in the society of today. <#> At the beginning of his article, Dummett states that the tide of linguistic change can be stopped, I would remind him of what happened to King Canute. </p></I>
