<W2B-012 Community - Policing><I><W2B-012$A><h> <bold> <#> Community charged </bold> </h><h> <bold> <#> Malachi O'Docherty </bold> </h><p> <#> Whenever I hear the word community, I smell a rat. <#> When I hear about a concerned community, I wonder about all the people who are dismissed as unconcerned. </p><p> <#> The arrogance of Julie Burchill in recently describing herself as <quote> 'an important member of the gay community' </quote> was transparent, but by what right was she traduced by other gays as less part of that 'community' than themselves? <#> Who decided that gays are a community? <#> Who decides that some gays properly belong to that community and some not? </p><p> <#> The answer perhaps lies in a notion of community as activity rather than as merely a collection of related people. <#> Not all gays know each other, but most, presumably, have shared interests; in their legal rights, in the provision of service, in modes of sexual enjoyment that spill over into fashion and music. </p><p> <#> The black community in parts of England is concerned to be seen as law abiding. <#> So when Paul Condon announces that most muggers are black and male, there is outrage, but there is also a rallying of 'community leaders' to the support of the police. <#> Bernie Grant says: <quote> "I call on people to co-operate with the police. <#> No one will make a fuss if the right people are arrested for the right reason". </quote> </p><p> <#> Kenan Malik, writing about this in <it> The Guardian </it> said community was the new buzz word whose values hide the new language of racism. </p><p> <#> Malik regards the black community <}> <-> has </-> <+> as </+> </}> having been given the job, by the police, of criminalising those among it who are not deemed "respectable". </p><p> <#> Community is a term of simplification and generalisation which washes over all distinction and enables the silliest and most dangerous political thinking to pass off as credible. </p><p> <#> It might be a serviceable tool by which gay activists and blacks can campaign for legislative change in their favour, where they have a 'community of interests', but I smell fascism when I hear the word community. <#> I hear someone claiming to represent people like me or unlike me, and inviting me to decide whether I am in or out. </p><p> <#> The word 'community' is rarely used to refer to a group of people living in a defined area. <#> In Northern Ireland it is almost always used to refer to the 'unionist community' or the 'nationalist community', terms which clearly exclude huge numbers of people in the very areas referred to. </p><p> <#> The most blatant example of this exclusion was the rigging of the meeting of the Lower Ormeau concerned Community on July 11th, called to decide on whether to try to stop the Twelfth parade of the Ballynafeigh District Lodge of the Orange Order, on the following morning. </p><p> <#> At least a third of the people there applauded speakers calling for the parade to be allowed to go ahead, but the two thirds who roared and whistled and stamped their feet in support of protest were represented to the excluded media (two reporters sneaked in anyway) as representing the whole community. <p><p> <#> Gerard Rice said no vote was necessary and then went off and told the media that there had been a unanimous decision in favour of blocking the parade. </p><p> <#> The result was that those who had gone there to vote against a protest, achieved nothing other than to enhance the impression of support for the view they had gone there to oppose. <#> It was an incredibly optimistic endeavour for so many Lower Ormeau people to try to argue for letting the odious Orangemen through. <#> Having seen how "community democracy" works, they may prefer to stay away next time. <#> Then the Concerned Community really will be able to risk a vote and be confident of unanimous support. </p><p> <#> Politically directed action is routinely described in the Northern Ireland media as an expression of community feeling. <#> Dick Grogan, writing in the <it> Irish Times </it> about the meeting the Pilot 's Row Community Centre which decided to protest before the Apprentice Boys parade on Derry 's Walls said that only fifty people attended the meeting, but that their view was sure to have widespread support. </p><p> <#> How was he to know that? <#> The direction of the protest was managed by Sinn F&/ein, which is a minority political party in Derry - though sometimes you would hardly know that, given the current self effacement of the SDLP. </p><p> <#> Similarly, when paramilitaries smash up homes, break legs and arms, order people out of the country, this is expressed by their spokespeople as the actions of the community, "the community defending itself", never as arising from the conscientious decisions of political operators who are working to defined goals. </p><p> <#> As with the notion of the gay community or the black community as an organic representation of all gays and all blacks, here in Northern Ireland political groupings have been able to appropriate the notion that they are the whole of the community that they arise from, represent it entirely and even define who has the right to live on their patch, or march through it. </p><p> <#> This is a triumph for propaganda. </p><p> <#> Paramilitaries and political parties puff themselves up until they seem the size of whole geographical areas. <#> Entire denominations of religious belief, including the lapsed and the disillusioned are taken to represent single communities of political aspiration, and it seems to be in no one 's interest to question this. </p><p> <#> For instance, the loyalist paramilitaries rationalised attacks on random Catholics through attributing IRA support to a nationalist community. <#> The IRA was hardly going to argue with that and say, <quote> "But hang on, only a few support us" </quote> . <#> They were arguing also that their support extended beyond the Sinn F&/ein vote, and cited the passive co-operation of Catholics who declined to stand up to them as evidence of this. </p><p> <#> Unionist and British government politicians have been arguing for decades that the solution to the problem of violence was for the communities to give up the gunmen, making similar assumptions about the organic unity of the paramilitaries and the people they lived among. <#> They were all overlooking a complexity in the populations of areas like West Belfast and Rathcoole and Mid Ulster, and it seemed to no one 's political advantage to correct them. </p><p> <#> Loyalists, likewise, could rationalise that they represented whole communities that did not vote for them by arguing that their political aspirations were served by larger parties. <#> The votes of those who supported the killings went to the DUP or the Ulster Unionists. <#> Republicans were perfectly happy to agree with this excuse because it confirmed their own vision of a monolithic Protestant bloc that sought only to exterminate Catholics. <#> All prods were the same, you could trust none of them. </p><p> <#> Mary Holland, writing in the Irish Times, anticipated the West Belfast Festival: <quote> "One has the impression of a community proud of its history and traditions and confident of its own ability to make further progress, even to the extent of crossing the psychological barriers which still divide the people." </quote> </p><p> <#> In other words, the forging of a coherent community identity is a means to making peace with others, if only they would get on with forge their identities too. </p><p> <#> Earlier Mary had written of the failure of Shankill Protestants to take pride in the achievements of Michael Longley, Van Morrison, Glenn Patterson and Derek Mahon. </p><p> <#> This is trite drivel. <#> People can decide for themselves whether or not to like Michael Longley.<#> It would be hard to reason, without being absurdly sectarian, that just because you are a Protestant from the Shankill you should take pride in him as one of your own. </p><p> <#> And it is cruel that the people who do not imagine conveniently agreed identity of the imagined community are regarded as non-existent.</I><I><W2B-012$A><h> <bold> <#> Fear and loathing on the Falls Road </bold> <#> Malachi O'Doherty </h><p> <#> When a pregnant woman was viciously raped on the Falls Road recently, the area recoiled with shock. <#> The following afternoon, a woman in a taxi office told the story of what had happened. </p><p> <quote> <#> "They reckon they 'll get him fairly quickly," </quote> she said. <quote> <#> "Who will get him?" </quote> I asked her. <#> She paused before answering, making it clear who 'they' really were. <quote> <#> "The police," <quote> she said, preferring to be discreet. </p><p> <#> That night the Royal Ulster Constabulary said it was getting a very helpful response to its inquiries. <#> On the Falls this statement, which would have been perfectly normal anywhere else, sounded like propaganda: if people were co-operating with the police, and the police with the people, then that - to the cynical eye - was something new. <#> The hearts-and-minds work, particularly among women, that it takes to catch a rapist in a ghetto isn't easy where police must move in armed clusters. </p><p> <#> On that same night, 'they', the other police force, went round the clubs and bars looking for the rapist. <#> A man who had been drinking in one club said: <quote> "It was just like a police raid. <#> They came in and everybody went quiet. <#> Nobody mentioned it, but they walked round all the tables looking everyone in the face." </quote> </p><p> <#> Whatever people on the Falls Road want in terms of criminal investigation and punishment, what they expect is for the IRA to be the most prominent policing agency. </p><p> <#> And, whatever social attitudes surveys and police figures say about support for the police among northern Catholics, the feeling in the prime ghetto areas is still that the police are alien and dangerous - a feeling not confined to supporters of the IRA. <#> There is evidence of intense exasperation among people who want normal policing, and who have broken with the prevailing political culture to demand it. </p><p> <#> I stood out on the Falls Road for an hour one night just after the rape and I asked people going by if they thought there was a lot of crime there. <#> Most of the answers were from men; women wouldn't speak to me. <#> It was no way a scientific poll, but after about 20 interviews three divergent answers were clearly recurring. <quote> <#> 'No. <#> There isn't much crime here at all,' </quote> said some. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Yes,' </quote> said others, <quote> 'there 's a lot of crime. <#> Muggings, joyriding and drugs.' </quote> <quote> <#> 'Does anyone do anything about it?' </quote> <quote> <#> 'Yes, the IRA does.' </quote> </p><p> <#> The third response, as common as the second was: <quote> 'Yes, there 's a lot of crime. <#> There 's bombings and knee-cappings and robberies.' </quote> <quote> <#> 'Does anyone do anything about it?' </quote> <quote> <#> 'No.' </quote> </p><p> <#> It is not simply that the police neglect the area and that people generally turn to Sinn F&/ein. <#> There are a lot of people on the Falls, it seems, who will tell a stranger if asked how much they detest the IRA. <#> Many of these same people accuse the police, too, of abusing the area. </p><p> <#> Last month, on the day after Const Allen Moore shot dead three people in the Sinn F&/ein office - as much a police station to many people as an advice centre - Senior Asst Chief Const William McAllister told journalists that he trusted that the sensible people of the Falls would understand what had happened, would see it as an isolated incident and would not let it dent their faith in the RUC left to be dented. </p><p> <#> A senior social worker told me that he had been in community group meetings where one person had wept with shame at having reported thefts of property to Sinn F&/ein. <quote> <#> "I know,"</quote> he said <quote> "that if I saw a car being stolen out there on the street and called the police they probably wouldn't come for hour. <#> People go to the ones who get results." </quote> </p><p> <#> Charlie Bonner is a haulier from the wealthier part of upper Andersonstown. <#> His son is a joyrider. <#> Charlie has scars on his hands from injuries he received trying to grapple his son out of a moving car. <#> He walked the streets at night looking for his boy. <quote> <#> "Between the Provos and the police," </quote> he said, <quote> "no-one was any use to me." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Bonner 's son has a limp from a past knee-capping. <#> He says he has tried to be reasonable with both the police and the Provos - to come to an arrangement that would help his reckless son, and not simply expose him to violence and abuse. <#> Several times in past weeks he has been to court to see his son remanded in custody. <#> Each time he has been offered bail. <#> He has repeatedly refused it because his son is under an 'exclusion order' from the IRA and it isn't safe to bring him home. </p><p> <#> If that sounds like the IRA extending its policing role to indirectly confining people in state institutions, Brendan...from Ardoyne in north Belfast has a much clearer case of the same kind of thing. <#> He was told by Sinn F&/ein to have his two sons aged 12 and 15 put in care. <#> He achieved this by having social service apply for a place of safety order. <#> The boys were sent to St Patrick 's training school where they met other boys on similar sentences. </p><p> <#> The order on Brendan 's sons was for a full year. <#> He asked the north Belfast Sinn F&/ein councillor Joe Austin to help him get his boys back. <#> Mr Austin visited the boys in St Patrick 's and interviewed them there. <#> He then told Brendan that the threat would be lifted - for weekends only. <#> St Patrick 's accepted this and allowed the boys home. <#> After Christmas, Brendan 's sons were given permission by Sinn F&/ein, mediated via Mr Austin, to stay home full-time. <#> So sentence was passed and commuted from inside the Sinn F&/ein advice centre in Brompton Park. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Sinn F&/ein sentenced your sons to a training school, then gave them time off for good behaviour," </quote> I said to Brendan. <quote> <#> "Isn't that amazing?" </quote> <quote> <#> "Yes", </quote> he said. <quote> <#> "But someone has to do something about delinquents here." </quote> <#> Mr Austin confirmed most of the details. </p><p> <#> There never has been 'normal' policing, whatever that is, in west Belfast. <#> It is 'counter-terrorism' that debases police work now. <#> It is naked physical danger that has turned police stations into fortresses, but there is no precedent of acceptable community policing by the RUC to which west Belfast could return. </p><p> <#> The most common complaint about the handling of crime by the RUC is that it is more interested in recruiting informants than in stopping joyriding and theft. </p><p> <#> The Brian Nelson informer case ( <it> Fortnight </it> 303) might be the most dramatic case of undercover counter-insurgency. <#> Few on the Falls believe the otherwise broadly accepted view that Mr Nelson 's job was to undermine loyalist paramilitaries from inside and save lives. <#> From the Catholic ghettoes it looked simply like a plot to kill republicans. </p><p> <#> The controversial element of the case - that the normal working of the law has to be waived for intelligence-gathering - was not a revelation to people who believe they live among hundreds of small-time informers who are absolved of petty crime in return for services to the police. <#> There is a huge amount of evidence that young 'hoods' are recruited to watch Sinn F&/ein members and report on their movements. </p><p> <#> The chief body of evidence is the accumulated newspaper files of 'outings'. <#> An 'outing' for an informer is his life-saver. <#> He - it is usually he - declares publicly that he has been recruited by the police and gives details of how this was done, often through a press conference organised by Sinn F&/ein. <#> A scan of the files of disclosures by informers in cuttings from <it> <&Irish> An Phoblacht </&Irish> </it> of the <it> Irish News </it> suggests that many young people are pressurised into this kind of work, by a combination of bribes, threats and offers of charges against them being dropped. </p></I>
