<ICE-IRE:S1B-074 Residents' Assoc><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> Okay well I think we 'll we 'll look maybe at the at the different issues a little bit later on I suppose uh <,> I 'll just <,> we 'll fly through the history and then Bob 's got a <.> present </.> <,> uhm a further wee thing uh <#> All I was going to say was <,> following the site visit <,> uh Bob uh went there <.> myse </.> and all of us went to the Council meeting that night and uh Bob made a <.> pres </.> about a ten minute presentation to the Council <#> Uh <,> the objections that were brought up uh in this presentation were the character of the area the impact on traffic loss of amenities the site itself <,> the effect on the environment uh the undertaking itself from the developers ' point of view <,> uh the uh the maps and the inaccuracies on the maps <,> uh the level of opposition which was unprecedented and uh the state of apartment sales uh you know and the market for apartments at the moment which has obviously gone through its ups and downs and I think it 's really on a down at the moment <#> Uhm <,> we then uh just quickly through the rest of the wee bit of history is uh <.> J </.> in July two thousand and two uhm the Council then <,> you 've got to remember the planners still hadn't made a decision on it <#> They had <.> re </.> <,> they had said that they were <.> re </.> going to recommend uh <.> pa </.> passing uh approval <#> They were saying that they would recommend it once council had commented <#> They still hadn't actually recommended it for uh approval uh or sorry <.> ha </.> they hadn't actually approved it <#> Uh so at that point uh the Council recommended that it goes to the Management Board of the Planning Office <#> Uh that 's like the hierarchy or the top level in the planning service <#> Uh and they would look at it you know taking all the evidence uh that has been presented and make uh and uh sort of review what the lower planners had uh you know how they 'd come to their conclusion that it should be passed <,> uh taking into all the uh to into account all the different uh objections and uh uhm sort of <.> ci </.> circumstances I suppose <#> Uh and it sat there from uh July two thousand and two till uh <,> towards the end of September two thousand and two whenever Mr Martin intervened <#> The developer <,> uh intervened and uh <,> pulled the application uh on the basis that a decision hadn't <,> happened that basically time had gone on and that the planners hadn't got to a decision <,> uh through whatever circumstances it happened <#> And so he then went to the independent body called the you know the Planning Appeals Commission that you 've all been written to by and uh you know the <.> ap </.> in other words the application was in default <#> Uhm <,> <&> clears throat </&> this pulled it sort of right out of the normal I suppose uh procedures and uh it <.> k </.> it 's now gone to this uh Planning Appeals Commission <#> The uh <.> obje </.> <,> the <,> developer had uh has stated that he wants an informal hearing and as I know you 've probably been written to to be told that it 's on the fifteenth <,> sorry <,> it is on the fifth of February <,> uh ten o'clock uhm and that you were given the opportunity then to decide whether you wanted to attend that or whether you wanted to join with others to put forward a a focused opinion uh or you know <,> your view through a smaller a smaller body <#> Uhm <,> and uh at that <,> that that point sort of Bob and Bob and myself we decided well we were going to attend <#> We 'd we 'd gone this far so we were <.> gon </.> we just said we would be there and then we decided we would call some sort of a meeting to uhm I suppose to uh <,> to discuss with you lot uhm the uh the way forward <#> Uhm <,> we uh realise that we have to present a statement of case on the fifteenth of the first uh five pm that day and you just don't get <,> there 's no grace given <#> Uh <,> it <.> ha </.> it 's supposed to be fifteen hundred words and and I know that Bob has put a bit of work into this <#> Uh it can be uh you know it 's a document that just is presented uh to the different parties before the meeting <,> I think two weeks before the meeting <#> Uh we also see Mr Martin 's uh statement of case as well <,> and uh those documents then sort of uh are kind of the <,> the basis on which a discussion or informal hearing takes place chaired by the uh one of the <.> C </.> the uhm commission <,> uh the Planning Appeals Commission <#> And it 's a roundtable <,> supposed to be quite a relaxed atmosphere uh hearing <#> So it 'll be interesting <#> Uh <&> clears throat </&> so uhm <,> what what I suppose uh just before I ask Bob to talk about his uh <,> uh the actual you know the bit of work he 's done on uh putting together a statement of case <,> I suppose what we 're trying to say is that we 're we 're keen to put <,> to present a clear and reasoned argument in favour of appropriate development and against uh inappropriate uh development <,> uhm and maybe to consider uh whether we then go towards a compromise <,> uh in that meeting and we just need to hear your views and and and listen to what you 've to say about that <#> And also to have an idea of what you 're planning uh you know if any of you have already indicated that you 're going to go to the informal hearing <#> I suppose for our own idea of what the meeting 's going to be like we 'd like to know that <,> uhm and uh whether if you if you 've maybe indicated by coming tonight you may be wanting to say that you want to be represented there and if you 're happy for us to do that we would like to know that before we go <#> And uh <,> also then if you 've just any ideas of the of the way forward towards the fifth of February uh we 're <.> o </.> open to hear all that <#> Maybe I could open <,> uh threw it over to Bob here to talk about the statement of case <,> that bit<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> The one thing we 're not quite clear about here is what actually happens at this commission at this meeting <#> And I honestly believe it 's going to be a compromise situation where both sides are going to gradually move towards each other <#> I don't think we can <.> s </.> stop any development here <#> That 's the first thing <#> I don't know what people feel about that but I don't see how we can actually <,> stop them building a range of houses <#> Now we 've talked privately amongst ourselves about what we 'd be willing to put up with <,> and we 're talking about some semi-detached houses <,> maybe six would fit into there <,> three nice detached houses or a mixture of bungalows semis or whatever <,> that type of thing <#> But that all fits in very nicely with the area <#> And the one thing that I can't understand about this is this apartment block sitting right in the middle of Gilnahirk <#> It 's just it 's so absurd <#> So I mean that 's my opinion at the moment is that we 'll probably to have to go in to negotiate and this <.> chair </.> uh neutral guy will just sit there and he 'll try and work between the two of us and see what <,> see which way we can sort something out <#> Is that other people 's impression of this <#> Are you still in a mind to block the thing completely<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> Could could I just say I don't believe that the Planning Appeals Commission are neutral<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> I believe that they are in favour of the developer <{1> <[1> and </[1> I 'm not <,> I 'm not entirely sure what the right approach to take is but I wouldn't see it as a neutral party arbitrating between two individuals and coming to some compromise like say six semi-detached or something of that order <#> <{2> <[2> I <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> <[2> They 'd certainly </[2> </{2> claim to be neutral <#> They claim to be I mean the <{> <[> document here here </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> <[> I wouldn't I wouldn't deny that </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> Okay mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> But I I don't believe on the basis of the information that we 've received recently from<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> The Planning Appeals Commission that they are neutral in fact <#> They seem to be in favour of the development as currently planned<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> Is that that recent DOE letter<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> Uh yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> You see that 's really <,> that 's still 's from planning<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> That 's planning office rather than the PAC which is a different body again<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> The reason that <{> <[> you 're </[> <,> I know what you 're saying because we we were a bit confused by that letter when it first came <#> But I I that letter the recent one that laid out all the conditions do you remember<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> <[> That's separate </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> Well that that that was <,> that actually is from the planners <,> not from the planning appeals<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> So there is reason to <.> s </.> to hope that they are neutral<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> Well everything that they have said in the way of their documentation in any of their letters <#> If you know we we 've sort of <,> you can visit their website uh which is quite an interesting place to go at PAC <,> you know <.> du </.> WWW dot PAC NI dot CO dot UK I think it is uh is the website and uh you know gives you <,> recent it gives you uh recent examples that they 've gone through it gives you <#> You know so it 's <.> k </.> it 's quite a helpful site uhm and I think that uh they claim to be neutral<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> I 'll give you that to have a read at <#> This is <{> <[> the PAC 's </[> <,> all about the procedures basically<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> <[> Right okay </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> Oh yes thank-you<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> Okay have a do have a look at that and if you hear anything that they 're not independent <&> laughter </&> I 'd be interested<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> Well <unclear> several sylls </unclear> if it 's an informal meeting and for argument 's sake both sides say come to some kind of agreement <,> is that then uh enforceable or is that still in <,> you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> We don't know Bob <#> We just <{1> <[1> don't know <#> I mean that 's what I what I </[1> <,> I understand what you mean because you were worried that we 'd go and turn up and say <,> look we 'll put up with three of these and then that happens but other people aren't happy with that <#> That 's what I 'm slightly concerned that we go with the bottom line to negotiate on <#> But we 're not even sure if that 's the procedure yet <#> That 's the trouble <#> We should maybe try and clarify that a bit more <,> <{2> <[2> what the actual meeting 's about </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> <[1> Right <,> I mean <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$D> <X> <#> <[2> Well I thought it was in the instructions </[2> </{2> <,> the chairman issues a report and the <{> <[> report </[> becomes binding </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$C> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> Yeah <#> I think there is a a pretty clear uh outcome from this <#> I think something like four weeks <.> af </.> <,> there 's a there <,> they can whoever leads that meeting submits a report with all his findings back to the Planning Appeals Commission <,> and the planning they look at it for about another two or three weeks and then they issue their decision and their decision is basically like just<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$E> <#> I think in any tribunal situation Neil there <{> <[> <,> it 's <,> </[> you know <,> it 's a tribunal and there are findings made<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> <[> End of story </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$E> <#> And therefore acted upon<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> Yup<ICE-IRE:S1B-074$E> <#> I think <.> wha </.> what 's imperative for us to bear in mind here whether <,> we 're sort of right on top of the site like yourselves or sort of being affected by a lot of others here with children and increased community safety aspects <#> That going into this <,> we need to be seen to be fair-minded <{1> <[1> people <,> </[1> and that I think if we do sort of offer alternatives and and show that we 're quite happy that the area be developed but not exploited <{2> <[2> <#> You know </[2> I think apartments <,> fifteen apartments is exploitation whereas maybe three detached dwellings is development <#> You know and it 's not going to bring in an extra thirty or fifty vehicles going up and down the streets every <{3> <[3> morning </[3> and evening <#> You know that type of thing <#> And that 's <{4> <[4> what <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[4><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> <[2> Yeah yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$A> <#> <[3> Yeah yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-074$B> <#> <[4> Like I 'll treat this with </[4> </{4> what you 've said <,> that 's exactly what I 've got here <,> is a very positive statement of uh <#> We agree with modernisation <,> we agree with development in the Gilnahirk area <#> We can't not agree with otherwise our houses wouldn't be there <#> But what we want is reasonable development and that sort of thing <#> Now what we 've done is <.> writ </.> drawn up a statement of case <,> very much a draft <#> I 've gone round to photograph a few houses so don't mind <,> if your house is on it and you don't want it on it please let me know but it 's Gilnahirk Court and Gilnahirk Park <#> But it 's just to show the type of houses that are there <#> So there 's an <.> in </.> introduction about the area <#> The next bit then is what the proposed development is the scale of it <,> all the sort of problems that we 've seen with the design of it <#> I've started to criticise the design of it <#> I started to look at it and think this is absurd <#> I mean there 's a playground here across a road from the main place <#> I mean it 's daft <#> Lots of silly wee things like that are just <,> so I've accused them a little bit of uh <,> poor quality design and things <#> Just <.> ve </.> very gently <#> Everything 's done very you know wee kicks on the shins here but all done very <,> <&> laughter </&> <.> un </.> right down underneath the table</I>
