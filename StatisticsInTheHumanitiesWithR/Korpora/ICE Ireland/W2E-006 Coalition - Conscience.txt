<W2E-006 Coalition - Conscience><I><W2E-006$A><h> <it> <#> STRIKING BACK AGAINST THE REYNOLDS ' FACTOR </h> </it><h> <bold> <#> F.F. in disarray as 'Rainbow' looms. </h> </bold><p> <#> <bold> YOU should never underestimate the ability of politicians to cock things up. <#> Last week, I said that unless something extraordinary happened, we would have a Fianna F&/ail/Labour Party Government, with Mr. Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach. </bold> </p><p> <#> Well, something extraordinary did happen and we have been living with the consequences since. <#> We learned that the Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, and his Fianna F&/ail Ministers were fully aware of the importance of the Duggan case on the Monday before the government fell, and that they kept this information from the D&/ail and from their Labour partners in government. </p><p> <#> CONFIRMATION that they knew was forthcoming from the new Attorney-General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, who confirmed that he had been sent to demand Harry Whelehan 's resignation because he had misled the Government. </p><p> <#> SINCE then, we have been treated to the unedifying spectacle of Fianna F&/ail Ministers trying to pretend that black is white. <#> And opposition deputies have bayed for blood as they displayed their own incompetence and the inadequacy of D&/ail systems to deal with modern demands. </p><p> <#> BUT the most striking development of all was the manner in which the crisis rent the Fianna F&/ail parliamentary party asunder. <#> Mr. Ray Burke, a former Minister for Justice, led the charge. <#> The years on the backbenches have soured him and he was determined to put the boot into Mr. Reynolds, and into the Ministers who had displaced him and Mr. Gerry Collins in Cabinet. </p><p> <#> HE came out like a roaring lion. <#> Demanding that the cover-up should end. <#> The people of the country and Fianna F&/ail supporters were fed up with it all, he thundered. <#> He wanted the truth and he wanted it now. </p><p> <#> <bold> IT was a vintage performance - on a par with Mr. Gerry Collins ' plea to Mr. Albert Reynolds in 1991 not to <quote> "burst up the party." </quote> <#> Mr. Burke was just the first of a line of ten deputies who said much the same thing - without the stridency - on radio, television and in the D&/ail. <#> It was a major strike-back against Albert and his people. </bold> </p><p> <#> THE truly amusing part of it all didn't happen until the following day on Morning Ireland, when Mr. David Hanley questioned the Minister of State, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke on Mr. Burke 's performance. <#> She didn't bat an eyelid. <#> Ray Burke, she intoned, was expressing his anger and dismay over the way in which the opposition parties had made a hames of the D&/ail inquiry into the matter. <#> It was their incompetence that was preventing the truth from coming out, and nothing to do with Ministers or with Mr. Reynolds. <#> It was a gobsmacking performance for its sheer effrontery. </p><p> <#> MRS. O'Rourke should really fly under her maiden name colours. <#> For that performance was vintage Lenihan, and one that her brother, Brian, would be unable to better. <#> And, as they say, <quote> "it wasn't from the wind she took it." </quote> </p><p> <#> IT wasn't just that deputies in the party were gouging and kicking one another in the greatest free-for-all that the party has seen in years. <#> Other scores were being settled too. <#> And one of the top targets was Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons. </p><p> <#> PEOPLE at the top weren't going to sit quietly and wait for the new Attorney-General to shaft them by telling all he knew about the cover-up. <#> No. <#> They were going to get their retaliation in first by trying to discredit him and by tarring him with the same black brush that had been used on them. <#> And so, two documents were "leaked" to the Irish Independent. </p><p> <#> ONE of them involved a letter with a missing paragraph and the suggestion was that Mr. Fitzsimons had been responsible for the removal of this paragraph before the document was circulated to the D&/ail. <#> But there was no proof of this. <#> It was a case of dirty tricks. <#> And perhaps a warning that if you play with the big boys, you can get badly hurt. </p><p> <#> THE whole episode has thoroughly turned the public off politics and politicians. <#> Perhaps the worst aspect of it was that the new Fianna F&/ail Leader, Mr. Bertie Ahern, was either unable or unwilling to do anything about it. </p><p> <bold> <#> WHEN Ray Burke cut loose at Albert Reynolds and his men, Mr. Ahern issued a statement calling it "unhelpful." <#> What a wishy-washy reponse! <#> It was like calling a tornado a strong wind. <#> And there was no suggestion Mr. Burke would be punished <}> <-> throught </-> <+> through </+> </}> the removal of the party whip. <#> That was, one Bertie source said: <quote> "at least two or three fences away." </quote> </bold> </p><p> <#> ALBERT was furious. <#> Not just at Mr. Burke, but at the new party leader. <#> And although Bertie subsequently sent out word to his supporters to <}> <-> buttom </-> <+> button </+> </}> their lips, the damage had been done; the seeds of internal war has been sown. </p><p> <#> EVEN as Mr. Reynolds circulated a document to all Fianna F&/ail deputies on how to explain the cover-up and urging them to condemn the opposition parties for their D&/ail <quote> "Star Chamber", </quote> the clock was ticking towards the formation of a rainbow coalition. </p><p> <#> AND Mr. John Bruton, the man whose political career was in a shambles a week ago, stands at the altar with Labour and Democratic Left in expectation of becoming the next Taoiseach. <#> It <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> been a hell of an about-turn in the fortunes of a man who nobody would throw a good word to in recent months. <#> And it doesn't promise an easy beginning for a new government. </p><p> <#> THE Fine Gael Leader may be honest and decent. <#> But he is certainly not inspiring <#> And as the country faces into crucial months involving the Northern Ireland peace process, Mr. Bruton 's role will be absolutely central. <#> There are signs that he has already begun to modify his views in order to take greater account of nationalist sentiment. <#> And both he and Gerry Adams have spoken of working together. <#> But it will take real talent to bury the suspicions and difficulties of the past, and to encourage the Provisional IRA to maintain its ceasefire. </p><p> <#> THERE is no reason why Mr. Bruton should not grow into the job. <#> After all, Liam Cosgrove was not a charismatic figure, but yet he led a solid coalition arrangement. </p><p> <bold> <#> IN that regard, the negotiations underway between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left will be critical in under-pinning the stability and cohesion of a future government. <#> A solid, up-front, government programme is the only thing that will hold the parties together for 2.5 years. <#> And it is the economy and Northern Ireland which will provide the highest hurdles for the parties to jump. </bold> </p></I><I><W2E-006$B><h> <#> COMMENT </h><h> <#> Time to Leave the Farce Behind </h><p> <#> With the televising of proceedings in Leinster House really coming into its own viewers were treated to ongoing entertainment with plots and counter plots, unexpected twists, back-stabbing, stage management, and political play-acting at its best, or its worst, whether you were regarding it as something serious or as the best farce in town that week. </p><p> <#> If ever the public had any doubts about the inefficiency of the political system, of its departments and of the whole structure of running this country they must now realise that a major job of redesigning it is essential. <#> The actors will have time during the Christmas recess to go away and take a new look at themselves, their parties and their performances because things will never be the same again in Leinster House. </p><p> <#> Now it is down to the task of forming a government. <#> As John Bruton negotiates with Dick Spring, we will soon find out whether Fine Gael 's leadership negotiating skills and firmness will match, or excel, those of the Labour chief. <#> The new regime takes office at a crucial time for the Irish economy. <#> By and large that economy is healthy and growth prospects seem to be reasonably good. <#> It depends on the management. <#> Wrong policies and decisions could easily track us way off course. <#> It would be disastrous if inflation got a nudge forward, or if the upward trend in public spending was exacerbated. </p><p> <#> Proper control on the semi-state bodies is essential. <#> Lessons should have been learned from events on that front earlier this year. <#> The peace process, employment, control of the economy, all these are essential. <#> The government will have to perform much better in areas of essential legislation and seriously come to grips with the snails-pace system of drafting and finalising Bills crying out for ttention and gathering dust in pigeon holes. </p><p> <#> Who can say, with their hands on their hearts, that the press has no role in probing areas in the political life of this country, in the semi-states, within the various departments of Government. <#> Despite the difficulties created for both public and press in our out-moded libel laws, some newspapers did take risks and if they had not would all of us now know some of the undesirable developments of the recent past? <#> If politicians or others in high places, try to hide unacceptable practices to the detriment of the public, or to keep back information to which the nation is entitled must there not be a watchdog there to keep the public informed? <#> Geraldine Kennedy 's revealing article in 'The Irish Times' which made Dick Spring seem to have second thoughts was an essential development in the recent saga - though the controversy is ongoing about the sequence of events. </p><p> <#> Press freedoms have to be handled responsibly and newspapers must be let know they cannot get away with manufactured, unbalanced or over-sensationalised items. <#> At the same time the public is entitled to know what is going on in the running of our country, in law breaking and in accountability, or lack of it. <#> Far too many people want to prevent that happening and it is time the shackles were broken. </p><p> <#> The new Government has a difficult task, not least of all because of its disparate ingredients. <#> However, with vigilance, responsibility and true concern for the future of this nation it can work. <#> For all our sakes, let 's hope it does. </p></I><I><W2E-006$C><h> <#> <bold> Conscience </bold> </h><p> <#> THE COUNTLESS thousands of customers who flocked to Limerick stores on Sunday for the innocent enjoyment of an afternoon 's shopping got a rude awakening on Monday when Archbishop Desmond Connell of Dublin pronounced on Radio 1 's Morning Ireland against Sabbath trading. </p><p> <#> In fairness, his remarks are directed not at shoppers but at shopkeepers. <#> Stores that open on Sundays, he maintains, are primarily motivated not by a sense of social service but by profits. <#> That is undoubtedly so. </p><p> <#> And why not? <#> Without profits, private businesses go bust and jobs are lost. <#> There is nothing intrinsically wrong with profits. </p><p> <#> Archbishop Connell implies, however, that once some stores open on Sundays, others feel they have no choice but to follow suit. <#> But surely if people choose to go into business, they must accept the consequences of free and fair competition. </p><p> <#> And what of the freedom of choice of the customer? <#> No-one is dictating to anyone when to shop. <#> Shops are open on Sundays in Limerick this Christmas purely by public demand. <#> The proof lies in previous trading records for the festive season. </p><p> <#> Moreover, sales assistants, far far from being oppressed by seven-day opening, are glad of the opportunity to earn extra cash for Christmas. </p><p> <#> The central argument in the God and Mammon debate, however, must be the moral one: namely that Sabbath trading necessarily breaches the Third Commandment. <#> This ignores the facts, namely that for many people Sunday shopping, far from being a chore, is a leisure activity, and that for others - such as families with two parents going out to work - it is a virtual necessity. </p><p> <#> But the fundamental moral issue is not Sunday observance at all but freedom of conscience. </p></I>
