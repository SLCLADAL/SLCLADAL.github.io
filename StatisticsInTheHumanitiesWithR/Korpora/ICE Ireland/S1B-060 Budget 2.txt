<ICE-IRE:S1B-060 Budget 2><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-060$A> <#> Now the Minister for Finance would know <,> that interest rates have started to rise internationally <#> And he would know himself <,> and so would other members of the House that prudence is required <#> Now there 's one certain thing about analysts and experts <,> and my own view over the years always has been I get very uh dubious when they all agree on one particular point <,> and they all say things are going to happen in a certain direction <#> It 's a bit like politicians and political commentators saying things are going to be this X Y and azed in <,> on the political compass for some time to come and we have seen in the recent past how foolhardy those particular predictions were made by all of us <#> But where they all <,> I think that without any <,> without doing anything the Minister would be aware that there are difficulties facing us ahead <#> Interest rate hikes will knock the gains in this particular budget <,> on the taxation field <,> anywhere in the welfare area <,> and in all other areas <#> And it saps and erodes confidence <#> It leads further to higher debt service costs and it sends us on the downward spiral again <#> And inflation is the enemy of the poor <#> Now I would just like to say for the benefit of the House and those commentators that over that period of eight years have not given us the credit regarding the finance and the economy that I think we deserve <,> not that they 're going to get up tomorrow morning and write anything flattering about us but I think we should just I should just read into the record of the House as to what the situation was at the end of eighty-six when we came to power <#> The Exchequer borrowing requirement at the end of eighty-six was two thousand one hundred and forty-five million <,> which was twelve point one percent of gross national product <#> The current budget deficit was one thousand three hundred and ninety-five million or seven point nine percent of gross national product <#> In the end of ninety-four <,> as published <,> the total Exchequer borrowing requirement was only seventy-two million pounds or two point two percent of gross national product <#> And may I say it was even lower than that because in answer to a question from me uh two weeks ago the Minister for Finance did concede that about a hundred and thirty million pounds of EU money that was scheduled to come in nineteen ninety-four hadn't come and would be pencilled in for ninety-five <#> Plus if you add up the factors of special one-off payments that the Minister made uh uh to Aer Lingus and to uh the post An Post et-cetera means that we had actually a lower Exchequer borrowing requirement <,> but even doing the things that he did gave a zero current budget deficit at the end of for nineteen ninety-four <#> In fact there was a surplus of fifteen million pounds <#> And Fianna Fa/il politicians see the difficulty in winning either way <#> Uh some of the criticism <.> le </.> <.> le </.> uhm levered against my uh leader <,> Deputy Ahern in ninety-four was that he wasn't being tough enough on the public finances in his era of being Minister for Finance <#> Yet he was able to achieve in three years a a situation that we hadn't been at for the previous twenty-seven <#> It is the first current budget surplus for twenty-seven years <#> Now I made a kind of a semi-political career <&> break in tape </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-060$A> <#> That that was considered not just by Deputy Bruton but by a wide cross-section of opinion in this House <#> And yet today <,> in January in February nineteen ninety-five we seem hell-bent on going back the same way from which we came <#> I can welcome individual features of the budget but i 'tis flawed in its overall financial strategy <#> Its most serious defect is the government 's refusal not to plan for <.> pla </.> a balanced current budget in ninety-five <#> There are people who would say we should plan for a surplus in ninety-five because we 're probably at the top of the economic cycle <,> now <,> and prudence dictates in business or in running a country that it is then that you make the tough decisions not when you 're at the bottom end of the scale because that day will come as well <,> and I know officials that have served in the Department of Finance would agree with me <#> I know a lot of the members <,> least of all probably the Minister for Finance might agree with me <,> but it hasn't been done <#> And for the first time in a quarter of a century a small current account budget surplus arose last year <#> I regard it as quite extraordinary that the government led by Deputy John Bruton <,> would even countenance in this economic climate a return to the policy of current budget deficiting <#> While it should not be a mortal sin for a politician to change his or her mind <,> except of course if one is a Fianna Fa/il politician <&> laughter </&> I refuse to believe that Deputy Bruton and other Fine Gael members have so U-turned their thinking on this particular policy issue <#> It has proved exceptionally difficult for successive governments <,> with attendant hardship for the public dependent on public services over the last eight years <,> to get the public finances into some kind of order <#> It was the policy experiment of current budget deficits which was the main contributory factor in this country arriving at a situation of near-bankruptcy in the eighties <#> I repeat what I <,> Deputy Bruton and others said many years ago on this particular topic <#> As policy as a policy experiment or option <,> there was nothing inherently wrong in adopting a policy of current budget deficits in the short term <#> But the policy was a failure <#> Of their very nature current budget deficits have no lasting economic benefit <,> but worse still it piled up our national debt problems to mountainous proportions <,> the servicing of which imposed a severe financial burden on the taxpayer to the present day <#> It should be remembered that although our financial problems have improved <,> servicing the debt will cost over two thousand one hundred million in nineteen ninety-five <#> Of course <,> politically it proved nearly impossible to correct that particular slide <#> Surely we have learnt some lessons as politicians at least from those policy errors of the past <#> The difficult corrective process took its toll not alone on politicians but on the public <#> The vast majority of the public accepted the very tough medicine but I at least suggest that they did so on the explicit understanding that having corrected the imbalances in the past that no government would <.> re </.> ever repeat those mistakes <#> I find it amazing that Deputy Bruton and his party who were passionate advocates of <.> cor </.> of correcting the stupidity of the policy of current budget deficits not so long ago have now been silenced <#> In my view having economically got back near to the point <,> only near to the point of where we set out a quarter of a century ago <,> it is quite daft to restart that same crazy economics again <#> The Minister for Finance had the opportunity on this occasion to plan for a balanced budget and make a bulwark decision that would make it practically impossible for any future administration of no matter what side of this House <,> no matter what parties make it up <,> to stray from <,> except only in the most exceptional political circumstances <,> or economic circumstances <#> Only the most exceptional <#> And when the Minister hadn't done it today it will never be done I 'm afraid <,> not in my political lifetime at least <,> <#> In the recent past there has been considerable debate inside and outside this House regarding the disrespect in which politicians and the political process is held <,> <#> It would be well to remind everyone that this phenomenon did not start in ninety-four <,> but in my view it had its genesis in the foolhardy economic decisions right from the seventies <#> We were not then prepared to live within our means as a nation and governments of all persuasions were politically unable to stop the merry-go-round <#> In ninety-five there was an opportunity presented to this government to make a categoric statement in that area which which would have lasted into the future <#> And I 'm not just saying it for political purpose to embarrass my good friend Deputy Ruairi Quinn <#> I think that most sensible people <,> and people who 've thought about the way we 've progressed in the past twenty years <,> even since the time that both Deputy Quinn and I were students in Earlsfort Terrace <,> we surely we have made chronic mistakes economically <,> the lot of us <#> But at least on this side of the House my particular particular party has demonstrated in the past eight years has learned from them <#> A lot of things were thrown against our party in the seventies and eighties <#> Everyone spoke about the problems that we were going to do <#> There were programmes to eliminate budget deficits and get the finances in order over four or five years et-cetera <#> But actually and everyone said well Fianna Fa/il 'll never do it <#> It was Fianna Fa/il who started the process and <,> I <,> in all fairness to everybody is that we did it <#> Deputy Garret FitzGerald spoke about <,> Deputy John Kelly Deputy Bruton Deputy Dukes and others <,> because we didn't we weren't no party was able to do it <,> cos there despite the best will in the world of those people it wasn't politically possible to do it until Deputy Haughey came to power in eighty-seven and set the course or the trail that my party at least has followed through <,> resulting in Deputy Ahern being able to in the last three years arrive at the happy situation that we have today<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$X> <#> Hear-hear<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$E> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-060$A> <#> Deputy Barry I am the one person in the Fianna Fa/il party that publicly on television that praised Deputy Dukes for the Tallaght Strategy some years ago when he was doing it <,> not when he was gone <#> And I did it inside this House I did it inside this House on those steps up there one night in a speech I praised him at the time <,> and I did it then and the record will show it<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$B> <#> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> Deputy McCreevy please<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$A> <#> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> There is an inextricable link between the levels of taxation and the levels of public service <,> <#> In my opinion there is no benefit economically or indeed politically for any government or parties to create an impression that levels of public service can increase without an attendant rise in taxation or an increase in economic activity <,> <#> Our high rates of taxation are a direct result of high borrowing to finance day-to-day expenditures of the past <#> There is little point in promising more services <,> if we 're not going to as a nation create more economic wealth in order to be in a position to pay for them <#> Now we would not be in the healthy situation that we are today and my sympathy to Deputy Quinn extends to the fact that I 'm sure he must have been quite livid that every morning he 'd get up for the past two weeks and read parts of what he was going to do in the budget in the papers <#> I know it wasn't him nor do I know it was any of his officials or anyone that works with him even in a political context <#> I 'll give him <,> I have no hesitation in saying that at all <#> But it 's a pity <,> I I 've asked the Taoiseach earlier to take some corrective action in that <#> <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> But this but this largesse that we have today would not be there unless Fianna Fa/il has done it <#> Now despite the largesse at what has happened <,> the minimum that people of <,> anyone in Ireland would be able to say <,> is that at least people on Social Welfare would be able to have <,> be better off today and get some of the improvement which has come about <#> Now <,> this <,> I 'll just read a few facts into the record <,> <#> The Minister for Finance has read out that there will be a two and a half percent increase <,> for social welfare recipients <#> Now despite the problems since eighty-seven <,> bad and all as the difficulties we have <,> no Fianna Fa/il led government has ever announced an increase of less than three percent in that period<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$X> <#> Hear-hear<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$A> <#> In eighty-seven the most impossible year <,> we get three percent <,> eighty-eight three percent <,> eighty-nine three percent <,> nineteen-ninety five percent <,> ninety-one and ninety-two four percent <,> ninety-three three and a half percent <,> and in ninety-four three percent <#> Now <,> this would be <,> I understand the difficulties of making ends meet <,> but Deputy Rabbitte last year <,> the man who knows little bit about everything and not too much about a whole lot <&> laughter </&> said<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$C> <#> And he wasn't here today<ICE-IRE:S1B-060$D> <#> Motion again <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-060$A> <#> Deputy Rabbitte is on the <,> I understand that Deputy Rabbitte is on the TV announcing to the Irish public uh some of the good news which he announced or had announced for the last few days himself but he thinks it 's better now to do it directly rather than have it done in the uh the other fashion</I>
