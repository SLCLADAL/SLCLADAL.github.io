<W1B-007 Friends' letters><I><W1B-007$A><h> <#> 21 February </h><p> <#> <&French> Bonjour </&French> Aoife! <#> I will begin with an apology merited by the fact that I have totally failed to keep in contact. <#> As you may know (or not know) letter writing is a pet hate of mine. <#> I detest it with a vengeance but as Leah is leaving for Belgium this Thursday, I thought I 'd better put pen to paper and get scribbling.</p><p> <#> From what I can gather you 're having rather a good time without indulging in the pleasure of reading my letters! <#> If this is the case you 're having a better time than us poor, bored and frustrated creatures back home. <#> We have once again slid into the usual Friday night routine of Bunatee - Snack Bar - Food - Home which is excusing my limited French, boring the shit out of me. <#> I am toying with the idea of leaving aside this Friday night ritual and reverting to Saturday night at the Egg with the devil incarnate and his merry band of faithful followers a.k.a. the Waterpolo crowd! <#> Yes, I fear it is time to break the harness of habit in the search for bigger, better and more 'constructive' times. </p><p> <#> On the subject of waterpolo, Queen 's held the Intervarsity competition last weekend and, conveniently enough, won both the <}> <-> mens </-> <+> men 's </+> </}> and <}> <-> womens </-> <+> women 's </+> </}> competition due in part, at least, to a lucky draw! <#> But anyway, griping aside it was a great weekend which finished in the Greenan Lodge (now known as 'Hotel Balmoral' - delusions of grandeur obviously) on Saturday night. <#> Bob was up from Dublin although any time I saw him he had his face stuck to a beer can. <#> Bill 's x-bird - Caoimhe made a surprise appearance and was in good form. <#> Luke, with the rest of the Trinity team were present and did, in no uncertain terms make their presence felt by breaking a bed - 30 man/woman <}> <-> trampoling </-> <+> trampolining </+> </}> championships. <#> The hotel kitchens were raided by D.I.T. which resulted in about <*> pound sign </*> 200 worth of food going amiss only to turn up in the shape of pavlovas and smoked salmon the next morning as they attempted to make a quick exit. <#> All things considered it was a most enjoyable night although much to my disappointment I failed to tackle! <#> My efforts were spurned - I crashed and burned! </p><p> <#> So, what else I hear you cry? <#> Well Dermot and Allie are still doing the Siamese twins act - they started ballroom dancing last week! <#> Dermot has got a new car - well <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> not exactly new - <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> 8 years old - but goes! </p><p> <#> Jane and Ronnie are, to my knowledge organising a surprise party for SJ this weekend - something to look forward to although it means a night surrounded by lawyers. <#> But, I 'm quite sure everyone will get thoroughly plastered and enjoy themselves. </p><p> <#> We went out last Saturday for Emma 's birthday. <#> Emma, being Emma, however forgot to book dinner at Legends. <#> On arriving, she told the waitress that dinner had been booked and that there had to be a mistake. <#> We were given a table, the wine was opened and 5 minutes later we had to get up and leave - a tad embarrassing but funny all the same! </p><p> <#> Oh yes! <#> Ken and I went to Boston for 4 days 3 weeks ago. <#> We drank a lot, felt sick a lot and generally enjoyed ourselves. <#> Kenneth didn't tackle Lisa as planned but settled for one of her (in my opinion) better looking friends! <#> The girl was gurning at the airport as he left and had only met him the day before - obviously psychologically unbalanced! </p><p> <#> Well, I think <}> <-> thats </-> <+> that 's </+> </}> about it. <#> Not bad for a start! <#> Now that I know <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> not as bad I 'll write again - <ul> when </ul> I get a reply! </p><p> <#> In the meantime take care and enjoy yourself (as if you need me to tell you that!) </p><p> <#> All the hairy chest! <#> Love Walter x </p></I><I><W1B-007$B><h> <#> 19/11/94 </h><p> <#> Dearest Aoife, <#> It won't be long now until you 're home. <#> I am really looking forward to seeing you. <#> The Christmas lights were turned on, on Thursday night and it will be no time until Christmas. <#> It is really annoying seeing the town so packed. <#> I am glad to hear you are coping with all the partying so well. <#> Life will seem so dull here by the time you come home. </p><p> <#> It is Saturday morning and I am just waiting around until I go to collect Luke from music. <#> So much of a lie in (NOT!). <#> Anything is better than 7am I suppose. <#> I am just entering into my fifth week. <#> The first two weeks were very shaky but I have settled in well now. <#> This week was so hectic and it will be until Christmas. <#> I have an interview on Wednesday for a trainee manager in Tecno, it sells camera and audio equipment. <#> They have shops all around the UK. <#> I don't think I would be too fussed, but the interview will be good experience and I will see what the pay would be like. <#> I really would like the trainee manager position with Next. <#> The pay is really good, training at <*> pound sign </*> 14,000. <#> That would pay for a good few summer holidays. </p><p> <#> I would love to get away for a while at the moment. <#> We were (the 5 girls that is) <}> <-> suppossed </-> <+> supposed </+> </{> to be going to Cushendall this weekend but Jane has to work tonight. <#> We are definitely going next Saturday afternoon and coming home on Sunday evening. <#> I am being a marshall next Saturday morning at a big fun run in town. <#> One of the girls on the course is organising it as part of her placement and has recruited all of us to wear yellow bibs. </p><p> <#> I went to the cinema last night with SJ and Jane after having a row with Leonard on the phone. <#> We went out on Tuesday night and arranged to go out somewhere on Thursday. <#> I phoned on Thursday night and was told by Brendan (the one in the house that Jane tackled) that he was away home to Armagh. <#> I was raging, he didn't even have the courtesy to phone. <#> This was after him sending me a mushy letter to work on Tuesday. <#> He phoned last night at about 6.30 and was out with his friends. <#> He had the cheek to say at the end of the phone call <quote> 'Are you in a bad mood' </quote> . <#> He couldn't even see what he had done wrong - and I thought he <ul> might </ul> be different. <#> He said he will phone me on Sunday. <#> I hope he had a shitty night last night. <#> Well enough of that, I will start getting angry again. </p><p> <#> Oh by the way Morgan Matthews phoned me on Sunday, I 'm seeing him this Monday night at the class rep meeting - I 'll keep you posted about that one. </p><p> <#> How is Victor, still as gorgeous as ever. <#> You never know, perhaps you will get a snog before you come home for Christmas. <#> I better go here and run my Mum into town - she 's starting her Christmas shopping (MAD!!). </p><p> <#> Miss you loads, <#> lots of love <#> Leah xoxo </p></I><I><W1B-007$C><h> <#> 16/11/94 </h><p> <#> Dearest Aoife, <#> How are you? <#> Thank-you for your lovely card, it was great to hear from you! <#> I 'm really glad that you 're having such a wonderful time in Belgium - but don't be enjoying yourself too much, because we all can't wait to see you at Christmas.</p><p> <#> When you left first I was wondering what it must be like to have to settle into a whole new environment, with strange people in a strange country. <#> I 'm sure it must have been quite daunting at first. <#> So, when Sarah-Jane returned, and told us what a wonderful time you were having, and how nice the place was, I was really happy. <#> What are the people in your house like? <#> Although you didn't have any Irish or English students - it 's probably just as nice - more cultural! <#> You must be fluent in French by now!! <#> Do you have much free time, or is your course pretty full? <#> I hope the work isn't too stressful. </p><p> <#> Well, you haven't missed too much back here! <#> You 'll be glad to hear that Treacy has been in much better form recently, and I think she 's getting back to her old self, with a much more positive outlook on life. <#> As you 've probably heard, she has had 2 <quote> " brief encounters" </quote> with Walter, but I honestly believe that they have done her more good than harm. <#> She said that she just needed to feel <quote> 'wanted' </quote> again, and snogging Walter was just a way of fulfilling this. <#> At first, I was a bit worried, thinking that she might just want to become > }> <-> dependant </-> <+> dependent </+> </}> on some-one, or get upset over Walter again, but she hasn't at all. <#> She says that she realises that she just doesn't feel the way that she used to about Walter - and she 's completely emotionally detached. <#> In fact it 's quite ironic, as now Walter seems to want her back, and she 's having none of it!! <#> How life can change. </p><p> <#> You probably also heard that Ronan was not too pleased about Walter and Treacy snogging, but I think that he 's got so used to protecting Treacy, that he was just worried about her - and it may also have been a case of the old green-eyed monster! <#> Anyway, it 's all fine now. </p><p> <#> Leah has also got a lovely new man - she seems really happy. <#> Dermot is now snogging Laurie on a regular basis - could our bachelor end up in a relationship? <#> And poor S.J. hasn't had an easy time with Jim having a new girlfriend. <#> But she deserves better - and I 'm sure she 'll find someone else soon. </p><p> <#> As for myself - the same as usual. <#> Bob - even though he 's not the most animated of people - is fine, and we 're getting on pretty well. <#> So far so good! <#> I 've been doing a bit of backing singing for Saibh 's band 'The Holsteins'. <#> It 's been good crack! </p><p> <#> Well Aoife, I 'm looking forward to seeing you <ul> very </ul> soon, and apologies for not writing sooner - but you 're always in my thoughts and prayers. </p><p> <#> So be good, Take care and A bient&/\ot, <#> Lots of love, <ul> Deirdre </ul> xoxo </p></I><I><W1B-007$D><h> <#> Sun 30th April </h><p> <#> Dear Aoife, <#> As promised I will try and write you something sensible and coherent to wish you good luck in studying and welcome back to Louvain-la-Neuve. <#> I hope your journey wasn't too stressful, anyway a bottle of 'Pisang' should clear any post travel nerves! <#> Well on Saturday night we showed Julia the high points of Laverys - which weren't really very high at all and I think I must have had a bad drink because I came home and puked all night and even when I went to Mass at 1.00 I had to leave the church and go into the loo and puke! <#> I 'll definitely have to go to Confession now! - <h> <ul> <#> Mon Morn </ul> </h> <#> Julia has left and I 'm on the 5th floor of the library and my expos&/e is tomorrow so I 'm absolutely terrified, and I 'm going to do some work! </p><p> <#> See you soon. <#> We miss you already. <#> Emma xoxo </p></I>
