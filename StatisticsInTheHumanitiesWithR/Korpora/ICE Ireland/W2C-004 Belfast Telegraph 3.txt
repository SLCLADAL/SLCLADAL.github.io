<W2C-004 Belfast Telegraph 3><I><W2C-004$A><h> <#> RUC denies bias claim <#> Oliver McGuckin </h><p> <#> Police efforts to deal with loyalist terrorism were today vehemently defended by RUC Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Annesley. </p><p> <#> Rejecting suggestions that police were less vigorous in their pursuit of loyalists than in the fight against the IRA, Sir Hugh said such a charge was <quote> "neither accurate or fair" </quote> . </p><p> <#> In a strong statement issued from RUC headquarters, he added: <quote> "The proof of our impartiality and professionalism lies in the facts: the arrests which have been made, the charges which have been preferred, and in our absolute determination to counter all terrorism without fear or favour." </quote> </p><h> <#> Operations </h><p> <#> His remarks came after the sectarian murders of four Catholics in the past nine days. </p><p> <#> The death of the latest victim - 40-year-old hairdresser Sean Hughes in west Belfast yesterday - led to calls by local MP Dr Joe Hendron for more high-profile operations by the security forces in loyalist areas. </p><p> <#> Stressing that the threat from both loyalist and republican paramilitaries remained very serious, Sir Hugh called on the public to use its <quote> "eyes and ears" </quote> to help save lives. </p><h> <#> Targets </h><p> <quote> <#> "In both communities there are terrorists meeting and plotting outrages, using cars and houses, moving about and acting suspiciously in various ways. <#> Be vigilant and tell us what you see and hear." </quote> </p><p> <#> Referring again to accusations of a one-sided approach by police, he declared: <quote> "From where we stand murder is murder. <#> There is no excuse, no nods and winks, no legitimate targets. <#> Murder is murder." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Chief Constable said 26 of the 45 deaths from violence so far this year were attributable to loyalists. <#> The total number killed was 16 fewer than at the same time last year. </p><h> <#> Equipment </h><p> <quote> <#> "To date this year there have been 172 bomb incidents, 54 fewer than in the same period last year. <#> Republican terrorists were responsible for 142 (83 pc) and loyalist terrorists for 30 incidents (17 pc)." </quote> </p><p> <#> The security forces had seized 130 firearms, some 10,000 rounds of ammunition and approximately 32,500 lbs of explosives and bomb-making equipment. </p><p> <quote> <#> "That is a substantial achievement which represents lives saved and massive destruction prevented." </quote> </p><h> <#> Arrests </h><p> <#> Police had also charged 259 people with terrorist-type offences. <#> Of these, 166 were loyalists and 93 republicans. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Without going into detail, for legal reasons, I can say that in respect of both republican and loyalist terror groups, a series of significant arrests have been made and a considerable number of murder and bombing missions intercepted and prevented. <#> As a consequence, more lives were saved and intended devastation frustrated." </quote> </p><p> <#> In Belfast - where 19 murders have occurred this year (15 by loyalists and 4 by republicans) - some of the <quote> "most significant" </quote> arrests have been made. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Every possible measure, both overt and covert, is being taken," </quote> the Chief Constable said. </p></I><I><W2C-004$A><h> <#> Hospital cleared at inquest <#> Oliver McGuckin </h><p> <#> Hospital staff were not in any way to blame for the tragic death of a nine-day-old baby boy from west Belfast, an inquest has been told. </p><p> <#> Stephen Martin Phillips, of Glenalina Park, died from a very rare infection of the umbilical cord. </p><p> <#> Belfast Coroner 's Court heard the baby was re-admitted to hospital six days after his mother gave birth by caesarian section on January 18 last. </p><h> <#> Witness </h><p> <#> Anne Marie Phillips fought back tears as she told how she had repeatedly warned staff at the Royal Maternity Hospital that she <quote> "did not like the look of the baby 's belly button" </quote> , which was swollen and discoloured. </p><p> <#> Witness said she was told not to worry and that her son would be fine. </p><p> <#> Mrs Phillips said the baby did not settle when they were allowed to go home and she expressed continuing concern to a community midwife. </p><p> <#> After being taken into the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children on January 24, the infection had spread and Stephen was put on a course of antibiotics. </p><h> <#> Died </h><p> <#> When doctors told her early on January 26 that the baby was seriously ill and was being taken to theatre for an operation, she asked them: <quote> "How come you left it so late?" </quote> </p><p> <#> Stephen died in his mother 's arms early the following day. </p><p> <#> Mrs Phillips ' sister Bernadette Morrow, told the inquest that the death had left her and her family feeling that Stephen had been neglected. </p><p> <#> She said her own two children were delivered at the Royal Maternity Hospital, but she would be afraid to entrust any other children to the hospital 's care. </p><p> <#> Consultant paediatrician Dr Mark Reid, who carried out a report on the baby 's death, said he felt all the doctors involved had given consistent and correct advice. </p><p> <#> While he could understand the <quote> "natural anger and grief" </quote> of the child 's parents, he did not believe that medical negligence was a factor in Stephen 's death. </p><p> <#> Dr Reid added that it would have been difficult to suggest any change in the administration of antibiotics. </p><p> <#> Deputy State Pathologist Dr Derek Carson said the death was due to an infection of the abdominal wall which had spread from the stump of the umbilical cord. </p><h> <#> Sympathy </h><p> <#> Dr Carson described it as a <quote> "very rare" </quote> cause of death and said that neither he nor his colleagues had ever seen cases with such severity of infection of the umbilical cord. </p><p> <#> Coroner John Leckey, extending his sympathy to the Phillips family, said many of the questions that had sprung to his mind had been answered. </p><p> <#> He believed there was nothing that medical science could have done to have changed the tragic outcome. </p></I><I><W2C-004$B><h> <#> Sealink sails into row <#> Darwin Templeton </h><p> <#> A war of words erupted today after Stena Sealink claimed victory in the three-way battle of the waves over the critical summer peak period. </p><p> <#> Representatives for Seacat and P <*> ampersand </*> O issued blunt replies after Sealink claimed to have left its rivals trailing in its wake over the summer. </p><p> <#> Sealink released figures for their performance from June 27 to August 28, claiming that it carried 38,493 more passengers and 10,818 more cars between Larne and Stranraer than last year. </p><p> <#> That represented 12 pc more passengers and 17 pc more cars, increasing their overall market share to 55.6 pc in both. </p><p> <#> But a spokesman for P <*> ampersand </*> O accused Sealink of being selective in their choice of dates, saying: <quote> "Two months don't make a year. <#> We have carried 25 pc more passengers and 34 pc more cars in the year from January 1 to the end of August - that is what counts." </quote> </p><p> <#> And a Seacat spokesman said: <quote> "Our market share is a very satisfactory 24 pc. </p><p> <#> But for Seacat the Northern Ireland public would still be travelling in mundane vessels and having to pay a hefty price for the privilege." </quote> </p><p> <#> But Sealink did admit that their numbers had fallen over the nine months from January 1 to Monday of this week, by 20,755 passengers and 9,644 cars. </p><p> <#> Sealink estimates that the market as a whole grew by 16.2 pc in terms of passengers and by 16.5 pc in cars between January 1 and Monday. </p><p> <#> <quote> "Whilst we did loose volume slightly at the start of the year, we have outperformed our competitors during the vital summer peak period," </quote> a Sealink spokesman said. </p></I><I><W2C-004$C><h> <#> He Deserved It - TD <#> Suzanne Rodgers </h><p> <#> Donegal TD Jim McDaid today welcomed the three-month sentence handed out to his teenage son for making hoax bomb telephone calls in London. </p><p> <#> But the Fianna Fail Deputy, who is no stranger to controversy, said the scandal could have serious repercussions on his political career. </p><p> <#> Mr McDaid 's 19-year-old son, Jason, was given a three-month sentence at Camberwell Magistrates 's Court yesterday when he pleaded guilty to making two hoax calls warning of a bomb in Oxford Street from a kiosk. </p><p> <#> The court heard that he made the calls after a drinking spree celebrating his nineteenth birthday three weeks ago. <#> He was arrested within minutes of making the calls. <#> He has been in custody since. </p><p> <#> Mr McDaid, a medical doctor in Letterkenny, who is TD for Donegal North-East, said: <quote> "He deserves the punishment he has been given. <#> The whole family must suffer the consequences of an absurd and stupid act." </quote> </p><h> <#> Adverse </h><p> <quote> <#> "It was an outlandish, absurd and unbelievable thing for an intelligent young man to do," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> Deputy McDaid has conceded that the incident could have an adverse affect on his political career. </p><p> <#> Mr McDaid was at the centre of another controversy in November 1991 when he was appointed Minister of Defence by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. <#> But he withdrew his own nomination less than 12 hours later when his involvement with Maze escaper James Clarke became public. </p><p> <#> Deputy McDaid had given alibi evidence at Clarke 's successful challenge to an extradition order and was photographed with him at his home-coming celebrations in Letterkenny. </p></I><I><W2C-004$D><h> <#> How the young in Ulster compare <#> Ian McTear </h><p> <#> Youngsters in Northern Ireland smoke more, drink less and have been offered drugs more often than their British counterparts. </p><p> <#> They also get the largest amount of pocket money in a week - <*> pound sign </*> 5.20, compared with a UK average of <*> pound sign </*> 3.62 - and are most likely to put it in the bank. </p><p> <#> The snapshot of the lifestyles of the province 's youngsters was taken by a survey for The Early Times newspaper, involving 200,000 young readers with an average age of 13 nationwide. </p><p> <#> It revealed Ulster youngsters were the most likely to have been offered drugs (21 pc compared with a national average of 10 pc), were least likely to drink (21 pc compared with 30 pc) but were most likely to smoke (36 pc compared with 18 pc). </p><h> <#> Health </h><p> <#> There was more bad news on the health front as they were the least likely to say they try hard for a healthy diet (37 pc compared with 24 pc). </p><p> <#> They are also unhappiest with their appearance, as only 61 pc were happy with theirs, against a national average of 69 pc. </p><p> <#> On the family front they were the most likely to put their parents in a home (43 pc compared with 29 pc). <#><p> <#> This may be connected to the fact that the youngsters came bottom as far as hugs were concerned, as 57 pc said their parents hugged them compared with a national average of 70 pc. </p><h> <#> Couple </h><p> <#> Traditional values still hold sway as 86 pc of Ulster youngsters thought it was important for a couple to marry before having children, when the national average was 72 pc. </p><p> <#> They were also the most likely to say Dad would not make a good job of being a housewife and should be out at work (57 pc compared to 38 pc). </p><p> <#> They were also the most likely to say the Government does not care about education (92 pc compared with 66 pc). </p></I><I><W2C-004$E><h> <#> Time out to dream of an ideal home <#> Gail Walker </h><p> <#> It didn't take the small but determined palmist, medium and clairvoyant Verran Boswell to tell me I would never afford the 'Dream House' at the Ideal Home Exhibition. </p><p> <#> But she did anyway. <#> With a firm grip on my hand, she pulled me away from a display of hi-tech gadgets and told me I was not going to be a millionairess. </p><h> <#> Rival </h><p> <#> She also mentioned I was going to the dentist next week (correct). <#> I would travel often (debatable) and that I would still end up with a lot of money (probably wrong). </p><p> <#> Ms Boswell, who was born in Ireland but stays on the move, is a veteran of exhibitions and just one of the many attractions on offer. </p><p> <#> Her rival, Madam Lee, at the other end of the King 's Hall, Belfast is another. </p><p> <#> Sandwiched between the pair is a vast array of goods, ranging from the luxurious to the novel, the exorbitantly priced to those selling for a few pounds. </p><p> <#> You could splash out on a kingsize Strata waterbed costing around <*> pound sign </*> 2,800. <#> The firm has already offered Coronation Street romeo Reg Holdsworth one for his honeymoon. </p><p> <#> With the big day looming closer, Richard Middleton, president of the firm 's UK operation, says he expects to hear from Granada TV any day now. </p><h> <#> Marketing </h><p> <#> Or you may want a state-of-the-art aquarium. <#> The brightly-lit hexagonal tanks range in price from <*> pound sign </*> 99 to <*> pound sign </*> 695. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We brought them over from England this week," </quote> said Laurence Cooper, marketing manager of Aqua Design, which is based at Weston-super-Mare. </p><p> <quote> <#> "This is always a good show. <#> The tanks are not difficult to transport and we just hire the tropical fish from a pet shop in Belfast." </quote> </p><p> <#> If the stress of battling your way through the thousands of people milling around 200 stalls gets to you, then try Dove Healthcare Limited 's electronic acupuncture. <#> The machine costs <*> pound sign </*> 170 but is guaranteed to cure 100 problems. </p><p> <#> However, I spent most time with an exhibit that was great fun and completely free - BT 's Videophone. </p><p> <#> The firm has four of them alongside a host of other fascinating phone products on their large stand at the front of the hall. </p><p> <#> You and a friend can give each other a call. <#> Technology at your fingertips and the chance to have a much-needed sit down as well. <#> What more could a girl want? </p><p> <#> A million pounds. </p></I>
