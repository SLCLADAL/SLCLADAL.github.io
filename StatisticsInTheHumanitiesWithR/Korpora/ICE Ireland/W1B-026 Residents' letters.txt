COSTELLO, <#> CHIEF EXECUTIVE. </bold> </p></I><I><W1B-026$F><h> <#> 20th September, 1994 </h><p> <#> Dear Sir/Madam, <#> There have been problems in the recent past in relation to blockages in the drainage network because householders seem to be unclear about responsibility for sewers and drains. <#> The situation is that the Corporation are liable for the maintenance and repairs of public sewers and the carrying out of remedial works as appropriate. </p><p> <#> In the case of private drains they are the responsibility of the householder or householders served by them. <#> Cases frequently arise where drains are blocked or damaged and they may, in very many cases, not be the direct responsibility of the householder where the damage or blockage occurs. <#> Usually several houses are served by a single drainage pipe (a <quote> "combined drain" </quote>). <#> In such cases the Corporation suggest that Residents Associations bring to the notice of their members their joint liability for any charges connected with the clearance of blockages, obstructions or other remedial works. </p><p> <#> While the Corporation do not provide a drains repair or clearance service there are several reputable well established firms who do so. </p><p> <#> Perhaps you would be good enough to bring this matter to the attention of the members of your Association. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <bold> <#> L.
