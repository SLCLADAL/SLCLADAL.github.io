<W2C-018 City Tribune Galway><I><W2C-018$A><h> <bold> <#> Theatre: <quote> 'We don't have the money' </quote> reveal Corpo </bold> </h><h> <ul> <#> BY DECLAN TIERNEY </ul> </h><p> <#> The delay in proceeding with the construction of a theatre for Galway city is down to the fact that Galway Corporation do not have the funding needed to allow the project go to tender. </p><p> <#> Earlier this week Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Michael D. Higgins slammed the corporation for what he described as their lethargic attitude towards providing a theatre - for which <*> pound sign </*> 1.5 million has been sanctioned by his Department. </p><p> <#> But Acting City and County Manager, Joe Gavin said that for the project to go ahead, the local authority had to raise <*> pound sign </*> 750,000 - that being the difference of what the cost of a theatre would be and the grant allocation from the Government. </p><p> <quote> <#> "This is money we do not have and until we have these funds available to us, we cannot go ahead with the theatre". </quote> said Mr. Gavin, who added that the appointment of a fund-raiser would be made next month. </p><p> <#> Once Government sanction was received by the Corporation last year, it was decided to set up a trust with a view to raising the balance so that the project could go ahead. </p><p> <#> Mr. Gavin explained that the Corporation got an architect to give an estimated cost of providing a theatre and this worked out at <*> pound sign </*> 3 million - as this would be out of the reach of the local authority, they asked that the design be <quote> "pruned down". </quote> </p><p> <#> The architect then came up with a plan that would cost <*> pound sign </*> 2.25 million which eliminated a number of aspects to the original design like rehearsal space, a number of offices and also affected the type of finish to the building. </p><p> <quote> <#> "All this took time and now the Corporation, in co-operation with members of the trust, will be meeting to discuss ways of raising the money required to begin the project. <#> Interviews will also be held for the purpose of appointing a fund-raiser," </quote> Mr. Gavin added. </p><p> <#> Minister Higgins warned that if the grant allocation was not taken up this year, it would have to be justified all over again when the Government plans its budget for next year - with the possibility that it might not be approved. </p><p> <#> Mr. Gavin, however, stressed the Corporation 's goodwill towards the project and their anxiety to be in a position to give the go-ahead. <quote> <#> "At the moment we are not in a position to build a theatre", </quote> he said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Galway Corporation is very supportive of the arts and we are endeavouring to ensure that a theatre is provided in the city. <#> We are now taking the next step as we would like to see the theatre put in place", </quote> Mr. Gavin added. </p></I><I><W2C-018$B><h> <bold> <#> Ballybrit defies the odds with <*> pound sign </*> 1.5m. a day gambling spree </bold> </h><h> <ul> <#> BY Ciaran Tierney </ul> </h><p> <bold> <#> Any talk of recession has been banished from the Ballybrit area this week as huge crowds once again flocked to the annual Galway Races . . . with <*> pound sign </*> 1.5million a day being wagered on the course. </bold> </p><p> <it> <#> With the usual gaggle of celebrities, politicians, serious punters, and tricksters, rubbing shoulders with ordinary racing enthusiasts, the annual festival retained its unique atmosphere, with the fine weather of the past two afternoons ensuring bumper crowds again at the race course. </it> </p><p> <#> Aggregate Tote figures have been down each day on last year 's record figures, but it 's been a very successful race meeting with huge sums of money changing hands on the course over the four days so far. </p><p> <#> Indeed, the Galway Races have proved once again that they are virtually recession-proof by managing to attract big crowds once again despite a summer which has seen a significant slump in the number of Irish tourists visiting the West on short breaks, due to the poor weather experienced since May. </p><p> <#> The crowds were down a little on previous years for Wednesday 's Galway Plate but, whether it was the Guinness Hurdle or Ladies Day that attracted them, punters certainly thronged the course yesterday. </p><p> <#> Tote figures for both of the main days, Wednesday and Thursday, have been down considerably on last year - but those in the know have discounted this as a significant trend as bookmakers on the site pulled in over <*> pound sign </*> 1 million in bets on both days. </p><p> <#> Wednesday 's Tote aggregate was <*> pound sign </*> 441,465, down almost <*> pound sign </*> 42,000 on 1992, while yesterday 's aggregate rose to <*> pound sign </*> 489,233, which was down <*> pound sign </*> 64,672 on last year. <#> But with the bookies estimated to have handled approximately two and a half times the amount gambled with the Tote there was no shortage of money in circulation. </p><p> <#> Racecourse manager John Moloney said this morning that he was very happy with the week 's returns so far - and he underplayed the decreases in the Tote aggregates by pointing out that last year 's record figures were due to the fact that the Tote jackpots were carried over from day to day. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We have been very lucky with the weather and Wednesday and Thursday were two wonderful days here," </quote> he said. <quote> <#> "The crowds have held up this year, even though Monday was wet and Tuesday windy. <#> And I would discount the decreases in the Tote, as there was a huge carry-over last year, while the bookmakers on the site have taken in over <*> pound sign </*> 1m both on Wednesday and yesterday (Thursday)." </quote> </p><p> <#> Some pundits joked that a full Cabinet meeting could have been held in the vicinity of Ballybrit earlier this week as there were so many Government Ministers in attendance, including An Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, the Minister for Finance, Bertie Ahern, and Galway 's Minister for justice, Maire Geoghegan Quinn. </p><p> <#> Other well-known personalities to grace Ballybrit with their presence this week included Paul Hill of the Guildford Four and his American wife, Courtney Kennedy; former Miss Ireland Michelle Rocca; and Alan Sugar, the man who owns top English soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, who made the headlines in the Spring when he sacked popular club manager Terry Venables.</p><p> <#> The pattern at Ballybrit, where the crowds are holding up even if there seems to be less cash flowing around, mirrors the pattern for tourism in the West of Ireland this summer. </p><p> <#> According to Regional Tourism Manager Brian Flynn the tourism market has held up pretty well even if there are decreases in some sectors, with the bad weather of the past few months in particular to blame for the slump in the number of Irish tourists visiting the region. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It is very hard to judge crowds of people and whether they vary or not from year to year," </quote> he said yesterday. <quote> <#> "But our business here is certainly as busy as last year. <#> From the races we are getting a feedback that people are more cautious with their money this year and the spending sprees don't seem to be there, even if the numbers have held up this year." </quote> </p><p> <#> He said that the numbers of European and British tourists, and returning emigrants, had held up pretty well or even increased this year, but there was a marked decline in the number of visitors from the home market - with the weather a factor in the reluctance of Irish people to take holidays at home this year. </p><p> <#> Mr. Flynn pointed out that there was a phenomenal growth in tourism between 1988 and last year, and Ireland West Tourism expected to record a modest growth this year. </p></I><I><W2C-018$C><h> <bold> <#> Galway's Rowing Glory! </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> TEAMS and players who enjoy major success on a regular basis would appear to have it all, but one thing they can never appreciate is the sheer euphoria attached to a club winning something which they have strived for decades to achieve. </bold> </p><p> <it> <#> It was apparent when the Republic of Ireland qualified for the World Cup, when Galway hurlers won the All-Ireland in 1980 and when Galway United won the FAI Cup two years ago. </it> </p><p> <#> The ecstasy associated with such successes is one of the greatest joys in sport and so it was at the weekend when Galway Rowing Club captured the Irish Senior Championship for the first time since the club was formed in 1910. </p><p> <#> It was an achievement which the club have been striving for over eighty years to attain and one which, apart from a close effort in 1974, was always outside their scope. </p><p> <#> But this season was different. <#> Five oarsmen - Luke Nolan, Tom Elwwod, Kevin Garvey, Sean Heaney and Malcolm Hosty - joined the club having tasted senior glory with UCG in 1991 with Nolan, Garvey and Hosty having also been on the victorious UCG '88 crew. </p><p> <#> The Elite crew was completed by Adrian McCallion, Conor Moloney, Vincent Breen and cox Martin Forde. <#> They were the nine chosen during the season after the club had initially put two eights crews on the water. </p><p> <#> Training under the guidance of Mike Hackett and his assistant Myley McGrath began in October and from then to last weekend 's finals the crew trained over 300 times. </p><p> <#> Over 300 training sessions for a race that lasted little over five minutes clearly puts into perspective the amount of dedication required to succeed at the highest level in Irish rowing. </p><p> <#> The crew trained five nights a week in the gym for the first four months and took to the water twice on Saturdays and once on Sundays. </p><p> <#> The early season training centred around weights training in the gym and long-distance running ... usually about an hour a night ...as well as gruelling hill running. </p><p> <#> Towards the end of January the crew were able to take to the water for short periods in the evenings (with the help of a bicycle light on the front of the boat!) before the Head season began. </p><p> <#> By April it was time for speed work in the water with the crew usually putting in around eight training sessions a week. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We were improving all year. <#> We were getting faster all the time. <#> We rowed well in Henley without winning and we went into the finals knowing we had a great chance. </p><p> <quote> <#> "But while the training deserved success, you don't win unless you perform on the day. <#> When we won it was a case of relief first before the elation took over. <#> We have now broken the barrier," </quote> said coach Mike Hackett. </p><p> <#> GRC went into the National Championships as favourites to win the Elite V111, a tag which was earned after several splendid regatta performances around the country all season. </p><p> <#> But it was also apparent from the outset that this was going to be one of the most open finals in years with Neptune, Belfast, Trinity and a composite from Cork/Clonmel/Shannon all in line for the title. </p><p> <#> The draw for the two semi-final heats threw up a dramatic selection with four of the top five crews being drawn in the same heat and only three could qualify for the final. </p><p> <#> And what a race the heat turned out to be. <#> GRC, stroking 47 at the start, build up a lead of a canvas after 300 metres and after levelling out at a rate of 37 just one boat length separated the four leading boats at the halfway stage. </p><p> <#> But GRC always held the edge and were never really in danger of losing the race. <#> In the end they had half a length lead from Neptune with just a canvas separating Belfast from composite Cork/Clonmel/Shannon boat. </p><p> <#> That heat win gave GRC the prime station in the middle of the course for the final with Tribesmen, Trinity, Neptune, Belfast and UCD spread either side of them. </p><p> <#> The moment of truth had arrived for Galway Rowing Club. <#> A club which had waited over eighty years were now just over five minutes away from becoming the best in the country. </p><p> <#> It was a challenge that was met head-on and within 100 metres it was obvious that Galway were going to win the Irish Challenge Cup. </p><p> <#> Galway 's position in the middle of the course allowed them keep a close eye on all that was happening and with stroke Malcolm Hosty using all of his vast experience, GRC commanded the race from start to finish. </p><p> <#> A 20 stroke spurt at 500 metres gave them a three-quarters length lead over Belfast and at the halfway stage they still maintained that lead, although Neptune had pulled level with Belfast by that stage.</p><p> <#> GRC came in with a length and a half to spare over Neptune in a very fast time of 5:35, four seconds clear of their arch Dublin rivals with Belfast a canvas behind in third place. </p><p> <#> Their success has now seen them elevated to represent Ireland in the Home Countries championships in Strathcyde in Scotland when they will contest the final against England, Scotland and Wales. </p><p> <#> And also on the international front, Sean Heaney has been selected to attend a two week training camp in Sweden. <#> Six oarsmen from around the country have been selected with four of them to be picked to contest the World Championships in September. </p><p> <#> The international selections are highly appropriate, coming at the end of the most glorious week in Galway Rowing Club 's illustrious history. </p></I>
