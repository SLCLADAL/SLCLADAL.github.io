<W1B-021 Belfast business 5><I><W1B-021$A><h> <#> October 1993 </h><p> <#> Dear Colleague <#> CAR PARKING PERMITS 1993-1994 <#> Please find enclosed your car park permit. </p><p> <#> Please note: <#> a) That the pressure for car parking spaces within the University estate is still at a premium and, as a result, the possession of a permit does not guarantee that a parking space will always be available. <#> b) That because the demand for places varies from car park to car park, adjustments have had to be made to the number of permits issued in respect of several of the car parks. <#> It is therefore possible that the permit issued is different from that you requested. <#> c) That permits are only valid for the car park they are issued for, and in the name of those who apply. <#> They are not transferable. <#> Deviation from this rule will result in the withdrawal of the privilege to hold a parking permit. <#> Please note that the permit remains the property of the University. <#> d) That as only one parking permit is being issued to each applicant, staff using another vehicle as a temporary expedient should make arrangements, in advance, with the Security Supervisor if they wish it to be admitted to a University car park. <#> e) That staff normally based in buildings remote from the Main Site, who wish to gain access to the Main Site or College Park car park to attend stated committee meetings should make arrangements in advance with the Security Supervisor. <#> Such cars will be admitted if space permits. <#> Special arrangements will be made for meetings of Senate, Academic Council and Faculties. <#> f) That members of staff who are expecting visitors on official business are reminded that they must inform the Security Supervisor at least two hours before their visitors wish to gain admission. <#> g) That members of staff who have received permits for the Biology, Fitzwilliam, MBC or Chlorine Gardens car park for the first time should contact Mr M Haddon, Security Supervisor, on Ext 5067 to obtain a magnetic barrier key. <#> He will require a <*> pound sign </*>5 refundable deposit. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <#> W R Williams <#> Assistant Secretary, General Services </p></I><I><W1B-021$B><h> <#> 27 July 1992 </h><p> <#> Dear John, <#> I am pleased to tell you that the Arts Council has recommended a grant of <*> pound sign </*>300 in respect of the fees for musicians performing in Ballad 92. </p><p> <#> This will be payable on you returning this form and on you submitting a short report and breakdown of actual income and expenditure for the event; this will be taken as an application for possible further funding. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <#> CIARAN CARSON <#> LITERATURE/TRADITIONAL ARTS OFFICER </p><p> <#> I accept the above terms. <#> SIGNED..............................
