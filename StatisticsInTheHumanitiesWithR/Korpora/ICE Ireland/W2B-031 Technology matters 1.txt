<W2B-031 Technology matters 1><I><W2B-031$A><h> <bold> <#> A view of the future </bold> </h><p> <#> The future of home entertainment is here with the launch of Philips CD-I. </p><p> <#> The new CD-based home entertainment system combines CD quality audio with video, text, animation and graphics - all under the viewer 's interactive control. </p><p> <#> Bright, entertaining and always informative, CD-I titles are suitable for all the family. <#> Children and adults can actively learn from the television by interacting with programmes instead of sitting passively and just watching. </p><p> <#> Parents will see the ease with which children - even the youngest - can play and learn from the titles using the colourful Roller Controller remote control, specially designed for small hands. </p><p> <#> But it is not just for children. <#> It is now possible to tour the Smithsonian museum, play the world 's greatest golf courses, tour the USA and teach yourself how to take 35mm photos - all without moving from your armchair! </p><p> <#> There are four main categories - children 's music, games and special interest and currently retail from between <*> pound sign </*> 14.95 and <*> pound sign </*> 39.95. </p><p> <#> The CD-I machine will also play ordinary audio CDs and photo CDs (<}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> now possible to put your snaps onto a <}> <-> comapct </-> <+> compact </+> </}> disc and view them on television). </p><p> <#> As with audio CD-audio, CD-I is a worldwide standard backed by the three largest electronics manufacturers - Philips, Sony and Matsushita (Panasonic and Technics) and supported by over 200 other hardware and software companies. </p><p> <#> Similar in look and design to a standard CD-audio player, it is easily connected to any television. <#> The titles are managed with a simple thumbstick controller. </p><p> <#> There are currently around 45 titles available, with four to five new releases scheduled each month. </p><p> <#> The CDI-205 is <*> pound sign </*> 499, including a <*> pound sign </*> 20 software voucher and is available from Gilmores Electrical, Lisburn Road, Belfast. </p></I><I><W2B-031$B><h> <bold> <#> Now Joe Public is in the picture </bold> </h><p> <#> the new CX6 palm sized camcorder from Mitsubishi is packed with features that are designed to help rather than confuse customers. </p><p> <#> Combining a unique "foolproof" operation with technical innovation (including the colour Truefinder which gives a full colour viewfinder with the sharpness until now only seen with monochrome) the CX series is poised to set new standards by including features that produce real customer benefits. </p><p> <#> Launched in time for Christmas (over 250,000 customers will be buying camcorders this year) the CX6 is set to be a winner with both customers and dealers.</p><p> <#> The CX series has been improved as a result of extensive market research into what first time camcorder users want and need from a camera.</p><p> <#> The research looked at the type of situation in which the camcorder owner would be most likely to use the camera. </p><p> <#> They found most buyers are looking for a camcorder that is easy to use, prevents the common mistakes and most important of all, produces really good results. </p><p> <#> Consequently the CX6 has useful features which include: </p><p> <#> <*> bullet point </*> Auto shut off - so there should be no more shots of the ground or moving feet if the CX6 is left running accidentally. </p><p> <#> <*> bullet point </*> Different 'event' settings for parties, sunsets, golf, night illuminations, skiing, portraits and sports. <#> These automatically compensate for difficult filming conditions that are present in these situations. </p><p> <#> <*> bullet point </*> The Colour Truefinder which gives the user a viewfinder that combines, for the first time, the sharpness of black and white with full, clearly defined colour. </p><p> <#> <*> bullet point </*> Easily accessible operating buttons. <#> Making it easier for first time users to locate and use the controls. </p><p> <#> <*> bullet point </*> Quick start. <#> The CX series have a recording start time of 0.3 seconds so there is less chance of missing any of the action. </p></I><I><W2B-031$C><h> <bold> <#> Capturing Christmas </bold> </h><p> <#> CS SUPPLIERS have all the latest exciting electrical goods to give your loved ones this Christmas. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Obviously at this time of the year there is a lot of interest in camcorders,"</quote> said Raymond Mulholland at the Royal Avenue store. <quote> <#> "People want to capture their youngsters on film at Christmas." </quote> </p><p> <#> The shop 's two main makes are JVC and Canon and cost approximately <*> pound sign </*> 500 to <*> pound sign </*> 600. </p><p> <#> Palmcorders are also gaining popularity and at around <*> pound sign </*> 500 to <*> pound sign </*> 600 the benefit of these is their size. <#> Easier to carry, they are the size of an ordinary still camera. </p><p> <#> Overtaking the midi hi-fi and Mr Mulholland is predicting that sales of these this year will eclipse the midi. </p><p> <#> The most popular buys are Pioneer, Aiwi, JVC and Sharp. <#> Smaller than this again is the micro, at half the size it costs around <*> pound sign </*> 299. </p><p> <#> If you are thinking about satellite this Christmas it is advisable to buy this month rather than leaving it too close to Christmas said Mr Mulholland. <#> Sales are increasing but it is getting harder to get them he said. </p></I><I><W2B-031$D><h> <bold> <#> Scanner one of the most advanced </bold> </h><p> <#> A new <*> pound sign </*> 500,000 CT Scanner, one of the most advanced in Northern Ireland, has been commissioned at Antrim Hospital. </p><p> <#> It is part of an enlarged radiology department at the hospital, which will welcome its first patients this month. </p><p> <#> For patients, the new department signals the end of transfers to Belfast and Londonderry, for some radiology services. </p><p> <#> While there will continue to be X-ray services available at both the Moyle and Waveney sites, the more involved radiology services, such as CT scanning, will be cantered at Antrim. </p><p> <#> This enlarged department at Antrim will be staffed by six radiologists, led by Dr Colin Sinclair, from the Waveney who has also been appointed clinical director for the Radiology Directorate of the United Hospitals Group from April 1 1994. </p><p> <#> Dr Sinclair said: <quote> "I am delighted that we will be able to provide an enhanced radiological service to all the Northern Board 's residents, especially with the introduction of a CT Scanner. </p><p> <#> "This is a particularly useful piece of equipment, especially for showing up early signs of conditions such as cancer and lung disease, as well as being beneficial in the examination of those patients involved in traffic accidents where scanning can quickly show up damage to internals organs, particularly the brain and spinal cord." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Toshiba CT Scanner was supplied and installed by Medical Imaging (NI) Limited. </p></I><I><W2B-031$E><h> <bold> <#> A twin track strategy for industrial growth </bold> </h><p> <#> The Engineering Employers Federation represents the interests of <*> pound sign </*> 5,000 companies in all sectors of the UK engineering industry - the backbone of the British manufacturing. </p><p> <#> The industry is one of Northern Ireland 's largest exporters and employers. </p><p> <#> The main themes of the EEF 's industrial strategy include: The importance of industry for recovery of the whole economy; the need for improved Government-industry dialogue and mutual understanding; education and training; investment, not only in industry but throughout the economy; and export support. </p><p> <#> The strategy proposals address the three groups responsible for the UK 's industrial future; industry itself, Government, and to the financial institutions. <#> But included messages for all politicians, policy advisers and those involved in education and training at all levels. </p><p> <#> Unemployment is increasing by the day, businesses are closing at an alarming rate and confidence is at an all time low. <#> The UK economy is in immediate trouble because its manufacturing base is too small. <#> That is why there is a balance of trade deficit even while the country is deep in recession, warned the EEF <#> The UK needs a twin-track strategy for economic growth, says director general Neil Johnson. </p><p> <#> The two elements are immediate action to rectify the balance of payments and continuous long term development of technology and industry. </p><p> <#> Engineering and manufacturing form the basis on which everybody 's prosperity depends. <#> Most economic growth, even in service industries, originates in technological innovation from the manufacturing industry. </p><p> <#> To maintain our standards of living we need to revive industrial innovation. <#> To do that we need a vision of what is possible and how it can be achieved - an industrial strategy. </p><p> <#> The chief purpose of an industrial strategy is to develop strategic thinking about national industrial affairs. <#> It provides a common background of knowledge and understanding for individual decision makers. <#> Industrial strategy is not about Government intervention, but government does have a crucial role in stimulating and <}> <-> co-ordinting </-> <+> co-ordinating </+> </}> strategic thinking. <#> Industrial strategy is an essential counterpart to macroeconomic policy. </p><p> <#> The main items on the EEF 's agenda for an industrial strategy include:<p> <#> Encourage internationally mobile investment to locate in and remain in the UK. </p><p> <#> Government to provide effective, timely and internationally competitive export finance, local intelligence in export markets and political support for major projects. </p><p> <#> Extend capital allowances for plant and machinery permanently to 100pc. </p><p> <#> Develop strategic thinking in industry and government. </p><p> <#> Industry to look for organic growth, not just acquisitions. </p><p> <#> Government to take the lead in developing a vision of how industry and technology can be developed to national advantage. </p><p> <#> Industry to provide ideas and information about how industry and technology can be developed to national advantage. </p><p> <#> Shift emphasis from scientific research to technological development. </p><p> <#> Government to maintain continuity of technology support through to full commercial exploitation. </p><p> <#> Central and local government to act as a 'sophisticated and demanding buyer' to develop and stimulate strategic technologies and businesses. </p><p> <#> Pursue the European Fighter Aircraft programme and make a speedy move to production Government to regulate telecommunications, energy and transport industries with a view to technological advance; and to competitiveness of their UK customer and supplier industries. </p><p> <#> Government to assist UK industry to exploit the world market for environmental technology. </p><p> <#> Government to consider the impact on industry of all policy decisions and draft legislation. </p><p> <#> Government to establish effective conduits for industry-government communication, embracing all departments and at all levels. </p><p> <#> Industry to ensure all employees ' performance and development needs are assessed regularly. </p><p> <#> Industry to match world best practice in utilisation of employees ' skills and abilities. </p><p> <#> Industry to increase efforts to show industry 's vital place in society and that it can offer careers that are both rewarding and of social importance.

Belfast were unveiled last week. </p><p> <#> A team of students architects teamed up with local charity Women Too in a unique project aimed at providing the group with plans for a much-needed new home. </p><p> <#> All last week, students attending the European Winterschool for architects at Queen 's University devoted time to the project. </p><p> <#> And the results were revealed during a special ceremony at the group 's current base in Rockview Street, attended by south Belfast MP Martin Smyth. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Women Too has operated up to now with very few resources, but has managed to do an excellent job," </quote> said Mr Smyth. </p><p> <quote> <#> "To convert its operation to a purpose-built centre can only be a huge boost for this part of south Belfast. </p><p> <#> "The group has shown that local people are prepared to do a lot of work to improve their area and have shown the way to people in the rest of the city." </quote> </p><p> <#> Women Too is a community activated, woman-driven organisation, helping regenerate the Blackstaff ward in inner-city south Belfast. </p><h> <bold> <#> Derelict </bold> </h><p> <#> At its small premises in Rockview Street it provides education and training for women of all ages, creche facilities and an advice centre. </p><p> <#> The new centre will be located at Broadway in the heart of the Blackstaff ward in the Village area, on the site of five derelict houses. </p><p> <#> The <*> pound sign </*> 250,000 development will have five classrooms, a purpose-build computer centre, a creche with an adjoining sleeping room and areas for private advice workshops. </p><p> <#> Joy Poots, joint co-ordinator of Women Too, said they are delighted with the plans and the model for the new centre. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Because we worked closely with the architects last week we were able to say exactly what our needs were able to come up with feasible designs," </quote> she explained. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The project came about when the Belfast Action Tem was asked to recommend a project for the annual winter school and it suggested us." </quote> </p><p> <#> Thursday 's presentation was made by Sheelagh McManus of Matrix and Mary Kelly of Glasgow Housing Co-operatives, who helped to organise the winter school </p><h> <bold> <#> Identified </bold> <h><p> <#> Local architect Susan Crowther was also involved in the planning. <#> She has worked closely with Women Too since last year and will continue to liaise with the members through the building of the new centre. </p><p> <#> Women Too opened Windsor Women 's Centre in 1990, after the Blackstaff Community Health Profile report clearly identified a need for such a facility in the area. </p><p> <#> As a result of the findings the Windsor Steering Group was established, made up of local people, and Women Too was an off-shoot of that committee. <#> The two groups still work closely together. </p><p> <#> Majella McCloskey, who worked on the health profile, believes the new centre can only serve to help the needs of the Village. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We have worked closely with Women Too since the group started three years ago," </quote> she said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The area is under threat from many problems such as poor housing, poverty, unemployment and health. </p><p> <#> "Having a new centre at Broadway in the heart of the community will be a great help." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Rockview Street centre is a two-up, two-down house which has become too cramped for the range of services Women Too wants to offer. </p><p> <#> Around 40 women currently use the centre on a regular basis and the creche has to cater for up to 30 children. </p></I>
