<W1A-012 Tag questions><I><W1A-012$A><h> <#> TAG QUESTIONS AS IN SPOKEN NORTHERN IRELAND INTERVIEWS </h><h> <#> STEP BY STEP ACCOUNT OF THE PROJECT. </h><h> <#> 1. DECIDING THE TOPIC </h><p> <#> In order to get some ideas of what topic I could use for my project, I went <}> <-> throught </-> <+> through </+> </}> my course text books and class notes from the areas we had covered in class. <#> These gave rise to several ideas eg. The Four Maxims of Speech, or the use of and difference between "between" and "through". <#> However, the subject of tag questions has always interested me and so I have used this opportunity to study the topic further. </p><h> <#> 2. EXPANDING THE IDEA </h><p> <#> I took my ideas to my tutor, Dr J Kirk, who made various suggestions which we discussed together. <#> One of these was that I could consider the topic of questions as a whole, that is including all types of questions (yes/no questions, wh- questions, declarative questions, and tag questions.) <#> However I decided that in the time space available, it would not be either practical or possible to do an adequately detailed analysis of the subject. </p><h> <#> 3. THE DATA </h><p> <#> The next thing to consider was data - what type of data I wanted, how I could get it, how much I should collect. <#> I decided to use Northern Irish media as a source for my unrecorded data and Dr Kirk suggested the Northern Ireland Corpus of Transcribed Speech for my already recorded data. <#> He volunteered to make a concordance for me from his computer files of possible tag questions, and provided me with this in both computer print out and cassette tapes. </p><h> <#> 4. RECORDING AND USING THE DATA </h><p> <#> I researched into the names of the Northern Irish TV and radio presenters and the times of their shows and proceeded to tape the following programs: <#> Gerry Anderson 10.12.92, 14.12.92 <#> George Jones 9.12.92, 10.12.92, 14.12.92, 15.12.92, 23.12.92 <#> John Kelly 10.12.92, 15.18.92, 18.12.92 <#> Rose Neill 10.12.92, 15.12.92 <#> Sean Rafferty 10.12.92, 15.12.92 <#> It was at this point that I decided not to record any more TV programs, because I had no TV in my flat in Belfast and could only record on weekends when I went home. </p><p> <#> After listening to the recordings I decided to concentrate <}> <-> ononly </-> <+> on only </+> </}> one presenter rather than on all five. <#> I chose George Jones because: <#> 1. he had a wide ranges of guests on his program, ranging from eight year old school children to AA traffic reporters. <#> So a whole range of sex, age and social background was covered. <#> 2. His was the only program to have a majority of interviews with N. Ireland people. <#> The others eg. Sean Rafferty had English or Southern Irish celebrities. <#> 3. He also had more tag questions on his program compared to the others. </p><p> <#> I then transcribed the five George Jones tapes - tapes 1 and 2 I transcribed fully to give an idea of the frequency of <}> <-> occurances </-> <+> occurrences </+> </}> of tag questions in conversation. <#> Tapes 3, 4 and 5, I only gave a short paragraph to identify context. </p><p> <#> I then listed 50 tag questions found in these tapes. <#> (The amount had been predecided on the advice of Dr Kirk.) </p><p> <#> I then went through the NITC (Northern Ireland Transcribed Corpus of Speech) concordance and listed the 16 tag questions found in it. </p><h> <#> 5. RECORDING INTONATION </h><p> <#> I went through my own five tapes of George Jones programs and a further fifteen tapes from the NITC and recorded the intonation patterns of the tag questions, that whether they rose (marked and <}> <-> refered <-> <+> referred </+> </}> to as /) or whether they fell (marked and <{> <-> refered <-> <+> referred </+> </}> to as \). </p><h> <#> 6. RESEARCH INTO ARTICLES WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT </h><p> <#> I read the following articles on tag questions: <#> (1) John Algeo, <ul> It 's a myth innit? Politeness and the English Tag Question </ul>. <#> (2) S. Greenbaum, R. Quirk, A Student 's Grammar of the English Language, pp.234-235, <ul> Tag Questions </ul>. 11.6. (Longman, 1990). <#> (3) Siv Nasslin, <ul> The English Tag Question: A Study of Sentences Containing Tags of the Type Isn't it?, Is it? </ul>. Pp. 21-25, 26-35, 36-37, 47-62. <#> (4) University of Ulster, Belfast Working Papers in Language and Linguistics. John M. Kirk, <ul> Tag Questions, Pragmatics, and the Expression of Solidarity in Dramatic Texts </ul>, pp 228-266. <#> (5) Richard A. Hudson, <ul> The Meaning of Questions </ul> pp 1-29 </p><p> <#> The following are brief summaries of (1) - (4). </p><h> <h> (1) JOHN ALGEO </h><p> <#> Algeo 's rather humorous article was to undermine the belief that tag questions used by the British people as a whole were not a polite device, but rather the opposite. <#> He highlights the following five uses of tag questions: <#> 1. Informal Tags; used mainly to ask for information. <#> The speaker values the person to whom he is talking more than at any other time. <#> Speaker asks for information without presuming to know what the hearer will say. <#> It will have a rising intonation. </p><p> <#> 2. Confirmatory Tags; to draw the person addressed into the conversation, the speaker assumes the hearer will agree with the truth of the statement. <#> Is an invitation to express agreement, usually with a falling tone. </p><p> <#> 3. Punctuational Tags; to emphasize the point which the speaker has just made, and asks the hearer to pay attention to the speaker rather than actually participate. </p><p> <#> 4. Peremptory Tags; usually used in response to a statement the speaker does not want to hear or a question he does not want to answer. <#> It usually follows a statement of obvious truth, and tends to be condescending and impatient. <#> The effect of it is to leave the hearer speechless. <#> It is a signal the speaker wants to avoid the subject and considers the conversation at an end. </p><p> <#> 5. Aggressive Tags; follows a statement that is by no means obvious and that the addressee cannot be reasonably expected to know. <#> It is insulting and provocative. Eg. (his example) <#> A I rang this morning but you didn't answer. <#> B Well, I was having a bath, wasn't I? </p><p> <#> 4. and 5. are part of a response to a question, or an implied question, or a suggestion for action. <#> They are both antagonistic (of two extremes) and oppose cooperative communication. </p><h> <#> (2) R. QUIRK </h><p> <#> The most common type of tag question is one with reversed polarity, in the form of a yes/no question. <#> It consists of an operator and a subject pronoun, a choice of operator and a pronoun, and can have either a rising or falling intonation. <#> Thus there are four main types of tag question sentences; <#> (a) negative statement, positive tag, falling tone <#> (b) negative statement, positive tag, rising tone <#> (c) positive statement, negative tag, falling tone <#> (d) positive statement, negative tag, rising tone </p><p> <#> The meaning of the tag question involved a statement and a question, that is, it asserts something and then invites a response. </p><p> <#> There are two factors involved - ASSUMPTION and EXPECTATION. <#> The first expressed by the statement, the latter by a question. <#> <}> <-> it </-> <+> It <+> </}> is therefore possible to distinguish four types <#> 1) Positive assumption, neutral expectation <*> plus sign </*> <*> minus sign </*> <#> 2) Negative assumption, neutral expectation <*> minus sign </*> <*> plus sign </*> <#> 3) Positive assumption, positive expectation <*> plus sign </*> <*> minus sign </*> <#> 4) Negative assumption, negative expectation <*> minus sign </*> <*> plus sign </*> </p><p> <#> A tag with a rising tone invites verification, while one with a falling tone invites confirmation of the statement. <#> The latter tends to be an exclamation rather than a genuine question, and sometimes the truth is self-evident and no answer is needed. </p><p> <#> The least common type has a positive statement and question, usually with a rising tone and is used sometimes with a tone of sarcastic suspicion. <#> The statement itself is usually <}> <-> proceeded </-> <+> preceded </+> </}> by <quote> "oh" </quote> or <quote> "so" </quote>, indicating the speaker 's arrival at the conclusion by inference or by recalling what has already been said. </p><h> <#> 3) SIV NASSLIN </h><p> <#> In chapter 2, Nasslin uses two analyses by Cattell and Ogawa to discuss Semantic Underlying Structure and Analyses. </p><p> <#> Cattell discusses how APTS (tag sentences) differ because of the different points of view of the speaker. <#> If, he says the tone is falling, the speaker has a confident viewpoint and is inviting agreement; if on the other hand the tone is rising, we see a more tentative advancement of the speaker 's view. <#> He also deals with <{> <-> th </-> <+> the </+> </}> truth value of the proposition, expressed by the speaker in the RC (reference clause). </p><p> <#> In chapter 3 he deals with SC (sincerity conditions), and modifies and develops <}> <-> Rishard </-> <+> Richard </+> </}> Hudson 's article. <#> He lists 4 SC's <#> 1) The speaker believes the propositions is true. <#> 2) The speaker believes that the hearer knows at least as well as he <}> <-> he </-> </}> himself does that/whether the proposition is true or false. <#> 3) The speaker does not express any personal opinion as to the truth of the proposition, he merely reports what other people say. <#> The speaker has only reasons to believe that the hearer/other people or the hearer and other people believe the proposition is true. <#> 4) The speaker wants the proposition, which is that the interlocutor is going to do something, to be true. <#> In the fourth chapter he gives a summary of the discussion of SC's, which is as follows; <#> 1) The rp (reversed polarity) and cp (constant polarity) APTS's have different SC's in their RC's: <#> rp APTS's normally have SC 1) <#> CP APTS's normally have SC 3) </p><p> <#> 2) In a strict interpretation of syntax in the rp De-APST (a declarative with tag) and rp Ex-APTS opposing SC's are arrived at leading to conduciveness, but only as one possible interpretation among others. </p><p> <#> 3) There is ambiguity as to whose opinion is expressed (ie. The <}> <-> interoculator 's </-> <+> interlocutor 's </+> </{> or other people 's) in the RC of the cp APTS as long as <}> <-> pragmatis </-> <+> pragmatic </+> </}> factors are not considered. <#> (The basic or at least most frequent meaning is that the <}> <-> interlocutors </-> <+> interlocutor 's </+> </}> opinion that the proposition is true is expressed. <#> It is also possible that the proposition is both the opinion of the others and the <{> <-> onterlocutor </-> <+> interlocutor </+> </}> .) </p><p> <#> 4) The exhortations, especially the Im-APTS (imperative with tag) differ from cp APTS's with other functions in not having SC's. <#> (It is proposed in present study that the exhortations have an implied RC to which the tag belongs.) <#> The Im-APTS is in reality an Im-De-APTS, whether tag is positive or negative. </p><p> <#> 5) In interrogatives (whether in APTS or independent sentences used as an exclamation.) function of <ul> n't </ul> means to tell us the speaker believes the interlocutor thinks the <}> <-> propositon </-> <+> proposition </+> </{> is true. <#> Prosody tells us that the interrogative is an exclamation. </p><p> <#> 6)An interrogative used as an exhortation gets a tag due to the new SC (SC1. instead of SC2.). <#> This results in a negative cp APTS functioning as a rp APTS. </p><p> <#> 7) Difference between what the negative interrogative (untagged) and the rp APTS express is not due to their having different SC's. <#> It is a result of how the SC's are in balanced relation to each other, ie. which of the SC's is focused on.</p><p> <#> 8) A speaker can pretend that he believes a proposition to be true (SC1), or he can pretend that he is neutral to a proposition (SC 3), and he can pretend that he believes the interlocutor knows at least as well as he himself does whether the proposition is <}> <-> ture </-> <+> true </+> </{> or not (SC 2). <#> The difference in what the speaker pretends leads to different types of <}> <-> iriny </-> <+> irony </+> </}> being used. </p><p> <#> He discusses speaker attitudes and included are the two functions -conduciveness and softening, which are the two basic attitudes of the speaker and whose varieties include impatience, rudeness and assertiveness. </p><h> <#> 4) JOHN KIRK </h><p> <#> The purpose of Dr. Kirk 's article which he based on the Miller and Brown Corpus (MB), was to <quote> "substantiate their claim that, in discourse, tag questions have indeed an interactional value" </quote>. <#> He takes the 8 pragmatic categories which MB proposed and among other things shows the wide range of illocutionary functions of tag questions.(p. 228) <#> The eight categories are as follows; </p><h> <#> CATEGORY A </h><p> <#> Proposition-factual <#> Speaker proposition-speaker is uncertain of truth of <}> <-> propostion </-> <+> proposition </+> </}> <#> Hearer proposition-hearer believes proposition might be true but is less sure <#> Interrogative force-weakly conducive <#> Speaker expectation-to let hearer verify/falsify truth of factual proposition for speaker <#> Effect-hearer may or may not comply <#> Polarity-reversed <#> Intonation-falling </p><h> <#> CATEGORY B </h><p> <#> Proposition-factual <#> Speaker proposition-speaker uncertain of truth of proposition <#> Hearer proposition-hearer believes proposition might be true but is less sure <#> Interrogative force-weakly conducive <#> Speaker expectation-to let the hearer verify or falsify truth of proposition <#> Effect-hearer may or may not comply <#> Polarity-reversed or constant <#> Intonation-rising </p><h> <#> CATEGORY C </h><p> <#> Proposition-nonfactual <#> Speaker proposition-speaker sure of truth of proposition <#> Hearer proposition-hearer believes proposition to be true and/or is prepared to believe it probably is true <#> Interrogative force-strongly conducive <#> Speaker expectation-to inform hearer of his opinion and let hearer express corroboration <#> Effect-hearer may or may <}> <-> nor </-> <+> not </+> </}> express agreement <#> Intonation-falling <#> Polarity-reversed </p><&> Category D, E and F listed </&><h> <#> AN EXPLANATION OF THE QNA ANALYSIS TABLE 1.1 </h><p> <#> Table 1.1 is an accumulation of the three articles which go together to make up Analysis 1, that is, Quirk, Nasslin, and Algeo. <#> There are 6 headings in the table, and I will now go through each one explaining (1) which article it came from and (2)a brief summary of what it means. </p><h> <#> (a) NAME OF TAG </h><p> <#> I took these 5 types of tags from Algeo 's article pp.445-447. <#> To Algeo, tag questions are <quote> "devices by which people relate to one another in the process of a conversation" </quote> and the 5 categories are the 5 main uses of the tag question in conversation. <#> They go from one side of the politeness scale to the other, 1 being very polite, and 5 being extremely impolite. </p><h> <#> (b) INTONATION </h><p> <#> Intonation is dealt with in all 3 articles; Quirk p234, Nasslin p21 and Algeo pp445-446. <#> However, there is only a specific intonation given by Algeo to 1 and 2. <#> The other categories appear to be able to have either a rising or a falling tone. </p><h> <#> (c) MODALITY TYPE </h><p> <#> Nasslin deals with modality in Section 6.3 of his book. <#> The term covers <quote> "both the view on the proposition and attitudes" </quote>. <#> Basically there are 3 types of modality; <#> (1) cognitive - the speaker 's view on the truth of the proposition eg. certainty, uncertainty. <#> (2) volitive - the speaker 's wish to influence the <}> <-> interoculator </-> <+> interlocutor </+> </}>. <#> (3) emotive - this includes softening, reinforcement, surprise, expectation agreement, and others such as interruption or objection.(p60) </p></I>
