<ICE-IRE:S1B-023 Orange Order><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Some have a great day out to watch the parades and listen to the bands <,> but for others at best a non-event <,> at worst an offence to what they hold dear <,> and for all of us a public holiday <#> So today I want to explore the Orange Order <#> It is a body that engenders passions <,> for and against by its very aims and objectives <,> which can be summarised as to uphold the interests of Protestantism throughout the world <#> That might be unremarkable enough <,> except that in this province with its history its divisions its deep wounds and hurts <,> anything that vigorously upholds one side <,> is likely to offend the other <#> Many Orangemen however <,> would sincerely declare that their Order is maligned and misunderstood <#> It 's not disruptive divisive or even anti-Catholic <#> It should be as normal a part of Ulster life as any friendly society <#> The question I pose today is <,> is it possible in Northern Ireland to hold an intelligent conversation about the Orange Order <#> That is to express viewpoints for and against with reason <,> and knowledge and tolerance <,> to accept criticism <,> perhaps be modified by it and at the end peacefully to accept our differences <#> My guests are I think intelligent and informed <#> I look to them to help us find an answer <#> They are Clifford Smyth Orangeman and historian <,> Maurice Hayes former <.> Odbu </.> Ombudsman and Down GAA </&> Secretary <,> Rhonda Paisley artist and former DUP councillor <,> Duncan Morrow lecturer on politics and writer on community relations <,> and in our Radio Foyle studio <,> Dennis Haughey SDLP International Secretary <#> Clifford Smyth <,> do you think as a committed Orangeman that it is possible to talk about this subject without being influenced by our bias<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$B> <#> Well each of us comes to a particular <,> situation or circumstance or indeed institution like the Orange Order <,> uh with certain preconceptions or presuppositions <,> and so uh I 've yet to meet the person who can say I am not biased <#> We all have some kind of <,> of perception of things <#> But perhaps the way into this if we 're in determined to have an intelligent discussion and I uh hope we do <,> is uh a remark that was made to me some years ago which I have pondered over since by Professor John White <#> He was the gentleman who invited me to do <,> the thesis on uh <,> Dr Paisley <#> And in general conversation uh about Northern Ireland he said one of the difficulties Clifford <,> that makes our problems so intense is that we have two lines of cleavage in Ulster not just one <#> He said in Europe people have lines of cleavage over nationality or over religion <,> but he said in Ireland we have two lines of cleavage bosh <&> both </&> <.> na </.> both nationality and religion <#> And the Orange Order manifests <,> uh <.> p </.> uh and expresses our <,> that is the Protestant and British position here in Ireland <#> Uh it manifests it in the form of uh uh religion and to an extent politics but these are matters which we will discuss further<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Denis Haughey you 're outside of this entirely so <,> I mean how do you come to this <#> Do you come to it with a bias or do you come to it without knowing a great deal about it<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$C> <#> Well I don't know a great deal about Orangeism but uh I don't really think that it 's possible to uh <,> to have an unbiased opinion <#> I I always suspect people who proclaim their lack of bias <#> Uhm it 's it 's it uh everything that you perceive you perceive it against the background of your own <,> experience your own thinking your own beliefs <,> and uh how you see things is tends to be coloured by that <#> But I think it is possible to be <,> uh rational about it and uh to uh discuss uh the question <.> wi </.> without giving way to <,> uh one's <{> <[> bias </[> <#> But uh to suggest that uh it is possible to be absolutely free of bias I think is<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Rhonda would you agree with these two <.> tha </.> that the baggage that we bring to us from our conditioning our context our past uh is not so influential as to stop us having an intelligent conversation <,> and hopefully also a good relationship<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$D> <#> Well I would take the opinion that Dennis Haughey isn't the only one outside this <#> There are far more Loyalists in Northern Ireland outside the Orange Order and outside <,> all the trappings of the Twelfth <,> than are inside it <#> So I would very much say that I was also outside it because I 've never been involved in the Twelfth as far as uh membership of <{> <[> anything goes </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$B> <#> <[> It 's it 's not </[> </{> entirely a male sexist organisation though I understand <{> <[> there are women in it </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$D> <#> <[> Well it may as </[> </{> well be because I mean <&> laughs </&> the women are more like bunny girls <#> They don't really do anything very effective <{> <[> within </[> the Orange Order do they<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$B> <#> <[> Well the </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> I wonder would they be flattered to be called bunny girls <{> <[> or insulted </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$D> <#> <[> Well they </[> </{> probably would be <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Duncan<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$B> <#> It 's not my experience I must say that they are bunny girls <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> That oh I 'm not going to identify that voice at all <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$B> <#> My wife is going to hit me over the head over this one<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Duncan<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$E> <#> I think it is clearly true that uh not everybody has a direct experience of the Orange Order from within <,> but it would be difficult in Northern Ireland not to have had <,> some sense of or some experience of the order in its public performance <,> and at that level I suppose we all have our experiences <#> An intelligent conversation I suppose depends on the respect we give the validity of those perceptions of one another <,> and don't in a one sense or another see them as simply competitive but see them as really held perceptions and how we deal with those is the point<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Duncan used the word competitive there and <,> Maurice Hayes you have been secretary of a branch of the GAA <,> and I suppose in public perception some people would see the GAA <,> as not being exactly the other side of the coin from the Orange Order but at least certainly in competition<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$F> <#> I I I wouldn't have thought so except that they 're both extremely conservative organisations <,> and uh conservative organisations generally find it hard to take criticism or scrutiny <,> from either outside or or within so I I suppose they have that much in in in common <#> Uhm <,> uh to go back to the <,> initial point that that you raised yes I I think we all do bring our <,> biases with us <#> Uh I think the effort we have to make is <,> to recognise that it is a baggage <,> and and to try and sort of strip as much of that away from from ourselves before we we start looking at at at other people <#> I I think you looked at from the the outside <,> uhm the uhm <,> Orange Order uh seems to me to have five or six personae uh you know three or four of which are are actually <,> uh very laudable <{1> <[1> and uh extremely <#> Well one or two </[1> mightn't be <,> just as much and I think uh <,> uh the uhm <,> those are the things I think we 'll <{2> <[2> be teasing out </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> <[1> Well some of those which are enjoyable </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> <[2> I I wouldn't </[2> </{2> I wouldn't to have a six point sermon starting right now Maurice so could we <{1> <[1> go on </[1> maybe to the next <{2> <[2> thing </[2> <#> Any intelligent conversation I think we would agree <,> must be based on fact as far as possible <#> And facts about the Orange Order are very likely to be <.> cover </.> coloured <#> So I invited Jonathon Bardon whose recent History of Ulster <,> contained a section on the Order <,> to guide us through the roots and establishment <,> and spread of Orangeism <#> But first I asked him <,> was he without bias<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$F> <#> <[1> Sure </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$F> <#> <[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> The job of the historian is to try to find out just what happened try to provide some explanation uh <,> of course the historian has to make judgements <,> but those judgements are <,> uh based <,> on uh <.> w </.> what he or she observes<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Now sources I <.> me </.> mean what what sources can you use for history of Orangeism <#> Are they not largely <,> from within Orangeism itself and therefore would be giving <,> some kind of uh <,> biased account to begin with<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> Yes certainly uh <,> <.> o </.> on on the other hand you could argue that uh perhaps the Orange Order uh <.> ha </.> <.> ha </.> could release a lot more of its papers uh to to to uh make it possible for more extensive studies to be made <#> But uh <,> the government particularly in the nineteenth century was very paper-minded <,> uh producing enormous reports on the Orange Order for example in eighteen thirty-five volumes and volumes of the stuff <#> And then any time there were riots in Belfast for example <,> uh there tended to be royal commissions of inquiry which again produced maps and volumes and uh evidence from <,> various Grand <{> <[> Masters </[> <#> The sources are there plus uhm <,> the newspaper accounts of Orange activities are extremely detailed <#> I mean we who read uhm tabloids today have no idea of just the the amount of print that you could get through uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> <[> Although </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> Now I suspect that a great number of people listening to us this morning<&> break in recording </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> Of William who is the the ruler of Holland who eventually became uh uh the the King of England <.> wi </.> with his wife <{> <[> Mary </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$C> <#> <[> Did you </[> </{> say the south of France <{> <[> or <,> <#> Well now I mean you 're </[> now talking to one ignoramus because I always thought that Orange had to do with uh Holland <,> but it has to do with the south of France<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> <[> Yes <#> It 's <&French> Orange </&French> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> Well it has to do <.> wit </.> with <.> w </.> <.> w </.> with Holland in in that uh the ruler of Holland uh possessed this piece of land in the south of France<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$C> <#> Well I interrupted you because <{1> <[1> I </[1> couldn't let that go <#> I mean this was so uh <.> in </.> intriguing to <{2> <[2> me </[2> <#> But can can you go on with your story now<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-023$G> <#> Yes and of course uh when King James the Second uh came with French soldiers <,> to uh try to recover his English throne <,> uh and uh <,> uhm <,> upset <.> e </.> effectively the Ulster plantation <,> naturally the the Ulster Protestant settlers <,> were uh indebted to William of Orange who had uh saved them at the Boyne and subsequently uh at uh <,> the Battle of Aughrim which incidentally is the battle fought on the twelfth of July since the battle of the Boyne was fought on the first of July <#> But uh the forming of the Orange Order goes <,> uh forward to the seventeen nineties and then we must go to County Armagh where there were ferocious sectarian struggles between <,> the Peep-O'-Day Boys <,> who were Protestant weavers who got up at the crack of dawn <,> and attacked their Catholic neighbours <,> and the Defenders these were Catholics <,> who they would uh defend their homes and their looms where they were in a minority and they would be <,> uh taking an offensive approach <,> uh uh particularly in South Armagh where they were in a majority <#> And these these uhm <,> struggles became so severe <,> uh that uh quite uh uh extensive uhm <,> fights took place uh various gentlemen and priests and clergy tried to separate the the warring uh factions <#> And uh <,> eventually <,> a a kind of truce was arranged uh between gentlemen and a Catholic priest in in north County Armagh in September of seventeen ninety-five <#> But a contingent of Catholic Defenders coming from County Tyrone didn't hear about the truce <,> and they came ready to take on the Protestant Peep-O'-Day Boys <#> This was proof that the truce had been broken and a a battle took place <,> uh at the Diamond in North Armagh <,> and the Protestants won triumphantly <,> uh killing at least thirty perhaps as many as fifty of the Catholic Defenders <#> And the triumphant Protestants then went off uh and uh to Lough Gall nearby and there they founded uh the Orange Society or the Orange Order<ICE-IRE:S1B-023$A> <#> So this was very much then of the people <#> I mean this sounds like to be of of very much the working-class people they and without real leadership from the top</I>
