<W2B-033 Car matters><I><W2B-033$A><h> <#> A helping <it> hand </it><p> <#> PENTLANDS, Ravenhill Road, Belfast, one of Northern Ireland 's leading Vauxhall dealerships, recognises the indispensable part a car can play in the lives of people with disabilities and their families. </p><p> <#> The dealership specialises in meeting the motoring requirements of disabled people providing expert advice and guidance on how to utilise the Government mobility benefit. </p><p> <#> John Taylor, sales manager at Pentlands, said; <quote> "Statistics show that of those who receive a Government benefit, some 803,000 people do not use it to acquire transport. <#> A vast number of the UK 's disabled population is therefore missing out on the benefits of Motability." </quote> </p><p> <#> He points out that anyone in receipt of the higher mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and the War Pension Mobility Supplement can take advantage of the Motability programme. </p><p> <#> Vehicles acquired through Motability do not have to be driven personally by the recipient of this benefit so the schemes can be used for a child or anyone else unable to drive. </p><p> <#> Pentlands are Motability approved and are also one of the leading Motability dealerships in the Province. <#> Last year, they were awarded second place overall in the UK in the Most Improved Sales of Motability Vehicles category of the motability Awards. </p><p> <#> John Taylor said that there are three acquisitions plans, the most popular of which is contract hire. <#> Under the Vauxhall Motability New Car Contract Hire Scheme, customers exchange their government benefit for a three-year contract which provides a new vehicle and covers all servicing, maintenance and insurance. <#> Dependent on the model chosen, a small one-off payment may be required at the commencement of the contract. </p><p> <#> At present, Pentlands are offering the Corsa Merit diesel and petrol models without a deposit and all Astras come with power steering, engine immobiliser and driver 's airbag as standard. </p><p> <#> Alternatively customers may choose the Vauxhall New Car Motability Hire Purchase Plan and relinquish the benefit over a four or five year period in order to generate a lump sum to finance the purchase of a specially priced car. </p><p> <#> Finally, preferential prices are available through the Vauxhall Mobility Plan, without the need to exchange the Government benefit and the plan can also be used to accommodate people whose DLA award is insufficient to quality for one of the Motability schemes. <#> Lower Rate Mobility Component and Severe Disablement Allowance recipients along with OB holders also qualify for preferential prices through this plan. </p><p> <#> Vauxhall Motors was the first manufacturer to insist that its dealers conformed to a code of conduct aimed at improving service to all Vauxhall Motability customers. </p><p> <#> Pentlands has three fully trained Motability sales consultants - Kathy Murphy, Mike Adair, and Dougie Johnston - and the showroom is fully accessible with wheelchair ramps. </p><p> <#> John Taylor said: <quote> "We can also arrange for a sales consultant to go to your home if you are unable to travel to our showrooms." </quote> </p><p> <#> Pentlands will organise any conversions or adaptations that are required and when the car is delivered ensure that all the necessary checks have been made and oversee all subsequent servicing arrangements. </p><p> <#> The showroom is open from 9am to 8.30pm Monday to Thursday, Friday 9am to 5pm and Saturday 9am to 12.30pm. <#> Why not call Pentlands today at 01232 451422? </p></I><I><W2B-033$B><h> <#> Tip top ragtop </h><p> <#> AUDI has unveiled a new design study, the Audi TTs Toadster at the Tokyo Motorshow, a variation on the Audi TT Coupe theme that stole the show at the IAA in Frankfurt in September. <#> The Audio TTS is based on the Audi TT's quattro running gear. </p><p> <#> The Audi TTS is the work of the same young team of designers and engineers that developed the Audi TT. </p><p> <#> The character of the Audi TTS is based on a principle of reduction. <#> Every detail, both visual and technical has been scrutinised to eliminate the unnecessary and create an effect of substance and maturity. </p><p> <#> This is emphasised by the use of aluminium and the design of handles, mirrors and interior equipment. </p><p> <#> The engine is a 1.8 litre turbocharged unit with five valves per cylinder developing 210 bhp. </p><p> <#> This gives the Audi TTS a projected top speed in the region of 150mph with 0-62mph taking about six seconds. </p><p> <#> The TTS returns an average of below 31.4mpg. </p></I><I><W2B-033$C><h> <&French> <#> Pour votre <it> voiture </it> </&French> </h><p> <#> OUR family business JC Halliday and Sons, has an excellent reputation, well earned by the professional and assiduous attention we pay to the needs of our customers. </p><p> <#> Principal Lex Halliday says: <quote> "In 25 years as a Citroen dealer, making us the oldest in the Province, we have had countless customers who have been delighted with the quality and performance of the product. </p><p> <#> "We specialise in business sales which means that our sales team, headed by sales manager William Gregg, is very familiar with the requirements of the commercial world. </p><p> <#> "Of course, customers buying for personal use will be given equal attention in order to help them decide on a model which best suits their lifestyle and pocket. <#> Talking of which, don't forget that we are also up to date with the funding options and tailor-made finance packages currently available." </quote> </p><p> <#> The after-sales service and facilities at JC Halliday and Sons are second to none. <#> John Jamison, service manager, knows that you need skilled, expert workmanship to keep your vehicle at its peak performance and has total familiarity with all the vehicles in the Citroen range. </p><p> <#> Our comprehensive servicing programme includes diagnostic tuning. <#> Computerised stock control ensures the smooth running of our workshop, and parts manager Alan Greer can offer a speedy resolution to your problems. </p><p> <#> > For your convenience, courtesy cars and service loan cars are also available. <#> In addition, there is a valeting service to keep your vehicle looking as good as new and we carry a good selection of accessories. <#> When you bring your car to us you can be confident that it is in the safest of hands. <#> Ask any of our regular customers! </p><p> <#> All Citroen cars are designed and rigorously developed so that you will enjoy the highest standards of reliable motoring. <#> However, emergencies can arise and it is reassuring to know that help is always on hand. </p><p> <#> That is why all new Citroens from us come with Citroen Assist - a free 12-month roadside assistance and recovery service that operates 24 hours a day 365 days a year. </p><p> <#> A single telephone call - free of charge - puts you through to a National Control Centre where a trained operator will use a computerised network to send the nearest Citroen Assist mobile unit to your aid - normally within the hour. <#> Minor problems like changing of tyres are taken care of on the spot. <#> If the problem is more serious, Citroen Assist will ensure you are taken home or on to your destination and transport your car back to us or to the most convenient dealer for repair. </p><p> <#> The comprehensive service covers any driver, up to three days free car hire and overnight accommodation. <#> There is even cover when you are travelling in Europe. <#> Allow us to explain the scheme to you in detail. <#> We want you to enjoy complete peace of mind when you buy a new Citroen from us. </p><p> <#> Driving a new Citroen has never been more affordable than with Citroen 's flexible new finance scheme, Elect 3. <#> Citroen Elect 3 is all about choice: the choice of the new car you want, the choice of period and mileage, and whether or not to include the route servicing or full maintenance option. <#> Plus there 's a choice of what to do with your car at the end of the agreed two or three-year period. <#> Ask us for full details. </p></I><I><W2B-033$D><h> <#> Don't take <it> our </it> word </h><p> <#> THE Proton pedigree is very much in evidence throughout the Mpi range - whichever you choose, you 're assured of a smooth, reliable and extremely economical drive. </p><p> <#> Don't just take our word for it, though. </p><p> <#> Independently the MP has won numerous awards for quality and value for money including five IBCAM Gold Medals for interior and exterior build quality at three consecutive British International Motor Shows. <#> The BBC Top Gear Magazine's K-Reg Survey elected Proton third, Best Marque for customer satisfaction, leaving 27 other popular marques in its wake. </p><p> <#> A major contribution to this fact is that the MPi comes complete with one of the most outstanding warranty packages around. <#> The Proton Customer Commitment Package includes six year mechanical and bodywork guarantees and a full three-year total vehicle warranty. </p><p> <#> Now what about safety? <#> Don't worry, you 're in a Proton. <#> Which means you 're well and truly protected by a rigid passenger shell, energy-absorbing bumpers, anti-burst locks, a collapsible steering column and bodyshell crumple zones. </p><p> <#> Safe for the environment too. <#> A three-way catalytic with multi-point fuel injection, standard on all models sees to that. </p><p> <#> At Proton we like to believe we 've thought of everything. <#> Even as far as how we can protect your investment after it has left our showrooms, because that can make a big difference to the lasting quality and value of the marque. </p></I><I><W2B-033$E><h> <#> He <it> likes </it> it </h><p> <bold> <#> YOU 'VE seen the annual Ulster motor show, now see the one that runs all year round - that 's the message from Peter Gordon of Charles Hurst Group. </p><p> <#> New cars at Hurst 's include the Renault Megane - read the great review here from Stephen Sutcliffe of Autocar magazine - the Nissan Almera and the Citroen Saxo. </p><p> <#> Not to mention the rover 200 series, which according to Hurst 's Gavin Martin is the most successful Rover ever. </p><p> <#> And the Almera isn't far behind - according to Richard Sholdis of Hurst's Nassa division, it's fitting nicely into the gap left by its predecessor, the Sunny. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The Sunny represented over 40 per cent of our sales every year, and it won't be long before the Almera reaches the same level," </quote> he said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Everything about it is state of the art, and there 's a superb mix of options available from the Equation at <*> pound sign </*> 12,600 SLX. </p><p> <#> "In the middle of the range, for example, you can either choose between the SI with sports seats and CD player for the younger driver, or the GX with standard seats and radio cassette." </quote> </p><p> <#> YOU'RE going to like the Renault Megane. <#> As a car to drive and own, not as a concept to grasp and croon about. </p><p> <#> The Megane, pronounced Meg-aaan, is unarguably the best car in its class alongside the Peugeot 306. </p><p> <#> The five-door hatchback, which will account for 70-80 per <}> <-> cant </-> <+> cent </+> </}> of sales before the other mainstream models appear, is a masterpiece of packaging. </p><p> <#> At the very least the Megane competes head on with the best in class in these areas; the old 19 categorically did not. </p><p> <#> And from a pure design andergonomic angle, I'd say it sets new standards inside with a brilliant basic driving position, excellent seats, handsome instruments, fresh and exciting shapes around most of the console, and deeply considered ergonomics. </p><p> <#> It 's the sort of interior you climb into and find the controls naturally, immediately, without searching for them. </p><p> <#> It 's as least as user friendly as a Fiat Coupe and only a little way short of the Calibra, still the most practical Coupe there is. </p><p> <#> If Renault UK 's estimates that the hatch will cost little more than its 19 equivalent and that the coupe 'will be very competitive' become reality, we could be looking at a new champ. </p></I><I><W2B-033$F><h> <#> Rover is top dog </h><p> <#> GAVIN Martin, the sales manager of Charles Hurst 's Rover division, has no doubt about where the new Rover 200 series stands - at the top. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It 's the most successful Rover launched yet," </quote> he said in the firm 's Boucher Road showroom in Belfast yesterday. </p><p> <#> "We 're selling more than we can get hold of, and we 're finding that it 's attracting not only loyal Rover fans, but drivers who had always bought Toyota and Vauxhall before. </p><p> <#> "I 'd say sales of the 200 represent half of all our rover sales at the moment." </quote> </p><p> <#> Prices for the series range from <*> pound sign </*> 10,600 for the 214i three-door to <*> pound sign </*> 14,500 for the top of the range 216Sli, with two diesels on offer. </p><p> <#> And in March or early April Hursts will have their hands on the 200 series sports version, the VVC. <#> Rover 's keeping this one carefully under wraps, with no price or performance figures yet available. </p><p> <#> The Rover 400 series four-door saloon, meanwhile, has also been selling very well since its launch last year. </p><p> <#> The 400 and 200 marked the completion of a range of cars which play a key role in strengthening Rover 's presence in the medium sector of the market. </p><p> <#> The five-door version of the new Rover 400 has already been recognised for bringing outstanding levels of driving environment, ride comfort, handling and prestige into the medium sector. </p><p> <#> However, it is the new saloon that represents the 400 Series in its definitive form. <#> Sales are predicted to split 50:50 between the two body styles. </p><p> <#> The four-door configuration allows the most complete execution of the elegant 400 design. <#> A rounded and distinctive style at the rear establishes an even more powerful road presence than the five-door and reflects the strengths of Rover 's traditional styling heritage. <#> The large boot, opening down to bumper level, provides easy access and an impressive storage space of 17 cubic feet. </p><p> <#> The new rover 400 Series saloon is available in 1.6 and 2.0 litre petrol and 2.0 litre diesel forms with prices ranging from <*> pound sign </*> 13,695 for the 416i to <*> pound sign </*> 17.195 for the fully specified, high performance 420SDi. </p></I>
