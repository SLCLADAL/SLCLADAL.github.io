<ICE-IRE:S2A-012 Boxing matches><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-012$A> <#> There 's a comeback from Barrett <#> Barrett loops back with a good <,> left hand to the chin <,,> <#> Well this is a remarkable contest <#> Just as you think one fella 's getting on top the other comes back <#> In the opening round I thought for a while that Walsh was going to win inside the distance but he 's after running into a couple of hard ones here from Barrett <,> <#> And Barrett the sort of fella that just won't give up <#> He took Walsh 's best punches in the opening round <#> And here he is still with fight <#> Referee calling for quiet in the corner <,> <#> Barrett <,> putting all his hopes in landing that big left hand <#> He seems to get an awful lot of power into a looping left hand <#> He can punch with either of course <,> but the left hand and there he runs into trouble <#> He 's caught <#> Caught by Billy Walsh <#> But he 'll still come forward <,> <#> Well you don't often see such action in <,> this the second round <#> What a contest <,> <#> Neither 's going to give any quarter in this bout <,> <#> And indeed Cork <,> doing very well <,> in these senior championships <#> Four boxers in the finals <#> One of them must lose here <,> <#> And there 's that big <,> left hand again <#> That dangerous left hand of Barrett 's comes out of the blue but he 's not able to set his man up to catch him for a second time <,> <#> Tries once more <,> <#> They 're hacking away for all they 're worth <#> Flings in through the canvas <#> He looks weary <#> He looks tired <#> Walsh <&> bell rings </&> <#> And there 's the bell for the end of the round <#> And a tired Billy Walsh back to the corner <,,> <#> And what a sensational bout of punishment this one <#> There 's that left hand and the right one and once again that left hand <#> He gets a lot into that left hand Sean Barrett <,> <#> Well it 's quite a punch-up this one <,,> <&> chanting and coach 's advice </&> <#> Well there 's three minutes left <,> and if it 's anything like the last two minutes there 's going to be plenty of action here <#> Will it go the full three minutes <#> Because there 's been an awful lot of hard punching all the way through here <#> Billy Walsh in red <,> in this all-Cork final <,> for the Irish title <#> This is <,> the light welterweight final <#> Walsh and Sean Barrett from Rylane in Cork <#> And how they 're going to separate them it 's difficult to know <#> Barrett was warned in the first round and that will <,> go against him quite severely on points <,> <#> But just <,> as you think one fellow is getting on top the other comes back <#> For a while it looked as if Billy Walsh was going to win this inside the distance <#> But how Barrett did and I don't know but he came right back <,> and has scored with some good punches every so often particularly with that left hand <#> He 's a wild looking left hand but when it hones in <,> to his opponent 's chin <,> it can do an enormous amount of damage <,> <#> Inter-county minor footballer <,,> cross-country champion he 's a real all-rounder <,> this man in blue Sean Barrett <,> against Billy Walsh <,> one of the most popular boxers in the stadium <#> Well most only know him for the last year or so <,> but he certainly draws the crowds <#> Very popular <#> Hooks with the left hand <#> Wow who got the better of that <#> It 's difficult to know <,> because such <,> fine punches scored very freely <#> Big right hand <#> Walsh again thrashes the right hand <#> <.> Siks </.> uh sinks a couple into the body <#> But instead of cracking <,> Barrett comes back again with some of his own ammunition <#> Jabs the body and up to the head <,> <#> They 've almost punched themselves out <,> <#> Well they haven't let up for a second <,> all the way through this contest <#> And the crowds well they 've enjoyed every moment of it <#> And there 's that big right hand <,> <#> And Walsh beginning to get to him now in this last round <#> But never write this fellow Barrett off <#> And there once again he fires back <,,> <#> Well he seemed to use the elbow there on the <,> blind side of the referee <#> Referee <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <,> careful of the clash of heads <#> They hardly know what they 're doing at this stage <#> They 're out on their feet at the final bell <#> A big embrace the best of friends but what a punishing contest <,,> <&> cheers and applause </&> <#> Well you it don't see much better than that <#> Action all the way through <,> <#> Well there again <,> the big attack the big punchers <,> and at times difficult to know who gets the better of that exchange <&> cheers and applause </&> <,,> <#> Yes a great ovation for these two boxers<&> winners are announced </&></I><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-012$A> <#> And that 's Neil Sinclair coming out for the first round <#> Neil Sinclair in blue <#> Very promising young boxer <#> Only nineteen <#> His opponent <,> the more experienced Neil Gough <,> from Saint Paul 's in Waterford as you see there <#> Neil Gough is the reigning champion <#> Won this title <,> as welterweight last year when he beat Eddie Fisher in the final <#> Was quite a scalp to get <,> but Eddie Fisher was beaten this time by this youngster Neil Sinclair <#> Now Sinclair is a very promising young boxer from the Holy Family Club in Belfast <,> <#> Sinclair <,> won a bronze <,> in the World Junior Championships <,> a couple of years ago in Montreal <,> <#> Gough <,> more than likely need to call on all his experience here to handle this young fellow cos he 's a very smart boxer <,> tall punches well <,> looked very good beating Tommy Lawler <,> catching him as he came in <#> He 's going to try and draw <,> Neil Gough <#> Catch him as he comes in I should think but Gough is a wise boxer <#> Twenty-two <#> Been around a while <#> Reigning champion <#> He 's not going to give up his title easily <#> That 's Neil Gough in red <,> <#> Half way through the first round and still nothing to really separate them as yet <,> <#> Sinclair try and keep this at long range I should think <,> using the centre of the ring <,> jabbing away with a long left hand <#> He 's trying to draw his man out with that short right hand <#> Gough <,> again makes the mistake of coming in and running into that left hand flush on the face <#> Gough hasn't really worked out exactly what to do here to get past those punches <#> Yes so a little bit better this time <,> <#> Sinclair gets a lot of leverage into those punches <,> punches from way out <,> and when they land <,> they 're fairly explosive <,> <#> Gough again trying to find a range <#> Getting inside but he 's not able to <,> stay in there and punch away <,> <#> Sinclair now begin to step up the pace a little bit in this round <,> <#> Well there 's an awful lot <,> <&> bell rings </&> not an awful lot between them <#> But if he 's to hold on to his title well he 's got to really work out <,> a good approach <&> coaches talking </&> <#> Coming up to the second round in this contest here <#> Here 's the challenger for it Neil Sinclair <#> A very promising young boxer <,> who has won a bronze medal <,> in the World Juniors <#> And there 's the champion <,> Neil Gough <#> Neil Gough from Waterford <,> from Saint Paul 's club in Waterford <#> So it 's Waterford Belfast here <#> Neil Sinclair <,> from Glengormley <,> and a member of the Holy Family Boxing Club in Belfast <,> and the opening round fairly tame <#> Sinclair has been more or less dictating the style of contest here <#> Uses the ring quite well <#> Gough <,> hasn't been able to upset <,> his cool style of boxing <#> Gough the champion <,> and the more experienced of the two <#> Well Sinclair has a lot of experience himself <,> although he 's only nineteen <#> He boxed in underage <,> international boxing <,> quite a number of occasions <,> including that bronze medal he won in Montreal <,> a couple of years ago <#> That was for the World Juniors <,> <#> Gough himself has been <,> through the underage <,> the Intermediate Champion All-Ireland Champion in Youth <,> boxing a few times <,> and of course Irish Senior Boxing <#> He was voted uhm <,> Champion of the Year <,> two years ago and he won an Irish title in the same year <,> <#> Now Gough <,> is finding it difficult to take control of this contest <#> He 's got to really <,> put on his thinking cap <,> do something get in close to this fella <#> That 's more like it <#> He gets in with a short punch <#> Sinclair <,> has been setting a nice cool pace here <,> and staying out of trouble <#> And this is where Gough has got to score <#> He 's got to score when he 's in close like that <,> and keep up pressure <#> When he gets a move like that he 's got to keep moving forward <#> Stay in close <#> At long range <,> Sinclair <,> looks the more comfortable <,> but he 's got to score the points too <#> And there 's a scoring one <,> <#> He wants to wipe his face there <#> There 's some blood about his nose or there 's <,> yes it 's nothing serious <#> Referee takes a closer look and off we go <,> <#> That 's a good solid left hand in the face flush in the face <#> That was a good solid one there from <,> Sinclair <,> <#> And this one fellow Sinclair is showing his boxing skills and showing them well in the second round <&> bell rings </&> <,> <#> The end of that second round and I think he should be comparatively happy <#> Needs to step up the pace a little bit more with one round to go <,,> <&> coach talks </&> <#> And there we see the kind of <,> thing that 's scoring the points for this fellow <#> His left hand is the best punch he 's got Neil Sinclair <#> And he 's scoring well with the left hand <#> Scoring the points against the champion <,> <#> All the time pressure from <,> Neil Gough coming forward and again he runs right on to a left <#> But it 's his only way to hold on to his title is to get close <,> <#> Well there 's a lot of work to do here <#> The champion Neil Gough <#> Third and final round <,> <#> And Neil Gough <,> last year 's champion up against one of the most promising amateurs in Ireland right now <#> And Neil Sinclair <,> from Belfast <,> boxing coolly <,> calmly <,> never flustered <#> And Gough has been finding it difficult to get beyond <,> the long reach of Sinclair <#> And in this last round <,> he still has the chance of holding onto his title <#> There can't be too much <,> between them <#> And there 's a good looping left and right hand there from Gough <#> Gough scores well <,> early on on this last round <#> Gough is a great one for winning the last round for coming from behind <#> He 's done it before <,> on many an occasion <#> And he 's not going to give up easily <,> <#> And this 's been quite a good interesting contest all the way through <#> And a cracking right hand from Sinclair <,> <#> Yes we 're seeing some good boxing in this bout <#> These are two good boxers <#> Well there 's no doubt about it we 'll have a good international representative at welterweight <#> Well as either of these fellas 'd hold their own with anyone <#> And this <,> is it going to be the youngster taking over the title <#> Neil Sinclair <,> scoring freely with a couple of good punches there <,,> <#> Yes <,> that could upset his bleeding <#> It doesn't seem to be worrying him too much <#> Indicates he 's alright <#> And in this final round <,> took a while to warm up but when it did <,> this has developed into quite an interesting and quite a good entertaining contest <#> And good boxing <#> Each try to outwit the other <#> Gough at times <,> a little frustrated that he can't get beyond this youngster 's long punches <#> Oh and a cracking right hand from Gough <#> That was one of his best punches <#> A really good right hand <#> And quick to retaliate was Neil Sinclair <#> That was a lovely move <,> from Neil Gough <#> Now can he do that again <#> That 's what he 's been trying to do but he 's <,> got to do it more often <#> Try to get slightly off this time <#> And Gough staying the pace staying the pace very well <#> <&> bell rings </&> <,> And the bell for the end <#> Looks as if he 's a little disappointed it didn't go on for another half minute or so because he 'd been beginning to put his punches together very well</I>
