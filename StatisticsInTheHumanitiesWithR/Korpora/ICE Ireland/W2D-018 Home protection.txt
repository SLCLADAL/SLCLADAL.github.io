<W2D-018 Home protection><I><W2D-018$A><h> <bold> <#> Introduction </bold> </h><p> <#> This booklet is intended to provide you with some basic information on HOME PROTECTION. <#> We know that your home is very special to you, as the place where you feel safest and most relaxed. <#> It also contains some very valuable property, if not in a commercial sense, then certainly in terms of its sentimental worth. <#> There is no insurance policy which could compensate you adequately for the loss and upset which can result from a burglary. <#> That 's why you should minimise the risk of having your home broken into, and the contents stolen. </p><p> <#> There are some very simple steps you can take, which will help improve the physical security of your home, and allay some of your fears. <#> Many of these will cost you nothing more than a few moments of your time. <#> Other measures may be more expensive, and may range in price from several pounds to several hundred pounds - but we 'll have a look at some of these later on. <#> It 's best to begin with the most obvious and easiest steps. </p><p> <#> As a starting point for considering the safety of <}> <-> you </-> <+> your </+> </}> home, let 's look at it from the burglar 's point of view. <#> What type of signs would help him target your home? </p><h> <bold> <#> Signs of vacancy </bold> </h><p> <#> Burglars tend to be skilled in recognizing signs which indicate that a particular house is vacant. <#> This means that it is unlikely that they will be disturbed on entry and helps to explain why 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of burglaries take place in unoccupied homes. </p><p> <#> The following are some of the things a burglar looks for: <#> A build-up of milk on the door-step <#> A build-up of papers and advertisements in the letter box<#> A build-up of letters in the hall visible from outside <#> Blinds pulled down, or curtains across during the day <#> No lights on at night, or just 'dead' lights like in the porch, or the hall <#> Lights on during the day <#> Front gates closed and no car in the drive way <#> Notes left for delivery men or callers <#> Uncut lawn and untidy garden </p><p> <#> Obviously any of these occurring by itself does not confirm that the premises are unoccupied. <#> But they are some of the criteria thieves use to target their victims. <#> There more signs there are, the more certain they can be that nobody is at home. </p><p> <#> These tell-tale signs can be easily avoided by a little personal care and attention. <#> If you live in a neighbourhood Watch Area, it is likely that you and your neighbour will already have developed a greater awareness of the need to take such precautions. <#> If you are not a member, why not make some enquiries about the advantages of this crime prevention programme. </p><p> <#> Modern technology can also be of assistance in quite inexpensive ways. <#> For example, you can purchase a time switch quite cheaply and use this to turn on and off lights automatically at the appropriate times. <#> It can also be used to control radios and televisions to simulate that someone is present in the house; but do make sure that you follow the manufacturer 's recommendations and don't compromise your fire safety. </p><p> <#> An outside light, especially at the rear of the building can also act as a deterrent - burglars certainly don't want to be seen. <#> This may go against your natural desire for privacy, which may also require fences and hedges. <#> Sometimes there can be a trade-off between privacy and security, with the 'happy medium' being a matter of personal choice. </p><h> <bold> <#> An open invitation </bold> </h><p> <#> After you have eliminated any clear indications of unoccupancy, the next step is to make sure that you do not invite the burglar in through carelessness. <#> Most burglars are opportunists and will select the easiest target that they can find. </p><p> <#> Don't offer him assistance by: <#> Leaving any window open. <#> Some people do this for ventilation forgetting that burglars will take advantage of the smallest opening. <#> Leaving external doors unlocked. <#> Leaving a key on a string, under a door-mat, or in some other 'good hiding place' outside. <#> Failing to secure side doors, allowing entry to the back of the premises which is more vulnerable to attack. <#> Failing to keep garages and sheds locked. <#> Not only do they contain valuable property, but also tools which may help the burglar to gain access to your home. </p><p> <#> Also make sure that ladders are not left in the open, or in insecure positions. <#> In most circumstances the thief will tend not to carry tools, or equipment with him for fear of detection. <#> Don't make his job any easier by providing them at the 'site'. </p><p> <#> Simply by taking these straight forward crime prevention measures brings you well on the road to achieving greater household security. <#> These measures alone will decrease the likelihood that you will be the burglar 's next victim. </p><h> <bold> <#> Keeping the intruder out </bold> </h><p> <#> There is still more that you can do to improve your security. <#> At this stage you have reached a point where any would be burglar can only gain entry by physically breaking into your home. <#> In many cases he can be deterred from doing this by the proper use of locks and bolts. </p><h> <bold> <#> WINDOWS </bold> </h><p> <#> Windows form a popular entry point for burglars, and it has been estimated that more than two thirds gain entry in this way. <#> The risk partly depends on two factors. <#> The first is how accessible the window is, and the second is how clearly visible the window is to your neighbours and passers-by. <#> Therefore, those windows at the rear and side of the building, which can be easily reached from the ground, or via pipes, or adjoining roofs are most vulnerable. </p><p> <#> Obviously windows which have not been left open must be broken, or prised to allow the burglar to put his hand through to release any catch or fitting. <#> If window locks are fitted, his task is so much more difficult. <#> This may force him to smash an area large enough to climb through. <#> Breaking glass may attract attention and few burglars will want to risk it. </p><p> <#> Furthermore, do remember not to leave the keys to the window locks where they can be seen, or are within easy reach. <#> The style of the window can also have a bearing on vulnerability. <#> For example, certain types of louvre windows are particularly risky wherein the glass panels can easily be removed. </p><p> <#> Various types of window locking devices are displayed below.. <#> You should choose a lock which is suitable to your window, whether it is a sash window, a french window, <}> <-> of </-> <+> or </+> </}> whether it is wooden or metal framed. </p><h> <bold> <#> DOORS </bold> </h><p> <#> Doors, particularly those at the side and rear of the dwelling are also likely entry points. <#> Consequently, they require special attention. <#> It is also important to consider any door which gives access to these sites, including garage doors. <#> Many of the better quality locks will give extra protection against attacks from <}> <-> jemmys' </-> <+> jemmies </+> </}> , crowbars, hand-drills and picks - some of the favourite tools of the burglar. <#> On the other hand, many outside doors are still being fitted with a type of lock which can be slipped open with a piece of plastic. </p><p> <#> Displayed....are two types of locks which are commonly found on external front doors. <#> A rim lock <}> <-> and </-> </}> is attached to the surface of the door. <#> A mortice lock which is superior. </p><p> <#> We recommend that as a minimum precaution all external doors are fitted with the five lever mortice lock. <#> In this case, the lock is actually recessed into the door itself, as can be seen from the drawing. <#> Door leaf should be at least 44mm in thickness to allow adequate strength after <}> <-> mortise </-> <+> mortice </+> </}> lock has been fitted. </p><p> <#> Mortice security bolts serve a similar purpose and can be used independently, or to augment existing security arrangements. <#> Hinge bolts also serve to boost door security and are especially useful on doors with exposed hinges, offering protection even should the hinges themselves be removed. </p><p> <#> The quality of the door and the materials used, will also <}> <-> effect </-> <+> affect </+> </}> its strength against attack. <#> If the design of the door is weak, then it will be difficult to compensate for this by using high security lock. <#> For example, hollow doors are not suitable for external fittings, and should be confined to internal use only. </p><p> <#> Besides the illustrations of some typical door locks, currently on the market, we have included door limiters. <#> These provide some security when you are at home by helping you to control access. <#> You should also consider fitting a door viewer. <#> This will enable you to identify the caller without having to open the door. </p><h> <bold> <#> FIREARMS <*> ampersand </*> AMMUNITION </bold> </h><p> <#> If you are the holder of licensed firearms, or ammunition, you should take special precautions to ensure their safety. <#> A steel gun locker is a worthwhile purchase which will afford a high level of security and give a life-time 's service. <#> If you don't have one of these then keep the firearm and ammunition separately, and remove the firing mechanism and magazine. <#> This will prevent the easy unlawful use of the weapon, not only by criminals but also by inquisitive children. </p><h> <bold> <#> OTHER PROPERTY </bold> </h><p> <#> Whatever the nature of your property, be sure that you have an adequate record of it and that, where possible, it is also marked with your own property number. </p><h> <bold> <#> RECORDING PROPERTY </bold> </h><p> <#> The benefits of marking property are that: <#> It greatly increases the likelihood of stolen property being returned to the owner. <#> As you probably already know, a great deal of property remains unclaimed in Garda possession as the owners cannot be identified. <#> It will make the property less attractive to the thief. <#> He will not be able to readily dispose of property that is marked and can be easily identified. <#> Generally, he will not want to steal goods that he cannot resell. </p><h> <bold> <#> Inside the house </bold> </h><p> <#> When you are away from home, we recommend that you normally should not lock weak internal doors. <#> They offer very little resistance and may result in unnecessary damage. <#> If the intruder has gained access it is unlikely that these will prove realistic deterrents. <#> For similar reasons it is also felt that cupboards and bureaus should not be locked. <#> Moreover, in no circumstances should these ever be considered as providing sufficient protection for your valuables. </p><h> <bold> <#> CASH </bold> </h><p> <#> In the first instance, you should limit the amount of cash left in the home. <#> Don't leave money in dishes or jars in anticipation of paying some bill. </p><h> <bold> <#> JEWELLERY </bold> </h><p> <#> All jewellery should be locked out of sight when you are not at home - either in a small floor safe or some similar protective casing. <#> You could just as easily protect it by leaving it with a relative or friend, particularly if you intend to be away for some time. <#> Some banks also offer this holding facility. </p><h> <bold> <#> BICYCLES </bold> </h><p> <#> Bicycles are very valuable items of property <}> <-> some times </-> <+> sometimes </+> </}> carelessly left around the house. <#> Once off the street there is a tendency to forget the danger from thieves. <#> However, many bicycles are stolen from backyards and side passages. <#> Always have your bicycle locked when not in use. </p><h> <bold> <#> PROPERTY MARKING NUMBER </bold> </h><p> <#> A property marking number is simply a specific number used to identify your property. <#> We recommend that you use your date of birth as initials, for example: </p><p> <#> If your name is John A. Dunne, born on the 13/11/43, then your property number would be 131143 JAD. <#> You put this number on all appropriate items of your property, using one of the methods outlined below. <#> You then fill out a card with this information, and return it to your local Garda Station.</p><p> <#> The items which should be marked are those most likely to be stolen, especially portable electrical and mechanical goods. <#> In the event of property being stolen and later recovered, the Gardai will have no trouble in matching the property with its rightful owners. </p><h> <bold> <#> PROPERTY MARKING </bold> </h><p> <#> You can mark your property with any of the following. <#> 1. An ultra-violet pen <#> 2. An electric engraver <#> 3. An indelible marker <#> 4. An etching tool <#> 5. A series of metal punches, the precise method will depend on the nature of the property that you are marking; on whether or not it is glass, metal, wood, fabric etc. <#> There are some items of property which you will not want to mark because of their individual character or value, e.g. crystal, items of jewellery or antiques. <#> Those items should be photographed. </p><p> <#> If you wish to know more about the property marking scheme, contact your local Garda Station. </p><h> <bold> <#> Conclusion </bold> </h><p> <#> This booklet has been confined to suggesting basic ways and means of increasing your home protection. <#> That 's why it has not dealt with alarms, safes, security fencing, etc. <#> We do not want you to feel that you have to convert your home into a fortress, as a little thoughtfulness can prevent many burglaries from occurring. <#> However, should you feel that you may require these types of systems to meet your personal needs and circumstances, always make sure that they comply with accepted standards as in the case of the current Irish Standards for burglar alarms I.S.199. <#> Additional professional advice can be obtained freely from the Crime Prevention Officer. </p><p> <#> You now know that crime prevention does not need to be expensive or technical. <#> Common sense and a few pounds will put you on the road to greater security - start with the doors, and then move on to the windows until you have a security system in which you can trust. <#> The Gardai are always prepared to assist you in this development. <#> Call your local station should you have any questions related to this subject. </p></I>
