</[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> I know well <{> <[> you would </[> but at the end of the day I mean<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Saying no </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> There 's eight people

</{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> There 's no way<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> and I love cooking and I would <.> st </.> you know

and all round for dinner <{3> <[3> <unclear> 2 syllables </[3> <#> That 's just madness <,> <#> <{4> <[4> You </[4> couldn't do that<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> As long they all fitted around your table then it 's fine<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> No the most well I suppose you could probably get eight round my table if you borrowed another two and put the <.> m </.> middle bit in<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Yeah <#> <{> <[> Yes I wouldn't have </[> that but <#> That 's just like<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[> But you wouldn't be able </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> You wouldn't be able to move in the kitchen <{> <[> <#> Do </[> you know what I mean<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> I 'm just trying to think where I 'm going to get two more chairs from<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> You can take two <{> <[> from my </[> house<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Got some </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Have you any foldaway chairs or<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> No they 're just the

if they 've any <,> <{2> <[2> I can borrow </[2> a couple of <,> chairs or<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> Are you sure </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> Aye spare ones </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Is that the two guys that were at the <{> <[> party </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah <#> But then just as I was leaving uh there was a wee email sign and I clicked on it and it was Angie again going <,> oh can you can you make it at ten o'clock because <,> you know I A/ine doesn't finish work til nine <{> <[> and then I 've to go </[> <,> uh he 's to go and pick her up and bring her back so that 'll be ten <,> kind of thing <#> And I was like well that 's a bit late for and it kind of solved my problem of <,> of having too many people <&> laughter </&> anyway<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[> Och well then </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> It did actually didn't it<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> But <,> I mean if it 's going to be late for everybody<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Are you <{> <[> sure now </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Just Linda and </[> </{> Aidan when they get home from work they want they practically eat immediately <#> So if they 're going to <{1> <[1> be hanging </[1> around <{2> <[2> til </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> Oh right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> Oh </[2> </{2> that 'll not be fair on them<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> But you know what <#> They could have <,> we could all have our starters you know <,> in two different sittings or <.> what </.> you know <{> <[> and that </[> would <,> cut out hassle and all as well like<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Yeah yeah true<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> And that would sort of keep them going until <{> <[> the main course </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Yeah well that would be fair yeah <,> <#> <{1> <[1> Cos I mean you wouldn't </[1> want them two sitting starving <#> That wouldn't be fair on <{2> <[2> him </[2> especially after Linda <{3> <[3> made the dessert and everything </[3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> I 'm going to do </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> No </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> But they 're quite </[3> </{3> <,> they 're happy to do that at the moment like <{1> <[1> anyway </[1> because uhm <,> I told Linda on Monday that I was thinking of moving out <#> And <{2> <[2> she 's </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> Oh </[2> </{2> how did she take that<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> She was fine about it you know <#> She was just going but why <.> wh </.> you know and she 's like trying to <.> re </.> you know she was very reasonable and all like <,> she 's just you know going well obviously I don't want you to move out like <#> You know <{1> <[1> we 're </[1> best friends and you know <,> I hate to think it was <,> Aidan <,> being there <{2> <[2> or </[2> you know <#> And I was going well obviously Linda it 's changed the whole make-up of the house <#> <{3> <[3> It used to be all girls </[3> <#> He 's there all the time<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[3> Yeah I suppose he 's there a lot now is he </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Is he<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Yeah <#> You don't even get speaking to Linda<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Oh without Aidan <{> <[> being around </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> No no </[> </{> <#> So<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Mm <#> I know Doris got pissed off with Tommy being in the house<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Yeah <#> Och it just happens <#> <{1> <[1> It 's not </[1> <,> that you don't like them <{2> <[2> or anything you know </[2> but it just happens<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> It does <#> I mean </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> I know <#> I know </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> And uh but even with Doris ' situation I mean like she owned the house <#> Do you know what I mean <#> And she sort of felt like he was <,> <{1> <[1> intruding </[1> almost cos Tommy would 've come round whenever I wasn't there <,> or I would 've been going to work and he would 've been still in bed and then going on later <#> <{2> <[2> I mean he never did anything wrong </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> Yeah that was the same with Murph </[2> </{2> you see <,,> <#> Cos Murph was there for fucking months on end as well <#> <{1> <[1> But </[1> uhm <,> he <,> like he never asked to stay and he never you know <,> I never asked him to either like <{2> <[2> you know </[2> <#> With Linda it was all official and above board but Murph was just like slinking <#> He was there all the time <#> He used the house more than us like <&> laughter </&> <#> He 's getting out of bed when I came home from work looking for his breakfast <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> No way <#> Jesus <#> No well at least if Tommy was staying there all day dinner would 've been ready like for everybody coming home <#> I mean he always did his own share and like cleaned <{1> <[1> and everything </[1> <#> But still <,> whenever <,> you 're sort of agreeing to <{2> <[2> move </[2> in with somebody you sort of just agree to move in with them <#> <{3> <[3> You expect </[3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> But I was just </[3> </{3> explaining it like you know look I just need a big change <#> I just want a lot of things in my life to change <{1> <[1> at the </[1> moment <#> And I want to be down near the city centre <,> where I can walk out my front door go visiting <,> <{2> <[2> you know </[2> not be paying a tenner return in a taxi <,> anywhere any night <#> You know cos as soon as you go up home <,> and you 're that far out you don't want to leave <#> <{3> <[3> Like you know </[3> that 's you you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[3> No I know </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Although in saying that I mean I only live like <,> down <{1> <[1> the road </[1> and I still don't go out anywhere <#> <{2> <[2> Well I </[2> have to say no <,> like if I 'm there on a Friday <.> e </.> or a Thursday evening I 'll go late night shopping just to even wander round <{3> <[3> the shops </[3> and see people <{4> <[4> <#> Do </[4> you know what I mean<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> I know </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> I 'd <,> never think of doing that like you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> But it I mean <,> I don't get out because it 's safe as well <#> <{1> <[1> Do you know what I mean </[1> <#> Hamill Street 's quite dark <{2> <[2> cos </[2> you don't really go out after nine o'clock <#> I wouldn't go out after nine o'clock on my own <,> <#> And I wouldn't <{3> <[3> dream of walking about </[3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah <,> yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> You got a taxi up here </[3> </{3> tonight did you<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Mm hm <,,> <#> In the lighter evening I can't wait til the lighter evenings to come in <#> You know would you believe<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> I know you 're<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Look uh it 's light it 's light <#> It 's I don't care <&> laughter </&> <#> Uhm <,> you see in the lighter evenings I mean it 'll be great cos I will be able to walk about and stuff <,> if it 's <#> I think it 's possibly because I don't really know the area very well either<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> You know if I knew it was safe <,> I know the people that lived there before me said it was safe<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> But still<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> But they were trying to sell their house <{> <[> you know </[> <#> But I think it is <#> Well it is that walkway across that 's that part is not safe<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[> Exactly </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Aye College Street North the <{> <[> big street </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{> <,> yes <#> <{1> <[1> Cos that 's </[1> where the the tech was and all <#> And I remember like the <,> uh I went there for <,> for that mechanics course like and uh <{2> <[2> it was </[2> you know everybody was always saying like you know it 's a really dodgy area and <,> especially when we went round to the wee uh garage <.> ya </.> yard bit and all <#> Uh you know <{3> <[3> they were </[3> going don't like you know <{4> <[4> don't hang around </[4> <#> Yeah wait <#> Don't come down early <#> Like wait til it 's open <{5> <[5> actually open like </[5><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> I know </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> Oh yes </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[4> Don't go round there on your own </[4> </{4><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[5> Yeah </[5> </{5> <,> well it 's that 's fair enough cos I mean <{1> <[1> there are </[1> so many wee alleys <#> Do you know what I <.> me </.> <#> There 's <.> lo </.> I mean like there 's <,> the one <,> before my street <,> you know the way there 's like a driveway into the <{2> <[2> mill </[2> <#> And then there 's the carpark that they could be hiding behind different things and then <{3> <[3> there 's </[3> Hamill Street alleyway as well <#> And plus the other thing is that <{4> <[4> uhm </[4><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[4> It 's </[4> </{4> like once it 's light you 'll be fine<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Yeah <#> Oh God aye <{1> <[1> you 'll be </[1> able to see everything <{2> <[2> <#> Uhm </[2> <,> I 'm not really looking forward to the homeless shelter being open now <#> I felt so <{3> <[3> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> It mightn't </[3> </{3> affect you too much like cos it is<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> It is I know it 's on <{> <[> the main road </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Quite a distance </[> </{> away from you but <,> that would be dodgy enough now<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Like it 's people I don't want people <,> this sounds awful but I don't want people like lying in my alley <#> Do you know what I mean <#> And <{1> <[1> going </[1> to my bin in the morning and <{2> <[2> there 's </[2> somebody lying beside <{3> <[3> it </[3> <#> That scares me a bit<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> But maybe we 're <,> sort of<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> But there is gates and I would assume <{> <[> that </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> Under </[> </{> <,> under-judging them or whatever the word is <#> <{1> <[1> Like cos </[1> you know <,> <{2> <[2> if their homeless </[2> shelter 's there why would they be lying in your alley like <&> laughter </&> <#> They 'd go home like<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[1> I know </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[2> But <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> I know <#> And I keep having these thoughts oh no I 'm going to come home <{> <[> from work </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> <[> No but </[> </{> obviously they 're all they they 're probably majority of them are drunks or <{> <[> whatever </[> so they would be hanging around like you know close to<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> I know<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> They 'll find somewhere to hang out which will be probably your walkway or something like that <,> you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> I hope not<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$A> <#> Well that 's where all the wee kids hang out and all<ICE-IRE:S1A-038$B> <#> Like wee kids tend to hang out at you know the very top of the street at <{1> <[1>
