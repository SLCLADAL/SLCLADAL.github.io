he could think that he 's dressed in green now<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> But he 's actually in <{> <[> black <,> to me he 's in black </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> <[> No <,> the only </[> </{> confusion you get is between red and green you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <{> <[> No but how can you know </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> <[> No no no no no no </[> </{> <#> That 's your conception of black<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Yeah okay<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> <{> <[> It might not be </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[> You see it might not be red to me </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Yeah <,> it 's uh what you what 's black <#> Black is only what you think this is <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> A very dark colour yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> No <,> but you 're <{1> <[1> no <,> it 's </[1> not only your idea <,> the mental <{2> <[2> picture it 's not <,> it 's not an actual definition </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[1> No but </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> <{2> Oh right <,> so then blind people can </[2> </{2> actually see colour<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> <{> <[> In a way <,> well <,> <.> th </.> they can have their own conceptions of colours </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[> No <,> well no no it 's just </[> </{> <#> Well take here like like this this this uhm <,> this beige wall you know <,> I know that 's the colour beige and every time I 'm referring to it it 's beige and to you it 's always beige as well<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Mmm<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> But to you that beige might look like this black <,> yeah <#> So you might not see that colour all over this room <,> whereas I 'd see this colour<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> And then I might see this colour as <,> as black<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Okay <{1> <[1> so it 's just a label </[1> you have on your <{2> <[2> perception of colour </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[1> So it 's <,> yes </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2> <#> And because everybody keeps calling everybody says you know since you were a child say well that 's silver<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> You always associate silver with that <,> but you may actually see that as red in your<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> Do you see what I mean<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Well it 's silver to me <,> okay <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> <#> Where did I come across that argument <#> It was<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> With me actually probably about a week ago<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Was it<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Yeah <#> No I 've come across it before too <,> uhm <#> <{1> <[1> Oh I remember </[1> <#> I 've seen it <#> Yeah I know it 's philosophy <#> Well maybe I uh actually uh I went to a few lectures on it <,> <{2> <[2> and he </[2> stood up the top pointing at blackboards and green boards actually yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[1> Philosophy </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> <[2> Did you </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Or blackboards or green boards or whatever<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> That 's like this this here could be a <,> a uh a box of tissues<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Mmm<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> But I always perceive it as a box of eggs <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$S> <#> It 's yellow in colour yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> No black<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Oh is it <#> Sorry yeah <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Oh <{> <[> that 's good </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> <[> Great </[> </{> laughs <,> mm<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Is this true<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> A little bit of it yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> That 's why I always think about you know people they don't they 've no dress sense <,> colours<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> Yeah because my mother has a friend and she 's uh she dyes her hair blonde <,> but the the roots are always black <#> It 's not Nellie <&> laughter </&> <#> But the roots are black down <{> <[> to there <#> And </[> she just doesn't see <,> she doesn't seem to see it herself and she 'd wear red and then she 'd wear kind of hairbands that would clash with her like piss-blonde hair <#> And oh<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[> It 's bottle blonde </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Oh can we use a word like that <#> Can we<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> <&> laughter </&> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Can we<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> That 's allowed<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> Ah<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> Beep <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> It 's a <,> <.> M </.> Mam always reckons that she 's colour blind cos we 'll say different shades of the same colour she always seems to wear together and everything <#> But you 'd be morto to go out with her like<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> Therefore she must perceive that two colours must be perceived as the same for her<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> <{> <[> Mmm </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> <[> Like </[> </{> <.> sh </.> she 's known around Boyle that ah <,> she 's uhm <,> known for her like disgusting colours <#> Like people like say oh look at her today <#> So she must have a <{> <[> very severe case of that </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[> Well she 's changed </[> </{> her colour to red hair today <,> blonde tomorrow<ICE-IRE:S1A-071$B> <#> And piss-blonde the next day by all accounts <{> <[> isn't it </[> <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$A> <#> <[> Well that 's what I call blonde </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-071$C> <#> <[> You you 've got worse still than you have already </[> </{> Jeez <unclear> 5 sylls
