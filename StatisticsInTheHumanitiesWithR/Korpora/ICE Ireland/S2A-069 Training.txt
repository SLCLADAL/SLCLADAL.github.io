<ICE-IRE:S2A-069 Training><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-069$A> <#> Uh thank-you Chairman <#> I 'd also like to uh sort of endorse what has been said in relation to uh how we spend <,> no not uh about the bananas <,> uh there might be a new uh definition for a banana republic Chairman but however <,> uh you know we have a sizeable budget here for education and training <#> I think if we were to to sit down and plan how we spend that budget carefully and properly we could get better results that we 're getting at the moment Chairman <#> And that must be our great challenge for the year ahead <#> But I do think it is a fundamental mistake that such a small proportion of the budget is spent directly in training people already in uh in jobs <,> that so little goes directly to industry and the services <#> I think it ought to be a key principle that what we have we hold and where where people are in jobs we should <.> alre </.> <,> we should at least try to consolidate and retain the number of people that we have in employment already <#> And to assist in doing that we should be directing more money towards training people who are <.> alr </.> <,> who already are in employment in according with the recommendations that were made by IBEC yesterday <,> in their report to the Minister yesterday <#> I would hope Minister that that report will not be ignored <,> and that some action will be taken on the recommendations of that report <,> and that they will be taken very very quickly <#> Uh uh I think it 's important that workers who began their working life uhm <,> perhaps a long time ago <,> uh <.> wi </.> uh will have to be assisted to keep pace with technology <#> Will have to have the kind of in-house in-service training that will enable them to have the to to to increase their level of skills and will give them the kind of versatility of skill and outlook <,> to enable them to take on new tasks within perhaps the same industry <#> And that can only be made to <.> ha </.> happen if there 's proper provision for in-house training within existing industry <#> And the amount of budget we are <.> alr </.> spending already on that is far too little and far too small <#> And I really am looking forward to a response from the Minister uh uh on that issue <#> Uh it was raised uh by IBEC yesterday I think in a very sensible fashion and I hope it will <,> as I said <,> I hope it will not be ignored because it is <#> Whilst we must always be seeking and striving to create new jobs <,> to try to lower the level of those who are unemployed <,> hand in hand with that we must put the same degree of energy and planning and investment into retaining <.> re </.> existing jobs <#> The second point I want to make is in relation to these uh new CEDP schemes <#> Uh I think whilst they have improved marginally from the old SES schemes <,> the improvement is very marginal indeed <#> And there 's enormous scope for further improvement <#> I think the training element is far far too small and the evaluation and the monitoring is something that hasn't been clearly uh worked out or if it has been worked out it hasn't been worked out in a way that 's convincing enough to to convince me that at the end of the day <.> thi </.> <.> thi </.> this huge investment of money is going to uh going to lead to uh a larger proportion <.> of </.> of of of the long-term unemployed getting jobs as result of these training schemes <#> I remain to be convinced of that Minister <#> I I I think they <.> w </.> they were rather rushed <#> I think the the the core idea was good but it hasn't been worked out at all in any detail <,> in any practical detail <#> And I think there 's scope for a great deal of work to be done there <#> Because if that isn't done a good deal of the work <.> s </.> <,> of the money spent will be money that will yield no great return at the end of the day in terms <.> o </.> of jobs gained <,> and new jobs gained and that sort of thing <#> And and I <.> aw </.> I want to make a point that I 've made on many occasions before <#> It 's in relation to women <,> women who have not been signing on <#> And they are excluded <#> They 're currently excluded from these new CEDP schemes <#> And <.> an </.> <.> an </.> in that respect they 're very severely penalised <#> And <.> iranic </.> ironically <,> what 's beginning to happen now is that a good deal of work <,> of the kind of caring work that was previously carried out by women on a voluntary basis <,> is now beginning to be undertaken by men under these schemes <#> And they 're being paid for it <#> So women are suffering twice over <#> Women are being displaced now from work that they did on a voluntary basis because of the operation of these schemes <#> <.> A </.> <.> an </.> I think that 's a a a severe setback and that is an unintended result <#> It is a matter of course for the Minister for Social Welfare and not a <.> manne </.> matter for any of the Ministers here present <#> But nonetheless I would take it <.> Min </.> uh Chairman that there must be co-ordination between the different Departments to make sure that at least we get a better result and a better return from the application of these schemes <#> But that 's one of the areas that I would like the Minister to you know to take a lead in getting a solution for <#> Because if women who haven't been signing on <,> if they were made eligible for these schemes it would make a great difference to women themselves <,> to their their outlook on life <,> to their self-esteem and it would make a great difference to the family budgets that are enormously small in the areas particularly where there are large numbers of children in families <#> It <.> wou </.> really would make a difference at that level as well as at the level of creating employment <#> But uh overall I think we 're we 're going into this whole thing in a very <,> we 're stumbling into this kind of thing without any proper plan <#> Nor will there be a proper plan I think until we come up with uh uh the White Paper <.> o </.> on manpower <.> an </.> and training that Richard Bruton <,> Deputy Bruton here beside me is constantly calling for <#> I think only when that is done and only when we sit down and push our thoughts in in a in in a coherent frame can we then proceed along the lines that will yield the kind of returns that we 're entitled to expect from what is really a very big investment in education and training and hasn't been yielding the kind of result that it ought to uh in in in <,> in the recent past or the not so recent past <#> Thank-you Chairman<ICE-IRE:S2A-069$B> <#> Thank-you Deputy <#> The next speaker is Deputy Sean Power and then Deputy Ray Burke<ICE-IRE:S2A-069$C> <#> Just to ask the Minister one question <,> in relation to the training <#> Uh we have in place for a long number of years now the Army Apprentice Training School and I think <,> there 's no doubting the end product that we <.> produ </.> we have there each each year and that have won uh many international awards uh <.> ea </.> each year <#> So I think uh they have <,> we have great expertise available to us in the Department of Defence and I think it 's not being utilised properly <#> I think it would present uh it presents uh tremendous opportunity uh and I think that we should <,> if we used the expertise there uh that 's available in in in training of the young people <,> I think there 's tremendous scope there and it 's uh it 's unfortunate I think that we 're not using it to the its its its full potential <#> And I I just ask the Minister if she would give some consideration uh to greater liaison if you like between her Department and the Department of of Defence <#> I think it 's a tremendous opportunity and one that we shouldn't miss<ICE-IRE:S2A-069$B> <#> The next speaker is Deputy Ray Burke<ICE-IRE:S2A-069$D> <#> Thank-you very much Chairman <#> Uhm <,> we don't have the deputy from West Cork available to us today unfortunately <&> discussion omitted from transcription </&> <#> In relation to this particular issue uhm Chairman <,> probably in the public administration area <,> the <,> my dealings with the public <,> I I find the greatest level of cynicism in relation to this whole area of Fa/s and training and public funds and EC funds that are pumped into the area under the global heading of training <#> The questions are asked <,> what is achieved <#> Are we training for people <,> half training them without proper certification for jobs that aren't there at the end of the day <#> Is it money that 's merely put in to keep people uh off the unemployment register <#> Is it there for uh just these grandiose bodies that have <.> apper </.> appeared out of <,> over the last number of years <#> I see for example under the <,> the various subheads that the European Social Fund pumps in eighty-seven point eight nine seven million pounds in the nineteen ninety-four estimate into this whole area of training <#> We see IBEC talking about training for people in jobs <#> I accept that <#> Why should the taxpayer though have to pay for this training for people in jobs <#> Surely the greatest thing that we should have to do <,> that we have as a a society is to get down our tax rates <,> to really encourage incentive and to encourage uhm uh uh job creation in this country <#> And that <,> uhm <.> c </.> job creation will be <,> we will create jobs <,> quicker with low tax rates rather than with subsidies and with uhm training grants et-cetera <#> But we 're pushing in uhm huge money into uhm existing training <#> We also have social welfare <#> And there is a major linkage between social welfare and Fa/s <#> Because in the minds of those that <,> who through no fault of their own find themselves unemployed <,> there is this situation of do we stay on social welfare <#> Do we move on to an SES scheme <#> What benefits are we going to lose if we move from one to the other <#> Unfortunately I have to say that having looked at it over a number of years that as it 's presently structured <,> there is no real direction <#> There is a a shotgun approach taken to it with scattered <.> sh </.> shells all over the area <#> Pellets flying everywhere <#> Rather than what should be taken as a rifle to tackle each individual problem <#> It is a <,> to me at this stage <,> a waste of our taxpayers ' money and a waste of the EC money which could be better directed in other <.> dir </.> <,> in other areas <#> That is not to say that there is much good work being done and there is a lot of good work being done <#> But I 'm afraid that on balance that the uhm real benefits that should be available are not available <#> I have a feeling that a lot of this money is really to a terrible extent a sort of a hush money to keep people relatively quiet while they 're on <.> p </.> uhm part-time schemes uhm rather than creating long-term gainful meaningful employment <#> It is with regret that I say it but that is the purpose of these committees <,> that we have the benefit to discuss it <#> I put it out as is uh as a view to the Minister and I would be keen to hear the Minister 's uhm considered response to what is a general type of uh accusation</I>
