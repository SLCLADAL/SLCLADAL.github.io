<W2B-021 Zoo - Environment><I><W2B-021$A><h> <#> Who 's New </h><h> <#> by Mark Challis, Assistant Zoo Manager </h><p> <#> One ring-tailed lemur and two black and white ruffed lemurs have been born, both rare species from Madagascar. <#> The ruffed lemurs caused much confusion as we were unsure which of the three females was the mother, as all three were presumed to be pregnant, and all three appeared to be caring for the infants! <#> After some careful observation (and a little guesswork) it would appear that 'Mandy' is the proud mum. </p><p> <#> Also among the primates, there has been a birth in the Colombian spider monkey group (the second this year), one Goeldi 's monkey and two golden-headed lion tamarins. <#> All these species are endangered in the wild, particularly the golden-headed, whose wild population is in the low hundreds. <#> We are currently the only zoo in the UK breeding this handsome and critically endangered species. </p><p> <#> The breeding female Weddell 's tamarin gave birth to twins, which will grow up in their large family group, in our off-show breeding accommodation, the group being part of an ongoing behavioural research project at the zoo. </p><p> <#> Two mara have also been born, as have a litter of meerkats, though it will be some time before they are old enough to leave their underground den and be seen out in the enclosure. </p><p> <#> Among the hoofstock, one blackbuck and one red lechwe have been born, as has an attractive zebra, born to the mare 'Amo', which is now out in the large paddock shared with the giraffe and the ostrich. </p><p> <#> The birds have similarly benefited from the onset of summer, and we have already had successful hatchings from bare-eyed cockatoos and red-crested pochard, while a number of other species have recently laid eggs. </p><p> <#> The rare domestic breed we keep have also been productive, with the births of two Dexter cattle, five Ronaldsay sheep, fourteen Tamworth pigs, nine Berkshire pigs and eight hybrid pigs, the result of a meeting between a Tamworth boar and a Berkshire sow. </p><p> <#> There have been a number of exciting new arrivals including ten species of waterfowl that are now on the lake, and several new species of birds for the new Bird Park, including satyr and Tamminck 's tragopans, Palawan peacock pheasants, pink pigeons and Bali mynahs. <#> Parrots have also been moved into the new aviaries and Asian short-clawed otters have arrived for the new exhibit opposite the sea lions. </p><p> <#> A trio of fat-tailed dwarf lemurs arrived on breeding loan from Bristol Zoo. <#> Infrequently kept in European collections they are rather shy though very attractive, should you see them in their enclosure in the Nocturnal House. </p><p> <#> Perhaps most exciting of all, the old Hyena Enclosure now has four African wild dogs in residence. <#> Severely threatened in the wild, extinction for this species has been forecast, within the next 20 years. <#> Now part of a European Breeding Programme (EEP), the African wild dog has proved a difficult animal to maintain longterm in captivity. <#> Our four brothers on loan from Amsterdam Zoo, will shortly be joined by a single female from another European Zoo. </p></I><I><W2B-021$A><h> <#> BIRTH OF BABY GORILLA </h><p> <#> Belfast Zoo proudly announces the birth of Djamba, a male gorilla, born to Delilah aged 32. </p><p> <#> This is only the second successful gorilla birth in Ireland, and the first to be reared by its mother. <#> The previous gorilla, born at Dublin Zoo, was hand-reared. </p><p> <#> Allowing a baby gorilla to be mother-reared carries potential risks because the reaction of the other gorillas in the social group can be unpredictable, as can be the ability of the mother to cope with her offspring. </p><p> <#> Delilah was brought to Belfast Zoo from across the water when her mate died, having already successfully reared seven offspring. <#> Although relatively ancient at 32, the move has provided her with a new mate and also gives the other young Belfast gorilla females an opportunity to observe the rearing process, thereby strengthening their own chances of breeding successfully. </p></I><I><W2B-021$A><h> <#> BELFAST ZOO CHIMPS DEVELOP NEW TECHNIQUE IN TERMITE FISHING </h><p> <#> One of the finishing touches to <}> <-> Belfasts </-> <+> Belfast </+> </}> Zoo 's million pound award-winning Primate Enclosure built in 1991 to house some of its star attractions, a colony of chimps and a family of gorillas, was an artificially created termite mound. </p><p> <#> Situated in the Chimpanzee House, the termite mound is designed to provide intellectual stimulation for the chimps and is similar to those found in the wild, with one exception; as termites are fairly difficult to come by, the zoo has substituted different types of jam. <#> The idea is that the chimps dip sticks into the holds in the mound to reach the jam at the other end. </p><p> <#> Recently, however, primate keeper, Alyn Cairns has noticed that the clever chimps have devised a more effective method of jam fishing. <#> They have discovered that chewing on the ends of the sticks to make them more brush-like and absorbent means that they can scoop up more jam! </p></I><I><W2B-021$B><h> <#> Seeing Sense by Kathleen Mannis Zoo Education Officer </h><p> <#> Sight is the sense which we use most of all and our eyes are very highly developed with only birds able to see better than we do. <#> For many animals sight is not important and they therefore have only very simple eyes which can detect light/darkness and movement. </p><p> <#> To form a clear image a lens is needed to focus. <#> Most vertebrates (animals with a backbone) have this type of eye. <#> Birds have the best sight of all, birds of prey having remarkable vision. </p><p> <#> Not every animal can see in colour as we do. <#> Dogs cannot distinguish red from green and most nocturnal animals have very poor colour vision. <#> Once again birds are the best and can see many more hues than we can. <#> Some animals can see wave-lengths that are invisible to us. <#> Piranha fish and goldfish can see infra-red used in remote control beams, while most insects can see ultra-violet. </p></I><I><W2B-021$C><h> <#> "The Environment - A Sustainable Future" <#> Billy McAlister, architect, town planner and environmental assessor </h><p> <bold> <#> Ulster Tatler has for some time been aware that environmental issues are playing an ever-increasing part in our lifestyle. <#> We have asked Billy McAlister, Architect, Town Planner and Environmental <}> <-> Asessor </-> <+> Assessor </+> </}> to edit a series to ensure that Ulster Tatler makes a necessary contribution to the environment initiative. </p><p> <#> Everyone 's talking about it, most people know something about it and a few people are very concerned about it - THE ENVIRONMENT. </bold> </p><p> <#> WHY, all of a sudden, are we being subjected to a massive media promotion of matters relating to our past, present and future living standards, highlighted by disasters causing irreparable damage to our world resources? <#> Every day there is some reference to degradation and destruction at global, national and local levels. <#> Have values changed and living habits altered to an extent out of all proportion with patterns of earlier long established standards? <#> The answer is that the situation has been slowly creeping up on us and at an increasing rate over the past 50 years. </p><p> <#> A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT boils down to maintaining a balance between the use of the world 's resources and the number of human beings using them. <#> Tribes, in earlier times, and in some parts of the developing world today, maintained this balance by controlling their population directly related to the availability of resources, such as food, and, materials for clothing, shelter, and weapons. <#> If the balance was or is not maintained the small community either had to split and move away, or as has happened, in many cases disappeared. <#> The situation can also be applied to a certain degree affecting much larger communities and even nations and dynasties looking back through history. <#> Maintaining a state of balance is best likened to a see-saw on which two equal sized children can maintain a simple equilibrium. <#> Once, however, one child, through over-eating, weighs heavier than the other, the resultant state of imbalance creates difficulties for each of them. </p><p> <#> ACCENTUATING the difficulties in maintaining this status quo is another aspect, that of CHANGE, an inevitable dimension brought about by "man 's" natural ability and motivation for invention and innovation. <#> Since the advancements brought about by the Industrial Revolution, which were also reflected in commerce and agriculture, CHANGES have been increasing in rapidity, in complexity and scale. <#> In transport terms alone, the movement from the horse-and-carriage to the super-sonic jet-propelled aeroplane and the "off-the-shelf" 100 m.p.h. motor car, has been achieved in less than 100 years! <#> However, these new forms of transport require fuel, and so followed the exploitation of oil which has gone along apace over this period. <#> The same scenario applies to food production, and the over-demand of a dynamic increase in world population necessitating the introduction of special innovations in framing practices and animal breeding and husbandry. </p><p> <#> ALTHOUGH "warning bells" were set ringing after the last war indicating that continued "progress" (for want of a better word) of this nature and magnitude could lead to problems of scarcity of natural resources, little notice was taken, even though the effects of the consequences which might ensue were known and well publicised. <#> It was not until events took place which had considerable impact on human beings and their desired lifestyle, did the "person in the street" become aware that there was a threat to their own personal well-being. <#> We, who are old enough, can well remember the London Smog after the last war over a period of three weeks, when an estimated 50,000 deaths were attributed to breathing the over-polluted air, the Abervan slag-heap slippage, when no regulation of this type of waste product was in place, the first oil tanker spillage of the Torre Cannon, the Bhopal Chemical Factory emission in India when 3,000 died and the effects are still being felt, as with the Chernobyl nuclear fall-out. <#> The Exxon Valdes oil tanker spillage in Alaska has been followed by one nearer home recently in Shetland, and oil fires pollution from the Kuwait oil fields shocked us all at the time. <#> Closer to home we have the continued controversy of Selafield effects making us realise the gravity of the earlier near disaster fall-out at Three-Mile Island in the U.S.A.; even nearer home, the Du Pont accidental chemical emission into the Foyle, which probably got little or no international coverage, which makes one wonder if these sort of events are a daily <}> <-> occurrence </[> <+> occurrence </+> </}> on a world scale. </p><p> <#> SOME major events which affect many square miles of territory bring conflict between neighbouring nations, with Scandinavian countries pointing the finger at Britain for the effects of acid rain on their land and forests, or, on a much greater scale, the U.S.A. and Europe accrediting changes in weather and climate to the massive scale of the destruction of the South American rain forests. </p><p> <#> Led by initiatives in the United States dating back to the early 1970s and the recent dedication of the European Community to effect environmental policies attempting to ensure a sustainable environmental future, considerable compliance requirements are now in place and these are supported by the appropriate legislation to effect severe penalties (fines up to <*> pound sign </*> 10 million) on the "polluter" and making avoidance of duty of care relevant to the high risk of legal action. </p><p> <#> As this series progresses, the author hopes to examine the issues which form the make-up of our environment, such as flora, fauna, climate, traffic and human beings and their cultural and economic needs, etc. relating these to the constructive viewpoints that a sustainable future can be achieved providing we all have a sense of awareness and a will to create and then maintain a worthwhile world for generations to follow. </p><p> <bold> <#> Only 40 years ago we saw our planet from space for the first time. <#> We saw it as a small unsuspended ball in space, comprising, not, as we think of it as people, of buildings and highways, but of soils, water, vegetation and clouds and it is these we must preserve. </bold> </p></I>
