I 'd be involved in that you know and help to run things for kids and different things <#> In the meantime I 'm trying to get off a couple of me uhm <,> what do you call it uh <,> maybe the network now at their AGM I might resign from that cos I 'm in from the very beginning <{2> <[2> you know </[2> you you get energy goes up and goes down you <{3> <[3> know </[3> <,> <#> But uhm <,> that 's me involvement in <{4> <[4> the community </[4><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[4> Right <,> so </[4> </{4> you 'd be quite at quite a regional level really<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Aye I think I would <#> I forgot also that I 'm a member of NIWAF in Belfast The Northern Ireland Women 's Federation <#> <{> <[> I 'm on </[> the management board<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[> Oh right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right so you 're quite involved <{> <[> then </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[> I would <.> ha </.> </[> </{> I would<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> And when did you become when did you move to <,> uhm <,> go from say local to regional <#> When would you say that that <.> chan </.> how long have you been involved at a regional level <#> <{> <[> How many years </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[> In in </[> </{> well I 'd say in the last four or five <{> <[> you know <#> Yeah yeah yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[> Four or five years <#> Alright </[> </{> <#> Well I 'll have to tailor this to suit cos I 'm <,> sort of expecting people to be at local <,> looking <{1> <[1> at going on to <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[1> <#> Are you thinking of getting involved in a public body <{2> <[2> at all </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[1> Yes that 's right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> I am I 'm looking at the Arts and uhm <#> I 've wrote it down here somewhere now<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Oh well don't worry <#> <{> <[> It doesn't </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[> It 's uh the </[> </{> the uhm <,> where am I now <,> the Department of <{> <[> Culture </[> Arts and Leisures <#> In my spare spare time I like to paint <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[> Culture </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> And I would would 've done different things and <.> di </.> had a few exhibitions over the years <#> Years ago now<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> But and then with all the other involvement I kind of but I 'd like to get back into it <#> But I 'd be interested in that Arts <{1> <[1> Council </[1> and stuff like that <#> <{2> <[2> So </[2> that 's where Wendy and then maybe drop a few of my other things you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> But I 'll keep on Women 's Aid and I 'll keep on the Victim Support you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Okay uhm <,> you see when you became involved in public life <{> <[> was </[> there anything that worried you about it<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Och aye <#> Uhm I had a low self-esteem you know and I thought uh <,> uhm <,> do I know anything or you know the lack of knowledge <#> Would I be stupid or would I come out with things you <{> <[> know and </[> <#> But I learned just to listen <#> You know I 'd be a good listener now<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> And uhm <,> I remember one woman annoying me because she kept repeating what some man said to beside her<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> And then I thought well you know she mightn't be that stupid like you know cos she was agreeing with him you know <#> And yet I think no that 's not the way I would go <#> But I would just take into account and listen to what people were doing and different especially this Partnership meeting cos it 's so deep things that they 're talking about and half of them 's all <,> bullshit for here <&> laughter </&> <#> And I did say that one day that a meeting was going on and on <#> And I says excuse me I said <,> in my ignorance I says but I have give up my time to come here today <#> You some of them are there <,> paid to be there <{1> <[1> statutory you know </[1> <#> And I said there 's an awful lot of bullshit being talked about <#> And they all started to laugh <,> you <{2> <[2> know </[2> <,> <#> And and the meeting was over in about twenty minutes <{3> <[3> after that <#> Do you know </[3> <#> So like I mean maybe that 's <,> <.> pa </.> but I 've got me voice now but then at the very beginning oh it was <.> ter </.> you know <,> <#> Do I know anything or what do I know <&> laughter </&> <#> You know that kind of an oul doubting <{4> <[4> you know </[4> <#> A lot of women would doubt themselves if they 'd had the capabilities <#> And then yet <,> when you get in and you get a bit of training and you <{5> <[5> know <,> I think it 's </[5><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[1> Yeah mhm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[3> Right <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[4> Yeah </[4> </{4><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[5> Mhm </[5> </{5> <#> What do you think gives it gives you your voice <.> gi </.> makes you more<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> I think you have to be passionate to do it to change things<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right <#> Is that what motivated you<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Mm oh God God<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> I 'll get onto that in a <.> se </.> <#> How what did what did you hope to get out of the experience <#> Apart from just changing things <{> <[> what would you </[> you yourself<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[> I don't know </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> I think it came from me schooling <#> Because I was schooled at a time in the <,> <.> fif </.> forty fifties fifties when uhm women weren't you know supposed to look up or do anything <#> And at school I was told I 'd never amount to anything <&> laughter </&> <#> Bad thing <#> So I think that 's what motivated me then <#> Uh when I reared me family <,> and uh <.> star </.> they started to <.> l </.> to leave the nest I started to look outside and think yeah I could do them things you <{1> <[1> know </[1> <#> A bit like your man in the Black you know I could do that you <{2> <[2> know </[2> <&> reference to character in 'Boys From the Black Stuff' </&> <#> But uhm I think it 's being told you 're you 're no good at anything and then knowing rightly you are you know <{3> <[3> that 's </[3> that kind of thing <#> That 's probably motivated me way back to go out and do stuff<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> And then I had a passion for for uhm against violence of any kind like in domestic violence we we started up here you know so <,> <#> Still I 'm in it you know so <#> That 's I suppose passion for the subjects and passion for to change <{1> <[1> things </[1> but also a bit of personal you know I could do I can do better <{2> <[2> than </[2> I have been doing you know <#> Cos I would 've been that type of uh in that era where I left work when I got married had me family didn't go back til work <,> but did menial jobs like cleaning houses and stuff <#> And I think of what I did do you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Like but anyway <,> and then I you know thinking I wasn't good enough for a long long time <{> <[> <,> and then I realised <#> Yeah </[> yeah to develop myself yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[> Right to to to develop yourself </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Mhm <#> Uhm and you said now you mentioned already you it took a while to develop your voice and that <{1> <[1> that you were </[1> really nervous to <{2> <[2> speak and that </[2> <#> Uhm what uhm have you any current worries or concern about your role<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[1> That 's right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[2> Mm oh yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Aye in the Partnership I feel maybe I 'm not speaking out enough because I 'm there to represent women 's groups in Fermanagh <{> <[> you </[> know <#> And with the new money coming now from peace too it it 's all towards uhm economic you know and there 's no money for groups now or you know it 's very hard to access money<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> And uh I know any of me other community you see there 's seven people from the community on it <#> There 's seven from the council <#> And there 's seven from <.> stat </.> statutory bodies<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> And there 's another one there 's another one uh business and something <#> But it 's all geared towards business and stuff <#> And the lock of pound that they 're throwing out they 're throwing it out through training<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> You know or through sports and stuff like you <{> <[> know </[> <#> So I uh I the last partnership that I was on I had a better voice in it<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Because it was all working for the community and there was applications coming in and we were sitting going through a stack of applications and you felt you were doing something <#> You were saying right that wee play group needs something <{1> <[1> <,> or that </[1> one there maybe has got money from somewhere else so we we 'll look at it later <#> You know you <.> ha </.> you were kind of given a a role <#> But this time it 's all more of a talking shop and there seems to be decisions you know made before and brought to the meeting you know to <{2> <[2> for </[2> ratification you know that kind of thing you know <#> So I don't feel as empowered as I did on the but yet I 'm delighted to be in on this victim 's group <{3> <[3> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[3> some group you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> <[3> Mhm </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Mhm <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Maybe I 'm talking too much <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> No no no <#> Is there any aspects of of the involvement you find psychologically off-putting<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> Aye now there 's a<ICE-IRE:S1B-075$A> <#> Don't don't <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> you need to answer <{> <[> straight away or </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-075$B> <#> <[> No I know </[> </{> I know <#> <.> Psycho </.> well I suppose you see you 'd you 'd be <.> think </.> I have been I know I have been used in photographs and there 's even this week 's hair report on hair and make-up but that was me own because I went to for Women 's Aid <#> But in stuff for the partnership <,> I would be pulled in for photographs as a token woman</I>
