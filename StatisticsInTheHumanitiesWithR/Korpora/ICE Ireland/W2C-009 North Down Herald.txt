<W2C-009 North Down Herald><I><W2C-009$A><h> <#> Strike Threat Looms <#> Mandi Millar </h><p> <#> Ards Council employees are set to strike unless threats to their pay, conditions and jobs are lifted. </p><p> <#> The shake-up in their terms of employment has been described as the most ruthless ever attempted by a local government in preparation for Compulsory Competitive tendering. </p><p> <#> As animosity amongst workers mounts, local services could be thrown into chaos if union members ballot for strike action after a meeting with the council next week. </p><p> <quote> <#> "In my mind there is no doubt that the feeling of the union members is that there will have to be strike action," </quote> said Colin Irons of the General and Municipal Boilermakers ' Union. </p><p> <#> At a mass meeting last week, members of the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA), the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union (ATGWU) and the General and Municipal Boilermakers ' Union (GMB) rejected new terms and conditions which, their authors believe, would make the council more competitive in keeping contracts in-house when competing with the private sector. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We have totally rejected what the council is offering the workers. <#> The ramifications of what 's on the table would be just too far-reaching in terms of what it would cost employees financially," </quote> said Mr Irons. </p><h> <#> Stalemate </h><p> <#> The only chink of hope, he said, was the fact the council had accepted the unions ' rejection of what was being offered and their willlingness to meet representatives in a bid to solve the stalemate. <#> Mr Irons, however, refused to discuss exactly what was being offered until further discussions had taken place. </p><p> <#> And David Fallows, Ards Town Clerk, was equally tight-lipped, declining to comment through the Press on <quote> "industrial relations" </quote> . </p><p> <#> The package being offered under the CCT regime would affect employees across the board. <#> Ards Borough Council has responsibility for refuse collection and disposal, street cleansing, public toilets, sports halls and leisure centres, swimming pools, burial grounds, parks and open spaces, abattoirs, tourism and cultural facilities. </p><p> <quote> <#> "In preparation for CCT the council is attempting to undertake a totally different formula for pay and once that 's introduced it will cut across every department," </quote> said Mr Irons. <quote> <#> "The only people it won't affect are probably the Town Clerk and Chief Executive." </quote> <#> Mr Irons said there was increasing animosity amongst employees. <quote> <#> "The workers have absolutely rejected what 's been offered. <#> I can't state that too strongly," </quote> he said. </p><h> <#> Strike </h><p> <quote> <#> "I assume that after we meet with the council there will be a ballot and strike action, I feel, would be a real possibility." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Irons said Ards was the first council to be so <quote> "far-reaching" </quote> in its preparation for CCT. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The terms being offered to employees are certainly the worst I have ever seen,"</quote> said the official, who has worked with councils across the province in their bids to prepare for competitive tendering for former in-house jobs. </p><p> <#> He claimed that 80 per cent of councils in England retained their contracts without interfering with employees ' conditions. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Belfast City Council hasn't even touched its pay and conditions," </quote> he added. </p></I><I><W2C-009$B><h> <#> Condemned homes are a drinking den: councillor <#> Helen Carson </h><p> <#> A post-war Comber housing development has become a dumping ground and its empty properties are being used as drinking dens, an Ards councillor has claimed. </p><p> <#> Kathleen Coulter has accused the Housing Executive of failing to meeting deadlines for demolishing the buildings which, she believes, are now in a dangerous condition. </p><p> <#> Vandals are intent on the <quote> "wholesale destruction" </quote> of the estate, claimed the councillor, who said local pensioners were becoming <quote> "virtual prisoners" </quote> in their homes because they were too scared to go out. </p><p> <#> The Orlit developments, as the houses are commonly known, were erected after the Second World War as a short-term solution to chronic housing shortages. </p><p> <#> But in recent years an order passed by Parliament put the onus on the Housing Executive to demolish such housing, as it had long passed its intended lifespan. </p><p> <#> Councillor Kathleen Coulter claimed: <quote> "The Housing Executive has made countless promises. <#> It has told us the properties will be knocked down in October - but we have heard this so many times before." </quote> </p><h> <#> Thugs </h><p> <#> With so many vacant properties, thugs have gone on a wrecking spree in the development, destroying everything in their wake, the councillor told the <bold> Herald and Post. </bold> </p><p> <quote> <#> "They also hold drinking parties in the empty properties," </quote> she claimed. </p><p> <#> The councillor added that remaining residents, who are mostly elderly, are desperate to be rehoused, as they have become virtual prisoners in their homes. </p><p> <quote> <#> "People in the area are just too scared to go out." </quote> </p><p> <#> Ards Borough Council has demanded that the Housing Executive demolish the old houses this month. </p><p> <#> And Mrs Coulter explained the housing development was being replaced by five different phases, with the first two complete. </p><p> <quote> <#> "One woman moved out on a Friday and by Monday the flat was stripped," </quote> she said. </p><p> <# > Mrs Coulter said the devastation included: <#> <*> bullet point </*> Slates and tiles ripped from roofs. <#> <*> bullet point </*> Fixtures, such as toilets, smashed. <#> <*> bullet point </*> Doors and windows broken. <#> <*> bullet point </*> Stairways destroyed. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The vandals are moving into the houses as quickly as the people are moving out," </quote> added Mrs Coulter. </p><p> <#> The Housing Executive has assured Ards Borough Council that it has secured the properties, but Mrs Coulter says the thugs simply break in again. </p><p> <#> She stressed that people caught damaging property in this way could be prosecuted, and she urged anyone who knew anything to get in touch with the police. </p><p> <quote> <#> "They cannot be allowed to get away with this," </quote> added the councillor. </p><p> <#> Mrs Coulter added that the technical services department of the Housing Executive <quote> "should feel obliged to do a tidy up and clear weeds in the area" </quote> . </p></I><I><W2C-009$C><h> <#> Disabled losing out to taxis? <#> Caroline Cooper </h><p> <#> Even taxis have more parking spaces than disabled drivers in Bangor town centre, it was claimed this week. </p><p> <#> Bangor resident Tom O'Brien said that he was <quote> "deeply concerned" </quote> by the lack of adequate disabled persons ' parking spaces in the town and, in particular, at the top of Main Street. </p><p> <#> A disabled driver, Mr O'Brien, from Glastry Gardens in Kilcooley estate, was responding to a recent report in the <bold> Herald and Post </bold> which outlined a Bangor mother 's concern at <quote> "nuisance" </quote> disabled drivers. </p><p> <#> She claimed they were <quote> "causing havoc" </quote> in the town centre. </p><p> <quote> <#> "What I would like to ask this woman, and anyone else who may agree with her, is where are disabled people supposed to park, when from Abbey Street to Lower Main Street there are just four spaces for disabled people?" </quote> he asked. </p><h> <#> Disabled </h><p> <#> With around 7,000 disabled people in North Down and Ards area, the Bangor man said it was a <quote> "disgrace" </quote> there were only four disabled spaces in the immediate town centre. <quote> <#> "If I want to go into Bangor on a Saturday, the only parking spaces for the disabled are at the bottom of Main Street near to H Samuel 's. <#> There 's just no way I could walk up the hill to the top of the street with my disability," </quote> said Mr O'Brien. </p><p> <quote> <#> "There are disabled spaces in the car park at the marina. <#> That is all very well, but it is even further away and impossible for me, and many other people like me, to walk that distance," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> Taxis, the Bangor man claimed, currently have more room to park than disabled drivers. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Where 's the justice in that?" </quote> asked Mr O'Brien. </p><p> <#> The Orange Badge holder said he and many others like him were becoming increasingly anxious about the <quote> "misuse" </quote> of disabled spaces. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It infuriates me when even these few precious disabled parking spaces are taken up by fully able-bodied people who would be perfectly capable of parking further away and walking into the centre. </p><p> <#> "Ideally, what I would like to see is the spaces on one side of the street at the top half of Main Street designated for disabled drivers, allowing them to park and shop with ease," </quote> he suggested. </p><p> <#> It is understood the Department of Environment is currently monitoring the use of disabled parking spaces within the town, following the introduction of the one-way system in May 1992. </p></I><I><W2C-009$D><h> <#> Health Unit slammed for 'cutting corners' </h><p> <#> North Down and Ards Community Unit has been accused of <quote> "cutting corners" </quote> in providing health care in the community. </p><p> <#> Outraged by the local health unit 's decision to withdraw home helps from preparing meals for hundreds of disabled and elderly people, Alliance 's Siobhan Laird attacked the government 's entire community care programme. </p><p> <quote> <#> "When the government first proposed moving people from institutional care into the community, a government committee appeared to investigate this matter and reported in 1988, warning that <quote> 'care in the community is not a cheap option' </quote>," said Ms Laird. </p><p> <#> And she insisted the government has done the reverse by <quote> "treating it as a cheap option" </quote> . </p><p> <quote> <#> "The government has consistently tried to sell us community care as a product which will enhance the quality of life and broaden the choices of coping with physical or mental disability," </quote> she said. </p><h> <#> Service </h><p> <quote> <#> "I believe in Bangor such conservative policies have resulted in elderly and disabled people being increasingly abandoned into the community. <#> These policies are stifling choice," </quote> added Ms Laird. </p><p> <#> Attacking North Down and Ards Community Unit, the Alliance member said no-one would be fooled by assurances that a new meals-on-wheels service, which is replacing the meals service currently provided by home helps, would lead to quality enhancement. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The unit assures us that the decision to have frozen meals delivered to disabled and elderly people, instead of having them prepared in the person 's house by a home help, is not a money saving measure," </quote> she said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Do they think we are all stupid enough to swallow that one? <#> Of course this new policy is about cutting cost because it is about cutting corners in personal care. <#> As a community we must oppose it," </quote> concluded Ms Laird. </p><p> <#> It is understood the North Down and Ards Unit may introduce the new meals-on-wheels system within the next few months. </p><p> <#> However it is believed a small number may still be provided with a homehelp at meal times and will not be part of the new scheme. </p><p> <#> Under the new system, clients will be issued with a menu card at the beginning of each week and will be asked to pick the meals they wish to eat. </p><p> <#> These will then be collected by an outside catering firm and delivered by a female driver to individual homes. </p><p> <#> The food will then be heated up by the elderly and disabled clients themselves. </p><p> <#> Each meal will cost the individual <*> pound sign </*>1. </p></I><I><W2C-009$E><h> <#> 'Journey in Understanding' </h><p> <#> A 'JOURNEY in Understanding' will begin at Belfast 's YMCA later this month. </p><p> <#> The programme of the same name will promote growth in mutual understanding and cross community awareness between Protestant and Catholic communities. </p><p> <#> The 10-week series of group workshops, bringing together people from diverse backgrounds, begins on Monday September 27. </p><p> <#> City YMCA cross-community co-ordinator David Porter believes the programme is an opportunity for people to meet, develop friendships and awareness of the issues which both divide and unite them. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It 's the start of a journey in which all are committed to grow in respect and acceptance of others in order to live and work together in the city," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> The course costs <*> pound sign </*> 15, or <*> pound sign </*> 5 for senior citizens, students and the unemployed. </p><p> <#> Each series in the Journey of Understanding is limited to a maximum of 16 adults made up of equal numbers from both communities. </p><p> <#> Participants will also have the chance to go on a residential weekend. </p></I><I><W2C-009$F><h> <#> I love ya, tomorrow </h><p> <#> Two young Belfast girls have been given the chance to play one of the most sought after theatre roles of them all. </p><p> <#> Gillian Smith (10) and Denise Farrelly (13) will be playing the coveted part of little orphan Annie in the Arts Musical Youth 's new production which opens on Tuesday. </p><p> <#> The show, directed by Peter Kennedy, runs until Sunday evening at the Botanic Avenue theatre. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile, at the Old Museum Arts Centre, the Armada Festival begins on Monday with the first of six productions by young Irish companies. </p></I>
