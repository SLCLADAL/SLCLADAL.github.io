<ICE-IRE:S1B-068 Revenue panel><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> Uhm thank-you uh Chairman <#> Good morning Mr MacDomhnaill <#> Uhm sorry to <,> have to drag you back out of retirement and I 'll be as quick as I can <#> Uhm may I ask you Mr MacDomhnaill uh whether you think the time has come for uhm a a modern Revenue Act <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Uhm <,> separate from all the Finance Acts and uhm <,> certainly it 's it 's uh something which should be given serious consideration <#> Uhm I would think that uh one very important thing which we as Commissioners have enjoyed right from the beginning is a very strong degree of independence in carrying out our functions <#> And I would hope that any sort of uhm structure that would be set up set up would preserve that independence <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> I think that 's important but I think the the reason the the the matter springs to mind is <,> and whether the Committee should recommend that there ought to be a new Revenue Act is the explanation that you gave the chairman yesterday <,> uhm you know <,> as to the background of the Commissioners that stems from nineteen twenty-three recommendations as I understand it <,> uh regularised by the nineteen thirty-four Act <#> Uh and you know in nineteen ninety-nine that seems very outdated uh <.> an </.> and uh perhaps in need of revision<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Uhm <,> well the fundamental thing that you would be asking yourself is <,> what particular change you might have in mind <#> Because it does have statutory authority at the moment <#> Admittedly it 's spread out over a lot of legislation and going right back to the very foundation of the State uhm <,> even before the Ministers ' and Secretaries ' Act <#> Uh <,> so if you were going to draw up uhm a Revenue Act <,> it would probably be time when you would have to consider uhm the type of structure that you had in mind <#> Uh were you still going to preserve a Board of Commissioners independent if you like in the implementation process<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> Well you see <,> one of the reasons that causes me to <.> pro </.> <,> uh prompts me to ask the question that <,> uh <,> the Board of the Commissioners itself seems to be a somewhat nebulous uh concept <#> I mean you explained yesterday uh to the chairman uh and I quote uhm <,> uh you were explaining that 's the way the board functions quote <#> I say the board in the sense that we use it in Revenue <,> as a short <,> as a sort <,> as a sort of short-cut term for any member <,> any Revenue Commissioner <#> <.> An </.> <,> I 'd have to put it to you Mr MacDomhnaill that I think most members of the public uh felt that there was uhm you know a modern cohesive uh integrated board functioning at the top of the Revenue Commissioners and that it had a chief executive <,> somebody who had manifestly uh you know the number one responsibility <#> Now <,> talk to you about the changes and I know you 've made a lot of changes yourself <#> But <,> that doesn't seem to be an accurate picture from what we 've learned in the course of these hearings<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> I think uhm <,> there is a modern board <#> I would like to think that the board that we had uh during my chairmanship was uh fitted <.> th </.> description of a modern board with a corporate plan <,> with regular meetings evaluating that plan <#> But<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> But is it not uh uh uh uh <,> you know where we left off evidence with Mr Curran and and so on <#> I mean <,> at that point and prior to your becoming chairman <,> we established <,> did we not <,> that there were no regular board meetings <,> there was no agenda <,> there are no minutes <,> and it was difficult to establish <,> Mr Curran certainly seemed to have the view that the chairman was <&Latin> primus inter pares </&Latin><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> That would be correct <#> He was the Chief Executive <,> he had the accountability uh to the Public Accounts Committee and indeed to the Minister <#> Uhm what we <,> in recent times we have <,> I mean with strategic management and all that <,> we have a regular <,> I should say we now I 'm retired for over a year uh <#> I think you 'll excuse that lapse if I use uh that terminology <,> that Revenue uh has uh a formal board meeting <,> that there are regular minutes and plans <#> This board actually is very much integrated now into the management of the organisation <#> But you have to make a distinction between the management of the organisation and the execution of certain statutory functions which are governed by legislation <#> And as I explained yesterday <,> that just doesn't apply to the Commissioners <#> That applies to various officers uh set up under the Customs and Excise legislation I think <,> that responsibilities and authorities are given by statute <#> Now <{> <[1> it 's only </[1> in that context in the context of the statutory functions <,> those functions which have to be done by the Board that you have Commissioners with identified areas of responsibility <#> They will make the orders <#> Of course that changes with the Commissioners<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> <[1> But it </[1> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> But in terms of making orders and I don't want to dwell on this point too long <,> uh Mr MacDomhnaill but you know we seem to be reaching a conclusion uhm you know informally in this committee that uh it 's an area that we will have to look at <#> In terms of making orders <,> I mean isn't it extraordinary that we have now progressed as far as yourself <,> the former chairman and we still don't know who originated SIM two six three <#> Now uh is that fair to <{> <[1> us <,> </[1> <#> That here we have been here for I can't remember now eight or nine days <,> and a simple question about who originated SIM two six three <,> we can't get an answer<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> <[1> Well I think that </[1> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Well it came up now the evidence given was that a former Principal Inspector uhm <,> Mr Brown <,> was the inspector who put that together <#> It 's not actually<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> I I don't think we quite got that <#> I I I think we we we got an opinion that it might have been the <{> <[1> gentleman who 's now deceased </[1> <#> But I mean <,> can I ask you the question like I mean who was it <,> you 're <,> you 're the former chairman<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> <[1> Well from what <unclear> several sylls </unclear> I might say </[1> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> Who who did originate it<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Well <,> as I say <,> I thought now from the evidence that this is within the Chief Inspector 's uh office <,> that Mr Brown or somebody in his <,> under him <,> would have been the person to do it<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> And and his job again remind me was what<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Now uh income tax technical services <#> And and part of that<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> What what does income tax technical services mean<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Well <,> it it meant that difficult problems might come up in relation to the <.> administra </.> <,> the actual implementation of any section on the income tax side right across the country <,> they will research it and give a view <#> And they would also uh back up uh legislation or suggest<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> But this was a fairly big decision to defer a section of the Act effectively <#> I mean could <{> <[> somebody in that position make that decision </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Yeah <#> I think if you will look at the the the SIM in question <,> most of it is drawn completely from the legislation <#> It 's simply setting out uh what the Chief Inspector 's branch considered had to be done under the legislation by Chief Inspector staff <#> There would have been other instructions sent out in the Collector General 's area because it was a Collector General function as well <#> Now the actual <,> I can understand how a holding clause would be put in <,> in relation to the examination of the forms because what you have to make up your mind <,> I 'm just saying conjecture <,> uhm what you have to make up your mind about is <,> are you going to do this centrally <,> or is is it going to be something which will be uh something for District Inspectors only to to <,> uhm or will it be a matter to be dealt with in <,> inquiry branch or investigation branch <#> All that would <.> b </.> have to be gone into <#> That 's what I imagine would justify any holding operation <#> Why it <.> did </.> <,> it didn't <,> it what seemed to be a temporary holding operation became an almost uh permanent moratorium <#> I don't understand <,> I I don't know <,> I can't give any direct evidence about that<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> Well you see <,> when we talk about a Chief Executive and a modern management system <,> in the Revenue <,> I mean isn't it extraordinary that uhm <,> you know you haven't referred to yourself as the Chief Executive in the exchanges that we 've we 've just had <#> But I mean isn't it extraordinary that such a <,> that in such an important matter that as Chief Executive you don't know<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> But I wasn't Chief Executive at this particular time<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> You were Chief Executive very shortly after it <#> You were Commissioner from eighty-seven <{> <[> you </[> have been Commissioner since nineteen ninety <,> uh for twelve years this has been put in abeyance<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> <[> Yes <.> ye </.> But I <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> say that </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$C> <#> Chairman from nineteen ninety<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> Chairman from nineteen ninety and for twelve years this has been put in abeyance <#> It still is in abeyance <#> Uh and and uh you can't tell me why<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Well <,> I suppose uhm <,> I could put it this way <,> there are eight stacks of these instructions <,> <.> o </.> covering all manner of actions that have to be taken <,> right through from uh auditing to straightforward things which I mentioned yesterday like new uh computer <,> changes required by enhancements in the computer function <#> So there 's all manner of instructions and things have to be delegated very substantially <#> If I if I as chairman <{> <[> was still </[> doing what I was<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> <[> But </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> But were you completely unaware of the manifest unrest among some of your own staff about this having been put in abeyance and never revoked<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> I was<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> You were completely unaware of that<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> No I I<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> I mean what are the reporting links <{1> <[1> in the Revenue </[1> <#> How does that kind of thing get up as far as you as chairman<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> <[1> No I I forgot I forgot to put in </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$C> <#> <unclear> several sylls <unclear> you asked the question <#> Were you completely unaware of it<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> I have I have to uh qualify that that by saying that it is mentioned in Mr Moriarty 's document <,> but it it carries the rider that it 's not much use to implementing that without other uhm powers to go to<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> And is Mr Moriarty 's paper the only formal notification <#> Do you talk to any of the people down the line<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Oh I I certainly do and I have regular meetings but as I say <,> the the <,> as chairman you 're largely concerned with management issues <,> with a huge resource <,> six thousand staff <,> you 've a changing agenda of legislation <,> you 've interaction with the other Commissioners on what 's unfolding <,> and as chairman uh <,> you can't be doing what you would do if you were uh an Assistant Secretary <,> you can't be doing what you would do <,> and things have to be delegated<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> All right <#> Did you know uhm Mr MacDomhnaill that in the annual report uh published on the thirty-first of December <,> the annual report for the thirty-first of December nineteen eighty-six <,> paragraph a hundred and thirty-three <,> reads as follows <,> of the official Revenue Commissioners ' report <,> <quote> an inspector may require a deposit-taker to make available for inspection all declarations by non-residents </quote> <#> <.> Di </.> did you know that was in the official report<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Well uh <,> it 's a long time <#> I mean I <,> I would have read the report at the time<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> But I mean it seems to <,> you know suggest to us members of the public that a deposit <,> a deposit-taker would be required to do precisely that when in fact it had been put in abeyance<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Yeah well <,> I I would take that interpretation myself <#> <{> <[> So as </[> I say <,> when I <.> l </.> when when<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> <.> Ou </.> <.> ou </.> ought our attention not have been drawn to the existence of SMI two six three and that this was for the moment put on ice<ICE-IRE:S1B-068$B> <#> Uhm <,> as I say <,> that is if there was a a consciousness of that <,> I think that 's a good point <#> <{> <[> But uhm </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-068$A> <#> Can I go back without labouring the point uh Mr uh MacDomhnaill uhm to your evidence to the chairman yesterday uh about the matter in the <.> com </.> in the report of the Comptroller Auditor General in respect of which uh you gave uh I won't put it stronger than inaccurate uhm <,> uh inaccurate account to the Public Accounts Committee and uh to the C and AG <,> uh or to the Accounts Committee and uh corrected it in the C and AG uh report <#> uh I 'm referring to the phrase <,> <quote> in nineteen ninety-one we approached all the financial institutions on the basis of our own analysis of the movement in accounts </quote> <#> Now <,> you cleared that up with the chairman yesterday that <,> that was wrong <#> And you acknowledged the significance of it given the position taken up since by Allied Irish Banks <#> But isn't there another area in which it is significant</I>
