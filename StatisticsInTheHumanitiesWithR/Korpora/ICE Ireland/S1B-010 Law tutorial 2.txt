because that would take them into the uh reaches of of <,> but if they were just driving along <,> eating icecream and then they drive into somebody <,> they 've been negligent and they will be liable as would any other road-user <#> Uhm <,> or if the roof falls in <,> in this <,> in this building <,> let 's say this is a school that falls on top of us <,> uh there would be liability on the part of the <.> l </.> the education authority <#> There 's no problem that way <#> It 's whenever they 're exercising statutory powers or performing a public service in a very obvious sense that there can be difficulties <#> That 's what these cases are all essentially concerned with <#> Are there <,> has anybody any questions about them before we start <,> or do you just want to go through them and <,> anybody any questions no <#> Have got people generally got the the flavour of this from the <,> from the reading <#> I mean in a sense it 's it 's it 's <,> this is more like administrative law to be perfectly honest with you than tort law <,> but the two overlap <#> So <,> Anns and Merton <#> Tell us about Anns and Merton <#> Uhm <,> uhm <,> where 's Olivia <#> <{> <[> Olivia </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-010$B> <#> <[> Here </[> </{> <,> it 's uhm <,> there was a building and there was a crack in the wall and it was because the foundations were only two foot <,> two foot something <{1> <[1> deep </[1> instead of three foot <{2> <[2> deep </[2> <#> So uhm there was <,> there wasn't blame on the builder <#> It was for the local authority because they didn't inspect it properly<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Right <#> Now how did <,> </.> becau </.> <,> <.> yo </.> <.> yo </.> you 're absolutely right <,> and there was legislation in question <#> So the local authority had the power to introduce bye-laws to regulate building activities and so on and so forth <#> Uhm how did Lord Wilberforce arrive at the conclusion that the local authority could be responsible <,> liable in negligence <,> in this case <#> He introduced what <#> Obviously what is too <,> again if you think about Anns and Merton <,> you 're you 're you 're on the uh opening up of liability again <,> so that 's what the courts are wanting <,> they 're wanting to impose liability anyway <#> Lord Wilberforce introduced something very specific in relation to the exercise of statutory powers in the imposition of negligence liability<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$B> <#> Uhm he introduced the two-stage test <,> was it<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Well he introduced the two-stage test <,> that 's correct <,> in relation to the duty of care which was pitched towards you know <,> you have to give me a policy reason why we shouldn't impose liability <#> But he also introduced something much more germane <,> to the question of of statutory <,> powers <#> Anybody come across this <#> Well <,> you <,> I mean <,> you should have come across it <#> Uhm <,> he introduced a distinction <,> and said that liability could rest when <,> <#> There was a distinction <,> <#> The first word is like the police except you change the e to a y<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$C> <#> He 's talking about a policy operational thing<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Right the policy operational distinction <#> Now tell us the context of the policy operational distinction <,> or tell us what that means<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$C> <#> Me<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-010$C> <#> Uh <,> the public authority is <,> making policy decisions <,> uh ie deciding where money is going uh <,> prioritising things <,> uhm those decisions are not justiciable <#> If I ever uhm in actual day-to-day operations <,> uhm I make <,> a bad decision <,> uh a negligent decision then that may be compensable<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Yeah <#> Basically <,> a policy operational distinction was introduced by Lord Wilberforce where he said that <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-010$C> <#> Was that not introduced in Home Office versus Dorset Yacht<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Well no the policy operational distinction term was used by Lord Wilberforce <#> The the idea the idea of exercising your powers within <,> or liability whenever you 're exercising your lawful powers was the Home Office and Dorset Yacht approach <#> And Lord Wilberforce emphasised that you can owe a duty of care whenever you 're making an operational decision <#> Basically <,> I mean <,> the the proposition is that local authorities are given special powers by Parliament <#> Parliament delegates powers downwards to local authorities <#> Now prior to Anns and Merton <,> to refer back to the Home Office and Dorset Yacht <,> prior to that there <,> basically the position was <,> if you were exercising your powers lawfully in the sense that you were making a decision within the four corners of your legislative power <,> if you 're doing that <,> you don't owe duties of care <,> you can't be liable <#> Because in a sense if you look at it in a very <,> okay it 's a public law perspective <,> but if you look at it you 're not acting unlawfully so how on earth <,> in a in a public law sense <,> so how on earth could you be liable in a private law sense <#> It would create uh an inconsistency <#> So Home Office and Dorset Yacht said if you 've been given powers by Parliament <,> the powers have four squares and as long as you stay within those four squares <,> or sorry four corners sorry <,> as long as you stay within the four corners of the square you don't owe duties of care <#> Anns and Merton changed that in the sense that it said <,> okay <,> you 're given legislation by <.> p </.> <,> uh legislative powers <,> uh by Parliament <#> If you 're making a policy decision which is a decision about how many inspectors you 're going to employ <,> uh so and so <,> involves an allocation of resources question <#> If you 're doing that <,> that 's not justiciable <,> it 's not for the courts <,> that 's fine <,> that 's not for court <#> But he says once you 've made your decision <,> once you 've put in place your <,> uh decision-making machinery if you like <,> a day-to-day decision <,> taken within that framework <,> you can owe duties of care there <,> and he doesn't really talk <,> he doesn't talk about Home Office and Dorset Yacht and <.> act </.> acting outside your powers <#> He just starts talking about day-to-day decisions <#> Lord Wilberforce was trying to open up the parameters of liability <#> So he said if you talk about policy matters <,> no duty of care <,> but if you 're talking about operational matters <,> then you can owe a duty of care <#> Anns and Merton <#> Does everybody understand that point from Anns and Merton <,> because it 's central to all subsequent case law <,> <#> Yeah <#> Right <#> Anns and Merton <#> Well then you tell us uhm Charles what X and Bedfordshire said <,> what X and Bedfordshire did <,,> <#> Or anybody if if you don't have it at hand <,> anybody tell us what X and Bedfordshire was the authority for <#> And again if you think <,> Anns and Merton <,> the courts were trying to expand liability <,> X and Bedfordshire <,> the courts are very much trying to limit liability <#> What did the courts say about when public authorities could be liable in respect of the exercise of statutory powers <#> Okay the context of X and Bedfordshire is very different in the sense that you 're dealing with child abuse and education cases <#> And we 're going to focus on the child abuse cases <#> It 's a very different context from a building case <#> Well what did X and Bedfordshire say about the exercise of statutory powers and when local authorities could be liable for the exercise of statutory powers <#> Anybody <#> X and Bedfordshire <#> The courts were <,> they took a very restrictive approach <#> Can anybody lay out the various steps because it brings together actually the Home Office and Dorset Yacht and Anns and Merton if you like because they return very much this <,> the logic of Home Office and Dorset Yacht in terms of whenever you 're acting within the parameters of your power <#> X and Bedfordshire <#> Anybody<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$D> <#> They said it must show the decision was outside their powers<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Right <#> Yeah which <,> that comes back to Home Office and Dorset <#> X and Bedfordshire <,> always think about this from the perspective that parliament has delegated powers downwards so it 's uh it 's given discretion to local authorities <#> And in X and Bedfordshire cases <,> there 'd been discretions <,> statutory powers given to local authorities <#> And what the House of Lords said in Bedfordshire was <,> first of all if you 're making a if you 're talking about policy decisions <,> and there is no easy distinction between a policy decision and an operational decision but <,> it 's very obvious that we 've a policy decision <,> the House of Lords said if a local authority is making a policy decision <,> it cannot owe a duty of care because those issues are non-justiciable <,> those are matters for the decision-makers themselves <,> for the political process with a small P <#> So if you 're making a policy decision <,> an allocation of resources decision essentially <,> if you 're doing that <,> you do not owe a duty of care <#> That 's not for the courts <,> none of the courts ' business <#> The court then said beneath that <,> if you 're making what <,> in Lord Wilberforce 's terms would be operational <,> decision <,> I don't I can't remember if the House of Lords used that phrase in X and Bedfordshire <,> but beneath that <,> if you 're making what we will call an operational decision for the sake of argument <,> if you 're making an operational decision <,> the House of Lords says you do not owe a duty of care if you 're making an operational decision which is within the parameters of the power that has been given to you <#> Is everybody following this yeah <#> So you don't owe a duty of care in relation to lawful decisions in a public law sense because you 're staying within the parameters of your power <,> <#> So in other words the House of Lords said you only owe a duty of care if you 're dealing with a matter which is not a policy matter <,> if it 's outside the parameters of your power and it says whenever we 're asking whatever if you acted outside the parameters of your power <,> have you acted in a way that is Wednesbury unreasonable <,> which is a public law test and a very very harsh test <#> You basically have to act <,> act like a lunatic basically <,> the public authority has to have acted like a lunatic <,> effectively with all the formulations they talk about <,> a decision that 's outrageous <,> and it 's in defiance of logic and so on and so forth <#> So if they 're going to owe any duty of care <,> not it it can't be a policy matter and you have to have acted Wednesbury unreasonable <#> That then takes you outside the parameters of your power <#> And at that stage the House of Lords then said you will <,> you will <.> satisf </.> you will have to satisfy what else <#> And this is <,> Emma mentioned this at the start of the <,> class<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$E> <#> Foreseeability<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Uh well the third element of that test<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$E> <#> Just <,> fair and reasonable<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> Right <,> fair just and reasonable <#> The House of Lords was basically in X and Bedfordshire making it impossible to obtain damages against the local authority in <,> on the <,> in the facts and circumstance such as that <#> Policy matter it 's not justiciable <,> uh if you 're acting within the parameters of your power in a non-policy matter <,> uh there 's no duty of care owed <#> You have to be acting outside the parameters of your power <,> public law sense <,> Wednesbury unreasonable <,> very very difficult test to satisfy <#> And then <,> you have to convince the court that it 's fair just and reasonable <#> If you think about Anns and Merton and Lord Wilberforce 's two-stage formulation <#> The formulation was something like about foreseeability and proximity <,> and are there policy reasons why we should not impose liability <#> The fair just and reasonable test pitches that question <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and says <,> well you know you really have to convince us that there is a policy <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,> very very very restrictive approach in <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> and a very very restrictive approach in X and Bedfordshire<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$F> <#> Sorry <,> what specifically have to be fair just and reasonable<ICE-IRE:S1B-010$A> <#> In all the circumstances of the case <,> you have to say to the court <,> in all the circumstances of the case <,> look at the context of this case <,> look at the statute <,> look at the purposes of the statute <,> look at how many agencies are involved <,> look at what the effect on us <#> In the light of all of those circumstances we think it is fair and just and reasonable to impose a duty of care <#> And the House of Lords said in these sort of cases <,> basically the House of Lords said <,> local authorities are really trying to do everybody a good turn here <#> These are horrible nasty cases that we 're dealing with and they don't need liability added on as an extra consideration</I>
