<W2E-001 Ulster editorials 1><I><W2E-001$A><h> <#> <bold> EDITORIAL </bold> </h><p> <#> The Government 's announcement that 31 pits are to be closed illustrates the truly uncaring nature of this unfair administration. <#> Despite Mr. <}> <-> Heseltines </-> <+> Heseltine 's </+> </}> umming and erring ('cause he 's realised the size of the anti-government feeling) there is no <}> <-> committment </-> <+> commitment </+> </}> to improving the quality of peoples lives and his feeling of "sadness" for the mining community gives crying crocodiles a bad name. <#> Since 1979 the Conservative party has embarked on the campaign of privatisation and has always defended its policies by uttering the old buzz words like 'free market' and 'accountability'. <#> The glorious revolution they unleashed has witnessed a growing polarity between rich and poor (at its greatest level since the late 1800 's), a rise in the level of unemployment (Labour isn't working eh?), an effective dismantling of the welfare state and (this bit affects you) a reduction in the standard of living for students. <#> The heyday of voodoo economics has been and gone, our national assets have been sold off (anyone seen Sid recently?) we now stand on the edge of an abyss in which severities are stretched to extremes. <#> In other words we 're all doomed! </p><p> <#> However, there is light at the end of the tunnel. <#> Opposition to the government is at an all time high; miners, nuclear power workers, railway workers teachers the unemployed and (hopefully) that humungous sponge they call the student population are uniting to march on parliament. <#> The old system of privatisation has shown itself to be incompetent. <#> Reinvestment is needed, subsidies are called for , education needs expanding, the sick need looking after, industry needs a boost. </p><p> <#> Now is the time to extend the hand of comraderie, put those differences behind you and give the Government the big 'V'. </p></I><I><W2E-001$B><h> <#> <bold> MORNING VIEW </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Peace mission lacks credibility </bold> </h><p> <#> THE close working relationship between Prime Minister John Major and Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux will be under considerable strain when the pair meet for talks this week.<#> And no wonder. </p><p> <#> The willingness of the Government to appease Sinn Fein and the IRA so as to get them to accept the Downing Street Declaration has undermined the security operation to such an extent that the terrorists are now effectively calling the shots, in terms of violence and propaganda. </p><p> <#> The nightly debacle at Heathrow has made security at Europe 's busiest airport a sick joke, yet the Government clings to the mistaken belief that those responsible for these murderous attacks can be persuaded peaceful political aims. </p><p> <#> Government ineptitude has allowed the IRA to make significant gains from its 25 years of shooting and bombing and, as long as this weakness continues in high places, the Provisionals are not going to assume a position where they are merely a marginal political party with less than 10 per cent of electoral support in Northern Ireland and 2 per cent in Eire. </p><p> <#> They believe there are more political concessions in the pipeline and are prepared to kill to secure them. </p><p> <#> Unionists are not only appalled by the Government 's apparent soft line on terrorism and its willingness to do Dublin 's bidding. </p><p> <#> John Major 's Tory back-benchers are also demanding an urgent reappraisal of Government policy to take account of the dangerous situation that has developed in the three months since the signing of the Declaration on December 15. </p><p> <#> Peace has now become the most over-used word in the vocabulary of the political rulers in both London and Dublin as they pathetically wait for the response of the IRA and Sinn Fein to the Declaration, content only to fire a barrage of words. </p><p> <#> John Major and Albert Reynolds are indeed beginning to look ridiculous, as they shake their fists indignantly at the Heathrow bombers and declare: <quote> "You are making a grave miscalculation." </quote> </p><p> <#> Their impotence in the face of the IRA 's continuing campaign is matched only by the feeble response of the Ulster Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew who keeps telling us the peace process is <quote> "still on the rails" </quote>. </p><p> <#> His must be the peace that by-passes all understanding of those who live with the daily nightmare of terrorism and realise that the IRA has absolutely no intention of calling a permanent ceasefire, and a surrender of arms, ammunition and explosives. </p><p> <#> This view was confirmed by an IRA statement last night which ruled out an end of the terror unless the Government caves into its demands - to talk and to negotiate the ending of the British presence in Northern Ireland. </p><p> <#> A year has elapsed since SDLP leader John Hume brought Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams in from isolation to a centre stage position and in that time the only people whose cause has been advanced are the Provsionals. </p><p> <#> As the mortars rain down on Heathrow Airport and killers stalk the streets of our cities and towns of our Province, there is a political instability here not known since the IRA hunger strike of 1981. </p><p> <#> The Westminster Government has only one option it can take if democracy is to be upheld and real peace returned to this Province. <#> It must move decisively against the terrorists with proper security measures and must make it abundantly clear that the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom is inviolable. </p><p> <#> Last night 's IRA statement served a purpose in that in clarified to our Government the spurious "peace" agenda republicans are working to. </p><p> <#> John Major and his Government can no longer afford to be pawns in a process that merely facilitates the terrorists. </p></I><I><W2E-001$C><h> <#> <bold> Rape attack outrage </bold> </h><p> <#> The death of an 85-year-old West Belfast woman three days after she was brutally raped in her home is an awful indictment of the kind of people who are sadly at loose in our society. </p><p> <#> Mrs Mary Palmer took the terrible suffering and distress she endured to the grave and everything possible must be done to bring to justice the person or persons responsible for her death. </p><p> <#> The RUC must be given all the help by the decent people of West Belfast in their inquiries. </p></I><I><W2E-001$D><h> <#> <bold> MORNING VIEW </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Violence must not set the agenda </bold> </h><p> <#> SDLP leader John Hume 's credibility as a constitutional politician is wearing a bit thin these days as he assumes an increasing role as an apologist for the IRA and Sinn Fein. </p><p> <#> The Foyle MP 's latest intervention on behalf of the Provos throws the gauntlet down to the Government and shores up the republican argument that there will be no peace until dialogue is opened up with the terrorists. </p><p> <#> As the IRA mortars Heathrow Airport and murders innocent people on the streets of Northern Ireland, the SDLP and Sinn Fein leaders not surprisingly use a similar form of words to justify the Government parleying with the terrorists, instead of urging them to introduce measures to round them up and bring them to justice. </p><p> <#> Hume, maintaining the IRA was only firing blanks at Heathrow Airport, says the Government should launch new talks with Sinn Fein to exploit <quote> "the best opportunity in 20 years" </quote> for peace in Northern Ireland. <#> Adams says the search for peace remains the <quote> "greatest challenge facing everyone" </quote> . </p><p> <#> Having schemed for a year on the best way of edging Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom, the pair are now audaciously demanding that the IRA and Sinn Fein be allowed a central role in dialogue that will decide on a political solution here. </p><p> <#> The small matter of guns and explosives under the table while the Provos talk "peace" is of no consequence to the two men.<#> Neither is the view of the unionist majority community in the Province whose citizenship would be gravely threatened if such a treacherous assembly line was set up. </p><p> <#> Not surprisingly, support for this line is coming from Labour 's Kevin McNamara, who believes that IRA/Sinn Fein have not yet totally rejected the Downing Street Declaration. <#> But so far the Government has spurned the overtures, probably not out of conviction - more out of the realisation that such a move would trigger a dramatic deterioration in the climate in Northern Ireland leading eventually to a doomsday situation which would tragically engulf all the people of these islands. </p><p> <#> John Hume has significantly moved outside the parameters of the Downing Street Declaration with his demand for talks with the IRA before it calls a permanent cessation of violence and one can only assume that the long-term agenda he is now following for Northern Ireland is identical to the aspirations of those in the Provisional republican movement. <#> The right of the unionist majority to remain British is certainly not part of the scenario he is hatching nor is it in the thinking of those he is finding common cause with these days. </p><p> <#> Northern Ireland is being pushed dangerously to the precipice by minority politicians whose form of Irish nationalism leaves little room for accommodation with the greater number of people who believe that their interests are best served in maintaining the Union. </p><p> <#> Dictating a political agenda at gunpoint can have no place in a proper democracy and, were the IRA and Sinn Fein to succeed in bombing the Government to the discussion table, it would herald a disastrous watershed in Anglo-Irish affairs. </p><p> <#> The Government has got to urgently arrest the situation by making it crystal clear that those engaged in terrorist violence will have no place in any dialogue on the future administration of Northern Ireland, unless they totally renounce violence and surrender their arms, ammunition and explosives. </p><p> <#> It must also move on to involve in discussions those parties who believe a meaningful form of government can be created within the constitutional confines of Northern Ireland. </p></I><I><W2E-001$E><h> <#> <bold> Evil obscenities </bold> </h><p> <#> Former Presbyterian Moderator Dr John Dunlop has quite properly castigated the perverse ideology that revels in the terrorist <quote> "spectacular" </quote> and accepts the legitimacy of <quote> "production line" </quote> killings. </p><p> <#> Dr Dunlop, speaking at the funeral service for murdered RUC officer Jackie Haggan yesterday, said the people who engaged in such activities were not into <quote> "the politics of persuasion" </quote> but were involved in <quote> "naked coercion" </quote> . </p><p> <#> The Churchmen 's words struck a chord for many in our divided community who have been caught up in the evil of terrorism: <quote> "Violence can have a corrosive effect upon those engaged in it and upon those who suffer the consequences. <#> No matter how often these murders take place, we must try not to allow ourselves to accept them as normal, become insensitive to their effects or be destroyed by them". </quote> </p></I><I><W2E-001$F><h> <#> <bold> EDITORIAL </bold> </h><p> <#> Congratulations on your entry to Queen 's you belong to the few of us lucky enough to gain a place at university. <#> I doubt if it was easy, though. <#> When the A-level grades were released, school leavers throughout the country were thrust into the dog eat dog world of confusion and uncertainty as the struggle began - often in vain - to ensure positions in tertiary level education, especially in universities across the water. </p><p> <#> Except for school leavers who met the required grades, telephone lines were humming under the insistent pressure of concerned prospective students contacting the various academic institutions and organisations to have strangers informing them of their future. </p><p> <#> The signs of the big squeeze on university places - so apparent this year - have been on the increase over the last few years, rising from 15 <*> per cent sign </*> in 1987 to 28 <*> per cent sign </*> in 1992. <#> Obviously the government 's target figure of 33 <*> per cent sign </*> by the year 2000 is well on course, but are the universities ' facilities in line with government projections? <#> Furthermore, is the government well prepared to finance the demands they have issued for third level education? </p><p> <#> University resources - whether they are based on library facilities, tutorial sizes or adequate accommodation have been increasingly strained over the past five years. <#> Limitations have been swept aside as the push for more undergraduate places has not been countered with an increase in the government 's spending for education. <#> In fact, John Patten, Minister for Education, has had the gall to reduce by 33 <*> per cent sign </*> the fees for arts and social science courses. <#> Regardless of the fact that these faculties have the greatest percentage of undergraduates, the fees set by the government have been drastically cut. </p><p> <#> The fee per student originally stood at <*> pound sign </*> 1,850.00 - it is now <*> pound sign </*> 1,300. <#> To rub salt into the wounds of each university - and subsequently each prospective undergraduate - John Patten announced his plan AFTER many universities had begun offering course places on the presumption that undergraduate numbers would rise as in previous years. </p><p> <#> Universities, as a result, have been forced to freeze arts course levels to remain in line with last year 's figures whilst attempting to attract students to degrees where fees haven't been slashed. <#> It doesn't help matters much when the government claims that their objective is to attract more students to science and technology courses, away from "less useful" arts and social sciences courses. </p><p> <#> The consequences so far? <#> A lot of students with arts-orientated A-levels who have missed the requirements by a point or two, discovered with dismay that they have to reapply next year - when the competition will be even greater. </p><p> <#> Mr Patten assures us that expansion should be possible again, but not until 1996 - hardly comforting for this year 's unsuccessful school leavers as they watch those lucky enough to gain places pass by, gown-clad with degrees in tow. </p></I>
