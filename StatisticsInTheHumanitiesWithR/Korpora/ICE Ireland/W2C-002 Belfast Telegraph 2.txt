<W2C-002 Belfast Telegraph 2><I><W2C-002$A><h> <#> 'Gib' case: European blow to UK <#> David Watson </h><p> <#> A European ruling today pushed Britain closer to being placed in the dock over the killing by SAS soldiers in Gibraltar of three IRA terrorists. <#> The European Commission on Human Rights ruled that there was a case for the Government to answer. </p><p> <#> It decided that the relatives ' case against the Government was good enough to go before the European Court of Human Rights, and the commission will launch its own inquiries. </p><p> <#> Danny McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage were shot dead after the SAS was called into Gibraltar in 1988 to help police there round up a suspected IRA unit thought to be preparing an attack on British troops. </p><p> <#> The Government will have to defend itself at an international legal inquiry against allegations that the SAS operated a shoot-to-kill policy. </p><p> <#> Before the decision, Ministers hoped that the arguments over the killings would not be re-opened. </p><p> <#> Lawyers for the relatives have spent the last two years arguing that the Government breached Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the <quote> "right to life" </quote> . </p><h> <#> <quote> 'Worried' </quote> </h><p> <#> Niall Farrell, whose sister was killed in Gibraltar, said: <quote> "We are pleased that an independent international investigation is to take place. </p><p> <#> "Any investigation that will honestly look at the facts must find that Article 2 was violated. </p><p> <#> "I would think the British Government must be very worried at this moment, because they have an awful lot to hide." </quote> </p><p> <#> Solicitor Barra McGrory said today 's ruling was achieved against a background of Government immunity certificates being issued. </p><p> <#> <quote> "It will probably open up the whole issue again," </quote> he commented. <#> <quote> "This is probably the most spectacular of all those cases and should attract international attention." </quote> </p><#> <p> The decision means that the 25-member commission will now start its own inquiry into the Gibraltar case. <#> When it completes it, perhaps within a year, reports will be sent to the relatives and the Government. </p><#> <p> The Government argued before the commission last Friday that the killings were lawful - a view already expressed at a British inquest into the deaths. </p></I><I><W2C-002$B><h> <#> Love rival had ear bitten off <#> Rosie Cowan </h><p> <#> A West Belfast man bit off the ear of his wife's former lover in a <quote> "crime of passion" </quote> showdown, a court heard today. </p><p> <#> Desmond McAteer was given a two year suspended prison sentence at the city 's Crown Court when he admitted attacking his rival involved in the love triangle with his wife. </p><p> <#> McAteer (35), of Norglen Road, Turf Lodge, who is now reconciled with his wife, admitted causing grievous bodily harm to her <quote> "philandering" </quote> lover last October. </p><#> <p> And the court was told that the victim 's ear could have been saved - but he failed to take it with him to the hospital. </p><h> <#> Showdown </h><p> <#> The showdown between the two love rivals happened in the early hours of the morning, when the victim was woken by someone banging on his door. </p><p> <#> He opened the door to find a woman who asked him to speak to McAteer 's wife, Philomena, who was in his garden. <#> He refused, saying he wanted nothing more to do with her. </p><p> <#> McAteer appeared and attacked the man, knocking him down. <#> When he got to his feet again McAteer grabbed him and bit half his ear off. </p><p> <#> The lawyer told the court the injured party went to hospital where he was told his ear could have been sown back on if he had brought it with him, but it was not found until the next day. </p><h> <#> Assaults </h><p> <#> Defence counsel said the assault was <quote> "a crime of passion" </quote> , which had arisen out of McAteer 's ongoing marital difficulties and was <quote> "not assisted in any way by the philandering of the injured party" </quote> . </p><p> <#> He said McAteer had already served a six month prison sentence for two assaults on his wife, and in his view, this was part of the same situation. </p><p> <#> The lawyer said the father of four was now reconciled with his wife and searching for a job. </p><p> <#> Judge John Petrie said although the offence was very serious he felt it would be unjust to jail McAteer again as he had already served a sentence in connection with this ongoing dispute. </p></I><I><W2C-002$C><h> <#> Clinton slams Britain <#> Vincent Kearney (political correspondent) </h><p> <#> The Belfast Telegraph today obtained a copy of a letter from US President Bill Clinton to a former Congressman who arrives in Ireland tomorrow to campaign for a peace envoy to be sent to the province. </p><p> <#> In the letter, the President supports the envoy proposal, pledges to take a more active role in helping to end the violence and criticises the role of the British Government. </p><p> <#> It was sent to Democrat Bruce Morrison, who is head of a group of four Irish Americans who will meet political leaders in Dublin and Belfast during a three day visit this week. </p><h> <#> Colleague </h><p> <#> A former law school colleague of Mr. Clinton and a prominent member of the Irish-American lobby, Mr. Morrison will report directly to the President on his findings. </p><p> <#> He is a keen supporter of the envoy option, which the President backed during his election campaign and his recommendations will be viewed as highly influential. <p><p> <#> In the letter obtained by the Belfast Telegraph, Mr. Clinton sets out his policy towards Northern Ireland. </p><p> <#> <quote> "I believe the appointment of a US special envoy to Northern Ireland could be a catalyst in the effort to secure a lasting peace," </quote> Mr. Clinton wrote. </p><p> <#> <quote> "We believe that the British Government must do more to oppose the job discrimination that has created unemployment levels two and a half times higher for Catholic workers than Protestant workers. </p><p> <#> "There can be no lasting settlement in Northern Ireland until such discrimination is ended. </quote> </p><h> <#> Safeguards </h><p> <#> <quote> "We also believe that the British Government must establish more effective safeguards against the wanton use of lethal force and against further collusion between the security forces and Protestant paramilitary groups." </quote> </p><p> <#> During their visit the Irish-American group will meet political leaders in Dublin, including Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, Foreign Affairs Minister Dick Spring. </p><#> <p> In Belfast he will meet Northern Ireland Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew and representatives of all political parties, including Sinn Fein. </p><#> <p> The fact-finding visit comes in the aftermath of an upsurge in loyalist violence and comments by Albert Reynolds that the violence underlined the urgent need for inter-party talks to be resumed. </p></I><I><W2C-002$D><h><#> Father fears revenge <#> Press Association </h><p> <#> The father of Warrington bomb victim Tim Parry has cancelled a television campaign to persuade Americans to stop contributing to the IRA because of fear of reprisals. </p><p> <#> Colin Parry had planned to make and appeal on US television but was told by police that he and his family could be a risk if they succeeded in disrupting IRA fund-raising. </p><p> <#> The were warned that the IRA could target members of the family in revenge attacks. </p><p> <#> <quote> "I realised I had to change my mind when I found myself checking under my car each morning," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> <quote> "Obviously I must think of my family - they must come first." </quote> </p><p> <#> As reported in the Belfast Telegraph on Saturday, he and his wife Wendy travelled to America as part of a televised journey to try to find a reason for the tragic death of their 12-year-old son in the bomb six months ago, which also killed three-year-old Jonathan Ball. </p><#> <p> But in the States they were refused an interview with NORAID, the pro-IRA Irish Northern Aid Committee. </p><#> <p> Mr and Mrs Parry, whose journey to Boston, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is documented in BBC1 's Panorama broadcast tonight, also asked Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams for a televised interview. </p><h> <#> Captured </h><p> <#> The request was declined and the Parry's refused to meet privately because they were not prepared to have a <quote> "mumbled apology from the likes of Gerry Adams over the mistakes of Warrington". </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> "I wanted his (Gerry Adams 's) eyes to be captured. <#> I wanted the man 's face to be seen when we put the question to him that we would have put to him," </quote> he told a London news conference. </p><p> <#> The couple, who last week marked what would have been Tim 's 13th birthday with a special family trip to his grave, talked to Catholics and Protestants in Ireland about their view of the violence. </p><h> <#> Loathing </h><p> <#> They also met Irish President Mary Robinson and Gordon Wilson, whose daughter Marie was killed in the Enniskillen bombing in 1987 and who had a controversial encounter with the IRA in April. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We wanted to try and discover what could make individual men and women so filled with hate and loathing that they could become so inhuman as to put a bomb in a bin and kill two young children," </quote> he explained. </p></I><I><W2C-002$E ><W2C-002$F><h> <#> Burnt Out </h><p> <#> Emergency talks were being held at Stormont today after another night of violence in which two Roman Catholic families were burned out of their homes in Armagh. </p><p> <#> SDLP and Alliance delegations were meeting Security Minister Sir John Wheeler after loyalist paramilitaries targeted houses in the predominantly nationalist Legarhill Park estate, near Callanbridge, late last night. </p><p> <#> An elderly couple and a family with four young children were forced to leave their homes after eight petrol bombs were thrown at four houses. </p><p> <#> UVF and Red Hand Commando graffiti, sprayed on the walls of the houses in Armagh, warned that the attackers would return. </p><p> <#> Mother-of-four Anita O'Hagan, whose home was damaged, said her family was lucky to be alive. </p><p> <#> She, her husband Philip and children aged 11, 9, 7 and 5, spent the night at a friend 's home. </p><p> <#> <quote> "I keep thinking of how lucky my daughter was. <#> One of the bombs hit her bedroom window but did not go off. </p><p> <#> "It was just sheer panic. <#> We just raced upstairs to get the kids out. <#> The house was full of petrol fumes and I really did not know what was happening. </quote> </p><h> <#> Dread </h><p> <#> <quote> "I don't feel at all great about returning. <#> Now we have the added dread of knowing they will come back. <#> But where else can you go to live? <#> Would you feel any safer anywhere these days?" </quote> she said. </p><p> <#> Her next-door-neighbours, 82-year-old Noel McKeown, and his wife, Austin, also 82, were rescued from their burning home by <}> <-> neigh-bours </-> <+> neighbours. </+> </}> </p><p> <#> The couple, who had lived in the area for 22 years - and on whose wall the RHC daubed <quote> "RHC. <#> We will be back. <#> UVF" </quote> - were today staying with relatives and too upset to talk to reporters. </p><p> <#> Ethna Donnelly, whose home escaped damage when a firebomb exploded at the front door, said they had been targeted because of their religion. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The whole estate is living in fear. <#> I am so angry with them. <#> If they could only see what they did to that elderly couple," </quote> she said. </p><p> <#> Police have appealed for anyone who was in the Legarhill Park area between 11.15pm and 11.45pm yesterday to contact them on Armagh 523311. </p><p> <#> The attacks are believed to have been in retaliation for the IRA bomb attack in Armagh town centre on Thursday night which caused damage estimated at <*> pound sign </*> 2.5m. </p><p> <#> They came at the end of a week which saw the UFF and UVF kill four people in Belfast - three Roman Catholic civilians and a Protestant prison officer. </p><#> <p> Fears were mounting today that loyalist paramilitaries are intent on extending their campaign of violence to other parts of the province. </p><h> <#> Fear </h><p> <#> Alliance leader, Dr John Alderdice, said he had warned the Security minister that reintroducing internment would be <quote> "counter productive" </quote>. </p><p> <#> After an hour-long meeting, Dr Alderdice said: <quote> "He was certainly concerned to hear what we had to say. <#> There were a number of important issues to discuss." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Armagh attacks were the most sinister in a wave of arson incidents over the weekend. </p><p> <#> Police are treating as malicious a fire discovered at a temporary chapel at High Street, Holywood, at 1.15am today. <#> Scorch damage was caused to an outer wall. </p><h> <#> Poured </h><p> <#> Minor scorch damage was caused to a house at Grove Street, Lisburn, when a flammable liquid was poured through the letter box at 11.15pm. <#> Three people were in the house at the time. </p><p> <#> A fire badly damaged St Peter 's Presbyterian hall, Stewartstown Road, west Belfast, early yesterday morning. </p><p> <#> Lisburn Sinn Fein councillor Annie Armstrong said the people responsible had done <quote> "a grave <}> <-> diservice </-> <+> disservice </+> </}> to the nationalist community." </quote> </p><p> <#> And children are believed to have started a fire which destroyed Craigy Hill Presbyterian church in Larne on Saturday night. </p></I>
