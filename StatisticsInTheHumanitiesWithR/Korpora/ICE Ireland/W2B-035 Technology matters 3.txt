<W2B-035 Technology matters 3><I><W2B-035$A><h> <#> GREEN RESEARCH </h><h> <#> By <it> Jim Swindall </it> </h><p> <#> The recent sinking of the <it> Braer </it> off the Shetlands Islands has once again focused public attention on the impact of modern society, in particular industrial activity, upon our environment. <#> This is the most recent stage in a process of increased awareness over the past decade. <#> The growth in public concern has resulted in new environment legislation at national and European level that has had a profound effect upon industry and commerce. </p><p> <#> One has only to look at the supermarket shelves to see the vast range of products that claim to be environmentally friendly. <#> Even some family cars now claim to be recyclable as well as being energy-efficient. <#> These changes came about as a direct result of industry and commerce seeing marketing advantage in selling products that claim to be 'green'. </p><p> <#> Changes are also occurring in the manufacturing process where companies are taking steps to minimise their effluent and waste. </p><p> <#> The increase in environmental consciousness in industry has given a boost to fundamental environmental research which underpins the practical solutions required to reduce the environmental impact of industrial operations. <#> New effluent treatment systems are being developed, and there is an increasing emphasis on clean technology, ie changing the manufacturing process to eliminate a polluting by-product or to produce an innocuous waste which can be recycled. </p><h> <bold> <it> <#> Solutions </it> </bold> </h><p> <#> Much work needs to be carried out in the economics and social science areas to determine if proposed solutions do indeed lead to real environmental gain. <#> For example, it takes 200 times more water and far more energy to make a paper cup than a polystyrene cup. <#> Yet it is accepted wisdom that the paper cup is environmentally more sound. <#> Another example is the belief that gas is a better fuel than coal because it produces less carbon dioxide which acts as a greenhouse gas. <#> In reality the use of gas inevitably leads to leaks to the atmosphere and, as natural gas is a 20 times stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, the answer to the question 'Which is the best fuel?' is not nearly so clear cut. </p><p> <#> The QUESTOR Centre at Queen 's, which was founded in 1989, was the first environmental IUCRC outside the USA. <#> The International Fund for Ireland adopted the NSF role of providing the pump-priming funding for the first five years of operation. <#> This amounted to <*> pound sign </*> 745,000, and a similar sum has been obtained from the 16 industry members of the Centre. </p><p> <#> The members ' subscriptions and the IFI contribution are used to fund fundamental research projects which are industrially relevant. <#> The industry members help to select the projects submitted by University staff and also give valuable input at the six-monthly meetings of the Centre on practical aspects of the research. <#> The existence of the Centre has led to other funding being brought into the University - to date <*> pound sign </*> 470,000 in research grants and <*> pound sign </*> 660,000 in EC STRIDE funding. <#> It is confidently expected that more will follow. <#> Increased contacts between the University and the Centre members has also been a positive outcome of the establishment of the Centre. </p><h> <bold> <it> <#> Links </it> </bold> </h><p> <#> International links have been established, especially with the Hazardous Substance Management Research Centre in New Jersey, but also with a French centre set up in 1990 and embryo centres in Canada and Russia. <#> These links have proved most valuable, helping to avoid duplication of research effort and allowing new centres to learn from the experience of those established earlier. </p><p> <#> When the QUESTOR Centre central laboratory was formally opened by David Bellamy on 24 October 1980 he said that it was <quote>'a bright light at the end of a very dark tunnel'</quote>. <#> Perhaps this was a bit of Bellamy overstatement but it is significant that, as a result of the existence of the QUESTOR Centre, industrially relevant environmental research costing over <*> pound sign </*> 3.5m has been funded at Queen 's to date for the period 1989 - 1994. </p><p> <#> (Jim Swindall is Director of the QUESTOR Centre at Queen 's) </p></I><I><W2B-035$B><h> <#> <bold> GARDENING <bold> <it> diary </it> </h><h> <#> <bold> Turn on to compost </bold> </h><p> <#> Do you throw away soil fertility with the household rubbish in the weekly bin-lift or do you make garden compost. </p><p> <#> I don't mean do you deposit your grass and hedge clippings in a pile in some out-of-the-way corner. <#> No, I mean do you actually produce compost? </p><p> <#> Unless you are in the happy situation of having easy access to quantities of farm animal manure, there is no better and cheaper way of having a ready supply of soil-enriching material than turning garden and kitchen waste into compost. </p><p> <#> There are many ways of making a compost "bin", the idea being to contain and keep tidy the compost materials and to speed up decomposition by aeration and retention of moisture. </p><p> <#> One of the simplest methods of construction is to erect a square cage of netting wire, supported at the corners by stout posts driven into the ground. </p><p> <#> Thick perforated plastic sheets e.g. cut out of large bags, can also be used for the sides of the "bin", stretched between the corner uprights. <#> A more solid structure can be made of timber planks of suitable dimensions and built up and fitted together in a slatted fashion to allow spaces for ventilation e.g. boards 100cms (40ins) <*> multiplication sign </*> 12cms (5ins) x 2cms ( 3/4 ins). </p><p> <#> The use of bricks or breeze-blocks will make for an even more permanent structure if that is <}> <-> desireable. </-> <+> desirable </+> </}> <#> A height of about 11/4 metres (four feet) is convenient. </p><p> <#> There are also many proprietary compost bins available, some with sliding sides to allow the compost to be shovelled out, others with devices to allow for tumbling to mix the ingredients. </p><p> <#> The aim in compost making is to provide conditions which will enable decomposition to proceed as rapidly as possible. <#> Materials should be well mixed. </p><p> <#> Don't allow large quantities of one material, e.g. grass mowings or hedge clippings, to build up in one thick layer. <#> This can slow up the heating process, as such layers can either become dank pancakes or open sandwiches. <#> Put large quantities of such materials aside and add gradually to the heap, small amounts at a time. </p><p> <#> The process of good compost-making generates a high temperature in the early stages - a few inches down from the top it may even be uncomfortably warm to the touch. </p><p> <#> There is a host of materials which can be used - weeds, leaves, soft clippings, dead flowerheads, vegetable plot refuse, greenhouse refuse, potato vegetable and fruit peelings, tea-leaves, egg shells, shredded newspapers and spent potting compost. </p><p> <#> Materials to avoid include woody material, vegetation, e.g. grass, which has been sprayed with hormone weed killer, persistent perennial weeds such as scutch grass and convolvulus, animal weeds which are in seed and are prolific in seed-shedding, and diseased and pest-ridden vegetation. </p><p> <#> Additional nitrogen will speed-up the rotting-down process, encouraging the build-up of the micro-organisms, fungi and bacteria, which are associated with the breakdown of vegetable matter. </p><p> <#> Farm manure is a splendid activator, added in layers as the heap is build up. <#> Soil from a completed compost heap will do as a substitute. <#> Sulphate of ammonia is also excellent, added at the rate of 1/2 oz per square metre over the surface, every 15 to 25cms (six to ten inches) layer. <#> Or a proprietary compost activator may be used. </p><p> <#> The dressing of sulphate of ammonia may be alternated with a dressing of lime at 3 to 4oz to counteract the acidity of the fertilizer. <#> Don't add either of these materials directly onto farm manure, otherwise valuable nitrogen may be lost. </p><p> <#> It is best to keep the top of the heap covered with an old piece of carpet, sacking or thick polythene - water can be applied if the heap shows a <}> <-> tendancy </-> <+> tendency </+> </}> to dry out. </p><p> <#> When the heap has reached its desired height, top off with an inch or two of soil. </p><p> <#> Composting is a more rapid process in spring and summer. <#> Try to have three compost heaps at various stages. </p><p> <#> To turn all that miscellaneous material into a brown crumbly friable sweet-smelling soil in a matter of months - it 's magic! </p></I><I><W2B-035$C><h> <#> Test drive - the Nissan Sunny SR </h><h> <bold> <#> A car you 'll warm to ... </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> Nissan might not be the marque that springs to mind when it comes to performance hatchbacks, but look out for the nifty little Sunny SR. </bold> </p><p> <#> It 's one of that new breed of cars - the 'warm hatchback'. <#> Put simply, cars like this, the Citroen ZX Furio and others, are a way of giving customers 'hot hatch' style performance without the insurance penalties. </p><p> <#> It 's part of a huge array of Sunny models: hatches, saloons, estates, and even a costly GtiR version which is ready for rallying. </p><p> <#> The SR, which comes in three-door hatchback form, is a sort of under-stated Gti. <#> From the outside, it has a few of the Gti dressings like upgraded wheel trims, spoilers at the front and rear and so on. </p><p> <#> It costs <*> pound sign </*> 11,230 here, which places it well below most so-called fully fledged Gti cars. </p><p> <#> For that price, as I 've said, you get a sporty looking car but, unlike the Clio at least, it comes with a fair amount of space, both for passengers inside, where it 's particularly roomy, and in the boot. </p><p> <#> Equipment, as it tends to do on most Nissans, runs to a high standard. <#> The SR comes complete with power steering, electric windows, mirrors and sunroof, remote control boot release and 'plip' central locking with a built-in alarm system; one which takes a bit of getting used to, in fact. </p><p> <#> But what of the car 's performance capabilities? <#> In short, they 're very impressive. </p><p> <#> While the range-topping Gti Sunny uses a 2.0 litre power unit, the SR employs a 1.6 litre 16-valve engine. <#> Working through a crisp five-speed gearbox, that gives the hatchback a claimed top speed of 121 mph and a 0-60 mph rating of 11.2 seconds. </p><p> <#> In effect, the car uses its 102 bhp very well indeed. <#> You don't need to pump up the revs to get it to move swiftly and smoothly up through the gears, and it isn't a noisy performer by any stretch of the imagination. </p><p> <#> It 's a very good cruiser, too, moving along effortlessly at motorway limit speeds and above. </p><p> <#> What impresses more about this Nissan is its handling ability. </p><p> <#> Unlike some hatchbacks one could mention, this seems to be solidly built with a first-class chassis. <#> It has a reassuring wide stance on the road. </p><p> <#> All of that gives it a very encouraging sure-footedness once you try to throw it around a corner or two. </p><p> <#> The suspension is the same as that used in the Sunny Gti, which makes it firm without being too hard. <#> On the stopping front, there are no ABS brakes, but the ventilated discs at the front seemed capable enough in my spell with the Nissan. </p><p> <#> So what you get with this package is a roomy hatchback with plenty of power on tap, great fun to drive, and better than average handling abilities. </p></I><I><W2B-035$D><h> <bold> <#> News from Vauxhall </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> VAUXHALL has been giving more details of changes and additions to its range for the 1994 sales year. </bold> </p><p> <#> Last week, it was news of the Astra, Cavalier and Calibra. <#> Now it 's the turn of the new Corsa and Frontera. </p><p> <#> Four automatics have been launched to complete the Corsa hatchback range, which replaced the Nova earlier this year. </p><p> <#> In fact, automatic driving is available from as cheaply as <*> pound sign </*> 7,605 in 1.4i Merit form. <#> Prices then run upwards to <*> pound sign </*> 9,585 for the 1.4i GLS five-door model, with a couple of LS models in between. </p><p> <#> All of the Corsa autos, in fact, use the 1.4i single point fuel injection engine. </p><p> <#> It is coupled to one of GM 's four-speed automatic gearboxes which features a responsive kick-down, what Vauxhall likes to call a 'seamless' change-up and lock-up in third and fourth ratios. </p><p> <#> Top speed for all the Corsa automatics is 91 mph, while the 0-60 mph time won't break any records at 17 seconds. <#> But then small automatics aren't for the performance buff! </p><p> <#> Economy isn't much different from any similar Corsa at around 36 mpg on average, and there is a choice of three driving modes - economy, winter or sport. </p><p> <#> There are very limited changes this time around to the Frontera range. <#> The <*> pound sign </*> 13,445 Sport model gains standard electric windows and door mirrors. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile, there are signs that sales of the bigger Vauxhalls, the Carlton and Senator, are suffering. </p><p> <#> The company has cut the Senator range down to just one model, the 3.0 litre24v CD. </p><p> <#> The Carleton estates continue to be more popular than the saloons, so a new range-topping model has been introduced, the 3.0i 24v estate which costs a competitive <*> pound sign </*> 25,995. </p><p> <#> It 's something of a performance load carrier, with a top speed of 143 mph and 0-60 mph sprint time to 8.2 seconds. </p></I>
