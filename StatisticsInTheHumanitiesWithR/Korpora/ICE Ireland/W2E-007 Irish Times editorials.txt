<W2E-007 Irish Times editorials><I><W2E-007$A><h> <bold> <#> ROGUES OR FOOLS? </bold> </h><p> <#> In all justice it will be necessary to hear from the Attorney General, Mr Eoghan Fitzimons, and his predecessor, Mr Harry Whelehan, before forming a final or complete view of what Mr Albert Reynolds, Mr Bertie Ahern and Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn told the Dail yesterday afternoon. <#> The lawyers ' versions of events will unfold before the Committee of the House which is now set to investigate the entire circumstances surrounding the Smyth case and the appointment of Mr Whelehan as President of the High Court. </p><p> <#> Mr Fitzsimons, in particular, has had a series of challenges put down to him by the members of the Government he serves. <#> He finds himself in a most invidious position. </p><p> <#> But if his evidence to the Committee does not damn Mr Reynolds and certain of his Cabinet colleagues as rogues, it will undoubtedly confirm them as fools. <#> Indeed, the latter indictment is hardly necessary. <#> Never has the Dail been presented with such pathetic, stumbling, self-serving palaver. <#> Letters were left lying around the place. <#> Mr Reynolds received papers which he did not understand. <#> Mr Ahern had the job of passing them up to him - which he did, without comprehending them. <#> The best endeavours of Mr Fitzsimons to deliver some simple, clear conclusions to Mr Reynolds and his colleagues seem to have failed to penetrate. </p><p> <#> The coming days will tell a lot. <#> And there may be quite a lot to tell. <#> At the core of the extraordinary events of the past four weeks, there still remains the unanswered question of why the mechanisms in the Attorney General 's office moved so slowly on the Smyth case - given that they had moved so very much more swiftly and efficiently in other cases. <#> And there is the puzzling question of why Albert Reynolds went through storm and tempest, taking the highest risks (not least, as he himself has insisted, on the peace process), in order to further Mr Whelehan 's suit. <#> If it was no more than an exercise in showing Dick Spring who was boss, it amounted to a costly lesson. </p><p> <#> Last night all the indications were that Mr Spring and Labour are moving towards the establishment of a rainbow coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left. <#> Clearly, there is a strong body of opinion both within Leinster House and outside that an election is not desirable at this stage. <#> It would suit political and commercial life not to be disrupted, especially over Christmas, but the case for a purgative election is a strong one. </p><p> <#> Mr Spring 's and Labour 's judgement stand severely indicted in this sorry saga. <#> The facts which forced them to finally abandon their plans to re-enter government with Fianna Fail would have been made available to them had they asked. <#> It ought not to have had to come down to the painstaking and resourceful journalism of Ms Geraldine Kennedy in <it> The Irish Times </it> to set out the details on Monday. <#> Were it not for the publication of her report, it is almost certain that Fianna Fail and Labour would have formed a Government in the Dail yesterday. <#> There are many among the electorate who would welcome the opportunity at this stage to pass a verdict on all of those who have contributed to the present debacle. </p><p> <#> Last week Labour was unwilling to have a full Dail debate to clear the air on the issues which were being pressed by the Opposition - notably by Mr John Bruton. <#> It was only the last in a series of incidents in which the party seemed to take the position that it did not want to know the worst; the report of the Beef Tribunal, the tax amnesty, the passports affair, to take the best known examples. <#> Up to yesterday morning it appeared that Labour was unwilling to face what virtually every other observer of the political scene could read only too clearly; that Fianna Fail had not told the whole story. <#> Better late than never. </p></I><I><W2E-007$B><h> <bold> <#> European Defence </bold> </h><p> <#> The summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-Operation in Europe, which concluded yesterday in Budapest, certainly did not live up to its name. <#> Its useful achievements - on Ukrainian adherence to the nuclear weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, for example - were overshadowed by disagreements on NATO enlargement between Russia and the United States and, most gravely, over Bosnia, on which it proved impossible to reach a consensual statement. </p><p> <#> Running through these disagreements are differences between major powers on how European security frameworks should best be organised and co-operation assured, which have disturbing implications for the future of both. <#> Warnings by President Yeltsin about the danger of a <quote> "cold peace" </quote> replacing the Cold War if NATO were to enlarge to Russia 's borders must be seen in the context of last week 's failure by the Russian foreign minister, Mr Kozyrev, to sign a Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO ministers in Brussels. <#> Yesterday 's Russian veto of an agreed statement on Bosnia falls into the same mould. </p><p> <#> Revealed here is a growing feeling of insecurity among Russian leaders that flies in the face of established western policy. <#> The Partnership for Peace has, after all, been intended to serve as a mechanism which would reassure the Russian leadership that they were not to be excluded from new frameworks of European security. <#> If the evolution of the reform process there went well, it was assumed, NATO enlargement would become less and less necessary. <#> If, on the other hand, the Russian evolution went badly, the Partnership for Peace would have performed the useful function of bringing the great majority of states in central and eastern Europe under NATO 's security umbrella. </p><p> <#> Last week 's NATO decision to pursue enlargement, which was reiterated by President Clinton in Budapest, seems to imply that the more malign scenario on the evolution of events in Russia is now believed in Washington. <#> If not, there has certainly been a breakdown of communication and diplomacy in recent weeks. <#> The US last week shifted its ground on the Bosnian war towards a further European attempt to find a compromise that would allow the Contact Group 's settlement plan to be agreed. <#> It is difficult to see how this sits with a policy of rapid NATO enlargement, if this is what Washington indeed intends to pursue. </p><p> <#> These events signal a potentially far-reaching reorganisation of political and security relations between the US and Europe. <#> The best method of bringing co-operation and security back to inter-state relations in Europe would be to concentrate on pursuing economic, political and security enlargements through the European Union rather than NATO. <#> How this can best be done will be a crucial subject for debate at this weekend 's EU Council in Essen. </p></I><I><W2E-007$C><h> <bold> <#> PRESIDENT POINTS THE WAY </bold> </h><p> <#> The President, Mrs McAleese, appears to have hit her stride in her visit to Canada and the Boston area. <#> Her packed schedule over two weeks through urban and rural centres across Canada bespoke a remarkable commitment of energy and enthusiasm and local media have commented positively on her sense of warmth and openness. </p><p> <#> Her itinerary in Canada reveals a good deal about the style of this presidency. <#> Not only did Mrs McAleese choose to visit the big cities and the centres of political power. <#> She also wanted to see the small communities in the relatively remote areas of Newfoundland where Irish emigrants settled in the last century. </p><p> <#> In the course of her Boston visit the President delivered a challenging address to <it> The Irish Times / </it> Harvard University Colloquium at the college 's John F. Kennedy School of Government. <#> The import of that address, which is published today on page 10, will repay careful reading as the people of this island begin to make the painful adjustment to daily life free of politically inspired violence. </p><p> <#> In what she said at Harvard, she focused directly on the area where so many efforts at construction continue to founder. <#> How does society grapple with the fact that one person 's right of free speech or right to public assembly may be the source of another person 's fear, the President asked her audience. <#> How does society reconcile one community 's right to march or to assemble with another community 's right to live free of intimidation or provocation? <#> And in a post-conflict phase, such as that now being entered in Ireland, how does society go about healing past wounds left by threats, fear and intimidation? </p><p> <#> The President told her audience of the various regulatory devices which operate in Northern Ireland where one community 's customs, traditions or language may inflame or intimidate members of the other community. <#> She spoke of the work of the Parades Commission and the various legal measures which outlaw intimidatory or discriminatory practices and language in the workplace. <#> The difficulty with this approach, she acknowledged, is that virtually every adjudication is perceived at community level in win-lose terms. <#> Should it not be possible, she asked, to develop procedures and models which will yield a win-win result? </p><p> Acknowledging that she was asking more questions than she had answers at this time, the President nevertheless indicated some important starting points. <#> What is needed, she said, is not less freedom of expression but an enhancement of it and the provision of specific remedies, enabling victims of provocative speech and imagery to talk back, credibly and meaningfully. <#> She urged further commitment of resources for education and research in this area and she called for the creation of <quote> "accessible and dedicated public talkback forums or mediation mechanisms". </quote> </p><p> <#> South Africa has the model of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. <#> Ireland, North and South, has made a start in meeting the needs of victims of violence. <#> But what the President is pointing towards are mechanisms which will go beyond establishing culpability or compensation entitlements for past wrongs. <#> She is pointing to the need for institutions and structures which have a preventative role vis-a-vis the problems of incitement and provocation and which can sponsor dialogue not merely in the aftermath of division but in time to avert it. <#> What shape such institutions or structures might have is not yet clear. <#> Many agencies in the community - not least of all the media - could have a role to play. <#> Mrs McAleese has opened the debate and clearly laid down the markers. <#> If her lead is not taken up, it is certain that the objective of harmony between the two great traditions of this island will be, at very least, severely retarded. </p></I><I><W2E-007$D><h> <bold> <#> John Paul II 's Legacy </bold> </h><p> <#> Not since Leo XII died in 1903 has the Roman Catholic Church witnessed a longer pontificate. <#> Seldom has history witnessed a period of such profound change as in the 20 years since Karol Cardinal Wojtyla became Pope John Paul II. <#> The communist governments of eastern Europe are no longer, the cold war has ended and a world order has been established in which one super-power predominates. <#> Mikhail Gorbachev, himself credited by many for the ending of the old order, wrote upon the termination of his office as President of the USSR that the end of communism in the eastern bloc would have been impossible without the efforts of this Pope. <#> These efforts began in his native Poland and ended on the streets of Moscow in August 1991. <#> It is for these feats, along with his strong opposition to the new materialism which replaced the old order, that secular historians are likely to remember his papacy. </p><p> <#> Religious historians will have a more complicated legacy to evaluate. <#> In judging those 20 years they will record that in a long and controversial pontificate, John Paul II was a witness to major divisions inside his own church. <#> The first schism in over 100 years took place when the ultra-conservative Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre ordained four bishops without Vatican permission on June 30th, 1988. <#> Many liberal members of the Catholic laity, at odds with the Pope 's views on sexuality, his authoritarian approach to church government and his apparent inability or unwillingness to understand the concerns of women, distanced themselves from Rome in a less formal manner. <#> The gradual weakening of the independent power of national bishops ' conferences and the appointment, in the main, of bishops whose main attribute was their doctrinal orthodoxy have been causes of friction in clerical circles in many countries, most particularly in the United States. </p><p> <#> On a global basis John Paul II has presided over a devastating collapse in numbers of those going forward for the priesthood, especially in countries such as Ireland where the tradition of missionary service had been strong. <#> At the same time he has been uncompromising in his opposition to the ordination of women priests. <#> He has won international respect, however, for his personal commitment to piety and devoutness. <#> A punishing schedule of international travel, to 117 countries, has brought the papacy closer to ordinary people. <#> Of the world's major states only Russia, and this due to friction between the churches of Rome and Moscow rather than for political reasons, remains unvisited. </p><p> <#> His long-standing commitment to human rights, his work towards reconciliation with other religions, particularly Judaism, and his remarkable flow of encyclicals have made an extraordinary impact. <#> In this latter context his most recent encyclical, <it> Fides et Ratio, </it> has been perhaps his most ambitious. <#> In it he attempts to reconcile faith and reason while strongly attacking western philosophy as being so modest in its aspirations that it has created a culture of despair. </p></I>
