<ICE-IRE:S2A-043 Novels><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-043$A> <#> Uhm now let 's look at this novel as the as the last one that that we 've looked at <#> Uhm well he says that he 's trying to discover something about the twentieth century <,> but he sets it <,> in the <,> the early part of the nineteenth century <,> and he also sets it in Lyme in Dorset uhm which just happens to be where he lives <,> but <,> perhaps more importantly is the scene of one of the major uhm actions in Jane Austen 's Persuasion uhm so <,> where there there is an incident that takes place on the Cob at Lyme <#> So that John Fowles being the kind of very uhm <,> you know very self-conscious novelistic novelist uhm probably intends his readers to uhm <,> you know to remember what happens in Persuasion and to compare what happens in his novel with it <#> You know <#> Because this is very much the kind of novel which constantly in in a very post-modern way constantly comments on its own processes <,> doesn't it <#> I mean you 're reminded all the time that you 're reading a novel and he discusses the <,> you know the difficulties of <,> of dealing with characters and dealing with time and dealing with <,> with all of the other things <#> Now uhm some people argue that it works extremely well <#> Right <,> I don't know do you think it it works extremely well <#> Other people I have to say get annoyed with Fowles because he 's one of those <,> those novelists who puts in uhm quotations uhm usually in the original language and he doesn't translate them <,> you know <#> I kind of say <,> if the purpose of uh literature is communication to use a very old-fashioned idea <,> uhm then if <,> you know if if you don't translate things <,> are you really expecting a twentieth-century audience to be able to to do all this translation for you and also to have this whole weight of reference <#> Now Fowles was very much influenced by Flann O'Brien <,> oddly enough <,> but you recognise his uhm his uhm <,> his influence and I don't know if if if you remember in <,> or if you 've read At Swim-Two-Birds <#> Anyone read At Swim-Two-Birds <#> At one stage in At Swim-Two-Birds the the the narrator who 's a student uhm very much like Stephen Dedalus and if you remember Stephen Dedalus in Portrait of the Artist produces his views about art <,> his aesthetic <,> and this student produces his aesthetic as well about the novel that he 's writing <,> and he says the modern novel should be a self-evident sham <#> And it should be largely made up of quotations from other people 's works <,> and this will preclude illiterates and persons of inferior education from the knowledge and understanding of modern literature <#> Now in At Swim-Two-Birds <,> it 's comic <,> but there is the question about all of these kinds of novels these say <,> self-reflexive novels uhm where they are they are obviously self <,> they are self-evidently shams <,> because on the one hand you 're being told a story <,> you 're being drawn in to try to uhm understand these characters <,> you 're being presented with a theme <#> We said that the major theme was uhm his uh choosing freedom which is a typical Fowles theme <#> Uhm but at the same time you 're you 're you 're being told all the time this is only a story <,> that I 'm telling <,> and it 's got three different endings <#> Uhm now perhaps <,> do you want to say what the three different endings are or even something about what happens in <,> you know in in the novel<ICE-IRE:S2A-043$B> <#> Well one ending is where uhm <,> he 's daydreaming and he thinks that he 'll marry Ernestine and he give uhm Sarah up <,> and the other one is where he uh gets together with Sarah and they get married <,> and the other is where they part <&> laughter </&> basically<ICE-IRE:S2A-043$A> <#> Yeah <#> Well I mean <,> think about those those kinds of ending <#> I mean endings of novels <,> beginnings and endings are always very uhm very important in in in novels and this one I said has three possible endings <#> It also has of course uhm a whole panoply of footnotes <,> doesn't it <#> And and the footnotes come from uh various texts about Victorian sexuality <,> which showed that underneath the the you know the surface of conformity there was a vast underworld of uh prostitution <,> uhm venereal disease <,> and so on and so forth <#> Uhm so that you 're you 're being you 're being shocked out of your uhm your suspension of disbelief <#> You 're drawn into the into the story in all the conventional ways and yet the possibility of three different endings and these <,> these footnotes are meant to constantly remind you that this is this is a fiction <,> this is you know a literary construct with all of its own rules <,> so that you are not meant to suspend your disbelief <#> Uhm <,> nevertheless the endings uhm propose conclusions in uhm ways that are uhm more or less conventional because quite often people get very unhappy about the endings because <,> you know they want the story to end in a particular way <#> Now most people do not <.> wa </.> <#> I mean this is a story about uhm a very ordinary <,> in some ways <,> uhm young man <,> uhm who has some of the the doubts that were prevalent in the Victorian period <,> partly because he has travelled <,> and also because he 's interested in prehistory <#> There 's a whole series of novels now about the effect of <,> for example <,> the discovery of the age of the earth uhm during the Victorian period <#> Uhm I can think of two uhm that you might like to look at <#> One of them is Graham Swift 's uhm <,> I think it 's called Ever After <,> uh which starts up with somebody <,> basically digging out the skeleton of a dinosaur out of a chalk cliff <,> and what it serves to do is to completely disrupt their notion of society <,> time <,> permanence because <,> you know the <.> who </.> the <.> who </.> the whole thing <,> and it it it causes the the person who does it in that novel to leave his wife and children <#> Because suddenly in terms of the vast age of the earth <,> all of the smallness of their lives and their endeavours <,> particularly their commercial endeavours <,> seem very very petty <#> And the other uhm one is uhm by Peter Ackroyd <,> uhm and it 's called First Light <,> and again it deals with with the the notion of somebody discovers an ammonite <,> and in in fact it 's uh it 's set around people who are trying to excavate a Neolithic uh tumulus <#> It 's also set in Lyme <,> as it happens <,> so it 's quite a-propos of this <#> Uhm but but close beside uhm the tumulus is an <.> astro </.> astronomical observatory so that you have both <,> kind of going out to the stars but also digging down into the earth <,> and then people picking up ammonites which are you know fossil creatures off the seashore and somehow trying to look at ordinary human time as compared with star time uhm and and time way way back into <,> you know into Neolithic uhm things and you look at that that whole notion of time and change and in that the question of <,> where do human choices matter <#> You know <#> So that that Charles wants uhm a kind of freedom <,> but he has to realise that this has all sorts of social consequences <#> Now he 's been slightly disturbed by the the various things <,> you know the various discoveries that he 's made <,> but nevertheless he he you know he thinks he 's going to settle down and make a good marriage uhm in which he has to present himself as a good prospect and uhm to somebody who is fairly conventional <,> Ernestine is fairly conventional <,> but he also sees and is attracted to this Sarah figure who stands initially at the end of the Cob of Lyme uhm you know uh she 's an outcast and people are talking about her <#> You know she 's the French lieutenant 's woman or the French lieutenant 's whore as as they say <#> Uhm and she has told this story about herself that she has in fact offended against every convention of the time <#> Now as it happens our main surprise in the book is that she hasn't <,> uhm but that she is deliberately putting herself outside of society as a way of trying to get some sort of freedom as well <#> Uhm now the the the the three endings are that that that Charles will leave his infatuation for Sarah and marry Ernestine and settle down with the the conventional Victorian thing uhm or that <,> he will somehow <,> <.> se </.> you know having looked for Sarah for a couple of years <,> that <,> and having found her again <,> that he will <,> you know <,> set up with her in some way <,> or that they will both recognise that uhm their association with each other has allowed them to make the kind of choices that define themselves <,> in you know in an existential sense and so they have become separate beings rather than being simply the creatures of society <,> and that it is not therefore necessary for them in conventional terms <,> you know to marry <,> to live together <,> to to have to have children <#> Now I don't know in in terms of reading the book but I think most people want uhm Charles and Sarah <,> to get together <,> and this is the ending in <,> uhm <,> you know in sort of conventional romantic terms <#> So it it again this is this is a reader response novel <,> you know where the reader is meant to get implicated and and by showing which way they want the book to end uhm almost defining themselves <#> Now as I say some people like that <,> but other people dislike it because that kind of choice is burdensome <#> It 's also disappointing if you have the idea that the story tells you a story that somehow encapsulates the kind of reality <,> and one of the arguments about the novel one that that that I that I ask you to respond to is that uhm it is satisfying <,> not insofar as it reflects life which is as messy <,> troublesome <,> difficult uhm undefined as Charles experiences it <,> but precisely because it has uhm an ending uh because it has shape <,> because at certain stages in it there are crucial moments which are recognised as crucial <,> where you know where choices can be made and things can be <,> can be shaped so it that it is precisely the shape of the story uhm which is different to the life we lead <#> That that you know it 's precisely for that that people read the novels <#> Now I don't know what do you think about that<&> several students speak - discussion </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-043$A> <#> On the other hand uhm <,> you 're presented with a story and you 're presented with an ostensible theme <#> Now the notion of theme is that this novel is about something <#> So we have this dual thing <,> on the one hand it 's saying it can't be about anything <,> because it 's just a story and any one story is as good as any other story <#> And you just know that you 're telling a story and and <,> you know it might almost be in sort of in Beckettian terms <,> that one is as good as the other to pass the time <#> But certain things in it imply meaning <#> They do imply meaning <#> So that there 's a tension going on uhm because here are characters in a search for meaning <#> That that that kind of of tension exists <#> Uhm a lot of people like Fowles 's novels uhm <,> particularly because they seem to be about people at crucial moments of of choice <#> I said you know that you know that this is certainly uhm <,> even if the <,> the choices are <,> you know <,> even while they feel that that they have no choice because they 're actually conditioned that it is necessary for people to feel that they are able to to choose things and have control over their over their own lives uhm except usually in his novels he sets up a whole series of things that <#> You know somebody thinks they 've made a choice and then in fact find that it isn't <#> You know it 's not a real one and you have to kind of keep on uhm doing you know doing that uhm <#> At least if if you don't sort of respond to the story <,> you can respond to the condition of making choices <#> I mean do you think that you have choices over your own lives<&> several students speak - discussion </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-043$A> <#> What are what are the big the big choices that people make <#> I mean the big choice in this novel is is who he 's going to marry uhm <#> And the society in it is is presented as being far more repressive than uh than society today would be uhm <#> So that in some ways everything is laid out for him and there are sort of proper choices and there are improper choices uhm for everybody <#> And the consequences of making what society considers to be an improper choice is going to be social ostracism probably poverty and certainly having to as <,> you know Sarah has to listen to Mrs Mrs <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> uhm who is absolutely convinced that she is right about everything uhm and because she has money and because she 's able to employ somebody as a servant <,> feels that she is able to have total control over her every movement</I>
