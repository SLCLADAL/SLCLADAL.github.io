<[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-075$C> <#> Yeah <,> physical organic and quantum mechanics<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$A> <#> Well no actually <,> he gave us some notes on quantum mechanics but he hasn't gone

<[1> All I 'm </[1> saying is <,> we 're all lost <#> Yeah mechanics <{2> <[2> and <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-075$A> <#> <[1> You know I </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-075$A> <#> <[2> Oh right <,> it 's just uhm <,> </[2> </{2> well that 's okay <#> That 's fair enough but the subjects <&> clears throat </&> <#> I had exams on on Tuesday one is GLP and the other one was inorganic

okay<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$B> <#> Of last week<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$A> <#> Oh right <,> and I I didn't have time to study or anything<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$B> <#> No cos you were having people over and then you had the exams on Monday<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$A> <#> Yeah <#> And then I had the practice thing on <{> <[> Monday </[> as well and all that <#> So like I was panicking on Monday night <#> I had only read

laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-075$A> <#> Yeah I suppose <,> But you know and then I started GLP at about a quarter to ten which is for the laboratory practices <#> And it was the biggest load of waffle I have ever read in my whole entire life <#> The most uninterestingly stupid subject I 've come across<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$C> <#> Mm hmm<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$A> <#> It 's just so boring so utterly boring <#> I can't express it enough <#> It 's just horrible <{> <[> and I need </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-075$C> <#> <[> We </[> </{> have these little notebooks on lab <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> you know

saying <,> oh yeah this subject is so uninteresting <#> Started reading it at about quarter to ten <,> ten o'clock <#> Oh my God there 's no way I can do this <#> There are twelve lectures I 've to

<,> and I <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> horrible <,> but I can kind of consoled myself cos I got my organic results today and I got ninety<ICE-IRE:S1A-075$C> <#> <[> Oh my God </[>
