<ICE-IRE:S2A-003 Boxing - Rugby><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> The sound is just deafening here <#> What a place this is for the world title fight <#> And it may be an evening that Ray Close will never ever forget <#> He 's had a workman-like final round and that was a good punch to Eubank <#> The crowd responds <,> <#> Exhaustion <,> fills the bodies of both men<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$B> <#> Both fighters Mark are very tired <#> This is the man that 's doing the most in the twelfth round<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> Ray Close is finishing this fight well <#> He 's strong as a bull <#> Oh incredible courage from both men <,> let 's be fair <#> And has Close done enough <#> Even Don King 's on his feet <#> What a fight this has been <#> Three seconds to go <#> And that 's it <#> It 's all over <#> Both fighters feel they 've won it <#> It 's down to the judges <#> <{> <[> But here at ringside </[> <,> we think Close should get the decision<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> <[> I think Close is </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$B> <#> I believe that Ray Close tonight is the new superweight <,> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> super middleweight champion of the world<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> Well <,> if the atmosphere and the reaction of the crowd to the final bell is anything to go by <,> then we will have a new WBO super middleweight champion <#> Barry McGuigan gives it to Eubank by three points <#> Now I 've a lot of respect for Barry McGuigan as a fighter <#> I find that hard to believe<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$B> <#> I <,> firstly think that that is way way way way out <#> There 's no way <#> If anybody has won this <,> this fight by three points it 's the man with the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the middle of the ring up on somebody 's shoulders there <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Three judges here tonight <,> Clark Sammartino from America <,> Jean Glenn from the USA and Roy Francis from England <,> who interestingly scored the fight in Glasgow a draw <#> Now we must wait <#> What a moment this is <#> And what a fight Ray Close fought <,,> <#> Hugh Russell <,> Don King just in the round there <#> I thought Barry Hearn looked a little bit worried<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Yeah the <,> Eubanks corner don't look happy at all <#> I mean <,> I think Close has done enough to win it <#> Eight thousand people in this hall think Close has done enough to win it <#> But it doesn't really matter about us <#> It matters about the judges <,> depends on how they 've marked it <#> Eubanks has got a few dodgy decisions up to now so I mean I just hold my breath and just hope that he 's done enough<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> They say <,> they say nothing comes close <#> Look at this at the end <#> That is close <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Great finish <#> I mean both fighters deserve to be stood up and clapped <#> I mean they stood toe to toe and they gave everything they had <#> I think Close just done enough<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> I know it 's a matter of opinion but to be fair <,> Dave McAuley as well and Mark they weren't too impressed with Barry McGuigan 's score card <#> And to be fair <,> we weren't that impressed with it either<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> No I have Ray Close the winner by two rounds <#> He had a bad round which he could have scored maybe two points against him <#> But there was a lot of the rounds were hard to score <#> And I think there 's only going to be one winner tonight <#> I hope that he 's done enough anyway<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> We certainly hope so <#> We look at the crowd <#> One wonders what the reaction will be if the decision doesn't go for Ray Close<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> I mean there 'll be a lot of disappointed people in the hall <,> nobody more disappointed than Ray Close <#> I mean I think he thinks he 's done enough <,> his trainers think he 's done enough <,> I mean I think he 's done enough <#> But I mean <,> we 're getting back to the the judges again <#> It 's what they have writ on the paper that really counts<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Of course Eubank had a couple of great rounds midway through it <,> just you know in around about eight nine or so and he really <,> he showed his prowess <,> he showed why he 's the champion as well but Close responded very well<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Yeah Ray showed he had a lot of guts when he got hit and came back well<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Right <,> let 's hold our breath as we go towards the decision<&> announcement that Eubanks has won </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> They 're right to be disappointed <#> That was a bad decision<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Yeah <#> I mean just look at the three judges ' score cards <#> There 's none of them close to each other <#> I mean they 're sitting judging on the same fight and one judge gives it one way one gives it another way <#> I mean <,> there 's such a big margin <#> I don't know what they 're scoring on <#> You can't get away from it <#> Eubanks is the golden boy of the WBO <#> I mean he 's their kingpin <#> They get more publicity out of him than any other fighter they have <#> So to beat him they 're going to have to beat him well<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> On the face of it that 's a very serious thing to say about the WBO and about their judges <#> But clearly there was so many differences in the three judges whenever it came to the scoring<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Yeah I mean <,> it wasn't one point either way <#> I mean one judge had it three points <,> one had it four <#> I mean and then one scores it one way <#> What are they watching for <#> I mean sometimes they only look to see what they want <#> Ray Close 'll be really disappointed<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Can you imagine how Ray Close can feel second time out and to lose again <#> Well not lose but you know the first time the draw but to lose like this <#> I looked at Barry Hearn just before the decision <#> I thought Barry Hearn thought it was away<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Well I think Eubanks thought he was beat himself <#> He wasn't looking a happy man <#> It it 's not now <,> it 's later on it 'll sink in he hasn't done it and it 'll just <,> his heart 'll drop out of him<&> interview with Ray Close </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Hugh Russell <,> amazing scenes at the end there <#> Barry Hearn not interested <,> not too keen <,> worried about Barney Eastwood getting in a slanging match <#> You know I think <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Yeah they they got the judges ' score cards wrong they says but it 's still the same winner <#> I mean okay the margin isn't just as big but I mean I think anybody <,> I think everybody in the hall 's disappointed <#> I think everybody in the hall thought Ray Close had done enough tonight <#> Uh unfortunately the judges didn't<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> I also believe too when uh Chris Eubank said he didn't want to say anything controversial <,> as far as I 'm concerned there 's enough controversy<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> There 's always controversy everywhere Chris Eubanks goes <,> you know <,> so uh I don't know what he 's talking about <#> I mean the lad prepared as hard as he could <,> he 's getting a shot at the world title <#> He done everything that Eubanks done on the night <#> So what 's controversial about him and not about Eubanks<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Yes Ray Close said at the end <,> what do you have to do <,> and it 's a fair point<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Yeah I mean <,> I think he boxed equally as good as he did in Glasgow anyway <#> I 'd go I 'd go I 'd go as far as to say that he boxed better <#> Uh <,> I don't know <#> What is there left for him I mean <,> is he gonna is he gonna have to do anything else <#> Will he get another chance<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> What about Chris Eubank for the future<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> He <,> the show 'll just roll on <#> I mean the man wants to fight regular <#> I mean he 's going to fight and he 's going to handpick his opponents <#> He won't get anything as hard as he got tonight<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Ray Close <#> Bitter disappointment for him all the same <#> Will he have to now step away and move away from the ring or will he keep going<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$C> <#> Well <,> the right men 's behind him and if there 's another chance to get another title fight they 'll get him it <#> I think on tonight 's performance he deserves it<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$D> <#> Okay Hugh thanks very much <#> That 's it from a very uh disappointed crowd here in the King 's Hall <#> Lots of controversy but the bottom line is Chris Eubank is still the WBO champion <#> From all of us here in Belfast <,> it 's goodnight</I><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> Now Jonathan Bell <#> That 's a good pass out to O'Shea <#> And now can he release Geoghegan <#> Well that 's one for Simon Geoghegan to chase here <#> And he 's got a lot of pace <#> And he 's there <#> What a try for Ireland <#> Well the referee <,> has he given it or has he not <#> Well he hasn't <#> My goodness <#> Ireland feeling perhaps that they 're robbed there<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$E> <#> Jonathan Bell taking that ball and that was a clever pass missing out the man <#> Now O'Shea might have chosen to give it early but he decided to draw in the fullback and put the kick forward <#> That gave Simon Geoghegan an opportunity to sprint for the line <#> He certainly touched it down <#> I don't know what the referee 's decision was for<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> It 's hard to tell what that was for <#> Michael Bradley 's certainly confused <#> Referee doing his best to explain<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$E> <#> Michael Bradley realises <,> that is a crucial try for Ireland <#> With something like five minutes remaining that would have kept them in the match and still a chance of a victory<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> Well I wonder has he given <,> he wouldn't have given the uh <,> penalty for <,> he hasn't for a late tackle <#> Certainly advantage was the one to be played and that uh <,> that 's a confusing decision<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$E> <#> Inexplicable<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> But Ireland have gained from that <#> And over they go <#> Oh they 've got their try this time <#> Great play from Ireland <#> They 're obviously incensed by the referee 's decision and big Neil Francis gets the touchdown <#> Willie Anderson on his feet <#> Well if ever an Irish side was incensed by a refereeing decision it was then<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$E> <#> Yes they they took it round the side at that stage <#> Look at Michael Bradley <,> scrum half and he 's shouting onto the boys to drive and drive <#> He 's putting the effort in as well <#> The Irish forward 's coming forward onto that and at that stage Francis broke loose and touched down<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> And I 'll tell you what <,> I 've never seen Neil Francis uh play as well as he 's played in this tour <#> He 's been absolutely inspired <#> He 's sometimes a little bit uh mercurial and <.> in </.> and inconsistent but uh he 's supported well <,> he 's tackled well <#> He hasn't won too much ball in the line-out but he 's been all over the field <#> A a well-deserved try for Ireland <,> <#> Conor O'Shea <,> well <,> not a good conversion for Conor O'Shea and he grimaces<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$E> <#> Now that was uh an unfortunate uh miss there from Conor O'Shea <#> If he had of got that there 'd only be seven points separating the sides <#> As it is <,> Ireland will now need to score twice<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> Twenty-seven points to eighteen the score <#> And this has been a spirited comeback indeed from Ireland <,> after Australia <,> looked like they were going to hammer them into the uh Sydney turf for the first twenty minutes <,> Ireland running it again <#> That 's uh <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> the full-back <,> forward kick from him <#> So what can Ireland do in this uh last few minutes <#> They 've scored a couple of tries today both from uh forwards <,> Peter Clohessy in the first half and Neil Francis just a few moments ago <#> And no doubt the Irish coaching staff will be a lot more happy after this match <#> David Corkery knocking on there unfortunately <,> and a scrummage to Australia<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$E> <#> Uh that was unfortunate <,> uh Ireland trying that line-out for a second time <,> throwing long to Brian Robinson <#> On that occasion <,> Robinson not attempting to catch but putting down a well-directed tap to David Corkery <#> Uh I think in his uh enthusiasm to uh secure <,> he knocked on <#> It 's unfortunate <#> It now gives the Australians a put into the scrum <,> they 'll win that <,> it puts <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the driving seat<ICE-IRE:S2A-003$A> <#> Damian Smith is the man injured <#> Queensland 's top try scorer for the last two seasons <#> And he will play no further part in this match</I>
