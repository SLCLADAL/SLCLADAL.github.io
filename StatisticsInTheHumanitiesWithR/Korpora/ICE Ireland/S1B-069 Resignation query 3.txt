<ICE-IRE:S1B-069 Resignation query 3><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> But wasn't that the legal point <#> What the significance <,> whether the first case was significant <,> uh in the in the context of of considering the application of the relevant subsection in the second case <#> Wasn't that the <,> wasn't that the <.> leg </.> legal point at issue<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> No <#> The the the the the point at issue was whether or not the report had misled the Taoiseach and the government in fact by referring to one case only because as I stated earlier <,> the the <,> the argument <,> the the edifice of the argument that explained the seven-months delay commenced with the proposition that here was this brand new section that had never been considered before <,> and here was this extraordinary case with a long delay and because of the confluence of these events that this issue had to be addressed for the very first time and that a very long time effectively was needed for it <#> And that was the clear impression that in my view was intended to be given by the report <,> intended to be given by the report to the government and uh once the Duggan case turned up it was clear that that was <{> <[> flawed <,> </[> <#> And when of course later the four other cases turned up with uh opinions from Senior Counsel on the section it meant that the uh uh <,> well the the the explanation that was given was <,> very very seriously misleading indeed <#> And I won't put it <,> I won't use any stronger language than that<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> <[> But </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> But wasn't there a very very serious conflict uh <.> o </.> of opinion in your office as to the significance of the Duggan case and whether in fact that report was or was not misleading<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> Uh initially when I <,> this issue arose <,> it happened very quickly before I went up to the meeting and Mr uh Official A expressed some disagreement <,> later on that afternoon <,> as I said there was a very strong dispute between us in the office <,> Mr Official A was uh shouting at me in the course of that in my office and it was uh very unpleasant indeed <,> I can assure you <#> There was a great deal of pressure being uh put on me but insofar as I was concerned uh at that time Official A had an interest <#> Uh the wording used in the final report that the Attorney General produced on this issue was his wording <,> was his wording <,> and it was his information which Mr Whelehan used <{1> <[1> and uh </[1> uh insofar as I was concerned uh <,> we were approaching this issue from <.> dis </.> <,> different viewpoints <#> I should say also that in the court course of that dispute in which I tried to argue out my <,> tried to argue out my position with him <,> I pointed to the fact that uh the section had two requirements <,> lapse of time and prejudice and officially contradicted me uh very violently and and in a very blunt fashion <#> And uh when we conducted the search later of the other cases <,> I was uh very interested to find a memo from Official A to the Attorney General on the section pointing out expressly to the Attorney General who was to read that memo at the time <,> that the memo had two requirements <,> or that the section had two requirements which had to be met <#> So uh <,> uhm well need I say any more on that topic<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> <[1> Mm hm </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> But didn't <,> didn't uh Mr Whelehan subsequently write a letter in which he seemed <,> he he he seemed to to indicate agreement with Official A 's opinion in that matter<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> Uh Mr Whelehan <,> you 're talking about the letter that Mr Whelehan gave me <,> <#> Uhm <,> Mr Whelehan wrote that letter uh I think in fairness to him uh just think of the situation in which he found himself <#> On Monday night he had been <,> an emissary of the Government <#> The Attorney General had come out and given him this information <,> asked him to consider his position <,> asked him to in any event put back his uh <,> uh swearing in by a couple of days <#> He declined uh and he was coming in the next morning uh with me in the court to be sworn in <,> he dictated this letter and made this case <#> I respect it of course uh I mean I disagree with his views <#> He simply said <,> he told me he was giving me this letter to put it on the record but he certainly hadn't considered in detail the Duggan case and uh <,> well he he <,> he he he wrote this note uh and I don't accept <,> I do not accept that Mr Whelehan would have taken the line that Mr uh <,> that that the Official A would have taken<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$C> <#> Could I just interrupt for a second <#> And as I did earlier indicate <,> it is in order to refer to the officials by name<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> Ah very well <#> Thank-you Mr Chairman <#> Uh that uh Mr Russell uh would take and whilst he made a sort of a case for the record to me <#> I accepted it as that but I was not <,> I <.> d </.> <,> I disagreed with it uh fundamentally and uh <,> uh that basically is the position <#> Now uh that letter was to me <,> it was a personal letter to me <,> it wasn't a letter uh that was addressed to anybody else <#> The ministers <,> it wasn't a letter addressed to the ministers uh unless Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn read it uh between twelve o'clock the next day and I didn't see her reading that letter <,> she didn't know about its content <,> so it did not influence any of the events that occurred as I would understand it<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> Yes but it does tend to to to to bear out uh the the Mr Russell 's opinion <,> as opposed to your own opinion <#> I say that with respect <#> If it 's the particularly if you look at paragraph four of the letter which states and I quote <,> according to what I said in the memorandum to the Taoiseach last week <,> after consulting with the official was quite accurate <,> where I stated that the section concerned had never been applied <,> never been applied prior to this case <,> and that the full consequences of the amendment had to be considered for the first time <,> that this case seemed to be <,> uh seemed to be <,> that this case seemed to be the person dealing with it to come well within what is contemplated by section fifty BBB of the relevant Act<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> Well uh Mr Whelehan can deal with that matter himself <#> I 've expressed my views on the section <#> Mr Whelehan in his uh retirement uh letter statement uh stated that he uh <,> should have <,> uh his report should have referred to the Duggan case <,> and to my mind that is the best evidence uh on that issue <#> There were two cases <,> uh the report was created this very strong impression to the uninitiated reader that this was the first time this issue ever rose <#> And Mr Whelehan in his as I say his retirement statement has accepted fully that uh he uh should have referred to it <#> Mr Russell uh notwithstanding the histrionics of the first day accepted in the office subsequently to me that he was wrong uh in certainly advising the Minister for Justice that this was the first case in which the question had been considered and he has presented <,> he presented later on a letter of apology in which he apologised to the government <,> to the Taoiseach <,> and to Mr Whelehan for misleading him uh in relation in relation to past cases <#> So uh <,> so far as I 'm concerned on this issue Mr O'Dea uh the record speaks for itself <#> Uh I quite appreciate that <,> in fact I 'm very surprised that an attempt should now be made for the first time to question uh the advice that I gave to the Government on that day because at no time until now <,> until you started questioning me <,> has anyone questioned the accuracy or the validity of the advice that I gave to the government on that day <#> At no time <#> So I I do not understand why uh this issue is being raised at this stage<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> I I want to put it on clearly on record <#> I 'm not questioning the validity or the accuracy of the advice you gave <#> I 'm merely trying to emphasise that there was genuine legal disagreement at the time<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> Mr O'Dea the issue for the ministers was whether there was one case or whether there were two cases <#> The report that was furnished by the Attorney General to the previous Government was based upon <,> based the seven months ' delay or the explanation for it upon the proposition that there was only one case <#> It was the very first time <,> very first time in any case that this section arose to be considered <#> That was false as we now know <#> False <#> And in fact it was considered in five previous cases <#> It so happens that the consideration in the Duggan case was fairly perfunctory <,> that is <,> true <#> But it was a consideration that uh in the other cases that we discovered later it was uh considerably deeper<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> How did the uh meeting on Monday <,> the first meeting on Monday conclude<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> It <{1> <[1> <.> con </.> concluded </[1> <,> it concluded <,> it sort of broke up in I think some disorder as indeed all the meetings uh seemed to <#> I was <,> given the impression that I was basically no longer wanted <,> that other things were going to be discussed <,> people walking in and out <#> And I took my leave and <{2> <[2> but </[2> it was a pretty disorganised situation<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> <[1> What was the what was the was there any </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> <[2> But </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> Yes <#> I <.> acce </.> I fully accept that <#> Were you asked to go away and clarify the matter and come back with a more definitive report<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> I uh I was I was I was never asked to prepare a definitive report <#> Just like to make that absolutely clear <#> At no stage <#> And at no stage did I prepare a definitive report <#> Had I been <.> pre </.> requested to prepare a definitive report <,> of course I would have prepared one <#> No question or doubt about it <#> But uh there was one matter I certainly had to check and that was to see whether or not uh Mr Whelehan 's signature was on the uh page or the submission that <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> That was all you had to check<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> That was <,> that was all I had to check at that stage and there was an analysis on the Duggan case that was being prepared<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> Yeah <#> Did you make any contemporaneous note of the meeting<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> I did not make any <.> contempora </.> contemporaneous note of the meeting<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> Well I have <,> I have circulated a contemporaneous note made at the meeting by one of the participants Deputy Michael Woods <,> Minister for Social Welfare <#> And I 'll just read it into the record <#> Monday fourteenth one pm <#> Resume meeting with Taoiseach Fianna Fa/il ministers <,> new AG Eoghan Fitzsimons attends meeting and says he has found a previous case <,> Duggan <,> in brackets <,> in which nineteen eighty-seven Act was considered <#> Not sure of all details <,> eg if signed by H Whelehan <#> Only a preliminary notice <#> Taoiseach and M G Quinn ask him to do a full investigation and report back as soon as possible <#> What <,> what comment would you make on that<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$B> <#> Well I don't accept the accuracy of the final sentence Mr O'Dea <#> I do not accept it <#> And if I could explain further I 'll give you a reason why I don't accept it <#> On Monday night the fifth of December <,> this is the night when I was requested to prepare a uh statement at the request of Mr Spring on the happenings of the fourteenth and fifteenth of November <,> uh I prepared that statement during the course of the afternoon <#> I in fact phoned Mr Whelehan to check some <,> just to make sure that uhm <,> double check my recollections and did so and prepared a statement on uh accordingly <#> Uh the statement was uh not to be released by me uh until uh permission was given by Mr Reynolds because he was still the Taoiseach <#> Uh the statement was ultimately sent uh to Mr Reynolds in Budapest uh <,> uh that <,> evening I think it must have been about seven o'clock <,> uh incidentally a copy of it having been sent to a wrong fax number in Budapest uh to start with <,> <{> <[> <&> laughter </&> </[> <#> That number number was given to us by the Taoiseach 's department <#> We didn't make that mistake <#> But uh I was called uh later on that evening at about ten o'clock I was called to a meeting uh in the Taoiseach 's rooms or in that area <#> The Taoiseach was not there <#> Uh present were Mr Ahern <,> Doctor Woods <,> Mr Cann and Mr Dempsey came in later and<ICE-IRE:S1B-069$A> <#> <[> I 'm sure they were interested </[> </{></I>
