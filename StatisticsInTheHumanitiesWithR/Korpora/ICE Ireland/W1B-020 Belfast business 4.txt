<W1B-020 Belfast business 4><I><W1B-020$A><h> <#> 11 May 1994 </h><p> <#> I am writing to ask if you could help the work of this Association. <#> The Association funds medical research in Queen 's University Belfast into both the treatment and the prevention of chest, heart and stroke illnesses. <#> These illnesses amount to 10,000 deaths each year in Northern Ireland. <#> Many of these deaths are premature and could be prevented. </p><p> <#> The Association also funds work to help in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and those suffering from heart disease. <#> Support is also provided to alleviate the suffering caused by emphysema and asthma through the provision of home nebulisers to those with particularly acute bouts of chest illness. </p><p> <bold> <#> How can you help us tackle these problems which affect many people in Northern Ireland? </p><p> <#> An easy, flexible and tax-free way of giving is through the Give As You Earn Scheme where your donation is deducted from your salary each month (before tax is paid!). <#> In real terms you only donate three quarters of the amount you select e.g. a <*> pound sign </*>10.00 donation means only a <*> pound sign </*> 7.50 Monthly deduction. <#> Simply, the charity receives more than you give. <#> By using this scheme the taxman is obliged to make up the difference. </bold> </p><p> <#> I would ask you to consider giving a sum to charity through this scheme. <#> It is a policy of the Association to allocate all funds raised to benefit the wider community within Northern Ireland. </p><p> <bold> <#> Please complete the form enclosed and return it to the Salaries Department in the Bursar 's Office through the internal mail. <#> The Association will acknowledge individually all donations received. </bold> </p><p> <#> If you would like further information about the work of the Association, please contact Brendan Grew or Denis McLaughlin at Belfast (0232) 320184. </p><p> <#> May I take this opportunity to thank you for your interest and your support. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <#> ANDREW P DOUGAL <#> EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR </p></I><I><W1B-020$B><h> <#> 26 June 1992 </h><p> <#> Dear John <bold> <#> Re: INTERNATIONAL BALLAD 1992 CONFERENCE </bold> <#> Thank you for your letter dated 24 June 1992 and we are pleased to learn the above conference will take place in Duke 's Hotel, Belfast 29 June - 3 July 1992. </p><p> <#> The Board will be in a position to contribute <*> pound sign </*>100 towards the hospitality and internal transportation costs for the conference. </p><p> <#> We ask that you kindly confirm acceptance of this offer and the relevant conditions under which the offer is made by signing the attached copy of this letter and returning it to the undersigned before 3 July 1992. </p><p> <#> The organisers of this event in accepting the Board 's event grant are required to comply with the following conditions:- <#> 1.

level education. <#> He lives in Navan. </p><p> <#> The report recommends further in-depth study by a Traveller, supported by an academic team with appropriate experience and knowledge. </p><p> <#> ACT is keen that this preliminary investigation does not <quote> 'gather dust on a shelf' </quote>. <#> There seems to be merit in taking the study further preferably under the guidance and co-ordination of a university research unit. <#> The Institute of Irish Studies seems to me to be a good place to start. </p><p> <#> I would welcome a discussion with you or a member of your Department to explore the possibilities. <#> I enclose a copy of ACT 's latest report for information. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <bold> <#> P J HOLMES </bold> <#> Secretary to ACT <#> (Special Projects Branch, DOE (NI) </p></I><I><W1B-020$E><h> <#> Dr R B Deane <#> 26 Parkhill RoadBelfast </h><h> <#> 1 February 1993 </h><p> <#> Dear Dr Deane <#> For a number of years I have been advising clients and in particular those in the field of Education i.e., Principals, Lecturers and Teachers on relevant financial issues. <#> These issues have ranged from -
