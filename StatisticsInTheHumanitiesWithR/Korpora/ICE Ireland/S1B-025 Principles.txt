<ICE-IRE:S1B-025 Principles><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Frances can I ask you <,> has everyone got the right to their own opinion<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$B> <#> I believe everybody do has uh has the right to their own opinions but when it comes to actually having actions on those opinions and trying to enforce them on other people then you do get a lot of complications with the opinions<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Is that the distinction <#> Uh Edward you were nodding to that<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$C> <#> Oh well I would most firmly agree <#> Uh no-one has the right to uh force their opinions on another person especially as they 're often unproven <,> and have no substance in scientific fact or reality such as the health fascist groups<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$C> <#> Anti-smoking ASH et-cetera<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Now we will come to them in a moment <#> Packie can I ask you does anyone have the right to enforce their opinions on others<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$D> <#> I believe people are entitled to their own point of view certainly and their own opinion <#> But it 's when <.> the </.> they expect other people to have the same view as themselves and I think that 's a problem here in Northern Ireland <#> People expect people to believe what they believe <#> And if you don't then you 're seen as different<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Yeah <#> Isn't this one of the problems though that sometimes there 's a conflict because what you believe in may prevent someone else from believing in what they hold to be true <#> Andrew Puddephat <.> wh </.> where does where does Liberalism uh draw that distinction<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$E> <X> <#> Well the right to hold your own beliefs and own opinions is one of the most profound liberal democratic values that goes back several hundred years <#> And I think the the limit comes when you seek to impose those views on others and in the exercise of your own personal belief seek to restrict the rights of other people to hold their own opinions <#> And that 's the limit <#> The <.> li </.> the limits of my right to have my own opinion uh begins that the end of that is where it begins to impinge on someone else 's rights <#> And therefore that 's the test I think one has to apply </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Graham do you do you share what uh Andrew Puddephat 's just said<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$F> <#> I don't think we can make windows into men 's hearts as Queen Elizabeth the First said and that would be my opinion <#> We can't we can't make people think how they how we would want them to think<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Gerry what do you think <#> We can't make people think<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$G> <#> <{> <[> Well I </[> first of all it 's important to have conviction <#> Uh <quote> the best lacking all conviction and the worst full of passionate intensity </quote> was the observation made by Yeats <#> We <.> ma </.> we have to have personal beliefs <#> We have to have convictions <#> The point hinges on how we use those opinions to alter the lives of others <#> I like to think of conviction as being mainly private that they they would drive me but they wouldn't necessarily upset other people<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Yeah <#> Uh Edward uh Nesbit can I come to you <#> Uhm you mentioned earlier about health fascists<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$C> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Uh why do you have a problem with health fascists<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$C> <#> Well because health fascists are engaged in a crusade of persecution against those who exercise their absolutely legal right to smoke <#> They do this on a totally unscientific and absolutely unproven basis <#> <{1> <[1> And if by my </[1> <,> well I call them fascists because <{2> <[2> they </[2> think like fascists they act like fascists they talk like fascists so presumably they are fascists<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[1> Why do you call them fascists </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[2> Now if you </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Right well we 've got someone who beside you who 'd probably take issue with being called a fascist <#> I don't know what you how you 'd call yourself on this<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$H> <#> Well I certainly would refute the fact that I I am seen as a fascist <#> I work every day in an organisation The Ulster Cancer Foundation that works uh in both trying to put forward the facts of smoking <#> And I don't believe our listeners this evening have any <.> d </.> uh difficulty in accepting the fact that smoking in this community is dangerous<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> But what would you try and do with the knowledge you say that you have about smoking <#> Would you try and ban it in public places <#> Ban it on <{> <[> uh uh </[> the underground or or in trains<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$?> <#> <[> Ban it on the yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$H> <#> Yes I I believe that uh there are places that smoking should be banned <#> But I do believe that adults individual adults have a right to smoke if they <.> d </.> so decide <#> But I do think that there are some people in the community that need protected <#> If it was an opinion to smoke that was not dangerous but I 'm thinking at the moment of children and smoking <#> I think our children do have a right to be protected and to be taught and educated <{> <[> about smoking </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> Did did </[> </{> Edward do you do you need to be protected<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$C> <#> Sorry <#> <{> <[> No no I </[> am an adult and I am perfectly capable deciding what I shall do <#> And I don't see that anyone has the right to seek to prevent me from doing or to engage in such activities as to uh constructively deny me the right to attend the cinema constructively deny me the right to earn a living which is what these intolerant fanatics are about<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> Do you need to be protected </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Right <#> Uhm Myc Riggulsford <,> <.> w </.> <.> w </.> what 's your view on this<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$I> <X> <#> We should educate people about the things that are going to happen to them if they smoke and the chances of getting cancer <#> Now you can then decide on the basis of the <.> don </.> that information whether you want to take that risk or not <#> And that 's up to you </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Pastor McKee uh uh do you think this is a matter where we ought to compromise as a society<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$J> <#> I think that the answer really is not to to ban smoking uh altogether <#> The answer is to uhm cause the smokers to uh recognise that we have uh an opinion as well <#> They are entitled to smoke yes <#> But if that opinion is going to uh affect my lifestyle and damage me then they 're not entitled to that opinion<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Is this the dilemma then for us again if it <.> a </.> affects other people then it 's something that we ought to as a whole look for<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$C> <#> I would just like to quote something from uh <,> The <.> Oc </.> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the United States <#> Now this bear in mind is not a <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> group <#> This is a health fascist organisation who are trying to ban smoking virtually everywhere including the street <#> <quote> We recognise that there is no epidemiological data about workplace ETS <.> environmentud </.> but we don't feel it 's necessary to wait for them </quote> <#> And that is their so called proof<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Right now Wilson<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$K> <#> The issue here <.> th </.> and that seems to be <,> the issue that seems to be uhm coming to the fore here is precisely how far we as a society are willing to put ourselves in danger in order to defend the individual liberties of others <#> I personally feel that uh the individual liberty of another to smoke is worth whatever risk I may be putting myself in by sitting in a room with that person <#> <{> <[> I </[> think that individual liberties are more important than the <.> infint </.> infinitesimal risk from passive smoking<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$?> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$C> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Is that is that the ultimate dilemma then how far the freedom of the individual can be <.> recog </.> reconciled with the rights of that individual to harm himself or others <#> Do you do you accept that <{> <[> Paul </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$R> <X> <#> <[> Yeah that 's </[> </{> John Stuart Mill 's principle of liberty that we should be free to do what we like ourselves providing we don't infringe the liberties <,> <{1> <[1> or </[1> happiness or health of other people <#> That 's that 's fair <{2> <[2> you know </[2> </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2> <#> On health grounds you you smoke<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$R> <X> <#> I smoke yes <{> <[> yeah </[> </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> But </[> </{> do you eat meat for instance<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$R> <X> <#> I 'm keeping away from beef at the moment until they identify the little beasts that 's causing the mad cow disease yeah <#> But if it 's in the milk we we 've had it anyway <{> <[> I think </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> Okay yeah </[> </{> <#> Does everyone have a right though to eat meat <#> Some people might believe that it 's morally wrong to uh to kill animals and to eat them <#> Vivienne what what do you think<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$L> <X> <#> Uhm the animal uhm killing business is very cruel <#> It and it 's very often been muted that if people had to kill <,> their own food for the table uh there would be vastly more vegetarians in the world </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> What do you say though to those people in the animal rights movement who uhm set fire to the laboratories for instance or they attack farms and they uhm try and prevent people from from from uh actually processing meat<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$L> <X> <#> I can understand it 's just frustration </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> You can understand their frustration<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$L> <X> <#> Yeah I 'm I 'm not advocating it 's right or wrong <#> I can say I can understand people feeling so passionately like the gentleman here at the front <#> I mean whether we agree or disagree is neither here nor there but you passionately feel these things <#> I can understand their frustration </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> And <.> w </.> what is the <.> dil </.> dilemma <#> Can I ask you Brian<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$M> <X> <#> Well I think uh animals well probably most of them were there before we came on earth or evolved were there and they 've got equal rights to us yes </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> So how does that reflect itself on on how you view people who try and stop people from eating meat <#> Do you agree with it or disagree with it<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$M> <X> <#> Uh I <,> well I would go even further because I 'm a vegan of thirty years standing and I don't wear or use anything of animal origin <#> And what I 'm <.> s </.> trying to say rather than forcing people is say well <,> we have examples going back three generations of vegans who are living quite healthily <,> and they are frugivores which all of us are by nature <#> We do not need to eat meat to live healthily </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> You you 're a <.> m </.> meat-eater Myc <#> <.> W </.> what 's your <{> <[> view on this </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$I> <X> <#> <[> Yes yes </[> </{> <#> I I I think that 's uh uh a very good point of view <#> I would I would fight forever for the right for people not to have to eat meat if they don't want to eat meat <#> But on the other hand I don't think the vegans should be out there uhm causing damage to people who do <#> And I don't believe the vegans do for that very reason <#> They 're you know peaceful people who 've decided they 're not going to harm other people </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> But don't we have a dilemma here <#> If we believe that animals are equal to people in terms of their rights surely then we can't kill and eat them<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$N> <X> <#> Yes I think uh <.> re </.> very logical really because we love animals in so many uh areas with our pets but then all this murder is <.> cre </.> uh created in order to eat animals and I think uh every animal has its right to life <#> <.> I </.> its life is valuable to it in the way that ours is <#> And I don't think the human race has the right to take <{> <[> animal life </[> </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> So then we </[> </{> so then we ought to prevent those who seek to try and kill and process and eat meat<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$N> <X> <#> Uhm well I think just with the er example perhaps and and and spreading knowledge about uh alternative ways of living that we don't need to kill animals that uhm animal animals are are beautiful creatures <{> <[> and </[> deserve their life </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Now we have uh in the audience you you 're a farmer Graham uh Craig as I understand it <#> Uhm what 's your view to the to the uh uh uh well uh expression of of outrage that animals ought to be killed<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$O> <#> Uh I 'm a farmer <#> I produce both meat uh and uh milk and mutton <#> And I would just like to <.> m </.> make one point first <#> There have been attacks on butchers in the east and north Down regions and when I worked in the Farmers ' Union there were numerous cases <.> c </.> came to us of such attacks <#> As regards animals having rights animals do not have rights since they have don't have souls <#> Uh they can't think for themselves <#> However <,> we as farmers and human beings have responsibilities to raise animals in the most humane way possible<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Well why is there a distinction drawn for instance between battering a seal or a a cuddly animal and standing on a beetle <#> Why if this is a moral absolute is there any difference at all <#> Uhm Connor you 've got your your hand up again<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$P> <#> I think that there is a lack of recognition nowadays that <,> every animal no matter what size it is <,> is capable of feeling <,> every feeling and emotion that humans can <#> And uh he 's saying over there that animals have no rights because they don't have a soul <#> I don't know what on earth that 's meant to mean <#> But that 's it was that kind of argument that was used during the black slave trade and now look at the way we 're looking at it <#> And I think there is an advancement of what people think of uh animals and uh <,> the situation should improve<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Vivienne what what do you think<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$L> <X> <#> Well I think uh Graham is it uh lives in the Dark Ages <#> I think it 's time he realised there 's a great swell of public opinion <#> Animals do have rights <#> Animals the important issue as Connor said there they have feelings <#> They feel pain <#> They feel emotions <#> They feel love hate everything that we feel <#> And I think it 's time we actually moved out of the Dark Ages and went with the tide of conviction that people feel these days </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> But what do you think about uh Graham 's conviction <#> Is he not entitled to hold it<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$L> <X> <#> Of course he is but I think it 's slightly antiquated and I think it 's time he knows </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$Q> <#> Can I also say that nine times out of ten I would say animals are far more uh <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> You going to say nicer than people<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$Q> <#> Yeah educated far better than people <#> I mean they know more they 're more uhm they say they say a year-old calf for instance knows more than six-week-old baby<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-025$Q> <#> To me I think animals have more brains than humans <,> <{> <[> some of them </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-025$A> <#> <[> If they have </[> </{> if they have more brains and and they have a a personality uh Vivienne why why do you we as a society allow uhm experimentation on them</I>
