(Dr Ron Deane) <#> Please return to: Seamus Carlin, Videoconferencing Development Officer, Lanyon Building </p></I><I><W1B-016$C><p> <#> Dear Colleague, <#> At the most recent meeting of the Joint Consultative Committee, concern was expressed by the trade union side about the issue of workplace bullying <}> <-> , </-> <+> . </+> </}> <#> It was agreed that whilst bullying was not an Equal Opportunities issue to be dealt with under the provisions of the Equal opportunities complaints procedure, nonetheless it was an issue which needed to be addressed by the University. </p><p> <#> Accordingly I wish to advise you of the following: <#> 1. The university does not condone bullying at work be it by managers towards employees or employees towards fellow employees. <#> Those who engage in bullying behaviour will be subject to the University 's disciplinary code. <#> 2. It is a management responsibility to do everything reasonably practical to ensure bullying does not occur and that when it does, it is dealt with robustly to make sure there is no recurrence. </p><p> <#> Please ensure that this letter is drawn to the attention of your staff. <#> Yours sincerely <#> Paul Browne <#> For <#> Harry McConnell <#> Director of Human Resources </p></I><I><W1B-016$D><h> <#> September 17, 1999 </h><p> <#> Dear Fred <#> As you know, I 'm busy finding my feet as Writer in Residence here. <#> At the moment I 'm just trying to sort out my office and start setting up the classes. <#> To that end, I had a wee word with Colette in the office, and she suggested that you were the man to talk to. </p><p> <#> So, a couple of quick things. <#> Firstly, there 's an elderly computer and typewriter gathering dust in the office. <#> I know there 's a new PC on the way for me, so I was wondering what I should do with the old stuff. <#> Can you let me know? <#> I understand there 's some sort of storage facility somewhere in the University. </p><p> <#> Secondly, and more urgently, I 'd like to book a room. <#> I 'm going to be running two classes this semester - 'An Introduction to Creative Writing' and the ongoing 'Queen 's Writers ' Group'. <#> Both will take place on Wednesday afternoons. <#> We 'll be getting cracking from Wednesday, October 6. <#> 'Introduction' will start at 3 pm and run through to 4, and then the Writers ' Group will go from 4 to 6. <#> I 'll be expecting fairly large numbers, for the first few weeks at least. <#> I 'm advised - by current members of the Group - that the back room of House 3 is the most suitable. <#> So I 'd like to book that room from 3-6 each Wednesday from Oct. 6. <#> I hope that 's OK. </p><p> <#> Please give me a call to confirm details. <#> The extension number is 2915, and my home number 563461. <#> Let 's get together and have a coffee and a chat. <#> I do want to be proactive as Writer in Residence - a real member of the team - so do stay in touch and keep me informed about anything you think I should know about, or anywhere I can help out. </p><p> <#> So, all the best, Fred, and see you soon. <#> Ciaran </p></I><I><W1B-016$E><h> <#> Dr Luke McNab, <#> School of English, <#> The Queen 's University of Belfast, <#> Belfast, <#> BT7 1NN. </h><h> <#> 22 September 1999 </h><p> <#> Dear Luke, <#> Further to my letter of 12 September 1999, I can now confirm that I am unable to teach my two (weekly) Stage one Language groups. </p><p> <#> I indicated in my earlier letter that I was in the process of trying to secure teaching at the University of Ulster. <#> Owing to my status as a research student at UU, my hourly rate of pay from this teaching is <*> pound sign </*> 14. <#> My income from UU combined with my weekly income from Queen 's is less than the sum of money that I can receive from social security benefits. <#> For this reason, I must forego my semester one teaching in the school, in order that I may claim these benefits. </p><p> <#> I apologise for any inconvenience that this decision may cause. <#> I am also very grateful to Jane Hegarty and Mark Maxwell for their efforts in securing semester one teaching for me. </p><p> <#> Very best wishes, <#> Michelle Horgan </p></I><I><W1B-016$F><h> <#> 28 June 1994 </h><p> <#> Dear Dr Smith-O'Dwyer </p><h> <italic> <#> Presentation to Directors of Schools/Heads of Units on Thursday 16 and Friday 17 June 1994 </italic> </h><p> <#> Thank you for sending your nominee to the presentation on Thursday 16 June 1994. <#> I trust he/she found it worthwhile and has had an opportunity to appraise you of its contents. </p><p> <#> The focus of the presentation was to introduce the concept of delegating, within specified parameters, the authority to sign purchase orders at School/Unit level. <#> The success of this delegated authority rests on the nomination of staff (one or possibly two from each School/Unit) who would act as an extension of the Purchasing Office by personally signing orders and posting them directly to suppliers. <#> As the 'nominated buyer' will be acting on behalf of the Purchasing Office, it is necessary that there is an agreement between the Director of School/Head of Unit and this office as to the identity of your nominee(s). <#> I should be grateful, therefore, if you could forward this information to the Purchasing Office as soon as possible. </p><p> <#> It is hoped that your proposals will be acceptable. <#> However, in the event that the Purchasing Office is not in agreement, I will contact you personally. <#> For your convenience, I have attached a reply form for you to complete. </p><p> <#> Should you have any queries regarding the above, or indeed any purchasing-related matter, please do not hesitate to contact me. <#> I have enclosed for your information copies of handouts issued during the presentations. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <#> Lisa B Earls (Mrs) <#> Assistant Secretary (Purchasing) <#> enc <#> cc Provost </p></I><I><W1B-016$G><h> <#> 5.8.94 </h><h> <#> Dr R.B.
