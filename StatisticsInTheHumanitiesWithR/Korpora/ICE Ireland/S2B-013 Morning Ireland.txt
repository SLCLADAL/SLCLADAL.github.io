felt very isolated <#> She said her gesture was very important because she was viewed by this community as leaning towards the Unionist population <#> She said she was not in the business of endorsing

seven minutes past eight <#> And here with what it says in the papers is Kevin O'Connor<ICE-IRE:S2B-013$G> <#> It 's a morning of contrast and contradictions in the news and the bad prognosis in the health dispute <,> becomes the common lead in the Independent Times and Cork Examiner <,> with various prescriptions on offer from the editorial writers <#> All the papers agree that as the Independent puts it the strike is set to cripple hospital services <#> Some even predict terminal cases <#> Inside in the Independent health correspondent Eilis O'Regan says it 's literally a matter of life and death <#> The hospital chaos illustrates just how fragile is the industry that deals with life and death and what a powerful weapon the union has on its side <#> She reports that the emergency cover being provided by some striking workers is wholly inadequate <#> The most vulnerable are suffering most writes O'Regan <#> Alongside that The Independent has a long editorial setting out the parameters of the dispute and concluding <,> that the consequences are likely to be out of all proportion to the causes <#> The public will feel that government and unions have clashed without sufficient cause <,> says The Independent <#> Causes and consequences come in for comment and reportage in other areas this morning particularly <,> on the Northern Ireland and the Labour front with jobs the predominant concern among most papers <#> <quote> good and bad news on jobs front </quote> <,> is how The Examiner heads its editorial comments saying that the good news is that Cork and Galway are to get a boost in employment <,> but that 's offset by other depressing job losses referring to the redundancies in De Beers at Shannon and Donnelly Mirrors in Kildare <#> The Times news headings tell a similar story <#> <quote> US firms to create hundreds of jobs at Digital plant </quote> says one heading <,> and beside that another heading says <quote> firms announce a hundred and sixty-five job losses </quote> <#> Underneath that the paper reports the murder by the IRA of the Catholic haulier in Lisburn in front of his children which both Press and Independent describe as being hysterical in the wake of the killing <#> By contrast The Press has a moving picture and account of the death of Caoilfhionn McDonald who lived for one year and nine months with a severe stomach complaint <,> and finally died in a Belfast hospital after the failure <,> to find a transplant donor <#> On other pages this morning there 's much on final fever that 's the football clash as the papers like to call it between teams from opposite ends of the island Derry and Cork <#> There 's much on autumn fashions from Brown Thomas which writer Vivienne Clarke in The Press says requires <,> not only a sylphlike figure but a bank balance of Rubenesque proportions <#> Surely a collision of opposing forces there <#> And finally this morning there 's a judicious piece of court reporting in The Independent <#> It concerns a case in which British rider Harvey Smith was involved in in a dispute over alleged damage to his land by greenkeepers from a nearby golf course <#> One <.> greek </.> <.> ge </.> greenkeeper said that Harvey Smith advanced towards him <,> as he stepped forward he hit me on the left-hand side of my face turning me round <#> He hit me on my cheek with his fist <#> It was not necessarily hard but enough for me to be facing in the opposite direction<ICE-IRE:S2B-013$A> <#> Kevin O'Connor <#> It 's ten past eight <#> It now seems certain the dental assistants ' dispute is going to escalate further <#> All-night talks at a meeting of the Employer Labour Conference <,> failed to come up with a formula to resolve the dispute <#> Now some four thousand members of the IMPACT Union in clerical administrative and paramedical grades in the eight regional Health Boards look set to join three thousand of their colleagues on the picket lines this morning <#> The union seeking the payment of a ten percent pay award for three hundred and fifty dental assistants <#> That award was made almost two years ago <#> The payment has been deferred because the government fears it 'd have a knock-on effect for other public <.> serv </.> sector pay claims <#> Where does the matter go from here <#> Sean Whelan put that question to IMPACT joint General Secretary Philip Flynn as he left the Department of Employment just before six o'clock this morning</I>
