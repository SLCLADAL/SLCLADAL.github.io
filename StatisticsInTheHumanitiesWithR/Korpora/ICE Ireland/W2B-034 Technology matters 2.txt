<W2B-034 Technology matters 2><I><W2B-034$A><h> <#> Internetworking the future </h><p> <#> Last year 's big computer story was undoubtedly the launch of Microsoft 's Windows 95 - with Microsoft spending around <*> dollar sign </*> 1 billion on the biggest launch in the history of the computer industry including buying a Rolling Stones song and entire daily issue of the Times. </p><p> <#> Big as the publicity was for Windows 95, however, the computer phenomena that continued to dominate the computer columns in the national press and specialist magazines was the Internet. </p><p> <#> Everyone, it seems, is finding a use for this incredible worldwide network of thousand of computers which gives access to the most bewildering array of information on, seemingly, every subject human beings have ever imagined. <#> But aside from all the trivia (and the more sinister political and pornographic content) the big development is that the Internet is fast becoming a tool for doing business. <#> Major corporations, small enterprises, local and central government bodies, and community groups are all urgently asking how they can use the Internet, and getting the World Wide Web sites up and running. </p><p> <#> A recent UK survey of more than 2000 organisations shows that more than 36t per cent are using the Internet in some way and another 15 per cent are actively evaluating it. <#> Estimates vary in the amount of business that is being done via the Internet at present, but analysts agree that it will be a major vehicle for trading by the turn of the millennium, with some estimates putting the figure at more than <*> dollar sign </*> 200 bn a year by then. </p><p> <#> For now, many companies are just waking up to the possibilities and are putting their toe in the water. <#> This usually consists of getting a World Wide Web site up and giving an "address" where Internet users the world over can visit electronically, to browse the material presented. <#> Such a site is a means of promotions, to let the world know about our products and services. </p><p> <#> The other main use that companies get from using the Internet is electronic mail. <#> For the price of a brief local telephone call, users can send lengthy messages all round the world. <#> The benefits are clear, even aside from the cost of benefits (E-mail is cheaper than both telephone calls and faxes - no more "telephone tag", where you and your business colleague keep missing each other, and a stored record of all your communication for future reference. </p><p> <#> These would be reason enough for most businesses to consider getting on-line. <#> But many businesses are keen to exploit the potential for world-wide trade via the information superhighway. <#> The World Wide Web is full of organisations selling just about every conceivable type of goods - when you visit such a site, you can browse through catalogues of goods, complete with descriptions, pictures and pricing information. <#> Ordering can be done electronically, although the most obvious means of payment - by credit card - currently still presents problems. <#> Sending your credit card details through the Internet is still definitely not to be recommended - software hackers have the capability of intercepting details and using them fraudulently. </p><p> <#> Large organisations with multiple sites with requirements for electronic mail and electronic document delivery can get obvious benefits from the information superhighway. <#> But even small firms can begin to realise benefits. <#> A small travel firm called Mountain Travel-Sobek, which specialises in exotic adventure travel has recently begun to use the Internet. <#> People browsing the World Wide Web who come across their site regularly sign up for holidays on the spot. <#> In addition, they believe that they can save thousands on the printing of their elaborate and expensive annual colour catalogue by publishing an electronic version. </p><p> <#> Many top international management consultants believe the Internet will be indispensable for doing business by the end of the decade. <#> As business becomes more niche market-orientated and more global and as more and more businesses and people get on-line, it will make having access to the information superhighway and a World Wide Web presence a necessity for business survival - rather like telephones and fax machines have become. <#> Now 's the time to tip your toe in the water and find out how your business can benefit. </p></I><I><W2B-034$B><h> <#> Making the breakthrough </h><p> <#> The technological changes taking place in the telecom industry are so rapid and imaginative that the business community can very often feel confused. </p><p> <#> Yet for Northern Ireland companies located on the periphery of the UK which is in turn at the outward limit of the European Union, access to the best communications systems is essential for competitiveness. </p><p> <#> In a global market the sharpest competitive edge comes from information and the ability to transfer information between customers and suppliers. <#> We are beginning to see the convergence of IT, and telecommunications is opening up huge opportunities both for the operators and customers that they serve. </p><p> <#> But what are these opportunities? <#> For a start corporations are increasingly on the look-out for innovative ways of doing business. <#> Telecommunications has helped to fulfil this need by delivering real business gains at a strategic level. </p><p> <#> This sounds obvious to us now, but only a few years ago the saving in telecoms were regarded as those which a company might lop off its annual telephone bill. <#> Now we can communicate face to face via videoconferencing, or instantly exchange all types of information with suppliers, customers and colleagues through a single electronic mail system. <#> We have voice networks that offer incredible flexibility, and a local cost call can open up the Internet. <#> To further stimulate change operators must understand the changing needs of their customers. <#> At Mercury, the new structure that we are building is allowing us to focus more clearly in these markets. <#> Only through genuine appreciation of the business pressures in other markets will we be able to offer the kind of bespoke solutions that the customers need. </p><p> <#> Marrying the worlds of commerce and telecommunications is the name of our game. <#> We are moving towards true integration which allows us to break free from the traditional boundaries which have constrained commerce for so long. </p></I><I><W2B-034$C><h> <#> From Maghera to worldwide </h><p> <#> A company that was established to supply a small customer in its home town in Maghera, County Londonderry has grown to become a major player in the United Kingdom, European and Middle Eastern markets. </p><p> <#> Almost 26 years on Cunningham Covers now manufacture and supplies a wide range of products that have in some way or other stemmed from its core business of manufacturing trailer covers for the transport industry. </p><p> <#> In addition to tension curtains and tarpaulins, the products range now on offer includes marquees, load securing systems, bouncy castles, pool liners, animal lifting harnesses and horse water jumps. </p><p> <#> The owner of the company, and force behind its growth is Gordon Cunningham. </p><p> <#> With all the characteristics of a successful entrepreneur, he is an ideas man, who finds it hard to take no for an answer when it comes to finding a solution to a problem, and will rarely say <quote> 'sorry, we can't do that' </quote> to a customer. </p><p> <#> So dedicated is he to exporting that he keeps a clock in his office set at Middle Eastern time, in case he should need to talk to a customer. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We pride ourselves on being able to provide solutions that no one else can offer. </p><p> <#> "That is perhaps why we are now able to offer such a range of products," </quote> explained Gordon. </p><p> <#> This expertise has been called upon a number of occasions, most recently to help with the fit out on the luxury cruise liner the Sea Princess. </p><p> <#> But despite such a wide and varied product range Gordon points out that the company has never produced anything that it could not sell. </p><p> <quote> <#> "This is where our investment in the latest design technology has paid off for us. <#> He is careful <}> <+> to </+> </}> stress that the large product range on offer at <}> <-> from </-> </{> the company has not been to the detriment of high quality. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The very nature of our business demands that our products and solutions must be of the highest quality or lives could be put at risk. </p><p> <#> "Therefore quality and high standards are at the forefront of every product we produce." </quote> </p><p> <#> The company is also very particular that it will deliver its product when it said it would. </p></I><I><W2B-034$C><h> <#> Showing you can't judge by size </h><p> <#> An Antrim company is proof if proof is needed that size isn't everything when it comes to exporting, and small companies can sell their products successfully across the world. </p><p> <#> Fast Engineering was established in 1981 by Seamus Connolly, a chartered civil engineer, to provide a more workable solution to the problem of water storage on engineering sites. </p><p> <#> The company produces collapsible yet portable liquid storage tanks used by relief agencies of emergency water provision and by the oil industry and fire service for environmental protection. </p><p> <#> It has successfully identified and exploited a nice-market on a world-wide basis. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It is important for a small company to hit the ground running, and we were very fortunate that we got endorsement from Oxfam for our tanks at an early stage," </quote> said Seamus. </p><p> <#> With the support of LEDU, the company began to produce a range of portable liquid storage tanks which because of their simple design and ease of carriage were soon in big demand from the major relief agencies working in disaster areas around the world. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Our Fasttank provides a flexible solution to the permanent or temporary containment of liquids. <#> It is strong yet lightweight and when folded is compact enough to be easily transported to event the most remote locations worldwide," </quote> explained Seamus. </p><p> <#> The company 's next big break came when it was approached by BP to provide them with a tank. </p><p> <quote> <#> "They were so delighted with the result that they are now one of our major customers." </quote> </p></I><I><W2B-034$C><h> <#> Burning at both ends </h><p> <#> Few companies can say that they are market leaders at opposite ends of the spectrum within a highly competitive international marketplace. </p><p> <#> Bangor-based Denroy Plastics is a company that has successfully achieved this accolade through the manufacture of a wide range of plastic products for both industrial and domestic markets. </p><p> <#> A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Denroy Group, it was established in 1972 following the amalgamation of Ulster Plastics and Martin Rainey. </p><p> <#> Employing 250 staff at two sites in Bangor, the company is divided into two main divisions:<p> <#> Denroy Consumer Products which <}> <-> manufacturers </-> <+> manufactures </+> </}> and markets the world famous Denman range of hair-care products. </p><p> <#> Denroy Plastics, Industrial Moulding, which offers a wide range of comprehensive injection and compression moulding services to industry. </p><p> <#> The past 12 months have been exceptional for the company. <#> Sales of the Denman range of hair care products have continued to increase, but the highlight of the year has been the performance of the industrial division. </p><p> <#> Sales increased by 54 per cent on 1994 figures contributing half of total group sales. </p><p> <#> Ron Wilson, the newly appointed general manager of the division says that both divisions are now neck and neck when it comes to contributing to total group turnover. </p><p> <quote> <#> "This is a massive boost for the industrial side which has been growing year on year to catch up with the success of the consumer division." </quote> </p><p> <#> Over the last two years the industrial moulding division has undergone significant investment which has included a <*> pound sign </*> 1 million re-equipment programme which meant the purchase of state-of-the-art design and manufacturing facilities and a fully integrated computer system. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Our success has enabled us to stand on <}> <+> our </+> </}> own <}> <-> to </-> <+> two </+> </}> feet and go for further growth," </quote> explained Ron. </p><p> <#> Ron said that because of the success of the consumer division, the industrial end was probably not given as much management attention in terms of growth plans until recently. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Our performance over the last number of years has shown that we are a world leader in our own right and we now have a dedicated management team to take us into the future." </quote> </p><p> <#> Growth will be in expanding outside Northern Ireland into Eire and the rest of the United Kingdom and worldwide markets. </p></I>
