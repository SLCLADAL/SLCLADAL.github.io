<W2C-015 Kilkenny People><I><W2C-015$A><h> <bold> <ul> <#> HOGAN IS HOPEFUL </bold> </ul> </h><it> <#> by Sean Keane </it><p> <bold> <#> KILKENNY will not lose out in a new coalition. <#> The <it> 'People </it> has learnt that Deputy Phil Hogan of Fine Gael will be among the Ministers of State to be appointed in a new administration. </bold> </p><p> <#> There is no question of a derailment of the new three party coalition between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left (D.L.) and a special D.L. delegate conference will go ahead this evening (Wednesday). </p><h> <bold> <#> Loss </bold> </h><p> <#> Deputy Hogan 's appointment will temper the loss to the county of the Minister of State portfolio held by Fianna F&/ail 's Liam Aylward T.D. for almost three years. </p><p> <#> Deputy Hogan will not be a member of the cabinet to be named by new Taoiseach, John Bruton. <#> However, the 34 year old will be appointed to one of the key junior positions possibly in the economic sphere. </p><p> <#> This will reflect his recent high public profile as Fine Gael spokesman on Transport, Energy and Communication. </p><p> <#> He raised the deletion of key parts from a consultant 's report on the proposed mine in Galmoy in what became known as the Cowengate affair. </p><p> <#> There will be no such job for Carlow 's Fine Gael Deputy, John Browne or for Deputy Seamus Pattison of Labour who looks unlikely to be brought into Government. </p><p> <#> Despite suggestions to the contrary, Fine Gael are committed to entering Government and will have eight members in the new cabinet. </p><h> <bold> <#> Agriculture </bold> </h><p> <#> It is almost certain that Wexford T.D. Mr Ivan Yates will be the new Minister for Agriculture while Deputy Michael Lowry from Thurles, currently Fine Gael Chief whip will also receive a senior ministry possibly Tourism and Trade. </p><p> <#> The Minister for Justice will be a Fine Gael appointee while the key Environment portfolio will go to Labour. <#> There will be one or two members of Democratic Left, leader Proinsias de Rossa T.D. and probably Pat Rabbitte. </p><p> <#> A key figure in the local Labour organisation feels there will be little change in the Labour appointees from the last cabinet but that there could be changes in their portfolios. </p><h> <bold> <#> Michael D. </bold> </h><p> <#> Michael D Higgins is the bookie 's warm favourite to be re-appointed as Minister for the Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht. </p><p> <#> There is considerable speculation that senior counsel, Mr Dermot Gleeson will be offered the position of Attorney General. </p><p> <#> A close confidant of Mr Bruton, it was at Mr Gleeson 's private residence that Mr Bruton first met with Labour leader, Mr Dick Spring for talks on a new government following the collapse of the Fianna F&/ail-Labour administration. </p><p> <#> However outgoing Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr Mervyn Taylor T.D. is also being mentioned for the position of Attorney General. <#> He would be the first solicitor to hold the position. </p><p> <#> Already Fine Gael activists in Kilkenny are looking forward to Deputy Hogan 's promotion. </p><p> <#> He was elected to the Senate in 1987 having unsuccessfully contested the general election. <#> He was elected to the D&/ail in 1989 and re-elected in 1992. </p><p> <#> He was co-opted on to Kilkenny Co Council in 1982 following the death of his father Tom. <#> In 1985 he was elected Chairman of Kilkenny Co Council. </p><p> <#> He holds a B.A. H Dip from University College Cork. <#> He received his secondary education at St Joseph 's Freshford and at St Kieran 's College, Kilkenny. </p><p> <#> On appointment, he will have to resign as a member of Kilkenny County Council and will also have to step down as a member of the South Eastern Health Board. </p><p> <#> It is expected that these vacancies will not be filled until February and already there are strong indications that "new blood" will be brought in to strengthen the party at local level. </p></I><I><W2C-0151$B><h> <bold> <#> Tried to eat cannabis </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> A MAN tried to eat a piece of cannabis resin when he was being interviewed in Kilkenny Garda Station. </bold> </p><p> <bold> <#> Shane Ryan, </bold> Priory Lodge, John 's Quay, Kilkenny, pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis resin and to obstructing Sgt. Michael Quinlan, Garda Pat Starr and Garda Eamon Doyle. </p><p> <bold> <#> Garda Pat Starr </bold> gave evidence that he and Sgt. Quinlan went to the Kilford Arms at around 5 p.m. on November 12, on the basis of information they had received. </p><p> <#> Garda Starr told Ryan, who was with two others, that he wanted to bring him to the Garda Station to search him, as he had reason to believe that he had a controlled drug. </p><p> <#> When Ryan stood up, Garda Starr noticed a small slab of material underneath him. <#> When he asked him to account for it, Ryan denied that it was his. </p><p> <#> In the interview room at the Garda Station, Garda Starr left the slab of material on the counter and went next door to get an evidence bag. <#> He had just left when he heard a commotion in the interview room. <#> He returned to find Sgt. Quinlan grappling with the defendant. </p><p> <#> <quote> "Shane Ryan was attempting to eat the material. <#> I retrieved it and placed it in an evidence bag," </quote> Garda Starr recalled. <#> The material was found to contain .250 grams of cannabis resin. </p><p> <#> Defending solicitor <bold> Mr Michael Lanigan </bold> said that the 20-year-old, who came from a very good family, was currently attending a hotel and catering college in Portrush. <#> His obstruction of the Gardai was impulsive, when he realised the situation he had got himself into. </p><p> <#> <quote> "He believed he was facing the demise of his reputation and character and he acted in a way that was stupid and he is sorry for it," </quote> said Mr Lanigan.<p> <#> The solicitor added that Ryan 's family was positively ashamed of the disgrace he had brought on them and he would be willing to undergo any test to show the court that he was drugs-free and would remain drugs-free. </p><p> <bold> <#> Judge William Harnett </bold> adjourned the case until February 14 for a Probation Officer 's report, querying substance abuse. </p></I><I><W2C-0151$C><h> <bold> <quote> <#> "Stay away from airports!" </quote> says Judge </bold> </h><p> <#> A YOUTH climbed into an ambulance outside St. Luke 's Hospital late at night and started blowing the horn, Kilkenny Court was told. </p><p> <#> His defending solicitor said that <bold> Patrick Houlihan, </bold> 11 Ossory Park, Kilkenny, had always wanted to see the inside of an ambulance. </p><p> <#> <quote> "For God 's sake tell him to stay away from airports!" </quote> declared <bold> Judge William Harnett. </bold> </p><p> <bold> <#> Inspector Michael Delaney </bold> said that Gardai were called to the hospital at around 11.15 p.m. on June 24, because youths were causing trouble and interfering with ambulances. </p><p> <#> Houlihan was sitting in the front of an ambulance and was blowing the horn. <#> He denied the incident when he was confronted by Gardai. <#> He was summonsed for interfering with the mechanism of an ambulance. </p><p> <#> Defending solicitor <bold> Mrs. Mary Molloy </bold> said that the 18-year-old had been drinking with friends during a World Cup match. <#> One of his friends dislocated his arm and they went to the casualty department in St. Luke 's. <#> Houlihan could not resist the temptation of getting into an ambulance outside the casualty section. </p><p> <#> <quote> "He tells me that he long harboured the desire to see what the inside of an ambulance looked like," </quote> Mrs. Molloy told the court. <#> The solicitor added that this was the first time any member of her client 's family was in trouble. </p><p> <#> Inspector Delaney confirmed that Houlihan came from good family. <#> It was just a case of youths messing and there was no intention to remove the vehicle. </p><p> <#> Noting that Houlihan should take his court appearance as a warning, Judge Harnett gave him the benefit of the Probation Act. </p></I><I><W2C-0151$D><h> <bold> <#> Christmas winner for schoolgirl </bold> </h><it> <#> By Carmel Hayes </it><p> <#> A CHRISTMAS card designed by a Kilkenny schoolgirl is now on sale throughout Dublin. </p><p> <#> The card, designed by Bevin Grant from Piltown, was professionally printed after she was runner-up in a national competition. </p><p> <#> And to mark her achievement, Bevin was presented with a prize by US Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith, at her residence in the Phoenix Park. </p><p> <#> The national school student from Tybroughney, Piltown, was one of ten runners-up from hundreds of entries, in the national <it> Irish Times / </it> US Embassy Design a Christmas Card competition. </p><p> <#> She was a special guest at a children 's Christmas party, complete with a buffet and present-laden Santa, which was hosted by the US Ambassador to announce the national winners. <#> She was personally congratulated by Mrs. Kennedy Smith and was presented with a painting kit. </p><p> <#> <quote> "I was surprised to win and the day was very exciting," </quote> said the delighted 11-year-old, who attends Piltown National School. </p><p> <#> Bevin 's cheerful design greatly impressed the judges and has now been printed for sale in aid of the children 's charities Barnardos and Focus on Children. </p><p> <#> The card features a jolly snowman, wearing a red hat, scarf and gloves, who is holding a sheet of Christmas carols. </p><p> <#> The cards are on sale from the Barnardos headquarters at Christchurch Square in Dublin and from the organisation 's shops in Clondalkin, Liffey street, Rathmines and Dun Laoghaire. </p><p> <#> Bevin is now looking forward to sending her cards to friends and relations this Christmas. <#> A keen artist, she has been successful in a range of competitions, particularly at Iverk Show. <#> She is one of five daughters of Una and Jim Grant of Piltown. </p></I><I><W2C-015$E><h> <bold> <#> CALLAN - The future looks bright </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> CALLAN is getting its best ever Christmas present this year with confirmation that the new bridge for the long awaited by-pass will start construction early in the new year. </bold> </p><p> <#> And people of Callan are in buoyant mood according to successful businessman and local public representative, Cllr. Jimmy Brett who said he was delighted with the news and feels that it will act as a catalyst for further development in the town. <p><p> <#> <quote> "My main political <}> <-> </-> </}> since I was first appointed to Kilkenny County Council has been to secure the by-pass for Callan." </quote> </p><p> <#> He said that it was great satisfaction that the long years of suffering endured by the people of Callan, truck drivers and motorists was at an end. </p><p> <#> He told the <it> 'People </it> that the contract for the first stage of the multi million development had been awarded to John Craddock & Company, Naas. <#> This has been approved by the National Roads Authority. </p><p> <#> He thanked the management of Kilkenny Co Council for their work on bringing the project to fruition, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Michael Smith T.D. and the National Roads Authority. </p><p> <#> <quote> "Most of all I want to thank the people of Callan for their patience and support," </quote> Cllr Brett said. </p><#> Local industries continue to blossom with S.F.L. <#> Engineering continues to forge new contracts in previously untapped markets. </p><p> <#> The Callan Bacon company is also trading extremely well while the small but hugely independent Callan Co-operative Society trading better than many of its bigger neighbours. </p><p> <#> Callan acts as a magnet to shoppers from Kells, Kilmoganny, Windgap and Mullinahone who are happy to give their business to tried and trusted traders who have been with them through good times and bad. </p><p> <#> Business woman Mrs Breda Somers of Adelphi House, Bridge Street has noticed an increase in heavy goods vehicles using Callan in the last few months. </p><p> <#> It is thought that the drivers of these articulated lorries coming from Waterford and Tipperary have a better run to and from Dublin since the Kilcullen by pass opened. </p><p> <#> Two new books on Callan have just been published. <#> Volume one of Callan 's Pictorial Past is available at <*> pound sign </*> 5 per copy. </p><p> <#> This is a must for anybody interested in their own place or in local history. <#> It was produced by John O'Keeffe and Sean Holden. </p><p> <#> The second is a detailed account of the goings on in the "Callan Tenant Protection Society." <#> This excellent work was launched by Bishop Laurence Forristal in the town on Friday evening. </p><p> <#> Callan has a fine academic record with both St Brigid 's College and the CBS Secondary School recording excellent results and adding to the reputation of the town. </p></I><I><W2C-0151$F><h> <bold> <#> SFL - a sound structure </bold> </h><p> <#> SINCE the Berlin Wall came down, and the frontiers of Eastern Europe were opened, SFL Engineering Ltd. at Callan has been successful in capturing some of the market opportunities that have become available as a result of the major rebuilding programme that is presently taking place in Germany and these Eastern countries. </p><h> <bold> <#> Investment </bold> </h><p> <#> From Statoil, who have also invested heavily in the Irish market, SFL was successful in obtaining the contract to build a large number of new petrol retain forecourt canopies for their service stations and this contract is expected to run for three years. </p><p> <#> SFL Engineering are steadily increasing their penetration of export markets and during 1994 carried out contracts in China, Israel, the Philippines, Denmark and Germany. </p><p> <#> SFL employ approximately 70 people at its plant in Callan. <#> The company expects additional jobs to be created as it further penetrates the export markets. </p></I>
