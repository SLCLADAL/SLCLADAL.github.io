<W1B-003 Thailand letters 1><I><W1B-003$A><h> <#> 03/02/97 </h><p> <#> Hi Lynne <#> - Well As promised - A letter, although to tell you the truth not a lot has happened here over the past month <#> I 'm getting a bit fed up with going out in Killyleagh so I think I 'll spend the next few weekends in Belfast with Kevin - who is currently too sick to even sit at his desk at the minute. <#> Apparently he has a slipped disc and is in complete agony. <#> I went up to Belfast last weekend. <#> Both of us were broke so we couldn't go out anywhere and Kevin has this <ul> major </ul> piece of work to be in for March so he was studying <ul> all </ul> the time - I was bored out of my mind. </p><p> <#> I 'm trying to learn how to play the guitar. <#> Flap is going to give both me and Lorcan lessons from next week onwards - in exchange for driving lessons! - in my car <#> That will totally kill it. <#> My Mum probably mentioned in her letter but Flap + Red won <*> pound sign </*> 2000 in the lottery - 5 numbers - <#> They are like <}> <-> celebreties </-> </+> celebrities </+> </}> in Killyleagh now <*> plus sign </*> needless to say everyone 's looking a loan from them. </p><p> <#> Jennifer has just recently been asking, <quote>"<}> <-> Wheres </-> <+> Where 's </+> </}> Lynnie?" </quote> <#> A whole month and she 's only realising now! </p><p> <#> - Dermot was working in Smugglers last weekend and at the end of the night he found a lottery ticket - <#> He checked the numbers the next day - 4 numbers - the lucky git won <*> pound sign </*>128 - <#> He didn't tell mum so <ul> don't </ul> mention it in any of your letters. </p><p> <#> I haven't seen Del or Paul since you left but Kevin said they were both at the Union on New <}> <-> Years </-> <+> Year 's </+> </}> eve - totally off their heads. </p><p> <#> Your house looked very nice <*> plus sign </*> big - which it will need to be if everybody comes out that says they 're going to! <#> I 'll probably book my ticket at Easter. <#> <}> <-> Kevins </-> <+> Kevin 's </+> </}> not sure how long he can stay for but I hope to stay for at least 6 weeks - <#> Write to Kevin - <#> he 's pissed off that you haven't replied to his letter yet - <#> I 'll write again when something interesting happens - if it does! </p><p> <#> -See you soon <#> Love <#> Vanessa <#> PS I passed my exams - </p><p> <#> - I didn't realise there was room on this side - <#> It seems such a waste so I 'll try to think of something else to write. </p><p> <#> Sorry - can't think of anything! <#> Bye </p></I><I><W1B-003$A><h> <#> 12/04/97 </h><p> <#> Hi Lynne, <#> Well, after talking to you this morning I eventually persuaded Jessica to come to Thailand with me. <#> We went into Downpatrick and booked ourselves onto the cheapest flight possible - <*> pound sign </*> 547 return - flying with B.A. <#> we are flying out on the 19th June - <#> Jessica is staying for 3 weeks - going back on the 8th July - <#> I 'm staying slightly longer - 7 weeks going back on 6th August. <#> Jessica hasn't even booked her time off yet so she 's shitting herself in case her boss says that she can't have those particular weeks off. </p><p> <#> I told her that you were in Cambodia and she said that was something she would really like to do. <#> I know you won't be able to get a lot of time <}> <-> of </-> <+> off </+> </}> when we arrive but basically Jessica wants to travel round Thailand for about a week, spend a week relaxing - beach, snorkelling, watersports etc and maybe a week in Cambodia/Vietnam. <#> We both need a visa as we 're staying for longer than 14 days so write back <*> plus sign </*> tell us exactly where to get it from. <#> Also if you want anything brought out I should be able to manage it as long as <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> not too big. - <#> I 'm hoping to bring very little with me as I can wear your clothes and therefore have loads of room to bring stuff back with me. <#> The flight money has just about cleaned me out - <#> I hope to bring loads of spending money but God knows where I 'm going to get it from! </p><p> <#> Kevin probably won't be able to afford Thailand as he has spent quite a lot of his own money getting to Nepal. <#> He 's away for two weeks to the international SCI Conference - <#> it only lasts 5 days so he should have plenty of time to go up Mount Everest <*> plus sign </*> back. - <#> No doubt he 'll do it in record time! - <#> I think my dad wrote to you last week so he probably told you all about Dermot and his <ul> 4 </ul> encounters with the police over the past few months - 3 for underage drinking <*> plus sign </*> one for <ul> theft! </ul> - <#> I 'll explain it all to you when I get out there. </p><p> <#> I 've just been round at <}> <-> Edels </-> <+> Edel 's </+> </}> for a few hours - both of us sitting in her garden, drinking beer, playing the guitar <*> ampersand </*> watching Tony work. <#> He 's doing up the garden - laying concrete slabs, planting flowers etc. <#> He 's actually quite nice once you get to know him. - <#> Well, I think I 'd better go inside now before I get burnt to a cinder - <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> quite hot here today although if you were here you 'd probably be sitting with a jumper on. - <#> Write back and fill us in on all the details of what we should bring out with us etc. - <#> We are expecting you to meet us at the airport by the way - <#> I can't really imagine me and Jessica finding our way round Bangkok by ourselves </p><p> <#> See you soon <#> Love <#> Vanessa. </p></I><I><W1A-003$B><h> <#> 29 Ardmore Drive <#> Belfast <#> (Ages ago...) </h><p> <#> <&Thai> Sa wa dee ka </&Thai> <&> 'Hello' in Thai </&> Lynnie!!<#> How 's things? <#> I realise you 're probably not in Khorat to get this as <}> <-> yer </-> <+> you 're </+> </}> probably off in Vietnam or something cosmic like that!! <#> It 's a pity <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> so expensive to phone. <#> Anyway, the job sounds great. <#> I haven't got your letter yet - <#> I hope it comes soon as I 'm dying to hear more about it. <#> Do you honestly think I 'd be able to do it?? <#> I 'm a bit worried about going out <*> ampersand </*> not being able to do it or whatever. <#> My parents are willing to lend me the cash to get out there (again!!) <#> I 'm still in the Fair Trade shop (month 9 - can U believe it!?) <#> How long is this job in Thailand for? <#> Are you leaving T'land to go to Coleraine in September?? <#> Or are U you gonna going to stay on a bit? <#> I 'm a bit worried about being in Khorat on my <}> <-> todd </-> <+> tod </+> </}> - although I 'd probably be settled enough by the time you left. <#> It 's just that I can only speak about 3 fucking words of Thai!! </p><p> <#> Anyway, your letter was great - sounds like a totally <ul> mad </ul> time!! <#> Your 46 year old drinking partner sounds like a serious character all right. <#> <}> <-> Carel 's </-> <+> Carol 's </+> </}> still in Hungary. <#> She didn't enjoy it at all at first but she seems to be getting into it all right now. <#> This won't get to you in time probably but ... </p><p> <#> !! HAPPY ST. PADDY'S DAY!! <#> I hope you get totally pissed wherever you were! </p><p> <#> Life here is just O.K. <#> The weather is picking up a bit, job isn't as bad as it was, I 'm still totally fucking skint all the time <*> ampersand </*> I 've basically been getting plastered loads <*> ampersand </*> being very silly indeed. <#> I 've been going out with this guy Larry for about 5 or 6 months now (sort of) <*> ampersand </*> he 's great crack, dead sweet, sensitive <*> ampersand </*> intelligent .... and he doesn't like penetrative sex!! <#> What!?! <#> I know - does my <}> <-> fuckin' </-> <+> fucking </+> </}> head in. <#> I reckon maybe he 's a closet gay - only joking. <#> So I 've been a bit sexually frustrated - <#> I quite fancy the idea of being a lesbian instead - or bi anyway - <#> Whaddya reckon babe!? <#> My mate Ellen has sort of got a thing going with a really sexy girl we met in the Parliament (my favourite haunt these days) - <#> <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> all rather hilarious - <#> she 's been running about like a horny 16 year old virgin! </p><p> <#> Anyway, I have, as usual, been basically getting shitfaced till that bastard phenomenon reality is but a mere speck on the horizon, grinding my teeth through the daily chores of being assistant manager of this dear shop <*> ampersand </*> biding my time to do the RSA Tefl in Queen 's in July. <#> Yes, every year up till this one it was <*> pound sign </*> 360 or something. <#> This year <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> <*> pound sign </*> 725. <#> If I stuck this job till the end of my contract (end of June) I 'd get <*> pound sign </*> 250 towards it <*> ampersand </*> I 've also got <*> pound sign </*>250 from the trust funds so it 's still a possible option. <#> At least then I 'd have a bit of confidence when I went wherever to teach. <#> But really, I can't be arsed with being so skint etc for another 3 1/2 months <*> ampersand </*> then U told me about the job <*> ampersand </*> it sounds great <*> ampersand </*> I guess I can always do the Tefl another time etc etc etc. <#> God to think I could be out there with you dead soon - mad! <#> I need to know more about the job first though I think. <#> For once in my life I 'm trying to think what 'll be best career wise etc. <#> Lots of people keep telling me to stick at this job <*> ampersand </*> do the good tefl blah blah blah. <#> I don't think I want to. <#> This job sounds too good to be true - although I realise <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> not <}> <-> definate </-> <+> definite </+> </}> yet or anything. <#> Whaaa! <#> I wanna go diving <*> ampersand </*> I wanna go to Vietnam, or maybe Australia or who knows!! <#> What 's your plans?? <#> Fancy a bit a Cambodia, eh what? <#> All that <quote> "war torn society" </quote> business ... <#> Talking of which, there 's soldiers all over the show here - everywhere ya fuckin' look! <#> Does my face in big time!!! </p><p> <#> Well, I 've decided I 'm gonna go <*> ampersand </*> ask Gene Your Nessa 's boyfriend <&> 'Your Nessa's boyfriend' inserted above 'Gene' </&> for his advice about what I should do ... <&> 'about what I should do ...' inserted above 'advice' </&> <#> - he 's always so sensible & 'global' thinking. <#> I 'm in a bit of a rut, but it 's a very cosy, comfortable rut <*> ampersand </*> my usual hard-nosed <quote> "I can go anywhere <*> ampersand </*> do anything" </quote> attitude is rather fuzzy. <#> He 'll probably give me a couple of good answers to all these little queries. <#> Lordy knows I need 'em!! <#> I have to decide <ul> real </ul> soon as the cheaper shitty tefl is at the end of March. <#> EEK! <#> There 's an even <}> <-> shitier </-> <+> shittier </+> </}> cheaper one in Stranmillis - finishes on 18th April - which is rather late to being going out to T'land <&> Thailand </&> . <#> I mean I could do with a couple of weeks to chill, get used to culture, heat <*> ampersand </*> other chaos that place is!!! </p><p> <#> I know I probably would be wasting time <*> ampersand </*> <*> pound sign </*> doing the cheap <}> <-> shity </-> <+> shitty </+> </}> ones, but I don't think I could go all the way to T'land <&> Thailand </&> to teach with absolutely nothing! <#> I 'd be keeking myself the whole time. </p><p> <#> Whaddya think? <#> Sorry this letter is such a ramble, but this is me trying to be sensible!!! </p><p> <#> Did you get yourself a motorbike? <#> We 'd have to get one between us if not. <#> <ul> And </ul> (just a wee thought) - I don't know if you 're paying rent or not, but if I got this job <*> ampersand </*> came over, as you said <}> <-> yerself </-> <+> yourself </+> </}> , I could get a mansion for <*> pound sign </*> 200 a month - with air-con <*> ampersand </*> a shower etc - we could both live in it <*> ampersand </*> then U wouldn't have to spend money on rent. <#> Besides it would be excellent to share a place - <#> I 'd much rather! <#> What larks would be had!! <#> Whaddya think? </p><p> <#> Have you seen Aat yet? <#> I kind of hope not for your sake, though it sounds like yer well over that anyway!!! </p><p> Well me dear, I 'll love ya <*> ampersand </*> leave ya <*> ampersand </*> hopefully see you soon. <#> By the way, I don't know if U sent a fax but it didn't arrive if U did. <#> The number is 01447 674528 - could be that our fax machine is a load of wank. <#> Stay in touch ASAP - <#> I look forward to getting your letter - </p><p> <#> Lots of love <&> ampersand </&> ginger beer <*> ampersand </*> good ol' Irish <}> <-> wwwhiskey </-> <+> whiskey </+> </}> , </p><p> <#> Elaine <#> XOXOXO <#> P.S. Please try <*> ampersand </*> let me know A.S.A.P what the job entails! <#> Cheers me lovely! <#> xo </p></I>
