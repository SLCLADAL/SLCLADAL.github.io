<ICE-IRE:S2A-034 Physical disability><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-034$A> <#> Now I was saying I made a mistake last week <#> I I <.> wa </.> was doing a workshop and uh asked for volunteers for rapporteur and nobody came forward <#> So I said right thanks very much Dan speaking to Dan Connolly so he <.> accept </.> he said right I 'm getting you next week <&> laughter </&> <#> That 's why <#> Uhm I think I think the best thing to do uh is just to run through and try and uh recap on what was said <,> uhm and see if we cannot come up with recommendations from that uhm <,> <.> a </.> <.> a </.> as quickly as we can in the next twenty minutes or so <#> Uhm <,> just to put the thing into context again to repeat a few things that Carl said <.> a </.> at the opening uh of the of the workshop that we are looking at a six-year programme taking us up to the to the actually the the new decade the new millennium up to the year two thousand <#> So it is a a long-term thing that we 're looking at and uh there are going to be a lot of factors influencing uh Northern Ireland people with disabilities during that time uh not least the super <,> route highway whatever it is coming across from America and various other things too <#> We 're an Objective One country which uh is <.> g </.> is bound to affect our applications and the whole timing of of the uh <,> uh operation of plan and and the proposals going to it uh is something to bear in mind too <#> Uh there are certain common themes that that must be met looking at the trans-national dimension the innovativeness of projects <,> uhm the <.> te </.> tendency towards the acquisition of qualifications for participants on it uh <,> facilitating more efficient delivery uh adopting a co-ordinated approach and that can mean an awful lot of things which I think we came to a wee bit later and flexibility in terms of uh looking at the future needs both at this stage known and unknown needs uh of people with disabilities for the next six years <#> We looked at a definition of disability uhm <,> and I I think came up with uh a as Daniel was saying two sides of a coin <#> Uh one is the uh actual disability itself and how do we uh start to implement programmes that will tackle that or uhm uh ease the the difficulties that the disability might present in terms of employment of one form or another <#> The other side of it is looking at the sort of broader environmental problems that people with disabilities <,> problems is the wrong word <.> th </.> the the broader environmental things that face people with disabilities uh that will restrict their ability to actually uh uh do things productively uh in employment terms <#> And the the programme is not confined to the <.> dis </.> <.> dis </.> disability or disabled people but at uh environmental change as well with the exception of access equipment and and some of the the uh other issues like that <#> Just one or two other things <#> Uhm I noted the difficulty of fitting people into specific categories <,> uh which which maybe <.> s </.> maybe should be taking uh uh recognition of in the proposals <#> Uh there is uh a an element of tailoring training to individual needs and that has resource implications which probably will be reflected in proposals that go forward but it 's important to recognise those now in order to get quality training for individuals <#> Uhm <,> and also to identify all of the relevant environmental barriers uh because if we identify them then we can also identify ways of overcoming them <#> That 's just the context of it <#> I don't know if you want to stop then and see if there are recommendations <#> Uhm kind of maybe of issuing a checklist of the common themes to everybody because that maybe isn't uhm <,> clear to everybody coming into the project new <#> Looking at the definition of disability cos that can then lead on to other avenues for people <,> and and and and also the cost implications of of individual tailored <.> t </.> individually-tailored training and uh the environmental barriers and developing programmes in in in the context of that<ICE-IRE:S2A-034$B> <#> Is that a fair enough synopsis of <,> okay<ICE-IRE:S2A-034$A> <#> Uh going on to the awareness the information uhm as as as <.> so </.> as was being pointed out earlier the communication actually comes through very very strongly throughout all of what we 've been talking about <,> the need to to gather information and disseminate <.> in </.> information uh not just from uh <,> the top down so to speak from Mark down to the to the project promoters uh but also between the project promoters between different uh statutory agencies <,> uh between uh existing projects and new projects coming on stream the whole area of communication is is really vital <#> Uhm <,> <.> a </.> and we do need to look at at co-operation and and co-ordination activities practical physical uh <.> co </.> co-ordination of of efforts uh between the statutory sector <,> uh between the the <,> project promoters and and T and EA uh <.> an </.> and between the project promoters themselves <#> Also within that it <.> w </.> we we were <.> g </.> we were talking about bringing in key players who previously up to now have not been brought into the process <#> And I think that 's true not just for European programmes but for any project that 's happening in in Northern Ireland uhm of of of identifying who is important like social workers who maybe aren't uh haven't been involved uh uh uh as much as they they could 've been to date <#> It 's also about identifying good practice uhm and disseminating that good practice in Northern Ireland <,> uh and beyond Northern Ireland too <#> Uhm <,> certainly it 's it 's a lot better now and the T and EA have done a lot of good work in terms of bringing people together and and and and allowing people to to tell each other what they 've been doing <#> But certainly at the start there was there was a case of people were doing things and not knowing the left hand wasn't knowing what the right hand was doing <#> So it 's getting better and more can be done <#> Uhm avoiding duplication 's very important as well <,> essential part of the communication process <#> We looked at mainstream uh ESF funding <,> and uh <,> uh the the good parts of Horizon One may be going into mainstream funding rather than being part of Horizon Two <#> Uhm <,> a few other points just in the information awareness section uh we were talking about research uh looking at the needs of disabled people asking disabled people themselves uh what their needs were uh and and developing programmes from that or it being a programme itself <#> Uhm <,> we looked at the difficulty of reaching disabled people in terms of accessing them information about them their numbers where they live <,> uhm and what their problems are <#> We looked at the the the materials that were required and and I think that then also goes back to the needs of disabled people as well cos we can't assume uh what <.> th </.> uh what their needs are or what the materials <,> what <,> the best materials would be to to reach them <#> Uhm the sort of people involved in that type of outreach work uhm <,> and as I say the numbers of disabled people and where they are <#> Looked at the issue of raising aspirations and confidence uh amongst disabled people <#> <.> C </.> come back on to that in terms as training but it 's all part of people recognising their own potential and and possibly also as I say getting onto the sort of progressive type of training and geographic distinction <,> distinctions in terms of the information that 's available how to get it out and also in terms of the type of initiatives that might be uh operated <#> There may be differences and there are differences between west of the Bann and east of the Bann and north and south and <,> Belfast and non-Belfast and Derry and non-Derry <,> <#> It 's information inawareness <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-034$B> <#> Okay right <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-034$A> <#> Do you want me just to stand up<ICE-IRE:S2A-034$B> <#> Yes <{> <[> just just interject if you can </[><ICE-IRE:S2A-034$A> <#> <[> Uh yep fine I </[> </{> was going through it very quickly cos I 'm worried about the time <#> Uhm <,> in terms of training uh <,> I think that that we were saying uh <,> IT is is really vitally important and is going to become more important as as the years go go on <#> Uhm <,> and that there are problems in opportunities that are associated with uh developing IT training specifically for people with disabilities <,> but that there is a a vital need to to uh be looking at projects <,> developing projects that are a lot broader than just IT uhm <,> looking at other uh <,> uh skill development for people with disabilities uh particularly given the context of where the employment opportunities may lie uh <,> both now and in in five and ten years ' time <#> Uhm uh IT even for any job uh is only one part of it <#> There are a lot of other social administrative and management skills that are important uh and therefore the programmes uh hopefully will be reflecting that and and going broader than IT while while IT is actually very important <#> Looked at uhm pre-vocational training personal skills development <,> again it 's linked to confidence-raising and awareness-raising aspiration-raising <#> Uh and there may be examples of good practice even in even in Britain that we 'll we could be <.> adop </.> adopting here uhm that uh that aren't being adopted <#> Uh initiatives projects funding uh that that is available in Britain that that we don't have access to <,> here <#> Uhm and I suppose I mean the recommendation on that probably is to look at what is happening across the water and and try and try and uh implement it here <#> I don't know if that 's possible or not through through the Horizon initiative <#> Uhm the Northern Ireland lacks a specialism here in terms of pre-vocational training because of its size and because of its <,> to an extent lack of resources uh and I suppose because of the the the number of <,> or the the the smaller actual number of people with disabilities here although proportionately it 's probably higher than than across the water uh head for head <#> We looked at uh training uh uh disabled people themselves to become trainers <,> uhm you know which which may be a an avenue to pursue <#> Again it 's it 's it 's something that we people who are not uhm uh very physically disabled are are have other forms of disability uhm shouldn't really be making too many assumptions about the needs of people with disabilities <#> And uh people with disabilities who are trainers are supposed to be role models themselves uh for other people with disabilities <#> And that 's an issue maybe of of uh <,> another issue of involving people with disabilities themselves uh in the development uh and uh clarification of initiatives <,> uhm <,> uh both now and and as the initiatives are are monitored on an ongoing basis <#> Uh and then finally we looked at uh accreditation uh and uh building accreditation into existing programmes or possibly having a a central accreditation project that can provide accreditation to other projects or provide advice <,> uh to other projects in terms of accreditation <#> And that 's what I had under training <#> Anything else <#> And this can take the form of recommendations <{> <[> I suppose it 's what we what we </[> discussed <#> Briefly touched on on self-employment <#> It 's touched on other issues as well uh in in terms of empowerment uh that we 've been talking about <#> Uhm <,> again there there 's an issue there of of various projects now that are being run that that uh where the the uh the information and and the successes that that that uh for example RNIB are having I you know uhm a lot of people wouldn't be aware of that<ICE-IRE:S2A-034$B> <#> <[> Mhm mhm yeah mhm </[> </{></I>
