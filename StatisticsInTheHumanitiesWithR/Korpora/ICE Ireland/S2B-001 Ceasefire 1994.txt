<ICE-IRE:S2B-001 Ceasefire 1994><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> It 's nine minutes to eleven <#> You 're watching a UTV Live special <#> Grassroots Loyalists gave an upbeat reaction to the IRA ceasefire in a special phone-in discussion programme on the Shankill Road tonight <#> The consensus opinion was a calm and a considered one<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$B> <#> The Shankill Road 's community radio station made itself available as a forum for public debate tonight <,> and scores of listeners availed of the opportunity <#> Community leaders <,> representative of working-class Loyalist opinion <,> gathered for a debate and phone-in <#> Having had twenty-four hours to study the text of the IRA statement <,> people 's comments were upbeat <#> Jackie Hewitt helped man the phones<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$C> <#> There there was quite a few calls came in <,> obviously from the greater Shankill area but there was also uh phone calls that came in from the Falls and uh from from along the Antrim Road there <,> from some of the Nationalist areas <,> making some comments <,> some very positive comments <#> Uh there was one pensioner uh from the Falls Road had said that that she was delighted with the responses that was coming <,> coming from the group<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$B> <#> There was none of the paranoia so often associated with Unionism <#> Instead Belfast journalist <,> Jim McDowell <,> who presented the programme <,> sensed a new pragmatism<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$D> <#> We heard the consensus opinion here tonight that yes <,> Sinn Fein are going to have to be confronted <,> but across a table <,> not at a point of a gun <#> And they have taken on the ceasefire <,> there 's been no <.> n </.> <.> knee </.> kneejerk reaction <,> as I said we had twelve people from this area here tonight <,> all respected community representatives <,> and it wasn't <,> no ceasefire <#> Ulster says no <#> Protestant says no <#> They said <,> we are looking at this <#> We will consider it and then we will formulate a way to go forward and we will talk about progress<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$B> <#> Not one of the panellists <,> among them former senior UDA man Glen Barr <,> thought the IRA ceasefire should be rejected<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$C> <#> I was really surprised <#> I mean there was no negativity at all from the group of uh varied community workers and so on around the table and from Londonderry and from other parts of the province <#> And uh certainly from the greater Shankill the phone calls that were coming in judging by them uh there there there was very <,> still wary but very positive<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$B> <#> Glen Barr says the ceasefire doesn't mean a secret deal has been struck with Republicans <#> Instead <,> he believes the IRA finally decided their violence was futile <#> Protestants he says <,> have nothing to fear from the announcement<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$E> <#> I think they 've come to the same conclusion as myself <,> that they 've nothing to be ashamed of <#> They should be holding their head high tonight uh because after twenty-five years of Provo violence they have come through this <#> There 's no united Ireland<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$B> <#> And he had a message for Loyalist terrorists not to repeat the mistakes of the past<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$E> <#> I would advise the Loyalist paramilitaries that they shouldn't be first onto the streets this time <#> These politicians who are crying for civil war and all the rest of it <,> let them get out onto the streets<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> Well meanwhile tonight 's meeting in Belfast City Council was adjourned when the Unionist parties united to force through a motion expressing sympathy for IRA victims <#> Earlier the Lord Mayor Hugh Smyth urged Loyalist terrorists to end their violence and the Alliance Party 's deputy leader Seamus Close applauded those comments <#> He said he hoped the terrorists would heed Mr Smyth 's words <#> Our reporter Conor Macauley asked the Lord Mayor for his reaction as day one of the ceasefire unfolded<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Well naturally it 's it 's it 's just too soon to be giving impressions <,> but the one thing that I would say that immediately after midnight the scenes that I witnessed on television this morning <,> with people running around wearing badges of victory were completely unhelpful <#> But however I don't know what the badges of victory are for you know but <,> it 's certainly unhelpful <#> But however I 'm still optimistic for the future<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$B> <#> What 's your advice now or what would you say to Loyalist paramilitaries at this stage<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Well I would I would certainly sincerely hope that the Loyalist paramilitaries would do with this statement that they did with the Joint Declaration and that would be simply to sit back <,> to analyse it and hopefully to be able to come forward with a positive decision <,> one which I would hope would mean an end to violence from all sections of our community<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$B> <#> Are you confident that they might too decide to lay down their guns<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Well I <.> w </.> I would certainly hope so <#> I believe that there 's a whole lot of factors needs to be considered <#> I believe that they need to be assured as I do that there will be no constitutional change in Northern Ireland without the wishes of the greater number of people <#> And I believe that if that can be given that there is real hope for a lasting peace from all sections of the community<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> Now twenty-three hours on <,> two key questions remain <#> Is the IRA ceasefire permanent and forever <#> And there 's been some movement on that today <#> But the other question remains almost entirely unanswered <#> How will the Loyalist terror groups react <#> Well for an assessment I 've been talking to David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party <#> He 's a man believed to have an insight into the thinking of Loyalists paramilitary groups <#> And incidentally the interview was recorded before Albert Reynolds made his television appeal tonight <#> David Ervine do Loyalist groups have any problem with the wording of the IRA ceasefire<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$G> <#> Words are merely words <#> Uhm the Unionist people would have every cause to be dubious about IRA words because they 've suffered so brutally at the hands of the IRA in relation to their actions <#> I suppose it 's a cliche/ but action speaks louder than words and certainly the Unionist people will be analyzing every deed of the IRA and possibly every word from here on in<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> So it doesn't really matter whether it 's a complete cessation or a permanent cessation on paper <#> It 's what happens over the next weeks and months that counts<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Interpretation uh is everything <#> Uhm we will place our interpretation on that <,> uhm I 'm sure the Nationalist people will do the same <,> international <,> it 'll be done the same <#> But uh we 'll all have different opinions on what the IRA are up to I 'm sure<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> How do you think the Loyalist terror groups are going to respond <,><ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> The Loyalists terror groups in my opinion uhm <,> like the rest of Unionism <,> are fearful of one thing <#> They 're not fearful of an IRA ceasefire <#> Indeed I think they probably welcome an IRA ceasefire because perhaps finally <,> after twenty-five bloody years <,> the IRA have realised that you cannot bomb or coerce more than one million British citizens into a united Ireland <#> I think the great fear within Unionism at the moment is based solely <,> solely on their position <,> their constitutional position within the United Kingdom <#> Tragically we 've been excluded consistently from any involvement in discussions relating to what 's happening in Northern Ireland <#> John Major talks to Albert Reynolds <,> Albert Reynolds to John Hume <,> John Hume to Gerry Adams <#> And indeed any permutation of the four <#> Tragically when people speak behind closed doors about you <,> and you 're not invited to attend <,> you 'd not even made aware of what happens afterwards <,> then it is reasonable to assume it 's not in your best interests<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> So there 's clear mistrust there <,> but again the question is<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Clear mistrust<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> I would have said that was an understatement<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> Sure <#> But the question is what about the Loyalist terror groups <,> the UVF the UFF <#> How are they likely to respond to this ceasefire<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> I think it isn't a question of response to this ceasefire <#> I think that there <,> that it is <,> for public record that they have said consistently that if the IRA stopped they would stop <#> But uh unfortunately it isn't quite as simple as that <#> They have also uhm I think last year uh given a list of of six principles <,> the first and foremost of which was that there should be no dilution of Northern Ireland 's position as a a partner within the United Kingdom <#> Now tragically <,> Unionist perception is that there could be a notion of dilution <#> Uh this this government has hardly behaved exceptionally towards Unionism and tragically they 're now paying the price because these people don't really believe them <#> And somehow <,> they 're going to have to convince Unionists that they 're safe in their constitutional position<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> And if they did that<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> I think it would stop<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> If the Loyalists terrorist groups were convinced that the constitutional issue was not up for grabs <,> that Northern Ireland stays part of the United Kingdom until the majority decide otherwise<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Uh hm<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> Loyalist terrorism will stop<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> I think so <#> Yes <#> I I think that the uhm in the best interests of their people uhm they would stop <#> <.> I </.> <.> im </.> it 's important that that people realise that the Loyalist paramilitaries have never put any uh proviso on the IRA stopping <#> Indeed they 've called often for the IRA to stop and we will stop <#> But essentially <,> it must be within the parameters of a United Kingdom<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> The Anglo-Irish Agreement made it clear <,> the Downing Street Declaration makes it clear <,> John Major repeatedly makes it clear that nothing will happen without the consent of the majority <#> So what does he have to do to overcome the mistrust<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> But whom did they make it clear to<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> Public statements<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Mm <#> The problem with that Mike would be that <,> huh <,> the Unionist population have heard our Prime Minister speak that he would be sick to the pit of his stomach at the thought of speaking to the IRA <#> In a matter of days he had to admit that his government were speaking to the IRA <#> I 've already alluded to the fact that we have consistently been left out of the political argument in Northern Ireland <#> It is only lately that this new grand committee has stopped the totally undemocratic policy of order in council <#> We 're a <,> a disenfranchised alienated people who have a right to exist with our culture and our ethos intact and we have a right to our nationality <#> It ill becomes anyone to expect me or anybody like me to dilute my nationality to bolster someone else 's <#> This is a nationality question <#> I am British <,> the people out there are British and wish to remain so <#> And I might point out that they 're not all Protestants<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> But are these people <,> and they would be largely viewed as Loyalists <,> now what Nationalists were twenty-five years ago <#> Out in the cold <,> disenfranchised <,> disillusioned<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Fair point <#> It 's a fair point <#> I won't deny that there were ills of the past <#> Ills carried out by the few in the name of the many <#> Those ills have gone <#> I say now quite simply that to elevate one section of our community above another will not work and there is historical proof to suggest that it will not work<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> But do we have a Catch Twenty-two situation in that you are saying it is up to the Prime Minister to convince us but we don't trust the Prime Minister<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> Well there is a problem there <#> I think that that can be got round <#> I think that certainly uh if this British government are telling the truth uh Unionism will be quick to pick it up<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$A> <#> How are they going to do that <#> Who are they going to look to to convince them there is fear there 's uncertainty in the Unionist stroke Loyalist community <#> They look not to a leader but to leaders who are giving out very different signals <#> Very different signals<ICE-IRE:S2B-001$F> <#> I accept that I appreciate that <#> Uh whatever signals they 're giving and uh Jim Molyneaux 's comments on Monday might be <.> in </.> indicative of the fact that even moderate Unionists can be angry when they see the triumphalism and the arrogance of Nationalism <#> I I suggest to you that John Major might consider summoning the two Loyalists leaders and attempting to convince them <#> And since their positions are so diverse that if he can convince them I 'm fairly certain that they can convince the Unionist population</I>
