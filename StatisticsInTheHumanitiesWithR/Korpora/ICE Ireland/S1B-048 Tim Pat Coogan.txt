<ICE-IRE:S1B-048 Tim Pat Coogan><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> The first <,> couple of volumes I see here on your shelves are well-battered and indeed well-read volumes <#> Two volumes <,> Michael Collins and The Making of a New Ireland by Pearse Be/aslai/ <#> Michael Collins is somebody who 's had a very profound impact on your life and on your work as a historian<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> Indeed and so had Pearse Be/aslai/ <#> Uhm <,> I 'd heard a lot about Collins from older colleagues of my father 's notably David Nelligan and other people over the years <#> Mickey Rooney <,> the former editor of The Independent told me about uhm <,> this extraordinary episode when uh he was called to the governor 's uh wing in uh Crumlin Road Gaol where he was imprisoned <#> And of course the division the <#> <.> Ci </.> the Civil War was on <,> the division 'd occurred there too <,> and he was uhm <,,> brought in by the governor to be told something <#> And the news was that Collins had been shot <#> So he came back out onto the uh gangplank or onto the <,> iron <,> staircase whatever it was <,> and uh he began to announce this to his people <,> and he was interrupted by the sound of the rosary <#> They all went down simultaneously on their knees <,> both Free Staters and uh <,> uh Republicans in Crumlin Road Gaol <#> And the same thing <,> the same story or a variation of it was told by Tom Barry <,> so he had that sort of mesmeric effect <#> But uh that particular volume you see there those two <,,> it 's a famous edition <,> <#> And I first came across it when I was uh writing my first book Ireland Since the Rising back in nineteen sixty-five <#> And I 'd left the Evening Press uh <,> we started early and you finished about four in the afternoon <,> and sometime of that <,> order I went up to the National Library <,> uh got these out <,> uh on my reading list <,> and settled in to read them <#> And I meant to get uh go <,> break and have a cup a cup of tea <#> And uh I was touched on the the shoulder <,> by this stage I was nearly through the first of the big books <,> by one of the attendants whom I knew <#> And I said oh thanks very much <#> I I meant to go out and get my tea <#> I <,> thanks very much <#> Keep an eye on them <#> I 'll be back <#> He said you will not <#> We 're closing <#> It 's ten o'clock <&> laughter </&> <#> It was a quarter to ten<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> You were so absorbed<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> I was completely absorbed and then I wanted to buy the books myself <#> They were very hard to get <,> <#> And the late Tom Kenny <,> it was a great uh bookshop as you know in Galway <,> great great book family <#> And Maureen I 'm happy to say is still with us <,> the wife <#> But he looked out for them and he got them for me for ten pounds <#> People used to say Kenny 's are very dear <#> He got those two for me for ten pounds <,> <#> And I think they 're <,> well you 'd pay according to the catalogues well in excess of a hundred now for that edition anywhere<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> I see beside it uh <,> The Love Poems of Yeats<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> Oh yes uh <,> yes well I I I 've always been interested in uh <.> i </.> in Yeats of course <#> Uhm <,> and uh it 's kind of a long story <#> Uh you also see here uhm Nothing Happens in Carmincross by Ben Kiely <#> Uh now I <.> hap </.> I uh <,> launched that for Ben in <,> again it was under the auspice of Kenny 's if not mistaken <,> uh uh in Galway <#> And uhm <,,> as I said at the time Nothing Happens in Carmincross <,> what a misnomer <,> quite a lot happens <#> Well quite a lot happened that night I can tell you <&> laughter </&> as a result <,> <#> But I also uh went along then to the uhm <,> the launch of the paperback a year later where I uh met a uh my friend <,> Barbara Haley for the first time your your former colleague too used to uh appear with you a lot in the Arts programme <#> And she was particularly friendly with uhm Norman Jeffares <.> Ge </.> Gerry Jeffares whom I hadn't met though I 'd admired him from a distance introduced him to me <,> <#> And uh he rekindled my interest in Yeats because I thought that his uhm <,> that edition he did the collected edition he did for Macmillan was about the best introduction anybody could have to Yeats <#> Not alone did he 've a good selection <,> for anybody but his uh notes at the back uh <,> a lot of people don't read a book in the totality but uh because they 're just dry small print <,> but he had marvellously illuminating notes <,> everything from the pronunciation of words <,> to the local typography <,> to bits of history <,> to who the characters were <#> I thought it was a model book <#> <,> And uhm <,> it just it happens to be one of the the model poems if you like<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> Are there a few lines of <{> <[> Yeats that that particularly strike you </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[> Yes a from a </[> </{> Last Confession <,,> <#> <quote> I gave what other women gave that stepped out of their clothes <,> but when this soul its body off naked to naked goes <,> he it is found shall find therein <,> what none other knows </quote><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> Talking of poetry you 're a big fan of Seamus Heaney <#> <{> <[> And I see his early volume Field Work here on your shelves </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[> Oh yes of course <,,> <#> Yes <,,> </[> </{> <#> Well uh Seamus of course is is a wonderful man <#> He 's a wonderful poet <#> Uh <,> he writes about things uh that we we sort of can identify with <#> But uh apart from that he uhm <,,> he is uhm <,> blessed with his personality <#> He he 's a very pleasant man and uh very enabling man <#> He gives his time very generously <,> and he 's no poseur <,> <#> He 's also a very lucky man I think in a sense that <,> apart from the fact he he 's a lovely wife <,> uh <,> Marie he 's uhm <,> born at a very good time <#> He uh he 's come to his maturity <,> in a very benign Ireland for the poet <#> If you consider the reception <,> that his work is met and his personality is met with in this Ireland <,> uhm compared to say the treatment of <,> or the kind of the expected behaviour of people like Kavanagh and uh Behan and Myles na Gopaleen <#> Uhm in a sense they were Ishmael <#> They certainly got no economic support or very little <#> They wrote for peanuts <#> And there was terrific drinking and self-destruction <#> Uh uhm <,,> it 's amazing Kavanagh lived as long as he did <#> Uh you know <,> the artist destroyed by Dublin is kind of the leitmotif that one sees so many of these people from Seamus O'Sullivan uh you just think of them <#> But Seamus escaped all that <,> uh takes a drink and all that <#> So I I think he 's just he 's a good model of of what uhm <,> what uh <,> Yeats said to Irish poets <quote> scorn uh scorn uh <,> <.> th </.> things all growing up and Irish poets learn your trade </quote> <#> Well he certainly did that <,> he learnt his trade you know <#> Uhm <#> Here 's here 's a thing uh he he do you know the the uh Casualty <,> <#> It 's he uh it 's about Northern Ireland <,> and he describes the uhm <,,> uhm <,,> Derry and the the <.> thirt </.> remember that terrible shooting in Derry the Bloody Sunday <,> Paras thirteen the wall said Bogside nil <#> And then uhm <,> the other thing was that of course there was great hatred of anybody who had seemed to give aid or support to the troops <#> And this man uh didn't uhm <,> uh <,,> he he wouldn't sort of give in to the threats to stay home <#> It 's just the the other side the Seamus 's insight into both senses <,> both sides of the terror <#> Uh he <.> t </.> talks about this man who defied his own people to go out <#> And he said <,> <quote> but he would not be held at home by his own crowd whatever threats were phoned whatever black flags waved <#> I see him as he turned in that bombed offending place <,> remorse fused with terror <,> in his still knowable face <#> His cornered out-face stare <,> blinding in the flash </quote> <#> It is just <,> he he 's a man of considerable insight in other words<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> As a former editor and uh long-time journalist I know that you 've a great admiration of Alistair Cooke <#> And I see his volume The Americans <,> Letters From America nineteen sixty-nine to seventy-nine on your shelves <,> <#> <{1> <[1> Cooke </[1> is an extraordinary <{2> <[2> character </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[2> He 's an extraordinary man </[2> </{2> <#> He 's uhm <,> I suspect he grew up as something of a snob <,> <#> Uh he was uhm <,> he was always at the very best tables and uh <,> married an admiral 's daughter and that sort of thing <#> Uh had entree from uh very high level and in those days <,> well it 's still <,> to a large extent the style of England is the style of America but very much more so in his time <#> But instead of just degenerating in to gossip with that <,> he became probably the most penetrating critic and uh affectionate uh <,> reporter on America <.> th </.> that uh <,> well of his day <#> And I don't know whether you 've read his other book the uhm it 's just called Alistair Cooke 's America <#> And it really is it 's full of insight <#> And he he 's ranging from little anecdotes about old people he knows living in the Twinkle Toes Sandy Motel <&> laughs </&> to <,> you know <,> meetings with President Kennedy and so forth <#> And he has something that of course uhm <,> is is essential for any journalist <#> Energy <,> accuracy <,> and great professionalism <,> a sense of humour so <,> I <.> w </.> I would certainly commend him to the the younger school<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> He 's also kept alive <,> that endangered species the radio essay <#> <{> <[> Hasn't he </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[> Absolutely </[> </{> <.> abso </.> I mean the uhm <,> the Sunday Morning Letter From America now it 's wonderful <#> And if you follow him through he starts off uhm <,> I I want to tell you today about a man <,> but first let me say <,> and you go off for fourteen minutes and the last thirty seconds 're <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> up and suddenly the last uh <,> sentence would be and that was the man who was shot dead before my very eyes or something like that <,> you know <#> And he he <{> <[> really is <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> <[> He has an </[> </{> extraordinary sense of <{1> <[1> completeness </[1> and coming round <{2> <[2> to <,> </[2> a conclusion <.> wh </.> and taking you <,> almost in a way like Ben Kiely<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[2> Absolutely </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> I was going to say <,> you took the words out of my mouth <&> laughter </&> <#> He 's the he 's the uhm <,> the transatlantic equivalent of Ben because Ben goes in a circumlocutory way all around the Lagan Valley <,> and he finally comes back to closing time in Mulligan 's where the anecdote began <#> And he also remembers the punchline <#> And of course he also has a wonderful radio voice <,> <#> And he 's also a a was a very fine journalist and is a very fine writer<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> A man you knew well in your Irish Press days was Brendan Behan <{> <[> and you have his </[> complete plays here <,> uh introduced by Alan Simpson<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> <[> Oh I did yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$A> <#> Uhm <,> it 's so difficult now to separate Behan the man from the myth isn't it<ICE-IRE:S1B-048$B> <#> It 's very hard <#> I mean he would certainly be one of the artist destroyed figures <#> You know uh he felt the headlong rush was the only thing <#> He had to psych himself up very often I think <,> uh for appearances you know <#> And the way to do that is to be drunk uh <,> you know <,> interrupting plays in the West End shouting from this the audience <#> This brought headlines in the Daily Mail and that brought box office <#> And then he uhm <,,> it went on from there you know <#> He made very penetrating remarks <#> Well I remember Judith Crist who was then the editor of the Arts in the uhm <,> Herald Tribune saying to me that uh <,> she thought what he said about the uh Saint Patrick 's Day uh <.> pro </.> procession was perfectly spot on and should be said <,> namely that it wasn't an Irish festival <,> that it was uh a show of strength for the <.> anci </.> Ancient Order of Hibernians <#> Now I don't agree with that <,> but however <,> that 's what Judith felt <#> And uh she said then paused <,> but he shouldn't 've been drunk when he said it <&> laughter </&></I>
