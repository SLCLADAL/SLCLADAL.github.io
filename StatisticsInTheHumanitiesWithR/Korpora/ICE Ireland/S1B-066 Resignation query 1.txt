<ICE-IRE:S1B-066 Resignation query 1><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$Y> <X> Derek McDowell of Labour asked Mr Russell how he had come to his conclusion that became included in Mr Whelehan 's report to the Government that there was nothing to suggest that Father Smyth 's offences were continuing or were likely to continue either here or in Northern Ireland </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Because the facts given to us by the United Kingdom authorities showed <,> that the offences had ceased <,,> in periods or at periods ranging from twenty-two years to six years previously <#> The offences had been committed in regard to a single extended family <#> They did not involve strangers <,> and they had ceased six years before<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$B> <#> There there seemed to be a suggestion <,> it doesn't appear in that paragraph <,> but there seemed to be a suggestion that because uh Father Smyth was then resident in County Cavan in a monastery in County Cavan that uh he therefore felt that it was <.> mu </.> less urgent as well <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Yes <,> that 's there also<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$B> <#> Uhm why did you conclude that<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Why did I<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Because <,> although I know nothing about Kilnacrott Abbey <,> the title <,> suggests to me a closed institution <,> or an institution where the people uh who uh reside there are not <,,> are not at large to to to <.> u </.> use to use <,> I 'm sure if I if I paused longer I could think of a better expression than that but uh to I would distinguish uh uh uh clergymen who live in an abbey or a monastery uh from clergymen who live in the community <#> That is my point<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$B> <#> Right <#> You see <.> i </.> <.> i </.> it has given rise to some comment that because of the fact that he was a priest that you felt it was less urgent<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> No uhm <,> I knew he was a priest apart from his address because the information given to us said so <#> I was not relying on the address for that for that uh for that point <#> I thought in fact he was a monk <,> since he lived in an abbey<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$Y> <X> Deputy Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats came back to the issue of the RUC 's interview notes which record Father Brendan Smyth 's admission of guilt for certain offences </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> Were the notes taken by the RUC officers which you refer to and distinguish from a confession <,> were they uh detailed notes of interviews by those officers with Father Smyth<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I have no idea<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> Have you ever seen them<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> No <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> Well does it follow from that that uhm that uh the nature of <,> the the confessional nature of the evidence that was available or referred to in the submission that was made to the Attorney General 's office <,> that uh no no-one was in a position in the Attorney General 's office to <,> to work out from the papers that were submitted to them <.> wha </.> uhm to what extent these were sketchy admissions or detailed admissions made to the RUC officers<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I think that would be a a a fair statement of the situation<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> Well doesn't it follow from that Mr Russell again <,> that if you were going to consider the issue of delay that the recollection of Father Smyth and the detail of his confession if there was a confession made <,> would be central to a decision as to whether uh time <,> the elapse of time or delay had uh prejudiced uhm uh would or could prejudice uh uhm him in a way that would make him unfair to extradite him<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> The work I was doing in the Smyth case was attempting to identify from the <,> I think I could fairly say almost multitude of reported previous decisions of the courts to identify some principles or common threads which could be applied once they had been identified to the facts of the Smyth case <{> <[> with a view </[> with a view to finding an answer to the request for extradition<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> <[> I appreciate that </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> Yes but uh I 'm asking you uh and I think it 's a fair point <,> and not a lawyer 's point only <,> that in order to arrive at a decision as to whether or not someone was prejudiced by the delay the very first thing you would have had to put your mind to was in the <.> ca </.> in the context of admissions <,> the quality and the nature and the detail of those admissions<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Well first I think it would be necessary to discover whether the courts regarded admissions in such a case as of major significance in deciding whether twenty-nine years was too long an interval of time<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> Well I appreciate the the the that uh legal research could go on at one hand but I 'm suggesting to you that the nature of the admissions was something which you would uh have uhm uh oh very <,> it would be something to which you would attach very heavy weight indeed <,> because if if these were a flowing account of abusing uh <.> s </.> children in this family in West Belfast uh in which in which uh there was full and frank disclosure <,> it could hardly be that the that the man could then say but I am prejudiced now uh by by the elapse of time since he wouldn't be in a position to deny it if the if the admissions were were were quoted<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> The courts have held in some cases that mere elapse of time without any demonstration of prejudice to the wanted person is enough to prohibit a trial<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> I can appreciate that but I 'm I 'm I 'm saying in this context I don't I don't <,> certainly I can't recollect any cases which uhm which tend to suggest that uhm that a court would regard uhm the issue of admission or no admission uh as not being the central issue on the question of delay<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Well are you aware I would <,> I am or perhaps you could tell me whether you are aware of any case in which in which the court has decided that that is the situation<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> No because because I don't believe that anybody <&> laughter </&> <,> and as if the Deputies if the Deputies would listen I don't I 'm not aware of any case where somebody <,> I 'm not aware of any case where somebody who has admitted to a series of sexual offences has ever uh come to a court and said but it 's too late now<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$Y> <X> Mr Russell agreed with Deputy McDowell that the Smyth case could have been dealt with in twenty-one days by someone who had no other work to do <#> He also agreed that the substantive cause of delay was due to administrative overload in his office and not to the novelty and complexity of the case </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> The legal point was important and novel <,> and it <.> s </.> struck me that it was the sort of matter which I should deal with <,,> by reason of its novelty and importance<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> Yes but is it not the case that the <,> the vast the vast bulk of the delay that occurred in this case must be attributed not to the complexity of the point which you decided to deal with personally but to your other duties <{> <[> which </[> distracted you from that<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> <[> Yes indeed </[> </{> <,> <#> Certainly<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> And uhm I have to suggest to you that uh in that context uh it uhm to say that uh to give to render as an excuse in public <,> which you didn't <,> but others have done that uh that this was the first case in which delay had <.> ari </.> has arisen uh didn't do justice to the situation because the the the the the <.> cau </.> the the substantive cause of the delay was uhm the uh the uh administrative overload on you and your officers<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Well uhm certainly the huge volume of work which has to be done in the Attorney General 's office was a a very very significant factor in accounting <{1> <[1> for the delay </[1><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$C> <#> <[1> But it was the </[1> </{1> <.> pre </.> it was the predominant cause in terms of time of the delay isn't that right<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I think probably that is the case<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$Y> <X> When questioned by Deputy Eamon Gilmore of Democratic Left Mr Russell repeated that the Smyth case was indeed an exceptional case in that it raised an exceptionally difficult point of law </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$D> <#> Did you at any time uhm mention the case to the Attorney General<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$D> <#> Why if it was an exceptional case did you not mention it to the Attorney General<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Because if I 'd told the Attorney General <,> there is a case which has come in which raises an exceptional point of law of great difficulty <,> there was every chance he 'd say to me what 's the answer <,> to to the question and I wouldn't be able to tell him <#> That sort of conversation with an Attorney General is a fruitless one <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$Y> <X> Deputy Gilmore later said he was surprised that Mr Russell could have had various discussions with the Attorney General about extradition matters generally and extradition legislation in particular without mentioning one exceptionally difficult case <,> namely the Father Brendan Smyth case </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I 'm not at all surprised<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$D> <#> Well I <,> I 'll put it to you Mr Russell that uhm the average citizen may well be surprised that uh here the is the uhm officer who has statutory responsibility for extradition <,> the officer of his office who has the sole responsibility for dealing with it <,> having a number of conversations and discussions about extradition <,> you have a problematic case and you never mention it to him<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> The discussions were as I say on the legislation <,> the particular case <,> involving this particularly difficult question of law as I saw it and as I still see it <,> was not relevant to the legislation <#> If I raised the uhm fact that I had a difficult case on hands <,> he might very well have said to me <,> <.> we </.> well what is the solution to this case and as I 've said already I wasn't in a position to answer that question <,> therefore I didn't see much point in in raising it with him<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$X> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$Y> <X> Deputy Willie O'Dea opened his questions to Mr Russell by asking him how long he had been dealing with extradition law in the Attorney General 's office <#> Mr Russell replied he thought that ten or fifteen years <#> He agreed with Mr O'Dea that he was the official who deals with the vast majority of extradition cases <#> Mr O'Dea then pursued a line of questioning on Mr Russell 's experience in the teaching of law </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Were you ever involved in the teaching of law<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I was<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> In what capacity<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I <.> wa </.> was a member of the staff of the Law School of Trinity College<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Uhm I 've been informed <,> please correct me if I 'm wrong <,> that you were actually a Reid Professor of Law at Trinity College <#> <{> <[> Is that correct </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> <[> Yes I was </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Uh what what <,> on what basis do Trinity College appoint somebody as Reid Professor<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I would like to think merit<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> What age were you at the time <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Roughly<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Thirty-three I think<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> So <,> apart from uh Mrs Robinson you must have been one of the youngest <.> profes </.> Reid Professors of of of criminal law at Trinity College<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$Y> <X> Mr Russell agreed with Mr O'Dea that his client presented with a diametrically opposed view by two eminent lawyers would be left confused </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> The fact that there was conflict between <,> conflict of legal opinion between yourself and Mr Fitzsimons was conveyed to the Taoiseach and the Government on Monday the fourteenth of November <#> Uh isn't it natural that they would be confused since they 'd be in the same position as as as the client we 've just mentioned<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> I I suppose so <,> yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> So <,> in determining how the sub-section <,> should be should be applied uh in the Smyth case it it was and is your view very definite view that the Duggan case is not a conclusive precedent in fact not a precedent at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> It 's not a precedent at all and it gives no assistance whatever in resolving the problem of the twenty-nine year case<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> In fact you have described it as as <,> peripheral <,> unimportant <,> insignificant<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> These words which are not intended to cast any <{> <[> any any </[> aspersions on the work of the officer who dealt with that case are are accurate I think uh simply because the issue didn't arise in a three and a half year case uh there was another factor also in it uh which I 've mentioned in in in my statement uh <,> and uh the it was not necessary for the officer to deal with the question<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> <[> Yes I accept that </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Now in view of the doubt and confusion and conflicting legal opinion <,> uhm <,> wouldn't the Taoiseach and his ministers have been justified in seeking and waiting for a definitive view on the matter <,> before the Taoiseach goes in to address the Da/il<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Certainly if if if if the Government is ever confused about a a a legal question they should uhm clarify their minds before they embark on public utterances <.> th </.> that is if I may be permitted to appear to offer advice to the Government which of course is not my intention<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Advice is most welcome <#> And uh it would be it would be wise to get that definitive opinion in writing wouldn't it<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$A> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-066$E> <#> Uh in other words if the Taoiseach had simply gone into the Da/il on the Tuesday <,> knowing about the Duggan case <,> and referred to the matter in a simplified way that it was a precedent and that there was no need <,> uh that this explanation for the delay didn't carry any weight because the matter <,> the legal matter had been considered in depth before in the Duggan case <,> wouldn't he be misleading the Da/il in effect</I>
