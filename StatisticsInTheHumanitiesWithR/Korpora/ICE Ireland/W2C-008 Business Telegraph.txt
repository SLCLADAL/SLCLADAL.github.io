<W2C-008 Business Telegraph><I><W2C-008$A><h> <#> 'Privatisation hikes energy costs' <#> Maurice Neill </h><p> <#> A senior industrialist today attacked rising energy costs and blamed the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity. </p><p> <#> Michael McVeigh, works director of the 25-year-old Hoechst chemical plant in Limavady, said the price of power has put new pressure on vulnerable companies. </p><p> <#> The German-based Hoechst reported a massive loss last week and warned of a new round of international cost cutting. </p><p> <#> Neighbouring Du Pont in Londonderry has already trimmed its workforce as recession sweeps the European chemical giants. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We are struggling to maintain profitability in the middle of a deep recession and yet face a rise in energy costs of as much as 17pc," </quote> said Michael McVeigh. </p><p> <quote> <#> "This kind of increase is simply unacceptable," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> The plant, one of the province 's 20 largest energy consumers, employs 320 producing polyester yarns mainly for the European clothing industry. <#> It pays a power bill of around <*> pound sign </*> 1.25 m a year. </p><p> <#> The Confederation of British Industry here warned Government Northern Ireland already has some of the highest energy costs in Europe but failed to win any safety guarantees pre-privatisation. </p><p> <#> Frank Irvine NIE energy marketing manager said: <quote> "Excluding rises in fuel costs electricity prices in 1994/95 are expected to rise in line with inflation." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-008$B><h> <#> 'Bid-peddling' slammed <#> Yvette Shapiro </h><p> <#> RECOVERY in the Northern Ireland construction sector will not occur until tender bids return to <quote> "realistic" </quote> levels, a building industry chief warned today. </p><p> <#> Gordon Burnison, director of the Construction Employers Federation in the province, said the organisation 's latest quarterly survey revealed serious concerns about pricing of contracts. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Tender prices are still too low and, in order for firms to win contracts, they are being forced to offer unrealistic prices." </quote> </p><p> <#> In May, the Housing Executive revealed that some firms were building houses at a loss because they were so desperate for business. </p><p> <#> Earlier in the year, the Northern Ireland branch of the Confederation of Specialist Engineering Contractors claimed that <quote> "bid-peddling" </quote> was making a mockery of the tendering process and was damaging to the entire construction industry. </p><p> <#> Low pricing is putting pressure on a sector which is currently struggling to climb our of recession, according to the Construction Employers Federation survey which shows workload levels down in almost every area of activity. </p><p> <#> The results are disappointing, since a survey earlier in the year reflected more "positive trends" and predicted an improvement in volumes by now. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Demand has flattened in recent months and the recovery anticipated earlier in the year has not been sustained," </quote> said Mr Burnison. </p><p> <#> Unemployment levels, which fell earlier in the year, are now climbing again: around 18,400 construction workers are currently on the dole. </p><p> <#> Despite the current gloomy situation, the Federation is optimistic for the second half of the year. </p></I><I><W2C-008$C><h> <#> Parker for Babcock </h><p> <#> Harland and Wolff 's outgoing chairman, John Parker, is likely to take over as chief executive of Babcock International, the UK-based engineering company headed by Lord King. </p><p> <#> Announcing Mr Parker 's resignation last week, the shipyard would only say that he was going to join an un-named <quote> "major international group" </quote> . </p><p> <#> But weekend newspaper reports, backed up by senior industry sources, suggest that the popular shipyard boss will join Babcock in October. </p><p> <#> The Buckinghamshire-based company builds and equips power stations all over the world and, as a joint venture partner in Babcock-Thorn, manages the Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland on behalf of the Government. </p><p> <#> It is this Rosyth connection which makes Mr Parker an ideal candidate for the top job at Babcock. <#> His success in guiding Belfast Shipyard through privatisation and keeping it afloat during the worst recession in the ship-building trade has won him respect throughout the industry worldwide. </p><p> <#> If his appointment at Babcock is confirmed, Mr Parker will replace Oliver Whitehead, who left the company in May. </p></I><I><W2C-008$D><h> <#> Words of wisdom - at <*> pound sign </*> 200 a day <#> Robin Morton </h><p> <bold> <#> Several big names are being lined up for the Northern Ireland conference circuit this autumn - and businessmen will pay more than <*> pound sign </*> 200 a day to hear their words of wisdom. </bold> </p><p> <#> Sir John Harvey Jones, the former ICI chairman, known to television audiences for his Troubleshooter series, is to be at the rostrum at the Slieve Donard Hotel in Newcastle next week. </p><p> <#> The man who turned a loss into a <*> pound sign </*> 1bn profit in 30 months will be addressing the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy conference. </p><p> <#> Also addressing the conference will be Sir John Banhanm, the former director general of the Confederation of British Industry, and current chairman of the Local Government Commission for England. </p><p> <#> The three-day CIPFA conference, which starts next Wednesday, is entitled "Preparing to Win - Northern Ireland in Partnership". </p><p> <#> Billy Little, CIPFA 's manager in Northern Ireland, said the event would have a wide appeal to those in business, as well as their public sector counterparts. </p><p> <#> The subjects covered will range from the Northern Ireland economy and compulsory competitive tendering to how to manage your bank manager. <#> The aim is to show how the private and public sectors can work in tandem. </p><p> <#> Delegates taking part in the full programme and staying in the hotel are paying <*> pound sign </*> 499 a head, while tickets for the star speaker day (Thursday) are <*> pound sign </*> 235. </p><p> <#> The two Sir Johns will be delivering keynote addresses and then taking part in a question and answer session with delegates. </p><p> <#> CIPFA said the main conference, which includes workshops and training sessions, had attracted more than 300 delegates, and around 400 had booked for the Thursday. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile, plans were unveiled today for the Growing a Green Economy conference at the Balmoral Conference Centre in Belfast on Wednesday October 27. </p><p> <#> The one-day event is the first fruits of the Green Economy Working Group which was set up earlier this year by Robert Atkins. </p><p> <#> The impetus for the conference has come from current reforms in environmental legislation. <#> The speakers will show how the development of the green market can create opportunities for local businesses. </p><p> <#> Speakers will include Jerry Rendell, chief executive of the UK Ecolabelling Board, Shane Molloy, managing director of Lever Ireland, and Hilary Thompson, head of NatWest 's environmental management unit. </p><p> <#> Tickets cost <*> pound sign </*> 75, and Robin Dixon, chairman of the working group, said the event would be a turning point for local business and its understanding of the environmental challenge. </p><p> <#> Also in October, the Training and Employment Agency is organising an afternoon seminar for chief executives on the subject of "The Virtual Corporation", an American system whereby companies can develop through subsidiary businesses. </p><p> <#> The event, on Thursday October 14, at the Slieve Donard Hotel, and the main speaker is Dr Roger Nagel from Lehigh University U.S.A. - tickets free. </p></I><I><W2C-008$E><h> <#> Batting for Northern Ireland </h><p> <#> The Northern Ireland Partnership was set up by the Industrial Development Board in October 1983. <#> Its first co-ordinator was Dr George Chambers, former chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board. </p><p> <#> It is an international voluntary network of 850 business and professional people in Britain, the Continent, the United States, Canada and the Far East. </p><p> <#> Some members are Ulster expatriates who have made the grade overseas. <#> Others are business executives who have associations with the province, perhaps through education or family links. </p><p> <#> The Partnership 's primary aim is to encourage inward investment in the province. <#> But more recently the emphasis has been on improving export potential for companies in the province. </p><p> <#> Another aim is to counter bad publicity for Northern Ireland by emphasising the positive side of the province. </p><p> <#> Members of the partnership have given a helping hand to several industrialists who have been attracted to the province. </p><p> <#> One example is the automotive components plant set up by Ryobi at Carrickfergus. <#> An Ulster academic based in the US urged the head of the Japanese company to consider Northern Ireland as a location. </p><p> <#> Last year, the Belfast based mechanical and electrical engineers Rotary International secured a substantial contract in Japan thanks to a contact made by the Partnership. </p><I></I><W2C-008$F><h> <#> Sutherland on mission to end talks deadlock <#> Business Telegraph reporter </h><p> <#> World trade negotiator Peter Sutherland is in Paris today in a bid to stop the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement of Tariff and Trade talks slipping backwards to the deadlock of a year ago. </p><p> <#> The Irish diplomat must win new concessions from the hardline French government if he is to meet a deadline for a deal in December. </p><p> <#> The fate of Northern Ireland 's two most important industries, textiles and agriculture, depend on the outcome of the talks, now almost two years behind schedule. </p><p> <#> The textile and clothing industry, which employs 28,000 here, is under renewed pressure from exporters in the developing world and is seeking a new set of rules to be agreed at the GATT table. </p><p> <#> The province 's <*> pound sign </*> 1.5bn agriculture and food industry will be offered new markets if the French will agree to endorse last year 's Blair House agreement cutting subsidies to EC farmers. </p><p> <#> France, Europe 's largest exporter of food, is under pressure from a powerful farm lobby but remains the only obstacle to an agreement on agriculture and GATT progress. </p><p> <#> The Northern Ireland Textiles Association has repeatedly called for a swift conclusion to the talks process to safeguard jobs and businesses here. <#> Uncertainty has thrown a questionmark over investment in both textiles and food processing. </p><p> <#> Said GATT chairman Peter Sutherland: <quote> "If we don't have a Uruguay Round you can forget talk of a new world order in the post-Iron Curtain Age." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-008$G><h> <#> Picking a way through the mortgage minefield <#> Anthony Swanston </h><p> <bold> <#> MORTGAGES have always been a minefield, but never more so than now. </bold> </p><p> <#> With constant downward pressure on interest rates lending competition really is hotting up. <#> It is interesting that in Great Britain one of the most aggressive mortgage lenders is Bank of Ireland. </p><p> <#> It is confusing that the deals on offer in Great Britain are not always available here. <#> So let us look at the mortgage opportunities which exist and the points to watch out for. </p><p> <#> 1: By locking into a fixed rate now you may not be absolutely at the bottom of the market, but you cannot be far from it. </p><p> <#> Better to get in too soon than miss out completely - there is always the possibility that between application and completion the rate will reduce again. </p><p> <#> 2: For those running business overdrafts or commercial mortgages which have, typically, higher interest rates, look again at the possibility of shifting all or some of this debt into your domestic mortgage where the rate could be considerably less. </p><p> <#> 3: With Business Expansion Schemes which offer assured exits and projected returns in the region of 14pc, it seems almost crazy not to take a five year fixed loan at under eight per cent to finance the investment. </p><p> <#> 4: The many Northern Ireland people who have foreign loans on foreign properties - Algarve, Dordogne, Donegal, et al - consider now bringing these loans back into the UK secured against your main UK property - if your income is sterling based your debts should also be sterling based. </p><p> <#> Here are some important points to consider when rescheduling debt: </p><p> <#> 1: Be fully aware of the costs of changing your mortgage. <#> There will almost always be a survey fee and some legal fees. </p><p> <#> Obtain a realistic estimate in advance so that you will know what you are in for and therefore be able to calculate the relative merits of changing. </p><p> <#> 2: Many loans, particularly fixed rate loans, carry an arrangement fee. <#> Typically, this arrangement fee is not refundable - so if you change your mind about the whole affair or decide upon a different lender you will almost always lose the fee. </p><p> <#> 3: With repossessions and negative equity (more a feature in Great Britain than in Northern Ireland), lenders are taking a much more conservative view on valuations - the forced sale value of your property may be considerably less than the value you might have hoped for. </p><p> <#> 4: Once your borrowings exceed 75pc if the value of the property, you will probably have to bear the additional cost of a mortgage guarantee policy. </p><h> <#> Premiums </h><p> <#> Premiums vary enormously from lender to lender - adding this to the arrangement fee, survey fee and the legal costs can all mount up to a tidy sum. </p><p> <#> 5: Many loans are conditional upon other services or products being bought from the lending institution - watch out for conditional current accounts, property insurance, contents insurance and endowment policies. </p><p> <#> A good independent financial advisor should be able to present you with an accurate cost benefit analysis of changing your mortgage. </p><p> <#> If in changing the mortgage you are not transacting additional financial services business, such as new endowments or pensions, then you must expect the costs to be increased still further by your adviser 's fee. </p><p> <#> It seems clear that there might be another interest rate cut in the short term (Germans permitting) - it could be a last opportunity to lock in at these levels. </p></I>
