<W2D-002 Regulations><I><W2D-002$A><h> <#> Are you paying more tax then necessary? </h><p> <#> More than 28 million people in the United Kingdom are paying more tax than they need to. </p><p> <#> Last year alone, we handed over in excess of <*> pound sign </*> 5 billion to the Inland Revenue which could have been avoided if our affairs had been arranged more tax efficiently. </p><p> <#> Without this contribution, the Chancellor would have had to raise the basic rate to 26.5p to collect the same amount. </p><p> <#> This startling information was recently revealed in research commissioned by IFA Promotion Ltd. <#> Using the latest available Inland Revenue data, the report isolated almost <*> pound sign </*> 1 billion of tax paid in error; <*> pound sign </*> 1.3 billion which could have been easily avoided; and, over <*> pound sign </*> 3 billion which could have been saved by implementing rather more complex tax-saving strategies. </p><p> <#> The largest are of tax "waste" (over <*> pound sign </*> 5 billion) can be traced back to people not claiming their allowances. <#> Income which should fall within their tax-free allowance ends up being taxed. </p><p> <#> Waste occurs when married couples, with one partner earning more than the other, do not use their allowances to best effect. <#> If one spouse pays tax and the other doesn't, a switch of income into the non-taxpayers name would mean that the income would go from being taxed to tax-free. </p><p> <#> With the married couples allowance now fully transferable, higher earning wives can achieve a greater slice of tax-free income, while the widening of the 20 per cent tax band also offers scope for tax saving. </p><p> <#> Bank and building society accounts also provide fertile ground for tax waste. <#> Deposits with banks and buildings society are taxed, at source, at the 25 per cent rate. </p><p> <#> Those people paying tax at the 20 per cent rate can claim a refund of 5 per cent while non-taxpayers can ask for the interest to be paid gross. <#> But an estimated <*> pound sign </*> 360 million tax was paid last year by people who have either failed to register for gross interest or failed to reclaim the tax overpaid. </p><p> <#> A further <*> pound sign </*> 550 million could have been savvied if a greater number of banks and building society investors had made use of the Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (TESSA). <#> The TESSA allows savings (up to <*> pound sign </*> 3,000 in the first year and up to <*> pound sign </*> 9,000 over five years) to grow tax free as long as they are held for the full five year period. </p><p> <#> Shareholders, both those holding equities direct or via a unit trust or investment trust, are wasting an estimated <*> 750 </*> million in tax. </p><p> <#> A small part of this total results from non-taxpayers failing to reclaim the tax paid on their dividends, but the largest proportion stems from insufficient use being made of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP). </p><p> <#> The PEP allows up to <*> pound sign </*> 9,000 worth of equities to be held in a tax-free environment each year. <#> The savings in one year, while perhaps only marginal for the basic rate taxpayer, can mount up considerably over a period of time. </p><p> <#> The potential savings are obviously enhanced for the higher rate taxpayer. <#> And yet, of up to 13 million share or unit trust holders, some 9.9 million have no PEP at all. </p><p> <#> Please remember that the levels and bases of taxation can change. <#> The reliefs referred to are those that currently apply and the value of relief from taxation is dependent on individual circumstances. <#> In addition, you must bear in mind that the value of shares and units can fall as well as rise and the return may be less than the amount investment. </p><p> <#> Inheritance tax is a particularly nasty tax in that it is levied on assets which have been accumulated with income that has already been taxed. </p><p> <#> The one thing in its favour, however, is that by utilising wills, life policies, gifts and the annual exemptions available, its impact can be largely mitigated. </p><p> <#> Few people though, plan ahead for inheritance tax and, as a result the Inland Revenue takes in around <*> pound sign </*> 1.3 billion every year from this source. </p><p> <#> Another area of waste can be attributed simply to mistakes made by the Inland Revenue. </p><p> <#> There are by no means infallible, but too many people accept what the Revenue say <}> <-> the </-> <+> they </+> </}> owe without checking the figures. <#> Random checking by the Inland Revenue in 1992/93, in an effort to find tax fiddlers, revealed some <*> pound sign </*> 270 million of tax overpaid, but this is obviously just the tip of the iceberg. <#> A further <*> pound sign </*> 170 million could be saved if people declared all their income and paid their tax bills on time thereby avoiding penalties, which can be severe. </p><p> <#> Areas of potential tax savings abound. <#> There are still many people for whom it would be tax efficient to contract out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) while over <*> pound sign </*> 100 million could be saved by using the products of the Department for National Savings more effectively. </p><p> <#> The tax treatment of life assurance products, particularly friendly society policies, could again save more than <*> pound sign </*> 100 million per year. </p><p> <#> Nobody likes paying tax, so it makes sense to cut out as much of the waste as possible. <#> Impartial, independent financial advice from someone well versed in the tax planning field is essential if you are to make the most of the opportunities available. </p><p> <#>

Law (in Northern Ireland) </h><h> <#> What you should know </h><p> <#> Your health, safety and welfare at work are protected by law. <#> Your employer has a duty to protect you and to keep you informed about health and safety. <#> You have a responsibility to look after yourself and others. <#> If there is a problem, discuss it with your employer or your safety representative, if there is one. </p><p> <#> This leaflet is a brief guide to health and safety law. <#> It does not describe the law in detail, but it does list the key points. </p><p> <#> Your employer has a duty under the law to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, your health, safety and welfare at work. </p><p> <#> In general, your employer 's duties include: <#> - making your workplace safe and without risks to health; <#> - keeping dust, fume and noise under control;<#> - ensuring plant and machinery are safe and that safe systems of work are set and followed; <#> - ensuring articles and substances are moved, stored and used safely; <#> - providing adequate welfare facilities; <#> - giving you the information, instruction, training and supervision necessary for your health and safety. </p><p> <#> Your employer must also: <#> - draw up a health and safety policy statement if there are 5 or more employees, including the health and safety organisation and arrangements in force, and bring it to your attention; <#> - provide free, any protective clothing or equipment specifically required by health and safety law; <#> - report certain injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences to the enforcing authority; <#> - provide adequate first-aid facilities; <#> - consult a safety representative, if one is appointed by a recognised trade union, about matters affecting your health and safety; <#> - set up a safety committee if asked in writing by 2 or more safety representatives. </p><p> <#> Employers also have duties to take precautions against fire, provide adequate means of escape and means for fighting fire. </p><p> <#> In many workplaces employers may have other specific duties: <#> - to take adequate precautions against explosions of flammable dust or gas and when welding and soldering containers which have held an explosive or flammable substance; <#> - to maintain a workroom temperature of at least 16<*> degrees sign </*> C after the first hour of work where employees do most of their work sitting down; <#> - to keep the workplace clean; <#> - to provide, maintain and keep clean washing and toilet facilities and accommodation for clothing and to supply drinking water; <#> - to see that workrooms are not overcrowded and that they are well ventilated and lit; <#> - to ensure that floors, steps, stairs, ladders, passages and gangways are well constructed and maintained and not obstructed; <#> - to take special precautions before allowing employees to enter and work in a confined space; <#> - to ensure that employees do not have to lift, carry or move any load so heavy that it is likely to injure them; <#> - to guard securely all dangerous parts of machines; <#> - to see that employees, especially young people, are properly trained or under adequate supervision before using dangerous machines; <#> - to ensure that lifting equipment (hoists, lifts, chains, ropes, cranes and lifting tackle) and steam boilers, steam receivers and air receivers are well constructed, well maintained and examined at specified intervals; <#> - to give employees suitable eye protection or protective equipment for certain jobs; <#> - to take proper precautions to prevent employees being exposed to substances which may damage their health; <#> - to take precautions against danger from electrical equipment and radiation. </p><p> <#> As an employee, you have legal duties too. <#> They include: <#> - taking reasonable care for your own health and safety and that of others who may be affected by what you do or do not do; <#> - cooperating with your employer on health and safety; <#> - not interfering with or misusing anything provided for your health, safety and welfare. </p><p> <#> If you think there is a health and safety problem in your workplace you should first discuss it with your employer, supervisor or manager. <#> You may also wish to discuss it with your safety representative, if there is one. </p><p> <#> If the problem remains or you need more help, health and safety inspectors can give advice on how to comply with the law. <#> They also have powers to enforce it. <#> Your employer can give you their names and addresses. </p><p> <#> The Department of Economic Development 's Employment Medical Advisory Service can give advice on health at work and first-aid. <#> The address is: <#> Royston House, <#> 34 Upper Queen Street, <#> Belfast BT1 6FX. </p><p> <#> You can get advice on general fire precautions etc from the Fire Brigade or your fire officer. </p><p> <#> The main legislative provisions are contained in the Health and Safety at Work (Northern Ireland) Order 1978, but for particular purposes the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965, the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland)
