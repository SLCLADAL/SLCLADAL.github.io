<ICE-IRE:S2B-027 Video Diaries 2><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> Around the time that I was filming John <,> a man was shot dead in Derriaghy by the IPLO <,> who later apologised for killing an innocent man <#> Last night was a mistake the spokesman said <#> But last night was just murder <#> It was just death <#> That man is dead <#> That 's all he is <#> He 's not a victory or a defeat for anyone <#> He 's just a corpse <#> He wasn't the day before <#> And this is literally senseless <#> If you take time to think <,> you take time to think about what has happened everything in in you screams <,> in outrage <#> How can it have happened<&> news report of funeral </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> Belfast does its business again <#> Where is the mandate for murder here <#> Who benefited by last night <#> I dunno why it 's pissed me off so much but <,,> just what a waste of time <#> What a waste of more than time <#> What a waste of life <#> What a fatuous thing to say <#> It death renders <.> an </.> any comment ludicrous <#> He 's just dead<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$B> <#> There 's nothing I can say <,> nor would I seek to say anything which would excuse what what has happened in this community <#> There 'd be some dreadful acts of violence <,> which really in some ways are beyond my capacity to understand <#> I can't I can't understand how someone can take another person 's life in the callous way in which it 's happened here <#> And no ideology <,> no political hope can ever justify that <#> I think of yourself and myself who come from very similar social backgrounds <,> and there are many people from those backgrounds who have found themselves in the midst <,> of organisations on both sides of this community <,> who engage in acts of violence <,> and I 've often asked myself why I 'm not <,> one of those people <,> <#> Luck <#> Luck I think is probably yeah <#> Luck 's the answer I think <#> To do with choice <#> Things run your way at particular times in your life <#> You make the right choices <,> fate whatever intervenes <#> Others didn't have that luxury <,> didn't have that opportunity perhaps never wanted that opportunity <#> They 're now locked into something <,> which is just an ideology in its totality <,> and which is the justification for their existence and their lives and they can see nothing beyond that <#> That 's my explanation <&> music </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> People here complain that television focuses on the bad side of Belfast <#> And they 'll probably complain that I 'm doing the same thing <#> But I hope that the people I 've chosen to talk to <,> show something like the best side of Belfast <&> passers by calling and music </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$B> <#> I do like Belfast people <,> in spite of everything <#> There 's a warmth <,> uh there 's an acceptance and there 's something here which is just within me which I can identify with <#> The episodes <,> the more horrific episodes of violence inevitably <,> give me cause <,> for reflection <#> I 've just recently become a father <,> and I think <,> I 'll have at some point to make a decision as to whether or not I would want my own child <,> to grow up in a community where regrettably <,> there 's such a level of violence and there 's such an an unfortunate degree <,> of prejudice <#> And I think that would have to be acknowledged and said <#> It 's not true by any means of the majority of the people but it 's there <,> and it interferes in one 's life <,> and when you 've responsibility for another person 's life <,> it becomes that much more difficult to justify remaining<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> So we learn that the Berlin Wall is coming down <,> which is sensational news for all concerned <#> But meanwhile just up the road <,> I discover a new peace wall near the Whiterock separating Belfast 's working classes <,> another part of the maze of Belfast brick divisions <#> So while the world is pulling them down <,> Belfast is whacking them up at a great rate <#> And the thought occurs to you you don't want it to but it does <,> that some of the people must want this <,> otherwise why would it happen <#> They work hard at their divisions <#> They seem to yearn for confrontation <#> Unfraternity inequality illiberty <&> music </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$C> <#> I still see Northern Ireland as as relevant way beyond <,> Northern Ireland <#> I mean it it doesn't exist <,> within it 's like uh the border 's like a lasso thrown around the Six Counties and torn <#> You know it 's it 's something that stranglehold that uhm that Britain still has <,> upon us <#> I mean it it 's the the the vacuum that was created <,> within that border <,> political vacuum uh in which all the events in the last twenty years have taken place <#> I think it wasn't the creation of the people of Northern Ireland themselves Catholic or Protestant <#> It wasn't their sole doing <#> It 's far too easy to look at what 's going on here <,> and say this is a creation of sick minds and sick people <#> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> uh the atrocities that happen <,> lead to a a fairly understandable emotional reaction <#> But if you apply any sort of logic to this place at all you see that what 's going on <,> you can't see it as anything else other than the a bottleneck created by the traffic of history <#> And that 's English history too<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> How do you feel about sharing your city with people who murder on a regular basis<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$C> <#> Well they wouldn't be my favourite people to share a city with <#> But then what city doesn't have murder on a regular basis <#> I would <.> argu </.> you can't leave this city <#> I that 's a terrible question <#> I can't answer that <#> I just don't agree with that question at all <#> I do I don't agree with the question never mind the answer <{> <[> <,> <#> What </[> about what about people in London who murder on you know regular basis <#> The regular basis doesn't doesn't elevate it <#> You know we have whereas murder is murder is murder wherever it is<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> <[> Why not </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> There 's not so much<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$C> <#> Sorry<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> There 's not so much in London<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$C> <#> There 's not so much<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> In London<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$C> <#> No there 's not but then there 's not the there 's not the the historical situation that 's produced what we have here <#> I mean you can't on the one hand say that uhm <,> you know that that what is going on here is the bottleneck created by the traffic of history <,> and then say how do you feel about sharing a city with people who murder on a regular basis <#> I loathe it <#> I loathe it completely <#> But you can't just turn away from it <,> nor can you say that <,> we are innately <,> bound <,> to murder in this country <#> If you believed that you wouldn't live here <#> If you believed that you wouldn't write here<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$B> <#> And it looks like Glenn manages to both live here and write here with equal success <&> Glenn fixes drinks in the background </&> <#> Being with the bold Glenn Patterson was beginning to cheer me up <,> and also helping me with my film <&> music and background talking </&> <#> I was beginning to get a whole new slant on things <&> music and background talking </&> <#> Glenn was beginning to feel more comfortable in front of the camera <,> which was a good job since he was so useless behind it <&> music and background talking </&> <#> All in all I was feeling happier than usual to be in Belfast <#> It actually looked as though there were good times to be had after all <&> music and laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$C> <#> My greatest anger is not with Belfast or with people <,> who cause violence in Belfast <#> Uh uh a lot of I mean <,> <.> i </.> it it 's nothing new to say that a lot of the people who got involved in violence <,> uh who came from very similar backgrounds to you <,> and similar backgrounds to me on the other side when they were very young <,> and <,> it angers me to see <,> both the <.> wa </.> the waste of life of people who have been killed but also the waste of life of people who have been imprisoned <#> They 've been caught up <#> And what angers me and saddens me most about what has happened here is the fact that it was all so needless<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> Sociologists lament the psychological crisis of Belfast <#> It is a stressful habitat <#> Much of the casual violence and almost all of the prevalent drunkenness is the product of these subliminal stresses <#> Glenn and I were anxious to investigate <,> the drunkenness at least<&> Robert and Glenn drink and chat </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> What would have to happen here for you to leave<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$C> <#> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> for me to leave <#> Uh somebody give me sixty-seven quid and a two-week advance ticket <#> No <&> laughs </&> <#> What would happen <,> <.> wha </.> what would have to happen for me to leave <#> I don't think <,> I don't think you can actually say that there <,> you know that there 's anything <#> I mean who wants to predict <#> I wouldn't like to say it cos I would you know God knows it would probably happen <#> Something quite enormous <#> Well I mean what would what would have to happen you 're asking to make you abandon hope altogether <#> And I don't think you ever would <#> Uh you can't because <,> you short of us all evacuating the island <,> somebody 's going to be here <,> and somehow we 're going to have to work it out <#> And I 'd quite like to <,> to be part of the working out<&> Glenn and Robert chat the morning after </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> Most who live in Belfast try for optimism <#> Success is gauged by how easy optimism comes <#> And for Glenn it seems to come easier and more considered than most <&> background talk </&> <#> He seems to feel more affection for Belfast than me <#> Unlike me he believes that Belfast cannot be held entirely to blame <#> He looks elsewhere for fault <&> background talk </&> <#> Glenn Patterson truly loves his city <#> He 's an advocate for Belfast <#> He was almost beginning to persuade me in its favour<&> music </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> One of the reasons that so much of what is said about Belfast is so patently unreliable is the fact that Belfast is an incredibly confusing city <#> Uhm <,> depression is visible <#> I mean you see it on TV all the time <#> It 's easy to make Belfast look depressing <#> But also because euphoria lies idle in the streets <#> It 's everywhere <#> It 's so easy to pick up <#> Soon you 're you 're in a constant <,> state of choice <#> What am I going to be <&> music </&> <#> And this state of choice is an historic Irish characteristic <#> Usually the choice available has been despair and loss <#> However <,> for a brief time in nineteen seventy-six <,> Belfast achieved something like the state of euphoria with the birth of the Peace People <,> a movement which ignored religious boundaries and simply aimed for the achievement of peace <&> music </&> <#> The movement was led by Mairead Corrigan <,> Betty Williams and Ciaran McKeown <#> When the Peace People were destroyed by the suspicion and paranoia of politicians paramilitaries and press <,> it was these three figures who suffered the most vicious opprobrium <#> When I first met Ciaran McKeown I admit that I was to some degree infected with this disease of doubt <#> He 'd been the bogeyman of my childhood <,> the latest of the hate figures <#> I almost wanted to distrust him<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$D> <#> I sometimes think there is a generalised uh <,> low intensity depression afflicting people <,> which they only notice if they go away for a while and live in a a <.> some </.> somewhat freer or more open society and then come back <#> Uhm and they 're immediately aware of all the stresses all the uhm filtering <,> the automatic filtering that goes on all the time even among people who imagine themselves to be uh unbigoted <,> unprejudiced <,> uhm relatively liberated people <#> It 's a very inward <,> looking society in many ways <#> It 's and it 's really quite an unhealthy place<ICE-IRE:S2B-027$A> <#> Last night here in Sevastapol Street as we were leaving my Dad 's house <,> we saw a man being arrested arrested in inverted commas <#> It was by a selection of police army and plain clothes RUC men <#> They got the guy here near the bottom of the street and they ran him up the street to some jeeps waiting up at the top <#> And he had a gun held to his neck with the hammer cocked <,> running full pace up this street <#> And of all the things it looked like it looked most like a child being pulled along by the ear by <,> by a parent or a teacher <#> And the policeman 's colleagues were all out with the machine guns at safety catches off <#> There were kids all over the street <#> There were old people standing at the doors <#> It was terrifying <#> The the police were screaming in their own terror <#> It was just dreadful <#> I mean <,> it didn't look like a way to conduct police or state business <#> It looked like South Africa <#> It looked like Bolivia Chile <#> It looked like Northern Ireland</I>
