<ICE-IRE:S1A-035 Houses><I><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> You know I saw a house yesterday uhm you know down in Stormont<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Uh-huh<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> You know near <,> the front of Stormont <{1> <[1> <,> the </[1> Upper Newtownards Road <{2> <[2> <#> You </[2> know where the Stormont Hotel is<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Sort of <,> or do you not<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> I know where it is<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Right <#> And there 's a couple of streets there <#> There 's only two that are nice <#> But there 's some<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Two streets or two houses<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Two streets <#> Two streets that are quite nice <,> all with nice houses in them <#> And the one that I saw a house in was Castleview Road it 's <{1> <[1> called </[1> <#> And there 's another one beside it called uhm Knockburn Park or something like that and it 's my favourite they had nothing for sale <#> Castleview Road had two houses for sale <#> It was one <,> one of them was <,> uhm well they were both three-bedroomed semis but one of them was new and one of them was old <#> And the one that I liked best was an old <,> the older one <{2> <[2> <,> and </[2> I looked it up on the internet and it 's a hundred and ten thousand<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[1> Uh-huh </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[2> Uh-huh </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Oh very good<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Uhm <,> yeah three bedrooms <,> three bedrooms totally double-glazed <,> uh oil fired central heating and uh <,> what else did it have <#> That 's all I can remember <{> <[> actually of it </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[> Did it have </[> </{> a roof <#> A new roof<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Did it have a new roof<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Mm <,> it had a roof <#> Put it like that <#> I don't think it would have needed a new roof<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Why <#> What do you mean <#> If the roof isn't good <,> that 's like a very important part of any house you buy<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Is that right<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> I think the the roof is in in sound order<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Why are you taking the piss<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> I 'm not <#> Well why have you just mentioned the roof suddenly <#> It 's not that old a house<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Cos you said it <.> wa </.> there was a new house and there was an old house and you liked the old house<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Well from that it sounds like it was older than like in the last twenty years <,> in which case the roof may be dodgy<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> No I 'd say the roof was fine <#> I 'd say the roof was more than fine <#> But I thought <,> I thought that price was quite good <{> <[> compared to </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[> That </[> </{> is good<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Well compared to other places in east Belfast and compared to places in south Belfast <#> Plus because of the fact that<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Sit there<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> But that 's close to you know the Ulster Hospital<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> So you could get it rented out I 'd say fairly easily and it 's got a good bus route there and uhm it 's nice and close to everything <#> And it 's close to shops too<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> So I told Davy about it and I think he 's going round to see it<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> What <,> why does Davy <{> <[> <,> for you </[> and Davy to buy together<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> Well </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> No <#> No well I <,> I wasn't thinking of buying it <#> Well <,> I was just looking at it and then I said to Davy about it because I thought it would be ideal for him <{> <[> <,> and </[> he said you know that would allow me to buy my plasma screen TV <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[> Uh-huh </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Is that the only reason he wants a house<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> That and he wants a stereo <{> <[> system </[> that you wave at and it will open up<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[> Look at that dog </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> I wouldn't mind one of those<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> It 's about four thousand pounds apparently<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Uhm Lisa-Marie and I were in you know the Bang <,> and <{> <[> <.> Oluf </.> <#> What is it <#> Olufsen </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> Yeah <#> What was that like </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> I don't really know how to pronounce it<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> And then <,> because Roy said that the first thing he wants to do when they get back from honeymoon is buy a new TV for <{> <[> her </[> house <#> And I said what sort of TV would he want <#> Like one like that in the shop <#> It was you know one of the <,> it wasn't exactly flat screen but you know it was about that wide<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Or not flat screen <#> What do you call it <#> <{> <[> Is that what you call it </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> What do you mean </[> </{> <#> Plasma<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Is that <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Plasma screen it would probably be<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Uhm and she said <,> oh my God he 'd love that <#> And we looked at the price <#> It was three thousand and something<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> And uh <,> like three thousand eight hundred <#> And there was another one at four <.> hu </.> four thousand two hundred and something<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Mm <#> I know it 's <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> And I said would you let Roy spend that amount of <,> or would Roy spend that amount of money on a TV <#> And she said <,> something not very pleasant <#> I don't know what she said actually <#> She said yeah he would <#> And then I asked her would she let him <,> and she said no<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> There was actually a lovely one that was <,> I saw in a <.> mag </.> a magazine somewhere <#> Uhm and you can get it in all different colours <#> Is that the same one<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> There was one <,> the one that was four thousand and something as we were leaving the shop the woman was talking to <.> some </.> or the man was talking to somebody about it <{1> <[1> <,> and </[1> I heard him say you can get it in black and <{2> <[2> silver </[2> and <,> well he went on to say something <{3> <[3> but </[3> I don't know what it was<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[2> Red </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Again that would be perfect in my white room with the red thing from Beaufort and <,> <{> <[> a red TV screen </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> The red crocodile sofa </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Yes <#> And <,> <{> <[> Lisa-Marie </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> A red TV screen </[> </{> <#> Do you not think that 's overdoing it a bit<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> No <#> And <,> Lisa-Marie saw this thing in uh <,> we were in Bollock 's <{> <[> on </[> Saturday<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> Bollock 's </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Are you sure you weren't in Bullick

this <,> <{> <[> cos I was like </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> That 's near </[> </{> <,> it 's near the butcher 's<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> I was looking for stuff to get for <,> just like stupid wee things to get for Maeve <,> for going <#> Cos she 's forever making lists<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Is she<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> On <.> hol </.> like especially on holiday but here like she has a to do to buy <{> <[> <,> to </[> think of <,> to<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> That 's a bit like myself </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> To think of<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> What not to think of <#> I 'm taking the <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Uhm so I got a like this wee <,> like a child 's notepad but it was really cute <#> I got her this wee pen and then a Harry Potter uhm like eye <,> you look into it <#> It 's only about like that size and you look into it and you can read but except I couldn't read anything <#> And<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Oh that was the one I 've seen before isn't it<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> I don't know<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> You could read like <,> <{> <[> about one of the characters or something </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[> It was like a tail or something </[> </{> and it sort of went down like that <#> Like except I just sort of glanced into it <#> And something else I got <,> <#> Oh yes you know the Astro Belts <#> Sweets<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> I got her those too <#> And it all came to about the grand total of about eight pounds<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Did it<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Very cheap <#> And <,> that was why we were in <#> But there was this red uhm like <,> iguana or something uh or <,> you know <,> lizard or something but a huge thing <#> Not huge <,> about that sort of size<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Was it a dragon<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> And it sat <#> No <#> And <,> you know it was to sit on a shelf and it was looking up and you know with its paws down looking up <#> Lisa-Marie was going oh my God <#> Wouldn't that just be gorgeous <#> And I was saying yeah <,> in the white room with the red sofa and that would just be perfect<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Was it a proper <{> <[> ornament or was </[> it a plaything<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> <[> And she saw </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Yeah <#> No it was a proper

Right <#> What about in a bathroom<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> Yeah it would be cool in a bathroom actually <#> I was thinking on a hearth it would be nice <{> <[> or </[> you know on a mantelpiece<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> You know like the bathroom window or something <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> But it was

Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Is that a problem<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Could it be a problem<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> No <#> I 'm thinking about when I 'm going to get

wedding<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> I don't really know why <#> <.> Becau </.> well yeah I do know why <#> Because sometimes when you first get your hair highlighted it looks really streaky <#> You know when you after you wash it a bit it sort of blends in a bit more<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Sure if you put <,> well how long does it take<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$B> <#> A a couple of hours like it could take three hours<ICE-IRE:S1A-035$A> <#> Right well <{1> <[1> if you make it for eleven </[1> or so and then I could pick you up from <{2> <[2> wherever you are
