Evans, in his article, <ul> "'Rationing' Health Care: The LoadedAlternative" </ul> , described the NHS as seen through the eyes of hostile Americansas, <quote> <#> "endless waits to see overworked and undertrained staff in obsolete and undermaintained facilities. <#> Patients may be denied life saving treatment if they are old or for other reasons fail to receive high enough priority for scarce services whose availability is controlled by heartless, or at least unaccountable beaurocrats." </quote> </p><p> <#> This criticism probably goes too far: facilities are hardly <quote> "obsolete" </quote> and nor can the decision-makers be described as <quote> "heartless," </quote> but the system is certainly far from perfect. </p><p> <#> Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that,<quote> <#> "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing and medical care." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Major charter established three basic rights emanating from the NHS Reforms, which were to come into effect in 1992: <quote> "a right to health care on the basis of clinical need....a right to receive emergency medical care at any time....and a right to be guaranteed admission for treatment by a specific date no later than two years from the day when your consultant places you on a waiting list." </quote> </p><p> <#> This all appears very optimistic but seems to be based on an assumption that there is enough money to cater for treatment for everyone. <#> However, there is only a limited amount of money to pay for treatment to which everyone is apparently entitled, and this was recognised in the NHS Reforms, which, it was stated, <quote> "could allow purchasers to allocate resources according to the patients ' capacity to benefit from care." </quote> </p><p> <#> This provision demonstrates the logical conclusion that finite resources mustbe rationed and allocated according to where they will do the most good. <#> So,there are rights to treatment, but these are in conflict with its cost. <#> As touched onpreviously, one of the reasons offered for this is the increasing attraction of newmedical technology. <#> Sophisticated skills and tools are often procured at the costof "ordinary" treatment, and what health services are capable of doing far exceedswhat they can afford to do. <#> Time and money expended on one thing necessarilyexcludes the opportunity of spending them on something else, and clinicians now facethe difficult task of deciding between the utility of innovations that modern sciencehas created, which may save some gravely ill patients, and the advantage of providingeveryone with at least basic treatment. </p><h> <#> THE QUALITY OF LIFE </h><p> <#> In the United Kingdom, unlike in Oregon, there is no legislation designed toassist the decision-maker in deciding who should be treated. <#> In the past, age, gender and moral worthiness have been used as factors in decision-making, but in a modern, supposedly equal society, such criteria are anachronistic and unfair. <#> The sole criterion derives from pure reason - that the money should be spent where it will be most beneficial; but what is meant by <quote> "most beneficial?" </quote> </p><p> <#> A simplistic response would be that treatment is most worthwhile where it will save a life, or in other words, postpone a death. <#> However, this is not always the best solution. <#> If, for example, the victim of a serious car accident was so brain damaged that he or she had to have constant observation, was in chronic pain, breathed by means of a ventilator, was tube-fed and had lost all human dignity, would that person not perhaps be better off dead? </p><p> <#> The recent case of two-year-old Thomas Creedon illustrates this point. <#> He is both deaf and blind, is thought to be in constant pain and is fed through a hole in his stomach. <#> Basically, his existence is being maintained by the marvel of medical technology, but does he have any sort of acceptable quality of life? <#> His parents, battling to allow the treatment to be terminated obviously do not think so, and indeed, it can be argued that the money spent to keep his body functioning just enough to keep him alive would be much more effectively spent elsewhere, if it meant that another patient 's quality of life could improve. </p><p> <#> A similar issue arose in Laura Davies 's case. <#> This child had undergone treatment throughout her five years for a serious bowel complaint. <#> When it seemed that no cure could be found, her parents enquired about a transplant, but were discouraged by British doctors, since it was an experimental operation for children, and no-one had ever survived it for more than six months. <#> Despite this advice, Laura had two massive multi-organ transplants in America, at a cost of <*> pound sign </*> 1 million, before her death some months later. </p><p> <#> There have been many criticisms of the parents of this tragic child, for forcing her to endure extra months, or perhaps years of gruelling treatment, knowing that there was virtually no chance of survival, instead of allowing her to die in relative comfort. </p><p> <#> The two cases described above show a tendency of the physicians to favour quantity of life over quality. <#> However, it is more probable that the average person would rather have a high-quality short life than a long succession of years of suffering, with no light at the end of the tunnel. <#> There has been a recent attempt to incorporate both of these factors in decision-making, which will be discussed in the following section. </p><h> <#> QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS </h><p> <#> QALYs, an acronym for "Quality Adjusted Life Years," constitute a principal aid to decision-making in the National Health Service. <#> The QALY incorporates the idea both of quality of life and quantity of life, and is derived from survival data and the value of different states of health. </p><p> <#> Before discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the QALY, it is necessary to show exactly what it is and how it is calculated. <#> Alan Williams was at the source of the concept of QALYs. <#> He stated that, <quote> <#> "the essence of a QALY is that it takes a year of healthy life expectancy to be worth 1, but regards a year of unhealthy life expectancy to be worth less than 1. <#> Its precise value is lower the worse the quality of life of the unhealthy person.....if being dead is worth zero, it is possible for a QALY to be negative, for the quality of someone 's life to be judged worse than being dead." </quote> (5) </p><p> <#> The methodology used to quantify QALYs was designed by Rosser and Kind. (6) <#> In their calculations, they incorporate distress and disability factors, establishing eight categories of disability and four distress ratings. <#> Disability ranges from 1 (no disability) to 8 (totally dependent and unconscious), while the four stages of distress are: A, none; B, mild; C, moderate and D, severe. <#> A group of seventy people were asked to combine all categories of distress and disability, to evaluate them, and the average scores were charted on a table as shown below. <#> They had to give an evaluation, based on a scale ranging from -1 to +1, so that a quality of life score of +1 indicates absence of suffering. </p><&> table inserted </&><p> <#> It is evident from this that QALY calculations necessarily involve a degree of arbitrariness. <#> The degree of distress and disability is measured by means of a general consensus - other people decide how much pain or disability they reckon is caused by a certain condition, many of whom will not ever have suffered the symptoms themselves. <#> This factor has given rise to much controversy concerning the justice and ethics of the QALY. </p><p> <#> At first glance, the concept of the QALY seems like the best solution to any resource allocation problem. <#> Obviously treatment should be funded for the person who will obtain the best quality of life from it. <#> If faced, for example, with a thirty-year-old and an eighty-year-old, who both need a heart by-pass operation, the likelihood of its success being excellent for the younger person, promising him a normal life expectancy with minimal disability, but offering the older patient only another year of pain and suffering, the logical and reasonable response would be to give it to the younger patient. </p><p> <#> In a perfect society, of course, all patients would be treated equally, and medicine would not take into account age, quality of life, or any other factor. <#> However, when the issue concerns economic deficiency, meaning that choices <ul> must </ul> be made, such idealism is unrealistic and impracticable. </p><p> <#> Michael Lockwood states that the concept of the QALY is based on a welfarist element, saying that, <quote> "other things being equal, it should be regarded as preferable to confer greater aggregate benefit than less." </quote> <#> To him, it <quote> "doesn't seem unjust to choose to treat the patient for whom treatment is more likely to prove successful." </quote> (7) <#> This seems a fair statement, as long as extremes of situations are involved. <#> It is not difficult to see reasons for treating a young healthy patient before an elderly, infirm patient, or of treating a baby who will have a normal life expectancy with treatment than one with only another hour to live despite treatment. </p></I>
