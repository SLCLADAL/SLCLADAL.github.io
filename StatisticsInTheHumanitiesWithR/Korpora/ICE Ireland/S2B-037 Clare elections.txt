<ICE-IRE:S2B-037 Clare elections><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-037$A> <#> When the last Irish Elizabethan parliament was convened in fifteen eighty-five writs were issued for the election of two members to the lower House of Commons for Clare <,> which had been established as a county by Sir Henry Sidney in fifteen seventy <#> This was a process of colonisation <,> which had begun with the surrender of the Thomond chieftains to Henry the Eighth in fifteen forty-three <#> The electorate consisted of the forty-shilling freeholders namely <,> those who had free tenements to the minimum value of forty shillings above all charges <#> And the successful candidates were <,> Sir Turlough O'Brien <,> Ennistymon and Boetius Clancy <,> Knockfin <,> who would gain notoriety a few years later when <,> in his capacity as County Sheriff he dealt harshly with survivors of the Spanish Armada <#> No record of the fifteen eighty-five election has survived <,> but the fact that John McNamara chief of West Clancullen in addition to Rossa O'Loughlin <,> Burren <,> and Turlough O'Brien <,> Ballycrid felt it necessary to attend the parliament in Dublin as observers <,> indicated that they may have been unsuccessful candidates and that they believed their presence was necessary to protect their interests against the expansionist land ambitions of the Fourth Earl of Thomond who <,> in company with the Baron of Inchiquin and the Protestant Bishop of Killaloe were entitled to sit in the more influential upper House <#> The previous session of parliament in fifteen sixty had been described as <,> more like a bear-baiting of disordered persons than a parliament of wise men <#> And <,> in fifteen eighty-five the opposition was equally vociferous <,> as the struggle for land titles <,> and the carve-up of confiscated Church lands continued <#> The session of Parliament was followed in Clare by the establishment of a government-appointed commission to continue these deliberations <#> It resulted in the county being divided into nine baronies <,> the main beneficiaries being the Earl of Thomond and the Baron of Inchiquin who both received extensive land grants <,> a development which angered John McNamara so much that he refused to sign the agreement <#> No further parliaments were held in Ireland until the reign of James the First when <,> following the Plantation of Ulster writs for the convening of a parliament were issued in sixteen hundred and ten <,> whose main purpose would be to give recognition to the king 's title of the confiscated lands <#> The responsibility for convening the parliament was given to Sir Arthur Chichester and <,> in conjunction with the government 's determination to return a Protestant majority in the fractious Commons <,> a total of forty new boroughs were created <,> in which the power to elect members would be restricted to a small number of exclusively Protestant corporation members <#> The Letters Patent for the new borough of Ennis <,> which would be composed of a provost and just twelve burgesses <,> was signed by King James in sixteen hundred and twelve <#> And the Earl of Thomond duly arranged for the appointment of two English settlers <,> John Thornton <,> Doonass and Edmund Blood <,> Bohersallagh as the borough 's first representatives <#> The government however had less control over the election of county members <#> And in Clare <,> two recusants <,> Catholics who professed an often strident loyalty to the King were elected <,> namely Sir Daniel O'Brien who was reported as having become a fervent Catholic in sixteen hundred and two <,> and Boetius Clancy whose father had been a member of the fifteen eighty-five parliament <,> both of whom became active members of the opposition <#> But the proceedings opened chaotically with the recusants opposing the nomination of Sir John Davies the government appointee as speaker <#> And Sir Daniel O'Brien was one of the recusant members who attempted to physically install their own candidate <,> Sir John Everett in the Speaker 's chair <#> Following the subsequent withdrawal of the opposition members <,> Parliament was paroled for a year <,> with both sides petitioning the King <,> before it was finally dissolved in sixteen fifteen <#> It was the only parliament to be summoned during the reign of James the First <,> and a period of almost twenty years elapsed before the Lord Deputy Thomas Wentworth convened the parliament in sixteen thirty-four <,> to ensure the voting of badly-needed money supplies to King Charles the First <,> while at the same time managing to backpedal on the promised enactment of the Grace legislation <#> The same county members were again elected to represent Clare but <,> by now a Protestant majority was assured in the Commons and Wentworth had little difficulty in carrying through his own programme <#> When the second parliament of Charles the First met five years later <,> Clare was represented by four new members <,> the most prominent of whom was Captain Dermot O'Brien <,> Dromore Ruan <,> a first cousin of Sir Barnaby O'Brien the sixth Earl of Thomond <#> Mutual enmity towards Thomas Entworth now the Earl of Stafford initially united all factions when the parliament met <,> and Captain Dermot O'Brien was an important member of various committees <,> as a final attempt was made to have the principal Statutes of the Graces enacted <#> The outbreak of the sixteen forty-one rebellion effectively put an end to the influence of the parliament <#> And Captain Dermot O'Brien who <,> with former member Sir Daniel O'Brien joined the rebels <,> became a leading member of the Supreme Council of the Confederation of Kilkenny <,> and later supported Papal Nuncio Rinuccini when he broke with the Confederation <#> Social upheaval in Clare was accentuated when the county was included in the transplantation of Connacht <#> And when an election took place for Irish members to attend the Cromwellian parliament in London <,> Clare <,> along with Kerry and Limerick represented by Sir Henry Ingoldsby <,> a Cromwellian soldier who was governor of Clare and also held land along the Shannon estuary <#> The continuing weakness of the native chieftains of the county became evident when the restoration parliament of Charles the Second met in sixteen sixty-one <#> Ingoldsby managed to retain one of the county seats <,> while another Cromwellian officer <,> William Purefoy was elected as a member for Ennis borough <#> Once again <,> the vexed question of land resettlement dominated the proceedings <,> but apart from John McNamara <,> Knappogue <,> who retrieved part of his estates <,> and the octogenarian Sir Daniel O'Brien who <,> with his sons had served with Charles the Second in exile <,> the vast majority of the new settlers managed to retain possession of their lands <#> The only Irish parliament to be held in the reign of Charles the Second was dissolved in sixteen sixty-six <#> He was succeeded by his Catholic brother James the Second in sixteen eighty-five but <,> following the invasion of England by William of Orange <,> James initially fled to France before arriving in Ireland to attempt to win back his crown <#> He immediately summoned a parliament and <,> the response from Clare where regiments of infantry and dragoons in support of James had been formed was enthusiastic <#> And John McNamara and Denis O'Brien <,> a son of Viscount Clare <,> were elected as the county members <#> The charters of town boroughs had already been revoked <,> and replaced by Catholic burgesses <#> The two members chosen to represent Ennis were Florence McNamara and Theobald Butler <#> But <,> the enactments of what was termed the patriot or the Jacobite parliament <,> and which included the attainment of leading Protestant settlers in the county who had supported William of Orange were always going to be contested on the field of battle <#> And <,> following the defeat of James at the Battle of the Boyne <,> and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Limerick the original charter of the borough of Ennis was restored <,> while the county seats reverted to adherents of the Protestant Ascendancy <,> to members of the Burton and Gore families <,> and to Sir Donough O'Brien <,> who had been appointed as a reluctant sheriff in sixteen eighty-nine and who needed the assistance of a petition from the Protestant inhabitants of the county before his bona fides were accepted in England at the conclusion of the war <#> As the eighteenth century progressed parliaments were held on a more regular basis and <,> as the balance of power shifted away from the Upper House <,> membership of the Commons became more prestigious <#> Boroughs also became increasingly under the personal ownership of individual proprietors <#> And the borough of Ennis was initially controlled by members of the Bindon family <,> with David Bindon and his sons Samuel and David acting as its representatives until seventeen sixty-one <#> David Bindon Junior <,> a former Limerick city-based merchant <,> who possessed a strong entrepreneurial or maverick streak <,> was a prominent member of the Commons in the seventeen thirties <#> He wrote a number of pamphlets about the state of the country 's finances <,> and unsuccessfully propositioned the commissioners of revenue to adopt his scheme to improve the collection of the inland excise <#> But the most important of the members from Clare in the eighteenth century was Sir Lucius O'Brien <,> a disciple of the radical Clare-born Dr Charles Lucas <#> He entered Parliament as a member for Ennis in seventeen sixty-six <,> when the O'Brien family of Dromoland in conjunction with the Burton family took control of the borough <,> and he was elected as a county member in the general election of seventeen sixty-eight <#> A solicitor by profession <,> who had a practice in Dublin <,> in addition to his estates in Clare <,> Lucius O'Brien acted as the Commons workhorse in bringing in heads of countless bills for a period of over quarter of a century <#> He possessed an unrivalled knowledge of national and international trade matters <,> and was one of the main protagonists responsible for the development of free trade for Ireland in what became known as Grattan 's Parliament <#> But the unwillingness of the Irish Parliament to reform itself led indirectly to its own downfall <#> And following the rebellion of seventeen ninety-eight <,> Pitt brought forward an Act of Union which passed despite the opposition of Sir Edward O'Brien <,> the son of Sir Lucius and <,> of prime serjeant James Fitzgerald who had close connections with the county <#> But county member Hugh Dillon Massey <,> Doonass supported the measure <,> with the tacit backing of the newly-enfranchised Catholic voters <,> and fortified by a bribe of five thousand pounds <,> while borough Member John Ormsby Vandeleur <,> Kilrush <,> who had formerly been a stern critic of government trade policy also supported the Union legislation <,> having accepted the post of a Commissioner of Revenue <#> According to the terms of the Union Bill between Ireland and Great Britain <,> the county of Clare retained its two seats in the House of Commons in London <,> while representation in the borough of Ennis was reduced to one member <#> As the importance of the Catholic vote increased <,> even though the forty-shilling freeholders were largely manipulated by the principal land owners <,> the long-delayed Catholic Emancipation legislation became an issue at each election <,> and was supported by all of the county 's members <#> James Fitzgerald had succeeded in gaining part control of Ennis borough in eighteen hundred and three <,> but it was his son William <,> better known as Vesey Fitzgerald who made the greater impact following his election to the borough in eighteen hundred and seven and subsequently as a county Member in eighteen eighteen <#> Vesey Fitzgerald owed his political advancement as Chancellor of the Irish Treasury to his father 's influence with the government <,> following his surrender of incriminating letters entrusted to him by Mrs Mary Anne Clarke a former mistress of the Duke of York <#> But Vesey Fitzgerald although not an instinctive politician was an excellent speaker and an able administrator and he quickly secured a solid power base in Clare <,> with a judicious sprinkling of sinecures <,> public <,> offices and army promotions to the friends and relatives of prominent vote-getters in the county <#> He was a supporter of Catholic emancipation and <,> in spite of stiff opposition from the landed lobby <,> brought in an enlightened grand jury bill which attempted to curb the excesses and corruption associated with the building and repair of roads <#> In January eighteen twenty-four the moribund Catholic Association received fresh impetus when Councillor Daniel O'Connell proposed that every Catholic should contribute a monthly sum of between a penny and two shillings according to their circumstances</I>
