<ICE-IRE:S1A-029 Second world war><I><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Uhm <,> so what about <,> do you remember the first day of the war<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> I remember the third of September I think it was nineteen thirty-nine<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And I was working in Enniskillen<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And uh in the drapery trade <,> and the first thing we had to do was take stock and order some utility garments <#> And they were marked with a round white ring with a V cut out of them <,> cut out of the ring you understand<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And <,> uh if anybody purchased one of those garments they had to give us what you call margarine coupons <#> And it was so many coupons for each garment and they had to be cut out of the book and put into a <,> you know a drawer or a safe or something<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And uhm <,> sweets were rationed and not that I bought many of them but they were <.> ra </.> rationed and we had to give coupons for them <#> And of course when I went into the shop to get some sweets <,> and handed in the coupons I thought I had them paid for <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Why<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> I remember being in Peg Dawson 's in Enniskillen <#> She 'd a wee sweetie shop <#> And uh oh she said Mrs Lewis you forgot to pay me <&> laughs </&> <#> I thought I 'd paid her with the coupons <#> I remember that as well<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> So what like <,> what would have been an ordinary meal <#> You know <,> like with the effects of rationing and stuff like that <#> <{> <[> Would 've been </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> <[> Oh rationing </[> </{> <#> Yes food was rationed<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And we had ration books<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And uhm <,> the coupons were cut out of those also <#> And when they were done you didn't get any more groceries and you had to live very very meagrely<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And uh<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$C> <#> What did they

the simple reason they weren't making them then <{> <[> <#> You </[> had a buy a two-piece suit or something like that <#> And uh of course the coupons had to be handed in again for those <#> Uh the material for the dress cost <,> two pounds fifty <,> and the making was one fifty which cost me four pounds for my wedding outfit<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Ah

</{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right <#> How long were they here for<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Oh they stayed for weeks<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Finally they got tired and wanted to go back to their city life you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah <#> Suppose it would be quiet <,> would it <&> laughter </&> <#> So did you ever keep in touch with them or<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Uh for a while and then they faded out<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> But they were in every house around you know <{> <[> <#> They </[> were in all the <,> all the neighbours had them<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Were you asked to actually take children or<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Huh<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Were you actually asked to take children <{> <[> or did you offer </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> <[> Oh yes yes </[> </{> yeah <#> The I think it would have been the Council <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> who come out <#> There was two or three days I went round myself<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Alice Dunne and I went round the we went right up to your granny 's<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> But she wasn't having ay <.> anthi </.> anything<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right <&> laughs </&> <#> Wouldn't take them<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> They didn't go over to your house <#> I don't whether you 'd 've taken them or not<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> I don't know if we got a lot of people round Newtown<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah <{> <[> where everybody was taken in </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> <[> Very good </[> </{> <#> Very good <#> And we got quite a good reception <#> You know they nearly all well they knew all <,> they knew some of us <{1> <[1> in </[> most of the houses you know <,> where there was young people running about to dances and things <{2> <[2> they </[2> knew who we were <#> And we cycled all round Newtown up to the border and all round there <,> back down into Maguire 's Bridge and out in the country <#> Tom McMurray 's uh <,> they had uh they had four<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Uh huh<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And Mrs Knowles had two beside us <#> And uhm now I don't know who else would have had them <#> I think there <.> wa </.> was there was very few houses escaped <#> You see you more or less had to take them<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> You can't leave them out<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> So what the were you given any money for taking them and to keep or to keep them or did you have to <{> <[> take it all out of your own pocket </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> <[> Mm <,> no we got so much <#> We got little <,> </[> </{> we didn't get very much<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> And they were ravenous <#> They were starving<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah</I><I><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Do you remember the first day of the war<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> I remember coming home from school <#> I was a pupil in Enniskillen at the time and my mother said to me <,> they 've declared war and they 're still playing music on the radio <#> And she seemed a bit horrified that this was all happening at the same time as a war was going to start <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right right <#> Was there <,> what what would 've been the effect on <,> the whole say for example Newtownbutler <#> Was there <,> was there a general sort of outcry or was is all taken in people 's <{> <[> stride or </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> <[> Well now </[> </{> <,> I can't really remember exactly what happened apart from that because I spent most of my day out of the village<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> And then when I came home I had homework to do and I didn't see much of the other people apart from holiday times<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right right <#> So well <,> then after the war started uhm what effects did it would it have had upon social life in the town<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Well before the war there wasn't a great deal of social life here <#> But when the soldiers arrived <,> the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> arrived in Crumlin <,> at the uh soon after the beginning of the war <#> They 'd been in Dunkerque and they were supposed to have a rest cure in Crum<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> So <,> they arrived and they lived in Nissen huts <,> which weren't awfully comfortable no doubt and the officers lived in the castle <#> And <,> after that they had dances in what is now the Community Centre in Newtownbutler <#> It was then called the Courthouse <#> So <,> all the local girls of course flocked to the dances <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> And the social life began to wake up <{1> <[1> <#> Well </[1> after about nine months then they departed <#> I think they went to Madagascar after that <,> and a lot of them were killed out there <#> I don't know <,> <{2> <[2> what </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[1> Right right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[2> Do </[2> </{2> people actually keep in touch with<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> Not now <{> <[> no <#> We </[> did keep in touch with some of them but not any more<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[> Oh right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> So then <,> after that they were followed by the Berkshire Regiment <,> and they again had dances <#> And I think some of them were held at the riding school at Crum <#> And after they left the Americans arrived <,> because America came into the war after Pearl Harbor<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> And that was some time after the actual beginning of the war <#> So then they again <,> uh uh lived out in the Nissen huts <#> But during this time <,> uh between the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and the Americans <,> a lot of them used to come into Lurganboy House and they played tennis on the tennis what was then the tennis court <#> It was flat but I 'm afraid it isn't flat any longer <&> laughter </&> <#> But anyway they did play tennis and then we had a few spare rackets<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> And they really enjoyed themselves <#> And my mother used to make steak and kidney pies <,> which seemed to stretch and stretch according to the amount of gravy that was put in<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> Because uh the meat was rationed <,> and butter was rationed and margarine was rationed <,> and there were very few cakes or anything <#> And sweets were rationed at the time <#> So whatever they got had to be more or less basic <#> But they seemed to have enjoyed their visits<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Uh<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Basically they were almost like taken in as family almost<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Well that was it <#> <{> <[> Yes </[> <#> So in between times I did my homework <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Nice to fit it in you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Yes <#> It had to be fitted in as well<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$B> <#> Now what else can I remember <#> Oh yes there was a canteen <#> The what is now the Church Hall <,> had a marketplace underneath where they <,> graded eggs and the actual Church Hall was <,> it was then called the Parochial Hall was above the place where they grade the eggs<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> And we played badminton up there <#> And the Johnson family had a canteen <#> And a Mrs Kerr who lived somewhere real near Clontivrin <,> uh ran the canteen and several other local people helped <#> So the army used to come in and they were supplied with Paris buns <&> laughter </&> <#> Some of the local people made cakes and provided food and they had sausages <,> and uh again there was entertainment of some kind up there<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$D> <#> But it made a social gathering <{1> <[1> <,> and </[1> we got to know quite a few of these people <#> And apart from the army <,> there was an <.> air </.> airforce base up at Killaroo <{2> <[2> <#> That 's </[2> where Geoffrey Lewis now lives <{3> <[3> lives </[3> <#> That 's all been dismantled<ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-029$A> <#> <[3> Mhm yeah </[3> </{3></I>
