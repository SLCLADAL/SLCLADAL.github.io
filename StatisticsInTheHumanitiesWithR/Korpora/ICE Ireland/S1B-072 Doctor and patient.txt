a few times with this problem <#> Uh I was about about six months ago I was uh <#> I <,> previously before that about two years when I was doing karate <,> I uh hurt my right leg <{> <[> <,> well </[> I was trying I was trying to kick somebody I think it was <#> Uh I heard a snap <,> uh underneath my leg uh <,> just about in there<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Uh how long ago did you say <#> Two years<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Well <,> you see I was at a doctor six months ago <#> It had been two years before that<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> I I went <,> oh about six weeks after that as it was very painful <#> Uh doctor told me that it was just a hamstring injury and that people basically got them all the time in sporting activity <{> <[> and not to worry about it </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> Okay and </[> </{> well uh what 's wrong with you now that you come up<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Well uh uh another <,> another six months it didn't get any better <#> Uh I let it go and it started in colder weather possibly <,> it was very very sore uh walking up the street and what have you <#> <{> <[> It was </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> Your </[> </{> knee or you leg<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Uh in the back of my leg<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It 's as if there 's some tendon running down uh underneath <#> I don't know anything about it obviously but it 's I heard this big snap <#> But I can't feel anything wrong with my leg<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> That 's two years ago<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> That 's two years ago <#> I came back six months ago <,> uh and complained of the same uh injury <#> I was sent to the sports clinic <{1> <[1> <#> Uh </[1> I got I got in there <#> Uhm <,> I was <,> didn't get any help basically at all <#> <.> Th </.> they seemed to ignore that I said snap <#> And actually it was quite funny cos the physiotherapist told me that one of my legs was a centimetre shorter than the other one <#> And she gave me a a bit of foam <,> white foam stuff to put in my shoe <{2> <[2> <#> She </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[2> Uh </[2> </{2> who told you this<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It was one of the physiotherapists<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Which leg was shorter<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> The right one <#> And she said it was it was <{1> <[1> I </[1> it was actually a problem with my lower back <#> It wasn't a problem with my leg <#> <{2> <[2> I tried to <,> pain in my leg </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[1> But I </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[2> What was what was in </[2> </{2> in your legs <#> She said the pain in your leg was coming from your back <{> <[> and that 's what she said </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> Yes she says </[> </{> my my bottom back was very tight and that was the problem <#> <{> <[> And it wasn't my leg </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> You 've had the </[> </{> pain now for two years haven't <{> <[> you </[> <#> And you were last seen six months ago<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Exactly <#> <{1> <[1> So she didn't really </[1> understand that it it was actually I felt something snap in my leg <#> <{2> <[2> It wasn't in my lower back </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[1> What what </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[2> <.> Wh </.> <.> wh </.> what 's </[2> </{2> actually wrong with you now that you 've come up today<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> I occasionally feel the pain when I 'm running <#> Or if I haven't exercised for a while <{> <[> and I </[> playing a game of football or something I <.> s </.> uh get sharp pains uh in my legs<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> So </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> So is it is it getting worse or is just the fact that it hasn't gone away<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It just hasn't gone away and it 's always there <,> whenever I it 's uh <#> The last time a few months a a <.> coup </.> couple of weeks back <,> I was playing a game of football <,> and then I was just <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the last minute <#> And I felt it the whole way through the game<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Right so it 's it 's it hasn't actually been getting worse the last couple of days<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No it 's it didn't get worse<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> It 's just that it hasn't gone away <{> <[> and you 're just concerned </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> It hasn't gone away </[> </{> yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> And it all started two years ago <#> Nothing before then<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Nothing before that time I I actually heard the snap<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> You 'd say it 's a sharp pain<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Yup <#> It 's <{> <[> very sharp </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> It is <#> <.> Wh </.> </[> </{> where exactly is the pain<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Well it 's it 's it 's well above the hamstring <#> It 's sort of it 's in there<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Is it at the back of your leg<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Yes at the very back of my leg<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Does it move at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It doesn't move no<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> It just stay in one place<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Stays in the one <{> <[> place </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> Does </[> </{> it go down below the knee<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> Is there any pain in your back at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And any pain in your knee itself<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No pain<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And it 's all just in the back of your leg<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> All at the <{> <[> back of my leg </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> And </[> </{> does it only come with movement or do you get it when you 're sitting down at rest<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> If I had 've been exercising for a while and I was sitting I would feel it for a few weeks after exercising <#> Yes <{1> <[1> even sitting down </[1> <,> <#> At times it would be constant and then at times I I forget about it or it wouldn't be <{2> <[2> there <,> </[2> <#> But I 'm always aware of it <{3> <[3> always </[3><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[1> Right and is it constant </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[3> Okay </[3> </{3> and uh does anything make it go away or anything make it worse<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Just as I say exercise makes it <{> <[> you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> And is there any </[> </{> way you can get rid of it<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Not exercising <,> not do anything with that leg after a while <{> <[> till it totally disappears </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> And </[> </{> <,> do you 've any pain anywhere else at all in the other leg<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Back<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> And no pain in your feet at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Do you get any numbness at all or any <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> No </[> </{> <,> <#> Not at all <#> Just one pain<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Any weakness in your legs<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Uh does your leg ever give way from you<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And you 've no difficulty walking upstairs<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No no<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Or coming down the stairs<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay and how about bending over or standing up<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> As a say uh uh possibly after exercising <,> you know I would feel it more bending over and what have you <#> But normal as I am now no I never feel it<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> None at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> None at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And if you were to if you didn't do any exercise now <,> would it go away by itself<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It would go away <{1> <[1> and </[1> possibly in six months ' time I 'll feel it again <#> I 'll say there 's <{2> <[2> that pain again </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[1> Then </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[2> Right </[2> </{2> <#> It 'll just come back on you again <#> And when did you say it came on the last time<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Uh I was exercising a few weeks back<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Right so it 's really for the last few weeks you 've had a <{> <[> problem </[> <#> So you had it over the last two years on and off<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And then six weeks ago it came or <,> a few weeks ago it came back again<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And it 's really hasn't cleared up yet <#> <{> <[> You want to get </[> it checked out<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> Exactly </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> I 'd like to know<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And it 's a sharp pain <,> behind the right <.> le </.> leg and behind the right <{> <[> thigh </[> <#> Doesn't move anywhere<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> Aye </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> You 've no pain in your back<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> No pains in the knee<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> No other problems at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Not at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> You 're generally well<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> No other problems with your health<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Any medication<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No medication<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> And you said a physio told you that your right leg was shorter<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Yeah <#> She she measured up she seemed to ignore the fact that it was actually a pain in my leg <{1> <[1> <#> And I </[1> uh the crux of the matter I think is I felt <,> I heard and felt something snap <{2> <[2> <,> yet </[2> she tried to tell me that uh it was the bother was at base of the back <#> And she just kept kneading the base of my back until it was sore and telling me that that was the problem <#> And <{3> <[3> it wasn't </[3><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[3> And she <,> you don't </[3> </{3> actually believe her then<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No I don't believe her at <{> <[> I 've no confidence </[> in going up to the sports clinic again<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> <[> And <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Uh huh <#> Have you worn it <#> Have you used the foam that she gave you<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No I didn't<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Uh uh did you not try it at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> I no I didn't<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Do you not think it 'd be worth trying<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> I I I don't think so because uh <,> it I had never ever any trouble before this <#> And then I heard the snap <,> and felt the snap <,> and I don't think uh now I don't I don't think that after all these years that suddenly<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Uh huh <#> Well I I would think that they should actually give it a <,> give it a try cos it <.> wo </.> it 's certainly going to do no harm <#> And if it did work at least then <,> uh <,> you know it 'd be something simple that would work <#> <{> <[> Okay </[> <#> Can I 've a wee look at your knee<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Aye<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Just bend the knee right the way up for me <#> Okay now just sit down again <#> It 's alright <#> Okay <#> Bend the knee right the way back for me <#> Okay bend it back to your <,> to touch the back of your thighs <#> Just bend it down <#> Bend it right the way back <#> Now straighten it out for me <#> Hold it out straight <#> Now keep it straight <#> Don't really bend it <#> <.> Ke </.> keep it straight <#> Now just relax the leg <#> Let me take the weight of it <#> Let me take the weight of it again <#> Bend the knee down for me <#> Okay are you sore anywhere round here<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> So the knee 's perfectly fine <{> <[> or </[> <#> Okay <#> And just relax the leg now for me <,> <#> How about that<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <[> Yup </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It 's fine<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And turn it round here<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It 's fine<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <,> now how about in here at the back<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> That 's fine<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> How about in here<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Fine<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> Are you tender there at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> How about up here<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Can you just stand up for me <#> Turn around a minute <#> Right <,> point to where exactly it 's sore<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Well it is <,> some in there<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> Can you point it with one finger<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> It 's <.> firs </.> I can't really point it out now <#> Mm <,> there<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Okay <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> Just bend forward for me <#> Try and touch your toes <#> Stand up again <#> Lean right the way back and turn back <#> Is that sore<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> No <#> Twist down the side <,> down the other side <#> Okay <#> Now just stand straight for me again <#> Just tell me if this hurts anywhere <#> Did she find the physio <.> ther </.> therapist find a sore place in your back<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> No <#> She just said it was tight <#> She actually made it sore by sticking her her thumbs in it which isn't <#> I mean here 's what she done<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> I I think you must 've uh <,> pulled one of the hamstring 's muscles <#> And <,> what 's happened is whenever you heard the snap it was probably just a few fibres and uh <,> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> You haven't actually broken the whole hamstring muscle <,> <#> Uh it 's just going to be a sprain <#> And the problem with it is that unless you don't <.> exer </.> exercise properly it 's not going to heal up <,> and you 're going to be left with a weak knee <#> Uhm <,> uh whenever you 're in go and do some uh excessive exercise you 're just going to bring it on again <#> So what you need to do is do uh gradual exercise to build it up <,> to full strength again <#> I think if you if you do that build it up gradually it will take over from the weakness<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$B> <#> Yup<ICE-IRE:S1B-072$A> <#> And then <.> on </.> once you start getting full exercise you won't have any difficulty with it</I>
