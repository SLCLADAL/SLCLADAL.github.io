<W2D-013 Flowers - Colours><I><W2D-013$A><h> <#> Forever Flowers </h><h> <#> By Maeve Watt </h><p> <bold> <#> Frances Brown from Newtownards has always loved flowers and she started flower arranging ten years ago, beginning with leisure classes and was then encouraged to do her City and Guilds part 1 and 2. <#> She enjoyed it so much that she decided to teach, got her qualifications and at the moment is teaching in Bangor Tech. </bold> </p><p> <#> "I REALLY LOVE TEACHING, SEEING OTHER <}> <-> peoples </-> <+> people 's </+> </}> work. <#> I am learning all the time too." <#> She also loves competitive work where there 's a show and the entrants are given a title. <#> "You have to interpret the title in flowers and my most recent piece, The Flower Fairies, won up in Antrim. <#> I had to compete again in England and won - the prize was a nice weekend in Glasgow which was great, except that it rained constantly!" </p><p> <#> Frances also competed in the World Show where she was runner up and won <*> pound sign </*> 500 towards going to South Africa to represent Northern Ireland. <#> "I was absolutely thrilled. <#> It 's in February and I have to do an exhibit connected with Northern Ireland. <#> I 'm working on it at the moment," she laughs. <#> "But it 's a secret! <#> There 's a World Show every four years, the last one was in New Zealand and the next one is in Edinburgh, so Frances is delighted to be going to South Africa! <#> "It 'll be a wee bit nerve wracking getting everything over there. <#> If you take anything from here, there are pest controlled regulations and even material has to have a fire proof certificate. <#> Obviously, as I will be depicting something from Northern Ireland, I 'll have to take some stuff over, but you can order flowers there and I 'm busy working the whole thing out at the moment. <#> The plane will be filled with flowers!" <#> We wish her luck! </p><p> <#> Over the years, everything grown in her garden has been converted for flower arranging. <#> If I 'm doing a wedding, it 's great to be able to go and cut stuff from the garden, nice and fresh, it also keeps the cost down a little," smiles Frances. <#> And there 's a lot to learn in flower arranging, it moves on from fashion to fashion and Frances has to make sure that she keeps abreast of the new trends - including dried flower arrangements. </p><p> <#> "There are different ways of drying and preserving flowers too - you can <}> <+> get </+> </}> glycerine leaves and silicone gel flowers and, of course, some flowers dry naturally." <#> Her favourite flower is probably the rose because it can be dried as well. <#> They must be picked just before full bloom on a nice dry day and hung upside down in a dark, warm place for about a fortnight. <#> Red and yellow roses are the best colours to dry. <#> Frances has a tip for beginners. <#> "The best thing to do is to try to compete, starting off in the novice section. <#> The best way to learn is on the show bench where you will get comments from judges and also see other <}> <-> peoples </-> <+> people 's </+> </}> work. <#> "It 's so enjoyable," she laughs, "You may not always win, but at least if you make a mistake, you 'll know the next time! <#> Frances Brown believes that a bowl of flowers brings a room completely to life and that a room without flowers or plants, is dead. </p><p> <#> With Christmas dinner parties starting to fill up the calendar, Frances has put together a step-by-step guide to creating three very different flower arrangements, guaranteed to brighten up any table setting. </p><h> <#> FLOWERS AND FRUIT </h><p> <#> THE PLASTIC DISH containing a soaked oasis which has been taped down and is sitting in the middle of a vine ring. <#> Just to keep the furniture dry, the ring is lying on a base of cork (1). </p><p> <#> Frances puts a candle in the centre and round the bottom, she has taped on some kebab sticks so that they will go into the oasis and keep the candle in place. </p><p> <#> She is going to use apples, grapes, cones, a pretty tartan ribbon and some little bundles of twigs, some spray carnations and foliage - not anything with a soft leaf that would have to be replaced in the warmth, but ivy and holly which will last a long time. <#> Spray carnations will last longer than most flowers over the Christmas period. </p><p> <#> The ribbon has wired edges to it which makes it sit up nicely and Frances just loops it four times, backwards and forwards before putting a wire tightly round the centre, making sure the wire is extended so that it can go into the oasis. <#> She cuts the end of the ribbon in a vee shape to make it more attractive. </p><p> <#> Secure the apples with kebab sticks into the stem end which will help it sit in the oasis. <#> Put in the candle and the outline of the foliage making sure that the foliage is dipping down because it has to cover the oasis. <#> Put in the apples and grapes which have been wired, on opposite sides and remember to clean the stems of the foliage before use (2). </p><p> <#> Frances uses different foliage including Skimmia, turning the arrangement round all the time to make sure the oasis is hidden. </p><p> <#> She places the flowers, layering them so that there is a pocket of flowers on the opposite sides of the fruit to balance the colour (3). </p><p> <#> Cones are added to finish it off and little pieces of foliage, berries and small bundles of sticks to make it more interesting (4). </p><p> <#> Always make sure there is enough water in the dish to soak into the oasis and spray the arrangement daily to keep it fresh and alive. </p><h> <#> RING OF ROSES </h><p> <#> USING AN OASIS RING which has been soaked in a basin of water (turn the ring upside down and let it soak until the bubbles stop coming out) Frances sets it on a brass tray so that when she waters it, the water doesn't escape onto the top of the table (1). </p><p> <#> She uses gold coloured slimline candles in three different placements with a ribbon (wire edged again) at the base of each one. <#> She also uses artificial gold balls, again in three different placements (2). </p><p> <#> The candles are placed at different levels and the flowers used are rich red roses. <#> Covering the oasis in conifer, turning it round all the time and also placing the foliage on the inside of the ring and on the top so that it is entirely covered (3). </p><p> <#> She also uses variegated holly - the lime green colour goes well in arrangements as it lifts the colour. <#> Frances picks all the foliage apart from the Skimmia, from her own garden. </p><p> <#> She adds some red berries and some red roses to distribute the colours throughout the design (4). <#> (If the roses flop, you can recut them and place the ends in boiling water for half a minute and then float them in a basin of water. <#> They should perk up again!) </p><p> <#> Frances finishes this arrangement by adding ivy leaves which have nice shiny surfaces to cover the oasis. </p><h> <#> GLAMOROUS GOLD </h><p> <#> PUTTING THE SOAKED OASIS into a container that has a spike in the end of it like a candle holder, push it down into the top of a glass container with a piece of gold lame material to wind round it (1). <#> This arrangement is really for a buffet table. </p><p> <#> Frances is going to use white silk poinsettias trimmed with gold and some golden fruit, apples and pears, white September flowers to do the outline and a gold rope with tassels. <#> She drops the material round the glass, tucking it in at the bottom. <#> Frances likes using candles in table arrangements because they 're pretty to look at when eating and for this arrangement, she has used the slimline candles. </p><p> <#> She does the outline with the September flower and some lovely trailing ivy with a few variegated leaves towards the centre. <#> The rope is then dropped down the glass over the material (2) and a cherub is added. <#> His wings have been wired so he can rest in the middle of the arrangement. </p><p> <#> Frances fills in the design with poinsettias and foliage - you can bend silk flowers which makes them easier to use. <#> She adds some gilded fruit (3). <#> This arrangement, whilst looking extremely elegant, is reasonably easy to assemble. </p></I><I><W2D-013$A><h> <#> Colour Perfect <#> Maeve Watt </h><p> <bold> <#> Colour has a powerful <}> <-> affect </-> <+> effect </+> </{> on our lives and about 60 years ago, it was discovered that the colours we wear have a real influence on the appearance of our complexion. <#> Now known as Personal Colour Analysis, this service is available throughout the world to men and women who care about projecting a positive image, who care about getting it right. </bold> </p><p> <#> THE COLOUR CLASSIFICATION is based on the four seasons - Spring, Summer Autumn and Winter. <#> The Spring person needs to use bright, vibrant, clear colours from light to bright and a Summer person needs soft, muted colours (that doesn't discount darker colours as the range includes soft dark colours that must be toned down or lightened). <#> The Winter person suits very strong, acidy and sharply contrasting colours and the Autumn person suits the deep, earthy tones in the muted, soft end of the range - not just olive, brown and rust, but purples and any golden tones. </p><p> <#> During a colour consultation, the consultant looks at personality, colour preferences, the pattern in the iris of the eye, the effects of testers on the skin and does a detailed draping with a whole range of colours under special lighting conditions. <#> The client is given a wallet containing her range of colours, 36 in all, which represent thousands of shades and advised to wear darker or lighter. </p><p> <#> Colour consultant Evelyn Burns was running a nearly new designer shop when she started to notice that an increasing number of brand new outfits were coming in. <#> "People had made mistakes and chosen the wrong colour. <#> When they told me they had had their colours done, I remember thinking - my goodness, imagine letting someone tell you what colour to wear! <#> I was so sceptical," she laughs. <#> "But as I watched these women transforming themselves, I thought I might be able to help women to select on the basis of their natural colouring. <#> Then during a trip to London, I had my own colours done and it turned out that I was getting my own clothes wrong! <#> Then I could see, wearing the new colours and make-up, how different I looked and how much better!" </p><p> <#> Two years later, Evelyn trained with a Californian company in London and four years ago, set up her offices in the heart of Belfast. <#> She also trains throughout Ireland and has 36 consultants, including one in Australia! </p><#> And most women do get it wrong. <#> Studies have shown that over 50 <*> per cent sign </*> have the wrong colour of clothes in their wardrobe. <#> "The problem is that most people are drawn to two totally different spectrums of colour. <#> That is affected by the person 's taste and personality and what she 's attracted to, so that 's not something I eliminate, just something I have to work with and have to learn to recognise through the procedures in the consultation." </p><p> <#> Evelyn also knows that people have moods in colours that attract them more to one than another, from one year to the next, from one season to the next, and that they 're also influenced by what 's going on in the fashion world. <#> "Grey is being plugged this year and so many people who have never thought about grey will be wearing it, whether it suits them or not." </p><p> <#> Once Evelyn has established the two colours that the client is drawn to, she does a skin tone test where she finds out if the skin tone is cool or warm, followed by an eye pattern test. <#> The iris diagnosis is based on the alternative therapy, Iridology which is a very important tool for working out someone 's colour. <#> "About 25 years ago, a connection was discovered between colour analysis and Iridology - they discovered that genetically, people with certain shapes in their eyes had certain personalities." <#> The Autumn person often has a star shape around the pupil and the Winter person has a black spoke or stripe in the eye. <#> The summer person has a 'cracked glass' pattern in the eyes and the Spring person has a golden sunburst. <#> "My eyes are actually blue," smiles Evelyn, "But because I'm spring and have a golden sunburst, they look green! <#> And no, I don't ever wear green eye shadow!" <#> Wearing matching eye shadow does little to enhance the skin. <#> Many Winters who have olive coloured eyes, don't suit olive, they're better wearing emerald. <#> Many brown eyed women wear brown eye shadow which does nothing for them, they should be wearing greys or mauve tones which will have a clarifying effect on their skin. </p><p> <#> Evelyn advises the client on all aspects of make-up, doing their faces so they can see for themselves. <#> She also gives advice on the kind of jewellery the client should wear and even the size and colour of glasses that will suit her best. <#> Most women, alas, do seem to get it wrong! </p><p> <#> Evelyn drapes her clients in silk scarves with a range of colours, working through the reds and yellows, greens and browns, pinks and blues in a particular order, leading them to the point where they can see for themselves what suits them and what doesn't. <#> "It usually takes about 6 drapes which just cover the shoulders and reflect onto the face, but once they can see, they 're delighted!" <#> Some people respond very dramatically at times, sometimes chatty people are deep in thought at the end of the consultation, but everyone plans to start wearing their new colours. </p><p> <#> Winters get it right better than anybody else because, by personality and genetically, they 're set up with real flair and man of them are involved in fashion design. <#> "There 's a whole connection between the seasons and the occupations they 're involved with," says Evelyn. <#> "Winters are also compassionate and are often in the medical profession. <#> So, a profession is often a clue to a consultant." <#> Superficial colouring, of course, is not and all the seasons have an equal mixture of colours - you can have a blonde, blue eyed Winder, Spring, Summer of Autumn. <#> Many Autumns are in teaching or training and involved with the organisation of people. <#> They have powerful perseverance and, along with Winters, are often powerful leaders. <#> Springs are the communicators and like selling, they 're good at PR and can do small talk spontaneously. <#> Diversity in their job is a necessity. <#> Summers are the gentle people in life - they 're very methodical and precision orientated and do the support role, brilliantly. <#> "I am spring," says Evelyn. <#> "But remember the idea of two sides to everybody and that they 're drawn to two different types of colour - I 'm a Spring with Summer secondary, like the active and the passive. <#> Spring, yes, I want to be out there with other people and Summer, the reserved, where I 'm quite happy on my own! <#> And precision orientated and pernickety!" <#> Evelyn is drawn to red and golds. </p><p> <#> Fragrances also connect with a person 's colouring. <#> The Spring person suits light floral or fresh fragrances like <}> <-> like </-> </}> L'Air du Temps, Colours by Benetton and the Autumn woman needs something a little more musky, like Opium, Eternity, Poison. <#> Winters suit spicy perfumes - Paloma Picasso, Safari and the Summers suit the lightest scents like Rive Gauche and <}> <-> Channel </-> <+> Chanel </+> </{> No. 5. <#> "Different fragrances smell different on different people," says Evelyn. <#> "It 's because of the undertone, the chemistry of the skin." </p><p> <#> Your colour is genetically set up, like your finger prints and eye pattern. <#> If people learn about the particular shades of colour that suits them, in clothes, in make-up, in hair colour, they will be totally harmonious and perfectly groomed. <#> "This is not about looking beautiful in ideal terms," says Evelyn. <#> "It 's about looking perfect for them and nothing beats the balance of colour. <#> It presents them in their best light and gives them an aura of good judgement and harmony. <#> Once you discover what suits you, people start saying how well you look and it 's a real confidence booster," laughs Evelyn. <#> "And let 's face it, we could certainly all do with a daily does of that!" </p></I>
