<ICE-IRE:S2A-031 Food - Simon talks><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-031$A> <#> We as a company have employed <,> placement students over the past few years that we have been open <#> We have employed two different types of placement students <,> ones in short-term placement for three months basically summer vacation work <,> and ones on the longer-term year <#> And we have been looking probably for different things out of the two sets of students <#> Out of the three-month placement students <,> normally these people are placed to cover <.> ho </.> holidays on the floor <#> And basically are put down <,> to work on the production lines to cover jobs like packing jobs or whatever else <#> Fairly unskilled but <,> the thing that we get from students when we take them into that job <,> is that the people actually have an understanding of the processes that are going on within the food industry <#> The reasons behind the various hygiene practice rules that we have within the food industry <#> And so we 're taking on people who are not <,> completely ignorant <#> They have to be <,> trained to quite a degree <#> We can slot them in and they uhm because they have that understanding they can work in in along with everybody else fairly easily <#> And we have found that quite successful through the summer <#> Now we have taken on other students three in total <,> for a placement of a year <,> one from Queen 's and two from <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> who run the food uhm course <#> Again all our students have come from the food side <#> They 're very aware of <,> basically everything that 's behind food <#> They 're aware of the microbiological implications the chemical <.> ap </.> implications and applications <,> that are going on on in the factory <#> And so <,> there 's an awful lot less training involved and actually getting then up them up to the level that we require to get useful work out of them <#> What we have found with our year students <,> is that <,> a lot a lot of effort <,> on the part of management has to be put in to make sure that they 're aware of everything that is going on <#> It 's only when you bring somebody in and start to try to teach them to be able to take on the project that you realise all the complications and implications that go with the particular work <#> And in a way it 's very useful for <.> man </.> management <,> to have to relearn <,> the processes that they have <,> evolved themselves because that makes us look at all the little problems <,> and uhm iron them out as we go along <#> So there 's a lot of <,> there 's a lot of input that has to be put into the student <,> if <.> fo </.> in order for them to be able to take off and start to produce useful work <,> for us <#> But certainly with the students that we have had we have found that uhm <,> they have initiative <,> they 're able to do projects on their own as long as they are fairly well-controlled <,> they have the energy and the enthusiasm to do that because they themselves are trying to gain something out of that year <#> Out of their year out they are trying to gain uhm you know a <.> l </.> a look into industry <#> Can they work in industry <#> In our case it 's always been yes <#> But can can they can they work to the targets that people set <,> uhm and can people be pleased with their work <#> Because obviously <,> we 're the people that they 're going to use as referees in years to come <,> and they want they want us to be able to say yes <#> This person did very good work for us <#> We think they have great potential in the future <#> And so I think that 's what the student gains <#> But certainly <,> uhm from an employer 's point of view we gain a lot of useful work <,> uhm which <,> uh it and it <.> do </.> there is quite an input that has to be put in from the <.> man </.> the managerial point of view because if a student is left on their own to work uhm <,> they have no idea where the company <,> is wanting to aim with that work <#> They have no idea of the <.> fancial </.> financial implications unless that is all brought over to the student <#> And so certainly there has to be <,> quite a a large managerial input <#> But then if that is put in certainly an awful lot of very useful work comes out on the other side <#> And certainly the students that we have found <unclear> 4 words </unclear> to be very indispensable</I><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-031$B> <#> I 'm delighted to be here and the fact that I <,> had to cancel a meeting in New York <&> laughter </&> and uh was rushed down here <#> Uh the liaison we 've had with the Science Shop has been going on for about <,> maybe three years <#> And when I first <,> I came to the Simon Community <,> I was met with a as usual in the voluntary sector an amazing <,> workload but very few personnel to carry it out <#> Uhm <,> our system 's newly built along uhm east coast with which have one-year contracts <#> Uh they 're very limited at the moment <#> I 'm actually getting a cut in a lot of <,> a lot of organisations <#> So <,> uhm <,> I was looking for areas where I could liaise honestly with the universities <#> Not just the fact that I could get someone to do research but I could also go to the university and give them something in return <,> which is maybe turning up at certain uh places like this giving a an insight into what we 've give the students or doing lectures in the social work department or <,> housing studies et-cetera et-cetera <#> So our initial aim was to give a two-way <,> type of uh relationship <,> the fact that we were not just taking on the students and using them to do a piece of research and then saying thanks very much <,> uhm <,> that 's wonderful <#> All the best <#> What we initially thought is <,> it would have to be two-way so that the <.> s </.> the student has a the conviction and commitment to finish a piece of research <#> Luckily enough in ninety percent <,> ninety-five per cent of the cases that we have taken in over the last three years <,> the research has been excellent <#> And at the moment we 're preparing to <.> pub </.> publish round about three or four <,> uh important pieces of research <,> uh which I will go on and explain <#> For those that obviously don't know what the Simon Community does hopefully youse do or <,> <&> laughs </&> again that 's my own problem <#> Uhm <,> our main aim is to provide accommodation <,> for single homeless people in Northern Ireland <#> Now it 's quite a large task cos there is twenty thousand <,> people who have a homeless difficulty each year in Northern Ireland <#> And <,> the area that we mainly concentrate on or the age group is those between seventeen and sixty-four so it is quite <&> laughter </&> quite a large age group but we do uh limit it down to the fact that you must be single <,> as that 's the age group which does not get uh priority in about eighty-five ninety percent of the cases <,> with Northern Ireland Housing Executive <#> So <,> with that type of demand for our services <,> we have to think of ways <,> of meeting that <#> Now we 've are two main aims <#> One is <,> a provision aim <,> to set up emergency accommodation projects <,> to meet the needs of individuals who are homeless <#> Our other aim 's to campaign <,> to effect <,> change within government bodies <,> people like Mr Shaw Thatcher 's bodies et-cetera to look at the needs of homeless people and <,> do something about it <,> or even understand the pressure that we 're under <#> So there 's ways that we we do this <#> And one of the most important ways <,> is to put forward campaigns which all have to be based in very relevant time like and extremely <,> detailed research <#> And <,> the research is that important that <,> a lot of our <.> op </.> opposition will come back and say well that point was wrong <#> We can't afford that to happen <,> <#> We have to <.> per </.> <.> pre </.> present very credible <,> uh research papers <#> And the thing is <,> when I initially was approached by students and I was thinking God will they will they turn up in the morning to do this piece of research <#> I 've got an interview organised with <,> the director of such and such <#> Cos if they turn up after a night in the Crescent or Lavery 's <,> what am I going to do <#> You know <,> will this really work for me <#> So it was a it was a learning <,> process to begin with and hopefully we sorted all that out <#> And that was due to the fact that I was liaising <,> with uh Ms Farrell from the the Science Shop and <,> we 've struck up a great relationship with Maura Murphy in the Law Faculty and it 's mainly those pieces of research <,> uh that we use at the moment and I 'll go on to explain <#> Now the provision <,> for us to provide that given a piece of uh given accommodation project in an area <,> we need to find out what 's the level of need in that area uh what type of age group it is <,> uh what regions are people homeless in this and that area what 's the population in that area et-cetera et-cetera <#> And to find out if there was a a specific need <#> So that means that the research can back up our provision end <#> It also then has important implications for <,> our campaign end <#> As a <unclear> 1 word </unclear> any given campaign you need to back it up again <,> with the research <#> And at the moment uhm I 've just got an example of some of the research we have <#> Uh round about the end of this month it 's uh Housing Executive 's uh anniversary <#> This <,> this is the year anniversary of taking over responsibility for homelessness <#> And two and a half years ago we produced a publication called Home Truths <#> Now this was produced internally by our own researcher <#> Now the fifth <,> the the second edition analysed in five years is now going to be produced by <,> someone from the Science Shop <#> Now they 've already got the stats <,> and all the recommendations on it for the last four years so the guy is actually employed at the minute somewhere else but he 's still working with us <,> so that in April he comes along for maybe <,> four or five nights a week uh to finish this publication off <#> Now the importance of this is it is the <.> authorita </.> authoritarian <,> uh <,> analysis of homelessness in Northern Ireland <#> And without <,> the liaison with the Science Shop we wouldn't 've got this produced <#> Uhm <,> obviously <,> the what the student needs out of this is on the day hopefully the it 'll probably be launched in here <,> uh in the Canada Room <#> Uh <,> it and the last time we launched it it had TV coverage <,> Inside Ulster <,> uh <.> Ul </.> UTV Live and the person who did the <.> rese </.> research was interviewed <#> That 's important for their career and important for their <,> their own standing in the community and even <,> most importantly for their confidence that they 've done a piece of research <,> which from our point of view will 've some input <,> into changing <,> either legislation or changing attitudes or even informing individuals like yourself of the problems of homelessness <#> Another piece of research which was <.> men </.> mentioned at the very beginning <,> of the <,> the morning was the award-winning piece of research by <,> the Law Faculty <,> and one part of it was for the Simon Community <#> It was entitled uh The Social Fund <,> A Lottery for the Homeless <#> That piece of research at the moment is with the our design team and we 're just ready to finish off <,> and design it <#> It 'll be launched round about <,> well this is is another <unclear> two words </unclear> here round about June nineteen ninety-four <#> Uh hopefully that will be the date we launch it but again <,> <.> the </.> these type of reports would not have come about <,> without the co-operation <,> of the Science Shop without this type of enterprise <#> And for the voluntary sector it 's it 's extremely important to get <,> uh committed individuals to work for us cos as which has been seen throughout all the presentations <,> there 's this one aspect of money <#> And uh <,> like other organisations and like other sectors we are <,> extremely <,> strapped for cash and we need to use <,> or not use but co-operate and uh work with every <,> every type of organisation to make sure at the end of the day we get our goals met without <,> uh expending a lot of money</I>
