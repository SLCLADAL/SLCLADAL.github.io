agreed beforehand, says Late Late host </bold><p> <#> GERRY Adams is an extremely skilled man. <#> He is nobody 's eejit or fool <#> There was absolutely no point put to him on <it> The Late Late </it> that hadn't been put to him a thousand times before. </p><p> <#> I have no regrets. <#> I thought we did it very well. <#> No matter how we did it, it was going to be wrong as far as some people are concerned. <#> It 's up to others to decide who won and who lost. <#> I don't go for this sort of thing. <#> Did Gay Byrne or Gerry Adams win or lose? <#> The proof of the pudding is in the eating. </p><p> <#> Right now, there is a feeling that he did very well. <#> On the other hand, if Gay Byrne had thrown his arms around him there would have been an outcry from the other direction. <#> If we had ignored the past and the 3,000 people <}> <-> people </-> </}> dead, Gay Byrne would have been criticised for having left all that out. <#> I believe strongly that talking about the past is part of the peace process. </p><p> <#> People say I didn't shake hands with him. <#> That 's wrong. <#> I did. <#> And the thing about me standing in front of the audience is wrong. <#> Before the show went on air, I went down to the audience, as I often do, to see who wanted to talk. <#> That 's why I was there when it began. </p><p> <#> The format of the programme was agreed beforehand. <#> We had discussions with Rita O'Hare [Sinn Fein spokeswoman] and he knew who was going to be there. <#> I don't believe he was isolated. <#> The panel was pretty well as balanced as we could get. <#> We had hoped to get Mary Harney on but she thought about it and decided not to but asked that Michael McDowell go on. </p><p> <#> The antipathy shown to him, especially by Hugh Leonard and Austin Currie, represents a point of view held by a huge number of people. <#> I believe that Dermot Ahern and Jim Kemmy did alleviate that. </p><p> <#> If most people say the audience was with Gerry Adams, so be it. <#> I know the audience pretty well on <it> The Late Late. </it> <#> There were no invited people, they were the plain people of Ireland. <#> Roughly half the audience applauded - and it was a weak sort of applause and both sides got it. </p><p> <#> He was very reluctant to talk about personal matters. <#> After the show, he was chatting and joking and incidently told me a story about Joe Cahill. <#> A couple of years ago, I did a New Year 's Eve show and said to the audience: <quote> 'Now I know you are all going to give up smoking and I know too that you 'll all be smoking again tomorrow' </quote> </p><p> <#> Well apparently Joe Cahill, who was smoking 90 a day then and had a heart problem, was watching and because he hates me so much he said <quote> 'F <*> three asterisk signs </*> you you bastard' </quote> and he gave up smoking there and then. <#> Now his heart is stronger than ever! </p><p> <#> We do the hard job on <it> The Late Late </it> : talking about subjects about which people have strong feelings. <#> And long may it continue that way. </p><p> <#> Gerry McNamara 's </p><p> <#> TV verdict, A2 </p></I><I><W2C-013$B><h> <bold> <#> Diceman hangs up his tights </bold> </h><h> <#> Halloween auction for the human statue </h><bold> <#> By Susan McKay </bold><p> <#> THE Diceman told the judge he 'd never wear them again, but someone else can now have that pleasure because the black fishnet tights which led to an indecency conviction in 1991 will be auctioned tonight at a Halloween benefit performance for the 42-year-old street artiste who has had to stop work because of illness. </p><p> <#> <quote> "I can't work. <#> The last gigs I did, clients were complaining: I was having to sit down,"</quote> said Thom McGinty, better known as the Diceman, whose flamboyant costumes and spectacular statuesque stillness have made him a famous part of the street furniture of Dublin, whether advertising a shop or a show, or glamorising the platform of a political parade. </p><p> <#> Street work is his living but he 's choosy about the causes he 'll promote: <quote> "I 'm pro-life - in the real sense" </quote> . </p><p> <#> Thom McGinty is gay and associated with the gay rights movement - for which he created the <it> What 's Another Queer? </it> performance after the murder of a gay man in a Dublin park - and has promoted safe sex in the Department of Health 's Aids awareness campaign. </p><p> <#> The Diceman is credited by groups like Galway-based Macnas as the inspiration for the new, highly visual style of Irish street parade and has been the glamorous centrepiece of arts festival parades all over the country. </p><p> <#> The indecency conviction in 1991 came after he advertised a production of <it> The Rocky Horror Picture Show </it> wearing a G-string and the fishnets. <#> <quote> "The main conention was that I had nothing on underneath, but I did: I had a pair of very fine denier pink tights," </quote> said McGinty. <#> <quote> "I 've worn less: once I had nothing on but for a lot of silver and gold paint and a contraption on my cock. <#> There was no trouble about that: it must be something about fishnets." </quote> </p><p> <#> That episode cost him a few thousand pounds - no small consideration for the Diceman. <#> He 's famous, but he isn't rich. <#> <quote> "As a matter of fact, I 'm badly broke," </quote> he said, wondering whether to have another coffee or get 10 cigarettes. <#> The proceeds of tonight 's benefit will be used to set up a trust fund. </p><p> <#> McGinty has been in Ireland now for 18 years. <#> <quote> "I was born near Glasgow, in a mining village, but I believe I was conceived in Baltinglass, in Co Wicklow ... in the fields. <#> My mother was from there and we used to spend our summers there," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> Studying chartered accounting in Strathclyde University, he became involved in theatre and began to work as a model in art school. <#> <quote> "That trained my stillness and my patience. <#> We had to hold poses for six hours," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> He moved to Ireland in the mid 1970s for a modelling job that didn't transpire. <#> Having sold his possessions, he started posing in a Chinese chrysanthemum jacket - <quote> "like something out of the Mikado" </quote> - in the Dandelion market, holding a piece of brown paper declaring that he was <quote> "in love with the country, unable to gain employment" </quote> . </p><p> <#> Phillip King of Scullion introduced him to Mark O'Brien who had a shop called The Diceman. <#> McGinty was hired to promote it, wearing a royal blue musician 's costume and a turban, and his career took off. </p><p> <#> He has promoted wellingtons in Cyprus (<quote> "it was supposed to be the rainy season but it was blazing sunshine" </quote> ), played the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, headed the St Patrick 's day Parade in Moscow, and was the judge in the Parade of Innocence after the release of the Guildford Four. </p><p> <#> He has been, among other characters, God, the Devil, Dracula, an angel, a clown and Ronald Reagan - the latter two in separate performances, incidentally. <#> <quote> "For company, I prefer the pimps, the prostitutes, the junkies and the thieves to the hypocrites," </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> He 's always been open about being gay, saying: <quote> "I 'm into love and romance. <#> You take guys out and wine and dine them, but it scares them off" </quote> . </p><p> <#> He is now seriously ill and has been for some time. <#> <quote> "It was a big shock," </quote> he said. <#> <quote> "But my condition is stable." </quote> </p><p> <#> He plans to paint masks and watercolours and has acquired a body-building exerciser but jokes: <quote> "The most I 've done with it so far is to carry it home" </quote> .</p><p> <#> Apart from a brief, impoverished spell in Spiddal, he has lived in Dublin. <#> <quote> "It 's been good to me and I love it. <#> Dublin has a centre and a heart. <#> I would like to die on Grafton Street, along by Bewley 's. <#> I 'd be dressed as Cleopatra and escorted by a host of Nubian slaves wearing next to nothing. </p><p> <#> <quote> "Songs are very important to me. <#> Songs like Marianne Faithfull 's 'sister Morphine'," </quote> he said quoting: <quote> "Things

<#> Few clerics answer abuse questionnaire </bold> </h><h> <bold> <#> By David Cronin and Susan McKay </bold> </h><p> <#> MOST bishops and heads of religious orders refused to co-operate in a survey on paedophile priests conducted over the past two weeks by <it> The Sunday Tribune. </it> </p><p> <#> All of the country 's 24 archbishops and diocesan bishops and the 40 religious orders were circulated with a questionnaire on this topic. <#> The questionnaire asked if each bishop and head of religious order had ever received a complaint about alleged child sexual abuse against a priest or religious <}> <-> </-> </}> in their diocese/order. <#> It also asked if the Gardai had been informed about any such cases; if the alleged abuser had been transferred to any other position or recommended for a professional position: and if his futures employers were told about the allegations. </p><p> <#> Five bishops and six heads of religious orders responded. <#> Of the respondent bishops, Bishop John Kirby of Clonfert said that he had been informed of a case of child sexual abuse, from which criminal proceedings ensued, while a spokesman for Bishop Patrick Walsh of Down and Connor said that a case of a priest charged with indecent assault was currently before the courts. <#> Only one provincial of the religious orders contacted said he knew of an alleged child abuse case involving one of his members. <#> He revealed this only on conditon that neither his name nor that of his order would be published. <#> A reply was received from Fr Kevin Smith, the Norbetrine abbot who resigned last week, saying that his attention had never been drawn to any case of paedophilia in his order, other than that of the jailed priest Fr Brendan Smyth. </p><p> <#> Two of the other bishop respondents said that their attention had never been drawn to any such allegations since assuming office. <#> These were the former Bishop of Raphoe Seamus Hegarty, and Bishop John Magee of Limerick, who also said that he had heard of no such allegations in his previous diocese of Cloyne.</p></I><I><W2C-013$D><h> <bold> <#> Terry Rogers buys taxi plates worth <*> pound sign </*> 1m </bold> </h><bold> <#> By Daire O'Brien </bold><p> <#> WELL-KNOWN Dublin book-maker Terry Rogers has become a significant player in the Dublin taxi business with the purchase, over the last year, of almost <*> pound sign </*> 1m worth of taxi plates. </p><p> <#> He has purchased 12 plates and a fleet of London-style cabs. <#> The idea is to rent out a complete "package" to drivers. <#> More specifically, this involves Rogers, and his son Billy, providing drivers with a licensed vehicle regular maintenance, insurance, road tax and a radio. <#> All the driver has to do is drive. <#> Drive a lot in fact. <#> A package like Rogers ', which typically involves two drivers sharing the car, costs in the region of <*> pound sign </*> 700 a week. <#> Typically the person on the day shift will pay slightly less than the night driver. </p><p> <#> On paper this looks like a good deal for Rogers. <#> For an outlay of <*> pound sign </*> 75,000, an owner can expect a return of <*> pound sign </*> 35,000 a year. <#> In reality, however, when the annual cost of leasing, maintenance, radio hire, insurance and road tax is taken into consideration, trade sources say a healthy net return is <*> pound sign </*> 100- <*> pound sign </*> 150 per driver a week. </p><p> <#> Demand for Dublin taxi plates, boosted by the arrival of Rogers as a cash buyer, remains strong, despite a going rate of around <*> pound sign </*> 75,000. <#> With just 1,976 official taxis in existence, plates are rare and the entry costs are high. <#> As well as the cost of the plate, an aspiring taxi driver can expect to spend anything up to <*> pound sign </*> 15,000 on a car, <*> pound sign </*> 3,000 for insurance, <*> pound sign </*> 3,000 to the Carriage Office for the transfer of a plate, <*> pound sign </*> 2,500 a year on maintenance, a further <*> pound sign </*> 2,500 annually on radio hire and last but not least a couple of tankfuls of diesel weekly. </p><p> <#> The perennial danger for owners is that the Government will sanction a new issue of plates. <#> In a market which is extremely sensitive to supply and demand this could cause a sharp fall in the worth of plates. </p><p> <#> The last time taxi plates were issued by the carriage office was in 1992 when 100 new plates were distributed after a lottery was held among the 1,400 qualifying applicants. <#> Not surprisingly, those who had invested large sums in the business were not happy. <#> However a compromise arrangement, where the sale of the new plates was prohibited for five years, was reached.</p><p> <#> The ever present hackney problem, where there are no expensive barriers to entry, is cited as another difficulty by the trade. <#> Taxi drivers are hopeful that legislation will soon be passed which will check the growth of this threat. </p><p> <#> Traditionally, the reason for the spiralling cost of taxi plates has been attributed to the glut of healthy severance payments from the early 1980s. <#> One industry figure points out that owning a taxi is about the only <quote> "job that 's guaranteed for life" </quote> in the age of the multi-skilled employee. </p></I>
