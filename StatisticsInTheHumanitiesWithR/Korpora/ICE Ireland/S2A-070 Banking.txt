<ICE-IRE:S2A-070 Banking><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-070$A> <#> ACC Bank is anxious to assist the Subcommittee in the discharge of its important duties and therefore welcomes the opportunity to to appear of appearing before the Subcommittee today <#> At all times it was the firm policy of the bank to ensure complete compliance with the DIRT legislation <#> At no time did the bank encourage condone or acquiesce in the evasion of DIRT by its customers <#> However as the Subcommittee is aware certain deficiencies in the operation and administration <.> o </.> of the DIRT provisions were identified by the Controller and Auditor General and referred to in his report <#> The bank does not dispute that in some instances individual staff members failed to put into practice the policy of the bank <,> <#> It also acknowledges <,> that with hindsight <,> it appears that greater effort should <.> ave </.> been made by the bank to ensure the implementation at operational level of its policy of compliance <#> The bank accepts that arising from these administrative deficiencies a liability to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of DIRT arose <#> The bank has made a substantial payment <,> amounting to circa one point three four million in respect of this liability <#> The bank is currently seeking to quantify other aspects of its potential liability <#> Currently in common with other financial institutions the bank is the subject of an audit by the Revenue Commissioners <#> Since its foundation the bank has had a presence in areas of high rural emigration <#> Many of those who emigrated <,> decided to retain in some cases to open accounts at the bank <,> which were quite properly classified as non-resident <#> This explains why certain of the bank 's branches had historically held a large number of non-resident accounts in the nineteen eighties <#> The bank for competitive reasons sought to further develop its non-resident <.> ba </.> deposit base <#> The very close relationship between the bank and the agricultural community has a relevance in two distinct ways <#> In the nineteen eighties the agricultural sector was in difficulty <#> This had an immediate and serious effect on the servicing of loans many of which became non-performing <#> In nineteen eighty-seven the bank made a loss of fifteen million <,> uh fifteen million pounds and its survival was in question <#> But for but for support from the Exchequer the bank would have become insolvent <#> As a result of the bank 's <.> statu </.> as a result the bank 's statutory remit was altered in nineteen ninety uh in nineteen eighty-eight and again in nineteen ninety-two which enabled the bank to return to profitability <#> The parlous financial state of the bank at this time was the principal focus of managerial attention and returning the bank to profitability absorbed the bulk of managements ' time and resources <#> The bank did its best to meet the significant demands placed on its manpower and resources by the introduction of DIRT in nineteen eighty-six <#> While it failed to achieve full compliance it is important to emphasise that <.> n </.> at no time did the bank encourage condone or acquiesce in on non-compliance <#> From time to time deficiencies in the bank 's administration of DIRT were identified <,> either by the bank 's internal audit department or by its external auditors <#> All such reports were taken seriously by management <#> An indication of this seriousness was the appointment of a second Deputy Chief Executive in nineteen ninety whose sole responsibility was compliance and control <#> Over the years the bank has continued to make serious efforts to improve its compliance machinery and procedures <#> In nineteen ninety-two the government decided to commence a process which would lead to the bank moving out of State ownership <#> A review of non-resident accounts was one element of the complete review of the bank undertaken by Ernst and Young <#> The statement by Ernst and Young on the first draft of their long form report that the bank could have a potential DIRT liability of up to seventeen point five million pounds has never reflected the true position <#> The figure was never intended to be treated as an actual measure of the bank 's likely liability and this is confirmed by the bank 's <.> b </.> the fact that ACC 's statutory accounts were subsequently approved by Ernst and Young without any provision for such a liability <#> However as a result of the Ernst and Young review the bank took immediate steps to identify all non-resident accounts where there were any deficiencies in the declarations on file <#> As a result of this exercise a number of accounts were reclassified as resident accounts <#> At the time this exercise was being undertaken the Revenue Commissioners made contact with the bank 's external auditors and a meeting took place on the eighteenth of February nineteen ninety-three <#> By reason of what transpired at that meeting the bank undertook understood that the Revenue Commissioners would not seek to exact arrears of DIRT in respect of irregular non-resident accounts for a period prior to the end of nineteen ninety-two provided they were regularised at that stage <#> That is still the position of the bank <#> During the period nineteen ninety-two to nineteen ninety-seven isolated difficulties in relation to DIRT were brought to the attention of management by internal audit and-or the external auditors <#> Where the bank took the view that a liability to DIRT arose on its part <,> an appropriate amount has been included in the payment made to the Revenue Commissioners apart from three instances where this was not done due to an oversight <#> The bank is very concerned by the serious shortcomings which existed in relation to its operation of DIRT as identified in the report of the Controller and Auditor General <#> However the bank is determined to achieve the highest standards of compliance both now and in the future</I><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-070$B> <#> On seventeenth December nineteen ninety or nineteen eighty-seven I was appointed a Director and Chairman of ACC by the Government and remained there until April nineteen ninety-six <#> As you 've heard from Mr Darling the Agricultural Credit Company as it was then Corporation as it was then titled was in very poor financial shape and generally low morale at that time <#> They 've lots of problems <#> Were it not for the Government guarantees it would 've been technically insolvent in December nineteen eighty-seven <,> <#> In such a situation the Government <,> as shareholders would 've been liable under <,> guarantees up for up to six hundred million and all the financial repercussions that would 've brought at the time <#> My role as Chairman was to chair the various meetings of the Board and where necessary advise them on strategy in relation to ACC 's <,> affairs <#> I was also responsible as a <.> res </.> representative <.> th </.> of the board <,> for dealing with external bodies particularly the Government of the day <,> the Department of Finance and where necessary any other representative bodies which needed input from the Board of ACC <#> The Department of Finance always had a senior representative from the Department on the Board at all times <#> The Board of ACC <.> w </.> was responsible for the overall policy and direction of the bank <#> As part of its own responsibilities the Board <,> always in my <,> experience felt a strong obligation to abide by government laws regulations and guidelines <#> During my period as Chairman I 'm quite satisfied that no member of the Board <,> was prepared to tolerate any non-compliance with DIRT or any other regulations <#> The Board was at all times conscious that the ownership of the <,> bank was held by the government on behalf of the Irish people <#> Consequently over the years <,> I believe that compliance had a very priority with the Board and because of that it also had a high priority with management who were seen to make strenuous efforts in order to ensure compliance with current legislation in general and DIRT legislation in particular <#> In eighty-seven ACC was in the unique position as a State-owned credit institution <,> that it could only lend for agricultural purposes but in theory it could accept deposits from any persons or entity regardless of its trade and profession <,> <#> However it wasn't seen as a priority deposit-taking institution by urban dwellers and most of its depositors were in fact rurally based <#> As the ACC could not lend outside agriculture it was placed at a trading <.> ad </.> disadvantage as effectively eighty percent of the population did not wish to deposit with it <.> t </.> it couldn't lend to them <#> At the time were it not for the government guarantees the ACC would have failed <#> In nineteen eighty-eight a new Chief Executive was appointed and under the supervision of the Board of Directors new procedures and controls were devised and implemented in order to restore ACC to profitability <#> The most serious of the initial problems was collecting a large portfolio of advances and loans to customers where the customers themselves were experienced the worst cost price <.> fee </.> squeeze difficulties for many years due to the agricultural crisis <,> and rock-bottom agricultural land prices at that time <#> These difficulties were further compounded by the imposition of quotas particularly in the dairy industry <#> In the years following eighty-eight the Board and the new management team <.> stro </.> strove to change the direction outlook and prospects of ACC from a purely agricultural organisation <,> to one which could be attractive as a financial institution in its own right <#> At that time it was not a bank and reported to the Department of Finance rather than the Central Bank <#> Permission was obtained from the Government to broaden its lending base from agriculture to general industry and commerce over a period of time until in the early nineteen nineties <,> its lending powers were only restricted by its ability to meet prudent solvency margins <#> It progressed thereafter by introduction of normal banking facilities such as current accounts home loans and Visa facilities <#> Its success I think can be measured in its financial results and in the fact that staffing increased <,> over the years from approximately four fifty in eighty-seven to an average of six forty-eight in nineteen <.> ei </.> ninety-eight <#> Through the combined efforts of the Board management and staff <,> the ACC was restored to the profitable entity it is today <#> During that time it paid over thirty million in corporation taxes <,> and in excess of seventeen million in dividends to the government <,> as well as sixty million in DIRT taxes <#> On its privatisation next year it will help to raise hopefully hundreds of millions of pounds for the State <#> This is the corporation which was effectively insolvent in nineteen eighty-seven <#> The Board and senior management of ACC were at all times dedicated to ensuring compliance with the regulations covering DIRT and SACs <#> In this regard <,> the Internal Audit Department was reconstituted in nineteen eighty-eight shortly after my appointment and became an increasingly important part of the bank over the years <,> with a brief to ensure compliance with internal regulation and external legislation <#> During my period as Chairman meetings of the Board of the audit subcommittee of the Board were <.> eld </.> held on at least a quarterly basis to consider reports from Internal Audit Department <#> At those meetings the concerns and recommendations of the Internal Audit Department <,> were fully addressed <#> Senior management was then instructed to ensure compliance where deficiencies had been identified <#> This process and the monitoring of follow up <,> by management and internal audit ensure that the culture of <.> he </.> adherence to regulatory matters prevailed <#> A senior member of management who was the Deputy Chief Executive <,> was the person to whom Internal Audit reported on a day-to-day basis and he also had responsibility for compliance with banking rules and generally for liaison with regulatory authorities <#> The Department <,> the regulatory authorities being the Department of Finance and eventually the Central Bank <#> In the area of compliance ACC for at least two years prior to coming under the regulatory wing of the Central Bank <,> even made voluntary returns on its own initiative to the Central Bank in order to ensure compliance with restrictive banking rules even at a time when we weren't obliged to do so <#> However <,> we wouldn't be here today <,> if it weren't for the fact that at times the best efforts of the Board and management to ensure compliance with all regulations were not one hundred percent successful <#> However I believe that these were exceptions rather than the rule <,> and over the years every effort was made to ensure that the regulations were complied with <,> <#> Thank-you Chairman</I>
