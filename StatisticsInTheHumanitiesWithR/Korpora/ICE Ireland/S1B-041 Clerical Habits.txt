<ICE-IRE:S1B-041 Clerical Habits><I><&> background music </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Today on Clerical Habits I 've come to Corglass Manse outside Bailieborough in County Cavan <,> to the home of the Reverend Florence Taylor <,> Minister of First Bailieborough Coroneary <,> and Trinity Presbyterian Churches <#> Florence 's hobby <,> is keeping horses<&> sound of walking </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Well we 're going up now to the stable yard <#> It was built for me here in part of the old barn <#> And I 'm going to bring my mare in from the field <#> She 's out at grass having a little bit of a holiday at the moment <#> I 'll bring you into the stable <.> in </.> introduce her to you<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> How many horses do you and your son David have<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> We have this young mare <,> a brood mare <,> an old ex-racehorse and a couple of young stock <,> three-year-old and a yearling<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> So then it it is very much a family interest<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Oh very much a family interest <,> yes <#> Now this is the stable <,> a lovely spacious stable<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Right <{1> <[1> so </[1> so very much uh purpose-built for <{2> <[2> you </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2> very much so in one end you see I 've the barn<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> How long have you had the interest<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Oh since I was a very young child <,> about I suppose four or five my first <,> interest in horses <{> <[> developed </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> <[> Starting </[> </{> off with a pony I suppose<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> No I didn't have a pony of my own <#> No I didn't<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> No pony<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> No pony of my own<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> I thought most small girls that 's what <,> what they wanted<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <&> laughs </&> Well you know I used to pray for a pony <,> every night for years I finished my prayers by praying for a pony <,> but the pony never came <#> We weren't a very well-off family so I 'm afraid a pony 's worth <,> it 'd beyond our means so I just rode on other people 's when I got the chance<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Were you self-taught or<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> No no oh no no I wasn't <#> No I at the beginning I rode on other people 's but <,> eventually then I was trained <#> I was trained by Captain Jeremy Beale who was a member of the British Olympic Team <,> for a couple of years <#> I went to him and then I went to Miss Iris Kellett in Dublin for many years <,> and in Kill in County Kildare<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> So once it was in the blood it stayed there<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> It certainly did<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Well let 's go and get this mare <{1> <[1> or rather </[1> I 'll let you <{2> <[2> go and get the mare </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[1> Okay will you </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[2> Yes I 'll go <#> You </[2> </{2> stay in because it 's raining <#> You stay here and I 'll bring her down to you <,,> <&> horse noises </&> <#> There we are <#> Now<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Are you going to introduce us Florence<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Well this is Jenny <,> Padraig <&> laughter </&> <#> Jenny meet Padraig <#> <{> <[> Shake a hoof </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> <[> Hello Jenny </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> We 'll give you a little bit of carrot will we <#> Here <,> chew that<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> She doesn't seem to mind strangers<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> No <,> no she doesn't <#> She was racing this mare <,> before I got her she raced <,> did a few bumpers and a couple of hurdles <,> so she 's got accustomed to people and being out and about <#> She 's a six-year-old little mare <#> She 's a bay mare <,> fifteen two hands high so she 's not very big but big enough for jumping <#> She 's <.> b </.> black mane and tail of course <#> She 's by a Northern-based sire <#> I think he 's dead now perhaps <,> Wren 's Hill <,> and out of a chasing-bred mare so she 's got a little bit of both flat and chasing blood in her <,> and she 's very promising as a show jumper <#> I thought she might 've done dressage but she 's a bit hot for the dressage a bit excitable <,> but good for the show jumping I think<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Which of the disciplines do you prefer<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> My late husband was a great horseman and we used to break <,> in young horses and show them <#> You know so I love showing a horse <,> and I love dressage <,> but three day eventing would be what we 're interested in mostly you know the dressage cross country and the show jumping<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Why is that <#> Is it a combination of all those skills or<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> I think so <,> yes <#> I I 'm not <.> h </.> not really highly competitive at all you know <#> I just enjoy working with them <#> And uhm <,> well I wouldn't like you to think I didn't try my best <#> I love things to be done well and properly but I 'm not going to worry if I don't win <,> as long as the horse goes well as long as I enjoy myself <#> For me that 's the main thing<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> What is it about being out there in the open on on horseback that that uh you find so <,> so enjoyable<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> It 's hard to say Padraig really <#> Uhm <,> I think with riding <,> it 's just being at one with your animal <,> you know having an understanding with an animal and getting the animal to do what you want it to do <#> And it 's very exhilarating <#> Racing for example going at high speed on a horse is very very exhilarating <,> very thrilling<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Now you 've spent a lot of your time down <,> around the Curragh which is<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> That 's right<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> One of the <{> <[> I suppose </[> the most famous<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[> Stop it Jenny </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Parts of the world for horses and racing<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Yes <,> it 's lovely in Kildare <#> My husband uh was <.> r </.> running a stud there for Paddy Prendergast the late Paddy Prendergast <,> and I used to ride out for for four years I rode out on the race horses <,> and that really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring and <,> the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding <#> I found it very thrilling<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> So at that stage you were a wife a mother of two children<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> And a teacher <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> And a teacher <,> and what was it then that was <,> within you do you think that was calling you towards the church or was that something that at that stage didn't make itself <{> <[> evident </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[> No no </[> </{> that was quite dormant at that stage <,> totally dormant <#> I mean of course we were churchgoers and church supporters and so on but <,> entering the church had never <,> entered my mind <,> at that stage<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Well Florence uh life took a dramatic turn for you <,> in nineteen eighty-five when when your husband was killed <,> <{> <[> very suddenly </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[> That 's right </[> </{> yes that 's right <,> uhm it did <#> Frank was killed in an accident <#> He was driving home from work one evening and he met an empty turf lorry <#> And you know how if they 're bringing a very large load of turf <,> they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with <.> st </.> steel or iron supports <,> so those hadn't been properly secured <,> and unfortunately as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car <#> So that was certainly very unexpected and you know quite a shock <#> Took me quite a while to get over that<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> So there you were <,> unexpectantly <,> <{1> <[1> widowed </[1> and two children to <{2> <[2> take care of </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[1> Mhm yes that 's right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[2> Uh huh that 's right </[2> </{2> <#> Well they were <,> pretty well grown up at that time <#> David was in his final year at the Veterinary College so <,> <.> w </.> a bit worried at that time in case it might uh cause him to fail his final exams but fortunately it didn't <#> He got through <#> Sheena of course she was in the working in the Northern Bank at that time <#> She 'd just entered the Northern Bank so <,> they were both really pretty well advanced as regards both education and age<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> How did you set about picking up the pieces<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Well it took some time <#> It took quite a few months actually <#> But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college <#> I 'd always wanted to <,> was never able to because of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say <,> and uhm I just decided this was the chance <#> I would go back to university <#> And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I <,> picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> And what had you thought to do<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Oh yes well I 'd thought of doing either French or music <#> And as I say I just don't know why I ended up doing theology but I did <#> I don't think anybody suggested it to me <#> I presume it was just <,> God 's prompting if you like but I ended up doing theology <,> and enjoyed it<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become <,> more actively involved in the church<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy <#> And uhm I enjoyed doing that <#> But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time <,> occupation as I until my final year and then people said <,> you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church <#> And then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted <,> well and good <#> And that 's just how I did it<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> So then what was the the next stage in your career<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Well uhm I applied then <,> uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it <,> and I was <.> a </.> accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> As you were thinking about the church and what might happen you must 've also had to bear in mind that uh you know you had <,> two children <,> who were growing <{> <[> up </[> but also you had uh <,> your horses and you had your other outside interests and how you were going to blend all of those<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> That was difficult <,> very difficult <#> I remember at one of my interviews <,> one of the interviewers suggesting that perhaps I might give up <,> my horses <#> And so well I sort of <.> s </.> I just said him I said well have you given up your hobby <#> He was a very keen golfer actually which of course he hadn't <#> So I <.> s </.> I just said well I I certainly wouldn't dream of giving up either my horses or my dogs <#> They 're part of my life so <,> it made it made more difficult <,> definitely more difficult because you can't just move around the country with a couple of horses and three or four dogs very easily<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> How long have you been here in Bailieborough now<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Just three months <,> exactly three months <#> Stop it Jenny<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> This horse <{> <[> I think it 's hungry </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[> It could chew my coat yes </[> </{> <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> I think she 's she 's uh <{> <[> telling us something </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[> And her just off the grass yes </[> </{> <#> I don't know what it is <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> So it 's I suppose it 's ideal for you <{> <[> here is it </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> <[> It is </[> </{> <#> Yes it is and it 's very near my own home you see which is eleven miles away <#> Yes it 's lovely here<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> Tell us something about the parish here<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$B> <#> Well in Bailieborough we have three churches <,> one just in the town and two in the country <#> The Manse of course is also in the country <,> and I 've got about a hundred and thirty families to look after <#> Quite a number of elderly folk but also <,> quite a number of young folk children and young married people <#> This mare is <{> <[> determined determined to </[> eat me isn't she or eat my coat <#> Yes quite a number of young people and children coming on so it 's very promising <,> for the future I think <#> We 've a big horse show here in Bailieborough in July and <,> quite a number of people roundabout interested in show jumping as such and horses <,> and very good relations with other you know churches in the community which is marvellous too <,> very very good relationships<ICE-IRE:S1B-041$A> <#> <[> This horse is <,> is hungry </[> </{></I>
