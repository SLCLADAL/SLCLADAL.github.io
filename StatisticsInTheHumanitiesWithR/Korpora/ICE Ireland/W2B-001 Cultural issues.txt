<W2B-001 Cultural issues><I><W2B-001$A><h> <#> <bold> OUT OF STEP </h> </bold><h> <bold> <#> P&/ol O Muir&/i </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> A report on the Irish language published last month by the Committee on the Administration of Justice is the latest to argue that the right to speak Irish should be a civil one, not a government favour. </bold> </p><p> <#> The CAJ calls upon the British government to sign the European Charter for Regional or Minority Language and adopt a more positive policy towards the Irish language, <quote> "as it has toward the two other living Celtic languages in the United Kingdom, Welsh and Scots Gaelic" </quote>. <#> The charter, adopted in June 1992 by a substantial majority of the ministers ' deputies of the Council of Europe, offers a bill of rights for speakers of minority and regional languages. </p><p> <#> The report 's conclusion is measured, intelligent and reasonable, and contains much which Irish speakers would support. <#> Yet it is very unlikely the government will implement even a fraction of the recommendations. </p><p> <#> The charter, says the CAJ, guarantees the right to use minority languages in the public sphere - in schools, in courts, in dealings with administrative authorities and public services, and in economic and social life. <#> It reflects the latest thinking in the international human rights community on linguistic rights, as a facet of minority rights. <#> And its <quote> "proactive" </quote> approach is a useful tool for the Irish language community in pressing for government support. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The history of discrimination faced by the Irish language merits and appropriate response from the government. <#> The European Charter provides a mechanism for beginning to redress the complaints of Irish language activists. <#> It would also keep the British government in step with its European partners," </quote> the report says. </p><p> <#> Yet this government is not much bothered about keeping in step with Europe. <#> Its attitude remains to do as little as possible, as seldom as possible. <#> It has still to rescind the Miscellaneous Provisions Act, which prohibits erection of Irish street signs - and is in no rush to do even that. </p><p> <#> The Northern Ireland Office stresses its support for Irish-language education. <#> But practitioners retail countless stories of prevarication and uninterest from government bodies, who seem intent on moving the goalposts whenever possible. </p><p> <#> Failure to sign the charter would be another example of this indifference - an indifference shared by the Dublin government, which has also yet to sign up. <#> To accept even some paragraphs would, however, be a worthwhile start, proving just how seriously Stormont regards its duty to the Irish language. </p></I><I><W2B-001$B><h> <#> <bold> TRIAN TELLS THE ARMAGH STORY </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Northern Ireland <#> Easter Special <#> by Clare Ogle </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> EARLIER this month a year-long celebration entitled 'Armagh Together' got off to an auspicious start in the city 's newest tourist development. </bold> </p><p> <#> Appropriately, the launch-pad for this cross-community marketing initiative was St Patrick 's Trian which opened in Armagh 's English Street in October last year. <#> This interpretive centre tells 'The Armagh Story' covering the city 's history from its prehistoric period to the Georgian era. </p><p> <#> Armagh District Council Marketing Assistant, Karen Houlahan, explained the significance of the word Trian (pronounced Tree an). </p><p> <quote> <#> "In ancient times Armagh was divided into three areas. <#> Trian is Irish for three, and the area where this centre is located was in fact one of those 'trians'. </p><p> <#> "As well as 'The Armagh Story' which takes the visitor from pre-Christian times to modern day, St Patrick 's Trian also has a children 's fantasy area, The Land of Lilliput, based on Jonathan Swift 's book, Gulliver 's Travels, which was partially written in Armagh." </quote> </p><p> <#> The size of the new tourist attraction is deceptive. <#> If approached through the Tourist Information Centre on English Street, it suddenly mushrooms in front of the visitor after passing through the courtyard at the rear of the TIC. <#> Visitors also have direct access to the new centre from the adjacent car park. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Naturally St. Patrick 's Trian will play a big part in the year-long 'Armagh Together' celebration with over 200 events taking place to commemorate St Patrick coming to Armagh 1,550 years ago. <#> Hence the opening of St Patrick's TRIAN in time for the launch of Armagh Together," </quote> said Karen. </p><p> <#> Other characters who played a significant role in Armagh 's history line up to meet visitors at the entrance to 'The Armagh Story'. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Firstly, we have the life-size figure of John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church who preached in Armagh many times. <#> He looks quite diminutive, but he was in fact just five feet tall," <quote> explained Karen. </p><p> <quote> <#> "There is also a scribe who would have played an important part in Armagh 's history and Dr William Crolly who was foremost in the construction of the Roman Catholic Cathedral around 1840. <#> The 'modern visitor' figure of the Italian tourist symbolises all of the tourists we hope to welcome to St Patrick 's TRIAN and indeed the whole area. <#> Close to the exhibition entrance is a suitably fierce Celtic warrior, guarding the dolmen tomb which is the starting point for the visitor 's journey to rediscover the story of Belief - the story of Armagh." </quote> </p><p> <#> And as we entered the dolmen tomb, thought to have been used for burial purposes, and with audio-visual aids and haunting Clannad-type music, the story of the life and rituals of prehistoric man began to unfold. </p><p> <quote> <#> "The next chamber contains a model of the original Navan Temple. <#> Navan, in pre-Christian times, was the political and spiritual capital of Ulster. <#> The wrap-around murals tell the story of Navan Fort - Emain Macha - and the mighty Irish warrior, Cu Chulainn," <quote> Karen explained. </p><p> <#> In the 5th century AD, St Patrick came to Armagh where local chieftain, Daire, gave him a site on which to build a church. <#> After the chieftain 's own conversion to Christianity, a prestigious hilltop site was granted and this is where the Church of Ireland Cathedral stands today. </p><p> <quote> <#> "In this next section, the story of St. Patrick, who came to Armagh around 444 AD, is told. <#> Visitors learn of the success and the consequences of his work and of the story of St Patrick and the fawn on the hill where the Roman Catholic Cathedral now stands. <#> We have two cathedrals of course in Armagh, both named after St Patrick. <#> Further along there are excerpts taken from the Book of Armagh which was written around 807. <#> Unfortunately we don't have the Book of Armagh here as it is in Trinity College Dublin, but we do hope to get a replica of it," </quote> said Karen. </p><p> <#> In the next chamber, the visitor comes upon scenes of terror as marauding vikings pillage and burn. <#> The impact of viking raids was widely felt during the 9th and 10th centuries with Armagh being destroyed repeatedly. <#> A replica of an ancient Celtic Cross dating from the 11th century (the original can be seen in the Church of Ireland Cathedral) bears witness to scenes of terror as mothers attempt to protect children and monks seek to save church treasures. <#> A wall panel gives details of viking raids carried out in the area. </p><p> <#> The visitor next comes to a series of church windows which light-up in sequence as the story of Armagh moves on through medieval times, the Reformation and finally leads the visitor into present-day Armagh. </p><p> <#> The last life-size character to introduce himself is <quote> "architect and humble servant" </quote> Francis Johnston. </p><p> <quote> <#> "He was responsible for many of the fine Georgian buildings that exits in Armagh today including the impressive Court House which is currently under renovation. <#> Visitors may wonder at his incredibly life-like face with moving mouth and different facial expressions. <#> His 'face' is actually blank and an image is projected onto the model which is really ingenious and quite realistic," <quote> said Karen. </p><p> <#> The last sequence of colourful murals pick out other attractions in the area that are worth a visit - Navan Fort, The Palace Stables Heritage Centre, the National Trust properties - The Argory and Ardress House, the Observatory and the Planetarium. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Incidentally, the Planetarium has two new projects underway - an Astropark which has already opened and the Eartharium which officially opens in July," </quote> Karen pointed out. </p><p> <#> As visitors exit 'The Armagh Story' they come to the craft shop, before setting off along the Granary Mall, the full length of which is dedicated to the Allison Collection of historical photographs. <#> Leaving history behind, the Mall leads to the land of the little people, a constructed castle where a gigantic Gulliver recounts his adventures in the Land of Lilliput. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Children are just so amazed when they see the size of Gulliver in comparison to the tiny Lilliputians," </quote> added Karen. <quote> <#> "They 're completely mesmerised as they listen to this friendly giant tell tales of his adventures with the little people." <quote> </p><p> <#> The final port of call for many will probably be the Pilgrim 's Table Restaurant which has a charming conservatory/patio area for al fresco eating on warm days. <#> Notice the marble inlaid plaque marking a visit by Jacques Delours, President of the European Commission on November 3, 1993. </p><p> <#> The EC President was one of the early visitors to St Patrick 's Trian. <#> By mid-February this year 11,000 people had heard 'The Armagh Story' and shared in Gulliver 's adventures. <#> With a packed year ahead celebrating 'Armagh Together' many thousands more are certain to be drawn to the Trian to learn about Armagh's rich heritage.</p></I><I><W2B-001$C><h> <#> <bold> A CHIP OFF THE OLD . . . </h><h> <#> THE COUNTRY RHYMES OF JAMES ORR </h><h> <#> <bold> THE BARD OF BALLYCARRY 1770 - 1816 </bold> </h><p> <#> DAN Quayle can say goodbye to the White House and fade into obscurity safe in the knowledge that he was, after all, correct about the common spud! </p><p> <#> The man who once described a group of Samoans as <quote> "happy campers" </quote> and told his supporters that if they did not succeed they ran the risk of failure, thought he was helping out in a school quiz.</p><p> <#> He spelled it POTATOE and squirmed when the world 's media ridiculed him - but it now emerges that the retiring vice-president of the United States got it right. </p><p> <#> In some eyes at least. </p><p> <#> And it is the writings of a once well-loved Ulster poet whose verses are re-published today which may help save Quayle 's face. </p><p> <#> The very first poem in <bold> The Country Rhymes of James Orr </bold> (Pretani Press, <*> pound sign </*> 5.99) is called "To the Potatoe" . </p><p> <#> And Orr, a United Irishman who took part in the 1798 Rebellion and then renounced violence, had got the spelling of the vegetable correct - down to the final letter. </p><p> <#> He was writing in the broad Scotch (braid Scotch) which has now been pronounced a lesser-used language by the European Community. </p><p> <quote> <#> "And it was the folk poets of Ulster who were spelling the word properly," </quote> says Dr Philip Robinson of the Ulster Folk Museum, editor of the new edition of the Orr book. </p><p> <quote> <#> "What happened to change the spelling in the English language later isn't the fault of James Orr or Dan Quayle." </quote> </p><p> <#> The politician, George Bush 's sidekick through thick and thin for the past four years, has been sent a copy of the book. </p><p> <#> Philip Robinson and Pretani Press await his comments with interest. </p><p> <#> Perhaps if Dan 's vindication had come a little sooner there might have been a few more votes cast in the direction of the Bush-Quayle camp in the Presidential election! </p><p> <#> There is currently an upsurge of interest in the Ulster-Scots language, particularly among the young of the province who are researching their roots. </p><p> <#> The Ulster-Scots Language Society has been formed - and is flourishing - to give the Ulster-Scots tongue new age respect. </p><p> <#> And an Ulster-Scots dictionary is being prepared which will be introduced into schools along with literature in the language, like the folk poems of Orr. </p><p> <#> Around Carrick, Ballymena, Greyabbey and some other places where Ulster-Scots trips off the tongue easily to this day, the dictionary won't be required. </p><p> <#> Born in a thatched cottage in Ballycarry, Co Antrim, Orr was taught weaving by his father. <#> He wrote his first verses as a boy at Ballycarry Presbyterian meeting house. </p><p> <#> His parents educated their only son at home to ensure a strict Calvinistic upbringing. <#> He wrote a poem called A Parent 's Flinty Heart to express his disapproval of his father and mother 's restrictive views. </p><p> <#> But they couldn't stop him straying into the United Irishmen. </p><p> <#> After the '98 Rebellion young Orr fled across the Atlantic to New England and, like many of his contemporaries, took with him Ulster 's own varieties of the potato (or potatoe?). </p><p> <#> Within a year James was back home. <#> He preferred to be among the people and the places he wrote about. <#> But he did have poems published in America and earned some critical acclaim. ........ </p></I>
