<W2C-020 Tipperary Star><I><W2C-020$A><h> <bold> <#> Major Jobs Boost for Thurles </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> THE town of Thurles received a major jobs boost yesterday, Tuesday, with the announcement that the Government has approved the making of a research and development grant of <*> pound sign </*> 575,000 to Erin Foods Manufacturing Ltd. </bold> </p><bold> <#> By Anne O'Grady </bold><p> <#> The announcement was made by the Minister for Environment and Education, Mr Michael Smith, T.D., who stated that full implementation of the global investment package will result in the creation of 134 new jobs over the period 1993-1997. <#> Over thirty-one of these jobs are already in place. </p><p> <#> Minister Smith expressed his delight that the Government were supporting this <quote> "thriving indigenous industry" </quote> in Thurles and he congratulated the management and workforce who had contributed enormously to this significant development. </p><p> <#> The news has also been welcomed by the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator Michael O'Kennedy who said he was happy that Thurles was enhancing its standing as the centre of the added value area in the food processing sector. </p><p> <#> The grant, which is being made available through Shannon Development, will go towards meeting the cost of an eligible research and development programme. <#> Minister Smith stated that an integral part of Erin Foods; development strategy was the implementation of a major research and development programme and a detailed product development programme had been prepared and was being implemented in two phases. </p><p> <#> Mr Smith said that, in addition, a number of facilities in the form of capital aid for which Government approval was not required were being made available by Shannon Development to Erin Foods. <#> These included a new industry grant of <*> pound sign </*> 132,000 towards the cost of eligible building works, a new industry grant of <*> pound sign </*> 414,960 towards the cost of eligible plant and machinery and an equity subscription of <*> pound sign </*> 500,000 (ordinary shares) in Greencore Plc. </p><p> <#> He added that the project had the backing of the National Food Centre and he confirmed that Greencore Plc were a party to the agreement. </p><p> <#> Mr Smith said the company 's drive in recent years for higher quality, added value products and the major successes which it had received on the export market had been instrumental in achieving this progress. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It is worthwhile to note that as recently as four years ago the company was only exporting seven or eight percent of its produce and now, in an increasingly competitive market, their export achievement has reached 33 <*> percent sign </*> of produce. <#> In the teeth of international competition they have gained a significant foothold with prestigious UK companies. <#> Needless to say, the boost in jobs is a very welcome development for Thurles. <#> The knock-on effect of this level of investment for the town is going to be substantial and the people of Thurles can look forward to a period of further growth and prosperity in the years ahead", </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile, Sentator O'Kennedy described the development as very major and said it was part of the culmination of the research and development which they had been promoting. <#> The new development, he said, would deal with nutritionally balanced meals and recipe formations and would take Erin Foods into an entire new market niche. <#> It was the latest in high technology and represented a very substantial investment of over <*> pound sign </*> 1 million at this point.</p><p> <quote> <#> "It is all very positive in that it represents a diversification into the value added area in the food processing sector which I was always very anxious to see promoted there and I very much welcome the culmination of this effort. <#> It was always said under the Sugar Company that they would commit themselves to ongoing development there and I am glad to see it being brought to fruition", </quote> he said. </p><p> <#> Saying it was a very exciting development, he complimented the management and staff and said the whole approach to the development was very positive. <#> He was very happy that Thurles was <}> <-> re-inforcing </-> <+> reinforcing </+> </}> its reputation as the centre of the added value area in the food processing sector. </p><p> <#> Councillor Frances Boyle, a Chamber of Commerce representative on Thurles Urban Council last night welcomed the news and congratulated all concerned. <#> She added that Thurles could do with more such good news. </p></I><I><W2C-020$B><h> <bold> <#> Gardai alert after Cashel raid </h> </bold><bold> <#> By John Guiton </bold><p> <#> A TRAVELLING gang operating in the Munster region is thought to be responsible for a number of break-ins to filling stations, their latest target being the Esso station at Cahir Road, Cashel, in the early hours of Monday morning last. <#> The thieves got away with <}> <-> approximagely </-> <+> approximately </+> </}> <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 in cash. </p><p> <#> Gardai are carrying out extensive investigations into the incident that occurred at the Esso station and shop, which is located on the outskirts of the town. <#> The gang used cutting equipment to gain access to the premises through the roof and then made their getaway with the substantial amount of money. </p><p> <#> The robbery was carried out with clinical precision and Gardai believe that a number of people were involved in the incident. <#> It is the latest in a series of break-ins to filling stations in the Tipperary-Cork area and Gardai believe that it could well be the work of the same gang who raided stations in Fermoy and Tipperary recently. </p><p> <#> A Garda spokesman said that every effort is being made to try and apprehend those responsible for the robberies, but he urged owners of filling stations and business premises to be extra vigilant, especially in the run-up to Christmas. <#> The Cashel premises was unoccupied at the time of the break-in. </p><p> <#> The Garda spokesman said that it is obvious that the gang use heavy equipment to break into premises and he called on the public to report any kind of suspicious sightings without delay. </p><p> <#> Gardai in Cashel investigating Monday morning 's incident are anxious to hear from anybody who passed by the filling station in the early hours of the morning and may have seen anybody behaving in a suspicious manner. </p><p> <#> The Gardai are also interested to hear from anybody who may have seen a <}> <-> vahicle </-> , <+> vehicle </+> </}> or vehicles, parked in a suspicious manner in the town or on <}> <-> it 's </-> <+> its </+> </}> outskirts. </p><p> <#> All information will be treated in the strictest confidence. </p></I><I><W2C-020$C><h> <bold> <#> Wife in fear of husband </h> </bold><p> <#> A MAN who visited his wife 's premises and allegedly put her <quote> "in fear" </quote> was handed out two prison sentences of six months each, but Judge Mary Martin, at Templemore court, when she convicted him of contravening two protection orders. </p><p> <#> Massimo Conte, 89, Pinewood

of the house by Marina Conte. <#> She informed witness that her husband Massimo Conte was on the premises and that she wanted him removed. <#> She stated that she had a protection order against him. <#> Witness informed defendant that he was not supposed to be on the premises. <#> Defendant tried to put up a case and he (witness) arrested him and conveyed him to the Garda station. <#> Later he

</bold><p> <bold> <#> THERE could not have been a better location in which to launch a Muintir na Tire report on rural Tipperary communities than the breathtakingly beautiful but stark landscape of the Glen of Aherlow. </bold> </p><bold> <#> By Mary Hassett </bold><p> <#> Guests at last Monday 's launch looked out from the plush surrounds of the Aherlow House Hotel to the magnificent hills and reflected on the people who are struggling to make a life for themselves in similarly rugged and isolated surroundings throughout North and South Tipperary. </p><p> <#> Some people may have imagined that Muintir na Tire was dead in all but name but the organisation founded in 1937 is determined to prove that it is as relevant today as on the date of its foundation. <#> The organisation founded by Tipperary priest Canon John Hayes has always sought to respond to the needs of communities and parishes and to be forthright and innovative in its approach. </p><h> <bold> <#> FOUR PARISHES </bold> </h><p> <#> Perceiving the growing need to develop new strategies for creating employment which would both support and complement local development objectives Muintir na Tire commissioned a preliminary study of four communities/parishes throughout North and South Tipperary. <#> The parishes involved were Templederry and Moyne-Templetuohy an North Tipperary and Fethard and Cappawhite in South Tipperary. <#> The study was carried out on behalf of Muintir na Tire by Murphy, Ryan <*> ampersand <*> Associates Ltd., Management and Human Resources Consultants in Limerick. <#> The study was funded in part by Tipperary Leader Group Ltd. </p><p> <#> The focus of the study was to examine the potential of each community to create an enterprise environment which would contribute to employment opportunities at local level. </p><p> <#> The outcome of the study quite clearly indicated that while potential exists to a degree within each community ongoing and focussed community development will be required in order to achieve the enterprise ambition. <#> It is proposed that the optimum enterprise environment will include a working partnership arrangement between the community, local authority and all statutory / voluntary agencies relevant to each community. </p><p> <#> Careful community planning will be required in order to ensure that wherever possible all sectors of the community will be represented or given the opportunity to participate in all decision making and development. </p><h> <bold> <#> DECLINING POPULATION </h> </bold><p> <#> The study showed that Cappawhite, Templederry and Moyne-Templetuohy all have a declining population. <#> The most alarming decline has taken place in Templederry which now has a population of 1116 which is 25 <*> percent sign </*> of what it was in 1901. <#> The population has decreased by 6 <*> percent sign </*> between 1986 and 1991. </p><p> <#> The population in Moyne-Templetuohy has declined by 7 <*> per cent sign </*> between 1986 and 1991 while the decrease has been more than 10 <*> percent sign </*> in Cappawhite over a similar period. <#> In contrast the population in Fethard increased by 11 <*> per cent sign </*> between 1981 and 1986 with a further slight increase between 1986 and 1994. </p><p> <#> The study shows that 50 <*> per cent sign </*> of the population in all four parishes is dependant i.e. is under eighteen or over sixty-five. <#> Unemployment appears to be low as people in all four parishes have left the area rather than remain unemployed. <#> A significant percentage of the workforce are employed outside the parishes on either a long or short term basis. </p><p> <#> The report concluded that community activity and involvement exists within each of the four parishes. <#> However this is at different levels of development. <#> Potential exists for further development including the introduction of enterprise for the purpose of offering job opportunities to young people as an alternative to leaving the parish to achieve employment. <#> The development of the tourism industry is possible in each of the four parishes. <#> This will require care, planning, coordination, direction and participation. </p><h> <bold> <#> COMMUNITY PLAN </bold> </h><p> <#> It is proposed that a Community Plan be developed within each area which would address the issue of integration and enterprise. <#> It is felt that a representative umbrella organisation should be introduced or strengthened in each area. </p><p> <#> Speaking at the launch the President of Muintir na Tire, Jim Quigley called on the incoming Government to give Muintir na Tire the necessary financial resources to employ Development officers on a national basis. <quote> <#> 'Rural society must be preserved, stabilised and developed so as to avoid a social and economic imbalance between rural and urban', </quote> stated the Toomevara born President who has been living in Dublin for more than 30 years. <quote> <#> 'The study we are launching today is, in our opinion, a way of preserving one area of rural society within EU and national policies', </quote> he stated. </p><p> <#> Ms. Wendy Ryan, Murphy, Ryan <*> ampersand </*> Associates Ltd., highlighted the energy, dedication and enthusiasm of local people in all four communities. <#> She formally presented a copy of the report to Jim Quigley. </p><p> <#> Former MEP and champion of rural Ireland over a lifetime Mr T. J. Maher officially launched the report. <#> He highlighted the fact that Canon Hayes had promoted a philosophy of self help which will have to remain to the forefront if rural Ireland is to survive and prosper. </p></I>
