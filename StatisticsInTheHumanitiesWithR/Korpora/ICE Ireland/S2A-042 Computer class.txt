<ICE-IRE:S2A-042 Computer class><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Now the last day we were discussing uh the application software <#> So uh what do we understand by <mention> application software </mention> Madeleine<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Right and what do they do uh Pauline<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$D> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Pardon <#> Uh Polly<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$D> <#> I wasn't here <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Well you should know <,> you should know <#> What is the <,> what actually is application software <#> How would you describe it<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$E> <#> Uhm the the uh the software that carries out the different tasks<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> That 's right <#> Application software uh enables the computer to carry out a specific task <,> as opposed to system software uh which is the operating system <#> Okay <#> So application software <,,> <&> writes on board </&> enables the computer to carry out a specific task <#> Okay <#> So as Madeleine mentioned there <,> we have different types of uh different programmes uh which come under the heading <.> app </.> of application software <#> We 've word processing <,> spreadsheets <,> database <,> accounts <,> stock control <,> payroll <,> et-cetera <#> These are all known as business applications <#> Okay <#> Business applications <,,> <#> Now again under the heading of application software we have uh what is known as package software <,> application packages which can be bought off the shelf <#> Now these are programmes that uh are used by uh the general public if you don't need a special programme to carry out the work for you <#> Okay <#> So that is known as uh uh application packages <,,> <&> writes on board </&> <&> laughter </&> <#> Now as well as these application packages uhm we have special-purpose software <#> Okay <#> Special-purpose application software <#> Now this is software <,> application software <,> which is specially written to suit the needs of a particular company <#> Okay <#> Specially written to suit the needs of a particular company <#> Now large <,> we 'll take large manufacturing companies that uh have we 'll say integrated software especially <,> uh to meet their needs <#> That means that some of the application uh programme or software enables the computer to uh cover the task in hand from the time the raw material will come in the door to the time that the manufactured product goes out the other door <#> So every entry that was made uh using that software will update different files <#> Okay <#> So this type of software is specially written because the needs of companies vary from one company to another <#> Okay <#> That is special-purpose <#> Okay <#> Now we 've dealt with the uhm word processing <,> okay <#> So in a nutshell uhm Anna <,> what are the basic features of a word processor<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$F> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> So what kind of editing have we Madeleine<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> insert<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Right <,> okay<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$B> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> copying<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Right <#> Copying <#> Right <#> And uh also what other features have we Madeleine<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$B> <#> Spellcheck<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Spellcheck <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$E> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Now what about formatting <#> Formatting the document Pam<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$G> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> So what is involved in formatting our document<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$E> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> What does formatting a document mean <#> Anybody<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$E> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> That 's right <#> Setting margins <,> top margin <,> bottom margin <,> left and right <#> Okay <#> Setting tabs <,> uh setting the size of the page <,> centring <,> all that <,> involves formatting the document <#> It 's the layout of a document <#> Okay <#> Then we have enhancements as well <,> which uh Noreen <#> Enhancements<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$H> <#> Bold<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Bold print <,> that 's right <#> Jenny <#> Underlining<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$I> <#> Italics<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Italics <#> That 's right <#> So there are of the <#> Yes Olwyn<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$J> <#> Increase the size of it<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> That 's right <,> the size of different fonts <#> Okay <#> Now always remember that if you change the <.> si </.> the size of the font you must have a printer that is going to print it out successfully <#> Okay <#> Some printers uh uh will not print it out <#> Okay <#> So you that 's something that you need to watch <#> But generally in business if you are doing that kind of work you will have a printer that will print out your different size of fonts <#> Okay<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$E> <#> The uhm actually the printers over across the way don't <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> don't<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Well any dot matrix will <#> Unless that the program is <,> the the actual file is missing off the program <#> Okay <#> Now we 'll take WordPerfect for example <#> You <,> within the WordPerfect programme you 've different files that control different actions <#> Okay <#> Like for example printing out different uh size uh fonts <,> underlining <,> bold print <,> et-cetera <#> Different printers you 've a file of printers so WordPerfect controls it as well as the printer <#> Now if you have a dot matrix printer <,> most dot matrix printers today will print out the large font <#> You mightn't get the quality <#> To get the quality you need a <.> la </.> either a laser printer or an inkjet <#> Okay <#> So uhm that is another feature of word processor and then of course <,> uh Breda <,> anything else<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$K> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Yes well <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> cover that now <#> Now any other features now apart from these editing uh features<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$E> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Yeah a word wrap yeah that is <#> Word wraparound is automatic carriage return <#> Okay <#> So all word processors have that <#> Now we have of course we 've mailmerge uh for standard letters and then we have which we went over the last day with uh standard paragraphs which is known as collating or document assembly <#> Okay <#> Now uh document assembly is the construction of one document from a number of standard paragraphs <#> Now these paragraphs are stored <#> Okay <#> They 're stored either in a separate file <,> some word processors have what is known as a library <,> other word processors have uh what is known as a glossary <#> Now there are two meanings to the word glossary <#> A glossary can be uh like a dictionary to explain different terms <#> You get a glossary at the end of your book <#> But a library for stored paragraphs is also known as a glossary <#> Okay <#> So uh these uh frequently used paragraphs are stored in we 'll say a glossary <,,> <&> writes on board </&> or <,> a library <#> Now <,> if your word processor hasn't a glossary or a library you can use a different directory for these stored paragraphs <#> You can make a directory to put these paragraphs into <#> Now that is the way you organise your files <,> especially in business where you are using a hard disk and all your programmes are in different directories <#> They 're in sub-directories <#> Okay <#> Now you can have a sub-directory for your documents <,> for example all your letters and your reports et-cetera <#> And to distinguish <,> we 'll say <,> between reports and letters depending on the type of business you have you can put an extension onto the end of the file name <#> Now as I said before uh a file name contains uh a maximum of eight characters <#> You cannot have more than eight characters in a file name <#> Plus an extension of three characters with a dot between them <#> Okay <#> So if you want to identify any <,> your documents in their own directory you could give them a name <,> and put in your dot <,> and give them a three letter extension <,> okay <,> to identify uhm your document <,> whatever that may be <#> You can <.> devi </.> uh you could devise or in a company these would be standard <#> Okay <#> These would be standard practices <,> and of course then for your standard paragraphs <,> your frequently-used paragraphs <,> they could be in a directory of their own <#> Okay <#> And of course they could have uh the their extension as well <#> Now uh another day I will uh go through uh the directories with you <#> As I said uh previously we 'll do that on the computers themselves because in theory <,> it 's difficult to understand them unless you do them <#> So uh we 'll do that on the machines <#> Okay <#> Because there is always a path leading to a directory <#> Okay <#> If you have <,> we 'll say a letter <,> in <,> we 'll say a document directory <,> you could make a sub-directory called a document directory <,> well you 've to go through the path to lead to that directory if you want to call up the <.> dir </.> the directory to see if a certain document is there <#> So all these uh sub-directories lead from the root directory through another directory <,> we 'll say through WordPerfect onto a document directory and on through to we 'll say uhm uh paragraph directory you could call it paragraph or something like that <,> okay <#> So that 's uh uh uh a job for another day <#> We 'll do it on the machines <,> okay <#> Where you 'll be able to understand it better <#> Now <,> again with the application software I think we 've covered uhm most of the features <#> We covered them the last day anyway uhm as well as the word uh processor we have uhm the spreadsheet <#> Now we should all know what the spreadsheet is <#> Jenny would you describe what a spreadsheet is<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$I> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Now I 'm here Jenny and you 're there <,> I never heard of a spreadsheet <,> okay <#> So you 're telling me now what a spreadsheet is <#> If you could describe it clearly <#> What about you Noreen<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$H> <#> Uhm it 's a it 's a sheet with rows and columns<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> That 's right <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$H> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> do whatever you want with<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> What kind of things would you do Noreen<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$H> <#> Uhm analyse the trends or <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Yeah uhm Belinda <,> have you anything to add<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$L> <#> It 's a worksheet that 's done on a computer <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Right <,> yeah <#> And<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$L> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> give you results <,> you can draw graphs <,> pie charts <,> and stuff like that<ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Right there 's something very important uhm something important that we 're forgetting<&> several people speak simultaneously </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-042$A> <#> Yeah the computer calculates automatically <,> and at the end of the day <,> because we are using formulas <,> okay <,> this makes it possible to change any figure within the spreadsheet and any total that that figure will affect will change automatically <,> that is the power of the spreadsheet <#> Now uhm before we had computers and before we had electronic spreadsheets uh these spreadsheets were done on a large sheet of paper <#> They were ruled down uh vertically and horizontally and at every intersection a box was formed <#> Okay <#> Now you can think of that box when you move the cursor in your spreadsheet it 's like a little box <#> Okay <#> So at every intersection a box is <.> form </.> formed and this box is known as a cell <#> Okay <#> Every cell has a reference <,> okay <,> which is known as the cell address <#> And when you enter figures into a cell uh and calculate them afterwards <,> you use a formula to calculate <,> but you just specify the cell address <#> You don't ever refer to a figure <#> You actually calculate the contents of these cells <#> So this is what makes it possible to change a figure uh that will automatically change the results <#> Okay <#> Because you 're asking the computer to calculate the contents of the cells <,> not the figures <,> not the actual figures <,> the contents <#> So whatever you put into these cells is going to be calculated <#> If you change the figure <,> the your results are going to change as well <#> So that is the power of the spreadsheet <,> okay <#> It 's known as the what if question <#> What if this should happen <#> What if the price of uh we 'll say petrol went up during the coming six months <#> What effect would this have on our business <#> So <,> if a company are using a spreadsheet to uh budget <,> we 'll say for the coming six months <,> and they think that they they have their spreadsheet done <,> then they hear that the price of petrol is going to go up <#> The price of petrol is going to increase the price of transport and that is going to affect other uh other areas of their company <,> okay <#> So they change the figure for transport for petrol <#> That changes the figure for transport and any figure any other figures that that will affect uh will change automatically <#> So as you know already from doing the spreadsheets yourselves you only put in the initial figures <#> All totals are calculated automatically by the program or by the system <#> Okay <#> So that was the spreadsheet <#> Now you can see <,> well I think everybody here knows what a spreadsheet looks like but read into it <,> if you are asked questions on a spreadsheet you must be able to answer them clearly <#> Okay <#> You must be able to define what a spreadsheet is <,> what it does <,> okay <,> and also the power of the spreadsheet <#> Why we use a spreadsheet <#> Okay <#> So think of these questions in your own mind <#> Uh what is it <#> Why do we use it <#> What is the purpose of it <#> What does it do <#> Okay <#> So think of all these questions that could come up <#> Okay <#> Who uses a spreadsheet <#> Okay <#> The features of a spreadsheet <#> So again we all know that <,> we know that uh the text is known as labels <,> figures are uh are known as values <,> and then of course like the word processor we have editing features as well <#> Okay <#> Now there 's no need to go into those because we've been doing those uh for the past few weeks</I>
