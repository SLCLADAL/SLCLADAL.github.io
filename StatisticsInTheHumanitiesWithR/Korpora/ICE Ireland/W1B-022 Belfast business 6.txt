<W1B-022 Belfast business 6><I><W1B-022$A><h> <#> 21/2/94 </h><h> <bold> <#> TO: ACADEMIC STAFF <#> FROM: DR EILEEN SCOTT <#> SCHOOL OF PHARMACY </bold> </h><h> <bold><#> SELF-STUDY COURSE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS </bold> </h><p> <#> Dear Colleague, <#> I have been given funding from the Enterprise in Higher Education Initiative to introduce a self-study component into the undergraduate syllabus. <#> Although this approach to learning is now an important component of post-graduate education and training, and the success of the Open University attests to its value for undergraduate education, it has not been widely employed within a traditional university setting. <#> Such courses could be used as part of a module requiring part-time attendance at the university or as an independent module to be completed entirely by distance learning. <#> It may also be an attractive option for many students allowing them greater flexibility in organising their studies. </p><p> <#> I am interested to know what experience academic staff at Queen 's have of preparing self-study material or of using prepared self-study courses. <#> I would also like to know your views on the benefits or otherwise of self-study compared with other learning methods. </p><p> <#> I would be grateful if you would answer the following questionnaire and <ul> return it to me by 11th March </ul> via the internal mail. <#> All replies will be treated in confidence. </p><p> <#> Thank you for your help. </p><p> <#> Eileen Scott </p></I><I><W1B-022$B><h> <#> 11 October 1993 </h><p> <#> Dear colleague, <#> The Institute of Continuing Education is currently putting together its programme of extra-mural courses for Spring 1993, and would welcome course proposals from members of staff. </p><p> <#> The Spring classes commence on 25 April, and can be of varying length, though the most usual pattern is 6 1 1/2 hours weekly. <#> One-day, weekend courses and field trips are also popular at this time of year. <#> Current lecture fees are <*> pound sign </*> 22.50 per 1 1/2 hour session;
