<ICE-IRE:S1B-024 Trade unions><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Well there are few subjects more emotive than fair employment and our panel tonight are passionate in their beliefs <,> both for and against <#> In Derry Gregory Campbell of the DUP <#> He 's against the current system <#> Here in Belfast <,> Tom Gillan of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions <#> He 's for the principle at least <#> And very much for both principle and current practice is Bob Cooper <,> chairman of the Fair Employment Commission and before that head of its predecessor <,> The Fair Employment Agency <#> Now Bob Cooper <,> a lot of our audience would be most interested in one specific and that is the case pending against the FEC itself <#> Can you comment on that<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> No I couldn't comment on any matter that 's sub-judice<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> So that 's that <#> <{1> <[1> Until </[1> it 's resolved <{2> <[2> <,> there 's </[2> nothing to be said <#> Okay Tom Gillan in the report we heard uh the union representative talking about public bodies and the and the fact that the public don't get all the information <,> <#> Use this opportunity to put your case to Bob Cooper<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> <[1> That 's that </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> <[2> That 's right </2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$C> <#> Well it 's not just to put to Bob Cooper <,> it 's to put it to government and to those bodies themselves who would uh enter into confidentiality clauses and to anyone who would want to do that <#> It 's in the public interest that all organisations whether they be public sector bodies or private sector bodies breach the law <,> <#> It 's in the public interest that the people know that they did that <,> that they know how they did it <,> uh how that was allowed to happen <#> Were their procedures wrong <#> We need to know how much money 's been spent on that just not only to the person who was discriminated against <,> how much was paid to solicitors <#> We need to get answers to all of those questions so that we can stop it happening again<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Is that not reasonable Bob Cooper<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> Absolutely <#> I can understand that entirely and as far as we are concerned we 're opposed to confidentiality clauses and settlements particularly when it involves uh the public sector <#> Uh we think that the public has a right to know uh where their money 's being spent<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Because it 's public money<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> Because it 's public money <#> Exactly<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Well <,> you know Gregory Campbell and you know he 's a critic of yours <#> But Gregory Campbell in the report the the point is made <,> Protestants use the Fair Employment Commission as well as Catholics <#> Where else could they go if it wasn't for the FEC<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$D> <#> Well yes they do uh Mike and I heavily recommend that they should do so <#> Unfortunately it has taken uh a large number of years now from the initial uh Fair Employment Agency where there was <.> re </.> resentment and opposition to the way the uh Bob Cooper and the old agency was carrying out the functions <#> Now the Commission has been uh in vogue for several years and uh the opposition isn't lessening <#> But what people are doing is they are seeing that there is no other alternative agency to which they can go in order to have their grievance aired and to try and get some uh redress and and there are those who have uh <.> s </.> received redress both monetary and uh uh public redress uh but <.> th </.> they find that there 's no other option <#> They have to go to an <.> o </.> a a company <,> an organisation which they resent uh because of the practice uh but they find that they have no alternative <#> They simply have to go state their case and hope that they get a fair hearing<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> So you 're saying they go almost by default <#> But could I put it to you this point <,> I mean <.> i </.> is it not perhaps a case of attitude and perhaps a particularly Protestant attitude that if it if it 's post-Stormont <,> you don't like it<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$D> <#> No it 's not that at all <#> You see <.> wh </.> what is happening in Northern Ireland is and I 've drawn attention to this uh uh both uh privately with Mr Cooper and publicly many times <#> What you have <,> particularly in public bodies you have a massive recruitment campaign of Roman Catholics to the disadvantage of Protestants <#> Uh and the Health Boards have been mentioned <#> I 'm not mentioning any individual one <#> But if you take the Health Boards as an example globally in Northern Ireland they employ over forty thousand people <#> And three out of the four or them have an imbalance of Catholic recruits <#> Uh <.> tha </.> that is happening over and over and over again to detriment of Protestants <#> Where you get Protestant minorities in other companies <,> they 're such a tiny minority that they are very very fearful of taking any case of uh intimidation or harassment in the workplace because they may be the only Protestant employee in the entire company <{> <[> Where you </[> get Catholic uh minorities you usually find that the Catholic minority is quite small but is growing substantially because of the recruitment policy<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> <[> Bob Cooper </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Bob Cooper would you accept that in the public perception you are you are there basically to serve Catholics<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> Uh I would accept that in the public perception the reason why the Fair Employment Commission was established was of because of the big discrepancy uh in employment and unemployment as far as Catholics were concerned <#> Uh and that still remains <#> And it still remains the situation that whereas uh uh there still is uh an improvement in the situation <#> Uh about forty-one per cent or so of those being recruited are Catholic which does not suggest that there is massive recruitment of Catholics going on <#> That 's roughly the figure which one would expect to find <#> Uhm it might be marginally actually bearing in mind the age factor <,> marginally lower than one would wish to see <#> Uh but there is no evidence of massive uh reverse discrimination in favour of Catholics or anything like that <,> uh quite the reverse<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Gregory Campbell<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$D> <#> No uhm <.> w </.> I mean Bob is flying in the face of his own figures <#> I mean he knows very well and I don't need nor won't uh name the individual companies but he knows that there are large concerns all across Northern Ireland where it is very difficult to find any Protestants employed <#> And you can't find one large company in Northern Ireland that have no Catholics <#> <.> Th </.> that is a fact that is presently uh giving the Fair Employment Commission uh some headache because people like me are raising the issue but I don't see that <,> that they have actually done anything about it <#> And you see when you get companies large companies with hundreds of employees and and say one or two Protestants <,> those people are going to keep their heads down <,> they 're not going to say anything if there 's any abuse heaped on them <,> they 're just going to say well I 've got to mind my own business <,> get get on with my work and go home keep me head down <#> But on the other hand where you get Catholic minorities uh in uh <.> pr </.> predominantly in the east of the Bann they are a burgeoning minority <#> And <{> <[> I mean </[> the figures of Bob Cooper 's monitoring report show that <#> He can't really deny his own figures<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$?> <#> <[> See </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Is that the way you see it Tom Gillan<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$C> <#> Well <,> <.> th </.> the issue is this that we want everyone to live <,> in peace in this community <#> We want everyone to have an equal opportunity for a job and an equal opportunity to progress in that job <#> And we in the trade union movement through counteracting through our own unions have encouraged people not to put their head down <,> not to say that that they 're that that they 're frightened <,> not to walk away from any <,> any fear <.> o </.> of intimidation or or threat that they face from their fellow employees <,> that go first of all to their shop steward to their to their <.> sh </.> to their foreman or whoever it happens to be and say <,> this is happening <#> And we have structures there to ensure that we can do everything and anything we can to to support those people <#> And it 's a very traumatic experience for anyone who has faced intimidation or has been discriminated against <#> We want this to stop <#> There 's it 's not just <.> th </.> the money doesn't pay for this <#> If you have been uhm <,> discriminated against the money you get in your pocket doesn't do anything for the lost opportunity <,> it doesn't do anything for your self-esteem <,> it doesn't do anything for our reputation as a community within ourselves or internationally and we need to stop it <#> The the FEC you know is there <,> it 's made up of people from both sides of industry and from the community and it 'll have to work <#> And we all want to work in it together <#> And let 's sit down and talk about how we could make it better<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Bob Cooper you have been basically Mr Fair Employment since the year dot right through from the FEA to the FEC <#> Over these years has it been helpful do you think<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> Yes absolutely <#> Uh and emphasising again the point that whereas uh all the evidence would suggest that the position of Catholics is improving uh at a slowish rate but it 's still improving <#> But there still is a quite a long way to go <#> Uh the legislation would be being reviewed next year and uh the question will be uh whether it has done enough uh or whether the discrepancy has been uh narrowed sufficiently<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> What I what I wonder about is is <,> tackling fair employment <,> as an issue without looking at segregated housing which is basically the way it is in this country and and segregated education and in Derry Gregory Campbell that would be very much the case wouldn't it in terms of housing <#> Or that 's the way you would see it<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$D> <#> Yes <#> Well it it 's a fact unfortunately <#> We we did have a position probably twenty thirty years ago uh where there was a a reasonable degree <.> o </.> of mixing and socialising uh uh housing and employment <#> But because of the violence and the Troubles uh of course the the communities have polarised <#> Uh you 're always going to get an increasing difficulty where you get people being pushed to the margin pushed aside <#> Uh you you 're going to get <.> th </.> that difficulty which is very hard to overcome <#> <{1> <[1> But <,> </[1> what you 've got to do is you 've got to try and establish the underlying principle and that principle has got to be merit <#> Only merit <#> The person best suited to the job is the person that gets the job <#> <{2> <[2> Unfortunately that </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> <[2> And <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> do you guarantee </[2> </{2> merit<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> Yes that that is exactly the principle of course of the fair employment legislation <#> There should be fair participation for both <{> <[> communities </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-024$D> <#> <[> It doesn't sound </[> </{> like that<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$B> <#> But at the point of selection uh it should be merit <#> Uh on the point of the the the segregation I entirely accept the point you 're making except that one has to work <.> a </.> along different ways<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Tom Gillan I 'll give you the final word<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$C> <#> Well I I I I think yes merit is <.> i </.> is the issue <#> We want our politicians to sit down and give us all something to <.> l </.> live for and to work together for <#> We want structures <,> we want democracy in our own community and we want peace <#> And that <,> if the people would sit down around the table and talk together we can do something about all of this which will bring <,> the need for the FEC et-cetera to to go away<ICE-IRE:S1B-024$A> <#> Tom Gillan and Bob Cooper in Belfast <,> Gregory Campbell in Derry <,> thank-you for joining us</I>
