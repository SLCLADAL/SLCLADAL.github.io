<W2C-019 Leinster Leader><I><W2C-019$A><h> <bold> <#> Fears for jobs as Intel comes under pressure </bold> </h><bold> <#> By HENRY BAURESS </bold><p> <#> INTEL Ireland has come under increasing pressure this week following the decision by IBM to stop shipments of personal computers which contain the Pentium chip. <#> However its spokesman, Frank Turpin, said the difficulty won't affect the company 's plans in the short to medium term. </p><p> <#> The IBM decision follows the recent news that Intel and others have found a problem with the chip, but Intel said they have now dealt with it. </p><p> <#> Intel 's Leixlip plant is responsible for around half the company 's world production of this chip and half of the 1900 Leixlip employees are involved in its production. </p><p> <#> Intel said it discovered the problem with the chip in the summer. <#> It has declined to recall the chips, but promised to aid those affected or replace chips where required. </p><p> <#> It claims the problem only occurs with very advanced mathematical calculations, rather than less complex uses. <#> The Pentium was launched in May 1993. </p><p> <#> IBM said this week, however, that the likelihood of the problem occurring was much greater than indicated by Intel and a spokesman for IBM Ireland told the <it> Leader </it> on Tuesday that it was reacting to complaints from customers when it made its decision. <#> It will resume shipments when it gets a better description of the problem, said Rory Caren, an IBM Ireland spokesman. </p><p> <#> IBM said Intel 's description of the flaw was technically accurate but there were many customer situations in which the risk of error may be significantly higher. </p><p> <#> IBM is just one of a number of PC producers which produces Pentium based PC 's. <#> Compaq, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Gateway and Packard Bell have not yet followed IBM 's move. </p><p> <#> Intel have described IBM 's decision as <quote> "unwarranted." </quote> <quote> <#> "Based upon the work of our scientists analysing real world applications and the experience of millions of users of Pentium processor based systems, we have no evidence of increased probability of encountering the flaw," </quote> Andrew Grove, Intel President and CEO, said on Monday. </p><p> <#> He repeated Intel will replace any chips for any customer who might encounter the problem. <#> Frank Turpin, Intel Ireland manager for external affairs, said on Tuesday that Intel hoped to take on another 300 people in the OEM systems plant over the next three months and the problem with the chip has been rectified. <#> Dell has supported Intel 's stance, he said. </p><p> <#> This week, the company expects a decision from Kildare County Council on its planning application for an extension to the Leixlip plant. </p><p> <#> It is still hoped that an assembly and test centre will be built in Leixlip but plans for that third phase of the Leixlip development are on hold. </p><p> <#> The background to the Pentium debate is the fact that there is currently a major price cutting war in the very competitive arena of PC 's and their chips. </p><p> <#> At home, the news of the Pentium problem has led to unease.<#> Many of the Intel employees come from various parts of Co. Kildare and the company has proved a huge boost to Leixlip. <#> Mike Parle, Leixlip Chamber of Commerce PRO, said the chamber has prepared a <quote> "doomsday" </quote> plan should anything happen Intel, pointing to the exit of Digital. </p></I><I><W2C-019$A><h> <bold> <#> Pioneers celebrate 70 years in Leixlip </bold> </h><bold> <#> By HENRY BAURESS </bold><p> <#> Alcohol is a gift of God but its abuse is the problem. <#> That was one the themes in a talk to Leixlip Pioneers by Fr. Bernard McGuckian, National President of Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. </p><p> <#> He was speaking at the mass to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the pioneer association in Leixlip in 1924. </p><p> <#> Referring to the Roaring Twenties in the United States, Fr. McGuckian said prohibition was a foolish attempt to deal with the problem of alcohol. <#> The early pioneers were not puritanical, prohibitionistic or judgemental of others, but their actions were a response to the love of Christ and sacrifice. <#> <quote> "They decided to light one little candle rather than curse the dark," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> Fr. McGuckian said that the Leixlip group may have been set up in the immediate aftermath of the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the founding of the national movement in 1898. <#> It was held at the Royal Dublin Society in June 1924, some months before the start up in Leixlip on 28 November that year. </p><p> <#> The movement had started with Fr. Cullen and four women, said Fr. McGuckian. <quote> <#> "The first four were women, as Fr. Cullen wanted only women in the movement initially, because he believed men had not suffered enough. <#> But later a group of men pointed out they could be just as worthy of membership," </quote> he said. <quote> </p><p> <#> By 1918, there were 200,000 in the movement and when the Leixlip group was formed a further 50,000 joined. </p><p> <#> Drunkeness is a sin said Fr. McGuckian, but drink is not a demon, it is a gift of God. <#> He said preaching, cajoling, police, prisons or psychiatrists could not prevent the abuse of it. <quote> <#> "Only God 's grace can move a free human will." </quote> </p><p> <#> Fr. Cullen, who founded the <it> Sacred Heart Messenger </it> used a term: <quote> "the gentle violence of total abstinence." </quote> </p><p> <#> A Pioneer promises to pray every day of their lives for a person with a problem, and the movement is about love and concern for others. <#> Wearing the association 's emblem, he said, is a public profession of faith that any human situation can be changed, not a boast about being a non drinker. <#> Fr. Cullen wanted the Pioneers to preach the news that things can change. </p><p> <#> Fr. McGuckian told the congregation that he met a woman who lived in the Falls Road, amidst all the troubles 1980 's in Belfast. <#> She said that since she had taken the pledge there was a peace inside her home which no trouble could take away. </p><p> <#> The worst thing about alcohol abuse is not the man it makes drunk but the children it makes afraid. <#> They never get over it, he continued. <#> A six year old girl in Newry told her teacher she wanted to join the Pioneers. <#> When asked why, she replied it was because of what daddy did to mammy. </p><p> <#> The movement was a quintessential Dublin movement, said Fr. McGuckian and Dublin people should be proud of it. </p><p> <#> In Africa now, there are 250,000 Pioneers. <#> They are joining in huge numbers there as they did in Ireland sixty years ago, mainly out of love for Christ. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We would like to have one Pioneer in every home at least. <#> At least one praying that those who take <}> <-> who take </-> </}> a drink moderately will remain moderate." </quote> </p><p> <#> Fr. McGuckian said we must set out with great hope. <quote> <#> "It is a movement primarily of love and compassion, not of indignation and irritation at human folly and stupidity." </quote> </p><p> <#> Debauchery and drunkenness leads to a coarsening of the heart, he told the attendance, but he reminded them of Matt Talbot 's words that the Lord did not ask us to be successful but to be faithful. </p><p> <#> Matt Talbot, he said had to give up drink to stay alive but that act led to a lot more. <quote> <#> "When I met the Pope a few years ago, he said to me: <quote> <}> <-> 'You 're </-> <+> Your </+> </}> patron is Matt' </quote> ." </quote></I><I><W2C-019$B><#> <h> Catalogue of crime in Athy </h><bold> <#> by JOAN WALSH </bold><p> <#> ATHY was the scene of a catalogue of crime over the weekend as vandals wrought havoc throughout the town. <#> Gardai believe a local gang on the rampage is responsible for the spate of crime. </p><p> <#> On Friday night, the Community Services Centre, Stanhope Place was completely wrecked after vandals ransacked the building causing extensive damage. <#> They hacked their way through doors and rifled every office in the building, even leaving excrement in places. <#> Every light switch was smashed and phone lines ripped out of the wall. <#> A small amount of cash was taken. </p><p> <#> The centre was closed all weekend and part of this week for repair works. <#> Mr. David O'Flaherty, Director of Community Services said he was greatly encouraged by the number of people who offered their help. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile on Sunday night thieves broke into St. Michael 's Church but didn't manage to take anything. <#> The same night, there was a break-in at Pearsons Garage, Woodstock Street but nothing was taken. <#> Gardai believe all three incidents are linked and investigations are continuing. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile an Athy supermarket owner and his wife were the victims of a terrifying ordeal on Saturday night. <#> The nightmare unfolded at around 10.40 p.m. as Desmond and Sadie Perry were at home watching television. <#> There was a loud bang at the front door and the couple were confronted by three masked men, one armed with a sawn off shotgun and another with a knife. </p><p> <#> The raiders forced their way into the house and tied up the terrified couple. <#> They took a substantial sum of money, mainly cheques and escaped in the Perry 's Ford Granada car. <#> As the gang fled they pulled the telephone wires from the wall. <#> Soon after, the couple managed to free themselves and raised the alarm. <#> The car was recovered by local Gardai shortly after the incident at Tyrellstown. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile, also on Saturday there was an attempted raid at Valu Centre, Athy. <#> The raiders fled as the alarm went off. </p></I><I><W2C-019$C><h> <bold> <#> New office cost almost a million </bold> </h><bold> <#> by LIAM KENNY </bold><p> <#> THE accumulated cost of the finished Naas Credit Union premises at No. 20 North Main Street has approached the one million pound mark. <#> In a detailed breakdown to members at the AGM on Saturday night last the Credit Union directors calculated a total cost of <*> pound sign </*> 945,000 for the premises. </p><p> <#> More than <*> pound sign </*> 200,000 was swallowed up by work on two ill-fated designs which envisaged the total demolition of the old Marum 's premises and rebuilding of new structures. <#> The first envisaged total demolition and the building of an architecturally imaginative new office building. <#> This was dropped when it was realised that it was not acceptable to the Naas planning authorities. <#> The second involved demolition and rebuilding to a more traditional design. </p><p> <#> Eventually this too had to be abandoned over engineering issues involving other properties but not before the Credit Union had spent <*> pound sign </*> 113,478 on architect 's and engineer 's fees and another <*> pound sign </*> 30,000 on a contract settlement to the builder in addition to other costs. </p><p> <#> A third course of rebuilding <it> within </it> the framework of the existing Marum 's premises had to be adopted in early 1993 which resulted in the present offices in August and cost <*> pound sign </*> 503,973 plus <*> pound sign </*> 75,182 for fixtures and fittings. </p><p> <#> The cost of the Marum 's site purchased in October 1988 was <*> pound sign </*> 188,427 of which <*> pound sign </*> 26,550 was recovered through the sale of the publican 's licence leaving an actual site cost of <*> pound sign </*> 161,877. <#> A further <*> pound sign </*> 77,000 will be clawed back by the Credit Union through the sale of its old offices at No.32 North Main Street, leaving the net cost of the Credit Union 's property transactions over the past six years in the region of <*> pound sign </*> 870,000. </p><p> <#> Fortunately the Naas Credit Union 's financial performance is so strong - a reflection in turn of the popularity of its services - that it has been able to absorb such exceptional costs while at the same time granting dividends of up to five percent to members and transferring significant amounts to its reserve accounts. </p></I><I><W2C-019$D><h> <bold> <#> Denied damage to Allen tower </bold> </h><bold> <#> by PAUL O'MEARA </bold><p> <#> CLAIMS that the stone tower at the top of the Hill of Allen may be under threat because of the excavations which take place beneath the structure have been denied by Roadstone. </p><p> <#> Some local people fear that further action is necessary to preserve the building but according to Roadstone no quarrying has been taking place near the tower and a spokesperson dismissed a claim that fresh cracks have appeared. </p><p> <#> Roadstone has been extracting rock from the Hill of Allen for a good many years but the company says it is committed to preserving the tower. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It is our policy not to go near the tower. <#> The company has done a good deal of restoration work there and this includes work to repair damage caused as a result of vandalism," </quote> the spokesman said. </p></I><I><W2C-019$E><h> <bold> <#> Newbridge scheme looks good </bold> </h><#> By EAMON DILLON<p> <#> MAJOR developers are closely examining the Action Plan for Newbridge 's designated area. <#> Urban Renewal Liaison Officer and Town Clerk Charlie Talbot said that he has had a large number of enquiries. <#> Two of those include proposals for major property developments. <#> In relation to one of them, a request for planning permission has already been lodged.</p><p> <quote> <#> "There 's no doubt about it, there 's money looking to be spent in Newbridge," he said. <#> He explained that people making contact include those with property already in the area and those seeking to acquire property. <#> He hoped it would be possible to <quote> "marry"</quote> the two.</p><p> <#> Mr. Talbot added that there is a large demand for both public and private housing in the Newbridge area while it is the biggest shopping town in the county. <quote> <#> "I can't think of a town that has more going for it,"</quote> he concluded.</p></I>
