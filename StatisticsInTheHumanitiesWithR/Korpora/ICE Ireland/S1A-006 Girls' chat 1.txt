with which I thought was two hundred and fifty grams <#> Now we 're talking a big bar of chocolate <{1> <[1> here </[1> <#> I actually didn't even check it <#> I just thought <,> well I mean <{2> <[2> there 's </[2> not going to be any more chocolate in it than that<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> But how could

</{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> <[2> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[2> </{2> <#> You know one of the big bars of chocolate out of Marks <#> And I thought<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> Not

<#> Well I thought well there 's not going to be <unclear> several sylls </unclear> one of those big <#> <{1> <[1> I mean </[1> there 's not going to be any more chocolate in it than <{2> <[2> that </[2> <#> So of course took it out to do the recipe and looked at the recipe and it said two hundred and fifty grams and it was only one hundred and fifty grams <{3> <[3> <#> So </[3> I had to run down to Iceland which all sounds very well but it actually takes twelve minutes to get there and twelve minutes to get back again <#> And when you 're on a very very bloody <{4> <[4> tight schedule </[4><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[2> Mhm </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[3> Oh </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[4> Tight schedule </[4> </{4>

</{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Why were they booked on a Sunday at half ten<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> Apparently it 's <{> <[> Mother 's Day </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[> Oh it 's Mother 's Day

Iceland <&> laughter </&> I then thought I 'll buy a big bottle of blackberry and raspberry water for Mary because she 's pregnant <&> laughter </&> <#> It occurred to me ten minutes ago <{1> <[1> that actually </[1> <,> she had Charles you know <{2> <[2> ten months ago now </[2> <#> I mean that 's why I bought it <,> for pregnant Mary<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[1> Are you serious </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[2> Oh my God that 's <.> hilar </.> </[2> </{2> <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <&> laughter </&> <#> That 's absolutely hilarious<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> Not for Jessie who might be driving<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> No no no for pregnant Mary <#> No I actually think that 's a bit scary<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> But it 's funny the way you can like remember things from you know <,> <{> <[> the way </[> it just sticks in you head like that <#> You just obviously you associate her with being<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> <[> Uh huh </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> Aye with being pregnant<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Pregnant or not drinking or something you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> It I mean it only occurred to me cos then I was thinking uh <,> about five minutes ago I was thinking oh right okay well Mary 's coming round and I wonder what time Charles 'll go to bed at and that <,> <#> And then I thought yes because she 's had the baby now <#> I 'm <{> <[> seriously concerned now </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[> That 's hilarious </[> </{> <#> Och your house is just so gorgeous now <#> You must be just

</&><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Well to be honest I think it 's fine <#> You know it 's not<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> Greg absolutely loves that clock<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Cos it 's not <,> I think that those uhm <,> it 's fine you know it 's not about it it 's not what you would choose <{> <[> yourself </[> but at the same time it 's not that it absolutely stands out<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> But I don't think that it 's in keeping with <{> <[> the rest of </[> the room<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[> Serious </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> It 's what you find in like a great-auntie 's house or something like<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> Yeah <#> I I laughed the other day girls <#> Aunt Janice came to get the delivery of this sofa and I came back in again and this <,> was like this <,> and this <,> was like this<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Oh really<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> And everything was angled <&> laughter </&> <#> She had gone round the

actually not quite<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Straight<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> It 's not quite straight <#> It 's not like I 'm Little Miss Tidy or anything but I don't like things angled <#> And she 'd gone round and she 'd rearranged the bottles in the bathroom <#> <{1> <[1> And she 'd angled <,> she 'd angled </[1> something in the kitchen and <,> and you get uhm you see uhm uh something was angled in the kitchen <{2> <[2> you know tonight after she 'd left </[2> <#> Oh just rearranged like where they where they were like just where they were sitting <{3> <[3> <#> She </[3> wanted them more central<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[1> Are you serious <#> Oh my God that 's she just did </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[2> What do you mean rearranged the bottles </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[3> Oh right </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> I mean I had two of them sort of over to the side and she wanted them more central than that so I had to go back round the house de-angling <{> <[> them <#> It was just it was so funny </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[> Oh that 's hilarious <#> That 's so funny </[> </{> <#> And she obviously thought she was like with the delivery people as well because she was afraid of them marking your wall<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> No but that was great <{> <[> because </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[> I know </[> </{> <#> That 's what I 'm saying<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> You know if Rowena had been here <,> not that I mean no harm to Rowena but she probably would have been a bit like me it wouldn't have occurred to her probably<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah cos it wouldn't actually occur to you I think <{> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> <[> No well </[> </{> it would occur to me now after because the last time <,> when they brought in the first sofa they actually did scrape it along the <{1> <[1> wall </[1> <#> And I can see where the scrape <{2> <[2> it isn't it it 's it 's marked the paint but </[2> it 's not<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[1> Oh right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[2> Yeah has marked the paint <,> yeah yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Yeah it just has yeah <#> Mary-Louise that 's an absolutely gorgeous photograph of you two <#> Absolutely beautiful<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> Mhm <#> I like that one<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> It 's beautiful of both of you <#> Whose wedding was that at<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> I think that was at Colin and Susan 's wedding<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah cos you were you were wearing that outfit<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> Yeah<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Here I think this is really weird <#> Was I telling somebody this last night in the pub <#> Tom O'Donnell was on the phone the other day <{1> <[1> and he said </[1> I think this is really weird <#> I got an invitation to Gene White 's <{2> <[2> wedding </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[1> Yes you were telling me </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[2> Tom </[2> </{2> did<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Tom O'Donnell did <#> That was so weird <&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&> <#> No I said actually no we didn't <#> I mean <,> the truth we 're going to be away not that Gene would have known that because you could send somebody an invitation and<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> On the other hand we you know we didn't invite Gene to our wedding and there 's a little bit of that as well <#> You know there is that bit of you 're not invited to somebody 's wedding you don't invite them to yours you know <#> No but I think there 's a bit of <,> there 's a bit more of that than you might <{1> <[1> <,> expect actually </[1> <#> And that 's and that 's I mean truly honest to God <{2> <[2> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[2> <,> after all we didn't invite him and we would have been in Australia anyway <#> But I thought that was really weird actually that out of the blue <{3> <[3> they </[3> suddenly invited Tom O'Donnell<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[1> Well maybe yeah </[1> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[2> You were going to Australia </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> And is Tom going<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> What I think 's weird about that<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> I think so yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> What I think 's weird about that is that okay he invited Tom which is a bit strange <,> but Tom was on the stag <,> but so was Roger<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> You know I find that odd<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Yeah <{> <[> so do I </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$D> <#> <[> Did he <,> so </[> </{> unless the invitation <,> it was before the stag was it <#> Uhm so Gene might have heard on the stag<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> But Tom Tom was Tom not absolutely amazed to be invited on the stag<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <{> <[> Yeah he was </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> <[> I think I think </[> </{> he was pretty amazed <#> But uhm I think that a lot of Tom I mean I think a lot of the reason Roger was invited on the stag was probably cos he knew Dublin as well <#> <{> <[> I mean </[> I think that was a large part of it <#> I think Tom was invited because just for<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Apparently he was in the Morning Star on Christmas Eve<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> Probably <,> so they were all chatting about it and Tom and as I say Roger and Donall and you know <#> But I think that that 's really weird<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Isn't it<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> But they should have a lovely day <#> Having said that I 'm sure it 'll be a really great day now <#> Easter Monday is a nice day to book for a wedding you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> Och it 's a pity you 're not<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$B> <#> I know it is a pity actually <#> I would like to be there <#> Was that your door or was that the settee<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$A> <#> <{> <[> See if my settee was making those </[> kind of noises it 'd be going back<ICE-IRE:S1A-006$C> <#> <[> Well unless maybe you have an invitation

think because he probably <,> <#> Uhm really I 'm only saying this to you and obviously I 'm not offended or anything <#> I just thought it was odd<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-006$E> <#> We then came home and spent <,> I went up to bed <,> and he spent about an hour on the internet trying to book a holiday or something just so that he could kind of say
