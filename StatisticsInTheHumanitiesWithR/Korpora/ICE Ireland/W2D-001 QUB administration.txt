<W2D-001 QUB administration><I><W2D-001$A><h> <#> The Queen 's University of Belfast </h><h> <#> Institute of Computer Based Learning </h><h> <#> Background </h><p> <#> Computer based approaches to teaching and learning have been a feature of curriculum development in a number of departments at Queen 's since the 1970s. <#> Over the period 1984-1990, a major investment in student workstations sponsored jointly by Northern Ireland 's Department of Education and Industrial Development Board, enabled the University to establish its delivery infrastructure for computers in teaching. <#> As a direct result of this initiative, interest in computer based learning (CBL) became widespread across the disciplines of the University. <#> In October 1987, to act as a focus for this interest, the University established the Centre for Computer Based Learning (CCBL) in a joint venture between the Computer Centre and the School of Education. <#> The CCBL was successful in a number of bids under national initiatives (see under Major Projects), and this success along with a desire to enable the study of the foundational academic disciplines of CBL led the University to create an independent Institute of Computer Based Learning (ICBL) in December 1992. </p><h> <#> Aims and Objectives </h><p> <#> The aims and objectives of the ICBL are <#> to create and maintain a centre of excellence for computer based learning at the University; <#> to develop courseware and software systems to support the teaching of all academic disciplines; <#> to carry out research into computer based learning techniques; <#> to undertake commissions for courseware. </p><h> <#> Software development </h><p> <#> Software developments are undertaken not only to support the production of teaching and learning materials but also as an important foundation for research. <#> The objectives are to develop authoring systems, related utilities and a number of generic applications for the three common delivery platforms, viz PCs, Macs and Unix workstations. <#> Key disciplines include visual programming, object-orientation and functional programming, and important applications include hypertext and Q <*> ampersand </*> A management, data visualisation, animation, simulation, modelling and natural language response analysis. </p><p> <#> The underlying systems are written in C++ with an in-house class library offering common GUI objects and functionality across the three platforms. <#> Writing in this system enables source code portability for tools, utilities, applications and courseware. <#> The writing of courseware is facilitated by providing an integrated set of authoring tools and application generators, which make use of visual programming interfaces. </p><h> <#> Courseware development </h><p> <#> CBL may be used in many if not all areas of education and training. <#> Within Queen 's, the ICBL works with a diversity of academic disciplines. <#> Recent or current commitments at Queen 's range from advice on CVL and multimedia, through support of courseware development and use of tools, to actual collaborative projects. <#> These activities have involved Mechanical Engineering, Built Environment, Pharmacy, Anatomy, Mental Health, Pathology, Dentistry, Accountancy, Italian, Legal Studies and the Staff Training and Development Unit. </p><p> <#> The most significant collaboration in this area is the University 's current TLTP project - producing 210 hours of CBL, across 10 disciplines involving 30 academics - which is described in more detail below. </p><h> <#> Research </h><p> <#> The foundational academic disciplines of CBL are education, psychology and computer science. <#> The Institute provides a focus for inter-disciplinary research for academics from these disciplines. <#> The main themes under investigation at present are: <#> Pedagogical Design, Curriculum Content, Assessment, Evaluation, Human Computer Interface, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Learner Models, Neural Networks, Visual Programming, Modelling and Response Analysis. </p><p> <#> Current research commitments are listed below <#> Evaluation studies on the general use of computers in education and the particular use of CBL in the teaching of psychology. <#> Lattice modelling of processes in polymer chemistry using statistical methods. <#> Abstractions of graphical and textual language representations to support the construction of computer based models and simulators. <#> Investigation and development of language systems for functional and object-oriented programming. <#> Object-orientation methodology and reverse engineering for real-time network management. </p><h> <#> Teaching </h><p> <#> The ICBL will offer a MSc in Computer Based Learning, starting in late September 1994. <#> Six modules are available in 1994/95: <#> Information Technology and Services <#> CBL Approaches <#> CBL Systems <#> Courseware Engineering <#> Cognitive Modelling and Human-Computer Interaction <#> Advanced CBL Design </p><p> <#> A further four modules will be offered in 1995/96. </p><h> <#> Staff Development </h><p> <#> The Institute promotes the awareness of CBL concepts and techniques through seminars, summer schools and workshops. <#> In addition, the ICBL collaborates with the University 's Staff Training and Development Unit in seminars for staff induction and in workshops in teaching methods with the Enterprise Unit. </p><h> <#> Major Projects </h><h> <#> Information Technology Training Initiative (ITTI) </h><p> <#> This three year project is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 1994. <#> The products are courseware and other teaching materials on CBL itself, and authoring (system) tools. <#> This is targetted at all tertiary level academic staff, and trainers in other organisations. </p><h> <#> Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) </h><p> <#> This is a three year project to be completed in February 1996. <#> The products are over 200 hours of teaching materials on a wide range of academic topics, to be deliverable on the three most common delivery platforms, viz PCs, Macs and Unix workstations. <#> In the selection of topics and methods to be addressed, care has been taken to identify items of common interest to the wider audience of universities and higher education. <#> At Queen 's, the new materials will generate over 50,000 student courseware hours per annum and a vigorous programme of dissemination will be undertaken to ensure that other institutions are aware of the materials to be made available. <#> The academic disciplines are Education, General Practice, Languages, Obstetrics, Orthopaedics, Pharmacy, Physics, Psychology, Social Sciences and OR. </p><h> <#> Staff </h><p> <#> The director of the ICBL is Dr Fred McBride. <#> Paddy Brannigan (Services) and Randall Thompson (Development) manage teams of courseware analysts and developers and systems programmers. <#> The current staff complement is 23. </p></I><I><W2D-001$B><h> <#> The Queen 's University of Belfast </h><h> <#> Library Information </h><h> <#> Borrowing Books </h><h> <#> Who may borrow? </h><p> <#> All Queen 's University staff and registered students, associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers are entitled to use the library and to borrow from it. </p><h> <#> What may be borrowed? </h><p> <#> Most of the books in the library can be borrowed. <#> Certain categories of material are not available for loan. <#> These include all periodicals; bibliographies (class Z on the ground floor and floor 1 of the Old Library Building); past examination papers; new books on display; university calendars, telephone directories, timetables; reference books on the ground floor and floor 1 of the Old Library Building (and in the ordinary book stacks, if so marked); and most of the Special Collections. </p><h> <#> Period of loan </h><p> <h> <it> Undergraduates, Postgraduates on taught courses, Associate Members and Reciprocal Associate Borrowers </it> </h><p> <#> Undergraduates may borrow books from the main collection for two weeks; associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers for four weeks, this period being renewable if no prior reservation has been made by another reader. </p><h> <#> <it> Staff and Research Students </it> </h><p> <#> Staff and research students may borrow books from the main collection for twelve weeks, this period being renewable if no prior reservation has been mad by another reader. </p><p> <#> <it> (The loan period to all borrowers for material borrowed from the medical Library is four weeks) </it> </p><p> <#> Note: <bold> <#> Books for which there is a waiting list at the time of borrowing are lent for one week only to all categories of reader. <#> If these are returned late they are subject to a fine of 50p per day overdue. </bold> </p><p> <#> ALL BOOKS ARE SUBJECT TO RECALL AT ANY TIME IF REQUESTED BY ANOTHER READER </p><h> <#> Fines </h><p> <#> A fine of 5p per day, or 25p per week is levied for each book overdue (undergraduates, postgraduates on taught courses, associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers) <#> Staff and research students incur fines at the same rate if an overdue notice has been sent and the borrower has failed to return the book by the date stipulated in the notice. <#> Fines of 10p per day operate in the case of books recalled on behalf of another reader which have not been returned by the date stipulated on the recall notice. </p><p> <bold> <#> Books borrowed from the Undergraduate Collection or the Restricted Loans Collections are subject to a fine of 20p per hour or part thereof, if they are not returned on time. </bold> </p><h> <#> How to borrow books </h><p> <#> You should bring any books you wish to borrow to the Issue Desk on the Ground Floor of the Old Library Building and hand them, along with your barcoded staff, student associate membership or reciprocal associate borrower identity card, to the assistant who will validate the loan. </p><h> <#> How many books may I borrow? </h><p> <#> Undergraduate and postgraduate students on taught courses may have on loan up to ten books at any one time from the main collections of the University Library. <#> Some material is kept at the Issue Desk (e.g. Offprints of recommended journal articles or chapters from books). <#> Borrowers may have 3 items from this collection on loan at any one time. <#> In addition, QUB students may borrow up to four books from the Undergraduate Collection. </p><p> <#> Personal Associate Members and Reciprocal Associate Borrowers may have 6 books on loan at any one time. <#> Professional and Corporate Associate Members may have up to 10 books on loan a any one time. </p><p> <#> Staff and research students of Queen 's may have up to 25 books on loan from the University Library at any one time. </p><h> <#> <it> IMPORTANT NOTE: </h><p> <#> Borrowers remain responsible for books represented in the files by uncancelled records, and may be charged the replacement cost of any outstanding items. <#> It is, therefore, very important that you do not leave books at the returns desk without ensuring that library staff have discharged the books in the computer files. </it> </p><h> <#> Lost books </h><p> <#> The loss of any books should be reported to the Issue Desk immediately. <#> A replacement fee, which includes a handling charge will be levied. </p><h> <#> Renewing Books </h><p> <#> Books due for return may be renewed if not wanted by another reader. <#> Books for renewal should be taken to the Returns Desk in the Main Library. </p><p> <it> <#> On an experimental basis a telephone renewal service is available for staff, research students, associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers. <#> The number to ring for telephone renewal of Main Library books is ext 5022 (or 335022 from outside the University). </it> </p><h> <#> Reservation of books </h><p> <#> Should a book in the Main Library stock be on loan to another reader, it may be reserved by using the Public Reservation facility in the OPAC. <#> Readers are limited to three 'public reservations' but additional reservations may be placed by enquiring at the Issue Desk. <#> Alternatively, you may reserve a book by quoting the barcode number or ISBN to an assistant at the Issue Desk asking them to reserve the book for you. <#> Readers may be asked to complete a reservation postcard. </p></I><I><W2D-001$C><h> <#> WORK FOR OUTSIDE ORGANISATIONS </h><p> <#> The Senate, at its meeting on 6 April 1993, approved new arrangements to govern all work undertaken by members of staff for outside bodies. <#> These new arrangements are set out in detail in the attached Notes of Guidance. </p><p> <#> The main principles upon which new procedures have been based are: <#> (i) a distinction between <it> Intra-Contractual Work </it> (i.e., work expressed or implied in contracts of employment) and <it> Extra-Contractual Work </it> (i.e. work which a member of staff cannot reasonably be expected to undertake as part of his or her contract of employment with the university); <#> <ii> a requirement that all academic and academic-related staff make an annual return on all work undertaken; <#> (iii) a requirement that, where possible, work for outside bodies be carried out within the University 's contractual framework; <#> (iv) a requirement that members of staff obtain the permission of the Director of their School/Unit and of the Standing Committee before undertaking work outside the University framework; <#> (v) an understanding that staff carrying out approved private work, up to an annual value not exceeding 10 <*> per cent sign </*> of their basic salary, should not normally be asked to make a contribution to University funds; and <#> (vi) a requirement that staff carrying out work with a value higher than in (v) above, should normally make a contribution to University funds, or take an appropriate abatement in salary, or take leave of absence without pay. </p><p> <#> The Notes of Guidance also cover such matters are requirements for professional indemnity insurance, membership of public bodies, the treatment of honoraria paid for membership of outside bodies, detailed financial arrangements for outside work and on the exploitation of copyright material, patents etc, and conflicts of interest. </p><p> <#> You will see that paragraphs 4-6 of the Notes outline the requirement that members of staff make an annual return on all work for outside bodies which relates to their professional skill or position in the University, <it> plus </it> personal and voluntary work which, in aggregate, is of such a volume of so timed that it might impinge on the performance of inter-contractual work. </p><p> <#> A form has been prepared to facilitate the reporting of such work and a copy is enclosed. <#> It would be appreciated if the form were completed and returned to <bold> Mrs N Benton, Administrative Secretary 's Office by Friday, 17 June 1994. </bold> </p><p> <#> This letter should also act as a reminder to those members of staff who wish to engage, or who have engaged in, work for outside organisations as covered by the procedures, but who have not as yet requested University permission. </p><p> <#> Please note that <bold> NIL RETURNS ARE REQUIRED. </bold> <#> Members of staff for whom the form has no relevance at the present time are asked to complete Section 1 of the form, which should then be signed and returned. </p><p> <#> When received, a copy of the form will be made available to the Director of your School/Unit and to the Standing Committee in summary form. </p></I>
