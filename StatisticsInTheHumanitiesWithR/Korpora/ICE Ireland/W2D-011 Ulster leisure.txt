of Dunmurry 's unique floral boutique <bold> All Seasons. </bold> </p><p> <quote> <#> "Flower arranging is something I 've always enjoyed and given the opportunity to share this skill with others and see them get enjoyment from my efforts has given me much pleasure." </quote> </p><p> <#> Over the years Jeanette has combined a busy family life with personal involvement in the business - something for which <bold> All Seasons </bold> is renowned. </p><p> <#> Referring to attitude changes and <}> <-> customers </-> <+> customers ' </+> </}> requirements since 1983 Jeanette says that while there have been increases in the number of people using our services this has been matched by a greater expectation in terms of quality and value for money and it is essential that each customer and potential customer receives individual attention. </p><p> <#> This high level of service is achieved with highly trained staff and best quality products and customer satisfaction is guaranteed through personal consultation and taking time to understand what a customer really wants. </p><p> <#> At no time is this more evident than when discussing floral arrangements for a wedding when Jeanette 's objective is to contribute positively to the success of that happy event. </p><p> <#> The Flowers for a wedding says Jeanette are so important, especially for the bride for, don't forget although almost everything else can be planned and checked in advance but the flower are the very last thing the bride sees and we must get it right. </p><p> <#> Because of this brides really get VIP treatment - we at <bold> All Seasons </bold> feel part of the whole occasion and we get enormous satisfaction from having totally satisfied customers. </p><p> <#> We also provide Wedding Stationery which with imaginative planning can be part of a colour co-ordinated approach which many people really appreciate. </p><p> <#> A wide selection of carefully chosen unusual flowers all year round makes all of this possible for <bold> All Seasons </bold> customers. </p><p> <#> Conversely when advice is sought for tributes for less happy occasions this is given with sensitivity and a genuine feeling of understanding. </p><p> <#> These events together with "Valentine 's Day", "Mothers Day", "Easter" and "Christmas" all make for a varied work programme which contributes to the friendly atmosphere of the beautifully decorated and customer friendly shop. </p><p> <#> What about the future and the next 10 years? </p><p> <#> This, says Jeanette is very bright and with the continued loyalty of my many valued customers and the commitment of all at <bold> All Seasons </bold> customers will realise they are dealing with professionals. </p><p> <#> The real future however is to continue giving the High Quality service our customers deserve. </p><p> <#> We 're having a 10th anniversary celebration on the evening of 31st May and invite all our customers to call and see us - to mark the occasion each visitor will receive a gift. </p><p> <#> Do please call - have a chat - have a look round - and join the party. </p></I><I><W2D-011$B><h> <#> A Taste of Ulster </h><p> <#> <bold> It has always surprised me that for a Province surrounded more or less by water, sea food has never historically been a major part of the Ulster diet. <#> I grew up at a time when the traditional main course was almost invariably sirloin steak. <#> There may have been a prawn cocktail first, and probably a Black Forest gateau afterwards. <#> But when you talked about an Ulster cuisine it was usually the old faithful, the Ulster Fry. </p><p> <#> How times have changed. <#> Now we have chefs and restaurants worthy of the international reputations they are already establishing, and the influence of the leaders in the field is already spreading across the Province. <#> Today there is a steady stream of wine makers from every major wine exporting country visiting Northern Ireland. <#> And when they talk about their wines, they are usually fulsome in their praise for the accompanying fare. </p><p> <#> It was Hugh O'Neill, Chairman of the Tourist Board, who recognised the importance of promoting good Ulster products. <#> And in 1990 he made the first moves to market his new idea. </p><p> <#> That was the beginning of 'A Taste of Ulster' and from the initial 27 members, the numbers of those participating has swelled to 100. </p><p> <#> Calor Gas was involved from the beginning, but now, in the third year of the scheme, has significantly increased its involvement. <#> 'A Taste of Ulster' has a number of aims and objects, principal of which is the pursuit of excellence in the preparation and serving of food. <#> And the best way of guaranteeing that excellence is by making use of the highest quality local produce. <#> The range is enormous and not all of it is at the top of the food spectrum. <#> It encourages initiative, enterprise and flair in producing dishes using local products to suit all pockets. </p><p> <#> And that is why the Taste of Ulster guide to the 100 recognised establishments includes coffee shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants both simple and sophisticated. </p><p> <#> The scheme operates under a management panel whose Chairman is Clare Connery. <#> The panel includes Hugh O'Neill and representatives from the catering industry, and a team of inspectors covers the three main categories - hotels and restaurants, pubs and coffee shops. <#> Those establishments which apply for membership will be inspected and, if they meet the required standards, accepted as members. </p><p> <#> The inspectors arrive without any identification and operate anonymously so that, hopefully, they are in the best position to judge the establishment from the point of view of members of the public. </p><p> <#> This year all 'Taste of Ulster' members events are being held in association with Calor Gas. <#> Two major events have already taken place to raise the profile of 'A Taste of Ulster'. <#> 'sourcing the Ulster Product' was the title of a forum held at Malone House in Belfast in January which brought Taste of Ulster members into contact with local Ulster Produce suppliers. <#> Lord Arran, the Minister with responsibility for Agriculture, attended the forum and spoke positively about the benefits of strengthening the links between local suppliers and members of the catering industry. </p><p> <#> Taking part were exhibitors of meats, poultry products, seafood, dairy produce, organic foods, ice cream, bread, mineral waters and fruit and salads. <#> Calor, as market leader in the liquid petroleum gas industry in the Province, and with over fifty years experience with the food and catering industry here, was also to the fore. <#> Most chefs in the hotel and catering industry in Northern Ireland show a preference for cooking with Calor Gas. </p><p> <#> In March an important seminar examined ways and opportunities for members to publicise their establishments and professionalise their press relations. <#> Two of the speakers, Chairman Clare Connery and Calor Gas Sales and Marketing Director Roy Connolly, <}> <-> exmphasised </-> <+> emphasised </-> </}> the importance of striving for excellence in this area too. <#> And in June a number of local chefs will be responding to the challenge of creating new Ulster dishes. </p><p> <#> The guide is laid out in an easy-to-read format with entries arranged county by county. <#> Where possible, in addition to describing the nature of the establishment, fuller information is included which serves to give visitors a better picture of the individual character they can expect to find. <#> The basalt hexagon which indicates membership is a guarantee of quality. </p><p> <#> As the level of tourism in the Province continues to climb, the importance of providing increasing numbers of visitors something unique, and to international standards, has never been greater. <#> And as the general public here become more knowledgeable about food, and expect higher standards, then 'The Taste of Ulster' has a significant role to play to the benefit of all. </p></I><I><W2D-011$C><h> <bold> <#> HOUSEHOLD BORES </bold> <h><p> <#> <bold> If ironing undies is high on your list of priorities, then <it> Lynda Gilby </it> thinks you should consider therapy. <#> A paragon of idleness, she assures us that dust, if ignored, soon ceases to annoy. </p><p> <#> THERE SEEMS TO be a legion of women out there who are disappearing up their collective rectum with frightening efficiency, returning home each day from a full-time job but still shouldering the lion 's share of the household tasks. <#> They may, perhaps, benefit from the experience of an incompetent like myself for it you are as haphazard around the home as I am, the only possible attitude to adopt to it is one of studied serenity. </p><p> <#> AND IF WE are ever to convert the male of our species to the concept of the New Man, then he will need to be confronted with the New Woman who does not dissolve into nervous collapse if the kettle handle isn't pointing due north. </p><p> <#> I SUPPOSE THAT quite a few people at some point in their lives, have a Road to Damascus experience. <#> Mine came one evening as I was watching television. <#> I 'd just finished excavating the grill pan, reflecting guiltily that I was the only woman I knew who never cleaned anything until it was truly dirty. </p><h> <bold> TOLERATING SQUALOR </bold> </h><p> <#> I had, and still retain, a natural tolerance for squalor. <#> Some days when I cast a cursory glance around my flat, I hardly knew where to begin. <#> So I didn't. <#> Once the dust was readily detectable, another week wasn't going to make much difference. </p><p> <#> SUDDENLY, MR QUENTIN CRISP intoned into my living room: <quote> "I have a message of hope for the house slave. <#> After the first four years the dust doesn't get any worse." </quote> <#> I had been working along similar lines but I had never, until then, thought to boast about it. </p><p> <#> I STILL HAVEN'T the nerve to aspire to his blessed state of doing no housework at all but finally, I can timidly come out of my uncleaned closet to pass on a spot of accrued wisdom from the Gilby School of Household Management. </p><p> <#> THE BASIC MESSAGE is, I suppose: lower your standards. <#> As Ms Nancy Spain once wrote: <quote> "Only a fool would clean under the bed." </quote> </p><p> <#> I RECKON THERE are three bottom-line essentials for maintaining a healthy household: clean beds, clean food and a disinfected lavatory bowl. <#> And any idiot can change the sheets, throw out leftovers before they grow whiskers and slosh a sash of Domestos round the loo in a matter of mere minutes. <#> Everything else, particularly if faced with a partner not pulling his weight, is open to negotiation or neglect. </p><p> <#> I DON'T, BY the way, subscribe to the popular theory that who cleans the toilet is the acid test of whether or not there is a New Man in residence. <#> From the way some pundits harp on about it you would think persons of the female gender were required to achieve the operation with their tongues rather than with a handy brush designed for the purpose. <#> There 's no point making a fuss about something that demands so little in terms of time and energy. </p><p> <#> FAR MORE IMPORTANT is that dreadful marathon of drudgery know as <quote> "doing the ironing" </quote>. <#> I 'm told that the are born-again masochists who insist on ironing face flannels but I refuse to believe it. <#> Writer Erin Prizzey maintains that if you stop ironing clothes, they soon cease to expect it and any residual creases fall out with the heat of your body. </p><p> <#> IF YOU SHARE premises, I suggest you issue a unilateral declaration that all household members over the age of ten are henceforth to do their own ironing. <#> A ten-year old can be held legally responsible for murder, so smoothing his own football shirt shouldn't be beyond him. </p><p> <#> AND IF A MAN can fathom the functioning of the internal combustion engine, he ought to find mastering the intricacies of the steam iron as easy as falling off a feminist. <#> Surly, morning cries of: <quote> "Where are my clean shirts/underpants/string vests?" </quote> should be met with a brisk but pleasant: <quote> "Beats the hell out of me." </quote> </p><p> <#> IF YOUR NEAREST and dearest are unmannerly enough to leave a ring round the bathtub, ignore it. <#> Take showers instead. <#> Eventually the law of diminishing returns will prevail and before it gets to the hammer and chisel stage, someone else will become disgusted enough to clean it. </p><h> <bold> <#> DEMANDING ROLLS </bold> </h><p> <#> Must you always be the one who remembers to replenish the supply of toilet rolls? <#> A few days of Belfast Telegraph applied abrasively to the affected part might concentrate the mind of your partner wonderfully. <#> Self-interest is a great teacher. </p><p> <#> IT FOLLOWS, OF COURSE, that if you are to abrogate some of your onerous responsibilities, then you have to allow other people to do it their way. <#> The fateful words of any woman are: <quote> "Get out of the way, I can do it quicker/better/properly/myself." </quote> </p><p> <#> I USED TO OBSERVE with awestruck fascination, female friends who managed to keep dirt permanently at bay. <#> They didn't so much live in their homes, rather, they appeared to be at war with them. <#> Only a constant vigilance, it seemed, could maintain dominance over the grimy enemy within. </p><p> <#> SOME, NOW WORKING again since their kids are older, are coming round to my contention that windows need to be cleaned, at most, once a year. <#> I work on the happy hypothesis that if I can't see out, nobody else can see in and that 's fine by me. <#> Inside, hang heavily patterned nets and the dirt won't show. </p></I>
