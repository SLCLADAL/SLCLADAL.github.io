<W2C-001 Belfast Telegraph 1><I><W2C-001$A><W2C-001$B><h> <#> TWO WOMEN FOUND DEAD <#> Martin Hill and Nigel Gould </h><h> <#> Carrick murder inquiry </h><p> <#> A murder inquiry was launched today after a mother and daughter were found strangled in a house in Carrickfergus. </p><p> <#> The bodies of Kate Curran, in her 50s, and her 32-year-old daughter Angela were discovered in Mrs Curran 's Edenvale Avenue home. </p><p> <#> Another daughter, Patricia, is recovering from stab wounds after being slashed in the neck and wrists at her Coronation Road home two miles away. </p><p> <#> A man - believed to be her estranged husband - was found in bed at the house in Coronation Road. </p><p> <#> A man was taken to Whiteabbey hospital under police guard for treatment. </p><p> <#> He was discharged after two hours back into police custody for questioning. </p><p> <#> Police said that they seized knives at the Coronation Street house. </p><p> <#> They went to the house around 9am after receiving a telephone call. </p><p> <#> Shortly afterwards officers smashed their way into Mrs Curran 's bungalow where they found the victims ' bodies in separate rooms. </p><p> <#> <quote> "We are treating this as murder, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with it," </quote> an RUC spokesman said. </p><p> The killings are not believed to be terrorist-related. </p><p> <#> Eye witness Wilma Farrara, who is deaf, said she saw a man running up the path to the bungalow around 8.15am. </p><p> <#> Speaking through an interpreter she said: <quote> "I saw a man running up the path to the house. </p><p> <#> "I suppose it must have been about a quarter past eight. <#> I hadn't seen the man before. </p><p> <#> "I didn't see whether he went into the house or not. <#> And I didn't see him come out." </quote> </p><p> <#> Another neighbour, who didn't wish to be named, said she had seen the man in the area on previous occasions. </p><p> <#> Patricia was under heavy sedation at her home where she is being comforted by relatives. </p><p> <#> She is understood to have a nine-year-old daughter and worked with her sister at Neill 's newsagent shop in the Co Antrim village. </p><p> <#> Manageress Angela had been employed at the shop for 20 years while Patricia worked there three mornings a week. </p></I><I><W2C-001$C><W2C-001$D><h> <#> Terror alarm grows after UVF death bid <#> Gary Grattan and Oliver McGuckin </h><h> <#> Fear of widening campaign </h><p> <#> <bold> Fears were mounting today that loyalist terrorists are intent in extending their murder campaign across the province. </bold> </p><p> <#> Last night a motor mechanic beat off his would-be UVF killer at a garage near Cookstown, Tyrone. </p><h> <#> Offensive </h><p> <#> Security chiefs fear the UVF and UFF are planning to step-up their offensive by widening it to take in nationalist areas across Ulster. </p><p> <#> In the past ten days four Roman Catholic civilians have been murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast. </p><p> <#> Sinn Fein 's Sean Begley said last night 's attempted murder showed loyalist paramilitaries were intent on <quote> "intensifying and geographically extending their reign of terror."</quote> </p><p> <#> The motor mechanic banged his would-be killer 's head against the ground in a frantic life-or-death struggle, it was revealed today. </p><p> <#> The 25-year-old wrestled with the UVF gunman before fleeing to safety. </p><p> Details of his escape were today recounted by a friend as the intended victim recovered. </p><p> <#> The man was working at his garage at Dunamore Road at teatime yesterday when he was confronted by a masked man with a handgun. </p><p> <#> <quote> "He grabbed the gunman 's wrist, forcing the point of the gun downwards. <#> A shot was discharged, grazing my friend 's finger slightly. </p><p> <#> "He got his arm round his neck and ran him out on to the concrete where he banged his head twice against the ground," </quote> his friend said. </p><p> <#> <quote> "The gunman moaned and then a second man got out of a waiting car and shouted <quote> 'shoot the bastard' </quote> as he made towards the garage. </p><h> <#> Mate </h><p> <#> <quote> "My mate ran for his life at that stage as he knew he would have no chance against two of them," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> Detectives investigating the murder bid believe the terrorist may also have been injured. </p><p> <#> In a statement the UVF claimed responsibility for the attack and said the gun jammed. </p><p> <#> The gunman ran to a waiting red Triumph Acclaim car - registration VIA 1729. <#> It was later found burned out a mile away at Teebane Road close to where nine Protestant workmen were killed by a massive IRA landmine in January, 1992. </p><p> <#> The vehicle was bought in Craigavon yesterday for <*> pound sign </*> 50. <#> Police on Cookstown 66000 want to hear from anyone who saw it at any stage yesterday. </p><p> <#> The attack came just hours after RUC chief constable, Sir Hugh Annesley, warned that loyalist paramilitaries were intent on stepping-up their campaign of violence. </p><p> <#> It happened a mile from where plumber Martin McNamee was killed by a UVF booby-trap bomb in January this year. </p></I><I><W2C-001$E><h> <#> US visitors to meet SF delegates <#> Mark Simpson </h><p> <#> Irish-Americans on a fact-finding mission to Ireland today will meet a Sinn Fein delegation which includes Martin McGuinness. </p><p> <#> The group has already met the Republic 's Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and Ulster Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew, and today it completes its three-day visit with talks in west Belfast with Sinn Fein. </p><p> <#> Mr McGuinness, who is one of four in the delegation due to meet the Americans, was branded <quote> "Britain 's number one terrorist" </quote> by a TV documentary last month. <#> He vociferously denied the claim. </p><p> <#> Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams will lead the team which meets the Irish-Americans, who are led by former US Congressman Bruce Morrison. </p><p> <#> Sinn Fein plans to host a reception for the US visitors before the afternoon talks. <#> A party spokesman said: <quote> "It will involve community activists from nationalist parts of west Belfast. <#> It is not an exclusively republican reception." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Morrison will also meet the Alliance Party today - despite a rebuke for him and his colleagues yesterday by the party chairman, Dr Philip McGarry. </p><h> <#> Alliance </h><p> <#> Dr McGarry claimed Alliance had been snubbed by the US visitors and said: <quote> "Mr Morrison's credibility as a supposedly independent observer must be called into question when he finds it important to meet Sinn Fein, a party which appears to condone the murder of Irish people, but not the Alliance Party, the foremost advocate of peace." </quote> </p><p> <#> However, it emerged today that the Irish-Americans had since contacted Alliance. <#> Dr McGarry claimed it had been in response to the earlier statement and he welcomed the decision. </p><p> Mr Morrison and his colleagues travelled to Londonderry to meet SDLP leader John Hume this morning. <#> The former US Congressman was unavailable for comment. </p><p> <#> The DUP has refused to meet the US visitors because of their intention to speak to Sinn Fein. <#> The Ulster Unionists yesterday met the group at its Glengall Street headquarters. </p><p> <#> Mr Morrison said yesterday the group was in Ireland in a purely personal capacity, but would be reporting its findings to public and private officials on its return to the United States. <#> The group supports the idea of a special US envoy being sent to Northern Ireland. </p></I><I><W2C-001$F><h> <#> <quote> 'Spare my son, kill me' </quote> </h><p> <#> A Belfast mother begged UFF gunmen to kill her instead of her schoolboy son, an inquest heard yesterday. </p><p> <#> Gerard O'Hara (18) died in a hail of bullets as he sat watching television with his mother Bridget at their home at North Queen Street, Belfast, almost a year ago. </p><p> <#> Coroner Clifford Tughan heard yesterday that two masked gunmen burst into the house and shot the Belfast Telegraph newsboy, who was wounded 17 times by bullets and fragments. </p><p> <#> The UFF later said it carried out the killing, claiming their victim was a member of the Provisional IRA who had taken part in coffee jar bomb attacks on security forces. </p><h> <#> Arrests </h><p> <#> A detective inspector said, however, that Mr O'Hara had no known connection with terrorist activity and police viewed the killing as purely sectarian. </p><p> He said a number of people had been arrested in connection with the crime but were later released without charge. <#> He also said that two guns used had a history of previous use. </p><p> <#> In a statement read out at the Belfast inquest, Mrs O'Hara described how her youngest son had popped out to the shop moments earlier to buy cigarettes and sweets. </p><p> <#> When he came back he sat down with his mother to watch television.<p> <#> <quote> "Next thing I heard noises in the hallway and shots being fired. <#> The glass in the door shattered and fell in. <#> Gerard threw himself on the floor. <#> I don't know if he hit his head or a bullet hit him." </quote> </p><h> <#> Dead </h><p> <#> Mrs. O'Hara said she could see a gunman kneeling in the hallway firing into the room, and another gunman further along the hall. </p><p> <#> She cried out <quote> "Don't shoot my son, shoot me instead...he 's only a wee boy." </quote> </p><p> <#> She added <quote> "I knew in my heart Gerard was dead. <#> He was lying on the floor with blood coming from his head." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Tughan said <quote> "He was, without mercy, executed even as his mother pleaded on his behalf that she might be taken instead of her boy. </p><p> <#> "It was a killing which defies understanding and exposes the capacity for cruelty and evil within man which ultimately affects everyone in our community". </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-001$G><h> <#> THE MIGHTY QUINN <#> John Laverty </h><h> 'Goalden' strike as Bingham 's men reap triumph hat-trick </h><p> <#> <bold> Wet, wet, wet at Windsor Park....and win, win, win for Northern Ireland. <#> The rain lashed stadium last night bore witness to a little bit of footballing history, with Billy Bingham 's men recording a third successive World Cup victory for the first time. </bold> </p><p> <#> Goals from Jimmy Quinn - his first for three and a half years - and Philip Gray - his first in a Northern Ireland shirt - lifted the hearts of 6,500 fans who had braved the inclement elements. </p><p> <#> Sadly, the gloom of World Cup failure prevails; Denmark 's 1-0 defeat of Albania earlier in the day rendered even the most optimistic mathematician 's calculator redundant. </p><p> <#> The win-win-win sequence of recent months has a pleasing symmetry but the draw-wind-draw start to the campaign had already produced an incline that proved ultimately insurmountable. </p><h> <#> Low-key </h><p> <#> Perhaps that scenario led to the low-key approach to last night 's encounter which was more entertaining than the Test Card - but only just. </p><p> <#> Let 's not, however, dwell on negative aspects of what was after all a further morale boost to our international prospects. </p><p> <#> Bingham wants to leave a fitting legacy to his successor and all the signs point to him achieving this. </p><p> <#> Gray, for instance, looks a class act and although last night 's display was not his most dynamic in a green shirt he marked it with a goal of sheer quality. </p><p> <#> Right back Gary Fleming 's renaissance at international level is now complete, exemplified by another purposeful display. </p><p> <#> And Keith Rowland looked comfortable when he came on for his first cap in the second half...another lad who can do a useful job for Northern Ireland in years to come. </p><p> The night, however, belonged to Quinn, one of the oldest men on the park. </p><p> <#> Sceptics - myself included - questioned Bingham 's wisdom of picking the 33-year old Reading striker ahead of one of our more mobile midfielders such as O'Neill or Black. </p><p> <#> But Quinn, playing a withdrawn role behind the two main forwards responded with one of his best performances for Northern Ireland; easily the man of the match. </p><p> <#> He put the home side on their way with an excellent goal in the first half, had what looked like a perfectly good effort ruled out in the second and caused the Latvians all sorts of problems with his well timed runs from deep. </p><h> <#> Revelled </h><p> <#> His positioning helped Iain Dowie - the pair have tended to get in each others ' way on past occasions - and Dowie revelled in the extra space. </p><p> Like Quinn, this was one of his best displays on a murky night when no Northern Ireland player could be faulted for effort. </p><p> <#> The home side dominated a first half climaxed by Quinn 's goal after 33 minutes. </p><p> <#> Michael Hughes swung in a corner kick from the right and the big striker timed his run perfectly to glance a header past Oleg Karavaev. </p><p> <#> Quinn nearly got a second just before the break but this time Kavavaev was equal to a close-range effort after Gerry Taggart had provided the opportunity with a bustling header. </p><p> <#> Quinn 's steady head found the rigging again midway through the second half, from new skipper Nigel Worthington 's cross, but this time the 'goal' was disallowed. </p><p> <#> Video re-runs hinted that Dowie had impeded a defender thus giving Quinn the necessary space but it seemed a harsh decision. </p><p> <#> It would have given Northern Ireland breathing space; at 1-0 there was still a trace of anxiety in their play and Latvia, for whom Popkob and Charando had looked dangerous in the first half were never totally out of it. </p><h> <#> Unlucky </h><p> <#> Taggart was unlucky to see a header, from the impressive Fleming 's cross-shot cannon back off the crossbar but Northern Ireland made the game safe ten minutes from the end. </p><p> <#> Again Fleming was involved, linking up with Mal Donaghy before finding Gray on the edge of the penalty area. </p><p> <#> The new Sunderland striker steadied himself before blasting an unstoppable left-foot drive past Karavaev. </p><p> <#> The back-lift was imperceptible, unlike the joy in the Northern Ireland camp. </p><p> <#> Binghams 's men had reigned in the rain; what a pity the deluge of good results had come to late to save the harvest. </p></I>
