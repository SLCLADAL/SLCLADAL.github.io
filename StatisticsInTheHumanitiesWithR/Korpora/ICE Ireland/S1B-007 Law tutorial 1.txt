<ICE-IRE:S1B-007 Law tutorial 1><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Uhm and I 'll suggest to you that there are three main types and Maire will tell us one of the three main types of harm in relation <,> or in respect of which a duty of care can be owed<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$B> <#> Physical harm<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right <#> Physical harm <,> including what <,> <#> Uh uh uh physical harm <.> i </.> including what <,> I mean<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$C> <#> Psychiatric harm<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right psychiatric harm <#> I mean that that 's <,> yeah <#> Physical harm including psychiatric harm <#> A duty of care can be owed in relation to what else Ken <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$D> <#> Financial loss<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right <,> economic loss <#> And what 's the other category <#> William<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> Property damage<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right <#> Damage to property <#> So we 're going to look at those three <#> Uh <.> go </.> we 're going to look at psychiatric harm first of all and then we 'll look just very shortly at the relationship between damage to property and damage <,> or sorry economic loss because uhm there 's one case in particular that illustrates that there 's not always a bright line distinction between the two <,> <#> Right physical harm including psychiatric harm is <,> and we we 'll talk about <.> s </.> the <.> psychia </.> psychiatric aspect of it <,> the psychiatric harm aspect <#> We 've already looked at a lot of cases where somebody suffers an injury for example they lose a leg <,> Baker and Willoughby and so on and so forth <#> Uhm <,> the literature makes a distinction between two types of victims for purposes of psychiatric harm <#> What are they<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$C> <#> Primary and secondary<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right primary and secondary uhm victims <#> Can you tell us what a primary victim is then<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$C> <#> Uhm that was <,> that 's somebody who has had the actual harm done to them <,> no in fact was actually at the accident or the incident personally there<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$C> <#> And witnessed everything first hand <,> as it happened to them<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Yeah <#> Yeah <#> Happened happened to them is is the key <#> The <.> pri </.> the primary victim is somebody for example who 's in a car crash and they they 're they 're injured they suffer physical injuries and they subsequently develop psychiatric injuries after that <#> They 're called the primary victim <#> Or there 's a case called Paige and Smith <#> Did anybody come across the <.> Pai </.> case Paige and Smith <,> which is a slight variation on that <#> Anybody <#> Was well it was basically somebody was in an <.> acc </.> in an accident but they didn't suffer any physical injury but they they went on to develop psychiatric injuries anyway <#> Uh it was held that a duty of care prevailed in that instance as well and that that was a primary victim <#> So a primary victim is somebody who 's injured <,> they suffer physical injury or it could be somebody standing for example at a bus stop and a bus uh mounts the pavement and you know basically takes the end off their nose but they don't suffer any physical injury but they develop psychiatric uh injuries as a result of that <#> They 're primary victims <#> What 's a secondary victim then <,> Carl<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$F> <#> It 's when uhm somebody who 's related to the victim or suffers psychiatric damage from someone else 's injury <#> Like there was a case of a mother and a car crash wasn't there<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Yeah <#> Yeah and there 's there 's McLoughlin and O'Brien <#> Is that the case <#> Right <#> <.> Ca </.> can you tell us a little bit about that case <#> What<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$F> <#> It 's the one with a mother where uhm she was phoned up to say that her family had been in a car accident <{> <[> and </[> she rushed over to the hospital and she got there and she found them all injured and one of them dead <#> And she went on to suffer post-traumatic stress or something was it<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Mhm <#> And what did the court say were the conditions that governed<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$F> <#> What was <#> Immediate aftermath was one it was<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right immediate aftermath <#> And what was it <,> <.> yo </.> <.> yo </.> you used the word actually earlier on <#> I mean a mother and daughter are what <#> Or mother and children are what<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$?> <#> Next-of-kin<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right <#> Or or family <#> Or basically uhm McLoughlin and O'Brien said that you can sue <,> <.> base </.> a secondary victim can sue if they can establish first of all a close tie of love or affection <#> Yeah go ahead<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$G> <#> Can I just ask <,> is uhm can you be a secondary victim uh just with onlooking <,> without actually having any emotional ties to the people <#> Can that count <{1> <[1> like </[1> if <,> if you see an accident <{2> <[2> without </[2> being personally involved with it<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> <[1> No well </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> <[2> No </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> No there 's there 's the close tie of love and affection thing <#> If if you look at the uhm <,> we 'll come we 'll come back and we 'll talk about the White case in a moment uh which is where some police officers failed on the on the secondary victim or because they didn't have close ties of love and affection <#> Uhm but it 's <.> basic </.> uhm you you can succeed if you can show that you 've a close tie of love or affection with the primary victim <,> for for example a parent and the child or spouse or some <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <#> And uh one of these elusive phrases there 's a proximity in time and in place to the accident <#> So in McLoughlin and O'Brien the mother of the uh children arrived at the hospital afterwards but there was sufficient proximity in time and uh place to the accident <#> Uh I 'm I 'm going through this very quickly because I want <,> as I say I want to go and I want to concentrate on the local authority stuff so if you 've any questions as we 're going through this uh <.> rai </.> raise your hand and ask them <#> What about the White case <#> William can you tell us basically the context of the White case<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> Uhm <,> was that uhm <,> was that something to do with Hillsborough or am I thinking of something else<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Yeah that was yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> Uhm a claim by five police officers who said they 'd suffered uhm physical or sorry psychiatric injury due to the duties they undertook <#> And uh the House of Lords decided that three to two that uhm the defendants were not liable because uhm what was what were you saying there about no ties of love and affection yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Yeah <#> Yeah <#> In <.> rela </.> in relation to <.> th </.> the argument that they could be secondary victims the House of Lords said well there 's there 's no tie of love or affection <#> What was what was the wider context cos there 's there 's another good example of another one of these very obvious uhm cases where the House of Lords decides that we have to come up with a particular outcome <#> What was the backdrop to this case <#> I mean one of the cases that preceded it is discussed in it<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$D> <#> Alcock<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right the Alcock case can you tell us about it <#> I mean not not in any detail <,> but <.> wha </.> what basically happened in that case<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$D> <#> Uh sixteen secondary victims sued for damage and they did not meet the three criteria set out for secondary victims <,> love and affection <,> immediate aftermath <,> uhm direct perception of the<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Mhm <#> Yeah <#> The Alcock case <,> the the the Alcock case the courts modified uhm McLoughlin and O'Brien and added in I think they used phrases <,> I mean what was the phrase you used <,> direct <,> <.> obser </.> <,> direct observation or something<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> Direct perception<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Direct perception <#> Uh a phrase sometimes used as well is that you witnessed the event with your own unaided senses because some <,> many of these victims were people who had watched <,> were relatives who had <.> s </.> watched the uh images of the Hillsborough disaster on television and uh the courts said well this isn't your own unaided <,> uh <,> but any <,> the context <,> the the the point that goes with the context was basically relatives of people who 'd been killed in the Hillsborough disaster uhm were unable to claim damages as secondary victims <#> What happened in the White case uh initially <#> Cos this was a case involving police officers who who had been on the scene <#> They hadn't actually been involved in pulling people out necessarily <,> so <,> but they 'd been on the scene at Hillsborough <#> What what what happened then <#> And why was this such a political judgement on the part of the House of Lords <,> or not political <,> sorry but not political with a small P or politically correct if you like<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$H> <#> Uhm there well there was difficulty uhm with people that seen it on television making claims <#> Uhm is that<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Well the the that goes to the main <,> well the the difficulty basically that the House of Lords uh and I think Lord Hoffman identified it himself he said look hold on a second <,> the relatives of these people weren't going weren't able to succeed in the Alcock case uhm and basically it 's going to appear as a manifest injustice if the relatives of people who have been killed can't recover damages but police officers who were there working are able to recover damages <#> Uhm there are a whole <,> there there are several lines of argument and there 's an argument about the employer 's responsibility to his employees or to uhm and <,> and uhm it 's been argued that uh the employer would get <,> the employer owes a duty in respect of physical well-being also owes owes a duty of care in respect of uh psychiatric well-being <#> And the House of Lords said well yeah but there 's no physical injury in this case so the the arguments about psychiatric injury don't follow through <#> It also said they 're not secondary victims <#> They can't claim as secondary victims because as William said they don't have the <.> s </.> the requisite tie of love and affection <#> Uh there 's also a point about rescuers and if you 're a rescuer you may be able to uhm obtain damages for psychiatric injury but the House of Lords again said well rescuers yes but that would imply that there was some sort of physical threat themselves and said the police officer <,> one of the police officers who was claiming was at the morgue and they said well there there 's no question uh that these people were in any physical danger so therefore they can't succeed as rescuers either <#> The White case <#> Uhm <,> what about the W and Essex County Council case <#> This is uh uh one that leads neatly to consideration of the local authority case law more fully <#> W and Essex County Council <#> There was great excitement this year because there was an Essex County Council case reported on the news in the morning and we thought this was going to be W and Essex but it wasn't <#> But what happened in W and Essex <#> First of all <.> wha </.> <.> wha </.> what had happened in the W and Essex case <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E?> <#> The plaintiffs were parents of four young children who had agreed to adopt an adolescent <{> <[> <#> They </[> uhm uh spoke to Essex County Council and said they were very very definitely not prepared to take anybody in who had a history of child abuse<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E?> <#> And of course they got somebody who 'd uhm been accused of abusing his sister and some other unsavoury behaviour and uhm he uh was claimed to have abused all four of the children and the family said as a result they suffered uhm psychiatric psychiatric illness<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Who who who suffered<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> The uh children and the parents<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Yeah well the the <,> yeah <,> right<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> And uh I think uh this <,> was this a <,> case was a <.> prelim </.> preliminary question wasn't it<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Yes <#> Now tell tell us what the preliminary point is cos this is very important when we move on what we <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> In the wake of <,> can't remember what case case it was in the wake of actually but uhm a lot of cases were being struck out <,> but <{> <[> because the courts </[> were saying there 's no duty of care so this won't go any further<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> <[> On <.> wha </.> what </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Yeah <#> This was <,> this was we 're going to talk more about striking out later on but basically this case had been struck out on a preliminary point that hadn't gone to a full hearing <#> Uhm and <,> what <.> wa </.> <.> wa </.> was the point about psychiatric harm <,> we 'll come back to striking out <,> you can bear that in mind uh for the moment <#> What was the point about psychiatric harm in this case<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$?> <#> Whether they were going to equate it with physical harm or not<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Whether there was what sorry<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$?> <#> They were going to equate it with physical injury<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$A> <#> Right there was this question about physical injury and also there <.> wa </.> there was a point about time and place <,> proximity in time and place <#> And what what did the House of Lord <,> what did the House of Lords basically say in W and Essex County Council about psychiatric injury <#> You 're right <,> they were talking about equating it with physical injury and they also said something about the McLoughlin and O'Brien type approach to proximity in time and place <#> Because basically the children had been abused over a period of time and then the parents hadn't witnessed this but then uhm the children had uh suffered obviously as a result of this and the parents claimed that they were suffering as a result of this <#> What did the court say about their approach to the question of time and place in psychiatric injury <#> Anybody<ICE-IRE:S1B-007$E> <#> It depends on the facts of the case</I>
