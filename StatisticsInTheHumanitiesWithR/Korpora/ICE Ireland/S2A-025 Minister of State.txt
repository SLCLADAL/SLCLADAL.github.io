<ICE-IRE:S2A-025 Minister of State><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-025$A> <#> Alderman <,> Education and Library Board <,> Chairman <,> chief executives <,> distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen <,> that was most generous of you and I deeply appreciate what you said <#> For my part <,> I agree with you <#> The quintessence of training I shall remember that phrase <#> <.> Politi </.> <.> ticians </.> usually <.> lo </.> use <,> long words in order to uh <,> disguise the truth <#> You 've used long words to exemplify it <#> And I think that 's right <#> What gives me particular pleasure is not so much to be associated again with the quintessence of educational training <,> but to look around this room and see so many people whom five and a half years ago I didn't know <,> and who I now consider to be personal friends <#> That 's a measure <,> at a personal level <,> of what it has meant to me to be Education Minister in Northern Ireland for almost five years <#> Whatever I may have done for you <,> at a personal level you have more than repaid it in friendship and support and encouragement and in the professionalism with which people here do their jobs <#> And I thank you <#> And I thank you also Chairman for inviting Betty to be part of today 's proceedings <#> It was not my initiative that brought her across the Irish Sea this morning it was yours and I thank you for that <,> typically generous touch <#> I should also start by apologising for being late <#> Indeed uh I had to uh leave the talks with the permission of the Secretary of State and uh John Hume with whom we were actually in discussion when the clock said if I don't go now I 'll never get there <,> and I know that if I didn't get there Gerry Moag would give me hell for the rest of my life <#> So I 'm uh <,> I apologise for that delay and it also explains why I won't be able to stay as long as otherwise I would have hoped to do <#> One of the things I learnt when I was Education Minister was that there are some who before they want to feel the quality of education want to feel the width of the cheque <#> This unit represents about three hundred thousand pounds of capital investment and will have a budget of about one point two million pounds a year <,> roughly two thirds of that coming from the Boards and uh one third from the Department <#> Wrong <#> Two thirds from the Department and one third from the Boards <#> Five Chief Executives breathe a sigh of relief <&> laughter </&> <#> I promised all of you that the necessary training for education reform would be properly funded <#> I 'm here today to claim the fulfilment of at least part of that promise <#> This represents a promise kept <#> It also represents as you said Alderman Semple uh an exciting initiative between the five Education and Library Boards in the Department <#> And I pay tribute to all six <#> I can do it now for Department officials inasmuch as they are answerable now to someone else <#> Their commitment to the concept of training and to this unit never wavered <#> And all of you owe them a debt of gratitude <#> But I know that Mr Carville and others who are here will not take it amiss if I say that this unit is really a monument to five other people <#> When we got into the discussions of education reform <,> one of the things that I learned was that <,> it not only helped if I could take the chief executives with me <,> but it helped even more if I could give them opportunities to give some indication as to how we should proceed <#> It was they who were instrumental in persuading me that the Boards ought to have a major say in training <#> And having won that position they didn't stop but went further <#> They then persuaded me that as well as Boards having individual responsibilities for training there was need for a central <,> a regional training unit so that some of the training which would otherwise have been replicated five times over could be done centrally <#> And out of that series of persuasive discussions <,> this unit was born <#> And I know what it 's called <,> but it is actually a monument to the five chief executives of the Education and Library Boards in Northern Ireland <#> And whatever the title on the top of the notepaper that is how I will view it from here on in <,> <#> You mentioned sir that we got on with the job <#> I see no point in hanging around when there is a job to be done and everyone agrees that it should be done <,> and where it should be done <,> and how it should be done <,> and we can find the money to do it <#> And Mr Moag reminded me that it 's probably about eighteen months since I met Mr McCullough and Canon Nolan and walked around this site and they said <,> This is where it 's going to be and I said <,> fine <,> and eighteen months later it 's up and running <#> And that 's important <#> It 's important first of all because it demonstrates that Education can get on with the job and can deliver <#> And it is important secondly because it demonstrates that when people have clear-cut priorities and clear-cut objectives to achieve <,> and there is no confusion <,> then they can get on with doing the job in a way which is to the benefit of everyone <#> And I congratulate all of those who have played a part in delivering this unit so quickly and to such good effect <#> I suppose in these days of suspicion I have to say <,> not that it probably needs to be said <,> that I had absolutely no hand in picking the director <,> which is probably a good job because he was the year above me at school <,> and we 've known each other for a long time <,> and I 'm reliably informed that he has improved immeasurably since those days at school <&> laughter </&> <,> and as a consequence will be a very fine director <#> And John I wish you and your staff every possible success <&> applause </&> <#> This unit is here for the benefit of teachers <,> Board personnel <,> school governors <,> and all of those who have a role in delivering education reform <#> It will offer them assistance in a variety of forms <,> that 's part of its strength <#> But let 's not lose sight of its ultimate objective <#> Its ultimate objective is the benefit of the young people of Northern Ireland <#> That 's what education is all about <#> It can't be delivered without teachers <#> It can't be delivered without administrators <#> It can't be delivered without civil servants <#> Forgive me for saying so but it can't even be delivered without ministers <#> It most certainly can't be delivered without parents <#> But ultimately education is about children <#> Taking the talents and abilities that they 've got and ensuring that those are developed to the maximum <#> Whatever that talent <,> whatever that ability <,> refusing to believe that any child has got no ability <,> but developing <,> coaxing <,> training <,> stimulating <,> exciting <,> disciplining <,> so that they develop their full potential as men and women <,> to contribute to the society into which they will move from school and to enjoy the self <.> ex </.> esteem and the self-confidence from comes <,> which comes from knowing that they themselves have developed as human beings <#> That 's what this unit is about <#> Education reform had two principles and I suspect if we had an assessment for forty-four year olds most of you would now pass <,> to improve standards and to give parents greater say and involvement in the education of their children <#> And to that end <,> to meet those two goals a variety of objectives <,> a variety of changes were introduced <,> but they were all introduced to meet one or other or both of those goals <#> And because it involved change <,> and because as human beings we don't like change very much <,> and in Northern Ireland we like change even less than we like it in other parts of the Kingdom <,> training and encouragement and help is an essential part of that delivery <#> And that 's what this unit is about <#> It 's about helping all of those who have a part to play in the education of our children <#> I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this unit will play that role <,> will play it under the direction of the Department <,> under the direction of the Boards and the five chief officers <,> Chief Executives to whom this is a monument <#> We 'll do it under your direction John <,> and with the help and the co-operation of all of the other education and educational training bodies that are represented here <,> not to the greater glory of any of you <,> and most certainly not to the greater glory of government but to the greater glory of our children <,> in whom all of our futures are invested <,> <#> I miss you all <#> I 'm delighted to have been invited back to conclude this particular aspect of something which I started eighteen months ago <#> I thank you for that honour <,> and I formally declare the unit open <&> applause </&></I>
