<W2F-019 Bridie's Wedding><I><W2F-019$A><h> <#> BRIDIE 'S WEDDING </h><p> <#> Bridie sits on the window sill and sips hot milk and pepper. <#> Sheila kneels by her side. <#> From beneath the bedclothes she peeps out at them. <#> The streetlamp strokes orange onto their long white nighties and again across the curlers bumped tightly over their heads. <#> Their whispers stay with them over there by the window but the odd one strays across the room and delicious it is when it 's caught. <#> Bridie is afraid of something, something to do with Joe. <#> But who on earth would be scared of Joe? <#> His swinging smile and adam 's apple like a bouncing ball. <#> And Sheila is thrilled by the same something. <#> So what could it be? <#> It had to do with being nude. <#> Milly says when you get married you <it> have </it> to go nude. <#> But Bridie would never do that. <#> Why even in here, in front of her sisters, she would undress herself as if she was an orange in a circus. <#> An orange that unpeels itself under a tent. <#> Fancy being afraid of Joe. <#> Oul Joe ... </p><p> <#> Meat sweat sneaks up the stairs and wakes her. <#> Oh and the smell of cooking so early makes her feel funny; half-queasy, half-hungry. <#> She opens her eyes and the room is alive. <#> With crisp dress cloth and perfume hissing and stockings slapping into place. <#> And Bridie 's face like a small white turnip through the mirror and then changing slowly with each sweep of colour into a bride for Joe. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I 'm burstin', </quote> she says to anyone who is listening and Sheila says, <quote> 'You 'll have to wait. <#> <it> If </it> you don't mind. <#> Mr Clifford is in there.' </quote> </p><p> <#> But she doesn't mind. <#> She lies back nursing the urge and imagines what it will be like to sleep alone. <#> Now that Bridie is almost gone. </p><p> <#> Eileen says, <quote> 'Quick, he 's finished,' </quote> and they all stop to listen to the cough that he gives each time he comes out of the bathroom. </p><p> <#> He 's left the smell of himself inside so she holds her nose and tries not to breathe. <#> He 's left the heat of himself as well around the rim of the toilet seat. <#> And some dead black hairs stuck in the foam of his shaving soap. <#> She washes her face and looks into the mirror. <#> She makes two circles from her fingers and places them over her eyes. <#> Just to get an idea of what she 'll be like... </p><p> <#> Back in the bedroom Kay helps her to dress. <#> Guiding her frock down over her arms and playing the skirt until it stands stiff and wide. <#> There are petticoats underneath that push it into shape and above a thin skin of peach organza with roses that you can see right through. <#> Kay ties her sash and flicks out the bow, then slowly turns her towards the mirror. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Now,' </quote> she says, <quote> 'what do you see?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Oh Kay...it 's so lovely.' </quote> </p><p> <#> And then looking again, <quote> 'do you know? <#> It 's the image of that frock Eileen once had. <#> You know the one in the picture that time at the Dress Dance?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Well, there you are,' </quote> says Kay. <quote> <#> 'Isn't that a coincidence?' </quote> </p><p> <#> Eddie says he 'll walk back from North William St Church, because there isn't enough room in the car. <#> But there is. <#> Right beside her. <#> She tries to tell him. <#> But he doesn't seem to hear. </p><p> <#> And even though he walks away, his hands still in his pockets and his eyes supervising his steps, she still sits the same say, her dress bunched up into a hump. <#> So that Eddie 's space stays vacant all the way home. </p><p> <#> Inside the house now and so many people. <#> They all seem to know her, but she only knows some. <#> Jack comes up the brown stairs, a tray over his head, shouting <quote> 'Load coming through' </quote> again and again. <#> And all the old Aunts laugh and say he 's a scream. <#> There 's sherry and port wine for each of the ladies and stout for the men and whiskey as well. <#> And each glass grows its own deep colour from stem up to brim. <#> Bridie 's cheeks are stained with prints of strange kisses and Joe stands by her side shaking all hands and giggling out of his freshly scrubbed face. <> The tray with the meat comes up and Mr Costelloe looks down at it, grinning approval as proud as a father. <#> And everyone says that her dress is so pretty and twirl after twirl is called for until she is dizzy. <#> Funny though, Mr Clifford says nothing at all. </p><p> <#> And she looks around bursting with pride at the stacks of strange crockery on the sideboard. <#> Oh and if only Milly would believe that they own every piece of it... </p><#> And the table that Jack made is now a whole village with Bridie 's best sheets the snow on its ground. <#> Platters of meat lie low at its centre, the square around which all else has been built. <#> There 's mountains of bread, buttered and sliced, and big fat tomatoes heaped into hills. <#> Skinned scallions, cleaner than she 's ever seen, sprout like trees from pint glasses. <#> And lettuce leaves lie in hammock layers on top of four plates that stand at each corner. <#> Small pots of thick mustard squat shoulder to shoulder. <#> And butter tubs face them across the way. <#> And now at last it 's time to eat, now the dishes of little beady potatoes are coming, their flaky new skin threatening to shed. </p><p> <#> Charlie picks up one of Mrs Dolan 's knives and spanks a glass until silence falls. <quote> <#> 'Now,' </quote> he says, his face all red. <quote> <#> 'If you 'll all please help yourselves...' </quote> </p><p> <#> She walks across to the window and peeps through its curtain. <#> And why is Milly so late? <#> Beneath her is the smaller table. <#> Glass bowls, trifle bursting out from their rims like a fat lady 's thigh bursts out from her stocking top and pudgy sponge buns lie back and wait along cake-stands out for the day from the Boston Bakery. <#> The box of chocolates takes up most of the space. <#> Row after row of matt brown jewels. <#> And Mrs Dolan is beside her saying, <quote> 'Go on. <#> Take one. <#> Your tongue 's hanging out.' </quote> </p><p> <#> She reaches across and then remembers Kay. <quote> <#> 'No. <#> I 'll wait. <#> It 's all right.' </quote> </p><p> <#> Mrs Dolan starts to insist. <#> But then Millicent Green walks right into the room and she forgets the chocolates, every last one. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Oh Milly. <#> Hello. <#> I thought you 'd never get here.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Mother said I must wait. <#> Seeing as I wasn't <it> really </it> invited.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Yes, you were so.' </p> </quote><p> <quote> <#> 'Well, not to the whole thing.' </p> </quote><p> <#> Milly looks cross so she says, <quote> 'Your dress is gorgeous,' </quote> and then, <quote> 'do you like mine?' </quote> positioning herself for yet another twirl.</p><p> <quote> <#> 'Not bad for a cut-off.' </p> </quote><p> <quote> <#> 'What do you mean...?' </p> </quote><p> <#> 'Hmmm,' Milly says, <quote> 'my mother is a dressmaker. <#> Don't forget.' </quote> <#> And then walks away to peep through the adults and the table behind them. <#> She comes back in a minute with, <quote> 'I see you have our china.' </p> </quote><p> <quote> <#> 'Oh. <#> Well, thanks for the loan.' </p> </quote><p> <quote> <#> 'Oh, don't mention it. <#> It 's not our best set.' </p> </quote><p> <#> Milly is being so mean, she might not tell her about the glasses. <#> Just arrive in with them as though they don't matter. <#> Creak open the box and slowly take them out. <#> Hawing the lenses and dusting them over first before inspecting them against the light. <#> Yes, Millie can <it> just </it> wait. </p><p> <#> Downstairs in the kitchen Mother fits dessert dishes into each other. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Where 's Eddie?' </quote> she asks. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Oh he wanted to walk.' </quote> </p><p> <#> Mother looks over at the clock on the wall and frowns. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I see Granny Green has arrived,' </quote> Eileen says, pushing past her. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Her name is Millicent,' </quote> she answers back. </p><p> <#> She walks out to the scullery and Sheila is whispering to Lily Fossett. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Bridie put them under the sofa, you see. <#> To keep them safe. <#> And you never guess what that drunken blaggard did?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'No, what?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Fell asleep on the sofa. <#> And peed in his trousers. <#> And it dribbled down through the cushions. <#> The chocolates were destroyed.' </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Oh my God. <#> Did you throw them out?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'No. <#> We didn't dare. <#> After Mr Clifford buying them. <#> Of all people ...Eileen washed them. <#> They're upstairs on the sweet table. <#> Just make sure you don't eat any. <#> And here. <#> Promise you won't tell.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Don't be so silly. <#> As if...' </quote> </p><p> <#> She walks up the stairs and her face is on fire. <#> How could he? <#> The chocolates. <#> Mr Clifford 's chocolates. <#> Poor Mother... </p><p> <#> Millicent is standing in the hall. <quote> <#> 'This is so boring,' </quote> she says. <quote> <#> 'They're all half piddley-eyed in there. <#> I 'm sorry I came.'</p> </quote><p> <quote> <#> 'Why don't you go in and have a few chocolates?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Where?' </quote> Milly brightens up. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Are you going to give us an oul song?' </quote> Mrs Clancy asks and then turning to her husband, <quote> 'she 's a great little one on the pian-o.' </quote> </p><p> <#> But Mrs Clancy is only saying it. <#> Just because she knows she 's heard what she 'd really been saying. <#> About her new glasses and her a disgrace her mother being a poor 'Wida-woman' and having to take in a lodger just to make ends meet. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I don't know...' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Ah come on. <#> What about "All for Marie 's Wedding"? <#> I 've heard you play that before. <#> You do a lovely job on it altogether.' </quote> </p><p> <#> Charlie walks in then and Mrs Clancy hooks on to this elbow. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Tell her, Charlie. <#> Tell her to play "All for Marie 's Wedding".' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Yes,' </quote> he says. <quote> <#> 'Go on. <#> That 's your special song.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I 'll have to get my music...' </quote><p> <quote> <#> 'Go on then. <#> We 'll wait. <#> Promise. <#> Where is it?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'In my schoolbag.' </quote> </p><p> <#> No colour comes through on the skylight, now that it 's dark. <#> She knocks at the door and slowly she opens it. <#> The shaft from the landing makes a path for her to follow. <#> Her hand pokes under the candlewick spread, and it rubs its gentle fleece against her arm. <#> There she feels the bag and slides it to her. </p><p> <#> She hears a thud then and the shaft from the landing slithers off. </p><p> <#> And everything moves so slowly, it 's almost as if it 's not moving at all, as if it 's not happening. <#> There are hands, she knows, that lift her up from the side of the bed. <#> And at first she <}> <-> think </-> </+> thinks </+> </}> it 's someone looking for another twirl. <#> But then she feels herself flop onto the mattress and bounce softly before being slipped over onto her back. </p><p> <#> And then she sees him. <#> So that 's who it is. <#> There at the end of that outstretched arm. <#> That 's his large hand pushing her small hands away. <#> And pulling at her dress too, and tearing its roses that you can see right through. <#> His second hand is a separate animal nibbling at the buttons in his trousers fly. <#> His face is growing nearer and keeps saying shh, shh. <#> Even though her screams are no more than a catch in her throat. </p><p> <#> And then her hands go all quiet on her and lie dead by her side. <#> And why oh why would they not move? <#> He is taking something out of his trousers now. <#> And one knee is up on the bed and now the other is copying it. <#> And everything so black that she cannot see. <#> She can hear though, the shh shh and shh shh. <#> And downstairs too the cheering and laughter and Charlie speaking thickly the words that he 's practised all week. <#> But her breath gets so tight that the sounds fade away. <#> And she is going to faint...just about to go when... </p><p> <#> Suddenly they move again, her sleeping hands. <#> And like two little birds they curl themselves inwards and tighten for a moment before they fly upward and... </p><p> <#> PUNCH straight up, each taking a lens of his glasses. <#> SMASH they both to into an instant spider 's web. <#> And he falls backwards and stumbles to the floor. </p><p> <#> Her legs take her somehow over to the door and as it swings towards her the dressing-gown scrapes her face and brings her scream back to her. <#> As though it had only been hiding. </p><p> <#> There 's singing downstairs and feet bangbanging on the parlour floor. <#> Eddie sits hunched in a corner of the hall. <#> He looks slowly up at her but then his elbow slips and his head falls back down. </p><p> <#> She wants to tell him. <#> To run and shake him, to make her screams turn into words. <#> She wants him to bash Mr Clifford before he sneaks out the back way. <#> For already she can hear him gather his things. <#> Eddie will get him. <#> Eddie is the one. <#> Sheila might kill her - the price of the glasses. <#> And now the lodger 's money gone. <#> What about Kay? <#> Oh look at her dress. <#> Her lovely organza...<#> Oh Kay...<#> And Mother. <#> What would Mother say? <#> What does she say again when she brings tales from school? <quote> <#> 'Well you must have deserved it.' </quote> <#> Yes that 's what she says. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Eddie,' </quote> she shouts and her feet start to move. <#> One step then two...<#> But the song from the parlour makes them stop:<p> <#> Step we gaily on we go,<#> Heel for heel and toe for toe.<#> Arm in arm and row on row... </p><p> <#> They are singing her song. <#> Her special song. <#> They started without her. <#> As if she wasn't there. <#> But it doesn't sound right. <#> Something is wrong. </p><p> <#> She sits down on the stairs and it comes to her then. <#> Yes, that 's it. <#> They have changed the words. <#> Instead of 'All for Marie 's Wedding' they were singing 'All for Bridie 's'. </p><p> <#> One word and now it was a different song. </p></I>
