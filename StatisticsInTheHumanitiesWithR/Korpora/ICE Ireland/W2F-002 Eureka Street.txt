<W2F-002 Eureka Street></I><W2F-002$A><p> <#> That night I went to see Mary. <#> I still didn't know where she lived so I landed up at the bar where she worked. <#> As I went in, the Protestant bouncer showed me, with a turn of his puffy shoulders, that he was sick of the sight of me. <#> My eye had already turned dark where the man with the bed had hit me earlier. <#> I must have looked insalubrious. <#> I guessed the bouncer might show some form if I pissed him off too much so I gave him a special smile. </p><p> <#> Mary 's face went sick when she saw me. <#> I saw a mumbled word between her and a colleague and the colleague approached me and asked me what I wanted to drink. <#> I lied and she brought me some beer. </p><p> <#> I sat there for two hours, beer upon beer. <#> I hated bars but it was a difficult city in which to lead a life without them. <#> In the end, some shame in me made me just walk up to her and ask her to talk to me. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Give me a minute,' </quote> she said wearily. </p><p> <#> She whispered some more with her friend and then grabbed her coat and stood by my table. <#> Her face was grim. <#> She didn't look like she meant to go anywhere nice with me. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Not here,' </quote> she said. </p><p> <#> She took me to a swish hamburger joint nearby. <#> We sat and drank cheap coffee. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'What happened to your eye?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I was moving furniture.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'What?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I hit my head against something.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I don't believe you.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'You don't have to.' </quote> </p><p> <#> There was a pause. <#> Not a comfortable one. <#> She looked at me. <#> Her eyes shone and I knew there was bad news and bad news. <#> She gave me the bad news first. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I want you to leave me alone,' </quote> she said. </p><p> <#> It wasn't easy to take this talk from her but I guessed that she had made a lot of things not happen. <#> She wasn't treasuring any memories and I was making myself one big drag. <#> But there was that love we 'd made which she could not delete. <#> It was less than a week and my mouth still tasted of her mouth. <#> I felt like I could breathe her breath. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Mary, I can't leave you alone. <#> I don't want to leave you alone. <#> That makes it complicated.' </quote> </p><p> <#> Her face went slack and her mouth trembled in a way that made it so very difficult not to just kiss her right there. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'What do you want from me?' </quote> </p><p> <#> And what did I want from her? <#> I wanted her hand on my face, her head bent for me, her lips on mine. <#> I wanted her to say soft words that would make my heart lurch and my face burn. </p><p> <#> I gave her that. <#> Exactly. <#> Word for word. <#> That wasn't bad going and I imagined there 'd be some big reward for all that unblank prose. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'You don't understand.' </quote> <#> Her voice was gentler, more permissive after all my fancy talk. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'What don't I understand?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'It 's impossible.' </quote> </p><p> <#> I had a series of great speeches in stock all about possibility and impossibility. <#> And it was hard not to feel optimistic sitting there amongst the bright plastic and the teenage bon vivants with all the primary colours making shapes in Mary 's eyes. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Impossibility never stopped anything actually happening.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'But I love Paul. <#> I don't want to hurt him.' </quote> </p><p> <#> Paul was the cop boyfriend. <#> I couldn't muster much feeling for his civilian predicament. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'It 's just impossible,' </quote> she continued. </p><p> <#> I was energized, ardent. <quote> <#> 'You're right. <#> It isn't possible. <#> Or likely. <#> Or even democratic. <#> Nobody gave you the right to make me feel like this.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'And what about Sarah?' </quote> </p><p> <#> I was briefly impressed by her high-grade memory. <quote> <#> 'Sarah? <#> That 's old love, that 's dead love. <#> That 's love that never was. <#> I do her no disservice. <#> I doubt that she remembers me at all.' </quote> </p><p> <#> The sick look returned to her face. <#> The one she had worn when she saw me first that night. <#> Her mouth pursed under some assumption of sisterhood. <quote> <#> 'Two years ' time, you 'd say the same of me.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Would I?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Yes.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Would you like some long odds on that?' </quote> </p><p> <#> She smiled, pleased and flattered despite her firm intentions. <#> I 'd never had a problem with vanity. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'I'm going to marry him,' </quote> she said. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'That 's what you think.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'What would you know about it?' </quote> </p><p> <#> I was confident. <#> I was sure. <#> That was always a bad sign. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Do you often sleep with someone when you intend to marry someone else?' </quote> </p><p> <#> My mouth was still moving with those last couple of words when I knew how badly I 'd blown it. <#> Her cheeks flushed and she sat straighter. <#> She pulled her coat tighter around her and pushed her coffee cup away from her. <#> She looked like she was going to go. </p><p> <#> And then for the first time I experienced lust-free lust. <#> I wanted someone 's flesh pressed to mine in a way that was almost completely without desire. <#> But she walked out. <#> She just stood up, shook her head, mumbled something I couldn't hear and walked away. <#> My head fell upon the table. <#> It made a hollow noise. </p><p> <#> I left soon after. <#> Though it was not late, the streets hummed with discontent and wintry malice. <#> There were lots of cops around. <#> I even thought I could see Mary talking to one of them but I couldn't be sure. <#> I hoped that if it was her then it wasn't her boyfriend she was talking to. </p><p> <#> It was near chuck-out time for the bars and there 'd been a couple of big bomb scares in the city centre. <#> The siren sounds wafted in the wind and down Arthur Street I could see some desultory scurrying and white tape stretching. <#> The cops were always jumpier if there was a series of bomb hoaxes. <#> I think they preferred real bombs to endless hoaxes. <#> It was like Russian roulette and I don't think they liked waiting for the one that would be real. <#> It had been a pretty busy day for the boys with bombs. <#> One at lunchtime in a multi-storey car park. <#> A mortar had been fired at some soldiers and there had been the one Chuckie and I had heard earlier. <#> And then all the hoaxes. </p><p> <#> But I looked at the people on the streets, I couldn't help thinking that it was still no big deal. <#> It used to be different. <#> We all used to be much more scared. <#> After the biggest blasts in the seventies (recently revived for a second successful season), the colour of the streets always seemed drained and muted as if the colours, too, had been blown away. </p><p> <#> But now it was all just an inconvenience, all just a traffic jam. <#> I found the Wreck in a side-street. <#> A couple of cops and soldiers were loitering there. <#> I got in and tried, ineffectually, to start it up. <#> Just as it was beginning to chug into some semblance of life, a soldier sauntered over, his rifle slung across his pelvis in a carefree fashion. </p><p> <#> I wound down my window and put on my I-don't-mind-being-questioned-by-the-security-forces-I-know-you-have-to-do-it face. <#> It was a pretty complicated expression. </p><p> <#> The young soldier leaned down to my open window. <#> His face was adolescent and his accent was Lancashire prole. <quote> <#> 'This your car?' </quote> <#> The inevitable start to the litany of enquiry. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Yes.' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'This your only car?' </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Yes.' </quote> <#> My voice was untesty. <#> It might have been a tense day for these guys with all the ordnance going round town. <#> I reached for the glove compartment to get some papers to prove that the Wreck was indeed mine. </p><p> <#> The soldier snorted briefly. <#> 'No, no, that 's all right, mate. <#> It 's just we thought you were driving it for a bet.' </quote> </p><p> <#> I didn't need to laugh since he laughed so hard he laughed for both of us. <#> I could hear his colleagues pissing themselves across the street. <#> The soldier bent double and squeezed some feeble words of apology between the whinnies of his laughter. <#> The Wreck, showing rare form, started amidst all the mockery and I drove off. </p><p> <#> A couple of hours later, I was at home, making chase with my cat. <#> He 'd peed in the bath again and the sight of that little yellow pool around my plughole had sent me spare. <#> It was so yellow. <#> Somehow, you didn't expect it to be yellow. <#> Like it was almost human. <#> Unlike the cat itself. <#> I 'd chased him down the stairs, under the chairs, over the tables and so on. <#> He was fucking quick, my cat. </p><p> <#> I suppose that being pissed at my cat just because I was already blue wasn't fair. <#> Mary, Sarah, my job: none of it was his fault. <#> But he was unlucky enough to come near the end of a story he wasn't really part of. <#> So, I ran after him with murder in my heart. </p><p> <#> I 'd got home depressed. <#> Mary had left me making no mistake. <#> When I got back there were a couple of messages. <#> I had nearly wept at all this human contact, even though one had been from Marty Allen, telling me what an asshole I was - as if I didn't know already. <#> Chuckie had called too. <#> He sounded jugged again. <#> Apparently, he 'd just had a big date with his American girl. <#> She 'd agreed to go out with him again. <#> But apparently she wanted a double date with her flatmate. <#> That was where I came in. <#> Chuckie had happily volunteered me to field the friend. <#> Next Thursday, the message said. </p><p> <#> I would think about that later. <#> But for now the important thing was to catch my cat and kill him. <#> I 'd nearly cornered him between a bookshelf and a sofa when my doorbell rang loudly. <#> I froze. <#> I thought the Pet Protection League were on my case. <#> I looked at the big clock on my wall. <#> It was after midnight. <#> Belfast isn't the best town for those after-midnight social calls and, as I walked to my front door, I had the familiar fifteen-second feeling that there were two men in bomber jackets and balaclavas with Browning automatics standing at my door with some sincere political objectives. <#> I shucked through it, as I always did, and opened up. </p><p> <#> A policeman stood there, his hand raised to the bellpush. <#> I sighed with a mixture of guilt and relief. <#> I spent most of my life thinking that I should be arrested so cops made me uneasy. <#> I wondered if I was going to get grief for hitting Crab. <#> A complaint to the cops wasn't his style, but Marty Allen might have done it just for fun. </p><p> <quote> <#> 'Yes?' </quote> I asked. </p><p> <#> The cop narrowed his eyes and asked me in a shaky voice, which surprised me, whether my name was my name. <#> What now? I thought, as I answered that, yes, my name was indeed my name. </p> <p> <#> The bang on my chops seemed to happen all by itself. <#> I 'd seen no arm, no hand. <#> The blow knocked me back against my open door and he followed up with the other glove across my mouth. </p><p> <#> Imagine my surprise! </p><p> <#> He 'd come in on me now and swung me round onto the staircase and I felt the stairs bang into my spine. <#> After he 'd cracked me in the balls and headbutted me a couple of times, I began to understand I was in a fight there. <#> I was upset, naturally, and it was beginning to hurt as well. <#> I was wondering what to do when he started giving me some elbow to the side of the head. </p><p> <#> In my experience, sudden fights had always been like this. <#> When somebody really surprised you, it was really surprising. <#> In the movies, tough guys always handled surprise fights with lightning reflexes, immediate escalation. <#> Us real-life tough guys needed time to get used to the idea, we needed written invitations, consultations, legal advice. </p><p> <#> I was getting messed up rapidly by the time I 'd summoned the verve to consider a response but by that time the cop himself was puffed out. <#> He stepped back to catch a breath. <#> Then I realized that something was missing. <#> Where were his colleagues? <#> How come the others were missing all this fun? </p></I>
