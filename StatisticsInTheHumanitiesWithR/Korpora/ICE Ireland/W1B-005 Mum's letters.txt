<W1B-005 Mum's letters><I><W1B-005$A><h> <#> Midnight 22.9.94 </h><p> <#> Dearest Ciara <#> I just wanted to continue the conversation we were having on the phone about an hour ago - so I thought I 'd write you a little note before I go to bed. </p><p> <#> I 'm so glad that things seem to be going well for you and that your accommodation is comfortable. </p><p> <#> You must write and tell me all about the people in your house so that I can have a mental picture of them. </p><p> <#> I haven't much 'news' for you. <#> Sally rang on Saturday last to heard how you 'd got on and how the journey went. <#> She was really concerned about you. <#> Carla also called for your address. <#> The were both in Dublin for the 'All Ireland' weekend and stayed in Bob Atterberry 's new house. <#> They said they had a really good time. </p><p> <#> Tonight I enrolled at Jordanstown to do the course I applied for i.e. Post. Grad. Cert. In Educ. Management. <#> I don't know if I 'm mad - but I fell I should try it at least. <#> It involves me going every Tues. - 4.15-8.15 p.m. so I won't be home until around 9 p.m. starting 4th Oct. </p><p> <#> I 'm really looking forward to seeing Sarah-Jane again - the house is so quiet with both of you gone! </p><p> <#> I think Jacinta misses the two of you being here - she has been in bed at 10 o'clock the last two nights! </p><p> <#> Ciara - don't worry about having to cook for your house-mates. <#> Just follow the recipe and keep it simple - nothing elaborate to begin with. <#> Don't let anything worry or annoy you during this year. <#> Grab every opportunity that comes your way - and make lots of new friends. <#> Make it a year to remember! </p><p> <#> I will try to get the phone-card fixed up soon - but I think it takes a while, so it could be a few weeks. </p><p> <#> In the meantime - don't worry about phoning all the time. <#> Once a week is plenty - say perhaps around teatime on Sat. or Sun. - unless of course you need something or want to talk to me about something in particular. <#> You can't afford to be wasting a lot of money on phone-calls. </p><p> <#> Don't forget to feed yourself well and manage your bank account wisely. <#> Don't try to economise on things you need. <#> Plan your food so that you eat a balanced diet - and buy whatever books are necessary for your studies. </p><p> <#> When you come home at Christmas, I 'll get you a rucksack so that the same problems don't arise when you 're travelling again as did last Friday. <#> It must have been awful for you. <#> Just as well I didn't know until after the event!! </p><p> <#> Well that 's about it for tonight. <#> It 's now 1 A.M. and I 'm going to bed. <#> Daddy and Phil send their love. </p><p> <#> Write to me sometime and fill me in on all the details. <#> Look after yourself and stay happy! </p><p> <#> Goodnight <*> ampersand </*> God bless - All my love <#> Mummy xxx <#> P.T.O. </p><p> <#> P.S. Glad to hear you 'll get a tinkle on the old ivories. <#> Wasn't it a coincidence that somebody with a keyboard is sharing your house? <#> Don't forget to say your prayers every night - Mum xxx </p></I><I><W1B-005$A><h> <#> "Home Sweet Home" <#> 11.10.94 </h><p> <#> Dear Ciara, <#> It is now 12.45 A.M. - and as usual I 'm doing the jobs which I should have done earlier in the evening - except that this time I have an excuse! - i.e. Ronan McAlpine called and we were having a chat and a little drink. <#> Then J.P. came in around 10 p.m. - having had her dinner cooked for her by Fred Keane and I heard the events of yesterday., i.e. Ted and she have parted company - but I 'll leave the details of that for her to relate. <#> Suffice to say that she is feeling sad tonight - but she 's a survivor and in time she 'll be joyful again. </p><p> <#> I have just completed the 2nd week of my P.G. course in Educ. Management. <#> It's v. boring, not at all what I expected - all group discussion which can be boring for 4 hours after teaching all day. <#> However I 've committed myself to it and must continue. </p><p> <#> I don't get home until 9 p.m. on Tues. evening and have 2 assignments via "Action Research" to do for Christmas. <#> An integral part of 'Action Research' is keeping a diary/journal - it must be in a way like the one you kept last year. <#> The idea is to identify a management issue, analyse and improve it by introspectively looking at your actions regarding this issue. <#> Hence the need for a diary. <#> I 've a very good article about keeping a research diary which might have been of use to you - and still might be for future study. </p><p> <#> Jacinta 's parents ' night was last Monday - and I was very happy with what I heard. <#> Everyone had v. good things to say about her. <#> She seems to be working - but Ger was not happy with her scales last night!!! </p><p> <#> J-P was playing with Bill Harrington and Janet Ramsay on Sat. night. <#> Bill rang and <}> <-> ask </-> <+> asked </+> </}> her to play with them, for which she got <*> pound sign </*> 60! <#> Ashley Fisher also rang for her tonight - but she wasn't in. <#> She doesn't seem very keen though. </p><p> <#> Life is pretty busy as usual - but nothing very rivetting to report. <#> A. Gilly is in Lourdes this week, so I hope she has a really good time. <#> Jacinta is going in for Sunday practices for "My Fair Lady". <#> She 's in the 'Ascot Chorus' and was also picked for the 'Embassy Ball' - so that means she gets two gowns!! </p><p> <#> I think she 's enjoying it all very much. <#> Last week I gave in to letting her go to a preformal - but unfortunately for her, it was cancelled. <#> Adam has never phoned her since the letter - but maybe that 's just as well from her point of view. </p><p> <#> Your letter (which by the way I received this morning) sounded v. bright and cheerful, which made me very happy. <#> I 'm so glad that things are going so well for you Ciara. <#> Louvain seems like an excellent choice for a student. <#> Keep up the cooking and maybe you 'll even cook our Christmas dinner this year!! <#> I think Louvain will teach you more than just French during this year. </p><p> <#> Keep up your violin playing and I 'm so delighted you joined the orchestra. <#> All of that will open pathways to new friendships. </p><p> <#> Daddy sends his love and hopes the French is improving. <#> I 'm tired now Ciara - so I 'll call it a day. <#> Goodnight and God bless. <#> Love always - Mum xxxx </p><p> <#> P.S. Glad to hear you visited Bruges last week. </p><p> <#> P.P.S. Maybe you 'll drop Lucille a little letter sometime - she 'd love that. </p></I><I><W1B-005$A><p> <#> Dear Ciara, <#> As usual - it 's 1 A.M. and I 'm thinking of you. <#> I hope that you 're tucked up in your bed and fast asleep. <#> I 've just been at my course - and as usual am asking myself why I ever bothered to do this. </p><p> <#> There 's a lot of work ahead of me - and I really have no inclination to do it. </p><p> <#> Sarah-Jane was at lunch today with Sammy - but no doubt she 'll fill you in on all the details, so I 'll leave that to her. <#> Jacinta is working hard at the minute, what with increased homework and practices for 'My Fair Lady' in which she is taking part in the 'Cockney Chorus', 'The Embassy Ball' and - I forget the other one. </p><p> <#> Ger is pushing her to learn her Grade 7 scales. <#> The exam will be in a few weeks - and I 'm afraid her scales are not up to the mark. </p><p> <#> The clocks went back as you know on Sat. night - so winter has really set in. <#> The nights are long and it 's getting quite cold. </p><p> <#> Aunt Gilly had a great time in Lourdes. <#> Weather/hotel and everything was beautiful. <#> I 'm very glad for her that she enjoyed her little 'break.' - (I 've just remembered the other chorus that Jacinta 's in - 'The Ascot Chorus') </p><h> <#> P.T.O. </h><p> <#> Ciara - this is a very impromptu letter - more or less just to tell you we 're all thinking of you and missing you - so forgive the lack of continuity in it. <#> I don't really have any news for you that I haven't already told you on the phone, except that Miss McInerney announced last week that she 's retiring at Christmas - so that means a new principal. <#> I don't really relish the thought of yet another new person at the top - but I suppose I 'll have to grin and bear it! - New people in key positions inevitably bring about change - and at the minute it 's the last thing I want. </p><p> <#> This weekend we 're off (so is Daddy and Phil) Monday and Tuesday for Hallowe'en, so I 'm looking forward to the break. <#> It won't be long until Christmas and you 'll be home. <#> I 'm looking forward to that! <#> Daddy, myself and the McDermots are going to the Dowling 's on Sat. night. </p><p> <#> I 'm going to wind up now Ciara - as I have the lunches still to make. <#> Belfast is a very peaceful place at the moment, thank God - there are going to be less soldiers and the streets and police are taking off their flack-jackets - so things appear optimistic at last. </p><p> <#> Lots of Love always <#> Mum <*> ampersand </*> Dad <*> ampersand </*> Phil <*> ampersand </*> J-P. </p></I><I><W1B-005$A><h> <#> Your home <#> 11 pm <#> 23.11.94 </h><p> <#> Dear Ciara, <#> Having received your 'humourous' card this morning - I thought I 'd better write and keep you up to date with all the goings on. <#> The Southern/Reynolds situation would need some space to explain - so I 'll leave it to your more politically minded friends to do so in a more succinct manner than I possibly could. </p><p> <#> <&French> &\A ce moment </&French> , dad is in the sitting-room watching a match, Jacinta is upstairs playing her violin (practising for the Grade 7 which is on Dec. 6th ) and I am about to go out for a walk with Maude. <#> So I 'll continue this epistle on my return, as she has just arrived (alongside Jonathan). <#> That put an end to J-P 's study-night. </p><p> <#> I 've just returned from a walk during which I 've observed and felt the first frost of winter. <#> The weather has been <ul> very </ul> mild of late. <#> Jacinta has just spent half of the night on the 'phone - a boy who partnered her in the 'Embassy Ball' scene phoned her, since he hasn't and I quote <quote> 'seen much of her or talked to her since the performance!' - which by the way was marvellous. </quote> </p><p> <#> Adam came over on Sat. night to <quote> 'return a book' </quote> which Lucille borrowed from us. <#> So, the admirers are still all there. <#> Joe is another one from St. Mals. who phones in the hope she 'll go to the cinema with him - but that of course is out of the question for some time to come!!! </p><p> <#> J-P - despite her moaning to you is having a ball. <#> Last night she was at a 'Law do' in the Regency and went partying afterwards - (a bit like yourself at the moment from what I 'm hearing!) <#> So don't believe all this deep depression over Ted. <#> I think she 's fairly well over him now - At least I hope so! </p><p> <#> For my part - I 'm continuing my course - Goodness knows why, as I think my studying days are over. <#> However last week, I had a bit of work to hand up - and I was the star, as I was asked to read mine out the following week! <#> I was quite chuffed about that. <#> I don't get home on Tues. until 9 p.m. - so it 's a long day. </p><p> <#> Well the big news is, St Teresa 's Boys ' and Girls ' are amalgamating, next Sept. <#> Miss McInerney is retiring in June and Mr. Mason will be the principal of the amalgamated school. </p><p> <#> I think that 's all the news Ciara. <#> Please send Uncle Ciaran/Ronan and Oisin a card if you haven't done so - or another one if it 's sometime since you have. <#> Fr. Martin might appreciate one too, but I'm not sure of his address. </p><p> <#> Rachel was here on Sunday two weeks ago for her dinner. <#> She 's in good form. <#> I haven't seen much of the others recently - but I suppose everybody is working hard these days. <#> Joseph Cashman has agreed to take J.P. as an apprentice and she is going to accept that. </p><p> <#> Yes, Amy is still playing the organ - but reluctantly. <#> However, the new church is opening on 18th Dec. - after which there 'll be no more Sun night masses - so she 'll only have to do it for three more weeks. </p><p> <#> It 's now 1.50 A.M. Ciara - so I 'm going to retire now. <#> Can't wait until I see you again as we miss you a lot. <#> Still it won't be long now. <#> Dad sends his love. <#> Mum xxxx </p></I>
