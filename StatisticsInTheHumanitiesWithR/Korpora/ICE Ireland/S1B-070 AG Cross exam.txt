<ICE-IRE:S1B-070 AG Cross exam><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> Uhm <,> no I I I was anxious to to discover how uh that uh conclusion was reached that this was the first case and with respect I don't think you 've answered it <#> Maybe it 's a more appropriate one to put it to the official concerned <#> Was it simply by by his uh uh memory <#> I mean <,> <{> <[> can I </[> can I just say <,> on your views on Mr Fitzsimons and I think this is relevant <,> uh uh regarding the running of your office <,> uh an office which you say you were you were in and I accept what you say <,> from eight a-m onwards every day but uh Mr Fitzsimons found that the procedures for the processing of extradition cases were seriously defective <,> that there was no way of checking similarity of details <,> no indexing system which would immediately provide a summary of the file or the nature of the issues covered by it <#> I mean were you at any stage informed that there were difficulties when putting a serious question about a case which was to be brought to the government <.> t </.> for answer in the Da/il <,> that an official because of all of these difficulties and because of the uh Dickensian state of the <.> of </.> of the filing system at least in the office uh that <,> the official simply wouldn't be in a position <#> Uh given your own argument that you couldn't recollect the case because of workload and so on <,> so how could this official be <.> ex </.> expected to state categorically <,> facts <,> supposedly facts about a case which you then accepted as facts without question<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> <[> Oh yeah <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> Well I mean the the official would have to answer uh just how he went about getting together the information that enabled him to make that statement which turned out to be inaccurate <#> He will he will answer that for you I 'm sure <#> Uh I I don't know how but he he 'll answer the question and that 's a matter for him <#> I think that 's <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> <[> But what 's </[> </{> your own understanding of the workings of your office and how decisions were taken <{> <[> how conclusions were reached </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> <[> Well there 's I 've <,> I 've no </[> </{> difficulty about how decisions were taken <#> I do take your point that that that the the facilities in the office for retrieving information uh by electronic means and by the use of computers and databases <,> that <,> that system is not there <#> That infrastructure is not in the office and uh and and that does <.> un </.> undoubtedly hamper a search such as that which was carried out by Mr Russell at my request<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> But did did you never uh see that as a difficulty up to this <#> You you you were three years in the office<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> Yes <#> I 'd never had a difficulty <,> I 'd I 'd never uh had that difficulty or that lack of <,> the absence of such a retrievable system had never turned up a difficulty for me before <#> Uhm uh and I <,> uh that 's all I can say uh <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> Can I ask a final question<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$C> <#> One final question yes <unclear> 1 syll </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> Can I go on Mr Whelehan to uhm the uh <,> you 've emphasised this morning that uh you you felt you had a majority of government supporting you <#> Uh you don't seem uh <,> to attach any importance to the fact that you were uh dealing with a partnership government <#> And <.> i </.> it seems to me that uhm <,> and I 'm trying to be objective as an independent I 've no axe to grind with anybody here <,> but it seems to me that the entire country was aware of the disquiet of the Labour section <,> the Labour partner in government about your uh proposed uh acceptance of of of the office <,> even to the extent that they they left government <,> they walked <.> ou </.> they walked out of the Cabinet meeting <#> Why in those circumstances <,> in that <.> con </.> <,> and that was a fairly long-running uh context <,> <.> w </.> why did you persist and press ahead <,> knowing that the stability of the country and the <.> sta </.> <,> the stability of the <.> go </.> <.> o </.> of the Government <,> was involved <,> was at stake <#> Why did you press ahead with uh your uh seeking of this office<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> Uh I I I <,> in a sense sought the office <,> I made myself available for the office and the Taoiseach indicated that he favoured the appointment and the position was that the majority of the Government favoured the appointment <{1> <[1> No <.> mem </.> </[1><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> <[1> Do you mean sorry can I </[1> </{1> <,> I don't wish to interrupt Chairman <#> But when <,> you you 've <.> sai </.> used this term on a number of occasions <#> When you 're talking about uh a majority of the government are you talking about the Fianna Fa/il ministers<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> One partner <{1> <[1> in a </[1> partnership government<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> <[1> No but <[/1> </{1> well <.> n </.> I wanted <,> I 'm talking about that <,> but I 'm talking about the fact that no other minister in the Government <,> that I can identify expressed to me any reservation or any suggestion that I would not be a satisfactory person to be appointed to that position <#> Not one <#> Ever <#> So I <,> the only <,> the only influence that could have come to bear on me to declare that I was no longer interested would be newspaper reports attributed to the Ta/naiste uh and <.> o </.> some other members of the Labour party <#> But not once uh sir did anybody suggest to me that I was unsuitable for high office <,> judicial office <#> And it was said in some of these reports that I was a very good Attorney General and they hoped I 'd stay on as Attorney General <,> they 'd full confidence in me as Attorney General <#> But for some reason I was unsuitable uh or there were reservations about my suitability for this office <#> Now if such reservations existed I would think sir that it would be fair uh from any of the people who had reservations to come to me because on a personal level <,> I had the best of relations with them <#> And I believe still <,> still would have the best of relations with them <#> And I cannot understand to this day why none of them <,> whoever they were <,> came to me <,> the Ta/naiste or anybody else and looked me in the eye and said <,> look <,> we have a difficulty with you for the following reasons <#> You <.> pro </.> <,> uh they could explain to me what the difficulty was <,> I would then of course consider it <#> But uh a vague <,> campaign if you like or a vague uh repetition of reservations in the press I found absolutely uh abhorrent and it was something to which I would not respond<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> But <,> uh while I accept your understanding that the uh <,> or your <.> i </.> inability to understand these reservations <,> surely it was clear to you that there was a serious difference between the two partners in government <,> that one partner wanted you <#> You were in effect the political candidate for Fianna Fa/il in that sense <#> The other partner in government <,> the Labour ministers did not want you <#> Regardless of what the reservations were <,> it was clear to the entire country that they did not want you as President of the High Court and yet you persisted <,> regardless<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$C> <#> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> can we Mr Whelehan just before you respond <,> I want to point out <,> this question has been asked on a number of occasions <#> It 's repetitive and I don't want it to go any further now so this is the last response and I then uh that 's <.> cl </.> concluding Deputy Gregory 's questions <#> Your last response now and a brief response<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> if I got an answer to it<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$C> <#> Well the question has been asked on a number of occasions and I did ask at the beginning <,> I did not want repetition in relation to the questions <#> A brief reply now Mr Whelehan<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> If I was acceptable as Attorney General uh and <,> to the to the government <,> uh I think that prima facie <,> holding that position I must be acceptable for appointment to high judicial office <#> And I think it 'd be a very sad day for this country if there 's an Attorney General appointed to advise the government who does not have suitability to be appointed a Judge of the High Court<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$A> <#> When did you acquire <{> <[> <.> ce </.> acceptable <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$C> <#> <[> And that concludes Deputy Gregory 's </[> </{> questions now <#> Sorry <#> I now call on Deputy Willie O'Dea Fianna Fa/il to put his questions to Mr Whelehan<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> Thank-you Mr Chairman <#> First of all I want to thank you for your attendance here today <#> Uhm when did the Smyth case first come to your attention <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> I 'm almost certain that the first time I became aware of the Smyth case was in a report in <,> the Sunday Independent of it would have been <,> if my days and dates are correct <,> the Sunday before the twenty-fifth of October <#> That 'd be Sunday the twenty-third of October uh and there was a large expose/-type front page uhm article on the subject under the by-line of <,> a journalist <,> whose name was <,> I think <,> Veronica Guerin<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> Right <#> There was no way you could have known about the Smyth case prior to that<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> Because because the file was in the exclusive possession of Mr Russell<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> Correct<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> Uhm so therefore uh can I take it as logically following from that that nobody else <,> for example no member of the Government could have known about it<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> No<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> Yeah <#> So therefore certain reports that appeared in certain sections of the media to the effect that the reason for the seven-month delay was that Fianna Fa/il ministers were trying to shelter a paedophile <#> Those reports <,> you 'd accept that those reports must be completely without foundation<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> You state uhm you 've stated in the preamble to your evidence today that you weren't greatly surprised that the Taoiseach didn't mention the Duggan case in his Tuesday speech <#> Why was that<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> That was because I had given a very clear account to Mr Fitzsimons spontaneously when he when he reminded me of the Duggan case <,> A <,> that the Duggan case was very much in ease of the allegations <#> I 'm sorry Mr Chairman I 'm repeating this answer but it 's <,> <.> i </.> in a sense the question is a repeat of a question I 've been asked <#> The the emergence of the Duggan file gave the lie to the idea that there would be protection afforded to somebody because they were a Catholic clergyman in the office <,> and secondly <,> that the Duggan case did not require uh anything like an in-depth study of the extent or possible application of section fifty uh <,> of the Extradition Act nineteen eighty-seven <#> The the the Duggan case was a case where <,> as I think Mr Fitzsimons himself put it <,> had a perfunctory or casual or trivial or passing uh reference to the section <,> it did not involve a detailed consideration of the section<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> Uhm <,> you are aware that there was difference of opinion <,> quite strong difference of opinion between Mr Russell in your office and the new Attorney General <,> <.> mis </.> Mr Fitzsimons on the exact relevance of the Duggan case <#> Are you aware of that<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> I wasn't aware of that until these <{> <[> proceedings </[> <#> But I mean I 'm I 'm I 'm taken by the fact that when I heard that <.> i </.> <.> i </.> it 's <,> it 's <,> I don't know what significance it will have for the Committee but it seems to me that I in my own home on the Monday was taking very much the same view of the Duggan case as Mr Russell is supposed to have taken when he was talking with Mr Fitzsimons <#> Uh and I gave that view uh uh without ever having had contact with Mr Russell about the Duggan case or the <.> S </.> or the Smyth case since I left the office <#> Uh we both apparently on the same day on the Monday <,> in different locations <,> when told about the Duggan case by Mr Fitzsimons <,> came to broadly similar views as to its relevance<ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$D> <#> So therefore there was a difference of opinion <,> a fairly fundamental difference of opinion about the relevance of the Duggan case between Mr Fitzsimons on the one side and yourself and Mr Russell uh on the other side <#> That would be a fair <,> a fair estimation <{1> <[1> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[1><ICE-IRE:S1B-070$B> <#> <[1> Yes and when </[1> </{1> I gave to Mr Fitzsimons my interpretation of the Duggan case and its its lack of relevance in the context of the Smyth case <,> he didn't uh <,> he didn't argue a different point of view with me <#> And he took on board the two points which I made and he agreed that he would convey to the Taoiseach as I asked him to do <,> my attitude to the Duggan case <,> and I gave him a letter uh the following morning recounting what I had said to him <,> uh just for the record and I 'm very pleased that I did <#> And that 's the letter which I read to you gentlemen uh this morning when the Committee first sat</I>
