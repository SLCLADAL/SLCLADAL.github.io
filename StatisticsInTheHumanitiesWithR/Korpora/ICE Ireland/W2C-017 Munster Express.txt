<W2C-017 Munster Express><I><W2C-017$A><h> <bold> <#> MUCH RESENTMENT TO DRINK DRIVING LAWS </h> </bold><p> <bold> <#> The new drink driving laws have been received with anger and resentment by most members of the public and licensed vintners to such an extent that, if there was an election in the near future, the matter would almost certainly be a major issue. </p> </bold><p> <#> Every person the "Munster Express" spoke to on the subject this week was at pains to suggest that they did not condone drunk driving in any way. <#> But they felt the new laws were unsocial and draconian and an attack on ordinary law abiding citizens at a time when muggers, vandals and burglars were terrorising the community. </p><p> <#> It also emerged that there was no animosity towards rank and file members of the Garda Siochana who are seen as people merely doing their job. <#> But there was much bitterness against the politicians who introduced the legislation and the fact that so many officers have been diverted to check-point duties. </p><p> <#> In a separate development, which could have a bearing on the controversy, the Garda Representative Association expressed <quote> "serious concern" </quote> this week at the decision of the Commissioner to introduce a new staff appraisal system for gardai. </p><p> <quote> <#> "What will happen is that individual gardai may well be tempted to opt for the soft target, like motorists, rather than concentrating on longer term crime detection", </quote> said the Association 's Waterford based deputy general secretary, Mr. P.J.Stone. </p><p> <#> The mood of the people was also evident on RTE 's "Questions and Answers" on Monday night when, in a show of hands, the vast majority of the audience showed their opposition to the new laws. <#> A return to the status quo and a scale of fines and punishments, depending on the concentration of alcohol involved, were the options most favoured. </p><p> <#> A suggestion by Ms. Avril Doyle, T.D., of Fine Gael that Ireland adopt the French system of dealing with drunk drivers has also been finding much support in recent days. <#> In France, the punishment matches the concentration and the consequences of a ban on the defendant 's spouse and children is also taken into consideration. </p><h> <bold> <#> DROP IN BUSINESS </h> </bold><p> <#> The new laws have very definitely taken their toll on the business of some pubs, especially in rural areas where there is no public transport or taxi service. <#> A sales representative with a major drinks supplier told the "Munster Express" orders were down this week in some areas. <#> He cited one small rural pub which had two customers on Saturday night compared to the usual forty. </p><h> <bold> <#> PUBLICANS SPEAK THEIR MINDS </bold> </h><p> <#> The following are the views of just some publicans we spoke to during the week. <#> All stressed that they did not condone drunk driving and their customers were abiding by the new laws. </p><h> <bold> <#> Michael O'Gorman, The Rhu Glenn </h> </bold><p> <#> <quote> "All our customers are very upset. <#> Usually one would find that a person taking two drinks would be the driver of a party of three or four but now that is all stopped. <#> We have supplied a mini bus and are driving people home to Waterford, New Ross and areas in between. <#> There seems to be a lot of resentment among the public at the new situation". </quote> </p><h> <bold> <#> Robbie Walsh, Fox 's Den </bold> </h><p> <#> <quote> "Many of our customers are men who would drink two or three pints and then drive home along the back roads. <#> These people are steady as rocks and no danger to anybody but now they are so scared they don 't even want to take one drink. <#> They come in and have a mineral but are miserable with it." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "The social fabric of society is being destroyed and, when the summer comes, it will <}> <-> serious </-> <+> seriously </+> </}> affect tourism because the Irish pub will soon be a thing of the past". </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "People are angry and feel the efforts of the gardai are being deployed in the wrong direction. <#> I hope the resentment does not materialise against individual gardai as that would be a shame. <#> But there is a real danger that many decent people will begin to view the gardai as the enemy instead of a friend as it should be." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Walsh has introduced a pub based hackney service and hopes that will assist his customers in their dilemma. </p><h> <bold> <#> Jim Harney, Dunhill </h> </bold><p> <quote> <#> "Most of my customers have described the situation as a downright disgrace. <#> They are very moderate drinkers who enjoy a social night out which is now being made very difficult for them to continue with." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "There is almost the same punishment for a man with just half a pint over the limit as there is for a real drunk driver. <#> People are even afraid to drink at home because they have to be on the road the next morning". </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "I am running this pub since 1947 and we never had an accident involving people leaving this premises. <#> Last night, one of my customers went home three miles down a dark road on a bicycle. <#> He was in more danger from a fast, sober driver than from a moderate drinker who drives carefully". </quote> </p><h> <bold> <#> Seamus and Renee Comerford, Mooncoin. </bold> </h><p> <quote> <#> "Last weekend was very busy but there were only three cars in the car park and two were owned by staff. <#> We have been driving customers home ourselves while others are using a taxi. <#> Many couples are taking it in turns to stay on the dry". </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "In general, the reaction of customers to the new laws has been very negative as most feel the situation is unfair. <#> There is a drop off in custom from people who were in the habit of dropping in for a drink or two before going home from work in the evenings". </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "Decent people will always comply with the law but many people are telling us they feel hard done by by the new regulations". </quote> </p><h> <bold> <#> Michael Baroon, Glenmore </bold> </h><p> <#> <quote> "The situation should have been left as it was as there was no trouble being caused by decent, respectable people driving home after a social night out with just a couple of drinks taken." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "We have many people who drop in late at night and rarely have more than two drinks. <#> This pub is a meeting place and they come for the chat more than anything else and now they are frightened even to do that." </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> "We have organised a taxi to be in the area and we will accommodate customers ourselves if possible but there is a great opposition among the people to the new laws". </quote> </p><h> <bold> <#> Paul Cusack, Power 's Seaview Hotel. </bold> </h><p> <#> <quote> "Because Tramore is an urban area we have a lot of customers who do not need to drive. <#> But all of Tramore is going to suffer once the summer comes because the Sunday afternoon driver who likes to come out for a walk on the beach and have a drink or two before going home will be a thing of the past." </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> "Most of our customers think the new situation unfair, especially in the blanket way the ban is applied. <#> They feel there should be a difference between the person socially sober but barely over. <#> They are very different to a person with a lot of drink on board as nobody could condone such behaviour". </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-017$B><h> <bold> <#> HISTORIC BUILDING VANDALISED </h> </bold><p> <bold> <#> The former Walsh Asylum, now renamed Walsh House, dates back to the 1860 's and only the quick thinking of a responsible citizen saved all its records and ledgers from almost certainly being destroyed. </bold> </p><p> <#> Doors, windows and other fittings were smashed and, in the oratory, a Communion table was hacked to pieces and religious vestments trampled underfoot. <#> To the great relief of the trustees who administer the business of the charity, a beautiful stained glass window in the oratory escaped the attention of the vandals. </p><h> <bold> <#> PRESERVED </h> </bold><p> <#> The building is preserved under the Corporation 's city plan but some time ago it became clear that the years had taken their toll and part of the complex, which comprises five terraced houses, was condemned. <#> The trustees then embarked on a major scheme which would protect the building and provide eighteen modern apartments for elderly people. </p><p> <#> The architect for the project is Mr. Ronnie Falconer of C.J. Falconer and Associates and he told the "Munster Express" he was appalled at the damage cause by the intruders. <#> He said it had taken some time for the trustees to bring the plan to fruition but the Department of the Environment had now approved grant aid and a contract had been agreed with a builder. </p><p> <#> The concerned citizen who discovered the damage told our reporter he was absolutely shocked at what he saw. </p><h> <bold> <#> A Shambles </bold> </h><p> <quote> <#> "I was passing the building and noticed that the side door was open so I went in to investigate", </quote> he said. <#> Continuing, he declared: <quote> "What I saw was unbelievable as the whole inside of the building was a shambles. <#> It was utter destruction". </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "The place was also full of cider bottles and human excrement and, when I went upstairs to the oratory, I found the communion table hacked to pieces and priests ' vestments trampled underfoot near more human excrement". </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "In another room I found books, papers and ledgers scattered around the floor and I discovered that they were the actual records of the institution. <#> I collected them all and brought them down to Waterford Corporation where officials took them into safe keeping for the owners", </quote> said the man. </p><p> <#> The building has, once again, been secured and Gardai are investigating the matter. </p></I><I><W2C-017$C><h> <bold> <#> ALARMING CHILD SEX ABUSE FIGURES </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> The Community Child Centre at Waterford Regional Hospital dealt last year with 70 confirmed victims of child sex abuse and another 35 unconfirmed high risk cases. </bold> </p><p> <#> The Centre, which serves the south east region with its 129,000 children, had 176 referrals <quote> "for further treatment and investigation" </quote> and in 40 p.c. of cases abuse was confirmed. </p><p> <#> The unconfirmed high risk cases (20 p.c.) were children who were thought likely to have been victims but where the child 's story was perhaps inconsistent or unclear in some respects. </p><p> <#> A further 20 p.c. were classified as <quote> "unconfirmed low risk" </quote> - they did not make a definite disclosure of abuse. </p><p> <#> The remaining 20 p.c. failed to complete their assessment at the Child Centre and they, according to Clinical Psychologist Dr. Mairi Keenleyside, who provided the statistics, may be particularly vulnerable. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It may be that the families who fail to complete assessment have more problems but end up receiving less services", </quote> stated Dr. Keenleyside, who is with Waterford Community Care. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Dysfunctional families may find the assessment procedures particularly stressful and may end up receiving less services because they have opted out of the prescribed assessment procedure". </quote> </p><p> <#> When a child is being assessed at the Child Centre the gardai are involved and that may lead to legal procedures against the abuser. <#> Children may be required to give evidence in court against an alleged perpetrator and many studies have shown that waiting for and taking part in court procedures is very stressful. <#> That could lead to an exacerbation of emotional and behavioural problems, Dr. Keenleyside points out. </p><h> <bold> <#> KILKENNY CASE </bold> </h><p> <#> She said that in the U.S., other legal system designed to reduce child distress and to get the alleged abuser to comply with treatment, had been examined. <#> It was suggested as a consequence that at least for intrafamilial first time offenders, a system whereby the alleged abuser was offered treatment prior to legal intervention was the most promising way forward. </p><p> <#> She said that data published in the Kilkenny incest case report and taken from a study in the Eastern Health Board area in 1988 showed that of 990 cases of child sexual abuse reported to the board, 507 were referred by the gardai to the Director of Public Prosecutions. <#> That resulted in 38 cases where the defendant was found guilty. </p><p> <#> In other words, there were convictions only in respect of 4 p.c. of the original allegations. </p><h> <bold> <#> TRAINING NEEDS </bold> </h><p> <#> In highlighting some of the problems with the present system for processing cases of child sex abuse, Dr. Keenleyside said the training needs of professionals in contact with children required to be carefully addressed. </p><p> <#> In particular, professionals needed to be more informed about abusers and to be aware of the protocol within their own agency for dealing with child sex abuse cases. <#> They also needed further training in the practicabilities of dealing with children who made disclosures of abuse. </p><h> <bold> <#> FEAR </bold> </h><p> <#> She said also that more consideration should be given to children and families who made an initial disclosure but who then opted out of the prescribed system, perhaps through fear of legal implications for the alleged abuser. </p><p> <#> She concluded that while obviously further development of services for victims of abuse was essential, treatment services for abusers should also be highlighted. Given the low rate of abusers who received treatment or who were prosecuted, there was perhaps a need to review the legal procedure for dealing with those cases. </p><p> <#> (People concerned about abuse are advised by Dr. Keenleyside to contact their G.P., or their social services at Tel 015 - 76111). </p></I>
