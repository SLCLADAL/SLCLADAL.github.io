<W2C-005 Belfast Telegraph 4><I><W2C-005$A><h> <#> Jet fumes cause sickness - claim <#> Gail Walker </h><p> <#> More than 100 people have accused Belfast City Airport of literally making them sick. </p><p> <#> In the past four weeks about 130 residents living close to the Sydenham base have complained of nausea and headaches which they blame on aircraft fumes. </p><p> <#> Some have suffered symptoms so severe that they have been given medication by their doctor. </p><p> <#> Ulster Unionist councillor Jim Rodgers says the situation is so serious he has contacted the airport to see what can be done. </p><p> <quote> <#> "At least 130 people have either rang or written to me in the last few weeks. </p><p> <#> "They all live in the Sydenham, Inverary Park, Holywood Road, and Garnerville area and say they have been feeling very unwell. </p><p> <#> "The problem seems to occur when the Whispering Jet 146 is preparing for take off and it depends on how bad the winds are as well. </p><p> <#> "But I know that some people have felt so miserable they have seen their doctor for some medicine and have been told that the fumes are the likely cause of their symptoms. </p><p> <#> "I, myself, have been observing this jet as it gets ready for take-off and there is a definite smell of fuel." </quote> </p><p> <#> But Belfast City Airport today denied that the Whispering Jet - so named because of its low noise - could cause ill health. </p><p> <#> A spokesman said: <quote> "We have no reason to believe the aircraft has been causing a problem. </p><p> <#> "It has been operating out of the airport for the past five years and on a more frequent basis than it is doing now and we have not had any <}> <-> conplaints </-> <+> complaints </+> </}> of this nature in the past. </p><p> <#> "We would like to point out that these residents are also living beside a busy dual carraigeway and a railway line." </quote> </p><p> <#> The spokesman said airport staff had met with Mr Rodgers and had now asked the councillor to put his complaints in writing. </p><p> <#> Mr Rodgers said that he was not an opponent of the airport and added that staff at the base had been very helpful. </p><p> <quote> <#> "This airport has brought a lot of employment for both sides of the community and I believe we have to back this. <#> I am sure the problem can be sorted out." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-005$A><h> <#> Poyntz slams the men of violence <#> Gail Walker </h><p> <#> Mourners at the funeral today of murdered prison officer Jim Peacock will hear a hard-hitting address from the Bishop of Connor, Dr Samuel Poyntz. </p><p> <#> Speaking before the service, Dr Poynz said that his sermon would be <quote> "very direct" </quote> but added: <quote> "Wrong is wrong and must always be condemned" </quote> . </p><p> <#> Hundreds of people were expected to attend the service for Mr Peacock, who died in his teenage daughter 's arms minutes after UVF gunmen shot him in the back at his north Belfast house. </p><h> <#> Private </h><p> <#> A private service, attended by his wife Sandra and children Mark, Lisa, Samantha, Kelly and Penny, was being held in the family home at Joanmount Park at noon. </p><p> <#> The cortege was then due to make its way to Holy Trinity Parish Church on the Oldpark Road for a service at 1pm. </p><p> <#> All prisons and the Young Offenders Centre cancelled visits and parcel deliveries today to enable many of Mr Peacocks colleagues to attend the funeral. </p><h> <#> Slept </h><p> <#> Fifteen children have been left without a parent after loyalist terrorists murdered four people this week. </p><p> <#> Roman Catholic mother-of-four Teresa Dowds de Mogollon was shot dead in her north Belfast home and Catholic delivery man Jim Bell was killed outside an ice-cream factory in the east of the city. </p><p> <#> Father-of-six Michael Edwards was murdered in bed as he slept beside his wife yesterday. </p><p> <#> After the service, Mr Peacock was being buried in Ballymoney Cemetery later this afternoon. </p><p> <#> The Northern Ireland Prison Service said that any visitors holding passes for today should contact their relevant prison on Monday to rearrange their visit. </p></I><I><W2C-005$B><h> <#> Caught in the act ... <#> John Laverty </h><p> <#> The referee at the centre of the Dinamo Tbilisi bribes scandal DID accept the 5,000 dollars offered by the Georgian club prior to their European Cup match with Linfield. </p><p> <#> But Mr Erman Torughu handed over the cash to UEFA on Thursday as evidence of a bribe, prompting Tbilisi 's sensational dismissal from the competition. </p><p> <#> Tbilisi have 48 hours to appeal the decision but it looks as if Linfield are back in the competition - and suddenly <*> pound sign </*> 100,000 better off courtesy of UEFA payments and television rights. </p><p> <#> The news was greeted like a pools win at Windsor Park, a mix of euphoria and amazement. </p><p> <#> Chairman David Campbell said: <quote> "We 're still in a state of shock over this development. </p><p> <#> "As far as we were concerned Tbilisi had won the tie fair and square. </p><p> <#> "The idea of them trying to bribe the Turkish officials is nothing short of astonishing." </quote> </p><p> <#> Manager Trevor Anderson added: <quote> "I 've played all over Europe and have never come across this sort of thing before. </p><p> <#> "I suppose we should be flattered that Dinamo Tbilisi felt they needed a little help to get past us. </p><p> <#> "It 's an unsavoury business but anyone involved in this sort of corruption deserves everything they get." </quote> </p><p> <#> FC Copenhagen, who were due to play Tbilisi in the first round proper, have no doubt that Linfield will now be their opponents - in Belfast on Wednesday week. </p><p> <#> Manager Benne Johannsen said: <quote> "We are already making travel arrangements for Belfast. </p><p> <#> "I can't see UEFA overturning their decision. <#> They do not make decisions like this on the spur of the moment. <#> The evidence against them appears to be overwhelming." </quote> </p><p> <#> Johannsen accompanied Linfield to Tbilisi for the first leg game in Georgia, and like everyone else was unaware of the cash offer to the Turkish officials. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It took me completely by surprise," </quote> he said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Having said that I 'm not disappointed that we 're set to play Linfield and not Tbilisi. </p><p> <#> "I saw at first hand the problems Linfield had with travel arrangements and communications ... give me Belfast every time." </quote> </p><p> <#> It 's likely Tbilisi will appeal the decision, with UEFA hearing it next Saturday - but FC Copenhagen would like a earlier confirmation. <quote> <#> "As far as we 're concerned we will arrive in Belfast a week from Monday. <#> A Saturday decision would give us very little time to alter our plans," </quote> said the manager. </p><p> <#> The first inkling that something was amiss came on Wednesday, when Linfield were requested by UEFA to organise flights for Tbilisi officials to Geneva. </p><p> <#> The Blues suspected the Georgians would be carpeted for their haphazard arranging of the first leg tie; the Windsor Park club had already complained to UEFA about this. </p><p> <#> But Linfield had no idea that Dinamo were being investigated for suspected bribery. </p><p> <#> Secretary Derek Brooks said: <quote> "We arranged flights for club president Marab Jordania and Georgian FA president Nodar Akhalkatsi; they flew to Geneva while the rest of the party took a chartered flight to Georgia. </p><p> <#> "There was no inkling that a bribery scandal was about to unfold; we certainly didn't instigate it." </quote> </p><p> <#> A UEFA spokesman explained: <quote> "The referee presented his match report which stated that money had been offered to both him and his officials. </p><p> <#> "He presented this as evidence at our investigation on Thursday and the action we took was as a direct consequence." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-005$C><h> <#> Dunnes get fine for beetle infested soup </h><p> <#> Dunnes Stores has been fined <*> pound sign </*> 100 after 14 beetles and 24 larvae were found in a packet of dried soup being eaten by a Kilkeel woman. </p><p> <#> The firm was also ordered to pay <*> pound sign </*> 110 costs at Newry Magistrate 's Court yesterday. </p><h> <#> Strange </h><p> <#> Dunnes Stores was charged with selling Knorr Bavarian dried soup not of quality demanded, at its shop in Greencastle Street, Kilkeel, to Mrs Lorraine Trainor of Fearon Park, Kilkeel, last January. </p><p> <#> Rory McShane, for Newry and Mourne Council, said Mrs Trainor 's daughter noticed something rather strange about it when she started to eat the soup. </p><p> <#> She discovered the material was rotten and that it was contaminated. </p><p> <#> The public analyst found it contained 14 beetles, 24 larvae and nine pupal cases, also that it had the characteristics of the Australian beetle, which attacts and infects dried food products. </p><p> <#> There was a small hole about one-and-a-half millimetres wide in the packet, through which the initial infestation could have arisen. </p><p> <#> Counsel for Dunnes, which pleaded guilty to the charge, said this could not have occurred in the store at Kilkeel. <#> It seemed certain it happened at the time of manufacture. </p><p> <#> Regional Magistrate Gerry Harty agreed that the firm had a good record and said it bought vast quantities for distribution to its various stores. </p></I><I><W2C-005$D><h> <#> Baby Caolan sees in his first birthday <#> Darwin Templeton </h><p> <#> This is the day that many thought Belfast double transplant baby Caolan McDonald would never see - his first birthday. </p><p> <#> Just weeks ago Caolan was given eight hours to live, as a frantic search was started across Europe for a donor liver. </p><p> <#> But the tiny tot - whose name means "fair haired slender lad" - has defied the medics and the odds to survive. </p><h> <#> Priority </h><p> <#> He has now been taken out of intensive care and is eating and putting on weight. </p><p> <#> Caolan 's aunt, Eileen, said it was a very happy day for the family, but that the double transplant operation was still a priority. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We aren't putting too much emphasis on his first birthday - we will celebrate when he gets his operation," </quote> said Eileen. </p><p> <quote> <#> "They are going to have a party on the ward. <#> A lot of children are sick so they will just be having a quiet gathering. </quote> </p><h> <#> Presents </h><p> <#> <quote> "But there will be plenty of presents, I can tell you." </quote> </p><p> <#> Caolan was born this day last year with a rare stomach complaint that claimed his bowel at birth and then destroyed his liver. </p><p> <#> Father Brendan said: <quote> "We are being allowed to take Caolan out of the hospital today for the first time in three months. </p><p> <#> "He is doing great now, but his condition could deteriorate in the blink of an eye. </p><p> <#> "Either way we are going to enjoy ourselves today." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-005$E><h> <#> Pensioner strikes it rich with Roman treasures <#> Press Association </h><p> <#> Retired gardener Eric Lawes was today looking forward to a glowing future as a probable multi-millionaire after a coroner 's jury decided that a hoard of 14,000 Roman coins and jewellery he found with his metal detector is treasure trove. </p><p> <#> But 70-year-old Mr Lowes, who unearthed the historic treasures while searching for lost tools on Home Farm, at Hoxne, Suffolk last November, is totally relaxed about the whole thing. </p><p> <#> After yesterday 's jury ruling in Lowestoft, a calm Mr Lawes said: <quote> "I am glad it is all over. <#> We shall just wait and see now. </p><p> <#> "I was not that excited. <#> It was just one of those things. </quote> </p><h> <#> Public </h><p> <#> <quote> "The place for this is in the British Museum for all the public to see." </quote> </p><p> <#> He will share the money with his friend Peter Whatling, the tenant farmer of the land where the treasure was buried. </p><p> <#> Mr Lawes and Mr Whatling said they had signed a partnership deal once it became clear how important the find was. <#> The cash will be decided on by a special committee from the Department of National Heritage. </p><p> <#> Mr Lawes was praised for bringing in experts from Suffolk County Council 's archaeological department, who were astonished to find thousands of coins, sets of spoons, pepper pots and other valuables from the fifth century. </p></I><I><W2C-005$F><h> <#> Cures come from the Orient <#> Laurence White </h><p> <#> The mysteries of Oriental alternative medicine are about be unveiled in Co Down. </p><p> <#> A clinic offering Chinese natural health treatment is to open at Ballyward, near Banbridge. </p><p> <#> Dr Hao Rifang, who has practised in China, Poland and London, will carry out acupuncture and herbal therapy at the Closkelt Road premises. </p><p> <#> The centre is the idea of local businessman Nari Sherewani. </p><h> <#> Clinic </h><p> <#> He said: <quote>"I got interested in Chinese medicine during my travels in the Far East and eventually was introduced to Dr Hao in England." </quote> </p><p> <#> She agreed to visit Northern Ireland to examine the feasibility of setting up a clinic here and has been granted a four year work permit. </p><p> <#> Dr Hao said herbal therapy and acupuncture works best in the treatment of skin diseases such as dermatitis and eczema, and internal disorders such as headaches, ulcers and gastritis, using natural products. </p><h> <#> Symptoms </h><p> <#> She said it can also be used for the relief of pain, emotional and sexual problems and as an aid to stopping smoking. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Chinese medicine works on the principle of treating the causes not the symptoms. <#> We try to treat the underlying condition which is causing the pain." </quote> </p></I>
