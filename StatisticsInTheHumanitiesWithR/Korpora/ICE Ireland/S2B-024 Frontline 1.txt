<ICE-IRE:S2B-024 Frontline 1><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> It 's easy to raise a laugh like that in Belfast <#> It 's the laughter of contempt <,> contempt for our own gullibility in thinking that the long war was ending <,> contempt for those who still try to string out our hopes <#> My name is Malachi O'Doherty <#> I 'm a journalist here in Belfast <#> This place continually hovers between peace and disaster <,> weeks when hardly anything happens <,> weeks when someone 's being killed nearly every day <#> It 's like breathing in and breathing out <#> Months ago we were told that the Republican movement was ready to settle terms with the British <#> That would 've changed everything <#> It hasn't happened <#> I want to know what 's holding things up <&> musical interlude </&> <#> I doubt that the IRA want anything at all but to win <&> musical interlude </&> <#> Change is coming to Northern Ireland <,> but an end to the killing <#> That depends on gunmen <#> If it was just a cruel joke that the conflict was over <,> then it was no more cruel than a lot of things that happen here <#> Now there 's no way I can go into the secret heart of the IRA and see what they are thinking and planning <#> What I can do <,> is go into the community they inhabit <,> and see what pressures there might be on them there <,> either to settle terms now <,> or get on with the struggle<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$B> <#> This is an ancient historic Irish town <,> full of Irish people and with this imposed upon us <#> Your presence here on the street is far more important than any meeting anybody can have with any minister or anybody else sitting there with a cup of tea and saying ha what about this old chap <#> Your coming out shows that you 're opposed to this <#> You have the power <&> Claps and cheers </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> Where the IRA is most active you will always find local conditions that fire them up <#> Each area is fighting a different war <#> I 've come to Crossmaglen on the border <#> There are few Protestants here <,> and Republicanism builds on a popular distaste for the army <#> The people are out protesting <#> The Provos have got the soldiers in their sights <&> background speech and music </&> <#> Only the Irish flag will ever fly freely here <#> A British flag would need an armed guard <#> The only peace that will ever hold here <,> will be an Irish peace <#> The old Republican war cry is Brits out <#> In South Armagh it 's hard to explain why Brits should be in <#> There are no peace lines to defend here because there are no ghettoes <#> The whole area is Catholic Irish Nationalist <,> and an army presence like this is viewed as foreign <,> and intrusive <#> This really is like a land under occupation<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$B> <#> I can't see that the IRA will be asking for anything less than total British withdrawal in the long term not necessarily tomorrow morning kind of thing and people understand that <#> But in a town like this to go back to that question in a town like Crossmaglen uhm <,> even a remnant of the British Army remaining here would be a source of tension and will not aid the peace process <#> There would be a sizeable section of people who 'll see them as uhm more than an irritant <,> as a major source of the problem and therefore violence will continue while they are here<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> A ground-swell of Nationalist opinion is strong and unruffled here <#> These people don't all support the IRA of course <,> but whatever compromise others choose to make <,> their sense that the British are the problem <,> is solid and unchanged<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$C> <#> The British Army 's role in South Armagh in particular and uh elsewhere in is well it 's debatable uhm their their role anywhere 's debateable <#> Certainly in South Armagh they aren't protecting anybody here <,> because uhm as you can see from the turnout here today nobody particularly wants them here<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> In Belfast it is different <#> This city could 've been designed for conflict <,> not between the Irish and the British <,> but between Protestants and Catholics <#> They live in separate streets and housing estates <,> with separate <,> irreconcilable identities <&> music </&> <#> The issue between them was whether this place is British <,> or Irish <#> Some people here accept that there will have to be a compromise that will allow it to be both <#> Many do not <&> background speakers </&> <#> The playwright Martin Lynch has a strong sense of the mood and the convictions of the people of Catholic West Belfast <,> where he lives <#> In his plays he has frequently explored the roots of paramilitary violence <,> and the fears and feelings of his own community<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$D> <#> And I can remember right <.> thr </.> right over for instance the <,> the Christmas period groups of people <,> people at my age and older who who only know the Troubles in in some senses uhm or who 've had spent all their adult lives in the Troubles <,> for the first time seriously beginning to contemplate what it might be like <,> to have peace <#> People were saying like wonder what 'd be like to walk into downtown without being searched <#> What it 'd be like to walk down the streets and have no Brits about <#> What it 'd be like not to have the Provos you know hijacking every now or again or shooting somebody <#> People actually were asking questions like that which I don't remember <,> uh anything like that in the seventies and eighties <#> The problem is that I mean as the months went on I think a lot of people a lot of people began to say well you know it 's another uh cul-de-sac and there isn't much hope <&> music </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-024$E> <#> And welcome again to uh the second of our Talkbalk election phone-ins today <#> Waiting your calls on Belfast three two five seven five seven that 's oh two three two three two five seven five seven the President of Sinn Fe/in Gerry Adams<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> The hopes of an end to the IRA campaign <,> rest on this one man <#> The history of Republicanism could be traced through Gerry Adams ' wardrobe <#> The suit represents the credible politician phase <#> He wouldn't always have dressed up for a visit to a Radio Ulster studio <,> at the British Broadcasting Corporation<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$F> <#> Now I personally would like to ask you whether or not you intend <,> to join the rest of humanity in clawing our way out of this primeval swamp <,> stop this violence and stop it now <#> There is absolutely no mandate from anyone <,> in Ireland or in England for you to continue to sanction the killing of innocent men women and children<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$G> <#> I 'm very glad Mary you got to the point there <#> The reality of the situation is <,> there is a peace process going on <,> but it 's my firm conviction that peace process <,> will conclude with a peace settlement <#> As part of that Sinn Fe/in and everyone else needs to be involved<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$E> <#> Okay well thanks for your call now <#> As I say we we 're very very busy at the moment <&> background music </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> In the seventies when Adams looked like a student <,> and talked about overthrowing the Dublin government too <,> he may have felt a dignified arrest was only his due <#> As the charismatic star of Republicanism <,> he used to dismiss Loyalists as neo-fascists <#> Now he is saying they have to be included <#> He has changed enough to work through Dublin <,> but will he concede to Protestant fears and call the gunmen off<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$G> <#> The personal priority <,> for me <,> is to move this situation forward <,> into a negotiated peace settlement to bring about a lasting peace <&> background conversation </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> The man who believes that Adams has changed is John Hume <,> the leader of Sinn Fe/in 's chief rival party the SDLP <&> background conversation </&> <#> His recent thumping for Euro votes won him the thanks of Belfast Catholics for his peace efforts <&> background conversation and music </&> <#> John Hume 's political career grew out of the same unrest in the late sixties <,> which threw the Catholic community into conflict with the state <#> He committed himself to peaceful change <#> An irony in his regard for Adams now <,> is that he suffered at the hands of the IRA for the course he followed<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$H> <#> My home used to be picketed by supporters of the Provisional IRA <#> Uh it used to be daubed and painted by them <#> Uh two cars were destroyed by them and indeed the the the last attack which was in nineteen eighty-seven was the worst ever when five hooded men <,> fire-bombed my home <,> with my wife and daughter inside and destroyed my wife 's car sitting at the door <#> So uh <,> I 've <,> as I say I 've been opposed to violence <,> all my life<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> Those who have not opposed violence have been forced to live behind grilles and barriers <&> music </&> <#> Their leader Gerry Adams was cleared of some of the stigma <,> though none of the danger <,> when John Hume stooped to talk terms with him <#> They signed an accord suggesting that the Dublin government could guarantee the rights of the Unionists <#> There was a nifty little device at the heart of the Hume Adams accord <#> It was that the border which the Provos had been bombing the British to get rid of would stay <,> but this time under a guarantee from the Irish Government <,> not from the British <#> Now the Provos might not like that <,> but it would leave them no excuse to bomb the Brits <#> They could say well if you don't like it take it up with Dublin <#> Now if this was the beginning of a real political process it was one that was going to lead to compromise <#> The Provos knew that <,> and they bought it <&> music </&> <#> The popular view is that the IRA are more mercenary than political <,> only in it for the money <#> So if they are ready to stop they must be broke <#> This is claimed in the British media <,> by sources close to the intelligence services <&> music </&> <#> The IRA is said to be siphoning money from drinking-clubs <,> pirating videos and hawking fake perfume <#> And there have been recent claims of police success <,> against IRA rackets <#> But how credible are these police claims to be busting up the IRA 's racketeering <#> I 've my doubts about them <#> I sometimes wonder if they don't belong more to the propaganda war than to anything else <#> These stories 've been cropping up for years and if you go into any library and look at the cutting 's file <,> you 'll see exactly what I mean <#> It 's an old story <#> Go back to nineteen eighty-seven and the papers are reporting the squeeze is being put on the paramilitaries <#> A year later <,> in the same paper <,> the same story the same word a squeeze that 's getting tighter on them <#> Come into the nineties the IRA 's blood money is being cut off <#> In fact through that whole period the IRA was getting progressively more active <,> not less <#> And then you come up into the present day <,> and it 's that word again the squeeze on terror funding <#> None of this is a credible explanation of why the IRA should now want to settle terms <#> And in fact the police themselves say privately that when the IRA want more money <,> they 'll go out and steal it<&> doorbell rings </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-024$I> <#> Hello <#> Who 's there<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> Hello Bobby <#> It 's Malachi O'Doherty<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$I> <#> <&> speaks Irish </&> Malachi<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> There are serious pressures on Republicans though <#> Last August Loyalists attacked the home of Sinn Fe/in Councillor Bobby Lavery and killed his son <#> They 'd already murdered his brother <#> The Lavery 's home is now a bunker <#> Bobby himself can't live there <#> That 's the price for being a Republican in Belfast<ICE-IRE:S2B-024$A> <#> <{> <[> Hi Bobby <#> How 're you doing <#> Thanks for seeing me
