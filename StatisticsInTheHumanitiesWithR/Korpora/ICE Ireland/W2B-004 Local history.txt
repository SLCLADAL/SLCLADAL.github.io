<W2B-004 Local history><I><W2B-004$A><h> <#> Peter Hutcheon looks at a project which is charting local history </h><h> <#> A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE. . . </h><p> <quote> <bold> <#> "A COMMUNITY history by the people for the people"</quote> is how NICEA describes its oral history project in south Belfast. </bold> </p><p> <#> Now entering its second phase, the project has captured the imagination of both the participants and the thousands of people who have been to see the results of the initial stage. </p><p> <#> NICEA the Northern Ireland Community Education Association, has spent the past year charting memories and gathering photographs depicting the history of the Markets and Lower Ormeau areas. </p><p> <#> The stories have been compiled into five booklets which have gone on display, along with the extensive collection of photos, at various community centres throughout the area. </p><p> <#> Visitors from other parts of Northern Ireland, the Republic and from as far afield as America and Canada have expressed an interest in displaying the work further afield. <#> Indeed, an exhibition is planned for the Irish Heritage Centre in New York. </p><p> <#> And eventually copies of all the work produced by the project will be kept at the Ulster Folk Museum. </p><p> <#> Project manager Caroline Bingham explained that the Lower Ormeau and Markets area was chosen for phase one because it was an inner-city area where cross-community links could be strengthened. </p><h> <bold> <#> Contrast </bold> </h><p> <quote> <#> "The project has three distinct aspects: recording the stories of many working class people, broadcasting and publishing their stories and organising photographic exhibitions." </quote> </p><p> <#> Work is now beginning on collecting stories and photos from the Donegall Pass area of the city. <#> A Protestant working class area, it has been chosen deliberately to contrast with the initial phase. </p><p> <#> Next year the group plans to interview people from both sides of the Donegall Road, the Village and the Falls Road ends, to contrast the memories of this mixed area with the previous two. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Ultimately we want to show both Catholics and Protestants that there is very little difference in their backgrounds," </quote> said project worker Anne O'Shea. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We hope that this realisation that they come from the same backgrounds and experience the same problems will contribute a little to understanding each other." </quote> </p><p> <#> Jill McKenna, who compiled the five booklets of interviews, explained: <quote> "We have aimed with these publication to give ordinary people a platform to talk about their own lives and experiences. <#> It 's history from the bottom up, instead of the usual way from the top down." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "We hope that, taken as a whole, they will give a new insight into the recent history of this fascinating and diverse area, which in itself is a microcosm of the city of Belfast." </quote> </p><h> <bold> <#> Community </bold> </h><p> <#> Material gathered through the project has now been incorporated into local school 's history lessons. </p><p> <#> Project worker David Holloway pointed out: <quote> "Most of the history taught in schools deals with the major political figures, not how life was like for ordinary people living in the community." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "These stories and memories give an insight into how life really was for the people coming from the children 's own areas." </quote> </p><p> <#> NICEA was founded in 1984 to promote the need and find funding for community education. </p><p> <#> The funding for the current project has come from the Belfast Action Teams, while Belfast Exposed helped with the photography. </p></I><I><W2B-004$B><h> <bold> <#> A STORY FROM THE PAST. . . </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> THE following is an extract from 'Belfast Women - Past and Present', compiled by Jill McKenna, which was one of the five booklets produced in the initial phase of the NICEA project: </bold> </h><p> <#> One of the saddest aspects of "the old days" was the treatment meted out to unmarried girls who became pregnant. </p><p> <#> They were condemned by society and seen as a disgrace to their families. <#> Sometimes they were forced into hastily-arranged marriages, and sometimes they were thrown out into the streets to fend for themselves. <#> If they weren't, they were sent away to homes for unmarried mothers or "fallen women", where they were made to work hard till their babies were born as a punishment for getting pregnant. <#> Some had their babies in the workhouse. <#> The babies were almost always adopted, often without the mother 's consent. </p><p> <#> If they were lucky, other members of the family were prepared to help them. <#> A widow in her eighties remembered what happened when her cousin, who came from the country, became pregnant. </p><p> <quote> <#> "When I was fourteen, my mother told me one Saturday that I had to go out the road in a side-car and meet my aunt and cousin." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "My cousin would have her case with her and she was to come back home with me. <#> She didn't give me any reason, but unless you were told you didn«t ask questions. <#> So I did what she said and brought my cousin back and my mother put a single bed in the parlour and put her in there." </quote> </p><p> <#> <}> <-> He </-> <+> Her </+> </}> mother, a widow, took in lodgers to make ends meet. </p><p> <quote> <#> "When the men were at work, my cousin had the run of the house, but before they came in at five o'clock she had to go into the parlour and stay there. <#> I didn't know why she was kept in there." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "Then one morning about five o'clock I woke up and heard a child crying. <#> I slipped downstairs and I could hear a child crying in our parlour. <#> I didn't know what was going on, but I crept back upstairs, because if my mother had caught me down there she 'd have hit me!" </quote> </p><p> <#> Unmarried mothers are now a thing of the past. <#> Nowadays they are called single parents, reflecting the more sympathetic and tolerant view of society in general towards unmarried girls who become pregnant. </p><p> <#> Some things at least have changed for the better since a terrified girl was smuggled to the city in a side-car to escape her <}> <-> fathers ' </-> <+> father 's </+> </}> wrath. </p></I><I><W2B-004$C><h> <bold> <#> HILLSBOROUGH </bold> </h><p> <#> That immaculate little County Down town, owes its origin to Peter Hill, son of Moyses Hill and husband of a sister of the formidable Somhairle Buidhe MacDonnell, cousin and son-in-law of Great Hugh O'Neill. <#> Around 1630 Peter Hill started to build a village and a fort on the site of Hillsborough. <#> These were, however destroyed in 1641, but somewhere in the 1650s Peter 's uncle and heir, Col. Arthur Hill, built an artillery fort on the site. <#> In 1660 it was made a Royal garrison, with Hill and his heirs hereditary Constables. <#> It was not long after this that Hill obtained a charter for his town - from then onwards to be known as Hillsborough. <#> The first Marquess of Downshire (Wills Hill) sponsored Goldsmith 's "Deserted Village" and became George III 's Secretary of State for the American Colonies. <#> His successor, the second Marquess, who lived from 1753 until 1801, was a strong advocate of religious toleration and strongly opposed the Union, for which he dearly paid. </p><p> <#> It is to the Marquises of Downshire that Hillsborough owes its English influence. </p><p> <#> William of Orange stayed at the fort on his way to the Boyne in June, 1690, and throughout the years many Royal personages spent time at Hillsborough Castle when it was known as Government House, official residence of the Governor of Northern Ireland. </p><p> <#> The building of this impressive structure was started around 1760 for Wills Hill and was enlarged for the second Marquess of Downshire at the end of the 1700's by Brettingham. <#> Further additions were made to the house in the middle of the 18th century by the architect, William Sandys. <#> A tall column on a high hill, south of the town commemorates the third Marquess of Downshire and at the north end of Main Street, facing the gate of St. Malachy 's Church, there is a statue of the fourth Marquess. <#> The lovely Parish Church of St. Malachy, which was completed in 1772 is a highly interesting Gothic structure which can still boast most of its original furnishings. </p><p> <#> It was built for Wills Hill and is thought to incorporate much of the fabric of its 1662 predecessor. <#> Wills Hill 's aim was to have it made the cathedral of the Protestant diocese of Down. </p><p> <#> The architect 's name is unknown, but Hill himself closely supervised the work. <#> Sir Thomas Drew re-arranged the chancel in 1898 and set the prayer desk and pulpit back against the side walls and aligned the pews (which had been behind the desk and pulpit) along the walls. <#> In the same year, the screens shutting off the baptistry and vestry from the west end of the nave were removed. <#> In 1951 and 1965, the well-known Ulster architect, Denis O'D Hanna, screened off the transept towers and removed the old vestry at the west end of the nave. <#> The new electric lights were designed by Sir. Albert Richardson, P.R.A. <#> Other noteworthy features include the 18th century prayer desk, pulpit and box pews, the east window (to the design of Sir Joshua Reynolds) by Francis Elginton of Birmingham; the north transept memorial to the fifth Marquess of Downshire (1844-74), by Forsythe; William Harty, father of Sir Hamilton Harty, celebrated conductor and composer was organist to the church from 1878 until 1918 and near to the west door is a memorial to Sir Hamilton in the form of a bird bath. <#> There is the State Chair from the Chapel Royal, Dublin Castle; the south transept organ (from Hillsborough Castle) of 1795, by G. P. England and the west gallery organ (1772), by John Snetzler, which was- re-built several times. <#> Near to the Parish Church stands Col. Arthur Hill 's 17th century star-shaped artillery fort. <#> A 1758 Gothic tower house occupies the site of the original gate-tower and a contemporary Strawberry-Hill gazebo crowns the 1758 cart entrance. <#> The lawn gates in front of the tower house are late 18th century, as are the ones at the entrance to Hillsborough Square. </p><p> <bold> <#> The Carriage Restaurant </bold> of Old Coach Road, Hillsborough, certainly has an enviable reputation for catering for functions, large or small. <#> The restaurant can cater for all types of celebrations, from the intimate dinner-for-two, to weddings, family get-togethers, christenings, etc., and is suitable for parties of up to 80 people. <#> Situated in the delightful County Down countryside, just half-a-mile from the town centre, the Carriage uses only the freshest local produce to maintain the highest possible standards. <#> Personal menus can easily be arranged to suit individual needs. <#> Whether dining as a member of a party or as an intimate twosome you can be assured of a warm Christmas welcome, with a friendly and efficient service, and as well, of course, excellent cuisine. <#> An a la carte menu is available throughout December for parties up to 20 persons, with some tantalizing dishes on offer. <#> Sample the delights of roast pheasant, fresh from one of the local estates, served with black cherry sauce, or Paupiette de Sole Duexelle Lobster sauce, a delicious fillet of sole stuffed with mushrooms and shallots, coated with a lobster sauce, and garnished with fleurons. <#> The Restaurant is fully licensed and has an extensive wine list. <#> If you are tired of the usual meals on offer this season, why not try the Carriage. <#> You certainly won't be disappointed. <#> Bon Appetit! </p><p> <#> Especially for weddings! <#> Owners Ray and Sylvia Beacom will happily prepare personal menus to the bride and groom 's own specifications. <#> The Carriage Restaurant is only too glad to help you make your wedding day that little bit different and certainly very special. </p><p> <#> The Carriage Restaurant, Old Coach Road, Hillsborough.
