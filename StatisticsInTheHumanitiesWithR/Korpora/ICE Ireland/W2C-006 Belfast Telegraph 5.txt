<W2C-006 Belfast Telegraph 5><I><W2C-006$A><h> <#> BLITZ ON BENEFIT CHEATS <#> Darwin Templeton </h><h> <#> Investigators save <*> pound sign </*>10m for taxpayers </h><p> <#> Benefit fraud officers have uncovered more than 6,500 fraudsters who were attempting to swindle the Social Security Agency in Ulster. </p><p> <#> And they believe their investigations saved Ulster taxpayers more than <*> pound sign </*> 10m in the year to April. </p><p> <#> Figures released today show they took 1,182 claimants to court and almost all were convicted of fraud. </p><p> <#> Some 17 employers were also prosecuted, of whom 14 were found guilty of colluding in fraudulent claims. </p><p> <#> Another 327 people were convicted of irregularities involving giro cheques and order books. </p><h> <#> Stiff </h><p> <#> But the greatest problem still lies with claimants "doing the double" - claiming benefit while working or while their partners are working. </p><p> <#> SSA officers have identified the building trade, taxi-driving and posts in the service industries as <quote> "high risk" </quote> categories. </p><p> <#> Those convicted faced stiff penalties, with 15 people jailed for benefit fraud and a further 59 being given suspended sentences. </p><p> <#> There were 3,369 bogus claims detected in the Belfast region, 1,230 in the western region, 1,001 in the southern region and 980 in the northern region. </p><p> <#> Commenting on the figures, Health and Social Services Minister Lord Arran, said: <quote> "The benefit system is there to help those in need and it is disgraceful that there are still many wage earners who obtain benefit by deception. </p><p> <#> "The fact that these results have been achieved in a difficult working environment is an indication of the dedication and professionalism of the staff. </quote> </p><h> <#> Detected </h><p> <#> <quote> "The vast majority of social security customers are honest, with genuine entitlement to benefit and as such they have nothing to fear from the Agency 's anti-fraud efforts." </quote> </p><p> <#> Ulster Unionist social security spokesman, Clifford Forsythe, said: <quote> "At this time when public finances are under such pressure from so many quarters it is essential that benefits go to those who are properly entitled to them. </p><p> <#> "It is very encouraging that the Social Security Agency is making such strenuous efforts to ensure that bogus claimants are detected at an early stage." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-006$B><h> <#> Knife attack on horse <#> Mary Kelly </h><p> <#> The USPCA today appealed for help in tracking down the <quote> "sick pervert" </quote> responsible for a knife attack on a horse in Ballynahinch. </p><p> <#> Superintendent Francis Fox said he was <quote> "disgusted" </quote> by the latest incident - the fourth attack on horses in the province this year. </p><p> <#> <quote> "We are very concerned at these incidents and we would appeal to anyone with any information to contact us or the police before an animal is killed." </quote> </p><p> <#> Police in Downpatrick believe the latest attack happened in the Crabtree area of Ballynahinch sometime between Sunday evening and yesterday afternoon. </p><h> <#> Horrific </h><p> <#> The horse 's owner, Joe Mahood, said he found his horse with several gashes across his legs and stomach. </p><p> <quote> <#> "There was a six inch gash on his back leg and the skin is lying open. <#> Another six inch long wound on his stomach is not as deep, but the area is badly swollen and he has another inch deep wound on his front leg where the knife was stuck in." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Fox said one attack was bad enough, but four in the space of months was <quote> "horrific" </quote>. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It is just impossible to understand the sick, perverted mentality of someone who could stab horses in this way," </quote> he said. </p></I><I><W2C-006$C><h> <#> UVF admit murder bid on Protestant <#> Gary Grattan </h><p> <#> The UVF have admitted they tried to kill a Protestant man in east Belfast last night. </p><p> <#> But, in a call to a Belfast newsroom, the loyalist terror group denied there was any political or sectarian motive for the attack. </p><h> <#> Ponytail </h><p> <#> Police have discounted a sectarian motive and are pursuing <quote> "a specific line of enquiry." </quote> </p><p> <#> The 43-year-old victim was <quote> "very seriously ill but stable" </quote> after undergoing emergency surgery in the Royal Victoria Hospital. </p><p> <#> He was shot twice in the chest by a lone, unmasked gunman at the front door of his home at Palmerston Park, Holywood Road, at around 9.40 pm. </p><p> <#> Police have issued a description of the gunman. <#> He is said to be aged between 29-30, around 6 ft tall and of slim build with a thin face, dark eyebrows, narrow eyes and a long narrow nose. </p><p> <#> He is thought to have a short ponytail and was wearing a black leather jacket and dark denim trousers. </p><p> <#> Leading loyalist, Gerry Drumgoole - wounded in an INLA murder bid in the Shankill area yesterday afternoon - was today said to be <quote> "stable" </quote> in hospital. </p><p> <#> Mr Drumgoole, who is in his early 30s, was shot once in the stomach by two INLA gunmen as he sat outside his home in Hazelfield Street. </p><h> <#> Action </h><p> <#> The gunmen continued to fire at the house after he managed to scramble inside and slam the front door shut. </p><p> <#> The shooting is seen as retaliatory action following the murders of three Roman Catholic civilians by the UFF and UVF last week. </p><p> <#> Mr Drumgoole lost a leg and part of an arm in an under-car IRA booby-trap blast at Dover Street in November 1991. </p></I><I><W2C-006$D><h> <#> Man jailed for killing his girlfriend <#> Marie Foy </h><p> <#> An alcoholic who admitted killing his five months pregnant girlfriend was jailed for five years today. </p><p> <#> Jennifer Trimble (32), died two days after receiving head injuries during a drunken row with the accused Thomas Wightman in February last year. </p><p> <#> Belfast Crown Court heard that the couple 's six-year relationship had been stormy and that they had hit each other on numerous occasions. </p><h> <#> Cuts </h><p> <#> A Crown lawyer said police were called to the pair 's Donard Street home in Belfast after neighbours heard shouting and fighting. </p><p> <#> Officers found Wightman (35), with cuts to his eye. <#> Ms Trimble was lying unconscious on a settee in the front livingroom. </p><p> <#> She had severe bruises to the face and eyes and her head was wrapped in a towel. </p><p> <#> She failed to regain consciousness and died two days later in hospital. </p><p> <#> The prosecution said that the two had been out drinking and had started to fight when they came home. </p><p> <#> Wightman told police he hit his girlfriend 's head against the bathroom door or wall, but said he had not intended to kill her. </p><p> <#> Defence lawyer Tony Cinnamond said, however, that Wightman 's recollection of the events were hazy due to drink and it could have been that he struck her and her head banged against the wall. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Almost certainly this was a very unlucky blow for her and for him," </quote> he said. <#> The lawyer said the pair had fallen deeply in love and his client was <quote> "devastated" </quote> by what had happened. </p><p> <#> Passing sentence, Lord Justice MacDermott said: <quote> "The background to this case is one of excessive drinking and violence." </quote> </p><p> <#> He told Wightman: <quote> "People simply must not be violent towards each other. <#> If they are and this kind of tragedy occurs then they must be punished for such behaviour." </quote> </p><p> <#> The judge accepted that the accused would be <quote> "tormented" </quote> by this knowledge for the rest of his life. </p></I><I><W2C-006$E><h> <#> Shell sails into fare bias row <#> Martin Hill </h><p> <bold> <#> Shell forecourts have sailed into a "discrimination" row over ferry crossings. </bold> </p><p> <#> The oil company is in deep water for not taking part in a half-price fare offer - because they say people in Northern Ireland aren't interested. </p><p> <#> Shell filling stations in England, Scotland and Wales all run the promotion, which offers free travel with every 12 litres of petrol. </p><p> <#> Twelve vouchers get you a free foot-passenger return ticket on any Stena Sealink crossing. </p><p> <#> Thirty vouchers entitle you to half-price travel for a car and five people across the Irish Sea or the English Channel. </p><p> <#> But Shell says, because many of the promotions are run in conjunction with British Rail, there would be no demand here. </p><p> <#> And they 're giving away toy cars to customers, instead. </p><p> <#> Now motorists are threatening to give Shell pumps a wide berth. </p><h> <#> Excuse </h><p> <#> Robin Boyd, from Cormorant Park in Belfast, said: <quote> "I certainly won't be going into a Shell garage - unless I 'm running on empty. </p><p> <#> "To say people here wouldn't be interested in half-price ferry travel is a very feeble excuse. <#> I feel we 're being discriminated against. </p><p> <#> "My son lives in England and he saved up the vouchers to buy the ticket and posted it to me. <#> It means a saving of about <*> pound sign </*> 100. </p><p> <#> "Yet they say we wouldn't be interested in it here.</quote> </p><p> <#> A Shell spokeswoman said that, after a Heritage wine glass promotion finished in August, there was a six-week gap with no offer. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We didn't go in on the free travel promotion because many of the deals involved British Rail and we don't have it here," </quote> she said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "In the meantime, we have the Classic Cars promotion until another national one begins at the end of the month and we 'll be participating in that." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-006$F><h> <#> Top volume Whitney gets fan jail </h><p> <#> Whitney Houston was the weapon in a war of noise waged by a Teesside woman against her neighbour, a court has heard. </p><p> <#> Floorboards vibrated and door handles shook as the star 's hit song I Will Always Love You blasted out from Helen Stephen 's home, Teesside County Court was told. </p><p> <#> On one occasion workmen using a sledgehammer across the street warbled along with the star after hearing Helen 's tape. </p><p> <#> Next door neighbour Susan Hanley told Judge Peter Fox QC the noise was like <quote> "a psychological form of torture" </quote>. </p><p> <#> Helen (20) was yesterday locked up for seven days for what the judge described as a <quote> "nasty campaign of noise and harassment" </quote> . </p><h> <#> Complaints </h><p> <#> Helen 's tearful mother Anne Stephens said today: <quote> "Whether you believe it or anyone else believes it my daughter is innocent and she 's been sent to prison for a week for something she hasn't done." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mrs Stephens, who is considering appealing against the ruling, added: <quote> "Helen is a nice quiet girl and she wouldn't do anything like this." </quote> </p><p> <#> Referring to complaining neighbours the Hanleys she said: <quote> "I just don't know how they can sleep at night next door because I couldn't, knowing that I 'd done that to someone." </quote> </p><p> <#> Judge Fox told Helen she had <quote> "attacked" </quote> her next door neighbours with loud and repeated playings of Whitney 's hit song from the film The Bodyguard. </p><p> <#> Helen, of Moulton Grove, Fairfield, Stockton, burst into tears and had to be supported by relatives after being told she was going to a young offenders institution. </p><p> <#> Last night court bailiffs took Helen by taxi to Low Newton Remand Centre to start her sentence. </p><p> <#> After the case distraught Mrs Stephens, who was herself fined <*> pound sign </*> 200, condemned neighbour Mrs Hanley. <#> She said: <quote> "I hope that woman next door sleeps soundly in her bed tonight because my daughter won't." </quote> </p><p> <#> A stunned Mrs Hanley said as she left court: <quote> "We never wanted anybody to go to prison over this." </quote> <#> And Mr Hanley said: <quote> "All I wanted to do was to protect my family. <#> This was a deliberate campaign against us." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-006$G><h> <#> New RVH post <quote> 'will cut heart surgery waiting list' </quote> <#> Laurence White </h><p> <#> The waiting time for heart surgery should be dramatically cut with the appointment of a fifth cardiac surgeon at Belfast 's Royal Victoria Hospital. </p><p> <#> It will also mean that Ulster patients will no longer have to be sent to English hospitals for heart operations in a bid to shorten the waiting list. </p><p> <#> The new surgeon is Dr Gianfranco Campalani from Ferrara in Italy. <#> He has also worked at leading UK hospitals including Guys in London and Harefield in Middlesex where he was part of the transplant team headed by Dr Magdi Yacoub. </p><h> <#> Patients </h><p> <#> Dr Connor Mulholland, director of the Royal 's cardiology unit, said that up to 1,100 heart operations could now be performed annually at the hospital. </p><p> <#> Upgrading of surgical wards is to undertaken to handle the increased throughput of patients. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It means the long waiting lists for surgery and outpatients will be substantially shortened in the next few months," </quote> Dr Mulholland said. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Certain patients will now spend less time in hospital before their surgery is carried out" </quote> . </p></I><I><W2C-006$H><h> <#> Arson bid probe </h><p> <#> Police in Lisburn are investigating an arson attempt at a house in Lemington Place in the town. </p><p> <#> The occupant returned home at 10.30 last night to find flammable liquid had been poured through the letterbox. </p><p> <#> Police said an attempt had been made to light it but no damage was caused. </p></I>
