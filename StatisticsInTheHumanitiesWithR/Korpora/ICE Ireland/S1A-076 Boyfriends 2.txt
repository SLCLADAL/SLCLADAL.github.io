Giving over the car <,> apartment everything and going off cheffing in Australia<ICE-IRE:S1A-076$A> <#> Ah fair play to him <#> He might as well do something of his own <,> you know what I mean rather than being in the pharmacy and you know working in there for the family and stuff<ICE-IRE:S1A-076$B> <#> And as well he 's kind of obliged to do all sorts of hours <#> <{1> <[1> And </[1> <,>
