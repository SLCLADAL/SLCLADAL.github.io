<W2D-019 Harmony report><I><W2D-019$A><h> <ul> <#> HARMONY ANNUAL REPORT 1989/90 </h><h> <#> 1 INTRODUCTION </ul> </h><p> <#> Another year has passed swiftly bringing us to A.G.M. time again, and also to present the Annual Report. <#> Both are a crucial part of any organisation. <#> The first is to discuss all matters relevant to the organisation, to make decisions and to plan and set targets for the future. <#> The second helps us see how we are doing. <#> Have we done all that we intended? <#> Have we reached our targets? <#> What were our activities during the year? <#> Both help us to progress as an organisation. <#> All of this presupposes that all members of Harmony take an active part. <#> So all members should be actively involved. <#> Actively involved means - coming to Harmony functions and meetings; helping to plan events; helping at events; expressing ideas and options and always keeping in touch with what is going on. </p><p> <#> What follows in the Annual Report is a chronological list of main events and a review of what Harmony did during 1989/90. <#> It is an attempt to give all members a comprehensive view of what the organisation is achieving from year to year. <#> At times it may seem that little is happening, but when you see everything that has happened listed it is clear that Harmony is very active and progressing rapidly towards achieving its goals. </p><p> <#> We may underestimate sometimes what we are capable of, and yet, reviewing the year makes it clear that once we are determined enough to achieve a certain target, we can do it. </p><&> list of names on committee </&><h> 2.2 <ul> <#> SUB-COMMITTEES: <#> LEGISLATION </ul> </h><p> <#> "RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN IRELAND -

REALITIES AND REMEDIES </ul> </h><p> <#> This Report was launched in Buswell 's Hotel by the Minister for Justice, Mr Ray Bourke, TD. <#> The D&/ail, Churches, Embassies and many other organisations throughout Ireland were well represented at this successful event. <#> Much media attention was attracted, leading to a number of new members. </p><p> <#> The Launch was held on 21 March, to mark the United Nations Day for the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. </p><#> <h> 3.8 <ul> <#> APRIL </ul> </h><h> <ul> <#> ZIMBABWEAN EVENING </ul> </h><p> <#> This was another highly popular evening. <#> The food was superb and the music and interesting craft display added to the atmosphere of general enjoyment for all those who attended. </p><h> <#> 3.9 <ul> <#> May </ul> </h><h> <ul> <#> PHILIPPINO EVENING </ul> </h><p> <#> An equally successful event. <#> The delicious food was sampled by a large number of people, accompanied by a background of well chosen music. </p><h> <#> 3.10 <ul> <#> JUNE </ul> </h><h> <ul> <#> THE GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR - PROJECT THEATRE </ul> </h><p> <#> We were invited by the Project Theatre management to use a performance of "The Government Inspector" as an opportunity to raise funds for Harmony. </p><p> <#> The British Ambassador, Sir Nicholas <*> ampersand </*> Lady Fenn, attended this event. <#> After the performance members of the Tara Arts Group mingled with the capacity audience at a wine reception. <#> The success of this reception was due in no small measure to the generosity of His Excellency, the Indian Ambassador and Gilbey 's of Ireland, who both donated the wine. </p><p> <#> A lot of organisation went into this successful venture, which proved Harmony 's capability in organising major cultural events. </p><h> <#> 3.11 <ul> <#> JULY </ul> </h><h> <ul> <#> NELSON MANDELA 'S VISIT </ul> </h><p> <#> Harmony was associated with Nelson Mandela 's visit to Ireland by contributing financially to the production of a commemorative brochure for the event. <#> Harmony, as an organisation, and its members, participated in this historic occasion by attending functions associated with the visit. </p><h> <ul> <#> FAMILY OUTING </ul> </h><p> <#> The Family Outing was again to Duckett 's Grove riding School. <#> This annual event is proving very popular. <#> Over seventy people, both adults and children, travelled to the venue in comfort on a coach provided by Harmony. </p><h> <#> 3.12 <ul> <#> OFFICE </ul> </h><p> <#> The office has now been decorated. <#> The generous donations of Hugh Forkan (who provided the paint) and Michael Doyle of Doyle 's Hotels (who provided the carpets) helped immeasurably to make this possible. </p><p> <#> We are not in a position to make the office more available to the members of Harmony. <#> So in 1990/91, it will be used for administration purposes, but also as a meeting place and resource centre for all who wish to avail of it. </p><p> <#> The hours of opening are to be announced at the AGM. </p><h> <#> 4 <ul> <#> REVIEW OF THE YEAR </ul> </h><h> <#> 4.1 <ul> <#> CAMPAIGN FOR LEGISLATION </ul> </h><p> <#> During the year Harmony kept up the pressure for the introduction of Race Relations and Anti-Discrimination Legislation especially in the launch of the Harmony Report <ul> Racial Discrimination in Ireland - Realities and Remedies </ul> </p><p> <#> The Minister for Justice and Spokespersons for Justice were contacted in relation to this Report. <#> The Minister for Justice, Mr Ray Burke, TD launched the Report. <#> While we do not overestimate the significance of his attendance at the launch, we feel that it is a further step on the way to adequate race relations legislation in Ireland. <#> At least the Minister is now aware of the importance and necessity for this legislation. </p><p> <#> The pressure to have such legislation introduced must be maintained on the Minister and his Department. </p><h> <#> 4.2 <ul> <#> MEDIA WATCH </ul> </h><p> <#> Each issues of the Newsletter contains a Media Watch. <#> The following is a selection of Media Watch items:<p> <#> Gardai are hunting two vicious attackers who threw acid in the face of an Indian businessman in Dublin causing serious burns. <#> IRISH PRESS 11.10.89 </p><p> <#> Two English brothers hurled racist abuse at an Indian woman during an affray at a Dublin take-away. <#> They shouted remarks about the owner 's colour and racial background. <#> They threw things round the shop and grabbed her arm. <#> They were later arrested. <#> Both were found guilty and ordered to pay <*> pound sign </*> 40.00 and to leave the country immediately. <#> IRISH PRESS 19.9.89 </p><p> <#> A group of Hong Kong businessmen propose to invest up to <*> pound sign </*> 100m in the economy in return for State support and Irish Citizenship. <#> Government response has been lukewarm. <#> IRISH PRESS 18.12.89 </p><p> <#> The Minister for Education presented twelve Vietnamese students in Waterford with certificates having completed an English language course with local VEC. <#> Three children born to Vietnamese parents, already speak Vietnamese, Chinese, English and Irish. <#> WATERFORD NEWS & STAR 30.3.90 </p><p> <#> The son of a Jordanian Government Minister, failed his High Court bid to prevent <}> <-> deporation </-> <+> deportation </+> </}> from Ireland. <#> He is alleged to have arrived at Dublin Airport with valid visa, was refused entry and deported, because he did no have sufficient proof of financial resources. <#> IRISH PRESS 2.5.90 </p><p> <#> A Somalian who has been held in Limerick prison for the past seven weeks is to be put aboard a Moscow bound flight this evening - despite his claim that he will be shot if sent home. <#> IRISH PRESS 4.7.90 </p><p> <#> We continue to monitor racist incidents reported in the media. </p><#> 4.3 <h> <ul> <#> PUBLICITY </ul> </h><p> <#> Harmony received a high level of publicity in all sections of the media during the year. <#> This was due in a large measure to the successful launch of our Report. </p><p> <#> This media attention resulted in many members of the Committee being interviewed on radio and television, and in the newspapers. <#> We believe, as a result, that many people 's awareness of the existence of Harmony and its objectives, is now higher. <#> This new level of interest has been demonstrated by the many enquiries and new members in the aftermath of the launch. <#> We hope that in 1991 that we <}> <-> we </-> </}> will be able to maintain this increased support for Harmony. </p><h> <#> 4.4 <ul> <#> FUNDING </ul> </h><p> <#> 1989/90 was a very successful year for our fund raising campaign. <#> Grants were received from One World - Our World Committee and the Irish Youth Foundation. </p><p> <#> Some of our social/cultural evenings, while not specifically fund raising events yielded a very welcome profit. </p><p> <#> Letters were also sent to businesses in various parts of the country, and have resulted in an injection of funds. </p><h> <#> 5 <ul> <#> OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK </ul> </h><p> <#> As this Annual Report demonstrates, Harmony has been strengthened and has become more established in the past year. <#> The Committee has been exceptionally active, and the Sub-Committees put a lot of energy into organising events in areas of - legislation, social/cultural, fund raising and Newsletter. </p><p> <#> Now that the office is fit for habitation, it is time to seek funding to enable us to employ staff. </p><p> <#> Because of racist incidents both in Ireland and globally, the contributions of an organisation like Harmony are invaluable. <#> Further commitment and involvement from both the Committee and Members is imperative for the coming year, to enable us to work together and continue building bridges towards a racism free Ireland. </p><h> <#> 6 <ul> <#> CONCLUSION </ul> </h><p> <#> In conclusion Harmony wishes to thank the many people and organisations who supported us in our aims and participated in our events and campaign for legislation. </p><p> <#> We wish to thank those organisations and individuals who generously contributed financially to Harmony. </p><p> <#> To all those members who helped in the organisation of events, to those who donated prizes for raffles and to those who supported each other in the true spirit of HARMONY - a special thanks. </p></I>
