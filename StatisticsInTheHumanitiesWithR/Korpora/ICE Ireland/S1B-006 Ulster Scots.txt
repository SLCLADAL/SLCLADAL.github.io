<ICE-IRE:S1B-006 Ulster Scots><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Or did you have any quibbles with the way the way that they were said or the way they 'd be pronounced<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> No <#> I just I just didn't actually understand some of it and I didn't actually realise what they were using the word for <#> Some of the words I 'd never heard of <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Were there any words in particular that leapt out at you that you thought <,> Oh<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Not in that chapter because I didn't do it <#> But in the next chapter <,> the nouns chapter I did that and about half a dozen of the words which you 'd use a lot like man and son and it was used in the same context as they use them as the in the examples<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Next page like <,> drop mouthful plenty <#> And then the top of page twenty-three the <,> none of that made sense to me at all <#> I 'd never heard of half of that stuff <#> There 's a <.> lo </.> lot of stuff that sort of sounds quite familiar but that 's about it<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Did anybody else do the chapter on nouns<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$C> <X>> <#> Well I kind of did but I mean it didn't sound familiar to our kind of names so <,> I don't think it 's going to be a really useful <,> uh uhm well I don't think it 's going to be of any use <#> Uhm you recognise names or different things compared to English but the rest is just Chinese to me </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Did everybody notice a dictionary at the back <&> laughter </&> <#> It took me a while to work that out <,,> <#> So so far the words are near enough what we would use here apart from<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Some of them some of them <#> Some of them you just recognise them because you might be familiar with the Scottish dialect as well <#> But there is definitely words there that we would use yeah <,> in everyday speech<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> But do you think there have been some of them that have been in the uhm you know have been in the vocabulary but they 've dropped out <#> You know what I mean more rural<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Oh I know what I know what you mean but I <.> cou </.> I couldn't I couldn't answer the question <#> Haven't a clue <#> Maybe <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Well for example see the expressions in the nouns <,> would you use any of them <#> Or are they are they just<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Where are you <#> What page are you<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Uh page twenty-four <,> <#> There that <,> it 's that starts after certain nouns and then gives examples<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> I would use the ones at the bottom there <,> saying at the at the stair foot and stuff like that there definitely used them before yeah <#> But <,> not very often <#> And the last one there 's a place under that called Waterfoot <#> I don't know if that 's anything to do with it or not <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> And what about the plurals <#> Would anybody use any of them <,,> <#> Are they just totally<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Och no no <#> Some of them you would <#> Like you would use <,> if you 're describing a number of miles in the plural you would sometimes just say it in the singular <#> Say something 's thirty mile away instead of saying it 's thirty miles away in Donegal <#> And it 's the same with years <#> You know sometimes you would express a a number of years and just say year at the end of it <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> We 'll move on to the next chapter <#> Uhm pronouns <#> Did anybody do pronouns <,> <#> No<&> later </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> What about the demonstrative pronouns <#> Does everybody use them <#> I think they 're near enough pretty universal in Northern Ireland anyway<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> It 's just it 's just a different pronunciation with the same words that we would use<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mhm <#> Aye some of the spellings are a bit confusing <#> It took me a while to work out what they were trying to trying to get at <,> <#> I 'm looking at the reflexive pronouns <#> They 're really <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> too<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Aye we would use ourselves and yourselves and stuff like that there<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mhm <,> <#> And indefinite pronouns <#> I know some of them are definitely used in County Antrim <#> Like we <.> u </.> we uh you know uhm down kind of Down direction but uhm like there 's fellas I know and they talk about a a body <,> as in a person but we wouldn't we wouldn't say that<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> I 've heard it I 've heard it <#> I wouldn't ever use it myself <#> Or none of my immediate relations or friends would use that but <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> That 's probably a bit of a more old-fashioned thing actually<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Aye it 's maybe just more rural areas <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <,> <#> Did anybody do the adjectives chapter <,,> <#> I think quite a few of these I wouldn't use myself <#> Don't know about anybody else but uhm it was it nearly took me to the bottom of page thirty-seven before I found something I would say myself<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$D> <#> If you 'd maybe give examples those of you who agree or you know uhm findings that you would say <,> maybe give examples of this for the benefit of the international students who I 'm sure <,> I 'm sure it 's not very familiar to them <#> So <,> maybe that example Jessie at the bottom of page thirty-seven you were talking about<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Well it 's uhm <,> <quote> It 's an ill burd that fyles its ain nest </quote> <#> I 'll <,> we 'd use that sort of general <,> generally<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$D> <#> Meaning bad<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mhm<&> later </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> What about the numerals on page forty-four <#> Does anybody use them <,,> <#> Cos I know we would use a few of them but we wouldn't <.> u </.> necessarily use all of them <#> Like we would say <mention> nocht </mention> instead of <mention> nought </mention> <#> Or yin or twa <#> And then the rest of them 's near enough the same <#> But then you get to a hunder and a thousan you 'd take the<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Don't really get the <,> see like the nocht and the yin and the twa <,> we don't we don't really use them <#> Like there 's places right about Antrim they would use that like Rathlin Island and stuff like that but I would never use them<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> No we wouldn't necessarily use them all the time but it 's just <,> you know <,> I don't know say there was Kit-Kats in the fridge or something and there was a packet of them and you went there and somebody said how many 's and you 'd say oh just just the yin left <,> <#> Would you <,> would youse use <mention> aye </mention> instead of <mention> always </mention> <,> <#> Or does everybody use the standard English form <,,> <#> Will we go on to the next chapter <#> Did anybody do verbal forms<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$D> <#> By do do you mean read or do you mean<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Uh no read over it or <{> <[> look at or </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$D> <#> <[> That 's what I 'm a </[> </{> <,> that 's what I asked you to do just to look at<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mhm <,> <#> I thought they were pretty straightforward to tell you the truth <#> They were <,> there was nothing new<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> It was all quite basic yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Will we move on then<&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Adverbs I thought were pretty<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$E> <#> What page is that on<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Sorry uh <#> Seventy-three <#> I thought they were pretty straightforward as well <#> Bar a few of them like<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$F> <#> Did you read the whole book<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> I just just happened to <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> <,> I 'm reading it as I go along and then I did adverbs and <,> whatever the next one is <#> Conjunctions <#> I did those<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> I did conjunctions as well cos it was the shortest chapter<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> <&> laughs </&> Well I thought I deserved doing a shorter chapter for adverbs was pretty long<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> What 's the craic with adverbs then <#> What 's going on in there<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> What 's going on with the adverbs<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Och the adverbs they 're straightforward enough <#> Like we would use them every day <#> There 's only a whein that we wouldn't use<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Only a whein<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$B> <#> Only a whein<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#>

Uh-huh<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> <quote> That wund is byordnar snell </quote> <#> I didn't get it at all <#> I think I looked looked it up in the dictionary like but I wouldn't use it<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$E> <#> Has it got something to do with smell or something<ICE-IRE:S1B-006$A> <#> Aye it 's supposed to be unusual <#> But <,> uh seventy-seven <#> The rest of it was <,> pretty straightforward I thought <,,> <#> What about the idiomatic expressions on eighty-one <#> Anybody recognise them or use them or think they were strange or <,,> <#> The only one I think I didn't get was <quote> like the bars o Ayr </quote> <#> We wouldn't use that <#> That 's a Scoticism because Ayr 's in Scotland <,> but we 'd probably use something different <#> And one I couldn't get <,> I
