<W2C-007 Belfast Telegraph 6><I><W2C-007$A><h> <#> Loyalist killings overshadow Anglo-Irish talks. <#> Political Staff </h><p> <bold> <#> The shadow of loyalist paramilitary killings today hung over the latest Anglo-Irish talks in London as Ministers struggled to chart a fresh path to political talks. </bold> </p><p> <#> Security was top of the agenda for the meeting, with the Irish Government demanding further information on the threat of loyalist bomb-attacks in the Republic. </p><p> <#> Both Governments regard the current upsurge in loyalist murders as an urgent incentive to get the political parties back around the negotiating table. </p><p> <#> The urgency of the issue was marked by the presence of Stormont Security Minister Sir John Wheeler, who broke off his holiday to join his Dublin counterpart, Justice Minister Maire Geoghagan-Quinn, for the talks. </p><p> <#> RUC Chief Constable Sir Hugh Annesley, whose warning of the threat of loyalist bomb-attacks in the Republic has alarmed Dublin, and Garda Commissioner Patrick Culligan were also present. </p><p> <#> Speaking before the meeting - which began almost an hour late after the Irish party 's flight from Dublin was delayed - Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew spoke of the concern, felt in both London and Dublin, about the upsurge in violence. </p><p> <#> Sir Patrick, welcoming Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, rejected suggestions that relations between both Governments had been at a low ebb after their last talks in July and stressed that both were treating the worsening security situation <quote> "very seriously" </quote> . </p><p> <#> Speaking before the meeting, he also made clear that, despite a negative public stance by some parties, there were still good grounds for a resumption of the dialogue. </p><p> <#> However, the official message belied private concern that the prospects for fresh talks have worsened since the last Anglo-Irish meeting in July. </p><p> <#> Sources predicted that there would be no sign of the frostiness which greeted Mr Spring 's suggestion, in a Guardian interview in July, that both Governments might have to bypass the parties and aim for joint rule. </p><p> <#> However, there was expected to be friction between Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and Sir Hugh Annesley about the warning of loyalist attacks in the Republic. </p><p> <#> Mr Reynolds said he was <quote> "disturbed" </quote> by the content of what Sir Hugh said on Wednesday and rebuked him for <quote> "going public" </quote> . </p></I><I><W2C-007$B><h> <#> Bomb woman is jailed. <#> Rosie Cowan </h><h> <#> Murder mission: 'Mata Hari-type' actress sentenced to twenty years </h><p> <#> Terrorist Rosena Brown smiled and waved to family and friends amid shouts of republican slogans as she was jailed for twenty years at Belfast Crown Court today for her part in a murder mission. </p><p> <#> The court heard the double life of the actress and mother of seven from Bunbeg Park in west Belfast, came to an end when she was caught red-handed driving a car with a bomb in it outside Larne on April eighteenth last year. </p><p> <#> Brown was named in court in nineteen ninety as the Mata Hari-type IRA spy who seduced prison officer John Hanna into setting up colleague Brian Armour to be murdered. </p><h> <#> Conspiracy </h><p> <#> An RUC Special Branch officer told Hanna 's trial that police considered recruiting as a double agent Brown, who starred in a NIO 'Crack Crime' advert. </p><p> <#> Today, co-accused Paul McCullough (thirty) of Glenalina Road, and twenty-one-year-old Stephen Canning, of Doon Road, who were in the car with Brown, also received twenty-year sentences. </p><p> <#> All three were found guilty of conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to cause an explosion and having a bomb with intent. </p><p> <#> Sentencing the trio to twenty years ' concurrent on each count, Lord Justice MacDermott said the under-car booby-trap device found in the glove compartment of the car was a <quote> "murderous weapon" </quote> and that they were guilty of <quote> "one of the gravest crimes" </quote> . </p><h> <#> Plagued </h><p> <#> The judge told the attractive blonde actress, who starred alongside pop singer Sinead O'Connor in the film Hush-A-Bye-Baby, that she would be an old woman before she was free. </p><p> <quote> <#> "At your age you should gave known better than to get involved in terrorism" </quote>, he said. <quote> <#> "For more than twenty years this province has been plagued by terrorism. </p><p> <#> The sensitivity of everyone has been dulled by repetition but it doesn't mean the activities of terrorists will be tolerated. <#> All right-thinking people abhor such activity" </quote> . </p><h> <#> Wig </h><p> <#> Earlier, the court had heard how Brown pulled a white hat from her head, dislodging a ginger wig, when the car she was driving was stopped by police, on the Upper Cairncastle Road, outside Larne. </p><p> <#> Apart from giving their names and addresses, the trio refused to answer the police 's questions. </p><p> <#> When the mercury tilt switch device was discovered in the glove compartment, Canning told the RUC: <quote> "It 's all right, you 're safe, it 's not primed" </quote>. </p><p> <#> The judge said the trio were obviously on their way to murder someone. </p><p> <#> He said they did not try to mitigate their actions by naming their intended target which would have shown <quote> "remorse and regret" </quote> . </p><p> <#> Brown, immaculate in a pale green suit and white blouse, sat bolt upright during the short hearing, smiling frequently. </p><p> <#> As she was led away she waved and shouted <quote> "God bless" </quote> to family and friends. </p><p> <#> McCullough gave a clenched fist salute and shouted a republican slogan, which was returned by several people in the public gallery. </p><p> <#> The defence counsel said Brown 's seven children were aged from thirteen to twenty-five at the time of her arrest and she had a promising career on stage and screen ahead of her. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Her life has been changed irrevocably" </quote>, said the barrister. <quote> <#> "She will spend many years in prison and when she is released she will have to remake her life as best she can" </quote>. </p></I><I><W2C-007$C><h> <#> 'Room for improvement' admission on weed worry <#> Gail Walker </h><p> <#> Weeds five feet high have turned many grassy areas in east Belfast Housing Executive estates into jungles, it was claimed today. </p><p> <#> DUP councillor Sammy Wilson said that for the second year running he had been swamped with complaints from local people who feel they are living in <quote> "eyesores" </quote> . </p><h> <#> View </h><p> <#> And today the Executive admitted it could do better when it came to grounds maintenance in that area of the city. </p><p> <quote> <#> "It is disgraceful. <#> The Executive obviously has a very serious problem when it comes to looking after these areas," </quote> said Mr Wilson. </p><p> <quote> <#> "One woman told me she used to have a great view from her window across a local park. <#> Now she can't see over the weeds. </p><p> <#> I have contacted the Executive on behalf of people many times and they have told me they will do something about it. </quote> </p><h> <#> Promises </h><p> <quote> <#> "On some sites I 've had at least four promises since May that work will be carried out. <#> I tell residents this but the work never happens. <#> It makes me look a liar." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Wilson said that last year the Executive had paid their own direct labour organisation to maintain open spaces <quote> "but they never cut grass or pulled a single weed." </quote> </p><p> <quote> <#> "They told me that this year they have employed a private contractor who is supposed to cut grass at least twice a month and weed once a month but it 's not happening," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> An Executive spokesman said: <quote> "The Executive realises there is room for improvement in the grounds maintenance services provided in east Belfast. </p><p> <#> We are actively pursuing the matter with the contractor employed on its behalf to carry out this work." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Wilson added: <quote> "When many of the developments were being built tenants associations and public representatives pointed out that publicly-owned areas were prone to vandalism but it was never envisaged they would be subject to such official neglect. </p><p> <#> Senior officials in the Executive have spoken a great deal and written much about delivering a quality service. <#> It is time they started delivering on their promise."

controversial league table, which shows how the leading UK campuses all perform on students ' failure and drop-out rates. </p><p> <#> Queen 's University came eighteenth out of a list of fifty-six United Kingdom institutions, while the University of Ulster emerged at number thirty-six. </p><h> <#> Crude </h><p> <#> The survey, published in Push, the University Students ' Handbook, showed that only a few percentage points separated both - 10.67pc for Queen 's and 13.71pc for the UU. </p><p> <#> It said that almost one in eight students fail exams or drop out, with Salford University hitting the bottom of the table at 26.4pc. </p><p> <#> Today, a Queen 's spokesman said the figures indicated their record was better than the national average. </p><p> <#> But, he said, they had been described by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals as <quote> "very crude and potentially misleading" </quote> . </p><p> <quote> <#> "People who fail to finish their course at university do so for all kinds of reasons and we at Queen 's have a large number of welfare procedures and means of assisting students to minimise the failure and drop-out rate," </quote> he added. </p><p> <#> The University of Ulster said they concentrated on success and not failure. </p><p> <#> A spokesman said in some courses they had very high pass rates, including 93 per cent in English and history and 91 per cent in education. </p><h> <#> Switched </h><p> <#> The university acknowledged that some technical subjects were more demanding, and new students could find difficulties. <#> But staff looked <quote> "very carefully" </quote> at problem areas and examiners were <quote> "more than happy" </quote> with their courses, he added. </p><p> <#> The national vice-chancellors committee claimed the table was misleading, as it did not include factors such as students who switched courses. </p><p> <#> Push editor Johnny Rich, said: <quote> "With flunk rates rising, it has never been more important for prospective students to get the best information when applying." </quote> </p><p> <#> He added: <quote> "Those universities who have consistently been more than mere degree factories can boast a greater level of success at the end of the day. </p><p> <#> These universities realise that when students choose a university, they are choosing more than a course." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-007$E><h> <#> Troops out, say four in ten English people </h><p> <#> Four out of ten people in England want the troops out of Northern Ireland, a new survey claimed today. </p><p> <#> The Gallup poll found that 39 per cent of those questioned wanted the British Army off the streets of the province. </p><p> <#> Only 35 per cent said the troops should remain. <#> The survey was based on a poll of 1,035 people for market information company Key Note. </p><p> <#> Although the support for the troops in Ulster was low, 59pc felt that UK armed forces should be employed to protect overseas territories such as the Falklands Islands. </p><p> <#> The findings are contained in a new <*> pound sign </*> 350 book entitled "UK Defence Industry". </p><p> <#> Other statistics include: </p><p> <#> 48 per cent of those questioned felt the armed forces were good value for money; </p><p> <#> 48 per cent believed British forces should be operating in Bosnia to help end the conflict; </p><p> <#> 34 per cent felt UK forces should be sent to support United Nations operations in Somalia; </p><p> <#> 51 per cent considered the UK 's action in the Gulf war justified; and </p><p> <#> 34 per cent thought national service should be reintroduced for men and women; </p><p> <#> The new reference book will be published next week and is expected to contain 150 pages of information on all aspects of the defence industry. </p></I><I><W2C-007$F><h> <#> Videotape of Warrington bomb suspects </h><p> <#> Police hunting IRA terrorists who murdered two boys and injured more than 50 people in the Warrington bombing today released video footage of two suspects. </p><p> <#> The black and white film was taken by a shop security camera just 20 minutes before two bombs ripped through the town 's packed shopping centre on March 20. </p><p> <#> It shows two men wearing gloves walking from the direction of the first explosion. <#> They appear to be veering out to cross the road towards the scene of the second blast. </p><h> <#> Questioned </h><p> <#> The camera was set up to cover the interior of the store, and the images of the men, filmed as they walked past on the pavement outside, are not clear. <#> Detectives investigating the explosions have questioned more than 10,000 people but have so far been unable to identify the two men and eliminate them from their inquiries. </p><h> <#> Bombers </h><p> <#> Three year-old Jonathan Ball died almost instantly in the second of the two explosions caused by a bomb hidden a litter bin. <#> Timothy Parry (12) suffered massive injuries and died five days later. </p><p> <#> Cheshire police stressed that they were not saying that the men pictured were the bombers. </p><p> <#> A spokesman said detectives hoped that if the suspects were not the terrorists they - or someone who recognised them - would come forward to eliminate them from the inquiry. </p></I>
