<ICE-IRE:S2A-060 Skiing><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> What we 'd like to achieve in block four <,> is a practical understanding of the use of the edge <#> How as it runs smoothly it controls our direction <,> and how friction against it gives us a good braking action <#> And we 'd like you to try a snow plough <#> It 's here you can develop your stance <,> and a good solid base to use the edge from<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> Side stepping uphill is just like walking sideways up a staircase facing the wall <#> If you feel yourself slipping sideways down the slope <,> push your knees in towards the slope as you step <#> This will give you a good platform to make your next step from <#> Place your poles below you <,> and use them for support as you turn around to face downhill <,> with your skis pointing in the direction you want to go <#> Relax and glide down the hill <#> Choose one with a gentle run out at the bottom <,> to bring you gradually to a standstill <#> If not then just step around as you did on the flat <,,> <#> Place your poles in the snow below you about shoulder width apart <,> with palms on top of your poles <,> and with straight arms <,> make a step turn to point down the hill <,> with your skis positioned between your poles <#> Remember to look ahead <,> and stay flexed as you glide down hill <,,><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> So far you 've been gliding straight downhill <#> We call this shussing <#> The next step is to learn to control your speed and stop when you want to <,> with a snow plough <,,><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> Set yourself up in a narrow snow plough <#> Check that you 're flexed at all the skiing joints <#> Notice <,> that you should be travelling slower than in the straight running position <#> A few metres down the slope push out the ski tails and sink down a little <,> pushing wider into a braking plough <#> Equalising your pressure will ensure that you don't drift to one side <,> <#> Sinking down into a wide plough gives greater braking <#> Experiment with your position and see what happens<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> Look at the team using their poles as markers to brake beside <#> Visualise on this <,> maybe try it yourself<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> There 's more to skiing than on-snow techniques <#> For a start you 'll give yourself a much better chance of progress if you 're prepared physically <#> If you don't have the strength and stamina to continue skiing then you 'll be wasting part of your precious holiday time<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> You need three areas of fitness <#> Aerobic <,> that 's lung capacity to process oxygen <,> and ensure the stamina to keep going <#> Strength <,> that being the muscle power to sustain the movements and postures required by skiing <,> and flexibility <,> an absolute must <,> both for avoiding injury and recovering from those near misses <,,> <#> Let 's just think about what you could work on right now <,> before you ever hit the slopes <#> Try to plan a simple routine that encompasses these three areas of fitness <#> Make a gentle start <,> unless you 're already quite fit by going for a walk <#> Rocky ground develops good balance and sharpens reactions whilst strengthening your ankles <#> If the ground is undulating <,> you will be working on all three areas <#> When you get to the ski resort the first adjustment your body will make aerobically is to the increased altitude <#> Your blood will set about producing more red corpuscles to help supply you with oxygen <#> The best advice is not to push yourself too hard on day one <,> <#> But for now why not think mountains and walk amongst the hills where the air is fresher <#> Look around and develop an awareness of your environment <#> There 's more to see than you realise <#> It 's good fun <,> and a great way of unwinding<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> Cycling provides an excellent aerobic preparation for skiing <,> and in addition it will improve leg strength and balance <#> But perhaps the best thing about getting out on your bike is that it is a non-weight bearing form of training that won't damage knees or other joints<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> Graduate to jogging which is a little more strenuous when you 've built up some stamina and strength during your walks and cycle rides <#> Take it all at your own pace <,,> <#> Jogging could become the base of your own creative ski exercise plan <,> using nothing more than a few obstacles to run in and out of <,> like a slalom off snow</I><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> There are a lot of elements to digest in block five <#> It slots together all the basic ingredients of using skis <,> a running edge <,> a turning edge <,> and a frictional braking edge <#> The side slip will be explained as a useful and necessary compromise whenever you can't let the skis run along their edges <,> and there will be more work on stance <,> seeing how the body follows the skis round the turn <,> not the skis following the body <#> Your main goal for this block is to get your skis to make turns as efficiently as possible <,> with a minimum of effort from you <,> getting the most out of the ski<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> To recap <,> we looked in block one at how the ski turns <#> In block two <,> we got used to our skis <#> Block three gave us a well balanced stance over the ski <#> Block four added the snow plough into the equation and put us well placed to use either of our turning edges <#> So now we need to add in the adjustment in stance and pressure <,> that the skier makes to trigger the turn <#> The snow plough turn gives you the very best chance to develop a good relationship between your centre of mass <,> that 's the hip area and the edge of the ski which is going to make the turn <#> Think of every turn as being part of the arc of a circle <#> You will hold an edge and control an edge if your centre of mass is towards the inside of the circle <#> The amount will vary according to the radius of the turn and your speed <,> and you should experiment with this <,> before you finish the block <#> To get your skis to carry you through a snow plough turn you need to stand <,> that is put most of your weight on the inside edge of one ski <#> If you stand on your left ski <,> you will turn right <,> <#> If you stand on your right ski <,> you will turn left <,> <#> In this illustration the red ball represents the centre of mass which is your hip area <#> Note the track that your hip takes relative to the ski in order to hold you well balanced on your ski 's inside edge <#> You will be standing on the inside edge <,> if your centre of mass is to the inside of your turning arc <#> The principle of holding an edge by keeping the hip to the inside of the turn <,> is the same for all turns as we 'll show you in block six <,> but <,> it 's easier to learn using the edge at the snow plough stage where <,> because of the V shape we make <,> our hips are already <,> inside the turn <,> whichever ski we press on <,> and at slower speeds we have the additional support of the non-turning ski <#> Groove this into your technique now <,> rather than trying to rush towards parallels <#> This building block <,> is perhaps the most important<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> Sometimes continuous turns won't give you the line you want <#> To track across the slope you need to learn the traverse<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> Face across the slope and look ahead <#> Your feet should be hip width apart <,> and your weight more on the downhill ski <#> If you had just finished a turn <,> this would be the ski you are standing on already <#> Your hips will be to the inside of the working ski <#> Carry your hands wide for balance <,> and always practise in both directions<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> The side slip is extremely useful whenever the skis cannot be allowed to run along their edges <#> Use it to scrub off speed <,> or to come slowly in a more direct line down the mountain<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> Advance your upper ski slightly <,> which lets you turn your upper body from the hips to face down the slope <#> Allow the knees to relax out <,> by rolling them downhill <#> Your skis will no longer be held on their edges <,> and will be flat enough to slide <#> The diagonal side slip <,> works on the same principle <#> Just look where you 're going <,> and be sure to focus shoulders waist and hips in that direction <,> releasing the edges to get a slide<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> Improve your snow plough turns by visualising on these demonstrations<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> Phew <,> in block six we 'd like to add a little variety to the radius of your turns <,> by improving your directional control and use of the edge <#> Your aim is to pick a route <,> select a place to turn <,> and adapt your turn to the radius you want to achieve <#> Let 's have a look at some wedge turns<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> A wedge turn is the result of refining your snow ploughs and controlling your radius <#> You will need to experiment with pressure <,> pressing harder and quicker on the turning ski shortens the radius <#> Pressing more gently lengthens the radius of the turn <#> Always think of locating the edge <,> then pressing smoothly <#> It 's simple <#> Change pressure <,> change direction <,,> <#> Notice <,> as the speed increases <,> how the non-turning ski tends to drift in towards the turning one <#> If you concentrate on the amount of pressure you are applying to the turning ski <,> you will find that <,> at a reasonable speed <,> the non-turning ski drifts in quite naturally <,> to what looks like a traverse position<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> No two turns are ever identical <#> One of the main variants is radius <#> Focus your attention on radius <,> in the next few turns<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> Remember <,> the quicker you locate the new turning edge and press in the middle <,> the quicker you will turn <#> The gentler you press <,> the longer the radius will be <,,><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> Now use this to complete your mental picture of wedge turns<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> The best way we 've found for getting the feeling of using the new edge as early as possible in each turn is to use a small step<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> A narrow step out with the ski which is going to make the next turn <,> gives you the best opportunity to find its inside edge as early as possible <#> Pressing early on the new turning edge gives a precise turn <,> with lots of control <#> Don't wait until you 've made a big traverse before starting each turn <#> Aim to let them flow together <,> transferring the pressure smoothly and rhythmically<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> Making a step turn like this <,> the turn develops smoothly and efficiently <#> Once started <,> your aim must be not to disrupt the turning process <#> Standing up for example <,> would flatten the skis<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> See how the ski is stepped out <,> into a narrow wedge <#> As the ski touches down <,> find its inside edge and press in the middle <#> Increasing the pressure on the new turning ski means decreasing the pressure on the other <#> The pressure that you apply to the inside edge <,> around the middle of the ski is <,> turning pressure <#> As the turn develops <,> encourage the inside ski to drift in <#> As you complete the arc <,> release the turning pressure by relaxing the ankle flex <#> Your height will increase slightly in this release phase <,> but don't think of standing up<ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> We 'll be doing more work on pole plant in the future <#> But for now let 's look at adding it in <,> to our step turn <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> voiceover </&> <#> A good pole plant won't throw your balance or disrupt your rhythm <,> but isn't necessary until you 're moving at a moderate pace <#> If used well <,> the pole plant is a good aid to getting rhythm into your turns <,> and helps to trigger a change of pressure to your new turning edge <#> Try to develop a natural timing for use of the pole <#> Develop a wrist only action <,> not letting your arms or shoulders get involved <#> Use your wrist to cock the pole forward as you lift the ski out into a step <#> The pole goes in <,> at the moment you start to press on the new ski <#> Make a gentle pole plant <,> and immediately lift the pole out again <,> with a forward and down wrist movement <#> Keep the upper body relaxed <,> and don't look down at your pole plant <#> Look ahead <#> Say to yourself <,> lift <,> plant and press <,,> <#> Lift <,> plant and press <,> <#> Lift <,> plant and press <,,><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> This visualisation on step turns should help your timing and rhythm<&> musical interlude </&><ICE-IRE:S2A-060$A> <&> to camera </&> <#> We 've told you heaps of things about skiing <,> but it should be said that perhaps the most important elements of your ski holiday are <,> safety <,> enjoyment and learning <,> in that order <#> Good skiing and see you soon</I>
