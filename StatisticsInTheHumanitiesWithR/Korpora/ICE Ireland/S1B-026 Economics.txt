<ICE-IRE:S1B-026 Economics><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> Uhm <,> Eamon Hanna uh <,> what did you make <.> o </.> <.> o </.> <.> o </.> of that <#> I mean your work with the Phoenix Trust <.> i </.> it 's all about uh <,> trying to get people back into work <#> Oh the family that was mentioned there the O'Neills you 'd come across a lot of people like that <#> Now what are you looking for this peace dividend <#> <.> Wha </.> what are you searching for<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$B> <#> I have come across a lot of Danny O'Neills in my time <#> People who <,> in other circumstances would would have very very good prospects facing them <#> Uh and there is an inescapable <,> difficulty here between <,> between <,> unemployment and segregation and the violence <#> But I think in west Belfast we have had this unemployment <,> which has long pre-dated the Troubles <#> And in fact there has been bad governance there <,> and bad governance in the economic policies <,> which are running Northern Ireland for more than seventy years even pre-dating partition <#> And I think that we have to create a society which <,> while <,> if it gives equity it also has economic growth <#> And we have instead concentrated here in building up strong public sectors and really not giving enough decisions to people on the ground and especially not allowing a situation where private investment can come <.> t </.> can come in here <#> <.> W </.> we have a situation at the moment where about thirty-six percent of the population of Northern Ireland is in the public sector <#> That is a very unhealthy situation <#> <{> <[> I </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> <[> People </[> </{> have talked about a a dependency culture in some quarters <#> Do you think that exists<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$B> <#> I <.> do </.> I think people make rational decisions <#> I 'd be very very loath indeed to criticise people <#> Uhm I see a lot of pride and self-respect but I also see people on the streets in West Belfast who have never got a chance <,> to make a mark in life <#> And that is not always an accident <#> It is the circumstances and the structures of society which which uh which have actually created that condition for them <#> And those structures have to change<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> Martin Donegan the Research Centre 's uh prognosis was quite depressing <#> Uh <.> w </.> do you go along with that theory that maybe this peace dividend isn't all it 's cracked up to be<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$C> <#> Think the most important peace dividend we have had is that nobody 's getting killed <#> And I think in a sense depressing and all as this economic discussion is <,> it is still healthy to have it <#> And I 'm pleased to have it <#> I 'm sure the participants are <#> I believe it 's even worse than that <#> I mean Eamon touched on something which is very very important <#> We shouldn't give the people of Northern Ireland the impression that we may return to a golden age <#> There never was a golden age in Northern Ireland <#> Uh Eamon refers specifically to West Belfast but the decline in the old traditional industries has made meant that long-term massive unemployment has spread right across North Belfast right across all areas all religions <#> Uhm <,> if there 's one thing we must do is develop short medium long-term strategies <#> Graham is dealing with what is more of a medium-term situation <#> The short-term situation must be that the government must say number one <,> they will maintain public expenditure at whatever level is needed at whatever level is needed to secure the peace <#> Number two they must say that we will eradicate generation inter-generational long-term unemployment and we will do it now<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> That 's a very big phrase <mention> eradicate long-term unemployment </mention> <#> I mean they 've been trying to do that not just in Northern Ireland but in all sorts of other urban areas where the old industries have been in decline <#> What 've we got here that uh can can get us out of that syndrome do you think<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$C> <#> I think <,> I mean <,> the development authorities and the the development debate will take place and take place over a period of time <#> There is nothing wrong in I don't need a conservative MP from England sounding like an ideological foghorn across the Irish Sea <,> telling us that at this most important time in the history of this island <,> we have to behave like Thatcherites and ideologues <#> There 's nothing wrong with saying <,> we will expand something like Enterprise Ulster and we will absorb eight or nine thousand <.> p </.> unemployed people <#> I mean <,> do the people of <.> North </.> <.> th </.> Northern Ireland realise that half of the unemployed in Northern Ireland haven't had a job in over a year <#> There 's twenty thousand people haven't worked in over five years <#> I mean we need that stopped and <{> <[> stopped today </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> <[> <.> We </.> <.> we </.> </[> </{> were you referring there to <.> Ri </.> Richard Spring who 's now of course got this job as uh Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State <#> I mean he was saying that uh the the government pressure on departments to cut spending is irresistible <,> and there 's really nothing that can be done about it <#> And Northern Ireland 's budget 'll be cut just like anywhere else<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$C> <#> Northern Ireland is not the rest of the United Kingdom <#> It 's not <.> th </.> the rest of Europe <#> Northern Ireland has a <,> peculiar historical inheritance <,> and nobody can stand back and wash their hands like Pontius Pilate from it <#> I mean I firmly believe that what we should be saying as Mr Major said that a settlement eventually 'll be put to a referendum <#> If that is the case <,> then I think the projected levels of public expenditure should be an item in that referendum <#> And the <{> <[> people of </[> Northern Ireland should know that<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> <[> Okay </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> Graham Gudgin <.> w </.> we saw you in the film <#> Uh not really a very happy uh view of the future economically <#> And uh what struck me was that the downside items that you talked about like security budget being slashed it clearly will be if the peace sticks and yet <,> the good points such as tourism <,> or investment from multi-nationals a bit speculative really<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$D> <X> <#> Well of course any growth in the future and uh any future investment is speculative but it 's very likely to come <#> What 's speculative is really the the the amount and the size of new investment <#> I think it 's a great pity in many ways that uh the newspapers and and press coverage in Northern Ireland has concentrated on handouts and extra money particularly from America and Europe <,> uh and <.> the </.> these will be small <#> The real story here is the opportunity that Northern Ireland now has to grow fast uh particularly in tourism but in in manufacturing in inward investment <#> All these things will give us jobs but they 'll depend on on how well <{> <[> we grasp the opportunity </[> </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> <[> Yes <,> <#> How </[> </{> do we harness this opportunity without being <.> pump </.> primed or whatever the expression is by government money <#> And yet what you 're saying is what they say they 'll take away and they won't put back in again<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$D> <X> <#> Well it 's up to us <#> I mean there there there is money there <#> There 's plenty of money from from the government as there always has been in Northern Ireland and there will be for the next few years in the short-term at least <#> It 's then up to people in Northern Ireland to all of us <,> to grasp this opportunity <#> For instance if if Ronnie Scott 's forecast on tourism on extra tourist visitors to Northern Ireland are correct we 're going to need forty <.> la </.> extra additional large hotels uh over the next five to ten years <#> We 'll need lots of extra <.> gays </.> guest houses <#> We 'll need bed and breakfasts <#> We 'll need extra amenities for tourism <#> These are all opportunities for people ordinary people in Northern Ireland to make money <,> uh to invest their own money in these sorts of <.> fatil </.> in these sorts of facilities uh and to make </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> You 're getting almost cheerful here now<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$D> <X> <#> Well <,> <&> laughter </&> well it 's it 's not really a matter I think of optimism or pessimism <#> It 's it 's a matter of realism <#> I mean <.> o </.> one has to inject some realism into this debate because because there 's <.> o </.> obviously <{> <[> and understandably a good deal of hype </[> </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> <[> Right <,> that 's </[> </{> a nice point to take in Eamon Hanna realism <#> Now you 've just come back from United States of America <#> Uhm and uh you 've been closely involved with the work of the IDB in the past <{> <[> as well </[> <#> Uhm <,> what was the problem over there about getting Americans to invest here<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$B> <#> <[> Uh huh </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$B> <#> Well we were put into the into the lion 's den <#> Uh Joe Hendron and Reg Empey and Alistair McDonald and Des McVeigh uh we were put in with with some of the toughest Wall Street bankers we ever had <#> Tony O'Reilly put us into the bear-pit there <#> It became clear to us that <.> o </.> that our our array of industrial incentives the grant-based packages <,> is it 's become somewhat outmoded and we have pressed particularly for a change towards a ten percent corporation tax <#> The corporate tax take in Northern Ireland is about three hundred million a year which isn't too far off the security cost <#> I would like to see some of the peace dividend being applied to that because it is clear to us that we are not competitive say with with the Republic of Ireland in terms of attracting inward investment<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> <.> W </.> what where have they been scoring where we haven't been then<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$B> <#> Because they have been able to intract <&> attract </&> projects which are intrinsically more profitable and therefore the companies are able to keep a larger slice of their profits <#> Also here I think we have a very underdeveloped banking <,> and and venture capital and development capital industry <#> And I think banks have been very very risk averse <#> Uh I had gentleman over last week who was one of the boss in venture capital <,> uhm companies and people told him that there were no projects in Northern Ireland <#> He said to me my God <#> There are dozens of projects in Northern Ireland <#> And he actually went round those projects and found that these projects are not investable in because the financial structures uh and financing here are not here <#> You get pound for pound on grant packages but very often what a company that has got internationally tradable goods and services needs is more risk capital long-term capital<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> Martin Donegan the point that is often made 's we have uh a skilled workforce here we have uh a high level of uh <.> e </.> education uhm a a lot of plus points <,> surely when the Troubles uh uh are history we are going to be <,> on an on a new dawn aren't we <#> There there will be even if it 's just the sense of change which is so important that uh other areas of the world where they 've had decay for for many years maybe people 've <,> have almost given up <#> This has given a new sense of hope hasn't it<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$C> <#> Certainly <#> I think <,> we all feel that we can do it <#> We all feel that possibly the only hindrance has been the Troubles <#> That 's not quite true but when I look at a lot of manufacturing industry which I visit then daily and say we 've survived that <#> We can survive anything <#> We can go forward <#> One of the things that I do hope <,> we need to do is involve all the community in this restructuring <#> This restructuring is not about just the business community holding conferences <#> It 's not about the IFI <#> We must find a mechanism for involving business agriculture the trade unions the community groups to come up with the ideas to discuss what Eamon said and if necessary to ask for really radical fiscal policies like abolish the corporation taxes<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> But to tritely trot off this phrase peace dividend uh talk to a policeman maybe facing redundancy <.> o </.> or what have you <#> I mean uh it 's a complex situation we 're facing<ICE-IRE:S1B-026$D> <X> <#> Yes it is <#> And it 'll be patchy across Northern Ireland <#> And some towns some localities in Northern Ireland aren't going to do very well out of this but uh others others will do well <#> But the province as a whole as I was saying earlier have have opportunities <#> But I 'd like to return to the point Martin Donegan was making earlier uh about long-term unemployment <#> That whatever happens to the economy we are going to have these fifty thousand people who are going to have grave difficulty getting in to taking advantage of these opportunities <#> And that 's a single area where I think government ought to do something and where if we are going to get money from outside from say Brussels uh I 'd like to see it concentrated on on those people <{> <[> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </[> </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-026$A> <#> <[> That 's peanuts </[> </{> compared as as we pointed out so clearly there to the three thousand million we 're getting every year now from Britain</I>
