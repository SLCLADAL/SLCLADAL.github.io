<ICE-IRE:S1B-049 M O Suilleabhain><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> And the the music you make <,> I just <,> <.> cont </.> uh <.> c </.> contrasting your music with your your teacher 's <,> Sea/n O/ Riada<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> It seems to me now you 're making a different kind of a statement with your music <#> He was talking about <,> it seems to me <,> the nation <#> You 're talking about the spirit <,> more <#> You have a wider perspective <#> So I can see that in the music <,> you 're you 're <,> you 're more European than he was <,> you 've advanced <#> Would would I be right in that<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Well I I 'm not sure it is <#> Uhm I I think the age that <,> well I mean the eighties has been <,> has funnily enough <,> you know <,> some of my music when 'twas released in America got put on the New Age rack <#> And I was <.> on a </.> once asked by somebody was I insulted at this <#> I 'm not really <#> Do you know I mean most of the New Age stuff one sees is really like horrible <#> Uh uh <,> but but I 'm not really <#> But but there is <,> there is something of the times that if one <,> expresses <,> a time that one lives in and the time we live in now is uh <,> is actually a searching by all kinds of people for the spirit<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> And if for many people uh institutionalised religion has soured for them <,> or for some reason or another <,> I think <,> that they feel for whatever reason they need to go beyond it or <,> beneath it or <,> beside it <,> uhm it 's a time like that and there 's a there is a lot of that I think <,> of that timelessness in music right now <#> But I do believe music is political <#> I do believe that all music all true music <,> is political <#> I do think it 's a political statement because it 's a it 's a statement of where you are <,> at a particular point of time <#> And I strongly believe that <#> I mean <,> okay it 's easy to see particularly in <,> like nationalistic music <{> <[> you know </[> <#> And if you pick for example you mentioned O/ Riada if you pick an obvious one there Mise E/ire<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Okay you associate it with the images of the film Mise E/ire and all of that and the <unclear> words </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Well it 's not only the images <#> The very <{> <[> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> personality of it </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> <[> Yes yes </[> </{> absolutely agree <#> If it were just the music on its own you still would <{> <[> feel that </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> You 'd say </[> </{> that 's Ireland<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Yeah that 's Ireland <#> That 's right <#> And it 's uh that particular kind of feeling about Ireland <,> you know which <.> o </.> one be <{> <[> describe it as cultural nationalist <,> <#> I </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> You you <,> it 's </[> </{> also about Ireland<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Well it is about Ireland but you know it 's the time <#> The time is you we we cannot uh afford <,> to relax into that comfortable feeling of culture and nationalism anymore<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> And I 'm you know like <,> uh <,> I would feel part of a generation <,> which was uh at the uh <,> at the cutting edge but certainly we were the first ones to bang into the wall of the problem of globalisation and global culture<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> And I think rather than resisting this <,> uhm I think we should help it along <#> I think we should actively <,> seek <,> uhm you know that that concept of the human family as a as a global family <#> Now where nationalism goes in the middle of all of that I don't know <#> I don't think it need be thrown out but it 's a kind of a post-nationalism <,> in a way <,> that 's the way I would describe it<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Because there are European <,> American influences in your music at least <,> so it seems to me<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Oh there 's no question about that you <{> <[> know </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> Jazz </[> </{> for instance <{> <[> and <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> <[> Absolutely very much <,> <#> Absolutely </[> </{> and the piano of course is a very cosmopolitan <,> suave instrument <{> <[> you know </[> <,> <#> And to play it with uh <,> to play Irish music on it <,> you know it 's a bit like <,> you know playing it with wellingtons on or something <,> do you know <&> laughter </&> <#> Uh that <,> I mean <,> like there is that <.> el </.> I remember a reviewer once in a UK magazine <,> uh said that uh when he heard the record I had done said it sounded like a pint of Guinness was pouring into the piano <&> laughter </&> <#> And that was a bit mean <#> But <,> there is an Irishness and the Irishness for me in the music <,> piano music I play is like an anchor <,> a vital anchor<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> Mm mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> I don't want to leave go of it because if I feel I do <,> in the context of this globalisation <,> well I 'm out to sea <&> laughter </&> <#> With no <.> s </.> uh and no compass <,> no sense of where I am <#> So I do believe in roots <,,><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> You 're searching in your <#> I remember uh in the Oilea/n Suite the <{1> <[1> Suite Oilea/n </[1> you <,> uh put on top of one the pieces a quotation of Nuala Ni/ Dho/mhnaill 's for instance <#> <{2> </[2> Uh </[2> <&Irish> Oilea/n 'se/ mo chorp oilea/n mar i muire </&Irish> <#> My body <,> is an island in the midst of a vast sea <#> And uh <,> a lot of your music seems to be <,> have a kind of a melancholy about the human condition <#> And it 's uh otherwise its joyful but there 's a melancholia uh going through <,> it 's in the searching <#> Am I wrong in that<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> <[2> Ah <,> yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Uh I I I think that 's true <,> <#> Ah no I really think it 's true <#> I remember somebody describing to me once uh saying <,> uhm <,> that uhm one of <,> the human being 's most pleasant feelings <,> is the one of sweet sadness <#> You know that <{> <[> combination </[> of the two <#> And that <,> there 's a <.> m </.> uh a melancholic thing about that <#> There 's also a nostalgic thing <#> There 's a feeling of <,> being somewhere other than where you should be and you want to be there<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> Mm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> And all of that kind of feeling <#> Music is a wonderful way of of expressing that <,> <#> Uh so <,> you know there 's a wonderful word too in Irish <,> <&Irish> uaigneas </&Irish> <#> That 's uh uh people say it 's very difficult to translate <,> into English <#> Loneliness is too blunt a word<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> And <&Irish> uaigneas </&Irish> <,> is something that uh some of us would claim you can hear <,> even in certain players playing fast music <,> a reel which is supposed to be joyous <,> but it 's tinged in some way or other <,> with this colour of <&Irish> uaigneas </&Irish><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Mm <,> like the music of Tommy Potts <#> He was admired so much on the fiddle<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Potts <,> yes that 's a wonderful example <#> I I was just talking to students about that today <#> And <,> I mean there was a passionate and spiritual man you know <#> And his music is just uh shot through with with spirit <,> in a most wonderful way<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Are you a <.> re </.> religious individual would you say<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Uhm I 'm <,,> <{> <[> uhm uhm </[> yes <#> Uh no I would think yes <#> Yes in the sense that I would pray <,> uh in the sense that I couldn't imagine <,> life without a belief in a loving God <#> You know it just doesn't make sense to me <#> So yes I am religious <#> In that sense I suppose I 'm very religious <,> but not necessarily in an institutionalised sense <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> Belief in God </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> It always seems to me that the very fact of music <,> is one of the proofs of the existence of God<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Well I mean you know I I certainly 'd be the last person to argue against that <#> On the other hand <,,> I think I can imagine a good musician who said he was <,> an atheist <,> <#> Oh yes <#> You know uh which doesn't necessarily prove that God doesn't exist either <#> I mean he may be his own <,> proof of the it he 's the validity of his own argument <#> <{> <[> Do you know <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> <.> I </.> <.> I </.> <.> I </.> </[> </{> that people people can write music and appreciate it both seems to me to be a suggestion that there is something more to the human being <,> uh than <,> we can perceive <#> <{> <[> You know </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> <[> Well you </[> </{> know when you really come up against it <#> It 's when you bring art into the market place <#> You know that 's where the sparks fly you see <,> because if there is spirit in it and you <,> <{> <[> there 's <,> one thing you can't sell it 's that of course even </[> if you know it 's there<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> Yeah <,> yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> It 's just unsaleable<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yeah but you 've brought it into the market place<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Yes I know <#> I suppose that 's why I 'm saying it because in a way I 'm speaking to some degree from experience <#> Luckily <,> not too much into the market as I haven't been faced with <,> certain problems which would obviously come up if you begin to do that <#> But I have my toes have dipped into the water <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> <#> <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yes and uh some of your stuff it seems to me even <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is <,> uh you could sell that as a single <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Yeah uh funnily enough it was supposed to 've come out as a single <#> <{> <[> As it is </[> it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra <#> But <,> yeah it has it has it it does <#> You know I don't deliberately write music which is potentially popular <,> but some of the music I would write or or or work out <,> on the keyboard or otherwise <,> happens to be in the realms of popularity <#> You know I am fortunate or unfortunate whatever way you want to look at it <,> uh to actually be dealing with those materials of sound <#> I have friends who <,> who work <,> exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible <,> for <,> you know ninety-nine percent of the people <#> You know when I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Like<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Well I 'm I 'm thinking actually of an Irish composer called Gerald Barry <,> in particular <,> who is a Clare man and who lives in Dublin and who wrote <,> spent ten years of his life writing an opera <,> called The Intelligence Park which got its premiere in London and Dublin <,> this summer <,> <#> And uh he 's a friend of mine and <,> he sent me on a a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to <,> <#> And I think it 's extremely complex music <#> I I couldn't ask <,> most of my friends to listen to it <#> You know <,> I know they would have a huge problem <,> <#> But I mean I myself am full of admiration uh for it <#> But what I 'm saying is that somebody like him and many others work uh with materials of sound which are all fanatically not popular <#> I mean let me tell you that these are not popular <&> laughter </&> under any circumstances<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> No tunes<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Any any market place <#> You <.> kn </.> <,> know in that sense no tunes or <,> you know uhm no<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Do you think a melody should have tunes or<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> No I don't think so <#> No <#> I I really I I I don't necessarily think so <,> <#> I I think it 's possible to have <,> yeah I think it 's possible to have music without <,> without <{> <[> tunes </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> All </[> </{> your <.> mu </.> music has<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Oh very yes it 's very melodic <#> Yeah <{> <[> there 's no </[> question about that yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Do you think it shouldn't be or <,> are you striving to go <,> beyond the melody<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> I 'm striving to go yes I 'm <.> striv </.> no not so much beyond I I would I am <&> sighs </&> what I do in music seems to be increasingly as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality <#> And to me music is <,> a sound that you send out a bit like a scout <,> to check <,> the ground <,> and to clear the overgrowth <,> and then you enter into the space <#> It seems to me that when I write music which is worth writing it 's ahead of me <#> And there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you <,> you see<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> This is a very complex statement<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> Well well I don't know <#> I mean it 's thinking that music uh is simply uh can be ahead of a person and ahead of society<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$A> <#> Yeah that 's something that a painter said to me the other day that when he starts off <,> with a brush loaded with paint and confronts a canvas he doesn't quite know what he 's going <{> <[> to <,> do </[> <#> He hopes <,,> that he <,> starts off very simply <,> and hopes that he can elaborate <,> that something will appear<ICE-IRE:S1B-049$B> <#> <[> Yeah yeah </[> </{></I>
