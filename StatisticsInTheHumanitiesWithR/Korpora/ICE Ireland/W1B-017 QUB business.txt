<W1B-017 QUB business><I><W1B-017$A><h> <#> 01 May 1998 <#> Dear Colleague <#> <bold> FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN IRELAND) ACT 1989 (as amended) </bold> </h><p> <#> You may be aware that the University is required by the above Act under the Fair Employment (Monitoring) Regulations (NI) 1989, to monitor the perceived religious affiliation or community background of both its employees and applicants for employment, in order to make an annual monitoring return to the Fair Employment Commission. </p><p> <#> In the past, the University has used the 'first schools ' method as its principal means of determining the community background of employees and applicants to the organisation. <#> This process was slow, inefficient and increasingly inaccurate relying on an outdated primary schools directory produced by the Department of Economic Development. </p><p> <#> In February 1998, the University changed its method of monitoring to the 'direct question', asking applicants whether they belong to the Protestant community, the Roman Catholic community or neither. <#> This had an immediate effect on the efficiency of the monitoring process. </p><p> <#> However, in changing the principal monitoring method, the University is required to re-survey those members of staff for whom no determination of community background has been made. <#> Previously, employees who stated that they received their primary school education outside Northern Ireland and for whom no determination of community background was made, were included in the University 's statutory monitoring return as <quote> 'nondetermined' </quote> and referred to within the University as <quote> 'Non Northern Ireland' </quote> or <quote> 'XNI' </quote>. <#> The 'Residuary Method' was not used as a method of trying to <quote> 'perceive' </quote> the religious affiliation/community background of such employees. </quote> </p><p> <#> Under the terms of the Fair Employment (Monitoring) Regulations (NI) 1989, a resurvey of staff previously categorised as <quote> 'Non Northern Ireland' </quote> is required to ensure that their details are included in the Monitoring Return. <#> Upon receipt of completed forms, staff taking part in this re-survey will be advised to the amended information held on the monitoring system and will be given the opportunity to correct this is required. <#> Where information is not supplied, the Residuary Method will be used to make a determination (where possible) and staff will also be given the opportunity to amend this, if required. </p><p> <#> This exercise is a legal requirement placed on the University and I request your co-operation and assistance in complying with it. <#> It should be noted that it is not envisaged that the overall profile of the University in terms of the community background of its staff will change significantly as a result of this re-survey. </p><p> <#> Any information you provide will be treated with the strictest levels of confidentiality and will only be used to produce statistical summaries where the identities of individuals will not appear. <bold> <#> The information will not be available for any purpose other than Equal Opportunities Monitoring. </bold> </p><p> <#> I would be grateful if you would complete the enclosed re-survey form and return it to this office on or before <bold> TUESDAY 12 MAY 1998. </bold> <#> I have enclosed a reply envelope for your convenience. </p><p> <#> If you have any queries about this re-survey, please do not hesitate to contact this office at extension 3039/5139 </p><p> <#> Thanking you in anticipation of your co-operation in this re-survey exercise. </p><p> <#> Yours faithfully <#> <&> signature </&> <#> Paul Browne <#> Equal Opportunities

March 1998 <#> Ref: M2-98/ld/c </h><p> <#> The Queen 's University of Belfast is committed to equality of opportunity for all its employees. <#> The aim of the University 's Equal Opportunities Policy is to ensure that no person by reason of religious belief, political opinion, sex, marital status, race, colour, ethnic origin or disability is treated less favourably nor is disadvantaged for those reason by conditions or requirements which cannot be justified. </p><p> <#> In order to ensure that the aims of this policy are achieved, the Unit needs you assistance as it is essential that the monitoring information held is up-to-date and accurate. <#> It is now necessary to survey employees to update this information. <#> The enclosed questionnaire is being issued to give all staff an opportunity to update their record and amend this information where changes have occurred. </p><p> <#> I appreciate that you may have already completed a similar questionnaire at some stage, but the completion of this questionnaire is vital to the University in progressing its Equal Opportunities Policy and I would encourage you to contribute to this exercise. </p><p> <#> The aim of this questionnaire is to update the following information: <#> Postcode: To allow for the analysis of catchment areas. </p><p> <#> Marital Status: To update information currently held on marital status. </p><p> <#> Ethnic Origin: To comply with the University 's commitment to monitor on the grounds of race and to follow best practice as advocated by the Commission for Racial Equality for Northern Ireland (appointed following the introduction of the Race Relations (N.I.) Order 1997). </p><p> <#> Disability: To comply with the University 's commitment to monitor on the grounds of disability and to comply with best practice as advocated by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. </p><p> <#> Note: <#> The section on Disability contains <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> outline of the definition under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the types of disabilities which are covered b the Act. <#> If you have a disability, this section will also give you the opportunity to make suggestions as to what steps the University might take to help you in carrying out your duties. </p><p> <#> All the information you provide will be treated with the strictest levels ofconfidentiality and will only be used to produce statistical summaries where theidentities of individuals will not appear. <bold> <#> The information will not beavailable for any purpose other than Equal Opportunities Monitoring. </bold> </p><p> <#> Please complete and return the enclosed questionnaire to this office before<bold> Friday 13 March 1998 </bold> to enable us to update our monitoring systemas soon as possible. <#> If you need any help to complete this questionnaire, pleasecontact the Equal Opportunities Unit on extension 3039/5139. </p><p> <#> I have enclosed a reply envelope for your convenience. </p><p> <#> Thank you for your assistance. </p><p> <#> Encs </p></I><I><W1B-017$C><h> <#> 6 April 1994 <#> Dr Mike Browne <#> School of English <#> University Square <#> QUB </h><p> <#> Dear Mike <#> Re your letter of 20 March requesting copies of scientific papers for literary dissection, I enclose a few for your perusal, though I realise they may not meet your requirements. </p><p> <#> a <#> they are not available as a computer file, <#> b <#> they all contain diagrams, - as scientific papers must, <#> c <#> they probably exceed your work limit. </p><p> <#> These papers I have selected because I can recall having had the time (andsome fun) to 'play' with the words and they are therefore more representative of theway I would write. <#> More recent papers tend to be written by my research studentsand, to tell you the truth, are often published in some haste to get the data out, - theyare not always literary works I would be proud of. </p><p> <#> Please ask if you think I can be of further help. </p><p> <#> Best regards <&> signature </&> <#> <bold> DR P J C MOORE </bold> </p><p> <#> Encls </p></I><I><W1B-017$D><h> <#> 4 May, 1994 </h><p> <#> Dear Colleague, <#> You will be aware that in the past the Library has encountered significant difficulty in buying the books needed to support the University 's teaching and research. <#> During the past year or two the situation has improved considerably but I fear that some academic staff are not fully aware of this improvement. <#> Consequently they may be holding back on submitting proposals for the purchase of books which are needed by their students or indeed by themselves. </p><p> <#> While there are limits to what we can spend I would be very grateful if youwould encourage the staff in your School to submit proposals for books which areneeded in support of their teaching, especially where new courses are coming onstream. <#> It would be very helpful it academic staff could alert us to the need to buyadditional copies of heavily-used material. <#> All such proposals should besubmitted to the member of library staff who usually receives their proposals. <#> Ifthe proposals are received soon then there is a better chance of us having the booksavailable for the beginning of the next academic year. </p><p> <#> Thank-you for your co-operation. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <&> signature </&> <#> NORMAN J RUSSELL <#> <ul> Librarian </ul> </p></I><I><W1B-017$D><h> <#> 17 May, 1994 </h><p> <#> Dear Colleague, <#> I hope that you will be aware that for the past three years the Library has been engaged in the not inconsiderable task of converting all of its card catalogue records into a form where they can appear on the on-line public access catalogue. <#> To mark the conclusion of the project there is to be a guest lecture, sponsored by BLPMP Library Services and OCLC Europe, on the theme, <it> "Information access in the age of networks." </it> </p><p> <#> The lecturer is David R Worlock, a publisher with wide experience inmanaging folio and electronic publishing companies in educational, academic andprofessional information fields in United kingdom, European and internationalmarkets. <#> His lecture will centre on the idea that increasingly widespread networkaccess - for voice, television or text availability - at ever greater bandwidths,connotes an industrial revolution as profound and far-reaching as the Age ofSteam. </p><p> <#> The lecture will take place at <bold> 4.00pm on Wednesday, 15thJune 1994 in the English Lecture Theatre. </bold> <#> I do hope that you will beable to attend. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <&> signature </&> <#> NORMAN J RUSSELL <#> <ul> Librarian </ul> </p></I><I><W1B-017$E><h> <#> 17th May 1994 </h><p> <#> Dear Colleague, <bold> <#> Conference of Queen 's University and Schools: Saturday, 18th June 1994 </bold> </p><p> <#> I am writing to invite you and/or members of your staff to the Conference ofQueen 's University and Schools which will be held in the New Physics LectureTheatre at 10.45 am on Saturday, 18th June. <#> Coffee will be availablein the Great Hall beforehand from 10.15 am. <#> The Conference will finish with asherry reception in the Canada Room followed by lunch in the Great Hall. </p><p> <#> We are very pleased to welcome as our guest speaker to the Conference Professor Graeme Davies, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council,who will talk about the implications of the various changes which have taken place inHigher Education in recent years. </p><p> <#> The numbers of graduates being produced by Higher Education haveincreased dramatically in the last decade and this could have an effect on employmentprospects. <#> We have seen the disappearance of the binary line and also aconsiderable widening of access with the introduction of foundation Courses formature students and, more recently, the GNVQ. <#> At a time of expansion, theGovernment has now requested universities to reduce their intakes, especially in theArts-based areas. <#> On the financial side, there will be increasing reliance onstudent loans in the future with the recent announcement of the reduction in the valueof the student grant over the next three years. </p><p> <#> All of these matters will have consequences for Schools and Colleges, whichproduce students for Higher Education, and also for the Institutions of HigherEducation themselves. </p><p> <#> We look forward to hearing Professor Davies and we hope that theConference will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas. </p><p> <#> If you intend to come to this conference, and if you wish to accept theinvitations to the Reception and Lunch, please complete the attached reply form andreturn it so that we may receive it no later than <bold> Monday, 6th June. </bold> </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <&> signature </&> <#> S M Wisener <#> <ul> Schools Liaison Officer </ul> </p></I><I><W1B-017$F><h> <#> 25 November 1992 </h><p> <#> Dear Colleague, <#> Many of you will be aware of the recent introduction of a new Queen 's Affinity Card, and indeed some, as graduates of the University, will have received details by post. <#> The Affinity Card is being offered exclusively, at this stage, to staff and graduates of Queen 's and to this end I have enclosed a copy of the brochure and an application form for your information. </p><p> <#> The launch of the Affinity Card is the first part of a new alumni outreachprogramme. <#> To service this, I was appointed as Alumni Officer earlier this yearand I moved into a new permanent Alumni Office in the South part of the LanyonBuilding at the beginning of November. <#> The outreach programme, of which youas a member of staff are a part, will be an integral aspect of the 150thanniversary celebrations in 1995. <#> You will be receiving further details of thesesquicentenary in due course. </p><p> <#> The Affinity Card, which is a Visa Card valid worldwide, has many benefits.<#> Not least of these will be a <*> pound sign </*> 4 donation, for every new cardissued, from Bank of Ireland to the University to assist its ongoing development work.<#> In addition, as can be seen from the enclosed brochure, the APR rate is a full2 <*> per cent sign </*> below all other Bank of Ireland credit cards. </p><p> <#> I hope you will wish to take advantage of this opportunity to apply for yourexclusive card, with tangible benefits for both you and the University. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <&> signature </&> <#> Gerry Power <#> Alumni Officer<#> Enc. </p></I>
