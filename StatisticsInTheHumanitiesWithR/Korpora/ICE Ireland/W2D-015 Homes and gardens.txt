<W2D-015 Homes and gardens><I><W2D-015$A><h> <#> <}> <-> Puting </-> <+> Putting </+> </}> a new light in your life </h><p> <#> <bold> Nature is brilliant at varying the light with the seasons. </bold> </p><p> <#> It varies from sombre, muted glows of winter, through the contrasting light-and-shades of summer to perhaps its most effective: the mellow, subtle levels of autumn. </p><p> <#> You can match the mood of the year just as easily in your home with careful and imaginative use of lighting. </p><p> <#> It is not widely realised that lighting effects can transform a house far more cheaply than a complete redecoration, say the Lighting Association. </p><p> <#> Lighting offers tremendous flexibility - no two evenings in your front room need present quite the same atmosphere. </p><p> <#> Spotlights, uplights, downlights, table lamps, pendants - there 's a vast number of ways to ring the changes. </p><p> <#> Every room in the house benefits from imaginative lighting - and low voltage halogen and compact fluorescent bulbs add to possible combinations. </p><p> <#> The living room has to perform a multi-function role, so versatile light sources are essential. <#> Dimmer switches, too, are invaluable. </p><p> <#> Downlighters create shadowy areas which can make a room look more cosy and intimate. </p><p> <#> Subdued background illumination can also help protect against eye strain, which opticians warn can result from watching television in the dark. <#> This can be achieved with "wall-wash" lighting. </p><p> <#> By contrast the kitchen should be shadow-free yet many suffer from having only a central light source. </p><p> <#> Good lighting can eradicate the dangers of working with sharp utensils in your own gloomy shadow. </p><p> <#> Bedrooms offer wide scope for discreet lighting effects, often with opportunities to create effective glows by reflecting light off large mirrors. <#> Uplighters are also ideal for bouncing light off surfaces. </p></I><I><W2D-015$B><h> <#> A fitting change </h><p> <bold> <#> FITTED bedrooms are on the increase in Northern Ireland homes, though they account so far for only a small proportion of the very large bedroom furniture market. </bold> </p><p> <#> This is in sharp contrast to other countries on the continent such as France where up to 80 pc of homes have fitted bedroom furniture. </p><h> <#> Smaller </h><p> <#> This recent trend can be largely attributed, said a spokeswoman from Sliderobes, to the type of house being built today where rooms tend to be smaller and more awkwardly shaped. </p><p> <#> In these situations, fitted bedroom furniture triumphs over free standing as it 's custom-built, utilizing every available inch of space, from floor to ceiling and it can be made to fit any bedroom, no matter what its shape. </p><p> <#> Fitted wardrobes with sliding doors can offer a further advantage as unlike standard fitting which has hinged and bifold doors don't encroach at all, into any of the bedroom space. </p><p> <#> Where space is particularly limited sliding mirrored doors prove very popular as they automatically create an illusion of spaciousness in even the smallest of rooms. </p><p> <#> Mirrored doors have always been popular. <#> However they are not to everyone 's tastes. </p><p> <#> As a result of demand, the variety of door styles has been expanded greatly to include a wide range of wood effect panels, some very beautiful wood veneers, wallpapered panels and for those who wish to achieve total co-ordination in their chosen decor - the fabric covered panel. </p><p> <#> Fitted bedroom furniture is particularly popular around the 35 years of age group. </p></I><I><W2D-015$C><h> <#> What to look for in a conservatory </h><p> <bold> <#> NO matter what the reason for building one, there can be no doubt that the addition of a conservatory will increase the value of a home and provide a room with a difference. </bold> </p><p> <#> It therefore pays to select carefully, warns Charlie Woods, manager of BDG Conservatories. </p><p> <#> It is also desirable that the sun should shine in the new room. <#> However a south facing conservatory will become stiflingly hot if not properly ventilated. </p><p> <#> While high level opening windows are fine to air the room an opening roof vent is even more efficient. <#> It is worth considering incorporating thermally controlled roof vents. </p><p> <#> No longer is the conservatory a room which is used only in summer and for that reason double glazing is generally standard nowadays. <#> In particularly sunny locations, tinted glass may be desirable as it cuts down both glare and heat. </p><h> <#> Strong </h><p> <#> Glare can also be caused by very light coloured ceramic floor tiles and it is worth keeping this in mind when choosing from the wide range of floor coverings available. </p><p> <#> The most common materials used in the framework of a conservatory are aluminium, timber and PVCU. <#> Each of these have their advantages and disadvantages. <#> Aluminium provides a very strong structure but may not perform as well thermally as PVCU while wood requires more maintenance than either. </p><p> <#> Lighting can create atmosphere as well as fulfilling a practical purpose and in many dwellings the <}> <-> fluorescent </-> <+> fluorescent </+> </}> strip has been replaced by more subtle means of ceiling and wall lighting. </p><p> <#> A ceiling fan can help ventilation but can also incorporate lighting and be decorative. </p></I><I><W2D-015$D><h> <#> A new outlook on life </h><p> <bold> <#> ONE aspect of your home that influences your life is that of sunlight, another equally fundamental consideration is energy, writes Jonathan Cromie of Turkington Windows and Conservatories. </bold> </p><p> <#> We instinctively know that sunlight is crucial to our mental and physical health, yet progress has resulted in our conducting more of our working time hidden away from the sun. <#> Our optimum environment is daylight. </p><p> <#> A surprisingly large amount of heat too is provided by the ambient energy present in daylight. <#> We should do well to consider that during daylight a glass wall will gain more heat <}> <-> that </-> <+> than </+> </}> it loses, whereas a brick wall will only lose heat, especially when wet. </p><h> <#> Integral </h><p> <#> Conservatories therefore have become very popular additions to our homes for good reason, and, are now often integral parts of new dwellings. </p><p> <#> Up to 50,000 conservatories a year are being installed in Britain, and the number is rising. <#> As a result of new technology and materials, today 's conservatory can be more economic than ever before. <#> Reinforced PVCu has become the norm, with its low maintenance and high insulation properties. <#> Double glazing, toughened, tinted, laminated or with low emmissivity coatings are even more practical. <#> Roofs can be double glazed, or of polycarbonate, with its properties of great impact strength, increased insulation, lower deadweight, ultraviolet filtering and glare reduction without the need for internal roof blinds. </p><p> <#> Features of any conservatory depend on the demands and <}> <-> constraints </-> <+> constraints </+> </}> imposed by your home. <#> If you do not have doors from your house at a suitable position, which windows you open up into doorways; which position would give the best views? </p><h> <#> Symbol </h><p> <#> Orientate the site in a southerly aspect if possible for maximum solar gain, S.E. for morning sun, S.W. for a view west as the sun sets. <#> Do you want your conservatory easily seen from the road as a status symbol, or is it to be a quiet retreat away from public view? </p><p> <#> Doors and windows of many kinds can be used, remember, heat build up in summer can be surprising and windows can be features as well as necessities. </p><p> <#> Solid floors store heat during the day and improve ambient temperature, remember, reflective or white tiles should be avoided as they dazzle under direct sunlight. </p></I><I><W2D-015$E><h> <#> Get your garden ready for spring </h><p> <bold> <#> SEPTEMBER sees a change of emphasis in the garden, a change which gains impetus as the autumn advances, writes Craig Wallace. </bold> </p><p> <#> During the summer months the emphasis is mainly on maintenance and the keeping up of appearances - the lawn, hedges, the roses, the general flower borders, hanging baskets, window boxes, container plants, the vegetable plot. </p><p> <#> With attention being paid to watering and feeding, a colourful flower display can be maintained to the end of September and beyond. </p><h> <#> Fillip </h><p> <#> And with such a sunless summer a fine "back-end" would be a real fillip. <#> However, as the light evenings get shorter and the days draw-in, harvesting and planning ahead become increasingly important. </p><p> <#> Bulb planting now means a welcome display from February through to May next year. <#> The bulbs have been in the nurseries and garden centres since the end of August. </p><h> <#> Choice </h><p> <#> Even if planting has to be spread out, purchases should be made as soon as possible. <#> Otherwise as the bulbs get picked over, and the boxes emptied you might have to take the leavings and second choice. <#> And it 's not unknown for bulbs to get mixed with all the handling and sorting, the longer they are on display. </p><p> <#> Daffodil planting comes first, repeat first. <#> Expert growers make a point of getting in their daffs before the end of September, earlier if possible. <#> Generally the taller and larger the daffodil variety, the bigger the bulb - dwarf and miniature types produce quite small bulbs. </p><h> <#> Virus </h><p> <#> I have seldom seen poor quality bulbs on offer from local garden centres or from the reputable bulb firms, but beware of the cheap mail-order bargains as they can prove to be very disappointing what with virus, eel-worm, narcissus-fly affecting the bulbs. </p><p> <#> Tulip planting can take the hindmost, even well into November, with all the others, the crocuses, snowdrops, irises, aconites, scillas, hyacinths, puschkinias, etc. coming in between. <#> It 's all about looking forward and planning. </p><p> <#> Work on the lawn also has an element of looking ahead - for a better sward next spring and summer. <#> Autumn lawn dressings tend to contain less nitrogen and greater proportions of potash and phosphate. </p><p> <#> Hence the immediate greening-up effect is less noticeable, compared to spring and summer lawn foods. <#> On the other hand the slower acting ingredients work over the autumn and winter months so that the grasses get off to an early spring start. </p><p> <#> The manual tasks - scarifying, raking, aerating, spiking, top-dressing - all are aimed at long term improvements as well. </p><p> <#> Autumn is also a time for "putting to bed" the summer flowers - the gladioli, dahlias, begonias, the early chrysanthemums, fuchsias, geraniums. </p></I><I><W2D-015$F><h> <#> The colours of autumn </h><p> <bold> <#> WHAT colours an designs are fashionable in the home this autumn? asks Mandy Tang of Donaldson and Lyttle. </bold> <p><p> <#> Well, almost anything goes, it 's down to the individual 's personal taste, ranging from cool blues, greens and yellows to intense marigolds, <}> <-> colbalt </-> <+> cobalt </+> </}> blues and deep Indian red, even natural ivory with taupe, combined with texture all seem to be increasingly popular. </p><h> <#> Tones </h><p> <#> Therefore, earth tones are very much a favourite combining terracotta and golds with rich spice colours. <#> A lot of these themes are inspired from Indian art, textiles and architecture. </p><p> <#> Traditional styles are being freely and imaginatively adapted to suit the modern home. <#> However, man fabrics used in the later 17th century were made from luxury silks and heavy cotton velvets which have to be replaced with man-made fibre copies to create a similar effect. </p><p> <#> Many traditional fabrics were heavily patterned with deep floral prints and brocades which complemented the silk damask weaves used on upholstery. </p><p> <#> Many people today concentrate on what fabric they use on their suites and use that as a base to work around. </p><p> <#> They are initially looking for value for money, a hard wearing cover with serviceable colours. <#> These can easily be found with the help of an interior design consultant who has the knowledge of what is widely available. </p></I><I><W2D-015$G><h> <#> Mediterranean style </h><p> <bold> <#> WHEN it comes to the use of tiles in our homes, we fall well behind our style-conscious European partners, writes Frances Egan of Tile Market. </bold> </p><p> <#> The French and Germans use around twice the number of tiles we do and the Italians around four times. <#> However, in recent years the trend towards tiles here is rapidly growing and reflected in the styles, colours and sizes available. </p><p> <#> So why tiles? <#> A look at the practical benefits will explain why there is an ever increasing popular choice. </p><p> <#> Firstly, they are easily cleaned and hygienic. <#> They don't hold residues or dust and are largely unaffected by light. <#> Another important features of ceramic tiles is their insulation capacity. <#> They tend to retain heat generated inside a room, while on the other hand they will keep a room cool during hot weather. </p><p> <#> Traditionally tiles are used most in kitchens and bathrooms. <#> However, trends in interior design and the move away from wall to wall carpeting means tiles are in vogue throughout the home. </p><p> <#> Tiles fall into two main categories - floor tiles and wall tiles, each of which are made to different specifications and are available in a wide range of materials. <#> Therefore the importance of visiting a specialist, experienced tile supplier must be stressed if you are to find the right tile for your job and avoid the pitfalls. </p><p> <#> Floor tiles are available in a wide range of materials ranging from ceramics to marble, terracotta and slate. <#> The choice of floor tile will depend on what type of effect is to be achieved. <#> Terracotta and slate tiles give a warm rustic feel while ceramic tiles give a more modern look. </p></I>
