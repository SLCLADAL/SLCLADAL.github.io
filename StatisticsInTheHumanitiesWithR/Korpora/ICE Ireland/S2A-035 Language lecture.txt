<ICE-IRE:S2A-035 Language lecture><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-035$A> <#> Learning to talk is probably the the biggest or the greatest intellectual feat that every everyone can have to uh perform <#> And yet despite that kind of statement of course you know we 're not conscious of actually having to perform a great intellectual feat in learning to talk <#> So in a sense uh it 's something that uh we find ourselves doing without ever having thought about how we got there and how we achieved it <#> Uhm today I want to look uh in a very superficial manner really at uh what goes into this business of learning language <#> Uhm <,> it has to be superficial to some extent because uh it 's only an hour but also because the whole business isn't properly understood <#> And uhm there are a lot of complicating factors which mean that it 's very difficult to understand how it all fits together uh for example uhm if you 're uh learning a language a child at any one moment can be expanding the vocabulary uh learning new concepts uh mastering a wider range of sentence structures uh learning to use expression <,> uhm using tone and gesture in a sort of a more sophisticated way and so on <#> Along with that we have all these simultaneous tasks that seem to interact with each other uh and develop towards adult language just like <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> task <#> I 'd like to start off by looking at uh what people in the past have done about studying the acquisition of language <#> Uhm and when you read text books on the acquisition of language sometimes it looks as if people had never uhm become interested in it until about the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies the way that the text books talk <#> In fact that 's not true at all <#> Uhm if you go back to the eighteenth century there was a very famous German biologist called Tiedemann uh and uh he initiated a long line of uh observational diary-type studies in which people kept diaries of how a child 's language developed <#> Uhm <,> and uh he was uh quoted as having described how children went through from sort of the babbling phase to saying one-word type utterances to putting together two-word type utterances uh to a very famous uh kind of statement uhm of what his child who he was studying came up with at the age of two and a half <#> He said eventually by the age of two and a half the child was able to open his mouth and make this lovely statement and the statement was the child said <,> uhm <,> the Son of God said tomorrow he will get up again drink his tea and eat his bread and butter <#> A very kind of erudite uhm child but uh the point that is made is that by two and a half uh children have the beginnings of being able to talk in reasonably adult sentences <,> though I 'm not sure that you 'll ever find a child of two and a half who will actually say something like that <#> That 's another matter <#> Uhm <,> Darwin Charles Darwin also kept a study a diary study of a child 's uh development of language <#> And that was followed by other people <,> people such as Werner <,> uh Leopold and who kept a long uhm diary studies from nineteen thirty-nine to nineteen forty-nine <#> So when we get all this talk in the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies about uhm language acquisition in fact uhm it 's really a re-emergence of a study that that had already been in earlier times <#> And it re-emerged for a very good reason <#> It re-emerged because in a sense it had been suppressed earlier on in the twentieth century because one of the schools of thought earlier on was called the behaviourist school of thought and it was again their whole uhm outlook on science to look at uh language acquisition as development and you don't need to go into the details of that cos you know the details but <,> that was why or partly why there haven't been many studies preceding the sixties and seventies <#> Now <,> let 's sort of start from first principles to understand how language is uhm produced and uh hence how it 's acquired <#> Uhm <,> and first principles take us to some biological aspects of the acquisition of language <#> And the first one of these is probably the brain <#> I 'm sure you 've seen slides like this before but uhm <,> <#> Did that make that noise <,> mm <,> <#> Well let me get it working <#> There 's no light probably <#> Well that 's fine okay I can't show you the brain then <#> Well we can always try to talk about the brain instead <#> Uhm <,> there 's uh there 're two sides to the brain firstly there 's the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and uh these are crucial and related to the whole business of uhm language and language development <#> Uhm the uh it is normally said that the left hemisphere the left side of the brain controls uh language and there are particular areas in the left side of the brain or the left hemisphere which are thought to be responsible for particular areas of language <#> Uhm these are called uhm uh <,> Broca 's area and the Wernicke 's area <,> and uh they are responsible or generally speaking uh the Broca 's area is related to the production of speech and Wernicke 's to uh the perception or comprehension of speech <#> Now uh this uh basic notion of the brain and language and it being in the left hemisphere or the central left hemisphere is interesting when you get onto talking or thinking about the acquisition of language as such <,> because uhm because we know that in adult uhm brains and in adult language it 's the left hemisphere that 's involved in language production it would be tempting to think that somehow the left hemisphere is at the very start predisposed to uhm being a hemisphere oozing with language but in fact and it 's the right hemisphere that 's somehow not suitable <#> But in fact you you look at uhm it not experiments but you know accidents that well which have happened <,> uh which uhm happen early on a child 's life say in the first year of life whereby a child uh has uh most of the left hemisphere removed by surgery in fact you 'll find that that child can talk uhm and uh can produce language with only the right hemisphere though the speech won't be as good as it would be if uhm you had the left hemisphere and not the right hemisphere <#> So uhm you know it does seem that the left hemisphere may uh not be as may not have as much innate properties in it as it were <,> conditioning or uh conditioned to language acquisition or to language development as might be thought <#> But somehow along the way uhm it seems to get dominated by language <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> <,> probably because it gets dominated quite early on and uhm then later on when you come on to do other types of tasks like spatial tasks and so on they tend to go over into the right hemisphere <#> It takes over the control of those <#> Uhm and it 's <.> o </.> it 's probably the case that the left hemisphere is used initially for language and then becomes uh pre-empts the use of anything else in that hemisphere with <,> uh any other function as much <#> Uhm <,> <.> i </.> it 's probably that case because uh the left hemisphere uh develops faster and so it may be uh better as it were for the acquisition of language <#> But whatever uhm all the arguments formulae for the right and left hemisphere and so on it 's just useful to know that uh by and large we talk about language in the left hemisphere uhm and it looks as if uh it 's not fundamentally crucial in the early very early years of life but subsequently takes over the function of uh language <#> Now another thing that 's uh very important in learning to talk is hearing of course <#> Uhm if you can't hear if you 're born congenitally very deaf uh you won't learn to speak in any kind of uh way that we would call normal speech <#> Uhm on the other hand uh you would still develop language so there 's this innate this innate ability for language there because deaf people will learn to sign and that is a language in its own right <#> Signing is a language and we refer to it as sign language <#> Uhm so uh you need hearing then to produce actual normal speech but language uhm you can produce even if it 's only signed language or even if it 's signed language <#> Uh without uh hearing <#> Now <,> uhm in spite of all this you need to have some kind of exposure to language if you 're going to learn to talk <#> So if you in fact have all the natural biological requisites but you 're not exposed to language it would appear that you won't learn language <#> And there 've been various experiments done over the years which suggest this and I think you may well have heard of some of these already <#> Uhm there uh <,> were experiments uhm which were as it were uhm partly uhm well no some of them were accidental and some of them were deliberate <#> Uh some of the deliberate ones are referred to often as The Royal Experiments because they involved a group of royal people in various countries in the world much <,> a long time ago uh actually carrying out experiments to see what would happen if you locked children up uhm and kept them away from any adult uhm or any uh form of language uh <,> you would find out uh why whether they learned to talk or not <#> And uh there were several people who did this uhm well are reported to have done it uh James the Fourth of Scotland <,> uhm Akbar the Great <,> uhm Frederick the Second uh and one of the Egyptian Pharaohs <,> uhm Solomon <#> And they apparently are uh reported to have interned children uh with primate caretakers uh and then gone back uh a long time later to see whether they could speak or not <,> and lo and behold they found that they didn't speak and they were absolutely mute <#> Uhm so uh the conclusion that one has to come to and there 're other there 's other experimentation which suggests the same thing is that you have to have some degree of exposure to language before you 'll learn uhm to actually talk <#> Now <,> there are more recent experiments which suggest that it 's not just you know absolutely straightforward that you must have exposure to language to be able to talk <#> Uhm perhaps to produce speech oral you know speech that you can hear you 're going to need some exposure to that speech <#> But to produce a language which is not necessarily spoken like a sign language for instance uhm <,> it would appear that you can do that even if you are uh at least to some extent even if you are not exposed to language and I want to uh report another experiment which suggests that <#> This is a more recent one in uh the States uhm in the I think the seventies or so <#> Uhm and uh what happened there sort of came about by accident really with a group of uhm <,> well at one stage it was fairly common with uh congenitally profoundly deaf children uh to try to get them to learn how to speak rather than signing uh and of course as you 're probably well aware there 's a big debate over whether to sign or to whether to speak <#> And uh the at some stages these children uh were prevented in schools uhm from <&> cough </&> from learning to sign <#> They weren't taught any sign language and what 's more they weren't allowed sign <#> Teachers would stop them in the belief that if they weren't encouraged to sign and weren't subjected to sign language they would then learn oral language much better <#> Uh in fact that 's not true <#> It 's been shown since that uhm uh letting them sign will actually help them acquire oral language rather than hinder them <#> But anyway this group of children uhm were studied uh because they were not allowed to sign <#> Their parents were told not to sign to them because it would be encouraging them to get into bad habits of signing rather than oral speech <#> And uh their teachers at school didn't sign to them <#> So of course they were profoundly deaf so they couldn't hear and because they were profoundly deaf and couldn't hear they didn't develop speech very easily <#> Uhm and they couldn't sign either so you might say that they were living in a kind of uhm context where there was very little exposure to language <#> I know it wasn't absolute non non-exposure I 'm sure <,> but there was very there was limited exposure <#> Uhm but in fact these children are shown to have developed in spite of all the restrictions on them to have developed their own kind of form of uh language which was a system of as it were gestures</I>
