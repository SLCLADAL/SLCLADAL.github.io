<ICE-IRE:S2A-058 Flowers><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-058$A> <#> Hello there <#> Welcome once again to a brand new series of How Do You Do <#> Well it 's great to see you all again <,> and uh I think I look more or less the same but we have a little bit of a transformation here in our set or our room <,> because as you can see it has been transformed to an extent <#> We 've painted all our walls in a bright peach and some lovely blue all around the windows and the doors and I think it looks brighter and better than ever before <#> Well we 've lots of great things lined up for you to make on this series starting today with some lovely colourful flowers <#> And uh we have them here on the table <#> And we 've first of all got these lovely lilies in white and green and some bits of yellow sticking out <#> And then behind them we 've got the bright colourful sun <.> ch </.> flowers uh with the yellow crepe paper <#> And then my favourite of the bunch are all these lovely poppies in red <#> And uh finally in front we 've got some nice colourful pansies <#> So we 'll try and get around to making some if not all of those flowers today but as usual if you remember last year we always started the show by telling you all the little bits and pieces that you need <#> So the main ingredients for today are uh brightly coloured crepe paper in different colours as you can see here on the table <#> We also need uh lots of sticks <#> These are garden sticks you can get in any garden centre and some wire <#> Okay <#> So uh we 'll get down to business straight away <#> We might as well not waste time and we 'll make the poppies <#> Now we start with a piece of uh red crepe paper and uh we cut it into a size like that <#> Then we 'll get uhm a marker <,> and uh we draw a shape which rather resembles a big tongue <,,> <#> So uh we draw round like that <,,> and uh then we get our scissors <,> and we cut it out <,> <#> Okay <,> and uh cut around the end <#> So basically what you 're doing really is just cutting all around the black lines <,,> <#> So <,,> you end up with a whole load of uh red petals and they 're all going to form the petals uh of your flower <#> All right <#> So we leave those aside for a minute and we 'll go back to making the actual centre <#> Now the centre will uh is made with uh first of all a garden stick and then you get a bunch of uh green crepe paper like that <#> Then you get another little bit like this <,> <.> an </.> you can gather it around here <#> And uh then you get a piece of garden wire <#> And uh this is more like florist 's wire <#> It 's very thin wire <#> You can get it in garden centres or flower shops <#> If you haven't got the wire you could use uhm a piece of twine or a bit of string or wool instead <#> So wrap it around like that <#> And then <,> you get your marker <,> and you draw <,> lines <,,> down the centre <,> a bit like in fact drawing spiders ' legs <,,> <#> Okay <,> like that <,,> so that uh you will end up with one which is slightly neater and uh looks like that <#> All right <#> So we put that aside and the next thing we have to do then is get some black crepe paper <#> And what I 've done with the black crepe paper is I 've cut it into a small strip first of all and then I just fringed it <#> And that 's done by just cutting your scissors into the crepe paper down like that <#> Now you don't in fact go the full way <#> You sort of leave that bit there <#> So what we 'll do is we open it out <#> Just find an opening for it <,> wherever it is <,> <#> Uhm I 'll tell you what we 'll just cut into it so we get an opening <,> <#> Open it out <,> and <,> we keep a little piece there <,> and then we 'll get some glue <,,> and we put some glue <,> on the end <,> of our <,> centre piece <,> and then <,> get the black <,> and we start to roll around like that <#> Okay <#> And uh when you come to the very end then just get another dab of glue <,> and <,> stick it like that there <#> Alright <#> Now <,> at this stage we go back to our petals <#> And as I said we have a right bunch of them there <#> And we take each individual petal in our hand and we put our two thumbs <,> in the centre <,> and we just stretch the paper slightly <#> Do the same with this one <#> Stretch <,> and <,> stretch <#> And you do that altogether with about twelve petals <#> So all we do then is <,> put some glue <,> on the end of each petal <#> Glue it on to the centre <#> Let it set <#> Get some more glue <,> on to the petal <,> and glue it on there <,> and let it set <#> And you do the same thing the whole way around <#> Keep going around like that <#> Now you keep going around until eventually your <,> flower is full or filled up should I say with lots of petals <#> We 'll just add one more on for good measure <#> So uh stretching it in the centre we stick it on there <#> Okay <#> So all we do at this stage then is we get a piece of green crepe paper cut into a strip <,> a long piece into a strip <,> and uh we get our glue <,> and put the glue <,> around the top part <,> and again down there <,> on a little bit on a stick <#> And we just <,> put the crepe paper in there <,> like that <#> And then <,> wrap it around <#> Stick it on <#> Wrap it around there <,> and <,> keep just <,> rolling it <,> down along the stem <,> like this <,,> and <,> when you come more or less <,> to the end <,> of your stem <#> Now we haven't got quite enough to finish this one off but I 'll just show you how you finish it off <#> Just coming towards the end put a little bit of glue at the end there <,> and roll it round once more <,> and glue it on <#> Okay <#> Now we have one here <,> which uh we have fully <,> covered <#> There 's the stem all covered like this <#> Alright <#> So uh all we do at this stage is make some leaves <,> and the leaves very simply are made on green crepe paper <#> And what you 're doing really is cutting out a zigzag shape <#> Now just cut up and down like this <#> And when I say a zigzag shape I don't mean that uh you draw a Zig and Zag but a shape like this <#> Alright <#> So uh you draw the shape like that <#> Then you get your scissors and you cut out all around the black lines <#> And uh you should end up with a bunch of leaves like those <#> Okay <#> So you take each individual leaf in your hand <,> get a little bit of glue <,> go back to your flower <,> and catch it there in the centre <#> There like that <#> And uh if you want to add on another one <,> just get <,> another leaf <,> <.> s </.> more glue <#> Just move down a little bit down the stem <#> And uh <,> you glue it on there like that <#> Alright <#> So the final thing you do with this flower is just <,> open out all the petals <,> to <,> reveal <,> your lovely centre inside <#> And then if you 've got a nice painted jam jar or a nice vase you can pop it in and uh there you go with your first flower <#> So those are the poppies and uh <,> I must say they 're my favourite <#> Now moving fairly quickly on to the next one we will make a sunflower this time <#> And uh we start again with the <,> petals <#> And what I have actually done is <,> I won't draw it out for you because I have it already drawn on a piece of yellow crepe paper this time <#> Cut a piece about that size and then draw a <,> shape up and down like that <#> Again a zig and zag shape rather like Indian feathers on a headband <#> Cut them out <,> and uh you 'll end up with that idea <#> Right <#> Now we go back to the centre <#> And the centre is uh the same idea really as we did with uhm the poppies <#> We just put on a ball this time of green crepe paper or should I say we put green on the poppies with brown this time <,> and a little bit of brown paper over it <#> And uh you can see our little fluffy bits there <#> And what I did really with that was I just put some glue <#> We 'll just do it again <#> Put some glue chopped up some brown crepe paper in a bowl <,> and then <,> dipped it in <#> And uh it 's a bit like having some chocolate flake <,> alright <,> on the top of the your flower <#> So uh we leave that one aside to dry <,> and uh we 've got this one here <#> So all we do then is <,> we open out our leaves <,> and uh we put <,,> well these are not actually leaves <#> They 're petals really <#> But uh I get them mixed up sometimes when I 'm <,> saying one thing and another <#> So we just uh put a bit of glue as you see there <,> uh stick it on <#> And then all you do is a rolling process <#> So you keep rolling along like that <#> Okay <,> until eventually you get the whole lot of this on <#> And uh when you have the whole lot on <,> your uh flower should look like that <,> just a big bunch out like that <,> okay <#> Now what I 've done just to make sure that it 's a little bit secure is I got a little piece of the thin wire and I wrapped it around there but you again can use string or a bit of wool to do the same thing <#> So once more we go and uh we get a strip of green crepe paper <#> And we just get a strip here <,> cut it off <,,> the green crepe paper <#> Excuse me <#> Dropped it on the floor <#> And uh we put a little bit of glue around the top part of our flower <#> And uh <,> all we do then is just <,> wrap it around like this <,> <#> And <,> the same wrapping process as we did with the poppy <,> so that eventually when you come to your end <,> you will end up with your flower completely covered up like the one I have here in my hand <#> Okay <#> Well the final thing we have to do then are to make some leaves for it <#> And uh the leaves are done <,> very simply by getting first of all a piece of wire <,> <.> an </.> I 'm using a little thicker piece this time <,> and then cutting out again from your crepe paper uhm a bunch of green leaves <#> And uh <,> what you do is you take two leaves for each one if you know what I mean there 's two <#> And you put a little bit of glue <,> in the centre of the leaf <,> and stick on your wire <,> down like that <#> And uh put another dabs of glue just round the rest of it <#> And stick the other one on top like this <,> like that <#> And uh <,> so you end up with the leaf that looks like that <#> Now you 'd want to make three or four uh for your sunflower <#> So uh when you 've made them you just get <,> uhm your wire <#> Now I have very thin wire on this one <#> So wrap it around several times <,> like this <#> And uh <,> we 'll add on another one <,,> just down here a little bit <,> like that <,> okay <#> And uh <,> the idea with the wire is then that you can bend the flowers up <,> or you can bend them back down again if they 're uhm a sad or a happy sunflower <#> But these are happy sunflowers today so we 'll put all the leaves sitting up nice and brightly <#> Okay <#> So finally all we have to do is just to open out our uhm <,> petals <#> And once more <,> we reveal <,> our lovely chocolate brown centre <,> inside <#> Okay <#> So that 's our sunflower <#> And uh we 'll put it in there beside the poppy</I>
