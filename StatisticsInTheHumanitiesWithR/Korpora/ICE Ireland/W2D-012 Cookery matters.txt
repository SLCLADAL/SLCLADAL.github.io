<W2D-012 Cookery matters><I><h> <#> PIES WITH A PUNCH </h><p> <#> A notice in the butcher 's shop window announcing how many days until Christmas jolts the imagination and fills me with that feeling of pre-Christmas entertaining. <#> So often the idea of a pie and a glass of punch party has immense appeal for those who like to entertain but want to keep it fairly casual and simple. </p><p> <#> I always prefer simple dishes to fussy ones and at this busy time of the year I turn my back on dishes with vigorous demands of split second timing. <#> I have arrived at a selection of pies such as Snap Crackle Chicken; tender strips of chicken tossed in Parmesan cheese and served with slices of aubergine and a rich tomato sauce, or a Crustless Quiche which does not require making and rolling out pastry. <#> Try the Bacon Muffins which go so well with a glass of Mulled Wine punch and create that instant cosy appeal by pulling up a chair and sitting down in front of a Calor gas living flame fire with instant heat and atmosphere at the press of a button. </p><p> <#> So many of these pies can be made in advance but I remember vividly one day was set aside as the main baking and cooking day. <#> How easy life would have been with the Cannon Classique cooker with two large ovens ideal for the family who enjoys entertaining or have a lot to feed. </p><p> <#> Punch is always popular and the smell of Mulled Wine punch simmering on top of the hob is wonderful. <#> Don't forget to offer the choice of <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> non-alcoholic drink for those who may prefer it. </p><h> <bold> <#> Raised chicken and ham pie </bold> </h><h> <ul> <#> Hot Water Crust Pastry </h><p> <#> 170 ml/6fl oz water <#> 115g/4 oz butter <#> 115g/4 oz lard or unsaturated fat <#> 450g/1 lb flour <#> 1 egg yolk <#> 1 tsp salt </ul> </p><h> <bold> <#> Filling </bold> </h><p> <ul> <#> 450g/1 ob cooked chicken pieces <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb cooked ham <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb mushrooms lightly cooked <#> 1 dsp chopped parsley <#> salt, pepper, pinch cayenne pepper </ul> </p><h> <bold> <#> To make the pastry </bold> </h><p> <#> This quantity makes enough to line a 1.41 (2.5 pint) mould or 200mm (8 in) cake tin. </p><p> <#> Warm the mixing bowl and sieve the flour and salt into it. <#> Make a well in the centre and hide the egg yolk in the flour. <#> Heat the butter, lard and water in a saucepan, and when boiling make sure that the fat has melted before boiling point is reached. <#> Pour into the flour and egg, mixing well with a spoon or knife. <#> When the dough has cooled slightly turn onto a floured surface and knead until the pastry is smooth. <#> It is a good idea to cover the pastry with cling film and leave it to rest at this stage for 15-20 minutes. <#> Then use two-thirds to line the pie dish (keeping one-third for the topping) pressing firmly into the tin. </p><p> <#> Pack the cooked chicken, ham and mushrooms well into the tin, brush the top edge on the pastry with beaten egg, place the rolled-out third of pastry on top, and, using fingers, seal well on top. <#> Decorate with pastry leaves, and make a hole to allow the steam to escape. <#> Bake at gas 5 for 30-35 minutes. </p><h> <bold> <#> Crustless Quiche </bold> </h><p> <#> A very easy and quick dish which does not involve the making and rolling of pastry. <#> A variety of fillings can be used. </p><p> <ul> <#> 170g/6ozs self-raising flour <#> 55g/2ozs bran <#> 6 eggs <#> 1/4 teaspoonful salt <#> 85g/3ozs unsaturated margarine <#> 425 ml/ 3/4 pint of milk <#> 1 large onion finely chopped <#> 115g/4 ozs mushrooms <#> 1 small tin salmon <#> 225g/8ozs broccoli frozen <#> Sprinkling of dill and freshly milled black pepper <#> Grated cheese to flavour and garnish </ul> </p><p> <#> Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl, then rub in the margarine. <#> Add the bran. <#> Whisk the eggs, milk and cheese mixing well with the salmon and broccoli. <#> The onion and mushrooms can be slightly cooked in the pan before also adding at this stage. </p><p> <#> Grease a quiche dish, then mixing well pour mixture into the dish and bake in the middle shelf of a preheated oven gas mark 5 for 30 minutes until golden brown and well risen. <#> Cut and serve hot or cold with wedges of lemon. <#> Good with tomato and basil salad. <#> For extra flavour, try a sprinkling of dill and freshly milled black pepper. </p><h> <bold> <#> Turkey and Almond Crumble with Crisp Celery </bold> </h><p> <#> The secret of success with this dish is in the careful making of the buttery breadcrumbs. <#> The addition of a crisp layer of celery gives this dish an element of surprise. </p><h> <bold> <#> Crumble Topping </bold> </h><p> <ul> <#> 8 slices white bread, crusts removed <#> 55g/2oz butter <#> 1/2 tsp salt <#> 1/2 tsp ground mace <#> 115g/4oz flaked almonds <#> 1 head celery <#> 3 tablespoons chopped <#> parsley </ul> </p><h> <bold> <#> Sauce </bold> </h><p> <ul> <#> 55g/2oz butter <#> 55g/2oz plain white flour <#> 850 ml/1.5 pints milk <#> 1 chicken stock cube <#> 55g/2oz grated cheese (Parmesan) <#> 450g/1 lb turkey or chicken pieces <#> 1/2 tsp mustard </ul> </p><p> <#> Cut the turkey into bite sized pieces and arrange in a large fairly shallow ovenproof dish. <#> Cooked turkey can be used for this dish but if using uncooked turkey or chicken lightly fry in a pan ensuring the flesh is well cooked and a light golden brown. </p><p> <#> Next make the sauce, melt the fat in a pan, add the flour and blend well with the milk and blended stock cube (dissolve in 2-3 tbsp boiling water) bring to the boil and simmer gently for 1-2 mins. <#> Add the grated cheese and mustard then pour over the turkey pieces. </p><p> <#> Finally make the crumble topping. <#> Melt the butter in a saucepan then add the salt, mace, breadcrumbs and almonds and cook for two mins until the crumbs become well coated and golden brown. </p><p> <#> Layer the celery over the turkey and sauce and then finally sprinkle the crumble topping over the celery. <#> Bake in oven gas mark 5 for 25-30 mins. <#> Serve piping hot garnished with freshly chopped parsley. </p><h> <#> <bold> Bacon Muffins </bold> </h><p> <#> These are delicious served warm with a glass of hot mulled wine. </p><bold> <#> Makes about 14. </p><p> <#> Preparation time: 20-25 mins <#> Cooking time: 35-40 mins <#> Oven setting gas 5 <ul> <#> 85g/3 oz back bacon <#> 340g/12oz self raising flour <#> 2 tsp baking powder <#> 1 tbsp chopped parsley <#> 2 eggs, size 2, beaten <#> 115g/4oz butter, metled and cooled <#> 140ml/1/4 pint milk </ul> </p><p> <#> 1. Cut the rind and excess fat off the bacon and finely chop the meat. <#> 2. Sieve the flour and baking powder into a bowl. <#> 3. Stir in the chopped parsley and lightly cooked bacon. <#> 4. Pour in the beaten egg and melted butter. <#> Beat well, adding enough milk to form a dropping consistency. <#> 5. Spoon the mixture into 14 muffin tins or deep patty tins. <#> Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 mins gas 4. <#> Serve warm. </p></I><I><W2D-012$A><h> <#> The Big Apple </h><p> <#> <bold> There are few things to match the sweet flavour and crunch of home grown apples - whether they be eaters or cookers. <#> I like to use eaters in many desserts as they are less tart and more aromatic. <#> However, they can be difficult to puree down so a good whizz in the processor may be needed. <#> Apples combine so well with other savoury ingredients such as nuts, blackberries and elderberries for tarts, pies, puddings and crumbles or with plums, damsons, onions and tomatoes to create chutneys and relish which bring that wonderful aroma of autumn in the kitchen. <#> To preserve the flavours of apples in liquid form try apple cordial - not quite so potent as Joe Grundy from the Archer 's home brew. <#> As well as for drinking it 's such a good choice to use when poaching apples and berries. <#> Remember when buying apples, big does not always mean best and I find the medium sized ones have a better flavour. <#> As a rule, three apples should weigh about a pound. <#> If you can't keep up with the abundance of fruit in late autumn then apples freeze extremely well for up to six months. <#> Peel, core and slice them thickly, blanch in boiling water for just 1 minute. <#> Drain, then plunge into cold water and pack either in rigid containers or polythene bags, dusted with a little sugar. <#> Making chutney is easier than jam making, but the secret lies in long steady cooking which should never be over-boiled. <#> Cooking with CALOR GAS gives a good steady flame which is rapid and easy to regulate to ensure this even cooking. <#> Chutneys improve greatly with maturity, so store at least one month before using. <#> Enjoy the fruits of this wonderful season and remember, an apple a day keeps the doctor away as effectively in apple cordial, chutney or even baked apple sponge! </p><p> <#> <it> Please turn page for more recipes </it> </p><h> <#> <bold> Apple cordial </bold> </h><p> <#> This mildly flavoured cordial can be stored in screw top bottlers and diluted. <#> I find it invaluable to add a concentrated apple flavour if roasting pork or duck. </p><p> <#> 35kg/31b apples <#> juice of one lemon <#> 285/10 oz granulated sugar <#> 1/2 tsp citric acid <#> 570ml/1 pint water </p><p> <#> Choose those firm rosy apples if you can for this cordial - they will give it a much nicer flavour and colour. <#> Wash and dry the apples, then chop up, but be careful to remove any blemishes which may be found on overripe apples. </p><p> <#> Place in a large bowl, cover with water and lemon juice and leave to soften, stirring occasionally. <#> Cover and leave for 24 hours. </p><p> <#> Transfer to a heavy based pan and simmer until the fruit becomes soft. <#> Transfer to a jelly bag or a sieve lined with muslin and strain. <#> Do not speed up the process or the cordial will become cloudy. </p><p> <#> Return the strained juice to a saucepan, add the sugar and citric acid, and bring to almost boiling point and when the sugar has dissolved, leave to cool, then bottle. </p><p> <#> This cordial should store in the refrigerator for up to one week. </p><h> <#> <bold> Blackberry and apple pie </bold> </h><p> <#> Sweet Pastry: <#> 285g/10 oz plain flour <#> 55g/2oz caster sugar <#> 200g/7 oz sunflower <}> <-> margerine </-> <+> margarine </+> </}> or softened butter <#> 1 egg yolk <#> Filling: <#> 450g/1 lb cooking apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced <#> 125g/4oz blackberries <#> 55g/2oz demerara sugar <#> 1/2 tsp cinnamon or cloves <#> 2 dsp cider or apple juice or water to brush pastry <#> one egg <#> (Serves 8) </p><p> <#> To make the pastry sieve the flour into a bowl, add the softened fat, cut and rub through. <#> Add the caster sugar and egg yolk to mix to a soft dough. <#> Cover the pastry with cling film and leave to relax and firm up in the fridge for at least 1/2 hour. </p><p> <#> Put the apple juice, demerara sugar and spice into a saucepan and heat. <#> Add the apples and cook for 1-2 minutes stirring to coat and soften the apples. <#> Add the blackberries and leave to cool. </p><p> <#> NB If the berries are ripe and full of juice then the addition of 1/2 oz cornflour to the fruit will help to prevent the pastry becoming soggy during cooking. </p><p> <#> Roll out two thirds of the pastry and use to line an eight inch pie dish. <#> Brush the base of the pastry with beaten egg to seal it during cooking. <#> Add the apples and blackberries, draining off some of the juices. </p><p> <#> Roll out the remaining third of pastry into a circle eight inches in diameter. <#> Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg, and place on the pastry top. <#> Seal the edges together. </p><p> <#> Brush with beaten egg again and bake at 375F, 190C, gas mark 5 for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. </p><p> <#> Serve dusted with caster sugar. </p><p> <#> If liked the pastry for the top of this pie can be cut into narrow strips and latticed across the top. </p><h> <#> <bold> Very Irish Potato Apple Cake </bold> </h><p> <#> This is a very traditional Irish dish, and one I often make as a comforting snack. <#> I like to serve this slightly buttered and dusted with caster sugar. <#> The cake tastes even better if you warm them in the oven until the butter is melted. </p><p> <#> 225g/1/2 lb cooked potatoes <#> 1/2 tsp salt <#> 50g/2 oz flour <#> 2 cooking apples peeled and finely diced <#> 1 dsp lemon juice <#> 30g/1 oz demerara sugar <#> 1/2 tsp cinnamon butter and caster sugar to serve <#> 30g/1 oz melted butter to spread on top </p><p> <#> Into a bowl place the chopped apple, cinnamon, demerara sugar and lemon juice. <#> Cover and leave to sit, and prepare the potato cake. <#> This dish is easier to make if the potatoes are still warm. </p><p> <#> Cook and finely mash the potatoes. <#> Add the salt and pepper and gradually work in the flour until the dough becomes very pliable. <#> On a floured board, roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick and cut into circles about 3 <*> inches sign </*> in diameter. </p><p> <#> Cover one round with the apple mixture, damp the edge and cover with the second piece. <#> Seal the edges with a fork or pinching with your fingers. <#> Cook on the griddle until golden brown. <#> Alternatively this dish can also be cooked in the oven, gas mark 4/190C/375F for 20 minutes. </p><h> <bold> <#> Braised Hot Pickled Red Cabbage with Apples </bold> </h><p> <#> 1 medium red cabbage, shredded <#> 350g/12 oz cooking apples, peeled and sliced <#> 1 onion finely diced <#> 115g/4 oz demerara sugar <#> 570 ml/1 pint water or vegetable stock <#> 1/4 pint red wine <#> 2 dsp cider vinegar <#> 1 dsp cooking oil <#> 50g/2 oz raisins <#> pinch salt and pepper </p><p> <#> In a large pan saute the onions in the oil, add the cabbage, apples, sugar, salt and pepper and toss. <#> Next add the stock, red wine, cider vinegar and stir well. <#> Place the lid on the pan and simmer gently for 60-80 minutes until tender. <#> This dish can also be braised in the oven. <#> Ten minutes before serving, add the raisins, allowing them to plump up nicely before serving hot. </p><h> <bold> <#> Autumn Apple Chutney </bold> </h><p> <#> This chutney brings the flavours of autumn together in a mouthwatering way. </p><p> <#> 450g/1 lb apples, cored and diced <#> 225g/1/2 lb tomatoes chopped <#> 450g/1 lb plums, stoned and diced <#> 1 crushed clove of garlic <#> 280ml/ 1/2 pint distilled vinegar <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb demerara sugar <#> 225g/ 1/2 lb golden sultanas <#> 1 tsp each mixed spice and ginger </p><p> <#> Prepare the fruits and place in an aluminium pan with all ingredients except the sugar. <#> Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature and add the sugar, stir until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer gently until the chutney shows signs of thickening. <#> Cool, then pack into clear, sterile jars. <#> Makes approx 4 lbs. </p><h> <bold> <#> Baked Apple Pudding </bold> </h><p> <#> One of my favourite autumn puddings, which combines the flavour of old-fashioned, simply baked apples with toasted almond sponge. </p><p> <#> Vanilla sauce makes a lovely accompaniment. </p><p> <#> 115g/4 oz butter or margarine <#> 115g/4 oz soft brown sugar <#> 3 eggs, lightly beaten <#> 115b/4 oz self-raising flour <#> 85g/3 oz lightly toasted ground almonds <#> 8-10 whole cloves <#> 4-6 small rosy eating apples <#> rind of one lemon </p><p> <#> To make the cake mixture, cream the fat and sugar until soft and fluffy. <#> Whisk the eggs into the butter and sugar lightly but thoroughly, a little at a time. </p><p> <#> Whisk in the grated lemon rind and mix in the toasted ground almonds, cloves and self-raising flour. </p><p> <#> Transfer to a lightly greased serving dish and arrange the apples in the sponge mixture, then bake at 180C/350F Gas Mark 4 for 25-30 mins until cooked. <#> Serve hot with vanilla sauce. </p><h> <bold> <#> Vanilla Sauce </bold> <h><p> <#> 1 vanilla pod or few drops of vanilla extract <#> 30g/1 oz caster sugar <#> 4 egg yolks <#> 570ml/1 pint milk </p><p> <#> Place the vanilla pod with the sugar and leave the flavour to impart (at least 30 mins). <#> As an alternative, a few drops of vanilla extract can be added to the sugar and left for the same length of time. <#> Beat the eggs and sugar together until smooth and creamy. <#> Warm the milk in a saucepan and pour over the eggs. <#> Mix well and return to the saucepan. </p><p> <#> Over a very gentle heat stir until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. <#> It is important to keep the temperature low during the making of this sauce, otherwise it will curdle. <#> Serve warm. </p></I>
