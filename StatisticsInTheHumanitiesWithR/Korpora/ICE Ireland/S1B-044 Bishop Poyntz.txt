<ICE-IRE:S1B-044 Bishop Poyntz><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Samuel Poyntz Church of Ireland Bishop of Connor told his Diocesan Synod in Belfast this morning <,> he 's a disappointed man <#> He attempted to set up a body to help Protestant areas uh come up with schemes to seek financial aid from various funds <,> for example the International Fund <#> Only a handful <,> of professional people were prepared to help <#> Uh the Bishop told his diocese <,> we have much to learn from the Roman Catholic Church <#> He also hit out at intolerance <,> racketeering <,> the staking out of territory through pavement painting and gable wall murals <#> He praised cross-community ventures <#> Obscenity <,> pornography <,> nudity <,> bad language <,> violence all incurred the wrath of the Bishop <#> So too alienation <,> not just of the orange green variety <,> the gap between the haves and the have-nots <#> Bishop Poyntz when I talked to him this morning didn't draw back from criticism of the Protestant professional classes for their indifference when asked to help the disadvantaged<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> I 've always felt that there 's a lack of cohesiveness about the Protestant communities in Belfast <#> Uh the one of the great differences between the Falls Road and the Shankill Road is that the Falls Road is uh has a great community area I think bound together not probably politically but religiously whereas if you go to other areas like the Shankill or other areas there 's a a we 've got that sort of Protestant individualism <#> And uhm I I <,> I I see enormous strides being made in other areas <,> tremendous funds being poured into other areas and quite rightly so too <#> And it seemed to me that perhaps we weren't getting our act together <#> And that we should look for uhm uh expertise people like maybe solicitors and bankers and trade unionists and community workers and retired civil servants other people like that who might be help help us and help clergy and parishes uh in formulating schemes and <#> Yeah I 'm afraid I my my appeal didn't meet with any great uh response <#> Perhaps uh it 's just uh that we are indifferent or perhaps it 's the difficulty getting people to own an idea <#> Maybe I didn't sell it properly<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> How how many replies did you get from professionals<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> <.> Un </.> Unfortunately I only had three<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Only three<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Now perhaps uh the feeling is or the perception is that Protestant areas generally are or have been better served both in employment and and facilities <#> Maybe that 's the reason<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> Well if that 's the the people are completely out of touch <#> I mean uh the the the unemployment in I in in in our ghetto areas is just as bad as in Belfast as any other area I would say <#> And it doesn't make any difference whether you 're on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road <,> uh I I uh or you you 'll find an enormous uh amount of unemployment<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Now you you mentioned this uh Roman Catholic community and the <,> <{1> <[1> cohesion </[1> and and the efforts to obtain you mentioned grants going to places like Poleglass the New Lodge I think North Howard Street something in the region of fifteen million pounds <#> And uh <.> y </.> you 've been saying that you admire their <{2> <[2> success </[2> <#> I mean I I I am sure and I accept it is admire and not covet<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> <[2> Yup </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> Oh no I it 's it 's quite admire <#> I feel that they have got their their their act together <#> And uh look at the scheme in Poleglass valued at five point one million <#> <.> i </.> it it it obviously has <.> invol </.> uh involved a lot of people who have got the project right and have thought it out and prepared the whole ground well <#> I 'm quite certain money is there at the government level but you must get your act together<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Yes but but your comments about Protestant disadvantage and the need for uh support both financial and skilled echo the views of uh a man I interviewed the other day former UDA man Glen Barr <#> You were were at one <{> <[> with his views on this one </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> <[> Yes <,> yes </[> </{> indeed I would be <#> Indeed I would be <#> And I I believe that there 's tremendous goodwill out there <#> There I I believe I 'm sure there 's goodwill in the government <#> I 'm sure there 's goodwill in in forms like the <.> Ir </.> the the Ireland Fund <#> Uh all sorts of other <.> t </.> funds have got to be tapped <#> And I 'm I was delighted uh on to see on on yesterday 's paper that uhm there 's another uh substantial sum of money being pumped into making Belfast work <#> Already a hundred and twenty-four million has been pumped in uhm to to various areas and I 'm delighted that but we must sort of think things through and and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Uh <.> th </.> there 's a psychology in this one Bishop perhaps that has to be looked at and and and it is this <#> May I put this point to you that uh Protestants perhaps fear <,> uh that to advance along these lines is to challenge authority and that in some way would diminish loyalty uh to the State and to the Crown <#> You see it 's all about a statement of nationality and religion and belonging <#> And some things are said to me in the course of this programme when we talk about grants and disadvantage <,> if only the other lot knew what side their bread was buttered on they wouldn't be doing this they wouldn't be taking all this money from the State and the Crown <,> <#> You must be aware of that stream of thinking<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> There is a sore sense of pride that you don't admit <#> I 'm quite certain that large numbers of people uh when when they <.> w </.> they had appalling housing on the Shankill Road never admitted that they were in appalling housing twenty and twenty-five years ago <#> But suddenly as a result of a whole lot of things happening in the outside world they began to see that their lot was just as bad as other people 's lots and so forth <#> And uhm <,> I think that we 're now sort of uh uh in we now in a situation where there 's all sorts of alienation <#> We so often talk about the alienation of the uh Roman Catholic or Nationalist community with Britain but there 's even an alienation now I think between <.> be </.> between Loyalists and Unionists from Britain an an alienation even between the haves and the have-nots <#> And I think that so often uh in in the Protestant areas especially you find that the the poverty lies behind swathes of area of considerable affluence <#> And we must be we must be aware of this and we must try and bring uhm a cohesion of the situation whereby something is done to ameliorate this situation<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Now let me ask you uh uh briefly about some other aspects of of your address and <,> uh the moral crusade if I may so describe it <#> You you uh deliver an attack on obscenity <,> nudity <,> pornography <,> lack of privacy but don't <,> these uh don't those things pale set beside the obscenity of murder <,> violence <,> intolerance <,> bigotry and hate <#> The real villains of the piece in this community<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> Well of course obscenity <.> f </.> where does obscenity flourish most <#> It flourishes in the areas of sexuality <,> of cruelty and violence <#> The whole three are connected up together <#> And indeed uh uh uh very often it is sometimes <,> uh racketeering and paramilitary racketeering that uh cashes in on the shortcomings of other people <#> And we have heard of that uh of of them uh pirating uh videos and things like that to sell for their for their own ill-gotten gain and so forth <#> And uhm I I think that uhm <,> that that really there 's only a a a a thin paper wall between those three areas of sexuality cruelty and violence<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> So you you think that there there has to be a reconstruction as it were of moral values in the community<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> No I think the moral values are there but the facts are that <.> so </.> uhm uh so much has been happening in the community uhm through things like uhm uhm much more of uhm uh use of video and and film and so forth <,> uh and the cashing in on obscenity <#> I think that uh the film industry for years was in in some decline and now has uh through through the use of way-out producers have now begun to uhm uh produce <,> uhm films uh which have been condemned by a large circle of people <#> I mean Lord Rees-Mogg recently uhm sounded criticism of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's uh Terminator films <#> And so many other films too seem to highlight violence <#> I mean you 've only got to go to Silence of the Lambs and so forth <#> And people are beginning to I think see that the whole swing of the pendulum has gone far too far <,> and that that it begets violence<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Yes I I just been uh <.> gl </.> glancing through uh your uh address <#> Homosexuality I don't think is mentioned is it<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> Well I there 's a limit to what you can mention <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> No it 's just that the Moderator touched <{1> <[1> on it </[1> recently and said this this is a sin do not call it by any <{2> <[2> other </[2> name <#> Would you feel the same<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> <[1> Yeah well I </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> No I think that I wouldn't ah I think that certainly it can be called sin certainly but there 's also a question that people are are are uh find themselves with these genes in their bodies and so forth and they 've got to learn to live with it <#> It 's only when it 's uh it 's only when it is uhm used wrongly <#> People cannot alter their genes <#> They can't alter their balance and so forth <#> I wouldn't want to go down that road too far but that wasn't <,> that wasn't the area which I was <.> d </.> dealing with in my address<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> You you talk about the portrayal of uhm somewhere you mention the portrayal of the the sexual act either on <{> <[> stage </[> or or or on films<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> Yes privacy I think today is under threat <.> aw </.> from all sorts of angles whether you think in terms of bugging devices and uh and uh many other ways and so forth <,> <#> Is there not an inner sanctuary in a person 's life or in a married couple 's life which ought not to be public property <#> And I think that there 's nothing wrong with uh as I tried to say this morning there 's nothing wrong in in nudity at all <#> Nobody 's ever saying anything there 's anything wrong with that <#> I mean you can look at many ancient uhm <,> uhm statues in in in Egypt <#> You can look at many Middle Ages paintings and so forth which focus on human sexuality which can be beautiful and thought to be in good taste <#> I think that sometimes we Christian people can damage our cause not a little by uh over-reacting to all that nudity thing <#> The body human body is God-given God-made <#> It is beautiful but what makes it pornographic is when someone presents it to be nastily suggestive and alluring <#> And I think that is one of the the great problems is that <,> people today are stoking the flames of lust uh and sort of giving the impression to get and not to give<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Yeah I 'm just wondering cos my last point is I wonder why <,> uh say a nude statue from ancient Greece would be considered beautiful and in good taste and perhaps a picture of an attractive young lady <,> in a newspaper would not <#> Is it because we are wrapping it up in a sort of classic package that it seems okay<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$B> <#> Well I think there 's there there is a sort of uh there can be I think an abuse of women to a titillation of of uh making them the object of uhm <,> the use of men and so forth <#> I think that uhm <,> you can uh exploit and dehumanise sex you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-044$A> <#> Well that was Bishop Poyntz and uh it 's his Diocesan <,> uh Meeting today and he spoke to me uh a little before that <#> Quite a number of issues there for you to think about</I>
