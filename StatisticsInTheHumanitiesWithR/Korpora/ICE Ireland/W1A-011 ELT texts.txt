<W1A-011 ELT texts><I><W1A-011$A><h> <#> Sue Mullins 06/02/02 </h><h> <#> Task One: </h><p> <#> a) The newspaper article in Extract A is simply used to present the topic of the lesson. <#> (Time capsules and what we will be viewed as in the future). <#> The 2 articles do not contain any examples of the grammar focus yet lead on nicely to the freer-speaking activity. <#> Thus, the purpose of these articles is not to present any language in context, but to generate interest in the topic and to give the students examples of what has already been stored in capsules so that they can perform the freer-speaking activity with more <}> <-> back-ground </-> <+> background </+> </{> information and hopefully produce more output. </p><p> <#> b) The letter is used to present the information needed for the dialogue in a more formal, written style. <#> The students must then transform the information into a more informal, spoken style. <#> The purpose of the letter in relation to ex. 1 is to get the students to think about appropriate language in varying contexts. </p><h> Task II </h><p> <#> The focus of the grammar exercises in 4 is the first conditional, use and usage. <#> It begins with only 2 example sentences in the box which, although related to the text, do not occur in context in the text. <#> This gives it the appearance of a quite mechanical, deductive approach. <#> However, the questions in 4.1 allow the students to work out the form and meaning in an inductive manner. <#> These type of questions will promote <}> <-> students </-> <+> students ' </+> </{> understanding of the target language if they have worked it out themselves. </p><p> <#> Ex. 4.1 concentrates on form as the students have to re-arrange the jumbled sentences. <#> By focusing on the syntax of the first conditional, students should hopefully be able to produce the target language more effectively. </p><p> <#> In Ex. 3, the focus is on differentiating the meaning of 'if' and 'when'. <#> This gap-fill provides 'mini' contexts to get the students to focus not only on use (sentence syntax) but also on usage (in what contexts do we exchange 'if' for 'when') </p><p> <#> Ex. 4 is a simple drill in which the pronunciation is already given. <#> This could have been approached in a more inductive manner by asking the students to tell you what they hear and what sounds are elided. </p><p> <#> Ex. 5 enables the students to practice the target structure in a controlled way before attempting the freer-speaking activity. <#> The students have already worked on the form and meaning, and have heard models of the target languages. <#> This is now their first chance to produce it and for the teacher to assess their strengths and weaknesses. </p><p> <#> These exercises encompass a bottom-up approach and are quite inductive despite their appearance and lack of context. </p><h> TASK III </h><p> <#> The pre-intermediate class I have in mind consists of 8 learners of mixed European nationalities and ages 17-40 <*> plus sign </*>. <#> They meet for only 4 hours per week yet are very keen, conscientious learners as they are mostly living and working (mostly au pairs) here in Belfast for up to one year. </p><p> <#> I think the reading and all the exercises that go with it are very usable; the questions begin with reading for gist and then reading for more specific detail, cumulating in a word hunt (matching definitions). <#> I would, however, introduce the topic through some pre-reading questions such as, <quote> "What has changed the most, in your opinion, between life now and life 100 years ago." </quote> <#> I would also get students to look at the headings and pictures to try to get them to predict the context of the articles and to focus on the style of newspaper headings. </p><p> <#> Grammar exercise 4, although good in its own right, does not flow from the reading as there are no examples of this in the text. <#> The first conditional is also not apparent in the guiding questions of the speaking activity and so I would leave this out altogether and use it with another text that actually contains examples of the target language. </p><p> <#> I would adapt the speaking activity slightly in that initially students work in pairs answering the questions in 5.1 but with a limited number of items (eg. 6) which the students must come to an agreement on. <#> Firstly, however I would try to pair the students, so that the more mature ones (40 <*> plus sign </*>) are working together as I think it could generate an interesting discussion on the values people of a different generation give to certain items. </p></I><I><W1A-011$A><h> <bold> <#> Pilot written exam - Sue Mullins </bold> </h><h> <it> <ul> <#> Task 2 </it> </ul> </h><p> <#> All three texts apparently come from the same source yet vary in difficulty. <#> The reason for this is mainly lexical and topical as the grammatical structures of imperatives for giving strong advice and the first conditional is dominant throughout texts A, B and C. </p><p> <#> Both texts A and B are of a more general nature in that they contain a lot of information that may seem to be common sense to the students. <#> Consequentially, the students can rely heavily on their background knowledge along with the pictures for guessing any unknown words, for example, 'garden shed, tools' etc. in Extract A. <#> However, as the majority of my students would not be car owners they may find the vocabulary in Extract C not only lexically dense (e.g ignition, log book, immobiliser, quarter lights, etc.) but also not very useful for everyday life. </p><p> <#> Text A contains a series of very short texts (1-2 sentences per picture) and this combined with the visual aid would make it the easiest in terms of lexical density and readability. <#> I would use this with Intermediate level or above. <#> Extract B goes into more detail and so the students would come across a higher percentage of unknown words, for example, phrases such as 'chat about, overhear, pay in advance, sling holdall, saddlebag,' etc. and the pictures would not necessarily provide the clues to help them guess successfully. <#> I would use this with Upper-Intermediate - Advanced. <#> Text C contains so many 'unuseful' vocabulary items due to its specific nature that I would be reluctant to use it at all. <#> However, I would also class this as Upper-Intermediate - Advanced. </p><h> <it> <ul> <#> Task 3 </it> </ul> </h><p> <#> I would use Extract A for an integrated skills lesson with an intermediate general English class that I have been teaching for three months now. <#> The class consists of 6 students of mixed nationalities - 2 Japanese, 1 HK, 1 Taiwanese, 1 Spanish and 1 Columbian. <#> They are all very hard-working and often stay after class to consolidate what they have learnt that day. <#> They integrate well together as a class and in smaller units and the stronger members of the group (Spanish and HK) are very willing to help the others. </p><h> <it> <#> Lead-In 1 - </it> </h> <p> <#> I would initially get students interested in the topic by asking them to compare measures of household security that are typical in their country and ask them to recount any stories they may have of break-ins, etc. <#> This stage will activate their schemata and hopefully produce some <}> <+> of </+> </}> the vocabulary needed for the text. </p><h> <it> <#> Lead-In 2 - <it> </h> <p> <#> I would then ask them to examine the title 'How householders help house-breakers' and predict the content. </p><h> <it> <#> Listening - <it> </h> <p> <#> Next the students would be given a set of jumbled pictures and listen to a recording of the text in order to number the pictures as they hear them to improve their listening for gist and so that they do not concentrate on every word of the text as they are prone to do. </p><h> <it> <#> Reading for detail and Vocabulary - </it> </h> <p> <#> Then I would provide them with the pictures and text and ask the students to read in detail whilst underlining any words they do not know. <#> They would then have to guess the meaning <ul> before </ul> checking their dictionary. <#> We could then discuss their strategies of what they guessed correctly and how. </p><h> <it> <#> Grammar - </it> </h> <p> <#> Next I would ask the students to list the constructions involved in giving strong advice, e.g. 'Never leave, make sure, see they 're fitted, don't leave, it 's best to ...' etc. <#> I would then set some controlled grammar practice activities possibly involving a similar gapped text where students must fill in an appropriate verb phrase and adverb of frequency. </p><h> <it> <#> Writing - </it> </h> <p> <#> I would then set a similar writing task, e.g. 'Dangers of Travelling' and ask the students to gather ideas in group about advice for travellers. <#> They should then start writing their advice in pairs and edit each <}> <-> others </-> <+> other 's </+> </}> work. </p><h> <it> <#> Homework - </it> </h> <p> <#> The students must make a poster including pictures to accompany the text to be put on the TEFL Centre wall. </p></I><I><W1A-011$A><h> <#> Name: Sue Mullins </h><h> <#> Date: 12/01/02 </h><h> <bold> <it> <#> Question 2 Task 3 </it> </bold> </h><h> <bold> <it> <#> Class Profile </bold> </it> </h><p> <#> The class consists of 6 'high' elementary learners. <#> They are: <#> 2 S. Korean women <#> 1 Chinese women <#> 1 Japanese woman <#> 1 young male from Hong Kong <#> 1 young female from Columbia <#> This particular group of learners work very well together; they are hard-working and make excellent progress because of their use of strategies such as 'inferring meaning'. <#> Only the Hong Kong boy relies heavily on his dictionary as his level is slightly below the others but they are happy to share their knowledge with him. <#> Fairly high-level vocabulary and grammatical constructions are to be found in the text such as, 'precautions, general practitioner, vaccination, cope with' and the use of the gerund on Line 36, etc. <#> I have chosen this group because the text would be quite difficult for other elementary learners who were not prepared to infer meaning. </p><h> <bold> <it> <#> Exploiting the Text </it> </bold> </h><p> <#> I would introduce the topic of the text by getting students into two groups to talk about holidays they have had, any illnesses on holiday, and what medicine they would typically bring with them, etc. <#> Then, as the text contains quite a number of high-level vocabulary for elementary, I would divide the students into groups A,B, and C with each group reading a different column of text ('Take Good Care', 'Safety First' and 'Bon Voyage'). <#> I would then check each groups ' understanding of the text and deal with vocabulary by encouraging them to infer meaning. <#> Next, the students should team up with members from the other groups and orally share the advice they have read. <#> As a form of feedback, I would ask them to report back on the advice they would/would not follow. </p><p> <#> I would then devise exercises to focus on the unique style of the leaflet as it is quite distinct. <#> For example, the language is 'to the point' and direct, bullet points are employed and various ways of giving advice can be noted such as imperatives, infinitives of purpose, etc. <#> Here are a few examples that I would focus on: <#>(L1) To enjoy the sun ... you need a little sun know how. <#> (L6) To take care of your skin, there 's no need to stay out of the sun for good. <#> (L15) Don't use vegetable oil <#> (L17) Take extra care of children <#> (L18) Remember, you can burn... <#> (L54) Make sure you ... </p><p> <#> I would also draw students ' attention to the ordering and importance of the information because this also adds to the style and the L2 learners should be made aware of variation in style even from the early stages. </p><p> <#> As a follow-up, I would ask students to prepare their own leaflet and personalise it by giving it a heading such as 'Advice for Foreigners Preparing to Study in Belfast for the First Time'. </p></I><I><W1A-011$A><h> <ul> <#> Sue Mullins </ul> - 10/04/02 </h><h> <ul> <#> Task 1 </ul> </h><p> <#> a) The purpose of the text is to present the grammar focus '<}> <-> definate </-> <+> definite </+> </}> and <}> <-> indefinate </-> <+> indefinite </+> </}> articles' in context. <#> The text has been constructed specifically for this purpose as the examples are clearly laid out. <#> It combines elements of both deductive and inductive in that the rules are clearly given, yet the student must choose which rule is being applied. <#> The text is helping them to notice when and where to use articles and encourages cognitive thinking as they have to work things out for themselves. </p><p> <#> b) The usefulness of the Grammar Reference section is limited because of the specific terminology and the information over-load. <#> It is useful, however, in relation to this short text as the no. of examples of articles are limited and the students are not required to read every rule but rather to scan the Grammar Section for the appropriate answer. <#> Any activity requiring more detailed analysis of the Grammar Section would be a chore for the students and a case of too much information all at once. <#> It would hinder their ability to apply the rules if they were not first limited and shown in context. </p></I>
