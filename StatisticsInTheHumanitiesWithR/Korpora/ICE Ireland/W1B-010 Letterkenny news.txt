I suppose. <#> As she says herself. <#> It will be good to have something to get up for. </p><p> <#> Hope you got over your disappointment (Bike). <#> Andy was all sad for you. <#> Did you hear about the ten students from Trinity who went on Safari to Kenya. <#> Two girls aged 21 yrs. were killed. <#> They would have been graduating next year - Engineering. <#> The jeep it seems overturned. <#> A young life thrown away. </p><p> <#> Deirdre has gone to Killybegs on a cookery course. <#> Roger was saying to Betty that she wouldn't be long in it. </p><p> <#> Students are not allowed into Sr. Eva 's or the Metropolitan. <#> (meaning Reginal, I suppose). <#> This letter came today so here goes. <#> I rang "King 's Inn" and was told you require to do Irish Constitutional Law from Sept. until May then you can do the exam. </p><p> <#> Natalie I 'm off now to post this. <#> Hope all is well with you.

Do you know why the squirrel swims on his back <#> (a.) He doesn't want to get his <ul> nuts </ul> wet. <#> No, I 'm not going to explain the joke this time. <#> Cheryl Irvine got married today. <#> Do you remember the twit. <#> He 's Italian John 's son Benjamin is marrying a Wren. <#> Catherine Wren is her name and guess the name of her parents house 'TWO BEAKS' <#> It suits doesn't it. </p><p> <#> Belinda Braithwaite is working in Magee 's Chemist. <#> She 's glad she got out of 'Mace' - High Rd. <#> We saw Edna McAfee yesterday. <#> She 's a tough woman as fat as fat can be, but she didn't forget to give us a big wave. </p><p> <#> I see in the paper that Tommy Neale Carnamuggah is up on a drugs charge. </p><p> <#> I heard there 's a guy very ill in hospital as a result of having his drink spiked. <#> It 's getting very common now. </p><p> <#> Did you hear about the women in Raphoe. <#> There was some kind of a fight and the guards were called. <#> As soon as they arrived at the house she starts OI! OI! I smell bacon. <#> Go back to the pig house where you came from. - to the guards. <#> She 's in big trouble. </p><p> <#> Natalie, I 'm laughing here. <#> You can sing now.<#> My old man 's a Dutchman<#> He wears a Dutchman 's hat<#> He wears old grimy trousers<#> And he lives in a Dutchman 's flat. </p><p> <#> Good luck to you and hope all works out about the flat. <#> It should be warmer. <#> I can just picture the two of you in the Mercedes. </p><p> <#> Love from all here - <&Irish> agus mise fos. </&Irish> <#> I hope the good Lord will look after you both. </p><#> Mum XX<h> P. S. </h><p> <#> I rang the Institute and 15th November is the deadline for application. <#> She said anything after that will be disqualified. <#> Anyhow she is sending out an application form to this address. </p><p> <#> Betty is on her 2nd day at work and loves it. <#> She 's up at 7.15 a.m and works from 8.30 a.m till 5.30 p.m. <#> They get five breaks 2 twenty mins. 2 fifteen mins and 1 half-hr. <#> It 's great to see her getting up in the morning. <#> She 's working to 7 p.m to-night and Sat. until 10 o'clock - that 's overtime. <#> A girl - BAT she 's called (Christian name - Siobhan) from upwards of Lurgybrack started same day so they are very <ul> pally. </ul> <#> It might help her to get rid of that other <ul> twit. </ul> <#> She got a lift with Dara McDermott yest. evening. </p><p> <#> You know Anne O'Dwyer who works in "Derry People". <#> Well, her son 16 yrs. hanged himself on Mon. morning (yesterday). <#> Isn't that awful. <#> What is wrong at all, pressures I suppose. </p><#> Tar - a - Natalie. <#> Must Run.<#> Mum XXX.</I><I><W1B-010$A><h> Tues. </h><p> <#> Dear Natalie,<p> Usually, I 'd have a letter mailed by now, but I 've been very sick. <#> It hit me so suddenly terrible pains and violent headache. <#> I 'm on antibiotics and still have the awful sore head <*> ampersand sign </*> dizziness. <#> Never have I been so sick. <#> Doc. says it 's a virus. <#> I swore it was meningitis but who knows. <#> Anyhow I just had to write today to keep you in touch. </p><p> <#> A son of John Sheridans was attacked. <#> Sorry, I just remember I told you on the 'phone. <#> The assailant was a tinker and got over the border. <#> A guy was sacked in Betty 's job. <#> He was caught at the lockers. <#> Another lady got the walk for stealing sweets. </p><p> <#> Why is a Politician like a baby 's nappy. <#> The both are full of shit. </p><p> <#> We have the nurses strike today. <#> The Picket was set up at 8 a.m 27 1/2 thousand nurses. <#> God help anyone who has to go to hospital. </p><p> <#> You 'd think Skip knew there was something afoot for him as he 's started queuing at the back door when he needs to go to the <ul> toilet. </ul> <#> Remember the story (true one) about the man going to shoot the dog and the dog ran away and never came back. </p><p> <#> I hear Brendan Darcy is not so well. <#> He has the same as Larry had. <#> I was just saying his poor wife never had a holiday (leisure) always looked so tired and worn and now when the family are grown up her husband has to be nursed. </p><p> <#> Julia <unclear> 2 words </unclear> daughter has had her twins. <#> A boy <*> ampersand sign </*> girl. <#> The wee boy was born without one eye. <#> There is an eyelash and a socket but minus the eye. <#> I feel so sorry for them. <#> DR. McDermott told them he had never seen anything like it before, all the years he is in practice. <#> They didn't want anyone to know at the start but they had to tell it eventually. <#> You know, I was sick when I got that news and all through the night that 's all I saw - the baby 's face. <#> Poor wee pet it 's not fair. <#> Could you imagine the shock they got. </p><p> <#> McCarry 's off Licence has been taken over as a Xmas Day shop, moving bloody Santas looking out the window and it 's only Oct. <#> Oh! by the way, I tried Rachel 's number many, many times without success. <#> Rang again yest. and here she was answering the phone. <#> So, I told her I had a Confession <*> ampersand sign </*> an apology. <#> Oh! she couldn't recollect anything (by the way) but she was so nice and spake so well, seemed real friendly. <#> She asked me when were you coming and when I told her she said Oh! that's great, can't wait to see her again. <#> So now, put your mind at rest. </p><p> <#> Sixteen houses are being built behind Jimmy Mullins. (in that field) <#> I can't understand Jimmy letting go his privacy. <#> Dom saw the planning application so it 's true. </p><p> <#> There 's a huge supermarket-come shopping centre started between Dunnes Stores <*> ampersand sign </*> Daly 's monuments. <#> No wonder people say Letterkenny is going to choke. </p><p> <#> The new Theatre has opened. <#> It 's beautiful. <#> Dom <*> ampersand sign </*> I are at it often dressed in our finest gear!!! </p><p> <#> Annette in Vivaldi 's is pregnant again. <#> She 's going out with a Belfast man. </p><p> <#> Speaking of Belfast, there was an attempt made on a Post office on the Ballysillan Rd. yest. <#> Sledge Hammers were used and the man inside fired a shot and killed one of the raiders. <#> There 's a big "He Haw" about it. </p><p> <#> A fellow from Letterkenny won a million pounds in the Lotto. <#> He 'd just built a house and seeing he 's married he will look after it (the money). </p><p> <#> A taximan here shot the Runway I mean the Roundabout out the road - went right over it. <#> He damaged the car to the tune of <*> pound sign </*> 30,000. <#> No wonder I don't trust them. </p><p> <#> The astronomer (Faith) was telling me that Angela Sullivan is taking the death very badly. <#> She doesn't go out now. <#> It 's all a shock at the time but when the crowds leave reality sets in and more especially now at this time of year. </p><p> <#> It 's just 67 days till Xmas wouldn't that sicken you. <#> It will take the back seat this year with the <}> <-> millenium </-> <+> millennium </+> </}> on the horizon. <#> Fred Kilbane has bought a site on the De Valera Rd. (opposite here) for a fire station. <#> They hope to start it next year. <#> Billy O'Dea will be having an Erection every time the bugle blows (now, I mean the fire siren!!). <#> They will be too close for comfort. </p><p> <#> Suzie has vamoosed and Gorteen lives on - happily. <#> I have so many bad memories of her. <#> She used to shoot out loud from the bottom of the road. <#> Aye!! Rosie Mulligan. <#> Oh. <#> years ago when she was at her worst. <#> Time works wonders, I say. <#> Maire (next door) has got a fecking cat and I walked into the front room yest. and there she was. <#> I nearly died. <#> Came in the window. <#> I 'll get her some day with the brush. </p><p> <#> I hear Cormac is back. <#> He 'll be trying to sneak back to the house now, seeing the old pair have gone. <#> Betty says Roger is very nice. </p><p> <#> A form came from the Royal Mail. <#> I don't know whether to post it or not. <#> Maybe I will. <#> It will give you a better chance. </p><p> <#> Betty tells me there 's rats in Wilowbrook - Carlotta 's place. <#> They ate their couch. <#> I would go crazy. <#> I wouldn't sleep in the damned place. <#> That site is too low lying anyhow. <#> The guy who Andy Joe went to see in Australia has arrived home bag <*> ampersand sign </*> baggage. <#> His wife is a sister (nurse) and has got a job in L/Kenny. <#> He 's a Civil Engineer and has got work in Derry and they 've bought a house in Letterkenny. </p><p> <#> How are you getting on out there? </p><p> <#> I just hope you have the same address. <#> We have lovely weather here. <#> Looks like late Summer. </p><p> <#> Ring on Friday around 4 p.m. <#> That 's the best time. </p><p> <#> Look - a - loo and good luck.<#> Mum X </p><p><#> Excuse writingblame it on the tablets.</p></I>
