<W2B-017 Drugs - Child abuse><I><W2B-017$A><h> <bold> <#> Chasing the Dragon </bold> </h><h> <bold> <#> Heroin has once again exploded onto the streets of the capital. <#> TS O'Rourke talks to one addict about his love of drugs and the problems of kicking the habit. <#> We also report on a community that is fighting back and hear the opinions of <}> <-> on </-> <+> one </+> </}> youngster who has already seen the <}> <-> devasting </-> <+> devastating </+> </}> effects of drugs at age 13. </bold> </h><p> <#> JOHNNY (an alias) is in his late twenties and has been a heroin user for over eleven years. <#> His somewhat gaunt and menacing appearance is the result of some hard times. </p><p> <#> I met Johnny in a central Dublin pub, where we talked for an hour over a quiet pint. <#> Explaining that he was just on his way up to Sean McDermott Street in order to buy some heroin, he said he would be back in a few minutes. <#> He left, anxious yet smiling. </p><p> <#> Fifteen minutes later, Johnny returned having purchased two 'Q' (quarter-gram) bags of heroin from a young man on a bicycle, who was doing a roaring trade. <#> Showing me the two little parcels of heroin, Johnny explained: <quote> "There 's loads of dealers in Sean McDermott Street, and if you know who to look for, you can get gear in a few minutes." </quote> <#> He then proceeded to go into the gents ' toilets, from where he emerged a little later, having smoked one of the two deals. <#> The pub 's clientele were completely oblivious. </p><p> <#> This is nothing new to Johnny, who was first tempted to inject heroin by friends in Dolphin 's Barn. <#> Less than a month later he was addicted, having used the drug on an almost-daily basis. </p><p> <#> He continues to use heroin because of what it does for him. <#> <quote> "You get an amazing feeling of well-being, and you don't have any worries. <#> Most other drugs have an uplifting effect - this is more of a mellow feeling. <#> Everything feels great and you don't care about anything." </quote> </p><p> <#> As you might have guessed, Johnny has paid for his addiction. <#> Convicted four times, he has spent time in Dublin 's Mountjoy Prison. <#> <quote> "I 've been convicted of robbery with violence and selling drugs to get money." </quote> <#> A heroin habit is extremely expensive, and Johnny got his money for drugs <quote> "basically by breaking into houses, stealing videos, robbing garages, mugging people and armed robbery." </quote> </p><p> <#> <quote> "I didn't care where the money came from." </quote> </p><p> <#> Speaking of his time spent in Mountjoy, he said: <quote> "Mountjoy is a dump - you wouldn't put a pig in the place. <#> You 're only allowed out for six hours during the day - it 's not a nice place to be." </quote> <#> However, drugs are readily available, and Johnny admits that they help you to do your time. <#> Apparently you can get anything you want in Mountjoy. <#> <quote> "There are various ways of smuggling drugs into Mountjoy - the security there is very lax - and a lot of the screws turn a blind eye to it." </quote> </p><p> <#> Despite widespread knowledge that the HIV virus can be transmitted through sharing syringes, addicts in Mountjoy continue to share their 'works' with one another, with up to 30 people using one syringe. <#> <quote> "Mainly it 's injected by prisoners in the toilets or in the recreation area - you 'd see up to ten people in a cubicle using the one syringe. <#> If you 're in the grips of a drug, you don't care what way it comes." </quote> </p><p> <#> As prisoners are only subjected to a strip search - and not a cavity search - smuggling drugs in is not a problem. <#> For many prisoners, repeated court appearances can be lucrative, as friends or relatives pass heroin packages to them, which they can either use or sell once they return to the prison. </p><p> <#> The best way to hide heroin is in your mouth, according to Johnny. <#> <quote> "The Garda&/i can't force you to open your mouth - they can only search your clothes - so it 's easy. <#> I 've been stopped a few times and searched by the police with heroin in my mouth." </quote> </p><p> <#> The importation of heroin, although illegal, continues daily. <#> Using couriers, the drug bosses import at least 20 to 30 ounces a week. <#> Couriers are usually paid in drugs. <#> <quote> "There 's great profit to be made - they bring in 60 per cent pure heroin, but by the time it gets onto the streets it 's only about 20 per cent pure." </quote> <#> Heroin is regularly cut with such innocuous substances as quinine or milk sugar, decreasing the purity and increasing the profit margin. </p><p> <#> Recently, users have taken to smoking the drug (<quote> "chasing the dragon" </quote> ) in an attempt to avoid contracting the HIV virus through intravenous use. </p><p> <#> According to many sources, the purity of the drug has almost doubled recently, and the price has also dropped. <#> This, Johnny believes, is to lure back users by giving them a better hit while smoking it. <#> Unfortunately, this has also led to an increased chance of accidental overdose for those unused to such pure heroin. </p><p> <#> As we were taking the accompanying photographs, a Garda sergeant walked right past, apparently oblivious to the presence of the drugs. <#> Johnny said: <quote> "Most people would be very surprised at how easily available heroin is in Dublin." </quote> <#> Commenting on the success rate of the Garda&/i, Johnny said: <quote> "They are fighting a losing battle. <#> They only seize about 2 per cent of the total amount imported, and there 's too much money involved for the drugs bosses to give it up." </quote> </p><p> <#> Johnny is only one of over 5000 reported heroin addicts in Ireland. <#> The Aruppe Society - who do work with homeless young people - estimates these addicts are responsible for over two-thirds of Ireland 's crime. </p></I><I><W2B-017$A><h> <#> Reclaiming the Community </h><p> <#> Meath Street, in the heart of Dublin 's south inner city, has long been depicted as a sort of urban 'badlands' where junkies and dealers congregate in large numbers and theft and violence are commonplace. </p><p> <#> Feargal Connolly, of the Meath Street-based Community Response project, is angered by the media 's negative stereotyping of the area. <#> <quote> "Headlines like 'South Inner City Like the Bronx' are written by people who don't come from the area and who don't care. <#> This sort of sensationalism doesn't do anything to help us improve our image, or deal with the drug problem." </quote> </p><p> <#> The response group - one of many nationwide - was set up in 1990, towards the end of the 1980s drug epidemic. <#> Once the epidemic had decreased in size and severity, there was no one organising against the big drug pushers. <#> This void was filled by the Community Response, amongst others. </p><p> <#> The main function of the group, as Connolly describes it, is <quote> "to develop a response within the community around drugs, HIV, AIDS and drug-related crime." </quote> <#> This is achieved through work in prevention - with schools, youth groups and training workshops - and by educating children about the options which are open to them. </p><p> <#> In the wake of recent events around the city involving vigilante tenants evicting known drug pushers, the general consensus appears to be one of sympathy amongst the residents. <#> Many people have seen whole families decimated by the scourge of drug abuse and, inevitably, AIDS. </p><p> <#> In the recent past, some residents have been holding meetings where accused pushers are given the chance to defend themselves before being told to leave the area. <#> It 's a case of leave, or be forced to leave. <#> Violence, however, is uncommon. <#> With the dealers rather than the users targeted, Feargal states: <quote> "We are always very wary that people who have a problem are not targeted in that process." </quote> </p><p> <#> Whatever way affected communities decide to deal with the big boys of the drug world, they can be sure of support from agencies and community groups, if not the politicians, who, in Feargal Connolly 's opinion, need to be <quote> "more accountable to the people" </quote> in the war against the big dealers. </p></I><I><W2B-017$B><h> <#> Fr Pat Buckley </h><h> <bold> <#> What are we to do with Child Abusers? </bold> </h><p> <#> MORE AND MORE cases of child sex abuse are emerging in Ireland. <#> The Catholic Church is dizzy as it tries to come to terms with the various complaints against its priests. </p><p> <#> Some victims have now issued writs in Belfast. <#> Cardinal Daly and Father Brendan <}> <-> Symth 's </-> <+> Smyth 's </+> </}> abbot, Kevin Smith, have been cited as defendants. <#> The Catholic Church in America has spent millions on legal settlements. <#> The Irish Church is probably facing similar bills. <#> But of course child sexual and physical abuse is by no means confined to priests and Christian Brothers: most of it takes place in families. </p><p> <#> Our primary sympathy must lie with the victims. <#> Many of them have grown up physically, but they will always carry the scars of the abuse. <#> Some of them will be condemned to living lives of great unhappiness as they mismanage relationships and find it impossible to trust. <#> The victims deserve the very best counselling and more than adequate compensation. </p><p> <#> But what are we to do with 'perpetrators'? <#> Some suggest that they should be castrated, others in anger would want to beat them up. <#> A few would even suggest the death penalty. </p><p> <#> Child abuse is a very serious crime. <#> Those who engage in it must expect to pay a very heavy price: society demands punishment and retribution. <#> A severe prison sentence seems just, but we should never allow ourselves to forget that in civilised societies punishment should be linked to rehabilitation. </p><p> <#> In the United States they place great emphasis on sex offenders engaging in rehabilitation programmes. <#> These are sometimes offered as an option to prison and the successful completion of a programme can lead to an early release. <#> Sometimes the programme will involve re-introducing the abuser into the life of the abused. <#> This can be the case particularly if the abused was a cherished family member. </p><p> <#> Very often it will emerge in therapy that the abusers themselves were victims of child abuse. <#> It seems that some victims grow up to be perpetrators. <#> This is especially sad, but it does show that child abuse happens sometimes as a result of human weakness and not badness. <#> Of course this is no excuse, but it is an explanation. </p><p> <#> We need our medical experts and our psychologists to do an awful lot more work on the causes of abuse. <#> And if it were to emerge that there was some genetic or compulsive psychological element, we would have an even greater responsibility to approach child abuse from the perspective of illness and treatment. </p><p> <#> Prison on its own is not the answer. <#> Far too many abusers re-offend after being in prison. <#> The Americans have proven that fewer re-offend after intensive therapy. </p><p> <#> There is a huge lack of programmes for abusers in Ireland. <#> That 's a very great pity. <#> One of the best ways to protect children in the future is to work with offenders so that they will not re-offend. <#> Victims have their support groups and their rape crisis centres - I 'm glad that they have - but I wish groups for the abusers were common. </p><p> <#> Perhaps we sometimes forget that the abusers are human beings too. <#> Many of them must have terrible problems to make them do the things they do. <#> Abusers are somebody 's flesh and blood; they are somebody 's son or daughter. <#> They were once innocent babies and children. <#> Something happened to them somewhere along the line to put them on such a disastrous road. <#> Those of us who profess Christianity have to remember also that God loves us all equally - no matter how low we sink. </p><p> <#> Child abuse is not a new phenomenon. <#> It was always there, but it was hidden. <#> It 's now coming out into the open. <#> That means that we all have to face up to it. <#> Our first responsibility is to the victims, but we also have a serious responsibility to care for the abusers. <#> If the abusers cooperate, we should give them all the help they need. <#> If they are not willing to take help, then perhaps there is a case for locking them away for a very long time, if only to protect the vulnerable. </p></I>
