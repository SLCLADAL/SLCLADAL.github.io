<W2B-005 Irish writing - Churches><I><W2B-005$A><h> <#> CHANGING STATES <#> transformations in modern Irish writing <bold> <#> Robert Welch </bold> </h><h> <#> Routledge </h><p> <#> The most annoying aspect of this book is that it claims to be, or aims to be, something which it is not. <#> To read the blurb one would be led to believe that Prof Welch has constructed a system in which the change from Gaelic to 20th-century, post-industrial culture in Ireland 's literature is examined and the effects of that change shown. <#> Hence, the reader goes through the various chapters with this in mind, only to discover that there is no common thread running through the work. <#> What we have, in fact, is a collection of interesting and enjoyable essays on Welch 's top 11 authors, with introductory chapters and a conclusion tacked on to give the book some sort of <it> raison d'&/\etre. </it> </p><p> <#> This, to say the least, is a frustrating experience. <#> At no time does Welch coherently, sufficiently, or logically develop his belief that the loss of Irish in some way deprives the Irish people of a unique <it> Weltanschauung. </it> <#> The Irish language, which appears to be central to his argument, drifts in and out of the collection like a badly-directed actor - now you see him, now you don't. <#> His belief that Irish culture is <quote> "deeply divided" </quote> because of the loss of the Irish language may or may not be true, but Welch never bothers to explain why he thinks it is. <#> Indeed, one could argue that it is very untrue. </p><p> <#> Contemporary Irish culture is predominately expressed in English and ruled by it. <#> The gap between culture in Irish and culture in English is so great that even the analogy of David and Goliath seems inadequate in describing it. <#> A gaggle of Goliaths versus a one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed David would seem more appropriate. </p><p> <#> The unrelenting attacks upon Irish as the <it> Zeitgeist </it> of nationalist Ireland, launched by the many cultural nationalists, have rendered redundant much of Welch 's argument that Irish is <quote> "a cultural system, full of signs and referents which call up associations and relations that are rooted in the past and are activated by the disposition and evocative power of the words we use". </quote> <#> These attacks have centred on stressing the everyday commonality of Irish as a language within the Gaeltacht, in an attempt somehow to remove Irish from the 'political arena' and denationalise it. <#> As a result, Irish has been reduced from being a language which 'embodies a national ideal' to being simply a language which 'ought to be protected'. <#> By continually stressing the language 's banality, those who wish to protect it as a cultural artefact run the risk that any romantic notions concerning the language as being the soul of Ireland are blown away. </p><p> <#> Welch argues that <quote> "The Irish ... committed linguistic suicide." </quote> <#> Perhaps. <#> But suicide implies that they thought they were giving up something which was valuable, that there was a <it> loss <it> involved. <#> The Irish, being a pragmatic bunch, may not have seen it that way and, if we are perfectly honest, still do not see it that way. <#> Many, I suspect, would identify with O'Connell 's pragmatism: </p><p> <quote> <#> I am sufficiently utilitarian not to regret its gradual abandonment ... <#> Therefore, although the Irish language is connected with many recollections that twine around the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communications, is so great that I can witness without a sigh the gradual disue of Irish. </quote> </p><p> <#> Recent opinion polls would indicate that the English-speaking Irish may let loose the occasional sigh for the language, but are still very reluctant actually to do anything to ensure its survival. </p><p> <#> The pressure to acquire English, now and in O'Connell 's time, means that communities did not commit suicide so much as make a conscious, if forced, decision to swap one language for another. <#> There is no evidence to suggest that this loss has ever really bothered the Irish people to the extent that those of us who speak the language would like to think. <#> The success of the Gaelic League at the turn of the century in English-speaking areas was not mirrored in Irish-speaking areas, and the lack of a widespread non-state language movement in most Gaeltacht areas would seem to prove further that the language holds little of value for many of its native speakers. </p><p> <#> The difference in outlook in Donegal between Irish-speaking Bunbeg and English-speaking Bundoran is zero. <#> There is no way one could seriously argue that if Irish were to cease being spoken in Bunbeg tomorrow the village would in some way be transformed into a pumpkin. <#> No one would notice. <#> The superstitions, folk-stories and lore of the Gaeltacht died with de Valera 's comely maidens. <#> While Welch argues that the poets Nuala N&/i Dhomhnaill and Michael Hartnett see the loss of Irish as <quote> "a cataclysmic <}> <-> clow </-> <+> blow </+> </}> to the psyche of the Irish people in that it ripped out and tore asunder all the secret interiors that sponsor the manifold activities that go to make up a culture" <quote> , it is not true of society in general. </p><p> <#> There is also something very odd in seeing M&/airt&/in O Cadhain and Se&/an O Ri&/aord&/ain bracketed with the likes of W B Yeats, George Moore and James Joyce. <#> They may have lived in the same country but they came from different worlds. <#> O Cadhain was of peasant Connemara stock, a committed republican and supporter of the Irish language. <#> Moore, Joyce and Yeats had absolutely nothing in common with him other than the business of writing. <#> They belonged to an urban, anglicised and anglophile <it> bourgeoisie </it> more interested in the pettier points of social status than the day-to-day reality of surviving. </p><p> <#> Their interest in Irish was fleeting - if that long. <#> They didn't need the language, they didn't use the language and to imply - as Welch does - that their work in some way benefited from the tension between two languages and two cultures is wrong. <#> Their work relied upon their imaginative ability in English and their view of literature was moulded by Victorian values. <#> Yeats ' summation of Irish as his national tongue yet English his native tongue neatly encapsulates his attitude to Irish - and that of his class. <#> What O Cadhain and his contemporaries wanted from, and demanded of, literature was far removed from what the middle-class and pre-Easter 1916 generation of English literature wanted. </p><p> <#> What Welch does succeed in doing is to muddy the waters every once and a while by dropping the occasional Irish pebble into his English-language pond. <#> Synge knew Irish, Heaney knows Irish and so does Friel. <#> Fair enough; but can they all be tied together by this very thin thread? <#> What Synge wrote about is not what Friel writes about and Heaney 's interest in Irish is peripheral. <#> Would he be any less a poet had he never heard a word of Irish? <#> Do you need Irish to watch one of Synge 's plays or Friel 's, or to read and understand Heaney 's work? </p><p> <#> No. </p></I><I><W2B-005$B><h> <#> HILLSBOROUGH <#> In the Churches at Christmas </h><p> <#> The four Sundays of Advent are days of preparation for the celebration of Christmas and Christ 's coming into the world. <#> During those days there are many opportunities to reflect on God 's love for the world and on the Light of Christ that still shines in many places of darkness. </p><p> <#> The 1992 Advent Sermon at Hillsborough Parish Church will be delivered by the Bishop of Down and Dromore, the Rt. Rec. Gordon McMullan. <#> The sermon, entitled "Going with the grain", will look at the human implications of the free market economy. <#> That will be at 11.00 a.m. on Sunday, 6th December. <#> On the same evening at 7.30 p.m. the village community will come together with children from the primary school for the switching on of the Christmas tree lights in the Church Square. </p><p> <#> During the weeks of Advent a toy collection is made for children in need. <#> New toys are placed in the church windows and then as Christmas comes the Salvation Army distribute them to homes where toys are scarce. </p><p> <#> On the last Sunday night of Advent, the Sunday before Christmas (20th December), the Christmas story is related in words and music and symbol in a Service of Lessons, Carols and Christingles. <#> The service comes to an end as the children carry lighted Christingles out into the darkness of the winter night and so herald the coming of the Light of Christ into the world. <#> Christmas is now very near. </p><p> <#> Christmas Day begins at Hillsborough on the stroke of midnight. <#> Then the bells ring out in celebration of the Day that Christ was born. <#> Worship continues that day with services at 8.30 a.m., 11.00 a.m. and 12 noon. </p><p> <#> My message to people this year is in this Advent Prayer: </p><p> <bold> <#> Grant, o God, as we rejoice in the hope of the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ so we may prepare the way for His Coming again by the joyful service and the faithful witness of our daily lives, and May the God of hope fill you with all Joy and Peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. <#> Amen. </bold> </p><h> <#> PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH </h><p> <#> christmas - the season of celebration and thanksgiving, when we remember the birth of Jesus! <#> It is a wonderful time, for the church and the community, but there is always the danger that we allow the traditional festivities to blind us to the awful surroundings that were that stable in Bethlehem and the dreadful plight of millions who are starving in our world today. <#> Even in the midst of the present recession, the church needs to confront people with the human tendency towards greed an its striking contrast to God 's pattern of giving. </p><p> <#> The Congregation of Hillsborough Presbyterian Church will once again this year be taking a special offering for World Development throughout the Christmas period. <#> In recent years over <*> pound sign </*> 2000 has been raised annually and we hope to exceed that in 1992. <#> But we hope to do much more. <#> the months leading up to Christmas we have been reflecting on some of the barriers that exist in today 's world and how they can be crossed "in Christ". <#> Our prayer is that in our own lives, in the life of our community and world, the message of the Angels will become a reality this Christmas: <quote> "Glory to God in the Highest and on earth Peace, Goodwill towards men." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Christmas activities and services in the congregation are as follows: <p> <#> Saturday, 5th December - Senior Citizens Party. </p><p> <#> Saturday, 12th December - Sunday School Parties. </p><p> <#> Sunday, 20th December - Family Services at 10 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. with music from the Junior Choir Festival of Lessons and Carols by Candlelight at 7 p.m. by the Senior Choir. <#> This Service will be followed by a supper served by the Young Women of the Congregation. </p><p> <#> Thursday, 24th December - Christmas Day Family Service at 10.30 a.m. </p><h> <#> ELIM PENTECOSTAL CHURCH </h><p> <#> a few minutes from the village of Hillsborough on the Moira Road is the Elim Pentecostal Church. </p><p> <#> Often referred to as the Church with a difference because of its lively praise and worship and belief that the church which is Christ 's body, should care for the community spirit, soul and body. <#> In doing so we hope to reflect God 's love and His comprehensive, caring nature. </p><p> <#> The spiritual needs of members are met in regular Sunday and mid-week services. <#> Activities arranged to cater for other needs include Youth Together (Sunday School), Youth Ministries, Boys Brigade, Girls Brigade, Teens Youth Club, Nursery School/Playgroup, Mums and Toddlers and a Coffee shop. </p><p> <#> The elderly have not been forgotten with visits in their homes from our team of Home Visitors, a weekly craft class and monthly Luncheon Club. <#> Adjacent to the church complex is one of our Elim Nursing Homes "Lisadian House" which provides an efficient, non-acute care unit for 29 frail and elderly residents in single bedrooms. </p><p> <#> Our aim is to demonstrate the love of Christ in every way possible to the local community in which we work and worship. <#> Christmas is a time of joy and a time of exchanging gifts. </p></I>
