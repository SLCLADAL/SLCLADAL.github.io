<W1B-009 From abroad><I><W1B-009$A><#> Long Island <#> 09/08/'97<p> <#> Dear Aoife, <#> How are you? <#> Hope all is well in Belfast. <#> Sorry that I didn't give you a call before I left but the week just seemed to fly by. <#> I was actually very busy. <#> My mother had me painting and I was also getting my CV together to send off for job applications. - <#> I spent about five days sitting at my desk writing covering letters. <#> I can't imagine anything more tedious. <#> If I don't get a job from this I 'm not applying for anymore!! </p><p> <#> Thank you so much for my birthday gift. <#> It was so thoughtful of you. <#> It arrived the day that I left so Mum forwarded it to me. <#> I was reading another book but I just started reading a few pages of 'Angela 's Ashes' and now I 've abandoned the other book! </p><p> <#> I had a very nice birthday. <#> Some of my relatives who are on Long Island came for lunch and I had a birthday cake etc. <#> Bill called me to wish me a happy birthday. <#> He also sent me flowers. <#> Isn't that so sweet? <#> It was quite a surprise! <#> I didn't think that Bill was the flower type!! <#> He 's called me a couple of times since and seems to be working very hard. <#> He 's quite stressed out now that he 's come to the real writing part of his thesis. <#> I 'm sure he 'll be fine though. <#> I do feel bad that he 's there almost all alone. <#> It must be so strange without 'the gang.' </p><p> <#> How are things with you? <#> Are you feeling less bored yet? <#> I think it would be a good idea to take a trip to Plymouth - Ken would be very excited to see you. <#> I could tell that he was missing you desperately after you left. <#> Do you know yet where you 'll be next year? <#> I hope that job at the department works out if your British Academy funding doesn't. </p><p> <#> Things are pretty good over here. <#> Jacqueline 's 8th birthday was yesterday so we have some of Paulet 's family visiting this weekend. <#> They are all leaving early tomorrow though, as are the Curtins. <#> They 'll be gone for about 10 days altogether so we 've got some time off. <#> Well, we do have to clean the house and change the beds etc but that shouldn't take 10 days!! <#> Although Paulet 's brother is coming this Thursday with 11 people for the weekend so we 'll probably have to clean again after they leave. </p><p> <#> I 'm going to give Charles and Julia and Desiree and Joseph a call to see if we can all meet up somewhere between here and New Brunswick! <#> It would be so nice to see them again. </p><p> <#> Well I 'd better finish 'cos Margaret and I are going to bike to the post office and the post will be leaving soon! <#> Say hi to Sarah Jane, Jacinta and your Mum for me. <#> Looking forward to seeing you in September with 'the boys'!! </p><#> Take care, <#> Lots of love, <#> Violet.<p> <#> PS I got these photos developed after I went home - I think it 's such a lovely photo. <#> I got doubles and I 'm sending Ken the other copy! </p></I><I><W1B-006$A><#> 22/10/97<p> <#> Dear Aoife, <#> Thanks for your letter. <#> Glad to hear that your Ph.D has worked out, although you must have been a bit worried for a while. </p><p> <#> Well, I 'm still in London but I 'm probably heading home early next week. <#> Bad news and some good news on the job front. <#> None of the interviews I did here resulted in job offers. <#> Basically, my problem <}> <+> is </+> </}> I haven't done any work experience and therefore they are questioning my commercial awareness and my commitment to commercial law! <#> It 's very disheartening but I 'm remaining philosophical in believing that everything happens for a reason. <#> The good news is that the firm in New York called me and said they wanted to hire me. <#> I can't go yet though because they have to get a work permit or some sort of immigrant visa for me. <#> They are working on that at the moment but it takes quite a while to process. <#> So I just have to wait and see what happens. <#> I 'm hoping that I 'll be able to go before Christmas. <#> At least they sound like they do want me to come over so I 'm quite positive about the whole thing. <#> Once I get some work experience I could reapply for jobs in London or I 'm actually thinking of staying in New York and taking the New York Bar exams. <#> The law degree from here is recognised over there so I wouldn't have to do three years of law school, I 'd just have to do a crash course to prepare for the exams. <#> It certainly wouldn't be easy but I could qualify much quicker over there than here. <#> Tommy is actively encouraging me to stay in New York and qualify there if I get the chance as he doesn't recommend doing the LPC. <#> He is bored to tears I think. <#> I 've seen him a few times since I 've been here. <#> Before Bill left, we met up a couple of times, once with Ed and Ronnie and Laura (PGCE). <#> I saw him a couple of weeks ago - we met for a drink in a pub in Fleet Street. <#> Ed organised it but never turned up (apparently Pierre was over for the weekend so that may have been this excuse!) <#> Tommy 's friend William was there (one of the guys who was at the Hughes Ball) and Dan McShea, the Canadian guy who was on the LLM. </p><p> <#> Tommy rang on Friday but I wasn't here so I must give him a call and meet up before I leave. <#> I went to Normandy last Wednesday 'til Sunday. <#> My cousin Laura was visiting from New York and she and her friend Rex who work for the same bank in London rented a house so she asked me to come too. <#> There was also Rex ' brother and a friend of his from Oxford. <#> It was really good fun. <#> We took the ferry from Portsmouth to Cherbourg and the house was about 1/2 an hour from there. </p><p> <#> This weekend I 'm thinking of going to Cambridge on Friday and then Nottingham on Saturday to see my Italian friend Tina. <#> I also want to see a friend of mine who 's in Chester doing the LPC. <#> I haven't seen him since graduation last year and if I don't see him now I won't see him for ages. <#> I 'm not sure I can fit all that in one weekend! </p><p> <#> I 've spoken to Bill a few times since he left. <#> I called him on Monday night - his mother answered the 'phone and told him that it was someone with an English accent so he said he knew it was me! <#> He 's in good form but a bit bored although he 's busy filling in Ph.D funding applications. <#> He finally got his e-mail to work and has had lots of messages. <#> He heard from Steve Wright who seems to be settling well in LA. <#> He said all the women are hot but not very smart so you don't get very much intelligent conversation!! <#> Charles and Julia are doing very well and are very excited about their imminent arrival. <#> Due date is November 27th. </p><p> <#> Bill 's brothers are on reading week from college so he and Tommy are going camping in Algonquin Park for a few days. <#> I 've really missed him since he left so if I end up in New York at least I 'll be able to go visit. </p><p> <#> Well, I must go. <#> I 'm busy here painting the bathroom for my lovely sisters! <#> So I must get that second coat on! <#> When I go home I 'm planning a trip to Belfast to visit several people who I haven't seen in ages so I 'll give you a call when that happens. <#> I 'm going to work for my brother in Dublin and stay with Margaret at: <#> 199A Griffith Avenue, <#> Drumcondra, <#> Dublin 9 - so now you can keep track of me! </p><p> <#> Take care, <#> Lots of love, <#> Violet.</p><p> <#> PS Say hi to Sarah Jane, Jacinta and your Mum for me.</p></I><I><W1B-009$A><#> February 3, 1998<p> <#> Dear Aoife, <#> This card <ul> was </ul> actually in the birthday section although I 'm not suggesting that you do your hair like this!! </p><p> <#> Have a very HAPPY BIRTHDAY. <#> I wish I could be there to celebrate with you and Ken again - he told me that you were hoping to make it over for his birthday so you 'll probably be in Cambridge for yours too. </p><p> <#> I keep forgetting to ask Bill for your e-mail address...<#> I will soon and hopefully you 'll have had a message from me before you get this. <#> However my head is becoming more like a sieve as each day passes so I 'll give you my e-mail address: vbogs@ola.com. <#> I 'm enjoying living and working in NY. <#> The people at the firm are really nice and I 'm being kept very busy which is good. </p> <p> <#> Hope all is going well with your PhD. <#> I sometimes wish I was still a student - I think I'm still pining for Cambridge and the wonderful time we had....<#> Hopefully we 'll be on-line soon, </p><#> Take care, <#> Lots of love, <#> Violet.</I><I><W1B-009$A><#> February 3, 1999<p> <#> Dear Aoife, <#> Wishing you a very happy birthday. <#> Have a great day! </p><#> Lots of love, <#> Violet<p> <#> Aoife, <#> Sorry I haven't been in touch in ages. <#> I feel like I have been cut off from the rest of the world studying for the Bar exam - I have no life! <#> Less than four weeks to go so it 's getting kind of scary - I have so much to do. </p><p> <#> How have you been? <#> Have you been back to Cambridge yet to finish your research? </p><p> <#> Well, hope all is well with you. <#> Will talk to you soon.<#> Love, Violet.</p></I>
