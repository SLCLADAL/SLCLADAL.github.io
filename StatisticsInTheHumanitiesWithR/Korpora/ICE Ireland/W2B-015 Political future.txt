<W2B-015 Political future><I><W2B-015$A><h> <bold> <#> Beyond partitions </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> It will probably only be when the people of the Shankill truly believe that the violence has ended for good that we will start to see a proper assessment of the last 25 years. </bold> <#> Continuing paramilitary activity in both communities, the controversy over traditional parades and the ongoing impasse over decommissioning means that people in areas such as Protestant west Belfast remain cautious. </p><p> <#> Nevertheless, since August 31 and October 13 as the weeks became months, optimism has increased in an inverse ratio to the level of tension. <#> Many people are starting to believe that perhaps it is all over. </p><p> <#> Some of the changes in the community have been glaring. <#> The army has vanished from the streets. <#> The RUC now patrols the area in short sleeved shirts, without flak jackets. <#> After a lengthy campaign Lanark Way has reopened. </p><p> <#> Initially it was the small things you noticed. <#> No longer did you have to enter a cage, viewed by a small camera, before being admitted into the bar for a pint. <#> Strange cars do not attract the same level of curiosity. <#> Young people returning from the clubs in the city centre are more likely to walk home than before. <#> A few shoppers from the Springfield and Falls Roads are returning to the Shankill to shop on a Saturday. </p><p> <#> However this may seem to be a small return for the cessation of a terrorist campaign which cost over 3,000 lives. <#> There remains a serious community relations problem on both sides of the peaceline. <#> A problem which may well exhaust the Community Relations Council before it is solved. <#> There continues to be stoning incidents across the barriers which have been erected to keep the two sections of the community apart. </p><p> <#> It is worth bearing in mind that for the last 25 years we have been inflicting the most horrific crimes on one another. <#> These wounds will not heal overnight. <#> That notwithstanding, there is an increasing determination not to step back into the abyss. <#> That, at least, is a start. <#> We will have to build from the bottom up. </p><p> <#> In some ways the declaration of a cessation of violence has acted as a catalyst for a process which commenced almost one year earlier. <#> The Shankill bomb saw the birth of a determination for a new start. <#> At that time many of us thought that this would translate into a resolve not to be ground down by a traditional enemy. <#> However, with the advent of a new era in October 1994 this resolution became one of no longer being prepared to accept the role of an alienated community. <#> For a quarter of a century the Shankill had been marginalised in all but the news programmes. </p><p> <#> People started emerging, blinking into the light. <#> It is now certain that Shankill residents will increasingly question the old certainties. <#> The courage and dignity with which they faced the eye of the sectarian storm can now be turned towards delivering a better life for all within the community. <#> This confidence should eventually lead directly to a normalising of relationships with our neighbours on the other side of the wall. <#> It is in the attitudes of the people of the people on the Road that the peace has had the most tangible effect. <#> There is a desire to make up for the loss of the last 25 years. <#> This new vision, while born out of the tragedy of the Shankill bomb, would have been less likely to bear fruit if it had been forced to coexist with paramilitary violence. </p><p> <#> It is not in the small changes that we can see the effects of twelve months of peace. <#> Rather it is in the certainty that the great potential of the Shankill and its people may at last be fulfilled. </p></I><I><W2B-015$B><p> <bold> <#> Driving down the Upper Springfield Road, Belfast 's latest peacewall dominates the landscape, hovering over the people of Springmartin and Springfield Parade. </bold> <#> It is a monument to past and <}> <-> resent </-> <+> present </+> fears, a continuing reality a year after the ceasefire. <#> Perhaps, when all the other Belfast walls come down this last Great Wall of Belfast should remain. </p><p> <#> The wall reflects another reality of west Belfast - that the suffering inflicted and endured over decades cannot be demolished quickly. <#> To have expected otherwise misunderstands the pain which burden so many, a pain that is acknowledged (if at all) only spasmodically by those who caused it. <#> Last month 's 'VJ' commemorations confirm how long the healing process can be - our pain will take much time and thought to ease. </p><p> <#> The ceasefire, despite its year of traumas and turbulence, is firmly anchored among the people of west Belfast. <#> They value it and support those who manage and maintain it - when it appears that it may unravel, a communal restraint appears, pulling it out of crisis. <#> Falls Road republicans, having evolved policy and practice over the years, appear committed to 'a long peace'. <#> Those who disagreed with the timing of the ceasefire of the leadership 's method of its achievement enjoy little or no sympathy for the argument (as they see it) that a return to war will bring more advantage. <#> Shankill Road loyalists - whose political evolution requires more analysis - appear as the advance guard for new thinking within the wider unionist community. <#> The US Administration affirms its commitment to the process by the expected visit of President Clinton in early December. <#> The two governments prepare to re-focus their political strategy with the September Summit of which much is expected and much required. <#> In short a potent cocktail of factors sustains the peace far greater than the totality of forces that may threaten it. </p><p> <#> Yet a sense of crisis exists. <#> A political process so carefully crafted over the last decade urgently requires the impetus of governments. <#> London 's strategy appears at best confused and at worst bloody minded. <#> Issues that can be resolved - repatriation, release of prisoners, repeal of oppressive laws - are delayed or denied. <#> For nationalists and others in west Belfast, these issues are essential tests of British good faith or bad faith. <#> Broader issues (such as weapons and negotiations) compound doubts about British strategy, doubts that must be laid to rest at the September Summit by confirming the timing of inclusive negotiations and, perhaps, a structure for parallel discussions on all relevant issues. </p><p> <#> As we exit the season of marches and protests, for many in west Belfast recent police actions confirm the centrality of the policing debate, which so far, has been somewhat sterile. <#> The Police Authority, marginal in influence and minimalist in intention, clashes with the RUC establishment, who cling to policies and a culture inappropriate to new policing needs. <#> The Acting-Deputy Chief Constable, Ronnie Flanagan, perhaps more aware of the need for change, conducts a review in a political vacuum. <#> Sinn F&/ein 's demand - 'Disband the RUC' - is a slogan and not a policy and offers few creative insights. <#> The debate nonetheless has been energised by Seamus Mallon 's occasional forays and it is anticipated that the SDLP policy document, possibly published later this year, will enliven and enrich the debate further. <#> However, without constitutional and institutional agreement and fundamental cultural change within the police and an agreed means of resolving conflict issues, the policing issues will run and run. </p><p> <#> The many warm phrases about tackling economic and social disadvantage in west Belfast must be translated into the hard facts of eroding disadvantage. <#> On the Falls and the Shankill this task remains substantially unaddressed. <#> The compelling political success of President Clinton 's US Investment Conference and the innovative strategy behind the European Peace and Reconciliation package, is the essential preamble to creating employment opportunities. <#> This is understood and accepted 'on the ground' in west Belfast. </p><p> <#> However, the continuing indifference of most government agencies to redressing years of neglect and discrimination and the absence of any systematic strategy by the IDB for inward investment is alarming. <#> This issue will be one of the touchstones of government intentions towards west Belfast in the second year of the ceasefire. </p><p> <#> It was Martin McGuinness who most narrowly misjudged nationalist political culture with his recent comment that in future negotiations, nationalists would have nothing to give because "they had nothing to give". <#> In terms of jobs, justice and equality, there is validity in <}> <-> is </-> <+> his </+> assertion. <#> But nationalists have much to give - we know that it is a long twilight struggle that brings change; that the political agenda has been enormously enriched by nationalist creative thought and that national confidence and international respect characterise our perspective. <#> This is only part of what we have to give and what we have to give can be seen on the Garvaghy Road; by our building of inclusive politics; by our first articulating the equality and validity of unionist and nationalist traditions. <#> This is a growing reality in west Belfast - that unreconstructed dogmas and demands of the past need to be redefined in a more relevant and accommodating way and that nationalists are well placed and informed to do so. </p><p> <#> An Italian once wrote: <quote> "There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things" </quote> . <#> And the late US Senator Robert Kennedy added <quote> "Yet this is the task of this generation and the road is strewn with many dangers." </quote> <#> The past year of ceasefire confirms the truth of this. <#> But everyday, everywhere, there are people who do not shirk the task of introducing new order of things. <#> In West Belfast, as much as anywhere. </p></I><I><W2B-015$C><h> <bold> <#> It takes two to consent </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> Things have moved quickly since the joint declaration: it has acted as the catalyst for the IRA ceasefire and prompted the 'framework document', to be presented soon by the two governments, which can chart the way to new, stable political structures on the island. </bold> <#> When London and Dublin agreed last December <quote> "to remove the cause of the conflict, to overcome the legacy of history and to heal the divisions which have resulted" </quote> , they made a commitment to go to the heart of the problem. </p><p> <#> The test of the practical merits of the declaration and of the governments ' commitment will, however, be in their application to, and implication in, the political process, as reflected in the framework document. <#> This is particularly true for nationalists, whose defining experience of Northern Ireland has been of exclusion, domination by unionism and all the inequalities that stemmed from majoritarian rule. </p><p> <#> The most certain political fact is this: nationalists in the north will never again accept a position where they are second-class citizens in their own land. <#> Whatever their differences, there is a common resolve that never again will they accept the status of a subordinate and abused minority, formerly assigned to us by the combined weight of the British government and the unionist majority. </p><p> <#> That is why the focus of the declaration is, quite properly, the island as a whole. <#> Yet there are still legitimate nationalist concerns, which centre on the so-called 'unionist veto'. <#> They are tied up with the issue of 'consent' - that is, acceptance that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its people. </p><p> <#> In essence, the concern boils down to this: for as long as the Northern Ireland framework exists, given its unionist bias and inbuilt, tribal weighting in the unionists ' favour, how can nationalists expect equality and dignity? </p><p> <#> While the declaration lays stress on equal rights and 'parity of esteem', we need to know what these concepts will mean in practice. <#> Is mere lip-service to be paid to the ideals and aspirations of nationalists, where the practical impact, as well as inertia, of the British administration weight in one direction only - that of the maintenance of the union? </p><p> <#> Similarly, is the aspiration to unity to be treated as irrelevant, unless and until the day the majority has actually voted it into reality? <#> Or is it to be given real, operational expression and opportunity as a legitimate and worthy aspiration, as of now? <#> If the people of Northern Ireland are not to be persuaded into Irish unity, they must also not be subject to hidden barriers and loaded preferences, bolstering up the unionist position and loading the dice between the two aspirations. </p><p> <#> There may no longer be a 'unionist veto' in the extreme sense which allowed unionist domination to go unchecked and unexamined for more than 50 years. <#> There are, however, more subtle variants still around. </p><p> <#> There is the notion that the rights of nationalists must meet an unwritten test of unionist consent and approval. <#> There is the notion that, notwithstanding the tribal make-up of Northern Ireland, the empowerment of nationalists would somehow be an infringement of the rights of unionists. <#> There is the notion that the union is somehow the only 'real' dimension in Northern Ireland and that anything to do with nationalist aspirations is, in the last analysis an 'add-on'. </p><p> <#> If the unionist veto means the strong political influence of a coherent community of 900,000 people, then that of course is accepted. <#> To deny it would be as futile as any other flight from reality. </p><p> <#> But he other notions should be dispelled and 'veto' and 'consent' precisely defined. <#> We need to be assured that there is no veto over the policy of the two governments, and that neither is precluded from adopting or pursuing a policy in relation to the north of which unionists disapprove. <#> Both governments enjoy a wider mandate and are entitled to consult the general good or set wider objectives, on this as on any other issue. <#> They should put beyond doubt that their approach to Northern Ireland is based on a recognition that it is <it> sui generis </it> and that the needs of nationalists cannot be met or mediated through the inbuilt unionist majority. </p><p> <#> People should also recognise that nationalist consent is directed at the specific question of a change in the status of Northern Ireland. <#> It should not be taken to imply a nationalist consent to a chain of logic that, because Northern Ireland is at present under United Kingdom jurisdiction, their consent must apply to everything that flows from that. <#> There is a world of political difference between agreeing there will be no change of status without consent, and saying we consent to the present status. <#> If that distinction is eluded, there will be no real dialogue with nationalism. </p><p> <#> Acceptance of consent is not a blank cheque for some unionist programme for Northern Ireland. <#> We must all remember - especially the British government and the unionist parties - that the coin of consent has two sides, and the more clearly that is reflected in any new arrangements the more durable and stable they will be. <#> Because Irish history, if it teaches us anything, teaches us that consent is the essential ingredient of stability. </p></I>
