<ICE-IRE:S2B-040 Creation of Dail><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-040$A> <#> In this lecture <,> I will discuss aspects of civil and military relations within the independence movement in the years immediately following Da/il E/ireann 's first meeting on the twenty-first of January nineteen nineteen <#> Coincidentally but symbolically <,> this was the same day that two policemen were shot dead at Soloheadbeg in the first serious act of violence in the War of Independence <#> That day thus marked the somewhat uneasy and temporary fusion of two distinct strands in Irish nationalism <,> the constitutional and the revolutionary <,> in a unitary independence movement <#> My aims are firstly to explore key issues surrounding the control of the army <,> and secondly to comment on the consequences for the military and for defence policy in independent Ireland of what happened in the first chaotic and violent years of Da/il E/ireann 's existence <#> The defence forces have suffered ever since from the circumstances of their establishment <#> Generations of Irish politicians have heaped praise on the army as the epitome of national discipline and the guarantor of national sovereignty <#> Successive governments have nevertheless <,> failed to develop even the outlines of a credible defence policy <,> while the army has been hampered in discharging its incoherent mandate by a chronic lack of money <,> and by a Byzantine system of administration designed primarily to keep the warriors in perpetual thrall to the Department of Defence <#> The Gleeson report of nineteen ninety on pay and conditions in the defence forces <,> undoubtedly the most authoritative examination of the army yet published <,> commented that <,> the defence forces have traditionally enjoyed high esteem and trust <,> but their <.> in </.> internal affairs have tended to attract <,> a relatively low level of public and political interest <#> Armies and democracies tend by turn to be ignored or <,> at best <,> taken for granted <,> and then trustingly looked to on the occasion of a variety of military emergencies <#> The defence forces in this country are no exception <#> In many respects however <,> the experience of the Irish defence forces has been exceptional when measured against those of other newly-independent states <#> This is demonstrated by the remarkably low level of defence spending since independence <,> by governments ' deeply ingrained unwillingness to comment on defence policy except in those anodyne terms <,> and by the absence of any informed debate on defence issues <#> The declared primary role of the defence forces since the end of the Civil War in nineteen twenty-three <,> has been to defend the state from external attack <#> In reality <,> however <,> successive governments have relied not on the army but on the defensive umbrella provided by Britain and her allies <,> to shield the state from external aggression <#> In practice it has been the army 's dismal fate since the early nineteen twenties <,> to subsist at a size and at a level of equipment just sufficient to perpetuate the domestic illusion <,> that the state is capable of effective action against external aggression <,> and to deal with any likely internal security threat <#> The latter function has sometimes seen the army required to act <,> not so much in aid of the civil power <,> the conventional phrase used to describe its security and other activities within the State <,> but in lieu of it <#> A striking example is the use of military courts during the <.> W </.> Civil War <,> in the nineteen thirties <,> and again during the Emergency to administer justice for anti-state offences <#> The army has also had a wide miscellany of non-military jobs routinely thrust upon it <#> Some of these such as helicopter search and rescue duties <,> derive from its military functions <#> Others however <,> such as collecting rubbish during a bin strike <,> or running an emergency shelter for Dublin 's homeless <,> are given to it simply because it is a convenient source of disciplined and obedient labour <#> Independent Ireland 's defence policy in practice appears all the more curious <,> given the means by which independence was won <,> and the practical legitimacy of the new state established <#> The struggle against the military and police machines of the British government in Ireland <,> was followed by a civil war <,> in which the national army <,> defeated armed Republican resistance to the new order <#> In such circumstances <,> one might expect to find the military revered and cosseted <,> by deferential ministers anxious to keep them quiet <#> This was scarcely the army 's experience <#> Similarly <,> Nationalist Ireland 's enduring grievance about partition <,> might have been expected to influence the development and organisation of the defence forces <#> In fact <,> once the border was confirmed in December nineteen twenty-five <,> the army was required to operate as though neither the political entity nor the territory of Northern Ireland existed <#> This injunction left the defence forces desperately ill-informed <,> when the Second World War broke out <#> It caused further difficulties when the Northern Troubles flared up again in nineteen sixty-nine <,> and the possibility of Irish Army intervention was canvassed by ministers unfamiliar with modern military realities <#> Finally <,> from nineteen twenty-three the defence forces were required to plan for their nominal primary task of <.> ex </.> resisting external aggression <,> without any consultation with or explicit reference to Britain <,> which was not only the implicit strategic guarantor of Irish security but also much the most plausible threat to it <,> <#> The vicissitudes endured by the army since the early nineteen twenties <,> are explained partly by three historical factors <#> The first is the policy of military neutrality <,> adopted from the outset by the Irish Free State <,> which over the years has acquired the status of holy writ <#> It is outside the ambit of this lecture <#> The second factor is the nature of the War of Independence <,> and the third is the ambiguous and tangled relationships between and within the military and the political wings of the independence movement after nineteen thirteen <#> Between nineteen nineteen and nineteen twenty-one <,> Ireland experienced a sporadic scattered small-scale guerrilla war <#> Its object was not to inflict direct military defeat on a vastly superior enemy <,> but to make the country ungovernable <,> and to force Britain to recognise the legitimacy of Irish demands for self-rule <#> Ulster apart <,> these tactics succeeded <#> Their very success however <,> seems to have left both a generation of political leaders <,> and the public at large <,> under the impression that all that would ever be needed to deter or to expel an external aggressor was a few rifles in the right hands <#> With the exception of Richard Mulcahy and <,> arguably <,> Sean MacEntee <,> no senior politician <,> on either side of the Treaty Divide after nineteen twenty-three <,> wasted their energies on the serious consideration of external defence issues <,> until forced to do so by events <#> And despite the chastening experience of the Emergency <,> the old assumptions reasserted themselves once World War Two ended <#> What Tom Garvin has described as the extraordinary political longevity <,> of the revolutionary elite ensured that these views held currency at least until the early nineteen sixties <#> Some would say that they persist today <,> <#> The explanation for the political sensitivity of military issues <,> also lies in what happened between nineteen thirteen <,> and nineteen twenty-four <#> It is generally held that the contemporary defence forces are the direct descendants of the Irish Volunteers <,> formed in nineteen thirteen as an open Nationalist militia <,> pledged to ensure that the Irish Home Rule Bill would be applied in full <#> In June nineteen fourteen <,> the organisation was forced to accept the control of John Redmond <,> who appeared on the verge of achieving a substantial measure of independence by constitutional means <,> as long as the British government would keep its nerve on Home Rule <,> and face down the threat of violence from Unionist Ulster <#> By imposing his control on the Irish Volunteers <,> he hoped to rein in the wilder separatist elements <,> who might otherwise seek confrontation with the British authorities <#> After the outbreak of World War One <,> most volunteers took their lead from Redmond <,> and supported the British war effort <#> A minority of perhaps five percent seceded <,> retaining the title of the Irish Volunteers <#> This was a significant moment <,> because it illustrated the conditional nature of the subordination of armed to constitutional politics within the Nationalist movement <#> Two years later came the Easter Rising <,> the brainchild of the Military Council of the long-established secret society the IRB <#> It was organised behind the back of the Volunteer 's Chief of Staff Eoin MacNeill <,> by a group of his officers who ensured that the rebellion went ahead <,> despite his countermanding order <#> This illustrated the conditional nature of subordination and allegiance even within the revolutionary movement <,> and it probably contributed to the mistrust of the IRB <,> later displayed by some key political figures <,> including Eamon de Valera <#> In launching the rebellion <,> the IRB proclaimed an Irish Republic <,> declared itself the rightful government of Ireland <,> and created an Irish Republican Army <,> into which the Irish Volunteers and other combatants were automatically subsumed <#> From this it followed that the IRA <,> or the Volunteers as they continued generally to be known <,> were the military arm of the IRB 's Irish Republic <#> The IRB itself remained an oath-bound secret society <,> espousing Republican principles <,> but run on strictly hierarchical lines <,> and demanding absolute obedience from its members <#> It stood apart from the IRA and from Sinn Fe/in <,> although most IRA commanders <,> and many <.> oth </.> of the leading figures in Sinn Fe/in <,> were also IRB members <#> Florence O'Donoghue <,> a senior officer in both the IRB and the IRA <,> was later to observe that this <,> interlocking of leadership personnel <,> while it tended to unify policy and correlate activities between the different organisations within the independence movement <,> had serious disadvantages which later became apparent <,> <#> An Taoiseach Albert Reynolds recently observed <,> that amongst the first Da/il 's achievements was the establishment of the <,> primacy of the civil power over the military <#> While civilian primacy is now an unremarked cornerstone of Irish constitutional politics however <,> the evidence suggests that the question of the ultimate loyalty of the military wing of the independence movement was a vexed one <,> until the collapse of the army mutiny in nineteen twenty-four <#> Throughout the War of Independence <,> there were confusion of allegiance between the Da/il government and the IRB <,> and between the IRB and the IRA <#> After the Treaty came civil war <,> won decisively by those willing to accept the qualified independence <,> of a twenty-six county free state <,> within the British commonwealth <,,> <#> But a rift persisted even amongst the victors <#> In March nineteen twenty-four a faction within the military <,> resentful of developments in the army since nineteen twenty-two <,> threatened the government with mutiny <#> That crisis was overcome <,> but another group of challengers to the supremacy of elected civilian government endured <,> in the Republican movement <#> Irish separatist history since nineteen thirteen is littered with such legitimist claims <,> abandoned oaths <,> and rival authorities <#> Throughout the campaign for self-determination after nineteen thirteen <,> even during what de Valera termed the <,> four years of magnificent discipline from nineteen seventeen to nineteen twenty-one <,> relations between the political and military wings of the separatist movement were fraught with uncertainty <#> That grew rather than lessened <,> after the establishment of Da/il E/ireann <,> although this did not become public knowledge until after the treaty was signed <,> <#> Sinn Fe/in 's success in the nineteen eighteen election <,> was seen as a resounding democratic endorsement of the right to self-determination <,> to use An Taoiseach 's words once more <#> However <,> when Da/il E/ireann was established <,> it did not automatically become the only focus of allegiance and font of legitimacy <,> for members of the independence movement <#> The IRA had its own executive <,> dominated by but distinct from the IRB <#> The IRB regarded itself as the legal embodiment of the Republic proclaimed in nineteen sixteen <,> and saw the IRA as its army <#> This <,> together with its revolutionary and conspiratorial tradition <,> posed difficulties <.> f </.> for those who sought to build on the democratic authority <,> conferred by Sinn Fe/in 's electoral success and the creation of Da/il E/ireann <#> But Sinn Fe/in was itself regarded <,> less as a political party than as the civilian and subordinate wing of the independence movement <,> and there were many members of both the IRA and the IRB in it</I>
