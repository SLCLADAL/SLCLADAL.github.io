<W1B-018 Belfast business 2><I><W1B-018$A><h> <#> 23rd February, 1998. </h><p> <#> Dear Theatregoer, <#> I have pleasure in enclosing information on two of our forthcoming productions here at the Lyric. </p><p> <#> Those of you who saw Gary Mitchell 's last play <bold> In a Little World of Our Own </bold> will know how quickly it sold out and early booking for the world premiere of <bold> Tearing the Loom </bold> is therefore essential. </p><p> <#> Anyone who enjoyed our sell-out success two years ago of <bold> Dancing at Lughnasa </bold> will know of the Lyric 's fondness for the work of Brian Friel. <#> Our new production of <bold> Translations </bold> boasts an impressive cast that includes Roy Hanlon and Mark Mulholland. <#> Roy was in the first ever production of <bold> Translations </bold> in 1980 alongside Stephen Rea, Mick Lally, Liam Neeson and Ray McAnally and is delighted to once again be starring in what many believe to be Friel 's finest play to date. </p><p> <#> And finally, don't forget that our current production of <bold> Miss Julie </bold> runs for two weeks only until 7th March. <#> August Strindberg 's greatest play is also one of the most erotic masterpieces of world theatre in which sexual attraction and the sexual act are used as weapons in the class war, and in the battle between the sexes. <it> <#> Not suitable for children. </it> </p><p> <#> If all of the above productions take your fancy, then why not make the most of our Spring Subscription Offer. <bold> <#> If you book for all 3 shows, you pay for only 2! </bold> </p><p> <#> To book your tickets, please telephone the Box Office between 10am and 7pm, Monday to Saturday on <bold> (01232)381081. </bold><p> <#> We look forward to seeing you at the Lyric soon. </p><p>

the emotionally-charged, musically uplifting operas you will have enjoyed at Northern Ireland 's Premier Theatre is a dramatic production of Verdi 's NABUCCO which I had the pleasure of attending in Poland last weekend, and which comes to the Grand Opera House for two performances on Wednesday 15 and Thursday 16 April. </p><P> <#> NABUCCO is very <it> <ul> grand </ul> </it> grand opera, with dramatic music to lift you out of your seat. <#> It is a story of love (requited and unrequited) and betrayal, told in music which excites and thrills. </p><p> <#> 'Nabucco' is the Old Testament character Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, who, after taking Judah captive, repents of tyranny and embraces Judaism. <#> His daughter Abigail attempts to use her power to win the affection of Jewish leader Israel, and treacherously robs her father of the crown. <#> Fearing harsh judgement after her father 's conversion, she takes her own life. <#> These large-scale events inspired Verdi to write scorching tunes and driving rhythms. </p><p> <#> The Lodz Opera is a Polish state company, with powerful soloists and a superb orchestra. <#> Conductor Andrzej Straszynski is one of Poland 's finest. <#> For this visit to Belfast, they are sending forty members of their sonorous chorus, for a work with some of the most inspired choral writing in Italian opera. <#> NABUCCO features on of the most famous opera tunes - the nostalgic lament of the Jewish exiles for their distant homeland. </p><p> <#> I am sure you will enjoy it. <#> Performances start at 7.30, and end at approximately 10.15. <#> Ticket prices begin at <*> pound sign </*> 12, with discounts for groups, students and senior citizens. <#> Full details can be found on the enclosed leaflet. <#> Because the opera is sung in Italian, we shall be providing, free of charge, a plot summary with all tickets booked. </p><p> <#> Contact the Ticket Shop at 2 / 4 Great Victoria Street (telephone 01232- 241919). <#> NABUCCO guarantees a thrilling evening of grand opera. <#> I hope that we can once again look forward to welcoming you to Northern Ireland 's Premier Theatre. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <&> signature </&> <#> DEREK NICHOLLS <#> <ul> THEATRE DIRECTOR </ul> </p></I><I><W1B-018$D><h> <#> Dr Gordon Crowe <#> Queen 's University <#> BELFAST <#> BT7 1NN </h><p> <#> Dear Dr Crowe <#> I am writing to let you know that the Voluntary Activity Unit (VAU) was re-launched as the Voluntary and Community Unit (VCU) on 20th May 2002. </p><p> <#> The VAU was established within the old Department for Health and Social Services in 1993, and was intended to be the focal point for voluntary and community activity within the Northern Ireland Civil Service. <#> The original remit of the Unit was to assume lead responsibility for voluntary and community sector development across Government and to provide the structures necessary for interdepartmental debate on key issues in the field. <#> The Unit subsequently evolved to take on a much wider role and range of activities than was originally envisaged. </p><p> <#> The Unit moved to the Department for Social Development following devolution and a review of the Unit 's work was then commissioned. <#> The central finding of the Review focussed on the cross-cutting nature of the work of the VAU, its need to provide increased support to other Departments in the development of effective and consistent relationships with the voluntary and community sector, and the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the voluntary and community sector. <#> We have therefore changed our name to "The Voluntary and Community Unit". </p><p> <#> If you would like to know more, an information leaflet about the work of the Unit is available from Vicki Haire, Voluntary and Community Unit, DSD, Churchill House, Victoria Square, Belfast, BT1 4SD. <#> Tel. 018 9056 9318. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <&> signature </&> <#> Dave Wall <#> Director </p></I><I><W1B-018$E><W1B-018$F><h> <#> 16th May 1994<p> <#> Dear Gordon, <#> We are carrying out research on the impact of the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) with a view to identifying the factors influencing the use of computers in the University. <#> Earlier this year we wrote to your director for permission to discuss the use of computers with a member of staff with responsibility for, or an interest in, this area. <#> We also asked for permission to observe classes using computers within the school or department. <#> Your name was suggested as the person we should talk to with respect to these matters and this letter is to brief you on our plans. </p><p> <#> We have just carried out a questionnaire survey of 835 full-time level 0 and 1 undergraduates to investigate their general attitudes to computers, their specific opinions of computing at the University, their knowledge of computers and their previous experience and current usage of computers. <#> Our planned follow up includes interviewing some of the students on the main issues arising from the survey. <#> Once the survey has been analysed, we hope you will be able to meet with us to discuss your perspective, and that of your school or department, in relation to teaching an learning with computers. <#> Your assistance in arranging observation visits and opportunities to interview students will be particularly appreciated. <#> We would hope to contact you before the summer recess but if not we will be in touch early in the new academic year. </p><p> <#> If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact us at Ext. 7128 (John Gardner) or Ext. 3898 (Jill McMahon). </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <&> signature </&> <#> Dr. John Gardner <#> Director, School of Education <#> Jill McMahon <#> Research Officer </p></I><I><W1B-018$G><h> <#> Dr Gordon F Crowe <#> 19 Sloane Way <#> BELFAST <#> 31st August 1994 </h><p> <#> Dear Dr Crowe <#> With much of our internal reorganisation complete and the cross-harbour road system surrounding our warehouse nearing completion the time has come to introduce some Autumn wine evenings. </p><p> <#> Due to a demand for more specialist evenings our traditional wine course is being postponed until the new year; in its place we are offering a series of four wine and supper evenings providing an opportunity to taste a wider and superior range of wines from <bold> Italy, Burgundy/Beaujolais, Rh&/\one/Provence </bold> and <bold> Bordeaux </bold> respectively - each evening will be conducted by expert and knowledgeable tasters with a particular interest in the region concerned. <#> A special price is available to those attending the series of all four tastings. </p><P> <#> We are pleased to be welcoming Stanley Moss of <bold> Bodegas Torres </bold> to Belfast in September. <#> This will offer yet another chance to savour the fine wines produced by our award-winning Catalonian producer. <#> An illustrated tasting of a range of stylish Torres wines will be followed by a full buffet supper. </p><p> <#> Finally, we are taking an opportunity to introduce our new range of Australian wines. <#> The <bold> Rothbury </bold> venture represents a new direction for 'New World' winemaking with an emphasis upon both varietal and regional individuality. <#> Native Australian, Dennis Power is conducting a tasting at Direct Wine Shipments which again will be followed by a full buffet supper. </p><p> <#> We hope that these evenings will offer something of interest to you. <#> Early application is advised to avoid disappointment - we look forward to seeing you. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <&> signature </&> <#> Kevin McAlindon <#> Managing Director </p></I><I><W1B-018$H><h> <#> 256 Ormeau

learn of the difficulties you have experiences with your Creda Tumble Dryer. </p><p> <#> Our records show a service call on 15 July 1995 at which time a replacement timer and relay were fitted. </p><p> <#> A further call on 2 November 1995 was carried out by our engineer, the fault reported was noises. </p><p> <#> I am informed by the engineer that he recommended replacement pulleys, which although were not on his vehicle, would have been put on order for you. <#> He did offer to grease the pulleys in the meantime but advised you that charges would be made since the repair was different to that carried out on 15 July 1995, and that you refused to have the pulleys fitted. </p><p> <#> Creda therefore do not accept that we have a liability to make any reimbursement and we would not therefore be in a position to refund any monies paid. </p><p> <#> May I apologise for any inconvenience you have been caused. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <&> signature </&> <#> B Toner <#> Area
