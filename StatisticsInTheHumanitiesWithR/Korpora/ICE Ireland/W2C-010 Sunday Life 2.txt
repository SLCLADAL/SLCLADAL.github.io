<W2C-010 Sunday Life 2><I><W2C-010$A><h> <#> UDA STEAL JAIL KEYS <#> Alan Murray </h><p> <#> Security at Crumlin Road prison in Belfast was in chaos last night after loyalists smuggled a set of prison keys out of the jail. </p><p> <#> The major security lapse revealed to Sunday Life yesterday adds a further dangerous dimension to the already grim picture in the province 's jail system. </p><p> <#> The four keys on a copper ring are believed to have been lost by a warder in the jail which loyalist sources say is tense because of rumours that a quantity of Semtex was found in B wing a month ago. </p><p> <#> In a written communication smuggled out of the jail by UDA prisoners along with the keys, they claim they are <quote> "sacrificial sheep" </quote> in a security game being played by the authorities to try and trap IRA bombers. </p><p> <#> They allege that there have been constant movements of IRA remand prisoners over the last four weeks because of the fear that <quote> "further" </quote> quantities of the deadly explosive are in the jail. </p><p> <#> And they fear an explosion similar to the blast in November 1991 which killed two loyalist prisoners in a dining room is being planned by republicans. </p><p> <#> The prisoners say in the smuggled letter that they want the suspected IRA bombers to be put in specially built cells. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Isolate these men and call in the RUC to investigate" </quote> , they demand. </p><p> <#> They claim that Semtex and what they say was a <quote> "firing pack" </quote> was found in B wing over three weeks ago and that the set of keys was lost by a warder during searches. </p><p> <#> They say some Republicans were put into cells with hidden microphones of eavesdropping purposes in a bid to discover where other quantities of explosives were hidden. </p><p> <#> When it was discovered the keys had been lost, major searches of B wing were launched but the keys were successfully concealed by prisoners. </p><p> <quote> <#> "If they can't find a bunch of keys, what chance have they of finding Semtex", </quote> the smuggled letter asks. </p><p> <#> A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office confirmed that a set of keys was lost in the jail and had not been found. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Appropriate action has been taken to ensure the lost keys are no longer of any use". </quote> </p><p> <#> The prison authorities denied that any Semtex has been found in the jail in recent weeks. </p></I><I><W2C-010$A><h> <#> RACKETEERING SQUAD TARGET McGUINNESS <#> Alan Murray </h><p> <#> Top republican Martin McGuinness will not face prosecution on the sole basis of material supplied to the RUC by the recent Cook Report programme. </p><p> <#> A senior RUC officer at Police Headquarters in Belfast has indicated that the material would not suffice as evidence in a criminal prosecution. </p><p> <#> However a major investigation into the activities of the top republican is being conducted by a team of detectives from the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit. </p><p> <#> The Chief Superintendent in charge of the unit and detectives from his squad are documenting all the Cook Report material on computers and assembling other details as part of a major investigation ordered by the Chief Constable. </p><p> <#> Sir Hugh Annesley and his senior officers are concerned at the public perception created by the programme that an all-out effort is not being made to prosecute the so-called godfathers of terrorism in both the loyalist and nationalist camps. </p><p> <#> Under the new Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act a new offence of directing terrorism at any level with life imprisonment as the maximum penalty is included. <#> It is understood no person has yet been charged with the offence. </p><p> <#> The RUC Press Office declined to say whether anyone has been charged with the offence since the Act came into force two years ago. </p><p> <#> One senior RUC officer has explained that even if some of the witnesses interviewed by Roger Cook 's researchers were prepared to appear in a criminal trial their own terrorist backgrounds would undermine the credibility of their testimony. </p><p> <#> While the top Derry republican is said to be livid about the content of the programme, there is little expectation at Police Headquarters that Cook 's material alone will provide the basis for a file that might be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the future. </p></I><I><W2C-010$A><h> <#> UFF STEPS UP TERROR CAMPAIGN <#> Alan Murray </h><p> <#> Security sources believe that the UFF managed to locate the new safe house of the IRA 's top man in North Belfast within just six weeks. </p><p> <#> The house was attacked and another IRA activist escaped without injury.<#> The ability of the loyalist terrorists to track down the location is an illustration of how much better their intelligence on the IRA has become. </p><h> <#> Homework </h><p> <#> A Special Branch Officer said: <quote> "It shows they are driving around nationalist areas, consulting electoral register records and basically doing their homework." </quote> </p><p> <#> Uncovering the IRA man 's safe house, detectives believe, was basically a case of watching car movements. </p><p> <quote> <#> "We 're certain the UFF identifies a car used by the target, then they drive through nationalist areas in the city late at night looking for the car. </p><p> <#> "If they locate it outside a house, then they establish when it is there, and prepare and attack for the period." </quote> </p><p> <#> Police say that one well known UFF figure is regularly driving through nationalist parts of North and West Belfast despite the real risk to his own life. </p><p> <#> An RUC officer said: <quote> "He is regularly stopped at road checks by our patrols. <#> He even points at houses and tells uniformed officers <quote> 'That 's where so and so lives' </quote> . </p><p> <#> "He really is constantly targeting the homes of IRA figures, but we can't prove that in court." </quote> </p><p> <#> Such is the geography of the area that a top UFF man in the Shankill and the IRA 's top man in North Belfast recently became involved in a heated verbal exchange in a bizarre incident while stopped in cars at traffic lights on the Crumlin Road. </p><h> <#> Screaming </h><p> <#> One RUC officer said: <quote> "If you wrote that into a play or novel, people wouldn't believe it, but it actually happened. <#> Here were these two sworn enemies screaming at each other through car windows. </p><p> <#> "It 's indicative of a seething hatred and the proximity of loyalist and nationalist areas which enables the killer gangs to drive into one another 's area in a minute and get back whether they are scouting or going in to murder." </quote> </p></I><I><W2C-010$B><h> <#> Armagh 's drinkers face dry weekend </h><p> <#> Publicans in the south Armagh village of Crossmaglen had their busiest weekend of the year put in jeopardy when a lorry delivering <*> pound sign </*> 20,000 of drink was hijacked on Friday. </p><p> <#> The lorry was bringing the drink for the Crossmaglen Traditional Weekend, an annual even of music and drinking, which attracts thousands to the village. </p><p> <#> The publicans are now anxiously looking at their stocks to see whether they can manage without the 160 barrels stolen in a daylight raid at Silverbridge, near the border village. </p><p> <#> Although Sunday is one of the quieter days of the festival, pubs with extra stock have agreed to help out any who run into difficulties. </p><p> <#> Joe Pilkington, the owner of The Cartwheel, one of the largest pubs in the village, said that it was difficult to predict sales but thought he had enough to last the final night. </p><p> <quote> <#> "If I don't, I wouldn't like to see the faces of the people around here if I tried to ration it," </quote> he said. </p></I><I><W2C-010$C><h> <#> RTE bosses plan soccer blockbuster <#> John Moore </h><p> <#> TV bosses are planning to set Ireland alight with World Cup football fever. <#> As the Republic seems set to qualify for America, they are drawing up plans for the biggest television sports blockbusters ever. </p><p> <#> <*> bullet point </*> One of the Republic's two TV channels, Network 2, will be completely turned over to football and fans for the Cup, showing an incredible 50 live matches. <#> <*> bullet point </*> There will be six major TV spectaculars in the run-up to the contest, and <#> <*> bullet point </*> A special camera unit will be based with the Irish team to bring fans the inside stories. </p><p> <#> The decision to turn the Cup into a huge entertainment event has been made because of the massive fan following which Jack Charlton and his Green Army have built up in their battle to quality. </p><p> <#> The man in charge of the RTE operation is sports broadcasting chief Tim O'Connor. </p><p> <#> He revealed: <quote> "We are seriously looking at the possibility of taking over Network 2 for the World Cup. </p><p> <#> "We plan to screen live 50 out of the 52 matches which will be played during the competition. </p><p> <#> "We will be able to do this because, for the first time in a World Cup, it seems there will be three different kick-off times each day with all three daily matches being staggered. </p><p> <#> "That 's why it makes sense to turn Network 2 into Ireland 's soccer channel." </quote> </p><p> <#> But RTE chiefs have ordered that TV coverage should also take in other topics.<p> <#> "There will be a special magazine programme on what 's happening behind the scenes," </quote> said Tim. </p><p> <quote> <#> "And, in the six shows in the run-up to the Cup, we will be dealing with things such as security and personal safety for fans, as well as entertainment and what to do in America." </quote> </p><p> <#> The Republic faces its next World Cup qualifying hurdle in Dublin on Wednesday when it plays Lithuania. </p><p> <#> Northern Ireland are all but out of the competition, needing a miracle to make it to the US, Scotland are already out and Wales are still in with a chance. </p><p> <#> England are in danger of failing to qualify and begin a three-match trail of truth on Wednesday against Poland. </p></I><I><W2C-010$D><h> <#> RUC left in the dark </h><p> <#> Police officers serving in the toughest loyalist areas of Belfast admit they are not making big inroads into the terrorist organisations. </p><p> <#> As the activities of the three loyalist terrorist groups claimed four lives last week, experienced police officers said they now faced structures as tight as any IRA cells. </p><p> <#> One detective who has interviewed many loyalist activists at Castlereagh said: <quote> "Usually when you got four Prods in, one spilled some of the beans and that enabled you to get at the others. <#> It 's not happening like that now. </p><p> <#> And one uniformed officer who patrols the area said: <quote> "Headquarters won't admit it, but they aren't giving us any good grade intelligence on the UDA/UFF crowd, because the Branch just isn't getting it. </p><p> <#> "We 've got five or six UVF teams with their gear in the last year, but only one UFF team." </quote> </p><p> <#> The officer said there had been no significant finds of UFF weapons on the Shankill in the last 12 months. </p><h> <#> Searches </h><p> <quote> <#> "The intelligence isn't there. <#> We even suspect they have made hides in the foundations of new houses, because they 're using guns and we 're not getting them later in searches," </quote> the officer said. </p><p> <#> The Red Hand Commando, revived after lying dormant for eight years, is much further down the Special Branch 's priority list, despite its terror campaign against the GAA and attacks on Catholics recently in North Belfast. </p><p> <#> One Special Branch officer said <quote> "The UFF is by far the greatest danger because it is expanding, and its internal security is very, very tight. </p><p> <#> "The UVF we have penetrated well, as arrests in Belfast and Mid Ulster have shown, but the Red Hand is small and that makes it more difficult to infiltrate." </quote> </p><p> <#> The officer said that type of harrowing loyalist murders of last week were virtually unstoppable. </p><p> <quote> <#> "If we don't have intelligence we can't prevent these atrocities. <#> And the more quickly they are organised, the less time we have to act even if we do get a hint," </quote> he said. </p></I><I><W2C-010$E><h> <#> CHAMPS CAN RETAIN TITLE <#> Micheal McGeary </h><p> <#> All Ireland champions Kilkenny put their title on the line this afternoon against a Galway side desperately keen to revive the glory days of the late 80s. </p><p> <#> The influence of Kilkenny and Galway hurling is reflected in the fact that they have qualified for three finals, minor, U-21 and senior. </p><p> <#> Kilkenny could have been beaten in the Leinster championship but for a controversial penalty, awarded after John Power went down in the square. </p><p> <#> Wexford too had chances to beat them, in the Leinster final and in the replay, but let them off the hook. </p><p> <#> In fairness against Offaly they were short three players, with three again missing against Wexford. </p><p> <#> There is, however, a tremendous <}> <-> cameraderie </-> <+> camaraderie </+> </}> and resilience within the squad. </p><p> <#> They are great survivors who simply never countenance defeat. </p><p> <#> Both sides have an average age of 25. </p><p> <#> The intensity and urgency of Galway 's hurling in the semi-final win over Tipperary surprised most people. </p><p> <#> There is though a real danger that Galway may have already played their All Ireland final, and that after their sterling endeavours against Tipperary they won't have sufficient left in the tank. </p><p> <#> Seldom has a team been so fired up prior to a major match, due largely to the pompous comments of Tipperary manager Babs Keating, who should have known better. </p><p> <#> Even the three debutants came in and played like never before. </p><p> <#> Galway will still go in as underdogs - an unusual position for them - but one that should suit them down to the ground. </p><h> <#> Attack </h><p> <#> The fact they are playing Kilkenny won't make them feel intimidated or fazed in any way. </p><p> <#> Tradition is no longer against them. </p><p> <#> They have beaten all the top hurling powers at various stages in the last decade. </p><p> <#> Attack is obviously Galway 's biggest concern. </p><p> <#> They won against Tipperary without ever putting away all the chances they created. </p><p> <#> Pauric Kelly, Murt Killea and Joe McGrath are under pressure to again reproduce their heroics of the semi-final win. </p><p> <#> Michael McGrath, Joe Cooney, Michael Phelan, so there 's a huge responsibility on the shoulders of Michael Coleman. </p><p> <#> Galway 's revival is no overnight success. </p><p> <#> It 's all down to hard work at ever level of the sport, but anytime Kilkenny get to a final they expect to win. </p><p> <#> The champions have tremendous belief in their own ability, and while it 's premature to compare them with the great Kilkenny sides they look well enough equipped to retain their title. </p></I>
