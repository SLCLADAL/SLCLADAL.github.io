<W2C-012 Irish Times 2><I><W2C-12$A><h> <bold> <#> FF left in the doldrums as other parties discuss rainbow coalition </bold><bold> <#> By Maol Muire Tynan, Political Reporter </bold> </h><p> <#> DISCUSSIONS on the formation of a rainbow coalition are well under way between the leaders of all the politcal parties in Leinster House except Fianna Fail, with a view to establishing an alternative administration within days. </p><p> <#> It has emerged that the issue of a rotating Taoiseach will not be a major sticking point with the Labour leadership. <#> Fine Gael insistence that Mr John Bruton should take up the position in a new government will not prevent Mr Dick Spring agreeing to join a rainbow coalition. </p><p> <#> Mr Bruton said last night he believed that a new government could be formed <quote> "within days" </quote> as a political vacuum had prevailed since the Cork by-elections last month and there were pressing political issues at stake. </p><p> <#> Much groundwork had already been done by the different parties in terms of their requirements in an alternative administration, he said, but he declined to speculate on whether the rainbow coalition was likely to consist of a three- or four-party alliance. </p><p> <#> In order to advance the talks rapidly, a second round of contacts between the party leaders took place last night. </p><p> <#> Before the start of the special Dail statements on the Brendan Smyth controversy, Mr Bruton had a 45-minute meeting with Mr Spring in his offices and also held discussions with the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Ms Mary Harney, and the leader of Democratic Left, Mr Proinsias de Rossa. </p><p> <#> Separate talks on the formation of an alliance also took place between Mr Spring and the leaders of the smaller parties yesterday afternoon, and position papers have already been exchanged between some of the parties. </p><p> <#> According to some Labour sources, Mr Spring is <quote> "anxious not to exclude anyone at this stage" </quote> , and it is understood he believes that a coalition can be crafted within a very short period. <#> The renegotiated programme for government that Labour had almost concluded with Fianna Fail will form the basis of its talks with the rainbow parties. </p><p> <#> Indicating that her party was willing to play a role in attempting to form a government, Ms Harney stressed that the new coalition must be <quote> "credible, durable and effective" </quote> . <#> Sources in the party said last night that policy considerations would dictate whether the Progressive Democrats could participate in a coalition. </p><p> <#> Warning that his party would not be <quote> "bounced" </quote> into a coalition, Mr Pat Rabbitte of Democratic Left said the issues had to be carefully considered. <#> Politicians in Leinster House said they believed the new administration would ultimately consist of a three-party government since such an arrangement provided more Cabinet seats for each party and meant fewer complications in policy implementation. </p><p> <#> It is understood that Labour would prefer to see Democratic Left accompany it in a new alliance, and while Fine Gael would favour the PDs it would also find Democratic Left acceptable. </p><p> <#> In the carve-up of Cabinet seats, both the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left would fight for two seats.</p></I><I><W2C-012$B><h> <bold> <#> At times it was like a show trial </bold><#> By Joe Carroll </h><p> <#> THE Fianna Fail faces told it all. <#> The once sleek, confident Ministers slumped in their seats. <#> The backbenchers seemed dazed as Albert and Bertie gave at times weird versions of who said what to whom and when.</p><p> <#> The new Attorney General whose researchers are turning over forgetful Ministers and officials with clinical efficiency, was not in the chamber. <#> But his version of what he found on the famous Monday, when Albert and his Ministers put together the speech which never mentioned the Duggan case and brought down the Government, is amazing. </p><p> <#> Pat Rabbitte interjected that it sounded like a <quote> "psychiatric report" </quote> .</p><p> <#> As the AG put it, the Fianna Fail Ministers that day <quote> "were behaving in a very disorganised manner. <#> No-one appeared to be in charge...Ministers came in and out at will. <#> The confession was added to by the manifest tiredness of all concerned. <#> I am informed that this was due to long hours without sleep."</quote> </p><p> <#> The following night they were at it again in the small hours drafting Albert 's gut-Harry-Whelehan speech. <#> The AG was summoned from his bed at 3 a.m. <#> The sight he saw at that time he passes over in merciful silence.</p><p> <#> Albert seemed offended that it was reported that the AG <quote> "paid a private visit to my apartment in Ballsbridge to apprise me of the Duggan case. <#> I wish to state categorically that the Attorney General never set foot in my apartment." </quote> <#> One wonders if he ever will. </p><p> <#> One after the other Fianna Fail Ministers stood up to account for their movements on the famous Monday. <#> Michael Woods had the best alibi, although he did at one stage actually see the AG at the <quote> "loose, ad-hoc meeting" </quote> .</p><p> <#> Bertie had to sit beside Albert when he gave the fatal speech and hand over <quote> "appropriate replies" </quote> , but <quote> "it was not my function to read them or analyse them. <#> Just hand them over" </quote> . </p><p> <#> It was not a pretty sight to see these once self-assured Ministers acting at times as if they were the already-doomed victims at a Stalinist show trial, while their contemptuous accusers toyed with and taunted them. </p><p> <#> Even Dick Spring, the Grand Inquisitor, was sorry for them. <#> <quote> "We all make mistakes and none of us are more than human" </quote> but <quote> "it is time for those involved to step aside" </quote> , he said chillingly. <#> It was an eerie echo of the invitation of a former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, to some other victims of circumstances to <quote> "stand aside"</quote> .</p><p> <#> Dick regretted <quote> "this sad end to what I believe was a potentially exciting development in Irish politics" </quote> . <#> But he could not <quote> "proceed with negotiations with Fianna Fail in good faith" </quote> after the <it> Irish Times </it> report was seen to be <quote> "essentially true" </quote> .</p><p> <#> Today there will be further interrogations of the luckless Ministers before a Dail committee. <#> But Dick has seen to it that they are yesterday 's men.</p><p> <#> Bertie, the man who would be Taoiseach, sadly listed all the <quote> "mistakes" </quote> Fianna Fail had made over Harry Whelehan and the sequel to his appointment. <#> <quote> "We have paid the price for those mistakes...but our conscience is clear." </quote> <#> Now they will <quote> "willingly accept the people 's verdict" </quote> . <#> But it is Dick 's verdict which counts. </p></I><I><W2C-012$C><h> <bold> <#> Cover-up by senior FF Ministers, says Harney </bold> </h><p> <#> THERE was a cover-up by senior Fianna Fail Ministers, the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Ms Mary Harney told the House. <#> Whichever Minister was <}> <-> resonsible </-> <+> responsible </+> </}> for the handwritten note attached to the supplementary reply on the Duggan case <quote> "knew exactly its significance" </quote> , she said.</p><p> <#> <quote> "They were anxious that the Taoiseach should not deviate because they knew that an unscripted Albert Reynolds would let them all down" </quote> . <#> Quoting the handwritten note - <quote> "If pressed on this question keep repeating the above" </quote> - Ms Harney said she had repeatedly asked who was the Minister who had written it. <#> It was <quote> "a laugh" </quote> that Fianna Fail, which had done so much to discredit the judiciary, was proposing to appoint a judge to inquire into its own behaviour. </p><p> <#> She said that other questions had not been answered. <#> Why had the Attorney General, Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, felt obliged in his letter to the Taoiseach on November 15th to say that the reply was the best he could do but that it did not answer the question? </p><p> <#> <quote> "I have to laugh,"</quote> Ms Harney continued, <quote> "when I heard the new Fianna Fail leader talk about openness, transparency and accountability" </quote> .</p><p> <#> She said that of course the party would want a judge to look at their behaviour, because they would be in government before the outcome would be known, and if there was a general election, the matter would be sub judice.</p><p> <#> The Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, interrupted: <quote> "That is incorrect." </quote> <#> Ms Harney: <quote> "If so, why do you want a judge?" </quote> <#> Mr Ahern: <quote> "Because I 'd rather a judge than you." </quote> </p><p> <#> Ms Harney asked if the acting Minister for Social Welfare, Dr Woods, had gone to the homes of Mr Fitzsimons. <#> She pointed out that if the Government had told the truth in the Dail on November 14th-15th, and said that Mr Whelehan had been asked to <quote> "consider his position" </quote> , then Mr Whelehan 's swearing in as President of the High Court would have been postponed and would have lapsed after 10 days.</p><p> <#> She said Official A in the Attorney General 's Office was supposed to take the blame, that he did not understand paedophilia, that he was too busy with other things. </p><p> <#> She was delighted, even <quote> "at this 11th hour"</quote> , that the house was beginning to get answers. <#> <quote> "I don't believe we have got the whole truth." </quote> <#> She said, it was a poor reflection on parliamentary democracy that the truth was coming out because of a leak to a journalist. <#> It was only then that Labour pulled back. <#> But she added that information had come out only because the Labour Party took the position it did.</p><p> <#> The only place for Fianna Fail was in opposition, she said. <#> There were alternatives, and a new administration had to be the first one. <#> It had to be truly frank and open. <#> She said the truth had not come out about the Masri passport affair. <#> There had been the beef tribunal, and the tax amnesty. <#> So a lack of openness and transparency was not just something that had happened in the past three weeks. </p><p> <#> Ms Harney pointed out that everybody had to play their part in the task of putting a truly open and viable government in place. <#> That was important. <#> If that could not be done then <quote> "we should not be afraid to consult the people" </quote> .</p><p> <#> She said there was a tendency in Fianna Fail that <quote> "you must cover things up and the worst thing of all is being caught" </quote> . <#> She advised the 650,000 decent and honourable people who voted for Fianna Fail in the last election to be more discerning. </p></I><I><W2C-012$D><h> <quote> <ul> 'Every judicial move I make is interpreted as being against somebody'</quote> </ul> </h><h> <bold> <#> Italy 's white-knight magistrate resigns </bold> </h><h> <bold> ITALY </bold> </h><h> <#> Paddy Agnew, Rome </h><p> <#> Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the magistrate who has become Italy 's best-known corruption investigator, resigned yesterday, prompting a probable political storm. </p><p> Mr Di Pietro has been a key figure in the celebrated, nearly three-year Tangentopoli inquiry that brought down Italy 's corrupt Christian Democrat and Socialist old guard. </p><p> <#> In a letter to his superior, Milan 's chief prosecutor, Mr Francesco Severio Borelli, Mr Di Pietro said he hoped his resignation would <quote> "depersonalise" </quote> the Milan-based Tangentopoli enquiry, adding that he was tired of <quote> "being used" </quote> by many different shades of political opinion.</p><p> <#> The letter went on: <quote> "Every judicial move I have made has been interpreted as being against somebody or something ... <#> For that reason, in a spirit of service and with death in my heart, I am leaving the judiciary." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Di Pietro 's resignation is the most obvious manifestation yet of tensions between he Tangentopoli pool and the right-wing government of the prime Minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi. </p><p> <#> Last July the government was forced to drop proposals banning the use of preventive detention, a key element in the investigative methods of Mr Di Pietro and his colleagues, when its proposed emergency legislation prompted widespread public protests. </p><p> <#> At the time, opposition forces suspected Mr Berlusconi of wishing to block the Tangentopoli investigation into his own <*> dollar sign </*> 7 billion Fininvest company. <#> Indeed shortly after the failed government decree, Mr Berlusconi 's Fininvest employee, Mr Salvatore Sciascia, were arrested, charged with paying bribes to tax inspectors.</p><p> <#> Two weeks ago Mr Berlusconi himself was notified that he was under investigation on possible corruption and bribery charges. </p><p> <#> In the meantime, however, the government is fighting back at the magistrates, by sending in judicial inspectors to assess their work, and with a Supreme Court decision last week which moved the section of the Tangentopoli inquiry relative to Mr Berlusconi away from the Milan magistrates and awarded it to their colleagues in nearby Brescia.</p><p> <#> Mr Borelli said last night that the Milan pool would continue its investigative work, despite Judge Di Pietro 's resignation. <#> But the fact that a man who had become a symbol of reform found himself forced to resign was a point underlined by the industrialist, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, one of many public figures to regret Mr Di Pietro 's resignation. <#> He said: <quote> "If Di Pietro is to resign like this, then we 've lost one of the key figures in the Italian revolution...a man who was a symbol for all Italians. <#> His resignation could have very negative consequences for Italy 's image."</quote> </p><p> <#> The opposition leader, Mr Massimo D'Alema, secretary of the Democratic Left (PDS), blamed the government. <#> <quote> "This resignation is proof that apart from proving a failure in its social and economic policies, this government is involved in creating a climate of restoration of the old corrupt system,"</quote> he said.</p><p> <#> Mr Di Pietro was hard at work in Milan yesterday, concluding the state 's case in the Enimont trial, Italy 's <quote> "mother of all corruption cases" </quote> . <#> Twenty-four defendants, including the former Prime Minister and Socialist leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, and the present Northern League leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, are accused of having accepted illegal payments into party offers by the Montedison chemical group.</p></I>
