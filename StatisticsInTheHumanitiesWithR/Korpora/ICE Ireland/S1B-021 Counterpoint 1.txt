<ICE-IRE:S1B-021 Counterpoint 1><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> And so to our studio panel <#> Father Brian D'arcy <,> uh he 's a native of Fermanagh but spent many years in the Republic before he returned to Northern Ireland <#> Brian D'arcy is a regular broadcaster and Sunday newspaper columnist <#> Doctor Bill Rolston lectures in sociology at the University of Ulster and he has written extensively on Northern Ireland <#> And joining us from Dublin is Michael Farrell <,> a leading light in the civil rights movement of the late sixties and he is now a practising lawyer <#> Now Michael Farrell <,> do you think people would be surprised in the Republic uh by that opinion poll survey that says like only fifty-two percent of Catholics really want a united Ireland<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$B> <#> Well I think there have been a few reports like that recently <#> Uhm I myself would think that perhaps a more relevant question is to ask uh how many of them are satisfied with the present situation in Northern Ireland because I think the the the real problem is that there is a conflict in the North and that clearly the the Nationalist population are discontent with the present situation <,> whatever they think the the ultimate answer to it is<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> But sorry <,> isn't that <.> separa </.> I mean you 've got to separate peace from a united Ireland as the only outcome of peace and then take a look at who wants a united Ireland<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$B> <#> Well I think that peace is only likely to come I I 'm not saying that peace can only come with a united Ireland but I think that peace is only likely to come when you have a settlement which addresses the concerns of the the Nationalist uh minority in the North and I think that still a very substantial section of that minority <,> uh they may not want a united Ireland overnight but I think they certainly do want something like joint authority <#> They want something where the Southern government has a role in the governance of the North in order to act as a as a protector to them against a return to undiluted Unionist rule<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> Bill Rolston <,> from uh your point of view as a sociologist <,> have you been surprised by anything you 've seen and heard tonight<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$C> <#> No <,> I I think that as a sociologist I have a scepticism about opinion polls at the best of times and especially opinion polls that <,> that ask for so much in in such a simple question <#> Uh the interesting thing to me is not so much the fifty-two percent who want the united Ireland or say they want the united Ireland <,> but the other forty-eight percent who have either answered no or are undecided <#> Now <,> <.> w </.> what is contained in that no or that <.> un </.> indecision <#> Is it <,> uh I don't want it right now uh I don't want it if it means I have to lose out uh economically uh I don't want it if it means that uh assassinations are going to increase because the Loyalists would be angry <#> I mean there there 's so many things contained in those nos and undecideds that <.> th </.> to me that 's the interesting thing and you 'd need you 'd need more of an opinion poll a deeper set of questions to get at some of those nuances<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> Brian D'arcy <{1> <[1> out </[1> out in the country <,> do you get the impression that that one of the things Bill refers to there that is I don't want a united Ireland if I 'm not going to be as well off as I am <{2> <[2> is a big issue </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-021$D> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-021$D> <#> <[2> Well </[2> </{2> <,> yeah you <.> ge </.> you certainly get that but I actually think the whole idea of the discussion tonight has has shown precisely the point that Bill and Brian both have mentioned <,> and Michael have both have mentioned <#> And that is that uh uh when you <.> sa </.> ask the simple question like uh do you want a united Ireland or do you not want a united Ireland the <.> nu </.> the differences in nuances and in opinions and in in the aspirations of what that phrase meant are so great that you can't get a yes or no answer to it <#> And it 's <,> I think it 's foolish to ask that question <#> The declaration itself has very clearly stated that we have got to in in paragraph one <,> we 've got to overcome the legacy of history <#> We have got to have a totality of relationships examined <#> Now I think that 's where we have to start <#> It is not simply <,> do you want an old green-eyed monster like a Nationalist idea of a uh united Ireland or do you want Unionist Orange domination as we had before is that if that 's what means going back to some sort of peace <#> If those are the two alternatives most of us don't want either <#> Uh but uh you know the whole structures uh have to change <,> uh both North and South <#> The political <.> f </.> feeling in the South for the last number of years has been changing and changing drastically and how we 're hardly able to keep up to pace with it <,> the fact that this declaration come is a <.> pe </.> supreme example of that <#> If Fianna Fa/il had been in government on its own <,> this declaration would not have been possible <,> because the tail of Fianna Fa/il would have not allowed that to happen <#> Nor would the Fianna Fa/il party on its own been trusted by the Unionists <#> So there 's development in the South and not here and that is a major problem that we 're going to have to work with<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> Okay <#> <.> M </.> Michael Farrell if it 's a little simplistic perhaps to ask that question <,> do you or do you not want Irish unity isn't it also very simplistic of people to assume that all Catholics in Northern Ireland are by definition Nationalists <#> Something that probably Protestants here and maybe a lot of people in the South would assume<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$B> <#> Well that 's that 's uh true that perhaps people haven't seen the complexities of all this and they haven't perhaps seen the complexities of the Unionist side that there are there 're shades of Unionism too <#> Uh but uh I think you come back to the the situation where you have uh <,> an intolerable situation today in Northern Ireland <#> I think that after twenty-five years people are looking again at the the solution <#> And the old verities are not as as as easily acceptable now <#> Maybe on either side people are realising you 've got to to resolve this problem one way or another <,> and an attempt is being made now through the the the Downing Street Declaration the peace process to uh resolve it and certain uh home truths have been accepted on on all sides or on some of the sides anyway <#> You know on the Nationalist side I think it has been accepted that the Unionists cannot be coerced into a united Ireland and it it would appear from the poll that not all the Catholics want to be in the united Ireland either <#> But equally uh I think it 's implicit in the process though I I would have welcomed a much more explicit recognition by the British government <,> that the the Nationalists do have grievances that they do have a sense of identity that needs to be recognised and given some institutional form in whatever new arrangements are put in place even if they 're only interim arrangements moving towards a solution and none of us is is sure what the the the final outcome will be<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> Bill Rolston <#> What would be the most important question that could be asked of the people of Northern Ireland or perhaps of the whole island at the moment<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$C> <#> Uh uh it 's <,> it 's uh one question but it 's uh it 's a whole Pandora 's box of questions contained in it <#> And I think the the the question is <,> <.> w </.> what is the Ireland that you want to see <#> I mean even the fifty-two percent who said they wanted a united Ireland <,> I don't presume that every one of them means the same thing by it <#> Uh <,> some of them may want <,> uh have a very secular definition <,> some may be very conservative et-cetera et-cetera <#> So I think it 's <,> I think that that that the thing that I would most like to see is much more of a debate about what do these old <,> well-tried slogans mean <#> They may have meant something in the past and as Mike insinuates here <.> the </.> they they may be changing <,> and as Brian said too <#> But I would really like to see much more of a debate <#> The trouble is that <,> very often people are quite scared to debate these things because they feel that uh <,> that that that the atmosphere is not right for them to say what they really feel <,> that someone is going to take severe exception to this and and so the debate is stifled before it begins<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> Is it alive down uh in in Fermanagh Brian where you might have neighbours who are either side of an invisible border<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$D> <#> Uhm yeah <,> yes uh very much alive in Fermanagh <#> It has been traditionally that kind of place where there 's been a pretty even divide all along the way <#> Uhm I suppose by and large though Fermanagh is the place that brings into focus the kind of new Ireland we 're going to have to look at <#> And that is a situation whereby I think the old economic structures which the economists seem to <.> s </.> be stuck in <,> I mean Graham Gudgeon 's uh uh way way of looking at things <.> i </.> is certainly outdated uh and and doesn't make much sense at all uh even what he was saying about Germany <,> and I <.> me </.> <.> d </.> he seems to forget that the rest of Europe paid for the urification <&> unification </&> of Germany <,> not just one part of it <#> <{> <[> Well </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> <[> But </[> </{> somebody would have to pay for the unification of Ireland <#> There 's no question about that <#> <{1> <[1> <.> Ei </.> either Britain </[1> continues its subvention or somebody makes it up <{2> <[2> <,> or we </[2> all get very poor<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$D> <#> <[1> Yes yes </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-021$D> <#> <[2> Right but </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-021$D> <#> Uh precisely <#> But but we we we do have to think about new structures <,> that 's precisely the point I 'm trying to make <#> And we have to think about how come that Northern Ireland the people of all of the people of Northern Ireland generally speaking are divided into rich and poor which is a far greater divide than the rich between than the Protestants and Catholics <#> Now what 's the cause of that <#> How come that a wee <.> fam </.> uh uhm <.> fa </.> farmer in Fermanagh uh is not uh as well treated as a farmer in in the east of the province <,> whether he be a Protestant or a Catholic <#> How come that Derry seems to be getting all the factories and wee places like Fermanagh are not getting any <#> How how come <,> uh how come that <.> i </.> in in a situation of of jobs and and that it 's the people from that part of the province that have to emigrate <#> There 's an economical question here that 's a far bigger thing that has been mystified by this invented border that you talked about<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> Bill Rolston do you think this was just perhaps the case that we 're we 're not ready either for peace or for a united Ireland if that was the eventual outcome cos we haven't explored the questions fully enough<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$C> <#> Oh yeah <#> The the that may be so but on on the other hand that would be a recipe for for inaction forever if that 's all you believed <#> I think there is a circle here that has to be broken and breaking the circle is going to be painful <#> Uh <,> and I think that <,> I I I think that that the point is that that things have to be said <,> things have to be explored <#> Like for example just to take up something there <,> uh I don't think that that it necessarily follows that a united Ireland is a poorer Ireland <#> Uh <,> the banks the trade unions the churches sporting associations the EC everybody believes in cross-border co-operation now <,> and they must believe that because they feel that it is economically sound <#> Now I don't know it 's been a a <,> a socialist argument for a lot of years that that a united Ireland with partition out of the way would be a more economically sound Ireland <#> That 's worth exploring<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> Michael Farrell in five seconds would you agree with Bill Rolston<ICE-IRE:S1B-021$B> <#> I do yes <#> I think first of all there <,> there has to be a peace dividend if there is peace <#> You know all the money that 's been pumped into the military solution could be pumped into the civil solution <#> I think all economists recognise that uh an all-Ireland economy would make much more sense than a a fragmented economy <#> And I think that <.> i </.> in the end of the day I mean <,> uh you I come back to an intolerable situation with three thousand plus people <{> <[> dead <,> we have to end it </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-021$A> <#> <[> Okay well <,> we 'll have to leave it there <.> Mich </.> </[> </{> <#> Okay Michael Farrell in Dublin thanks very much <#> Brian D'arcy Bill Rolston here <#> Thank you</I>
