occasions? </p><p> <#> For the Royal family, it is indeed a long, long way from the glittering splendour of St Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, to a cramped kirk in the north of Scotland. </p><p> <bold> <it> <#> If the mighty have not fallen, they are certainly humbled. </it> </bold> </p><p> <#> As the Queen watched yesterday 's short ceremony, she must surely have mused upon the recent fortunes, or rather misfortunes, of her children. </p><p> <#> So, too, must her sons, Andrew and Charles, as they listened to the words of their sister 's second betrothal. </p><p> <#> Where the Monarchy goes from here depends upon where it choses to take itself. <#> It is not the media's probing nor the public's fault that things have got out of hand. </p><p> <bold> <it> <#> The actions of the Royals themselves are responsible for the change in the public 's perception of them and the very real threat to the future standing of the Monarchy itself. </it> </bold> </p><p> <#> From Andrew and Sarah Ferguson to Charles and Diana Spencer, too many ordinary frailties and failings have been exposed already. </p><p> <bold> <it> <#> The Emperors have not quite lost their clothes but they are in need of a good dry-clean. </it> </bold> </p><p> <#> That the Queen and her family are mere mortals like the rest of us was never so apparent as now. <#> Things royal can never be the same again. </p></I><I><W2E-002$B><h> <#> Now is the moment to press ahead </h><p> <bold> <#> JIM Molyneaux is set to give the Prime Minister a piece of his mind when the pair meet this week. </bold> </p><p> <#> The Unionist leader is fed up to the teeth with the Government 's kid glove handling of the IRA and Sinn Fein. </p><p> <#> And his Democtratic Unionist colleague, Dr Ian Paisley - who is also demanding talks with the PM - feels likewise. </p><p> <#> Mr Major has no one but himself to blame if he is sent reeling from a Unionist backlash against the <quote> "special understanding" </quote> they have with his Government. </p><p> <#> He promised before Christmas that if the Provos kept shooting he would crack down hard on them. </p><p> <#> Well, we 're half way through March, the guns are still blazing away and the security situation still leaves a lot to be desired. </p><p> <#> Much plain speaking will be done at Downing Street in the coming days. </p><p> <#> Messrs Molyneaux and Paisley, will demand to know just what the British and Irish governments are playing at. </p><p> <#> They will rightly argue that, as London and Dublin dither, decent people on both sides of the religious divide are suffering at the hands of so-called loyalist and IRA paramilitaries. </p><p> <#> Even the double mortar attack on Heathrow airport failed to bring the security response necessary to stop it happening again. </p><p> <#> By all accounts the Provos and Sinn Fein have rejected the peace accord. </p><p> <bold> <it> <#> So now is the time to press ahead - on the security and political front. </it> </bold> </p><p> <#> Jim Molyneaux, Ian Paisley, John Hume and John Alderdice are not accountable to any armed factions. </p><p> <#> The politicians who are have no one to blame but themselves if a settlement is reached over their heads. </p><p> <#> And the sooner that comes about the better. </p></I><I><W2E-002$C><h> <#> Worse than animals </h><p> <bold> <#> The behaviour of loyalist paramilitaries in interrogation centres is nothing short of disgusting. </bold> </p><p> <#> They are reported to be behaving worse than animals during questioning by RUC detectives. </p><p> <#> Now the police are hitting back. </p><p> <#> They have shown they are prepared to bring them to court on indecency charges. </p><p> <#> Boasting of such repugnant behaviour while hiding behind the cloak of anonymity is one thing. </p><p> <bold> <it> <#> Having your name published after a court case is quite another. </it> </bold> </p></I><I><W2E-002$D><h> <#> Will Aras soon get a new tenant? </h><p> <#> AT a time when Ireland is facing a period of renewed uncertainty over the peace process, the entire island clearly needs as much long-term political stability as possible. </p><p> <#> Many people will therefore have been alarmed by speculation that President Mary Robinson may stand down when her term of office expires in 1997. </p><p> <#> By common consent, Mrs Robinson has been one of the most outstanding presidents in the history of the state. </p><p> <#> Her election four years ago may well have been an act of political serendipity, in that only a self-inflicted blow prevented Fianna Fail 's Brian Lenihan from securing the highest office in the land. </p><p> <#> However, having topped the polls against all the odds, Mrs Robinson immediately set out to re-define the position of the presidency in modern Ireland. </p><p> <#> She has succeeded in a way few could have predicted, and has helped to transform the image not only of her office but also of her country. </p><p> <#> Mrs Robinson has travelled to every corner of Ireland, and has proved a particularly welcome visitor on this side of the border. </p><p> <#> She has managed to establish a rapport with unionists which would have been almost unthinkable in the past, and also found the time to meet with Gerry Adams in west Belfast. </p><p> <#> In addition, northerners from a wide variety of backgrounds have accepted invitations to attend functions at her official residence in Phoenix Park. </p><p> <#> Mrs Robinson has also become a major figure on the world stage through her trips to Europe, the USA, Asia, Australia and most poignantly Somalia. </p><p> <#> In particular, her discussions with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace were of huge symbolic importance. </p><p> <#> She will undoubtedly add to her long list of achievements before her term of office is completed. </p><p> <#> Were she to allow her name to go forward for re-election, the outcome of the poll would be a mere formality. </p><p> <#> Indeed, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael might well feel there would be little point in fielding a candidate against Mrs Robinson. </p><p> <#> The possibility that she might rule herself out of the race has not so far been widely considered. </p><p> <#> However, the fact is that Mrs Robinson has not yet committed herself to seeking a second seven-year spell at the Aras. </p><p> <#> Just days ago, one of the USA 's most influential newspapers, the Boston-Globe, suggested that the president was a strong contender to emerge as the next Secretary General of the United Nations. </p><p> <#> The outgoing Secretary General, Boutros Boutros Ghali, who is due to retire in 1996, had lengthy private talks with Mrs Robinson only last week. </p><p> <#> Some sources have also suggested that the president could be in line for a seat at either the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg or the World Court in the Hague. </p><p> <#> She may even feel she has had enough of the limelight, and want to spend more time with her family at their new home in Co Mayo. </p><p> <#> Mrs Robinson is her own woman and must make up her own mind, but the simple truth is that Ireland needs her in the Phoenix Park. </p><p> <#> She had accomplished much, but much still needs to be done. <#> A second term would allow her a unique opportunity to review and develop the constitutional role of the presidency. </p><p> <p> Her continued presence at the head of the state would also reassure unionists during what still seems likely to be a crucial period in the history of the island. </p><p> <#> For these and many other reasons, Mary Robinson must be the president to lead Ireland into the 21st century. </p></I><I><W2E-002$E><h> <#> Unsporting thought of a petty mind </h><p> <#> The news that Unionist MP John Taylor is delighted, for petty political reasons, when Ireland lose international rugby matches is most illuminating. </p><p> <#> In the first place, the expression on his face when the Irish gained their famous victory over England at Twickenham last month would have been priceless. </p><p> <#> Indeed, had the boys in green been aware of their ability to annoy Mr Taylor simply by winning matches, the Triple Crown, Five Nations Championship and Grand Slam would no doubt already be in the bag. </p><p> <#> On a more serious note, the Strangford MP 's views are an insult to the many Ulster Protestants - including RUC members - who have represented Ireland with such distinction over the years. </p><p> <#> Almost every major sport, with the obvious exception of soccer, is organised on an all-Ireland basis. </p><p> <#> Friendships made on the field of play frequently cut across political and religious barriers in a way which Mr Taylor - whose first sporting love is Glasgow Rangers FC - clearly cannot comprehend. </p><p> <#> It may not be long before he issues a statement complaining about the fact that Ireland play on a green pitch. </p></I><I><W2E-002$F><h> <#> Airport delays mean more than murders </h><p> <#> THE IRA has, according to the evidence of the past few days, adapted the nation of talking peace and carrying a big stick. </p><p> <#> Three attacks on Heathrow Airport, the possibility of further 'spectaculars' and now the sweet-sounding statement about peace show that the Provisionals are just as capable as anyone else of looking in two directions at the same time. </p><p> <#> The Heathrow attacks were not just designed to hit the headlines. <#> The fact that three were launched on such a sensitive target served to embarrass the British security forces. <#> The IRA seemed to send a mocking signal with the fact that none of the mortars exploded. <#> The next time things could be different. </p><p> <#> It proved total security is a myth and that the IRA retains the abiltity to strike a range of targets. <#> It also served to make ordinary members of the British public feel threatened by the IRA's bombing capacity. </p><p> <#> Before, it was the City of London and the London Underground. <#> Now, it is London's main airport. <#> Even Queen Elizabeth is threatened. <#> She landed at Heathrow during one of the alerts. </p><p> <#> For many ordinary British people, the bombers of the IRA must seem to be everywhere. <#> This, in turn, will filter through the British political system and increase pressure on the establishment to divert from its present course. </p><p> <#> As always, the fact that lives have been lost in Northern Ireland during the airport bombings has been all but ignored. <#> Delayed planes at Heathrow mean more than dead police officers or civilians across the Irish Sea. </p><p> <#> Last night's underlining of the republican movement 's proclaimed dedication to peace must be seen in the context of the violence of recent days and it demands a response. </p><p> <#> In an interview given to this newspaper by Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, the IRA has its answer. <#> The declaration signed in Downing Street should be enough to enable an immediate cessation of violence. </p><p> <#> Then, and only then, can initial contacts with other parties and the Irish government be made through a Forum For Peace And Reconciliation which will pave the way to full inter-party talks and negotiations with the British. </p><p> <#> Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major have declared their commitment to the declaration and the process it initiates in such a way that backing down is not on the agenda. <#> The IRA should recognise that. </p><p> <#> It should be made clear that participants in future talks do not, as the taoiseach makes clear in the Irish News today, need to endorse every syllable of the Downing Street document. </p><p> <#> But what they should be in no doubt about is the fact that since December 15 and the agreeing of the declaration, both governments have gone further than either - and especially the British - has done to date. <#> It is unlikely that more significant movement is likely. </p><p> <#> The Provisionals are great believers in the 'one last push' theory of violence. </p><p> <#> To believe that now would be a deadly mistake which will be measured only by the size of Northern Ireland 's death toll. </p><p> <#> If that theory held any water, why have centuries of conflict and, more recently, 25 years of vicious violence not delivered Utopia? </p><p> <#> The two premiers have stressed their belief that the airport bombers and all the rest of them are tragically mistaken if they think that another London blitz will change the status quo. </p><p> <#> Progress will come but only via constitutional politics. <#> To Sinn Fein, the door is open. </p></I>
