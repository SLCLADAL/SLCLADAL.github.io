<W1B-008 Home news><I><W1B-008$A><h> <#> 22-9-94 </h><p> <#> Darling Ciara, <#> Got your letter this morning and was so happy to hear how well you 're getting on - but it made me wish so much that I could be with you! <#> It sounds <ul> so </ul> brilliant. <#> But, one thing is puzzling me, why have you not yet spoken to all the hunky men you say are all around? <#> Better get a move on, before they are all snapped up! <#> There are <ul> no </ul> hunky men here but at the moment I 'm sitting opposite Aoife 's Jim in the library so I 'd better not let him see this in case he gets offended! <#> They 're still in lurve! <#> I haven't done too much since I last wrote - the <}> <-> freshers </-> <+> freshers ' </+> </}> ball was on last night but none of us went to it. <#> Steve did come to aerobics with <unclear> 2 words </unclear> as did Gordon and it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen. <#> Their coordination was so bad that Steve managed to kick me in the head at one stage! <#> Steven and Martin start back at J'town today are are <ul> so </ul> excited about it. <#> Martin phoned me up last night and we 'd a great hour long chat but I 'll fill you in on that later. <#> Keep having fun but take care. </p><p> <#> All my love, <ul> EMMA </ul> xo </p></I><I><W1B-008$A><h> <#> 23-11-94 </h><p> <#> Darling Ciara, <#> Thought I would send this funky postcard to brighten up your day! <#> Dillon reminds me loads of Sammy so you can put it on your wall to remind you of your beloved toe-rag!! <#> Life has got slightly more interesting since I last wrote to you. <#> Eva and I are hoping to see 'Wuthering Heights' in the G.O.H. tonight. <#> At the weekend we five remaining girls are going to Cushendall (at last!) on Saturday for a night of drunken debauchery, which should be a good laugh and I 'm sure we 'll have lots of drinks on you! <#> On Friday we have a medical pub crawl for children in need (yes <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> that time of the year again) so all in all it should be a fun <*> plus sign </*> drunken weekend! </p><p> <#> We have a professor from Trinidad staying in our house at the moment. <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> a bit of a nuisance but he 's really nice and interesting. <#> The boys have arrived back from their waterpolo trip relatively unscathed but rather hung over. <#> John and Tim both two-timed their respective "girlfriends" (i.e. Mary + Rosie) and who is surprised at that? <#> We 'll miss you a lot up in Cushendall, as always. <#> With all my love and hugs <*> plus sign </*> kisses, <#> EMMA. </p></I><I><W1B-008$A><h> <#> 20th November 1994 </h><p> <#> My dearest Ciara, <#> I just thought I would beat the rush and be the first person to send you a card for Christmas '94. <#> I got your letter yesterday and was dead jealous of the brill time you 're having. <#> I 'd really love to come over in January when you are off. <#> I have an exam on Jan 24th so maybe I could fly over after that (if I get loads of money for Christmas / win the national lottery / rob a bank) and join in all your wonderful socialising. <#> This has been the most boring weekend ever. <#> Steve is in Cookstown for some SDLP thing. <#> Martin and John are in <}> <-> Clonmell </-> <+> Clonmel </+> </}> for the Freshers waterpolo competition. <#> And the remainder of us were too boring, tired and fed up to plan anything for ourselves. <#> On Friday night Ciaran and Sammy and Jim B. called to watch TV (The Friday night TV club as we have renamed ourselves) and last night I watched TV all alone. <#> Wow - the excitement is killing me!! </p><p> <#> I decided to revamp my bedroom this weekend (in lieu of a social life!) <#> I have painted my bedside cabinet "moonshine blue" and my shelves and headboard "<}> <-> mulbury </-> <+> mulberry </+> </}> crush" and they look completely different and I feel as if I have a new room! <#> In the midst of my painting I got locked out of the house in my t-shirt, jeans and socks. <#> There was no-one else home so I crossed over to our neighbours looking like some deranged maniac with paint up my arms, face and hair and no shoes on to use their phone. <#> I called Ciaran who came and rescued me. <#> Firstly we tried to break into the house but after failing at that he drove me down to <}> <-> Jonathans </-> <+> Jonathan 's </+> </{> to get his key - thankfully he was in and the story ended happily - <&French> "Tout est bien, qui finit bien - n'est ce pas?!" </&French> <#> We then headed off to Budget DIY and chose the "<}> <-> Mulbury </-> <+> Mulberry </+> </}> Crush" paint which was in fact the highlight of my entire weekend! <#> Sorry this is such a boring card but there is really not much to tell. <#> The only good news is that my mum and dad are going to Lanzarote from Dec 29th - Jan 5th so we 'll have lots of Christmas parties in your honour! </p><p> <#> BJ says she is feeling much more positive about the Tim saga - which is a good sign - I only hope it lasts as she deserves to be cheered up. <#> Rachel and Alex had their first <}> <-> lovers </-> <+> lovers ' </+> </}> tiff on Friday night because he went home to Armagh on Thursday night without telling her. <#> She gave him a real telling off and I 'm sure he 's really upset as he is so crazy about her. <#> He sent her a love-letter to her work on Tuesday! <#> Isn't that so sweet?! <#> Anyway, that 's the height of our bizz for the moment. <#> I 'll try and find something interesting to write about next time and if not I 'll just make it up!! </p><p> <#> See you <ul> soon </ul> - Yeah! <#> All my love, <#> <ul> Emma </ul> xoxoxoxoxox </p></I><I><W1B-008$A><h> <#> Saturday, 14th January 1995 </h><p> <#> Darling Ciara, <#> Well, I promised I would write today so here I am. <#> I 'm actually cheating as it is 1.15am so really it is Sunday, 15th but I 'm sure you 'll find it in your heart to forgive me. <#> How do you like my new fancy writing paper that Mum and Dad brought me back from Lanzarote? <#> It 's scented but I don't know if the smell will last from here to Belgium - go on and smell it. <#> Well, what do you think? <#> To smell or not to smell? <#> You 'll have to let me know for future reference (for all my love letters etc) - NOT!!! </p><p> <#> B-J and I have just spent a very civilised but most enjoyable evening together. <#> We visited our favourite haunt - yes you 've guessed it - The Other Place in Botanic and sat in the window for hours drinking milkshakes and eating chocolate cake - yum yum! <#> We had some very enlightening conversations about love, life and the universe and all in all it was a very entertaining and relaxing Saturday night. </p><p> <#> Other than that the most exciting thing I have done since we parted is visited B <*> plus sign </*> Q garden centre with my dad. <#> He broke our outside light whilst trying to change the bulb so we had to such out and buy a new one before mum got home and noticed the old one had been smashed! <#> Under the thumb or what!! </p><p> <#> I hope your flight went well and that you are glad to be reunited with all your Belgium family again. </p><p> <#> I am knackered now and have nothing else interesting to say so I 'll bid you good night and resume this tomorrow. </p><h> <#> 15-1-95 </h><p> <#> I 've just arrived back from a lovely afternoon in the Ferns and will finish this now so that you will receive it a.s.a.p. <#> I was down for dinner and we had a really good time once I got over my usual initial weep at being in Downpatrick again. </p><p> <#> Eva was on the phone just now and seems v. excited about her trip to Belgium - I 'm so jealous of her. <#> It will be mega-depressing here with both you and her out of the country so forgive me for any morbid letters you get in the next fortnight! </p><p> <#> Martin called earlier and seems to be mega-laid back about his exams which start tomorrow - some things never change! <#> He says he has tomorrow morning to cover the 75 <*> per cent sign </*> of his course that he has yet to look at! </p><p> <#> I phoned Ciaran up yesterday and he seemed pretty miffed with me and it was a bit of a crap phonecall but he says Sammy seems right as rain again so don't you go worrying your pretty little head about him. </p><p> <#> I 'll head on now and swot up a bit on my Respiratory examination for <}> <-> tomorrows </-> <+> tomorrow 's </+> ward round. </p><p> <#> No doubt you 'll hear from me soon, <#> All my love, <#> Emma xoxo </p></I><I><W1B-008$A><h> <#> Sunday, January 29th 1995 </h><p> <#> Dearest Ciara, <#> Hello, my pet, how are you? <#> Glad to be reunited with your beloved wee sis. I bet! <#> I 'm so jealous of her getting away to visit you - I only wish I could do the same. <#> No doubt you 'll have a madly riotous time - can't wait to hear all the craic when BJ returns. </p><p> <#> So, we 're here at the end of yet another rivetingly exciting weekend in Belfast - NOT! <#> Friday as usual was Union night but still BJ and I have been unsuccessful on the Mullane front! <#> Fred wasn't actually there so at least BJ had an excuse! <#> I had a wee chat to David but that was the height of it. <#> Last night, Rachel and I went to see "Shallow Grave" with Ciaran and Sammy. <#> The film was really excellent but very gory and I spent half the film under the seat and the other half with my face buried in <}> <-> Rachels </-> <+> Rachel 's </+> </}> shoulder! <#> We had a hilarious time anyway as Rach and I <}> <-> where </-> <+> were </+> </}> trying our best not to look as if we were in a foursome with Ciaran and Sammy! <#> The two boys <}> <-> where </-> <+> were </+> </}> looking particularly unsavoury as <}> <-> Ciarans </-> <+> Ciaran 's </+> </}> hair is now at least 2 weeks past its "due a haircut stage" and Sammy was wearing a shirt and tie under his anorak!!! (as he 'd been for an interview with Marks and Spencers that day) <#> So Rach and I were leaping about in front of them in the queue and trying to <}> <-> loose </-> <+> lose </+> </}> them in the Pic'n'mix shop eh, eh!! <#> We were being total bitches about the whole thing but the boys didn't seem to notice!! </p><p> <#> Ciaran asked me on Thursday to go to the Pharmacy formal so I said I would. <#> I first of all tried to persuade him to take Siobhan but he said the evening is going to be very stressful for him as it is, with speeches etc, and if he took Siobhan it would be just too stressful for him to cope with! <#> Now that I 've said I 'll go I 'm actually quite looking forward to it. <#> It will be so nice to be out with a totally different crowd where nobody knows me or anything about me or Zach etc. <#> It 's on February 15th so now I 'm dress hunting. <#> BJ and I went shopping yesterday for your pressies (hope you like them - I 'm so jealous as I would love them all myself) and I ended up buying a red dress for myself for <*> pound sign </*> 7!! in Top Shop. <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> a nice dress but it 's not very fancy so I 'll keep my eyes open for any others I may see in the next fortnight. </p><p> <#> I 'm feeling totally stuffed and sick at the moment as we were out for Sunday lunch with Gran and Uncle Gerry today. <#> I got lentil croquettes in a mushroom sauce which was beautiful but the portions were too enormous for one person to manage - probably the chocolate fudge sundae I had for dessert didn't help much either!! </p><p> <#> I hope you are continuing to be well fed and watered and warm and all those other essential things. </p><p> <#> I 'll love you and leave you and wish you a wonderful birthday and a brilliant year being 22 (you old fogie) and send you a big birthday hug and kiss via Betty-Jane, <#> Lots of love and kisses and best wishes for Friday, <#> Emma xoxo </p><p> <#> Hope you like the birthday card and that it <}> <-> dosen't </-> <+> doesn't </+> </}> scare you too much! <#> Maybe you would be best <ul> NOT </ul> to stick this one up on your wall as if you came in v. drunk one night you might think it was real and trying <ul> TO EAT YOU </ul> !!!! </p></I>
