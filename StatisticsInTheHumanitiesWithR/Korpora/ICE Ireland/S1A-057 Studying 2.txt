</&><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah <,> I suppose so<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> So I mean <,> she 's obviously something wrong with her<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> So uhm <,> let me think<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> How what did you did you have a job this summer<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> Did I <#> Yeah I was working in a drug centre <{> <[> a drug treatment centre </[> <#> Yeah <,> well I 've been working there for the last four years<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> <[> Oh what was that like </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> So I don't know <#> I 'm got used to it but <,> yeah it 's grand like <#> It 's just a matter of <,> just writing down names and handing them in to the nurse 's station or whatever<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Mm<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> And <{> <[> uh </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> <[> And uh </[> </{> did you did you not find it depressing<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> In there <#> No <,> cos people like <,> they 're all inner city Dublin crowd <,> the majority of them are <,> and like <,> most of them are dead sound<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Mm mm<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> So <,> you know it 's interesting enough <#> But you get a bit of hassle like <,> and <,> once <,> wasn't <,> there someone had just gone at somebody before that <,> one of the women threw rocks through the window <,> smashed all the windows <,> uh like you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> You serious<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> Yeah <,> seriously<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> And were you inside the building when it happened<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> Was I inside <#> Yeah <,> yeah <#> And then there was another one who was in the porch <,> and she smashed in <#> She was cut off her course <,> and she smashed in the window and tried to climb through <,> and we had to try and kick her out <#> And she <,> the security guard ran out into the porch <,> and he grabbed her like <,> and she bit into his arm <,> and he threw her out into the street <,> and she started threatening us that she 'd inject us with AIDS and all this<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Oh <,> my God<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> So yeah it 's <,> you know though it 's interesting like <#> <{1> <[1> But you </[1> get a bit of hassle the odd <,> the odd <{2> <[2> time </[2> you know <#> Why what are you <,> are you working<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yes <#> I 'm working in a <,> in a pub in town <,> in the Blue Note bar in Oliver Plunkett Street<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> And <,> what is it <#> Are you behind the bar <,> or are you a lounge girl<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah yeah no I 'm behind behind I 'm <{> <[> behind </[> the bar yeah <#> It 's a fairly small pub like<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> <[> Oh are you </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> Yeah yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah <,> so I get to keep the bar by myself <#> But the only thing is that uhm <,> sometimes it can get really crowded in there and you 've got to clear the tables and serve at the bar and everything all at the same time like<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> And what 's the crowd are they old or <,> young or<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Uhm <,> middle <.> a </.> young to middle-aged and then some really old <,> you know <,> because it used to have it used to have a real <,> like it used to be a real <.> i </.> prestigious uh pub <#> It used to have all the legal crowd going in there from the South Mall and everything <,> and then it just turned into a sort of uh trendy <,> uh elitist intellectual thing and they all go in there <#> They think they 're really cool like <#> Uhm but some of the old guys still go in there who used be <{> <[> in the legal trade </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> <[> And </[> </{> you 're trying to get another job though aren't you<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Well <{> <[> no not any more <,> I 'd </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> <[> Well <,> you 've been offered one haven't you </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah <,> yeah <,> yeah <#> I thought I didn't like working there but now I 've decided that I do<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> You 've got used to it<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah so <,> I don't know what I 'm going to do about the other job because I told the other man I 'd work for him as well <#> <{> <[> So <,> I don't know </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> <[> And </[> </{> <,> are you going to hang on to that job for during the year like during college year<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah <,> I 'd <{> <[> say so <,> yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> <[> To get a bit </[> </{> extra money<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$A> <#> Yeah but the only thing is if I could get a day job it would be much better <,> I mean if I could maybe do afternoons in the Blue Note <#> But then you see that would clash with my schedule in college <,> but I don't want any late nights like <,> working <#> You know the late nights <,> I 'm going to spend on going out<ICE-IRE:S1A-057$B> <#> Yeah but I mean you 're not going to be studying til after Christmas <#> You know what I mean <#> In <{> <[> second year
