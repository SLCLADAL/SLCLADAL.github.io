<ICE-IRE:S2A-064 Injury submissions><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> The plaintiff is no longer a minor <#> Her date of birth My Lord is the sixth of October nineteen eighty-two <,> <#> She was sixteen and a half years of age when the accident happened My Lord <#> She 's now nineteen <#> And the accident My Lord happened on the sixteenth of April nineteen ninety-nine <#> Now the plaintiff My Lord had left school in uh September or October of nineteen ninety-eight when she was sixteen and she 'd had a a baby on the sixth of March nineteen ninety-nine My Lord <,> just a about month and a half or so before the subject 's accident <#> And what happened to her My Lord was on the afternoon of the sixteenth of April nineteen ninety-nine <,> she was walking along the Springfield Road in Belfast <,> when she fell on the pavement <#> She had been My Lord in a cousin 's house in the Beechmount area and she was intending to walk to her grandmother 's on the Grosvenor Road <#> And she fell My Lord on the footpath outside uh number ninety Springfield Road <,> which is uh called Peter Pan complex My Lord <#> It 's a training centre <#> I hand <,> should be before Your Lordship hopefully <,> uh three black and white photographs <,> from a Mr Ridley <,> a professional photographer <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> studios <,> and they show My Lord the uh subject area <#> The first photograph My Lord shows the plaintiff looking at the Peter Pan complex <,> number ninety <#> And then there is the photograph My Lord with a ruler in it<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Well they 're in a different order now before me<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> Oh sorry <#> I apologise for that My Lord<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Yeah <#> P p one is the one with the <.> photog </.> <,> with the ruler in it<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> Very well I 'll mark that for you My Lord <#> Then that is showing a close-up of the defect My Lord and I 'll describe how this plaintiff fell in a moment <#> Then there 's a photograph My Lord showing just the general area of footpath <,> no person in it <#> And then the defect in that photograph I should say My Lord is of course the middle <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> And then the photograph with the uh lady in it My Lord that is in fact the uh plaintiff and she 's looking there at number ninety My Lord and the defect is again close to the middle of the footpath halfway between <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> and the wall <#> And the plaintiff My Lord at the material time looking at that photograph with her in it My Lord would have been walking away from the camera <#> There 's then a further photograph My Lord taken by Mr McGee the engineer <,> uh a coloured photograph and in this photograph My Lord the plaintiff would be walking towards the camera <,> and the defect is beside what is apparently a potato crisp bag My Lord uh <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in the middle of the photograph <,> a piece of litter <,> and the defect is is there My Lord <#> And what happened the plaintiff My Lord is that as she walked along on that afternoon <,> her uh foot <,> uh the heel part of her foot My Lord<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Now which <,> which foot<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> She 's not entirely sure My Lord whether it was her right foot or left foot<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Well what <,> <.> i </.> it 's the heel of her foot<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> The heel of her foot <,> the heel of her shoe went into that depression My Lord which we say was about seven or eight inches long by five or six inches wide and an inch approximately deep <#> And that 's the defect which is shown My Lord in the black and white photograph <#> Her <,> her heel went into that and she uh caught and uh fell My Lord <#> She 's not entirely sure of the mechanics of her fall in terms of uh the way in which it happened other than she is adamant that her foot went into this depression My Lord <#> She fell and she fell towards her left side My Lord <#> She put out her left arm to attempt to break her fall and unfortunately she suffered a nasty fracture to her left elbow <#> She was immediately aware My Lord of uh <,> severe pain in the left arm <,> and being quite close to the Royal Victoria Hospital My Lord she went immediately to the uh Casualty Department <#> And when she arrived there My Lord she was X-rayed and it was discovered that she had suffered a supracondylar fracture of the left elbow and the uh doctor who examined her at that time wanted to admit her and carry out an immediate operation to the left arm My Lord <,> but the plaintiff at the time My Lord <,> uh <,> was most anxious to get out of hospital and return to her baby and she uh contrary to medical advice <,> left the hospital <#> She went home My Lord <,> uh <,> her baby was due to be christened a few days later <#> And then uh a few days after the fall My Lord she returned to the Royal Victoria Hospital and she arranged to be admitted on the day after the christening <#> And uh she went into hospital then My Lord on the twenty-fifth of April <,> ten days after her fall <,> the twenty-fifth of April nineteen ninety-nine <,> and an operation was carried out to reduce the fracture and insert uh J-wires into the arm My Lord on the twenty-seventh of April the next day <#> I should have said to Your Lordship that between the date of the accident and the operation her arm was put in a plaster My Lord in order to attempt to uhm avoid further damage <#> And uh following the operation My Lord her arm was again put in plaster <#> It was in plaster for approximately three weeks<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> That 's that 's three weeks after the <.> acc </.> <,> after the operation <,> <{> <[> after the operation </[><ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> <[> Yes My Lord </[> </{> <#> After the operation My Lord that 's right <#> Then there was <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> for a period My Lord <#> She underwent various exercises or physiotherapy thereafter <#> She will tell Your Lordship that uh she had severe pain in the early stages My Lord <,> and this caused her great difficulty in handling her new baby and she required a lot of support from her mother <#> She <,> unfortunately My Lord <,> uh because she was taking a lot of painkillers <,> <unclear> 3 sylls <unclear> <,> she became addicted to the painkillers uh for a period of time <#> She had suffered from post-natal depression prior to the accident My Lord and<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Sorry prior to<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> Prior to the accident she had post-natal depression <#> And uh she had recurrences of depression afterwards My Lord <,> but we 're not making the case that the depression was due to the accident My Lord <#> She was<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Well are you making any case at all about it<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> No we 're not <#> I 'm I 'm merely mentioning it to Your Lordship<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> As background<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> It may become apparent uh <,> it 's referred to in the medical reports My Lord that the addiction that she had <,> uh <,> we 're not even making the case My Lord that any mental uh upset or difficulty is related to the accident<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Or <,> or that any addiction is related to the accident<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> <unclear> 2 sylls <unclear> My Lord <#> We are saying that as a consequence of the medication she was on <,> relating to depression and the uh painkillers following the fracture she became addicted but we 're not seeking to make uh a link between addiction and the accident<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> She uh gradually recovered a better range of movement in the elbow My Lord but she still has significant limitation of movement and it is important to her My Lord because she is a left-handed person <#> She <,> in the earlier stages My Lord had difficulty even doing simple things like writing <,> uh <,> and dressing and so on but now the only restrictions My Lord would be in terms of uh brushing hair <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> She uh has also My Lord a significant scar <,> and it is accepted uh in the medical reports My Lord that she will have a permanently sub-standard left elbow <#> I haven't handed it into Your Lordship but there is also I believe in addition to the medical reports <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S2A-064$B> <#> Yes well if you could give me a copy <,> <#> Yes thank-you <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$A> <#> At this stage My Lord she gets uh intermittently a shooting pain from her elbow to her hand uh perhaps two or three times a week lasting approximately half an hour and she also My Lord <,> if she lies on her arm at night she 'll feel it sore and stiff <#> There is no claim for special damages My Lord <,> <#> Our case very briefly My Lord is that this defect which I've indicated throughout in the photograph constituted a hazard to pedestrians and therefore <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#> There <,> there will be evidence from Mr McGee as to why he thinks that defect arose but <unclear> several sylls </unclear></I><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-064$C> <#> My Lord the plaintiff Thomas Gordon <,> was born on the nineteenth of March nineteen thirty-five <#> Now he 's sixty-six <,> he 's a retired factory worker <,> <#> He is also or has been over the years a part-time farmer <,> keeping some cattle himself <,> <#> This accident occurred on the twenty-second of August nineteen ninety-nine in a laneway at Crossnarea <,> C R O S S N A R E A <,> Moneymore <,> <#> He will give evidence that the uh defendant <,> that 's Mr McSorley 's <,> bullocks had uh broken out of their field and had gone into a field owned by the plaintiff 's nephew <,> <#> Now the plaintiff was out at his nephew 's field and observed Mr McSorley 's bullocks with uh his nephew 's animals and at that time then Mr McSorley arrived <,> uh to remove his animals <#> And he came down this uh like a laneway with a uh trailer on the back of his vehicle with the intention of herding the bullocks onto this trailer and then removing them back to his land <#> He asked Mr Gordon to give assistance <,> and if I provide you with a set of photographs <,> they perhaps <.> ex </.> <,> they show the situation <,,> <#> My Lord the trailer uh as shown in photograph one <,> uh it opens up so that the door acts as a ramp and then within the trailer there are a couple of uh side gates that come out so that they form side gates along the side of this ramp and the animals are then driven onto the trailer <#> And the area <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is shown in the succeeding photographs <#> Uh I refer Your Lordship to photograph two and photograph three <#> The uh the closed gate which one sees in photograph two is the direction in which the animals were being driven <#> And the vehicle had been reversed down so that the gates which one sees open to the right of the laneway <,> it was pushed up against the side of the side gate of the uh uh trailer so that effectively that was meant to block off the animals ' passageway <#> Then <,> the uh other side of the ramp was obstructed by a <,> a thick gate at the rear of the uh trailer so that effectively <,> uh the uh beasts could not come up <,> come up the lane and escape beyond the trailer<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$D> <#> And the ramp had been lowered at this stage<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$C> <#> The ramp had been lowered <#> Now there was a problem in that <,> uh if we <,> if we look at photograph three <,> uh the area between the closed gate <,> to the right of the closed gate and then to the left of the open gate <,> uh that is a hedge of sorts owned by the defendant <,> and there was a hole in that hedge so that uh the plaintiff was asked to stand and block that hole <,> to prevent the<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$D> <#> <.> I </.> is that to the right of the open gate <,> where you see the foliage is a bit thin no<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$C> <#> No it 's not <#> It 's actually within that but it looks like rather thin foliage in the photograph<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$D> <#> Well he was gapping in any event<ICE-IRE:S2A-064$C> <#> He was having to stand there <#> Now the <,> as I say there was <,> there were uh four bullocks <#> They uh <,> were uh suckling bullocks which uh the plaintiff will describe there being some significance in that <#> Uh bullocks can apparently be reared and be hand-fed and if they are they <,> would usually be rendered more docile <#> Suckled ones which in other words were fed by the cows have a tendency to be uh wilder beasts <#> And as uh Your Lordship may be aware but <,> uh for completeness ' sake the bullock is really a a a bull which has been castrated at the age of about eight months or so and this particular <,> these particular animals were about eighteen months old <#> They uh <,> had broken out let 's say from their own field and gone in with uh the nephew 's animals <#> They were then driven by Mr Gordon towards the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> trailer <,> but uh three of them uh escaped by jumping over a hedge so that Mr uh McSorley was left driving one bullock towards this trailer <#> And again the evidence would be that uh strange as it may seem that if there if there 's four animals there 's a tendency for them to remain more docile whereas if a beast is isolated it has a tendency to give more trouble <#> Uh so it was being driven uh into this area to the rear of the trailer and the arrangement was that uh Mr Gordon was to stand at this hedge and he had a bit of a stick with him and he was to block this gap <#> The defendant was to drive the beast onto the uh <,> onto the trailer and was then to immediately follow it on and shut the trailer ramp behind him <#> Uh and unfortunately what happened was <,> for whatever reason the defendant didn't follow on <,> didn't shut the ramp so that the beast was driven on and then turned round and came out back into the area where Mr Gordon was standing and it then was agitated <,> came towards him and he <,> much as he was striving to try and push it away but it turned round and kicked out at him and kicked him on the left side of his body and he suffered bruising of the body and then <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the hernia which is dealt with in the medical evidence that I 'll come to shortly <#> The uh allegation against the defendant is that the uh defendant was negligent in failing to follow the beast on towards the trailer <,> shut the door <,> shut the ramp rather <,> so as to prevent the animal getting out and that uh the consequences of not doing that were that the animal in escaping was by that stage in an agitated condition and was uh <,> a dangerous animal as such <#> The second allegation would be that it was far from ideal for the plaintiff to stand in the position in which he was asked to stand <#> He was in an enclosed area <,> in close proximity to uh an animal which uh had a tendency to behave aggressively particularly in the situation <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and he shouldn't really have been <#> The only reason he was there was he was blocking the gap in Mr McSorley 's hedge<&> discussion about statutory position </&><#> There has been uh medical evidence such as a report from the GP and a report from Dr Lesley <#> The plaintiff suffered uh bruising on the left side of his body and he became aware <,> within a very short time after this incident of a uh swelling <,> which was later diagnosed as uh a hernia and uh the evidence from Dr Lesley uh would in my submission satisfy the court that that hernia is <,> follows on as a consequence of the accident <#> Uh he the plaintiff has been in pain since since the incident and is presently waiting for an operation on the hernia <#> He was off work for six weeks following the accident and <unclear> several sylls
