<ICE-IRE:S1B-001 Sociolinguistics 1><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> So fieldwork then <#> Uhm we want to start with fieldwork <#> Will somebody hand me a copy of the fieldwork exercise so that I 've one in front of me and you can fire away at questions and I 'll say some general words <#> Now I 'm not going to tell people how exactly to do it but I 'm very willing to take general questions because I know it 's the sort of thing you haven't probably tried to do before <#> Uhm one of the points about this is that it doesn't say uh do this in exactly this precise way and that 's very deliberate because there are many different answers to how you might achieve the tasks that are set you <#> And the way to work out how to achieve them is uh <,> from a mix of things <#> First and foremost of course from what you 've read in the literature about how other people uh set about recording naturalistic speech <#> Uh and secondly of course from uh trial and error <#> And don't be surprised if you actually have a go at one of these exercises for the first time and you come home and it 's all wrong <,> or you 're at home and it 's all wrong and you can't hear the voice <,> uh it doesn't actually demonstrate what you 've set out to demonstrate <#> People often have two goes at it to get it right <#> Uhm <,> or sometimes even if you 've a trial go in the right kind of context with uh a fake situation then at least you can uh judge things like recording level and how well they 're working <#> So <,> you know <,> don't expect to get it right first time <#> And of course the final point is <,> don't expect to think that there is a right answer <#> There isn't a right answer <#> Okay <#> There is no right way of doing it <#> Uhm <,> and it 's up to you what way you choose to do it <#> Uh people often want there to be a finite definite right way <#> There isn't <#> Uh and there 's a lot of choice that you can use within that <#> The main thing is it 's naturalistic <#> It mustn't be faked <,> it mustn't be acted <,> it mustn't be off TV <,> it mustn't be off radio <#> Uhm and believe me if it 's any of those things I 'll detect it immediately <#> Very easy to detect anything that is acted <#> We 've had a couple of occasions in the past where it has been done like that <#> Uh so you want to get something that is as naturalistic as possible and then you want to carry out the few very simple linguistic tasks that you 're asked to execute <,> like naming a few phonological or other variables and saying something about them <#> So over to you <#> Any questions or <{> <[> any thoughts about that </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$B> <#> <[> Is it okay if you </[> </{> tape your friends<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> No problem with that Alistair <#> I mean if you think about that in the context of sociolinguistic literature <,> it would be a good method <,> or should be a good method to use because uh you know if you use uh a network that you 're part of you are more likely to be less intimidating to them and to get better speech <#> More naturalistic speech<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$B> <#> Or should we be aiming to get uhm Belfast speakers<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> That depends on which of the tasks you do because uhm one of the tasks is uh people from different social backgrounds <#> Okay <#> One of the tasks is style shifting <,> and one of the tasks is regional backgrounds <#> Uh so for instance if you choose uh if you want to get three speakers uh of different regional backgrounds <,> uh you might uh want to choose Belfast <,> Derry and somewhere else <#> Uhm so the the the place is relevant to the question <#> Uhm if you want <,> you know if you 're a non-native <,> did you get it Eleanor<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$C> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Oh good <#> Uh I 've got your essay here by the way <#> There you are <#> It was on a disc <#> Do you want to come and get it <#> Uhm if you 're non-native and you want to do that exercise <,> I know some of you will probably ask me <,> uh the the way that you define region can be different <#> Uh you know you might define region in a broader kind of way than say Belfast <,> Derry and Dublin or something <#> You might define region as uhm Irish English <,> English English <,> Scottish English <,> American English <,> uhm and you know you 're bound to meet people uh in wherever you 're living wherever you are that probably reflect different regions like that and that as a non-native listener you can probably at least start to think about some of the analysis of the differences rather than some that a native listener is more likely to pick up perceptually <#> Does that make sense<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$D> <X> <#> Do they have to be uhm native speakers </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Uhm <,> yes <#> It 's actually quite hard <,> I mean it 's quite hard to conceive of this exercise <,> the way it 's written <,> uh dealing with non-native speakers and I think I have put in the word native speaker of English in each case deliberately<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$D> <X> <#> Yeah yeah </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> We you do have to have that <#> So that for instance uh if you 're going away for Christmas or whatever you 're going to have to think about probably doing your fieldwork before you go aren't you <#> That 's one of the problems that SOCRATES students often face or <,> you know students from abroad <#> They need to think about this before <#> Well you all actually ought to be thinking about it before Christmas anyway quite frankly cos you don't want to end up in a situation in early January where you 've done neither the essay nor the fieldwork assignment and then have to do them both together <#> And my recommendation is to get the fieldwork one out of the way first and then think about the essay<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$E> <X> <#> Can your voice be on the tape </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Yeah if you 're <,> depends what role you 're playing <{> <[> uhm in a way </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$E> <X> <#> <[> It 's just cos </[> </{> you can't get someone to talk solidly for thirty minutes without talking back to them really </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Oh no <#> I mean well that that wouldn't be <,> you know if you think about that and a fieldworker a good fieldworker wouldn't do that <,> uhm because most people don't talk solidly for thirty minutes unless they 're doing something like a performance a lecture or something <#> Uhm and uh yes I mean by all means you talk to them but you 'll then be part of uh the the social setting in which you 're carrying out the experiment so you would expect your methodology to incorporate some discussion of why you 're there<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$F> <#> What about tape recorders and that<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Yes well practical things <#> Uhm I mean obviously it 's easier from my point of view if as many of you as possible use whatever you might have yourselves <#> Uhm but if people are stuck and really need help then I will undertake to try to supply you with tape recorders <#> Now of course you need to find out what kind of a recording you can get with a tape recorder of whatever size and whether you need a mike or whether you don't need a mike <#> Uhm uh that that kind of thing <#> So you need <,> that 's why I 'm saying you need to almost have a dry run at this sort of thing as an <.> experi </.> you know a a physical setting in which you try and set things up<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$G> <#> Is it okay to have your like two or three speakers speaking together <,> or or do they have to be all separate<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Well uhm <,> uh one of the <,> two of the exercises talk about three native speakers <#> Okay <#> Uhm so my understanding of that in a natural setting is probably <,> you could do it different ways <,> uhm uh I mean you could interpret it as meaning you take three separate people and uh you <,> you or somebody else talks to each of them separately uhm and you then compare them at the end <#> That 's one way to do it <#> Another way to do it is uh you could have them all together <#> Uh if you then put them all together of course you 'd have to have some <.> so </.> social justification for putting them all together and you 've got just three total strangers dumped together in a room <#> Sociolinguistically it 's unlikely to work <#> So that 's really up to you Elaine what you actually do with that <#> Uhm now talking together of course if you 've three people in a room talking and if it 's reasonably natural you 'll get a <.> lo </.> lot of overlap and so on but that 's natural that shows that you 've got good conversation <#> So <.> i </.> it 's entirely up to you how you handle that<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$F> <#> Is that three native speakers like excluding you <#> You can't be one of the native speakers<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Uhm <{> <[> it doesn't say it doesn't say you can't </[> be one of the native speakers<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$F> <#> <[> I mean say you <,> say </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$F> <#> I mean say you just set the tape recorder down and talked to two people<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> That would give you three <#> <{> <[> Yes </[> <#> But you would have to have a justification for how you fit in the set-up because you would have to uhm fit either a different regional background from the other two or a different social background from the other two <#> So as long as it answers what you 're asked to do then there is no law against you doing those sorts of things <#> And indeed there might be some kind of social justification for doing it<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$F> <#> <[> Yes </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$H> <#> Can you use any age group<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Aoife <#> Uhm<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$H> <#> I mean can you use like a teenager like<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Well <,> yes there is nothing to stop you using whatever age group you want <#> Uhm of course uhm in this kind of study uh you 're never going to prove anything conclusively about social backgrounds or regional backgrounds because you 're only dealing with three people maximum <#> So if you for example have a teenager uhm uh working-class background uhm and uhm you know a thirty year old uhm middle-class background and a sixty year old uh upper middle-class background <,> you 're going to be dealing with a number of different variables at the same time which sort of makes it harder for you to say anything sensible socially about those <,> the differences between those accents <#> <.> D </.> do you understand me <#> But I mean but you you 're never going to answer that easily anyway with three people<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$H?> <#> I 'm finding it very hard to get three different people from three different social backgrounds <#> Can you use like uhm a student somebody from a working-class background <#> Uhm can you use students at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> You can course you can use students<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$H?> <#> Put that in as being a different background <#> <{> <[> Because I can't </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> <[> Well but then </[> </{> it 's up to you to justify how you feel you have or how you have measured somebody 's social background<&> later in class </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Uhm they have more German uhm and uh they have more German uh also across more ranges of people that they 're speaking to uh so that they are now even speaking to close relatives like their dad in German <#> The younger women are speaking to their fathers in German uh so German is <.> co </.> steadily taking over <#> Note of course that they all <,> now this is quite interesting <,> that everybody no matter what age group speaks to God in in Hungarian <#> Now how they worked <,> I don't know the actual uh how they got them <,> I think they just asked them what form they used to to God or to people and they all said they they spoke Hungarian to God which is <,> how do <,> I mean why do you think that would be the case actually <#> I think it would seem to be outside <,> sorry Eleanor<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$C> <#> The older ones probably teach the younger ones their prayers and then <{> <[> teach them </[> <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> <[> It just gets </[> </{> passed on perhaps<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$?> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> I was wondering if it was some kind of you know relationship thing or intimacy or <,> I don't know<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$C> <#> Maybe it 's because it 's a personal thing and you just uhm the most natural and easiest language <,> you would<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> With something terribly personal<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$C> <#> Yeah <#> <{> <[> It 's terribly personal </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> <[> Right <#> Well that 's just yeah yeah </[> </{> <#> Or it could be a mix of the two <#> I mean it may just be a sort of habit as as Eleanor 's kind of saying and something like that would stick <#> But I mean the main point is there <,> that in bilingual communities the pressure uh of peer groups among younger people here uh starts at an early age with young women and has actually succeeded by the looks of it in actual shifting uh the whole uhm stability of the bilingual position uh state state in this community <#> Uhm so uh does any of this make any sense to you Wilhelm<ICE-IRE:S1B-001$I> <X> <#> No I was just wondering because I think that it 's clear that fourteen year old women don't have husbands but seventy year old women are talking to their grandparents <#> Which language do they use </X><&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> Hang on <#> Wait a minute <#> Women of seventy are talking to their grandparents <#> You see that is a bit odd isn't it<&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-001$A> <#> No but no but hang on <#> But this is not empirical work <#> That 's why I said that the women that they were asked what language they would use rather than observing grandparents talking to grandparents which as you quite correctly point out would be a bit peculiar <#> So it 's just that they 're asking them <#> And of course that 's relying on their memory then again <,> what language did I talk to my grandparents in</I>
