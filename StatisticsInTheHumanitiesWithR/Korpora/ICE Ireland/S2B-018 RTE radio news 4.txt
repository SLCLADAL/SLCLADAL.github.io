sympathetic to him perhaps even a supporter of Mr O'Laoire <#> And he was somewhat reluctant earlier this year to set up this inquiry when it was requested by Beaumont Hospital <#> But he did accede to the request and the inquiry began in July <#> But he is now faced with the position where the inquiry which he himself established has now unanimously recommended that Mr O'Laoire 's employment be

that we 're aware of <.> o </.> on the complaints<ICE-IRE:S2B-018$H> <#> Well the complaints I think would be probably be divided into two main categories <#> There were a number of complaints in relation to the manner in which he dealt with his fellow nursing and medical colleagues and the <,> hospital had alleged that he had on several occasions sought to blame them for errors or for the outcome in particular cases <#> And running parallel with that the committee went into some detail in examining a number of individual patient case histories where there were allegations and counter-allegations in relation to the way in which those cases were handled</I>
