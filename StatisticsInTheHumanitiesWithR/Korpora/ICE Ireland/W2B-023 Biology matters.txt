<W2B-023 Biology matters><I><W2B-023$A><h> <#> CHOLESTEROL </h><p> <bold> <#> We hear a lot of talk these days about cholesterol but do we really know what it is and what it does to us? <#> If we asked the average person "what is cholesterol?" we may get the following responses. <#> It 's something in fatty foods...it 's something to do with heart diseases...it 's bad for you, isn't it? ...and so on. <#> So now let us look at what it is and the role it plays in our bodies. </p><p> <#> Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat-like substance and at room temperature appears white and waxy. <#> Cholesterol is not quite the rogue it is made out to be, it also plays an important role in the function of the body. </bold> </p><p> <#> Much of cholesterol is a vital constituent of cell membranes, the nervous system, vitamin D, some hormones and bile salts. <#> However, it also occurs in the more simple form of circulating fat particles in the blood-stream. <#> It is when these fatty particles become excessive, cholesterol can start to build up on the artery walls. </p><p> <#> Cholesterol is manufactured by the liver and carried around the body within particles called lipo-proteins. <#> There are two types of lipo-proteins, LDL (low-density lipo-proteins) and HDL (high density lipo-proteins). <#> LDL transports cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues, including the artery walls. <#> At this stage it can contribute to the furring up process in the arteries which can eventually lead to coronary heart disease. <#> The other type HDL, transports cholesterol from the <}> <-> tisues </-> <+> tissues </+> </}> back to the liver and helps prevent the furring up process. <#> Therefore a raised HDL level is good as it can give some protection against heart disease. </p><p> <#> Approximately one gram of cholesterol is made in the liver and small intestines each day. <#> Even if we take no dietary cholesterol, animal fats and small amounts of <}> <[> vegetables </[> <+> vegetable </+> </}> fats our bodies continue to produce cholesterol. <#> However, if we consume a diet high in cholesterol and saturated fats, i.e. eggs, dairy produce, meat, processed vegetable fat and take very little exercise, we run the risk of higher levels of cholesterol in the blood. </p><p> <#> Cholesterol is measured by taking a blood sample. <#> The amount is measured in millimoles per litre. <#> In the United Kingdom the average reading of cholesterol is between 5-7.5mmol/L. <#> This is higher than it should be with the ideal being 5mmol/L or lower. <#> Anyone with a raised cholesterol level should try and reduce this. </p><p> <#> One of the first things that is necessary is a change of diet. <#> We should avoid the following: <it> <#> Fatty meats (lamb, pork). <#> Skins of animals (sausages, salamis and pates). <#> Cream, full fat milk, butter, full fat cheese, pastries, fried foods, etc. </it> </p><p> <#> We need to switch to low fat alternatives and try to use oils such as olive oil, peanut, groundnut oil and rape seed oil. <#> These oils are rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids which helps raise HDL levels. <#> Sunflower oil can also be used as a substitute for saturated fat in cooking. <#> It is important when using polyunsaturate spreads instead of butter that it is not spread half an inch thick on our bread. </p><p> <#> We should increase the amount of fibre in our diet, especially soluble fibre which helps deal with cholesterol. <#> Soluble fibre is found in fresh fruit, vegetables, legume vegetables, i.e., peas and beans and dried legumes such as lentils, chick peas, soya beans, red kidney beans, etc. <#> Oatbran is another rich source of soluble fibre. <#> Also we should eat more fish such as mackerel, herring and salmon. </p><p> <#> Regular exercise is important as it can help lower LDL cholesterol levels and raise HDL cholesterol levels. </p><p> <#> Also supplements such as garlic capsules, fish oil supplements and vitamin B3 are helpful in lowering cholesterol. </p><p> <#> Therefore, by adopting better eating habits, exercising more we will feel better and also help reduce a major risk factor of heart disease. </p></I><I><W2B-023$B><h> <#> Producing quality young vegetable plants </h><p> <#> VEGETABLE PLANTS grown in glasshouses or polytunnels have increased in popularity since their introduction here in the early 1980s. </p><p> <#> The transplants raised in module trays offer an alternative to bare-root and block-raised plants for field vegetable production. </p><p> <#> The division of the trays into cells means each plant is a separate unit requiring its own water and feed supply with no buffering reservoir available from its neighbour. </p><p> <bold> <#> BENEFITS: </bold> The main purpose of raising vegetable plants in modules is to produce crops which are uniform and to achieve continuity of market outlets. </p><p> <#> In addition, the speed and ease of planting is enhanced by using a module transplanter. </p><p> <#> Module plants will also have a small reservoir of water and nutrients on which they survive during the first few days in the field before new roots establish in the soil. </p><p> <#> The cost of seed has risen. <#> For example, hybrid cauliflower seed has doubled in price over the last five years. </p><p> <#> The use of modules makes better use of high cost seed as better germination is achieved under protection than if sowing the same seed in an outdoor seedbed. </p><p> <#> The module trays are usually made of rigid polythene or plastic. <#> After being filled with a module compost they can be seeded using a plate or vacuum seeder. </p><p> <#> <bold> VEGETABLE CROPS: </bold> Modules are used for a range of crops, but especially for brassicas (cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and calabrese) and for early leeks. </p><p> <#> The size of the module cell varies depending on the plant to be grown and time of sowing. <#> Autumn-sown crops are sown in larger modules as they will not be planted out until the spring, whereas a spring-sown plant will only take about six weeks to produce a plant ready for transplanting. </p><p> <#> The larger module will help to extend the season by producing an earlier crop than those sown in a smaller module - for example, a 308 tray. <#> The most common tray used for main crop production contains either 260 or 308 cells. </p><p> <#> <bold> MANAGEMENT: </bold> In the glasshouse of polytunnel, the module trays are raised off the ground to allow air movement under them. <#> This air helps to prune the young roots, keeping them within the cell. </p><p> <#> The growth of the plant can then be controlled by the liquid feeding. <#> In a late season when ground conditions are too wet for planting, the young plants can be 'held' by regulating the feeding. <#> Then, prior to planting, they are fed with a higher nitrogen feed to stimulate growth again. </p><p> <#> <bold> PLANTING: </bold> The date of planting has a larger effect on the crop maturity date than the date of seed sowing. <#> This is important when a grower requires continuity of production from crops such as cauliflower and calabrese. <#> Modules are ideal for ease of planting of small areas at regular intervals. </p><p> <#> <bold> PROPAGATORS: </bold> There are specialist plant propagators who produce plants to order as required by their customers. <#> However, it is also possible to grow modules on-farm provided the management of the young plants in modules is very good. </p><p> <#> <bold> DEVELOPMENTS: </bold> The design of trays is changing to allow more plants per unit area of glasshouse and also to be more durable. </p><p> <#> In the field, starter solutions applied at planting are now being used to enhance the development of new roots immediately after planting. </p></I><I><W2B-023$C><h> <#> Coliform mastitis a major killer </h><p> <#> THE BOVINE mortality survey carried out by the Veterinary Science Division identified coliform mastitis, or acute environmental mastitis, as one of the major killers of adult dairy and suckler cows in Northern Ireland. </p><p> <#> Unlike ordinary mastitis, the udder infection in the coliform version has been shown to be the result of exposure to bacteria that survive and, in the right conditions, multiply within the cow 's environment. </p><p> <#> It is most common during the winter months when cattle are housed, particularly from December to March, and often in milking herds which practice teat dipping and dry cow therapy. </p><p> <#> The affect herds are usually well-managed, the husbandry is good and the cows are mainly housed in cubicles and fed silage. </p><h> <bold> <#> SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: </bold> </h><p> <#> Typically, the condition occurs in freshly-calved cows in their fourth or fifth lactation. <#> It is uncommon in calved heifers. </p><p> <#> The bacteria involved are mostly the same as those excreted in cow faeces and <it> E. coli </it> are the most commonly isolated species - hence the general term coliform mastitis. <#> Because these bacteria produce toxins, the affected animal is often suddenly very ill, after being quite normal at the last milking or feeding time. </p><p> <#> The cow will be very depressed, sometimes down and unable to rise with a low body temperature - this can be confused with milk fever. <#> There will be swelling <}> <-> or </-> <+> of </+> </}> one <}> <-> of </-> <+> or </+> </}> more of the mammary quarters with a watery mastitis. </p><p> <#> The overall survival rate is usually only 50 per cent and urgent attention will be required from a veterinary surgeon who will use aggressive therapy, often including intravenous fluids, to save the life of the cow. </p><p> <#> Quarter sampling, for culture and drug sensitivity at a laboratory, will indicate the best form of antibiotic treatment for use in future cases. </p><p> <#> Recent evidence also suggests that stripping out of the infected quarter, every two or three hours, to remove the <it> E. coli </it> and its toxin, is a helpful procedure. <#> Ironically, the infected quarter, although lost to the present lactation, will return to almost full production in the next lactation, provided the cow survives. </p><h> <bold> <#> CONTROL MEASURES </bold> </h><p> <it> <#> Calving boxes: </it> Obviously, it is important to reduce the level of faecal contamination in the cow 's immediate environment. </p><p> <#> Because freshly-calved cows have a depressed immune system, they are known to be more susceptible to coliform mastitis. </p><p> <#> Consequently, it is essential to clean out calving boxes at regular intervals, certainly at least two-three times during the winter months and particularly after a coliform mastitis has occurred, as this indicates that the environment is heavily contaminated with <it> E. coli </it> </p><p> <#> <it> Cubicles: </it> It is equally important to keep the <}> <-> the </-> <+> ? </+> </}> of the cow 's environment as clean as possible. </p><p> <#> Scrape out the backs of cubicles and passageways at least twice a day and bed down the cubicles at lease three times a week with sufficient material to make the cows use them. </p><p> <#> Unfortunately, the bacteria can multiply in dirty, damp bedding, particularly if it is the type of material that could act as a compost, for example, materials such as sawdust, mushroom compost, chopped paper and peat. <#> These will require more attention than biologically inactive materials such as crushed limestone, sand and rubber mats. </p><p> <#> However, all of these are useless if they are contaminated and are continually damp because the ventilation within the cubicle house is inadequate. <#> Dry bedding in a well-ventilated house with slotted roofs and Yorkshire cladding will inhibit the multiplication of <it> E. coli. </it> </p><p> <it> <#> Before and after milking: </it> In the parlour, make sure that the cow 's teats are cleaned and dried before milking. </p><p> <#> Drying is particularly important, as <}> <-> washinh </-> <+> washing </+> </}> without it just produces a heavily contaminated drip at the end of each teat. </p><p> <#> Also, make sure that the milking machine is cleaned adequately after each milking with a temperature that exceeds 85Deg C to ensure the destruction of coliform bacteria. </p><p> <#> High Total Bacterial Counts (TBCs) are a sure sign that one, or all, of these tasks are not being done properly. </p><p> <#> Finally, infection can also take place immediately after milking, particularly when the teat canal is still open and the cow leaves the parlour to lie in a dirty cubicle. </p><p> <#> Closure of this canal takes 20-30 minutes and if the cow can be kept on her feet for this period, say at the silo face because she is hungry, then disease incidence will fall. </p><p> <#> Reducing the concentrate levels in the parlour and closing the cows out of the silo for one-two hours before milking will have the desired effect. </p><h> <bold> <#> CONCLUSIONS: </bold> </h><p> <#> 1. Coliform mastitis is caused by faecal organisms. </p><p> <#> 2. The condition is life-threatening, so seek immediate veterinary help. </p><p> <#> 3. Control measures should be aimed at reducing the environmental levels of <it> E. coli. </it> </p><p> <#> 4. Keep cows on their feet after milking. </p></I>
