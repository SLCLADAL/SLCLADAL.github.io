<ICE-IRE:S1B-028 Coleraine><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> And to establish the debate <,> I 'd just like to ask a number of you what you feel you are what you think <.> y </.> you are or what you are convinced you are <#> And Willie Ross here member local member of <.> Parl </.> <#> Willie Ross if I asked you <,> in terms of nationality what are you<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$B> <#> I 'm British <,> and an Ulsterman<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Irish<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$B> <#> Very long way down the list<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> So if somebody uh over in London <,> in Westminster some of your friends said oh I want to introduce you to one of the Irish MPs what would you say<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$B> <#> I would say to him you 're <.> introd </.> <.> inused </.> introduced to one of the Ulster MPs<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Right now do you feel offended if somebody describes you as Irish<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$B> <#> No because I was born in the island of Ireland<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> So it 's possible then for you to be Irish and still as you are a British subject <#> No difficulty with that at all<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$B> <#> No in same way as a Scotsman or a Welshman can be both Scottish or Welsh and a British subject<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Gentleman beside you sir if you 're asked <,><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$C> <#> Then I 'm was terrified I might be <&> laughter </&> <#> Uh it 's not I 'd play safe <#> Uh I would call myself Northern Irish<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Why why do you call yourself Northern Irish<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$C> <#> I live in Northern Ireland<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Yes but I mean you live in the island of Ireland<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$C> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Is that a political statement <{1> <[1> do you think you 're making </[1> <#> So what is <{2> <[2> it </[2><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$C> <#> <[1> No it 's not </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$C> <#> <[2> No </[2> </{2> not at all <#> Uhm <,> well if I said I was British that 'd be a political statement <,> in the present context <#> If I said I was Irish <,> that might be regarded by some as a political statement <#> So uh I <,> reach for a cowardly compromise and say that I 'm <&> laughter </&> I 'm Northern Irish<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Anyone else now on the couch Sean Farren <#> Yes Sean how would you describe yourself<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$D> <#> I have no difficulty in describing myself as Irish <#> But I think that my identity is uh <,> more than that because I belong to Europe and uh I feel very much uh a member of the European community <#> And my European identity has been reinforced <,> uhm very considerably over the last twenty-five years <#> I think it 's very interesting that what we 're discussing today uhm this evening uhm was also on the agenda for the talks up at Stormont today <#> And as a member of the SDLP delegation <,> <{> <[> I was </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[> I didn't </[> </{> know that <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$D> <#> No well I was <,> I was involved in a very interesting exchange with members of uh Mr Ross ' party on this particular issue <#> Uh the question of identity its political dimensions and in particular <,> the problem of our political allegiance that flows from our identity <#> And I think that goes to the nub of the problem in terms of our general political situation<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Yes but <.> y </.> you do realise the difficulty some people have of accepting the proposition that they are Irish people <{> <[> within the Unionist community </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$D> <#> <[> Of course </[> </{> <,> of course I think uh what we did agree uh today on was that need to respect and to entrench respect for our different identities and to allow people <,> to express themselves and to hold their identities as they define them and not to pretend that people should be what we would like them to be<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Alright uhm I see Nelson McCausland over here <#> Nelson <,,> what are you<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$E> <#> I 'm an Ulsterman <#> Uh I 'm British <#> But the question of identity I think is much more complex than that because we have all many different identities <#> I have a religious identity as a Protestant <#> I have a cultural identity as an Ulster Scot <#> I have a national identity then as a British Ulsterman<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> But does your religious uh identity impact on your politics<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$E> <#> Well I would have to say that personally as a Christian <.> m </.> my faith does influence my politics<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> So is <.> tha </.> are we saying and this is an interesting point then <.> a </.> are we saying are we concluding then that and all the opinion polls recently say that Protestants most Protestants will describe themselves as British and most Catholics as Irish <#> John Barr you would have read all these opinion polls<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$F> <X> <#> Yeah of course I have <#> I mean if uh <.> w </.> the difference is that uh some people hold political and religious views through shared conviction <,> something they worked out for themselves <#> It 's a rational conclusion <#> Others do not <#> And the only hope for this country is we start to think for ourselves and come to politics and religion with conviction <{> <[> rather than </[> some other way </X><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[> <.> I </.> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Is it possible then to have what might be described as a shared identity sir<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$G> <#> Yeah I think uh for example the the Green Party put forward a a post-nationalist uh identity <#> It 's <,> essential that we begin to adopt a much more complex multiple and plural sense of identity and not ask only about the content but what we mean by identity and why certain elements of identity are politically salient<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Yeah now it 's okay <#> You 're all being very good and you 're all being very diplomatic but that 's not the way it is in some places <#> Now for example today <,> I spoke to a lady <,> on the radio <,> and it was about what happened last night or last evening at Connswater with the Prime Minister <#> And the Prime Minister was described as scum <#> He was described as a traitor <#> He was told to go back to England <#> And one listener said <,> to another lady who was on <,> well do you agree with that <#> And she more or less said yes <#> He said what would happen if you went to ten Downing Street <#> And I put the point if you went to ten Downing Street and a lot of English people said to you go home you Irish scum <,> what would you say <#> And she said I 'm British <#> So could you imagine someone then going to a crowd across the water and saying <,> no would you mind rephrasing that <#> It 's British scum go home <#> Gentleman here I recognise how do you feel about this question of identity <#> You 're from<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$H> <#> Dunloy originally<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <.> Dunl </.> that 's right <#> Yes I recognise you yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$H> <#> Can I say that uh I hear Sean Farren 's remarks about respect <,> for each other 's identity and each other 's culture and religion <#> In Dunloy we stand as a minority group and then as an Orangeman an Ulster Protestant and a Presbyterian Evangelical <,> <#> Our religion has been denied us <#> Our civil <{> <[> and religious liberty </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[> In what way </[> </{> has your religion been denied you<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$H> <#> Can I say very briefly first of all now on three occasions we have attempted to get to the Presbyterian church where we have gone for a hundred years and hold a service of divine worship once a year <#> That has been denied us <#> There 's those that come out onto the street and block the road <#> Those who attack us <#> My father 's been savagely beaten by people from Dunloy <#> And yet each time <,> each time it is the law-abiding citizens who have given lawful notice that is turned away <#> Surely the case must be that we must respect each others ' identity each others ' religion <#> We must have the right to worship in freedom of our own conscious <&> conscience </&> and dictates <{> <[> and </[> the Orangemen of Dunloy have been denied that<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[> But </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Well Delia Close uh is behind you and uh Harryville <,> have you been denied the rights that this gentleman 's talking about<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$I> <#> Uhm <,> in some way yes but uh we do still go to church <#> People are still there but uhm <,> we uh are not denied access to the church <#> We go in <#> We have our service <#> We come out <{> <[> again </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[> But you </[> </{> face a barrage of of of criticism and you face uh a barrage of catcalling <#> Isn't that right <{> <[> when you 're going </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$I> <#> <[> Not </[> </{> currently<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Not currently no <{> <[> but I 'm talking about </[> over that period<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$I> <#> <[> It 's not actually </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$I> <#> Yes a year or so ago <{1> <[1> that </[1> would 've been the case <#> <{2> <[2> Currently </[2> they 're still there but they 're a lot quieter<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[1> Right </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Right you were going to say something to me <#> Yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$J> <#> Yes uh David McConaghy from the Independent Orange Order <#> As an Independent Orangeman I come at the whole subject slightly different <,> than a member of the main Orange Order would <#> Uh I would concur with what Nelson McCausland has already said <#> As an Independent Orangeman <,> I am first and foremost an Evangelical Protestant <#> I 'm here tonight as an Evangelical Protestant as a minister of the gospel <#> My membership of our institution <,> and its activities is an expression of my faith <#> Now <.> f </.> what that means for me as an Independent Orangeman is if we take a church parade <,> from the moment that we assemble <,> during our parade down the road <,> going into the church the service the closing prayer <,> the journey home and the dispersal <,> that for me <,> is an expression of my Evangelical Protestant faith <#> Now <{> <[> I </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> <[> But </[> </{> is it not also a commemoration of battles past and has a military element to it<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$J> <#> As an Independent Orangeman <,> my membership and its activities is first and foremost an expression of our faith <#> Now I accept the fact that there are many people <,> would find that strange with disagree with that <#> I find many elements of Roman Catholicism strange and disagreeable <,> but I extend to them <,> the right to their worship the right to their faith<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Alright Pat McHugh in front of you<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$K> <#> Well I would describe myself as a a wobbly to start with <#> Uhm <,> but <.> i </.> it does seem to me that the crucial issue is why do we have to wait for programmes like <.> t </.> Let 's Talk to talk <#> Uh I mean I go to church in Harryville uh and I find that people who are throwing abuse at me uh who 've thrown stones at old people I don't believe are Evangelical Protestants <#> I I don't think they belong to to any church <#> But I think the whole core is that if we 've got to get on together in this community <,> at this time <,> irrespective what people believe about other people the only way through the process is talking <#> I 've just finished reading Mandela 's story The Long Walk to Freedom <#> It 's amazing what went on in South Africa in terms of talking with people you thought wouldn't 've talked <#> And they 've come up with a solution to their difficulties <#> So Jack McCann used to say talking and jaw is <.> bet </.> jaw jaw is better than war war <#> So irrespective who 's who and what 's what get into the talks<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$A> <#> Yeah what about the uhm is there somebody else over here <#> Yes is there somebody over there wish to uh you see the the religious dimension in this uh the difficulty is that I think we sketch around it from time to time <#> But I sense when I talk to some members of the Evangelical Protestant community uh some members of the Orange Order perhaps that the great fear the great fear within the island of Ireland is <,> it 's not so much a political fear it 's a religious fear <#> There 's their fear of Rome <#> There 's a fear of the imperial outreach of Rome that somehow and it has been stated by some councillors that the Roman Catholic church will prevent Protestants from actually going to their place of worship <#> The Protestants will simply dwindle away <#> Any thoughts on that sir <,> <#> It you yes<ICE-IRE:S1B-028$L> <#> Certainly uhm well I I I think the the most important thing is we 've we 've heard it <.> s </.> said already tonight this idea that people 've been denied their rights <#> <.> Th </.> <.> th </.> this was never true uh with regard to Protestants going to to service <#> They have never been stopped having service <#> What they 've been stopped doing is marching through another area in the process to that <#> And lot of that comes down to the respect people choose to have for beliefs held by other people <#> I don't care whether you believe in elephants flying through the sky as long as I 'm not frogmarched out to watch them <#> You can believe whatever you want <#> And if people have have their religious beliefs as a private affair and leave politics to politics we 'd be a lot better off</I>
