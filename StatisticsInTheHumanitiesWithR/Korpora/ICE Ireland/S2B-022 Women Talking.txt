<ICE-IRE:S2B-022 Women Talking><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$A> <#> I operate at a fairly senior level in my industry <#> Uhm I work very closely with the CBI in Northern Ireland and recently joined their council and uh found to my amazement <,> that I was the first woman <,> on the council of the CBI<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$B> <X> <#> What I want to do with my life is go to university and then hopefully after a few years in the <,> in the business world I want to open up my own business so I will be in charge </X><&> southern speaker </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$C> <#> My home is very important to me <,> and uh I uhm <,> can really I find my my day very busy <#> I 'm very involved in uhm in voluntary organisations and charity work <,> and of course my Woman 's Institute is very important in my life too<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$D> <#> I 'm basically I 've done an <.> aw </.> an awful lot of <,> uh uh working jobs <#> And I 've been in England I 've been in Austria <,> uhm grooming horses in Austria and in England working in a pub<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$E> <#> Well I came to work in Holy Trinity Centre about five years ago <,> and I 'm now I 'm the manager there <#> Uhm <,> sometimes it 's very hard to describe my job because I never really know at times when I go in in the morning what I 'm going to end up doing<&> meeting in progress in background </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$F> <#> The Women 's Support Network is also something which crosses <,> the <.> cu </.> <.> t </.> <.> t </.> the two <,> <.> t </.> major traditional communities here <#> Not only that we 're also trying to uhm reflect and to talk with and to articulate the needs of women who are outside of the two main traditional communities <,> because one of the the myths about here is that there are only two traditional communities <#> There are other communities here <#> We have a large and growing Asian community <#> We have a travelling community <#> We have a Gaelgoir’ community which is the community of people who speak and use the Irish language <#> We have lesbian women who are marginalised because of their sexuality <#> All of those women have been uhm forgotten about dismissed because they 're not seen as part of the mainstream <#> And it is time now for those women who are actually the majority <#> If all the marginalised groups came together they would be the majority <#> When I say that we cross the the two major traditions <,> I think it 's very important to also say that in doing that <,> we don't pretend <,> that we agree on everything <#> And I don't believe that we will ever agree on say uhm issues of of of national identity <,> for instance <#> And and what we do have in common as working-class women is a <,> is an experience of being marginalised and not being seen as important and our voices and our needs being completely dismissed by mainstream politics<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$B> <X> <#> I 'm at Strathearn School studying English Literature French and Maths for A-level <#> A girls ' school 's half-way to a nunnery <#> No I don't think I would agree <#> On the contrary I think sometimes a girls ' school can make girls a little bit more wild than if they had been at a mixed school <#> I play for the first eleven hockey in school and also for civil service first eleven outside of school <#> I think in hockey you have to be determined and aggressive and skillful <,> and those are the sort of qualities that you need when you 're going to have to fight your way in the business world </X><&> southern speaker </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$C> <#> Well the Women 's Institute is an organisation of ten thousand women in Northern Ireland <#> And our aims really are uh to provide a centre for education <,> for women <,> to help them uh better their their lifestyle and their homes <,> and also to create a common ground where all women uh of <.> cl </.> all classes and denominations can meet to discuss personal and environmental issues <#> Garvagh is the first Institute formed in Northern Ireland and that was formed in September nineteen and thirty-two <#> I am <,> the current president of the Institute <#> And I 'm very honoured to be president in this very important year being our diamond jubilee uh of the Women 's Institute <&> speaker in background </&> <#> Some of us think that we should change our image <,> but on the whole <,> we 've held our membership <#> We 're the largest uh non-sectarian non-political women 's organisation in Northern Ireland and uh that 's some fact that we 're very proud of <#> And I think we can hold our still our aims and our objects today as they were made out for us <,> sixty years ago<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$A> <#> The metal recycling industry is very male-dominated <#> Uhm to say I am <&> laughs </&> alone number of one basically uhm across the UK uhm would be very close to reality <#> Uhm I 've had to give orders to men <,> on all different levels <#> I mean you 're communicating with people who are delivering to your yard <#> You 've the travelling community <,> and the people who make their living from gathering scrap throughout the the province <,> uhm and <,> you can you have to communicate with them <#> And you also have to communicate with people like government ministers industrial development board accountants <,> financiers <#> So you get a very wide range of of people <,> men that you have to deal with <#> And I haven't had any particular problems in in dealing with them <#> I find that if you 're able to prove <,> that you know what you 're talking about <,> and that you are well-versed in your subject uhm they will give you the respect that you uhm deserve <#> And the technology side of it certainly holds no uhm barriers for me <&> conversation with site worker </&> <#> It 's been very very rewarding and very interesting <#> Uhm I mean I can be climbing through a uhm a shopping complex <,> looking at asbestos <,> uhm or I can be uhm in a shipyard looking at a a repair job or or a clean-up job that we 're doing on a boat <#> It it 's just very day-to-day is so different <,> and that 's I think what keeps my interest and what has me there now ten years<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$D> <#> I 've had three businesses of my own which one was uhm sticking on false nails <#> The other one was making leather belts and selling them all over Northern Ireland <,> and now uhm I 'm into the catering <,> spit-roasting <&> clip shown in background </&> <#> Right from the start <,> because it was such an unusual business I mean lifting hundred and twenty pound pigs and spit roast and gas bottles and trailers and and all the rest of it <,> and carving them up and cleaning them up it 's a pretty male business <#> But I mean I was going to take it on anyway <#> I mean I I thought I would like to keep it all female <#> Because I think because it is <,> such a heavy manual <,> business <,> you get a better impression when you can see women doing it <,> you know <.> l </.> trailing everything in and <#> You know cos you 've nine times out of ten would you not like a hand girls <#> No we 're alright <#> We can we 're fine thanks <&> clip of spit roasting </&> <#> I do find uhm especially in this business <,> because I am <,> very outgoing friendly <,> chatty <,> that men don't take me seriously <#> Like I bang in an an invoice and uhm <,> you know it 's sort of och no I mean you sure you didn't do this <#> They 'll they 'll try to get round you by <,> you know you dropping your price if they pay you for cash when you 've given them your price in the first place <#> They 're dealing with the wrong person cos if you stand <,> up and just say look I 'm sorry and bang a few solicitors ' letters their way then they know you 're talking business <#> Kate Mayne in business and Kate Mayne socially are really two different people to deal with <#> Well they have to be<&> southern speaker </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$D> <#> No I don't think I could get on without men <,> because I really enjoy men 's company <#> Uhm <,> I find I can <.> pa </.> I can parallel I mean I am actually <,> and I 've an awful lot of female friends but I 've probably the same amount of male friends <,> that I would get you know I would I like talking to men <#> I like hearing men 's point of view <#> Like okay I 've got a problem <#> What do you what what what goes on inside your head <,> that I do have men friends that I could say to <,> you know and talk over my problems that I can that I can weigh it up and see both sides <#> Uhm so I don't think I could live without men <#> Plus also I mean the sexual aspect 's quite pleasant <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$F> <#> My present status is that I choose to <,> to live alone <#> Uhm <,> that I choose to uhm <,> just retain my own independence <#> I don't feel that uhm <,> I don't know if that 'll change <#> I mean I 'm thirty almost thirty-three years of age and I still don't feel that I really want to have uh a permanent relationship in my life <,> that would mean that I would have to make <,> the kind of compromises on my freedom and on my space that uh I don't and I don't think I 'm prepared to make<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$D> <#> Well I met a guy in the Navy when I was fifteen and a half at a party my father had <#> And I think <,> if any of <,> any of them I I probably would have <,> would have been the most suitable partner for me <#> And uhm but I I knew at the age of eighteen that he was <.> mo </.> a lot more serious <,> than I I I knew I just knew there was something in me that had to live more <#> I mean there was no way I was going to be pigeonholed <,> settle down ring on finger <,> two three four children and that was my lot <#> I knew there was just so much more out there for me to do <#> And so <,> then <,> there was a uhm another couple of relationships which I didn't take as seriously <#> I knew they weren't going to go on forever and I I don't think they were as serious on me anyway <#> And then I met the guy uhm my boss which I could not <,> I mean I knew he was married and I just knew look and aha <#> I don't want this <#> I don't need this <#> I don't need these complications <#> But unfortunately it was just nothing neither of us could control <#> And then I that 's when I went to Oxford <#> When I was in Oxford I was only too delighted that I was manless for quite a while <&> laughs </&> <#> I think I 'd had enough by this stage <#> And uhm <,> then I then I lived with a guy for four years <,> uh of which was fine <,> and uhm until <#> I mean I I do tend to have the problem where people meet me as oh good great fun <,> and all the rest of it and then I 'll slowly as the relationship progresses it 's now you 're going to have to change Kate <&> meeting in background </&> <#> I think that 's quite typical of uhm <,> Northern Irish men that they want them to become like their mothers <#> Well there 's a present one at the minute <#> He well he lives in Majorca and I live here <#> It 's probably an ideal relationship for me cos I scoot over there three or four times a year and he comes over here <,> two times a year<&> southern speaker </&><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$A> <#> The the European attitude uhm very much is inclined towards women can do anything <#> The the the barriers are not there <#> And in Ireland we have a syndrome which I tend to refer to as the paddy factor in the greatest with the greatest of respect but it 's very much a Northern Irish syndrome<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$B> <X> <#> I think in Ulster men <,> they have the attitude that women should stay in the home a lot <#> And I think uhm whenever you think of the Ulster family you think of the father coming in and expecting his Ulster fry to be on the table you know the <.> w </.> that the wife has made for him </X><ICE-IRE:S2B-022$F> <#> Uhm <#> There 's no get-up-and-go in most of them <#> There 's no <,> life<ICE-IRE:S2B-022$A> <#> My husband has a non-typical Ulster male attitude <,> and the reason for that is because he went away from Northern Ireland and he stood back <,> and he took a look at what was happening in Europe <#> I would say my husband is a nineteen nineties man</I>
