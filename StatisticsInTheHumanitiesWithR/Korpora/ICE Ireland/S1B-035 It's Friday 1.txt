<ICE-IRE:S1B-035 It's Friday 1><I><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$A> <#> And like we must remember all <.> o </.> all over the country I can I know in my own parish at this time of the year we all share in the joyous season but like there are people obviously <,> <.> wh </.> for whom Christmas is a lonely time because <,> especially for older people <#> They obviously remember the people who are no longer with them <,> and they remember Christmases past <#> And obviously the older you get you have more Christmases probably behind you than in front of you <#> So I mean obviously people remember people that maybe they 've lost loved ones maybe in nineteen ninety-four or in recent years and obviously it 's very sad if people lose someone coming up to Christmas <#> And I think that 's why just talking to people and meeting people around the Christmas season and not just for the twenty-fifth of December but for the the days immediately after is very very important<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> Right <{> <[> uh </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$C> <#> <[> <.> Th </.> <.> Th </.> </[> </{> that 's an <.> ex </.> that 's a particularly important point that John brings out <,> <#> Uh it 's a very emotional time for people in generally but particularly for older people and missing <,> the people who 've gone before them <#> <{> <[> And </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> <[> The empty </[> </{> chair at the table for <{> <[> thousands of people this Christmas </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$C> <#> <[> Quite so <#> And and </[> </{> and also mind you you you also make an excellent further point John in in the lull after Christmas <,> uh which is <.> wh </.> which people find quite difficult <#> Although I think <,> that we in in the Society in in of Saint Vincent de Paul are I suppose particularly concerned about people <,> and Brendan mentioned this earlier <,> people out there who need help <,> who are not asking for it <,> people who 're falling through the cracks <,> <#> And we really depend on people in the neighbourhood could be community policemen it could be a <.> fr </.> uh a neighbour who would confidentially cos I mean our service like Brendan 's is uh is a totally confidential one <,> who would give us the nod as it were and say the the lady uh uh living up the road or down the lane or whatever is is uh very lonely <#> Hasn't been visited by anybody for six months <#> It might only be loneliness <#> It could be some need <#> Uh it could be a question of pride preventing her <,> uh her her him asking for help <#> And that 's what really concerns me<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> And indeed <{> <[> it 's </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$C> <#> <[> People who </[> </{> need the help who won't ask for it<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> It 's a salutary reminder indeed <#> Two elderly gentlemen died in house fires in County Cork here in the last week and it 's perhaps a time to call as well <#> We 're going to some more music now <#> Again from our friends the Polyphonics and this is <,> the Coventry Carol<&> music break </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> John <,> tell me about the farm because your work 's going to go on Christmas Day and every other day but there are traditions and there are memories and it 's obviously a time you enjoy<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> Yeah obviously it 's slightly different probably from the picture painted now in Alice Taylor 's recent book that everything kind of closed down for the twelve days of Christmas <#> The cows are in the stall and you stock up the hay and away she goes <#> Uh obviously you 've had lot of changes in farming practice now <#> Personally we 're not in winter milk <,> I still have a few cows milking but obviously you 've a lot of people who 've cows calved already at this time of the year <#> But uh like the the the season of Christmas generally speaking would have been a season of kind of slowing down and renewal to be the break in seasons <#> And even <,> uh you know I can always remember when I was small <,> uh you know kind of at Christmas time you always gave one of the cows was stalled or the pigs where in whatever house you kind of gave them an extra portion as well coming up to Christmas and at Christmas time you were extra generous with them <#> And personally I I I I have I I believe like that that animals can sense season <#> I now I suppose dogs especially like are very aware but even even farm animals you know <#> They can sense they can sense a lull in activities <#> They can sense a a slowing down in activities <#> Obviously they don't probably know whether it 's Christmas or what the cause for it <,> is <#> But animals themselves and obviously they 're central to the to the Christmas story and to the history of Christmas so I I I I a on our farm I would <.> as </.> uh always be conscious of the fact that we 're so close to nature <#> So obviously Christmas is about about birth <#> It 's about a very famous birth so obviously every time <,> do you know whether 'tis uh a calf is born or a lamb is born or whatever it it gives you that sense of of Christmas <#> Obviously if you are farming especially a huge vast scale you just get overpowered and it just goes by clinically and you don't notice it <#> I wouldn't be in that huge scale because I haven't an awful lot of stock <#> So obviously I can see you know a kind of a Christmas happening uh every time that you uh have renewal on the farm you know<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> I don't want to go too far away from it but do people still give names to animals <#> Do they call the cows <#> Do they have names on the cows<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> Yeah like we we would still have a <.> sh </.> uh names on a share of them like you 'd have Cronin 's Black and you 'd have Polly and there was a horse won the Grand National there a few years ago we had a cow calved that day I think it was Grit Arse I would have a cow of that name <#> But obviously now you see with milk recording and everything you have yellow sixty-nine and a hundred and forty-eight and you have blue a hundred and eighty-six <#> And that obviously as uh traditional as it was <{> <[> <.> wa </.> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> <[> That 's the </[> </{> tags and the year <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> <[> Yeah like </[> </{> we we we still have a cow now and and and her her great-great-great-grandmother was sold to a cattle dealer from Lisgoul called Jack Heaphy one time <#> And like we always called her descendants then Jack even though that wasn't a great name for a cow <#> <&> laughter </&> But we still have a I think there 's a great-great-granddaughter of her <#> But obviously you see we with big herds of cows now uh the name <,> <{> <[> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> <[> You could call </[> </{> her Jackie<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> Yeah that 's right yeah yeah <#> Yeah well well whether it 'twould be in deference to Jack Charleton or the late cattle dealer I 'm not sure <#> But obviously with scale now you see and identification of cows and you have so many schemes now with the cows <#> You see if I sent in a list to the Department of Agriculture for the beef scheme and I had Polly and Jackie and Molly and Two Paps and Croopledy Horn you see you could imagine the civil servants sure they 'd they 'd they 'd have a fit like <{> <[> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> <[> There 'd be </[> </{> another tribunal<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> There would yeah <#> There would yeah <{> <[> yeah yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$?> <#> <[> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> isn't wide </[> </{> enough to hold these long names <#> <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> Yeah there 's only room now you see for the <,> three eight six nought <{> <[> one two </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$E> <#> <[> It 's like </[> </{> everything else <{> <[> John </[> becoming more and more impersonal<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> Oh it is aye <#> 'Tis yeah <#> 'Tis yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$E> <#> Just a number<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$D> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> <[> What 're </[> </{> your memories of Christmas Brendan<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$E> <#> Oh I 've fantastic memories of Christmas Tom <#> I I know <,> I go back to my my childhood days and that wasn't yesterday uhm <,,> when we 'd be waiting Christmas bed <.> E </.> Christmas Eve night into bed early of course very early in case Santy 'd come and first thing then up in the morning <,> you were up and waiting for your mother to open the the sitting-room door <#> The sitting room door was locked cos in there the Christmas tree was with all the presents around it <,> <#> And uh <,> the key was in the door and everybody have to be up and ready <,> before the door was opened <#> And then we 'd all dash in and we 'd be all the excitement of opening our presents <,> <#> And up till in my time I I have own family myself two boys and two girls and I carried on that tradition <,> <#> And my daughters <,> I 've two daughters married today <,> and they are carrying on that tradition still that the sitting-room door is locked until Christmas morning and then in and presents are opened <#> And I think it 's a nice tradition <,> <#> And of course Stephens 's morning then we all waited for Stephens 's morning <,> for to go out with the Wren <,> <#> You know the Wren <#> I 'll always remember it <,> when I was young the uhm the old Sarsfield 's Estate where uh the Wilton Shopping Centre is now and so forth that was one of our playgrounds at the time <,> and then the African Missions bought Sarsfield House and we used go up there and there was a brother up there and if we sang the the uhm the Wren 's song in Irish <&Irish> Dreoili/n a fuaireas-sa </&Irish> we 'd get an extra couple of bob off him for singing it in Irish <#> And it was a great tradition with us always <#> Each uh Stephens 's morning we would wake up early in the morning and faces painted and off out straight away <,> <{> <[> getting </[> our couple of bob <#> And you 'd get a bit of fruit in some houses and so forth <#> But it is a fantastic time for<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> <[> Right </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$?> <#> That 's good <#> It 's a shame <,> <#> It 's a shame it 's gone <#> You you I watch for it today <#> Every Stephens 's Day I watch to see how many people will come round with the Wren <#> You might only get one in <,> if you 're lucky calling to the door <#> I think 'tis a shame to see all these old traditions gone<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$E> <#> 'Tis and I I<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> The most simple and gone in particular areas <#> I suppose media and entertainment and <{> <[> other options again </[><ICE-IRE:S1B-035$E> <#> <[> That 's the </[> </{> problem yeah<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> Cashel what 're your own memories<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$F> <#> Well I think uh one one 's one 's view of Christmas <&> clears throat </&> one has a changing perspective as you grow as you grow older <#> I mean I 'll be quite frank about it <#> When I was young <,> uh Christmas was a time of receiving rather than giving <#> It was the excitement of of getting gifts the <,> uh the excitement of Santa Claus and like like Brendan our door too <,> <.> w </.> would be locked uh uh uh and one would be waiting for it to open <#> But I think you you you kind of develop into a different uhm view of Christmas as you get older and your own children go through that stage and out the other side and perhaps <,> uhm uh emigrate for example in in my case <#> Three uhm uh three of my four children uh live abroad <,> <#> And to us now I mean what Christmas really means is is the the children coming home coming home safely and being being a family once again even if it 's only for a few days <,> <#> But also it 's a question I think of family <,> family ties being renewed <,> uhm I was going to say distant relatives coming home but relatives living at a distance perhaps coming home <#> And and uhm <,> maybe uh uh uh there 's a part of me which says and maybe in every family it 's the case that uh perhaps it 's just as well that Christmas is comparatively <{> <[> short </[> because oh <,> <.> ca </.> how long can we stand our adult children and the distant aunts and this uh is another matter <#> We can be sweet and and nice to them over over a short period of time <#> But no to be be serious uh about it uhm uh for us now it is it is the kids returning home <#> It is the family ties being being <.> reco </.> renewed and so on<ICE-IRE:S1B-035$B> <#> <[> Short </[> </{></I>
