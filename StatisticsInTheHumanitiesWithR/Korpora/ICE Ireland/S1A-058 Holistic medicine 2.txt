</[> </{> <,> I always thought she was just feeling sorry for him and kind of <,> not all the <{1> <[1> time I thought </[1> there was <{2> <[2> something there like </[2><ICE-IRE:S1A-058$D> <#> <[1> No I thought </[1> </{1><ICE-IRE:S1A-058$D> <#> <[2> I thought it was really </[2> </{2> really sad when he <,> looked at his kid and said is he<ICE-IRE:S1A-058$B> <#>
