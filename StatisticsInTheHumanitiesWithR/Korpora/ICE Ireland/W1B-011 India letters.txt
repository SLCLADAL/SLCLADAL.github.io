<#> It was 9pm when we arrived, totally dark and not a guest house in sight. <#> We had made up our minds to spend the night in a temple or hay shed when a young Indian man rescued us. <#> He took us to a guest house which was closed and got us a room telling us he would return the following day to take us to the people we planned to stay with. <#> However he returned 1/2 hr later and insisted we came home to his family. <#> This was about 10pm on xmas eve just to keep you up to date. <#> So we went back with him to meet his parents and family. <#> They were so nice, kept telling us how <}> <-> privalleged </-> <+> privileged </+> </}> they were to have us in their home and they really treated us like royalty. <#> I thought I 'd only get to see places like this on T.V. <#> Angela, it is amazing. <#> Nobody ever comes here either so the people think <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> a really big thing to have foreigners in their village. <#> Everyone lives in either stone or mud houses with thatched roofs. <#> All kinds of fruit and veg. grow here, the jungle is full of wild banana <*> plus sign </*> mango trees and I 'm told wild elephants, deer and tigers live there too. <#> Anyway, we woke up on xmas morning to the whole family bearing bunches of fresh flowers and cups of tea shouting happy xmas. <#> Even though they don't celebrate it themselves they wanted to make it special for us. <#> Then the father, he 's a brahmin (highest caste hindu) blessed us and told us we were his son and daughter, his family was ours because we made them all so happy by coming to stay. <#> Then we took family photos with our new "family"! <#> It was really touching, they don't even realise how much they helped us and I thought they were going to cry with joy when we gave them a fruit cake we had bought for xmas! <#> We went with our "new brother" Chandra for a walk and guess where he took us - to visit the King of Athmallik! <#> I had tea with real royalty on xmas morning. <#> The Palace is lovely with old photos of all the ancestors on the walls. <#> It looked like it was decorated in 1920 and never redone - lovely. <#> Oh, the ex-minister for tourism of Orissa was also present! <#> I think I 'll only have tea with kings and politicians from now on, peasant folk are too common!! </p><p> <#> After this little interlude we went to visit a Shiva temple in the jungle and surrounded with hot springs. <#> Finally we had to head for Kamal Pur to find the people whose address we had. <#> As we were leaving the family told us to come back anytime it was our home and we would always be welcome. <#> Chandra got a jeep to take us right up to the jungle through a small tribal village to meet Sammy <*> plus sign </*> Chauncey, the people the woman we met said would welcome us if we came. <#> Chauncey won't be here until new year 's eve but as soon as we arrived Sammy got out the rice wine, put more food in the pot and said we could treat the place like our own home as long as we liked. <#> Really, the people here are so welcoming. <#> Sammy is Catholic so he was celebrating xmas and was delighted to have some people to share it with. <#> Xmas dinner was delicious, pilau rice, vegetables, chicken curry and sweet rice pudding all served on big banana leaves and eaten with your right hand <#> And another xmas cake we had brought for Sammy <*> plus sign </*> Chauncey for xmas. <#> It is tropical fruit <*> plus sign </*> cashew nut cake <*> plus sign </*> absolutely delicious. <#> - this is real India Angela. <#> Miles from anywhere, no electricity in these hills (down in the village 6km away there is) totally surrounded by small mountains and thick jungle. <#> In a couple of days one of the old men is going to take us into the jungle interior - sounds like Indiana Jones style! <#> I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to come here, really it is like the middle ages. <#> Cooking on an open fire, getting water from the well. <#> It is an excellent experience for me and a good chance to think about what is really important in life. <#> These people have nothing except what they grow or make with their own hands yet they are so content with life and what they have. <#> There is a bonfire and jungle traditional music planned for new years eve and by that time there will be more people here. <#> We plan to stay for 2 or 3 weeks at least before moving on, maybe to the beach for a while. <#> I 'd love if you would come with me to India some day. <#> I 'm sure you would love it as much as I do, it is a different world. </p><p> <#> Email me with all your news, did Paul go to Australia, is Timmy still with Caitriona, how are Noirin <*> plus sign </*> Christopher getting on, did you see Bernie <*> plus sign </*> Glen at xmas, how is your course going, did you go up to my house at xmas, do you hear from Sarah at all, tell everyone I was asking for them. </p><p> <#> Keep yourself well and safe, enjoy the finer things in life and don't stress over your course too much. </p><p> <#> If I 've learned anything it is to take things as they come and they will generally come alright. </p><p> <#> Take Care <*> plus sign </*> lots of love <#> your best friend Aisling XXX. </p><p> <#> P.S. There is a little chicken trying to make friends with my ankles at the moment, I 've never been this close to one that I 'm not going to EAT before!! </p><&> picture of a chicken </&> <#> DINNER?<p> <#> P.P.S Next day - <#> The new years eve bonfire had to be lit last night to scare off the elephants who were making loud trumpeting noises <*> plus sign </*> threatening to come too close to the house, all the villagers were out blowing bugles <*> plus sign </*> banging doors keep them far away - what an amazing place!! </p></I><I><W1B-011$A><h> <#> Jaisalmek, Jul 16th </h><p> <#> Dear Angela, <#> You sound as if you are having a fairly lively summer from your emails. <#> What about your birthday!! <#> You must have been really pissed off to find out about Noirin and Timmy 's antics. <#> But when people drink 2 bottles of whiskey and a load of aftershocks they can't really be held responsible for their actions, even when they are this bad. <#> Stanley and Mairead have split up! <#> When? <#> Last time we saw them they had plans laid out for the rest of the year. <#> Poor them. <#> If you can, ask Stanley to email me and Mathieu because we 've only got a joint email address for them. <#> Deirdre told me that Sarah is moving to America on Sept 7th. <#> Things must be working between her a Kevin. <#> Me and Mathieu are getting on brilliant at the moment. <#> Since after xmas we started getting on so well and since we came here it 's been even better. <#> The shit thing is we are probably going to have to split up after Bakker season finishes. <#> I need to do something with my life, I still don't know what but I don't think I 'll be able to do it and stay with Mathieu. <#> We do talk about whats going to happen later but can either of us really plan it? <#> I don't think so. <#> It really is depressing me when I think about it. <#> I 'm also really worried about what I 'm actually going to do, because Angela, I simply don't have a clue. <#> You are so lucky to have a postgrad. to do. <#> Do you know yet about funding? <#> The thing about being here is you have so much time to sit and think. <#> And the more thinking I do the more confused I get. <#> Don't get me wrong. <#> I 'm having the most amazing time, <}> <-> its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> just these worries keep popping into my head from time to time. <#> I wish you were here for me to talk to, I miss our wee 10 hour chats about life, love, etc, .... <#> Keep up with the informative emails. <#> Don't mention my worries in them because Mathieu reads them usually too and I don't want him to think I 'm writing dismal tales of woe about our future to all my friends. </p><p> <#> We 've been here in Jaisalmec for a week now. <#> A change from the mountains I wanted and you couldn't get more of a change than this. <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> it 's </+> </}> an ancient city built within and around the walls of a huge fort right in the middle of the desert in Rajasthan near the Pakistani border. <#> All the buildings, including the fort itself are of sandstone. <#> Everything glows gold when the sun is setting. <#> Being here is like going back in time. <#> The city within the fort hasn't changed in the last 1,000 years (except that now theres a water supply and a few palaces have been turned into hotels?) .. and of course electricity. <#> Life for the people here is probably pretty much the same I imagine. <#> Today being Sunday, lots of desert people, tribals who live in the villages in the desert around Jaisalmek came into the city to go to the markets. <#> The men wear really colourful turbans and long white shirts and dhotis (long pieces of cloth wrapped around <}> <-> ther </-> <+> their </+> </}> waists and between their legs) Most of them had really long moustaches. <#> They also wear loads of gold earrings and rings. <#> The women wear day-glo bright saris or long full skirts and shawls. <#> They also wear huge amounts of jewellery - mostly silver. <#> Watching them coming and going on their camels was like watching a film on T.V. </p><p> <#> There is a government bhang shop here - bhang = skunk (almost). <#> They make bhang lassis, they 're like yoghurt drinks full of bhang - very tasty and lekker stoned! <#> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> It 's </+> </}> a good place to sit for the afternoon watching the market and camels and traditional musicians who always seem to be wandering around. <#> The food here is gorgeous. <#> I was worried before I came to India that I 'd get sick of spicy food all the time but I 'm loving it more and more. <#> Sometimes ordering your food in restaurants can be a bit of an ordeal. <#> The spelling mistakes on the menu are hilarious - screamable eggs? fried children? corn flex and honi? chess omelate?!!! <#> We are sitting here trying to decide where to go and eat! <#> The weather here has been quite hot for the first few days we arrived. <#> Then yesterday and the day before it rained so today has been really fresh and nice - still hot though! </p></I>
