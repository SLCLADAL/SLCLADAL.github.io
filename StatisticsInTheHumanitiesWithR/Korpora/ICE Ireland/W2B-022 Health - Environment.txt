<W2B-022 Health - Environment><I><W2B-022$A><h> <#> The Fat We Eat </h><h> <#> by Cherril Bremmer </h><p> <bold> <#> It has been estimated that in the UK our present fat intake represents about 42 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total energy intake, and is around 140g daily for an average adult. </p><p> <#> Fat is necessary in the diet for the following reasons: <#> 1. Fat represents the most concentrated form of energy available supplying about 9.3 kcals per gram. <#> Carbohydrate and protein provide about 4.1 kcals per gram. <#> 2. It imparts palatability to food and lubricates it so making eating and swallowing much easier. <#> 3. Dietary fat is necessary for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. <#> These normally occur associated with fat. <#> If the diet was fat-free, absorption of these vitamins would be poor, even if they were taken as supplements. <#> They will not be absorbed across the intestine wall unless they can travel with fat. <#> If it is absolutely necessary to take supplements of fat-soluble vitamins (namely A, D, E and K), these are best taken with a meal, rather than on an empty stomach, so that fat will be available for their absorption. <#> 4. All fats contain Fatty Acids, three of which are essential in the diet. <#> This is because they cannot be synthesised in the body, so must be provided. <#> To ensure an adequate intake of these essential fatty acids it is necessary to eat a variety of foods containing fat. </bold> </p><p> <#> The amount of essential fatty acids required represents only around 5 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total energy intake, and apart from a supply of fat-soluble vitamins, this is in theory, all we need. <#> However, nature does not supply all the essential fatty acids or fat-soluble vitamins, in the required amounts, in any one food, so we need a variety of fats. </p><p> <#> In Western society we generally consume excess fat for the principal reason that it makes our food more palatable, but the difficulty now facing us, is how to find an acceptable compromise between what is good for our health and what we have come to enjoy. </p><p> <#> We must strike a balance between using enough fat to provide for our needs while suiting our tastes but without harming our bodies by over-indulgence. </p><p> <#> Whilst the total fat in our food is important, of equal importance is the nature of that fat, which brings us to consider saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. <#> The difference between these three types of fats is based on the chemical structure of the fatty acids they contain. <#> All fats are composed of fatty acids in association with glycerol, but differences between them occur in the fatty acid fraction. </p><p> <#> A fatty acid is composed mainly of Carbon, and Hydrogen, with a small amount of Oxygen. <#> The carbon atoms form a chain linked together by chemical bonds. </p><p> <#> In SATURATED fatty acids, each carbon is linked to the next by ONE bond and this renders the entire structure chemically stable. </p><p> <#> In MONOUNSATURATED fatty acids, two of the carbon atoms in the chain are linked together by TWO bonds - called in chemistry a DOUBLE BOND. <#> Since there is ONE double bond, the fatty acid is said to be MONO-unsaturated. <#> This double bond renders the entire structure less stable than the saturated form, and more vulnerable to attack by other chemicals. </p><p> <#> POLYUNSATURATED fatty acids have TWO or more double bonds in the carbon chain, so are even less stable and that much more vulnerable to attack. </p><p> <#> In terms of the food we eat, these facts are significant for three reasons: <#> 1. The vulnerability of the carbon chain of mono and poly unsaturated fatty acids makes them more susceptible to attack by digestive enzymes. <#> That means they are more easily broken down in the body. <#> 2. The double bond makes the unsaturated molecule more flexible so it is more easily carried in the human transport system. <#> 3. Vulnerability inside the body, also applies externally so unsaturated fatty acids are more easily oxidised by atmospheric oxygen, a process which produces unwanted fat peroxides. <#> For this reason an antioxidant must be added to fats containing unsaturated fatty acids to lengthen their shelf life. </p><p> <#> It has been observed that a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids results in a lowering of blood cholesterol - the principal enemy of the heart and arteries. </p><p> <#> Cholesterol is produced internally by the liver and is also present in many foods we eat. <#> While it is advisable to reduce cholesterol intake, such a reduction does not necessarily result in a lowering of blood cholesterol. <#> Studies have shown that the diet of Mediterranean people who use Olive oil, appears to be less harmful in terms of Coronary Heart Disease than the Northern European diet containing more saturated fats. <#> Olive oil contains the monounsaturated fatty acid, Oleic Acid, which is thought to have certain advantages over polyunsaturated fatty acids. </p><p> <#> The Government recommends that we reduce our total fat intake to between 30 <*> per cent sign </*> and 35 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total energy intake, and that fat 15 <*> per cent sign </*> or less should be derived from saturated fats. </p><p> <#> To accurately assess your present fat intake in relation to total energy intake is tedious and time consuming, but you can estimate this by noting the fat in grams, you consume each day. <#> Most food labels now contain information on the fat content and if you add up the fat per portion and find it to be more than 80 grams per day (for a woman of normal weight) or 100 grams per day (for a man of normal weight), then you must reduce it. </p><p> <#> If you aim for 70-80 grams per day of which 10-12 grams are from saturated fats, for a woman and 90-100 grams per day for men, of which 13-15 grams are from saturated fats that will bring you within recommended intakes. </p><p> <#> When it comes to the beloved Ulster Fry:- <#> 1. Grill bacon and sausage. <#> 2. Use olive oil or polyunsaturated vegetable oil for frying. <#> 3. Measure the amount of oil you use in a tablespoon, counting 11 grams for each. <#> 4. Keep a note of how much oil you use and try to reduce this to a minimum. <#> 5. Remember the advice of the Bible - to be moderate in all things - make it a monthly treat! </p></I><I><W2B-022$B><h> <#> RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS <#> Jacqui Armstrong </h><p> <bold> <#> Rheumatoid <}> <-> Artiritis </-> <+> Arthritis </+> </}> affects between two and three per cent of the population, with three quarters of the sufferers female. <#> It is a chronic, usually progressive, inflammatory disease of the joints. <#> It usually attacks several joints and in some cases the onset is quite rapid and severe, but more often it develops over several months or even years. </bold> </p><p> <#> The symptoms <}> <-> very </-> <+> vary </+> </{> from person to person. <#> These range from stiffness in the morning, painful and swollen joints, fatigues, to poor appetite and weight loss. </p><p> <#> The inflammation is caused by a reaction between the white blood cells and various chemicals produced by the body. <#> The white blood cells invade the joint and release certain enzymes which secrete chemicals that cause the breakdown of cartilage and bone. </p><p> <#> Medical experts are not sure what causes this chain of events to occur. <#> Some scientists believe rheumatoid arthritis is caused by a virus which causes infection in the arthritic joint. <#> The virus triggers the inflammatory process, but so far it has not been possible to identify the virus responsible for this. </p><p> <#> Other researchers believe it is a malfunction in the body 's immune system. <#> The immune system normally produces antibodies which destroy bacteria and viruses. <#> In the case of rheumatoid arthritis is could be that these antibodies turn against healthy tissue in the body. <#> This is called an "auto-immune response". <#> But if there is no bacteria in the joint, why does the immune system "attack"? </p><p> <#> One theory is that inflammation and destruction in the rheumatoid joint triggers the production of heat shock proteins or stress proteins. <#> The stress proteins are found in all cells and are essential for survival. <#> It is only when they are subjected to ultra violet light, chemicals, heat etc. that they are produced in large quantities to protect the cells. <#> Some experts believe that the immune system may not be able to distinguish between bacterial or viral protein and one of the body 's own proteins, because they both have a similar amino acid structure. </p><p> <#> Other causes of rheumatoid arthritis may be connected to free radical activity. <#> These are unstable chemicals that are made by the body and if they reach high levels they may cause many health problems, including the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. </p><p> <#> Food intolerance may also be involved in this condition. <#> This has not been proved conclusively, but we know that certain foods can make joint pains worse, possibly due to increased acid levels in the blood. </p><p> <#> As we can see there are many complex theories as to how this condition is caused but is there anything that we can do to help the problem? </p><p> <#> One of the things we need to look at is our diet. <#> We have already discussed some of this in part one of this article. <#> This should include plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables cooked and raw, salads, cottage cheese, brown rice, natural yoghurt and use honey as a sweetener. </p><p> <#> Foods to avoid are red meat, pork, ham, white sugar, oranges, lemons, grapefruit, tomatoes, vinegar and too many dairy products. <#> These foods contain a lot of acid which causes an imbalance in the blood which is predominantly alkaline. <#> When the acid levels in the body become too high it can make the inflammation much worse. </p><p> <#> In addition to a balanced diet there are food supplements available that can be of help. <#> Some of these are evening primrose oil, fish oil capsules, vitamin E and vitamin C. </p><p> <#> Vitamin C is a marvellous, natural <}> <-> anti-inflamatory </-> <+> anti-inflammatory </+> </}> and 1-2 grams a day is recommended. <#> An excellent supplement to combat free radical activity is the "Fish Factory". <#> This contains fish oil, beta <}> <-> carotens </-> <+> carotenes </+> </}>, vitamin C and E. </p><p> <#> Along with these supplements we can use some homeopathic preparations. <#> One of these is "Nettidiath" an excellent blood purifier containing acid levels and improves the immune system. </p><p> <#> "Urex tablets" can also be of benefit as these have been known to relieve pain and stiffness in the joints. </p><p> <#> By following these simple measures much can be done to assist the body to overcome the miseries of rheumatism and <}> <-> artiritis. </-> <+> arthritis </+> </}> </p></I><I><W2B-022$C><h> <bold> <#> DREAMING OF A GREEN CHRISTMAS </bold> </h><h> <bold> <#> Be kind to planet earth and save on festive resources </bold> </h><p> <bold> <#> INSTEAD of dreaming of a white Christmas this year, why not think about the environment and do your bit to create a green one? </p><p> <#> In the run-up to Christmas last year sale of food in December increased 16pc on the rest of the year, sales of non-food goods by over 40pc. </p><p> <#> More goods means more packaging and more waste. <#> On top of this many manufacturers garnish their products with extra festive packing in order to tempt the season 's shopper. </p><h> <bold> <#> Scrooge </bold> </h><p> <#> Environmental groups stress that thinking green is easy. <#> It doesn't mean turning to a Scrooge or losing out on the fun. </p><p> <#> Break traditional family rituals and think of imaginative ways of saving resources. <#> Finding new and more careful ways of indulging can be fun.</p><p> <#> Their message is to think before you buy that over-packaged gimmicky gift, pick the usual spruce for the front room or switch on the fairy lights. </p><p> <#> Roger Mortlock of UK 2000, a national environmental group linked with the Department of the Environment, believes people might not automatically think of the environment at Christmas, yet it is an ideal time to do so. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Christmas seems a really good opportunity to start thinking about the environment because most people divide their waste automatically. </p><p> <#> "All the paper and packaging ends up together and provides an easy opportunity to take it for recycling." </quote> </p><p> <#> UK 2000 has launched Action Earth, a seasonal campaign to get people to think of the environment this Christmas. <p><p> <#> As well as producing a Green Guide to Christmas containing a range of ideas to make the festivities more environmentally friendly but no less fun, it is urging people across the country to volunteer for one of a range of green activities. </p><p> <#> John Barwise, head of environmental policy at The Robens Institute Surrey University, stresses the onus is on the individual. </p><p> <quote> <#> "Christmas is a time of mass conspicuous consumption. <#> Clearly there will be a need for people to consume more than they usually do, but whatever we can do to minimise the amount of materials we use the better it will be for the environment." </quote> </p><h> <#> Message </h><p> <#> As a first step, shoppers could look carefully at the way goods are presented and, when producing over-packaged goods, to ask the retailer to remove unnecessary layers of wrapping in the shop. </p><p> <#> This, he says, will send a clear message back to the manufacturer. </p><p> <quote> <#> "That message," </quote> he says, <quote> "has got to come from the consumer." </quote> </p><p> <#> For copies of the Action Earth Green Guide to Christmas write to UK 2000, PO Box 2000, London N1 9NJ. </p><p> <#> Friends of the Earth, 26-28 Underwood Street, London N1 7JQ. </p></I>
