<W2E-003 Ulster editorials 3><I><W2E-003$A><h> <#> <bold> Scrap the play-offs to avoid chaos </bold> </h><p> <#> YESTERDAY marked the final round of matches in the divisional section of the GAA's second most important competition. </p><p> <#> However, it will be another couple of months before the destination of the 1994 National League title is decided. </p><p> <#> A bewildering series of play-off and preliminary play-off games now gets under way, with Ulster counties, as usual, to the fore. </p><p> <#> All Ireland champions Derry, despite suffering their first defeat in almost a year, are already through to the quarter finals, where they will be joined by a resurgent Armagh and, possibly, by both Down and Donegal. </p><p> <#> The only certainty at this stage is that, before the Church <*> ampersand </*> General trophy is handed over, the GAA is in for another period of inter-county fixture chaos. </p><p> <#> The backlog of games will complicate preparations for one of the most eagerly awaited Ulster Championship on record, and is bound to result in the indefinite postponement of club matches all over the province. </p><p> <#> Despite any short-term loss of revenue, the time has surely come to scrap the play-offs, and allow the winners of an enlarged Division One to be declared as national league champions. </p></I><I><W2E-003$B><h> <#> <bold> Irish rainbow </bold> </h><p> <#> <bold> WHOEVER emerges as Taoiseach from a mould-breaking election in the Republic, Dick Spring is the obvious winner and Albert Reynolds the loser. <#> For a major party to double its representation, as Labour appears to have done, is a spectacular success - making Fianna Fail 's failure to win an overall majority all the more humiliating. <#> Mr Reynolds ' only consolation is that the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, fared even worse, signalling that the days of one-party government in the Republic may have gone for good. <#> The electorate may <}> <-> havefinally </-> <+> have finally </+> </}> turned away from old-style Civil War politics, dominated by Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, in favour of rainbow coalitions covering the spectrum from Left to Right. </p><p> <#> Mr Reynolds paid the penalty for calling an election no one wanted, at a time and on grounds that no other Taoiseach would have chosen. <#> His association with the economic recession - and, coincidentally, with obscure wording on the substantive abortion referendum - encouraged a protest vote against the government, which Labour was able to capitalise upon. <#> A public which has seen its standard of living eroded, and which is suffering record unemployment, gladly seized on Labour 's high-spending promises, even though it may have voted more in hope than expectation. <#> The PDs were seemingly unaffected by their unhappy term in the coalition government - probably because Des O'Malley was regarded as a victim of Fianna Fail chicanery - and Fine Gael seem unable to produce a credible leader. </p><p> <#> Now begins the difficult business of building a government from the indecision of the election result. <#> Fianna Fail are still unchallenged as the largest party, but their only hope of retaining power is in coalition - almost certainly under a new leader. <#> While almost any combination is possible, the politicians can hardly ignore the electorate 's clear desire for change. <#> Mr Spring might prefer to avoid the difficult economic decisions which will be necessary, in order to build on his popularity, but he is almost obliged to play his part in government, so overwhelming was his mandate. <#> The problem for the next Taoiseach, of whatever colour, will be to convince the country - and the world at large - that his government has the stability to weather future economic and political storms. <#> As far as Northern Ireland is concerned, any government which can show more sensitivity towards the unionist position - which excludes the present Fianna Fail leadership - would be an improvement. </p></I><I><W2E-003$C><h> <#> <bold> Open season </bold> </h><p> <#> THE Home Secretary's announcement that Sunday trading laws will not be enforced in the run-up to Christmas is surprising in pure legal terms, but is a pragmatic recognition of the fundamental problems arising from existing legislation. <#> Court action on alleged breaches of the Shop Act have been suspended until the European Court of Justice rules on its validity. <#> Eventually MPs are to be allowed a free vote on three options which will reform the law - total deregulation; partial deregulation allowing small shops to open all hours and limited opening for large stores; and a ban on Sunday opening except for specified outlets. </p><p> <#> The second option seems the fairest, offering a compromise solution. <#> Public opinion would appear to favour more widespread Sunday opening, but it is right that there should be some recognition of the special position of the Sabbath. <#> It is also welcome that any new legislation on opening will contain protection for staff, allowing those with strong Sabbatarian views to opt not to work on that day without prejudicing their position. </p><p> <#> Drafting a suitable compromise bill which can be enforced may be a delicate task, but should be proceeded with as soon as practicable. </p></I><I><W2E-003$D><h> <#> <bold> Royal dues </bold> </h><p> <#> The Queen 's voluntary agreement to pay tax on her private income and to prune the Civil List is a welcome and sagacious move. <#> At a stroke she has defused much of the public criticism of the privilege accorded to the Royal Family. <#> She has conceded the principle that the House of Windsor should be treated in fiscal matters in the same manner as her subjects. <#> That, and agreeing to meet the expenses of all but the most senior Royals from her own pocket, will pay a long term dividend in helping to restore the affection of the nation which, to some extent, has been undermined by the behaviour of the younger members of her family. <#> The State will still pay a large part of the cost, but that is a bill which now will be borne more readily by the taxpayer. <#> The whole issue has not been handled well by the Government, which recently indicated that taxation of the Monarch was unlikely. <#> That only served to inflame public opinion. </p></I><I><W2E-003$E><h> <#> <bold> VIEWPOINT </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> Plugging loopholes </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> IRISH JUSTICE: </bold> <it> <#> New extradition machinery must be made to work </it> </h><p> <#> THERE is no more depressing sight, for anyone hopeful of better relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic, than that of IRA or INLA murder suspects walking free from Dublin courts. <#> It happened again yesterday, when extradition proceedings failed against an Armagh man, wanted in connection with the murder of an army careers officer in Derby two years ago. </p><p> <#> No evidence was offered, for the simple reason that last month an attempt to extradite another Armagh man, also an INLA suspect, came to nothing. <#> The judge then held that the murder of the Army sergeant was <quote> "political" </quote> - and in any case there could not be a fair trial because of prejudicial newspaper publicity. </p><p> <#> The Irish state has been saved some legal expenses, but at what a cost to confidence in its ability to deal seriously with the threat of terrorism in another European Union member state. <#> Until new legislation, closing the massive loopholes in the present extradition law, is in place, even those who carried out the mortar attacks on Heathrow would presumably be protected. <#> The law will not be retrospective. </p><p> <#> The UK has been too tolerant, for too long, of the interminable delays in tightening extradition arrangements. <#> There was an attempt to address the problem as long ago as 1973, in Sunningdale, but substitute measures like extra-territorial courts, where suspects can be tried in the Republic for offences committed in the UK, are generally unsatisfactory. </p><p> <#> In the past, technical mistakes were made by the British authorities in extradition warrants, which resulted in several failures. <#> This has largely been overcome, but the problem is that the Irish adopted the European Convention on Terrorism - despite warnings - and now have to amend it to eliminate the plea of a "political" motive. </p><p> <#> The fear must be that even when the law is changed, it will still be possible for the defence to argue that adverse media publicity has ruled out a fair trial. <#> The media must be encouraged to exercise more restraint, but it is impossible to avoid speculation when attacks which kill or endanger hundreds of lives occur. <#> Just because of past events, the Irish judiciary should not assume that terrorist suspects will not get a fair hearing. <#> Otherwise the extradition machinery now being put in place will be a sham, and Anglo-Irish cooperation seen as a one-sided exercise. </p></I><I><W2E-003$F><h> <#> <bold> In camera? </bold> </h><h> <#> <bold> POLICE VIDEOS: </bold> <it> Recording of interrogations could protect both sides </it> </h><p> <#> THE call for video and sound recording of interviews with terrorist suspects is the most controversial proposal in Sir Louis Blom-Cooper 's first report. <#> In the view of the Independent Commissioner for Holding Centres recordings would end prisoners ' claims of mistreatment during interrogation. </p><p> <#> He also argues that it would speed up trials as a significant number of cases hinge on claims about what did or did not happen during police questioning. <#> It is a persuasive argument, although the proposal is strongly opposed by the RUC. </p><p> <#> The police contend that recordings would be ineffective. <#> A suspect could claim that alleged ill-treatment took place out of camera shot or range of the sound recording equipment. <#> More worryingly, the Chief Constable argues that recording of interviews would inhibit the flow of information. </p><p> <#> Suspects in police custody are often questioned about a whole range of matters, not just a single incident. <#> Sometimes information can be obtained which does not relate directly to the person detention was recorded such information might be forthcoming. </p><p> <#> Sir Louis's recommendations suggest a way around this problem. <#> The tapes would be held by a senior police officer and would only be disclosed in very limited circumstances. <#> It should be possible to find a compromise which would satisfy both sides. </p><p> <#> One suggestion is that a judge, sitting in chambers, could decide on the relevant parts of recordings which would be used as evidence in court if the need arose.<#>That would protect the source of information and also the police from charges ofill-treatment. </p></I>
