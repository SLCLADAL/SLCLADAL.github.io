<ICE-IRE:S2A-011 All-Ireland match><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-011$B> <#> The one hundred and fourth All-Ireland Football Final is underway <#> And it is <,> straight away Barry Breen going back for Down who play from right to left in the first half <#> Switching it in <#> James McCartan getting on to it fast <#> And he sends the ball inside towards Greg Blaney <#> Mick Lyons <,> making the first clearance <#> Out to Gerry McEntee who takes up a good position <#> Terry Ferguson <#> Well away from his left quarter <,> back position <#> The marking arrangements for Meath at the back will be interesting <,> as Beggy plays it across towards Coyle who had to stretch out for that one <#> Stafford <,> up towards Bernard Flynn <#> Meath coming looking the first for the first point <,> and won the first free kick <#> David Burns <,> the one who commits the foul <#> David Beggy and co have the chance here to go in front <#> Brian Stafford <,> scored nine points in the Semi-Final <#> It 's the first of the afternoon <,> <#> Always looks most relaxed <,> and absolutely deadly from frees <,> <#> Possession in mid-field for Gerry McEntee <#> He 's fouled <,> bottled up there once again by Eamon Burns <,> <#> In towards Liam Hayes <#> Burns trying to get back <#> Bernard Flynn <,> <#> Against Brendan McKiernan <#> Still Flynn <,> coming looking for the second point <unclear> several words </unclear> <,> <#> That 's a very good start by Meath imposing their will upon the Down backs who are being very slow to settle <,> <#> Mickey McQuillain 's kick right into the middle <#> Mopped up here well by Paddy O'Rourke the team captain <#> Across towards James McCartan who once again has switched back in there <,> trying to make his presence felt <#> Oh that 's a high challenge for Brendan Riley<ICE-IRE:S2A-011$C> <#> Uh James McCartan here is causing a lot of problems for the the Meath full back line <#> Liam Harnan a very high tackle there and very very lucky I think to get away without a booking on that occasion<ICE-IRE:S2A-011$B> <#> The referee was absolutely spot on it was Liam Harnan <,> <#> So it 's knocked over by Gary Mason <,> and Down get their first point in this All-Ireland final <,> <#> Mickey McQuillan here never looks fussy when making a save <#> Always very secure and uh never unduly spectacular <,> <#> This young Down fella I think will remember his day out at Croke Park <#> Oh a huge <,> leap in the air by Ross Carr taking it with some difficulty against <,> Martin O'Connell <#> It 's given away to Gerry McEntee <#> Blocked down by Greg Blaney <#> Taken now by Liam Harnan <,> <#> Fed forward <,> towards Bernard Flynn <,> who 's taken up a roving commission early on <#> It 's Harnan once <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> again stepping into the breach <#> another foul <,> <#> Meath 's third free kick <#> Dropped deep towards P J Gillic and it 's <,> fetched in there splendidly somehow by the full-back Conor Deegan <#> Had the presence of mind to link up with his goal-keeper Neil Collins <#> He 's given it away to Liam Hayes coming racing through the centre <#> In towards David Beggy on the edge of the small square <#> Fed back towards Brian Stafford <#> There 's a man loose that was Bernard Flynn <#> But he couldn't get it to him <#> Instead he 's put it wide <#> Meath 's first wide of the match <#> Down with one wide as well <#> That from the free kick by Gary Mason earlier on <#> Harnan takes the free <,> <#> Taken down nicely <#> Burns <,> <#> Brendan Riley going for the first <unclear> several words </unclear> <#> But James McCartan has got there <#> The referee says play on or does he <#> No he 's whistled back the play for the foul by Mick Lyons <#> The referee seemed to have allowed an advantage initially <,> <#> <unclear> words </unclear> two points for Meath <#> Two points for Down <,> <#> Martin O'Connell <#> Dropped in <#> Gillic touches it down <,> to Stafford <,> and the old one-two <#> And Stafford gets his second point of the afternoon to restore Meath 's advantage <#> Oh he always is waiting around there waiting for the break of the ball <#> That was touched down splendidly <#> And Stafford did the rest <#> Mickey Linden coming out for this one <#> Secure catch <#> And then he takes a high one to the face from Kevin Foley I think <#> Gary Mason <,> plays it down <#> Greg Blaney coming in <#> Gets by the <,> hard challenge <#> And the referee whistles and signals it 's going to be a free <#> All this while Mickey Linden is down injured having made a good secure catch <#> I think he got an <,> elbow in the face <,><ICE-IRE:S2A-011$C> <#> Yeah here we see there Mickey Linden getting the ball but here we see Kevin <.> Fo </.> oh very high tackle there <#> Uh <,> a few of the Meath players have got away with a few high tackles so far and lucky to get away with those<ICE-IRE:S2A-011$B> <#> So it 's going to be a free kick <#> And Gary Mason has the chance to level up the match <#> He 's Down 's only scorer so far <,> <#> It 's three points each <,> <#> Just over fifteen minutes gone in the first half <,> <#> David Beggy <#> Breen the one who 's coming in to make a challenge <#> Cross towards Brian Stafford <#> Out-marked however <#> And it 's Burns that chips it away towards Gary Mason <#> Kevin Foley there too for Meath <#> Now Tommy Dowd <,> looking up spotted that uh the corner forward Bernard Flynn had made a run across <#> A good passage of play by Meath <#> Liam Hayes kicking very slowly <#> And the team captain has put it over the bar <#> And Meath go back in front again <#> Hayes 's first point in the game <#> Gary Mason waiting for the break of the ball <#> And very <,> suitably it came his way <#> Peter Withnell again there <#> Liam Hayes trying to get it loose <#> Now Ross Carr <,> pursued by Martin O'Connell and Colm Coyle <#> O'Rourke inside <,> to Greg Blaney <,> nicely fed forward to Eamon Burns <#> And Down go in front for the first time in the match <#> They were behind by two points initially <#> Came back <#> And then they 've swapped points with Meath ever since <#> But this is the first time they 've gone in front <,> <#> Hayes competing with Burns <#> Beggy <,> a man free outside him on his right hand side <#> One on his left as well as Gillic <#> Coyle <,> steadying himself with a shot but it <,> falls short into the arms of Conor Deegan <#> Deegan out towards Greg Blaney <#> There against Liam Harnan <#> It breaks down to Colm Coyle <#> Meath so good at waiting for the breaking ball <#> And expecting it to come their way <#> O'Connell <#> Stafford <#> It 's a Meath side working very very hard for all their scores this afternoon <#> Under some pressure <#> Comes down off the post <#> Back down to the secure hands of D J Kane <,> now John Kelly <#> Plenty of altitude <#> Harnan <unclear> words </unclear> too much time to watch that one <#> It 's going to be a free for Down <#> Greg Blaney wants to take it quickly <#> Across towards Mickey Linden <,> trying to get inside Terry Ferguson <#> It 's with Withnell <#> Lyons standing back from him <#> Now putting in the challenge <#> Reaches James McCartan <#> and Down lead by two points <#> Well he 's looked the liveliest so far on the inside forward line <#> He looks as though he could do an awful lot if he gets the right kind of ball <#> He 's got his first point in the afternoon <#> Liam Hayes reaching up <,> happy to see P J Gillic who was uh programmed at mid-field but because of Colm O'Rourke 's absence has played elsewhere <#> Coming in to take that one <#> Riley once more <#> Many many frees now in this match <,> a total of thirty-one so far <#> And we 're just inside two minutes to go to half time <#> Conor Deegan <#> Coyle <#> Nice controlled play by the Down men <#> Burns <,> belting it forward <#> Comes off the chest of Kevin Foley <#> Greg Blaney going forward with purpose <#> McCartan has a player outside him if he wants to give it to him that is Ross Carr <#> And the referee has whistled <#> And it 's a free to Down <#> Ross Carr lobbed the ball <#> Hit it in <#> But in any case it 's going to be a free <#> Sean Boylan and uh Colm O'Rourke <#> I wonder when they 'll decide to introduce Colm <#> Ross Carr <,> trying to put four points between the teams <#> He 's done precisely that with his third point of the afternoon <#> Down leading by double scores <#> And the bookmakers all around the country who made them rank outsiders <,> must be uh having the odd little touch of panic at this stage <#> Well Bart Simpson is here in any case <#> Good kick out by Mickey McQuillian towards Gerry McEntee <,> having a very fine match indeed <#> Of course P J Gillic who started once again at right corner forward <#> Liam Hayes prods it inside towards Bernard Flynn <#> David Beggy calling for it on his left-hand side but Flynn has the confidence and composure to kick himself go for the first point of the second half and cut back the deficit now to just three points <#> That 's two points now for Bernard Flynn <#> First time back out into the middle <#> Martin O'Connell <,> down to Greg Blaney <,> <#> Down motoring well <#> Barry Breen now <,> a quick look up on the left boot <#> Coming down from the clouds towards Peter Withnell and Mickey Linden <#> Linden gets there first <#> There 's plenty of support play <#> Ross Carr there <#> Barry Breen there as well <#> And James McCartan <#> Little chip shot by McCartan <#> And it 's up and it 's over the bar <#> His second point of the day <#> And he 's proving a real handful for anybody who 's set to mark him so far <#> I think he scored two points in last year 's League Final as well <#> And then it was Kevin Foley who had the task of subduing him on that occasion<ICE-IRE:S2A-011$C> <#> Yeah we were saying earlier on in the first half how influential Greg Blaney can be but he won that ball in midfield and brought it forward uh <#> Here we see James McCartan getting the ball <,> taking on the Meath defence and I 've seen it all Ger when I 've seen James McCartan kicking the point with his left foot<ICE-IRE:S2A-011$B> <#> <&> laughter </&> Now to John Kelly <#> Down keeping their balance and composure in defence and a good man-to-man mark up <#> All this while Peter Withnell is down injured <#> James McCartan <,> again coming across over this right-hand side <#> Ross Carr <#> Carr kicking with the left <#> And it 's gone in <#> That 's a silver point by Ross Carr <#> Never bent <,> either right or left <#> Was absolutely dead straight <#> And how about that <#> A five-point difference <#> Taking the free to James McCartan <#> An exciting player in full flight <#> Flynn tried to go back and put in a challenge <#> It 's with Mickey Linden <#> Linden yet to score in this game <#> Now 's his chance <#> And he 's put it over <,> <#> There 's a big sign <,> outside a pub which is owned by Mickey Linden 's mother and aunties which says <,> Mickey bring back the Sam McGuire <#> They 're doing the business so far <#> And Colm O'Rourke is coming in as we watch the reprise</I>
