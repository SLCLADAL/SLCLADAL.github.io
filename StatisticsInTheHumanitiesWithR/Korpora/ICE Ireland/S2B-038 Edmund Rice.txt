<ICE-IRE:S2B-038 Edmund Rice><I><ICE-IRE:S2B-038$A> <#> Edmund Rice 's life spanned a crucial era <,> from the dawn of Catholic Emancipation to the eve of the Great Famine <#> These were critical years in the formation of Irish Catholic consciousness <,> marking the emergence from the Penal era and the establishment of the modern Church <#> In all of this <,> Rice made a significant contribution <,> fostering confidence <,> and creating the literate class which gave modern Ireland its Catholic nationalist character <#> The beatification of Edmund Rice will inevitably focus attention on his life and deeds <#> He 's perhaps one of the most famous men of his generation <,> yet ironically <,> surprisingly little is known about him <#> The absence of a diary <,> memoirs <,> or a contemporary biographer restrict our images of the man 's personality <,> to mere glimpses <#> Above all his modesty and reticence <,> make him an elusive subject <,,> <#> His contemporaries for instance <,> appear to have been unaware of the most basic details about his short marriage and his handicapped daughter <#> Edmund 's modesty was extreme <#> On one occasion the brothers requested him to sit for a portrait <,> <#> <quote> For what </quote> <,> he snapped <,> <#> <quote> So that you can look at it while I 'm in purgatory </quote> <#> As a result subsequent artistic representations <,> do little to reveal his character <#> And gradually the ruggedness of his earliest portrait gave way to the stylised <,> airbrushed prints so familiar to any pupil of the Brothers ' schools <#> In a similar way <,> the removal of the farm buildings around the Rice home at Callan County Kilkenny <,> has given the cottage an unnatural appearance <#> And from this it is difficult to imagine the life lived by the family at Westcourt <#> Yet in a sense <,> the memory of Edmund Rice has become a victim of the same treatment <#> Successive biographers have isolated Rice from his historical context <,> <.> an </.> and this exercise has created a bland image <,> of a pious benefactor <,> devoting his considerable wealth to the education of a grateful poor <#> Such an interpretation <,> uh offers an image of Rice and his time which is without nuance <,> <#> Uhm the Penal era is presented in absolute terms <,> uh where Catholics are reduced to slavery and subjection <,> and to unrelenting persecution <,> ignorance and misery <#> Yet in stark contrast <,> the Rice household is portrayed as a warm comfortable environment <,> in which the young Edmund gained a love of God and practical lessons in charity <#> Uhm so little explanation is offered for this apparent contradiction <,> nor of Edmund 's ability to amass a considerable fortune <#> So the challenge then <,> is to separate Edmund Rice from these hagiographical representations <,> so that by recreating his historical context <,> we may arrive at a more accurate appreciation of his character <,> and the significance of his achievement <#> Recent historical writing has challenged the traditionally-accepted image of the Penal era as a period of unrelenting persecution <#> Instead <,> the story of the Church which emerges <,> is one of endurance <,> and emergence <#> And this was a period of gradual revival <,> a period where Catholics creatively exploited loopholes in the Penal code <,,> <#> Uh in many respects however <,> uhm the Catholic revival was uneven <,,> <#> Uhm the obvious differences were geographic <,> and the recovery was most pronounced in mid-Munster and south Leinster <#> And this renewal percolated only slowly into Ulster and north Connacht <#> In social terms too <,> uh contrary to the received image <,> Catholicism as an institutional force <,> was more firmly entrenched in the richer areas <,> amongst the upper social classes <,> uh and in the towns <#> The complexity of this Penal era <,> is reflected in the case of the Rice family of Callan <#> Edmund 's father farmed one hundred and eighty-two acres <,> and their home was similar to many owned by strong farmers <#> It was a long thatched cottage <,> with four bedrooms <,> a kitchen <,> a parlour and a small hall <#> The Rice family lived a frugal lifestyle <,> and this was in part <,> the key to the strength of these rising families <#> They had small outgoings <#> Uhm they were able to endure hard times <#> But during the <.> la </.> agricultural boom in the last quarter of the eighteenth century <,> they were in a position to accumulate capital <#> Now this prosperity coincided with the first steps towards the dismantling of the Penal Laws <#> From seventeen seventy-eight onwards <,> Catholics were in a position to avail of leases <,> and they could often outbid their more ostentatious Protestant neighbours <#> The Rices of Westcourt were notoriously ambitious <,> and evidence suggests that they were regarded as land-grabbers <#> By all accounts they were anxious to become rich quick <,> and they were fond of land <,> and always eager to secure a good place <#> But these ambitions could not be satisfied without serious social consequences <#> And the advance of the large tenant farmers <,> increased land hunger <,> unemployment <,> and this led to rural unrest amongst the Catholic community <#> But like many of their class <,> the Rices had a second string to their bow <,> and the Waterford branch of the family maintained a thriving provisioning business <#> Edmund 's uncle specialised in livestock <,> the slaughtering and the packing and exporting of meat to Bristol and Newfoundland <#> Uh in addition <,> he <.> ad </.> very lucrative contracts with the admiralty <,> and with shipping companies <#> Uh in seventeen seventy-nine <,> uh the young Edmund joined his uncle at Waterford <,> and within twenty years <,> through trade and shrewd investments <,> he <.> ad </.> amassed a fortune and land-holdings in excess of two thousand acres <#> Yet in this too <,> there is suggestion that Edmund <,> like his family in Callan may have been anxious to get rich quick <#> Perhaps his subsequent condemnation of money lending <,> suggests that he was engaged in that practice <#> Yet it was from this class of Catholics <,> the strong farmers and the merchant ranks <,> that the great impetus for the Catholic revival came <#> These were the driving force behind the spate of chapel building which characterised the period <,> and it was they who tackled the problems of Catholic education <#> This was a closely-knit group <,> and they shared many common connections <#> The Jesuit provincial Peter Kenny for instance <,> was the spiritual director to both Edmund Rice and Teresa Ball <,> the founder of the Irish Loreto Sisters <#> Uh Edmund was inspired by the work of Nano Nagle <,> and she in return was related to Edmund Burke the great champion of Catholic Emancipation <#> Uhm she was also related to Father Theobald Matthew <,> the Apostle of Temperance <,> <#> Uh so in Waterford <,> uh Edmund <,> the successful businessman and merchant <,> was at the centre of a bustling social scene <,> and this included the prosperous Aylwards <,> the Shields and the St Leger families <#> Uhm Edmund shared their concerns and ambitions <#> Uh he played an active role in Catholic politics of the time <#> He was a member of the Catholic Committee <,> which campaigned for emancipation <,> and his name appeared in the Waterford address <,> in support of the Catholic Declaration of seventeen ninety-two <#> It was at this time too <,> that Edmund met Mary Elliot <,> uh the daughter of a Waterford tanner <,> and whom he married in seventeen eighty-five <#> Uhm yet surprisingly little is known of this crucial period in Edmund 's life <#> Uh in one biography of over five hundred pages <,> the episode is dealt with in just a few paragraphs <#> Tragically <,> this marriage ended abruptly <,> with Mrs Rice 's sudden death in seventeen eighty-nine <#> But this crisis was compounded <,> by the fact that Edmund was left to care for the couple 's handicapped daughter <#> Again little is known of the extent or the nature <,> of Mary Rice 's handicap <#> Perhaps this is due in part to his own reserve <,> but it may also reflect an attempt by Rice 's earlier followers <,> to preserve their founder from any suggestion of genetic weakness <#> Accordingly <,> Mrs Rice 's death was attributed to a fall from a horse <,> an accident which conveniently accounted for the handicapped <,> premature daughter uh <#> Clearly Edmund was desolated <,> and while no record of his grief survives <,> a letter written to a friend in similar circumstances <,> reflects an empathy with their misery and misfortune <#> It is clear too <,> that this tragedy <,> marked a very perceptible change in his life and priorities <#> This was the moment of his conversion <,> the point where he abandoned the ambitions of his class <,> and where his religious faith and the practical expression of it became the dominant feature of his life <#> In seventeen ninety <,> he joined a religious confraternity <,> a confraternity dedicated to charity and the frequent reception of the sacraments <#> Uhm his name appears on the subscription lists <,> for several religious publications <,> including the Dublin edition of a Bible which he annotated influential texts <#> At this time too <,> he was among the founders of The Trinitarian Orphan Society <,> and in seventeen four ninety-four <,> he assisted in the establishment of the Waterford Society <,> for the Relief of Distressed Room Keepers <#> His principle concern however <,> was the plight of prisoners <,> and this remained a priority throughout his life <#> There are two fascinating accounts from this time <,> of individual beneficiaries of Rice 's charity <#> Uh one was a black slave boy <,> who Edmund saw on the deck of a vessel at the quay in Waterford <#> Reflecting sentiments of his contemporary Wilberforce <,> Rice bought the boy from the ship 's master <,> and entrusted him to the care of the Presentation Sisters on Hennessy 's Road <#> When the boy grew <,> he worked as a messenger for the Sisters <,> and later Edmund helped him to purchase a premises <#> In time Black Johnny succeeded in business <,> and on his death his property <,> consisting of two houses <,> was left between the Christian Brothers <,> and the Presentation Sisters <#> A second beneficiary was the young Italian immigrant Charles Bianconi <,> whom Rice advised and helped to secure a premises in Clonmel <#> In time Bianconi established a thriving transport system and was elected Mayor of the town <#> But he never forgot his early benefactor <,> and each year he sent fifty pounds <,> and twenty suits of clothes for the poor boys <#> His appreciation for the good friend who took a kindly interest in him <,> was reflected in a clause of his will which <,> in the absence of an heir <,> would have bequeathed his fortune to the Christian Brothers <#> Unfortunately <,> Bianconi was survived by a daughter <#> Uh in time then <,> Edmund considered a vocation to the priesthood <,> and the Augustinian Order <,> of which his brother John became Assistant General seemed an obvious choice <#> Yet his brother and friends in Waterford <,> convinced him otherwise <,> arguing that his calling was to the poor of the city <,> rather than the seclusion of the monastic cloister <#> Edmund 's religious conversion <,> coincided with a heated educational debate in Waterford <,> a debate which had begun with Bishop Hussy 's forthright condemnation <,> of the proselytising schools <#> Edmund was inspired by this argument <,> and in eighteen hundred <,> he set out to do for the poor boys of Waterford <,> what Nano Nagle had done for the Catholic girls of Cork <#> His first school began in an old stable in New Street <#> Conditions there were primitive <#> Furniture was sparse <,> and benches were borrowed each day from a nearby pub <#> Uh Rice lived above the school <,> and within months he was joined by two Callan men <,> and together they formed a religious community <#> This trio <,> was the genesis of what would become two great religious congregations <,> The Presentation and the Christian Brothers <#> Uhm the hedge schools of the Penal era were not as we once believed <#> Uh in reality <,> they were private fee-paying schools <,> which operated on a commercial basis <,> uh and this made them inaccessible to the vast majority of the population <#> Uh in general the only alternative <,> uhm was the free education offered by the endowed schools <,> but the Catholic community was suspicious of their alleged proselytising activities <#> So it was for this reason <,> that Edmund and his confreres set about offering a Catholic education to the poor <,> uh the poor about whom nobody cared <#> Uhm but the Brothers ' charity extended beyond the provision of educating uh education <#> The Brothers ' pupils received a daily meal of bread and milk <,> and a tailor was employed at Mount Zion to repair the boys ' tattered clothes <#> Uh it was understandable <,> that Rice received invitations from bishops throughout Ireland <,> to establish schools in their diocese <,> and whenever possible <,> he responded favourably <#> Uhm but there were limitations on his freedom of response <#> The shortage of manpower remained a problem <,> uhm and it was not long before his <.> k </.> fortune was exhausted</I>
