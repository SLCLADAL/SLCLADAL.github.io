<W1B-012 Donegal letters><I><W1B-012$A><h> <#> 26/7/94 </h><p> <#> Well hello there, <#> How are you all? <#> Now from what I hear you 're all doing pretty o.k. <#> I 've already written you a letter but according to your last letter to Aoife you mustn't have got it. <#> I posted it about three or four weeks ago and it was airmail so I 'm sure you should have had it by now. <#> Anyway if you get it before this I 'm sorry if they both have the same news in them. </p><p> <#> I 'm really glad that you all got jobs and somewhere to stay and stuff. <#> From what you said in your postcards etc. you seem to be having a big massive ball. <#> You bastards! <#> I can't believe that bud is only 50 cents a can. <#> <}> <-> Thats </-> <+> That 's </+> </}> unbelievable! <#> It costs me about fucking <*> pound sign </*> 15 to get pissed where it only costs you about 4 dollars. <#> As I said before you bastards. <#> Anyway while we 're on the subject I don't know when I had a big drinking session like the ones we used to have in good old Jordanstown. <#> I can't wait until October, it 'll be great to be off our faces again you know the old gang together again. </p><p> <#> Anyway as you probably know Aoife and me are still together. <#> It 's a real bastard now during the summer as we hardly see each other (we didn't get jobs in Belfast as you probably know). <#> I was lucky enough I got a job at home but the pay is shite and I usually work six days a week. <#> It 's a shoe shop and it gets really busy. <#> I 'm really fucked off with it already and I 've only been there just over a month. <#> I would love to leave it and go away with Aoife for a while but it looks like I won't be able because I need money for next year and that. </p><p> <#> Anyway <}> <-> thats </-> <+> that 's </+> </}> what I 'm at the minute, stacks of excitement or what! <#> Oh yeah! <#> I 've got a house for next year but I couldn't get a six bedroom house for all of us. <#> I 've had to get a house with Simon (my mate from home) and this other fella. <#> It 's a real bastard because I 'm sort of stuck on my own now I don't know what Brian, Steo and Edward are going to do but I 'm trying my best to help them find somewhere. <#> Och it 's not too late and I 'm sure they 'll get somewhere. <#> Anyway my house <}> <+> is </+> </}> in 17 Cedar Row it 's a wee street off Davenport avenue. <#> The house is really nice, everything is almost brand new. <#> The rent is <*> pound sign </*> 100 a month but I couldn't find anything much cheaper. <#> I think the lads are a bit annoyed with me. <#> Brian 's grand he rings me all the time but I hardly ever hear from Edward or Steo. <#> I really hope I don't lose them as friends over something so stupid. <#> There was nothing else I could have done, it was the only way we could have split up the six of us. <#> I couldn't expect them to live with somebody they didn't know. <#> I really wanted to live with them boys (Steo etc.) because the crack would have been great. <#> Och well, there 's nothing I can do now. </p><p> <#> Now I hope you two boys are behaving yourself over there. <#> I 'd be shocked now if you even looked at them evil american girls. <#> You know you poor innocent irish fellas could get yourselves in trouble over there. <#> You know them girls have only one thing on their minds - sex. <#> Now I 've only one thing to say to you - YOU JAMMY BASTARDS. <#> You 'll have to write back to me and tell me all the crack, you know all the stuff you couldn't tell Aoife. </p><p> <#> Didn't you say you were coming back at the end of August? <#> Well if you are, make sure you ring me when you get back (0103536395721) or better still come down here and stay a few nights. <#> There 's plenty of room. <#> We 'll be able to meet up with the boys and go out and get completely paralectic. </p><p> <#> Anyway I reckon I 'd better head on now. <#> I 've loads more to tell you and ask you but I 'll save it until you get back. <#> Look after yourselves now and write back soon 'cos I really want to hear from you. </p><p> <#> See you all soon, <#> your old pal, <#> Ciar&/an </p></I><I><W1B-012$B><h> <#> 27/7/94 </h><h> <#> Brian Fielding, <#> Letterkenny, <#> Co. Donegal. <#> Eire, <#> <ul> Europe? </ul> </h><p> <#> Dear Lisa, <#> How the fuck is it going. <#> Sorry for keeping it so long but I am flat out working in the Bar in Carrigart 6 days a week. <#> It was nice of you to drop me a line twice because I am missing J/town really bad. <#> You can't do anything <ul> Mad! </ul> Down here. <#> The barwork is really hard but I think I am beginning to enjoy it. <#> I was 2 hours late for work this morning. <#> I was supposed to be in at 10.00 am <*> ampersand sign </*> open at 11. am but I woke at 12.00 am. <#> The boss phoned up <*> ampersand sign </*> gave out fucking shit. <#> Hay - Hay it was funny. <#> What 's new <unclear> 1 word </unclear> Steo in a bad mood with me kind-of 'cause I was supposed to go to Quigleys Point with him one night <*> ampersand sign </*> stay with him but I had a very busy night at work <*> ampersand sign </*> couldn't get off. <#> Oh! by the way I got the Zippo the other day. <#> About time. <#> I waited a fuckin' century for it. <#> Silly fuckers ran out of stock. <#> Steo 's in great form. <#> He visited me in the pub when I was at work. <#> Himself, Edward <*> ampersand sign </*> Edward 's brother Geoff. <#> I was really fucking thick that night, it was very hard for me to work while they were there. <#> I knew Steo was really disappointed but I couldn't do nothing. <#> It was funny I was going to quit <*> ampersand sign </*> walk out. <#> When they were going I went outside <*> ampersand sign </*> Steo wanted me to go for a quick joint down the side. <#> He 's mental crack. <#> Nicest <}> <-> fillow </-> <+> fellow </+> </}> I 've ever met, after you that is ..... fuck off. <#> It is very hard to get out when <}> <-> your </-> <+> you 're </+> </}> behind the bar. <#> Last thursday night I got off <*> ampersand sign </*> went out with Rick. <#> Rick couldn't believe what I was drinking. <#> He was drinking guinness <*> ampersand sign </*> <}> <+> I </+> </}> was <}> <-> was </-> </}> drinking double vodkas + Coke. <#> I must have had about 15 doubles. <#> I spent 54 quid. to be Exact. <#> I was well gone at the end of the night <*> ampersand sign </*> all I remember is going back to some girls caravan snogging her <*> ampersand sign </*> fucking off up the road in one of my Ex-girlfriend 's car. <#> Then <}> <-> pucking </-> <+> puking </+> </}> my guts out in front of the house. <#> Good night! <#> On the other hand now I 'm trying to settle down <*> ampersand sign </*> study for my Exams. <#> I failed 2 (maths/Economics shit!) <*> ampersand sign </*> a physics coursework. <#> I 'm a bit worried. <#> I don't think I 'm going to make it through. <#> But I 'll try my best. </p><p> <#> Rick 's in great form <*> ampersand sign </*> so is the family. <#> I was speaking to Fintan <*> ampersand sign </*> he 's in good form. <#> Him <*> ampersand sign </*> Aoife are still going <ul> really </ul> strong. <#> I think I 'll go now Lisa. <#> I was never a good letter writer, this is the first bit of writing I 've done since the exams, (as you can see). <#> I can't wait 'till we all get together again, I miss the crack. <#> Take care of yourself. <#> I <}> <-> here </-> <+> hear </+> </}> there 's a dangerous disease over <}> <-> their </-> <+> there </+> </}> to keep an eye on its to do with going with girls <*> ampersand sign </*> kissing <*> ampersand sign </*> stuff. <#> (called <ul> Aids </ul> ) ............. . </p><#> Give me another shout if you 've time O.K. <#> See you soon, <#> Take care,<#> <ul> Brian </ul></I><I><W1B-012$C><h> <#> September 3rd <#> Rathmullan. </h><p> <#> Well Viv, <#> You 've just given me your address so I thought I 'd sit down and <}> <-> right </-> <+> write </+> </}> you a wee letter before it 's time for work. <#> I 've nothing very exciting to tell you but anyway. <#> Like I was saying I 'm working in the Water 's Edge. <#> Its ok. <#> I don't mind the actual work but I hate having the Meaneys for my bosses. <#> Money-grabbing, greedy bastards with no consciences. <#> Pay 's shit - <*> pound sign </*> 3 but tips are usually good enough - other waitresses are nice apart from one or two. <#> New bloke started a couple of days ago. <#> He 's SOOO stupid. <#> Every time I see him I just want to slap him. <#> He walks around with this really gormless expression on his face all day long, spills food on people - forgets to leave orders with the chef etc etc. <#> And I suspect he pockets the tips - we 're supposed to share them out at the end of the night. <#> Oh well. </p><p> <#> I had a superb, fantastic <*> plus sign </*> wondrous time in Ecuador - even better than last year, love the place so much <*> plus sign </*> can't wait to go back. <#> I 'm dead excited about going to Cuba too - but need to start gathering in the money fast. <#> I have to have paid 80 <*> percent sign </*> of the sponsorship <*> pound sign </*> 1800 by November 5th - gasp! <#> I 'll do it no problem though. <#> I guess. <#> I just need to focus for a <}> <-> white </-> <+> while </+> </}>. <#> My biggest problem is that all the money I collect here, I have to convert to sterling and could lose up to 23p in the <*> pound sign </*> - Imagine. <#> So expensive. <#> I got my funding in the end up for this masters - only fees though. <#> So I 've applied for a couple of jobs in Queen 's - in the library <*> plus sign </*> in QFT, which would be spot on <*> plus sign </*> <*> pound sign </*> 3.60 for doing nothing much at all. </p><p> <#> Our new house is dead on. <#> It needs a lick of paint, which I 'll do next week on my days off, probably. <#> I 'm really happy to be living in a small house with just Nuala <*> plus sign </*> Ciara - no smeggy boys around the place. <#> You 'll have to pay us regular visits before you head away to Ozzie land. <#> Did I tell you Declan 's going to stay on there? <#> He decided he likes it so much he doesn't want to come home so he 'll be here in November for three weeks holidays <*> plus sign </*> then back out. </p><p> <#> Mickey and me finished on amicable terms - just to put your mind at rest!! <#> And he said if I ever wanted to go back out just to say the word - so fear not! <#> But seriously, I just don't fancy him in any way anymore, tis well weird - that I was sooo into him <*> plus sign </*> now just can't imagine going out with him at all. <#> I think maybe it was so wonderful before I left just because he was such a babe. <#> I totally fancied him of course <*> plus sign </*> it was a brilliant way to not get stressed during finals - how relaxed was I? <#> That sounds really cruel but the more I think about it the more spot-on it seems. <#> Plus the fact that he treated me really well <*> plus sign </*> we had nice romantic walks in the park <*> plus sign </*> dinners <*> plus sign </*> just messed about together all day, every day. <#> But when it boils down to it, we never had very much in common. <#> You know? </p><p> <#> Sorry to blabber on Vivian but it 's helping me get my ideas straight in my own head too - poor you! </p><p> <#> As for Kevin - he 's very cool <*> plus sign </*> I like him a whole heap. <#> We told each other we loved each other in Ba&~nos after only being together a few days - but not as in "in love" but just like when you meet someone <*> plus sign </*> get on like a house on fire <*> plus sign </*> you feel really excited about getting to know each other better - it could be a friend you know what I mean? <#> I was very self-controlled <*> plus sign </*> nothing much went on because of Michael, but it was very intense <*> plus sign </*> brilliant <*> plus sign </*> we 've spoken on the phone quite often since I got back <*> plus sign </*> emails every day. <#> He 's going to try <*> plus sign </*> come over for my b'day in November, but he 's having huge money problems at the moment. <#> So I 'm trying not to get my hopes up about it happening. <#> One way or another, he 's coming to Cuba in January for definite so at worst we 'll see each other there. <#> I 'm extending my flight for 10 days after the cycling trip is over to travel a bit, avec B. <#> I figure there 's no point in going all that way and not seeing a bit more of the place. <#> Chance of a lifetime <*> plus sign </*> all that. <#> I 'll be getting a loan from the good old Northern Bank to pay for it. <#> Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!!! <#> God I love travelling. <&Spanish> <#> Que mas? </&Spanish> <#> Oh yeah, Caoimhe <*> plus sign </*> me are doing a Reiki course in Derry all day tomorrow. <#> It 's chinese energy healing - <}> <-> channeling </-> <+> channelling </+> </}> the heat <*> plus sign </*> energy from your body, laying on of hands (!) - type-thing. <#> It should be interesting, a giggle if nothing else. <#> Caoimhe 's in great form. <#> She 's working in Toomey 's at the weekends so we 've been having a good time together for the last few weeks. <#> It 's good to have someone around to chat to. <#> Otherwise I 'd have cracked up ages ago in the house. </p><p> <#> I haven't been speaking to Rosbeg since I came home but her uncle died last week. <#> She 's still in Galway. <#> I don't know what her plans are. <#> Janet 's (the australian girl I met in Ecuador) coming home this weekend - she lives in Dublin. <#> Can't wait to see her, she 's very cool. </p><p> <#> I 'm applying for my provisional driving license at the minute. <#> <ul> Supposedly </ul> I 'm going to learn to drive - that 's the plan anyway. <#> I 'm dying to get my test done and all that but realistically it 'll take months to get myself organised. </p><p> <#> Right dear, I 'll have to go now cause I 've a few things to do before I go to work. <#> I hope I haven't bored you silly with my ramblings. </p><p> <#> Thanks a million for phoning <*> plus sign </*> call again if you get the chance or write or email, whatever. <#> Say hi to everyone else. <#> Take care <*> plus sign </*> I 'll see you soon. </p><p> <#> Love <*> plus sign </*> hugs, <#> Rach XX.</p></I>
