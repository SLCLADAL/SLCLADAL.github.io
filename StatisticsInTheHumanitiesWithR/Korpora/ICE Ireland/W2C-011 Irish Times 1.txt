<W2C-011 Irish Times 1><I><W2C-011$A><h> <#> <bold> Financial regulator proposal for Cabinet tomorrow </h><h> <ul> <#> New body planned to operate separately from Central Bank </ul> <h><h> <#> By Jane Suiter,<#> Economics Correspondent </bold> </h><p> <#> THE Cabinet is to be asked tomorrow to establish a new independent regulator to police the financial services sector. The plan is part of a response to the controversy in the financial sector, most recently at Allied Irish Banks. </p><p> <#> The T&/anaiste, Ms Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, are jointly tabling the proposals. <#> They agree that a new regulatory body should be established, separate from the Central Bank, to supervise the banks and other financial institutions. </p><p> <#> Although on the drawing board for some months, the process is being speeded up as a direct response to the latest financial controversy which has erupted over AIB and the inquiry into its handling of DIRT tax liabilities. </p><p> <#> Senior ministers have expressed concern that the current regulatory structure is not equipped to deal with such situations. <#> It is understood that Ms Harney and Mr McCreevy want to move swiftly to offset criticism of the Central Bank. </p><p> <#> The Central Bank has said that its primary role is to oversee the overall health of the financial system. <#> It is expected that the new body will be asked to focus much more directly on consumer protection and on the proper running of the financial institutions. </p><p> <#> The presentation of the joint proposal means that Cabinet approval for the new regulator is practically guaranteed. </p><p> <#> It is the result of the conclusions of a joint working group between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Finance, which was set up earlier this year. <#> But it will be next year before the new authority is set up. </p><p> <#> If approved by Cabinet, it will be a severe setback for the Central Bank. <#> The bank is already to lose its monetary policy decision-making functions as part of the move to the single currency and the supervisory side of its role has been the fastest growing part of its brief for some time. </p><p> <#> When he appeared before the D&/ail Committee of Public Accounts last week, the bank 's governor, Mr Maurice O'Connell, said the bank could see the logic of bringing the regulation of the insurance sector into the same organisation as the banks. </p><p> <#> However he insisted that there was no point in bringing taxation supervision into the same body, saying such a move had not worked anywhere in the world. </p><p> <#> Mr O'Connell also admitted it was necessary for consumer protection to take on a more clearly defined and transparent role. <#> He said the bank would be prepared to take on such a role if legislation was changed. </p><p> <#> Speaking on RT&/E Radio 's <it> This Week </it> programme yesterday, Mr McCreevy said the bank was not at fault in the AIB affair and insisted it had done an excellent job within its remit of prudential regulation.</p><p> <#> The bank has been in charge of banking supervision since 1971, but in recent years significant extra responsibility has come its way through the regulation of the IFSC, the Stock Exchange as well as investment intermediaries. </p><p> <#> Meanwhile the D&/ail Committee of Public Accounts continues its investigation of the AIB affair this week and is to have a conference of its legal advisers along with those of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr John Purcell, today, to consider its next steps. </p><p> <#> AIB 's former group internal auditor, Mr Anthony Spollen, is among the witnesses who have been invited to appear before the committee and is likely to appear shortly. <#> He will defend his estimate that the bank 's outstanding DIRT tax liability was around <*> pound sign </*> 100 million. <#> Mr Spollen may also tell the committee about criticisms of the bank 's handling of the non-resident account issue and other issues, contained in a lengthy memo which he submitted to the bank 's audit committee in 1991. </p><p> <#> Another former senior executive, Mr Jimmy O'Mahony, group head of taxation, was quoted by AIB executives as saying that the <*> pound sign </*> 100 million estimates - derived from figures which he originated - were off-the-cuff figures designed to get the attention of other managers. <#> He has also been invited to appear before the committee. </p></I><I><W2C-011$B><h> <bold> <#> Spanish judges prepare to fly to London to question Pinochet </bold> </h><bold> <#> From Rachel Donnelly, in London </bold><p> <#> THE former Chilean dictator, Gen Augusto Pinochet, remains under armed guard at a London hospital today awaiting the arrival of two Spanish judges who will question him about alleged genocide and state-sponsored terrorism during his 17-years in power.</p><p> <#> Gen Pinochet (82) was arrested on Friday night by the Metropolitan Police on an international warrant, following a request by Judge Baltasar Garz&/on and Judge Manuel Garc&/ia Castell&/on. <#> They are investigating the murder of up to 3,000 people and the disappearance of 1,000 more in Chile between 1973 and 1983. <#> The arrest warrant alleges that between September 1973 and December 1983 he <quote> "did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within the jurisdiction of the government of Spain".</quote> </p><p> <#> The Chilean government accused Britain of wrongfully arresting their former leader because, as a senator, Gen Pinochet was travelling on a diplomatic passport and could claim diplomatic immunity. <#> The Foreign Office rejected this yesterday. </p><p> <#> The Chilean president, Mr Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat, said yesterday that Spanish courts had no more right to try Gen Pinochet than Chilean judges would have to delve into crimes under the former Spanish dictator, Gen Franco. <#> His foreign minister, Mr Jos&/e Miguel Insulza, a Socialist, lodged a formal complaint with his British counterpart.</p><p> <#> But other leading members of both coalition parties in Chile said that diplomatic immunity did not protect Gen Pinochet from being questioned about crimes against humanity.</p><p> <#> The Shadow Foreign Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, said he was worried that Gen Pinochet 's arrest was not a result of normal legal procedures but had come about because of pressure from lobby groups and Labour MPs. <#> During the previous Conservative government, Gen Pinochet was a regular visitor to Britain.</p></I><I><W2C-011$C ><W2C-011$D><h> <bold> <#> Dublin street clashes between gardai and supporters of SF<#> By Jim Cusack and Maol Muire Tynan </bold> </h><p> <#> BANDSMEN taking part in a Sinn F&/ein demonstration marched through the centre of Dublin yesterday chanting <quote> "I..I..IRA".</quote> </p><p> <#> There were ugly confrontations in the city centre between garda&/i and Sinn F&/ein supporters on a number of occasions over the weekend following Sinn F&/ein Youth 's national congress in Dublin on Saturday.</p><p> <#> Garda&/i were called to Middle Abbey Street on Saturday afternoon after a large group of young men leaving the congress gathered around an unmarked Garda car and began rocking it and kicking it, garda&/i said. <#> It is believed the car contained two Special Branch officers who had been monitoring the event. </p><p> <#> Uniformed garda&/i from Store Street station came to the assistance of the two plain-clothes officers and dispersed the crowd without any arrests.</p><p> <#> According to the Garda, some people attending the congress were involved in incidents later.</p><p> <#> It is understood a disturbance broke out after two uniformed garda&/i attempting to arrest a man who was urinating in a shop doorway on O'Connell Street at around midnight, were surrounded by a crowd.</p><p> <#> More garda&/i were called from Store Street station to assist the officers in O'Connell Street. <#> Nine men, including two from Northern Ireland, were arrested and brought to the station, where they were charged with public order offences and released without surety.</p><p> <#> It is expected all will receive summonses for the offences and will appear before the District Court.</p><p> <#> After yesterday 's march through the city centre, a large group protested outside Store Street station about the arrest of the nine men. <#> Scuffles broke out between garda&/i and members of Sinn F&/ein Youth but no further arrests were made.</p><p> <#> The protestors claimed that garda&/i had harrassed Sinn F&/ein Youth members after their congress on Saturday. <#> Chanting loudly, they sat on the steps of the Garda station and scuffles followed as garda&/i set about removing them.</p><p> <#> The disturbances, however, lasted just minutes as Garda reinforcements moved in and Sinn F&/ein officials appealed for calm and urged the crowd to disperse peacefully.</p><p> <#> About 500 people marched in yesterday 's demonstration from Parnell Square to Kildare Street, and back. <#> Five flute and drum bands from Northern Ireland, three dressed in combat uniforms and black berets, took part in the demonstration and played republican party tunes.</p><p> <#> It was led by a group of recently-released IRA prisoners.</p><p> <#> The bands were among a large contingent who travelled to Dublin yesterday morning on a chartered train from Belfast.</p><p> <#> The demonstration was also attended by Sinn F&/ein figures and a delegation from the political wing of the Basque separatist organisation ETA.</p></I><I><W2C-011$E><h> <bold> <#> Dempsey presses for Budget to include a range of <quote> 'green taxation'</quote> measures </bold> </h><bold> <#> By Frank McDonald, Environment Correspondent </bold><p> <#> THE Minister for the Environment, Mr Dempsey, is pressing the Government to intorduce a range of <quote> "green taxation" </quote> measures in the Budget, including a benefit-in-kind tax on free off-street car-parking spaces in Dublin and other cities.</p><p> <#> <quote> "I am particularly concerned to support the complementary measures proposed by the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) to deal with the traffic problem and that includes taxing parking spaces as well as providing incentives for 'park-and-ride' facilities." </quote> </p><p> <#> Mr Dempsey told <it> The Irish Times </it> that he was also in favour of a carbon energy tax to help Ireland meet its commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to cap the increase in greenhouse gas emissions at 13 per cent above their 1990 levels by the year 2010.</p><p> <#> <quote> "We have to seriously engage on this issue because it 's not something that will go away," </quote> he said. <#> <quote> "And while we must keep an eye on the competitiveness and Irish industry, I 've come to the conclusion in recent months that a carbon tax is unavoidable." </quote> </p><p> <#> However, the Minister accepts that there is no possibility of taking such a radical step in time for the Budget on December 2nd. <quote> <#> "What I 'm trying to do is to work towards a greening of the tax system that would take account of our legally binding obligations."</quote> </p><p> <#> For the past three years, green taxation has been under consideration by an inter-departmental committee, which includes the Department of the Environment and the Department of finance. <#> However, little progress has been made on the issue. </p><p> <#> According to sources, the committee meets on a regular basis in the two or three months before a Budget. <#> Various ideas for reform are put forward and noted by the Department of Finance, which then says there is not enough time to do anything about implementing them. </p><p> <#> As a result, recent Budgets have contained little more than token gestures towards green taxation - such as the tax differential in the price of unleaded petrol - with little sign of movement towards a more comprehensive, environmentally-minded approach.</p><p> <#> It is understood that Mr Dempsey accepted the argument that major changes could not be made in last year 's Budget on the understanding that the issue would be seriously tackled this year. <#> But continuing procrastination by the Department of Finance has made this impossible. </p><p> <#> In recent weeks, senior officials of the Department of the Environment have detected a change in the attitude of their counterparts in Finance - not because of an conversion to environmental concerns but because they are beginning to see green taxes as a useful tool. </p><p> <#> This may be linked to the wider macro-economic pictures of the inflationary pressures that would be created it too much money it let into the economy as a result of tax breaks. <#> Thus, they may see green taxes as a mechanism to claw back some of it.</p><p> <#> It is also understood that the Revenue Commissioners have shifted their position about raising concerns over the difficulties of collecting such taxes and are planning to talk to the DTO about how fiscal measures could assist in implementing its action plan.</p><p> <#> Apart from imposing benefit-in-kind tax on off-street car-parking spaces, Mr Dempsey favours replacing the current incentives for the construction of multi-storey car-parks with a new scheme which would provide tax breaks for the provision of peripheral "park-and-ride" sites.</p><p> <#> He is also believed to be pressing for major changes in vehicle registration tax (VRT), so that a higher rate would be levied on larger, less energy-efficient cars. <#> The aim would be to <quote> "send out a signal"</quote> that the issue of green taxation was being treated seriously.</p><p> <#> In the longer term, the minister in urging his Cabinet colleagues to look at fiscal measures to support his recently unveiled national waste management plan, including the imposition of a landfill tax which would be paid by all waste producers - including households. </p><p> <#> On the issue of a carbon energy tax, Mr Dempsey believes that doing nothing is no longer possible, even though there is bound to be strong opposition from the ESB and industrial high-energy users, such as Irish Cement, as well as from other Government departments.</p><p> <#> All of these interests are making submissions on the issue as part of a consultation process on the formulation of a greenhouse gas abatement strategy for Ireland, culminating in a consultative conference involving all parties - including environmental groups - on October 28th.</p><p> <#> This conference is likely to renew the focus on environmental taxes in the context of the 13 per cent cap agreed by Mr Dempsey as part of the EU burden-sharing arrangement reached in Luxembourg last June under which each member-state must achieve a specified target.</p><p> <#> Ireland has already attracted strong criticism from EU sources over the previous Government 's decision to abolish water charges, because this is diametrically opposed to environmental principles. <#> But short of a directive from Brussels, the charges are unlikely to be reintroduced.</p></I>
