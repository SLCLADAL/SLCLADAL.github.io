<ICE-IRE:S2A-024 Enneagram talk><I><ICE-IRE:S2A-024$A> <#> I mean everybody likes a little bit of space but for the five it 's vital <#> There has to be some part of the day that 's just for the five where you know the five can spend time alone <#> Okay <#> Uhm <,> so they can be reclusive <,> generally speaking also they 're quite intellectual <,> not all fives but mostly <#> This is the type who likes to be around books as well you know <#> Knowledge again is what really they fill themselves up with <#> Any other thing <,> any other words you might think sort of <,> a head type <,> uhm <,> the observer <,> uhm this is the wise person the sage sometimes they 're called the sage as well <#> This is the type who actually makes in a sense very good counsellors and therapists because <,> they have a natural ability to <.> atta </.> to detach emotionally <#> So you can imagine that they have that ability to listen to people without becoming emotionally involved <#> And the danger for fives is that they can as I say detach maybe too much <,> you know from from the from the from their emotional life and they tend to spend most of the time up in here <,> up in their heads <#> Uhm I mean I know fives that could detach from you while actually in the room with you <,> because they just <,> they just go off and go up into their heads <#> So they can be present but not really present you know with you <#> Uhm my friend is married to uhm <,> a friend of mine 's married to <,> to her husband who was a mathematician and I always call him the invisible man because I can go into the house and I could chat away to her and actually then look over and notice that he 's been there all that time behind a newspaper or behind a book and he never says a word <#> Now and it 's not out of rudeness or being <,> you know cos he would acknowledge you when you look but it 's almost like as if he can be present in the room but that not present with us <#> So he 's already up in his head <,> uhm you know <#> Uh and as I say <,> of all the types this is the type who values spending time alone <,> and it 's <,> like you know when I came from the two world which is like <,> how could anybody possibly spend so much time on their own <,> that would nearly be <,> that would be so alien to me as a two and as an extroverted two who really loves to be around people and who gets energy from being with people <#> Well it 's the opposite for the five <#> Fives can only <,> you know <,> they measure their time because it can be draining for them <#> It 's almost like as if <,> you know too much of that <,> and they have to pull away to themselves and be on their own in order to sort of get their energy levels and to build themselves up again <#> Uhm <,> one of the guys I think I mentioned I work very closely with from Dublin is a five on the enneagram and he comes up and does weekends with us every year and like we all love him to bits and he 's a counsellor as well and uhm you know Dan would tell us that uhm he 's married <,> has three grown-up daughters and all <#> But he said like you know for example if him and his wife were going out on a Saturday you know he needs to know these things <,> he needs to know <,> what time are we leaving at and what time will we be back uhm <#> It 's almost like <,> how much time have I to spend maybe doing something that he 's not necessarily comfortable with <#> He said it 's almost as if he has had to learn in some sense social behaviour <,> not that they are anti-social but <,> like fives are not into hang-about <,> social chit-chat <,> parties where people are all ohhh <,> you know <,> fives enjoy conversations that are meaningful <,> they enjoy discussing something that means a lot to them <#> So if Dan comes away with us on a weekend he really is very social and we can all discuss enneagram which is a common sort of bind of knowledge for us <#> But he said you know <,> it is at home he 'll say to his wife now <,> she 'll say <,> now we have to go to such and such for a dinner party <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and Dan will say <,> right okay <,> what time do we leave at <,> what time will be back at <#> And and he needs to know that <,> so that he needs to know that this is <,> you know how much time and that he 'll be back whenever you know he said he will <#> And he said like when he was younger <,> you know he said his house was built and at the very top of the house he has this room that the girls call dad 's room <#> And it 's like wall-to-wall books and and <,> Dan says like if he goes out and he says a book that he really wants <,> he mightn't just buy one copy <,> he might buy two copies of that book <#> And very rarely he lends out any of his books because again <,> they 're very important to him <,> very precious to him <#> Uhm and he said though that once his children started to arrive on the scene <,> he really made a commitment to be there fully <,> as a father to his girls <,> even though the the natural pull for the five is is is is sort of being on their own <#> And uhm when we were training to teach the enneagram the biggest number training was fives and there was about eight or nine fives came from all over the world <,> and as soon as we would finish in the afternoon <,> like as soon as the day was over <,> and we would be maybe working from nine o'clock sometimes through to seven <,> the fives would continue on in the corner and they would be swapping knowledge and they would be sharing theories and they would be discussing all that had been on in the day and be quite happy to do that till all hours <,> you know because again <,> here was a common knowledge <,> shared knowledge <,> finding out more information and whatever <#> Uhm <,> again as I say the danger is that they can become maybe you know too emotionally detached uhm from their feelings and uhm and and stay too much up in their head <#> I think I said that when I had the first class in prison there was one five in the class and when we had a discussion one day around how they coped as their type with being in prison <,> he said it really didn't bother him that much because he quite liked it <,> because it was almost as if he had permission to be locked up in his room on his own <#> So and in fact he didn't like it when they had <,> you know they used to have obviously cell times where they they <,> you know where they went in and they were locked in their cells and then that was done away with <,> but he quite liked when they were locked in their cells because then it meant nobody could disturb him or come in and see him or whatever <#> So he had this absolute time alone <#> And again his cell was wall-to-wall books and he was studying law while he was in there <#> And he was very quiet in the class and generally speaking fives <,> even in the class will be quiet <,> unless you ask them a specific <,> specific question <#> And in his case <,> he could think of things even that we had discussed maybe weeks before and have a theory or have a thought on that that was generally quite profound <,> and and fives tend to <,> because they do listen very intently and they do sort of study and think about it you know <#> But uhm <,> I always remember that when Ellen Farmer <,> when I went to her weekends in Dublin <,> and she would bring up the panel of fives onto the stage <,> you know it was really interesting <,> you know how the fives operated <#> For example if she asked them a question and here 's the type again who would who finds it difficult to be put on the spot and asked something without any preparation <,> because the the worrying or the the worrying thing for the five is well what if she asks me a question and I don't know the answer <#> And that would really <,> that the five that the fives would appear stupid would be an issue for them <#> And I can remember that she had this panel of fives up and she 'd this woman on her panel who she used a <.> c </.> <,> a couple of times that I was down <#> And this woman was an M <,> an MEP in Dublin and uhm so obviously well-versed in speaking on political matters and on TV and whatever <#> And Ellen asked her a question about herself relating to her five and we all waited for five minutes and she couldn't answer <#> And you can imagine if you 're sitting in like a <,> a lecture theatre with about a hundred and fifty two hundred people and everybody 's waiting for you to speak and she couldn't answer <#> And with you know the way it 's like <,> five minutes and then everybody starts to rustle about <,> and then eventually she had to say <,> I can't answer that <#> I can't answer that without having you know given it some thought <#> You know and again <,> this is difficult for the fives you know to be spontaneous <,> to be able to sort of self-reveal can be very difficult for fives to do <#> Fives do this thing <,> what 's called <,> again it 's unconscious <,> they compartmentalise their lives <#> So for example <,> I could be the five and I could teach for example <#> So I would have my friends or I would have the people that I <,> I work with and I <,> that would be in one compartment <,> and then I would have my family <,> okay <,> and then I might be into running and I might have people that I run with <,> or whatever hobby I have <#> But like that doesn't mean <,> none of them will ever necessarily meet each other because they 're kept in some sense separate <#> And the big fear for the five is that if they all sort of got together and found out about them <,> that would be very serious for the five <#> And I have a friend who has taught the enneagram for years and years and I would do a lot of work with him when he was in Belfast and he 's now based in Dublin <#> And you know he would come up regularly every New Year 's or so and I would get a call from him <,> right <#> And he would phone me up and he would <,> or he would ring me from time to time but our conversations <,> the first thing he 'll say to me <,> it 's never how are you Frannie <#> What 's happening uh <#> No <,> he 'd say <,> did you read that Roy Keane autobiography <#> Now what would be your feeling <#> Do you think Roy Keane is this <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <#> Or else did you <,> what do you think <,> and he would name a politician <,> have you heard him lately <#> What type do you think <#> And everything he he would phone me about would be around the enneagram <#> And he would come up at New Year 's and he would ring me and say <,> what are you doing at around six o'clock <#> And I 'd say <,> well I 'm not <,> right I 'll call up and see you <#> And I know that I 'm sort of slotted in between maybe six and seven <#> So when he comes in at six o'clock <,> and we make a cup of tea and we would talk all the time but it would be around enneagram <#> And then uhm I he I could nearly tell you when he 'd starts to fidget cos I know then that he has another slot with someone else that he 's involved in with something else you know <,> so <#> And it 's not that that bothers me <#> That 's the way he is and that 's just you know the way he operates</I>
