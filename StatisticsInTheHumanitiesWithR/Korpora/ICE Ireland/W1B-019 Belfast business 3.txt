Antrim </h><h> <#> 12 May, 1994 </h><p> <#> Dear Dr Webb, <#> We exhibited at the Academic Advice Road show last week, which I believe you also attended. <#> I must say that we were surprised at the bias of academics against locally manufactured clone computers. </p><p> <#> Typical comments were <quote> "Oh we have to buy IBM/Compaq/Apple or we can only deal with companies with a <*> pound sign </*> 10 million turnover" </quote>. </p><p> <#> To be fair we have seen this attitude in some large local businesses as well. <#> But let me ask you, if you have a policy of buying American computers and thus exporting jobs who do you expect will employ your graduates? <#> We now employ seven sales and technical staff on the clone side of our business. </p><p> <#> It actually took a big American company to demonstrate that local clones do have merit over the big brands. <#> Seagate Technologies (the world 's largest producer of hard disks) gave us an order for one hundred clones when they set up their plant in L'Derry. <#> We sent six machines to their HQ in Minnesota for tests before we won this order. </p><p> <#> Clones are good value. <#> They are totally upgradeable, even to Pentium technology. <#> They can also be cheaper and easier to maintain because of the standard nature of the boards used. </p><p> <#> Please reconsider. <#> If you are interested in receiving information on our clones please let us know. </p><p> <#> Yours faithfully, <#> Daniel MacAllister </p></I><I><W1B-019$E><h> <#> 19 December 1995 </h><h> <#> Mr M P WEBB <#> 26 CRAWLEY RD. <#> BELFAST </h><p> <#> Dear Mr WEBB <#> Re: Account Number - 92675527719622 <#> Your account has been referred to this Department because your bank have failed to pay the instalment due on 10/12/95. </p><p> <#> Arrears have accrued to the extent of 218.00 and payment should be remitted within SEVEN days from the date of this letter. </p><p> <#> Failure to comply with the above may result in action being taken for the recovery of our merchandise. </p><p> <#> We must request an additional <*> pound sign </*> 25.00, being the fee incurred for the unpaid Direct Debit. </p><p> <#> Yours Sincerely <#> Jane Simpson <#> Collection Department </p></I><I><W1B-019$F><h> <#> 26th September 1994 </h><h> <#> The Director <#> QUB </h><p> <#> Dear Director, <#> Further to my letter of 31st August 1994, could you display these posters in prominent positions in your school/department;

Invitations to interested parties to submit, in writing, their views on current provision and the gaps therein, along with recommendations on how the shortfall might be addressed. <#> 2. A series of workshops/seminars bringing together the interested parties to discuss the written submissions referred to above. <#> 3. Production of a final report synthesising the outcomes of the workshops/seminars, and forming the basis for the new Northern Ireland Operational Programme. </p><p> <#> I attach a copy of the Commission 's guidelines on the new initiative and a copy of the report of the working group we established last December, drawn from existing NOW, EUROFORM <*> ampersand </*> HORIZON promoters. <#> This is a valuable document and could be a useful starting point in your deliberations on the new Operational Programme. </p><p> <#> Could I suggest you focus your attention on the following points: <#> 1. Describe what you see as the current provision in Northern Ireland for your area of interest, in terms of development of Human Resources. <#> 2. Identify what you perceive as being the short-comings of that provision, in relation to the particular groups you work with. <#> 3. Suggest ways in which the gaps identified above could be filled by imaginative and innovative programmes of training. </p><p> <#> We would like to have your written submissions by <bold> August 23 at the latest </bold>, and we will be running the workshops/seminars during the week beginning September 5. <#> I realise that this timescale is fairly tight, but the Commission 's calendar is dictating the pace of progress. </p><p> <#> A further date for your diary: <#> - November 15 <#> Formal launch of the new initiative, Balmoral Hall, Belfast. <#> This occasion will serve to celebrate the achievements of the current projects under NOW, EUROFORM and HORIZON, and also to launch formally the new Initiative on Development of Human Resources. <#> The current promoters will be offered a stand at which to display their wares, and it will be open to the public and representatives of sectoral interests, government bodies and policy makers will be invited to attend. <#> Details in due course. </p><p> <#> I hope you will take <}> <-> the the </-> <+> the </+> </}> time to made a written submission to us, as the content of the new Operational Programme will be directly influenced by the outcomes of the consultation process. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely, <#> Pat Donnelly <#> Director NI UETP <#> Encl. </p></I><I><W1B-019$J><h> <#> 22 January 1997 </h><h> <#> Dr Webb <#> 26 Crawley Rd. Belfast </h><p> <#> Dear Dr Webb <#> RE: <bold> 201 ARDMORE DRIVE BELFAST </bold> <#> We would refer to the above and previous telephone conversations. </p><p> <#> We write to advise you that we have received an offer in the amount of <*> pound sign </*> 110,000.00 subject to contract. </p><p> <#> We would ask you to confirm with the writer if you are still interested in pursuing this matter. </p><p> <#> Yours sincerely <#> <bold> MARTIN L LEWIS </bold> </p></I>
