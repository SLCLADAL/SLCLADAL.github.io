<ICE-IRE:S1A-021 Provincetown><I><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> So Daniel <,> what about Scotland<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$B> <#> It was really really good<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Did the weather hold up for you<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$B> <#> Not too bad <#> It drizzled a few days but I mean that 's expected over there <#> You know <#> It was very relaxing<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> And did you find nice places to stay<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$B> <#> Actually old sort of taverns and<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> And the wedding<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$B> <#> The wedding was great <#> Survived<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$C> <#> Delighted to be back I 'm sure<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$B> <#> Hmm<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$C> <#> Delighted to be back<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$B> <#> Oh horrible <,> absolutely horrible <&> laughter </&> <#> Words can't describe the depth of my misery<&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Oh dear<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$C> <#> Is it really that bad<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <&> laughter </&> <#> Can't describe the depths<&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$B> <#> Okay <#> Let 's talk about proportion<&> Later in conversation </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> I was in Provincetown <#> Were you never in Provincetown<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$E> <X> <#> Is that a gay suburb in </X><&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Provincetown in uhm <,> Provincetown north of Boston <#> This guy brought us there <#> Uh he was plying drink on us <#> The whole place was given over to gay people <#> Gay and lesbian people <#> And uh<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$E> <X> <#> Is it Cape Cod <,> is it Cape Cod Provincetown </X><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Yeah <#> <{> <[> Provincetown yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$E> <X> <#> <[> Oh I 've been in Provincetown </[> </{> </X><&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> It 's the sort of place where you see these guys all wearing leather gear you know and they 've chains on them <#> You see men dressed as women <#> And uhm he had arranged to meet us in this <,> like a club<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$E> <X> <#> What you </X><&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> There were four or five of us <#> We were drinking in the place and uh <,> I noticed these people walking hand-in-hand past us <#> They were similar <,> same sex <,> people walking in <#> There was music and dancing<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> I like the way you nearly said similar sex there<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> I know <&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> But the females <,> the females went off <,> females went off into one room and the males went off into another<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Really<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Yeah <#> The funny thing was<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$?> <#> <unclear> several sylls </unclear><&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> All standing looking at each other<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> And then these guys try to you know they try to get you in to<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$E> <X> <#> Discos <,> sparkly ballroom </X><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> One of the guys <,> you see we were sitting at the bar drinking and one of the guys was balding you see and he was leaning back like and this guy kissed him on the head<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Oh no<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> He was livid<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> I 'm sure he was<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> He was raging <#> So that was Provincetown <#> We got out of it fast<&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Oh God<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> And who 's this that had played the trick on you<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> It was a chap that we <,> we stayed with over there in Boston<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Right <#> There 's a lot to be said for reading your guidebook<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Hmm<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> There 's a lot to be said for reading your guidebook<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Oh there is <#> We were totally innocent <#> But it 's a well-known place actually<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$G> <#> Yeah there was somebody <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and she lived there for like six months or something as part of the community <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> And <,> the place is actually called Provincetown rather <{> <[> than the pub </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <[> It 's Provincetown </[> </{> <#> No it 's Provincetown it 's called<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Right <#> Oh I thought that <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$E> <X> <#> <unclear> several words </unclear> </X><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> It 's strange how a town like that <,> it 's strange how it 's totally devoted to this kind of thing now<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Then maybe if people don't want to be so overtly gay in in a major city because of the discrimination it 's <{> <[> maybe easier for them to go </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <[> Well that poor guy <,> </[> </{> that poor guy was killed here because of it<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> <{> <[> But I think it 's awful it has </[> to be so closet here<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> <[> You don't know that though do you </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Hmm<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> You don't know that<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> It must be though <#> They must be very sure of it because of <{> <[> the way it was </[> reported and stuff<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> <[> Aye but they can't really say </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> Yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> But because of the way the newspaper articles are written <,> I think they must <,> you know they must be fairly sure <#> But I think it 's awful that people have to be so covert here <#> I mean if you walk through Soho in London and there are men holding hands and just <,> you know <,> it 's just normal <#> People just get on with it<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Yeah but there 's a hell of a religious background here <,> <{> <[> you know that it would be <,> it 's hard to overcome </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> <[> Oh I know that <#> I know </[> </{><&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> It 's quite sad <,><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Probably a bit too close to home as well<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Aye <#> Especially for <{> <[> me </[> <#> Round the corner<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Och no but you wouldn't worry about that<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> No but at the same time it 's <,> there 's been more and more things in South Belfast <#> You know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> <{> <[> and stuff </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <[> Murders and things </[> </{> <#> Aye <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> That 's what I was saying you know about to you earlier <,> the guy in our garden last year<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> A guy in your garden<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> <[> A guy </[> </{> that was murdered and he was in our back <,> in our rear yard<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Oh I didn't realise that that was so close <{> <[> to you </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{> <#> Yeah <#> We were overlooking it cos the night <,> <{> <[> I went out to put </[> out my bins one night and he would 've been lying in <,> in the bushes<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <[> They got someone for it though </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> <&> gasp </&> <{> <[> Oh no </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> <[> Imagine </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> And I had no idea<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> That 's desperate<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Oh that 's a horrible thought<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> But they 're clearing that all out now <#> They 've diggers and everything in it <,> you know <,> to clear it except it 's really heavy vegetation and like that 's where he was found <#> But then again though <,> then the house across which is like Serpentine Avenue <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Aye and then it was burnt down<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> I can't remember <,> cos I was <,> cos I wasn't in Belfast when it happened <#> <{> <[> It was around Christmas </[> time<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <[> What was burnt down </[> </{><&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> They tried to burn the house<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> They tried to burn the house or something<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Oh right<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> But I think there was that much damage they 've knocked the house down and rebuilt it or gutted it or something<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> I always wondered what happened to that house you remember that that girl Maria McConnell was murdered in<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> <{> <[> Yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> <[> Mhm </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> I wonder were they

someone one night who lived next door and <,> you know when the whole thing had happened and they <,> they moved out <{> <[> <#> They </[> just didn't want to be there<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> <[> Yeah </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Horrible thought <,> <#> But I wonder <,> I mean <,> you 'd think that they might just have to pull the house down because who really would want to live there<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$?> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> People forget though <#> You 'd get students who would go into it <#> <{> <[> They wouldn't know </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> <[> But it 'll turn into </[> </{> you know sort of one of those things that 'll never be talked about<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> I think students would move into the house<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Yeah I think they would <#> I think <unclear> several sylls </unclear><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$G> <#> Then again just because something bad happened there doesn't necessarily <,> you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Yeah but would you want to be living in it<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> I 'm not superstitious but I would not want to live in <,> or I would not want to have as a bedroom a room where someone had been brutally murdered<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$G> <#> No I suppose<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> The <{> <[> thought of what went on in that room </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <[> Why do you believe in ghosts </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Uhm <,> well I don't not believe in ghosts <#> I don't know <#> I mean some very sensible people have told me that they 've seen ghosts <#> I hope to God I never see one <&> laughs </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> I thought I saw one one time<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Did you<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Yeah <#> It was ridiculous <#> It was probably just a trick of light <#> <{> <[> But we were sitting in </[> <,> yeah <,> in Donnybrook Street and we had an upstairs flat and<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$?> <#> <[> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Donnybrook <#> Donnybrook <,> that 's down off the Lisburn Road yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> It is yeah <,> yeah <,> uhm <,> but it had a big bay window and there was one of the chairs sort of sat facing the bay window and I never sat in that chair <#> I always sat on the sofa <#> And this one night I was sitting there <#> I never pull the curtains <#> And all the girls<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Were you sitting in the dark<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> No no <#> I was sitting watching TV <#> And all the girls were sitting there and they were all chatting away and then I looked up and looked in the window and over my right shoulder there was somebody standing behind me <#> I looked round <,> oh my God <{> <[> and then turned round and there was nothing there </[> <#> I could see it in the window but there was obviously <,> I mean it was a trick of the light<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> <[> You could see the window <#> You could see the reflection in the window </[> </{><&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> What did the person look like <#> What did the person look like<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> I don't know <#> I just know it was a figure standing behind me <#> I didn't you know I didn't look long enough to see<&> laughter </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Yeah <,> <#> It could have been somebody standing outside then<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> No cos we were on the first floor <#> You know we didn't<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> Oh right <#> Right<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> I think your mind plays tricks<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> See I always<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> I don't know about that<&> simultaneous and unclear speech </&><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Always close the curtains <#> Never look in the mirror after twelve

would you be worried<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Would you be worried <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$D> <#> They don't do any harm to anybody do they<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> What <#> Ghosts<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> I always felt better about it after uhm you know the Bruce Willis film<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> <{> <[> Oh yeah </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> <[> Sixth Sense </[> </{><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Because they were actually all<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Nice <{> <[> ghosts </[><ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> <[> They were all nice <[> </{> <#> They just were a bit

what you mean <#> They weren't these evil spirits<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$F> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> I always felt a bit better after watching that<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> I 'd be more scared of a real person than a ghost to be honest <,> you know<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$A> <#> Yeah<ICE-IRE:S1A-021$H> <#> <{> <[> If there was somebody in my
