A01   2 lobbying fails president with election in offing<p/>

A01   4 <p_>CHICAGO TRIBUNE<p/><h/>
A01   5 <p_>WASHINGTON - Despite intense White House lobbying, Congress has 
A01   6 voted to override the veto of a cable television regulation bill, 
A01   7 dealing President Bush the first veto defeat of his presidency just 
A01   8 four weeks before the election.<p/>
A01   9 <p_>Monday night, the Senate overrode the veto 74-25. the same 
A01  10 margin by which the upper house approved the bill last month and 
A01  11 comfortably above the two-thirds majority needed.<p/>
A01  12 <p_>Not one senator changed sides, a blow to Bush's prestige after 
A01  13 he had heavily lobbied Republican senators, urging them not to 
A01  14 embarrass him this close to the election.<p/>
A01  15 <p_>Both California senators, Republican John Seymour and Democrat 
A01  16 Alan Cranston, voted to sustain the veto.<p/>
A01  17 <p_>The bill was immediately sent to the House, which voted 308-114 
A01  18 for the override, 26 more than needed. A cheer went up as the House 
A01  19 vote was tallied, ending Bush's string of successful vetoes at 
A01  20 35.<p/>
A01  21 <p_>Among those voting to override in the Senate was Democratic 
A01  22 vice presidential nominee Al Gore, a co-author of the bill. He then 
A01  23 left the chamber to join Democratic presidential nominee Bill 
A01  24 Clinton on 'Larry King Live' on CNN.<p/>
A01  25 <p_>Asked whether it was a blow to Bush for the override to fall so 
A01  26 close to the election, Clinton said, <quote_>"It won't do him any 
A01  27 good."<quote/><p/>
A01  28 <p_>Bush attributed the vote to effective lobbying by the TV 
A01  29 broadcast networks on Capitol Hill.<p/>
A01  30 <p_><quote_>"I think I was right on principle,"<quote/> Bush said 
A01  31 in an interview on ABC's 'Good Morning America.'<p/>
A01  32 <p_><quote_>"I think the approach I had would have kept consumer 
A01  33 costs down. It was a battle between the networks against cable, and 
A01  34 the networks did a very good job of convincing people that their 
A01  35 approach would keep costs down."<quote/><p/>
A01  36 <p_>Of his first veto defeat, Bush said: <quote_>"We've had a good 
A01  37 streak. We won 35 straight. Lost one. Not a bad record."<quote/><p/>
A01  38 <p_>The administration, all but giving up on the House, had 
A01  39 concentrated its efforts on the Senate. Bush lobbied eight 
A01  40 Republican senators over the weekend, telephoning them from the 
A01  41 campaign trail and inviting a select group to breakfast at the 
A01  42 White House on Sunday.<p/>
A01  43 <p_>But it became apparent Monday evening that the pressure had 
A01  44 failed when, one after another, the lobbied senators voted against 
A01  45 their president. As each of their votes was announced, an 
A01  46 <quote|>"ooooh" was heard from the packed galleries.<p/>
A01  47 <p_>Some of the targeted senators had indicated they would switch 
A01  48 and support Bush, but when it became apparent the president would 
A01  49 lose, not one changed his vote - including Senate Minority Whip 
A01  50 Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who had tried to sway other senators to 
A01  51 Bush's side.<p/>
A01  52 <p_><quote_>"There was no point for those who wanted to support the 
A01  53 president to switch when he wasn't going to win anyway,"<quote/> 
A01  54 said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.<p/>
A01  55 <p_>In the House, 230 Democrats, 77 Republicans and one independent 
A01  56 voted for the bill while 29 Democrats and 85 Republicans opposed 
A01  57 it.<p/>
A01  58 <p_>The bill was passed in the Senate by 50 Democrats and 24 
A01  59 Republicans and opposed by seven Democrats and 18 Republicans.<p/>
A01  60 <p_>Many Republicans, especially those up for re-election, viewed 
A01  61 the cable television re-regulation bill, which was aimed at 
A01  62 lowering cable rates, as a boon to consumers.<p/>
A01  63 <p_>But the politics of the issue were visible. As an example, 
A01  64 Democratic leaders in the Senate allowed Republicans to control the 
A01  65 debate for and against the bill, a highly unusual move and an 
A01  66 apparent effort to show Bush at odds with members of his own 
A01  67 party.<p/>
A01  68 <p_><quote_>"This is an effort to embarrass President Bush 30 days 
A01  69 before the election,"<quote/> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
A01  70 Kansas said before the vote. <quote_>"I urge my colleagues to 
A01  71 sustain the president's veto. He hasn't asked for much."<quote/><p/>
A01  72 <p_>Bush put his reputation of governing by veto on the line in 
A01  73 urging the Senate to sustain him one last time before the 
A01  74 election.<p/>
A01  75 <p_>Some Republican senators said they had advised Bush not to sign 
A01  76 or veto the cable legislation but instead let it go into law 
A01  77 without his signature, thus avoiding the high-profile veto 
A01  78 fight.<p/>
A01  79 <p_>The cable television re-regulation bill was drafted in response 
A01  80 to consumer complaints to Congress that cable prices had risen at 
A01  81 three times the inflation rate and that many cable companies hold 
A01  82 monopolies.<p/>
A01  83 <p_>But it soon became a high<?_>-<?/>stakes fight between the 
A01  84 cable industry and over-the-air broadcasters, each using their own 
A01  85 medium to press their opposing points.<p/>
A01  86 <p_>In frequent ads, the cable industry argued that rates would 
A01  87 actually rise, not decrease, if the bill became law because of a 
A01  88 provision that requires the cable companies to reimburse 
A01  89 broadcasters for programming the cable companies now get for 
A01  90 free.<p/>
A01  91 <p_>Broadcasters and consumer groups used their airwaves to argue 
A01  92 for the bill, noting that it would limit rates for cable service, 
A01  93 require cable operators to meet customer-service standards and make 
A01  94 it easier for competing cable companies to enter the market.<p/>

A01  96 <h_><p_>Clinton follows rivals to 'talk TV'<p/>
A01  97 <p_>But few callers get through to candidate<p/>
A01  98 <p_>EXAMINER NEWS SERVICES<p/><h/>
A01  99 <p_>GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Democratic presidential candidate Bill 
A01 100 Clinton went boldly where his presidential rivals have already gone 
A01 101 - CNN's 'Larry King Live' - but callers to the show didn't get much 
A01 102 of a say in the proceedings.<p/>
A01 103 <p_>For a show billed as an opportunity for voters to question 
A01 104 Clinton and running mate Al Gore, only six callers got through as 
A01 105 King did most of the asking. One of the callers was Clinton's 
A01 106 mother, Virginia Kelley.<p/>
A01 107 <p_>President Bush appeared on the King show Sunday night - and 
A01 108 took no viewer calls. Independent candidate Ross Perot has had 
A01 109 several sessions with King, including one in February during which 
A01 110 he first said he was interested in running for president.<p/>
A01 111 <p_>Clinton and Gore made their foray into TV-talk politics after a 
A01 112 daylong bus caravan across central Florida as they tried to pad a 
A01 113 narrow lead in a state that last supported a Democrat for president 
A01 114 in 1976.<p/>
A01 115 <p_>The Democrats were wrapping up their Florida trip with a 
A01 116 morning rally at the University of Florida before heading on to 
A01 117 Nashville and another unorthodox campaign appearance - this time on 
A01 118 the 'Donahue' show.<p/>
A01 119 <p_>With the first of three presidential debates set for Sunday in 
A01 120 St. Louis, Clinton said he was eager to engage Bush. And he 
A01 121 disputed the president's assertion, made in Florida over the 
A01 122 weekend, that Bush's military service made him more qualified to be 
A01 123 commander-in-chief.<p/>
A01 124 <p_><quote_>"That's a matter of honest disagreement, but I just 
A01 125 disagree, and history indicates we have had a lot of good 
A01 126 commanders-in-chief with no military service,"<quote/> Clinton 
A01 127 said.<p/>
A01 128 <p_>Clinton also upped the ante somewhat in his rhetorical war with 
A01 129 Bush over the president's dealings with Saddam Hussein prior to the 
A01 130 Persian Gulf war, saying a special prosecutor should investigate 
A01 131 the Bush administration's favorable trade dealings with Iraq and 
A01 132 the extent to which Bush continued helping Hussein after the U.S. 
A01 133 administration learned Hussein was using agriculture credits for 
A01 134 military purposes.<p/>
A01 135 <p_>Asked by King whether there should be <quote_>"a special 
A01 136 prosecutor, special investigation,"<quote/> of the administration's 
A01 137 pre-war trade agreements with Hussein, Clinton responded, 
A01 138 <quote_>"I think there should be."<quote/><p/>
A01 139 <p_>Clinton also defended his 1970 travels, which Bush's camp has 
A01 140 insinuated were somehow connected to his alleged organization of at 
A01 141 least one anti-Vietnam War protest as a graduate student in 
A01 142 England.<p/>
A01 143 <p_>A statement by the Bush campaign, echoing a report in the 
A01 144 Washington Times Monday, charged that Clinton had <quote_>"turned 
A01 145 up in the Soviet Union ... six weeks after he helped organize a 
A01 146 massive anti-war protest in London."<quote/><p/>
A01 147 <p_><quote_>"They're pretty good at starting stuff, those guys 
A01 148 are,"<quote/> Clinton said of the Republicans.<p/>
A01 149 <p_>He said that starting in the first week of 1970 he had toured 
A01 150 Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland before spending a week in the 
A01 151 Soviet Union. He said he had returned to England via Czechoslovakia 
A01 152 during a 40-day break from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes scholar in 
A01 153 1969 and 1970.<p/>
A01 154 <p_>Newsweek magazine reported Sunday that the FBI had been called 
A01 155 to investigate after State Department officials found that several 
A01 156 pages had been ripped out of a Clinton passport file.<p/>
A01 157 <p_>Newsweek suggested that the material could have been removed or 
A01 158 destroyed by someone sympathetic to the Clinton campaign. Or, the 
A01 159 magazine speculated, a supporter of the Bush administration might 
A01 160 have taken the documents to give the appearance that incriminating 
A01 161 material had been removed.<p/>
A01 162 <p_><quote_>"I didn't even know I had a State Department file until 
A01 163 this rumor came up,"<quote/> Clinton said.<p/>
A01 164 <p_>On the campaign trail Monday, Bush attacked Clinton during 
A01 165 campaign stops in Dover, Del. Bush concentrated his fire on 
A01 166 Arkansas' poor standing among the 50 states in the death rate for 
A01 167 children under 14, the number of children in poverty and the 
A01 168 violent death rate of youngsters.<p/>
A01 169 <p_>In all those categories, Bush said the national average had 
A01 170 improved but the average in Arkansas had slipped. The president 
A01 171 accused Clinton of <quote_>"not leveling with the American 
A01 172 people"<quote/> on his dealing with the problems.<p/>
A01 173 <p_>Bush also criticized Clinton for his qualified endorsement of 
A01 174 the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, 
A01 175 Canada and Mexico, saying his opponent had wavered on the pact, 
A01 176 which will be initialed by negotiators Wednesday in Texas.<p/>
A01 177 <p_><quote_>"Once upon a time he said he was for NAFTA, the free 
A01 178 trade agreement,"<quote/> Bush told the crowd. <quote_>"Then the 
A01 179 labor bosses told him they were against it, so he said he wasn't 
A01 180 sure he was for it or against it.<p/>
A01 181 <p_>"Now he's looked at the polls, and he sees the American people 
A01 182 want NAFTA, so just yesterday he said he's for it."<quote/><p/>
A01 183 <p_>But the president said Clinton <quote_>"saddled his support 
A01 184 with all kinds of reservations and qualifications."<quote/><p/>
A01 185 <p_>Clinton endorsed the agreement Sunday but said additional steps 
A01 186 should be taken to ensure the protection of American jobs and the 
A01 187 environment as the agreement was implemented.<p/>

A01 190 <p_>Vice president's visit to S.F. raises money, ire<p/>
A01 191 <p_>By John Jacobs<p/>
A01 192 <p_>EXAMINER CHIEF POLITICAL WRITER<p/><h/>
A01 193 <p_>Like a moth to flame, Vice President Dan Quayle is drawn to 
A01 194 controversy in San Francisco.<p/>
A01 195 <p_>Last May, he unleashed a national uproar here for rebuking 
A01 196 fictional TV newscaster Murphy Brown for her decision to have a 
A01 197 baby without a husband.<p/>
A01 198 <p_>Late Monday, four weeks before the Nov.3 election, he drew 
A01 199 crowds of angry, obscenity-spouting protesters who forced him back 
A01 200 into his black Cadillac El Dorado limousine as he tried to walk 
A01 201 along Grant Avenue in Chinatown.<p/>
A01 202 <p_>Gay protesters chanting anti-Quayle slogans prompted the vice 
A01 203 president's press secretary, David Beckwith, to charge that 
A01 204 Democrat Bill Clinton <quote_>"advocated affirmative action for 
A01 205 gays."<quote/><p/>
A01 206 <p_><quote_>"It is our view,"<quote/> he said, <quote_>"they are 
A01 207 not a protected class. The only way to determine who is in that 
A01 208 class is to ask people, and we don't think that's anybody's 
A01 209 business."<quote/><p/>
A01 210 <p_>Even people in oats and ties were shouting <quote_>"four more 
A01 211 weeks"<quote/> and <quote|>"shame" as Quayle, always smiling, tried 
A01 212 to walk from St. Mary's Chinese Catholic Center, where he toured 
A01 213 several preschool classrooms, to Miriwa Restaurant. There, he 
A01 214 appeared at a fund-raising dinner for Republican Senate candidate 
A01 215 Bruce Herschensohn. Earlier in the day, Quayle appeared at a closed 
A01 216 fund-raiser for Herschensohn in Palo Alto.<p/>
A01 217 <p_><quote_>"We are going to win California - put it in the 
A01 218 bank,"<quote/> Quayle told some 400 guests at the Miriwa, about 
A01 219 half of them Asian, who paid $125 each to give the vice president a 
A01 220 warm welcome.<p/>
A01 221 <h_><p_>Angry protesters<p/><h/>
A01 222 <p_>Across the street at the Ping Yuen Housing Center on Pacific 
A01 223 Avenue, the local Clinton-Gore campaign sponsored an 'in-your-face'

A01 225 <p_><quote_>"How dare you come to Chinatown and walk through her 
A01 226 and think that's all we want from you, a photo op?"<quote/> said 
A01 227 Alicia Wong, a teacher at City College of San Francisco and a 
A01 228 member of the Democratic National Committee. <quote_>"Do you think

A01 230 community for the past 10 years? There are 7,000 children here 
A01 231 living below the poverty line. Is that a good photo op?"<quote/><p/>
A01 232 <p_>During his evening remarks, Quayle recounted his 
A01 233 <quote_>"magnificent experience"<quote/> at the preschool, but he 
A01 234 got the name wrong and called it <quote_>"St. Francis."<quote/><p/>
A01 235 <p_>Describing his <quote|>"walk" afterward, Quayle said:

A02   1 <#FROWN:A02\><h_><p_>U.S. CONGRESS RUSH TOWARD ADJOURNMENT<p/>
A02   2 <p_>Dilemma headed Bush's way<p/> 
A02   3 <p_>Senate readies to pass a tempting but tax-tainted bill<p/>
A02   4 <p_>By Michael Kranish<p/>
A02   5 <p_>BOSTON GLOBE<p/><h/>
A02   6 <p_>WASHINGTON - Just as President Bush is trying to assure voters 
A02   7 that he will not raise taxes, the Senate is putting his political 
A02   8 will power to the test by preparing to pass a bill filled with 
A02   9 programs that Bush has sought for months - but also including items 
A02  10 that might be interpreted as tax hikes.<p/>
A02  11 <p_>The bill is politically attractive to the president because it 
A02  12 includes many measures that Bush has called for, including 
A02  13 enterprise zones to revive urban and rural areas, and increased tax 
A02  14 deductibility for individual retirement accounts. Moreover, it 
A02  15 eliminates the luxury tax on boats and airplanes, as Bush has 
A02  16 requested.<p/>
A02  17 <p_>But some critics say the bill is a giveaway to special 
A02  18 interests such as boat manufacturers and real estate tax shelter 
A02  19 sales people. The $27 billion bill is such a political football 
A02  20 that Democrat Bill Clinton has decided to take no position on it 
A02  21 because it is too complicated, his spokesman said.<p/>
A02  22 <p_>If this were any other time than a month before the 
A02  23 presidential election, Bush would probably sign the bill and 
A02  24 declare a great victory. After all, on Saturday, after Bush 
A02  25 threatened to veto the legislation, Senate negotiators eliminated 
A02  26 the two major taxes in the bill, leaving only some lesser tax 
A02  27 items, some of which Bush had supported in the first place.<p/>
A02  28 <p_>The bill appears a classic example of congressional compromise, 
A02  29 not the 'gridlock Congress' that Bush has spent the year bashing 
A02  30 for refusing to enact his programs. With the elimination of most of 
A02  31 the tax hikes, some Republicans said it was tilted in Bush's favor. 
A02  32 Bush seemed aware of his dilemma Monday when he acknowledged that 
A02  33 he was not sure whether he would veto the bill.<p/>
A02  34 <p_><quote_>"I have some real reservations about part of it, but 
A02  35 the problem is they always send me something that has some of the 
A02  36 things I want, and then loaded up with, in this instance, 
A02  37 taxes,"<quote/> Bush said on ABC-TV Monday. <quote_>"So I'll have 
A02  38 to wait and see what final form it is in, because there are some 
A02  39 things in there I like and have been fighting for."<quote/><p/>
A02  40 <p_>That might seem like a natural opening for Clinton to accuse 
A02  41 the president of waffling on the bill. But the bill is so 
A02  42 politically sensitive that Clinton is avoiding the issue.<p/>
A02  43 <p_>It is also possible that Republicans will help Bush avoid the 
A02  44 issue altogether by filibustering the bill, delaying a vote until 
A02  45 after the election. But many Republicans, such as Sen. Bob Packwood 
A02  46 of Oregon, said that Bush should sign the bill because it had so 
A02  47 many elements that the president had backed.<p/>
A02  48 <h_><p_>Hard line on taxes<p/><h/>
A02  49 <p_>With Clinton remaining out of the fray, the focus is on whether 
A02  50 Bush will get in political trouble if he signs a bill that could be 
A02  51 interpreted as a tax hike.<p/>
A02  52 <p_>Bush may have put himself in a bind because, in an effort to 
A02  53 erase the memory of his broken <quote_>"no new taxes"<quote/> 
A02  54 pledge, Bush has said he will not accept new tax increases. The 
A02  55 dilemma for Bush is that the tax items in this bill are not 
A02  56 normally considered tax increases. They are mostly technical 
A02  57 measures, such as changing the way securities dealers calculate 
A02  58 their inventory to bring in more tax revenues.<p/>
A02  59 <p_>In this campaign, however, Bush has made an issue out of saying 
A02  60 that anything that brings in more money to the government is a tax 
A02  61 increase. For example, in charging that Democrat Bill Clinton has 
A02  62 raised taxes and fees 128 times as governor, Bush has said that 
A02  63 everything from the extension of a racing season to a fee for 
A02  64 mineral rights is a tax or fee.<p/> 
A02  65 <p_>If Bush now signs a bill that has several items that would 
A02  66 qualify as a tax or fee, it might undermine Bush's claims about 
A02  67 Clinton's tax record.<p/>
A02  68 
A02  69 <h_><p_>Energy bill running out of time<p/>
A02  70 <p_>Nuclear waste dump opponents stall measure in the Senate<p/>
A02  71 <p_>EXAMINER NEWS SERVICES<p/><h/>
A02  72 <p_>WASHINGTON - After nearly two years and countless compromises, 
A02  73 a long-awaited energy bill is in danger of stalling because of a 
A02  74 dispute over a proposed nuclear waste dump in Nevada - and the rush 
A02  75 by the 102nd Congress to adjourn.<p/>
A02  76 <p_>The legislation, which would boost conservation through tax 
A02  77 incentives and new efficiency standards and speed construction of 
A02  78 nuclear power plants, cleared the House on Monday by a 363-60 
A02  79 vote.<p/> 
A02  80 <p_>But it immediately ran into problems in the Senate, where 
A02  81 Nevada's two members vowed to delay the bill because of a provision 
A02  82 they said would weaken health standards for a proposed nuclear 
A02  83 waste dump at Yucca Mountain 100 miles northeast of Las Vegas.<p/>
A02  84 <p_>The bill's supporters said they still expected Senate approval 
A02  85 of the complex and sweeping energy package, which would mark the 
A02  86 first major overhaul of U.S. energy policy in more than a 
A02  87 decade.<p/>
A02  88 <p_>But with most lawmakers eager to adjourn, the Nevadans hoped a 
A02  89 delay threat might force Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., the bill's 
A02  90 manager, to abandon the Yucca Mountain provision. Early Tuesday as 
A02  91 Congress met, neither Johnston nor Nevada Democrats Richard Bryan 
A02  92 and Harry Reid had budged.<p/>
A02  93 <p_>Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that if 
A02  94 necessary he was prepared to call adjournment-minded senators back 
A02  95 on Thursday, after the Yom Kippur holiday break, to deal with the 
A02  96 bill - something few lawmakers would relish. It then would take the 
A02  97 approval of 60 members to bring the measure up for a vote.<p/>
A02  98 <p_>The bill, more than 900 pages long, touches on virtually every 
A02  99 area of U.S. energy policy, from requiring new efficiency standards 
A02 100 for lights and shower heads to making it easier to build nuclear 
A02 101 reactors.<p/>
A02 102 <p_>By voice vote, both houses approved a $250 billion defense 
A02 103 spending bill for the 12 months that began Oct. 1. It earmarks $3.8 
A02 104 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative anti-missile system; 
A02 105 Bush had asked $5.4 billion. The measure also would pay for 
A02 106 completing a fleet of 20 B-2 Stealth bombers.<p/>
A02 107 <p_>Also in the House of Representatives' bill was more than $65 
A02 108 million for refurbishing the Presidio over the next two years.<p/>
A02 109 <p_>The bill also included language that protects San Francisco 
A02 110 against legal damages caused by the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard's 
A02 111 massive hazardous waste problems.<p/>
A02 112 <p_><quote_>"This protects us from any lawsuit stemming from toxic 
A02 113 wastes,"<quote/> said San Francisco Redevelopment Agency Executive 
A02 114 Director Edward Helfeld, noting that the federal action - assuming 
A02 115 it is signed by President Bush - would remove a principal barrier 
A02 116 to conversion of the shipyard to civilian use.<p/>
A02 117 <p_>The shipyard has been discussed as a possible expansion site 
A02 118 for the UC Medical Center as well as a principal source of future 
A02 119 jobs.<p/>
A02 120 <p_>But before new uses can be developed, much public investment 
A02 121 will be needed to improve the 540-acre site's rundown systems for

A02 124 <p_>In other action:<p/>
A02 125 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/>A handful of conservative Republicans 
A02 126 killed a bill that would have lifted the federal prohibition on

A02 128 Although 85 senators had indicated support for ending the Ban, 12 
A02 129 senators who oppose abortion voted against limiting debate on the

A02 145 <h_><p_>Brazil's uncertain future<p/> 
A02 146 <p_>Democracy fragile despite orderly impeachment<p/>
A02 147 <p_>By Gary Marx<p/>
A02 148 <p_>CHICAGO TRIBUNE<p/><h/>
A02 149 <p_>BRASILIA, Brazil - The process of impeaching Brazilian 
A02 150 President Fernando Collor de Mello for corruption was smooth, quick 
A02 151 and efficient. There was no whitewash, no military coup.<p/>
A02 152 <p_>Collor - Brazil's first freely elected president in 29 years - 
A02 153 was suspended by the lower house of Congress after being accused of 
A02 154 skimming millions of dollars from a bribery and kickback scheme 
A02 155 operated by his 1989 campaign treasurer.<p/>
A02 156 <p_>And though last week's action suspends him for only 180 days, 
A02 157 until the Senate votes on whether to make impeachment final, his 
A02 158 removal has been described as a triumph of democracy - an 
A02 159 affirmation of change in a country and continent known for coups, 
A02 160 assassinations, mind-boggling corruption and government 
A02 161 ineptitude.<p/>
A02 162 <p_><quote_>"It is the first time in Brazilian history that a 
A02 163 president has been put out of power by the interplay between 
A02 164 Congress, the Supreme Court and the population, without any threat, 
A02 165 any military pressure at all,"<quote/> said Fernando Henrique 
A02 166 Cardoso, a prominent senator who was named Brazil's new foreign 
A02 167 minister. <quote_>"The significance is that democracy is 
A02 168 well-rooted in Brazilian society."<quote/><p/>
A02 169 <p_>But is democracy secure in Brazil? And what about the rest of 
A02 170 South America, where freely elected leaders govern the 10 largest 
A02 171 nations?<p/>
A02 172 <p_>In a continent with weak democratic traditions, where power is 
A02 173 still wielded by individuals, Collor's removal by constitutional 
A02 174 means demonstrates to South Americans that democracy can work.<p/>
A02 175 <p_>There were massive demonstrations demanding his removal. 
A02 176 Congress heard the voice of the people. And the president was 
A02 177 ousted.<p/>
A02 178 <p_>But Collor's removal may prove to be the exception rather than 
A02 179 the rule: While South Americans prefer democracy, in most countries 
A02 180 their elected leaders have not even begun to solve dire economic 
A02 181 and social problems - unequal distribution of land, the lack of 
A02 182 basic health care and education, a huge gap between rich and 
A02 183 poor.<p/>
A02 184 <p_>Most elected officials in South America continue to be the 
A02 185 elite, using political power for personal gain rather than to help 
A02 186 the impoverished masses. What South Americans are demanding is a 
A02 187 system of government that helps them, and there is little consensus 
A02 188 that democracy is the only answer.<p/>
A02 189 <p_><quote_>"Our democracy is fragile. We need to get the 
A02 190 population to believe that democracy is working for them... The 
A02 191 most important need in Brazil is to achieve equality,"<quote/> said 
A02 192 Jose Murilo de Carvalho, a leading political scientist.<p/>
A02 193 <p_>Democracy is most secure in Chile and Colombia, two nations 
A02 194 with long democratic traditions that have prospered in the last 
A02 195 decade. It also seems relatively stable in Argentina, primarily 
A02 196 because the memory is fresh of that nation's bloody and disastrous 
A02 197 military rule in the 1970s and early 1980s.<p/>
A02 198 <p_>But it's also because President Carlos Menem has brought 
A02 199 economic stability to Argentina after decades of hyperinflation and 
A02 200 financial insecurity. All bets are off, however, if his free-market 
A02 201 economic program collapses. A military coup is unlikely; political 
A02 202 instability is not.<p/>
A02 203 <p_>In Venezuela, few people rallied behind President Carlos Andres 
A02 204 Perez when he was nearly ousted in a military coup in February. 
A02 205 Perez, who was elected to a second term as president in 1988, has 
A02 206 carried out an ambitious free-market reform program that shows 
A02 207 signs of reversing a steep economic decline.<p/>
A02 208 <p_>Many Venezuelans believe he has lined his pockets at a time of 
A02 209 economic crisis. Most Venezuelans think their Congress is no 
A02 210 better: just a collection of thieves looting the treasury.<p/>
A02 211 <p_>The young military officers who led the coup promised an honest 
A02 212 and efficient government. It's a familiar chant, but many 
A02 213 Venezuelans believed it. The nation's last military dictatorship 
A02 214 ended in 1958, and its mercurial and strong-armed rule are a 
A02 215 distant memory.<p/>
A02 216 <p_>In Peru today, President Alberto Fujimori has a 74 percent 
A02 217 approval rating six months after suspending the constitution and 
A02 218 assuming near-dictatorial powers, up from 60 percent just before 
A02 219 Shining Path guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman was captured last 
A02 220 month.<p/>
A02 221 <p_>Since democracy was restored in Peru in 1980, poverty has 
A02 222 soared and Shining Path has spread its war across the nation. 
A02 223 Fujimori said the nation's Congress and judiciary were frustrating 
A02 224 his efforts to defeat the leftist guerrillas and reverse the 
A02 225 nation's economic decline.<p/>
A02 226 <p_>Fujimori, a political novice elected in 1990, is seen as an 
A02 227 honest and hard-working leader. But Peruvians also will turn 
A02 228 against Fujimori if the guerrilla war intensifies and the economy 
A02 229 fails to improve.<p/>

A03   1 <#FROWN:A03\><h_><p_>Bush Wants to Double Size of U.S. Economy<p/>
A03   2 <p_>By James Gerstenzang<p/>
A03   3 <p_>Los Angeles Times<p/><h/>
A03   4 <p_>Detroit - President Bush, struggling to demonstrate a 
A03   5 comprehensive plan to pull the nation out of its economic doldrums 
A03   6 while hoping to boost his re-election campaign, set a goal 
A03   7 yesterday of building a $10 trillion U.S. economy.<p/>
A03   8 <p_>If achieved, the target for post<?_>-<?/>recession growth would 
A03   9 nearly double the size of the U.S. economy - as measured by the 
A03  10 value of the goods produced in its factories and the services 
A03  11 workers offer - by the early years of the 21st century.<p/>
A03  12 <p_>In a lengthy speech that focused on the failures of the past 
A03  13 and the challenges of the future - and little on the most immediate 
A03  14 and pressing problems facing American workers - the president 
A03  15 offered no new plans or short-term solutions to ease 
A03  16 recession-induced fears over job security.<p/>
A03  17 <p_>Instead, the speech pulled together the variety of programs 
A03  18 Bush has proposed in the past to deal with such pressing problems 
A03  19 as job training, health care and education. He related them to 
A03  20 their potential effect on the U.S. economy, and tried to make a 
A03  21 case for the ever-growing links between the U.S. economy and global 
A03  22 markets.<p/>
A03  23 <p_>The speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, titled 
A03  24 <quote_>"Agenda for American Renewal,"<quote/> outlined a 
A03  25 philosophical approach that calls for cutting taxes, paying for the 
A03  26 tax cuts by reducing government spending and producing a shrunken 
A03  27 government, in the process providing incentives to a streamlined 
A03  28 business community so that it can reach the $10 trillion goal.<p/>
A03  29 <p_><quote_>"That's the direction I want to go: Tax less, spend 
A03  30 less, cut the deficit and redirect our current spending to serve 
A03  31 the interests of all Americans,"<quote/> Bush said.<p/>
A03  32 <p_>For the first time, Bush attached a specific figure to the 
A03  33 across-the-board tax cut that he says he would seek from Congress 
A03  34 if re-elected. But the 1 percent figure he cited was offered only 
A03  35 as an example of what could be achieved if all the spending cuts 
A03  36 for which he has called, valued at roughly $130 billion, were 
A03  37 approved by Congress.<p/>
A03  38 <p_><quote_>"That is an illustration because it would depend on if 
A03  39 you could get the $130 billion,"<quote/> a senior administration 
A03  40 official said, explaining that Bush's purpose in using the figure 
A03  41 was to demonstrate the sort of break taxpayers would get in return 
A03  42 for cuts in government spending.<p/>
A03  43 <p_>And in what he called <quote|>"right-sizing" government, Bush 
A03  44 said that he would cut the operating budget of the executive office 
A03  45 of the president, which includes his immediate staff of assistants 
A03  46 and secretaries and hundreds of people working in the Office of 
A03  47 Management and Budget and other executive branch agencies, by 33 
A03  48 percent if Congress - with a staff many times larger - agrees to a 
A03  49 similar percentage reduction in its operating budget.<p/>
A03  50 <p_><quote|>"And," he said, <quote_>"I'll cut the salaries of all 
A03  51 federal employees earning more than $75,000 by 5 percent. Taxpayers 
A03  52 have tightened their belts. The better-paid federal workers should 
A03  53 do the same."<quote/><p/>
A03  54 <p_>Such a cut would trim his own $200,000 salary by $10,000 a 
A03  55 year.<p/>
A03  56 <p_>Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton said that the 
A03  57 president's proposals amounted to more of the same programs that 
A03  58 have led the nation into economic decline.<p/>
A03  59 <p_><quote_>"I strongly believe we have to go beyond the failed 
A03  60 policies of this administration, beyond trickle-down economics. We 
A03  61 need real incentives to invest in this country, to educate our 
A03  62 people, to control health care costs and to compete around the 
A03  63 world,"<quote/> he said in a statement made by satellite from the 
A03  64 governor's mansion in Little Rock, Ark.<p/>
A03  65 <p_>Clinton contended that under Bush's plan, Americans with 
A03  66 incomes of more than $200,000 would get a $14,000 tax cut, while 
A03  67 those making $20,000 would get about $50.<p/>
A03  68 <p_>Despite Clinton's critique and Bush's own description of a 
A03  69 <quote_>"grand canyon"<quote/> between himself and the governor, 
A03  70 Bush's speech and an address Clinton delivered to the same 
A03  71 organization on August 21 demonstrated the degree of similarity in 
A03  72 their approaches.<p/>
A03  73 <p_>Clinton based his economic program on <quote_>"job-creating 
A03  74 investment,"<quote/> including job training, education reform, and 
A03  75 improved health care; and investing money saved from reduced 
A03  76 defense spending on new civilian technologies.<p/>
A03  77 <p_>Clinton's principal difference with Bush, as outlined in the 
A03  78 August 21 speech, is over the formation of a <quote_>"national 
A03  79 economic strategy,"<quote/> which the president labeled an 
A03  80 <quote_>"industrial policy"<quote/> that he says would give 
A03  81 government too great a role in directing the nation's 
A03  82 businesses.<p/>

A03  84 <h_><p_>House OKs President's Plan<p/>
A03  85 <p_>Family Leave Bill<p/>
A03  86 <p_>Margin isn't enough to override a Bush veto<p/>
A03  87 <p_>By Adam Clymer<p/>
A03  88 <p_>New York Times<p/><h/>
A03  89 <p_>Washington - After a debate marked by emotion, sarcasm and 
A03  90 political one-upmanship, the House yesterday passed and sent to 
A03  91 President Bush a bill that would require employers to give workers 
A03  92 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family and personal medical 
A03  93 emergencies.<p/>
A03  94 <p_>Despite a threatened veto, Democrats and some Republicans said 
A03  95 that passing the measure was essential if lawmakers believe in 
A03  96 <quote_>"family values."<quote/> But the 241-to-161 vote was far 
A03  97 short of the two-thirds majority required to override, and a White 
A03  98 House spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said she is <quote_>"confident of 
A03  99 strength to sustain a veto."<quote/><p/>
A03 100 <p_>Yesterday's action, which followed passage on a voice vote in 
A03 101 the Senate last month, was Congress' most forceful entry into the 
A03 102 presidential campaign, a measure that Democrats believe will help 
A03 103 Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton.<p/>
A03 104 <p_>He supports the bill and can be expected to say that electing 
A03 105 him is the only way to enact the legislation, which polls show is 
A03 106 very popular.<p/>
A03 107 <p_>The bill, similar to a measure that Bush vetoed in 1990, would 
A03 108 require employers of 50 or more people to allow their workers 
A03 109 unpaid leave, with health insurance kept in force, to care for a 
A03 110 sick child, parent, husband or wife, or for the workers' own 
A03 111 medical needs, such as pregnancy.<p/>
A03 112 <p_>It would not apply to employees who worked less than 25 hours a 
A03 113 week, and employers could exclude the highest-paid 10 percent of 
A03 114 their workers. About 5 percent of employers and 50 percent of all 
A03 115 employees would be covered.<p/>
A03 116 <p_>A Gallup Poll for Life magazine in the spring found that 83 
A03 117 percent of adults backed the measure and 16 percent opposed it.<p/>
A03 118 <p_>Smith said Bush opposes the bill but does not oppose family 
A03 119 leaves. She said the president thinks such leaves should be 
A03 120 negotiated between employers and workers.<p/>
A03 121 <p_>A White House aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
A03 122 the administration would prefer a system of tax credits to small 
A03 123 employers to help them finance such leaves.<p/>
A03 124 <p_>House majority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri told of 
A03 125 getting a leave from his law firm years ago to care for an 
A03 126 18-month-old son with cancer. <quote_>"For the parents whose 
A03 127 employers do not provide this benefit voluntarily, the choice 
A03 128 between keeping one's job or caring for a new child or sick family 
A03 129 member is a choice no American should have to make,"<quote/> he 
A03 130 said.<p/>
A03 131 <p_><quote_>"We believe we can honor the values of work and 
A03 132 family,"<quote/> Gephardt added. <quote_>"We can demonstrate our 
A03 133 commitment to family values by our deeds, not just by our words. We 
A03 134 can rise above the partisan differences that often justifiably 
A03 135 divide us."<quote/><p/>
A03 136 <p_>But Representative Robert Michel of Illinois, the Republican 
A03 137 leader in the House, contended that the bill dealt with neither 
A03 138 family values nor labor issues. <quote_>"This bill is only about 
A03 139 one thing: election-year politics, pure and simple - or at least 
A03 140 simple."<quote/><p/>
A03 141 <p_>If the Democrats really care about the measure, Michel asked, 
A03 142 why did they wait until now to bring it to the House floor. It was 
A03 143 passed in both houses last fall and a compromise had been reached 
A03 144 in August.<p/>
A03 145 <p_>Most Republicans contend that the bill will hurt employers and 
A03 146 thus cost jobs.<p/>
A03 147 <p_>Representative Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., called the requirement 
A03 148 <quote_>"just one more burden placed on small businesses struggling 
A03 149 to survive."<quote/><p/>
A03 150 <p_>Some Republicans disagreed. Representative Marge Roukema of New 
A03 151 Jersey, for instance, said there was <quote_>"not one shred of 
A03 152 evidence that this will be costly to business."<quote/><p/>
A03 153 <p_>And Representative Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said: <quote_>"A woman 
A03 154 should not have to choose between having a baby and keeping a job. 
A03 155 It would be one less thing to worry about for a woman who is 
A03 156 pregnant or a father whose child is sick. Family values require you 
A03 157 to support this bill."<quote/><p/>
A03 158 <p_>But in the end, only 37 Republicans voted for the bill, and 119 
A03 159 opposed it and 10 did not vote. Two hundred and three Democrats 
A03 160 voted for it, 42 voted no and 22 did not vote.<p/>

A03 163 <p_>New York Times<p/><h/>
A03 164 <p_>Tokyo<p/>
A03 165 <p_>President Boris Yeltsin's sudden cancellation of his trip to 
A03 166 Japan unleashed an unusual round of recriminations as the Japanese 
A03 167 government was accused of pressing an embattled Russian leader so 
A03 168 hard on its territorial claims that it lost its best chance in 
A03 169 decades to improve relations with Moscow.<p/>
A03 170 <p_>Although it remained possible for Russia and Japan to work out 
A03 171 a cooperative relationship on some levels, Prime Minister Kiichi 
A03 172 Miyazawa left little doubt yesterday that he thought that a 
A03 173 resolution of the long-standing territorial dispute with Russia is 
A03 174 years away. The issue concerns a handful of islands in the Kurile 
A03 175 chain north of Japan that were seized by the Soviet Union in the 
A03 176 closing days of World War II.<p/>
A03 177 <p_><quote_>"Let's wait patiently,"<quote/> Miyazawa told reporters 
A03 178 yesterday morning, adding that <quote_>"we won't make any 
A03 179 approaches"<quote/> to revive talks on the issue any time soon.<p/>
A03 180 <p_>Japan has demanded the return of the islands, or at least 
A03 181 recognition of Japanese sovereignty over them, as a prerequisite to 
A03 182 improving relations with Moscow and considering large-scale 
A03 183 economic aid and investment.<p/>
A03 184 <p_>The country's elite seems to be sharply divided between those 
A03 185 who say that a geographically small, resource-poor nation must 
A03 186 never give up an inch and those who argue that Japan is rich enough 
A03 187 to afford placing the issue on hold until Russia is stable.<p/>
A03 188 <p_>The unusual criticism of Japan's hard-line approach came from 
A03 189 the governor of Hokkaido, the Japanese territory closest to the 
A03 190 disputed region, who told reporters that Japan had <quote_>"aimed 
A03 191 to gain 100 points and eventually got zero."<quote/> Because of 
A03 192 Hokkaido's proximity to Russia, popular sentiment there has favored 
A03 193 a compromise on the territorial issue as a means to improve 
A03 194 economic ties.<p/>
A03 195 <p_>Business officials, who have been critical of the Japanese 
A03 196 Foreign Ministry's preoccupation with the islands, said yesterday 
A03 197 that they feared that the trip's cancellation would doom any chance 
A03 198 for Japan to make major investments in the Russian Far East for 
A03 199 years.<p/>
A03 200 <p_>Moreover, diplomats speculated that Japan would increasingly 
A03 201 find itself in conflict with its Western allies over Russian 
A03 202 policy. Although the United States supports Japan's position, 
A03 203 Germany and other nations have grown testy about Japan's continued 
A03 204 refusal to shoulder much of the aid burden for Russia.<p/>
A03 205 <p_>In a rare split on a major national foreign policy initiative, 
A03 206 there were also widespread charges yesterday that Tokyo had 
A03 207 unwisely allowed latent nationalistic instincts to prevail in its 
A03 208 dealings with a longtime rival.<p/>
A03 209 <p_>Critics claimed that Japan's leaders pushed the embattled 
A03 210 Russian president too far, wildly misjudged the depth of public 
A03 211 sentiment in Moscow and ultimately set their own cause back by 
A03 212 years.<p/>
A03 213 <p_><quote_>"This is the clearest case of the Japanese government 
A03 214 still being trapped in its Cold War thinking,"<quote/> said Haruki 
A03 215 Wada, a professor of Russian history at the University of Tokyo.<p/>
A03 216 <p_><quote_>"Everyone was so intent on exploiting the moment that 
A03 217 no one stopped to listen to the Russians,"<quote/> he said - or to 
A03 218 seriously consider arguments that funneling large<?_>-<?/>scale aid 
A03 219 to Russia should take priority over the reacquisition of a group of 
A03 220 ice-encrusted volcanic islands.<p/>

A03 225 <p_>Moscow<p/>
A03 226 <p_>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, one day after scrapping a 
A03 227 visit to Japan, approved a doubling of Russia's subsidized oil 
A03 228 prices, indicating that he is more willing to expend political

A03 230 policy ventures.<p/>
A03 231 <p_>The higher oil prices, which a deputy prime minister said will 
A03 232 take effect soon, are needed to bring in dollars and encourage 
A03 233 investment in Russia's vital but aging oil industry, officials 
A03 234 said. But the higher prices also will deal another blow to the 
A03 235 nation's already battered consumers, farmers and factories.<p/>

A04   7 <p_>TOKYO- One day after Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
A04   8 abruptly canceled his impending visit to Japan, Prime Minister 
A04   9 Kiichi Miyazawa and other officials scrambled Thursday to put the

A04  17 <p_>The pleas came as the Russian press began blaming Japan's

A04  20 outside the Japanese Embassy in Moscow for what was supposed to be 
A04  21 a massive anti-Japanese protest- and half of those present were 
A04  22 journalists.<p/>
A04  23 <p_>Watanabe also announced that Japan would not renege on any of 
A04  24 its international aid pledges to Russia. Tokyo has promised $100 
A04  25 million in humanitarian aid and cooperation for the safety of 
A04  26 Russia's nuclear power plants, part of a $24-billion package 
A04  27 offered by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations earlier this 
A04  28 year to help the former Soviet Union pull out of its economic 
A04  29 crisis.<p/>
A04  30 <p_>But the Japanese press reported Thursday that Russia had been 
A04  31 seeking a whopping $50-billion package of long-term aid from Japan, 
A04  32 a request categorically turned down by officials here as long as 
A04  33 there is no progress in settling the dispute over four small 
A04  34 islands seized by the Red Army at the close of World War II. The 
A04  35 islands, at the southern end of the Kuril chain, are off Japan's 
A04  36 northernmost main island, Hokkaido.<p/>
A04  37 <p_>Yeltsin's sudden action, coming just three days before his 
A04  38 scheduled arrival in Tokyo on Sunday, is almost without precedent 
A04  39 in Japan's modern diplomatic history, and it included a snub of the 
A04  40 imperial family, which had planned a welcome party.<p/>
A04  41 <p_>While most officials kept to low-key utterances of 
A04  42 <quote|>"regret," public anger and frustration has also emerged 
A04  43 over what is being dubbed here the <quote_>"postponement 
A04  44 shock."<quote/><p/>
A04  45 <p_><quote_>"This is childish diplomacy,"<quote/> fumed one 
A04  46 high-level Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be 
A04  47 identified by name. The official said that the postponement has 
A04  48 shattered Tokyo's trust in Moscow and that any Russian 
A04  49 pronouncements will be taken with even more skepticism in the 
A04  50 future.<p/>
A04  51 <p_>Junichi Takemi, chairman of a ceramics firm, said it is just as 
A04  52 well that Yeltsin will not come, because investing in Russia is 
A04  53 like <quote_>"throwing money down a sewer."<quote/><p/>
A04  54 <p_>The Russians were criticized here for everything from having 
A04  55 the gall to inform South Korean President Roh Tae Woo before 
A04  56 telling Miyazawa- Yeltsin had been scheduled to go to Seoul after 
A04  57 visiting Japan- to damaging local merchants, to wasting the efforts 
A04  58 that thousands of workers put into preparing for the state 
A04  59 visit.<p/>
A04  60 <p_>Members of the National Police Agency, which had completed 
A04  61 elaborate security arrangements involving 12,000 officers, took the 
A04  62 news in <quote|>"open-mouthed" amazement, according to local press 
A04  63 reports. They were particularly irked about having to comply with 
A04  64 Russia's fussy demands for security at a sumo wrestling hall, which 
A04  65 entailed building a bulletproof shield around the entire ring- only 
A04  66 to see it go to waste.<p/>
A04  67 <p_>The New Otani Hotel, where most of the Russian delegation would 
A04  68 have stayed, suddenly found itself with about 70% of its rooms 
A04  69 vacant for four days.<p/>
A04  70 <p_>And the emperor's family had to call off plans for a welcome 
A04  71 party of 70 guests and a menu specially planned to accommodate 
A04  72 Yeltsin's tastes: grilled fish, cold smoked chicken, lamb roast and 
A04  73 an ice cream dessert arranged in the shape of Mt. Fuji.<p/>
A04  74 <p_>However, public criticism of Japan's hard-line diplomacy also 
A04  75 began to surface. Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi, whose 
A04  76 prefecture in northern Japan has begun building trade links with 
A04  77 the Soviet Far East, criticized officials for pushing too hard on 
A04  78 the issue of the Northern Territories, as the islands are referred 
A04  79 to in Japan.<p/>
A04  80 <p_><quote_>"The government aimed for 100 and ended up with 
A04  81 zero,"<quote/> Yokomichi said.<p/>
A04  82 <p_>Gregory Clark, a professor of political science at Sophia 
A04  83 University in Tokyo and a former Australian diplomat, called 
A04  84 Japan's diplomacy over the territorial issue <quote|>"lousy." To 
A04  85 cling tenaciously to all claims of territory is not in keeping with 
A04  86 international practice, he said, citing as an example Poland's 
A04  87 retention of its World War II territorial gains from Germany.<p/>
A04  88 <p_>Others criticized Tokyo's insistence on linking large-scale 
A04  89 economic aid to a territorial resolution. But a top Japanese 
A04  90 official revealed Thursday that the Miyazawa administration views 
A04  91 the linkage as crucial for its political survival.<p/>
A04  92 <p_><quote_>"If I do not get economic aid separated from the 
A04  93 territorial issue, I will not be able to remain in office,"<quote/> 
A04  94 the government official quoted Yeltsin as telling Watanabe when the 
A04  95 two men met recently in Moscow.<p/>
A04  96 <p_><quote_>"[If Japan] began full-scale aid without progress on 
A04  97 the territorial issue, the Miyazawa administration would not 
A04  98 last,"<quote/> Watanabe reportedly responded.<p/>
A04  99 <p_>Still, the postponement is seen as a setback in the prime 
A04 100 minister's attempt to forge a more assertive foreign policy, which 
A04 101 includes such unprecedented actions as the emperor's scheduled 
A04 102 visit to China later this year and the dispatch of peacekeeping 
A04 103 troops to Cambodia- Tokyo's first overseas military mission since 
A04 104 World War II.<p/>
A04 105 <p_>In Moscow, Sergei Skvortsov, co-chairman of the Russian 
A04 106 Committee for the Defense of the Kurils, handed a letter to a 
A04 107 Japanese diplomat protesting Japan's demand for the islands' return 
A04 108 and the way the Japanese media cover the issue.<p/>
A04 109 <p_><quote_>"I'm glad Boris Yeltsin has called off his visit to 
A04 110 Japan, because I think that postwar borders must not be

A04 114 <h_><p_>Europe Holds Its Breath as France Prepares to Vote on 
A04 115 Unity<p/>
A04 116 <p_>By JOEL HAVEMANN<p/>
A04 117 <p_>TIMES STAFF WRITER<p/><h/>
A04 118 <p_>BRUSSELS- The European Community's far-reaching treaty on 
A04 119 political and economic union, which Danish voters narrowly rejected 
A04 120 in June, is growing increasingly unpopular throughout the 12-nation 
A04 121 EC.<p/>
A04 122 <p_>France, which with Germany is one of the EC's original twin 
A04 123 pillars, could effectively bury the treaty in a Sept. 20 referendum 
A04 124 that, according to the polls, could go either way.<p/>
A04 125 <p_>And even if French voters ratify the treaty, mounting 
A04 126 opposition elsewhere will make its goals- including a common EC 
A04 127 currency and mechanisms for setting joint European foreign and 
A04 128 security policy- difficult to achieve in practice.<p/>
A04 129 <p_>France is the last EC country to conduct a referendum on the 
A04 130 treaty, which has been ratified by voters in Ireland and 
A04 131 parliaments in Greece and Luxembourg. Elsewhere, national 
A04 132 parliaments hold the power, and all are expected to ratify if the 
A04 133 French vote 'yes.'<p/>
A04 134 <p_>But if voters had the chance, they might well turn thumbs down 
A04 135 in Germany and Britain.<p/>
A04 136 <p_>Germans are alarmed over the prospect of abandoning the 
A04 137 deutschemark, Europe's strongest currency and a symbol of Germany's 
A04 138 postwar economic success, in favor of a currency that they might 
A04 139 have to share with such economic emergency-room cases as Italy.<p/>
A04 140 <p_>And the insular British worry that the treaty would give the 
A04 141 EC's bureaucrats license, as their foreign secretary once charged, 
A04 142 to meddle in <quote_>"the nooks and crannies"<quote/> of British 
A04 143 affairs.<p/>
A04 144 <p_>To Martin Bangemann, the ranking German official at the EC 
A04 145 Commission, the growing doubts about the treaty reveal the danger 
A04 146 of popular referendums. <quote_>"People are using arguments without 
A04 147 knowing"<quote/> what the treaty would do, he told reporters 
A04 148 recently at the EC Commission's Brussels headquarters.<p/>
A04 149 <p_>Others draw the opposite conclusion. Voter skepticism, they 
A04 150 argue, demonstrates that Europe's leaders forgot to marshal public 
A04 151 opinion behind them when they initialed the treaty behind closed 
A04 152 doors last December in the Dutch town of Maastricht.<p/>
A04 153 <p_><quote_>"The trouble is the arrogance of our leaders in 
A04 154 believing that the public doesn't need to know what the treaty says 
A04 155 and couldn't understand anyway,"<quote/> said Stanley Crossick, 
A04 156 chairman of the Belmont European Policy Center. <quote_>"We need to 
A04 157 be more democratic, something you Americans understand."<quote/><p/>
A04 158 <p_>Throughout the EC, Europeans are sounding alarms that the 
A04 159 Maastricht treaty, by shifting more authority from national 
A04 160 capitals to Brussels, would erode national identities.<p/>
A04 161 <p_>It is a charge the treaty supporters such as British Prime 
A04 162 Minister John Major dismiss as a <quote|>"phantom." In a speech 
A04 163 Monday, Major said, <quote_>"Whatever happens in the Community, the 
A04 164 French will be no less French, the Germans no less German, the 
A04 165 Danes no less Danish and, I promise you, the British no less 
A04 166 British."<quote/><p/>
A04 167 <p_>Also working against the treaty are anemic national economies. 
A04 168 After booming since the mid-1980s, the EC predicts overall economic 
A04 169 growth of only 1.25% this year and 1.5% next year, with 
A04 170 unemployment rising from 9.7% now to 10%. Voters are typically less 
A04 171 likely to endorse the sorts of changes envisaged by the Maastricht 
A04 172 treaty when they feel their own welfare is insecure.<p/>
A04 173 <p_>What's more, the EC's inability to stop the bloodshed on its 
A04 174 doorstep in the Yugoslav crisis has made Europeans wonder whether 
A04 175 the EC is ready for the common foreign policy-making mechanisms 
A04 176 that the Maastricht treaty would establish.<p/>
A04 177 <p_>In an EC-wide survey conducted in June, London's Market & 
A04 178 Opinion Research International found substantial dissatisfaction 
A04 179 with key elements of the treaty.<p/>
A04 180 <p_>A majority of respondents in Britain and Germany opposed 
A04 181 abandoning the British pound and the German mark in favor of a 
A04 182 common European currency. The treaty establishes a common currency 
A04 183 no later than 1999 for nations with low inflation and manageable 
A04 184 budget deficits, although the British Parliament retains the right 
A04 185 to reject the common currency.<p/>
A04 186 <p_>Likewise, more respondents in half of the 12 EC countries- 
A04 187 France, Germany, Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg- 
A04 188 said the treaty would make them personally worse off than better 
A04 189 off. This reflects the EC policy, which would be accelerated by the 
A04 190 Maastricht treaty, of transferring funds from the richer nations to 
A04 191 Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.<p/>
A04 192 <p_>Doubts about the treaty probably matter most in Germany, the 
A04 193 EC's biggest member and its economic powerhouse. In Germany, the 
A04 194 future of the deutschemark is the overriding issue.<p/>
A04 195 <p_><quote_>"The people are very proud of this symbol of national 
A04 196 strength and postwar achievement,"<quote/> said Jochen Hansen, a 
A04 197 researcher with Germany's Allensbach Institute. <quote_>"They can't 
A04 198 understand why they should give up their currency in the absence of 
A04 199 an urgent need."<quote/><p/>
A04 200 <p_>Hansen said he thought Germans would probably turn down the 
A04 201 Maastricht treaty, if- as is impossible under the German 
A04 202 constitution- they had a chance to vote on ratifying it. Recent 
A04 203 Allensbach public opinion surveys bolster this view.<p/>
A04 204 <p_>By 41% to 25%, Germans said in June that the government should 
A04 205 have rejected the treaty's provision for a common European 
A04 206 currency. By 34% to 26%, they expressed satisfaction that Danish 
A04 207 voters had refused to ratify.<p/>
A04 208 <p_>And last January, a month after Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
A04 209 initialed the Maastricht treaty, fully 39% of Germans said they 
A04 210 feared a gradual loss of German identity in a homogeneous Europe. 
A04 211 Fifteen months earlier, in October,1990, only 21% had expressed 
A04 212 such a concern.<p/>
A04 213 <p_>Britain is the other EC powerhouse where public sentiment 
A04 214 toward the Maastricht treaty is, at best, uncertain. A Gallup Poll 
A04 215 in June found the public almost evenly split, with 38% saying they 
A04 216 would vote for the treaty and 35% saying they would vote 'no.' A 
A04 217 majority, 51%, said European integration was proceeding too 
A04 218 quickly, against 25% who said the pace was right and 14% who called 
A04 219 it too slow.<p/>
A04 220 <p_>Prime Minister Major, who pulled the treaty back from 
A04 221 Parliament pending the outcome of the French referendum, admitted 
A04 222 Monday that the treaty probably faces a <quote_>"bruising 
A04 223 passage."<quote/> But he rejected calls for a referendum, arguing 
A04 224 that many voters would probably base their decisions on matters 
A04 225 unrelated to the treaty.<p/>
A04 226 <p_>Meanwhile, in tiny Denmark, where the treaty's troubles began, 
A04 227 sentiment against it seems to be hardening. Recent polls show that 
A04 228 the treaty's opponents- a bare 50.7% of those who voted in the June 
A04 229 2 referendum- have grown to as much as 57%.<p/>
A04 230 <p_>That puts the Danish government on the spot. Under EC rules, 
A04 231 the treaty cannot take effect until it is ratified by all 12 member 
A04 232 nations.<p/>
A04 233 <p_>If Denmark will not accept the treaty as negotiated last 
A04 234 December, either the treaty will have to be changed- which would 
A04 235 require a complicated renegotiation followed by another round of 
A04 236 ratification votes in all EC countries- or Denmark will have to 
A04 237 finesse its voters' opposition.<p/>

A05   5 <p_>ANSONIA, Conn. - Plagued by high unemployment and a weak 
A05   6 election-year economy, President Bush on Monday proposed a 
A05   7 $2-billion-a-year package of new and retooled job-training programs 
A05   8 and said they could be paid for without raising taxes.<p/>
A05   9 <p_><quote_>"We can get everybody engaged in high-tech jobs with 
A05  10 this retraining approach,"<quote/> Bush promised at a campaign stop 
A05  11 at a vocational training school in Union, N.J.<p/>
A05  12 <p_>The plan's centerpiece calls for $3,000 vouchers for adults to 
A05  13 use for retraining at trade schools or community colleges. These 
A05  14 would go to people who had lost their jobs, been notified their

A05  17 <p_>Bush said the plan's $10-billion cost over five years would be

A05  20 <p_>At a news conference in Little Rock, Ark., Democratic

A05  36 <p_>Associated Press<p/><h/>
A05  37 <p_>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Former Democratic rival Paul Tsongas stood 
A05  38 at Bill Clinton's side Monday and attacked President Bush's 
A05  39 economic plan, saying it would guarantee <quote_>"four more years 
A05  40 of gridlock"<quote/> in Washington.<p/>
A05  41 <p_>But while Tsongas called Clinton's plan superior to Bush's, he 
A05  42 still did not strongly embrace it.<p/>
A05  43 <p_>Tsongas said that Clinton's policies <quote_>"have evolved in a 
A05  44 direction that I think is positive"<quote/> and that he would 
A05  45 <quote_>"work with Gov. Clinton and press my views upon the people

A05  47 saying Clinton's program didn't go far enough, Clinton chimed in, 
A05  48 <quote_>"That's a way of saying it."<quote/><p/>
A05  49 <p_>During the Democratic primary season, Tsongas was critical of 
A05  50 Clinton's economic proposals, which included a sweeping tax cut for 
A05  51 the middle class.<p/>
A05  52 <p_>In Monday's appearance with Clinton on the lawn of the Arkansas

A05  66 <h_><p_>Israel's Rabin says 11 Palestinians won't be deported<p/>
A05  67 <p_>Associated Press<p/><h/>
A05  68 <p_>JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday canceled 
A05  69 deportation orders against 11 Palestinians in a further effort by 
A05  70 his moderate government to bolster the peace talks opening in 
A05  71 Washington.<p/>
A05  72 <p_>That follows an announcement Sunday that 800 Palestinian 
A05  73 prisoners would be freed, that Arab access from the occupied 
A05  74 territories to Israel would be eased and that some punishments 
A05  75 imposed for anti-Israeli violence would be lifted.<p/>
A05  76 <p_>The deportation orders were issued by former Prime Minister 
A05  77 Yitzhak Shamir in January before a round of peace talks. Shamir 
A05  78 lost the June 23 election to Rabin. Rabin's reversal of the orders 
A05  79 came with his government's debut in the talks Monday, signaling a 
A05  80 radical change of approach.<p/>
A05  81 <p_>The 11 West Bank and Gaza Strip Arabs had been ordered out for 
A05  82 allegedly fomenting the violence that had killed four Israelis in 
A05  83 the preceding three months. Their appeals are now before the 
A05  84 Israeli Supreme Court.<p/>
A05  85 <p_>A statement by Rabin in his capacity as defense minister said 
A05  86 that circumstances had changed since the expulsion orders were 
A05  87 issued.<p/>
A05  88 <p_>He apparently was referring to the decline of anti-Israeli 
A05  89 unrest in the occupied territories and the divisions between

A05  95 <p_>WASHINGTON - Defense officials said Monday the U.S. military 
A05  96 was ready to enforce a ban on Iraqi military flights over southern 
A05  97 Iraq, but diplomats in the Persian Gulf said the plan was being 
A05  98 held up by Arab concerns that it could dismember Iraq.<p/>
A05  99 <p_>The announcement that U.S., British and French planes would 
A05 100 begin enforcing the no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel to 
A05 101 protect dissident Shiite Moslems had been slated for today, 
A05 102 <quote_>"but that may not be the case now,"<quote/> said an

A05 104 <p_>Defense officials, who asked not to be identified, said in 
A05 105 Washington that the aircraft carrier <tf_>Independence<tf/>, 
A05 106 carrying fighter and reconnaissance planes, headed north from Abu 
A05 107 Dhabi in the Persian Gulf on Sunday. Air Force fighters were also 
A05 108 in position in the region, they said.<p/>
A05 109 <p_>The U.S.-led alliance, which drove Iraqi President Saddam 
A05 110 Hussein's forces from Kuwait in last year's gulf war, already is 
A05 111 enforcing a no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq to 
A05 112 protect Kurds there from Iraqi attacks.<p/>
A05 113 <p_>Western diplomats said more time was needed for gulf war allies 
A05 114 to consult among themselves and for the United States, Britain and 
A05 115 France to reassure Arab states they do not intend to divide 
A05 116 Iraq.<p/>
A05 117 <p_>So far, Kuwait is the only Arab state to openly declare its

A05 177 <p_>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina - In a blaze of mortar, grenade 
A05 178 and machine-gun fire, government troops on Sunday launched a new 
A05 179 offensive to break the Serb siege of Sarajevo.<p/>
A05 180 <p_>Casualties were heavy in shelling downtown and on the west side 
A05 181 of the city, where government forces were trying to reach 
A05 182 Sarajevo's airport, now under U.N. control for an international aid 
A05 183 airlift.<p/>
A05 184 <p_>U.N. peacekeepers closed the airport to aid flights after 
A05 185 shells hit the runway.<p/>
A05 186 <p_>Dr. Arif Smajkic, head of the Bosnian Ministry of Health, said 
A05 187 46 people were killed and 303 wounded in the previous 24 hours of 
A05 188 fighting in Bosnia, including 22 dead and 100 wounded in 
A05 189 Sarajevo.<p/>
A05 190 <p_>Smajkic said the city's main hospital had no water or 
A05 191 electricity. Many wounded, mostly soldiers with serious wounds, 
A05 192 were being brought in. <quote_>"It is very critical at this 
A05 193 moment,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"We need water for operations, 
A05 194 and we don't have any."<quote/><p/>
A05 195 <p_>The offensive appeared to be a last-ditch attempt by Bosnian 
A05 196 defenders to gain a military advantage before a peace conference on 
A05 197 Yugoslavia begins Wednesday in London.<p/>
A05 198 <p_>The republic's Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, told 
A05 199 reporters that his forces had made headway on the west side, but 
A05 200 government military officials gave mixed signals.<p/>
A05 201 <p_>Izetbegovic said that even if the new offensive failed, his 
A05 202 forces would fight on. <quote_>"Sarajevo shall survive,"<quote/> he 
A05 203 said. <quote_>"We shall fight many, many months more."<quote/><p/>
A05 204 <p_>Bosnia's ethnic Serbs, who want to remain part of 
A05 205 Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, rebelled after the republic's majority 
A05 206 Croats and Muslims voted for independence on Feb. 29. Serbs now 
A05 207 control two-thirds of Bosnia-Herzegovina.<p/>
A05 208 <p_>At least 8,000 people have been killed, but recent estimates by 
A05 209 U.S. Senate investigators put the total at up to 35,000. About 
A05 210 1.3-million people have become refugees, many in 'ethnic cleansing' 
A05 211 campaigns to empty regions of unwanted ethnic groups.<p/>
A05 212 <p_>Throughout Saturday night and Sunday, explosions and heavy 
A05 213 machine-gun fire could be heard throughout Sarajevo. Shells landed 
A05 214 near the main Kosevo hospital in the city center, around government 
A05 215 offices and on the west side.<p/>
A05 216 <p_>A mortar crashed into the second floor of a student hostel in 
A05 217 the old city, killing at least two people and wounding several 
A05 218 others.<p/>
A05 219 <p_>One victim remained alive for several minutes after both legs 
A05 220 were cut off by a falling wall. His screams faded into deathly 
A05 221 quiet, perspiration covering his face, and he was dead by the time 
A05 222 he was taken to a hospital.<p/>
A05 223 <p_>One government soldier with gaping stomach and chest wounds 
A05 224 arrived at the hospital in a U.N. armored personnel carrier manned 
A05 225 by French soldiers, who said Serb forces allowed them to cross

A05 230 <p_>CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y. - Bill Clinton said Sunday that President Bush 
A05 231 invoked a <quote_>"deeply offensive"<quote/> political ploy in 
A05 232 questioning Democrats' commitment to God and said Republicans 
A05 233 should be ashamed of their <quote_>"off the wall"<quote/> attack 
A05 234 linking his values to Woody Allen's.<p/>
A05 235 <p_>Clinton, counterattacking as he and running mate Al Gore

A05 237 floundering because Democrats had a superior economic plan to put 
A05 238 Americans back to work and help raise their children.<p/>
A05 239 <p_>Bush, seeking to shore up Republican strength in the key 
A05 240 Midwest battleground, told a cheering crowd at the Illinois State

A05 242 will rubber stamp this spendthrift Congress.<p/>
A05 243 <p_>"We're not going to let that nightmare happen,"<quote/> Bush

A06   4 <p_>USA TODAY<p/>
A06   5 <p_>Contributing: Debbie Howlett<p/><h/>
A06   6 <p_>One year ago this weekend, Bill Clinton officially began his 
A06   7 presidential quest.<p/>
A06   8 <p_>Back then, President Bush's grip on a second term was still 
A06   9 considered secure.<p/>
A06  10 <p_>But both candidates have been buffeted by the turbulence of a 
A06  11 political year that Bush labeled - in what turned out to be an 
A06  12 understatement - <quote|>"weird."<p/>
A06  13 <p_>And now, just when the campaign was supposed to jell, it has 
A06  14 been re-created. The accumulated rhetoric and drama of those 12 
A06  15 months might not count. What might matter most is what happens 
A06  16 next.<p/>
A06  17 <p_>There will be four debates in nine days, starting Sunday in St. 
A06  18 Louis. Ross Perot is back and will probably share the stage with 
A06  19 Clinton and Bush for three presidential face-offs, adding who knows 
A06  20 what new variables to the equation.<p/>
A06  21 <p_><quote_>"We always thought Perot getting in would throw all the 
A06  22 cards up in the air and cause people to take a new look at the 
A06  23 race,"<quote/> says Charles Black, senior adviser to Bush's 
A06  24 campaign. <quote_>"Combine that with four debates and all bets are 
A06  25 off."<quote/><p/>
A06  26 <p_>Adds Democratic consultant Duane Garrett: <quote_>"This is 
A06  27 probably going to be the potentially most volatile period since the 
A06  28 Democratic convention"<quote/> when Perot dropped out.<p/>
A06  29 <p_>The campaign might be reinventing itself or the new wrinkles 
A06  30 just might be <quote|>"weird" distractions that won't halt 
A06  31 Clinton's victory march.<p/>
A06  32 <p_>The Bush campaign has ample reason to hope all that has gone 
A06  33 before has been erased: With Clinton holding a double<?_>-<?/>digit 
A06  34 lead, the president's last best chance may be a surge borne of 
A06  35 political chaos.<p/>
A06  36 <p_>But polls show voter dissatisfaction with Bush's stewardship - 
A06  37 especially over the economy - and skepticism about promises he's 
A06  38 making.<p/>
A06  39 <p_>Those sentiments may not be budged - not even by unruly debates 
A06  40 or the wild card called Perot - and therein lie the reasons for 
A06  41 Clinton's confidence that he can stave off any Bush comeback.<p/>
A06  42 <p_><quote_>"I really don't think Perot alters the 
A06  43 landscape,"<quote/> says Texas Democratic Party chairman Bob 
A06  44 Slagle.<p/>
A06  45 <p_>A primer for the campaign's final four weeks:<p/>
A06  46 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/><tf|>Debates. Bush - hoping to lob 
A06  47 firepower at Clinton without giving the Democrat enough time to 
A06  48 recoup - wanted to shove the debates as close to Election Day as 
A06  49 possible.<p/>
A06  50 <p_>Clinton prevailed in debate negotiations, ensuring himself two 
A06  51 weeks after the last debate Oct. 19 to recover from any gaffes and 
A06  52 to return the campaign dialogue to the themes he thinks will win 
A06  53 the election.<p/>
A06  54 <p_>But the dizzyingly dense debate schedule - Oct. 11, Oct. 15, 
A06  55 Oct. 19 - means each of the three candidates will have to repair 
A06  56 wounds in the next debate, not in the news media or TV ads.<p/>
A06  57 <p_><quote_>"I think it's going to truly turn debates into a blood 
A06  58 sport,"<quote/> says GOP pollster Ed Goeas, <quote_>"both in terms 
A06  59 of what the candidates have to do and because there isn't going to 
A06  60 be time in between for voters to refocus on something 
A06  61 else."<quote/><p/>
A06  62 <p_>More than 50 million people are expected to watch the 
A06  63 prime-time duels, and if it's true a quarter of voters make up 
A06  64 their minds the final week, the debates could sway some.<p/>
A06  65 <p_>Almost every presidential debate has a crystallizing moment 
A06  66 that either erodes support or multiplies it - the instant everybody 
A06  67 talks about at work the next day.<p/>
A06  68 <p_>This year, if it's a Perot 'moment,' the impact may be 
A06  69 negligible.<p/>
A06  70 <p_><quote_>"I think that Perot in the debates will be a spectacle 
A06  71 to behold,"<quote/> says Jim Oberwetter, Bush's Texas campaign 
A06  72 chairman. <quote_>"He has nothing to lose and is going to be on a 
A06  73 roll."<quote/><p/>
A06  74 <p_>If Perot shines, <quote_>"then it's a wash for both Bush and 
A06  75 Clinton,"<quote/> says Ron Walters, political science chair at 
A06  76 Washington's Howard University. <quote_>"It's much harder to figure 
A06  77 out who won a three-person debate."<quote/><p/>
A06  78 <p_>Bush has the most to gain: He must create a theatrical event 
A06  79 that either embarrasses Clinton or makes the president soar by 
A06  80 rhetorical comparison.<p/>
A06  81 <p_>But many analysts say Clinton's task is easier: He must only 
A06  82 reassure voters who doubt his stature or trustworthiness.<p/>
A06  83 <p_>Clinton needs only <quote_>"to stand on the same platform with 
A06  84 George Bush and hold his own,"<quote/> says Garrett.<p/>
A06  85 <p_><quote_>"Bush has got to both damage Clinton and make himself 
A06  86 an acceptable alternative. And Bush's greatest danger is that if he 
A06  87 peels support away from Clinton it ... may be siphoned off to 
A06  88 Perot."<quote/><p/>
A06  89 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/><tf|>Perot. OK, so he won't be sworn in 
A06  90 as president in January, but he still could create plenty of 
A06  91 mischief.<p/>
A06  92 <p_><quote_>"There is no realistic prospect ... he'll recapture the 
A06  93 magic of June,"<quote/> says Walter Dean Burnham, a University of 
A06  94 Texas political scientist.<p/>
A06  95 <p_>Perot I had evidence he could win Texas and Florida and take 
A06  96 chunks out of Clinton's support among voters who want anybody but 
A06  97 Bush.<p/>
A06  98 <p_>Perot II can't alter the outcome in any state, analysts say, 
A06  99 but he could make life uncomfortable in close battlegrounds such as 
A06 100 Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. If undecided voters swing to Perot, 
A06 101 Bush will have little chance to woo them back. If Perot talks only 
A06 102 about the economy he could actually elevate political discourse and 
A06 103 force the other two candidates to talk about the issue that matters 
A06 104 most to voters.<p/>
A06 105 <p_><quote_>"His emphasis on the deficit ... will work to the 
A06 106 detriment of Bush,"<quote/> says Walters, but Perot's military 
A06 107 background and POW heroism may remind voters of Clinton's draft 
A06 108 record.<p/>
A06 109 <p_><quote_>"He highlights in a very interesting way the negatives 
A06 110 on both sides,"<quote/> Walters says.<p/>
A06 111 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/><tf|>Tone. This weekend, Bush flooded the 
A06 112 airwaves with two negative TV ads, Clinton rebutted and each 
A06 113 trotted out even sharper attacks on the campaign trail. Outlook: 
A06 114 unremittingly negative.<p/>
A06 115 <p_><quote_>"When you're frustrated and you're behind, you do 
A06 116 anything you can,"<quote/> says Walters.<p/>
A06 117 <p_>Bush's 1988 attacks on Michael Dukakis have taught Clinton to 
A06 118 fight back and may have hardened the electorate to nasty ads. 
A06 119 <quote_>"People expect it,"<quote/> says former GOP strategist 
A06 120 Kevin Phillips.<p/>
A06 121 <p_><quote_>"The alternative,"<quote/> says Goeas, <quote_>"is 
A06 122 political candidates saying a bunch of positive things about 
A06 123 themselves that we really have to question."<quote/><p/>
A06 124 <p_>Few expect the campaign to slog on to a tepid conclusion.<p/>
A06 125 <p_><quote_>"Voters are saying they've never seen a year like 
A06 126 it,"<quote/> says Oberwetter. <quote_>"It's like, 'Isn't that

A06 130 <h_><p_>Some think clerks wield excess clout<p/>
A06 131 <p_>Their influence as justices' aides debated<p/>
A06 132 <p_>By Tony Mauro<p/>
A06 133 <p_>USA TODAY<p/><h/>
A06 134 <p_>As the Supreme Court convenes for its fall term today, a new 
A06 135 question is in the air: Who's in charge?<p/>
A06 136 <p_>The query pertains not just to the power struggles among the 
A06 137 justices - subject of a summer's worth of speculation by 
A06 138 court-watchers.<p/>
A06 139 <p_>Also in the spotlight are the 34 clerks - fresh-scrubbed 
A06 140 lawyers, mostly white males - who help screen cases and write 
A06 141 opinions.<p/>
A06 142 <p_>Some conservatives point to last term's law clerks in their 
A06 143 search to explain why Justices Anthony Kennedy, David Souter and 
A06 144 Sandra Day O'Connor seemed to shift from the right to the middle in 
A06 145 the landmark Pennsylvania abortion case.<p/>
A06 146 <p_>The clerks, it was said, were dispatched by left-leaning law 
A06 147 schools - 12 were from Harvard - with the mission of turning their 
A06 148 justices into liberals.<p/>
A06 149 <p_>Adding to the debate is the fact that eight of nine justices 
A06 150 now pool their clerks for the initial screening of cases.<p/>
A06 151 <p_>The arrangement means that for those eight, most of the 
A06 152 incoming cases are looked at by only one pair of young eyes, not by 
A06 153 the justices themselves or their own clerks. The pool clerks write 
A06 154 a brief memo on each case that goes to the eight justices.<p/>
A06 155 <p_>Do clerks, who also write rough drafts of actual opinions for 
A06 156 most justices, have too much power?<p/>
A06 157 <p_>That's a debate that has simmered ever since Justice Horace 
A06 158 Gray hired the first law clerk 110 years ago.<p/>
A06 159 <p_>Justices now have four clerks each - except Chief Justice 
A06 160 William Rehnquist and John Paul Stevens, who get by with three.<p/>
A06 161 <p_>Rehnquist, a clerk himself 40 years ago, emerged fearful about 
A06 162 their liberalizing influence. Most of them, he said back then, 
A06 163 showed <quote_>"extreme solicitude for the claims of communists and 
A06 164 other criminal defendants."<quote/><p/>
A06 165 <p_>Now he minimizes their role. <quote_>"Individual justices still 
A06 166 continue to do a great deal more of their own work than do their 
A06 167 counterparts in the other branches of the federal 
A06 168 government,"<quote/> Rehnquist wrote in 1987.<p/>
A06 169 <p_>Still, concern is growing that too much responsibility is 
A06 170 invested in young clerks, most of them no more than a year out of 
A06 171 law school.<p/>
A06 172 <p_><quote_>"It is really rather remarkable how little they know 
A06 173 when they arrive ... and how fast they have to learn,"<quote/> says 
A06 174 E.W. Perry Jr., a Harvard government professor who has studied the 
A06 175 court.<p/>
A06 176 <p_>Most of the clerks work for only one very intense year - 
A06 177 dawn-to-midnight, six- or seven-day work weeks are common - at a 
A06 178 salary currently set at $38,861. During the year, the clerks are 
A06 179 virtually constant companions to their justices - who themselves 
A06 180 complain they have little contact with other justices or the 
A06 181 outside world.<p/>
A06 182 <p_>Clerks are justices' lunch companions, tennis-mates, sounding 
A06 183 boards, and, in some instances, ghostwriters.<p/>
A06 184 <p_><quote_>"Most of the writing that comes out of the court is 
A06 185 done by law clerks ... "<quote/> says Harvard Law School professor 
A06 186 Randall Kennedy, a former clerk for Marshall. <quote_>"But clerks 
A06 187 don't run things. The justices call the shots."<quote/><p/>
A06 188 <p_>Privately some clerks boast they changed their justices' minds 
A06 189 on decisions during their year, or that a draft they wrote emerged 
A06 190 untouched by the justice.<p/>
A06 191 <p_><quote_>"When you give the job to clerks, you get more 
A06 192 footnotes and less original thinking,"<quote/> says University of 
A06 193 Southern California law professor Susan Estrich. <quote_>"Original 
A06 194 thinking is what we pay the justices for, isn't it?"<quote/><p/>
A06 195 <p_>Estrich, who managed Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign in 
A06 196 1988, clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens 10 years earlier.<p/>
A06 197 <p_>But most clerks insist that they are helping, not steering, 
A06 198 their justices through a staggering writing load.<p/>
A06 199 <p_><quote_>"There's a lot of puffery that goes on, but really, the 
A06 200 importance of law clerks has been exaggerated,"<quote/> says J. 
A06 201 Harvie Wilkinson, a Richmond, Va., federal appeals judge who wrote 
A06 202 a book about his clerkship 20 years ago for Lewis Powell.<p/>
A06 203 <p_>The newest concerns focus not on drafting opinions but on 
A06 204 screening cases - one of the court's most important tasks, 
A06 205 sometimes making the difference literally between life and 
A06 206 death.<p/>
A06 207 <p_>Routinely, the justices consider fewer than 150 cases each 
A06 208 term, rejecting more than 5,000 and leaving lower court rulings in 
A06 209 place.<p/>
A06 210 <p_>The last two justices to leave the court - William Brennan Jr. 
A06 211 and Thurgood Marshall - had refused to join the pool arrangement 
A06 212 during their tenure, preferring to rely on their own reading of new 
A06 213 cases, or on assessments by their own clerks, more attuned to their 
A06 214 legal views and interests.<p/>
A06 215 <p_>Both justices, according to former clerks, occasionally 
A06 216 discovered important cases pool clerks had passed over.<p/>
A06 217 <p_>David Souter and Clarence Thomas, who replaced Brennan and 
A06 218 Marshall, have joined the pool, leaving only Stevens outside it as 
A06 219 a check on screening new cases. Clerks for other justices can 
A06 220 supplement the pool memos, as an additional check.<p/>
A06 221 <p_>The chief target of conservative concern last term was Michael 
A06 222 Dorf, who clerked for Justice Kennedy - a conservative whose 
A06 223 middle-of-the-road votes in the abortion case and a school prayer 
A06 224 case surprised many.<p/>
A06 225 <p_>Dorf co-authored a book with liberal Harvard law professor 
A06 226 Laurence Tribe before working for Kennedy.<p/>
A06 227 <p_>Dorf, now teaching law at Rutgers University Law School in 
A06 228 Camden, N.J., says it is <quote_>"insulting and ridiculous"<quote/> 
A06 229 to suggest that he pushed Kennedy toward any position he was not 
A06 230 prepared to take. <quote_>"He makes all his decisions for 
A06 231 himself,"<quote/> says Dorf.<p/>

A06 233 <h_><p_>Election Day is high court's judgement day<p/>
A06 234 <p_>By Tony Mauro<p/>
A06 235 <p_>USA TODAY<p/><h/>
A06 236 <p_>Officially, Election Day is just like any other day at the 
A06 237 Supreme Court - whose 1992-93 term opens today.<p/>
A06 238 <p_>Justices will hear cases Nov. 3 and may hand down rulings, 
A06 239 barely noting the momentous events occurring in other branches of 
A06 240 government.<p/>
A06 241 <p_>Yet the presidential election will have a tremendous effect on 
A06 242 the court - more than any individual case on the court's docket 
A06 243 this fall.<p/>
A06 244 <p_>Washington, D.C., lawyer Richard Willard was discussing

A07   1 <#FROWN:A07\><h_><p_>Clinton in '69: Mostly Typical, in a Most 
A07   2 Untypical Time<p/>
A07   3 <p_>By Michael Kelly and David Johnston<p/>
A07   4 <p_>New York Times Service<p/><h/>
A07   5 <p_>WASHINGTON - In the fall and winter of 1969, several important 
A07   6 things happened in the life of a bright, ambitious young man named 
A07   7 Bill Clinton.<p/>
A07   8 <p_>After months of elaborate effort, he finally beat the draft for 
A07   9 the Vietnam War, drawing a number high enough in the new national 
A07  10 lottery that he would never be inducted.<p/>
A07  11 <p_>He became, in a small way, a figure within the anti-war 
A07  12 movement, helping to organize one of the largest marches on 
A07  13 Washington the movement ever produced and serving as a chief 
A07  14 organizer of two small demonstrations in London. He took a trip 
A07  15 through the Scandinavian countries, Russia and Czechoslovakia.<p/>
A07  16 <p_>In later years, as Mr. Clinton charted the political course 
A07  17 toward the presidency, he did not often publicly speak of the 
A07  18 events of that year, and when he did, it was in vague and passive 
A07  19 terms, as if he had been a sort of accidental tourist of his 
A07  20 times.<p/>
A07  21 <p_>Now, in the fall of 1992, with Mr. Clinton close to his goal, 
A07  22 those who would stop him have turned their increasingly frightened 
A07  23 attention to events 23 years ago, hoping to find in them something 
A07  24 that will, in the end, convince voters that a change from President 
A07  25 George Bush is not worth the risk of Mr. Clinton.<p/>
A07  26 <p_>The story, as far as it is clear, of Mr. Clinton's anti-war 
A07  27 activities in 1969 and what he and the Republicans alike are saying 
A07  28 about those activities in 1992 is illustrative of several points 
A07  29 about that time and this one.<p/>
A07  30 <p_>It shows, as Democrats are saying publicly and even some 
A07  31 Republicans are saying privately, how desperate the Republicans 
A07  32 have become. It shows, as Republicans like to say, how Mr. Clinton 
A07  33 has tended to shade the edges of his life.<p/>
A07  34 <p_>But above all, it shows how sharp the difference remains 
A07  35 between Mr. Bush's world and Mr. Clinton's, between the clear moral 
A07  36 absolutes of the generation of World War II and the muddied 
A07  37 gropings of those who came of age during the Vietnam War.<p/>
A07  38 <p_>The exact nature of Mr. Clinton's anti-war activities has been 
A07  39 confused by both Republican exaggeration and Democratic 
A07  40 obfuscation. But a basic outline seems clear.<p/>
A07  41 <p_>Although Mr. Clinton has described his participation in peace 
A07  42 demonstrations as limited to that almost of a curious passer-by, 
A07  43 the candidate's previous statements and those of several friends 
A07  44 and of anti-war protesters indicate a more substantial 
A07  45 involvement.<p/>
A07  46 <p_>Mr. Clinton was an organizer of two London rallies in the fall 
A07  47 of 1969 and also helped, to an apparently much lesser degree, 
A07  48 organize a huge march on Washington on Oct. 15, 1969.<p/>
A07  49 <p_>Yet, if Mr. Clinton appears to have minimized his activities, 
A07  50 it also appears true that the Republicans are wrong to depict him 
A07  51 as a major anti-war organizer or Communist sympathizer.<p/>
A07  52 <p_>No evidence has surfaced indicating that Mr. Clinton took part 
A07  53 in any violent political actions or was an important anti-war 
A07  54 organizer.<p/>
A07  55 <p_>Many of those involved with him at the time recall him as 
A07  56 something of a milquetoast by the standards of late 1960s 
A07  57 radicalism, a young man driven by a desire to remake his country, 
A07  58 not to reject it.<p/>
A07  59 <p_>It is also clear that the actions of Mr. Clinton at age 23 - in 
A07  60 avoiding military induction, in demonstrating against U.S. foreign 
A07  61 policy, even in traveling to the Soviet Union - were not unusual. 
A07  62 Indeed, they were almost prototypical of those who, like him, were 
A07  63 part of the intellectual elite of that generation.<p/>
A07  64 <p_>But if Mr. Clinton was typical of his class and time, the 
A07  65 actions of that class and the tenor of that time were not at all 
A07  66 typical of American history. No other generation has ever acted in 
A07  67 quite the fashion that Mr. Clinton's did, nor stirred more 
A07  68 unresolved passions. Now, in the person of Mr. Clinton, American 
A07  69 voters face the possibility that a generation that once took to the 
A07  70 streets to publicly denounce American policy will lead it.<p/>
A07  71 <p_>What is unknown - but will be known on Nov. 3 - is whether it 
A07  72 matters much anymore.<p/>
A07  73 <p_>As Mr. Clinton pointed out Thursday: <quote_>"Mr. Bush in his 
A07  74 Inaugural Address had a wonderful phrase about how the Vietnam War 
A07  75 cleaves us still and it was time to put it behind us.<p/>
A07  76 <p_>"And now, because he's behind, he's tried to raise all the 
A07  77 challenges of that time."<quote/><p/>
A07  78 <p_>The Republican campaign to paint Mr. Clinton as a man with a 
A07  79 secretly militant history began on Sept. 18, the first night of 
A07  80 eight in which a quartet of conservative congressmen - Robert K. 
A07  81 Dornan, Randy Cunningham and Duncan Hunter of California, and Sam 
A07  82 Johnson of Texas - took to the deserted floor of the House to 
A07  83 denounce Mr. Clinton.<p/>
A07  84 <p_>The speeches were extraordinary for a level of strident, 
A07  85 hyperbolic accusations that echoed the red<?_>-<?/>baiting rhetoric 
A07  86 of 40 years ago.<p/>
A07  87 <p_>The speakers described Mr. Clinton as a <quote_>"useful 
A07  88 idiot"<quote/> to the Soviet government, as a man who in other 
A07  89 countries would have been <quote_>"tried as a traitor or even 
A07  90 shot,"<quote/> as a <quote_>"full<?_>-<?/>time organizer for 
A07  91 demonstrations against his country in a foreign country,"<quote/> 
A07  92 as a man <quote_>"directly responsible"<quote/> for the deaths of 
A07  93 American military men in Vietnam.<p/>
A07  94 <p_>On Wednesday, Mr. Bush picked up the brush.<p/>
A07  95 <p_><quote_>"I cannot for the life of me understand mobilizing 
A07  96 demonstrations and demonstrating against your own country, no 
A07  97 matter how strongly you feel, when you are in a foreign 
A07  98 land,"<quote/> Mr. Bush said, in an interview on the CNN program 
A07  99 'Larry King Live.'<p/>
A07 100 <p_>Mr. Clinton said, as he has always said, that he had been an 
A07 101 outspoken opponent of the war, but defended his activities in 1969 
A07 102 as innocent and minor. He said that he <quote_>"helped put together 
A07 103 a teach-in at the University of London"<quote/> and that that had 
A07 104 been <quote_>"the only thing I ever helped put 
A07 105 together."<quote/><p/>
A07 106 <p_>He acknowledged that he had <quote|>"participated" in a 
A07 107 demonstration at the U.S. Embassy.<p/>
A07 108 <p_>Mr. Clinton's own words, included in a letter he wrote on Dec. 
A07 109 3, 1969, appear to belie the claim that he organized, or helped to 
A07 110 organize, only one event, the teach-in.<p/>
A07 111 <p_><quote_>"I have written and spoken and marched against the 
A07 112 war,"<quote/> he wrote in a letter to the director of the Reserve 
A07 113 Officers' Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas, 
A07 114 explaining why he had decided not to join the program. 
A07 115 <quote_>"After I left Arkansas last summer, I went to Washington to 
A07 116 work in the national headquarters of the Moratorium, then to 
A07 117 England to organize the Americans here for demonstrations Oct. 15 
A07 118 and Nov. 16."<quote/><p/>
A07 119 <p_>The <quote|>"Moratorium" Mr. Clinton referred to was one of two 
A07 120 enormous international anti-war protests of 1969, culminating in a 
A07 121 huge protest march in Washington on Oct. 15.<p/>
A07 122 <p_>David Mixner, a national co<?_>-<?/>chairman of the Moratorium, 
A07 123 recalls Mr. Clinton as <quote_>"not at all a major player in the 
A07 124 anti-war movement"<quote/> but as someone who helped, in a small 
A07 125 way, in the summer of 1969 to organize the fall protests.<p/>
A07 126 <p_>In the fall, Mr. Clinton returned to England for his second 
A07 127 year as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford. On Moratorium Day, about 300 
A07 128 people, mostly American students, demonstrated peacefully outside 
A07 129 the U.S. Embassy in London. It is apparently this rally that Mr. 
A07 130 Clinton claims in his December 1969 letter to have organized.<p/>
A07 131 <p_>Ira Magaziner, who was a fellow student at Oxford in 1969 and 
A07 132 is now a senior economics adviser to the Clinton campaign, said he 
A07 133 remembered the October rally but did not recall Mr. Clinton as an 
A07 134 organizer. Like several of Mr. Clinton's friends of that time who 
A07 135 were interviewed this week, he remembers the student from Arkansas 
A07 136 as intensely interested in issues like the war and racism, but not 
A07 137 as a radical.<p/>
A07 138 <p_><quote_>"This was a very conventional group of people, not 
A07 139 people who were burning flags or shouting 'pig' at the 
A07 140 police,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"It was a very moderate group of 
A07 141 people."<quote/><p/>
A07 142 <p_>On Nov. 15, another demonstration was held in front of the 
A07 143 American Embassy. This rally was larger than the October rally, 
A07 144 drawing about 1,500 people, who filed silently in front of the 
A07 145 embassy.<p/>
A07 146 <p_>The marchers bore a coffin and, according to a contemporary 
A07 147 account, carried cards with the names of servicemen who died in 
A07 148 Vietnam. They walked to a megaphone in front of the embassy, called 
A07 149 out the name and then dropped the card into a makeshift coffin.<p/>
A07 150 <p_>Republicans have said Mr. Clinton took part in this 
A07 151 demonstration and even helped negotiate with American Embassy 
A07 152 officials to take the symbolic coffin inside. It is not clear if 
A07 153 this is true.<p/>
A07 154 <p_>What is clear is that Mr. Clinton played a role in organizing a 
A07 155 related, but separate, demonstration on Nov. 16, which also took 
A07 156 place near the embassy. That rally was peaceful, according to both 
A07 157 witnesses and news accounts.<p/>
A07 158 <p_>A second aspect of Mr. Clinton's activities that has come under 
A07 159 heavy Republican assault is a 40-day trip in late 1969 and early 
A07 160 1970 to several Northern European and Eastern bloc countries, 
A07 161 including the Soviet Union. Mr. Clinton has been vague about the 
A07 162 details of the trip, and his New Year's Eve visit to Moscow in 1969 
A07 163 has been the subject of the most searing attacks by Republicans.<p/>
A07 164 <p_>Mr. Bush elevated the attack on the issue Wednesday evening, 
A07 165 when he was asked about the trip on 'Larry King Live.'<p/>
A07 166 <p_><quote_>"I don't want to tell you what I really think,"<quote/> 
A07 167 Mr. Bush said, adding, <quote_>"To go to Moscow, one year after 
A07 168 Russia crushed Czechoslovakia, not remember what you saw 
A07 169 there."<quote/><p/>
A07 170 <p_>Mr. Clinton said Thursday that he traveled alone as a tourist 
A07 171 and did not attend any gatherings or meet with any Soviet 
A07 172 officials.<p/>
A07 173 <p_>Although some Republicans have made many and varied 
A07 174 insinuations suggesting Soviet control or financing of the trip, no 
A07 175 Republican has produced evidence or a witness to back up that 
A07 176 notion.<p/>

A07 178 <h_><p_>China Affirms Zhao Erred in Support For Protesters, but 
A07 179 Ends Its Inquiry<p/>
A07 180 <p_>By Lena H. Sun<p/>
A07 181 <p_>Washington Post Service<p/><h/>
A07 182 <p_>BEIJING - China's ruling Communist Party ended its 
A07 183 investigation Friday of the former party leader Zhao Ziyang, 
A07 184 upholding a hard-line decision three years ago that Mr. Zhao made 
A07 185 serious mistakes in supporting the 1989 democracy demonstrations, 
A07 186 Xinhua press agency said.<p/>
A07 187 <p_>The three-paragraph announcement by the party's policy-making 
A07 188 Central Committee effectively ruled out any return to political 
A07 189 life by the former prot<*_>e-acute<*/>g<*_>e-acute<*/> of the 
A07 190 senior leader Deng Xiaoping. At the same time, the news agency 
A07 191 appeared to indicate that no further action, such as criminal 
A07 192 proceedings, would be taken against him.<p/>
A07 193 <p_>The timing of the announcement took some analysts by surprise 
A07 194 because it was believed that internal party differences over his 
A07 195 case were still too great to allow a conclusion before a major 
A07 196 party congress is to open here on Monday.<p/>
A07 197 <p_>The congress is expected to promote some younger, more 
A07 198 reformist leaders into the top echelons of the party. The fact that 
A07 199 the party has officially closed the chapter on Mr. Zhao before the 
A07 200 congress suggests that hard-liners opposed to even a partial 
A07 201 clearing of his name were hoping to use that strategy to prevent 
A07 202 any newly elected reformist leaders from reopening the case, 
A07 203 according to some analysts.<p/>
A07 204 <p_><quote_>"This just sweeps it under the rug so they don't have 
A07 205 to argue about it during the congress,"<quote/> said a Western 
A07 206 diplomat.<p/>
A07 207 <p_>It is now almost certain that the party will not reconsider the 
A07 208 issue while Mr. Deng and the other party elders who rule China are 
A07 209 still alive.<p/>
A07 210 <p_>It is not known what immediate effect the decision will have on 
A07 211 Mr. Zhao, 74, who has not been seen in public since May 19, 1989. 
A07 212 He has been living under virtual house arrest in central Beijing 
A07 213 with his family. The news agency still referred to him as 
A07 214 <quote|>"comrade." It is highly unlikely that he would be expelled 
A07 215 from the party.<p/>
A07 216 <p_>His case has been under investigation for so long because it 
A07 217 goes to the heart of the 1989 crackdown: Whether Mr. Deng and 
A07 218 China's other ruling elders were wrong to order the Chinese Army to 
A07 219 fire on demonstrators. Any backpedaling on Mr. Zhao's case would be 
A07 220 interpreted to mean a reassessment of the decision to crack 
A07 221 down.<p/>

A08   1 <#FROWN:A08\><h_><p_>Russia's Archives Get Their Dose of Glasnost, 
A08   2 But Sensitive Secrets Are Still Closely Guarded<p/>
A08   3 <p_>By Elisabeth Rubinfien<p/>
A08   4 <p_>Staff Reporter of <tf_>The Wall Street Journal<tf/><p/><h/>
A08   5 <p_>MOSCOW - Rem Usikov punches a numbered code into a lock panel, 
A08   6 pulls open a heavy metal door, and strides into a labyrinth of 
A08   7 carpeted corridors leading to the secret files of the Central 
A08   8 Committee of the Soviet Communist Party.<p/>
A08   9 <p_>Past office doors where name plates still say 
A08  10 <foreign|>tovarisch, or comrade, the archive's director comes to 
A08  11 Preserve No. 9, a temperature-controlled, spotless cave of a room 
A08  12 filled with metal cabinets stacked six high.<p/>
A08  13 <p_>He randomly pulls out a binder on Central Committee discussions 
A08  14 in 1983. The handwritten scraps and typewritten memos range from 
A08  15 the mundane approval of a bureaucrat's business trip to the U.S. to 
A08  16 communication from the Guyana People's Progressive Party.<p/>
A08  17 <p_>The heavily guarded doors of the Russian archives have opened, 
A08  18 wider than anyone would have expected a few years ago. Foreign 
A08  19 journalists can walk these halls with men whose lives were once 
A08  20 dedicated to secrecy. Almost every day, revelations appear - about 
A08  21 U.S. prisoners of war held in the Soviet Union after World War II, 
A08  22 or Soviet involvement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.<p/>
A08  23 <p_>The court challenge to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
A08  24 constitutional authority to outlaw the Communist Party has brought 
A08  25 a flood of testimony that the party intruded into state activities, 
A08  26 used the state budget to finance revolution abroad, and, even under 
A08  27 former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, supported Mideast 
A08  28 terrorists.<p/>
A08  29 <h_><p_>Conservatives Prevail<p/><h/>
A08  30 <p_>But for all the hoopla about secrets revealed, the vaults are 
A08  31 still mostly closed. While Russia's Committee on Archival Affairs, 
A08  32 Roskomarkhiv, may want to quickly declassify as much material as 
A08  33 possible, more conservative thinking prevails in many subordinate 
A08  34 agencies. Many restrictions keep scholars from research materials 
A08  35 and individuals from their own surveillance files. When ideology 
A08  36 doesn't stand in the way, shortages of funds, space and personnel 
A08  37 slow the process.<p/>
A08  38 <p_>Those details that have dribbled out in the Russian news media 
A08  39 seem to be available less because of archival openness than because 
A08  40 they are suitable weapons in the political battle raging between 
A08  41 supporters of President Yeltsin and hard-line Communists.<p/>
A08  42 <p_><quote_>"It's hard to talk about serious openness of archives 
A08  43 today,"<quote/> says Konstantin Akinsha, an art historian whose 
A08  44 archival research uncovered the fact that the Soviet Union had 
A08  45 squirreled away millions of dollars worth of art treasures 
A08  46 confiscated at the end of World War II from the Nazis - who had 
A08  47 looted them in the first place. <quote_>"These are only the first 
A08  48 steps, and they're very far from total openness."<quote/><p/>
A08  49 <p_>Mr. Usikov's Central Committee files are one of the treasure 
A08  50 troves Russian and foreign scholars have long wondered about. With 
A08  51 40 separate archives, they include the most secret files of the 
A08  52 Central Committee, from 1952 until the day of the failed coup 
A08  53 against Mr. Gorbachev last year. Earlier Central Committee records 
A08  54 are in a different archive.<p/>
A08  55 <h_><p_>Expert Review<p/><h/>
A08  56 <p_>Documents from before 1942 have been declassified and experts 
A08  57 are working to declassify those from 1942 to 1962. But of some 200 
A08  58 million to 300 million Central Committee documents, Mr. Usikov 
A08  59 estimates that only a third are open. These cover the more mundane 
A08  60 party work such as propaganda and organization. The hotter topics 
A08  61 of foreign policy and military and security affairs, are to be 
A08  62 declassified after study by 'experts,' including members of the 
A08  63 former KGB, and the foreign and defense ministries.<p/>
A08  64 <p_>Ultimately, says Mr. Usikov, the archives must be fully opened. 
A08  65 <quote_>"It gives us the opportunity to understand history and to 
A08  66 restore the true past,"<quote/> he says, <quote_>"without the 
A08  67 deviations, the distortions, without the ideological layers that 
A08  68 were put on it."<quote/><p/>
A08  69 <p_>While many archivists share that feeling, some institutions 
A08  70 that have their own archives feel secrecy is safer than truth. Take 
A08  71 the former KGB, now split into the Ministry of Security and its 
A08  72 external intelligence counterpart. Roskomarkhiv chairman and 
A08  73 historian Rudolf Pikhoia believes the central archival 
A08  74 administration has jurisdiction over the KGB stores, but the 
A08  75 security ministry disagrees.<p/>
A08  76 <p_><quote_>"All KGB documents are still closed,"<quote/> says Mr. 
A08  77 Pikhoia. <quote_>"That is a very serious problem."<quote/> Mr. 
A08  78 Pikhoia recalls that in the heady days after the coup attempt, 
A08  79 Roskomarkhiv <quote_>"didn't press hard enough"<quote/> to gain 
A08  80 control of the KGB files. Overwhelmed with an unexpected 70 million 
A08  81 Soviet Communist Party files, the 4.5 million KGB files seemed like 
A08  82 small change that would be easy to pocket later. <quote_>"Now I say 
A08  83 that was a mistake because the situation turns out to be more 
A08  84 complicated,"<quote/> he says.<p/>
A08  85 <p_>At the former KGB headquarters in the Lubyanka building, which 
A08  86 now houses the security ministry, some three million files on 
A08  87 victims of repressions and on repatriated World War II prisoners 
A08  88 are ready to be handed over to Roskomarkhiv - but it hasn't enough 
A08  89 space to take them in.<p/>
A08  90 <p_>Meanwhile, the remainder of the KGB files are untouchable. 
A08  91 <quote_>"The question of jurisdiction over the archives is still to 
A08  92 be worked out,"<quote/> says Aleksandr Zubchenko, head of the 
A08  93 security ministry's archives.<p/>
A08  94 <p_>It is in these archives that the surveillance files on 
A08  95 individual citizens are kept. Russia has no law allowing people 
A08  96 easy access to such files, as in Czechoslovakia or the former East 
A08  97 Germany. Here, a citizen who asks for his own file will be given a 
A08  98 summary of the contents, carefully screened to exclude information 
A08  99 still classified under law, such as who the informants were.<p/>
A08 100 <p_>Even Boris Yeltsin himself has yet to cooperate with giving up 
A08 101 the president's special files. These archives were created by 
A08 102 dictator Joseph Stalin, who assiduously gathered compromising 
A08 103 material on his opposition and colleagues. That material, which 
A08 104 covered Politburo activities from 1919 until 1986, was commandeered 
A08 105 by Mr. Gorbachev in 1990. Mr. Yeltsin took it over when he claimed 
A08 106 the Kremlin at the end of last year.<p/>
A08 107 <p_>Mr. Yeltsin has long promised to hand the material over to the 
A08 108 central archives, but no transfer has taken place yet. <quote_>"We 
A08 109 have asked Boris Yeltsin during all these months, but there is 
A08 110 still no answer,"<quote/> Mr. Usikov says.<p/>

A08 115 <p_>By Thomas Kamm<p/>
A08 116 <p_>Staff Reporter of <tf_>The Wall Street Journal<tf/><p/><h/>
A08 117 <p_>BRASILIA, Brazil - President Fernando Collor de Mello faces a 
A08 118 battle to hold on to his job after a congressional panel 
A08 119 investigating activities of his campaign treasurer alleged that Mr. 
A08 120 Collor received <quote_>"undue economic advantages"<quote/> during 
A08 121 the 29 months of his presidency.<p/>
A08 122 <p_>In a report capping an 85-day investigation, the special panel 
A08 123 contended that millions of dollars of Mr. Collor's living expenses, 
A08 124 including the refurbishing of the presidential mansion in Brasilia 
A08 125 and his luxury dwelling in his home town in eastern Brazil, and the 
A08 126 acquisition of a car, were paid for by his 1989 campaign treasurer, 
A08 127 Paulo Cesar Farias, or companies Mr. Farias controls, with funds 
A08 128 derived from <quote_>"an industry of influence-peddling"<quote/> 
A08 129 set up around the presidency.<p/>
A08 130 <p_><quote_>"Extraordinary payments were made to cover the personal 
A08 131 expenses of the president of the republic, either to maintain the

A08 133 ex-wife, his mother, his sister and his wife and her 
A08 134 secretary."<quote/> the report said.<p/>
A08 135 <p_><quote_>"The facts described are contrary to the principles 
A08 136 enshrined in the constitution, as they are incompatible with the 
A08 137 dignity, the honor and the decorum of the chief of state's 
A08 138 function,"<quote/> it said.<p/>
A08 139 <p_>Mr. Collor, the first freely elected Brazilian president after 
A08 140 two decades of military rule, has previously denied any wrongdoing 
A08 141 and had no immediate reaction to the report. His spokesman said 
A08 142 over the weekend the president is likely to address the nation this 
A08 143 week. Mr. Farias, in a televised telephone interview, denied 
A08 144 wrongdoing and said he would <quote_>"prove his 
A08 145 innocence."<quote/><p/>
A08 146 <h_><p_>Impeachment Request Expected<p/><h/>
A08 147 <p_>The investigative panel stopped short of incriminating 
A08 148 President Collor or formally requesting impeachment procedures 
A08 149 against him, arguing that it wasn't empowered to do so. But panel 
A08 150 members said the evidence they turned up can be used in court 
A08 151 against Mr. Collor or serve as the basis for impeachment. The 
A08 152 findings are being turned over to the attorney general, and several 
A08 153 groups say they will submit impeachment requests to Congress.<p/>
A08 154 <p_>If Mr. Collor decides to fight, the battle could throw Brazil 
A08 155 into turmoil. But yesterday, the Sao Paulo stock market index rose 
A08 156 on speculation that the report's harsh conclusions could force Mr. 
A08 157 Collor out of office quickly and forestall a crisis.<p/>
A08 158 <p_>An anti-corruption demonstration took place in Rio de Janeiro 
A08 159 yesterday, and a similar demonstration is expected to be called by 
A08 160 the governor of the state of Sao Paulo later this week.<p/>
A08 161 <p_>Congressmen and lawyers say opposition members will step up 
A08 162 their pressure for impeachment or for Mr. Collor's resignation, 
A08 163 arguing that he has lost the moral standing to govern. 
A08 164 <quote_>"Collor is still there, but he has no political life 
A08 165 anymore,"<quote/> says Sen. Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Mr. Collor's 
A08 166 involvement, he says, <quote_>"is total and direct. We have common 
A08 167 crimes, uncommon crimes and extraordinary crimes."<quote/><p/>
A08 168 <h_><p_>Pro-Government Defense<p/><h/>
A08 169 <p_>Allies of the government will try to prove that Mr. Collor had 
A08 170 no direct involvement in the scheme allegedly set up by Mr. Farias, 
A08 171 that the panel went beyond its assigned role to investigate Mr. 
A08 172 Farias and that it obtained evidence illegally by violating bank 
A08 173 secrecy. <quote_>"We'll contest the link with the 
A08 174 president,"<quote/> says Roberto Jefferson, a pro-government 
A08 175 federal deputy. <quote_>"We'll fight it in the Chamber of Deputies 
A08 176 and we'll fight it in the judiciary."<quote/><p/>
A08 177 <p_>An impeachment process must be approved by two-thirds of 
A08 178 Brazil's 503 federal deputies. By funding social programs supported 
A08 179 by pro-government parties, Mr. Collor could gain enough support to 
A08 180 ward off impeachment, though it's unclear what the economic 
A08 181 consequences of such a policy would be.<p/>
A08 182 <p_>The panel's findings provide unusual insights into corruption 
A08 183 and influence-peddling in Brazil. In its report, the panel says Mr. 
A08 184 Farias's personal and corporate fortune appears intimately linked 
A08 185 with Mr. Collor's political fortunes. Companies Mr. Farias controls 
A08 186 had <quote|>"unimpressive" revenue until Mr. Collor took office in 
A08 187 March 1990, and then became highly profitable, the report says.<p/>
A08 188 <p_>This income, the panel concluded, came largely from 
A08 189 influence-peddling. Mr. Farias, the report said, <quote_>"making 
A08 190 use of the president's friendship and prestige, obtained large sums 
A08 191 of money by selling nonexistent services"<quote/> in apparent 
A08 192 return for help on obtaining government contracts. The report says 
A08 193 companies controlled by Mr. Farias received about $200,000 per 
A08 194 instance for consulting work that they were clearly unequipped to 
A08 195 perform. The payments were made without bills and the companies 
A08 196 couldn't prove that any effective work was done. His jet-leasing 
A08 197 companies also billed flights that never took place, it concluded. 
A08 198 Mr. Farias has also denied any wrongdoing.<p/>
A08 199 <h_><p_><quote_>"Tens of Millions of Dollars"<quote/><p/><h/>
A08 200 <p_>The panel said it couldn't determine how much money the alleged 
A08 201 Farias scheme took in, but says it detected financial movements 
A08 202 totaling <quote_>"tens of millions of dollars."<quote/><p/>
A08 203 <p_>Part of this money was used for Mr. Collor's expenses and was 
A08 204 channeled to him through the account of his personal secretary, Ana 
A08 205 Acioli Gomes de Melo, it said. Mrs. Acioli's account was funded by 
A08 206 fictitious people, whose handwriting has been traced back to 
A08 207 employees of Mr. Farias.<p/>
A08 208 <p_>The panel said it doubts Mr. Collor's claim that his bills were 
A08 209 paid with a $5 million loan contracted in Uruguay in 1989 and 
A08 210 administered by his former top aide, Claudio Vieira. The panel said 
A08 211 it found no trace of deposits by Mr. Vieira in Mrs. Acioli's 
A08 212 account.<p/>

A08 219 <p_>WASHINGTON - President Bush is preparing to announce, perhaps 
A08 220 as early as today, that the U.S. and its allies are ordering Iraq 
A08 221 to stop flying its aircraft over the Shiite Muslim region of 
A08 222 southern Iraq, U.S. officials said.<p/>
A08 223 <p_>Most significant details of the agreement have been worked out 
A08 224 by the U.S., Britain, France and Saudi Arabia, the nations that 
A08 225 will be responsible for policing the ban on Iraqi flights, Bush 
A08 226 administration aides said. Those nations are imposing the blockade 
A08 227 to make it more difficult for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to use 
A08 228 his military power to attack Shiite dissidents who have been an 
A08 229 irritation for him in the past year.<p/>

A09   2 <p_>Powerful militia rejects more troops<p/>
A09   3 <p_>ASSOCIATED PRESS<p/><h/>
A09   4 <p_>Mogadishu, Somalia - The most powerful clan militia in Somalia 
A09   5 said Saturday that it opposes a U.N. plan to send more troops to 
A09   6 protect food deliveries for more than a million starving 
A09   7 Somalis.<p/>
A09   8 <p_>Aid workers worried that without support from Gen. Mohammed 
A09   9 Farrah Aidid's United Somali Congress, the arrival of the troops 
A09  10 would spark new fighting in the ravaged country.<p/>
A09  11 <p_>Mohammed Sahnoun, the United Nations's special envoy to 
A09  12 Somalia, said Saturday that the international body would proceed 
A09  13 slowly and win the support of warring factions before sending any 
A09  14 additional troops.<p/>
A09  15 <p_>Meanwhile, a U.S. airlift to help save Somalis from starvation 
A09  16 continued smoothly for a second day.<p/>
A09  17 <p_>The United Nations estimates that 1.5 million Somalis are in 
A09  18 danger of dying and that another 4.5 million require food and other 
A09  19 emergency assistance.<p/>
A09  20 <p_>The United Nations voted late Friday to send 3,000 troops to 
A09  21 guard relief shipments, in addition to 500 troops already promised. 
A09  22 Looting has hampered relief aid to the war-torn country.<p/>
A09  23 <p_>The dangers of delivering food were underscored Friday when two 
A09  24 unarmed U.N. military observers were shot and wounded near 
A09  25 Mogadishu's port. Gunmen backed by three tanks attacked the port, 
A09  26 stealing 50 trucks, tons of food and 199 barrels of fuel, U.N. 
A09  27 officials said.<p/>
A09  28 <p_><quote_>"I consider this open aggression and provocation 
A09  29 against the United Nations,"<quote/> Mr. Sahnoun said.<p/>
A09  30 <p_>The first 500 U.N. troops, drawn from Pakistan, are not 
A09  31 expected for another two weeks and will be limited to Mogadishu.<p/>
A09  32 <p_><quote_>"We believe the 500 are enough,"<quote/> Abdulkarem Ali 
A09  33 Ahmed, secretary-general of General Aidid's United Somali Congress, 
A09  34 told The Associated Press on Saturday. <quote_>"Let's see if that 
A09  35 works before we talk about larger numbers."<quote/><p/>
A09  36 <p_>General Aidid's forces occupy the southern half of Mogadishu 
A09  37 and much of the southwest of the country. Their main rival is Ali 
A09  38 Mahdi Mohammed, who holds the title of interim president but 
A09  39 controls only a small section of northern Mogadishu.<p/>
A09  40 <p_>General Aidid's militia fears that a large U.N. presence would 
A09  41 amount to an occupying force recognizing Mr. Ali Mahdi's claim to 
A09  42 be president. It has requested that instead of troops, the United 
A09  43 Nations send money and other resources to rebuild Somalia's police 
A09  44 force.<p/>
A09  45 <p_>Mr. Sahnoun acknowledged that the United Nations would have to 
A09  46 win General Aidid's support before sending additional soldiers. It 
A09  47 took months of talks before General Aidid accepted the first 500 
A09  48 peacekeepers.<p/>
A09  49 <p_>A senior aid worker said in Nairobi, Kenya, that there probably 
A09  50 would be problems if the fighting factions did not agree. The 
A09  51 worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to the 
A09  52 bloodshed and raid at the Mogadishu port.<p/>
A09  53 <p_><quote_>"We support any security effort to protect our 
A09  54 workers,"<quote/> said Dennis Walto of the Los Angeles-based 
A09  55 International Medical Corps, which has worked in Somalia for the 
A09  56 last 10 months. <quote_>"But we're all kind of holding our 
A09  57 breath."<quote/><p/>
A09  58 <p_>Somalia dissolved into anarchy after rebels overthrew dictator 
A09  59 Mohammed Siad Barre in January 1991. Some aid officials estimate as 
A09  60 much as half of the more than 110,000 tons of food delivered since 
A09  61 the beginning of the year has been looted. Thousands of people are 
A09  62 dying daily from the combined effects of drought and clan 
A09  63 warfare.<p/>
A09  64 <p_>The U.S. airlift into Somalia began Friday with four planes and 
A09  65 a total of 37 tons of food to Belet Huen, on the border with 
A09  66 Ethiopia.<p/>
A09  67 <p_>On Saturday, three U.S. C-130 Hercules cargo planes delivered 
A09  68 about 30 tons of rice, beans and cooking oil to Belet Huen. A 
A09  69 fourth plane was grounded by maintenance difficulties, said Army 
A09  70 Lt. Col. Robert Donnelly, 43, of Suffern, N.Y.<p/>
A09  71 <p_>The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been 
A09  72 caring for Belet Huen's starving since early this year, estimates 
A09  73 about 200,000 people in and around Belet Huen need help.<p/>
A09  74 <p_>One ton of food will feed about 2,200 people for one day. It 
A09  75 would take nearly 700 tons of food a day just to feed all of the 
A09  76 Somalis in immediate danger of starvation; the Red Cross' relief 
A09  77 effort is getting about 22,000 tons of food a month into the 
A09  78 country.<p/>
A09  79 <p_>The United States also has delivered 1,350 tons of food on 77 
A09  80 flights to the northeastern Kenyan town of Wajir since starting the 
A09  81 airlift Aug. 21.<p/>
A09  82 <p_>The United Nations has been criticized for responding too 
A09  83 slowly to Somalia's crisis. On Saturday, the British aid group Save 
A09  84 the Children charged that thousands of lives are being needlessly 
A09  85 lost in Somalia because the United Nations has failed to provide 
A09  86 effective leadership.<p/>

A09  89 <p_>Thousands protest neo-Nazi terror<p/>
A09  90 <p_>ASSOCIATED PRESS<p/><h/>
A09  91 <p_>Rostock, Germany - Extremists rampaged near refugee shelters 
A09  92 and attacked foreigners across eastern Germany on Saturday in an 
A09  93 apparent widening of right-wing terror.<p/>
A09  94 <p_>Police and media reports said clashes occurred in at least 10 
A09  95 cities and towns, including Rostock during a march to show 
A09  96 solidarity with foreign asylum-seekers. Similar marches were held 
A09  97 in Bonn and the university city of Marburg to protest the rise of 
A09  98 neo-Nazi violence.<p/>
A09  99 <p_>About 13,000 leftists, residents, foreigners and others held an 
A09 100 anti-extremist rally outside the refugee shelter in Rostock, where 
A09 101 the riots began last week. One banner read <quote_>"Youth Against 
A09 102 Racism in Europe"<quote/> with a red fist smashing a swastika; 
A09 103 others said <quote_>"Never Again Hitler"<quote/> and <quote_>"Nazis 
A09 104 Out."<quote/><p/>
A09 105 <p_>About 3,000 police and border troops patrolled the city, and 
A09 106 there were several clashes with local residents. Organizers said 
A09 107 the demonstration was delayed by police searching cars and busses 
A09 108 for weapons.<p/>
A09 109 <p_><quote_>"Foreigners stay! Kick out the Nazis! Never again 
A09 110 Auschwitz!"<quote/> the protesters chanted as they began marching 
A09 111 through the Lichtenhagen district. They shouted back at a man in 
A09 112 black leather who raised his right arm in a Hitler salute and 
A09 113 shouted <quote|><foreign|>"Heil!" five times from behind a wall of 
A09 114 police with riot shields.<p/>
A09 115 <p_>There were sporadic clashes between marchers and neo-Nazis in 
A09 116 Rostock, but there were no immediate reports of injuries.<p/>
A09 117 <h_><p_>A flood of asylum-seekers<p/><h/>
A09 118 <p_>The anti-foreigner violence is evidence of the growing 
A09 119 resentment toward the foreigners who are flooding into the country, 
A09 120 especially in economically depressed former East Germany. German 
A09 121 Chancellor Helmut Kohl has acknowledged that authorities will have 
A09 122 to stem the flow of asylum-seekers to keep the discontent in 
A09 123 check.<p/>
A09 124 <p_>Before the Rostock riots began, residents had complained of 
A09 125 unsanitary, crowded conditions at the city's refugee shelter.<p/>
A09 126 <p_>Police across Germany were on alert Saturday after reporting 
A09 127 overnight disturbances involving rightists and refugees. Germany's 
A09 128 ZDF television said the anti-foreigner violence had spread to 10 
A09 129 towns and cities, many in former East Germany.<p/>
A09 130 <p_>In Spremberg, police said 15 skinheads threw stones at asylum 
A09 131 seekers and beat up a Pakistani refugee.<p/>
A09 132 <p_>In Griefswald<&|>sic!, right-wing extremists attacked a home 
A09 133 for refugees, breaking several windows, and four extremists were 
A09 134 arrested, police said. No injuries were reported.<p/>
A09 135 <p_>In Cottbus, about 200 right-wingers tried to attack a home for 
A09 136 refugees, but an estimated 300 police officers drove them back, 
A09 137 authorities said.<p/>
A09 138 <p_>In Oschersleben, 70 miles west of Berlin, about 40 radicals 
A09 139 armed with clubs tried to storm a refugee shelter that had been hit 
A09 140 by a firebomb the night before, but police thwarted the attack.<p/>
A09 141 <p_>A second night of violence also was reported in Stendal, where 
A09 142 rightists armed with baseball bats and firebombs sought to storm 
A09 143 the local refugee shelter.<p/>
A09 144 <p_>Other trouble was reported in the eastern German communities of 
A09 145 Soemmerda, Eisenach and Luebbenau.<p/>
A09 146 <p_>Police in the western German town of Bad Lauterberg in the Harz 
A09 147 Mountains said a refugee shelter there was hit by a 
A09 148 fire<?_>-<?/>bomb overnight. No one was injured.<p/>
A09 149 <h_><p_>Rampant anger, frustration<p/><h/>
A09 150 <p_>The extreme rightists who rampaged in Rostock appeared to 
A09 151 include skinheads, neo-Nazis and aimless young people at the center 
A09 152 of the anger and frustration rampant in eastern Germany.<p/>
A09 153 <p_>Many of the leftists come from what is known as the 
A09 154 'alternative scene' that thrives in major German cities. They 
A09 155 include students, squatters and those benefiting from Germany's 
A09 156 generous welfare programs.<p/>
A09 157 <p_>Among the marchers Saturday were hard-core leftist street 
A09 158 fighters known as <foreign|>'autonomen,' or the autonomous, who 
A09 159 often battle with police over issues including squatters' rights 
A09 160 and opposition to extreme rightist rallies.<p/>
A09 161 <p_><quote_>"Racism is growing, and we're trying to do something 
A09 162 against it,"<quote/> said one marcher from Berlin, who identified 
A09 163 himself only as Martin. He said the leftists want a safe climate in 
A09 164 Germany for refugees and others.<p/>
A09 165 <p_>Rostock resident Fred Grosser, 28, a member of the Party for 
A09 166 Democratic Socialism, the former Communist Party, claimed that 
A09 167 local officials were trying to discourage the anti-racism 
A09 168 protest.<p/>
A09 169 <p_><quote_>"We decided to protest against the violent actions here 
A09 170 in the past week,"<quote/> said Mr. Grosser, whose party sent 
A09 171 several national leaders to the demonstration.<p/>
A09 172 <p_>State and local officials have come under biting criticism for 
A09 173 failing to cope with the violence.<p/>

A09 175 <h_><p_>More cuts in military expected<p/>
A09 176 <p_>Pentagon plans foresee bigger hit<p/>
A09 177 <p_>NEW YORK TIMES<p/><h/>
A09 178 <p_>Washington - Anticipating that steeper cuts in future military 
A09 179 spending are inevitable, the Pentagon is quietly preparing to 
A09 180 reduce its forces below the lowest levels the Bush administration 
A09 181 has said would be acceptable, senior Defense Department officials 
A09 182 say.<p/>
A09 183 <p_>The cuts, which would affect fundamental military programs - 
A09 184 including troops, weapons purchases, and military bases - could 
A09 185 free as much as $80 billion in military spending by 1997 for use in 
A09 186 other domestic programs.<p/>
A09 187 <p_>No decisions have been made on the deeper reductions, and none 
A09 188 are likely until after the election in November. Officially, the 
A09 189 military services are complying with a budget-review process this 
A09 190 summer that requires them to submit long-range plans meant to 
A09 191 conform with the Pentagon's strategic outline for a post-Cold War 
A09 192 world.<p/>
A09 193 <p_>These classified plans, copies of which were obtained by The 
A09 194 New York Times, assume a continuation of the Bush administration's 
A09 195 'base force' of 1.6 million uniformed troops through the late 
A09 196 1990s, as outlined by the Pentagon in the summer of 1990. Among the 
A09 197 plans' proposals that are likely to generate debate is placing 
A09 198 land-based Marine Corps aircraft on Navy carriers and assigning Air 
A09 199 Force bomber pilot jobs to reservists.<p/>
A09 200 <p_>But senior Defense Department officials privately acknowledge 
A09 201 that they consider many details of these plans already out of date. 
A09 202 Regardless of the political outcome in November, they say, the 
A09 203 military budget is going to have to take a bigger hit than the 
A09 204 administration has publicly proposed. The services probably will 
A09 205 have to rewrite much of their budgets after November before 
A09 206 submitting them early next year, these officials say.<p/>
A09 207 <p_><quote_>"Most people believe that whether Bush or Clinton is 
A09 208 elected, the cut will be the same,"<quote/> said one senior 
A09 209 Pentagon official. <quote_>"The only difference will be that with 
A09 210 Clinton it'll come faster, and with Bush it'll be 
A09 211 slower."<quote/><p/>
A09 212 <p_>Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton said last week 
A09 213 that his proposed military budget over the next five years would be 
A09 214 only 5 percent less than President Bush's, but that he would make 
A09 215 deeper cuts in the number of American troops based in Europe and in 
A09 216 the Strategic Defense Initiative anti-ballistic missile system.<p/>
A09 217 <p_>Last year, the Pentagon confronted similar budget pressures, 
A09 218 and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
A09 219 chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ordered a comprehensive 
A09 220 review of future military needs. As a result, the Pentagon canceled 
A09 221 several expensive weapons, such as the B-2 bomber and the Seawolf 
A09 222 submarine, to avoid deeper troop cuts.<p/>
A09 223 <p_>This time, military planners say they are reluctantly looking 
A09 224 at shrinking the size of the overall force itself. They say 
A09 225 projected military spending simply will not cover the costs 
A09 226 required to equip, train and maintain the troops and accompanying 
A09 227 ships, aircraft and ground units called for in the long-range 
A09 228 budgets.<p/>
A09 229 <p_><quote_>"Today's fiscal environment shows no sign of being 
A09 230 cyclical in nature,"<quote/> said the Navy's long-range planning 
A09 231 document. <quote_>"Reversal of current projected resource 
A09 232 reductions is not foreseen."<quote/><p/>
A09 233 <p_>One senior Army official elaborated, saying, <quote_>"No one 
A09 234 believes we'll have these numbers to play with. You won't see a 
A09 235 $280 billion defense budget in the future. It'll be more like $250 
A09 236 billion or $240 billion, or lower."<quote/><p/>
A09 237 <p_>The Pentagon's budget for this fiscal year was $291 billion.<p/>
A09 238 <p_>The administration publicly continues to resist cuts beyond 
A09 239 those envisioned by current Pentagon plans: a 25 percent reduction 
A09 240 in forces by 1995. Under that base-force plan, the Navy would have 
A09 241 12 aircraft carriers, the Air Force 15 tactical air wings and the 
A09 242 Army 12 active-duty divisions.<p/>

A10  10 <p_>But in a political year filled with strange twists and irony, 
A10  11 it is perhaps fitting that Clinton enters the campaign's stretch 
A10  12 run facing this irony: Many of his strenghts are also potential 
A10  13 weaknesses.<p/>
A10  14 <p_>He is a polished politician, but he is running in a year when 
A10  15 voters are tired of politics and politicians as usual.<p/>
A10  16 <p_>The details that Clinton rattles off often impress voters. But 
A10  17 they also give ammunition to critics who cast Clinton as a 
A10  18 politician promising all things to all people.<p/>
A10  19 <p_>As he tries to persuade voters to trust him in the White House 
A10  20 at a time of domestic distress and global change, Clinton cannot 
A10  21 escape the contrast of a baby-boomer, small-state governor up 
A10  22 against a man with one of the longest government resumes in 
A10  23 American political history.<p/>
A10  24 <p_>Nor can he avoid the comparison that voters will make between 
A10  25 men who went in opposite directions during the wars of their 
A10  26 generations.<p/>
A10  27 <p_>Here's a look at Clinton's areas of strength and weakness:<p/>
A10  28 <h|>STRENGTHS
A10  29 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>The economy. Bad news is good news for Clinton, 
A10  30 and there has been no end to reports detailing an economy stuck in 
A10  31 a rut, with growth slower than at any time since World War II.<p/>
A10  32 <p_><quote_>"Clinton is seen as caring much more about average 
A10  33 people than George Bush, and he is seen as being much better 
A10  34 prepared to provide leadership for economic change,"<quote/> 
A10  35 Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin said.<p/>
A10  36 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>A focus on domestic issues. Clinton has offered a 
A10  37 long list of proposals, although some are more framework than 
A10  38 programs. He has plans to create jobs by building roads, bridges 
A10  39 and communications infrastucture; to povide universal access to 
A10  40 apprenticeship programs and college for high-school graduates; to 
A10  41 provide basic health care to all Americans; and to shift money from 
A10  42 defense into new civilian research and jobs.<p/>
A10  43 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Youth. Just turned 46, Clinton projects himself 
A10  44 as the personification of voter yearnings for change and new 
A10  45 leadership.<p/>
A10  46 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Al Gore. Reaction to Clinton's choice of the 
A10  47 Tennessee senator as his running mate has been overwhelmingly 
A10  48 positive, with Gore seen by voters as a far superior pick than 
A10  49 Bush's choice of Dan Quayle. Gore brings to the ticket 
A10  50 environmental, foreign-policy and arms-control credentials that 
A10  51 Clinton lacks, helps the ticket in the South and reinforces the 
A10  52 Democrats' generational theme.<p/>
A10  53 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Political skills. Unlike Michael Dukakis four 
A10  54 years ago, Clinton responds quickly and sharply when attacked. More 
A10  55 importantly, he tries to play offense by constantly going after 
A10  56 Bush.<p/>
A10  57 <p_><quote_>"We're up against a tough customer here,"<quote/> GOP 
A10  58 strategist Haley Barbour said.<p/>
A10  59 <h|>WEAKNESSES
A10  60 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Inexperience. This is the flip side to the 
A10  61 benefits of youth. Clinton's work over 20 years in Arkansas, even 
A10  62 if viewed favorably, cannot match Bush's lengthy resume of service 
A10  63 in national and international affairs.<p/>
A10  64 <p_><quote_>"Who do you trust to make change work for you?"<quote/> 
A10  65 is a favorite Bush line aimed at exploiting Clinton's inexperience 
A10  66 on the national stage and absence of foreign-policy credentials.<p/>
A10  67 <p_>A senior Clinton strategist, who spoke on condition of 
A10  68 anonymity, said, <quote_>"His biggest weakness is that he is so new 
A10  69 to so much of the general electorate."<quote/><p/>
A10  70 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>The draft controversy. The debate over whether 
A10  71 Clinton has been candid in discussing how he avoided the Vietnam 
A10  72 draft could feed critics' portrayals of Clinton as slick and 
A10  73 untrustworthy.<p/>
A10  74 <p_><quote_>"Whether he did or did not go isn't fair game,"<quote/> 
A10  75 said South Carolina GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell, a key Bush ally. 
A10  76 <quote_>"But his veracity is fair game."<quote/><p/>
A10  77 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Promises, promises. Clinton has promised to be a 
A10  78 real education president, real environmental president, a true 
A10  79 friend of veterans, of senior citizens and of middle-class families 
A10  80 needing help with health care and college money. He is vulnerable 
A10  81 to charges that he is promising far more than the nation can afford 
A10  82 at a time of record deficits.<p/>
A10  83 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Being a Democrat. Although Clinton has led 
A10  84 efforts to moderate his party, most voters don't know that. 
A10  85 Republicans are quick to compare Clinton to Dukakis, Walter Mondale 
A10  86 and Jimmy Carter.<p/>
A10  87 <p_><quote_>"He has to overcome all the bad things people associate 
A10  88 with Democrats, whether they apply to him or not,"<quote/> Clinton 
A10  89 spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said.<p/>
A10  90 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Arkansas. Clinton can point to some remarkable 
A10  91 progress in his state, particularly in education and recent 
A10  92 economic growth. Still, Arkansas has been among the nation's 
A10  93 poorest states for decades and ranks near the bottom in many 
A10  94 statistical analyses, giving Republicans ample ammunition as they 
A10  95 try to paint Clinton as 'the failed governor of a small state.'<p/>

A10  97 <h_><p_>GEORGE BUSH<p/>
A10  98 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Foreign-affairs whiz judged back home as a 
A10  99 man without a stand<p/>
A10 100 <p_>By Terence Hunt<p/>
A10 101 <p_>The Associated Press<p/><h/>
A10 102 <p_>WASHINGTON - There's no mystery about Geroge Bush. He's the 
A10 103 broccoli-hating, dog-loving, war-winning president who wants to 
A10 104 devote the same energy to America's problems that he's applied to 
A10 105 crises overseas.<p/>
A10 106 <p_>But wait, look again.<p/>
A10 107 <p_>He's the read-my-lips promise breaker, tax hiker, status quo 
A10 108 defender and protector of the wealthy, a leader more interested in 
A10 109 the economic distress of Russians than the misery of unemployed 
A10 110 Americans.<p/>
A10 111 <p_>One man, two distinctly different judgments. It depends, in 
A10 112 part, on the political prism you use.<p/>
A10 113 <p_>Yet, after more than a quarter of a century in politics and 
A10 114 nearly 12 years at the White House, Bush has a record of 
A10 115 achievements and failures, a history that can be examined and 
A10 116 assessed.<p/>
A10 117 <p_>A quick appraisal: strong on foreign policy, weak on domestic 
A10 118 affairs. That's the verdict which repeatedly emerges from the 
A10 119 polls. Also evident is an underlying finding that nearly 80 percent 
A10 120 of Americans think that the nation's on the wrong track.<p/>
A10 121 <p_>Here's a look at the president's record:<p/>
A10 122 <h|>STRENGTHS
A10 123 <p_>Bush has arguably the most impressive resume in Washington: 
A10 124 Yale grad, war veteran, Texas oil man, congressman, ambassador to 
A10 125 the United Nations, chairman of the Republican Party, envoy to 
A10 126 China, chief of the CIA, vice president and president. Ready to 
A10 127 lead from Day 1, he boasted.<p/>
A10 128 <p_>In Bush's view, it comes down to a simple question: Who do you 
A10 129 want sitting in the Oval Office? Who's got the temperament, the 
A10 130 experience, to make the tough decisions in a crisis?<p/>
A10 131 <p_>Sure, he paid a lot of attention to foreign policy in his first 
A10 132 3 1/2 years in office, Bush acknowledges. But children don't have 
A10 133 to hide under their school desks anymore in drills preparing for a 
A10 134 nuclear attack.<p/>
A10 135 <p_><quote_>"I saw the chance to rid our children's dreams of the 
A10 136 nuclear nightmare and I did,"<quote/> Bush says.<p/>
A10 137 <p_>Bush crams a lot of history into his foreign-policy portfolio: 
A10 138 The Berlin Wall fell on his watch, and Germany was reunited. The 
A10 139 Soviet Union collapsed, and communism died in Eastern Europe.<p/>
A10 140 <p_><quote_>"The Cold War is over, and we won,"<quote/> Bush says, 
A10 141 wrapping himself in the cloak of triumph.<p/>
A10 142 <p_>When Saddam Hussein's troops stormed into Kuwait, Bush rallied 
A10 143 world leaders and forced Iraq to withdraw. Those were the glory 
A10 144 days, when Bush's popularity ratings hit a record 90 percent. He 
A10 145 seemed unbeatable.<p/>
A10 146 <p_>When critics ask what he's done at home, Bush points to 
A10 147 enactment of a sweeping Clean Air Act Bill, although the 
A10 148 administration has failed to complete dozens of regulations to put 
A10 149 the law into effect; a landmark Civil Rights Act, which Bush signed 
A10 150 a year after vetoing a similar measure; and the 'America 2000' 
A10 151 movement to spur fundamental changes in the nation's classrooms.<p/>
A10 152 <p_>Bush's biggest strength, Republican strategist Eddie Mahe says, 
A10 153 is that <quote_>"Americans sense he really is a decent human being. 
A10 154 People really have a sense that he is a quality person who is 
A10 155 basically driven by pretty decent instincts and motivations. 
A10 156 Barbara Bush is a real strength of his."<quote/><p/>
A10 157 <h|>WEAKNESSES
A10 158 <p_>What does Bush stand for? What does he believe in? He has 
A10 159 flip-flopped on everything from abortion to 'voodoo economics.' In 
A10 160 the 1960s, he was against civil-rights and open-housing legislation 
A10 161 and then voted for the 1968 Fair Housing Act. As president, he 
A10 162 promised that there would be no net loss of the nation's swamps, 
A10 163 marshes and other wetlands, but then he endorsed a plan that would 
A10 164 allow development on tens of millions of acres, including parts of 
A10 165 the Florida Everglades.<p/>

A10 167 <h_><p_>Bush, Clinton TV spots focus on economy<p/>
A10 168 <p_>President blames Congress, foe vows jobs package<p/>
A10 169 <p_>By John King<p/>
A10 170 <p_>The Associated Press<p/><h/>
A10 171 <p_>President Bush and Bill Clinton competed on national television 
A10 172 Sunday for voters' trust to revive the anemic economy, the Democrat 
A10 173 promising a jobs package as his first move and Bush blaming 
A10 174 sluggish economic growth on <quote_>"the gridlock Congress"<quote/> 
A10 175 blocking his recovery plan.<p/>
A10 176 <p_>Both also were questioned about past actions that could prove a 
A10 177 major factor in the campaign. And both said they expected debates, 
A10 178 although Bush again shied away from a three-debate plan Clinton 
A10 179 said he has accepted.<p/>
A10 180 <p_>For Clinton, the nagging episode from his past was his 
A10 181 avoidance of the draft during the Vietnam War. For Bush, the 
A10 182 subject was new questions about his knowledge of the Reagan 
A10 183 administration's alleged arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran.<p/>
A10 184 <p_>But as it does on the campaign trail, the economy dominated the 
A10 185 debate as Clinton and Bush appeared for rare, live 10-minute 
A10 186 back-to-back interviews on an NBC election special.<p/>
A10 187 <p_><quote_>"Pass a jobs program,"<quote/> Clinton said in listing 
A10 188 his first priority if elected.<p/>
A10 189 <p_>Controlling health-care costs would be second, he said.<p/>
A10 190 <p_><quote_>"I don't pretend that it is going to be easy or 
A10 191 quick,"<quote/> the Arkansas governor said. Still, <quote_>"We can 
A10 192 cut (the deficit) in half in the next four years if we have real 
A10 193 discipline."<quote/><p/>
A10 194 <p_>Bush said he believes the majority of Americans are better off 
A10 195 now than they were four years ago, although he added, 
A10 196 <quote_>"Certainly, anyone who is out of work cannot say he is 
A10 197 better off."<quote/><p/>
A10 198 <p_>Still, Bush blamed the Democrat-controlled Congress for 
A10 199 refusing to pass a Bush administration package he said contained 
A10 200 the incentives businesses need to buy new equipment and hire more 
A10 201 workers.<p/>
A10 202 <p_><quote_>"What we're trying to do is turn things around and get 
A10 203 people back to work,"<quote/> Bush said in Michigan. <quote_>"The 
A10 204 gridlock Congress said, 'No.' ... I have been stymied in those 
A10 205 incentives and more by the Congress."<quote/><p/>
A10 206 <p_>The Labor Department last week said there were fewer 
A10 207 private-sector jobs in August than when Bush took office. But Bush 
A10 208 said he is <quote_>"not prepared to buy into those 
A10 209 statistics."<quote/><p/>
A10 210 <p_><quote_>"I'm not sure there are fewer people at work,"<quote/> 
A10 211 he said.<p/>
A10 212 <p_>Bush also sought to convey the sense that the economy, despite 
A10 213 recent government figures, is on the upswing.<p/>
A10 214 <p_><quote_>"I think things are getting better,"<quote/> he said. 
A10 215 <quote_>"We are poised for a strong recovery."<quote/><p/>
A10 216 <p_>When anchorman Tom Brokaw said Clinton's answers about his 
A10 217 draft status were <quote|>"inconsistent", Clinton retorted that he 
A10 218 had never changed his story, but added, <quote_>"Maybe I haven't 
A10 219 handled it as well as I should."<quote/><p/>
A10 220 <p_>Clinton said he did not know until earlier this year that an 
A10 221 uncle had lobbied to get him a spot in the Naval Reserve. Clinton 
A10 222 never took the slot, although he did briefly commit to an ROTC 
A10 223 program before putting his name into the draft when a lottery was 
A10 224 implemented.<p/>
A10 225 <p_>Much like Clinton on the draft, Bush brushed aside the notion 
A10 226 that his role in the Iran-contra scandal might become a 1992 
A10 227 presidential-campaign issue. Recent documents submitted in court 
A10 228 cases have suggested that Bush, Reagan's vice president, knew more 
A10 229 about the arms-for-hostage scandal than he has indicated.<p/>
A10 230 <p_><quote_>"If I had done anything wrong ... they would be all 
A10 231 over me like you can possibly imagine,"<quote/> Bush said.<p/>
A10 232 <p_>He called the revival of the issue <quote_>"a late smoke screen 
A10 233 ... I have nothing to explain."<quote/><p/>
A10 234 <p_>As for debates, Clinton said he accepts the plan of a 
A10 235 bipartisan panel to begin a three-debate series Sept. 22 in East 
A10 236 Lansing, Mich. But Bush said he is leaving the details to his 
A10 237 aides.<p/>
A10 238 <p_>Also in the program, NBC released a new poll showing Clinton 
A10 239 leading Bush 49 to 40 percent. The survey was taken Sept. 3-5 and 
A10 240 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.<p/>

A11   2 <p_>Mourning in America<p/>
A11   3 <p_>BY ANN McDANIEL<p/>
A11   4 <p_>With Clara Bingham on the road with Bush<p/><h/>
A11   5 <p_>It was a gesture familiar to Bush watchers. A sudden flick of 
A11   6 the lanky wrist, a quick glance down at the watch. George Bush 
A11   7 knows no angle of repose; he has been restless and fidgety, a man 
A11   8 in a hurry through his long political career. But last Thursday, 
A11   9 when Bush obviously and impatiently checked the time 
A11  10 half<?_>-<?/>way through the second presidential debate, some 80 
A11  11 million viewers could not help but read a larger meaning into a 
A11  12 familiar habit. It said: Outta time. Outta here.<p/>
A11  13 <p_>After 12 years, the Reagan-Bush revolution appears to be in its 
A11  14 Final Days. Staffers have not exactly draped black crepe over the 
A11  15 White House, but within the West Wing can be heard the whine of 
A11  16 axes grinding and the churn of Xerox machines cranking out 
A11  17 r<*_>e-acute<*/>sum<*_>e-acute<*/>s. Barring the greatest 
A11  18 performance in the history of presidential debates on Monday night, 
A11  19 the appearance of a terrible ghost from Bill Clinton's past, or an 
A11  20 act of God, George Bush seems fated to be a one<?_>-<?/>term 
A11  21 president. The Republican Party may not even make it to Election 
A11  22 Day before a period of mourning sets in.<p/>
A11  23 <p_>Before acceptance, of course, must come denial, anger and 
A11  24 depression. As he left the stage on Thursday, Bush gave a 
A11  25 less-than-gung-ho reply when a TV reporter asked him how he'd done. 
A11  26 <quote_>"I just don't know,"<quote/> he muttered. In a conversation 
A11  27 last week with an old and close friend, Bush grudgingly conceded 
A11  28 that his days in the Oval Office may be numbered, but he refused to 
A11  29 accept the blame for it. The timing was bad, he said. The recession 
A11  30 lasted too long. The cold war ended too soon. Anyways, he said, 
A11  31 there's still time. <quote_>"It's been a screwy year."<quote/><p/>
A11  32 <p_>That thin hope keeps Bush's inner core of top advisers 
A11  33 whistling as they pass the political graveyard. Pulling 
A11  34 all<?_>-<?/>nighters, they thought up snappy comeback lines for the 
A11  35 president, none of which Bush managed to use. (When Clinton pledged 
A11  36 to be the president of change, Bush was supposed to shoot back, 
A11  37 <quote_>"like you changed your story on avoiding the 
A11  38 draft?"<quote/>) Before the second debate, when tracking polls 
A11  39 showed a slight narrowing in the race, Bush campaign strategist 
A11  40 Charlie Black jauntily declared a return of the Big Mo. He 
A11  41 neglected to mention  a very big But: according to the Bush 
A11  42 campaign's own polling data, the gap between Bush and Clinton had 
A11  43 not closed in many key states. After Thursday night's fade-out, the 
A11  44 staffers were left grasping at an even flimsier document: a 
A11  45 fax<?_>-<?/>smudged advance copy of the December Penthouse, in 
A11  46 which Gennifer Flowers purports to detail her steamy love life with 
A11  47 Clinton. Even Bob Guccione, the Penthouse publisher, refused to 
A11  48 vouch for Flower's credibility.<p/>
A11  49 <p_>The only road left to the Bush campaign was the low one. Bush 
A11  50 advisers urged the president to shed his diffidence and come out 
A11  51 swinging against Clinton in the final debate. Dan Quayle had scored 
A11  52 with his harsh attacks on Clinton and Al Gore during the veep 
A11  53 debate, although the vice president appeared manic at times. 
A11  54 (Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales wrote that Quayle's 
A11  55 <quote_>"forced laugh was reminiscent of Richard Widmark's when he 
A11  56 played weirdos in films <foreign|>noir of the '40s."<quote/>) The 
A11  57 president's last campaign-ad buys will make the unsubtle point that 
A11  58 the president's opponent is a liar.<p/>
A11  59 <p_>Lower down in the Bush-Quayle campaign ranks, the blame game 
A11  60 has begun in earnest. <quote_>"It's like living the 'Lord of the 
A11  61 Flies',"<quote/> said a staffer. <quote_>"We haven't been able to 
A11  62 eat Bill Clinton so we've begun eating each other."<quote/> While 
A11  63 staffers were not sending out their <tf_>curricula vitae<tf/> over 
A11  64 the White House fax machines, they were sticking pins in the 
A11  65 already deflated reputations of Bush's former chiefs of staff. It 
A11  66 was all John Sununu's fault, some argued. He foolishly thought the 
A11  67 president could surf back into office on his gulf-war surge. No, it 
A11  68 was Sam Skinner's, said others. The former transportation secretary 
A11  69 couldn't organize a car pool. The one person everyone could agree 
A11  70 to trash was Richard Darman. The wily budget director had given his 
A11  71 best friend, Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, a self-serving 
A11  72 account of the Bush administration's failure to manage the economy. 
A11  73 The plot of the four-part series was: Darman tried to do the right 
A11  74 thing, but low-rent pols (Jim Baker, the president) stopped him. 
A11  75 Staffers jokingly put a Bush-Quayle sticker on Darman's Mercedes, 
A11  76 to remind him whom he was voting for, and yukked it up over a 
A11  77 Christopher Buckley parody in The Wall Street Journal of Darman's 
A11  78 memoirs, entitled 'A Legend in His Own Mind.' One cabinet secretary 
A11  79 was more blunt. The only way Bush could repay Darman, he said, was 
A11  80 to buy 30 minutes of TV time, take Darman on stage and shoot 
A11  81 him.<p/>
A11  82 <p_>Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, only Jim Baker has escaped 
A11  83 universal scorn from the staff. The president's best friend has 
A11  84 obviously failed to play miracle worker in his latest role as chief 
A11  85 of staff and campaign czar, but most aides shurg that the patient 
A11  86 was too far gone by the time Baker arrived in late August. Baker 
A11  87 does have bitter critics in the office of Vice President Quayle. 
A11  88 The veep's aides accuse Baker of a lack of boldness; Baker 
A11  89 loyalists scoff that the Quaylemen are just sore because they have 
A11  90 been cut out of the loop.<p/>
A11  91 <p_>Inside the First Family, depression has sunk in. Friends say 
A11  92 that George W., Bush's eldest son, and the president's daughter, 
A11  93 Doro, are particularly low over their father's apparent demise. 
A11  94 When George Bush announced in the debate that his wife, Barbara, 
A11  95 probably could have won the election but it was <quote_>"too 
A11  96 late,"<quote/> the First Lady wore an expression on her face that 
A11  97 must have reflected her true feelings 44 years ago when her husband 
A11  98 announced that they were moving from Connecticut to Midland, 
A11  99 Texas.<p/>
A11 100 <p_>In his public moods, the president himself alternates between 
A11 101 the odd passivity he showed in the debates and flailing on the 
A11 102 campaign trail. Hoarse and tired after the Thursday debate, his 
A11 103 syntax a shambles, Bush laced into Clinton for evading the draft at 
A11 104 a sparsely attended rally at Middlesex County College in Edison, 
A11 105 N.J. For good measure, he also denounced a group of hecklers, most 
A11 106 of whom were not even born during Vietnam War, as <quote_>"draft 
A11 107 dodgers."<quote/><p/>
A11 108 <p_>But that is the sad and angry side of Bush. There is also a 
A11 109 stoic and strong Bush, and he showed himself in a private 
A11 110 conversation with a friend last week. He hadn't decided where to 
A11 111 live if he lost the election, he said. But <quote_>"if it happens, 
A11 112 it happens. There's life after this, and a damn good life."<quote/> 
A11 113 Bush could decide to go out with dignity - and leave the last 
A11 114 assaults to surrogates. More likely, he will follow the 
A11 115 rough-and-tumble code of the schoolboy and play hard to the end.<p/>

A11 119 <p_>For 48 hours last week, Ross Perot was on a roll. He won the 
A11 120 first presidential debate. His 'infomercial' - a kind of 
A11 121 truth-or-dare on the economy - drew high ratings. Washington 
A11 122 pundits speculated on whether he could take off and perhaps affect 
A11 123 the outcome of the presidential race. Then, in a condensed version 
A11 124 of last spring and summer, the latest flirtation with Perot bumped 
A11 125 up against reality. Perot's running mate, Adm. James B. Stockdale, 
A11 126 faltered in the vice presidential debate, reminding voters of the 
A11 127 improbability of their ticket. By the time Perot left the stage 
A11 128 after the second presidential debate in Richmond, there was no 
A11 129 pretending. Though he inched up in <tf|>Newsweek's Poll, he had 
A11 130 about as much chance of being elected the next president as 
A11 131 Madonna.<p/>
A11 132 <p_>Maybe Perot has been telling the truth all along, that he 
A11 133 doesn't really want to be president. What counts is his reputation, 
A11 134 which was sorely damaged after his abrupt withdrawal from the race 
A11 135 last July. He is spending millions on TV ads so he can look into 
A11 136 the shaving mirror and not see a quitter. Perot's one-liners on the 
A11 137 economy are beginning to sound like a stand-up comedy routine; he 
A11 138 needs new material. But by focusing attention on the deficit, Perot 
A11 139 has helped elevate the last stage of a race that might otherwise 
A11 140 have been preoccupied entirely with mudslinging.<p/>
A11 141 <p_>Perot has been a reluctant warrior for his own program. He 
A11 142 could have avoided criticism of his second debate performance if he 
A11 143 had gone beyond one-liners to stress solutions. In his latest 
A11 144 infomercial Perot's sober twin emerges. Grim-faced, he urges 
A11 145 further taxing of social-security benefits, higher Medicare 
A11 146 premiums and increased gasoline taxes. Yet with the exception of 
A11 147 the gas tax (50 cents a gallon over five years), he glides over his 
A11 148 proposals so quickly that they get lost in the shuffle of pie 
A11 149 charts and bar graphs. He spends little time bracing those who will 
A11 150 lose benefits. This is Stone Age television, yet it is oddly 
A11 151 riveting. Perot sits at a desk with a 'voodoo stick' pointer, a 
A11 152 play on voodoo economics, while the charts pile up along with the 
A11 153 bad news.<p/>
A11 154 <p_>Perot must be wondering what might have been had he not acted 
A11 155 so impetuously last July. Only three weeks before he withdrew, some 
A11 156 polls showed him leading in a three-way race. <tf|>Newsweek has 
A11 157 learned that Perot flew to Washington at that time, undetected by 
A11 158 the press, to meet with Dr. Bernadine Healy, head of the National 
A11 159 Institutes of Health, who he had hoped would be his running mate. 
A11 160 (Stockdale was meant to be a stand-in.) Healy, a Republican and a 
A11 161 Bush appointee, ultimately turned him down. But as Stockdale 
A11 162 struggled on the stage to hold his own last week, the thought of 
A11 163 Healy - a brilliant heart specialist and an articulate advocate for 
A11 164 women's health issues - must have given Perot a what-if pang.<p/>
A11 165 <p_>With his re-entry into the race, Perot is trying to recapture 
A11 166 those heady early days when the faithful treated him like a rock 
A11 167 star. But running for office takes more than revving up volunteers. 
A11 168 <quote_>"Dad is on a very steep learning curve on how to be a 
A11 169 politician,"<quote/> says Ross Perot Jr. If the cold war were not 
A11 170 over, Perot would never have been taken seriously as a candidate: 
A11 171 his mercurial temperament would have labeled him as someone who 
A11 172 could not be trusted with his finger on the button. Even so, Perot 
A11 173 can still play a leadership role in the economic battles of the 
A11 174 '90s: his warnings about the deficit may make it easier for the 
A11 175 next president to get the country to swallow some tough economic 
A11 176 medicine.<p/>

A11 178 <h_><p_>Welcome to 1993<p/>
A11 179 <p_>Forget the struggles over Maastricht. Europe's Single Market 
A11 180 will change the world.<p/>
A11 181 <p_>By Scott Sullivan<p/><h/>
A11 182 <p_>Europe is dying, Europe is dying, Europe is practically dead. 
A11 183 Its vaunted exchange-rate mechanism lies in tatters. The pound 
A11 184 sterling, the lira and the peseta have dropped like stones. Britain 
A11 185 wallows in its longest postwar recession. French economic growth is 
A11 186 slowing, and France's president has cancer. Italy faces the worst 
A11 187 labor disturbances in decades. Even mighty Germany is hard up for 
A11 188 cash. The Maastricht Treaty on European political and monetary 
A11 189 union looks like a goner. Not for years has the European scene 
A11 190 looked so bleak. And yet, the Old Continent is on the verge of 
A11 191 accomplishing its most spectacular feat ever - the creation of a 
A11 192 vast 'frontierless' economic space with 360 million consumers and a 
A11 193 combined GNP of $6.5 trillion.<p/>
A11 194 <p_>On Jan. 1, 1993, the Single Market - or most of it - will come 
A11 195 into effect. Henceforward, travelers within the 12-nation European 
A11 196 Community and the seven-nation European Free Trade Association will 
A11 197 travel without passports or visas throughout a vast European 
A11 198 Economic Space. Internal customs duties will disappear. Trucks will 
A11 199 carry no special documents. Physiotherapists, architects and 
A11 200 students will be able to practice or study anywhere in the Single 
A11 201 Market on the basis of degrees they earned at home. Builders and 
A11 202 telephone suppliers will bid for public contracts on equal terms in 
A11 203 all 19 countries. Insurance companies and banks can establish 
A11 204 branches anywhere in the area.<p/>

A12   2 <p_>Dan Quayle's wacky attack on TV's Murphy Brown character 
A12   3 obscures a serious discussion about motherhood, morality and 
A12   4 government's responsibility<p/>
A12   5 <p_>By LANCE MORROW<p/>
A12   6 <p_>With reporting by Tom Curry and Georgia Harbison/ New 
A12   7 York<p/><h/>
A12   8 <p_>AMERICANS TALKED ABOUT IT in coffee shops and check-out lines 
A12   9 and elevators. In the Rose Garden of the White House, George Bush 
A12  10 stood with Brian Mulroney, trying to hold a press conference about 
A12  11 matters of state. The hounds of the press frisked and barked in 
A12  12 excitement until their intermingled questions sounded something 
A12  13 like <tf_>Murf! Murf! Murf!<tf/><p/>
A12  14 <p_>The Prime Minister of Canada turned to the President of the 
A12  15 U.S. and asked in some puzzlement, <quote_>"Who is Murphy 
A12  16 Brown?"<quote/><p/>
A12  17 <p_>The basic answer was easy: Murphy Brown does not exist. She is 
A12  18 the TV character played by Candice Bergen. Murphy is a blond media 
A12  19 anchor-goddess and wise<?_>-<?/>guy and now a defiantly unmarried 
A12  20 madonna. In last week's episode she delivered a baby boy - the boy 
A12  21 being played by a seven-week-old girl named Danica Fascella. (A 
A12  22 perfect Murphy Brown, post<?_>-<?/>Quayle touch: Danica and her 
A12  23 twin Cynthia were conceived in vitro and carried to term by a 
A12  24 surrogate mother.) In triumphant autonomy, Murphy will raise the 
A12  25 child as a single parent.<p/>
A12  26 <p_>But an outpouring of emotion and opinion about Murphy Brown has 
A12  27 proved to be unexpectedly interesting and bizarre. A Murphy Brown 
A12  28 debate has gone layering up through a dozen levels of American life 
A12  29 - political, moral, cultural, racial, even metaphysical. The 
A12  30 exercise has seemed amazingly stupid, obscurely degrading and 
A12  31 somehow important at the same time.<p/>
A12  32 <p_>Vice President Dan Quayle precipitated it. He and Murphy Brown 
A12  33 collaborated in one of those vivid, strange electronic moral 
A12  34 pageants, like the Thomas-Hill hearings, that are becoming a new 
A12  35 American form. This is national theater: surreal, spontaneous, 
A12  36 mixing off-hours pop culture with high political meanings, public 
A12  37 behavior with private conscience, making history up with tabloids 
A12  38 and television personalities like Oprah Winfrey. The trivial gets 
A12  39 aggrandized, the biggest themes cheapened. America degenerates into 
A12  40 a TV comedy - and yet Americans end up thinking in new ways about 
A12  41 some larger matters. The little television screen, the bright and 
A12  42 flat and often moronic medium of these spectacles, works in strange 
A12  43 disproportions of cause and effect: often, in wild disconnections 
A12  44 of cause and effect, video Dada.<p/>
A12  45 <p_>Quayle was in San Francisco, market<?_>-<?/>testing a line of 
A12  46 traditional-values rhetoric for more elaborate use as the 
A12  47 presidential campaign progresses. The Los Angeles riots were still 
A12  48 flickering on the edges of everyone's mind. In a speech before the 
A12  49 Commonwealth Club, Quayle came down hard on <quote_>"lawless social 
A12  50 anarchy"<quote/> - as opposed, presumably, to lawful anarchy. He 
A12  51 spoke of <quote_>"the breakdown of family structure, personal 
A12  52 responsibility and social order in too many areas of our 
A12  53 society,"<quote/> of <quote_>"a welfare ethos that impedes 
A12  54 individual efforts to move ahead in society ..."<quote/> He 
A12  55 acknowledged the <quote_>"terrible problem with race and 
A12  56 racism,"<quote/> adding that <quote_>"the evil of slavery has left 
A12  57 a long legacy."<quote/> But the core of the speech was law and 
A12  58 order. It bristled with words like <quote_>"indulgence and 
A12  59 self-gratification ...glamourized casual sex and drug 
A12  60 use."<quote/><p/>
A12  61 <p_>The speech - if one deleted the Murphy Brown passage - was a 
A12  62 reasonably persuasive and sometimes eloquent sampler: a 
A12  63 punitive-inspirational hymn to hard work, family integrity and 
A12  64 personal responsibility. Some people later took Quayle's words to 
A12  65 be fatuous white-bread<&|>sic! truisms - Norman Rockwell evocations 
A12  66 of an America long gone. But if the ideas could be considered 
A12  67 outside the inflammatory political and racial context of the 
A12  68 moment, they had a ring of common sense. A number of black leaders, 
A12  69 including Jesse Jackson, might have made the same points without 
A12  70 controversy - and have. The family, Quayle said, is important, and 
A12  71 <quote_>"the failure of our families is hurting America deeply 
A12  72 ...Children need love and discipline. They need mothers and 
A12  73 fathers. A welfare check is not a husband. The state is not a 
A12  74 father ...Bearing babies irresponsibly is, simply, 
A12  75 wrong."<quote/><p/>
A12  76 <p_>Then Quayle dropped in a paragraph that produced the 
A12  77 spectacularly silly media effect: <quote_>"It doesn't help matters 
A12  78 when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown - a character who supposedly 
A12  79 epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid professional woman - 
A12  80 mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and 
A12  81 calling it just another 'life-style choice.'"<quote/><p/>
A12  82 <p_>F. Scott Fitzgerald said it is a sign of genius to be able to 
A12  83 entertain in the mind two mutually contradictory ideas without 
A12  84 going insane. America does not think of itself as a genius anymore. 
A12  85 A number of Americans went crazy when they heard Quayle's line 
A12  86 about Murphy Brown.<p/>
A12  87 <p_>At the first level, Quayle's <tf_>Ozzie and Harriet<tf/> 
A12  88 universe, with its freckle-faced nuclear-family suburban 
A12  89 reassurances, collided with that of successful autonomous career 
A12  90 women like the one portrayed in <tf_>Murphy Brown<tf/>. The 
A12  91 executive producer of <tf_>Murphy Brown<tf/>, Diane English, had a 
A12  92 well-machined answer for Quayle: <quote_>"If the Vice President 
A12  93 thinks it's disgraceful for an unmarried woman to bear a child, and 
A12  94 he believes that a woman cannot adequately raise a child without a 
A12  95 father, then he'd better make sure abortion remains safe and 
A12  96 legal."<quote/> Given that Murphy Brown was pregnant, what did 
A12  97 Quayle expect her to do? Have an abortion? Her decision to go ahead 
A12  98 and have the child was in harmony with the Administration's 
A12  99 pro-life convictions. Why criticize her then? Harrumph: she should 
A12 100 never have got pregnant in the first place. Or, more pertinently: 
A12 101 the creators of the program should not have concocted the pregnancy 
A12 102 dilemma for Murphy, thereby making her ultimate choice seem like a 
A12 103 legitimizing and glamourizing of single motherhood.<p/>
A12 104 <p_>At a second, less explicit layer of meaning, the Quayle line 
A12 105 took on complex racial colorations. He suggested that Murphy Brown 
A12 106 was a bad role model for unmarried females. In the speech's 
A12 107 context, he was talking about single mothers in the ghetto. But 
A12 108 like so much in last week's odd episode, there were signs of hip 
A12 109 shooting and inadvertence.<p/>
A12 110 <p_>In fact, few young black females watch <tf_>Murphy Brown<tf/>. 
A12 111 The show, which in overall audience is the third most popular on 
A12 112 network television, ranks 56th in popularity among American blacks. 
A12 113 So the idea that Murphy's single motherhood encourages black 
A12 114 adolescent girls to follow the same course loses its force.<p/>
A12 115 <p_>The racial dimension flows naturally into the political, where 
A12 116 the uglier side of Quayle's mission begins to become apparent. One 
A12 117 of Quayle's amazing but unlikable feats last week was 
A12 118 metaphorically to transform old Willie Horton into a beautiful 
A12 119 blond fortyish <tf|>wasp has-it-all knockout. (Horton was the black 
A12 120 murderer who raped a housewife while on furlough during the time 
A12 121 that 1988 Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis was Governor of 
A12 122 Massachusetts; the Bush campaign used Horton to ridicule Dukakis.) 
A12 123 So in 1992, by Quayle's interesting subliminal design, Murphy 
A12 124 carries at least some of Willie's message: mindless liberalism 
A12 125 allied with black anarchy (ruined families, unwed mothers, crime, 
A12 126 drugs) leads quickly to social breakdown.<p/>
A12 127 <p_>If Quayle has no malign racial-political intent, he might point 
A12 128 out, when discussing the miseries of families, that, for example, 
A12 129 Eastern prep schools are filled with children packed off to get 
A12 130 them away from divorce, incest, alcoholism, child abuse, wife 
A12 131 battering and other horrors at home. The willingness to let the 
A12 132 racist implication stand unchallenged, unexamined, loitering on the 
A12 133 threshold, is the ugliest aspect of all this.<p/>
A12 134 <p_>Quayle in part plays the Spiro Agnew role to Bush's Richard 
A12 135 Nixon. But when Agnew went after the 'nattering nabobs' and student 
A12 136 protesters, he did so with a thuggish menace that Quayle lacks. 
A12 137 Quayle smacks more of Midwestern Americana, of <tf_>The Music 
A12 138 Man's<tf/> Professor Harold Hill, and Quayle's lines about 
A12 139 unmarried mothers sounded like an echo: <quote_>"We got trouble, 
A12 140 right here in River City!"<quote/> - brazen hussies strutting 
A12 141 around town in a family way: Make your blood boil? Well, I should 
A12 142 say!<p/>
A12 143 <p_>In the Bush-Quayle synecdoche, attitude, symbolism and code 
A12 144 words stand in for real action and accomplishment. The Bush 
A12 145 Administration is short on both coherent programs and resources of 
A12 146 leadership to approach the problems. An elaborate rhetorical porch, 
A12 147 with gorgeous traditional columns, fronts an empty house. In any 
A12 148 case, Presidents, Vice Presidents and other public officials are 
A12 149 elected to lead and act first of all. Moral leadership and vision 
A12 150 are vital, but somehow the right to deliver sermons has to be 
A12 151 convincingly earned.<p/>
A12 152 <p_>Quayle makes much of the theme of the absent father; America 
A12 153 under the Bush Administration looks like a house with an absent 
A12 154 father. A man has no right to abandon the family for years and then 
A12 155 show up one day and go upstairs and start spanking the kids.<p/>
A12 156 <p_>Television, which has all but taken over the American political 
A12 157 process, turning the parties into the old technology, is the 
A12 158 perfect medium for a battle of weightless, sensational symbolisms. 
A12 159 Not that the images don't have real effect: a homemade video of a 
A12 160 black motorist being beaten by police succeeded in burning down a 
A12 161 sizable part of Los Angeles. The moral struggle between Dan Quayle 
A12 162 and Murphy Brown seemed perfect and fascinating, as if all the 
A12 163 weaknesses of both politics and television (the short attention 
A12 164 span, the brainless evanescence, the disconnection) were leaking 
A12 165 into one another.<p/>
A12 166 <p_>If the Vice President wanted to attack television's effects on 
A12 167 the American young, he might have hit the medium on 30 or 40 more 
A12 168 serious matters before coming to Murphy Brown's marital status. By 
A12 169 age 20, an American child will have watched 700,000 TV commercials. 
A12 170 According to New York University professor and media critic Neil 
A12 171 Postman, <quote_>"There are several messages in these ads: that all 
A12 172 problems are solvable, that the solutions are quickly available 
A12 173 through use of some chemical, food, drug or machine."<quote/> 
A12 174 Television creates the culture of immediate gratification, not 
A12 175 primarily through its comedy shows but through its advertising. 
A12 176 Says Postman: <quote_>"If anyone wants to relate the Los Angeles 
A12 177 riots to TV shows, everyone in the U.S. sees television shows 
A12 178 communicating the message that these are the things all Americans 
A12 179 are entitled to: TV sets, cars and so on. The riots were in part 
A12 180 driven by this sense of entitlement."<quote/><p/>
A12 181 <p_>Issues of family, morals and values are important - and may 
A12 182 ultimately be central to solving problems, especially those of the 
A12 183 black underclass. But if they are to be discussed merely on the 
A12 184 level of Murphy Brown, it is going to be a long and loathsome 
A12 185 campaign.<p/>

A12 187 <h_><p_>Dial D for Democracy<p/>
A12 188 <p_>In the near future, an electronic town meeting in the U.S. as 
A12 189 envisioned by presidential hopeful Ross Perot could work. But is it 
A12 190 a good idea?<p/>
A12 191 <p_>By PHILIP ELMER-DEWITT<p/><h/>
A12 192 <p_>IMAGINE IT IS 1994. THE U.S. economy is still stagnating, Japan 
A12 193 remains in the doldrums as well, interest rates are rising, and the 
A12 194 deficit has reached $600 billion. Something has to be done - and 
A12 195 quickly. President Ross Perot, making good on a campaign promise, 
A12 196 gets on the horn to the TV networks and organizes one of his famous 
A12 197 electronic town meetings. That night, before a television audience 
A12 198 Murphy Brown would die for, he lays out America's precarious 
A12 199 economic situation and the stark choices the nation confronts. Even 
A12 200 before his presentation is over, the returns begin to pour in - by 
A12 201 telephone, fax, computer modem, videophone and two-way interactive 
A12 202 cable TV. By morning, the will of the American people is clear: 
A12 203 they have decided to cut back on Social Security payments, further 
A12 204 slash military spending and raise their own taxes.<p/>
A12 205 <p_>That's how teledemocracy is supposed to work, according to 
A12 206 Perot, the billionaire computer executive and putative presidential 
A12 207 candidate. The concept has a certain gut-level appeal. To voters 
A12 208 fed up with the paralysis of the U.S. Congress and the 
A12 209 special-interest outrages that characterize politics-as-usual, the 
A12 210 idea that the citizenry might bypass all the musty machinery of 
A12 211 representative democracy and directly influence the government 
A12 212 seems enormously attractive.<p/>
A12 213 <p_>Perot suggests that the technology required to create an 
A12 214 electronic town meeting is already in place - an impression 
A12 215 reinforced by events like his satellite broadcast last Friday that 
A12 216 linked Perot rallies in six different states. Participants in five 
A12 217 U.S. cities could hear one another cheer Perot as he spoke to them 
A12 218 from Orlando, Florida. To have a truly interactive town meeting, 
A12 219 however, a number of technical barriers must still be hurdled. And 
A12 220 even if that happens, it is not clear that the result will be any 
A12 221 way to run a country.<p/>

A13   1 <#FROWN:A13\><h_><p_>Racial Riot Shows Buried Tensions At a High 
A13   2 School<p/>
A13   3 <p_>By David Holmstrom<p/>
A13   4 <p_>Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor<p/>
A13   5 <p_>BOSTON<p/><h/>
A13   6 <p_>THERE should have been 1,168 noisy students filling the halls 
A13   7 and classrooms of Medford High School on Dec. 15. But except for a 
A13   8 handful of tense administrators and a few students and teachers, 
A13   9 Medford High in Medford, Mass., was virtually empty.<p/>
A13  10 <p_>A racially triggered brawl had erupted in the school cafeteria 
A13  11 on Dec. 10. Fighting between black and white students quickly 
A13  12 spread. Dozens of state troopers and police officers clad in riot 
A13  13 gear were called in to restore order. Fifteen students were 
A13  14 arrested.<p/>
A13  15 <p_>The superintendent of Medford schools, Philip Devaux, closed 
A13  16 the school for several days. United States Department of Justice 
A13  17 officials arrived on the scene as fact finders, along with 
A13  18 experienced mediators from the Massachusetts attorney general's 
A13  19 office.<p/>
A13  20 <p_>A quiet suburban town of just under 60,000 people about 10 
A13  21 miles north of Boston, Medford is now being forced to ask itself 
A13  22 two questions: How closely does an ugly racial incident at the high 
A13  23 school reflect attitudes throughout the town? And how do educators 
A13  24 at the high school improve racial understanding?<p/>
A13  25 <p_><quote_>"The incident took me by surprise,"<quote/> says 
A13  26 Medford Mayor Michael McGlynn, who also chairs the School 
A13  27 Committee. <quote_>"There had been some uneasiness at community 
A13  28 meetings last year about kids, but not an indication of this kind 
A13  29 of problem."<quote/><p/>
A13  30 <p_>Some teachers, parents, and students - both black and white - 
A13  31 insist that the signs of trouble were already there at the high 
A13  32 school. Despite some efforts by administrators to resolve racial 
A13  33 charges and countercharges involving white teachers' attitudes and 
A13  34 allegedly excessive defensiveness by some black students, some 
A13  35 teachers and parents say dealing with racial issues was never a 
A13  36 priority at the school.<p/>
A13  37 <p_>In fact, the high school experienced a similar racial incident 
A13  38 in 1977. <quote_>"Not much has changed,"<quote/> says a teacher who 
A13  39 has taught for nine years at Medford.<p/>
A13  40 <p_><quote_>"Everybody knew there was tension,"<quote/> says Daiena 
A13  41 Masciarelli, president of the student council, who said that once 
A13  42 the football season ended and the focal point of school enthusiasm

A13  44 <p_>As for the incident itself, she says, <quote_>"It started out 
A13  45 just as a fight and grew from there into a black and white battle. 
A13  46 I think society has put this racial thing on us. To me race doesn't 
A13  47 matter; we should judge people on their minds, not their skins, but 
A13  48 I don't think a lot of adults believe that."<quote/><p/>
A13  49 <p_>About 15 percent of the student body at Medford is black; the 
A13  50 rest is almost all white. There are four black teachers. A black 
A13  51 senior, who did not want to be identified, says, <quote_>"There are 
A13  52 white teachers here who make racial slurs and treat black kids 
A13  53 differently. Everybody knows this, but how are you going to take 
A13  54 that out of some teacher's head when it's <}its> been there for 
A13  55 forty years?"<quote/><p/>
A13  56 <p_>Miss Masciarelli criticized the school's curriculum for not 
A13  57 having enough material on different cultures.<p/>
A13  58 <p_>A black mother of a Medford junior sat in the superintendent's 
A13  59 office last week after the incident and said she had never seen her 
A13  60 son so upset. <quote_>"He's got lots of white friends,"<quote/> she 
A13  61 says, <quote_>and they're on the phone now wondering if they can 
A13  62 speak to each other in public when they go back to 
A13  63 school."<quote/><p/>
A13  64 <p_>On Dec. 14, Superintendent Devaux held a community-wide meeting 
A13  65 to assure parents that <quote_>"we are working to create a safe and 
A13  66 controlled school environment before reopening."<quote/> He said 
A13  67 <quote_>"20 actions"<quote/> were being implemented, including work 
A13  68 by a team of state mediators who are meeting with students and 
A13  69 teachers.<p/>
A13  70 <p_><quote_>"What we will be trying to do"<quote/> says Alice 
A13  71 Comack, the head of the mediation team, <quote_>"is not find out 
A13  72 who was right or wrong, but to listen to them to get an 
A13  73 understanding of what is bothering them."<quote/> The first step 
A13  74 was separate confidential sessions with black and white student 
A13  75 leaders, then a joint session before school reopened Dec. 18 for 
A13  76 seniors and juniors only.<p/>
A13  77 <p_><quote_>"Mediation seeks to create an environment,"<quote/> 
A13  78 says Denis Gray, one of the mediators, <quote_>"in which future

A13  80 to change the human heart. We work out what the people can live 
A13  81 with."<quote/><p/>
A13  82 <p_>In the sessions, the mediators listen as long as needed to the 
A13  83 students and then move toward more precise definitions of terms and 
A13  84 the meaning of words. <quote_>"People want to be heard,"<quote/> 
A13  85 Mr. Gray says, <quote_>"and when they realize they are being heard, 
A13  86 they are being empowered and will be more willing to find

A13  88 <p_>One of the issues at Medford was the confused racial

A13 104 <h_><p_>Inner Cities Pose Tough Task for Clinton Team<p/>
A13 105 <p_>By David Holmstrom<p/>
A13 106 <p_>Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor<p/>
A13 107 <p_>BOSTON<p/><h/>
A13 108 <p_>SIX months ago, as they walked through the smoking ruins of 
A13 109 riot-torn Los Angeles, all of the presidential candidates had on 
A13 110 their lips the heady promise of urban aid for inner cities. Today 
A13 111 the delivery of urban aid is in President-elect Clinton's lap.<p/>
A13 112 <p_>How quickly and effectively the new president delivers on 
A13 113 promises hinges on three factors: his ability to keep the problems 
A13 114 of inner cities from being crowded out by other domestic and 
A13 115 international issues; his ability to coax bipartisan congressional 
A13 116 action; and his ability not to add to the federal budget deficit 
A13 117 with short-term, money-swallowing social programs.<p/>
A13 118 <p_>Mr. Clinton more than once has indicated a concern for inner 
A13 119 cities and his determination to create jobs there.<p/>
A13 120 <p_><quote_>"Cities have not been treated very well over the last 
A13 121 two decades by presidents,"<quote/> said Joseph Boskin, director of 
A13 122 the urban studies public-policy program at Boston University. Yet 
A13 123 <quote_>"they are crucial to the economic and psychological 
A13 124 viability of this nation.<p/>
A13 125 <p_>"Clinton's first priority should be job creation. I'd like to 
A13 126 see such efforts as Job Corps programs connected with universities 
A13 127 and colleges, so that there are some long-term development of 
A13 128 skills going on, and not just cleaning the streets."<quote/><p/>
A13 129 <p_>Efforts by Republican and Democratic administrations over the 
A13 130 last 30 years to solve a host of deepening inner-city problems read 
A13 131 like a badly told story that never seems to end. The Great Society 
A13 132 programs of President Johnson spent enormous amounts of money on 
A13 133 poverty and inner cities, but came away with only two enduring 
A13 134 legacies, Head Start and the Job Corps.<p/>
A13 135 <p_>Much-heralded programs like the Comprehensive Employment and 
A13 136 Training Act [CETA] under President Nixon and the Model Cities 
A13 137 program under Mr. Johnson saw many funds end up in middle-income 
A13 138 projects - or become lost in bureaucratic delays and policy shifts, 
A13 139 some urban specialists say.<p/>
A13 140 <p_>During the Carter and Reagan years, poor, unemployed blacks 
A13 141 remained very heavily concentrated in cities, leading to more 
A13 142 pronounced residential segregation. Whites, Asians, and Latinos are 
A13 143 increasingly less likely to live near blacks in many inner cities; 
A13 144 many whites have departed for the suburbs.<p/>
A13 145 <p_>In Chicago, for instance, 71 percent of all blacks now live in 
A13 146 one-race census tracts bordering other all-black census tracts, a 
A13 147 pattern repeated in many other cities. This kind of downward spiral 
A13 148 in social integration, when exacerbated by joblessness, has had 
A13 149 broad social impact.<p/>
A13 150 <p_>Violent crime in all major cities has increased over the last 
A13 151 decade, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Schools 
A13 152 have deteriorated and many businesses and banks have abandoned the 
A13 153 inner cities. According to the National Urban League, an estimated 
A13 154 50 percent of all urban black children now live in poverty.<p/>
A13 155 <p_>Such programs as enterprise zones in inner cities with special 
A13 156 tax breaks for businesses were proposed under Ronald Reagan, but 
A13 157 have hung in limbo for years.<p/>
A13 158 <p_>A $27 billion urban-aid package approved by Congress this year 
A13 159 was vetoed by President Bush six months after the Los Angeles 
A13 160 riots. He said it included <quote_>"numerous tax increases and 
A13 161 would destroy jobs and undermine small 
A13 162 business."<quote/><quote/><p/>
A13 163 <p_>Many urban specialists agree with Clinton's promised pragmatic 
A13 164 approach, to launch projects and programs that are prudently 
A13 165 balanced between inner city needs and the need to cut the deficit. 
A13 166 As yet, Clinton has provided few details about inner-city programs, 
A13 167 whether he favors a heavy federal commitment or a combination of 
A13 168 public and private funds.<p/>
A13 169 <p_><quote_>Enterprise zones should be high on Clinton's list of 
A13 170 priorities,"<quote/> said Robert Hill, director of the Institute 
A13 171 for Urban Research at Morgan State University at Baltimore.<p/>
A13 172 <p_><quote|>"But," he says, <quote_>"equally as important, he 
A13 173 should target established community-based groups such as the 
A13 174 resident-management corporations in public housing. Many of these 
A13 175 are setting up businesses and hiring former welfare recipients. 
A13 176 These groups should get all the reinforcement they 
A13 177 need."<quote/><p/>
A13 178 <p_>The first priority, however, many experts say, should be jobs 
A13 179 programs. Since 1980, adult black men have had unemployment rates 
A13 180 above 10 percent every year. In 1972, the unemployment rate for 
A13 181 black men was 7.2 percent. And per capita income for blacks in 1990 
A13 182 was $9,017. For whites it was $15,265.<p/>
A13 183 <p_><quote_>"There are hard choices to be made,"<quote/> said Billy 
A13 184 Tidwell, director of research for the National Urban League.<p/>
A13 185 <p_><quote_>"Clinton has to deal with the deficit,"<quote/> he 
A13 186 said, <quote_>"but the economic conditions that feed into it, such 
A13 187 as the costs associated with the neglect of inner cities, need a 
A13 188 high priority. There will be a good deal of pressure from 
A13 189 reasonable people to move the Clinton administration in that 
A13 190 direction."<quote/><p/>
A13 191 <p_>If Clinton should turn to a network of public-work programs, 
A13 192 would the effort result in inflationary federal spending?<p/>
A13 193 <p_><quote_>"More money is expended to stop crime,"<quote/> Mr. 
A13 194 Boskin said, <quote_>"than is spent in putting people to work. When 
A13 195 a riot occurs, like the one in L.A., rebuilding the city is much 
A13 196 more expensive to deal with than putting people to work in the 
A13 197 first place."<quote/><p/>

A13 199 <h_><p_>Consensus Rule Is Aim of Washington State's 
A13 200 Governor-Elect<p/>
A13 201 <p_>Observers see parallels between his plans and Bill Clinton's on 
A13 202 taxes and economy<p/>
A13 203 <p_>By Mark Trumbull<p/>
A13 204 <p_>Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor<p/>
A13 205 <p_>OLYMPIA, WASH.<p/><h/>
A13 206 <p_>THE transition team is hard at work preparing for an important 
A13 207 'first 100 days.' Task forces are being convened with 
A13 208 representatives from all sides of knotty issues. The incoming chief 
A13 209 executive is trying to make good on the image he set forth in the 
A13 210 election campaign, which balanced Democratic Party principles with 
A13 211 the need to revive a lagging economy.<p/>
A13 212 <p_>But the man is not President-elect Clinton and the seat of 
A13 213 power is not Washinton, D.C., but Washington State.<p/>
A13 214 <p_>Governor-elect Mike Lowry (D), like Mr. Clinton, has won 
A13 215 cautious praise from many in the business community for his efforts 
A13 216 at 'consensus government.' This is one of several interesting 
A13 217 parallels between these two winners of November's election.<p/>
A13 218 <p_>By considering moderate Republicans for some key posts and 
A13 219 seeking views from many task forces, Mr. Lowry is <quote_>"actively 
A13 220 operating in this transition period as he campaigned,"<quote/> says 
A13 221 Bill Jacobs, executive director of the Washington Forest Protection 
A13 222 Association, sponsored by the timber industry. Lowry plans to 
A13 223 consult a diverse <quote_>"citizen's cabinet"<quote/> throughout 
A13 224 his tenure.<p/>
A13 225 <p_><quote_>"It's very difficult to get consensus,"<quote/> Mr. 
A13 226 Jacobs says.<p/>
A13 227 <p_>Like Lowry with his task forces, Clinton will face this 
A13 228 challenge when he holds his 'economic summit.' Lowry, however, has 
A13 229 an advantage: State law requires that the budget be balanced.<p/>
A13 230 <p_>A former congressman and Seattle University teacher, Lowry has 
A13 231 a particularly difficult budget in the works. Although this state 
A13 232 weathered the recession better than most, its economy is now 
A13 233 fragile, with thousands of jobs in aerospace and timber lost or at 
A13 234 risk due to industry troubles and environmental concerns.<p/>

A14   1 <#FROWN:A14\><h_><p_>CLINTON ALREADY?<p/>
A14   2 <p_>The Manufactured Candidate<p/>
A14   3 <p_>By Andrew Kopkind<p/>
A14   4 <p_>Manchester, New Hampshire<p/><h/>
A14   5 <p_>It was said of Belgrade after World War II that there was 
A14   6 nothing in the shops except dead flies and pictures of Tito. So it 
A14   7 is this winter in Manchester, minus the pictures. There are enough 
A14   8 empty storefronts on Elm Street to serve as headquarters for a 
A14   9 hundred candidates in the February 18 presidential primary. Once 
A14  10 home to the biggest textile mill complex in the world, Manchester 
A14  11 seems to have no future save as a theme park about the devolution 
A14  12 of America. In this Decline World, factories have flown, malls are 
A14  13 empty, condos are bankrupt, banks are failing, the service-sector 
A14  14 boom of the Reagan 1980s has gone bust and unemployment has almost 
A14  15 tripled since the 1988 primary. And the elms are all dead.<p/>
A14  16 <p_>On a damp Sunday morning in January, Elm Street is a dead zone. 
A14  17 Traffic lights blink on and off gratuitously to lanes devoid of 
A14  18 cars. Torn sheets of green plastic flap idly around an abandoned 
A14  19 construction site. Except for a posse of transient advance men, 
A14  20 handlers and media persons gathered to start the day campaigning 
A14  21 with Bill Clinton, only one local citizen is visible, a tall, 
A14  22 disheveled youngish man with a graying beard, camouflage cap, 
A14  23 tattered parka and dark aviator glasses. His hands are plunged in 
A14  24 his pockets and his shoulders seem permanently hunched against the 
A14  25 cold.<p/>
A14  26 <p_><quote_>"Going down, isn't it?"<quote/> he says suddenly as we 
A14  27 pass, in front of a shuttered porn mart the Clinton people call 
A14  28 <quote_>"the adult book store."<quote/><p/>
A14  29 <p_><quote_>"It looks that way,"<quote/> I agree tentatively.<p/>
A14  30 <p_><quote_>"Going down,"<quote/> he repeats, and walks away 
A14  31 without turning.<p/>
A14  32 <p_>In many ways, Bill Clinton is the prophetic candidate of 
A14  33 decline. The young and personable Arkansas Governor begins his 
A14  34 basic rap - at house parties, club meetings, nursing homes and 
A14  35 wherever else a crowd is collected - with a litany of economic 
A14  36 deterioration. <quote_>"We [candidates always assume the identity 
A14  37 of the places they seek to represent] used to be the world's 
A14  38 banker, now we're the world's biggest debtor,"<quote/> he says. 
A14  39 <quote_>"American workers used to be the best paid, now we're 
A14  40 tenth. We used to be eighth in income equality, now we're dead 
A14  41 last. The Fortune 500 have announced 300,000 layoffs in the last 
A14  42 thirty days."<quote/> Infrastructure is crumbling, education 
A14  43 doesn't work, pollution is pandemic, there's no health system to 
A14  44 speak of, manufacturing is disappearing: Clinton counts the 
A14  45 woes.<p/>
A14  46 <p_>Clinton is arguably the most articulate and certainly the best 
A14  47 informed of the candidates chronicling decline in this recession 
A14  48 season, when economic failure provides the context for politics. It 
A14  49 is not unreasonable, however, to ask, <quote_>"Compared to 
A14  50 what?"<quote/> Mario Cuomo might have done it with more zing, but 
A14  51 he has assigned himself the role of kibitzer rather than player, 
A14  52 and that vastly diminishes his impact. Jerry Brown has a strong but 
A14  53 one-note message about a single <quote_>"incumbent party"<quote/> 
A14  54 and the <quote|>"corruption" of the political system, Paul Tsongas 
A14  55 is passionless and unpresidential, Tom Harkin is bombastic and 
A14  56 unattached to any populist movement he pretends to lead and Bob 
A14  57 Kerrey is fixated on his own war record and sinking fast.<p/>
A14  58 <p_>That leaves Clinton in front of the pack (already preshrunk by 
A14  59 the departure of Douglas Wilder and George McGovern) and perhaps 
A14  60 unstoppable except by an obstacle of his own erection. The 
A14  61 experience of 1988 suggests that Democrats are eminently capable of 
A14  62 destroying their own campaigns, both by suicidal behavior (Gary 
A14  63 Hart's philandering, Joe Biden's plagiarism) and by sudden 
A14  64 blackouts of imagination (Dukakis's collapse after the party's 
A14  65 national convention). The Primary season has just begun (it doesn't 
A14  66 end till June), and a slip of the tongue or a fall on a banana peel 
A14  67 could derail any one of these characters.<p/>
A14  68 <p_>Barring such disasters, Clinton has a clear shot at the 
A14  69 nomination. He is now winning the all-important 'first primary' - 
A14  70 fundraising - after pulling ahead of PAC-man Harkin in the December 
A14  71 sweeps. It's true that mainly the money and political elites - not 
A14  72 the masses - are giving him initial momentum, and that leaves an 
A14  73 opening for a candidate who can rouse the common man somewhere down 
A14  74 the line. But already the media are swooning in his wake: Joe Klein 
A14  75 of <tf_>New York<tf/> and Michael Kramer of <tf|>Time act as if 
A14  76 they're part of the campaign (Klein actually 'spins' for Clinton 
A14  77 and explains his policies to reporters on the trail; he maintains 
A14  78 for all to hear that Clinton is <quote_>"the smartest politician 
A14  79 I've ever met"<quote/>). <tf_>The New York Times<tf/> is employing 
A14  80 another pro-Clinton tactic by bashing Kerrey for his personal 
A14  81 business practices. Economics columnist Bob Kuttner of <tf_>The 
A14  82 Boston Globe<tf/> detects <quote_>"a genuine bandwagon"<quote/> for 
A14  83 Clinton, <quote_>"a Democrat ... who is not only adroit as a 
A14  84 candidate but who also might govern competently."<quote/> He 
A14  85 neglects to say he helped assemble said wagon. Even <tf|>Times 
A14  86 columnist William Safire, an anti-Bush Reaganite, is boosting 
A14  87 Clinton, for his uncompromising defense of Israeli demands on the 
A14  88 U.S. Treasury.<p/>
A14  89 <p_>The enthusiastic support of political intellectuals has been 
A14  90 the key to Clinton's success so far. While Harkin had some Big 
A14  91 Labor, Tsongas some high-tech business, Wilder some blacks and 
A14  92 Brown some self-identified progressives, Clinton organized the 
A14  93 opinion-leaders and gatekeepers in the cool center of the political 
A14  94 establishment. It didn't happen by accident. A founding member (and 
A14  95 recent chair) of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, he 
A14  96 directed the development of an ideology to support his campaign. As 
A14  97 Clinton and friends begat the D.L.C., so the D.L.C. begat the 
A14  98 P.P.I., the Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington think tank 
A14  99 that fires off neoliberal proposals like a Salad Shooter spews 
A14 100 lettuce shreds.<p/>
A14 101 <p_>Not only that, but P.P.I. heavies and adherents have converged 
A14 102 on Op-Ed pages all over the United States in a deliberate drive to 
A14 103 legitimize Clinton and the ideology of Clintonism that the 
A14 104 institute has created. For example, Elaine Ciulla Kamarck, a P.P.I. 
A14 105 senior fellow and Clinton groupie, is now a regular contributor to 
A14 106 both the <tf_>Los Angeles Times<tf/> and <tf|>Newsday. Her first 
A14 107 effort posed six <quote_>"killer questions"<quote/> for candidates, 
A14 108 all of which only Clinton would answer to her liking; the second 
A14 109 was an out-and-out endorsement of Clinton's <quote_>"centrist 
A14 110 ways"<quote/> as the best antidote to Bush. In a similar conceit, 
A14 111 the op-edible Abe Rosenthal of <tf_>The New York Times<tf/> listed 
A14 112 ten <quote|>"errors" he said Bush made in foreign policy, virtually 
A14 113 all of them on the 'left' side of the issues (failure to devastate 
A14 114 Iraq fully and murder Saddam, skepticism on Israel). Clinton, among 
A14 115 all the Democrats, is on the Rosenthal side.<p/>
A14 116 <p_>What Kuttner calls <quote_>"an astonishingly broad diversity of 
A14 117 Democratic activists"<quote/> have reported for duty in Camp 
A14 118 Clinton. Harold Ickes, son of F.D.R.'s Interior Secretary of the 
A14 119 same name and four years ago a Jesse Jackson stalwart, is 
A14 120 shepherding Clinton around New York City and organizing local labor 
A14 121 leaders for his cause. He has already attracted some key unionists, 
A14 122 such as Stanley Hill and Dennis Rivera (co<?_>-<?/>chairman of 
A14 123 Jackson's drive last time); Rivera likes Harkin but is helping 
A14 124 Clinton too, his aides say, for the <quote|>"winnability" factor. 
A14 125 James Carville, the political consultant who scored the season's 
A14 126 first hit by masterminding Harris Wofford's senatorial victory in 
A14 127 Pennsylvania, is always inches away from Clinton's ear. Liberals 
A14 128 like pollster Stanley Greenberg (out of Senator Christopher Dodd 
A14 129 and Governor Jim Florio), media man Frank Greer (Fred Harris in 
A14 130 '76, et seq.) and campaign manager David Wilhelm (Senator Paul 
A14 131 Simon's ex) have moved to the right and into the Clinton center. 
A14 132 Such swarming of the columnists, academics and political mandarins 
A14 133 recalls the time thirtysomething years ago when the likes of Joe 
A14 134 Kraft, the Alsop brothers, Arthur Schlesinger, Walt Rostow and the 
A14 135 future knights of Camelot bought their tickets to ride with John 
A14 136 Kennedy into the White House.<p/>
A14 137 <p_>The more America declines, the better will Clinton's chances be 
A14 138 to become President. If the recession is as deep and intractable as 
A14 139 now seems the case, the candidate who can give voice to suffering 
A14 140 citizens and provide clear plans for action at least stands a 
A14 141 chance against the expected Bush blitzkrieg.<p/>
A14 142 <p_>The only problem for Clinton at this point is Clinton himself. 
A14 143 His policy papers have great preambles and solid introductions, but 
A14 144 then they go blank. If there are no second acts in Americans' 
A14 145 lives, there are no second pages in Clinton's proposals. Take 
A14 146 health care (<tf|>please!). Clinton begins with an eloquent 
A14 147 statement of the problem: <quote_>"We are the only advanced nation 
A14 148 in the world that doesn't provide health care to all its citizens 
A14 149 and doesn't take the lead in controlling costs. In the first year 
A14 150 of the Clinton Administration, Congress and I will deliver quality, 
A14 151 affordable health care for all Americans."<quote/> And then? There 
A14 152 is no then, then. He says he'll base his health system on models in 
A14 153 Hawaii, Germany and <quote|>"Europe." He promises coverage for the 
A14 154 uncovered but doesn't say how much or what kind. He vows to control 
A14 155 costs with vague notions of <quote_>"insurance reform"<quote/> and 
A14 156 the elimination of <quote_>"administrative waste"<quote/> and 
A14 157 <quote_>"billing fraud."<quote/> To solve the elder<?_>-<?/>care 
A14 158 crisis, he would provide <quote|>"choices" for old people who still 
A14 159 have a lot of money. And to cap off his health plan he swears he 
A14 160 won't increase taxes. Read his lips.<p/>
A14 161 <p_>His long-term economic strategy is, if anything, even more 
A14 162 indistinct. The devastating statistics of the decline he cites do 
A14 163 not lead to ideas of equal weight. He does give New Hampshire 
A14 164 audiences a taste of his short-term plans for the economy: speed up 
A14 165 work under the new transportation bill (which Bush signed in Texas 
A14 166 before he flew to Asia), help small businesses with capital gains 
A14 167 and investment tax breaks, beef up federal housing loans and, 
A14 168 tastiest of all, cut "middle class" taxes by 10 percent, giving the 
A14 169 average family about $400 to spend <quote_>"paying off credit card 
A14 170 loans"<quote/> and, perhaps, sending the kids to Yale or buying a 
A14 171 new Buick.<p/>
A14 172 <p_>The United States is the only major country in the world 
A14 173 without an economic strategy, Clinton points out, and that's why 
A14 174 manufacturing is dwindling, the Japanese are winning and wages are 
A14 175 dropping. His solution is to <quote_>"deliver quality, affordable 
A14 176 health care,"<quote/> encourage manufacturing, reduce interest on 
A14 177 the national debt and train young people for skilled work. Is it my 
A14 178 imagination or is the dog chasing its own tail? Everything is 
A14 179 dependent on a contingency. American cars, he says, have more than 
A14 180 $700 in health insurance costs <quote_>"built into them,"<quote/> 
A14 181 while Japanese cars roll off the line with only 200 health care 
A14 182 dollars in each chassis. Provide cheaper health care and Detroit 
A14 183 will boom and spark a significant reindustrialization of America, 
A14 184 Q.E.D. Tax revenues will rise and the debt will decrease. There 
A14 185 will be skilled jobs at high wages for young people who go through 
A14 186 Clinton's apprenticeship program. Cut military spending and spend 
A14 187 the <quote_>"peace dividend"<quote/> on social improvements. But 
A14 188 wait. Re-examine the premise, and the logical train is derailed 
A14 189 before it leaves the station.<p/>
A14 190 <p_>Like Michael Dukakis in 1988, Clinton refers to the marvels of 
A14 191 his home state as models for national action. Dukakis's promise of 
A14 192 <quote_>"good jobs at good wages"<quote/> had as its basis the 
A14 193 high-tech, service-rich 'Massachusetts miracle,' fueled by the 
A14 194 Carter-Reagan military expenditure extravaganza and by the 
A14 195 explosion of consumption in the 1980s. Elect Dukakis, we were told, 
A14 196 and the whole country will experience Massachusetts' 
A14 197 <foreign|>Wirtschaftswunder. Unfortunately for the Duke, the Iowa 
A14 198 caucuses had not yet been held when the <foreign|>Wunder started to 
A14 199 go under. A year later, when Dukakis assured his voters he would 
A14 200 not stand again for Governor of the state he helped run into the 
A14 201 ground, Massachusetts was the basket case of the country, and it 
A14 202 soon brought the rest of New England under with it.<p/>
A14 203 <p_>Clinton also promises a <quote_>"high-wage, high-growth, 
A14 204 high-opportunity society"<quote/> and he refers to many programs in 
A14 205 Arkansas as models for his national plan. But even a cursory look 
A14 206 at his state shows that his investment strategy over eleven years 
A14 207 as Governor there has been the opposite of what he claims. Arkansas 
A14 208 is essentially an anti-union state with a 'right-to-work' law that 
A14 209 depresses wages and benefits for workers and inhibits the expansion 
A14 210 of a skilled labor force.

A15   1 <#FROWN:A15\><h_><p_>Toronto pitching biggest concern for 
A15   2 Oakland<p/>
A15   3 <p_>By Frank Blackman<p/>
A15   4 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A15   5 <p_>TORONTO - One of these years Pat Gillick is going to buy the 
A15   6 Toronto Blue Jays a trip to the World Series.<p/>
A15   7 <p_>The A's just hope it isn't this year. Gillick, the Jays' 
A15   8 general manager, is a believer in the rent-a-pitcher approach to 
A15   9 pennant races, hiring talent for the final push in September and 
A15  10 October.<p/>
A15  11 <p_>Mike Flanagan in 1987. John Candelaria and Bud Black in 1990. 
A15  12 Tom Candiotti in '91. None was able to help the Jays reach the 
A15  13 World Series.<p/>
A15  14 <p_>Undeterred, Gillick went out in '92 and obtained David Cone, 
A15  15 who many considered the best pitcher in the National League. Like 
A15  16 his predecessors, Cone can become a free agent after the 
A15  17 postseason, and it's anticipated he'll hang a U-turn and head back 
A15  18 to New York and sign with the Yankees.<p/>
A15  19 <p_>But what Cone does next year is of less import to the A's than 
A15  20 what he will do in the next 10 days. He's scheduled to start twice 
A15  21 against Oakland in the American League Championship Series that 
A15  22 begins here Wednesday night. It will be the first time the A's 
A15  23 hitters have seen him up close and personal this year.<p/>
A15  24 <p_><quote_>"What worries me is the unknown factor of David 
A15  25 Cone,"<quote/> batting coach Doug Rader said. <quote_>"I think we 
A15  26 match up OK with everyone else, but David Cone, because he's 
A15  27 unknown, it's naturally frightening."<quote/><p/>
A15  28 <p_>Cone hasn't had a chance to test himself against Mark McGwire, 
A15  29 presumably a frightening prospect, too. And he's only watched 
A15  30 Rickey Henderson take his hacks on TV. Pitching to the A's has to 
A15  31 be a daunting challenge for someone who hasn't done it before, 
A15  32 right?<p/>
A15  33 <p_><quote_>"Big advantage to the pitcher,"<quote/> Rader said. 
A15  34 <quote_>"He throws from a different angle, so you're not 
A15  35 comfortable with him. Another major thing is that you need 
A15  36 reaffirmation. If you've already had success against someone, even 
A15  37 though it might be limited, that counts for something. It's a 
A15  38 different scenario when you haven't faced someone."<quote/><p/>
A15  39 <p_>The A's respect the Jays - how could you not when a club has 
A15  40 Joe Carter, Roberto Alomar, Dave Winfield, Jack Morris and Tom 
A15  41 Henke? But it is also obvious they are not awed by Toronto. Dave 
A15  42 Stewart, who will start Game 1 against Morris, has said he believes 
A15  43 his team has the right stuff to handle the Jays and thinks the Jays 
A15  44 believe that, too.<p/>
A15  45 <p_>Toronto hasn't won a season series between the teams since 
A15  46 1985. This year, the Blue Jays won the first four games but then 
A15  47 lost six of the next eight, an ego boost for the A's going into the 
A15  48 playoffs. And the SkyDome is not an enclosed house of horrors for 
A15  49 the A's, who have won 13 of the 19 games they've played there. Not 
A15  50 to mention the A's beating the Jays in five games for the 1989 AL 
A15  51 pennant.<p/>
A15  52 <p_>Morris, who can start three times if necessary, finished the 
A15  53 regular season 21-6 but with a 4.04 earned-run average. And the A's 
A15  54 have a history of success against him. If he loses Wednesday, the 
A15  55 Jays might crumble. Cone goes Thursday night.<p/>
A15  56 <p_>Manager Cito Gaston is hedging on his third starter, either 
A15  57 Jimmy Key or Juan Guzman. Key was very strong down the stretch, but 
A15  58 the A's are 28-8 against left-handers this season. Guzman struggled 
A15  59 after returning from a shoulder injury but was impressive in his 
A15  60 final start Saturday.<p/>
A15  61 <p_>On paper, the A's rotation is daunting. But ...<p/>
A15  62 <p_>Stewart is a proven money pitcher. But he's pitched all year 
A15  63 with a tender elbow that could flare up. Mike Moore has a lifetime 
A15  64 4-1 record in the postseason, 2-0 with an 0.69 ERA in the playoffs. 
A15  65 But which Moore will show up, the overpowering one who led the 
A15  66 staff with 17 wins or the guy who can occasionally look 
A15  67 overmatched?<p/>
A15  68 <p_>Ron Darling arguably was the team's most consistent pitcher 
A15  69 this year but has little margin for error. If he isn't on, he's in 
A15  70 the clubhouse. Bob Welch, who has been on and off the disabled list 
A15  71 three times, does quality work. But how deep can he go into a game 
A15  72 before being replaced?<p/>
A15  73 <p_>Moose Stubing is one of California's advance scouts. Because 
A15  74 the Angels spent much of the season following Oakland into cities 
A15  75 on road trips, he wound up watching the A's play more than he 
A15  76 probably wanted to and also is familiar with the Jays.<p/>
A15  77 <p_><quote_>"I think they'll match up fine as far as starting 
A15  78 pitchers,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"I think the difference will be 
A15  79 in the sixth and seventh inning. Who can get to their ace relievers 
A15  80 first. I think Jeff Russell setting up for (Dennis) Eckersley is 
A15  81 the same as (Duane) Ward setting up for Henke.<p/>
A15  82 <p_>"The fourth inning or fifth inning in their games are going to 
A15  83 be very important. Whoever has the advantage going into the sixth 
A15  84 or seventh inning is going to win."<quote/><p/>
A15  85 <p_>Henke and Ward are obvious strengths for Toronto. Even though 
A15  86 Eckersley was uncharacteristically shaky the final week of the 
A15  87 regular season - blowing a save and failing to keep his team tied 
A15  88 in another appearance - the assumption must be those were 
A15  89 aberrations. Russell, out since Sept. 16 with an elbow injury, 
A15  90 returned to pitch two perfect innings Sunday. The bad news for 
A15  91 Oakland is Rick Honeycutt will miss the playoffs because of the 
A15  92 recurrence of the injury to his right side, and that means the 
A15  93 lefty short-relief role will be handled by rookie Vince Horsman.<p/>
A15  94 <p_>With Jose Canseco in Texas, the A's have to work a little 
A15  95 harder for their runs. That's not necessarily a disadvantage. All 
A15  96 season this team has been remarkably resourceful, able to 
A15  97 capitalize on a Jerry Browne double as much as a shot into the 
A15  98 seats by McGwire.<p/>
A15  99 <p_>Toronto is the equivalent of a big-play team in football. Its 
A15 100 offense is structured around Carter or Winfield going deep. And if 
A15 101 the big guys start flailing at pitches, the Jays might not be as 
A15 102 resilient.<p/>
A15 103 <p_>One scout, who asked to be unnamed for obvious reasons, thinks 
A15 104 the difference in this series will be the matchup between managers 
A15 105 Tony La Russa and Gaston. La Russa used all his people this season, 
A15 106 while Gaston has given his reserves limited playing time. Hence 
A15 107 they will be less prepared for the pressure of the playoffs. Also, 
A15 108 the scout argued, Gaston has a tendency to stay with his starters 
A15 109 longer than desirable. And finally, no one runs a game better than 
A15 110 La Russa.<p/>
A15 111 <p_>La Russa says that's nonsense. Gaston's been good enough to get 
A15 112 his team into the playoffs three of the last four years, and 
A15 113 anyway, <quote_>"the game is not won by managers."<quote/><p/>
A15 114 <p_>We'll see.<p/>

A15 116 <h_><p_>Cal taking level-headed approach<p/>
A15 117 <p_>Bears to keep it simple against No. 1 Washington<p/>
A15 118 <p_>By Edvins Beitiks<p/>
A15 119 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A15 120 <p_>BERKELEY - Two years ago, Cal's football players went to 
A15 121 Seattle wearing miniature roses in their lapels, so sure of 
A15 122 themselves they challenged the Huskies before the game and in the 
A15 123 tunnel at halftime. Washington turned the Bears upside down, 46-7, 
A15 124 shaking all the change out of their pockets.<p/>
A15 125 <p_>Last year at Berkeley, undefeated Cal took No.3 Washington to 
A15 126 the last play of the game before losing, 24-17. The season ended 
A15 127 with Cal beating Clemson in the Citrus Bowl and the Huskies winning 
A15 128 half a national championship.<p/>
A15 129 <p_>That was then. This is now.<p/>
A15 130 <p_>As both teams prepare for Saturday afternoon's game at Husky 
A15 131 Stadium, Cal coach Keith Gilbertson and Washington coach Don James 
A15 132 point out that things have changed. Gilbertson said the Bears still 
A15 133 don't know how good they are, while James argued the Huskies aren't 
A15 134 as good as they were last season, even though they're rated 
A15 135 No.1.<p/>
A15 136 <p_><quote_>"When (USC coach) Larry Smith said we're a better team 
A15 137 than last year, I almost wanted to throw up,"<quote/> James said. 
A15 138 <quote_>"I don't think we're even close. I don't think you <tf|>can 
A15 139 be when you lose 16 letter<?_>-<?/>men, 11 drafted. Three wide 
A15 140 receivers, a tight end, a center, weakside guard ..."<quote/><p/>
A15 141 <p_>In spite of being 4-0, the Huskies aren't as dominating as they 
A15 142 were a year ago. Cal is ahead of Washington in almost every 
A15 143 offensive and defensive category - the Huskies are in the middle of 
A15 144 the Pac-10 offensively, last in rushing defense, eighth in total 
A15 145 defense.<p/>
A15 146 <p_><quote_>"We're a big-play defense,"<quote/> cracked James. 
A15 147 <quote_>"We give up big plays."<quote/><p/>
A15 148 <p_>Cal receiver Sean Dawkins said, <quote_>"Looking at the USC 
A15 149 game (a 17-10 win), you saw them make a lot of mistakes 
A15 150 defensively. They're not as good as last year, but they're still 
A15 151 good."<quote/><p/>
A15 152 <p_>James expects the Bears to be as solid as they were last 
A15 153 season, when <quote_>"they played us better than any team on our 
A15 154 schedule."<quote/> Asked if Gilbertson has an advantage because he 
A15 155 was Washington's offensive coordinator a year ago, James said, 
A15 156 <quote_>"I would think the advantage would be the same. We would 
A15 157 know as much about him as he knows about us."<quote/><p/>
A15 158 <p_>Gilbertson agreed, saying it'll come down to how the game is 
A15 159 played, not how well he knows Washington.<p/>
A15 160 <p_>He's going to keep his game plan simple, explained Gilbertson. 
A15 161 <quote_>"Everyone who has gone in with a real elaborate, 
A15 162 'sophisticated' plan has come out with a black eye. They're too 
A15 163 fast, too talented, to get cute with 'em."<quote/><p/>
A15 164 <p_>Two years ago Cal tried to play a get-tough, get-cute game with 
A15 165 Washington and it didn't work, said Dawkins. <quote_>"We talked a 
A15 166 lot of bullcrap that week. This time we're going in there 
A15 167 level-headed, not saying anything that's going to get them stirred 
A15 168 up."<quote/><p/>
A15 169 <p_>On the plane to Seattle in 1990, an alumnus passed miniature 
A15 170 roses around and the Bears pinned them to their lapels. A couple of 
A15 171 players pasted roses on their jerseys during warmups at Husky 
A15 172 Stadium, said Dawkins, <quote_>"and there was a bunch of pushing 
A15 173 and shoving going on. Our guys were just kind of barking at 
A15 174 Washington."<quote/><p/>
A15 175 <p_>Offensive lineman Todd Steussie said Cal was trying to 
A15 176 compensate for its underdog status. <quote_>"This year it won't be 
A15 177 so much a big dog going against a smaller dog as two good teams 
A15 178 playing 60 minutes of football,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"This is 
A15 179 a different team than it was last time. We're more concerned about 
A15 180 how <tf|>we play than how they play."<quote/><p/>
A15 181 <p_>Defensive lineman Scott Roseman said, <quote_>"This year we're 
A15 182 going to be a lot more humble. Last time we went in there with too 
A15 183 much of an attitude. Little roses on our suits coming off the plane 
A15 184 ... people saw that and figured we were cocky."<quote/><p/>
A15 185 <p_>Roseman remembered that at halftime of the game, with 
A15 186 Washington leading, 24-0, Cal started fighting in the tunnel with 
A15 187 the Huskies. <quote_>"It was behind me,"<quote/> he said. 
A15 188 <quote_>"I heard this yelling in the back. It's an unwise thing to 
A15 189 do - you don't need to get in a conflict at halftime."<quote/><p/>
A15 190 <p_>Those roses, said Roseman, shaking his head. <quote_>"When you 
A15 191 think back, that didn't work too well with our 
A15 192 attitudes."<quote/><p/>
A15 193 <p_>Dawkins smiled at the memory of it. <quote_>"I don't know whose 
A15 194 idea that was, but I'd like to kick their butts,"<quote/> he said. 
A15 195 <quote_>"That was the backbreaker right there."<quote/><p/>
A15 196 <p_>But that was then. This is now.<p/>

A15 203 <p_>SANTA CLARA - Is there a false bottom to the 49ers' fast start 
A15 204 this season? Is some evil little gnome waiting to pull the lever on 
A15 205 the trap door?<p/>
A15 206 <p_>If so, it probably will not happen this week, when the 49ers 
A15 207 travel to the mythical kingdom of New England to play the 0-4 
A15 208 Patriots.<p/>
A15 209 <p_>New England rallied for three touchdowns in its loss to the 
A15 210 Jets on Sunday, but its offense is still ranked 24th in the NFL.<p/>
A15 211 <p_>However, in the first five weeks of a 4-1 season, the 49ers 
A15 212 have shown a pronounced inability to defend the forward pass, 
A15 213 particularly quick, short passes in the middle of the field. San 
A15 214 Francisco's pass defense is ranked 26th, down there in the Land of 
A15 215 Not Good.<p/>
A15 216 <p_>Coach George Seifert admitted Monday that the 49ers played a 
A15 217 soft zone defense against the Rams.

A16   2 <p_>By Ron B. Stapp<p/>
A16   3 <p_>Special to the Daily News<p/><h/>
A16   4 <p_>Throwing under pressure took on a new meaning for Hart 
A16   5 quarterback Davis Delmatoff during a 43-6 victory over Pasadena 
A16   6 Friday at College of the Canyons.<p/>
A16   7 <p_>Delmatoff had plenty of time to throw in the season-opener. His 
A16   8 pressure was self-induced.<p/>
A16   9 <p_>The thought of taking over quarterbacking duties at a school 
A16  10 that had produced four straight All-Southern Section performers at 
A16  11 the position made him feel nauseous earlier in the day.<p/>
A16  12 <p_>But once the game started, he put aside those fears and threw 
A16  13 for six touchdown passes and 380 yards on 23 of 34 passes. He tied 
A16  14 Jimmy Bonds' school-record for scoring passes.<p/>
A16  15 <p_><quote_>"I was a bit nervous before the game, I thought I was 
A16  16 going to get sick a couple of times,"<quote/> Delmatoff said. 
A16  17 <quote_>"But things worked out all right."<quote/><p/>
A16  18 <p_>He led the Indians 63 yards to a touchdown on their first 
A16  19 possession. His 34-yard touchdown pass to Soren Halladay capped the 
A16  20 drive.<p/>
A16  21 <p_><quote_>"It took me until the second or third series before I 
A16  22 got into the flow,"<quote/> Delmatoff said. <quote_>"Everything was 
A16  23 working well. The receivers were running good routes."<quote/><p/>
A16  24 <p_>Delmatoff led the Indians to scores on each of their first 
A16  25 three drives. He hooked up with Halladay again, this time for 36 
A16  26 yards to build the lead to 15-0 with 1:22 left in the opening 
A16  27 period.<p/>
A16  28 <p_>The Bulldogs' lone score came thanks to star running back 
A16  29 Treyvone Towns, who broke through Hart's secondary for a 56-yard 
A16  30 touchdown early in the second quarter.<p/>
A16  31 <p_>In addition to Halladay, who finished with 92 yards on 3 
A16  32 receptions, Delmatoff hooked up with four other receivers. Jared 
A16  33 Halverson had 8 catches for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 
A16  34 5-yard pass from Delmatoff which gave Hart a 36-6 lead with 3:24 
A16  35 left in the third quarter.<p/>
A16  36 <p_>The Bulldogs were held to just three first downs in the first 
A16  37 half, all three coming from Towns and his cousin, quarterback 
A16  38 Lester Towns. The two combined for 149 yards on the ground, 120 by 
A16  39 Treyvone.<p/>

A16  42 <p_>By Kevin Scattareggia<p/>
A16  43 <p_>Special to the Daily News<p/><h/>
A16  44 <p_>For nearly one half Friday night, the Canyon High football team 
A16  45 looked anything but the power<?_>-<?/>house program that head coach 
A16  46 Harry Welch has assembled in his 10 years at the school.<p/>
A16  47 <p_>But over a 15-minute stretch, covering the end of the first 
A16  48 half through the early stages of the fourth quarter, the Cowboys 
A16  49 woke up to score 35 unanswered points en route to a season-opening 
A16  50 35-21 win over host San Clemente.<p/>
A16  51 <p_><quote_>"We started the game with a team that didn't have too 
A16  52 much varsity experience,"<quote/> said Welch. <quote_>"But we 
A16  53 finally began to feel more confident as the game wore 
A16  54 on."<quote/><p/>
A16  55 <p_>The Cowboys, held to just 100 yards total offense in the first 
A16  56 half, came out with a vengeance following intermission.<p/>
A16  57 <p_>After taking the kickoff, Canyon scored on its second play - a 
A16  58 92-yard screen pass from Sean Connelly to fullback Sean McDermott. 
A16  59 The play began innocently enough, but McDermott turned a short gain 
A16  60 into a play that would begin a scoring frenzy.<p/>
A16  61 <p_>On San Clemente's next possession, Triton running back Cyril 
A16  62 Foster fumbled at the Canyon 46, with the Cowboys recovering. It 
A16  63 took Canyon just five plays to score, as Ed Williams went in on a 
A16  64 10-yard run.<p/>
A16  65 <p_>With 8:13 left in the quarter, the Cowboys had tied the score,

A16  67 <p_><quote_>"Once we got it going, it was really tough to stop

A16  70 <p_>It took just three plays for Canyon's defense to come up with 
A16  71 yet another timely turnover. This time, it was Ken Moody's 
A16  72 interception that he returned to the San Clemente 42.<p/>
A16  73 <p_>Canyon kept the ball on the ground six straight plays, with 
A16  74 McDermott going up the middle from the 14 to give the Cowboys a

A16  82 <p_>Thud.<p/>
A16  83 <p_>That sound you just heard was the Highland High football team 
A16  84 coming down to earth.<p/>
A16  85 <p_>Highland, in its first year with seniors on its roster after 
A16  86 opening its doors in 1989, was talking Golden League title entering 
A16  87 its opener Friday.<p/>
A16  88 <p_>But they might settle for merely winning game after taking a 
A16  89 38-0 pounding Friday night by visiting Foothill High of Bakersfield 
A16  90 at Quartz Hill High School. The loss was the worst in Highland's 
A16  91 four<?_>-<?/>year history.<p/>
A16  92 <p_>The Bulldogs committed four turnovers and were thoroughly 
A16  93 manhandled after a scoreless first quarter by a Foothill team rated 
A16  94 No. 1 in Kern County.<p/>
A16  95 <p_><quote_>"I tried to let people know that we were overrated in 
A16  96 the polls,"<quote/> Highland head coach Lin Parker said. 
A16  97 <quote_>"Tonight we just couldn't get our defense off the 
A16  98 field."<quote/><p/>
A16  99 <p_>Foothill led 14-0 at halftime after scoring on the final play 
A16 100 of the second quarter, then dominated the second half.<p/>
A16 101 <p_>Highland committed all four of its turnovers in the second 
A16 102 half, and got only one first down in the final two quarters.<p/>
A16 103 <p_>After being held to only 2 yards in the first quarter, Foothill 
A16 104 took command in the second quarter.<p/>
A16 105 <p_>The Trojans scored first with 3:39 left in the first half when 
A16 106 quarterback Victor Diaz hit Jason Brown with a 3-yard touchdown 
A16 107 pass concluding a seven-play, 49-yard drive.<p/>
A16 108 <p_>The Trojans got the ball back with 2:20 left in the half and 
A16 109 drove 55 yards, scoring on a Diaz pass to Aaron Straw with no time 
A16 110 left on the clock. Rashaan Shehee's conversion run made it 14-0 
A16 111 Foothill at the half.<p/>
A16 112 <p_>The score could have been worse at halftime, but a 41-yard 
A16 113 touch<?_>-<?/>down run by Shehee in the second quarter was 
A16 114 nullified by a holding penalty.<p/>
A16 115 <p_>Diaz completed only seven of 19 passes in the first half, but 
A16 116 they went for 112 yards. He finished completing nine of 24 for 141 
A16 117 yards.<p/>
A16 118 <p_>Highland gained only 67 yards in the first half, 49 by senior 
A16 119 running back Cleveland Williams on 12 carries.<p/>
A16 120 <p_>But Williams suffered a calf bruise midway through the first 
A16 121 half and missed the rest of the game. Highland had only 41 yards in 
A16 122 the second half.<p/>
A16 123 <p_>Foothill scored on its first possession of the second half on a 
A16 124 John Thomas 39-yard field goal. Highland then fumbled on three of 
A16 125 its next four possessions.<p/>
A16 126 <p_><quote_>"Our goal is still to use these games to prepare us for 
A16 127 the league,"<quote/> Parker said. <quote_>"These kids are 
A16 128 resilient. They will bounce back."<quote/><p/>

A16 130 <h_><p_>Turnovers seal 14-7 victory for Notre Dame<p/>
A16 131 <p_>By Dave Shelburne<p/>
A16 132 <p_>Daily News Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A16 133 <p_>The way those Notre Dame running backs were cranking out 
A16 134 yardage early, it looked like it might be a long night for 
A16 135 Alemany.<p/>
A16 136 <p_>It turned out differently, however, and Alemany first-year head 
A16 137 coach Pat Degnan and his Indians can take some satisfaction in that 
A16 138 - even though they lost a 14-7 season opener to the 10th-ranked 
A16 139 Knights on Friday at Alemany.<p/>
A16 140 <p_>Notre Dame fullback Lei Malietuina rushed for a game-high 104 
A16 141 yards, halfback Jabbar Craigwell ran for another 83, and reserve 
A16 142 Jon Velasquez bolted 35 yards on his first carry.<p/>
A16 143 <p_>But the visiting Knights ultimately needed as much from their 
A16 144 defense on a night Alemany kept finding ways to stay within 
A16 145 striking distance and had all of Notre Dame's attention at the 
A16 146 finish.<p/>
A16 147 <p_>It came down to turnovers on the Indians' final two drives - a 
A16 148 fumble recovery by Knights linebacker David Dupetit at the Notre 
A16 149 Dame 39 with 2:50 remaining, then a game-sealing interception by 
A16 150 Joey Orlando with nine seconds left.<p/>
A16 151 <p_><quote_>"They were pretty tough - better than I 
A16 152 thought,"<quote/> Orlando said of the Indians. <quote_>"Thank God, 
A16 153 we hung tough."<quote/><p/>
A16 154 <p_>In the process, Notre Dame backed up its strong running game 
A16 155 with some accurate passing by quarterback Kelly Moran, who 
A16 156 completed five of seven passes - including a 23-yard TD pitch to 
A16 157 Orlando.<p/>
A16 158 <p_>That score, coming in the closing minutes of the first half, 
A16 159 produced a 14-0 lead for the Knights, who had scored on a 29-yard 
A16 160 run by Craigwell on their opening drive of the game.<p/>
A16 161 <p_>It just got tougher after that, starting immediately. Alemany 
A16 162 responded with an 80-yard touch<?_>-<?/>down drive to pull within 
A16 163 14-7 on a one-handed TD catch by Chris Engler with nine seconds 
A16 164 left in the half.<p/>
A16 165 <p_>From there, it was surge and counter-surge, as Malietuina and 
A16 166 Craigwell ran impressively - only to be matched by the passing 
A16 167 accuracy of Alemany quarterback Chris Tashima.<p/>
A16 168 <p_>Tashima started slowly, missing his first six attempts, then 
A16 169 went on a 10-for-11 run to ring up 98 yards before Orlando's late 
A16 170 interceptions.<p/>
A16 171 <p_>Tailback David Eastham, held out most of the week with an 
A16 172 injury, got into the game early for Alemany and contributed a 
A16 173 team<?_>-<?/>high 79 yards rushing.<p/>
A16 174 <p_><quote_>"I learned a few things tonight,"<quote/> said Degnan 
A16 175 after his high-school coaching debut. <quote_>"I'm disappointed 
A16 176 that we didn't win but I'm not disappointed the 
A16 177 <}_><-|>eay<+|>way<}/> we played."<quote/><p/>
A16 178 <p_>Notre Dame went 53 yards in five plays for its first touchdown, 
A16 179 Craigwell running the final 29 one play after Malietuina rumbled 19 
A16 180 on a third-and-six call from near midfield.<p/>
A16 181 <p_>Alemany, held to 63 yards until the final three minutes of the 
A16 182 first half, fell behind 14-0, just before halftime on Moran's 
A16 183 23-yard TD pass to Orlando.<p/>
A16 184 <p_>That seemed to put the Knights in excellent shape, but Alemany 
A16 185 put together its best drive of the night - going 80 yards to score 
A16 186 on Engler's one-handed TD catch 11 seconds before halftime.<p/>
A16 187 <p_>That put the Indians back in the game but as it turned out, 
A16 188 they never got closer.<p/>
A16 189 <p_>Rooney made that sound like a <quote|>"Whew!" after Orlando's 
A16 190 victory sealing interception.<p/>
A16 191 <p_><quote_>"They were real tough,"<quote/> he said of the Indians. 
A16 192 <quote_>"I'm happy we held them to seven points."<quote/><p/>

A16 194 <h_><p_>Three turnovers help Lynwood beat Granada Hills<p/>
A16 195 <p_>By P.C. Shaw<p/>
A16 196 <p_>Special to the Daily News<p/><h/>
A16 197 <p_>The team that controls the line of scrimmage usually wins the 
A16 198 football game and that was the case as Lynwood overpowered the host 
A16 199 Granada Hills Highlanders enroute to a 28-7 season-opening 
A16 200 victory.<p/>
A16 201 <p_>Granada Hills committed three turnovers with the Knights 
A16 202 capitalizing on each one. Two plays after Granada Hills punter 
A16 203 Jimmy Landress fumbled the snap, Lynwood junior quarterback Joe 
A16 204 Austin scored from 1 yard out to give the Knights a 7-0 lead.<p/>
A16 205 <p_>On its next possession, Lynwood drove 78 yards on 5 plays, 
A16 206 culminating in a 33-yard touchdown run down the left sideline by 
A16 207 Jeff Ridgeway.<p/>
A16 208 <p_>Granada Hills was held to 68 yards of total offense in the 
A16 209 first half, 43 of them coming on a pass from Matt Livingston to 
A16 210 Raheem Kyle. Livingston, who only played in the first half finished 
A16 211 with two completions in 11 attempts for 51 yards and two 
A16 212 interceptions.<p/>
A16 213 <p_>Just before halftime Lynwood increased its lead to 21-0 on an 
A16 214 18-yard touchdown run by Ridgeway. Ridgeway finished with a 
A16 215 game-high 108 yards on 14 carries.<p/>
A16 216 <p_>With 7:48 remaining in the third quarter Austin sprinted 35 
A16 217 yards for the Knights' final score.<p/>
A16 218 <p_>Landress scored on Granada Hills lone touchdown on a 2-yard run 
A16 219 with 2:22 left in the game.<p/>

A16 221 <h_><p_>Taft lets lead get away<p/>
A16 222 <p_>Canoga Park rallies, 20-19<p/>
A16 223 <p_>By Rick Marquardt<p/>
A16 224 <p_>Special to the Daily News<p/><h/>
A16 225 <p_>Tailback Rashaud Vaughn scored the winning touchdown on a 
A16 226 7-yard sweep with 1:42 left in the game as host Canoga Park edged 
A16 227 Taft, 20-19, Friday night.<p/>
A16 228 <p_>The Hunters' comeback win spoiled the debuts of Taft head coach 
A16 229 Troy Starr and sophomore tailback Jerry Brown.<p/>
A16 230 <p_>Brown, half-brother of ex-USC star Charles White and uncle of 
A16 231 ex-Crespi standout Russell White, rushed for 166 yards on 19 
A16 232 carries and two touchdowns in his varsity debut. He was up to 174 
A16 233 yards at one point in the fourth quarter but lost yardage on each 
A16 234 of his last three attempts.<p/>
A16 235 <p_>Vaughn led Canoga Park back from a 16-point deficit despite a 
A16 236 painful ankle sprain suffered in the third quarter. He finished 
A16 237 with 118 yards on 24 carries.<p/>
A16 238 <p_>With the Hunters trailing, 19-3, late in the third quarter, 
A16 239 Vaughn made up for an earlier fumble on the Taft 5-yard line by 
A16 240 smashing in from the 1 after Canoga Park blocked a Mike Ferguson 
A16 241 punt.

A17   2 San Francisco<p/>
A17   3 <p_>The Associated Press<p/><h/>
A17   4 <p_>SAN FRANCISCO - Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn said he is 
A17   5 working with local investors to come up with an offer to keep the 
A17   6 San Francisco Giants from a possible move to Florida.<p/>
A17   7 <p_>Shinn met with Mayor Frank M. Jordan, developer Walter 
A17   8 Shorenstein and potential investors on Monday. Shinn and Jordan 
A17   9 later took in a Giants game at Candlestick Park.<p/>
A17  10 <p_>Jordan said the group hoped to have an offer ready within seven 
A17  11 days to present to baseball owners. The eight local investors 
A17  12 weren't identified, except for Shorenstein, and the amount of any 
A17  13 potential offer wasn't disclosed.<p/>
A17  14 <p_>Shinn said he was satisfied with the progress made Monday.<p/>
A17  15 <p_><quote_>"Baseball has been an ultimate dream of mine. Since I 
A17  16 was a kid, I wanted to play the game and realized somehow along the 
A17  17 way that I didn't have the talent to do that,"<quote/> Shinn said. 
A17  18 <quote_>"Then as I became successful in my business career I 
A17  19 realized the next step that maybe I could own a team some day, and 
A17  20 that's the reason I'm here."<quote/><p/>
A17  21 <p_>The NBA owner is said to be prepared to put up $30 million and 
A17  22 borrow an additional $30 million for the team. Local investors 
A17  23 would contribute another $50 million. Shinn wouldn't comment Monday 
A17  24 on any dollar figure about his commitment to the Giants.<p/>
A17  25 <p_><quote_>"Our goal is very simple. Our goal is to put together a 
A17  26 presentation next week to deliver to major league baseball to keep 
A17  27 the San Francisco Giants where they belong - in San 
A17  28 Francisco,"<quote/> Shinn said.<p/>
A17  29 <p_>Giants' owner Bob Lurie announced on Aug. 7 his intention to 
A17  30 sell the team in principle to a group of Tampa Bay area investors 
A17  31 for $111 million. The investors plan to move the Giants to the 
A17  32 Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg.<p/>
A17  33 <p_><quote_>"The ownership group has an exclusive agreement with 
A17  34 Mr. Lurie which we are working to bring to a successful conclusion 
A17  35 in September,"<quote/> said Rick Dodge, St. Petersburg's assistant 
A17  36 city manager. <quote_>"Any interference with that agreement by any 
A17  37 third party creates serious legal issues that we are prepared to 
A17  38 pursue."<quote/><p/>
A17  39 <p_>Lurie has tried for years to move the team from its current 
A17  40 home at windswept Candlestick Park, which he considers unsuitable 
A17  41 for baseball. Area voters have turned down four separate ballot 
A17  42 measures to build a new stadium for the Giants.<p/>
A17  43 <p_>The Florida sale must be approved by 10 of 14 National League 
A17  44 owners and eight of 14 American League owners. Lurie has said he 
A17  45 will not consider any other offers for the team until the owners 
A17  46 vote on the sale.<p/>
A17  47 <p_>Shinn, who also owns two minor league baseball clubs, 
A17  48 reportedly would keep the team at Candlestick until a new stadium 
A17  49 could be built.<p/>
A17  50 <p_>At Candlestick later Monday, an airplane flew overhead during 
A17  51 the Giants game against the New York Mets with a sign reading 
A17  52 <quote_>"George - Save Our Giants."<quote/> When Shinn and Jordan 
A17  53 appeared at the ballpark, shouts of <quote|>"George!" were so 
A17  54 resounding that play was temporarily halted.<p/>
A17  55 <p_>Shorenstein said the meetings Monday were designed to 
A17  56 <quote_>"get acquainted"<quote/> with Shinn and determine the 
A17  57 extent of his commitment to the Giants.<p/>
A17  58 <p_><quote_>"We're prepared to take it to the next step with him, 
A17  59 to discuss the business arrangement. We hope to be able to 
A17  60 penetrate all the difficulties that exist in putting a transaction 
A17  61 of this nature together and we're hopeful we can carry through to 
A17  62 the next step. We're very optimistic,"<quote/> Shorenstein said.<p/>
A17  63 <p_>The developer also would not comment on a specific dollar 
A17  64 amount. He would only say that Shinn's offer was <quote_>"within 
A17  65 our working range."<quote/><p/>
A17  66 <p_><quote_>"We obviously could not buy the team if we weren't able 
A17  67 to take a competitive offer to the owners,"<quote/> Shorenstein 
A17  68 said.<p/>
A17  69 <p_>Jordan said the project was on the right track and that 
A17  70 additional meetings with Shinn would be held today.<p/>

A17  72 <h_><p_>Walsh Excited About Return to College Game<p/>
A17  73 <p_>The Associated Press<p/><h/>
A17  74 <p_>Sitting in front of Cinderella's castle in Anaheim, Calif., 
A17  75 flanked by Mickey, Minnie and the Three Little Pigs, Bill Walsh was 
A17  76 back in the college spirit again Monday.<p/>
A17  77 <p_>No way would some pro coach, except maybe Jerry Glanville, 
A17  78 willingly come to Disneyland and clown with Mickey in front of a 
A17  79 pack of reporters and television cameras. But Walsh handled the 
A17  80 prelude to his return to college coaching with poise.<p/>
A17  81 <p_><quote_>"This is the happiest and most excited I've been in my 
A17  82 career,"<quote/> said Walsh, who returned to Stanford after 10 
A17  83 years in the pros and a stint as an analyst for NBC. <quote_>"The 
A17  84 National Football League is really a tough arena to spend a lot of 
A17  85 time in because the pressures are immense.<p/>
A17  86 <p_>"I can't say I was excited (as a pro coach). I was just trying 
A17  87 to survive in the NFL."<quote/><p/>
A17  88 <p_>As for Wednesday's Pigskin Classic between his 17th-ranked 
A17  89 Cardinal and No. 7 Texas A&M, the man who coached the San Francisco 
A17  90 49ers to three Super Bowl titles is a little edgy.<p/>
A17  91 <p_><quote_>"We're faced with playing our first game with a 
A17  92 completely new coaching staff,"<quote/> Walsh said. <quote_>"That 
A17  93 is a challenge in itself. Just the mechanics of managing a game has 
A17  94 us concerned. We don't quite know how all of us will react as a 
A17  95 unit and a coaching team."<quote/><p/>
A17  96 <p_>While it will be the first test of how Walsh's coaches work 
A17  97 together, Stanford returns 16 starters from last season's squad 
A17  98 that went 8-4 under Dennis Green.<p/>
A17  99 <p_>The Cardinal, which brings a seven-game regular-season winning 
A17 100 streak into the game, will be facing one of the nation's toughest 
A17 101 defenses after having practiced only two weeks.<p/>
A17 102 <p_>The Aggies, the 1991 Southwest Conference champions who went 
A17 103 10-2, have had three weeks to prepare for their earliest game ever 
A17 104 and also return 16 starters. But the big question is at 
A17 105 quarterback, a job won by Jeff Granger despite having missed spring 
A17 106 football while playing baseball.<p/>
A17 107 <p_>R.C. Slocum of the Aggies, entering his fourth year as a 
A17 108 college head coach, said going against someone of Walsh's stature 
A17 109 is an honor.<p/>
A17 110 <p_><quote_>"He's done as much as anyone who's ever coached a 
A17 111 team,"<quote/> Slocum said. <quote_>"I probably even appreciate him 
A17 112 more after all the tapes I watched this summer, especially the 
A17 113 execution of his teams. It may not be as fun to watch it up 
A17 114 close."<quote/><p/>

A17 116 wind down two-a-day practices, working on passing drills and 
A17 117 kickoff-punt coverage. In addition, the Rebels scrimmaged inside 
A17 118 the 20 yardline. The last two-a-day practices will be held today, 
A17 119 as classes at Ole Miss start Wednesday. The team will then revert

A17 125 <p_><quote_>"If he gets well and is able to play, it would be a big 
A17 126 plus for us this year,"<quote/> Hatfield said. <quote_>"When his 
A17 127 leg gets stronger, we'll test it in the training room to determine

A17 132 after he rushed for 941 yards that season, injured his knee in 
A17 133 pregame warmups before the North Carolina State game Oct. 26. He 
A17 134 had rushed for 585 yards before the injury.<p/>
A17 135 <p_>Williams, a junior, underwent knee surgery Dec. 16. The type of

A17 157 <p_>Jones started in seven of nine games last season, connecting on

A17 160 <p_>His best effort came against Southeastern Conference champion 
A17 161 Florida, when he rushed for 77 yards and three touchdowns and

A17 176 <p_>The decision between Shuler and Jerry Colquitt must be made 
A17 177 this week since Tennessee opens the 1992 season at home Sept. 5

A17 195 <h_><p_>Hill, Newton Among Buc Cuts<p/>
A17 196 <p_>By DOUG FERNANDES<p/>
A17 197 <p_>Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A17 198 <p_>TAMPA - The ink on Tim Newton's contract had barely dried when 
A17 199 the Tampa Bay Bucs decided Monday the whole idea wouldn't wash.<p/>
A17 200 <p_>So rather than pay someone $600,000 a year to possibly ride the 
A17 201 bench, Tampa Bay waived Newton, its starting nose tackle last 
A17 202 season, along with cornerback <O_>illegible_word<O/> Carter and 11 
A17 203 other players, several of whom may resurface on the Bucs' practice 
A17 204 squad.<p/>
A17 205 <p_>Others cut loose were wide receiver John Garrett; center Todd 
A17 206 McGuire; tight end Kirk Kirkpatrick; running back Willie McClendon; 
A17 207 defensive lineman Curtis Maxey; linebackers James Malone and Ken 
A17 208 Swilling; defensive backs Sammy Lilly, Marcus Hopkins and Herbert 
A17 209 James; and punter-/place-kicker Klaus Wilmsmeyer.<p/>
A17 210 <p_>The Bucs also unconditionally released holdout wide receiver 
A17 211 Bruce Hill and reached a contract agreement with linebacker Kevin 
A17 212 Murphy. The cuts leave the Bucs with 61 players on the active 
A17 213 roster. They must cut one more by 4 p.m. today.<p/>
A17 214 <p_>Newton's release came as a surprise. The veteran nose tackle 
A17 215 signed a two-year deal last Wednesday, then played briefly in 
A17 216 Saturday night's game against Miami.<p/>
A17 217 <p_>Defensive coordinator Floyd Peters, who coached Newton when 
A17 218 both were at Minnesota, said it was Newton's inability to play more 
A17 219 than one position that caused his release.<p/>
A17 220 <p_><quote_>"We need to have guys who can play more than one 
A17 221 spot,"<quote/> Peters said. <quote_>"It's better to let him go this 
A17 222 week so he can latch on with another team rather than hold onto him 
A17 223 until the final week."<quote/><p/>
A17 224 <p_>Newton (6-foot, 275 pounds) started all 16 games last season. 
A17 225 He came to the Bucs in 1990 as a free agent. Peters said he will 
A17 226 look for a starting nose tackle among Reuben Davis, Mark Duckens 
A17 227 and rookie Mark Wheeler.<p/>
A17 228 <p_><quote_>"In the case of Newton, I feel bad about that 
A17 229 one,"<quote/> said head coach Sam Wyche.

A18   2 cents<p/>

A18   5 <p_>Tribune Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A18   6 <p_>ST. PETERSBURG BEACH - When the National Hockey League's board 
A18   7 of governors sits down to determine the future of fighting in their 
A18   8 game today, they will be talking as much about dollars and cents as 
A18   9 hooks and jabs.<p/>
A18  10 <p_>Among the anti-fighting sect, a growing number of owners fear 
A18  11 the NHL's economic growth will be stifled if fighting is retained. 
A18  12 So with fiscal survival as their theme, the abolitionists will use 
A18  13 the fear of economic disaster as the basis for their pitch to have 
A18  14 fighting banned from the game.<p/>
A18  15 <p_><quote_>"We have to create new resources through television, 
A18  16 expansion and additional licensing, and to do that, one of the 
A18  17 things we've got to do is eliminate fighting,"<quote/> said 
A18  18 Minnesota North Stars owner Norman Green, who is among a group of 
A18  19 at least seven anti-fighting proponents who will push for a ban on 
A18  20 fighting during meetings today at the Don CeSar Resort. <quote_>"We 
A18  21 cannot expect to grow either economically or otherwise unless we 
A18  22 take a firm stand on this issue and send out the message that we do 
A18  23 not condone these bare-fisted battles."<quote/><p/>
A18  24 <p_>In particular, the abolitionists fear that retaining fighting 
A18  25 will hinder or even destroy the NHL's chances of securing a 
A18  26 national network TV contract, which is something the league 
A18  27 desperately needs to combat increasing costs and ensure economic 
A18  28 survival in the 90s.<p/>
A18  29 <p_><quote_>"We cannot get a network TV contract as long as we have 
A18  30 fighting in the game,"<quote/> Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall 
A18  31 said. <quote_>"Believe me, I know, because I've tried. I've talked 
A18  32 with the TV executives."<quote/><p/>
A18  33 <p_>Acting NHL President Gil Stein, who remains neutral on the 
A18  34 fighting issue, has talked - and is still talking - with network TV 
A18  35 executives about a TV deal for the upcoming season, and he said the 
A18  36 NHL still can land a network package with fighting as a part of the 
A18  37 game.<p/>
A18  38 <p_><quote_>"The thing we have to do is take a stand on this one 
A18  39 way or the other and stand behind our decision,"<quote/> he said. 
A18  40 <quote_>"The only way we lose is if we run from the 
A18  41 debate."<quote/><p/>
A18  42 <p_>There seems little chance of that. Although a few other issues 
A18  43 are on today's agenda, Stein is adamant about debating and 
A18  44 eventually taking a vote on fighting.<p/>
A18  45 <p_>He has ordered sub-committees on each side of the debate to 
A18  46 produce position papers explaining their side, and those will be 
A18  47 presented today when the governors meet.<p/>
A18  48 <p_>The papers show that what the pro-fighting forces fear most is 
A18  49 that a ban on fighting will lead to an increase in illegal 
A18  50 stick<?_>-<?/>work.<p/>
A18  51 <p_><quote_>"The issue comes down to what kind of confrontation is 
A18  52 desirable,"<quote/> the pro-fighting paper says. <quote_>"Hockey 
A18  53 players carry weapons. Is the player who is frustrated by illegal 
A18  54 tactics to respond with an accepted, safe and natural release of 
A18  55 emotions through fisticuffs or is he to resort to 
A18  56 stick<?_>-<?/>work."<quote/><p/>
A18  57 <p_>The pro-fighting paper also counters the abolitionists claim 
A18  58 that retaining fighting will hurt the growth of the game and NHL's 
A18  59 chances of securing a network TV deal.<p/>
A18  60 <p_><quote_>"There is a common misconception that the NHL cannot 
A18  61 attract a national network TV deal as a result of 
A18  62 fisticuffs,"<quote/> it says. <quote_>"[Yet] the NHL plays to 92 
A18  63 percent capacity. This indicates that season-ticket holders, the 
A18  64 casual fans, and sports fans in general like the game as it 
A18  65 is."<quote/><p/>
A18  66 <p_>On the issue of excessive stickwork, both sides agree that 
A18  67 penalties need to be increased in an effort to cut down on the 
A18  68 amount of hooking, slashing and high<?_>-<?/>sticking that takes 
A18  69 place.<p/>
A18  70 <p_><quote_>"You will certainly see something done there that will 
A18  71 be a step in the right direction,"<quote/> Stein said.<p/>
A18  72 <p_>Stein said he also expects to get a reading on the Dream Team 
A18  73 concept and to discuss the league's pending TV deals. He said 
A18  74 proposals have been submitted to Sports-Channel America/NBC and 
A18  75 ESPN/ABC and that both call for a specific number of games to be 
A18  76 carried via the national networks.<p/>
A18  77 <p_>On the fighting issue, though, Stein says it's still too close 
A18  78 to call.<p/>
A18  79 <p_><quote_>"It's a real toss-up,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"That's 
A18  80 the only way to describe it."<quote/><p/>

A18  82 <h_><p_>Three more starters from 1991 were released while 
A18  83 linebacker Kevin Murphy agreed to contract terms.<p/>
A18  84 <p_>By NICK PUGLIESE<p/>
A18  85 <p_>Tribune Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A18  86 <p_>TAMPA - The Bucs continued their purge of starters by lopping 
A18  87 three more off their roster Monday, including unsigned wide 
A18  88 receiver Bruce Hill.<p/>
A18  89 <p_>While Hill was given his unconditional release to no one's 
A18  90 surprise, unsigned outside linebacker Kevin Murphy agreed to terms 
A18  91 on a new contract amid speculation that the seven-year veteran will 
A18  92 be traded.<p/>
A18  93 <p_>On the waiver front, two more defensive starters, nose tackle 
A18  94 Tim Newton and right cornerback Carl Carter, were a couple of 
A18  95 notable cuts.<p/>
A18  96 <p_>Three draft choices bit the dust: linebacker James Malone 
A18  97 (sixth round), linebacker/safety Ken Swilling (seventh) and kicking 
A18  98 specialist Klaus Wilmsmeyer (12th).<p/>
A18  99 <p_>Others who were told to turn in their playbooks were tight end 
A18 100 Kirk Kirkpatrick, fullback Willie McClendon, wide receiver John 
A18 101 Garrett, center Todd McGuire, defensive tackle Curtis Maxey and 
A18 102 defensive backs Sammy Lilly, Marcus Hopkins and Herbert James.<p/>
A18 103 <p_>With the roster at 61, the Bucs still must waive one player to 
A18 104 get down to the limit by 4 p.m. today.<p/>
A18 105 <p_>First-year coach Sam Wyche has dropped four starters from last 
A18 106 year's 3-13 team, including Hill, Newton, Carter and middle 
A18 107 linebacker Jesse Solomon, who was given his unconditional release 
A18 108 last Friday.<p/>
A18 109 <p_>Also, guard Tom McHale, defensive tackle Reuben Davis and 
A18 110 Murphy might not be on the roster when the season starts. 
A18 111 Interestingly, all seven of those players were 
A18 112 hold<?_>-<?/>outs.<p/>
A18 113 <p_><quote_>"We had a lot of tough cuts, but next week, it's like 
A18 114 digging out part of your guts,"<quote/> Wyche said, referring to 
A18 115 the final cutdown to 47. <quote_>"You got to keep improving. Every 
A18 116 year sees turnovers. Even Super Bowl teams come back looking 
A18 117 differently<&|sic!>.<p/>
A18 118 <p_>"I wasn't trying to send any kind of message. A lot of it goes 
A18 119 back to the agents. There's an implicit feeling that management's 
A18 120 still trying to screw you one way or the other. You got to be here. 
A18 121 Every day you're not here, you're giving us a chance to fall in 
A18 122 love with somebody else."<quote/><p/>
A18 123 <p_>Hill, a six-year veteran who started the first six games last 
A18 124 season before having knee surgery Oct. 14 and finishing the year on 
A18 125 injured reserve, skipped three of the four minicamps and asked the 
A18 126 team to trade or release him a month ago. He worked out for 
A18 127 Cleveland last Thursday, but the Browns did not make an offer for 
A18 128 him.<p/>
A18 129 <p_>Newton, who had 56 tackles and 5 1/2 sacks last year despite 
A18 130 playing with a broken hand late in the season, was released in 
A18 131 favor of third<?_>-<?/>round pick Mark Wheeler, who apparently has 
A18 132 won the job.<p/>
A18 133 <p_>However, Newton's agent, Jeff Durand, said Newton's exit had 
A18 134 more to do with a personality clash between himself and Wyche and 
A18 135 Vice President Rich McKay, the team's contract negotiator.<p/>
A18 136 <p_><quote_>"I'm not surprised; I'm disappointed,"<quote/> Durand 
A18 137 said. <quote_>"I tried to hold them to their promise to reward Tim 
A18 138 Newton and I took personal offense at the slander against my 
A18 139 character. I called Sam this morning and told him he was a coward 
A18 140 and a bully."<quote/><p/>
A18 141 <p_>Wyche said he felt bad about releasing Newton, but a 27-day 
A18 142 hold<?_>-<?/>out and the inability to play more than one position 
A18 143 on the line hurt the former Florida Gator.<p/>
A18 144 <p_><quote_>"This was a football decision,"<quote/> Wyche said. 
A18 145 <quote_>"I liked Tim and he worked hard in the off-season. Floyd 
A18 146 spoke to him and I spoke to him and we didn't beg him, but we said 
A18 147 as strongly as we could, 'Please be in camp. You're going to have 
A18 148 tough competition. We drafted a kid [Wheeler] who's going to be a 
A18 149 whale of a player.'<p/>
A18 150 <p_>"It wasn't Tim. It was the agent. I can't say this strongly 
A18 151 enough because I don't want Tim to be damaged in this in any way. 
A18 152 He felt he was getting an edge on things by holding Tim out, but he 
A18 153 left this guy with not enough time to make his team."<quote/><p/>
A18 154 <p_>Durand said the negotiations, which concluded last Wednesday 
A18 155 when Newton signed a two-year, $1.2 million contract, were 
A18 156 degrading and unprofessional. Newton earned $275,000 in 1991 and 
A18 157 Durand wanted to push him to the average income for a starting 
A18 158 defensive lineman of $687,000. But Durand said McKay's first offer 
A18 159 was $1,000 above what Newton made last season.<p/>
A18 160 <p_>Davis, who agreed to terms last Thursday and did not play in 
A18 161 Saturday's 22-7 loss at Miami, hopes he does not share Newton's 
A18 162 fate. He said it will be different not to line up next to Newton, 
A18 163 but that change is constant in the NFL.<p/>
A18 164 <p_><quote_>"It's been like that for me the last three or four 
A18 165 years,"<quote/> Davis said. <quote_>"I came in with a bunch of guys 
A18 166 I made friends with and they started going off one by one. I made 
A18 167 friends with John Cannon and I ended up taking his position. That's 
A18 168 what the NFL is about - no job security."<quote/><p/>
A18 169 <p_>The Bucs currently have roster exemptions for Davis and McHale. 
A18 170 Both are expected to be activated for Friday's preseason finale 
A18 171 against Cleveland at Tampa Stadium.<p/>
A18 172 <p_><quote_>"I got a lot on my mind right now and there are things 
A18 173 I can't carry to the field,"<quote/> Davis said. <quote_>"I have to 
A18 174 let nature take its course."<quote/><p/>
A18 175 <p_>Carter, who started 10 of the last 11 games, had been burned 
A18 176 repeatedly in the exhibitions after signing 12 days into training 
A18 177 camp. His days were numbered when the Bucs signed several 
A18 178 cornerbacks off Plan B, including Milton Mack, and drafted Rogerick 
A18 179 Green in the fifth round.<p/>
A18 180 <p_>Of the rookies, Swilling might be the most disappointing. Two 
A18 181 years ago, the Georgia Tech product was projected as a first-round 
A18 182 pick. But injuries and a switch of positions dropped his stock so 
A18 183 far that he fell to the second day of the draft.<p/>
A18 184 <p_>Defensive coordinator Floyd Peters said attitude played a role 
A18 185 in Swilling's cut.<p/>
A18 186 <p_><quote_>"The guy has intelligence and speed and you can see why 
A18 187 everybody likes his talent,"<quote/> Peters said. <quote_>"But he 
A18 188 just doesn't have that fire and competitive spirit. He's not a 
A18 189 mean, tough kid, and this is a tough business. I would say he no 
A18 190 longer wants to punish people and throw his body 
A18 191 around."<quote/><p/>

A18 193 <h_><p_>Ex-Vikings safety Joey Browner passes physical with Bucs 
A18 194 and may sign today.<p/>
A18 195 <p_>By NICK PUGLIESE<p/>
A18 196 <p_>Tribune Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A18 197 <p_>TAMPA - The reunion between former Minnesota strong safety Joey 
A18 198 Browner and Bucs defensive co<?_>-<?/>ordinator Floyd Peters could 
A18 199 happen as soon as today.<p/>
A18 200 <p_>Browner, who was waived on the eve of training camp after the 
A18 201 Vikings said he failed his physical, spent Monday holed up in a 
A18 202 local hotel waiting for his agent, T.J. Pantaleo, to work out a 
A18 203 deal with Bucs Vice President Rich McKay.<p/>
A18 204 <p_>Browner, who worked out and passed a physical for the Bucs on 
A18 205 Sunday, was scheduled to earn $1 million this season with the 
A18 206 Vikings. The two sides were trying to hammer out a new pact that 
A18 207 would pay him somewhat less and probably be based on incentives.<p/>
A18 208 <p_><quote_>"If it all works out and we think he can help us, then 
A18 209 he enters the picture,"<quote/> Coach Sam Wyche said. <quote_>"If 
A18 210 he looks like one of the best 47, then he makes the team.<p/>
A18 211 <p_>"Floyd knows this guy. We feel we have some inside information 
A18 212 on him as a player."<quote/><p/>
A18 213 <p_>Peters talked on Monday as if Browner already was wearing a 
A18 214 Bucs uniform.<p/>
A18 215 <p_><quote_>"If there's a good football player out there, I'm going 
A18 216 to bring him in every time,"<quote/> Peters said. <quote_>"We've 
A18 217 got to get better."<quote/><p/>
A18 218 <p_>If the six-time Pro Bowl performer joins the team, he would not 
A18 219 be the first Browner to wear a Tampa Bay uniform. His brother, 
A18 220 Keith, who plays for Arena Football's Tampa Bay Storm, played for 
A18 221 the Bucs from 1984-86.<p/>
A18 222 <p_>Joey Browner, a 10-year veteran, could push eight-year veteran 
A18 223 Mark Robinson out the door. Robinson, who spent 1991 on injured 
A18 224 reserve with a shoulder injury, was expected to regain his starting 
A18 225 spot but has been bothered by a foot injury during the preseason. 
A18 226 Second<?_>-<?/>year pro Marty Carter has started all three games at 
A18 227 strong safety and has seven tackles and one interception.<p/>

A19   3 <p_>AP Sports Writer<p/><h/>
A19   4 <p_>BARCELONA, Spain - Janet Evans and Matt Biondi, the golden 
A19   5 swimmers for the United States four years ago at Seoul, qualified 
A19   6 for finals today in vastly different fashions.<p/>
A19   7 <p_>Evans easily qualified for the women's 400-meter freestyle, an 
A19   8 event she won as she claimed three individual golds in Seoul. 
A19   9 Biondi, who won seven medals in Seoul, reached the final of the 100 
A19  10 freestyle but only finished fourth.<p/>
A19  11 <p_>In the women's 100 backstroke, Kristina Egerszegi of Hungary 
A19  12 set an Olympic record of 1 minute, 00.85 seconds to shave 
A19  13 one-hundredth of a second off the mark set by Rica Reinisch of 
A19  14 Germany in the 1980 Moscow Olympics.<p/>
A19  15 <p_>Egerszegi, who holds the world record of 1:00.31 in the 100 
A19  16 backstroke, already has one gold medal at these Olympics. She won 
A19  17 the 400 individual medley Sunday.<p/>
A19  18 <p_>Lea Loveless of Crestwood, N.Y., qualified second behind 
A19  19 Egerszegi in 1:01.19. The top U.S. backstroker, Janie Wagstaff of 
A19  20 Mission Hills, Kan., finished fifth in 1:02.29 to make the 
A19  21 final.<p/>
A19  22 <p_>Loveless, 21, was second to Wagstaff at the U.S. trials with a 
A19  23 personal best of 1:01.14.<p/>
A19  24 <p_>Monday's gold medal went to Pablo Morales in the 100 butterfly. 
A19  25 Eric Namesnik won a silver in the 400 individual medley and the 800 
A19  26 freestyle relay team earned bronze.<p/>
A19  27 <p_>In the men's 200 backstroke, American record-holder Royce Sharp 
A19  28 of Houston failed to qualify, but Tripp Schwenk of Sarasota, Fla., 
A19  29 did.<p/>
A19  30 <p_>Sharp, who has the best time in the world this year in 1:58.66, 
A19  31 finished 11th in 2:00.97. Only the top eight times advance to 
A19  32 finals. At the U.S. trials, Schwenk became the third American ever 
A19  33 to better 1:59. He qualified sixth today in 1:59.92.<p/>
A19  34 <p_>World record-holder and crowd favorite Martin Zubero of Spain 
A19  35 led all qualifiers in 1:59.22.<p/>
A19  36 <p_>In the same event, Raymond Papa of the Philippines caused a 
A19  37 stir when judges ruled he deliberately false started. Thousands of 
A19  38 fans booed Papa's disqualification, which delayed the start.<p/>
A19  39 <p_>The team of Angel Martino of Americus Ga., Ashley Tappin of 
A19  40 Metairie, La., Crissy Ahmann-Leighton of Tucson, Ariz., and Dara 
A19  41 Torres of Gainesville, Fla., finished first in the 400 freestyle 
A19  42 relay preliminary with a time of 3:41.57. The German women were 
A19  43 second in 3:43.58.<p/>
A19  44 <p_>The race marked Martino's debut in the Olympics after the 
A19  45 25-year-old was banned from the 1988 U.S. team. Martino, then Angel 
A19  46 Meyers, qualified in three events, but was kicked off the team 
A19  47 after testing positive for a banned substance.<p/>
A19  48 <p_>Jenny Thompson of Dover, N.H., and Nicole Haislett of St. 
A19  49 Petersburg, Fla., were expected to replace two of the preliminary 
A19  50 swimmers in tonight's final. They were rested during the heats.<p/>
A19  51 <p_>Thompson is going for gold again after a disappointing start in 
A19  52 the Olympics. She finished second in the 100 free and failed to 
A19  53 qualify for the 200 free final, which Haislett won.<p/>
A19  54 <p_>Evans, 20, from Placentia, Calif., has not lost in the 400 
A19  55 freestyle in six years. She led the entire way in her heat to win 
A19  56 in 4:09.38, well off the world and Olympic records of 4:03.85 she 
A19  57 set in her gold-medal performance four years ago in Seoul.<p/>
A19  58 <p_>American Erika Hansen also made the final. Hansen, who failed 
A19  59 to qualify for the 400 individual medley final, was third fastest 
A19  60 in the morning preliminary with a time of 4:12.08.<p/>
A19  61 <p_>Hansen, from King of Prussia, Pa., trailed German Dagmar Hase, 
A19  62 who stayed close to Evans and finished in 4:10.92.<p/>
A19  63 <p_>Biondi qualified for the 100 freestyle final in 49.75 seconds, 
A19  64 but his time was only the fourth-best and not as fast as teammate 
A19  65 Jon Olsen, who was third in 49.63.<p/>
A19  66 <p_>Alexandre Popov of the Unified Team led the way in 49.29 
A19  67 seconds, followed by Brazilian Gustavo Borges in 49.49. Borges, who 
A19  68 swims for the University of Michigan, is the NCAA champion in the 
A19  69 event.<p/>
A19  70 <p_>Biondi's finish cost him a prime center lane. By finishing 
A19  71 first and second, Popov and Borges will swim in lanes four and 
A19  72 five. Biondi will start in lane six and Olsen is in lane three.<p/>
A19  73 <p_>Biondi is the world record-holder in the 100 free with a time 
A19  74 of 48.42.<p/>
A19  75 <p_>Thompson, Haislett, Anita Nall and Summer Sanders - swimming's 
A19  76 'New Kids on the Block' - weren't supposed to need Evans to help 
A19  77 the U.S. team win Olympic gold medals.<p/>
A19  78 <p_>Now they need her more than ever.<p/>
A19  79 <p_>Nerves have gotten the best of the youngsters, especially 
A19  80 Thompson and Nall - two world record-holders who missed gold in 
A19  81 their signature events.<p/>
A19  82 <p_>So far, the women have won only one gold, one silver and two 
A19  83 bronzes. That's about two gold medals short of what was 
A19  84 expected.<p/>
A19  85 <p_>The medal count was expected to rise today, since Evans was the 
A19  86 heavy favorite in the 400 freestyle. She also is favored in the 800 
A19  87 freestyle on Thursday.<p/>
A19  88 <p_>In 1988, Evans and Biondi took turns winning the only Olympic 
A19  89 gold medals captured by U.S. swimmers. Evans won three in the 
A19  90 distance races; Biondi won two in the sprints.<p/>
A19  91 <p_>Evans hasn't lost a 400 freestyle race since the U.S. Long 
A19  92 Course Nationals in 1986.<p/>
A19  93 <p_><quote_>"I want to do well for myself just to prove to myself 
A19  94 that I can do it,"<quote/> she said.<p/>
A19  95 <p_>Her performance in the grueling 400 should steady the shaky 
A19  96 U.S. women, unnerved by Thompson's failures.<p/>
A19  97 <p_><quote_>"We had a lot of pressure on us coming into this meet. 
A19  98 We didn't swim poorly, we just didn't swim as well as we had 
A19  99 hoped,"<quote/> said Haislett, who narrowly hung on for gold in the 
A19 100 200 freestyle Monday.<p/>
A19 101 <p_>Evans said her second Olympics is different than Seoul, where 
A19 102 as a 16-year-old sprite she fearlessly took on and beat the East 
A19 103 Germans.<p/>
A19 104 <p_><quote_>"I've been through all this before and it's not as much 
A19 105 of a novelty,"<quote/> she said. <quote_>"I think it's helped me 
A19 106 because I can relax and kind of take it all in stride."<quote/><p/>
A19 107 <p_>Nall, 16, of Towson, Md., faded in the stretch of the 200 
A19 108 breaststroke to finish behind 14-year-old Kyoko Iwasaki of Japan, 
A19 109 who set an Olympic record of 2:26.65, and Lin Li of China, who was 
A19 110 clocked in 2:26.85.<p/>

A19 113 <p_>By BILL BARNARD<p/>
A19 114 <p_>AP Basketball Writer<p/><h/>
A19 115 <p_>BARCELONA, Spain - Point guards Magic Johnson and John Stockton 
A19 116 are hurt and Charles Barkley is still making mischief.<p/>
A19 117 <p_>So what happens?<p/>
A19 118 <p_>The U.S. Olympic basketball team beats medal favorite Croatia 
A19 119 103-70 Monday night, the closest victory the Americans have had in 
A19 120 nine games, but still a blowout.<p/>
A19 121 <p_>They did it without Johnson for more than three-quarters of the 
A19 122 game because of a strained muscle in his right knee. Stockton has 
A19 123 been out with a cracked bone in his right leg since June 29.<p/>
A19 124 <p_><quote_>"I stepped away and felt it pull,"<quote/> said 
A19 125 Johnson, who stood up for interviews after the game.<p/>
A19 126 <p_>An MRI showed nothing serious, and Johnson was listed as 
A19 127 day-to<?_>-<?/>day. He'll have full rest Tuesday, with no game or 
A19 128 practice scheduled.<p/>
A19 129 <p_>Johnson, the only player who has started every game for Team 
A19 130 USA, was unconcerned that one injury would stop the parade of 
A19 131 blowouts.<p/>
A19 132 <p_><quote_>"If I have to miss, I will,"<quote/> Johnson said. 
A19 133 <quote_>"This team could play without a lot of people."<quote/><p/>
A19 134 <p_>For the Dream Team, whose previous closest game was 38 points 
A19 135 over Puerto Rico in the Olympic qualifying tournament, the game 
A19 136 against Croatia was an opportunity to measure the size of its 
A19 137 dominance.<p/>
A19 138 <p_><quote_>"It was good for our team to be focused on a 
A19 139 challenge,"<quote/> Michael Jordan said. <quote_>"Our focus on this 
A19 140 game was a lot better. In our minds it was a tough game, even 
A19 141 though we overwhelmed them with our manpower. We knew this was a 
A19 142 team that would challenge us."<quote/><p/>
A19 143 <p_><quote_>"We wanted to gauge our team with this game,"<quote/> 
A19 144 Johnson said. <quote_>"I'd say we still have a passing 
A19 145 grade."<quote/><p/>
A19 146 <p_>Croatia, with six players from Yugoslavia's 1988 Olympic silver 
A19 147 medalist team, figured to be one of the American's toughest 
A19 148 tests.<p/>
A19 149 <p_>Drazen Petrovic of the New Jersey Nets scored 19 points and 
A19 150 Stojko Vrankovic of the Boston Celtics had 11 points and four 
A19 151 blocked shots. Dino Radja, a Celtics draftee, scored 14 points on 
A19 152 6-of-10 shooting.<p/>
A19 153 <p_>But the man Team USA concentrated on was Toni Kukoc, considered 
A19 154 by many to be the most talented player in Europe.<p/>
A19 155 <p_>The absence of Johnson and Stockton left the U.S. team without 
A19 156 a true point guard on the roster. But Chicago Bulls Jordan and 
A19 157 Scottie Pippen did the job anyway.<p/>
A19 158 <p_>Pippen blanketed Kukoc for most of the game and then said the 
A19 159 Croat superstar, who scored just four points, is overrated.<p/>
A19 160 <p_><quote_>"He's OK, not as great as people said and I 
A19 161 anticipated,"<quote/> Pippen said. <quote_>"I don't know he's even 
A19 162 the best European player here. That's probably Drazen 
A19 163 Petrovic."<quote/><p/>
A19 164 <p_>Petrovic hit three 3-pointers in a one-minute span late in the 
A19 165 first half to lead a Croatia rally, but he had foul trouble and 
A19 166 scored just two of his 19 points in the second half.<p/>
A19 167 <p_>Kukoc, courted intensely by the Bulls last year, was defensed 
A19 168 superbly by Pippen, who made just his third start for Team USA. 
A19 169 Pippen and Jordan both resented the attention given Kukoc by Bulls 
A19 170 general manager Jerry Krause.<p/>
A19 171 <p_>Barkley, whose intentional elbow foul against Angola in the 
A19 172 U.S. opener on Sunday turned the fans against him, heard more 
A19 173 derisive whistles in the first half against Croatia.<p/>

A19 175 <h_><p_>Spikers Shave Heads To Support Teammate<p/>
A19 176 <p_>By NESHA STARCEVIC<p/>
A19 177 <p_>Associated Press Writer<p/><h/>
A19 178 <p_>BARCELONA, Spain - Bob Samuelson promises to play hard. That's 
A19 179 what the U.S. <}_><-|>teams<+|>team<}/> needs. Just turn down the 
A19 180 volume a bit.<p/>
A19 181 <p_>With its opening-game victory against Japan taken away because 
A19 182 Samuelson yelled at officials, the Americans will have to be on 
A19 183 their best behavior against Canada today.<p/>
A19 184 <p_>Their feelings will be apparent - they cut off their hair 
A19 185 Monday night to show support for Samuelson.<p/>
A19 186 <p_>The Americans, hoping to become the first to win three straight 
A19 187 volleyball gold medals, saw their five<?_>-<?/>set, comeback 
A19 188 victory against Japan overturned into a four-set defeat Monday by 
A19 189 the International Volleyball Federation.<p/>
A19 190 <p_><quote_>"We've got our backs to the wall, but we have faced and 
A19 191 handled adversity before, and we are prepared to handle it 
A19 192 again,"<quote/> coach Fred Sturm said. <quote_>"Our goal of winning 
A19 193 the gold medal has not changed."<quote/><p/>
A19 194 <p_>The trouble began when Samuelson, a firebrand of Playa del Rey, 
A19 195 Calif., got a second yellow card for yelling at officials at match 
A19 196 point for Japan in the fourth set. The rules clearly call for a red 
A19 197 card to be issued at that point and the awarding of a technical 
A19 198 point to Japan.<p/>
A19 199 <p_>Leading 2-1 in games and 14-13 on its serve when the Samuelson 
A19 200 incident occurred, Japan would have won the match if the rules had 
A19 201 been applied, but referee Ramis Samedow of Azerbaijan didn't want 
A19 202 to end it that way and allowed play to continue.<p/>
A19 203 <p_>But the FIBV officials, acting on a Japanese protest, decided 
A19 204 that the rules were clearly broken and declared Japan the winner in 
A19 205 four sets.<p/>
A19 206 <p_>The ruling did not take away U.S. chances of defending the gold 
A19 207 medal, but it reduced the safety cushion.<p/>
A19 208 <p_>Four nations from the six-team pool will advance to the 
A19 209 quarterfinals and the Americans should still make it. Samuelson was 
A19 210 praised by Sturm after the Japan game for <quote_>"making so many 
A19 211 things happen"<quote/> and <quote_>"lifting the team in so many 
A19 212 areas."<quote/><p/>
A19 213 <p_>But that was before the impact of Samuelson's outburst became 
A19 214 known.<p/>
A19 215 <p_>Samuelson came into the game only as a replacement for Bryan 
A19 216 Ivie, the middle blocker from Manhattan Beach, Calif., who went out 
A19 217 with a right knee injury and is doubtful for today's game.<p/>
A19 218 <p_><quote_>"This is a very disappointing situation, but I am 
A19 219 prepared to come back versus Canada on Tuesday and play as hard as 
A19 220 I have ever played,"<quote/> Samuelson said. <quote_>"I think the 
A19 221 decision will be used to fire our team for the rest of the 
A19 222 Olympics.<p/>
A19 223 <p_>"I did not realize that they assessed me a second yellow card, 
A19 224 but it is something that I will have to deal with. There is nothing 
A19 225 that we can do about the decision except play hard the remainder of 
A19 226 the Olympics."<quote/><p/>

A20   2 <p_>The Dream Team is everyone else's nightmare. It should be no 
A20   3 contest, unless...<p/>
A20   4 <p_>By PAUL A. WITTEMAN<p/>
A20   5 <p_>Reported by Brian Cazeneuve / Portland<p/><h/>
A20   6 <p_>THE PLAYERS ON THE BENCH SAW IT coming, edging forward on their 
A20   7 seats in anticipation. Michael Jordan was about to take the 
A20   8 defender from Argentina on a quick and not-so-flattering trip to 
A20   9 the hoop. Two-hundred-kilo sneakers: that's what it appeared the 
A20  10 Argentine was wearing as Jordan effortlessly rose as from a 
A20  11 trampoline for one of his trademark, gravity-defying pirouettes 
A20  12 above the rim. The Argentine seemed to shrink to the size of a 
A20  13 circus midget. As Jordan dunked the ball, the players on the bench 
A20  14 leaped up and cheered the best basketball player the world has ever 
A20  15 seen. In Spanish.<p/>
A20  16 <p_>That's right. The players cheering Jordan so wildly were the 
A20  17 very Argentines whom he was reducing to the level of kids playing 
A20  18 pickup on the playground. No matter. <quote_>"I played with great 
A20  19 happiness against the monsters,"<quote/> Argentine center Hernan 
A20  20 Montenegro said later. Added guard Marcelo Milanesio: <quote_>"When 
A20  21 we met at the center of the court, I was very excited that it was 
A20  22 Magic Johnson shaking my hand."<quote/><p/>
A20  23 <p_>So it went at the Tournament of the Americas in Portland, 
A20  24 Oregon, last month, where the Argentines and everyone else came to 
A20  25 pose for pictures with Michael, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and their 
A20  26 merry band of National Basketball Association All-Star troubadours. 
A20  27 In between, they played a little basketball. Very little. Take 
A20  28 Cuba: with 3 1/2 min. remaining in the game, the team was behind by 
A20  29 70 points, and only the final horn saved it from losing by 100 or 
A20  30 more. Panama dropped a cliff-hanger by a mere 60.<p/>
A20  31 <p_>When the tournament ended, with the Americans barely breaking a 
A20  32 sweat except on the golf course, where they seemed to spend most of 
A20  33 their time, everyone was ready to concede the gold medal in 
A20  34 Barcelona to the assemblage now and forever more to be known simply 
A20  35 as the Dream Team. Nevada bookmakers, who never miss an opportunity 
A20  36 to make a dollar, have fastidiously refused to post odds or take a 
A20  37 bet. The only surer wager than the Dream Team may be that George 
A20  38 Foreman will not try to make it next as a featherweight.<p/>
A20  39 <p_>U.S. coach Chuck Daly has at his disposal the greatest arsenal 
A20  40 of offensive and defensive weapons ever gathered on a basketball 
A20  41 court. There are passers with 360<*_>degree<*/> vision like Bird 
A20  42 (despite his creaky back), John Stockton and Magic. Chris Mullin 
A20  43 and Jordan are excellent three-point shooters. No one in possession 
A20  44 of his faculties and desirous of retaining them would dare drive 
A20  45 down the lane into territory defended by Charles Barkley, Patrick 
A20  46 Ewing and Karl Malone. Jordan and his Chicago Bulls teammate 
A20  47 Scottie Pippen are tenacious open-court defenders. Then too there 
A20  48 are Clyde Drexler and the Admiral, David Robinson. Twelfth man 
A20  49 Christian Laettner will probably get a great view of all this 
A20  50 talent mostly from the bench.<p/>
A20  51 <p_>And what of the Olympic opposition? The dissolution of the 
A20  52 Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has eviscerated the teams that won the 
A20  53 gold and silver medals in Seoul in 1988. The best former Soviet 
A20  54 players now wear the uniform of Lithuania. Drazen Petrovic and 
A20  55 Vlade Divac led Yugoslavia to the silver medal at Seoul. This time, 
A20  56 however, Yugoslavia as such has been banned from Barcelona. 
A20  57 Petrovic, a New Jersey Net, will play for Croatia. Divac, a Los 
A20  58 Angeles Laker and a Serb, will not be allowed to play. The Germans 
A20  59 will be competitive; N.B.A. star Detlef Schrempf will make them so. 
A20  60 And in Oscar Schmidt, the Brazilians have one of the game's best 
A20  61 three-point shooters. But even if you put all these players on one 
A20  62 squad, it would make no difference. The remaining 11 teams in the 
A20  63 Olympic tournament will be scuffling for silver.<p/>
A20  64 <p_>Still, American coach Daly is not known as the 'prince of 
A20  65 pessimism' for nothing. He is publicly worried that since games in 
A20  66 the Olympics are eight minutes shorter than those in the N.B.A., 
A20  67 his juggernaut might dawdle, fall behind and wait until it is too 
A20  68 late to mount a rally. Hey, chill out, replies Jordan. <quote_>"We 
A20  69 have too much talent, and we'll turn it on whenever we have 
A20  70 to."<quote/> Daly frets that the three-point shooting line in 
A20  71 international basketball is closer to the basket than in the N.B.A. 
A20  72 and that the lane is wider, both tending to nullify the Americans' 
A20  73 height advantage. However, after seeing how little difference these 
A20  74 factors made in his team's 136-57 loss to the Yanks, Cuban coach 
A20  75 Miguel Gomez seemed transported to a Zen mode. <quote_>"One finger 
A20  76 cannot cover the sun,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A20  77 <p_>But the dream that must give Daly the worst night sweats 
A20  78 features a player like Butch Lee. Back in 1976, Lee was not invited 
A20  79 to the U.S. Olympic basketball trials. Instead, he played for the 
A20  80 team from his native Puerto Rico. Spurred by a desire for revenge 
A20  81 over the slight he felt he had suffered at the hands of the U.S. 
A20  82 selection committee, Lee whipsawed the Americans with the 
A20  83 performance of his life. He scored 35 points and almost 
A20  84 single-handedly took the highly favored U.S. team to within seconds 
A20  85 of a humiliating loss.<p/>
A20  86 <p_>In Daly's updated nightmare, the Butch Lee role is played by 
A20  87 Lithuanian Sarunas Marciulionis, an N.B.A. star who plays for the 
A20  88 Golden State Warriors. Daly sees Marciulionis sinking 
A20  89 three-pointers like an automaton from nine meters, with Lithuanian 
A20  90 center Arvidas Sarbonis playing for one night like Bill Russell in 
A20  91 his prime.<p/>
A20  92 <p_>Maybe. All sporting contests before they are played contain an 
A20  93 element that Princeton basketball coach Pete Carril calls 
A20  94 <quote_>"glorious uncertainty."<quote/> Anything can happen, as 
A20  95 Carril's teams have proved season after remarkable season against 
A20  96 superior opposition. But not this superior. <quote_>"This is not a 
A20  97 great team,"<quote/> says Carril. <quote_>"This is the greatest 
A20  98 team ever."<quote/> Don Nelson, the shrewd and artful coach of the 
A20  99 Golden State Warriors, whose son Donn is helping to coach 
A20 100 Marciulionis and the Lithuanians, agrees. <quote_>"The 
A20 101 once-in-a-lifetime game is not going to happen,"<quote/> he says. 
A20 102 <quote_>"The Dream Team will not allow any second shots. Even if 
A20 103 the Americans play poorly, there shouldn't be a close game. They 
A20 104 haven't even tried yet."<quote/><p/>
A20 105 <p_>When they do, is a shutout conceivable? Now there's a fantasy 
A20 106 for the Dream Team to ponder. Sleep on it, Michael. Just don't 
A20 107 forget to set your alarm clock.<p/>

A20 109 <h_><p_><foreign|>BENVINGUTS TO THE CATALAN GAMES!<p/>
A20 110 <p_>Barcelona flashes its many stylish differences as the arc of 
A20 111 the opening arrow begins the dazzling five-ring show<p/>
A20 112 <p_>By PICO IYER BARCELONA<p/><h/>
A20 113 <p_>IMAGINE A PROUD, SERIOUS OLD man, not without some gruffness. 
A20 114 Imagine that he is a prosperous merchant, having made enough money, 
A20 115 on his own terms, to indulge himself in moments of whimsy, flashes 
A20 116 of dandy vanity. Imagine further that he has seen empires and 
A20 117 invaders come and go. Now, having dusted the furniture and 
A20 118 repainted the house, he throws open the doors to his elegant old 
A20 119 home to reveal ... a dazzle of tropi-colored tricks.<p/>
A20 120 <p_>That was a little how it felt as Barcelona, the often unshaven 
A20 121 but designer-crazy capital of Catalonia, set flame to the Games of 
A20 122 the 25th Olympiad. The occasion was a golden opportunity for 
A20 123 presenting the city as a shiny new capital of a postnational world. 
A20 124 It was also a quadrilingual glimpse into a multicultural future. 
A20 125 Music at the celebrations that opened the Games came from an atlas 
A20 126 of names - Ryuichi Sakamoto, Angelo Badalamenti (of <tf_>Twin 
A20 127 Peaks<tf/> fame), Andrew Lloyd Webber; Pl<*_>a-acute<*/>cido 
A20 128 Domingo was followed by a sea of 'living sculptures' designed by a 
A20 129 man from the West Indies. And some of the grandest cheers of all 
A20 130 came as the unfamiliar Lithuanian flag hung over costumes fashioned 
A20 131 by Issey Miyake.<p/>
A20 132 <p_>As soon as the opening ceremonies began, moreover, records 
A20 133 began falling like tenpins: the most nations competing (172), the 
A20 134 most athletes in attendance (almost 11,000, or five times as many 
A20 135 as in the Winter Games), the highest number of television viewers 
A20 136 (a projected 3.5 billion). But numbers did scant justice to 
A20 137 emotions: to the sense of quiet pleasure as one of the first teams 
A20 138 to enter was South Africa, here after a 32-year absence; to the 
A20 139 shiver of unease as Iran alone paraded behind a man, not a woman, 
A20 140 bearing its name; to the bewilderment that met the Unified Team, 
A20 141 amid its cacophony of 12 republics' flags. And when 
A20 142 Bosnia-Herzegovina appeared, after an eleventh-hour entry, people 
A20 143 rose spontaneously around the stands to cheer.<p/>
A20 144 <p_>The most prominent country in the early going, however, had 
A20 145 been one that did not march but made its presence felt at every 
A20 146 turn: independent-minded Catalonia, which is determined to cast 
A20 147 these as the Catalan, not the Spanish, Games. A longtime enemy of 
A20 148 Castile, delighting in a language that Franco had banned, Barcelona 
A20 149 was eager not just to show off its faster, higher, stronger self - 
A20 150 reconstruction is almost as trendy as deconstruction here - but to 
A20 151 emphasize its distance from the Spain of myth, and of Madrid. 
A20 152 <tf_>FREEDOM FOR CATALONIA<tf/> signs (in English) were draped from 
A20 153 balconies and shoulders, and buttons and stickers proclaiming 
A20 154 Catalonian independence were handed out even to kids from 
A20 155 California. The Catalan flag, four bloodred fingers on a field of 
A20 156 yellow, seemed to be fluttering from every window - 28 of them on a 
A20 157 single building! - and not one Spanish banner was in sight. As the 
A20 158 opening arrow approached, every other shop seemed to be saying 
A20 159 <foreign|>benvinguts - 'welcome' in the new Olympic language of 
A20 160 Catalan - to what was locally known as the <tf_>Jocs 
A20 161 Olimpics<tf/>.<p/>
A20 162 <p_>In a deeper sense, though, the weathered, down-to-earth city 
A20 163 seemed too rooted and too various to be greatly transformed by 
A20 164 pervasive Cobi (as the Olympic mascot is called). Barcelona 
A20 165 appeared ready to take over the world, and not the other way round. 
A20 166 In Seville, when the Olympic torch arrived on its way to the 
A20 167 opening ceremonies, crowds flocked into the Plaza de San Francisco 
A20 168 to snap up Cobi dolls, key rings and T shirts, and catch a flash of 
A20 169 history. In Barcelona, by contrast, life continued as usual. It 
A20 170 flows and crests from dawn to dawn here: sunny Sunday mornings 
A20 171 watching the albino gorilla in the zoo; early evenings in the 
A20 172 stained<?_>-<?/>glass quiet of Santa Mar<*_>i-acute<*/>a del Mar; 
A20 173 late, late evenings with thrashing guitars at the penumbral 
A20 174 nightclub KGB. Old women dance stately <tf|>sardanes in front of 
A20 175 the cathedral, and men in silk ties ride scooters to the office. 
A20 176 Smiling pickpockets filch bank notes from the wallets of sightseers 
A20 177 while placing roses in their hair.<p/>
A20 178 <p_>In the balmy beach-front Olympic Village, as the teams began 
A20 179 arriving, 50 or more Iranians could be seen sitting in rows in dull 
A20 180 beige uniforms, like nothing so much as condemned <tf_>POWS<tf/>, 
A20 181 fending off questions about why their team consisted of 40 men and 
A20 182 zero women (<quote_>"Their records are not strong."<quote/> 
A20 183 <quote_>"Women are not interested in sports"<quote/>). On the other 
A20 184 side of the room, Enos Mafokate, the lone black member of South 
A20 185 Africa's equestrian contingent, was red-eyed with exhaustion and 
A20 186 excitement. <quote_>"For 30 years,"<quote/> he said, <quote_>"I 
A20 187 have dreamed of this. When they told me I was going to the Games, I 
A20 188 could not open my mouth for three hours. I could not even move my 
A20 189 jaw. This is something I will never forget!"<quote/><p/>
A20 190 <p_>Around him, other athletes were pounding away at a Super Monaco 
A20 191 GP video game, driving through a simulated Monte Carlo, even as the 
A20 192 stars of the U.S. basketball team were in the real Monaco, driving 
A20 193 the lane. Their performances were eagerly anticipated. Along the 
A20 194 main promenade of town, the tree-lined Ramblas, sidewalk artists 
A20 195 had already added Magic Johnson's face to the standard repertoire 
A20 196 of Marilyn Monroe and Emperor Hirohito, and copies of Magic's 
A20 197 biography were piling up next to canine pianists, peep shows and 
A20 198 Ecuadorian panpipers.<p/>
A20 199 <p_>Meanwhile, more and more newcomers could be seen trying to 
A20 200 figure out a city where <tf|>pijamas are desserts and streets have 
A20 201 periods in the middle of their names (Paral.Lel). Journalists were 
A20 202 struggling to work out why three different coins were worth a 
A20 203 peseta (less than a cent) and whether the regal 
A20 204 Pla<*_>c-cedille<*/>a de Catalunya really was enhanced by an 
A20 205 enormous inflatable M&M.

A21   2 <p_>Dodgers Pitcher Coming Off No-Hit Performance<p/>
A21   3 <p_>By Joe Goddard<p/>
A21   4 <p_>Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A21   5 <p_>LOS ANGELES - The Cubs knew all about Kevin Gross before they 
A21   6 faced him Saturday night.<p/>
A21   7 <p_>They knew him as the man who struck out 12 of them in just 
A21   8 seven innings last May 18, and read all about him last week when he 
A21   9 no<?_>-<?/>hit the Giants.<p/>
A21  10 <p_><quote_>"Our game was the first time I saw him,"<quote/> Cubs 
A21  11 manager Jim Lefebvre said of the Dodgers veteran. <quote_>"He had 
A21  12 great stuff. I mean, great. He had his hook [curve] going. He was 
A21  13 really breaking 'em off. We were lucky to catch up to 
A21  14 him."<quote/><p/>
A21  15 <p_>Mark Grace wasn't surprised at Gross' achievement.<p/>
A21  16 <p_><quote_>"He got me twice in that [12-strikeout] game,"<quote/> 
A21  17 the .308 hitter said. <quote_>"Fortunately, we beat him. Otherwise, 
A21  18 he'd have made us all look silly."<quote/><p/>
A21  19 <p_>It was a somewhat silly game for Grace personally. He had two 
A21  20 triples, but also made his last two errors of the season.<p/>
A21  21 <p_><quote_>"I know Kevin doesn't have a winning record, but that 
A21  22 doesn't always mean you're not a good pitcher,"<quote/> Grace said. 
A21  23 <quote_>"He's played for some bad teams."<quote/><p/>
A21  24 <p_>Gross has had four days to think about the gem he achieved. He 
A21  25 threw only 99 pitches, 71 for strikes.<p/>
A21  26 <p_>He felt the odds are heavily stacked against duplicating Johnny 
A21  27 Vander Meer's consecutive no<?_>-<?/>hitters in 1938 for 
A21  28 Cincinnati.<p/>
A21  29 <p_><quote_>"It's such a longshot to do two of them in a 
A21  30 row,"<quote/> said Gross, who has a 3.37 ERA, but only a 6-12 
A21  31 record.<p/>
A21  32 <p_><quote_>"The time has gone by so fast between starts that I 
A21  33 really haven't had time to think about it.<p/>
A21  34 <p_>"I threw on the sidelines Thursday and had fantastic stuff. 
A21  35 I've actually had good stuff all season, but that doesn't always 
A21  36 mean anything.<p/>
A21  37 <p_>"I started off sharp before the no-hitter, too. The Reds didn't 
A21  38 get a hit until the fifth inning.<p/>
A21  39 <p_>"I'll go out there and give it my best shot and see what 
A21  40 happens."<quote/><p/>
A21  41 <p_>The only Giant close to getting a hit off Gross was Robby 
A21  42 Thompson.<p/>
A21  43 <p_>His line drive in the eighth inning was speared by shortstop 
A21  44 Jose Offerman, who had to leap.<p/>
A21  45 <p_>Gross draws a blank on what happened after Willie McGee flied 
A21  46 to left field for the final out. <quote_>"It was a blur,"<quote/> 
A21  47 he said.<p/>
A21  48 <p_>It has been the only no-hitter of the season. There were seven 
A21  49 last year and eight in 1990, but none the previous two years.<p/>
A21  50 <p_>Gross' only claim to fame before the no-hitter was 
A21  51 embarrassing. He was caught using sandpaper to scuff baseballs in a 
A21  52 1987 game with the Phillies and was suspended 10 games.<p/>
A21  53 <p_>Holder of a 96-113 record, Gross has not had a winning season 
A21  54 since 1985, when he was 15-13 with the Phillies.<p/>
A21  55 <p_>He did, however, make the All-Star team in 1988, finish second 
A21  56 to Mark Langston in league strikeouts in 1989 with 158 and stop 
A21  57 Lenny Dykstra's 23-game hit streak in 1990.<p/>
A21  58 <p_>Both teams came into the game a little tired from a 12-inning 
A21  59 Friday night game the Cubs won 3-2.<p/>
A21  60 <p_>Steve Buechele drove in the first and last runs of the game, 
A21  61 but had a throwing error at third that allowed the Dodgers to get 
A21  62 back in the game off Greg Maddux.<p/>
A21  63 <p_><quote_>"Strange night,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A21  64 <p_>Bob Scanlan earned his eighth save in 10 opportunities to take 
A21  65 over the club lead from Paul Assenmacher and Jim Bullinger.<p/>
A21  66 <p_>The Dodgers had tied the game in the ninth off Maddux on a 
A21  67 double by Offerman that sent pinch-runner Eric Young home from 
A21  68 first base.<p/>
A21  69 <p_>Young tripped rounding second, but was able to beat Buechele's 
A21  70 throw home when center fielder Doug Dascenzo overthrew the 
A21  71 cut<?_>-<?/>off man, Jose Vizcaino.<p/>
A21  72 <p_>Buechele mad up for it with his game-winning, loop single in 
A21  73 the 12th.<p/>
A21  74 <p_><quote_>"I'll take 'em any way I can get 'em,"<quote/> he 
A21  75 said.<p/>

A21  77 <h_><p_>It's Testing Time for Fernandez<p/>
A21  78 <p_>By Toni Ginnetti<p/>
A21  79 <p_>Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A21  80 <p_><p_>The only thing old about young Alex Fernandez is the 
A21  81 refrain he gets tired of hearing.<p/>
A21  82 <p_>That he's still just a kid.<p/>
A21  83 <p_>That his climb to the majors was too quick.<p/>
A21  84 <p_>That he has much to learn about pitching in the major 
A21  85 leagues.<p/>
A21  86 <p_><quote_>"That gets real old,"<quote/> Fernandez admitted: 
A21  87 <quote_>"Yeah, I'm young. I just turned 23. But I'm here for a 
A21  88 reason - and it's that I can pitch in the big leagues."<quote/><p/>
A21  89 <p_>Only this year, though, that has been a test for the 
A21  90 tender-aged White Sox pitcher who reached the big leagues two years 
A21  91 ago after a meteoric two-month ascent through the minors.<p/>
A21  92 <p_>Even for one of baseball's most heralded rookie phenoms, his 
A21  93 was an almost unheard-of climb:<p/>
A21  94 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Fernandez, then but 20, drafted as the 
A21  95 first-round pick of the Sox in June, 1990 out of Miami Dade South 
A21  96 Community College after having collected National Junior College 
A21  97 Player of the Year honors, the Golden Spikes Award as amateur 
A21  98 baseball's top player and the Dick Howser Award.<p/>
A21  99 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Fernandez, winning six of seven decisions 
A21 100 for the Class A Sarasota and Class AA Birmingham affiliates with a 
A21 101 1.83 over-all ERA, and 1.08 at Birmingham.<p/>
A21 102 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Fernandez, arriving Aug. 2 at Milwaukee 
A21 103 County Stadium for his first major league start and making it 
A21 104 memorable, throwing seven innings of five-hit ball before leaving 
A21 105 with a 2-1 lead, though not getting the Sox' eventual victory.<p/>
A21 106 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Fernandez posting a 5-5 mark and 3.80 ERA 
A21 107 for the remainder of the big league season.<p/>
A21 108 <p_><quote_>"When I came up it was an unbelievably great 
A21 109 feeling,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"But it dies. And it becomes a 
A21 110 job.<p/>
A21 111 <p_>"I was talking to my father the other night and he said 'Gee, 
A21 112 you get to the park at 3 p.m. and you leave at midnight.' I said, 
A21 113 'Yeah, Dad, it's like an eight-hour job.'"<quote/><p/>
A21 114 <p_>But in June Fernandez was handed his first pink slip - a ticket 
A21 115 to Class AAA Vancouver.<p/>
A21 116 <p_><quote_>"I've learned a lot of things about the game as a 
A21 117 business,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"I'll leave it at that. But 
A21 118 there's no question you grow up and mature and learn how to deal 
A21 119 with things - with adversity, with success."<quote/><p/>
A21 120 <p_>Until this season, Fernandez considered adversity the likes of 
A21 121 the a losing 9-13 season in 1991. Even after struggling through a 
A21 122 3-7 first half of 1992 with 4.23 ERA, the demotion June 22 to Class 
A21 123 AAA was unexpected - and resented.<p/>
A21 124 <p_><quote_>"It was a total surprise,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"I 
A21 125 was shocked. And it's still something I say I didn't need to do, 
A21 126 something that was uncalled for.<p/>
A21 127 <p_>"But I'm not going to second guess their opinions because 
A21 128 that's why they're my bosses. As long as I'm here, I have to do 
A21 129 what they say.<p/>
A21 130 <p_>"So instead of making it worse, I did what I had to do to come 
A21 131 right back up."<quote/><p/>
A21 132 <p_>In some ways, Fernandez' three-week stay at Vancouver was an 
A21 133 exercise in both futility and success. He dominated with a 2-1 
A21 134 record and 0.94 ERA in four games. Yet he remains defiant that the 
A21 135 move was wrong.<p/>
A21 136 <p_>The two aren't necessarily counter-productive forces in the 
A21 137 opinions of his manger and pitching coach.<p/>
A21 138 <p_><quote_>"I know he was shocked,"<quote/> Gene Lamont said of 
A21 139 Fernandez' demotion. <quote_>"But I thought he took it all 
A21 140 right.<p/>
A21 141 <p_>"I'm sure when you get to the big leagues, you think you're 
A21 142 here forever. I think usually it's best when you get experience in 
A21 143 the minors, but it really all depends on how good you are and what 
A21 144 the needs of your team are. Alex showed he could pitch in the big 
A21 145 leagues.<p/>
A21 146 <p_>"But it's hard to learn at the big league level. He went down 
A21 147 and I think it helped him."<quote/><p/>
A21 148 <p_>If it reinforced Fernandez' fierce self-confidence, that, too, 
A21 149 could be a plus, pitching coach Jackie Brown believes.<p/>
A21 150 <p_><quote_>"You want that strong will, but it's tougher sometimes 
A21 151 because it does make it difficult in the learning stage. But I 
A21 152 think he's figuring out who he is.<p/>
A21 153 <p_>"Alex is still trying to figure out what kind of pitcher he is. 
A21 154 Is he a power pitcher or a finesse pitcher? I think his last game 
A21 155 [a 3-2 comeback victory Thursday over Texas in which he worked 
A21 156 eight innings and allowed two runs on four hits and a walk] is what 
A21 157 he is - a fastball pitcher who needs to use his other three 
A21 158 pitches."<quote/><p/>
A21 159 <p_>Fernandez is the first to agree that learning is part of the 
A21 160 game, but his best lessons have come from big league teammates and 
A21 161 coaches, he says, especially catcher Carlton Fisk and pitcher 
A21 162 Charlie Hough.<p/>
A21 163 <p_><quote_>"They've been in the big leagues for 20 years,"<quote/> 
A21 164 he said.<p/>
A21 165 <p_><quote_>"Some things they'll tell me I don't agree with, but 
A21 166 most I do. You take in what you want to take in and learn from 
A21 167 that.<p/>
A21 168 <p_>"Jackie Brown's been a big help to me, too,"<quote/> he said in 
A21 169 acknowledging another lesson learned in spring when for the first 
A21 170 time he was faced with playing for a new manager and coaching 
A21 171 staff.<p/>
A21 172 <p_><quote_>"The only manager I had known in my major league career 
A21 173 was Jeff [Torborg] and his staff, but in this profession you have 
A21 174 to get used to that. You never know who's going to be your coach 
A21 175 the next year."<quote/><p/>
A21 176 <p_>For coaches, Fernandez is his own challenge, a pitcher wealthy 
A21 177 in both potential and impatience.<p/>
A21 178 <p_><quote_>"He might be a little hard-headed, but all good 
A21 179 pitchers are that way,"<quote/> Lamont said. <quote_>"And I've 
A21 180 never heard Alex say 'I'm young' as an excuse if things don't go 
A21 181 well."<quote/><p/>
A21 182 <p_><quote_>"I like his attitude and I like young kids because I 
A21 183 like the part of coaching that is teaching,"<quote/> Brown said. 
A21 184 <quote_>"Alex has four average to above average pitches and all he 
A21 185 needs is to learn how to use them.<p/>
A21 186 <p_>"And any time you have someone with four average to above 
A21 187 average pitches, they have the chance to be dominating in the 
A21 188 game."<quote/><p/>
A21 189 <p_>In some ways Fernandez' potential might have been a hindrance 
A21 190 this season, one that began with many pointing to him as a key to 
A21 191 the Sox' hopes.<p/>
A21 192 <p_><quote_>"I heard that, but they singled out a lot of people, 
A21 193 not just me,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"It didn't make me feel all 
A21 194 the pressure was on me."<quote/><p/>
A21 195 <p_>Fernandez' focus always has been on his ability to succeed, 
A21 196 even when victories have eluded him.<p/>
A21 197 <p_><quote_>"He believes in himself,"<quote/> said catcher Ron 
A21 198 Karkovice, one of Fernandez' closer friends. <quote_>"The only 
A21 199 thing you have to tell him is to slow down. If someone gets a hit, 
A21 200 he'll tend to try to blow away the next hitter.<p/>
A21 201 <p_>"I didn't think he needed to go down. He was getting some bad 
A21 202 breaks and they were trying to get him to avoid big innings. But I 
A21 203 thought he was throwing well and now he hasn't given up the big 
A21 204 inning.<p/>
A21 205 <p_>"I think he could be a 15- to 20-game winner, and in years to 
A21 206 come he could be a dominating pitcher in the league."<quote/><p/>
A21 207 <p_>That so many years are yet to come fuels Fernandez' desire to 
A21 208 win.<p/>
A21 209 <p_><quote_>"Sometimes you say to yourself, 'You've bee in the big 
A21 210 leagues almost three years and you're only 23.' I'm young and glad 
A21 211 to be young because all that tells me is I'll have a lot more years 
A21 212 in the big leagues."<quote/><p/>

A21 215 <p_>Wacker Planning To Throw More<p/>
A21 216 <p_>By Terry Boers<p/>
A21 217 <p_>Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A21 218 <p_>On the cover of the Minnesota media guide, new coach Jim Wacker 
A21 219 is pictured leaning out the side window of an airplane with his 
A21 220 right fist raised.<p/>
A21 221 <p_>Does this mean the dawning of Air Wacker?<p/>
A21 222 <p_>After the Great Golden Gopher Offensive Crash of 1991, 
A21 223 Minnesota fans are hoping that Wacker can put the program back in 
A21 224 an upright position.<p/>
A21 225 <p_>As the befuddled regime of former coach John Gutekunst came to 
A21 226 an unsatisfactory (2-9) conclusion, it became clear that even if 
A21 227 the other team had left the field on third down, Minnesota would 
A21 228 have been forced to punt.<p/>
A21 229 <p_>In 11 games last season, the Gophers scored a grand total of 12 
A21 230 touchdowns and 104 points.<p/>
A21 231 <p_>And the defense wasn't all that hot, either.<p/>
A21 232 <p_>They were outscored by an average margin of 27.5-9.5 and were 
A21 233 outgained by more than 800 yards during the year.<p/>

A22   2 <p_>EXAMINER NEWS SERVICES<p/><h/>
A22   3 <p_>NEW YORK - Catholic leaders expressed shock at singer Sinead 
A22   4 O'Connor's having ripped a picture of Pope John Paul II to pieces 
A22   5 on 'Saturday Night Live.'<p/>
A22   6 <p_><quote_>"I have no idea why she would do that,"<quote/> said 
A22   7 Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for Cardinal John O'-Connor<&|>sic! of 
A22   8 New York. <quote_>"The pope is an advocate for peace. It sounds 
A22   9 like she is spreading hatred and intolerance."<quote/><p/>
A22  10 <p_>Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for Bishop Thomas Daily of Brooklyn, 
A22  11 said: <quote_>"It's a pity she embarrassed herself that way. I'm 
A22  12 sure the Holy Father would be the first to say a prayer for her so 
A22  13 that she could come to grips with whatever is angering 
A22  14 her."<quote/><p/>
A22  15 <p_>O'Connor shocked the 'Saturday Night Live' studio audience, the 
A22  16 show's producers and millions of viewers when she tore the picture 
A22  17 on live television.<p/>
A22  18 <p_><quote_>"Fight the real enemy,"<quote/> the smooth-scalped 
A22  19 Irish singer shouted as she held up the 8-by-12 photo of the 
A22  20 pontiff and methodically shredded it during her appearance toward 
A22  21 the show's end.<p/>
A22  22 <p_>From the show's conclusion through Monday, NBC received more 
A22  23 than 900 calls from people who didn't like the show - and seven who 
A22  24 did. That was among the highest number generated in the history of 
A22  25 the often-controversial 17-year-old show.<p/>
A22  26 <p_><quote_>"A lot of people were as offended as we were,"<quote/> 
A22  27 said NBC spokesman Curt Block, who was in the control room when 
A22  28 O'Connor pulled the surprise stunt.<p/>
A22  29 <p_>The Dublin-born singer, wearing a long white gown, tore up the 
A22  30 photo after performing 'War' - an a cappella song about racism, war 
A22  31 and child abuse.<p/>
A22  32 <p_>After the song, she blew out candles on the stage and walked 
A22  33 off; the studio audience was silent.<p/>
A22  34 <p_>Block said that during dress rehearsal, O'Connor performed the 
A22  35 song and ripped up a picture of an unidentified baby at its 
A22  36 conclusion.<p/>
A22  37 <p_>The segment was aired nation<?_>-<?/>wide, including on the 
A22  38 West Coast, where the show is tape delayed. <quote_>"There were 
A22  39 discussions after the show on what to do,"<quote/> Block said. 
A22  40 <quote_>"One of the thoughts was that in editing it out, it could 
A22  41 even draw more attention to it. In hindsight, seeing what the 
A22  42 reaction has been, we might have managed it 
A22  43 differently."<quote/><p/>
A22  44 <p_>Block said it was undecided whether O'Connor, 26, would ever be 
A22  45 invited back to the show. He added that she returned to her

A22  55 <h_><p_>The real Reagan, according to Lyn Nofziger<p/>
A22  56 <p_>Aide's memoirs not just presidential pap<p/>
A22  57 <p_>ASSOCIATED PRESS<p/><h/>
A22  58 <p_>SACRAMENTO - Lyn Nofziger is one of Ronald Reagan's oldest and 
A22  59 most loyal political confidants, but Nofziger's memoirs don't gloss 
A22  60 over the former president's weaknesses or failures.<p/>
A22  61 <p_><quote_>"It's not a book about how Ronald Reagan saved the 
A22  62 world,"<quote/> Nofziger says of his candid and entertaining book, 
A22  63 titled simply, 'Nofziger,' published last week by Regnery Gateway 
A22  64 Inc.<p/>
A22  65 <p_>Nofziger's admiration of Reagan, both as an individual and 
A22  66 political leader, is evident throughout his book, but it doesn't 
A22  67 blunt either his insight or humor.<p/>
A22  68 <p_><quote_>"Reagan has a great 'in' button, but his 'out' button 
A22  69 sometimes gets stuck on open,"<quote/> Nofziger writes, describing 
A22  70 Reagan's ability to quickly absorb and understand a great deal of 
A22  71 information and sometimes blurt out politically embarrassing jokes 
A22  72 or observations such as trees causing pollution.<p/>
A22  73 <p_>Nofziger, whose association with Reagan goes back to 1966, when 
A22  74 he was press secretary in the actor-turned-politician's campaign 
A22  75 for governor, also confirms that Reagan often embellished on true 
A22  76 stories to make a point or that he denied embarrassing gaffes.<p/>
A22  77 <p_>But Reagan did it honestly, Nofziger said, genuinely convincing 
A22  78 himself that he was telling the truth.<p/>
A22  79 <p_>For example, Nofziger wrote, Reagan <quote_>"got away with 
A22  80 denying that ... he ever said, 'A tree is a tree. How many do you 
A22  81 have to see?'<p/>
A22  82 <p_>"My secretary, Judith Kernoff, had it on tape, but that was 
A22  83 something we didn't tell him or anyone else, so he was free to do 
A22  84 one of the things he has always done best - convince himself that 
A22  85 the truth was what he wanted it to be,"<quote/> Nofziger writes.<p/>
A22  86 <p_>Nofziger also confirms in his memoirs that Reagan first 
A22  87 discussed running for president in a meeting at his Pacific 
A22  88 Palisades home with key advisers in December 1966, a month before 
A22  89 he became governor of California and 14 years before he finally was 
A22  90 elected to the White House.<p/>
A22  91 <p_>But, Nofziger says, it was political supporters like himself 
A22  92 who were pushing the idea of a presidential campaign in 1968. 
A22  93 Reagan took part in the discussion, but he was skeptical then and 
A22  94 still didn't have his heart in it when he formally launched his 
A22  95 first, short-lived, campaign for president two years later, 
A22  96 Nofziger says.<p/>
A22  97 <p_><quote_>"He was a very, very reluctant candidate in 
A22  98 1968,"<quote/> Nofziger says. <quote_>"He was doing basically what 
A22  99 (political advisers) Cliff White, Tom Reed and I pressured him into 
A22 100 doing. He seriously at that time thought it was wrong for him. He 
A22 101 didn't think he was ready for it."<quote/><p/>
A22 102 <p_>In general, Nofziger is critical of Reagan's top White House 
A22 103 staff, saying they limited Reagan's presidential news conferences 
A22 104 because they didn't have confidence in him.<p/>
A22 105 <p_>That was a mistake, Nofziger says, because more frequent news 
A22 106 conferences, such as he had as governor, <quote_>"would have forced 
A22 107 Reagan to stay on top of things better, and the media would have 
A22 108 discovered that he's not dumb."<quote/><p/>

A22 110 <h_><p_>A new atonement<p/>
A22 111 <p_>Contemporary Judaism accounts for modern sins during Yom 
A22 112 Kippur<p/>
A22 113 <p_>By Al Morch<p/>
A22 114 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A22 115 <p_>YOM KIPPUR, the most important Jewish holy day, begins at 
A22 116 sunset Tuesday in the new Hebrew year of 5753, and lasts until 
A22 117 sunset Wednesday. It is a day of atonement and fasting, during 
A22 118 which devout Jews think of their sins, repent and ask forgiveness 
A22 119 from God and others.<p/>
A22 120 <p_>(The idea of a collective confession stems from an ancient 
A22 121 belief that the gods became infuriated with a whole tribe when one 
A22 122 of its members transgressed. Hence, in those times collective 
A22 123 crops, live<?_>-<?/>stock and wells suffered the wrath of the 
A22 124 gods.)<p/>
A22 125 <p_><quote_>"But it goes beyond tribal feelings,"<quote/> says 
A22 126 Rabbi Mark Schiftan of Temple Emanu-el, a reform congregation 
A22 127 located at Arguello Boulevard and Lake Street.<p/>
A22 128 <p_><quote_>"None of us as Jews can ignore what's happening in the 
A22 129 entire American community. We are very concerned when we hear of 
A22 130 more people out of work, more students who cannot learn, more 
A22 131 people without adequate social service. Such bad news strikes a 
A22 132 strong note in the Jewish heart. Because of our unique past, 
A22 133 something in our very being resonates toward the powerless and the 
A22 134 oppressed,"<quote/> says Schiftan.<p/>
A22 135 <p_>Within the liberal tradition, he says, there is an attempt to 
A22 136 combine both the ancient admission of human frailty and 
A22 137 shortcomings along with the contemporary area of human neglect and 
A22 138 abuse.<p/>
A22 139 <p_>However, he believes, now that Jews have made a comfortable 
A22 140 place for themselves in American life, there is a need to return to 
A22 141 rituals that tie them in a very public fashion to their faith and 
A22 142 to their people.<p/>
A22 143 <p_><quote_>"There has been a return to more use of the Hebrew 
A22 144 language in services, and the prayer books we've used for the past 
A22 145 15 years are much more traditional than one used for 50 years 
A22 146 before that,"<quote/> he says.<p/>
A22 147 <p_>On the other hand, Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun, a 
A22 148 6-year-old liberal bimonthly Jewish magazine formerly based in 
A22 149 Oakland but now published in New York, says the liturgy of the 
A22 150 prayer book, while a balance of source material, is not inclusive 
A22 151 enough to cover instantaneous events that need response at the 
A22 152 time.<p/>
A22 153 <p_><quote_>"So I've written a supplement (appearing in the 
A22 154 September issue of Tikkun) to Al Cheyt, the traditional 
A22 155 confessional prayer recited on Yom Kippur,"<quote/> says Lerner. 
A22 156 Tikkun is a Hebrew word meaning 'to heal, to repair, to transform 
A22 157 the world.'<p/>
A22 158 <p_><quote_>"The idea is that you either use my supplement or 
A22 159 create your own, then discuss in small groups what particular 
A22 160 aspects make the most sense, what they are going to do differently 
A22 161 in the coming year, what support they need from others to help make 
A22 162 changes in their lives and what they are going to do to secure that 
A22 163 support."<quote/><p/>
A22 164 <p_>Lerner believes that contemporary society has such a 
A22 165 self-centered consciousness that <quote_>"it's time we had a 
A22 166 serious engagement with prayers not said by rote. In doing so I 
A22 167 think we can validate a lot of peoples' sense of what is important 
A22 168 and what is not, and allow for simple acts of caring and 
A22 169 kindness.<p/>
A22 170 <p_>"I take repentance seriously,"<quote/> Lerner says. 
A22 171 <quote_>"The contemporary mode is to dismiss all guilt as a bad 
A22 172 thing because guilt was used so much to impose rigid standards in a 
A22 173 patriarchal society. I've taken that into account, but want to show 
A22 174 there is still room for some guilt."<quote/><p/>
A22 175 <p_>Lerner's prayer asks for a multitude of forgiveness, at the 
A22 176 same time imprinting and reinforcing the listener/reader with what 
A22 177 should be done. He lists 54 sins. Among them, <quote_>"the sins of 
A22 178 feeling so worn out when we hear about oppression we finally close 
A22 179 our ears ... for the sins of even pretending that the (racist) 
A22 180 problem had gone away until others began to burn down cities in 
A22 181 their despair ... for the sins of turning our back on - or 
A22 182 participating in - the oppression of gays and lesbians ... for the 
A22 183 sins of making social change leaders, teachers and activists feel 
A22 184 they are foolish to be giving their lives to the community and 
A22 185 their highest ideals ...<p/>
A22 186 <p_>For the sins of not recognizing the humanity and suffering of 
A22 187 the Palestinian people and the injustice they face living under the 
A22 188 unwanted occupation ... for the sins of allowing conservative or 
A22 189 insensitive leaders to speak on behalf of all American Jews ... for 
A22 190 the sins of being critical of Jewish life from a distance rather 
A22 191 than from personal involvement and commitment ... for the sins of 
A22 192 being insensitive or insulting to non-Jews ... for the sins of 
A22 193 insisting that everything we do have a payoff ... for the sins of 
A22 194 not helping single people to meet potential partners."<quote/><p/>
A22 195 <p_>Rabbi Schiftan's personal atonement wish this year would be to 
A22 196 give more time to his family, and have more patience with his 
A22 197 children.<p/>
A22 198 <p_>Lerner declined to disclose his atonement wishes 
A22 199 (<quote_>"that's between me and God"<quote/>).<p/>

A22 201 <h_><p_>Husband OK'd her affair with millionaire<p/>
A22 202 <p_>Mistress says she was promised house<p/>
A22 203 <p_>By Linda Deutsch<p/>
A22 204 <p_>ASSOCIATED PRESS<p/><h/>
A22 205 <p_>LOS ANGELES - The ex<?_>-<?/>husband of one of Henry Mudd's 
A22 206 seven mistresses testified Monday that she had returned to the 
A22 207 millionaire industrialist after breaking off their relationship 
A22 208 because she missed his money.<p/>
A22 209 <p_>Vincent Oliver, whose former wife, Lorraine, is suing the 
A22 210 estate of the late founder of Harvey Mudd College for $5 million, 
A22 211 has said he knew of his wife's affair with Mudd and approved of 
A22 212 it.<p/>
A22 213 <p_>The case has sent details of Mudd's private life spilling forth 
A22 214 in elaborate detail. Witnesses have said the business high-flier 
A22 215 kept a different mistress for each day of the week and lavished 
A22 216 gifts and money on them.<p/>
A22 217 <p_>Eleanor Oliver is suing Mudd's estate for control of a $600,000 
A22 218 house in Los Angeles, among other things. She claims Mudd promised 
A22 219 she could have the house rent-free until she died. Oliver says Mudd 
A22 220 reneged on the contract after marrying one of his mistresses 
A22 221 shortly before his death in 1990 at age 77. Oliver was later 
A22 222 evicted.<p/>
A22 223 <p_>In his testimony Monday, Vincent Oliver said that after they 
A22 224 married in 1976, he and his wife had had <quote_>"an open 
A22 225 marriage"<quote/> in which both of them had extramarital lovers.<p/>
A22 226 <p_>Vincent Oliver said he had joined his wife in borrowing $10,000 
A22 227 from Mudd to start a business before she became Mudd's mistress in 
A22 228 1977. At least one witness has suggested that Eleanor Oliver began 
A22 229 having sex with Mudd to pay off the loan. She denies this.<p/>

A23   1 <#FROWN:A23\><h_><p_>He'll prosecute baby Kerri case<p/>
A23   2 <p_>Deputy district attorney says her parents got more help than 
A23   3 most do<p/>
A23   4 <p_>By Erin McCormick<p/>
A23   5 <p_>SPECIAL TO THE EXAMINER<p/><h/>
A23   6 <p_>OAKLAND - Most of the 2,000 or so children who have come into 
A23   7 Bob Hutchins' life over the last 12 years have had one thing in 
A23   8 common: They've been missing.<p/>
A23   9 <p_>As one of Alameda County's top experts in child abductions, the 
A23  10 deputy district attorney has handled 1,031 cases of children who 
A23  11 have been snatched from nurseries, abducted by estranged parents or 
A23  12 simply disappeared.<p/>
A23  13 <p_>Now, as Hutchins takes on the role of prosecutor in the high 
A23  14 profile kidnapping case of the 2-day<?_>-<?/>old baby Kerri 
A23  15 Mammini, he cannot forget that not all kidnapping victims are 
A23  16 nearly so lucky.<p/>
A23  17 <p_>While Kerri, who was kidnapped from her mother's hospital room 
A23  18 in June, was recovered after an exhaustive three-month police 
A23  19 investigation, Hutchins says many parents reporting stolen children 
A23  20 have trouble even getting help from police authorities, much less 
A23  21 recovering their children.<p/>
A23  22 <p_>These are the victims of the most common, yet most neglected, 
A23  23 type of kidnapping: parental abductions.<p/>
A23  24 <p_><quote_>"In the baby Kerri case, the public automatically sees 
A23  25 the horror of it,"<quote/> Hutchins said. <quote_>"But when 
A23  26 someone's child is taken by the other parent, everybody says, 'Oh, 
A23  27 it's just a parent.'<p/>
A23  28 <p_>"But any parent who has a child secreted away from them for 
A23  29 three or four years feels the same way baby Kerri's mother 
A23  30 did,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"I don't think there's much 
A23  31 difference."<quote/><p/>
A23  32 <p_>In upcoming court proceedings against Karen Lea Hughes, who was 
A23  33 arrested Sept. 15 for allegedly abducting baby Kerri from her 
A23  34 mother's hospital room, Hutchins will act as a traditional 
A23  35 prosecutor - digging up witnesses and presenting evidence to get a 
A23  36 conviction. The next court appearance for Hughes is Oct. 13 for 
A23  37 pretrial motions.<p/>
A23  38 <p_>In other cases, Hutchins has played a much wider role. The 
A23  39 deputy DA has become almost a one<?_>-<?/>stop resource center for 
A23  40 parents who feel they have nowhere to turn.<p/>
A23  41 <p_><quote_>"Historically these (parental abduction) cases were 
A23  42 just hated by police and law enforcement officers,"<quote/> he 
A23  43 said. Even now, <quote_>"the police often tell parents there is 
A23  44 nothing they can do."<quote/><p/>
A23  45 <p_>Georgia Hilgeman found out the hard way.<p/>
A23  46 <p_>In October 1976, the Santa Clara County mother let her 
A23  47 13-month-old daughter come to Alameda County for a weekend visit 
A23  48 with the baby's father, whom she had recently divorced.<p/>
A23  49 <p_>Before the weekend was over, the ex-husband, college instructor 
A23  50 Juan Rios, reported that the infant had mysteriously disappeared at 
A23  51 an event at Oakland's Civic Center.<p/>
A23  52 <p_>A massive police search of the area turned up nothing. Soon 
A23  53 Rios became the prime suspect.<p/>
A23  54 <p_>As soon as police authorities realized that the case was 
A23  55 probably a parental abduction, their interest waned, Hilgeman 
A23  56 said.<p/>
A23  57 <p_><quote_>"I was basically left to my own resources,"<quote/> she 
A23  58 said. <quote_>"I was ripped off numerous times by unscrupulous 
A23  59 bounty hunters, private eyes, psychics and whatnot."<quote/><p/>
A23  60 <p_>Hilgeman did not see her daughter until more than four years 
A23  61 later, when she went to Mexico with a posse of lawyers and found 
A23  62 the little girl living with the former husband's impoverished 
A23  63 relatives near Mexico City.<p/>
A23  64 <p_>With Hutchins acting as prosecutor, the district attorney's 
A23  65 office took Rios to trial on charges of child imprisonment. The 
A23  66 father received a three-year prison sentence.<p/>
A23  67 <p_><quote_>"You have to see how frustrated these people get, 
A23  68 calling all these agencies and not finding help,"<quote/> Hutchins 
A23  69 said.<p/>
A23  70 <p_>His goal is to make the criminal justice system available to 
A23  71 anyone who has had a child stolen, whether it was by a parent or 
A23  72 not.<p/>
A23  73 <p_>He has gone far beyond the prosecution duties of an everyday 
A23  74 district attorney. He has spearh<?_>-<?/>eaded investigations and 
A23  75 worked to train police on handling these matters.<p/>
A23  76 <p_><quote_>"I use the criminal system to force children out of the 
A23  77 wood<?_>-<?/>work,"<quote/> he said. This can mean issuing a 
A23  78 warrant against a parent abductor, extraditing them from another 
A23  79 state or even taking the children into custody.<p/>
A23  80 <p_>While more than 90 percent of his cases involve parent 
A23  81 abductions, Hutchins said he's had at least one that was markedly 
A23  82 similar to the baby Kerri case.<p/>
A23  83 <p_>About three years ago, he said a woman disguised herself in a 
A23  84 nurse's outfit and a wig and took a newborn baby from a room in 
A23  85 Oakland's Highland Hospital.<p/>
A23  86 <p_>The big difference in the case was that the abductor never got 
A23  87 out of the hospital. The baby's mother realized what was happening 
A23  88 and the woman was caught before she left the premises.<p/>
A23  89 <p_><quote_>"They arrested her on the spot,"<quote/> Hutchins said. 
A23  90 <quote_>"But otherwise, the case was very similar to baby Kerri. 
A23  91 That woman was prepared to keep that baby too."<quote/><p/>

A23  97 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A23  98 <p_>In a powerful display of unity, more than 700 women paid from 
A23  99 $20 to $50 to eat lunch Monday at 12 Bay Area restaurants owned or 
A23 100 operated by women, to show their support for Hillary Clinton and to 
A23 101 raise money for the California Democratic Party Nominees' Fund.<p/>
A23 102 <p_><quote_>"I believe in intelligent women who have careers and 
A23 103 can be family oriented, and I think the treatment of Hillary has 
A23 104 been unjust and unfair,"<quote/> said Joyce Goldstein, owner of 
A23 105 Square One restaurant, where one of the lunches was held. 
A23 106 <quote_>"I don't usually do politics in my business, but I thought 
A23 107 it was a wonderful idea and that I should support it."<quote/><p/>
A23 108 <p_>'Ladies Who Lunch' was the brainchild of writer Alice Adams, 
A23 109 arts administrator Diana Fuller, literary agent Bonnie Nadell, 
A23 110 activist Marjorie Traub, Oakland Tribune book editor Diana Ketcham 
A23 111 and former Dance Coalition director Suki Lilienthal, who wanted, as 
A23 112 Nadell puts it, to talk back to the <quote_>"spin doctors who tell 
A23 113 us women fear and dislike Hillary Clinton."<quote/><p/>
A23 114 <p_>Invitations were sent out by people such as writers Amy Tan and 
A23 115 Susan Faludi. Neither was at the lunch, but they lent their names 
A23 116 to the event.<p/>
A23 117 <p_>Guest speakers slated to appear at the restaurants included ACT 
A23 118 Artistic Director Carey Perloff; her mother, Marjorie Perloff, a 
A23 119 professor at Stanford; writers Kathy Acker and Deirdre English; 
A23 120 restaurateur Alice Waters; Project Open Hand founder Ruth Brinker, 
A23 121 city attorney Louise Renne; screen<?_>-<?/>writer Diane Johnson; 
A23 122 former Mayor Dianne Feinstein (who was unable to attend the event); 
A23 123 and Clinton campaign co-director for Northern California and 
A23 124 Professor at UC's Boalt Hall, Willy Fletcher.<p/>
A23 125 <p_>Before the speeches, guests were treated to an impersonation of 
A23 126 Hillary Clinton by local stage actress Lorri Holt, who, dressed to 
A23 127 look like Clinton - complete with red suit and headband - went from 
A23 128 location to location giving a rousing speech set in the year 
A23 129 1996.<p/>
A23 130 <p_><quote_>"Who would have thought that Bill Clinton would have 
A23 131 been as wonderful as to turn over his second term to me and become 
A23 132 my chief of staff?"<quote/> Holt asked the Cypress Club audience to 
A23 133 laughter. <quote_>"Let's go out and win this election because we 
A23 134 can't afford to put the leadership of this country into the hands 
A23 135 of Marilyn Quayle."<quote/><p/>
A23 136 <p_>At the Cypress Club, 40 women, most of them wearing their 'Bye! 
A23 137 George' and 'Blow Bill Blow' buttons (the latter feature Bill 
A23 138 Clinton playing his sax) gathered to hear the two Perloffs and 
A23 139 attorney David Robertson speak.<p/>
A23 140 <p_>The crowd was mostly over 40 with a couple of exceptions.<p/>
A23 141 <p_><quote_>"I used to raise money for Mr. Bush, but I really 
A23 142 disagree with his stand on abortion and the environment and those 
A23 143 are really important issues to me,"<quote/> said Barbara Ann 
A23 144 Caulfield, 26, an attorney with the San Francisco law firm of Hough 
A23 145 & Moss.<p/>
A23 146 <p_>Marjorie Perloff, author of the article in the Oct. 5 issue of 
A23 147 New Republic about how Barbara Bush's image as a super stay-at-home 
A23 148 mother is fabrication, said, <quote_>"Hillary is very accomplished. 
A23 149 She has a real political interest. We've had first lady after first 
A23 150 lady who <tf|>has to have a <tf|>project. And it's so demeaning. 
A23 151 Hillary doesn't need a project because she has projects. She will 
A23 152 prove that all women really can be equal to men and don't have to 
A23 153 be assigned projects like beautifying the White House or fighting 
A23 154 drugs."<quote/><p/>
A23 155 <p_>Daughter Carey agreed.<p/>
A23 156 <p_><quote_>"She's an extraordinarily important role model for 
A23 157 women. Hillary's life is much like the average woman's day-to-day 
A23 158 struggle, for those women in this country who have to work, and do 
A23 159 work, and who have a primary responsibility to their 
A23 160 family."<quote/><p/>
A23 161 <p_>Robertson, a partner at Morrison and Foerster, knew the 
A23 162 Clintons at Yale Law School and calls them <quote_>"extraordinarily 
A23 163 impressive and nice."<quote/><p/>
A23 164 <p_>Over at Square One, about 80 women, including Anne Halstead of 
A23 165 the Port Commission, gathered to hear Willy Fletcher and retired 
A23 166 investment banker and former Republican fund-raiser Martha Fray 
A23 167 speak.<p/>
A23 168 <p_>Fletcher, who was a Rhodes Scholar with Bill Clinton at Oxford 
A23 169 and was at Yale Law School with both the Clintons, said he believes

A23 171 untended.<p/>
A23 172 <p_><quote_>"Issues like choice,"<quote/> said Fletcher, 
A23 173 <quote_>"like the Family Leave bill that Bush just vetoed, the NIH 
A23 174 bill for ovarian and breast cancer research that he vetoed in the

A23 188 reporters<p/>
A23 189 <p_>By Louis Chunovic<p/>
A23 190 <p_>SPECIAL TO THE EXAMINER<p/><h/>
A23 191 <p_>LOS ANGELES - 'Tonight Show' host Jay Leno took it on his ample 
A23 192 chin repeatedly but without complaint Monday, answering show 
A23 193 business reporters' pointed questions about the 'Tonight'/'Arsenio' 
A23 194 booking wars and the recent summary dismissal of his longtime 
A23 195 manager Helen Kushnick from her post as 'Tonight's' executive 
A23 196 producer.<p/>
A23 197 <p_>The comedian did not duck responsibility for the show's recent 
A23 198 controversies, and he gave as good as he got, challenging reporters 
A23 199 to look into the existence and influence of the <quote_>"old boy 
A23 200 network"<quote/> of which Kushnick said she had run afoul.<p/>
A23 201 <p_>The occasion was the Academy of Television Arts & Science's 
A23 202 (ATAS) forum luncheon, and Leno was the guest speaker.<p/>
A23 203 <p_>After a brief monologue (<quote_>"It's every comedian's 
A23 204 dream,"<quote/> he quipped, <quote_>"to perform in front of 
A23 205 industry people who are eating"<quote/>), Leno took questions.<p/>
A23 206 <p_><quote_>"Am I bitter?"<quote/> he said of the controversies in 
A23 207 general. <quote_>"I'm in show business, which means you make a lot 
A23 208 of money."<quote/><p/>
A23 209 <p_>Leno added that he hates <quote_>"whiny show business people 
A23 210 that are bitter. I think the show is going great, but if for some 
A23 211 reason I was out of here, and I lost the show, 'Hey, I'm back on 
A23 212 the road again.' OK, it's my fault. Everything that happens on the 
A23 213 show is my fault. ... And that's the way it's going to be from now 
A23 214 on. I'm not blaming anyone else."<quote/><p/>
A23 215 <p_>To a question about Kushnick's treatment, Leno, who reportedly 
A23 216 stirred NBC's ire by publicly disagreeing with the decision to 
A23 217 dismiss her, replied: <quote_>"Yes, she's gotten a bad 
A23 218 rap."<quote/><p/>
A23 219 <p_>Of the 'Tonight'/'Arsenio' booking wars and the highly 
A23 220 publicized feud with Arsenio Hall, Leno said, <quote_>"I take full 
A23 221 responsibility for all those things. ... There were probably 
A23 222 excesses on both sides."<quote/><p/>
A23 223 <p_><quote_>"Arsenio's fine,"<quote/> Leno said before the 
A23 224 luncheon. <quote_>"I saw Arsenio the other night. Arsenio and I 
A23 225 speak once in a while. I called him about a month ago and we talked 
A23 226 and he made me laugh, and I made him laugh, and I think that it 
A23 227 reminded us, we used to be friends. As far as the situation now, I 
A23 228 think it's been mended. I saw him the other night at (a charity 
A23 229 event) and said, 'Look, if some things went down, it's changed. 
A23 230 Between you and me, no more of that stuff.' And that's it. I'll 
A23 231 probably talk to him in the next day or so."<quote/><p/>
A23 232 <p_>Of the Kushnick imbroglio, Leno said at another point, 
A23 233 <quote_>"I take total responsibility for everything that 
A23 234 happened."<quote/><p/>

A24   1 <#FROWN:A24\><h_><p_>Star-Studded Sex Scandals<p/>
A24   2 <p_>By BOB ROSS<p/>
A24   3 <p_>Tribune Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A24   4 <p_>TAMPA - Americans love sex scandals. We enjoy seeing the rich, 
A24   5 the famous and the powerful squirm and explain, charge and 
A24   6 countercharge.<p/>
A24   7 <p_>Let's face it: Nothing makes our own troubles seem so bearable 
A24   8 as the knowledge that someone in the stellar stratosphere has it 
A24   9 even worse. Besides, it gives us all something to talk about.<p/>
A24  10 <p_>The latest such gratifying eye-popper comes from Manhattan and, 
A24  11 indirectly, from 'Manhattan,' the 1979 movie in which 
A24  12 writer-director-star Woody Allen plays a 42-year-old man who falls 
A24  13 in love with a 17-year-old schoolgirl.<p/>
A24  14 <p_>That poignant fiction turned to tawdry tabloid fare with last 
A24  15 week's revelations and accusations about Allen and his longtime 
A24  16 companion/co-star Mia Farrow.<p/>
A24  17 <p_>Allen's infatuation with Farrow's 21-year-old adopted daughter 
A24  18 has led to a lurid chain of claims and denials. The whole story has 
A24  19 yet to unfold, and the interim is being filled with tales that may 
A24  20 or may not be true.<p/>
A24  21 <p_>The important part is not who slept where and when, but how 
A24  22 uncomfortably we can keep the spotlight on those involved.<p/>
A24  23 <p_>And although we can always count on politicians, athletes and 
A24  24 evangelists to contribute their share of moral outrages, we leave 
A24  25 it to the professionals - those whose livelihoods require acting 
A24  26 out fantasies - to distract us most often from the humdrum 
A24  27 melodramas of our own existence.<p/>
A24  28 <h_><p_>The 'Golden Age'<p/><h/>
A24  29 <p_>There have been movie-star sex scandals almost as long as there 
A24  30 have been movies.<p/>
A24  31 <p_>In the early silent era, movie actors were more or less 
A24  32 anonymous. The only 'scandals' that bluenoses could get huffy about 
A24  33 involved the film plots themselves.<p/>
A24  34 <p_>But by 1920, an ingenue named Mary Pickford had become a 
A24  35 certified star, recognized by millions.<p/>
A24  36 <p_>That was also the year she suffered her first scandal. Pickford 
A24  37 apparently divorced her first husband under such unusual 
A24  38 circumstances that the attorney general of Nevada began proceedings 
A24  39 against her for fraud, collusion and untruthful testimony.<p/>
A24  40 <p_>The divorce was upheld two years later - which was lucky for 
A24  41 the movie star, because she and Douglas Fairbanks had gotten 
A24  42 married right after she got her Nevada quickie. Both stars' 
A24  43 popularity survived.<p/>
A24  44 <h_><p_>The little tramp<p/><h/>
A24  45 <p_>Less lucky - and apparently more promiscuous - was silent 
A24  46 comedy genius Charlie Chaplin.<p/>
A24  47 <p_>Chaplin raised eyebrows with his marriage to 16-year-old actor 
A24  48 Mildred Harris in 1918 and his marriage to actor Lita Grey, also 
A24  49 16, in 1924. His bitter divorce from Grey three years later 
A24  50 produced sensational headlines and accusations of sexual 
A24  51 impropriety.<p/>
A24  52 <p_>But worse was to come for Chaplin in the early 1940s, when a 
A24  53 brief romance with an aspiring starlet, Joan Barry, resulted in 
A24  54 both a prosecution on a federal morals charge and a paternity 
A24  55 lawsuit.<p/>
A24  56 <p_>Chaplin was acquitted in the federal trial, but a different 
A24  57 jury ruled against him in the paternity case even though tests 
A24  58 showed he was not the father of Barry's daughter, born in October 
A24  59 1943. That same year, he married playwright Eugene O'Neill's 
A24  60 daughter Oona over O'Neill's strong objections. She was 18; he was 
A24  61 54.<p/>
A24  62 <p_>Because of the Barry scandal, Chaplin's left-leaning political 
A24  63 views and his decision not to become a U.S. citizen, the federal 
A24  64 government in 1952 revoked his entry permit while he was abroad, 
A24  65 saying he would have to submit to an inquiry on his fitness to be 
A24  66 in the country.<p/>
A24  67 <p_>He chose exile in Switzerland instead, and made only two films 
A24  68 after that before his death in 1977.<p/>
A24  69 <h_><p_>Fatty's follies<p/><h/>
A24  70 <p_>Screen buffoon Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle - the 266-pound 'Prince 
A24  71 of Whales' and $5,000-a-week Paramount comedy star - had one narrow 
A24  72 escape in 1917.<p/>
A24  73 <p_>On March 6, at a Boston roadhouse, someone peeped over a 
A24  74 transom, saw Arbuckle and a dozen hired 'party girls' stripping, 
A24  75 and called police. Kenneth Anger's 'Hollywood Babylon,' a reference 
A24  76 for scandal-lovers, says the magnates on the guest list paid city 
A24  77 officials $100,000 to keep it quiet.<p/>
A24  78 <p_>But Arbuckle's wild ways finally crashed his career. To 
A24  79 celebrate his new $3 million Paramount contract, Arbuckle threw a 
A24  80 party in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend, 1921.<p/>
A24  81 <p_>On Monday afternoon, Arbuckle withdrew to a bedroom with a 
A24  82 dark-haired starlet named Virginia Rappe. Before long, screams, 
A24  83 moans and pounding noises were heard. Arbuckle came out grinning, 
A24  84 but Rappe had to be taken to a hospital, where she sank into a coma 
A24  85 and died days later. She was 25.<p/>
A24  86 <p_>A coroner found that Rappe died of peritonitis caused by a 
A24  87 ruptured bladder. After a police investigation, Arbuckle was 
A24  88 charged with rape and murder.<p/>
A24  89 <p_>The charge was reduced to man<?_>-<?/>slaughter and after two 
A24  90 hung-jury mistrials, Arbuckle was acquitted in April 1922.<p/>
A24  91 <p_>But his career was over. His contract was canceled, his 
A24  92 unreleased films were scrapped and he never acted on screen again. 
A24  93 He died, broke and alcoholic, in 1933. He was 46.<p/>
A24  94 <h_><p_>Murder and madness<p/><h/>
A24  95 <p_>The '20s really roared in Hollywood. High-ranking studio 
A24  96 executive William Desmond Taylor was found murdered in his bungalow 
A24  97 on Feb. 1, 1922.<p/>
A24  98 <p_>Before police were summoned, silent star Mabel Normand searched 
A24  99 the place for letters she had written to him. She didn't find them, 
A24 100 but the cops did. They also found love notes from a young Paramount 
A24 101 star named Mary Miles Minter, age 22. Taylor was 50.<p/>
A24 102 <p_>Later it came out that he had been carrying on simultaneous 
A24 103 affairs with Normand, Minter and Charlotte Shelby - Mary Minter's 
A24 104 mother. The murder remains officially unsolved.<p/>
A24 105 <p_>Seventy years later, another mother-daughter mix-up hits the 
A24 106 headlines, and we gasp as if it were a scandalous first.<p/>
A24 107 <p_>Other movie scandals of the '20s included the hush-hush liaison 
A24 108 between multimillionaire William Randolph Hearst and would-be star 
A24 109 Marion Davies. That one stayed out of the papers because Hearst 
A24 110 owned so many of them.<p/>
A24 111 <p_>Now, our most familiar version of that romance is the heavily 
A24 112 fictionalized one in Orson Welles' classic, 'Citizen Kane.'<p/>
A24 113 <p_>Handsome leading man Rudolph Valentino, who died tragically 
A24 114 young in 1926, was married twice in his 31-year life - both times 
A24 115 to lesbians. And he managed to marry the second one before his 
A24 116 first divorce was final, leading to an arrest for bigamy.<p/>
A24 117 <p_>But his popularity remained undiminished by his death, which 
A24 118 was officially listed as caused by peritonitis following an 
A24 119 appendix operation. His funeral was a near riot, and at least three 
A24 120 suicides by distraught fans were reported. Two of them were 
A24 121 women.<p/>
A24 122 <h_><p_>In like Flynn<p/><h/>
A24 123 <p_>In 1942, swashbuckling movie star Errol Flynn was brought up on 
A24 124 charges of statutory rape in an incident involving two underage 
A24 125 teenage girls. His acquittal was followed shortly thereafter by the 
A24 126 release of 'Gentleman Jim,' a hit with the critics and the crowds. 
A24 127 His career continued undiminished.<p/>
A24 128 <p_>In 1948, Carole Landis killed herself after the breakup of an 
A24 129 affair with Rex Harrison. As a result, 20th Century Fox delayed 
A24 130 release of Preston Sturges' comedy 'Unfaithfully Yours' for several 
A24 131 months. The film is about an orchestra conductor, played by 
A24 132 Harrison, who suspects his wife of adultery.<p/>
A24 133 <p_>Ingrid Bergman, the gorgeous star of 'Casablanca' and 'The 
A24 134 Bells of St. Mary's,' ran afoul of moralists in 1950 when she bore 
A24 135 a son to Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini while she was still 
A24 136 married to her first husband. Her popularity plummeted, and she 
A24 137 didn't return to Hollywood until 1956, when she won an Oscar for 
A24 138 'Anastasia.'<p/>
A24 139 <p_>In 1977, director Roman Polanski fled the United States after 
A24 140 he was charged with drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl in a hot 
A24 141 tub at Jack Nicholson's home.<p/>
A24 142 <p_>Prior to his arraignment, Polanski was about to start work on 
A24 143 'The First Deadly Sin,' a film for Columbia Pictures. After the 
A24 144 hearing, he had a change of heart and went to work on a film 
A24 145 shooting in Tahiti and never returned to face trial.<p/>
A24 146 <p_>Polanski now lives in Paris, where he continues making 
A24 147 movies.<p/>
A24 148 <h_><p_>Playboy centerfold<p/><h/>
A24 149 <p_>Director Peter Bogdanovich's 'They All Laughed' also had a dark 
A24 150 aura about it: One of the principals in the comedy, made in 1980 
A24 151 but not released until late the next year, was Playboy centerfold 
A24 152 Dorothy Stratten - a 20-year-old former Dairy Queen employee from 
A24 153 Vancouver with whom Bogdanovich had a nine-month affair.<p/>
A24 154 <p_>The aspiring star was sodomized and murdered by her estranged 
A24 155 husband (who then killed himself) shortly after she finished work 
A24 156 on 'Laughed.'<p/>
A24 157 <p_>Bogdanovich, more than 20 years her senior, was hopelessly in 
A24 158 love with Stratten and wrote a highly personal account of the 
A24 159 tragic affair, 'The Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten 
A24 160 1960-1980.'<p/>
A24 161 <p_>In 1989, Bogdanovich, then 49, married Stratten's younger 
A24 162 sister, Louise Hoogstratten, who was 20.<p/>
A24 163 <p_>Will the Allen-Farrow scandal hurt their respective (and now, 
A24 164 presumably, quite separate) careers?<p/>
A24 165 <p_>We should get a clue soon. Allen's latest movie, portentously 
A24 166 titled 'Husbands and Wives,' is scheduled to open in eight cities 
A24 167 on Sept. 23 and in the rest of the country, including the Tampa Bay 
A24 168 area, on Oct. 9.<p/>
A24 169 <p_>The picture, described in studio publicity materials as 
A24 170 <quote_>"an insightful comedy exploring contemporary 
A24 171 relationships,"<quote/> is about two couples who face change and 
A24 172 have to re<?_>-<?/>evaluate <quote_>"trust and love."<quote/><p/>
A24 173 <p_>And last week, New York gossip columnist Liz Smith reported 
A24 174 that Allen is already at work on his next project: 'Manhattan 
A24 175 Murder Mystery,' in which he has reportedly cast Diane Keaton in 
A24 176 the role he'd originally intended for Farrow. Keaton, of course, 
A24 177 was his paramour before he met Mia.<p/>

A24 179 <h_><p_>Music may rock 'n' roll young voters to the polls<p/>
A24 180 <p_>By STEVE KNOPPER<p/>
A24 181 <p_>of Knight-Ridder Newspapers<p/><h/>
A24 182 <p_>Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton plays Fleetwood 
A24 183 Mac songs after his speeches. George Bush invokes the 
A24 184 <quote_>"Nitty Ditty Great Bird"<quote/> - most likely referring to 
A24 185 a Colorado-based country group, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, but 
A24 186 it's hard to say - in his stump speeches. Who's next for Bush? 
A24 187 Garth Brooks?<p/>
A24 188 <p_>Pop music has emerged as a strange political sideshow this 
A24 189 election year. Consider these issues:<p/>
A24 190 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Rock 'n' roll may, in fact, get more young 
A24 191 people to vote.<p/>
A24 192 <p_>Away from the stage at the traveling Lollapalooza festival - 
A24 193 which features seven youth-oriented rock 'n' roll bands - fans can 
A24 194 try their skills at <quote_>"Wake Up George Bush - $1 a 
A24 195 swing"<quote/> strength tests. Like last year's show, mostly 
A24 196 liberal political groups such as Refuse and Resist and People for 
A24 197 the Ethical Treatment of Animals set up camp during the tour, which 
A24 198 stopped in Orlando Sunday.<p/>
A24 199 <p_>Then there's MTV, which sent correspondent Dave Mustaine, the 
A24 200 slightly twisted, long-haired member of heavy-metal stalwarts 
A24 201 Megadeth, to cover the Democratic National Convention. He stumbled 
A24 202 through an interview with one-time presidential candidate Bob 
A24 203 Kerrey and later asked a young conventioneer, <quote_>"How does a 
A24 204 guy with long hair and an earring through his nose get to be a 
A24 205 delegate?"<quote/> MTV's 'Choose or Lose' coverage, with its 
A24 206 emphasis on young voters, ought to encourage the Video Generation 
A24 207 to hit the ballots.<p/>
A24 208 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Some rap music has become a political 
A24 209 issue.<p/>
A24 210 <p_>Because non-rap fans are actually beginning to pay attention, 
A24 211 some rap musicians and their feisty lyrics have become sort of a 
A24 212 political sound bite. Ice-T's speed-metal song 'Cop Killer' (which 
A24 213 he unveiled during Lollapalooza last year) has won scorn from 
A24 214 police lobbying groups, Charlton Heston, Bush and Dan Quayle.<p/>
A24 215 <p_>Sister Souljah, a some-time member of the rap group Public 
A24 216 Enemy, got a verbal hand-slap from Clinton after she'd proposed a 
A24 217 week of killing white people. Both rappers' publicity and album 
A24 218 sales sky<?_>-<?/>rocketed.<p/>
A24 219 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Rock bands have been rebelling against the 
A24 220 Democratic vice presidential candidate's wife for seven years.<p/>
A24 221 <p_>When Tipper Gore, wife of Sen. Al Gore Jr., pushed for 
A24 222 'Parental Advisory - Explicit Lyrics' stickers on nasty-talking pop 
A24 223 albums, she sparked a tizzy in the rock world. At the time, Frank 
A24 224 Zappa called her campaign <quote_>"fundamentalist 
A24 225 frog<?_>-<?/>wash."<quote/> Musicians from John Denver to Randy 
A24 226 Newman to John Fogerty ripped Gore in print.<p/>
A24 227 <p_>Though Gore has said she's currently satisfied with the 
A24 228 industry's self-sticker methods, high-profile executives like Giant 
A24 229 Records' Irving Azoff have expressed reservations in print. Still, 
A24 230 Clinton probably realizes most rock fans are liberal and likely 
A24 231 won't take this as an excuse to jump to Bush's camp. For that 
A24 232 matter, maybe her presence will give rock 'n' roll something 
A24 233 concrete to attack.<p/>

A25   3 <p_>Irate board reacts to reports of abuse by top-level staff<p/>
A25   4 <p_>By Jane Ganahl<p/>
A25   5 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A25   6 <p_>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors, irate over the 
A25   7 discovery that department heads were driving <quote_>"fully loaded, 
A25   8 top of the line luxury cars at taxpayer expense,"<quote/> 
A25   9 unanimously passed legislation Monday to restrict officials' future 
A25  10 use and purchase of city-owned cars.<p/>
A25  11 <p_><quote_>"Enough is enough,"<quote/> said Supervisor Terence 
A25  12 Hallinan, who drafted the three-piece package of legislation. 
A25  13 <quote_>"This has been a clear violation of the law and the public 
A25  14 trust."<quote/><p/>
A25  15 <p_>Hallinan introduced the legislation following an Examiner story 
A25  16 that revealed that some city bureaucrats were commuting in style at 
A25  17 taxpayer expense despite a severe budget crunch that has required 
A25  18 reduction of some vital health services. Many city officials, it 
A25  19 was reported, take city seals off their new cars when they commute, 
A25  20 in violation of the law.<p/>
A25  21 <p_><quote_>"I had been looking at the situation for several 
A25  22 months, but the Examiner article turned up the heat,"<quote/> said 
A25  23 Hallinan.<p/>
A25  24 <p_>The City maintains a fleet of more than 400 cars for department 
A25  25 heads and managers at an annual cost of about $1.5 million, some of 
A25  26 which Hallinan hopes to recoup by implementing his three-pronged 
A25  27 legislation. The package calls for:<p/>
A25  28 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/>Urging Mayor Jordan to instruct city 
A25  29 departments to reduce the use and purchase of city cars.<p/>
A25  30 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/>Ending purchases of luxury automobiles 
A25  31 and ensuring that all cars purchased are economical and affordable, 
A25  32 without luxury features such as leather seats and sunroofs. The 
A25  33 ordinance also lobbies for employees to use public transportation, 
A25  34 or use their own cars and receive mileage reimbursement.<p/>
A25  35 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/>Proposing to penalize city employees who 
A25  36 have driven their city-owned cars to and from their residences. 
A25  37 They would be required to pay back The City at three times the 
A25  38 normal mileage reimbursement rate. The amount would be docked from 
A25  39 their pay.<p/>
A25  40 <p_>Among those singled out in The Examiner for their extravagant 
A25  41 tastes were Muni General Manager Johnny Stein, who traded in his 
A25  42 2-year-old Ford Crown Victoria with less than 20,000 miles for a 
A25  43 new model at a cost of $14,000 to The City.<p/>
A25  44 <p_>Stein, feeling the heat, has decided to sell the new car and 
A25  45 will get by with his old 1990 model.<p/>
A25  46 <p_>Others who were noted by Hallinan were Ken Butori, a Muni 
A25  47 official who drives his top-of-the-line $16,000 GMC Silverado home 
A25  48 to Concord each night; Housing Authority Director David Gilmore, 
A25  49 who got a loaded 1992 Explorer, at a cost of $16,000 to The City; 
A25  50 and Kirk Lawson, chief assistant to PUC General Manager Tom Elzey, 
A25  51 who got a new Ford Taurus, one of 41 such cars being delivered to 
A25  52 the PUC and Muni.<p/>
A25  53 <p_><quote_>"I mean, we depend on department heads to keep their 
A25  54 employees honest, and then we find out they are being less than 
A25  55 honest themselves,"<quote/> said Hallinan. <quote_>"Something's got 
A25  56 to be done."<quote/><p/>
A25  57 <p_>Hallinan has asked for a report in 30 days from the mayor's 
A25  58 office on how Jordan plans to deal with the problem, from the city 
A25  59 purchaser on procurement policies for cars and from the chief 
A25  60 administrator's office on how the fining process can be 
A25  61 implemented.<p/>
A25  62 <p_>Jordan has already sent out a memo canvassing department heads 
A25  63 on automobile use. In it, he asks officials to list how many

A25  65 for what purpose.<p/>

A25  67 <h_><p_>Korean church's sale authorized<p/>
A25  68 <p_>Congregation OKs resolutions to put site on market<p/>
A25  69 <p_>By Donna Birch<p/>
A25  70 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A25  71 <p_>Chinatown's Korean Methodist Church - the oldest in the 
A25  72 continental United States - is one step closer to being put up for 
A25  73 sale.<p/>
A25  74 <p_>Church members approved two resolutions Sunday that would put 
A25  75 the church's current 1123 Powell St. site up for sale and allow a 
A25  76 committee to look into purchasing a larger site in the Sunset 
A25  77 District.<p/>
A25  78 <p_><quote_>"We hadn't put the church on the market because a 
A25  79 resolution hadn't been passed by the congregation,"<quote/> said 
A25  80 the Rev. Suk-Chong Yu, the church's minister.<p/>
A25  81 <p_>Sunday's votes were the latest actions in a bitter battle 
A25  82 between members who want to sell the Powell Street property and 
A25  83 those who want to preserve it as a historical legacy.<p/>
A25  84 <p_>Yu and the church's new building committee want to sell the 
A25  85 Chinatown site and buy the Christian Science Church at 3030 Judah 
A25  86 St. Yu said the congregation had out<?_>-<?/>grown the Powell 
A25  87 Street building and needed a bigger building.<p/>
A25  88 <p_><quote_>"We value the history of our church, and we want to 
A25  89 keep it wherever we are,"<quote/> Yu said, <quote_>"but we also 
A25  90 want to make a new legacy for future Korean generations. That's the 
A25  91 rationale for the relocation."<quote/><p/>
A25  92 <p_>But Steve Hong, longtime member of the Korean Methodist Church 
A25  93 and leader of the effort to preserve the church as a historical 
A25  94 site, called the proposal to sell the building short-sighted.<p/>
A25  95 <p_><quote_>"They're acting like politicians,"<quote/> Hong said. 
A25  96 <quote_>"They think there is no historical value in the church. 
A25  97 They are obligated to preserve the church's history, but they 
A25  98 haven't even tried."<quote/><p/>
A25  99 <p_>Officials in the United Methodist Church California-Nevada 
A25 100 conference voted to approve the church's sale last month. Hong 
A25 101 blasted their decision.<p/>
A25 102 <p_><quote_>"They don't know the background of our Korean 
A25 103 history,"<quote/> Hong said. <quote_>"They don't know the 
A25 104 traditions; they're not qualified to judge."<quote/><p/>
A25 105 <p_>The white stucco, Spanish tile<?_>-<?/>roof building on Powell 
A25 106 Street is venerated by Koreans as the <quote_>"mother 
A25 107 church"<quote/> in America and home of the Korean independence 
A25 108 movement early in this century.<p/>
A25 109 <p_>The preservationist group petitioned City Planning Sept. 11 to 
A25 110 have the church declared a historical landmark. A hearing date 
A25 111 before the department's Landmarks Board has not been set.<p/>
A25 112 <p_>Meanwhile, Yu said that anyone wanting to buy the church should 
A25 113 <quote_>"make an offer and come to the negotiating 
A25 114 table."<quote/><p/>
A25 115 <p_>Hong said he and other activists had tried to do just that, but 
A25 116 that Yu and the new building committee had refused to confer with 
A25 117 the group. He said they hadn't had the property appraised yet, but 
A25 118 were asking varying prices that ranged from $1.5 million to $2.5 
A25 119 million.<p/>
A25 120 <p_>He said the Korean Center Inc., a multiservice agency on Post 
A25 121 Street, wanted to buy the building and had recently held a 
A25 122 fund-raiser, hoping to be able to offer the church's trustees 
A25 123 $10,000 as a deposit.<p/>
A25 124 <p_>Yu disputed Hong, saying he welcomed offers from groups trying 
A25 125 to preserve the church. <quote_>"Now they can come to us with a 
A25 126 plan to buy it,"<quote/> Yu said. <quote_>"I don't know why they 
A25 127 haven't waited patiently."<quote/><p/>

A25 129 <h_><p_>State to hire 27 more workers' comp probers<p/>
A25 130 <p_>New law makes possible more fraud investigations<p/>
A25 131 <p_>By Steven A. Capps<p/>
A25 132 <p_>EXAMINER SACRAMENTO BUREAU<p/><h/>
A25 133 <p_>SACRAMENTO - State insurance czar John Garamendi says he now 
A25 134 will be able to hire 27 additional investigators to look into 
A25 135 workers' compensation insurance fraud, a crime he believes is 
A25 136 costing the state more than $1 billion a year.<p/>
A25 137 <p_>Garamendi's announcement Monday came as the Legislature 
A25 138 prepared to convene a special session on California's troubled 
A25 139 workers' compensation system. California employers pay among the 
A25 140 highest rates in the nation, yet injured California workers collect 
A25 141 some of the lowest benefits.<p/>
A25 142 <p_>Out of every dollar spent on workers' compensation insurance, 
A25 143 doctors and lawyers get 42.3 cents, insurance companies get 28.2 
A25 144 cents, and injured workers get only 29.5 cents, according to the 
A25 145 Association of California Insurance Companies.<p/>
A25 146 <p_>Republican Gov. Wilson called the special session for Thursday, 
A25 147 less than a month before the Nov. 6 election in which all 80 
A25 148 Assembly seats and half of the Senate's 40 seats are on the ballot. 
A25 149 Wilson said he hoped election-year pressure would lead to enactment 
A25 150 of his proposals.<p/>
A25 151 <p_>Democratic legislative leaders have said they expect that the 
A25 152 session will last only a day or two, and that the issue will then 
A25 153 be assigned to further study by committees. Wilson said last week 
A25 154 that if the legislators did not act quickly, he might summon them 
A25 155 back into a second special session.<p/>
A25 156 <p_>But Garamendi said Monday he already had some of what he needs 
A25 157 to curb fraud in the system. Wilson signed a bill - AB3660 by 
A25 158 Assemblyman Burt Margolin, D-Los Angeles - authorizing $7 million 
A25 159 for investigation and prosecution of workers' compensation 
A25 160 insurance fraud.<p/>
A25 161 <p_>About half of the money will go to local district attorneys for 
A25 162 prosecution of such cases, while the other half will be used by 
A25 163 Garamendi's Department of Insurance for investigations.<p/>
A25 164 <p_>Garamendi said the money would allow him to hire 27 new 
A25 165 investigators - tripling the number he now has assigned to workers' 
A25 166 compensation insurance fraud cases - and predicted it would 
A25 167 eventually <quote_>"put hundreds of scam artists behind bars and 
A25 168 save tens of millions of dollars in premiums."<quote/><p/>
A25 169 <p_>Garamendi contended that his department's anti-fraud efforts 
A25 170 resulted in $7 in savings for every $1 spent. He said last year his 
A25 171 department's investigators had arrested 247 suspects in conjunction 
A25 172 with $53.4 million in fraudulent insurance claims of all types. He 
A25 173 estimated that the department would investigate 15,000 cases of 
A25 174 suspected workers' compensation insurance fraud alone this year.<p/>
A25 175 <p_>Last week, Wilson said he hoped the pressure of the upcoming 
A25 176 election year would force law<?_>-<?/>makers to act on his reforms. 
A25 177 The issue of workers' compensation pits some of the state's most 
A25 178 powerful special interests - doctors, lawyers, insurance companies 
A25 179 and businesses - against one another.<p/>
A25 180 <p_><quote_>"Do I apologize for using this election to pressure for 
A25 181 change?"<quote/> Wilson said. <quote_>"Absolutely not."<quote/><p/>
A25 182 <p_>Wilson's plan would require that workers prove their injuries 
A25 183 were caused predominantly by work<?_>-<?/>place conditions before 
A25 184 they would be entitled to workers' compensation benefits. It also 
A25 185 would limit the number of medical evaluations workers could receive 
A25 186 and would encourage use of health maintenance organizations to 
A25 187 treat injured workers.<p/>
A25 188 <p_>If lawmakers agree to his reform measures, Wilson said, he is 
A25 189 willing to repeal the controversial 'minimum rate' state law that 
A25 190 guarantees insurance companies 32.8 per<?_>-<?/>cent profit on 
A25 191 their workers' compensation business.<p/>
A25 192 <p_>While many view Wilson's proposals as similar to ones adopted 
A25 193 by the Legislature - and vetoed by the governor - there is at least 
A25 194 one significant difference. Wilson's proposal would not increase 
A25 195 benefits paid to injured workers until businesses have saved at 
A25 196 least $1 billion of the $10.5 billion in workers' compensation 
A25 197 insurance premiums they now pay annually.<p/>

A25 203 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A25 204 <p_>Local investors have apparently tentatively agreed on a bid for 
A25 205 the San Francisco Giants, but details of the offer were not 
A25 206 immediately made public.<p/>
A25 207 <p_><quote_>"We're making progress, we're moving forward, and we 
A25 208 will make an offer within the next few days,"<quote/> downtown real 
A25 209 estate developer Walter Shorenstein said Monday after a meeting 
A25 210 between local investors and North Carolina sports promoter George 
A25 211 Shinn ended at 6:30 p.m. Shorenstein, who is leading the effort, 
A25 212 declined further comment.<p/>
A25 213 <p_>However, a source close to the negotiations said investors had 
A25 214 reached an accord to present to Major League Baseball by week's 
A25 215 end.<p/>
A25 216 <p_><quote_>"It will be competitive,"<quote/> said the source, in 
A25 217 reference to a purchase offer of from $105 million to $115 million 
A25 218 by Florida investors who want to move the team to the Tampa Bay 
A25 219 area.<p/>
A25 220 <p_>Sources had predicted earlier the local bid would be from $90 
A25 221 million to $95 million, or possibly more if they offered Giants 
A25 222 owner Bob Lurie a share of the franchise.<p/>
A25 223 <p_>Although no firm deadline has been set, league officials have 
A25 224 indicated they want an offer by the end of the week.<p/>
A25 225 <p_>Monday's meeting was the first time in several weeks that most 
A25 226 of the key participants had gotten together in one room to try to 
A25 227 hash out an agreement to keep the Giants in San Francisco.<p/>
A25 228 <p_>It capped a day of intense lobbying by Mayor Jordan, who has 
A25 229 been working to keep everyone at the table since he returned late 
A25 230 Saturday from his week-long honeymoon in Hawaii.<p/>
A25 231 <p_>Larry Baer, a CBS executive who has been helping to negotiate 
A25 232 the deal, said the participants had reached a general consensus 
A25 233 where we should be.<p/>
A25 234 <p_><quote_>"Everyone is moving towards an offer at the end of the 
A25 235 week,"<quote/> Baer said. <quote_>"We're moving forward with the 
A25 236 league and its guidelines."<quote/><p/>
A25 237 <p_>However, no formal meetings were planned for Tuesday, and 
A25 238 Shinn, the expected lead investor and general partner, flew home 
A25 239 late Monday without comment.<p/>

A26   1 <#FROWN:A26\><h_><p_>Pioneer statue faces monumental decision<p/>
A26   2 <p_>Official quandary over pointing it toward City Hall<p/>
A26   3 <p_>By Gerald D. Adams<p/>
A26   4 <p_>EXAMINER URBAN PLANNING WRITER<p/><h/>
A26   5 <p_>Most details of a controversial proposal to move the 
A26   6 47-foot-high Pioneer Monument from where it has rested for almost a 
A26   7 century to another Civic Center spot were approved unanimously 
A26   8 Monday by the Arts Commission.<p/>
A26   9 <p_>The City's art mavens, however, could not decide which way the 
A26  10 wedding cake-like pillar of bronze and cement should face - toward 
A26  11 City Hall or Market Street. The monument has been on the corner of 
A26  12 Hyde and Grove streets since 1894.<p/>
A26  13 <p_>Commissioners hesitated to commit themselves after one of the 
A26  14 monument's chief admirers raised objections to the Western 
A26  15 orientation.<p/>
A26  16 <p_>Noted preservationist Winchell Hayward pointed out that, 
A26  17 historically, the spear-carrying female bronze figure representing 
A26  18 California has gazed from the pre-1906 City Hall southward toward 
A26  19 Market Street.<p/>
A26  20 <p_>Now, plans by the Bureau of Architecture would turn it 180 
A26  21 degrees to face the existing City Hall, he complained.<p/>
A26  22 <p_>Commissioners agreed to withhold a final decision on direction 
A26  23 pending a study by their Civic Design Committee.<p/>
A26  24 <p_>As a result of Monday's vote, the 850-ton monument is slated to 
A26  25 be moved sometime in spring 1993, according to City Architect Russ 
A26  26 Abel. The cost to move the monument, estimated at $750,000, would 
A26  27 be paid by the Department of Public Works, he said.<p/>
A26  28 <p_>The Pioneer Monument's final resting place would be in the 
A26  29 middle of Fulton Street, halfway between Hyde and Larkin streets 
A26  30 and midway between the new and old library buildings. In the 
A26  31 meantime, Abel said, the representation of California and the 
A26  32 pioneers who huddle at her feet will be temporarily moored at the 
A26  33 east end of Fulton Street for about two years, pending completion 
A26  34 of the new library building.<p/>
A26  35 <p_>For the past two years, the notion of moving the Pioneer 
A26  36 Monument at all was so controversial that it threatened to torpedo 
A26  37 plans for the new $105 million Main Library, slated for the area on 
A26  38 which the statue currently stands. That issue was resolved in April 
A26  39 when the Arts Commission agreed that it should be shifted to make 
A26  40 way for the oncoming structure.<p/>

A26  43 <p_>Crews seek bodies, stabilize building in Amsterdam cut in two 
A26  44 by big jet<p/>
A26  45 <p_>By Robert J. Wielaard<p/>
A26  46 <p_>ASSOCIATED PRESS<p/><h/>
A26  47 <p_>AMSTERDAM - Search crews started a full-scale hunt for bodies 
A26  48 Tuesday after stabilizing a 11-story apartment building that was 
A26  49 sliced in two by an Israeli jumbo jet.<p/>
A26  50 <p_>Officials feared the death toll from the Sunday evening crash 
A26  51 of an El Al cargo plane could exceed 250, most of them residents of 
A26  52 the low-income housing project. That would make it the worst plane 
A26  53 crash in terms of casualties on the ground.<p/>
A26  54 <p_>By Tuesday morning, only 12 bodies had been recovered from the 
A26  55 mountain of rubble.<p/>
A26  56 <p_>Workers had been digging by hand because of fears the building 
A26  57 might collapse. Cranes were used to pull down tottering slabs of 
A26  58 concrete and other rubble, and experts said the danger of collapse 
A26  59 has now been reduced.<p/>
A26  60 <p_>Authorities also were looking for the Boeing 747's flight data 
A26  61 recorder (the 'black box'), which could explain why two engines 
A26  62 fell from the plane after it took off from Schiphol Airport. It 
A26  63 crashed as the pilot tried vainly to return for a landing.<p/>
A26  64 <p_>Late Monday, Seattle-based Boeing issued a service bulletin 
A26  65 asking all airlines to inspect fuse pins that help connect engines 
A26  66 to the wings of 747-200s, -100s and -300s.<p/>
A26  67 <p_>The pins are designed to break off and allow an engine to fall 
A26  68 if the engine malfunctions.<p/>
A26  69 <p_>Boeing cited similarities between Sunday's crash and one last 
A26  70 December in which a China Air 747-200 freighter dropped two engines 
A26  71 from its right wing shortly after takeoff in Taipei. The crash 
A26  72 killed five crew.<p/>
A26  73 <p_><quote_>"We have not found any evidence linking these fuse pins 
A26  74 to either accident,"<quote/> said Boeing spokesman Christopher 
A26  75 Villiers. <quote_>"This is just a precaution at this 
A26  76 point."<quote/><p/>
A26  77 <p_>Search teams filled stretchers with bits of charred human 
A26  78 remains that were barely recognizable as fingers, legs and other 
A26  79 body parts. The stench of burnt flesh hung in the cold, damp air at 
A26  80 the site in the suburb of Bijlmermeer.<p/>
A26  81 <p_>Workers began digging deep into the wreckage to search 
A26  82 apartments that were sealed off by falling concrete.<p/>
A26  83 <p_>Mayor Ed van Thijn said the crash and the ensuing fire were so 
A26  84 ferocious that a full identification of all victims could prove 
A26  85 impossible.<p/>
A26  86 <p_><quote_>"We may never know who they are,"<quote/> he said at a 
A26  87 dawn news conference at City Hall.<p/>
A26  88 <p_>Huub Windhagen, a city spokesman, said the recovery operation 
A26  89 was now going ahead at full speed but stressed that searchers had 
A26  90 to be wary of the building's precarious state.<p/>
A26  91 <p_>Windhagen declined to predict how long the operation would 
A26  92 take, but officials said earlier it would last several days.<p/>
A26  93 <p_>The first 12 bodies recovered were those of three men, three 
A26  94 women, one child and five whose sex could not be immediately 
A26  95 determined.<p/>
A26  96 <p_>The corpses were taken to a makeshift morgue in an airport 
A26  97 hangar for identification by dentists and other specialists.<p/>
A26  98 <p_>The task of identifying victims was expected to be difficult, 
A26  99 because many are believed to be illegal aliens. The apartment 
A26 100 complex is home to many immigrants from 
A26 101 <}_><-|>Suriname<+|>Surinam<}/>, Ghana, the Dutch Antilles, Cape 
A26 102 Verde and Pakistan.<p/>
A26 103 <p_>Officials said they wouldn't act against victims' relatives who 
A26 104 might be illegal aliens, if they help identify the bodies.<p/>
A26 105 <p_>The disaster could prove to be the worst plane crash involving 
A26 106 casualties on the ground.<p/>
A26 107 <p_>Hutton Archer, spokesman for the International Civil Aviation 
A26 108 Organization in Montreal, said the crash of a Boeing 707 cargo 
A26 109 plane in 1976 killed 77 people on the ground and seriously injured 
A26 110 78 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.<p/>
A26 111 <p_>On Sunday, the El Al 747-200 slammed into the angle of the 
A26 112 V-shaped building 14 minutes after takeoff. Its pilot had reported 
A26 113 one starboard engine on fire six minutes after takeoff and the 
A26 114 other starboard engine ablaze six minutes later.<p/>
A26 115 <p_>The engines fell into a lake as the pilot dumped fuel and tried 
A26 116 to control the plane for an emergency landing. The pilot, the two 
A26 117 other crew members and the plane's one passenger all died.<p/>
A26 118 <p_>Investigators said it was too early to say why the two engines 
A26 119 caught fire. <quote_>"Our first impression is that it was technical 
A26 120 malfunction,"<quote/> said Transportation Minister Hanja 
A26 121 Maij-Weggen.<p/>
A26 122 <p_>El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman said the plane was in excellent 
A26 123 mechanical condition. He said the airline wouldn't comment on 
A26 124 possible causes until the investigation was finished.<p/>
A26 125 <p_>The plane was 13 1/2 years old. Officials said it underwent 
A26 126 routine maintenance last week. Fire department crews were draining 
A26 127 ponds and ditches near the crash site in their search for the 
A26 128 plane's flight recorder and bodies. Windhagen said 424 police, 74 
A26 129 fire<?_>-<?/>fighters and three dozen identification experts were 
A26 130 searching the apartment building.<p/>
A26 131 <p_>Officials said 80 apartments were ripped away altogether and 
A26 132 150 others were heavily damaged. More than 150 families were left 
A26 133 homeless.<p/>

A26 141 ground crew workers.<p/>
A26 142 <p_>Ground crews for USAir, the nation's sixth-largest airline, 
A26 143 walked off the job Monday in a dispute over job security, canceling 
A26 144 flights for thousands of people.<p/>
A26 145 <p_>Monday night, U.S. District Judge Timothy Lewis issued a ruling 
A26 146 ordering flight attendants back to work. The Association of Flight 
A26 147 Attendants - which represents 9,000 USAir employees, voted to honor 
A26 148 the strike by the International Association of Machinists.<p/>

A26 156 <p_>The striking union represents about 8,300 employees, and many 
A26 157 of them said the main issue was job security - not wages or 
A26 158 benefits.<p/>
A26 159 <p_>Union and airline negotiators were unable to agree on a new 
A26 160 contract after lengthy weekend talks that lasted into Monday 
A26 161 morning. National Mediation Board spokes<?_>-<?/>man Lew Townsend 
A26 162 said early Monday no other talks were scheduled. He couldn't 
A26 163 immediately be reached late Monday.<p/>
A26 164 <p_>USAir is asking all employees for wage, benefit and work rule 
A26 165 concessions, so it can cut costs by about $400 million this year. 
A26 166 Pilots agreed to salary concessions in June.<p/>
A26 167 <p_>After talks with the machinists broke off,  picket lines 
A26 168 sprouted at airports around the country, including San Francisco. 
A26 169 The airline runs 18 USAir Shuttle flights from SFO to Los Angeles 
A26 170 each day.<p/>
A26 171 <p_>Ten flights out of SFO were canceled Monday, said USAir 
A26 172 spokeswoman Agnes Huff. <quote_>"We operated 37 out of 47 scheduled 
A26 173 flights.  We will try to maintain that number of flights, and 
A26 174 hopefully build onto that number in the days ahead,"<quote/> she 
A26 175 said.<p/>
A26 176 <p_>Huff suggested that passengers call a day before their 
A26 177 scheduled flight to check its status.<p/>
A26 178 <p_>USAir said 75 percent of its 2,600 daily departures were taking 
A26 179 off and other carriers were accepting stranded passengers.<p/>
A26 180 <p_>The airline said its overseas flights - three departures daily 
A26 181 to London, two to Frankfurt and one to Paris - were not affected, 
A26 182 nor were the USAir Express and USAir Shuttle services.<p/>

A26 184 <h_><p_>New UC president asked to simplify executive pay<p/>
A26 185 <p_>System faces crisis in public confidence over compensation to 
A26 186 top administrators<p/>
A26 187 <p_>By Katherine Seligman<p/>
A26 188 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A26 189 <p_>LOS ANGELES - In his first tumultuous week on the job, 
A26 190 University of California President Jack Peltason has been asked to 
A26 191 solve the public relations crisis stemming from how the university 
A26 192 pays its top administrators.<p/>
A26 193 <p_>University regents at a special meeting Monday requested that 
A26 194 Peltason devise a way of simplifying executive compensation. The 
A26 195 new method could eliminate some or all of the generous and 
A26 196 controversial perks given to high-ranking administrators.<p/>
A26 197 <p_>Regents praised a report by former legislative analyst A. Alan 
A26 198 Post that called for dropping all such <quote|>"ill-advised" 
A26 199 benefits, but they did not recommend that Peltason embrace all of 
A26 200 Post's suggestions. Peltason stressed that he would not consider a 
A26 201 plan that cut executive pay.<p/>
A26 202 <p_><quote_>"The consensus today is that we need to 
A26 203 simplify,"<quote/> said Peltason. <quote_>"We need to not only pay 
A26 204 adequate wages but those that people understand."<quote/><p/>
A26 205 <p_>Peltason will make his recommendations to regents in November. 
A26 206 Monday's meeting was an attempt to assuage to public anger over a 
A26 207 host of complicated benefits given to top administrators that 
A26 208 boosted their salaries more than 20 percent.<p/>
A26 209 <p_>Post reiterated to regents a major theme of his report: that 
A26 210 public confidence in UC has been at an all-time low since news 
A26 211 leaked out about a retirement deal given to former President David 
A26 212 Gardner.<p/>
A26 213 <p_>Gardner, who was not at the meeting but has called Post's 
A26 214 report a <quote_>"series of assertions"<quote/> not rooted in fact, 
A26 215 is scheduled to get a one-time payment of about $900,000 plus a 
A26 216 yearly pension of a $126,000.<p/>
A26 217 <p_>Post criticized the secretive manner in which regents had given 
A26 218 Gardner the benefits as well as the motivation for using a system 
A26 219 of deferred compensation that awarded money at the end of a set 
A26 220 period of service instead of in a regular paycheck.<p/>
A26 221 <p_>Post said regents were unwilling to take the political heat by 
A26 222 raising salaries outright. He urged regents to review all special 
A26 223 forms of compensation, including deferred income, special 
A26 224 supplemental retirement pay, special severance pay for spouses and 
A26 225 housing allowances.<p/>
A26 226 <h_>Pay raises instead of perks?<h/>
A26 227 <p_>If Peltason recommends dropping some of the perks, regents will 
A26 228 still have to face the thorny issue of raising executive pay to 
A26 229 make up for the lost benefits. Legislators, faculty and students 
A26 230 have expressed outrage over Gardner's and other top administrators' 
A26 231 compensation when faculty salaries have been frozen for two years 
A26 232 and student fees have jumped 85 percent in the past three years.<p/>
A26 233 <p_>Terminating the deferred compensation plan would mean that UC's 
A26 234 nine chancellors would make an average of 21 percent less than 
A26 235 chancellors at a comparable group of universities researched by the 
A26 236 California Postsecondary Commission. With perks, UC chancellors 
A26 237 make an average of $190,000,  about 5 percent less than the 
A26 238 comparison group, whose average pay is $200,200.<p/>

A27   1 <#FROWN:A27\><h_><p_>LA&S dean addresses critics, problems<p/>
A27   2 <p_>By Eric Krol and Sean McClellan<p/>
A27   3 <p_>Staff Reporters<p/><h/>
A27   4 <p_>Answering critics and improving undergraduate advising were 
A27   5 among the topics brought forth Friday at an annual meeting of the 
A27   6 College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.<p/>
A27   7 <p_>LA&S Dean James Norris gave his annual state of the college 
A27   8 address to a nearly-packed Collins Auditorium at Cole Hall on 
A27   9 Friday afternoon.<p/>
A27  10 <p_>LA&S faculty gathered to hear Norris review the past year and 
A27  11 highlight the upcoming one.<p/>
A27  12 <p_>Norris addressed the media's summertime attacks on higher 
A27  13 education, calling them a bundle of <quote_>"errors, ignorance, and 
A27  14 truth."<quote/> Norris was referring to articles which stated that 
A27  15 professors were unconcerned with educating undergraduates and that 
A27  16 universities are inefficient on the whole.<p/>
A27  17 <p_><quote_>"We need to be more aware in answering our 
A27  18 critics,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A27  19 <p_>Norris also had praise for the appointment of J. Carroll Moody 
A27  20 as Acting Provost. Moody replaced the North Dakota-bound Kendall 
A27  21 Baker during the summer.<p/>
A27  22 <p_>He also discussed the recommendations of last semester's 
A27  23 Academic Resources Advisory Committee. ARAC was charged with the 
A27  24 task of identifying 3 percent of each college's budget for 
A27  25 reallocation; however, Norris said the committee's report is 
A27  26 already dated. The Illinois Board of Higher Education has now 
A27  27 shifted its policy towards productivity, quality and demand, he 
A27  28 added.<p/>
A27  29 <p_>The IBHE will be meeting to discuss these issues Sept. 3 and 
A27  30 also have started releasing 'hit lists' of unproductive programs to 
A27  31 state universities.<p/>
A27  32 <p_>Norris expressed concern that paring down universities will 
A27  33 become a trend. <quote_>"This is not a one<?_>-<?/>time sacrifice 
A27  34 of the virgin to the volcano,"<quote/> Norris said. <quote_>"This 
A27  35 will be every year."<quote/><p/>
A27  36 <p_>Norris offered many methods of battling attacks on higher 
A27  37 education and state funding cuts.<p/>
A27  38 <p_>Departments should eliminate bottlenecks, he said, which are 
A27  39 required classes offered once every few semesters. Professors 
A27  40 should look at courses and ask themselves, <quote_>"Are they 
A27  41 designed for undergraduates or my research topic?"<quote/> he 
A27  42 added.<p/>
A27  43 <p_>Norris also recommended looking at faculty work<?_>-<?/>loads 
A27  44 and target credit<?_>-<?/>hour production, but admitted that 
A27  45 different disciplines have different methods. <quote_>"I don't have 
A27  46 a magic formula,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A27  47 <p_>Norris said Associate Dean Donald Cress examined the situation 
A27  48 and found that if every faculty member was forced to teach one more 
A27  49 class, there would not be enough space for all of the added 
A27  50 classes.<p/>
A27  51 <p_>A question-and-answer session followed the speech, where the 
A27  52 subjects of advising undergraduates and consolidating departments 
A27  53 were discussed.<p/>
A27  54 <p_>Norris suggested rewarding faculty for doing student advising 
A27  55 work. This would counter the public perception that professors are 
A27  56 consumed with research and don't care about undergraduates.<p/>

A27  58 <h_><p_>IBHE approves Lincoln Hall renovation<p/>
A27  59 <p_>By Rob Heselbarth<p/>
A27  60 <p_>Business Affairs Reporter<p/><h/>
A27  61 <p_>One of NIU's aging residence halls will be receiving a facelift 
A27  62 next summer.<p/>
A27  63 <p_>The Board of Higher Education has given the nod for the 
A27  64 renovation of two Lincoln Residence Hall wings to be completed by 
A27  65 fall 1993.<p/>
A27  66 <p_>Student Housing Services Director Carl Jardine said the 
A27  67 renovation will turn the wings into <quote_>"suite-type 
A27  68 arrangements.<p/>
A27  69 <p_>"We distributed written surveys to the residents last spring to 
A27  70 get their input regarding the renovation,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A27  71 <p_>Suites will consist of three rooms - a living area and two 
A27  72 sleeping areas.<p/>
A27  73 <p_><quote_>"We have not decided which two wings to do, but that is 
A27  74 all part of the process,"<quote/> Jardine said. The type of 
A27  75 furniture also has not been determined, he added.<p/>
A27  76 <p_>Any vacancies in Lincoln Hall this fall will be turned into 
A27  77 demo-rooms displaying different types of furniture under 
A27  78 consideration, he said.<p/>
A27  79 <p_>Because Lincoln Hall was built in the 1960s, Jardine said now 
A27  80 is the appropriate time to make significant changes.<p/>
A27  81 <p_>Business and Operations Vice President James Harder said the 
A27  82 project money will come from revenue bond funds, which support the 
A27  83 residence hall system.<p/>
A27  84 <p_>The initial estimated cost for the project was $600,000 to 
A27  85 $700,000, but plans are not far enough along to come up with any 
A27  86 definite figures, he said.<p/>
A27  87 <p_>Patricia Hewitt, associate vice president of business and 
A27  88 operations, said the final price will be determined by room options 
A27  89 students choose before they move in and the number of floors 
A27  90 renovated.<p/>
A27  91 <p_>However, Jardine said the project's cost will be kept at a 
A27  92 minimum to keep the cost of residential rooms at the same level 
A27  93 next year.<p/>

A27  95 <h_><p_>Acting chair named to HFR<p/>
A27  96 <p_>By Alex Gary<p/>
A27  97 <p_>Staff Reporter<p/><h/>
A27  98 <p_>NIU has a new chair of the human and family resources 
A27  99 department.<p/>
A27 100 <p_>Mary Pritchard, who has been at NIU for nine years, was named 
A27 101 acting chair for the 1992-93 academic year.<p/>
A27 102 <p_>Pritchard is succeeding Earl Goodman, who retired after 20 
A27 103 years at NIU. Goodman had been chair of the HFR department for the 
A27 104 past five years.<p/>
A27 105 <p_>One of Pritchard's objectives will be to improve alumni 
A27 106 relations, she said. <quote_>"My goal is to get at least one 
A27 107 newsletter out,"<quote/> Pritchard said.<p/>
A27 108 <p_>Pritchard has a long list of accomplishments in her years at 
A27 109 NIU. She has been coordinator of the family and child studies 
A27 110 program since 1990. Also, Pritchard helped develop the university's 
A27 111 new student mentoring project. She chaired NIU's Undergraduate 
A27 112 Coordinating Council for one year.<p/>
A27 113 <p_>As acting chair, Pritchard, who is a faculty member, said her 
A27 114 role in the university will be very different. <quote_>"I will be a 
A27 115 full<?_>-<?/>time administrator. I will not be teaching classes 
A27 116 this year,"<quote/> she said.<p/>
A27 117 <p_>Pritchard, an expert on family economics, has a master's degree 
A27 118 from Iowa State and a doctorate in consumer economics from Purdue 
A27 119 University. In addition to her work at NIU, Pritchard is a former 
A27 120 president of the Illinois Consumer Education Association and has 
A27 121 presented papers to the American Council on Family Relations and 
A27 122 the National Health and Nutrition Survey.<p/>

A27 125 <p_>By Philip Dalton<p/>
A27 126 <p_>Student Association Reporter<p/><h/>
A27 127 <p_>One of NIU's very own has been chosen to replace Tim Bagby on 
A27 128 the DeKalb County Board for the seventh district.<p/>
A27 129 <p_>NIU student Eric Carter was chosen by a Republican caucus to 
A27 130 replace Bagby, who stepped down earlier this year. Carter was 
A27 131 chosen from a number of candidates in the district. He will be 
A27 132 running for the position in the Nov. 3 election.<p/>
A27 133 <p_>Carter is a senior pursuing a degree in political science. He 
A27 134 is also an active member of the NIU College Republicans Club.<p/>
A27 135 <p_>He said he hopes to represent student issues on the county 
A27 136 board and also would like to see the board work more closely with 
A27 137 the growing cities of Sycamore and DeKalb.<p/>
A27 138 <p_>Carter also plans to be involved with the county budget, an 
A27 139 issue he said he considers to be one of the major ones.<p/>
A27 140 <p_>The board soon will begin a $25,000 study to research user 
A27 141 fees. He said the study might result in the lowering of certain 
A27 142 fees. Other issues he said he regards as important include the 
A27 143 funding issue at the DeKalb County Nursing Home, 2331 Sycamore 
A27 144 Road, and the treatment of the area forest preserves.<p/>
A27 145 <p_>In order to keep in touch with city issues as well as student 
A27 146 concerns, Carter invited students and all residents of the district 
A27 147 to come to the county board meetings, which always are open to the 
A27 148 public.<p/>
A27 149 <p_>Carter said he is open for student suggestions or questions, 
A27 150 and so is Margaret Phillips, area coordinator for Neptune and 
A27 151 Gilbert Halls, who is also a member of the DeKalb County Board.<p/>

A27 154 <p_>By Philip Dalton<p/>
A27 155 <p_>Student Association Reporter<p/><h/>
A27 156 <p_>The heat of this year's presidential election is sparking 
A27 157 activity on NIU's campus this fall.<p/>
A27 158 <p_>NIU's College Republicans and Young Democrats kicked off their 
A27 159 fall election year activities at Friday Fest in the MLK Commons.<p/>
A27 160 <p_>Both groups distributed literature and answered questions 
A27 161 pertaining to their party candidates in upcoming elections.<p/>
A27 162 <p_>Kevin Hir, president of the College Republicans, said he would 
A27 163 like to get people involved in order to help erase labels of apathy 
A27 164 he believes are attached to younger Americans.<p/>
A27 165 <p_>Young Democrats' President Bradley Strauss said he has 
A27 166 <quote_>"lots of enthusiasm about the election,"<quote/> and he 
A27 167 would like to register every student on NIU's campus to vote.<p/>
A27 168 <p_>Student Regent John Butler said the Student Association hopes 
A27 169 to begin a campaign of registering student voters for local, state 
A27 170 and national elections.<p/>
A27 171 <p_><quote_>"Paralleling that will be efforts at exposing students 
A27 172 to issues of the 1992 campaign with the help of the Young 
A27 173 Democrats, College Republicans and other organizations interested 
A27 174 in helping,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A27 175 <p_><quote_>"We hope to have forums and if possible, visiting 
A27 176 speakers,"<quote/> he added.<p/>
A27 177 <p_>Hir said the Republicans are enthusiastic about debating the 
A27 178 Democrats. Strauss also expressed an interest in a public forum.<p/>
A27 179 <p_>Butler encouraged any other group interested in participating 
A27 180 to contact the SA office at 753-0482.<p/>
A27 181 <p_>The Young Democrats will be holding an open meeting Wednesday 
A27 182 at 9 p.m. Anyone interested in attending should call Strauss at 
A27 183 758-2712.<p/>
A27 184 <p_>The College Republicans also will be holding an organizational

A27 188 <h_><p_>Grant to fund workshops for blind, deaf<p/>
A27 189 <p_>By Heather Pingel<p/>
A27 190 <p_>Staff Reporter<p/><h/>
A27 191 <p_>Recently NIU received a rather large three-year grant from the 
A27 192 U.S. Department of Education's Rehabilitation Services 
A27 193 Administration.<p/>
A27 194 <p_>NIU's Institute on Deafness will benefit in more ways than one 
A27 195 from a $250,458 grant, which officials already have plans for.<p/>
A27 196 <p_>Project Coordinator Greg Mosher said the money will be used to 
A27 197 fund workshops for specialists who want to work with those blind 
A27 198 and/or deaf. People are currently being recruited from Illinois, 
A27 199 Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota.<p/>
A27 200 <p_>He said training for specialists will include a 
A27 201 ten<?_>-<?/>week long intensive workshop for a total of 180 people. 
A27 202 Ninety of these professionals will be working with the blind, and 
A27 203 the other half will be working with the deaf.<p/>
A27 204 <p_>The first week-long workshop will run from Sept. 29 into the 
A27 205 first week of November. Those who attend workshops will be charged 
A27 206 a small registration fee, which has yet to be decided.<p/>
A27 207 <p_>Mosher said there is a great need for workshops for the blind 
A27 208 and deaf in the Illinois area.<p/>
A27 209 <p_><quote_>"Illinois, the only state that has conducted research 
A27 210 units for the deaf and blind population, has identified 1,868 
A27 211 residents who are both blind and deaf,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A27 212 <p_>But NIU has been on top of such programs from way back. The 
A27 213 Northern Institute on Deafness has a 15-year reputation of 
A27 214 maintaining both pre- and in-service training in deafness 
A27 215 rehabilitation and training in visual impairment.<p/>
A27 216 <p_>Mosher also said that it is difficult to find workers who are 
A27 217 able to deal with the problems of a person who has one disability, 
A27 218 let alone handle the problems of people with two disabilities.<p/>
A27 219 <p_>He said he is looking for rehabilitational professionals who 
A27 220 have knowledge of psychosocial, medical, educational and vocational 
A27 221 aspects of the disabilities. Also, persons who are familiar with 
A27 222 sign language, mobility and helping devices.<p/>
A27 223 <p_><quote_>"Few rehabilitation professionals possess all these 
A27 224 skills, so qualified workers are scarce,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A27 225 <p_>Mosher added that the grant will also aid the salary of hiring 
A27 226 professionals to come in and train all willing applicants.<p/>
A27 227 <p_>Anyone interested in a possible position with the Institute on 
A27 228 Deafness can contact Mosher at 753-6545.<p/>

A27 231 <p_>By Kevin Lyons<p/>
A27 232 <p_>Staff Reporter<p/><h/>
A27 233 <p_>The NIU chapter of the Golden Key National Honor Society 
A27 234 presented its newest program, College Connection, at a national 
A27 235 Golden Key Honor Society convention in Scottsdale, Ariz. this 
A27 236 summer.<p/>
A27 237 <p_>In addition, for the third year in a row, the NIU chapter was 
A27 238 one of 28 to receive the Key Chapter Award from the national 
A27 239 society.<p/>
A27 240 <p_>College Connection is a program geared at encouraging high 
A27 241 school students to continue their education, Cory Flanagan, faculty 
A27 242 adviser, said.<p/>
A27 243 <p_>Flanagan said the program is worked in three phases and the 
A27 244 chapter is currently in the third phase of its first year of 
A27 245 College Connection.<p/>
A27 246 <p_>The first phase involves speaking at local high schools on 
A27 247 furthering education. Last year, Golden Key members spoke at DeKalb 
A27 248 and Sycamore High Schools.<p/>
A27 249 <p_>Flanagan said the talks can be geared to a certain student 
A27 250 group or students in general. She said the talks do not necessarily 
A27 251 promote four<?_>-<?/>year universities, but also junior colleges, 
A27 252 technical schools and military opportunities.<p/>
A27 253 <p_><quote_>"We want to provide as much information as possible for 
A27 254 viable educational opportunities,"<quote/> she said.<p/>
A27 255 <p_><quote_>"If we influence anyone to continue his education, 
A27 256 we've met our goal,"<quote/> Flanagan said.<p/>
A27 257 <p_>In the second phase, high school students are brought to NIU 
A27 258 and allowed to go to classes, social events and sporting events, 
A27 259 Flanagan said.<p/>

A28   6 circus. When I found out I had cancer, I said 'Hell with it, I'm 
A28   7 going to go out and have fun.'"<quote/><p/>
A28   8 <p_>Zajicek, a retired plant manager, travels with the Culpepper 
A28   9 and Merriweather Circus which gave two shows in Sycamore Saturday, 
A28  10 sponsored by Sycamore's Fraternal Order of Police. Zajicek 
A28  11 estimated that over 1,000 people attended the two performances.<p/>
A28  12 <p_>Zajizek is the father of elephant trainer Jim Zajicek, who 
A28  13 joined the circus at 16. One of Zajicek's three sons became a 
A28  14 history teacher, one a surgeon's assistant. Jim knew early on that 
A28  15 he was cut out for the circus. He became a high wire acrobat and 
A28  16 fire-eater, and later the trainer of a 4,000 pound African elephant

A28  37 <p_>Circus owner Robert 'Red' Johnson is out of his sequined emcee

A28  40 rest of the crew. Johnson also performs with the cast. Many 
A28  41 employees do more than one thing - they perform, run concessions, 
A28  42 sell tickets, put up the tent.<p/>

A28  65 <h_><p_>District to treat landfill leachate<p/>
A28  66 <p_>By Kathy Guyer<p/>
A28  67 <p_>Staff writer<p/><h/>
A28  68 <p_>The DeKalb County Landfill is expected to soon begin bringing 
A28  69 its leachate, the naturally occurring liquids that are created when 
A28  70 garbage decomposes, to the DeKalb Sanitary District for 
A28  71 treatment.<p/>
A28  72 <p_>Mike Zima, sanitary district manager, said the treatment of 
A28  73 leachate at sanitary districts is allowed by the Illinois 
A28  74 Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA).<p/>
A28  75 <p_>The IEPA requires that leachate be removed from landfills and 
A28  76 treated before it is returned to the environment, Zima said. The 
A28  77 DeKalb Sanitary District returns its water to the Kishwaukee River 
A28  78 after treatment.<p/>
A28  79 <p_>Dale Hoekstra, general manager of Waste Management, Inc., the 
A28  80 company that owns DeKalb County Landfill, said they must obtain two 
A28  81 permits from the IEPA before they can start bringing their leachate 
A28  82 to the sanitary district.<p/>
A28  83 <p_>They have already received one of the permits from the IEPA 
A28  84 division of land and they are waiting for the second permit from 
A28  85 the IEPA division of water, Hoekstra said.<p/>
A28  86 <p_>Treatment of leachate at sanitary districts is common, Hoekstra 
A28  87 said. He noted that currently DeKalb County Landfill leachate is 
A28  88 transported to Calumet City to Waste Management's own treatment 
A28  89 facility or to Elgin's sanitary district.<p/>
A28  90 <p_>Under the agreement, Waste Management will pay 2 cents per 
A28  91 gallon for all leachate brought to the sanitary district, Zima 
A28  92 said. No more than 20,000 gallons per day of leachate can be 
A28  93 brought to the district, he added.<p/>
A28  94 <p_>Zima said that 2 cents per gallon was cheap and other treatment 
A28  95 facilities charge up to 10 cents per gallon. He added that people 
A28  96 use an average of 100 gallons of water that ends up being treated 
A28  97 at the sanitary district each day and 20,000 gallons was the 
A28  98 equivalent of the amount of sewage water created each day by 200 
A28  99 people.<p/>
A28 100 <p_><quote_>"It will certainly help us keep our costs 
A28 101 down,"<quote/> Hoekstra added, noting the low per-gallon price and 
A28 102 savings in transportation.<p/>
A28 103 <p_>Hoekstra said the leachate is not hazardous.<p/>

A28 106 <p_>By Kathy Guyer<p/>
A28 107 <p_>Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A28 108 <p_>A 55-gallon drum filled with an unidentified substance sits on 
A28 109 the DeKalb parkway at Greg Protano's auto parts yard on Industrial 
A28 110 Drive.<p/>
A28 111 <p_>For a week the drum has sat there, roped off by the DeKalb Fire 
A28 112 Department, awaiting a representative from the Illinois 
A28 113 Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) to show up, test the liquid 
A28 114 inside and determine if it is a hazardous material.<p/>
A28 115 <p_>DeKalb Police Lt. Richard Moudy said his department received 
A28 116 the report from Protano on Aug. 19. Protano had arrived at the 
A28 117 scrap yard about 7 a.m. and found the abandoned barrel on the 
A28 118 parkway in front of his business.<p/>
A28 119 <p_>DeKalb Assistant Fire Chief Reuben Nelson said the fire 
A28 120 department went out and checked the barrel and found it contained 
A28 121 about five or six gallons of liquid.<p/>
A28 122 <p_>'Mineral spirits' was written on the barrel, Nelson said.<p/>
A28 123 <p_><quote_>"We're pretty certain that it's mostly water and paint 
A28 124 thinner,"<quote/> Nelson said. Firefighters attempted to ignite 
A28 125 some of the liquid and it wouldn't catch fire, he added.<p/>
A28 126 <p_>Although the liquid has not been tested, Nelson said he doesn't 
A28 127 believe it is hazardous material. Firefighters put the barrel in a 
A28 128 reinforced steel containment cannister and the IEPA was contacted, 
A28 129 he said.<p/>
A28 130 <p_>However, the city officials won't move the barrel because if 
A28 131 they do it becomes their responsibility, Nelson said.<p/>
A28 132 <p_><quote_>"It's an abandoned material, nobody has possession of 
A28 133 it now,"<quote/> Nelson said.<p/>
A28 134 <p_>If the city took possession of it and the material turns out to 
A28 135 be hazardous, it would then be the city's responsibility to dispose 
A28 136 of it, he said.<p/>
A28 137 <p_>Nelson said the fire department has not been notified that any 
A28 138 IEPA worker has been to the site. He added that if no one shows up 
A28 139 in another week, he will contact the IEPA.<p/>

A28 142 <p_>Fish kill results linger on<p/>
A28 143 <p_>By Jan Hicks<p/>
A28 144 <p_>Staff writer<p/><h/>
A28 145 <p_>Hartmann Farms will be required to pay for the loss of 15,284 
A28 146 fish killed by a hog manure spill from their property, but a 
A28 147 Sycamore resident who lives near the river thinks they should do 
A28 148 more than that.<p/>
A28 149 <p_>Thousands of fish died after 30,000 gallons of manure spilled 
A28 150 into the east branch of the Kishwaukee River on Tuesday, Aug. 11. 
A28 151 Sycamore residents began discovering the dead fish on Friday, Aug. 
A28 152 14, and Peggy Knight was one of them.<p/>
A28 153 <p_>Knight thinks the $3,676.80 fine, the Department of 
A28 154 Conservation's estimated value of the fish, is not enough. She'd 
A28 155 like someone to remove the piles of dead fish that have collected 
A28 156 in the creek bed behind her home.<p/>
A28 157 <p_><quote_>"I can't understand why the company responsible for the 
A28 158 fish kill didn't have to clean it up,"<quote/> Knight said 
A28 159 Monday.<p/>
A28 160 <p_><quote_>"Right after the fish count, they should have picked 
A28 161 them up, not just let them decay,"<quote/> Knight said. <quote_>"I 
A28 162 really think the EPA should have forced the hog farmer to clean up 
A28 163 the residential areas. It's OK where it's out in the middle of a 
A28 164 field."<quote/><p/>
A28 165 <p_>Knight's trailer home sits beside the river in Evergreen Park. 
A28 166 Behind her neatly clipped back lawn, about 70 large carp lay 
A28 167 rotting in the shallow water. At 7:20 p.m. Monday, the stench 
A28 168 overwhelmed the smoke from a barbecue grill nearby.<p/>
A28 169 <p_><quote_>"They're half decayed and full of maggots,"<quote/> she 
A28 170 said. <quote_>"These things are attracting tons of flies. I can't 
A28 171 imagine it's not some sort of health hazard."<quote/><p/>
A28 172 <p_>The river behind her trailer is only 4 inches deep, she said, 
A28 173 adding the creek is only 50 feet from her bedroom. Since her 
A28 174 trailer doesn't have central air conditioning, she said she has had 
A28 175 to leave the windows open.<p/>
A28 176 <p_><quote_>"There's not enough water at this part of the river to 
A28 177 wash them away,"<quote/> Knight said.<p/>
A28 178 <p_>Knight said she called both the DeKalb County Health Department 
A28 179 and the Environmental Protection Agency and both said they couldn't 
A28 180 help.<p/>
A28 181 <p_><quote_>"The health department told me if it bothered me, I 
A28 182 could clean it up,"<quote/> Knight said, adding the EPA told her 
A28 183 she could submit a bill for clean-up to the Hartmann Farms but that 
A28 184 if the company didn't pay it, she might end up having to file a 
A28 185 civil suit.<p/>
A28 186 <p_><quote_>"We have never picked up fish. It's not possible for us 
A28 187 to go out and collect 15,000 fish,"<quote/> said Gene Forster, of 
A28 188 the Rockford EPA field office. <quote_>"The first rain we get and 
A28 189 the first rise in the river will take that all away."<quote/><p/>
A28 190 <p_>The EPA's legal division in Springfield has not determined 
A28 191 whether to charge penalties to Hartmanns, over and above the value 
A28 192 of the fish and the expense of counting the fish, Forster said.<p/>
A28 193 <p_>Knight said parents try to keep children away since the fish 
A28 194 kill.<p/>

A28 196 <h_><p_>Suffers attack on job<p/>
A28 197 <p_>Department action saves firefighter<p/>
A28 198 <p_>By Mike Crase<p/>
A28 199 <p_>Staff writer<p/><h/>
A28 200 <p_>Sycamore firefighter Ben Henderson is living proof that one of 
A28 201 the Sycamore Fire Department's latest pieces of life-saving 
A28 202 equipment, a heart defibrillator, works.<p/>
A28 203 <p_>Henderson, 44, a 16-year veteran of the Sycamore Fire 
A28 204 Department, is recovering from a near fatal arrhythmia of his heart 
A28 205 that he suffered while on duty on July 18. Quick action by his 
A28 206 fellow firefighters saved his life. Arrhythmia is when a person's 
A28 207 heart starts beating irregularly.<p/>
A28 208 <p_><quote_>"This is what the doctors call an instant death 
A28 209 episode,"<quote/> Henderson said Monday. <quote_>"In other words 
A28 210 had I not been around a defibrillator, I probably would have died 
A28 211 instantly."<quote/><p/>
A28 212 <p_><quote_>"He was at the right place at the right time,"<quote/> 
A28 213 said Sycamore Fire Chief Larry Haffner.<p/>
A28 214 <p_>Henderson said he doesn't recall much of what happened.<p/>
A28 215 <p_><quote_>"We were sitting around the kitchen table, smoking and 
A28 216 joking and I started feeling bad and before I knew it the only 
A28 217 thing I could do was put my head on the table,"<quote/> Henderson 
A28 218 said. <quote_>"I couldn't holler for help, I couldn't do anything. 
A28 219 It started about five minutes after eight and lasted until about 10 
A28 220 or 15 minutes after eight. I really can't say, I was blacking out 
A28 221 at the time. What I thought was blacking out, I was actually dying 
A28 222 on duty."<quote/><p/>
A28 223 <p_>Todd Turner, a fellow firefighter, was working the same shift 
A28 224 Henderson was when the incident took place, about an hour after 
A28 225 they had started their shift. He said firemen started the necessary 
A28 226 procedures on Henderson.<p/>
A28 227 <p_>Henderson said he was hooked up to a heart monitor which 
A28 228 determined that his heart beat could be brought back to a regular 
A28 229 beat with the defibrillator.<p/>
A28 230 <p_>A defibrillator, Henderson said, uses an electrical charge to 
A28 231 establish a normal heart beat.<p/>
A28 232 <p_>Firemen defibrillated Henderson and his heart returned to a 
A28 233 regular beat. He was taken to Kishwaukee Community Hospital, 
A28 234 stabilized and flown by helicopter to SwedishAmerican Hospital in 
A28 235 Rockford where he spent three days in intensive care. He was then 
A28 236 transferred to Sinai-Samaritan hospital in Milwaukee where he 
A28 237 remained for another five days.<p/>
A28 238 <p_>Henderson said while in Milwaukee, doctors implanted a small 
A28 239 defibrillator in his chest which would automatically apply an 
A28 240 electrical charge if an irregular heart beat is detected.<p/>

A29   2 scrutiny<p/>
A29   3 <p_>City denies it wants to crimp growing business<p/>
A29   4 <p_>By Michael Utley and Martin Zimmerman<p/>
A29   5 <p_> Staff Writers of The Dallas Morning News<p/><h/>
A29   6 <p_>Bob Bishop lost his shirt in the topless club business.<p/>
A29   7 <p_>The owner of Sugars Dallas on Greenville Avenue lost his 
A29   8 operating license in January when local officials said he violated 
A29   9 the city's 6-year-old topless bar ordinance.<p/>
A29  10 <p_><quote_>"I can't tell you what this has done to me,"<quote/> 
A29  11 Mr. Bishop said during a recent interview. <quote_>"I put my entire 
A29  12 savings into that place. Then all of a sudden, the city says I have 
A29  13 to shut down, and what am I supposed to do for a 
A29  14 living?"<quote/><p/>
A29  15 <p_>Mr. Bishop is just one of several club owners who believe that 
A29  16 the city is out to put a major dent in Dallas' booming topless club 
A29  17 industry. City officials deny that they are, but seven club owners 
A29  18 have lost their licenses already this year.<p/>
A29  19 <p_>A rash of regulatory actions has once again focused attention 
A29  20 on Dallas' bevy of topless clubs. The clubs have become a huge 
A29  21 business, both in Dallas and around the country.<p/>
A29  22 <p_>Based on gross liquor sales, five of the top 10 non-hotel bars 
A29  23 in Dallas are topless clubs. Alcohol sales in all Dallas topless 
A29  24 clubs have grown 37 percent since 1988.<p/>
A29  25 <p_>During the past 12 months, the city's 20 topless clubs rang up 
A29  26 $25.7 million in alcoholic beverage sales alone. Cabaret Royale, on 
A29  27 Restaurant Row, grossed $3.3 million from drink sales - six times 
A29  28 more than a nearby T.G.I. Friday's, according to state records.<p/>
A29  29 <p_>On a typical Friday night, nearly 700 women are dancing topless 
A29  30 in Dallas clubs. About 1,200 women work as topless dancers in 
A29  31 Dallas - some earning $500 and more a night, all in tips.<p/>
A29  32 <p_>The clubs' popularity doesn't stop at the city limits. 
A29  33 Arlington officials are alarmed by the growing number of topless 
A29  34 bars in their city and are considering tough new laws to control 
A29  35 them. Several topless clubs are operating in Arlington, and two 
A29  36 more are in the works.<p/>
A29  37 <h_><p_>$3 billion business<p/><h/>
A29  38 <p_>In the United States, the trade magazine <tf_>Gentleman's 
A29  39 Club<tf/> estimates, there are now more than 1,300 topless clubs, 
A29  40 where 10 million customers - almost all men - spend $3 billion a 
A29  41 year. And the growth is at the high end of the spectrum, where 
A29  42 upscale clubs such as Dallas' Cabaret Royale and The Men's Club are 
A29  43 transforming the industry.<p/>
A29  44 <p_><quote_>"The topless industry is an American 
A29  45 phenomenon,"<quote/> said Kevin King, publisher of <tf_>Gentleman's 
A29  46 Club<tf/>. And Dallas, to aficionados such as Mr. King, is the 
A29  47 Mecca of the topless industry.<p/>
A29  48 <p_><quote_>"The clubs in Dallas are leaders in casting aside the 
A29  49 seamy image of topless clubs and dressing them up to cater to the 
A29  50 tastes of a free-spending, white-collar clientele,"<quote/> Mr. 
A29  51 King wrote in a recent issue.<p/>
A29  52 <p_>Some consider that a dubious distinction at best. Upscale or 
A29  53 down, they say, topless clubs make lousy neighbors.<p/>
A29  54 <p_><quote_>"People see (topless clubs) around, and they don't want 
A29  55 to live anywhere near them,"<quote/> said Coffer Realty president 
A29  56 Gerry Coffer, who fought the license renewal for Sheer D'Lite, an 
A29  57 East Dallas topless bar that is appealing its recent license 
A29  58 revocation.<p/>
A29  59 <p_>Also, women's advocates argue that clubs degrade women and 
A29  60 exploit them economically.<p/>
A29  61 <p_><quote_>"It's definitely exploitation. Women can't get a job 
A29  62 that pays them a decent salary, so they work in a topless 
A29  63 bar,"<quote/> said Karen Ashmore, co-founder of a local chapter of 
A29  64 the National Organization for Women. <quote_>"It's a backlash to 
A29  65 women being more a part of mainstream society."<quote/><p/>
A29  66 <p_>Says El Arnold of the Dallas Association for Decency: 
A29  67 <quote_>"(Topless clubs) take young girls and put them in very 
A29  68 degrading situations. It's not the kind of thing you'd want your 
A29  69 daughter to undergo."<quote/><p/>
A29  70 <p_>Still, a recent city licensing hearing for the Million Dollar 
A29  71 Saloon, another Greenville Avenue topless club, drew no protesters 
A29  72 despite ample advance publicity. In fact, several nearby business 
A29  73 owners attended the meeting to express support for the club.<p/>
A29  74 <h_><p_>Convention clients<p/><h/>
A29  75 <p_>Dallas' emergence as a top market for topless entertainment 
A29  76 stems in part from its ability to attract conventions, which supply 
A29  77 a steady stream of topless-club patrons.<p/>
A29  78 <p_><quote_>"You do have a call for that type of business at 
A29  79 conventions,"<quote/> said Michelle Bogard of Ticket To The City, 
A29  80 whose convention-going clients have snapped up more than 10,000 
A29  81 passes to the Million Dollar Saloon in less than a year. 
A29  82 <quote_>"It's a fact of life."<quote/><p/>
A29  83 <p_>One local businessman says: <quote_>"When I have a client come 
A29  84 in town from Des Moines, he wants to go to a topless club. Dallas 
A29  85 is famous for that."<quote/><p/>
A29  86 <p_>Club owners go to great pains to distinguish between the 
A29  87 new-style topless clubs and old-line strip joints. Salah Izzedin, 
A29  88 the main principal in Cabaret Royale, argues that such clubs have 
A29  89 cleaned up a sleazy business and given it sophistication and 
A29  90 cachet.<p/>
A29  91 <p_><quote_>"We are very proud to have set new standards for this 
A29  92 business across the country,"<quote/> said Mr. Izzedin, a former 
A29  93 Houston-based topless-club impresario who plans to open Cabaret 
A29  94 Royales in several U.S. cities.<p/>
A29  95 <p_>On the surface, at least, it would be hard to confuse The Men's 
A29  96 Club in North Dallas, the newest of the city's upscale topless 
A29  97 clubs, with more traditional clubs such as Baby Dolls on Northwest 
A29  98 Highway or Showtime on Lover's Lane.<p/>
A29  99 <p_>The upscale clubs target well-heeled business executives and 
A29 100 they charge prices to match. At Cabaret Royale, for instance, the 
A29 101 evening cover charge is $10, parking costs $3, and beers are $4.95 
A29 102 apiece. At the Men's Club, the cover is $7. By contrast, Showtime 
A29 103 charges $3.<p/>
A29 104 <p_>Not surprising, net profit margins in the topless business can 
A29 105 be 50 percent higher than the 20 to 25 percent margin regular 
A29 106 nightclubs can achieve, said John Kirkendoll, chairman of the 
A29 107 company that owns Gold Club topless clubs.<p/>
A29 108 <h_><p_>Competition heats up<p/><h/>
A29 109 <p_>Mr. King foresees a shakeout in the topless business as cities 
A29 110 such as Dallas begin to crack down on the clubs. Older, 
A29 111 under-capitalized clubs at the seedy end of the scale will be 
A29 112 closed, he says. Upscale clubs, with millions invested and plenty 
A29 113 in reserve to finance court battles with regulators, will flourish, 
A29 114 he predicts.<p/>
A29 115 <p_>Even the high-dollar clubs may get squeezed as competition 
A29 116 heats up. Mr. Kirkendoll said the opening of The Men's Club in July 
A29 117 may have signaled the saturation point for Dallas. Future clubs 
A29 118 probably will draw from the existing customer base.<p/>
A29 119 <p_>But as long as the city allows the existing clubs to stay open, 
A29 120 money will continue to be made, says Mr. Kirkendoll, who hopes to 
A29 121 sell stock in his Dallas-based Entertainment Corp. of America to 
A29 122 the public later this year to raise money for expansion.<p/>
A29 123 <p_><quote_>"I don't see anybody going under economically,"<quote/> 
A29 124 he said, <quote_>"because the demand is so high."<quote/><p/>
A29 125 <p_>When Mr. Kirkendoll talks about demand, he's got men like Carl 
A29 126 and John in mind.<p/>
A29 127 <p_>The men, who didn't want to give their last names, were sitting 
A29 128 in the Million Dollar Saloon on a recent weekday afternoon, jackets 
A29 129 off, ties loosened - a couple of 40-something white-collar types 
A29 130 out for a good time. To them, there's no big mystery about the 
A29 131 allure of topless clubs.<p/>
A29 132 <p_><quote_>"We come here to see all these gorgeous girls, what 
A29 133 else?"<quote/> Carl said. <quote_>"The women are just beautiful, 
A29 134 unbelievably beautiful."<quote/><p/>
A29 135 <p_>Says John, <quote_>"It's every guy's fantasy to have a bunch of 
A29 136 great-looking women falling all over him, and that's what you get 
A29 137 here."<quote/><p/>
A29 138 <p_>According to industry experts, topless club patrons routinely 
A29 139 spend as much as $100 on each visit to a topless club. About a 
A29 140 third of that buys drinks. The rest finances the entertainment - 
A29 141 the dancers.<p/>
A29 142 <p_><quote_>"Some girls walk out with $500 for a night, some with 
A29 143 $50,"<quote/> said Nikki, a fresh-faced 23-year-old from 
A29 144 Minneapolis who dances at Cabaret Royale. <quote_>"It all depends 
A29 145 how hard they work."<quote/><p/>
A29 146 <p_>The money is a powerful lure for attractive women in their late 
A29 147 teens and early 20s, especially if the employment alternative is a 
A29 148 low-paying service job.<p/>
A29 149 <p_>Recalls Nikki: <quote_>"I was working as a waitress in a 
A29 150 topless bar, and one night a guy bought a $4.95 drink and gave me a 
A29 151 $5 bill. At the same time, he tipped a dancer $100. Three days 
A29 152 later, I was dancing."<quote/><p/>
A29 153 <p_>Mr. Kirkendoll said some dancers make six-figure incomes. But 
A29 154 the norm is probably less than half that, given that most 
A29 155 <}_><-|>dancers'<+|>dancers<}/> rarely work five days a week.<p/>
A29 156 <p_>The dancers are independent contractors with no paychecks and 
A29 157 no regular schedule. The managers trust the dancers' money-making 
A29 158 instincts to know when the clubs are crowded and more dancers are 
A29 159 needed.<p/>
A29 160 <p_>Dancers' pay comes in cash. Patrons either tip a dancer while 
A29 161 she is on stage, slipping a bill beneath her G-string, or they buy 
A29 162 a dance at their tables, which costs about $20 a song.<p/>
A29 163 <p_>A dancer at Showtime, who asked to remain unidentified, said 
A29 164 she and her colleagues often prey on a customer's loneliness or 
A29 165 sexual frustration to siphon as many dollars as possible.<p/>
A29 166 <p_><quote_>"That's the bottom line,"<quote/> she said. 
A29 167 <quote_>"Dancers aren't here to find a boyfriend. They're here to 
A29 168 pay the rent."<quote/><p/>
A29 169 <p_>Not surprisingly, as Nikki notes, the dancers <quote_>"get 
A29 170 propositioned all the time."<quote/> Often enough, in fact, that 
A29 171 Cabaret Royale provides business cards for dancers to give to 
A29 172 aggressive customers reading: <quote_>"What you are suggesting is 
A29 173 illegal. ... If you persist, a manager will ask you to leave 
A29 174 immediately."<quote/><p/>
A29 175 <h_><p_>Alert for vice<p/><h/>
A29 176 <p_>Vice officers and club owners say prostitution is rare. Dancers 
A29 177 make enough money legally, they say. And the club owners have an 
A29 178 economic interest in keeping illegal activity, both prostitution 
A29 179 and drug use, out of their clubs.<p/>
A29 180 <p_>Most topless clubs have strict no-drugs policies. Places such 
A29 181 as the Gold Club randomly test employees for drug use, Mr. 
A29 182 Kirkendoll said.<p/>
A29 183 <p_>But dancers and others familiar with the business say drug use 
A29 184 remains a problem, especially among dancers at the mid- to 
A29 185 lower-level clubs.<p/>
A29 186 <p_>Earlier this year, the city suspended the operating license of 
A29 187 Caligula XXI on Northwest Highway for 15 days after employees were 
A29 188 arrested for allegedly selling cocaine in the club. And drug 
A29 189 arrests played a role in the city's decision to close down Sugars 
A29 190 altogether. However, the owner, Mr. Bishop, said the arrests didn't 
A29 191 lead to any convictions.<p/>
A29 192 <p_>Club owners said they try to keep drugs out of their clubs. But 
A29 193 the topless club lifestyle - attractive women making a lot of money 
A29 194 mixing with high rollers - creates an environment that can lead to 
A29 195 drug use.<p/>
A29 196 <p_><quote_>"It was a constant battle,"<quote/> recalls Steve 
A29 197 Albeck, who owned several Dallas topless clubs in the 1980s. 
A29 198 <quote_>"I'd talk to the dancers about it over and over and over 
A29 199 again, but it was hard to make it sink in."<quote/><p/>
A29 200 <p_>The strain of dealing with the dancers' lifestyles eventually 
A29 201 helped drive Mr. Albeck from the business. He sold out and with 
A29 202 partner Mike Murphy opened Cowboys, the popular country-Western 
A29 203 dance hall in Lakewood.<p/>
A29 204 <p_>He doesn't regret the change. <quote_>"Cowboys is 10 times the 
A29 205 size of Showtime,"<quote/> he said, <quote_>"but it's 10 times 
A29 206 easier to run."<quote/><p/>
A29 207 <h_><p_>Legal restrictions<p/><h/>
A29 208 <p_>One reason may be Chapter 41A of the Dallas City Code.<p/>
A29 209 <p_>The law was one of the first in the nation to regulate both the 
A29 210 locations of sexually oriented businesses and the character of 
A29 211 their owners. It bans such businesses from locating within 1,000 
A29 212 feet of a residential zone, school, church, park or other sexually 
A29 213 oriented businesses. It also attempts to keep convicted sexual 
A29 214 offenders out of the business.<p/>
A29 215 <p_>The city keeps track of topless clubs by requiring them to 
A29 216 obtain a cabaret license that is reviewed annually by the Dallas 
A29 217 Police Department's special investigations bureau.<p/>
A29 218 <p_>If a club is in violation of the ordinance - as many are - 
A29 219 Dallas police automatically revoke the license. The club owner then 
A29 220 must seek an exemption from the city's Permit and License Appeal 
A29 221 Board, which can grant exemptions from some city ordinances. The 
A29 222 board is made up of 15 citizens appointed by the City Council.<p/>
A29 223 <p_>In the past year, 17 topless clubs have asked for exemptions; 
A29 224 four have received them, seven have been denied, four are pending, 
A29 225 and two requests were dropped.<p/>
A29 226 <p_>Of the seven licenses denied this year, at least two have 
A29 227 challenged the decision through lawsuits. Sheer D'Lite is suing the 
A29 228 city in state district court and El Jardin Club, a Love Field-area 
A29 229 dance hall, has filed suit in federal court.<p/>

A30   7 <p_>BYRON - More than half of the City Council attended a Police

A30   9 or media.<p/>
A30  10 <p_>City Clerk Judy Gentry said she was not notified of the 
A30  11 Tuesday-night meeting and a notice was not posted on the door, 
A30  12 which is the method the community uses to inform the public.<p/>
A30  13 <p_>City attorney Dennis Riley said the meeting did not have to be 
A30  14 made public because the conversation was expected to be about 
A30  15 interdepartmental gripes and police department policies.<p/>
A30  16 <p_><quote_>"That doesn't fall under the auspice of a public 
A30  17 meeting,"<quote/> said Riley, who did not attend the meeting. 
A30  18 <quote_>"My understanding beforehand was that city policy and 
A30  19 procedure were not going to be discussed."<quote/><p/>
A30  20 <p_>Beth Bennett, the government affairs manager for the Illinois 
A30  21 Press Association, disagreed.<p/>
A30  22 <p_>She said police morale and the running of a police department 
A30  23 was city business and should be discussed in open meetings.<p/>
A30  24 <p_><quote_>"If the City Council is ultimately responsible, that's 
A30  25 public business,"<quote/> she said.<p/>
A30  26 <p_>Byron Sgt. Jim Wilcox said the meeting included questions about 
A30  27 raises and, in part, was intended to help train new officers.<p/>
A30  28 <p_>Ald. Herb Johnson, who attended the meeting, said the group 
A30  29 discussed the possibility of a retirement plan for police 
A30  30 officers.<p/>
A30  31 <p_>When asked if discussion about a retirement plan would

A30  54 <p_>A Winnebago County jailer has resigned from his position after 
A30  55 being accused in Ogle County of impersonating a police officer.<p/>
A30  56 <p_>Gregory J. Stobart, 37, 1624 Prairie Ave., who was a jailer for 
A30  57 more than three years, is scheduled to appear in Ogle County Court 
A30  58 on Sept. 11 on the charges of unlawful restraint.<p/>
A30  59 <p_>On April 13, a 17-year-old Davis Junction woman was stopped by 
A30  60 a man wearing what appeared to be a police uniform. He searched her 
A30  61 car and let her go, Ogle County Sheriff Mel Messer said.<p/>
A30  62 <p_>When police believed Stobart to be a suspect and searched his 
A30  63 home in early August, they discovered 11 mugshots taken at the 
A30  64 county jail, Winnebago County Sheriff Donald J. Gasparini said.<p/>

A30  69 coming off a 90-day leave of absence he took to care for a sick

A30  78 <p_><*_>black-square<*/>Court challenge promised: Fourteen property 
A30  79 owners are paying for last year's improvements on Elm, while 
A30  80 Victory's nine won't be assessed.<p/>
A30  81 <p_>By BRIAN LEAF<p/>
A30  82 <p_>The Register Star<p/><h/>
A30  83 <p_>MACHESNEY PARK - Victory Lane's million-dollar facelift won 
A30  84 approval from the Village Board yesterday. Now it may need approval 
A30  85 from a judge.<p/>
A30  86 <p_>Jeffrey Heid, who resigned last year as the village's public 
A30  87 works director, said he would seek a restraining order against the 
A30  88 project because it did not include a special assessment for owners 
A30  89 of nine properties on Victory Lane.<p/>
A30  90 <p_><quote_>"For years, people have been told the only way a street 
A30  91 will be reconstructed is if they share the cost,"<quote/> Heid 
A30  92 said. <quote_>"Hopefully, they'll go back and set it up as a 
A30  93 special assessment or special services area."<quote/><p/>
A30  94 <p_>Heid said the village rebuilt Elm Avenue last year, and 14 
A30  95 residents are paying a portion of the project's cost. Heid said his 
A30  96 assessment was $4,200.<p/>
A30  97 <p_>The assessment was levied after a majority of Elm Avenue 
A30  98 residents asked the village to improve the street. Mayor Frank 
A30  99 Bauer said Victory Lane residents did not petition for 
A30 100 improvements, and, therefore, wouldn't have to pay for the 
A30 101 reconstruction.<p/>
A30 102 <p_>Since 1983, Heid said 1,000 homes had been given special 
A30 103 assessments for street improvements, including the one owned by 
A30 104 retiree Betty Bauscher, 64.<p/>
A30 105 <p_>Bauscher said her special assessment for Elm Avenue was $10,000 
A30 106 and she couldn't understand why Victory Lane residents should get a 
A30 107 free ride.<p/>
A30 108 <p_><quote_>"I really can't understand why they should get it for 
A30 109 nothing when we didn't,"<quote/> Bauscher said.<p/>
A30 110 <p_>An ordinance to award the project to Schlichting & Sons 
A30 111 Excavating Co. for $1.02 million passed when Bauer broke a 3-3 tie 
A30 112 on the Village Board. The village will borrow the money to pay for 
A30 113 the project.<p/>
A30 114 <p_>Bauer said Marquette Elementary School children were at risk 
A30 115 because of Victory Lane's poor condition, particularly during the 
A30 116 winter when they must walk on the street.<p/>
A30 117 <p_>The village contends that traffic on Victory Lane will increase 
A30 118 when the Harlem Road-Elmwood Road bridge opens next year and 
A30 119 northwest Rockford residents begin using it to get to the Machesney 
A30 120 Park Mall.<p/>
A30 121 <p_>But to set up a special assessment district, five of the nine 
A30 122 property owners would have to petition the village and agree to pay 
A30 123 a share of the project. Bauer said that getting a majority wasn't 
A30 124 likely.<p/>
A30 125 <p_><quote_>"I know we could never get them to petition 
A30 126 us,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"Are we going to wait for those 
A30 127 people to get 51 percent, or are we going to build the 
A30 128 road?"<quote/><p/>

A30 136 <p_>A man who said his public defenders coerced him into pleading 
A30 137 guilty to killing another teen-ager last summer will get a new day 
A30 138 in court.<p/>
A30 139 <p_>Edmond Lilly, 20, goes on trial this week for the murder of 
A30 140 17-year-old Tyree Little, who was shot July 27, 1991, after a melee 
A30 141 on Blaisdell Street.<p/>
A30 142 <p_>This trial comes six months after Lilly pleaded guilty to 
A30 143 attempted murder in a plea bargain negotiated on the opening day of 
A30 144 his first trial.<p/>
A30 145 <p_>The plea bargain angered Little's family, who said they didn't 
A30 146 understand how Lilly could get a first-degree murder charge reduced 
A30 147 to attempted murder.<p/>
A30 148 <p_>Assistant State's Attorney Robert Miller said he agreed to the 
A30 149 plea because the testimony about the fight was confusing and 
A30 150 attempted murder carried a stiffer sentence than second-degree 
A30 151 murder.<p/>
A30 152 <p_>According to court documents, an argument between two teen-age 
A30 153 girls over a boy they liked grew into a street fight that involved 
A30 154 up to 40 youths. Lilly was standing behind a tree when he allegedly 
A30 155 fired three shots from a rifle, hitting Little in the chest and 
A30 156 another man, Robert Johnson, in the leg.<p/>
A30 157 <p_>Two weeks after the plea, Lilly wrote a letter to Judge David 
A30 158 Smith blaming his public defenders - Edward Light and Gary Pumilia 
A30 159 - for pressuring him into the plea by bringing his parents in to 
A30 160 convince him.<p/>
A30 161 <p_><quote_>"They started telling me I was going to get 90 years, 
A30 162 saying that Judge Smith might not like you so he's going to give 
A30 163 you a stiff sentence. They were too interested in getting the case 
A30 164 over with,"<quote/> Lilly wrote in the letter, asking for a new 
A30 165 lawyer and a new chance at a trial.<p/>
A30 166 <p_><quote_>"They persuaded me into taking a plea for something I 
A30 167 didn't do,"<quote/> he wrote. <quote_>"I was so upset. I wanted to 
A30 168 tell you, but I didn't want you to get angry with me."<quote/><p/>
A30 169 <p_>At the Feb. 27 plea hearing, Lilly never indicated that he was 
A30 170 upset with the agreement. When the judge asked Lilly if he 
A30 171 understood his rights and if he was satisfied with his lawyer, 
A30 172 Lilly said <quote|>"yes." Lilly also said no threats or force were 
A30 173 used to get him to plead guilty.<p/>
A30 174 <p_>Both Light and Pumilia testified later that they did not 
A30 175 pressure Lilly or make threats about a stiff sentence.<p/>
A30 176 <p_>After a hearing in June, Smith allowed Lilly to withdraw his 
A30 177 plea and scheduled a new trial date. The case was re-assigned to 
A30 178 Judge David Englund's courtroom, where opening arguments are 
A30 179 expected today.<p/>

A30 185 <p_>The Register Star<p/><h/>
A30 186 <p_>Teacher talks resume in Harlem today as leaders meet to head 
A30 187 off a strike, while in Belvidere, teachers yesterday threatened to 
A30 188 strike if the next round of talks don't produce a settlement.<p/>
A30 189 <p_>In Belvidere, the School Board and teachers met about nine 
A30 190 hours with a federal mediator yesterday, but failed to reach an 
A30 191 agreement. The teachers' union also filed an intent-to-strike 
A30 192 notice. The notice doesn't mean a strike will happen, only that it 
A30 193 could.<p/>
A30 194 <p_>State law requires that teachers wait five days after filing a 
A30 195 notice before they strike. That means classes in Belvidere will 
A30 196 start on schedule Thursday, but could be halted later. The next 
A30 197 talks will begin at 4 p.m. Friday.<p/>
A30 198 <p_>In a joint news release, Belvidere teachers and board members 
A30 199 said <quote_>"progress was made on several issues,"<quote/> but did 
A30 200 not outline the stumbling blocks.<p/>
A30 201 <p_>At Harlem, where talks resume at 9 a.m. today, teachers there 
A30 202 could strike Thursday, the day classes are scheduled to start. 
A30 203 Teachers there filed an intent-to-strike notice last week and said 
A30 204 they would strike without an agreement. The teachers are scheduled 
A30 205 to meet at 4 p.m. today to review the latest contract offer.<p/>
A30 206 <p_>Harlem Superintendent Don Parker said school leaders there are 
A30 207 working hard to reach an agreement.<p/>
A30 208 <p_><quote_>"If it's up to me, there will not be a strike,"<quote/> 
A30 209 Parker said yesterday. <quote_>"My intention is to keep meeting 
A30 210 Tuesday (today) until an agreement is reached."<quote/><p/>
A30 211 <p_>Parker declined to release details of the dispute, but said the 
A30 212 major holdup is money.<p/>
A30 213 <p_><quote_>"Our district does not have a lot of discretionary 
A30 214 money to negotiate with,"<quote/> Parker said, <quote_>"and I know 
A30 215 our board is intent on a balanced budget and keeping the financial 
A30 216 integrity of the district in tact. The board is pretty certain the 
A30 217 public is not apt to increase its tax rate for higher teacher 
A30 218 salaries."<quote/><p/>
A30 219 <p_>Both districts have been negotiating with federal mediators 
A30 220 after early sessions of contract talks failed to produce deals.<p/>
A30 221 <p_>Harlem, which last had a teacher strike in 1989, has about 
A30 222 5,000 students. Belvidere, which hasn't had a teacher strike since 
A30 223 1975, has about 4,850 students.<p/>
A30 224 <p_>But while the threat of strikes hovers over Belvidere and 
A30 225 Harlem, three other Rockford-area schools, DeKalb, Hononegah and 
A30 226 Rockton, are scheduled to start on schedule, even without contract 
A30 227 agreements.<p/>
A30 228 <p_>David Martin, superintendent of the Rockton district, said 
A30 229 teachers will be there in force on schedule.<p/>
A30 230 <p_><quote_>"We have good people on both sides, still talking, and 
A30 231 both have the best interests of the community in mind,"<quote/> he 
A30 232 said. <quote_>"We'll keep talking while school starts."<quote/><p/>

A31   6 <p_>Hurricane Andrew bore down on Miami this morning, its 145-mph 
A31   7 winds and 20-foot seas certain to deliver a vicious uppercut to the 
A31   8 most densely populated region in the state.<p/>
A31   9 <p_><quote_>"The hurricane of our nightmares,"<quote/> the 
A31  10 <tf_>Miami Herald<tf/> called it in a Sunday extra edition 
A31  11 headlined <quote_>"The Big One."<quote/><p/>
A31  12 <p_>Disaster planners could only hope that years of preparation 
A31  13 would save lives and property as the awesome magnitude of Andrew 
A31  14 became clear: Winds strong enough to lift a bus. Waves tall enough 
A31  15 to swallow buildings. A storm surge that, coming with high tide, 
A31  16 promised to lay waste to some of the priciest real estate on Earth. 
A31  17 The most powerful hurricane ever to hit South Florida.<p/>
A31  18 <p_>Near midnight, Metro-Dade police completed a final sweep of the 
A31  19 city, urging residents through loudspeakers to seek out emergency 
A31  20 shelters.<p/>
A31  21 <p_><quote_>"We'll help them as long as we can, but when we have to 
A31  22 get off the streets, they're on their own,"<quote/> said Fred 
A31  23 Taylor, director of the Metro-Dade police.<p/>
A31  24 <p_>All day and all night, the people of South Florida braced for 
A31  25 the worst.<p/>
A31  26 <p_>They fled in cars and planes and ships. They pounded plywood 
A31  27 over doors and windows. They filled sandbags, and then more 
A31  28 sandbags. Some panicked. Some prayed. A few got drunk.<p/>
A31  29 <p_>Panic buying hit grocery stores and home-supply stores, money 
A31  30 machines were emptied, and everywhere residents in their cars lined 
A31  31 up for gas and then headed north along the few major 
A31  32 thorough<?_>-<?/>fares out.<p/>
A31  33 <p_>Virtually all employers throughout the region closed down for 
A31  34 at least today while school officials quickly delayed the start of 
A31  35 classes.<p/>
A31  36 <p_>By mid-afternoon, Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a state of 
A31  37 emergency, calling for a mandatory evacuation of more than 
A31  38 1-million people from coastal areas of Broward, Dade and the 
A31  39 northern Florida Keys.<p/>
A31  40 <p_><quote_>"This is right now the strongest storm that has hit 
A31  41 Florida since 1935,"<quote/> Chiles said. <quote_>"It is stronger 
A31  42 at this stage than Hugo. The outlook for this is we can have major, 
A31  43 major property damage in South Florida.<p/>
A31  44 <p_>"Anybody that's thinking about riding this one out in an area 
A31  45 in which they've been told to evacuate is making a tragic 
A31  46 mistake,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A31  47 <p_>Officials expected 127,000 permanent residents and tourists to 
A31  48 flee the Keys, 350,000 to evacuate Dade County and 200,000 to leave 
A31  49 Broward County. Chiles said there was enough space in the local 
A31  50 shelters for Southeast Florida's evacuees, though there was some 
A31  51 misinformation about where to go. Many people went to Jackson 
A31  52 Memorial Hospital in Miami only to find out it was not a shelter. 
A31  53 And many shelters were filled by Sunday evening with people being 
A31  54 re<?_>-<?/>routed to others.<p/>
A31  55 <p_>By 12:30 a.m. today, 50,000 people were in Dade County 
A31  56 shelters, with room for another 20,000. In all, 179 shelters in 19 
A31  57 counties had been activated.<p/>
A31  58 <p_>Kate Hale, director of emergency management for Dade County, 
A31  59 said early today that the massive evacuation went smoothly, 
A31  60 although there was one glitch involving elderly and disabled 
A31  61 residents who needed special transportation to shelters.<p/>
A31  62 <p_>Plans called for the transportation to be provided by 50 school 
A31  63 buses. But only 19 buses were available Sunday because Dade County 
A31  64 officials couldn't find enough qualified drivers, Hale said.<p/>
A31  65 <p_>More than 2,000 people who had signed up in advance were bused 
A31  66 to shelters. But 50 to 100 elderly or disabled people who called 
A31  67 for rides after 7 p.m. Sunday were told no buses were available. 
A31  68 It's unclear how many of those people made it to safety.<p/>
A31  69 <p_><quote_>"I'm concerned that there were people out there who 
A31  70 needed help that we couldn't get to,"<quote/> Hale said.<p/>
A31  71 <p_>Broward Sheriff's officials complained through most of the day 
A31  72 that not enough people were going to the shelters. They feared that 
A31  73 too many people in evacuation zones were trying to ride out the 
A31  74 storm.<p/>
A31  75 <p_>At the Sheraton on the beach at Fort Lauderdale, 
A31  76 representatives from the Broward County Transit Authority pleaded 
A31  77 with guests to get on buses and go to emergency shelters. Refusal 
A31  78 was a second-degree misdemeanor.<p/>
A31  79 <p_><quote_>"Get an inflatable raft so you'll have something to 
A31  80 sleep on,"<quote/> bus driver Dennis Malone shouted to the guests. 
A31  81 <quote_>"There's no more water in the stores, so get some sodas. 
A31  82 And get some food, but nothing with mayonnaise. Maybe get some 
A31  83 peanuts. You'll need the protein."<quote/><p/>
A31  84 <p_>Malone's supervisor, Tom Schillo, said few guests heeded the 
A31  85 advice. <quote_>"We've only moved out 50 people, and we've been 
A31  86 here all day. We're trying to give helpful information to get 
A31  87 people out.<p/>
A31  88 <p_>"But we can't stay all night. If you're crazy enough to want to 
A31  89 stay here, I don't see why somebody should risk his life to get you 
A31  90 out."<quote/><p/>
A31  91 <p_>In Richmond Heights, more than 1,300 people crammed into an 
A31  92 evacuation center designed to hold 1,000. Food and medicine were 
A31  93 scarce, though there was a sudden turn for the better when Fred 
A31  94 Young, a local caterer, arrived at 10 p.m. with enough fried 
A31  95 chicken, baked chicken, chicken wings, yellow rice and corn to feed 
A31  96 500 people. It was all he had in the freezers, he said, after a 
A31  97 weekend of weddings. During the night, Young said, he and his staff 
A31  98 would make 1,000 sandwiches to bring to the shelter in the 
A31  99 morning.<p/>
A31 100 <p_>It was all a bit dizzying to two German tourists who wandered 
A31 101 in at about 11 p.m. Christa Behner and Gisela Hilgers of Cologne 
A31 102 had not heard the hurricane would be serious, so they went off 
A31 103 Sunday morning to Parrot Jungle, a tourist attraction near 
A31 104 Homestead. As they left Parrot Jungle, an attendant there sent them 
A31 105 to the emergency shelter. There, they said they wanted to go back 
A31 106 to their hotel on Miami Beach to get their passports. They were 
A31 107 gently told that Miami Beach had been completely off limits for 
A31 108 hours.<p/>
A31 109 <p_>The governor's executive order suspended all highway tolls 
A31 110 south of Orange County. Even so, traffic jams stretched for miles 
A31 111 while thousands of other fleeing residents headed for airports, 
A31 112 even as they were being closed.<p/>
A31 113 <p_>At the United Airlines ticket counter at Miami International 
A31 114 Airport, passengers were willing to pay virtually anything to get 
A31 115 out.<p/>
A31 116 <p_><quote_>"It was just a panic situation,"<quote/> said United 
A31 117 ticket agent James Pierce. <quote_>"You would ask them where they 
A31 118 wanted to go and they would say, 'Anywhere.' You could book them to 
A31 119 Hong Kong, Germany - anywhere."<quote/><p/>
A31 120 <p_>Travelers at other airlines reported waits of more than three 
A31 121 hours just so they could be told that no seats were available. Some 
A31 122 people rented cars and drove to Orlando or Tampa, while others used 
A31 123 their suitcases as makeshift cots on the terminal floor.<p/>
A31 124 <p_>By 11 p.m., Miami International was closed, with some 2,500 
A31 125 people stranded there for the night.<p/>
A31 126 <p_>At Fort Lauderdale International Airport, people were clamoring 
A31 127 to get on Continental Airlines' last flight of the day to Newark, 
A31 128 N.J.<p/>
A31 129 <p_><quote_>"We've seen hurricanes in New York, so we didn't want 
A31 130 to see one down here,"<quote/> said Ross Balkin, who with his wife, 
A31 131 Jodie, was headed home to Long Island.<p/>
A31 132 <p_>The airport was shutting down about 6 p.m. Sunday, said airport 
A31 133 spokesman Jim Reynolds. No stranded travelers would be allowed to 
A31 134 linger.<p/>
A31 135 <p_><quote_>"The highest place at the air<?_>-<?/>port is 12 feet 
A31 136 above sea level, and we're right next to Port Everglades, which is 
A31 137 a deep-water port,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"The airport is not a 
A31 138 safe place to be in a hurricane."<quote/><p/>
A31 139 <p_>Across the region, major institutions scrambled to prepare.<p/>
A31 140 <p_>Military and U.S. Customs air<?_>-<?/>craft based at Homestead 
A31 141 Air Force Base were being put in secure hangars or flown to safer 
A31 142 bases out of the storm area.<p/>
A31 143 <p_>State officials moved 1,120 prisoners out of facilities in 
A31 144 Dade, Collier and Monroe counties to points north.<p/>
A31 145 <p_>At Miami Metrozoo, keepers gathered up flamingos and put them 
A31 146 in the public restrooms.<p/>
A31 147 <p_>A Southern Bell spokesman said the phone company had 2,600 
A31 148 workers in South Florida and another 1,000 workers out of state 
A31 149 standing ready to repair phone lines.<p/>
A31 150 <p_>The <tf_>Miami Herald<tf/> delivered 50,000 free papers to the 
A31 151 evacuation shelters Sunday night. The paper did not plan to publish 
A31 152 a paper this morning.<p/>
A31 153 <p_><quote_>"We couldn't even get our papers out there if we wanted 
A31 154 to,"<quote/> said Arden Dickey, vice president for circulation.<p/>
A31 155 <p_>About 250 <tf|>Herald employees and family members were camped 
A31 156 out overnight in the paper's water<?_>-<?/>front building, designed 
A31 157 in 1963 to withstand 200-mph winds.<p/>
A31 158 <p_>Florida Power & Light's two nuclear reactors at Turkey Point 
A31 159 began going into a <quote_>"hot shutdown"<quote/> about 6 p.m. 
A31 160 Sunday, said spokesman Ray Golden. A hot shutdown lowers the 
A31 161 reactor temperature from 560 degrees to between 200 and 350 
A31 162 degrees. This is done to guard against the sudden loss of cooling 
A31 163 water and the resulting risk of meltdown from overheated 
A31 164 uranium.<p/>
A31 165 <p_>The plant, designed to withstand a 22-foot storm surge, did not 
A31 166 go to complete shutdown because that would delay restoration of 
A31 167 power after the storm by at least 36 hours, Golden said.<p/>
A31 168 <p_>The state's largest hospital, the aforementioned Jackson 
A31 169 Memorial in Miami, canceled all non<?_>-<?/>emergency surgery 
A31 170 Sunday.<p/>
A31 171 <p_>Officials at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach were looking for 
A31 172 <quote_>"alternative facilities"<quote/> for some of their 370 
A31 173 patients, but had no major evacuation plans.<p/>
A31 174 <p_>Some local hospitals were opening empty rooms to pregnant women 
A31 175 within three weeks of delivery. Officials warned on radio 
A31 176 broadcasts that the drastic change in barometric pressure has been 
A31 177 known to stimulate labor.<p/>
A31 178 <p_>Meanwhile, the National Guard sent a C-130 medical aircraft to 
A31 179 evacuate 24 patients from Fisherman's Hospital in Marathon in the 
A31 180 middle Florida Keys.<p/>
A31 181 <p_>Everywhere in South Florida on Sunday, life seemed an odd mix 
A31 182 of fear and excitement. This was, all were constantly reminded by 
A31 183 newscasters, <quote_>"the big one"<quote/> that has been talked 
A31 184 about for decades. But for many in this transient region, it was 
A31 185 also the first real hurricane they would face and there was 
A31 186 curiousity mixed in with the fear.<p/>
A31 187 <p_>Ramon Rosario, a cook at Wendy's and a would-be rap music star, 
A31 188 strolled along deserted Miami Beach listening to the latest 
A31 189 hurricane reports on a Walkman.<p/>
A31 190 <p_><quote_>"It ain't going to be what everybody is 
A31 191 expecting,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"I'm sticking 
A31 192 around."<quote/><p/>
A31 193 <p_>As a rapper, Rosario goes by the name Mo Chill. And that's how 
A31 194 he feels about Andrew: <quote_>"I just chill. Why worry about 
A31 195 it?"<quote/><p/>
A31 196 <p_>A few minutes earlier, the Miami Beach police had shooed him 
A31 197 away from the water and told him to leave the area. But Rosario, a 
A31 198 25-year-old New Yorker who has lived in Florida only one year, 
A31 199 planned to stay in his fifth-floor apartment a few blocks from the 
A31 200 ocean and ride it out.<p/>
A31 201 <p_><quote_>"I want to see this Andrew thing,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A31 202 <p_>Rosario was the exception. It appeared that most Miami Beach 
A31 203 residents had evacuated in plenty of time. At 5 p.m., the streets 
A31 204 were practically empty. At 7 p.m., police closed the bridges to the 
A31 205 beach.<p/>
A31 206 <p_>On Ocean Drive, facing the Atlantic Ocean, trendy night spots 
A31 207 and restaurants were boarded up, while homeless people wandered the 
A31 208 sidewalks panhandling the few people remaining on the deserted 
A31 209 streets. Others pushed shopping carts containing their few 
A31 210 belongings, or clung to plastic bags.<p/>
A31 211 <p_><quote_>"I can't imagine being here when the waves start 
A31 212 rolling in,"<quote/> Miami Beach firefighter Bob Sistik said as he 
A31 213 organized a group of seniors at a beachfront evacuation point. 
A31 214 <quote_>"This whole place will be under at least 10 feet of water. 
A31 215 Everybody on the Beach must go."<quote/><p/>
A31 216 <p_>Two tourists from Holland found themselves stranded on South 
A31 217 Beach, wondering how dangerous their situation was and what their 
A31 218 options were.<p/>
A31 219 <p_><quote_>"Where are we to go?,"<quote/> said Irma Kreike. 
A31 220 <quote_>"We have no place to go, do we? So we are just going to 
A31 221 stay here."<quote/><p/>
A31 222 <p_>They planned to stay in a $23-a-night first-floor room in an 
A31 223 old Art Deco-style hotel.<p/>
A31 224 <p_><quote_>"It won't come up to our door will it?"<quote/> said 
A31 225 Johan Mendes. <quote_>"How high could the water get?"<quote/><p/>
A31 226 <p_>Residents arriving at the luxurious Fountainbleau Hotel, 
A31 227 expecting to spend the night in a $175-suite, were herded back onto 
A31 228 chartered buses and taken to inland hotels.<p/>
A31 229 <p_>Just down the beach, Chris Woods and two friends weren't 
A31 230 worrying about the approaching storm.

A32   4 <p_><quote_>"The buckthorn stops here,"<quote/> is the slogan 
A32   5 adopted by the North Branch Prairie Project to celebrate its 15th 
A32   6 anniversary next month.<p/>
A32   7 <p_>Buckthorn, an invasive, European weed that kills native plants 
A32   8 with its shade, is one of the banes of prairie restoration, but 
A32   9 North Branch volunteers have battled it and other take-over plants 
A32  10 for years with matches and machetes.<p/>
A32  11 <p_>Now purple blazing stars, lavender monarda and legions of 
A32  12 goldenrods light up the nine prairie patches managed by the group 
A32  13 along the North Branch of the Chicago River.<p/>
A32  14 <p_>And in their seasons, according to their sites, pink shooting 
A32  15 stars, vibrant orange butterfly weeds, purple prairie clover, 
A32  16 columbines, pink-lavender Joe-Pye weeds and asters, white lady's 
A32  17 slippers and ladies' tresses orchids, gentians, false indigos, 
A32  18 golden hoary puccoons and purple milkweeds bloom in abundance.<p/>
A32  19 <p_><quote_>"We've learned you don't need a fancy degree to play an 
A32  20 important role in ecological restoration,"<quote/> said Steve 
A32  21 Packard, a founding member of the project and director of science 
A32  22 and stewardship for the Nature Conservancy of Illinois.<p/>
A32  23 <p_><quote_>"We have carpenters, nurses, computer programmers, 
A32  24 pharmacists, architects, lawyers and all kinds of people"<quote/> 
A32  25 volunteering, he said. Last year 1,200 individuals logged 3,700 
A32  26 hours working on the North Branch prairies.<p/>
A32  27 <p_><quote_>"They know more stuff now than most trained 
A32  28 biologists,"<quote/> he added.<p/>
A32  29 <p_>It began 15 years ago when a few bicyclists using the bike 
A32  30 paths in Morton Grove asked, <quote_>"Gosh, what are those 
A32  31 plants?"<quote/> said Karen Holland, a volunteer and editor of the 
A32  32 group's newsletter.<p/>
A32  33 <p_>On the cyclists' next outing, the plants - probably something 
A32  34 showy like blazing stars or cone flowers - had been mowed down. The 
A32  35 cyclists contacted the Cook County Forest Preserve District with 
A32  36 the idea of saving remnants of Illinois prairie with volunteer 
A32  37 labor.<p/>
A32  38 <p_>The idea took.<p/>
A32  39 <p_>From the first project at Wayside Woods Prairie the effort has 
A32  40 expanded to nine natural areas, the largest being the 200-acre 
A32  41 Somes Prairie and Groves in Northbrook, the smallest, Morton Grove 
A32  42 Prairie, a 1.2-acre virgin tract.<p/>
A32  43 <p_>Within Chicago city limits are Sauganash Prairie Grove, 25 
A32  44 acres, and Edgebrook Flatwoods/Bunker Hill Prairie, 86 acres.<p/>
A32  45 <p_>But a funny thing happened on the way to restoring the prairie 
A32  46 - the volunteers realized that the grasslands studded with oak 
A32  47 trees that they encountered were not prairies, but their own 
A32  48 ecosystems - savannas.<p/>
A32  49 <p_>Prairies are now defined as grass<?_>-<?/>lands with forbs 
A32  50 (wildflowers) in full sun with no trees. Savannas are 
A32  51 grass<?_>-<?/>lands with oak canopies of up to 50 percent and 
A32  52 woodlands have more than 50 percent canopy cover, said Laurel Ross, 
A32  53 Northern Illinois field representative for the Nature 
A32  54 Conservancy.<p/>
A32  55 <p_>The wild prairie seeds that the volunteers had labored to 
A32  56 collect (51 garbage bags full last year alone) would not take when 
A32  57 thrown in the partial shade of the savannas. But some other plants 
A32  58 - thistles, cream gentians, yellow pimpernels, bottle<?_>-<?/>grass 
A32  59 and mullein foxglove - popped up when the land was cleared of 
A32  60 foreign brush.<p/>
A32  61 <p_>By consulting old settlers records Packard gradually realized 
A32  62 that the upstart plants were the natives of the <quote_>"Illinois 
A32  63 barrens,"<quote/> the name settlers gave to the savannas.<p/>
A32  64 <p_><quote_>"I guess the most important thing we learned was what 
A32  65 happened when you got to the edge of the trees,"<quote/> said 
A32  66 Packard. <quote_>"We used to burn the prairies but not the woods, 
A32  67 because people have this Smokey Bear sense of protecting the woods 
A32  68 from fire.<p/>
A32  69 <p_>"But in the Midwest, burning was as much a part of the woods as 
A32  70 the prairie."<quote/> Thick, corky bark protected the burr oaks and 
A32  71 other trees from the prairie fires that scoured the landscape of 
A32  72 woody brush and fertilized it with ashes.<p/>
A32  73 <p_>These fires were originally set by lightning or Indians. Now, 
A32  74 controlled burns are the restorers' primary tool, but they have 
A32  75 other tricks. More than 100 amateurs grow prairie plants in home 
A32  76 gardens and donate the seeds.<p/>
A32  77 <p_>People were always a part of the prairie as predators or 
A32  78 cultivators, Packard said.<p/>
A32  79 <p_><quote_>"Nature needs people to care for it. Most Indian 
A32  80 [tribe] names mean the 'true people of this place.' The volunteer 
A32  81 stewards are becoming the true people of the nature 
A32  82 preserves,"<quote/> said Packard.<p/>

A32  84 <h_><p_>Robinson Defiant at Sentencing<p/>
A32  85 <p_>By Rosalind Rossi<p/>
A32  86 <p_>Federal Building Reporter<p/><h/>
A32  87 <p_>Even in defeat, he was defiant.<p/>
A32  88 <p_>Chicago businessman Noah Robinson raised a clenched fist in a 
A32  89 sign of power Friday, after he was ordered to spend the rest of his 
A32  90 life in prison and assessed a $6 million fine on racketeering 
A32  91 charges.<p/>
A32  92 <p_>U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen also ordered maximum 
A32  93 sentences for Robinson on five other counts - one of them a second 
A32  94 life sentence.<p/>
A32  95 <p_>After three prosecutions since 1989, Friday's sentence ensures 
A32  96 that Robinson <quote_>"will never get out of prison,"<quote/> said 
A32  97 Assistant U.S. Attorney William Hogan Jr. The mandatory term of 
A32  98 life without parole came on charges that Robinson used El Rukn gang 
A32  99 members as hit men and partners in the heroin trade.<p/>
A32 100 <p_>Robinson, 48 and the father of eight, was among 65 El Rukns and 
A32 101 their associates to be indicted in 1989 and among the three most 
A32 102 dangerous defendants, Hogan said. Robinson kept a poster of 'The 
A32 103 Godfather' in his Chicago office and dreamed of becoming the 
A32 104 moblike <quote|>"don" of his own Rukn <quote_>"army of 
A32 105 killers,"<quote/> Hogan said.<p/>
A32 106 <p_><quote_>"He could have been the greatest example,"<quote/> 
A32 107 Hogan said of Robinson, who has a master's degree from the Wharton 
A32 108 School. <quote_>"The tragedy is that he's the worst 
A32 109 possible."<quote/><p/>
A32 110 <p_>Hogan and co-prosecutors Ross Silverman and John Hartmann said 
A32 111 Robinson was responsible for the gang's <quote_>"turning 
A32 112 point"<quote/> in 1983, when he directed it to high<?_>-<?/>volume 
A32 113 heroin and cocaine dealers to raise bond money for jailed leader 
A32 114 Jeff Fort. The connections catapulted Robinson into a 
A32 115 multi-million-dollar partnership with Fort, Hogan said.<p/>
A32 116 <p_>Fort's former brother-in-law, <quote|>"General" Henry Harris, 
A32 117 described at the trial how Robinson jumped up from his chair and 
A32 118 squealed with delight when his $333,000 cut of a $1 million heroin 
A32 119 deal was dumped on his office desk in 1985.<p/>
A32 120 <p_>Robinson also encouraged the gang to <quote_>"let down their 
A32 121 braids"<quote/> and venture into legitimate businesses as avenues 
A32 122 of drug laundering, <quote|>"General" Eugene Hunter testified. 
A32 123 Hunter said Fort chose him to become the first El Rukn millionaire, 
A32 124 and ordered him to learn the fine points of business from 
A32 125 Robinson.<p/>
A32 126 <p_>There also was a violent side to Robinson, Hogan said.<p/>
A32 127 <p_>He used El Rukn hit men to kill a troublesome former employee 
A32 128 and to try to kill a former business partner, the prosecution 
A32 129 said.<p/>
A32 130 <p_>In addition, evidence indicated, he hired a longtime friend to 
A32 131 slit the throat of a South Carolina grand jury witness against him. 
A32 132 The witness, a woman, was stabbed six times but not killed.<p/>
A32 133 <p_>Robinson is serving a six-year prison term for skimming 
A32 134 $650,000 from six South Side Wendy's restaurants and a consecutive 
A32 135 10-year sentence for his role in the plot to kill the grand jury 
A32 136 witness.<p/>
A32 137 <p_>Friday's $6 million fine, imposed in case Robinson has a secret 
A32 138 cache of drug profits, is in addition to a $600,000 fine in the 
A32 139 Wendy's case and a $43,000 fine imposed for violating a court order 
A32 140 by writing 43 of his own motions in his racketeering case.<p/>
A32 141 <p_>Robinson resorted to writing even Friday. Rather than 
A32 142 addressing Aspen, he filed a 13-page typed statement, complete with 
A32 143 legal citations, exclamation marks and numerous passages underlined 
A32 144 for emphasis.<p/>
A32 145 <p_>Previously, the Robinson likened himself in writing to South 
A32 146 African leader Nelson Mandela and said he was the victim of a 
A32 147 political and racist conspiracy.<p/>
A32 148 <p_><quote_>"Mr. Robinson is not a  victim of the political 
A32 149 apparatus,"<quote/> Aspen said in ordering a sentence that will not 
A32 150 be imposed until a post-trial motion on a companion El Rukn case is 
A32 151 resolved. <quote_>"He is a victim of himself."<quote/><p/>

A32 153 <h_><p_>Hurt Drunken Drivers Rarely Ticketed: Panel<p/>
A32 154 <p_>By Gary Wisby<p/>
A32 155 <p_>Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A32 156 <p_>Drunken but injured drivers rarely are ticketed for drunken 
A32 157 driving, panelists said Saturday at a meeting of the Alliance 
A32 158 Against Intoxicated Motorists.<p/>
A32 159 <p_>Dr. Richard J. Fantus, director of trauma services at Illinois 
A32 160 Masonic Medical Center in Chicago, said a study showed that only 7 
A32 161 percent of intoxicated drivers treated there were charged.<p/>
A32 162 <p_><quote_>"We are tired of seeing these people coming in after 
A32 163 killing other people, without being able to do anything about 
A32 164 it,"<quote/> Fantus said.<p/>
A32 165 <p_>Even more dramatic data were noted in preliminary results of a 
A32 166 study being done by Northwestern University's Traffic Institute.<p/>
A32 167 <p_>Researcher Roy E. Lucke said medical records of 660 injured 
A32 168 drivers treated at two suburban trauma centers were compared with 
A32 169 police crash reports. As in the Illinois Masonic study, nearly half 
A32 170 were drunk but only 2 percent were ticketed for driving under the 
A32 171 influence, he said.<p/>
A32 172 <p_>The panelists spoke at a meeting in a Schaumburg hotel marking 
A32 173 AAIM's 10th anniversary. They blamed:<p/>
A32 174 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Lack of cooperation by hospitals. One reason is 
A32 175 that emergency rooms often are too crowded for police officers 
A32 176 <quote_>"to get anywhere near the patient,"<quote/> Fantus said. He 
A32 177 said staffers are more concerned about treating patients than 
A32 178 collecting evidence.<p/>
A32 179 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Time constraints. Police frequently don't reach a 
A32 180 crash scene until the driver already has been taken to a hospital, 
A32 181 Lucke said. They gather information by phone without ever seeing 
A32 182 the offender, he said. A former volunteer paramedic, the NU 
A32 183 researcher said he had heard many drunken drivers plead, 
A32 184 <quote_>"I'm injured. Get me to the hospital before the cops get 
A32 185 here."<quote/><p/>
A32 186 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Sympathy. <quote_>"Especially with single-vehicle 
A32 187 crashes ... the officer says, 'This one has got enough troubles. 
A32 188 I've got other things to do, and I'm going to go do them,'"<quote/> 
A32 189 Lucke said.<p/>
A32 190 <p_>Fantus called for legislation requiring medical personnel to 
A32 191 report DUI cases, just as they must notify authorities of child 
A32 192 abuse. The law also could mandate alcohol testing of all injured 
A32 193 drivers.<p/>
A32 194 <p_>Reached after the meeting, Skokic attorney Larry A. Davis said 
A32 195 a 1988 law already specifies that hospital blood tests, the most 
A32 196 accurate indicator, may be used in DUI prosecutions.<p/>
A32 197 <p_>And legislation effective last year says DUI testing can be 
A32 198 required of people who are hurt in crashes.<p/>

A32 201 Charity<p/>

A32 203 <p_>Staff Writer<p/><h/>
A32 204 <p_>Jennifer Jurges knows how to pick a single man: by his 
A32 205 shoes.<p/>
A32 206 <p_>The 26-year-old Tinley Park woman Friday night threw her left 
A32 207 sandal (from a Greenwich Village shop) into a pile of shoes on the 
A32 208 floor of the China Club, 616 W. Fulton, drew out a shiny-black 
A32 209 man's shoe, then held it aloft waiting for the owner to claim 
A32 210 it.<p/>
A32 211 <p_>Jurges' approach?<p/>
A32 212 <p_><quote_>"It looked like a businessman's shoe - well polished, 
A32 213 black, kind of like a wingtip"<quote/> but not as busy, Jurges 
A32 214 said.<p/>
A32 215 <p_>The shoe-matching game was one of many ways in which singles 
A32 216 could meet at the fourth annual All That Zazz Bash for singles 
A32 217 sponsored by Sun-Times advice columnist Jeffrey Zaslow.<p/>
A32 218 <p_>Jurges guessed right: The black shoe belonged to Dana Marzillo, 
A32 219 30, of Palatine, whom she described as <quote_>"cute and well 
A32 220 dressed"<quote/> and with whom she carried on an animated 
A32 221 conversation for some time.<p/>
A32 222 <p_>With a big smile, Marzillo said, <quote_>"We're eloping 
A32 223 tonight,"<quote/> then decided he wanted to know more about Jurges. 
A32 224 <quote_>"Let me see your notes,"<quote/> he said to a reporter.<p/>
A32 225 <p_>The party was a benefit for the Chicago Sun-Times Charity 
A32 226 Trust.<p/>
A32 227 <p_><quote_>"It's a congenial crowd,"<quote/> said North Sider 
A32 228 Diana, 41. <quote_>"There are a lot of nice people here."<quote/> 
A32 229 Earlier, she said friends <quote|>"dragged" her to the party 
A32 230 because it was <quote_>"time to get out"<quote/> after breaking up 
A32 231 a relationship.<p/>
A32 232 <p_>Other events included a dance contest and a competition seeking 
A32 233 the best flirting methods.<p/>
A32 234 <p_><quote_>"Faint. It's very effective,"<quote/> advised John 
A32 235 Panozzo, 44, of Tinley Park, who won a compact disc for his 
A32 236 answer.<p/>
A32 237 <p_><quote_>"The men who come here are here to meet women, and they 
A32 238 are ready for a relationship, marriage, kids,"<quote/> said Jodi, 
A32 239 36, of the North Side.<p/>
A32 240 <p_>Activities continue today at Zazz's Singles Symposium, at the 
A32 241 Hyatt Regency Hotel, 151 E. Wacker, which will include talks titled 
A32 242 <quote_>"Sexual Etiquette in the '90s,"<quote/> <quote_>"Cold Feet

A33   1 <#FROWN:A33\><h_><p_>Upping the Pressure On Serbian Aggression<p/>
A33   2 <p_>The U.N., the E.C. and the Orthodox Church condemn Belgrade's 
A33   3 war<p/><h/>
A33   4 <p_>FINALLY, IMPELLED BY SCENES OF CIVILIAN slaughter in Sarajevo, 
A33   5 the U.S. and its European allies went to work last week to impose 
A33   6 economic sanctions on Serbia. The Serbs, who fill the ranks of both 
A33   7 regular and irregular forces, are now seen as the main aggressors 
A33   8 in the war in the ruins of Yugoslavia.<p/>
A33   9 <p_>Though the Serbs make up only a third of the population of 
A33  10 Bosnia-Herzegovina, they are, says U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia 
A33  11 Warren Zimmermann, <quote_>"trying to take over two-thirds of the 
A33  12 country."<quote/> In their campaign to carve out a Greater Serbia 
A33  13 and expel Croats and Slavic Muslims, the Serbs have created 
A33  14 hundreds of thousands of refugees; Serbs have been pushed out by 
A33  15 Croats and Muslims in response. U.N. Secretary-General Boutros 
A33  16 Boutros-Ghali said, in a report to the Security Council, it was the 
A33  17 largest uprooting of population <quote_>"in Europe since the Second 
A33  18 World War."<quote/><p/>
A33  19 <p_>In Brussels, the European Community imposed economic sanctions 
A33  20 at midweek. The Serbian Orthodox Church said it was <quote_>"openly 
A33  21 distancing itself"<quote/> from the government. Then came the 
A33  22 revolting images of death in Sarajevo's marketplace, and the U.S., 
A33  23 Britain and France pressed the U.N. Security Council to impose 
A33  24 full, mandatory sanctions. <quote_>"Diplomacy and persuasion have 
A33  25 been used for some time and they now need the reinforcement of 
A33  26 sanctions,"<quote/> said British Prime Minister John Major.<p/>
A33  27 <p_>Russia and China, who are permanent members of the Council, and 
A33  28 among Yugoslavia's main suppliers of oil, had been reluctant to go 
A33  29 along with the sanctions plan. Its measures range from a complete 
A33  30 trade embargo, including oil shipments, to cutting air links and 
A33  31 freezing Serbian assets abroad. After quiet negotiations, the 
A33  32 Security Council passed the resolution Saturday. Even so, no one 
A33  33 was predicting that Serbia and its hard-nosed President Slobodan 
A33  34 Milosevic would quickly move to end the bloodshed.<p/>

A33  36 <h_><p_>Fresh Faces,<p/>
A33  37 <p_>Fresh Starts?<p/>
A33  38 <p_>Austria and Italy choose leaders to restore prestige at home 
A33  39 and abroad<p/><h/>
A33  40 <p_>STUCK IN POLITICAL QUAGMIRES, TWO EUROPEAN neighbors hope their 
A33  41 new Presidents will not stand on ceremony but pull them out of 
A33  42 trouble. Thomas Klestil, 59, of the conservative Austrian People's 
A33  43 Party, upset the ruling Social Democratic Party's candidate in a 
A33  44 runoff election last weekend. Klestil won the presidency by the 
A33  45 largest margin in 40 years. Key to that victory was support from 
A33  46 far-right voters whose own candidate had been eliminated. Klestil, 
A33  47 a former envoy to Washington, played down the swing vote, mindful 
A33  48 of the task ahead: repairing Austria's international standing after 
A33  49 the stigma of Kurt Waldheim's presidency.<p/>
A33  50 <p_>In Italy a death was needed to produce a President, nearly two 
A33  51 months after inconclusive general eclections. The funeral for top 
A33  52 Mafia fighter Giovanni Falcone, assassinated by a bomb blast, 
A33  53 became a protest over the delay in forming a government when 
A33  54 mourners chanted insults at visiting party bosses. Shaken, the 
A33  55 bosses picked Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, 73, the Christian Democratic 
A33  56 Speaker of the lower house of Parliament, to succeed Francesco 
A33  57 Cossiga. Scalfaro must now tackle the same Mafia terror to which he 
A33  58 owes his election.<p/>

A33  60 <h_><p_>The Most Amazing Show Trial Ever<p/>
A33  61 <p_>In an explosive court case, Russia will put the communist Party 
A33  62 in the dock<p/><h/>
A33  63 <p_>THE APOTHEOSIS OF TOTALITARIANISM; THE Communist Party of the 
A33  64 Soviet Union, will be remembered by Russians for replacing czarist 
A33  65 repression with wholesale slaughter by the Commissars: tens of 
A33  66 millions perished in a welter of purges, deportations and terror. 
A33  67 So it comes as a delicious irony reminiscent of the regime's 
A33  68 infamous show trials that communist orthodoxy has itself become the 
A33  69 target of an inquisition. To complete the party's fall, the Russian 
A33  70 government announced it will argue before the nation's highest 
A33  71 court that the C.P.S.U. was not actually a political entity but a 
A33  72 criminal organization. The aim, says Sergei Shakhrai, leader of 
A33  73 Boris Yeltsin's legal team, is to turn the hearing into 
A33  74 <quote_>"the second Nuremberg trial of this century."<quote/><p/>
A33  75 <p_>While the proceedings are more morality play than criminal 
A33  76 inquest, the evidence could prove incendiary. The government has 
A33  77 promised to release a <quote_>"special dossier"<quote/> dating back 
A33  78 to 1917 that contains some of the C.P.S.U.'s most closely guarded 
A33  79 secrets. One tantalizing sample unveiled by Shakhrai: a 1975 KGB 
A33  80 directive to provide arms to a Palestinian terrorist organization 
A33  81 for <quote_>"operations against American and Israeli personnel in 
A33  82 third countries."<quote/><p/>
A33  83 <p_>Whether the trial can exorcise the demons of the past and 
A33  84 forever bar communists from power, as the government seems to hope, 
A33  85 the hearing will be of little help in enabling Yeltsin to extract 
A33  86 his nation from its present economic tailspin. A trip through 
A33  87 Siberia offered a glimpse of the toll this struggle has taken on 
A33  88 the President: barely a year into his tenure, Yeltsin announced to 
A33  89 a group of cheering workers that he would not be seeking 
A33  90 re-election for a second term. It was unclear whether the crowd's 
A33  91 enthusiasm had more to do with the President's plans or with the 
A33  92 cargo plane that accompanied him: it carried 500 million rubles for 
A33  93 unpaid wages.<p/>
A33  94 
A33  95 <h_><p_>The Generals Continue To Hold On<p/>
A33  96 <p_>Thailand's military loses a battle but is not ready to 
A33  97 retreat<p/><h/>
A33  98 <p_>THE THOUSANDS OF THAIS WHO TOOK TO THE streets in the name of 
A33  99 democracy last month had two objectives: to force the resignation 
A33 100 of an unelected army officer as Prime Minister and, more broadly, 
A33 101 to end the military's dominance of politics. After great bloodshed, 
A33 102 the demonstrators won on the first score when Suchinda Kraprayoon 
A33 103 stepped down from the premiership. The official count of those 
A33 104 killed when troops opened fire on protesters stands at 53, but an 
A33 105 Interior Ministry spokesman said last week that more than 500 
A33 106 people are still unaccounted for.<p/>
A33 107 <p_>Parliament met the day after Suchinda went into hiding, and it 
A33 108 quickly approved a constitutional amendment requiring future Prime 
A33 109 Ministers to be elected members of the national legislature. 
A33 110 Another provision would limit the powers of the military-controlled 
A33 111 Senate. Final action on the constitutional reforms will be taken 
A33 112 next week. Still, the goal of breaking the military's grip on 
A33 113 political life is not yet within reach. The leading candidate to 
A33 114 succeed Suchinda as Prime Minister is Somboon Rahong, a member of 
A33 115 parliament but also a former air force officer and therefore 
A33 116 unacceptable to the opposition. They warned that his appointment 
A33 117 would set off more street demonstrations, and offered New 
A33 118 Aspiration Party leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh as an alternative. 
A33 119 Another potential flash point is the last-minute amnesty Suchinda 
A33 120 handed himself and his military cronies, a step many Thais believe 
A33 121 is illegal.<p/>

A33 123 <h_><p_>Sibling Warfare Before The Rio Summit<p/>
A33 124 <p_>Brazil's President is accused by his brother of involvement in 
A33 125 corruption<p/><h/>
A33 126 <p_>ASK ANY OLDER CHILD: A YOUNGER SIBLING JUST loves to mess up a 
A33 127 big event. As President Fernando Collor de Mello was preparing to 
A33 128 welcome 100 heads of state to the Earth Summit in Rio, charges 
A33 129 erupted in Brazil's press that he was involved with cocaine and 
A33 130 corruption. The source of the mudslinging was none other than his 
A33 131 younger brother Pedro, 39, who accused the President of using Paulo 
A33 132 C<*_>e-acute<*/>sar Farias, the treasurer of his 1989 election 
A33 133 campaign, as a front man for various illicit activities.<p/>
A33 134 <p_>Farias, said Pedro, has built a multimillion-dollar empire 
A33 135 through kickbacks for government contracts that were arranged with 
A33 136 help from the Chief Executive. One of the President's rewards, his 
A33 137 sibling said, was a $2.7 million apartment in Paris. Pedro Mello 
A33 138 (he uses his father's surname, while Fernando uses that of his 
A33 139 mother) also claimed that his older brother had 'induced' him to 
A33 140 use cocaine back in the 1960s. The President, 42, told Brazilians 
A33 141 on national television that the charges were false, that he had 
A33 142 ordered a police investigation, and that he would sue his brother 
A33 143 for libel. The Congress appointed a commission of inquiry - but 
A33 144 only to look into charges of wrongdoing against Farias.<p/>
A33 145 <p_>Even before the allegations against Collor were published, his 
A33 146 mother Leda had dismissed Pedro, her youngest son, as head of the 
A33 147 family business, a media group based in the northeastern state of 
A33 148 Alagoas. She claimed that he was suffering from emotional problems. 
A33 149 Mello took psychiatric tests to prove that he was sane. Later he 
A33 150 admitted that he had no direct proof of his brother's corruption 
A33 151 and backed away from his original accusations - at his mother's 
A33 152 behest, he said. <quote_>"Mama put it this way: Family is 
A33 153 family."<quote/><p/>

A33 156 <p_>More than 50 die in a Colombian push against leftist 
A33 157 insurgents<p/><h/>
A33 158 <p_>ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL LUIS EDUARDO ROCA had had enough. 
A33 159 Colombia's leftist guerrillas, angry because the government had cut 
A33 160 off peace talks in Mexico, were on a terror spree, overrunning nine 
A33 161 villages across the country, adding 12 people to the 250 they 
A33 162 already held hostage and dynamiting the country's most important 
A33 163 oil pipeline four times. In response, Roca launched the most 
A33 164 comprehensive effort yet to win a military victory in Colombia's 
A33 165 36-year-old war against a variety of insurgents. At week's end, 
A33 166 more than 50 people, including 19 soldiers, had died in rural 
A33 167 battles between 1,400 U.S.-trained government troops and fighters 
A33 168 of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) and the National 
A33 169 Liberation Army (E.L.N). By one report, FARC's longtime leader, 
A33 170 Manuel Marulanda, 58, had fled to Peru.<p/>

A33 172 <h_><p_>The Republicans Battle over Abortion<p/>
A33 173 <p_>The party platform will not find room for pro-lifers<p/><h/>
A33 174 <p_>SEPARATED BY A BROAD AVENUE AND A SCORE OF cops, two knots of 
A33 175 demonstrators in Salt Lake City, Utah, debated the abortion issue 
A33 176 with chants and placards. <quote_>THE TIME TO CHOOSE IS BEFORE 
A33 177 BEDTIME<quote/>, advised a pro-lifer sign. <quote_>PARTY PLATFORM: 
A33 178 OUT OF BOARD<?_>-<?/>ROOMS, INTO WOMEN'S WOMBS<quote/> took the 
A33 179 originality prize among the pro-choicers. Ann Stone, a conservative 
A33 180 who usually supports the President, elicited smiles on both sides 
A33 181 of West Temple Street when she cracked, <quote_>"George Bush knows 
A33 182 there are pro-choice Republicans; he's married to one!"<quote/><p/>
A33 183 <p_>There was no good humour indoors at the official proceedings 
A33 184 last week, as the Republican Platform Committee staged its hearing 
A33 185 on social questions. Since 1980 the platform has taken a hard line 
A33 186 against abortion. Now, with the U.S. Supreme Court poised to 
A33 187 undermine or demolish a woman's right to an abortion, many 
A33 188 Republicans want the party to moderate its stance. Stone, a 
A33 189 direct-mail entrepreneur who has raised millions for conservative 
A33 190 causes, is collecting money for pro-choice candidates.<p/>
A33 191 <p_>She told the platform drafters that a party opposed to 
A33 192 government intrusion into other sectors of society has no business 
A33 193 promoting antiabortion legislation. <quote_>"Are you all 
A33 194 Republicans?"<quote/> she demanded rhetorically. <quote_>"I'm not 
A33 195 clear on that."<quote/> Mary Dent Crisp, a moderate who once served 
A33 196 as the party's co<?_>-<?/>chair, warned of wholesale defections at 
A33 197 the polls: <quote_>"A woman's fundamental right to choose is far 
A33 198 more important than party loyalty."<quote/><p/>
A33 199 <p_>While the rebellion by Stone, Crisp and others captured media 
A33 200 attention, their opponents held the high cards. Phyllis Schlafly, 
A33 201 head of the Republican National Coalition for Life, insisted that 
A33 202 neither Bush as a candidate nor the party as an institution could 
A33 203 afford to waffle <quote_>"on a high moral principle."<quote/> The 
A33 204 Bush campaign's representatives at the session quietly agreed. 
A33 205 Campaign officials, who control the platform, will permit no 
A33 206 compromise language and will probably be able to quash efforts to 
A33 207 debate the issue at the Houston convention. A representative of the 
A33 208 National Abortion Rights Action League murmured, <quote_>"This is 
A33 209 an exercise in futility."<quote/><p/>
A33 210 <p_>But from Bush's viewpoint, the exercise is also painful. While 
A33 211 his stance mollifies the moral conservatives whose support he must 
A33 212 have in the November election, it offends moderates whose votes he 
A33 213 would love to claim too. The House of Representatives gave him 
A33 214 another headache by voting, 260 to 148, to overturn the 
A33 215 Administration's ban on the use of fetal tissue obtained from 
A33 216 planned abortions for medical research. The restriction had been 
A33 217 imposed in response to pro-lifers' contention that use of such 
A33 218 tissue increases the number of abortions. Bush promises a veto, 
A33 219 which will amost certinly stick. His bona fides with his party's 
A33 220 far-right wing will be strengthened, but so will the argument that 
A33 221 he is a prisoner of a minority faction.<p/>

A34   2 <p_>Taxpayers' tab may top $100 billion<p/>
A34   3 <p_>FROM EXAMINER STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS<p/><h/>
A34   4 <p_>Despite record profits this year, the banking system is still 
A34   5 in trouble and almost certainly will require a taxpayer bailout 
A34   6 that could exceed $100 billion, according to a new study.<p/>
A34   7 <p_><quote_>"America now has two banking industries. One is strong, 
A34   8 profitable and internationally competitive. The other is 
A34   9 dying,"<quote/> wrote economists Roger J. Vaughan, a Santa Fe, 
A34  10 N.M., consultant, and Edward W. Hill, a professor at Cleveland 
A34  11 State University.<p/>
A34  12 <p_>In 'Banking on the Brink: The Troubled Future of American 
A34  13 Finance,' the economists estimate that out of 12,000 U.S. banks 
A34  14 with $3.4 trillion in assets, 1,500 banks with $1 trillion in 
A34  15 assets <quote_>"are in deep trouble."<quote/><p/>
A34  16 <p_>Among the lenders it labeled <quote_>"Crippled Giants"<quote/> 
A34  17 were Wells Fargo & Co. and Security Pacific Corp. Both, according 
A34  18 to the study, began the year with <quote_>"severe shortages of 
A34  19 capital"<quote/> and could have a difficult time meeting tougher 
A34  20 equity standards, given the weak California real estate market. 
A34  21 (Los Angeles-based Security Pacific was merged into BankAmerica 
A34  22 Corp. earlier this year.)<p/>
A34  23 <p_>At Wells, officials took issue with the report's findings and 
A34  24 methods. <quote_>"This is the kind of superficial analysis that 
A34  25 people have been doing for years,"<quote/> said Wells' investor 
A34  26 relations director, Leslie Altick. <quote_>"They're giving a 
A34  27 broad<?_>-<?/>brush analysis of the market that we think is 
A34  28 wrong."<quote/><p/>
A34  29 <p_>She said because the study was based on 1991 year-end figures, 
A34  30 it was out of date and misleading. <quote_>"We have been adding 
A34  31 substantially to our capital ratios and are 
A34  32 well-capitalized"<quote/> by regulatory standards.<p/>
A34  33 <p_>The authors of the <quote_>"briefing book"<quote/> went on to 
A34  34 say that of the 1,500 <quote|>"troubled" banks, 1,150 were 
A34  35 <quote_>"now insolvent - and would be shuttered if their books 
A34  36 revealed the true value of their assets."<quote/><p/>
A34  37 <p_>Although extremely low interest rates - probably a temporary 
A34  38 phenomenon - have boosted industry profits this year, the 
A34  39 underlying deterioration in banks' commercial real estate loans 
A34  40 remains, they said.<p/>
A34  41 <p_>If regulators immediately close weak banks, the cost to the 
A34  42 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would range from $45 billion to $59 
A34  43 billion, they said. But if, as they expect, the closure of weak 
A34  44 banks is delayed, the cost to the FDIC will range from $75 billion 
A34  45 to $95 billion, according to the study.<p/>
A34  46 <p_>That would swamp the banking industry's ability to repay the 
A34  47 FDIC's federally backed borrowing and <quote_>"means some form of 
A34  48 taxpayer bailout for the bank insurance system is virtually 
A34  49 certain,"<quote/> the authors said.<p/>
A34  50 <p_>Vaughan and Hill's estimate of FDIC losses is the highest yet. 
A34  51 Several private economists have put the losses in the $50 billion 
A34  52 range. The FDIC projects costs of $39 billion to $48 billion, while 
A34  53 the White House Office of Management and Budget predicts a $72 
A34  54 billion cost.<p/>
A34  55 <p_>Bankers, who have been fighting higher FDIC insurance premiums, 
A34  56 have much lower estimates. Analyst Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va., a 
A34  57 consultant to the Association of Bank Holding Companies, projects 
A34  58 FDIC costs at $15 billion to $20 billion.<p/>
A34  59 <p_>At the crux of the disagreement is whether loans should be on 
A34  60 the banks' books at current market value or at their original 
A34  61 value. In California, for instance, where real estate values have 
A34  62 tumbled, a loan originally worth $500,000 might only be worth 
A34  63 $400,000 now.<p/>
A34  64 <p_>Banks such as Wells do write down the value of loans but only 
A34  65 when the lender doubts the borrower's ability to repay, not based 
A34  66 on general real estate market conditions.<p/>

A34  69 <p_>Investors hungry for good stock buys<p/>
A34  70 <p_>By Kathleen Sullivan<p/>
A34  71 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A34  72 <p_>In the public lobby of Charles Schwab & Co.'s office on 
A34  73 Montgomery Street, investors waited patiently in line for a chance 
A34  74 to use a Quotron machine to check stock prices and get the latest 
A34  75 Wall Street news. Others watched the parade of prices march across 
A34  76 a neon green electronic ticker tape from a row of built-in 
A34  77 seats.<p/>
A34  78 <p_>Some came hunting for bargains on Monday, searching for good 
A34  79 buys after the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 105 
A34  80 points in the first two hours of trading. The index of 30 key 
A34  81 stocks - a barometer of the stock market's health - gained steadily 
A34  82 throughout the afternoon to close at 3,179, down 21.61 points.<p/>
A34  83 <p_>Tom Taggart, a spokesman for discount broker Charles Schwab, 
A34  84 said the market rallied in the afternoon as individuals and 
A34  85 institutions bought up undervalued stocks.<p/>
A34  86 <p_>The crowd at Charles Schwab was a little larger than normal for 
A34  87 a Monday morning, said Ray Brann, who comes to <quote_>"visit his 
A34  88 money"<quote/> every day.<p/>
A34  89 <p_>Brann took the stock market's current gyrations in stride. He 
A34  90 compared the stock market to the new movie 'Mr. Saturday Night,' a 
A34  91 portrait of the life and times of a Jewish comedian from his youth 
A34  92 until age 72. In the stock market - as in life - things change, 
A34  93 Brann said.<p/>
A34  94 <p_><quote_>"The market can't keep going up and up,"<quote/> he 
A34  95 said. <quote_>"It has to have its peaks and valleys, otherwise 
A34  96 there would just be robots here buying stocks and that would be no 
A34  97 fun."<quote/><p/>
A34  98 <p_>Brann said the current stock market presents more opportunities 
A34  99 to make money than to lose it. But Brann said he's too old to take 
A34 100 risks with his money, which is invested in railroad, utility and 
A34 101 oil stocks. <quote_>"At my age, I don't even buy green 
A34 102 bananas,"<quote/> he said with a smile.<p/>
A34 103 <p_>Another stock market aficionado in the Charles Schwab lobby 
A34 104 said investors are concerned, but not panicking about the stock 
A34 105 market. However, he warned that if the market takes a precipitous 
A34 106 fall, that would be the last straw for the nation, which has been 
A34 107 battered by layoffs, corporate cutbacks and high unemployment 
A34 108 rates, and it would signal the end of George Bush's presidency.<p/>
A34 109 <p_><quote_>"George Bush's chances of getting re-elected now are 
A34 110 poor,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"If the stock market continues to 
A34 111 fall, his chances will be zero."<quote/><p/>
A34 112 <p_>Ed Cole, who is vacationing in The City and stopped by Charles 
A34 113 Schwab's office to check out the latest stock market news, said he 
A34 114 hopes the market will continue to fall this week, so that 
A34 115 overpriced stocks will reach a <quote_>"reasonable 
A34 116 level."<quote/><p/>
A34 117 <p_>Cole said he owns some stocks, and is waiting for the right 
A34 118 moment to invest in more. <quote_>"There will come a point when 
A34 119 stocks become so unpopular that people don't even want to talk 
A34 120 about them,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"That's when I'll start 
A34 121 looking at stocks."<quote/><p/>

A34 123 <h_><p_>Pressure on Fed to drop rates<p/>
A34 124 <p_>Market news adds to grim outlook<p/>
A34 125 <p_>By Martin Crutsinger<p/>
A34 126 <p_>ASSOCIATED PRESS<p/><h/>
A34 127 <p_>WASHINGTON - A sharp drop in U.S. stock prices on Monday 
A34 128 underscored the economy's bleak prospects and added renewed 
A34 129 pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, analysts 
A34 130 said.<p/>
A34 131 <p_>Many economists forecast that further rate cuts could come at 
A34 132 the end of a key meeting of Fed policy makers Tuesday.<p/>
A34 133 <p_>If the Fed does move, analysts said that a variety of consumer 
A34 134 and business interest rates, already at levels not seen in more 
A34 135 than two decades, will fall as well.<p/>
A34 136 <p_>But they were not at all certain that a new round of rate cuts 
A34 137 would have any more impact than 24 previous reductions in curing 
A34 138 what ails a sick economy.<p/>
A34 139 <p_>Rate-cut speculation gained urgency Monday after the Dow Jones 
A34 140 industrial average plunged by more than 100 points in early 
A34 141 trading. It later recovered, when traders, believing it had hit 
A34 142 bottom, began buying. Nonetheless, the index still closed down 
A34 143 21.61, at 3,179, the lowest finish since the first day of trading 
A34 144 this year, Jan. 2, when it ended the day at 3,172.41.<p/>
A34 145 <p_>Some analysts blamed Monday's sell-off, which followed a 
A34 146 54-point drop on Friday, on investor disappointment that the Fed 
A34 147 did not immediately act to lower interest rates following release 
A34 148 of the unemployment report Friday.<p/>
A34 149 <p_>That report, the last before the November election, showed that 
A34 150 while the overall unemployment rate dipped to 7.5 percent in 
A34 151 September, 57,000 Americans were laid off as the job market 
A34 152 remained extremely weak.<p/>
A34 153 <p_><quote_>"The big sell-off is what the Fed gets for not easing 
A34 154 on Friday,"<quote/> said Michael Evans, head of a Washington 
A34 155 economic consulting firm. <quote_>"The only thing that has been 
A34 156 supporting stock prices all year long is that every time it looked 
A34 157 like the economy was failing, the Fed would come along and ease 
A34 158 again."<quote/><p/>
A34 159 <p_>Other economists noted that the Wall Street tailspin followed 
A34 160 declines Monday in stock prices in Tokyo and Europe.<p/>
A34 161 <p_>Analysts cited various factors such as the continued turmoil on 
A34 162 European currency exchanges and widespread economic weakness not 
A34 163 only in the United States but also in Europe and Japan as major 
A34 164 contributing factors to the market jitters.<p/>
A34 165 <p_><quote_>"A worldwide recession is a distinct possibility and 
A34 166 stock markets are selling off on that concern,"<quote/> said Allen 
A34 167 Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.<p/>
A34 168 <p_><quote_>"The U.S. economy is in deep, deep difficulty. Germany 
A34 169 continues to run a very dangerous high-interest rate policy that 
A34 170 could bring down all of Europe and Japan is going nowhere,"<quote/> 
A34 171 Sinai said.<p/>
A34 172 <p_>Economists said that while the overall U.S. economy has been 
A34 173 growing since the spring of 1991, the recovery has been the weakest 
A34 174 on record despite the Fed's repeated moves to push interest rates 
A34 175 down over the last three years.<p/>
A34 176 <p_><quote_>"I am not nervous about another recession. I am worried 
A34 177 about how we are going to get out of this one,"<quote/> said David 
A34 178 Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill Inc.<p/>
A34 179 <p_>Many analysts said they believe the Fed will have no choice but 
A34 180 to lower interest rates again given the fact that high federal 
A34 181 budget deficits have eliminated the possibility of boosting 
A34 182 government spending or cutting taxes to stimulate a weak 
A34 183 economy.<p/>
A34 184 <p_>Some economists said they were looking for the Fed to cut its 
A34 185 discount rate, the interest that it charges banks, from 3 percent 
A34 186 down to 2.5 percent, which would put this bellwether rate at its 
A34 187 lowest point in 33 years.<p/>
A34 188 <p_>Analysts said that any reduction in the discount rate would be 
A34 189 accompanied by another cut in the Fed's target for the federal 
A34 190 funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight 
A34 191 loans. This rate, currently at 3 percent, was last reduced by the 
A34 192 Fed on Sept. 4. The last discount rate cut occurred on July 2.<p/>
A34 193 <p_>If their expectations on Fed moves are correct, analysts said 
A34 194 they believed that various consumer and business loan rates would 
A34 195 promptly decline. They forecast that banks' prime lending rate, to 
A34 196 which many business and consumer loans are tied, would drop from 
A34 197 the current 6 percent to 5.5 percent. That would be the lowest 
A34 198 level for the prime rate in two decades.<p/>
A34 199 <p_>Analysts did not expect as dramatic a change in long-term 
A34 200 mortgage rates, which in recent weeks have fallen to levels not 
A34 201 seen since 1973. The national average for fixed-rate loans stood at 
A34 202 7.93 percent last week, according to a survey done by the Federal 
A34 203 Home Loan Mortgage Corp.<p/>
A34 204 <p_>Economists said that long-term interest rates, which are more 
A34 205 tied to movements in financial markets, may not fall further given 
A34 206 investors' concerns that a victory by Bill Clinton might spell 
A34 207 higher budget deficits if the Democrat decides to boost federal 
A34 208 spending to get the economy going again regardless of what it might 
A34 209 do to the deficit.<p/>
A34 210 <p_><quote_>"If Clinton gets in, he will turn to fiscal stimulus 
A34 211 and that will mean higher deficits,"<quote/> Evans said. 
A34 212 <quote_>"The markets are concerned about who will buy that extra 
A34 213 debt."<quote/><p/>

A34 216 <p_>High-tech, biotech firms endangered<p/>
A34 217 <p_>By Sally Lehrman<p/>
A34 218 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A34 219 <p_>The stock market's gyrations could hurt the technology and 
A34 220 biotechnology companies leading the Bay Area economy - and 
A34 221 consumers may stash their cash under a mattress instead of spending 
A34 222 in local stores, economists and market watchers said.<p/>
A34 223 <p_>If the market pessimism continues, local technology and 
A34 224 biotechnology companies could feel some pain, said Michael Murphy, 
A34 225 editor of the California Technology Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay. 
A34 226 These companies have relied on the public markets to raise money 
A34 227 for research and development as bank loans have become more 
A34 228 difficult to obtain. And they count on strong share prices to keep 
A34 229 their employees feeling wealthy and motivated.<p/>
A34 230 <p_>Fortunately, many biotech companies have already tapped into 
A34 231 public offerings for financing this year and the older technology 
A34 232 companies can support their research with sales.<p/>

A35   1 <#FROWN:A35\><h_><p_>Investors May Seek Vote on Executive Pay 
A35   2 Consultants<p/>
A35   3 <p_>BY GILBERT FUCHSBERG<p/>
A35   4 <p_>Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<p/><h/>
A35   5 <p_>The controversy over executive pay is escalating again.<p/>
A35   6 <p_>Some of the nation's biggest investors and shareholder groups 
A35   7 are considering pushing a new plan: Let shareholders vote each year 
A35   8 on a company's choice of pay consultant, much as they already do on 
A35   9 a company's auditor.<p/>
A35  10 <p_>The groups also intend to target companies that are reported to 
A35  11 be threatening compensation consultants who discuss pay plans with 
A35  12 government regulators and media organizations.<p/>
A35  13 <p_>Supporters of these moves, including some of the nation's 
A35  14 biggest pension plans, say they consider the steps essential to 
A35  15 curb what they see as excesses in the compensation of many top 
A35  16 executives.<p/>
A35  17 <p_>The most striking element of their plans is the proposal for 
A35  18 shareholder votes on compensation consultants, who have gained 
A35  19 increasing visibility and influence in corporate boardrooms as the 
A35  20 pay debate has developed. Proponents believe that if they can wrest 
A35  21 control of the consultants away from management, they can better 
A35  22 control the pay packages the consultants recommend.<p/>
A35  23 <p_>The proposal faces an uphill fight. It hasn't been formalized 
A35  24 yet and would require approval from the Securities and Exchange 
A35  25 Commission, where it would probably face stiff opposition from 
A35  26 companies.<p/>
A35  27 <p_>But the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington, D.C., 
A35  28 the principal trade group for pension funds, says it will discuss 
A35  29 seeking SEC approval of the plan when it convenes next month.<p/>
A35  30 <p_><quote_>"We've let management have control of the consultants 
A35  31 for a long time, but the world needn't be that way,"<quote/> said 
A35  32 Carol O'Cleireacain, who heads the council's executive committee. 
A35  33 <quote_>"The independence of the consultants must be 
A35  34 guaranteed."<quote/> Ms. O'Cleireacain is also New York City's 
A35  35 commissioner of finance and helps direct five pension funds with 
A35  36 some $49 billion in assets.<p/>
A35  37 <p_>In interviews, several other members of the council, including 
A35  38 those who help direct big pension funds in California and New 
A35  39 Jersey, expressed support for the plan. They said they hoped that 
A35  40 the SEC would approve the plan, citing the commission's recent move 
A35  41 to allow shareholder votes on pay policies and its proposals to 
A35  42 improve disclosures about executive pay in company proxy 
A35  43 statements.<p/>
A35  44 <p_>If approved, shareholder voting on compensation consultants 
A35  45 would be a blow to corporate executives and directors, who have 
A35  46 held the power to hire and fire consultants and other advisers. 
A35  47 Shareholder groups contend that compensation consultants are so 
A35  48 beholden to management that they can't help but endorse generous 
A35  49 executive pay practices.<p/>
A35  50 <p_>The SEC declined to comment on the matter. A spokesman for the 
A35  51 Business Roundtable, a New York-based group of corporate executives 
A35  52 that has opposed efforts to increase regulation of executive pay, 
A35  53 called the plan <quote_>"completely unnecessary."<quote/><p/>
A35  54 <p_>The spokesman added: <quote_>"By the same token, you can have 
A35  55 shareholders review every consultant you have, from design 
A35  56 consultants to management consultants to pollution 
A35  57 consultants."<quote/><p/>
A35  58 <p_>Thomas E. Jones, executive vice president of 
A35  59 <tf_>Citicorp<tf/>, said it was <quote_>"somewhat strange that of 
A35  60 all the services rendered to a corporation, someone would focus on 
A35  61 compensation consultants."<quote/> While companies are required to 
A35  62 undergo an annual audit, he noted, not all companies hire 
A35  63 consultants on pay issues.<p/>
A35  64 <p_>Mr. Jones said, <quote_>"It strikes me as being somewhat of a 
A35  65 sledgehammer to an issue that is already fully vented."<quote/><p/>
A35  66 <p_>Several compensation consultants also reacted negatively to the 
A35  67 idea, rejecting any comparison with auditors and suggesting that 
A35  68 shareholders aren't qualified to judge their work.<p/>
A35  69 <p_><quote_>"Auditors certify, but we don't certify anything. We 
A35  70 provide information and advice,"<quote/> said Geoffrey A. Wiegman, 
A35  71 director of compensation consulting for <tf_>Buck Consultants<tf/>, 
A35  72 New York. <quote_>"The concept of having shareholders approve the 
A35  73 hiring of advisers, which is what we are, would be a 
A35  74 mistake."<quote/><p/>
A35  75 <p_>Jude Rich, chairman of consultants <tf_>Sibson & Co.<tf/>, 
A35  76 Princeton, N.J., termed the idea <quote_>"window dressing, just 
A35  77 like the auditor's choice is,"<quote/> and asked: <quote_>"When's 
A35  78 the last time anyone voted down an auditor?"<quote/><p/>
A35  79 <p_>Dallas M. Kersey, a principal with consultants <tf_>Towers 
A35  80 Perrin<tf/>, New York, said his firm believes that <quote_>"the 
A35  81 issue of an executive's pay and how that pay relates to performance 
A35  82 issues is an extremely complicated one that is extremely difficult 
A35  83 for an outsider to pass good quality judgment on."<quote/><p/>
A35  84 <p_>Institutional investors are targeting corporate ties to 
A35  85 compensation consultants partly in reaction to reports that some 
A35  86 companies are pressuring consultants to avoid cooperating with 
A35  87 requests for executive pay information from news organizations and 
A35  88 regulators. These consultants said the pressure, reported this week 
A35  89 in the New York Times, has included letters and calls from clients 
A35  90 suggesting that the clients may pull business if the cooperation 
A35  91 doesn't stop.<p/>
A35  92 <p_>Several big shareholders, saying they find the pressure tactics 
A35  93 offensive, have vowed to increase their vigilance on pay issues. 
A35  94 They said they will target for scrutiny some high-paying companies 
A35  95 that unduly pressure consultants.<p/>
A35  96 <p_><quote_>"This will double and triple our efforts to see that 
A35  97 the pay issue is pursued,"<quote/> said Richard Koppes, general 
A35  98 counsel of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, 
A35  99 which at $68 billion is the nation's largest public pension fund. 
A35 100 After a year of working quietly in a <quote|>"kinder" way to press 
A35 101 companies for change, Calpers will return to <quote_>"a more 
A35 102 aggressive route"<quote/> in pressing for corporate governance 
A35 103 changes, including holder resolutions, Mr. Koppes said.<p/>
A35 104 <p_>Ms. O'Cleireacain of New York City said that she intends to 
A35 105 <quote_>"make our position very clear to corporate executives that 
A35 106 we won't tolerate threats to the information investors 
A35 107 get."<quote/> She also said that she plans to meet with consultants 
A35 108 <quote_>"about ways that make it easier to do their business 
A35 109 independently."<quote/> And, echoing the view of several 
A35 110 institutional investors, Ms. O'Cleireacain said that she would 
A35 111 press for more companies to give primary responsibility for setting 
A35 112 executive compensation to committees of independent directors.<p/>
A35 113 <p_>As institutional investors plotted their strategies, one of the 
A35 114 more visible shareholder activist groups, United Shareholders 
A35 115 Association, Washington, D.C., tentatively added Citicorp and 
A35 116 <tf_>General Mills<tf/> Inc. to the list of companies it considers 
A35 117 unfair to shareholders. Ralph Whitworth, president of the group, 
A35 118 said the action stemmed from reports that the chairmen of the two 
A35 119 companies, John S. Reed of Citicorp and H. Brewster Atwater Jr. of 
A35 120 General Mills, had helped spearhead a campaign against a proposed 
A35 121 accounting rule that would deduct from corporate earnings the 
A35 122 estimated value of stock options granted to executives and other 
A35 123 employees.<p/>
A35 124 <p_>That campaign has included letters of protest by companies to 
A35 125 the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which is mulling the rule 
A35 126 and which is the chief rule-making body for accountants.<p/>
A35 127 <p_>Some companies also contacted compensation consultants about 
A35 128 their concerns. Last month, for example, the chairman of Towers 
A35 129 Perrin received a letter from Richard J. Mahoney, chairman of 
A35 130 Monsanto Co., a Towers Perrin client, expressing concern about 
A35 131 <quote_>"the recent political and media attention devoted"<quote/> 
A35 132 to stock-option accounting. The letter urged the firm's 
A35 133 <quote_>"active and timely communication"<quote/> with FASB to 
A35 134 retain the current rules, which don't account for stock options. 
A35 135 (Stock options give holders the right to buy stock in the future at 
A35 136 a predetermined price, a potential bonanza if the stock price rises 
A35 137 well above the issue price.) Towers Perrin is part of an FASB task 
A35 138 force weighing the stock-option proposal.<p/>
A35 139 <p_><quote_>"The main problem here is they are using shareholder 
A35 140 money to fight against shareholder interests,"<quote/> Mr. 
A35 141 Whitworth said. <quote_>"That has to change."<quote/> He said that 
A35 142 his group won't make a final decision about listing the companies 
A35 143 for several weeks, pending meetings with executives of the two 
A35 144 companies. Mr. Atwater of General Mills has already agreed to a 
A35 145 meeting.<p/>
A35 146 <p_>Mr. Whitworth said that his group urges shareholders to vote 
A35 147 against the director slates proposed by companies on its target 
A35 148 list. The group also presses for change in meetings with top 
A35 149 executives, and it has produced results: It reached settlements 
A35 150 with more than a dozen of the 50 companies on its 1991 list. Among 
A35 151 them: <tf|>ITT Corp., which agreed to tie the pay of its executives 
A35 152 more closely to performance, and <tf|>UAL Corp., which said that it 
A35 153 would more clearly disclose in its proxy statement certain elements 
A35 154 of its pay plans.<p/>
A35 155 <p_>Mr. Atwater, who called Mr. Whitworth to discuss the group's 
A35 156 action, denied in an interview that General Mills <quote_>"has been 
A35 157 lobbying consultants."<quote/> Further, he defended efforts to 
A35 158 fight the new accounting rule, saying that deducting the value of 
A35 159 options from earnings <quote_>"is not an appropriate way to account 
A35 160 for them"<quote/> because that would <quote_>"hit earnings 
A35 161 twice"<quote/> - once when the options are issued and again when 
A35 162 they're exercised. As a result, he contended that the adoption of 
A35 163 such a rule would <quote|>"kill" most stock option plans. At 
A35 164 General Mills, Mr. Atwater said, stock options have been 
A35 165 <quote_>"truly motivating"<quote/> to managers and represent a key 
A35 166 method of linking pay to corporate performance.<p/>
A35 167 <p_>At the same time, Mr. Atwater said that General Mills supported 
A35 168 the SEC's proposals to increase disclosure of executive 
A35 169 compensation data in proxy statements. He said that the company had 
A35 170 adopted many of the proposed changes in its latest proxy 
A35 171 statement.<p/>
A35 172 <p_>Mr. Reed couldn't be reached. But Mr. Jones of Citicorp, who 
A35 173 has worked with Mr. Reed on behalf of the Business Roundtable in 
A35 174 opposing the accounting rule, denied that Citicorp had ever 
A35 175 pressured or threatened compensation consultants. He further 
A35 176 disputed Citicorp's tentative inclusion on the United Shareholders 
A35 177 list, saying that <quote_>"how you account for employee stock 
A35 178 options is a legitimate topic for open discussion."<quote/><p/>

A35 180 <h_><p_>Leader in Videoconferencing Faces Expanding Field<p/>
A35 181 <p_>PictureTel's Stock Price Has Fallen; It Calls Problems 
A35 182 Overblown<p/>
A35 183 <p_>BY JOSEPH PEREIRA<p/>
A35 184 <p_>Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<p/><h/>
A35 185 <p_>Earlier this year, a school district in northern Alaska went 
A35 186 shopping for a videoconferencing system to link teachers with 
A35 187 classes in scattered communities.<p/>
A35 188 <p_>But it didn't buy from market leader <tf_>PictureTel<tf/> Corp. 
A35 189 Instead, it chose a system made by <tf_>VideoTelecom<tf/> Corp., an 
A35 190 upstart that offered to install equipment and train staff at eight 
A35 191 sites for $700,000 - well under PictureTel's $800,000 bid.<p/>
A35 192 <p_><quote_>"It wasn't a hard decision to make,"<quote/> says 
A35 193 Martin Cary, coordinator of information and technology at 
A35 194 Northslope Borrough School District in Barrow. <quote_>"We went 
A35 195 with the checkbook."<quote/><p/>
A35 196 <p_>VideoTelecom isn't the only rival that industry pioneer 
A35 197 PictureTel in Danvers, Mass., has to worry about. <quote_>"Very 
A35 198 soon consumers will have 36 products in the videoconferencing 
A35 199 market to choose from,"<quote/> says Elliot Gold, publisher of 
A35 200 Tele<?_>-<?/>Span, a telecommunications newsletter. <quote_>"By the 
A35 201 end of the quarter, there'll be several competitors with comparable 
A35 202 systems and lower prices."<quote/> Among the rivals are corporate 
A35 203 giants with deep pockets, such as <tf|>Hitachi Ltd.'s Hitachi 
A35 204 America unit, <tf_>Northern Telecom<tf/> Ltd. and <tf_>American 
A35 205 Telephone & Telegraph<tf/> Co.<p/>
A35 206 <p_>The increasingly crowded market has slowed the growth of 
A35 207 high-flying PictureTel and caused its stock to plummet 79% from a 
A35 208 peak of $53 a share earlier this year. The stock closed yesterday 
A35 209 at $11 a share, down 25 cents, in trading on the national 
A35 210 over-the-counter market. While analysts still expect the company's 
A35 211 revenue to grow sharply from $78 million last year, they now 
A35 212 estimate 1992 revenue of $130 million - down from $150 million 
A35 213 predicted earlier. And the company, which started making money in 
A35 214 1991 after years of losses, says it will only break-even in the 
A35 215 third quarter.<p/>
A35 216 <p_>PictureTel insists that its problems are overblown and have 
A35 217 been compounded by the sluggish economy. Many new products 
A35 218 announced by rivals haven't been introduced. <quote_>"There will be 
A35 219 some confusion for quite a bit of time with new 
A35 220 announcements,"<quote/> says Joan Nevin, vice president for 
A35 221 finance. But, she adds, <quote_>"Those products compared to ours is 
A35 222 like a two-wheel bicycle versus a Mercedes."<quote/><p/>
A35 223 <p_>And some agree short-term problems shouldn't overshadow the 
A35 224 company's long<?_>-<?/>term potential. <quote_>"The past has been 
A35 225 very bright and I think the future can also be very bright, too, if 
A35 226 PictureTel decides now what practical steps it needs to take to get 
A35 227 to that yellow brick road,"<quote/> says John Rohal, an analyst at 
A35 228 Alex. Brown & Sons.<p/>
A35 229 <p_>But others are more skeptical. <quote_>"PictureTel was just 
A35 230 sailing along so smoothly their recent developments come as a shock 
A35 231 to many of us and I think PictureTel may be headed for some tough 
A35 232 times,"<quote/> said Sarah Dickinson, an analyst at Personal 
A35 233 Technology Research.<p/>
A35 234 <p_>PictureTel isn't the only company feeling the effects of new 
A35 235 competition. Long<?_>-<?/>time rival <tf_>Compression Labs<tf/> 
A35 236 Inc., No. 2 in the market, recently cited lower margins and 
A35 237 increased competition for its first-half loss of $1.4 million 
A35 238 despite an increase in revenue to $48 million from $30.9 
A35 239 million.<p/>

A36   1 <#FROWN:A36\><h_><p_>Buying binge continues on Wall Street<p/>
A36   2 <p_>By Tom Walker<p/>
A36   3 <p_>STAFF WRITER<p/><h/>
A36   4 <p_>A buying frenzy continued in the stock market for the second 
A36   5 straight day Wednesday, pushing one broad-based stock index to a 
A36   6 record in the heaviest trading since mid-January.<p/>
A36   7 <p_>The buying was reminiscent of the record-setting trading early 
A36   8 in the year, when drastic interest rate cuts sent a flood of money 
A36   9 out of low-yielding certificates of deposit and into stocks.<p/>
A36  10 <p_>Low interest rates are also responsible for the latest stock 
A36  11 buying rally, analysts say.<p/>
A36  12 <p_>But this time the buying is driven by falling long-term 
A36  13 Treasury bond yields instead of cuts in the Federal Reserve's 
A36  14 discount rate, which triggered the earlier rally.<p/>
A36  15 <p_>Investors looking for better yields - and afraid to miss a 
A36  16 rising market - pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to a 
A36  17 record 422.23 on Wednesday, surpassing the old mark set in 
A36  18 January.<p/>
A36  19 <p_>The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip stocks surged 45.12 
A36  20 points to 3,379.19, on top of Tuesday's 51.87-point gain.<p/>
A36  21 <p_>The Dow's two-day increase of almost 3 percent brought the 
A36  22 index within 34.02 points of its record, set June 1.<p/>
A36  23 <p_>Analysts said the S&P 500 record was significant, because that 
A36  24 index measures a broader array of industrial and other New York 
A36  25 Stock Exchange issues than the Dow average.<p/>
A36  26 <p_>Equally significant was the trading volume on the New York 
A36  27 Stock Exchange, which hit levels not seen since Jan. 17.<p/>
A36  28 <h_><p_>T-bond yields down<p/><h/>
A36  29 <p_>Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds are declining for the same 
A36  30 reason that stock prices are rising: There is great demand among 
A36  31 investors for bonds, reflecting the bond market's conviction that 
A36  32 inflation will not be a problem for some time.<p/>
A36  33 <p_>While falling yields make stock market returns more attractive 
A36  34 by comparison, analysts say long-term bond yields are still 
A36  35 attractively high for investors who prefer the security of 
A36  36 fixed-income securities, and the prospect of low inflation is good 
A36  37 for both stocks and bonds.<p/>

A36  39 <h_><p_>Economy slows down again<p/>
A36  40 <p_>2nd-quarter report sparks recession talk<p/>
A36  41 <p_>By Bill Hendrick<p/>
A36  42 <p_>STAFF WRITER<p/><h/>
A36  43 <p_>If you can visualize the economy as a roller coaster, then 
A36  44 picture it now as careening downward for the third time since 
A36  45 1989.<p/>
A36  46 <p_>And some experts fear it's derailing into a new recession.<p/>
A36  47 <p_><quote_>"This recovery is so extremely weak, there's a real 
A36  48 danger there could be another recession,"<quote/> Georgia Tech 
A36  49 economist Thomas D. Boston said Thursday after the Commerce 
A36  50 Department reported that economic growth had slowed to a crawl.<p/>
A36  51 <p_>The report put the second quarter's growth rate at only 1.4 
A36  52 percent, less than half the first quarter's 2.9 percent rate and 
A36  53 considerably less than the 2 percent needed to keep unemployment 
A36  54 from rising.<p/>
A36  55 <p_>The slowdown marked the third time since 1989 that the economy 
A36  56 has gotten sicker after appearing to be on the road to better 
A36  57 health.<p/>
A36  58 <h_><p_>Declining gross domestic product<p/><h/>
A36  59 <p_>The news was a blow to President Bush, who has presided over 
A36  60 the most prolonged period of economic lethargy since the Great 
A36  61 Depression.<p/>
A36  62 <p_>The value of goods and services produced within U.S. borders, 
A36  63 known as the gross domestic product, expanded 2.5 percent in 1989, 
A36  64 his first year in office, and 0.8 percent in 1990, but declined in 
A36  65 value by 1.2 percent last year.<p/>
A36  66 <p_>The economy's growth rate picked up strongly in the first three 
A36  67 months of 1992 from a near-recessionary 0.6 percent pace in the 
A36  68 final quarter of 1991. Many economists attributed the growth spurt 
A36  69 to unilateral steps announced by Mr. Bush in his State of the Union 
A36  70 speech that pumped new money into consumers' pockets and a little 
A36  71 life into businesses.<p/>
A36  72 <p_>He ordered corporations to withhold less tax from employees' 
A36  73 paychecks and federal department heads to speed up $10 billion in 
A36  74 discretionary spending.<p/>
A36  75 <p_>But S. Jay Levy, a respected New York economist, said the 
A36  76 temporary magic has dissipated and the economy may be lumbering 
A36  77 toward a new slump. Consumers who had more to spend because less 
A36  78 tax was withheld will get no refunds, or smaller refunds, next tax 
A36  79 season, and may even have to borrow money to pay Uncle Sam, he 
A36  80 said.<p/>
A36  81 <p_><quote_>"We are nearer recession,"<quote/> said Kurt Karl of 
A36  82 the WEFA Group, a Philadelphia-based consulting firm. 
A36  83 <quote_>"There's no indication at this time we can look for 
A36  84 strength."<quote/><p/>
A36  85 <h_><p_>Recession worse than thought<p/><h/>
A36  86 <p_>The Commerce Department also said its revised figures show the 
A36  87 recession of 1990-91 was worse than previously thought. Economic 
A36  88 growth actually declined for three quarters instead of just two - 
A36  89 in the third and fourth quarters of 1990 and 1991's first 
A36  90 quarter.<p/>
A36  91 <p_>'Recession' is a technical term, and most economists say the 
A36  92 slump that began in mid-1990 ended in the spring of 1991. But most 
A36  93 people don't feel the recession is over because jobs are scarce, 10 
A36  94 million people are unemployed and buying power is inching up slower 
A36  95 than consumer prices.<p/>
A36  96 <p_>The report also said:<p/>
A36  97 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/>Real disposable income is growing at an 
A36  98 annual rate of only 0.7 percent.<p/>
A36  99 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/>Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the 
A36 100 economy, actually declined in the second quarter by 0.3 percent, 
A36 101 down from a 5.1 percent gain in the first quarter.<p/>
A36 102 <p_><*_>black-triangle<*/>The personal savings rate fell from over 
A36 103 5 percent to 4.9 percent, low compared with the historical average 
A36 104 of 7 percent.<p/>
A36 105 <p_>Consumers aren't spending on new items, but <quote_>"they are 
A36 106 saving very little"<quote/> because it's taking most of what they 
A36 107 make to pay bills, Dr. Levy said.<p/>
A36 108 <p_>Given such news, it's no wonder the Conference Board's consumer 
A36 109 confidence index suffered one of its worst monthly declines ever in 
A36 110 July, said Albert W. Niemi Jr., dean of business at the University 
A36 111 of Georgia.<p/>
A36 112 <h_><p_>Public perception<p/><h/>
A36 113 <p_><quote_>"The average person looks on recession as whether jobs 
A36 114 are being created, and the situation has clearly gotten 
A36 115 worse,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"People don't believe it's 
A36 116 over."<quote/><p/>
A36 117 <p_>Worse, the unemployment rate is likely to rise from 7.8 percent 
A36 118 to 8 percent, he said.<p/>
A36 119 <p_><quote_>"This expansion is so weak, it's not able to create 
A36 120 more than enough jobs to offset the demographics of new people who 
A36 121 want to work,"<quote/> Dr. Niemi said. <quote_>"I don't think we're 
A36 122 going to crash into a new recession, but it's like a plane taking 
A36 123 off, just bouncing along the runway, and barely inching 
A36 124 up."<quote/><p/>
A36 125 <p_>Though not all the news is bad - the government said new claims 
A36 126 for unemployment compensation fell by 21,000 to 400,000 this week - 
A36 127 it should be enough to worry the president, Dr. Niemi said.<p/>
A36 128 <p_>With economic growth this slow, there's no way the unemployment 
A36 129 rate can fall much if at all before Election Day. And that's the 
A36 130 one economic measure everybody understands.<p/>

A36 132 <h_><p_>Industrial recovery in metro area outpacing state, survey 
A36 133 indicates<p/>
A36 134 <p_>By Tom Walker<p/>
A36 135 <p_>STAFF WRITER<p/><h/>
A36 136 <p_>Metro Atlanta's economy regained much of its industrial 
A36 137 momentum at the beginning of the third quarter, ahead of the state, 
A36 138 a survey of purchasing managers showed Thursday.<p/>
A36 139 <p_>The index of purchasing managers in metro Atlanta moved up in 
A36 140 July to 62.7 from 58.7 in June, according to Kennesaw State 
A36 141 Ekonometrics of Kennesaw State College, which compiles the 
A36 142 survey.<p/>
A36 143 <p_>Statewide, the index of Georgia purchasing managers dropped to 
A36 144 60.1 in July from 60.8 in June.<p/>
A36 145 <p_><quote_>"Both readings are well above the benchmark for 
A36 146 recovery, suggesting continued economic strength for the state and 
A36 147 metro Atlanta,"<quote/> said Kennsaw's Don Sabbarese.<p/>
A36 148 <p_>The readings were also consistent with forecasts of other 
A36 149 economists that Atlanta, which led the state into recession, is 
A36 150 leading it out.<p/>
A36 151 <p_>The monthly state and local indexes, compiled from surveys of 
A36 152 the Purchasing Managers Association of Georgia, provide a trend 
A36 153 line of industrial activity based on new orders, production, 
A36 154 employment, suppliers' delivery speed and inventories.<p/>
A36 155 <p_>Factory production increased at both local and state levels in 
A36 156 July. Employment, however, increased only in metro Atlanta while 
A36 157 remaining flat statewide.<p/>
A36 158 <p_>According to Dr. Sabbarese, the failure of employment to 
A36 159 increase was a sign that firms <quote_>"continue their cautious use 
A36 160 of temporary workers and/or longer workweeks to boost 
A36 161 production."<quote/><p/>

A36 163 <h_><p_>Ford reports $502 million profit in 2nd quarter<p/>
A36 164 <p_>Bulk is from financial, not auto, units<p/>
A36 165 <p_>FROM OUR NEWS SERVICES<p/><h/>
A36 166 <p_>Detroit - Ford Motor Co. reported second-quarter earnings of 
A36 167 $502 million Wednesday, its best in two years, but more than half 
A36 168 came from a record performance by the automaker's financial 
A36 169 services business.<p/>
A36 170 <p_>Ford's automotive operations in the United States and Europe 
A36 171 were profitable, contributing $213 million. But Ford Motor Credit 
A36 172 and The Associates, a banking subsidiary, accounted for $289 
A36 173 million.<p/>
A36 174 <p_>On a per-share basis, Ford earned 93 cents in this year's 
A36 175 second quarter, compared with a loss of $324 million, or 68 cents a 
A36 176 share, a year ago during the depths of an industry recession.<p/>
A36 177 <p_>The No. 2 U.S. automaker's earnings were the best since the 
A36 178 $771 million profit reported in the second quarter of 1990. Company 
A36 179 officials were cautious about predicting continued gains, 
A36 180 however.<p/>
A36 181 <p_><quote_>"The U.S. economy, while improving, is still fragile, 
A36 182 as are the economies in many of Ford's key overseas 
A36 183 markets,"<quote/> Ford Chairman Harold Poling said.<p/>
A36 184 <p_>David McCammon, vice president for finance, predicted that 
A36 185 third-quarter results, normally the weakest of the year, would be 
A36 186 down from the second quarter.<p/>
A36 187 <p_>That caution was reflected among investors, as Ford stock fell 
A36 188 $1.50 to $44.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading.<p/>
A36 189 <p_>Lower credit losses and higher net interest margins - the 
A36 190 difference between what was paid on deposits and the interest rate 
A36 191 charged on loans - were credited for the financial services 
A36 192 improvement.<p/>
A36 193 <h_><p_>Good long-term outlook<p/><h/>
A36 194 <p_><quote_>"Long term, I think Ford's in real good shape,"<quote/> 
A36 195 said Chris Cedergren, an auto industry analyst with AutoPacific 
A36 196 Group in Thousand Oaks, Calif. <quote_>"The only question in the 
A36 197 near term is what's going to happen in the current market for cars 
A36 198 and trucks."<quote/><p/>
A36 199 <p_>Although more people are buying vehicles, there is growing 
A36 200 concern about how long that will last because of new signs that the 
A36 201 economy is weakening.<p/>
A36 202 <p_>Ford's pretax earnings were higher than analysts had expected, 
A36 203 and even after taxes they were within the range of forecasts. The 
A36 204 earnings came a day after Chrysler Corp. reported surprisingly 
A36 205 strong profits for the period. General Motors Corp. will report 
A36 206 earnings next Thursday.<p/>
A36 207 <p_>For the first six months of the year, Ford earned $840.3 
A36 208 million, or $1.53 a share, compared with a loss of $1.2 billion, or 
A36 209 $2.56 a share, in the first half of 1991.<p/>

A36 212 <p_>Buyout pact would boost presence here<p/>
A36 213 <p_>Prime Bancshares deal called beneficial<p/>
A36 214 <p_>By Nancy Nethery<p/>
A36 215 <p_>STAFF WRITER<p/><h/>
A36 216 <p_>SouthTrust Corp. is negotiating another deal that would extend 
A36 217 its reach into the Atlanta banking market.<p/>
A36 218 <p_>If an agreement with Decatur-based Prime Bancshares succeeds, 
A36 219 Birmingham, Ala.-based SouthTrust would bolster its network here 
A36 220 with $686 million in assets and 14 more branches.<p/>
A36 221 <p_>The letter of intent announced Thursday is the second buyout 
A36 222 pact between a Decatur-based thrift and an out-of-state bank this 
A36 223 summer. In June, First Union Corp. agreed to buy DFSoutheastern 
A36 224 Inc., parent of Decatur Federal.<p/>
A36 225 <p_>Prime Bancshares operates Prime Bank.<p/>
A36 226 <p_>Under the proposed deal, each share of Prime Bancshares would 
A36 227 be exchanged for 50 cents per share plus 0.89 share of SouthTrust 
A36 228 stock, the companies said.<p/>
A36 229 <p_>Based on Thursday's closing price for SouthTrust - $24.62 1/2 
A36 230 in over-the-counter trading - the deal is worth a little more than 
A36 231 $22.41 a share for Prime Bancshares stockholders. Prime Bancshares 
A36 232 closed up $3.75 to $19 in American Stock Exchange trading.<p/>
A36 233 <h_><p_><quote_>"Stronger toehold"<quote/><p/><h/>
A36 234 <p_>The deal gives SouthTrust <quote_>"a much stronger toehold in 
A36 235 Atlanta,"<quote/> said John J. Mason Jr., senior vice president of 
A36 236 Interstate/Johnson Lane.<p/>
A36 237 <p_>Thomas H. Coley, chairman, president and chief executive 
A36 238 officer of SouthTrust Bank of Georgia, said the purchase lets 
A36 239 SouthTrust <quote_>"continue our commitment to the Atlanta 
A36 240 market."<quote/><p/>
A36 241 <p_><quote_>"It's our intent to continue most of their lines of 
A36 242 business,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"We do not see much overlap in 
A36 243 the branch system."<quote/><p/>
A36 244 <p_>Mr. Coley added that the acquisition would give SouthTrust 
A36 245 about 95 branches in metro Atlanta.<p/>
A36 246 <p_>Analysts said the deal would benefit both parties.<p/>
A36 247 <p_><quote_>"The deal is another example of a company that stubs 
A36 248 its toe - but has a decent franchise - selling out at what appears 
A36 249 to be a reasonable price,"<quote/> Mr. Mason said, referring to 
A36 250 changes Prime Bancshares made at the request of regulators.<p/>
A36 251 <p_>Prime Bancshares was forced to restate its results this year, 
A36 252 after regulators told the company to reduce the value of its 
A36 253 portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Last week, 
A36 254 the thrift voted to discontinue its quarterly dividend.<p/>

A37   1 <#FROWN:A37\><h_><p_>Let's Make a Deal<p/>
A37   2 <p_>America's diplomats are learning a new credo: Sell! Sell! 
A37   3 Sell!<p/><h/>
A37   4 <p_>For two years American International Group had played by the 
A37   5 rules. Eager to sell travel insurance at Tokyo's teeming Narita 
A37   6 airport, AIG had courted Japanese officials over sake and sushi, 
A37   7 worked the maze of government agencies and filed mountains of 
A37   8 forms. But when the company learned last March that the concession 
A37   9 would go to a Japanese rival, it traded in that old strategy for a 
A37  10 new one: intervention by U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost. After 
A37  11 Armacost and his staff made some unpublicized phone calls, 
A37  12 including one to the prime minister's office, the Ministry of 
A37  13 Transportation suggested that the Japanese company share one of its 
A37  14 new booths at Narita with AIG. <quote_>"They had their old-boy 
A37  15 network. We had ours,"<quote/> says Evan Greenberg, who runs AIG's 
A37  16 business in Japan.<p/>
A37  17 <p_>George Kennan, meet Willy Loman. While weighty matters of war 
A37  18 and peace, negotiation and intelligence gathering still hold top 
A37  19 priority in U.S. embassies, the diplomatic corps has new marching 
A37  20 orders: sell. For ambassadors and consuls from Bonn to Bombay, 
A37  21 brokering business deals has become a basic part of the job. Says 
A37  22 Acting Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, <quote_>"The world 
A37  23 has changed. Today, activity to improve America's economic 
A37  24 interests is as important as anything we do."<quote/><p/>
A37  25 <p_>The French, Germans and Japanese have long been known for 
A37  26 rolling out the big diplomatic guns to advance their commercial 
A37  27 interests, and they are freer with financing and foreign aid when 
A37  28 it helps to clinch a deal. But until the late 1980s the local U.S. 
A37  29 Embassy was about the last place an American exporter would look 
A37  30 for assistance. Consular officers were famously uninterested in 
A37  31 dealing with visiting executives, and they were often inept: when 
A37  32 U.S. diplomats threw a party in S<*_>a-tilde<*/>o Paulo in 1984 to 
A37  33 promote American printing equipment, they offered their 
A37  34 Portuguese-speaking guests a sales pitch in Spanish. Many officers 
A37  35 were only too glad to lose responsibility for aiding business in 
A37  36 1982, when Congress established the U.S. & Foreign Commercial 
A37  37 Service at the Department of Commerce. But economics is king of the 
A37  38 new world order, so old diplomats have been forced to learn new 
A37  39 tricks. Says Donald Gregg, U.S. ambassador to South Korea, 
A37  40 <quote_>"The fruits of the cold war lie in our ability to 
A37  41 trade."<quote/><p/>
A37  42 <p_>Eagleburger has pushed exports hard since he became deputy 
A37  43 secretary of state in 1989. All new Foreign Service officers, 
A37  44 chiefs of mission and ambassadors now get a class on commerce as 
A37  45 part of their basic training. Last year, for the first time, USFCS 
A37  46 chief Susan Schwab was invited to meetings of U.S. ambassadors to 
A37  47 Europe and Asia. <quote_>"This is a tremendous difference from 10 
A37  48 or 20 years ago. It's not easy for any of us to recycle ourselves 
A37  49 for this purpose,"<quote/> says Thomas Simons, U.S. ambassador to 
A37  50 Poland. Simons should know: the 30-year Foreign Service veteran 
A37  51 spends almost a quarter of his time helping U.S. companies.<p/>
A37  52 <p_>That kind of high-level involvement is what drew Terry Martin 
A37  53 to Singapore. Martin, sales manager for Raynor Garage Doors in 
A37  54 Dixon, Ill., attended a Chicago briefing by five U.S. ambassadors 
A37  55 last March on how to do business in Asia. That persuaded him to 
A37  56 visit a trade show in Singapore in May. Last week he was back in 
A37  57 the island nation to sign up local agents. <quote_>"It's not every 
A37  58 day you can get all these ambassadors and commercial counselors in 
A37  59 one room and just go up and talk to everybody,"<quote/> Martin 
A37  60 says. <quote_>"We were going to come out here anyway, but they 
A37  61 certainly made it a heck of a lot easier."<quote/><p/>
A37  62 <p_>Drumming up business, of course, is Martin's problem. But 
A37  63 increasingly, diplomats are getting involved in specific 
A37  64 transactions, particularly when a foreign government has a role in 
A37  65 the buying decision. U.S. officials have successfully pressed China 
A37  66 to allow a larger presence for U.S. carmakers like Chrysler, which 
A37  67 assembles Jeeps in Beijing. Last week Hong Kong awarded a 
A37  68 consortium led by Sea-Land Servicing a half share - worth $2.6 
A37  69 billion - in the construction and operation of a new container 
A37  70 terminal, after Consul General Richard Williams spent months 
A37  71 emphasizing how the American-led group could infuse competition 
A37  72 into cargo handling. When German officials appeared to favor a 
A37  73 French proposal to build the $700 million Friedrichstadt-Passage 
A37  74 office and shopping complex in the former East Berlin, New York 
A37  75 developer Tischman-Speyer asked the embassy in Bonn to write a 
A37  76 letter on its behalf. <quote_>"They were very effective,"<quote/> 
A37  77 says chairman Jerry Speyer. <quote_>"They knew exactly where they 
A37  78 had to go."<quote/> Tischman-Speyer won a 45 percent stake in the 
A37  79 project, which got underway last month.<p/>
A37  80 <p_>Trade diplomacy isn't new, of course; U.S. diplomats have been 
A37  81 battering away at foreign import barriers for years. But lobbying 
A37  82 on behalf of particular companies is a very different sort of work. 
A37  83 Discretion is everything, and press attention is unwelcome. 
A37  84 <quote_>"The transactions generally take place quietly in a 
A37  85 meeting, and there's no publicity, so government officials are not 
A37  86 embarrassed,"<quote/> explains one official in Washington. 
A37  87 Nonetheless, using diplomats as salespeople has its dangers. Gregg 
A37  88 has helped persuade the South Korean government to hire U.S. 
A37  89 architects to design a new airport terminal, but some in Seoul 
A37  90 consider his hard sell excessive. In China, U.S. commercial 
A37  91 interest ran headlong into other diplomatic concerns. Using 
A37  92 contacts in the local government, the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou 
A37  93 helped Boeing Co. plan a pitch to China Southern Airlines last 
A37  94 spring. Then, in September, the Bush administration angered China 
A37  95 by agreeing to sell fighter planes to Taiwan. The Boeing deal is on 
A37  96 hold - and French diplomats are aggressively trying to persuade 
A37  97 China Southern to buy Airbuses instead.<p/>
A37  98 <p_><tf_>Helping whom?<tf/> Diplomatic salesmanship has less 
A37  99 obvious complexities, too. The governments of rival companies can 
A37 100 take offense; when Eagleburger recently wrote the Czech Energy 
A37 101 Commission in support of American bidders, a German official called 
A37 102 to complain. And then there's the question of whom to help. 
A37 103 <quote_>"The biggest problem we have is defining what is a U.S. 
A37 104 company,"<quote/> one ranking official confesses. Officially, the 
A37 105 State Department lets diplomats work on behalf of U.S.-owned 
A37 106 companies that want to sell products with at least 51 percent U.S. 
A37 107 content. In practice, however, there's no neat line. When Canada's 
A37 108 Northern Telecom Ltd. bids for a sale against AT&T, the Americans 
A37 109 can count on the local embassy's aid, but when the Canadian 
A37 110 company's U.S. subsidiary is doing the bidding, the diplomats must 
A37 111 remain neutral.<p/>
A37 112 <p_>How real is the Foreign Service's transformation? Arthur 
A37 113 Kobler, who recently left for the private sector after 25 years as 
A37 114 a diplomat, says that while it pays lip service to its new 
A37 115 commercial role, State's heart is still in traditional diplomacy. 
A37 116 <quote_>"There remains a clear bias in favor of political 
A37 117 officers,"<quote/> he says. <quote_>"The apparatus still is not 
A37 118 geared to the post-cold-war reality."<quote/> Eagleburger admits 
A37 119 the difficulty of reorienting the bureaucracy, but he says that 
A37 120 success in promoting trade is now part of every diplomat's 
A37 121 personnel file. With exports certain to be a front-burner issue in 
A37 122 Washington for years to come, the most vital of the diplomatic arts 
A37 123 may soon be the art of the deal.<p/>
A37 124 
A37 125 <h_><p_>Marriages Made in Air<p/>
A37 126 <p_>Are foreign airline deals good for America?<p/>
A37 127 <p_>Rich Thomas<p/><h/>
A37 128 <p_>Last week Continental Airlines announced that it would tie the 
A37 129 knot. There will be no dowry; Continental is already under 
A37 130 bankruptcy protection. But the new suitor, Air Canada, has deep 
A37 131 pockets, bringing $450 million to the marriage. Continental CEO 
A37 132 Robert Ferguson III said he's now looking for partners across the 
A37 133 Atlantic and Pacific to <quote_>"establish a global 
A37 134 presence."<quote/><p/>
A37 135 <p_>On the surface, the transaction is just another example of a 
A37 136 troubled airline looking for a savior. But the deal comes at a time 
A37 137 when everyone from politicians to air-freight-carriers is 
A37 138 questioning whether mergers between U.S. and foreign airlines are 
A37 139 good for America. In the short run, such deals seem to benefit 
A37 140 consumers. If, for example USAir and British Airways are permitted 
A37 141 to merge their routes as planned, an American traveler can soon 
A37 142 check her bags in Champaign, Ill., and fly a single air system 
A37 143 through to, say, Rome, or even Lilongwe in Malawi, in southern 
A37 144 Africa. Some 12,000 such city-to-city combinations would be made 
A37 145 possible by the merger. Wonderful, right? Maybe so, concedes 
A37 146 American Airlines CEO Robert Crandall. <quote_>"But in the long 
A37 147 run,"<quote/> Crandall says, <quote_>"the BA-USAir merger will 
A37 148 shaft <tf|>all Americans ... We'll be forced to cut back and lay 
A37 149 off employees. American choices and incomes will shrink."<quote/> 
A37 150 That's the sort of thing you'd expect a rival to say. But Ross 
A37 151 Perot and Bill Clinton also attacked the British Airways-USAir 
A37 152 hookup during their campaigns. The stand proved a touchy one: some 
A37 153 of Clinton's own people even contend that the 7,000 USAir jobs in 
A37 154 North Carolina were a big factor in Clinton's loss there - the only 
A37 155 state he targeted but did not win.<p/>
A37 156 <p_>It's no mystery why America's ailing airlines are looking for 
A37 157 affluent partners abroad: the industry has been in a deep recession 
A37 158 for five years. Passenger boardings and mileage earnings per 
A37 159 passenger, adjusted for inflation, have been almost flat since 
A37 160 1987. The foreign connections and capital could save several U.S. 
A37 161 lines. Some might fail anyway. But as Alfred Kahn, who launched 
A37 162 airline deregulation as Civil Aeronautics Board chairman under 
A37 163 Jimmy Carter, puts it: <quote_>"If we had only three or four 
A37 164 domestic airlines, I'd be nervous. But I'd feel perfectly safe 
A37 165 being supplied by seven or eight world-class companies. These 
A37 166 foreign deals are great insurance for America's fliers."<quote/><p/>
A37 167 <p_>While the deals could bail out struggling airlines, they 
A37 168 certainly won't help the stronger American carriers like American 
A37 169 and Delta. For one thing, U.S. airlines do not have equivalent 
A37 170 access to foreign markets. Most other nations bar foreign airlines 
A37 171 from domestic operations. Further, Britain has no airline that an 
A37 172 American line could buy and operate in local competition with 
A37 173 British Airways. No other large foreign country has a buyable big 
A37 174 airline either; almost all are government owned. (U.S.-Canadian air 
A37 175 relations have been more open, and American Airlines is seeking a 
A37 176 stake in Canada's second largest carrier.) In addition: Britain and 
A37 177 most other big countries severely limit <quote_>"beyond 
A37 178 rights,"<quote/> which would let carriers like United compete 
A37 179 internationally against, say, BA by picking up passengers in London 
A37 180 and flying them to cities in other countries. Crandall argues that 
A37 181 letting BA buy into the largest air market on earth without giving 
A37 182 U.S. carriers the same opportunity abroad is <quote_>"the 
A37 183 equivalent of unilateral economic disarmament."<quote/> And foreign 
A37 184 airlines are leery of such concessions: a report in The Journal of 
A37 185 Commerce last week said British Airways would rather scrap the 
A37 186 USAir deal than have the British government grant U.S. carriers 
A37 187 broader access to London's Heathrow airport.<p/>
A37 188 <p_>Little wonder, then, that Perot and Clinton opposed the 
A37 189 BA-USAir deal. Aware of their objections, Transportation Secretary 
A37 190 Andrew Card is negotiating furiously with the British this week to 
A37 191 open the British market. Delta, United and Federal Express are 
A37 192 poised to join American in suing to block the BA-USAir merger 
A37 193 unless more rights for them are forthcoming. The deal could also 
A37 194 encounter President Clinton's opposition after Jan. 20. But despite 
A37 195 Washington's wishes, the future holds fewer - and fewer U.S.-owned 
A37 196 - airlines. And that's a trend no politician can legislate away.<p/>
A37 197 
A37 198 <h_><p_>Billows of Smoke<p/>
A37 199 <p_>East Europe is desperate for cigarettes, and the West is happy 
A37 200 to oblige<p/><h/>
A37 201 <p_>A muddy field on the outskirts of Warsaw is not the obvious 
A37 202 place to search for a camel. But wait a while. By late 1993 the 
A37 203 small town of Piaseczno will possess one of the world's most modern 
A37 204 cigarette factories: a 9,500-square-meter plant owned by R.J. 
A37 205 Reynolds Tobacco International, part of America's second largest 
A37 206 cigarette empire. Once it is running at full capacity, the 
A37 207 Piaseczno factory will annually churn out 8 billion Camels, Monte 
A37 208 Carlos and other smokes in the Reynolds pack for Poland and its 
A37 209 neighbors. A gamble on the future? Not to company executives. 
A37 210 <quote_>"The market over here is so absorbent that even five 
A37 211 factories will not be enough,"<quote/> says Piotr Piwkowski, RJR's 
A37 212 Polish general manager.<p/>
A37 213 <p_>Anyone who has ever ducked into a smoke-clogged cafe in Warsaw, 
A37 214 Prague, Budapest or Moscow already knows that Eastern Europeans are 
A37 215 among the world's most enthusiastic puffers.

A38   1 <#FROWN:A38\><h_><p_>Temptations member Eddie Kendricks dies<p/>
A38   2 <p_>ASSOCIATED PRESS<p/><h/>
A38   3 <p_>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Eddie Kendricks, a founding member of the 
A38   4 Temptations who was the lead singer for such hits as 'The Way You 
A38   5 Do the Things You Do,' died Monday night of lung cancer. He was 
A38   6 52.<p/>
A38   7 <p_>Mr. Kendricks died at Baptist Medical Center-Princeton, said 
A38   8 spokeswoman Betty Ingram. He had been hospitalized since Sept. 
A38   9 25.<p/>
A38  10 <p_>Singer Stevie Wonder had visited Mr. Kendricks on Saturday.<p/>
A38  11 <p_>When the Temptations were formed in Detroit in 1961, the group 
A38  12 consisted of Kendricks, Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Paul 
A38  13 Williams and Elbridge Bryant. David Ruffin replaced Bryant in 1964 
A38  14 and the group signed with the Motown label.<p/>
A38  15 <p_>The group had its first No. 1 hit with 'My Girl' in 1965, 
A38  16 followed by 'It's Growing' and 'Since I Lost My Baby' that same 
A38  17 year.<p/>
A38  18 <p_><quote_>"Eddie just had that great, great tenor voice that just 
A38  19 was so captivating,"<quote/> Esther Edwards, the Temptations' first 
A38  20 manager and the sister of Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr., said 
A38  21 recently. <quote_>"He had such admirers, men and women. But the 
A38  22 ladies really loved Eddie and his style. ... He just had a sweet 
A38  23 melodious captivating tender sound."<quote/><p/>
A38  24 <p_>The Temptations went on to become Motown's most successful male 
A38  25 group, with more than a dozen hit singles. They trailed only the 
A38  26 Supremes for supremacy on the charts.<p/>
A38  27 <p_><quote_>"While the Four Tops covered the frenetic side of the 
A38  28 Motown sound and the Miracles monopolized its romantic side, the 
A38  29 Temptations quite simply stood as the finest vocal group in '60s 
A38  30 soul,"<quote/> Joe McEwen and Jim Miller wrote in the Rolling Stone 
A38  31 Illustrated History of Rock and Roll. <quote_>"They could 
A38  32 out-dress, out-dance and out-sing any competition in 
A38  33 sight."<quote/><p/>
A38  34 <p_>Mr. Kendricks began a solo career in 1971, but rejoined the 
A38  35 group in 1982 for a <quote|>"Reunion" tour. He was reunited with 
A38  36 the band again in 1989 as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll 
A38  37 Hall of Fame.<p/>
A38  38 <p_>Mr. Kendricks and Ruffin began working together after their 
A38  39 1985 album, 'Live at the Apollo,' with the singing duo Hall and 
A38  40 Oates.<p/>
A38  41 <p_>Williams killed himself in 1973, two years after he was asked 
A38  42 to leave the group because of alcoholism and related health 
A38  43 problems. Ruffin died last year from a drug overdose.<p/>
A38  44 <p_>Mr. Kendricks underwent surgery in Atlanta last year to have a 
A38  45 lung removed. He later said the disease was caused by 30 years of 
A38  46 smoking and he urged children not to smoke.<p/>

A38  48 <h_><p_>A strange vision all his own<p/>
A38  49 <p_>N.Y.'s Met adds new twist on surrealist Magritte<p/>
A38  50 <p_>By David Bonetti<p/>
A38  51 <p_>EXAMINER ART CRITIC<p/><h/>
A38  52 <p_>NEW YORK - Ren<*_>e-acute<*/> Magritte (1898-1967) remains, a 
A38  53 generation after his death, one of the most lively of the modern 
A38  54 masters who revolutionized art and the way we look at things.<p/>
A38  55 <p_>His representations are part of the modern lexicon of visual 
A38  56 images. Giant apples and roses expanding to fill entire rooms. 
A38  57 Tubas in flame. Pipes that are not pipes. Kissing lovers with 
A38  58 sheets wrapped around their heads. Night-darkened streets under 
A38  59 blue skies. Storms of raining men wearing bowler hats. Gigantic 
A38  60 boulders floating weightless in the sky. Thanks to advertising, 
A38  61 people who never heard of him recognize his disquieting work with 
A38  62 pleasure.<p/>
A38  63 <p_>The traveling retrospective, tersely titled 'Magritte,' shows 
A38  64 us the complete artist in 150 works in various mediums. (Organized 
A38  65 by the Hayward Gallery in London, it is at the Metropolitan Museum 
A38  66 through Nov. 22). Included are his seldom-seen and highly twisted 
A38  67 essays in impressionism and the crude jokester works he called his 
A38  68 <foreign|>vache (cow) paintings done during the late '40s in 
A38  69 occupied Brussels.<p/>
A38  70 <p_>Every responsible retrospective of a complex artist tries to 
A38  71 re-present him or her in a manner that makes sense to a 
A38  72 contemporary audience. The last great Magritte retrospective in the 
A38  73 United States took place in 1965-66. (It was the first major art 
A38  74 exhibition I saw, and I remember standing in front of the famous 
A38  75 painting of a pipe labeled <quote_>"This Is Not a Pipe"<quote/> 
A38  76 fascinated, but uneasily unsure of what it meant.)<p/>
A38  77 <p_>That exhibition aimed to show Magritte as a surrealist. That 
A38  78 might not seem so ambitious - after all, if Magritte wasn't a 
A38  79 surrealist, who was? But even as late as 1965 people had a hard 
A38  80 time seeing how he fit - he had had his differences with 
A38  81 Andr<*_>e-acute<*/> Breton, surrealism's dictator. Most people saw 
A38  82 him at best - or at worst - as a surrealist fellow traveler, a 
A38  83 Belgian provincial slightly out of step with Parisian 
A38  84 cosmopolites.<p/>
A38  85 <p_>The 1965 retrospective showed that being slightly out of step 
A38  86 was his virtue. Magritte had his own visions, and he remained true 
A38  87 to them. The dreams he depicted so laboriously in paint were 
A38  88 curiously apposite metaphors for 20th century experience. As the 
A38  89 shock of several of the Parisians faded, Magritte at his best 
A38  90 continued to tweak expectations.<p/>
A38  91 <p_>The current retrospective, curated by David Sylvester and Sarah 
A38  92 Whitfield, accepts Magritte's surrealism, and includes plenty of 
A38  93 paintings and objects where the surrealist goal to make strange the 
A38  94 everyday is clearly evident.<p/>
A38  95 <p_>What could be more surreal than 'Time Transfixed' (1938), a 
A38  96 painting with an image of a locomotive steaming out of a fireplace? 
A38  97 A thoroughly normal living room is utterly changed by the invasion 
A38  98 of a train, miniature in scale, but real. What makes the 
A38  99 incongruous juxtaposition surreally logical is that the opening of 
A38 100 the fireplace resembles the mouth of a railroad tunnel.<p/>
A38 101 <p_>All the elements of the pared-down picture contribute to its 
A38 102 theme. On the mantel is a clock with its time stopped at 12:43 - 
A38 103 has the train arrived on time? On either side of it are two 
A38 104 candlesticks empty of candles, traditional symbol in still lifes of 
A38 105 the irredeemable passage of time. Magritte is saying he doesn't 
A38 106 need to fall back on such hackneyed symbols to make his point. 
A38 107 Behind the clock is a mirror that reflects the clock's back and one 
A38 108 of the candlesticks, but which otherwise reflects only the gray 
A38 109 nothingness of the room, the existential void that is always the 
A38 110 real subject of Magritte's paintings.<p/>
A38 111 <p_>The current retrospective aims to make Magritte relevant by 
A38 112 showing him to be an early practitioner of conceptual art. Gathered 
A38 113 together are paintings that reveal his interest in linguistics and 
A38 114 appropriation of previously existing imagery, two popular 
A38 115 contemporary practices linked to conceptual art.<p/>
A38 116 <p_>Magritte's conceptualism is most evident in a group of 
A38 117 paintings from the late '20s that incorporate images and words.<p/>
A38 118 <p_>The most famous of these is 'The Treason of Images' (1929), the 
A38 119 painting of the pipe with the inscription <foreign_><quote_>"Ceci 
A38 120 n'est pas une pipe"<quote/><foreign/> (<quote_>"This Is Not a 
A38 121 Pipe"<quote/>). Of course it is not a pipe - it is a 
A38 122 <tf|>representation of a pipe, a painting realized on a flat canvas 
A38 123 surface with oil paint. Magritte is able to fool the eye. This 
A38 124 representation looks like a pipe - although it's so big, only a 
A38 125 giant could smoke it.<p/>
A38 126 <p_>The other word paintings are as interesting. 'The Palace of 
A38 127 Curtains' represents two identically shaped framed panels leaning 
A38 128 against the dado of a paneled room. One is a painted representation 
A38 129 of the sky; the other is the word <foreign|><quote|>"ciel" (sky). 
A38 130 The word is sufficient to conjure the image; the image is 
A38 131 sufficient to conjure the word. Which came first? Are they 
A38 132 equal?<p/>
A38 133 <p_>IN 'THE LITERAL Meaning,' two oddly shaped panels, one large, 
A38 134 one small, lean against the wall. The small one carries the word 
A38 135 <foreign|><quote|>"for<*_>e-circ<*/>t" (forest); the large one 
A38 136 <foreign|><quote|>"salon." Is painting the name of the image enough 
A38 137 to create the picture in the viewer's mind? (From the scale of the 
A38 138 words, the forest must be seen through a window in the salon.) In 
A38 139 another painting with the same title, the rounded framed panel on 
A38 140 the floor has the words <foreign_><quote_>"femme 
A38 141 triste"<quote/><foreign/> (sad woman). Is it too much to ask to see 
A38 142 her heaped on the floor in tears?<p/>
A38 143 <p_>Sometimes the images and words don't line up. In 'The 
A38 144 Interpretation of Dreams' (1935), the canvas is divided into 
A38 145 quadrants. An image of a horse is labeled <quote_>"the 
A38 146 door"<quote/>; a clock, <quote_>"the wind"<quote/>; a pitcher, 
A38 147 <quote_>"the bird"<quote/>; a valise, <quote_>"the valise."<quote/> 
A38 148 Words are free-floating signs that alight according to agreed-upon 
A38 149 convention, but what if they land on the wrong place? <tf_>What if 
A38 150 they land on the right place?<tf/><p/>
A38 151 <p_>Is it any wonder that both philosopher Michel Foucault and 
A38 152 semiotician Jacques Derrida have written books about Magritte?<p/>
A38 153 <p_>(Interestingly, Jasper Johns owns 'The Interpretation of 
A38 154 Dreams.' During the '60s, he painted a series of pictures in which 
A38 155 color panels were labeled, but wrongly. He would stencil 
A38 156 <quote|>"Yellow" over a rectangle of blue.)<p/>
A38 157 <p_>In a 1928 precursor to the series 'The Use of Speech,' Magritte 
A38 158 painted two splotches of brown on a gray ground. One blob is 
A38 159 labeled <foreign_><quote_>"corps de femme"<quote/><foreign/> (body 
A38 160 of a woman) and the other, <foreign|><quote|>"miroir" (mirror). 
A38 161 Both paint blobs are in this singular case not representations - 
A38 162 they <tf|>are blobs of paint, and out of them Magritte suggests he 
A38 163 can paint both a beautiful nude and her mirror reflection.<p/>
A38 164 <p_>Representation and the void behind it are Magritte's themes. In 
A38 165 other works from the late '20s and early '30s he codifies his 
A38 166 images as signs that recombine according to linguistic models to 
A38 167 make different visual meanings. In his formulation, paintings 
A38 168 correspond to sentences.<p/>
A38 169 <p_>IN 'THE SIX Elements' (1929), Magritte paints a six-paneled 
A38 170 freestanding object, each panel of which contains a different image 
A38 171 from his repertoire - a wall of fire, a nude female torso, a deep 
A38 172 forest, a window wall, a cloudy sky, a lead sheet fastened with 
A38 173 bells.<p/>
A38 174 <p_>In 'The Threshold of Liberty' (1930), the same elements - with 
A38 175 a panel of wood graining and a panel of paper cutouts added - form 
A38 176 the walls of a room. A cannon is aimed into the corner. Ready to 
A38 177 blast away his images, to which he has become enslaved, Magritte 
A38 178 announces himself to be on the threshold of liberty.<p/>
A38 179 <p_>As the rest of the exhibition shows, however, it was not so 
A38 180 easy to break the patterns of convention - even for a surrealist. 
A38 181 With the break of the six years during which he painted his hideous 
A38 182 impressionist pastiches and his <foreign|>'vache' paintings (which 
A38 183 show his disdain for a world that has gone out of its mind), 
A38 184 Magritte would continue to recirculate his ever-more-complex images 
A38 185 to achieve the sublime simplicity of his final works.<p/>

A38 187 <h_><p_>ACT hoping to find payoff in 'Creditors'
A38 188 <p_>Will first season under new director infuse passion, a new 
A38 189 aesthetic?<p/>
A38 190 <p_>By Nancy Scott<p/>
A38 191 <p_>OF THE EXAMINER STAFF<p/><h/>
A38 192 <p_>TRADITION HOLDS that the 19th century Swedish playwright August 
A38 193 Strindberg was a dour Nietzschean nut who overdosed on misogyny.<p/>
A38 194 <p_>Tradition could do itself a favor and go talk to Carey 
A38 195 Perloff.<p/>
A38 196 <p_>Perloff, who took over as artistic director for the American 
A38 197 Conservatory Theater in June, makes her directorial debut Wednesday 
A38 198 with Strindberg's 'Creditors,' the story of one woman and two men - 
A38 199 and a perfect shipwreck of a marriage.<p/>
A38 200 <p_>No matter that 'Creditors' is a dark horse, and Strindberg, 
A38 201 too, so far as most audiences are concerned. Perloff is practically 
A38 202 incandescent with enthusiasm. She knows the play well, has directed 
A38 203 it before (at New York's Classic Stage Company), believes that it 
A38 204 has infinite levels of meaning. <quote_>"I think,"<quote/> she 
A38 205 says, <quote_>"that it's an absolutely remarkable piece of 
A38 206 literature."<quote/> Strindberg, for her, is also absolutely 
A38 207 remarkable, and profoundly underrated in this country, and she 
A38 208 will, by God, help us to discover him.<p/>
A38 209 <p_>Discovery appears to be Perloff's middle name (thus inspiring 
A38 210 this year's ACT slogan: <quote_>"A Season of Discovery"<quote/>). 
A38 211 By implication we shall find treasure. Could be bits of old rubbish 
A38 212 here and there, too. Time will tell.<p/>
A38 213 <p_>As the opener for ACT's 1992-93 season, 'Creditors' marks a 
A38 214 shift in the wind for a company that has lived through a couple of 
A38 215 serious storms this past decade. First, in 1986, came the departure 
A38 216 of ACT founder William Ball, who left under what may be charitably 
A38 217 called a cloud. Then came the 1989 earthquake, which ravaged the 
A38 218 Geary Theatre, ACT's home since 1967.<p/>
A38 219 <p_>Under the guidance of Edward Hastings, who took over following 
A38 220 Ball's departure, ACT survived with honor, expanding its roster of 
A38 221 actors and its repertory to include plays and performers of color, 
A38 222 and this was worth cheering, but there was also something missing.

A39   1 <#FROWN:A39\><h_><p_>Kirov kicks in for 'Nutcracker' centennial<p/>
A39   2 <p_>By MAGGIE HALL<p/>
A39   3 <p_>Special to the Tribune<p/><h/>
A39   4 <p_>ST. PETERSBURG - This year will mark the 100th birthday of 'The 
A39   5 Nutcracker', the only ballet that has wide appeal in the United 
A39   6 States. Since the 1950s, it has become an important part of our 
A39   7 Christmas traditions.<p/>
A39   8 <p_>The holidays wouldn't glitter as brightly without the Sugar 
A39   9 Plum Fairy, dancing candy canes and the Nutcracker's battle with 
A39  10 the wicked Mouse King.<p/>
A39  11 <p_>For much of this century, Peter Illych Tchaikovsky's classic 
A39  12 ballet about a doll who comes to life and transports a little girl 
A39  13 to a wonderland of dance wasn't the hit it is now. Thanks to an 
A39  14 opulent production by George Balanchine in 1954, the New York City 
A39  15 Ballet's version set the standard for future 'Nutcrackers.'<p/>
A39  16 <p_>This year, St. Petersburg will be the host for another 
A39  17 'Nutcracker' milestone. To celebrate the ballet's centennial year, 
A39  18 the Dance Theatre of Florida and the Kirov Ballet will collaborate 
A39  19 for 10 performances at the Mahaffey Theater Dec. 11-13 and Dec. 
A39  20 17-20.<p/>
A39  21 <p_>Dancers from the Kirov - keepers of the flame of classical 
A39  22 ballet and one of the more respected companies in the world - and 
A39  23 the St. Petersburg dance ensemble will perform a 'Nutcracker' as 
A39  24 Russian audiences might have seen it a century ago.<p/>
A39  25 <p_><quote_>"Many companies have done the ballet and some of them 
A39  26 have given their unique interpretation,"<quote/> said M.A. 
A39  27 Musselman, the Dance Theatre of Florida's president. <quote_>"This 
A39  28 version is going to be true to the original. It won't be a 
A39  29 futuristic one. It will be an old-fashioned 
A39  30 'Nutcracker.'"<quote/><p/>
A39  31 <h_><p_><quote_>"Chance of a lifetime"<quote/><p/><h/>
A39  32 <p_>The joint production will see 12 to 15 Kirov dancers in the 
A39  33 divertissements of the second act, except for 'Waltz of the 
A39  34 Flowers' and the Snow pas de deux. Dance Theatre children and 
A39  35 dancers from its group will fill those roles. Kirov dancers will 
A39  36 join them in the first act to play toys in the party scenes.<p/>
A39  37 <p_><quote_>"This is basically the chance of a lifetime, a 
A39  38 once-in-a-century thing,"<quote/> said M.A. Musselman's husband 
A39  39 Sean, who is artistic director of the Dance Theatre of Florida.<p/>
A39  40 <p_>Sean Musselman and Oleg Vinogradov, artistic director of the 
A39  41 Kirov Ballet, presented plans for their joint production of 'The 
A39  42 Nutcracker' at a recent news conference in St. Petersburg.<p/>
A39  43 <p_>Tickets for the centennial performances are on sale at the 
A39  44 Bayfront Center and through TicketMaster. Prices are $30, $24, $19 
A39  45 and $14 plus a service charge. For more information, call the 
A39  46 Bayfront Center box office at (813) 892-5767 or TicketMaster at 
A39  47 (813) 287-8844.<p/>
A39  48 <p_>Vinogradov has been the Kirov's artistic director since 1977. 
A39  49 Then only 40, he had made his mark as a choreographer for the Kirov 
A39  50 and Bolshoi and as a ballet director.<p/>
A39  51 <p_>Following in the footsteps of 19th-century genius Marius Petipa 
A39  52 didn't faze Vinogradov. He opened up the Kirov's repertory to 
A39  53 include works by foreigners such as Maurice Bejart and Roland 
A39  54 Petit, a first for the tightly structured Russian ballet 
A39  55 establishment.<p/>
A39  56 <p_>Last year, the Kirov let in more fresh air with works by 
A39  57 British choreographer Antony Tudor and George Balanchine, a master 
A39  58 who learned his craft at the Kirov early in the century.<p/>
A39  59 <p_>Before Vinogradov's staging of pieces such as 'Scotch Symphony' 
A39  60 during Kirov's most recent tour, Balanchine's work had never been 
A39  61 presented by a Russian company.<p/>
A39  62 <p_>Vinogradov solidified plans for the St. Petersburg run with the 
A39  63 Musselmans when he invited them to see his company perform 'Swan 
A39  64 Lake' in New York this summer. The Tampa Bay area girls sharing the 
A39  65 role of Clara, the character who is given the Nutcracker doll in 
A39  66 the ballet, will travel with the Musselmans and chaperones to 
A39  67 Russia this fall.<p/>
A39  68 <p_>At Vinogradov's invitation, they will see the premiere of the 
A39  69 Kirov's own centennial production of 'The Nutcracker' on Oct. 
A39  70 25.<p/>
A39  71 <p_>The recent visit to the Tampa Bay area was Vinogradov's first 
A39  72 chance to look over the Mahaffey Theater's facilities before 
A39  73 staging begins on the centennial 'Nutcracker.'<p/>
A39  74 <h_><p_>Back to his roots<p/><h/>
A39  75 <p_>The collaboration with the Kirov is a return to roots for Sean 
A39  76 Musselman. He formed the Dance Theatre of Florida in 1986 after 
A39  77 dancing with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, the Chicago City Ballet, 
A39  78 Milwaukee Ballet and other companies, but his training is pure 
A39  79 Balanchine.<p/>
A39  80 <p_>Musselman studied at the school of American Ballet (SAB), New 
A39  81 York City ballet's training ground. While at the school that 
A39  82 Balanchine founded, Musselman was in the last SAB generation to 
A39  83 work under the great choreographer before illness forced him to 
A39  84 retire.<p/>
A39  85 <p_>Even though he is the choreographer and artistic director of 
A39  86 the Dance Theatre of Florida, Sean Musselman is still dancing at 32 
A39  87 and teaching at the company's ballet school. He danced the role of 
A39  88 the Cavalier in last year's Dance Theatre production of 'The 
A39  89 Nutcracker.'<p/>
A39  90 <p_>In the centennial show, he will dance the Snow pas de deux with 
A39  91 a dancer from the Kirov.<p/>
A39  92 <p_><quote_>"I think that some of the best ones from the Kirov are 
A39  93 coming because Oleg is very excited about doing this,"<quote/> said 
A39  94 Musselman.<p/>
A39  95 <p_>The fanfare surrounding the centennial of 'The Nutcracker' 
A39  96 would have surprised Tchaikovsky; the composer considered his own 
A39  97 score inferior. It was never a big hit in Russia, but Balanchine 
A39  98 had a fondness for it after playing small parts in it and then 
A39  99 graduating to dancing the role of the Nutcracker Prince in his 
A39 100 youth.<p/>
A39 101 <p_>Because of Balanchine's production, Americans are the world's 
A39 102 only 'Nutcracker' fanatics.<p/>
A39 103 
A39 104 <h_><p_>Americans were obsessed by phrenology<p/>
A39 105 <p_>By JOHN BARRAT<p/>
A39 106 <p_>of the Smithsonian News Service<p/><h/>
A39 107 <p_>His bald head is as white and shiny as a porcelain bathtub, 
A39 108 tattooed with a curious diagram of lines and letters. Many once 
A39 109 believed this prophet, who claimed to have solved the age-old 
A39 110 mysteries of the human mind.<p/>
A39 111 <p_>Today, antique and forgotten, he stares blankly into space from 
A39 112 a storage shelf inside the Smithsonian's National Museum of 
A39 113 American History in Washington, D.C.<p/>
A39 114 <p_>Meet the Phrenological Man, a life-size bust from one of the 
A39 115 oddest social movements in American history. Fashioned in the 
A39 116 mid-1800s by a New Yorker named Lorenzo Fowler, this porcelain head 
A39 117 was once used to teach the wonders of phrenology - <quote_>"the 
A39 118 science of the mind"<quote/> - to the American public.<p/>
A39 119 <p_>For centuries people have struggled to understand the 
A39 120 relationship between human actions and the processes of the 
A39 121 brain.<p/>
A39 122 <p_>Today, a procedure known as Positron Emissions Tomography - 
A39 123 which measures levels of neuron activity in the brain - is one 
A39 124 high-tech method neuroscientists use to learn which areas of the 
A39 125 brain relate to human activities and emotions. Scientists have 
A39 126 confirmed much of the PET-scan work with Magnetic Resonance 
A39 127 Imaging, a faster technology. Still, exactly what is 
A39 128 <}_><-|>going<+|>going on<}/>in those areas of the brain remains a 
A39 129 deep mystery.<p/>
A39 130 <h_><p_>Skull topography<p/><h/>
A39 131 <p_>Not to phrenologists. From 1832 into the 1900s, itinerant 
A39 132 phrenologists traveled from town to town in America, solemnly 
A39 133 handling people's heads before large crowds and preaching that 
A39 134 human character could be learned from the topography of the 
A39 135 skull.<p/>
A39 136 <p_><quote_>"Phrenologists believed the strength of each faculty 
A39 137 determined the physical size of the specific part of the brain in 
A39 138 which it was located, and that the shape of the brain determined 
A39 139 the shape of the skull that surrounded it,"<quote/> Michael Sokal, 
A39 140 a historian at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, 
A39 141 Mass., explained at a recent lecture at the National Museum of 
A39 142 American History.<p/>
A39 143 <p_>An individual's combative organ, for example, was supposedly 
A39 144 located <quote_>"an inch and a half behind the tops of the 
A39 145 ears."<quote/> If a person's skull bulged at this spot, his or her 
A39 146 combative tendencies were high.<p/>
A39 147 <p_>By combining all of an individual's faculties, phrenologists 
A39 148 believed that they could draw an accurate reading of his or her 
A39 149 character. By exercising certain organs with specific thoughts, 
A39 150 phrenologists believed a person could willfully change the shape of 
A39 151 his or her skull.<p/>
A39 152 <p_>Although today phrenology is widely regarded as fraud and 
A39 153 fakery, <quote_>"an understanding of any past science requires 
A39 154 careful analysis of the context in which it developed,"<quote/> 
A39 155 Sokal says. <quote_>"It's all <}_><-|>to<+|>too<}/> easy to dismiss 
A39 156 what isn't fully understood."<quote/><p/>
A39 157 <p_>Phrenology originated in Vienna, Austria, in the late-18th and 
A39 158 early-19th centuries when physician and brain-research pioneer 
A39 159 Franz Joseph Gall observed that students with good memories also 
A39 160 had striking eyes. From this, he inferred that human memory was 
A39 161 located in the part of the brain directly behind the eye. Gall went 
A39 162 on to assign more than 30 other human faculties to specific brain 
A39 163 regions.<p/>
A39 164 <h_><p_>Austrian scientist<p/><h/>
A39 165 <p_>Phrenology made its American debut in New England in 1832, when 
A39 166 a visiting Gall protege, Austrian scientist Johann Spurzheim, gave 
A39 167 a series of popular lectures and occasionally demonstrated a brain 
A39 168 dissection. Spurzheim died in the United States and was followed in 
A39 169 1838 by another reputable phrenologist, Englishman George Combe.<p/>
A39 170 <p_>America's highways during this time were frequented by 
A39 171 <quote_>"salesmen of all kinds - peddlers with knapsacks, people 
A39 172 selling patent medicines, lecturers, religious people, musical 
A39 173 performers, circuses and carnivals,"<quote/> explains Roger 
A39 174 Sherman, a historian at the Museum of American History.<p/>
A39 175 <p_>Men (and a few women) of all ages studied phrenology's easily 
A39 176 learned principles, bought a few books, charts and busts, and set 
A39 177 out on the lecture circuit. Phrenology was transformed from a 
A39 178 scientific theory into a sort of pseudoscientific character 
A39 179 analysis akin to palm reading. It was great entertainment.<p/>
A39 180 <p_>Before the Civil War, itinerant phrenologists blanketed the 
A39 181 countryside 'reading' thousands of heads and doling out advice on 
A39 182 everything from marriage to child rearing, careers, health, 
A39 183 religion, personal happiness and even sex.<p/>
A39 184 <p_><quote_>"They'd typically hire a town hall or a large church 
A39 185 and open their visit with a free lecture at which they'd sell books 
A39 186 and charts,"<quote/> Sokal says. Lecturers demonstrated their skill 
A39 187 by randomly examining heads from the audience - sometimes while 
A39 188 blindfolded.<p/>
A39 189 <h_><p_><quote_>"Private readings"<quote/><p/><h/>
A39 190 <p_>The phrenologist's bread and butter, Sokal explains, came from 
A39 191 <quote_>"a series of private readings conducted on a fee basis, 
A39 192 often at hotels, on mornings and afternoons before each 
A39 193 lecture."<quote/><p/>
A39 194 <p_>Among American phrenologists, none achieved greater recognition 
A39 195 than Orson and Lorenzo Fowler, two brothers who, in 1835, opened a 
A39 196 'Phrenological Cabinet,' or museum, in New York City, which 
A39 197 eventually contained hundreds of busts, including busts of 
A39 198 Michelangelo, pirates, thieves and a Bengal tiger.<p/>
A39 199 <p_>The Fowlers lectured widely, employed a number of traveling 
A39 200 phrenologists and published many books with copious titles such as 
A39 201 'Marriage: Its History and Ceremonies; with a Phrenological and 
A39 202 Physiological Exposition of the Functions and Qualifications for 
A39 203 Happy Marriages.'<p/>
A39 204 <p_>Most major U.S. cities had their own libraries, club rooms and 
A39 205 collections of plaster busts. Employers asked for written 
A39 206 phrenological examinations from job applicants, and women wore 
A39 207 their hair in ways that showed their best phrenological qualities. 
A39 208 A number of famous citizens had readings done, including President 
A39 209 James Garfield, abolitionist John Brown and poet Walt Whitman.<p/>
A39 210 <p_>Many people didn't buy into the phrenology craze, and it was 
A39 211 criticized widely. The Fowlers embraced the criticism, however, and 
A39 212 used it as a springboard for publicity. They fervently believed in 
A39 213 and defended their 'science.'<p/>
A39 214 <p_>Modern scientists can find no rational basis for the principles 
A39 215 and techniques of phrenology. According to Sokal, phrenology owed 
A39 216 much of its success to practitioners who gave character readings 
A39 217 <quote_>"so vague and general that they could apply to almost 
A39 218 anybody."<quote/><p/>
A39 219 <p_>Like a mix between Sherlock Holmes and P.T. Barnum, 
A39 220 phrenologists became expert showmen who used small details of a 
A39 221 subject's clothing, mannerisms, hands, reactions and even their 
A39 222 smell to draw up convincing character profiles.<p/>
A39 223 <p_>After the Civil War, a more skeptical nation lost faith in 
A39 224 phrenology. By the early 1900s, phrenology was a closed chapter in 
A39 225 the history of American science.<p/>

A39 233 <p_>Then, happily, TV got a little more serious.<p/>
A39 234 <p_>Witness - please! - 'The Water Engine,' which premieres on 
A39 235 cable's TNT channel tonight at 8, followed immediately by two 
A39 236 repeat showings.<p/>
A39 237 <p_>Kicking off a series of original films called TNT Screenworks, 
A39 238 'The Water Engine' is a deadly serious look at the American Dream, 
A39 239 written by the celebrated dramatist David Mamet.<p/>
A39 240 <p_>Its impressive cast includes Joe Mantegna, John Mahoney, Patti 
A39 241 LuPone, Charles Durning and Treat Williams. It is engrossing and 
A39 242 disturbing. It's even entertaining.<p/>

A40   2 <p_><*_>square<*/>Demographically, it makes sense for pop music to 
A40   3 court the over-30 crowd. But that has been slow to happen.<p/>
A40   4 <p_>By Bruce Britt<p/>
A40   5 <p_>LOS ANGELES DAILY NEWS<p/><h/>
A40   6 <p_>Is the pop-music industry committing financial suicide by 
A40   7 alienating the music's older fans? In an industry so blinded by 
A40   8 youth, it appears that the smaller players are the ones creating a 
A40   9 ground<?_>-<?/>swell of support for music by and for people in the 
A40  10 30-to-50 age range.<p/>
A40  11 <p_>Rock 'n' rollers in their 30s and 40s with lingering dreams of 
A40  12 making it in pop music have only a slight chance of getting signed 
A40  13 to major, rock-oriented labels. Rock 'n' roll is traditionally a 
A40  14 young person's industry, and aging signs such as a receding 
A40  15 hairline or a paunch take a performer out of the rock 'n' roll 
A40  16 sweepstakes.<p/>
A40  17 <p_>But recent trends indicate that adult pop and rock is a gold 
A40  18 mine waiting to be explored. Though the record industry is still 
A40  19 youth-oriented, it seems that yuppie musicians and consumers are 
A40  20 quietly waging a revolution that is putting a dent in rock record 
A40  21 and concert sales.<p/>
A40  22 <p_>Country music sales and radio ratings are soaring - an 
A40  23 intriguing turn of events in light of the fact that 30-ish 'new 
A40  24 country' pioneers such as Garth Brooks, Billy Ray Cyrus, Travis 
A40  25 Tritt and the Kentucky HeadHunters<&|>sic! specialize in a 
A40  26 distilled brand of Southern rock 'n' roll. Older established 
A40  27 rockers are getting into country as well. For example, Don Henley 
A40  28 has collaborated with singer Trisha Yearwood and recorded in 
A40  29 Nashville.<p/>
A40  30 <p_>Henley isn't the only one flirting with the country business. 
A40  31 Ken Kragen used to manage such rock and pop heavyweights as the Bee 
A40  32 Gees, Lionel Richie and the J. Geils Band. Now Kragen deals almost 
A40  33 exclusively with country acts such as Tritt. Kragen and other 
A40  34 insiders believe Nashville could supplant Los Angeles as the 
A40  35 nation's music capital.<p/>
A40  36 <p_><quote_>"Though the country business is becoming more 
A40  37 complicated all the time, it is still easier to deal with than 
A40  38 pop,"<quote/> Kragen said. <quote_>"Country music is probably the 
A40  39 most exciting trend in music right now. You hear radio stations 
A40  40 touting their 'new country' or 'hot country' sound."<quote/><p/>
A40  41 <p_><quote_>"Maybe that's the lesson our country cousins are 
A40  42 teaching us,"<quote/> said Phil Walden, president of Capricorn 
A40  43 Records. <quote_>"Music - not age or anything else - is the most 
A40  44 important thing."<quote/><p/>
A40  45 <p_>Capricorn's hottest acts are involved in the burgeoning 
A40  46 'neo-hippie' movement, which is gaining record- and concert-sales 
A40  47 steam every day. Blues Traveler, Spin Doctors and Col. Bruce 
A40  48 Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit - older and thoroughly 
A40  49 unglamorous bands that play countrified rock, blues and jazz - are 
A40  50 such popular concert attractions that a theme tour recently was 
A40  51 organized to satisfy the demand for these performing warhorses.<p/>
A40  52 <p_>Other trends indicate that adults are begging to be courted by 
A40  53 the music industry. Ratings at adult contemporary radio stations 
A40  54 are on the upswing, and older acts such as Steve Miller, Jimmy 
A40  55 Buffett and the Grateful Dead have continued to draw sellout 
A40  56 crowds, while rock-oriented packages continue to struggle to draw 
A40  57 fans.<p/>
A40  58 <p_>Some of the biggest sleeper successes in recent years have been 
A40  59 major-label baby-boomer acts, with Bonnie Raitt, Michael Bolton and 
A40  60 Natalie Cole creating the peak. All these acts struggled to win 
A40  61 creative control and break out of the rigid, youth-oriented visions 
A40  62 the music industry had dictated to them.<p/>
A40  63 <p_>In contrast to all this adult-oriented activity, rock record 
A40  64 sales slowly have been declining since the mid-1980s, while country 
A40  65 and other music forms have been enjoying steady gains, according to 
A40  66 Recording Industry Association of America's Statistical Overview 
A40  67 for 1991.<p/>
A40  68 <p_>Some theorize that Nashville is enjoying renewed popularity 
A40  69 because of the country music industry's more inclusive nature. 
A40  70 Walden's Capricorn Records put Southern rock on the map in the 
A40  71 1970s with such acts as the Allman Brothers Band and the Marshall 
A40  72 Tucker Band. Walden attributed country music's resurgence on the 
A40  73 country industry's more inclusive nature.<p/>
A40  74 <p_><quote_>"I think country is more willing to take in refugees 
A40  75 from rock n' roll<&|>sic! and allow them the space to redefine 
A40  76 themselves in some country context,"<quote/> Walden said. 
A40  77 <quote_>"Country is expanding rather than restricting, where rock 
A40  78 is quite the opposite."<quote/><p/>
A40  79 <p_>Inclusiveness is a buzzword used by Walden and other 
A40  80 independent label heads, who are courting older rock and pop 
A40  81 consumers. Walden, who recently reactivated his company after a 
A40  82 decadelong absence, said the secret of his success is simple.<p/>
A40  83 <p_><quote_>"I really think, in terms of the new hippie movement, 
A40  84 the emphasis is primarily on the music,"<quote/> Walden said.<p/>
A40  85 <p_>Walden's comment must resonate with well-known former teen 
A40  86 idols such as Ringo Starr and David Cassidy - acts with built-in 
A40  87 cult followings who have had to sign deals with independent labels. 
A40  88 Older rock acts able or fortunate enough to finagle a major label 
A40  89 deal claim they are often persuaded to sing about adolescent 
A40  90 concerns rather than from a more mature perspective.<p/>
A40  91 <p_><quote_>"It frustrates me that [record industry] people can't 
A40  92 see a way forward for a band like the Who,"<quote/> said former Who 
A40  93 singer Roger Daltrey. <quote_>"It frustrates me that some of the 
A40  94 best musicians in rock 'n' roll are our age and don't seem to be 
A40  95 able to put their emotions into music."<quote/><p/>
A40  96 <p_>Daltrey is lucky - at least he has a legacy that makes him more 
A40  97 appealing to record company talent scouts. But there are many older 
A40  98 rock 'n' roll lovers who will probably never get the chance.<p/>
A40  99 <p_>Sterling Haug is founder of the Musicians Contact Service, a 
A40 100 Hollywood-based referral service. He said at least half of his 
A40 101 clientele consists of musicians in their 30s still struggling to 
A40 102 break into the big time.<p/>
A40 103 <p_><quote_>"You have to consider that everybody lies about their 
A40 104 age by about five years, so there are a lot of guys around 40 still 
A40 105 playing original material and trying to break through,"<quote/> 
A40 106 Haug said.<p/>
A40 107 <p_>Though trends would suggest an adult pop phenomenon would be 
A40 108 well-received by consumers, some experts say mature music is a very 
A40 109 hard sell. Ron Goldstein is president and chief executive officer 
A40 110 of Private Records, a Los Angeles-based company with a largely 
A40 111 adult-oriented pop roster that includes Starr, guitarist Leo Kottke 
A40 112 and Andy Summers, formerly of the Police. He said it is difficult 
A40 113 winning exposure for older acts.<p/>
A40 114 <p_><quote_>"Some guy in the industry might think, 'Hey, Carole 
A40 115 King is still around, and she's still in good voice. I'd like to 
A40 116 sign her',"<quote/> Goldstein said. <quote_>"But then he's got to 
A40 117 consider how he's going to get her on radio or how he's going to 
A40 118 get any exposure for her. That's just part of the battle record 
A40 119 companies face."<quote/><p/>
A40 120 <p_>Goldstein believes that for the music industry to reach 30- to 
A40 121 50-year-old consumers, existing promotional methods such as radio 
A40 122 must invent a format specifically geared toward baby boomers. Adult 
A40 123 contemporary radio, Goldstein claims, is almost as rigid as the Top 
A40 124 40.<p/>
A40 125 <p_>In addition, he suggested that other avenues, such as direct 
A40 126 mail marketing, should be explored. That would allow record 
A40 127 companies to bypass radio, television and MTV altogether and take 
A40 128 it straight to the consumers.<p/>

A40 130 <h_><p_>Fox's 'young' shows are old and tired<p/>
A40 131 <p_><p_>By Greg Dawson<p/>
A40 132 <p_>SENTINEL TELEVISION CRITIC<p/><h/>
A40 133 <p_>The Fox network has publicly tabbed 18 to 34 as its prime 
A40 134 demographic target. The producers of <tf|>Martin and <tf_>The 
A40 135 Heights<tf/> must have thought they were talking about IQs, not 
A40 136 ages.<p/>
A40 137 <p_><tf|>Martin, a hyperactive sitcom about a brash, young radio 
A40 138 talk<?_>-<?/>show host, assaults the senses with decibels and 
A40 139 dumbbells. If this were the Olympics, you might want to have 
A40 140 <tf|>Martin tested for steroid use.<p/>
A40 141 <p_><tf_>The Heights<tf/>, another Aaron Spelling fashion statement 
A40 142 masquerading as a drama, is Spelling's attempt to get a third cup 
A40 143 of tea from the same soggy bag that yielded <tf_>Beverly Hills, 
A40 144 90210<tf/> and <tf_>Melrose Place<tf/>, and it's a mighty thin 
A40 145 brew, indeed.<p/>
A40 146 <p_>Together, these series demonstrate how shows can scream 
A40 147 <quote|>"young!" in every way and still seem achingly old and 
A40 148 tired.<p/>
A40 149 <p_>It's possible to feel some regret over <tf|>Martin as a lost 
A40 150 opportunity. The star, stand-up comic Martin Lawrence has loads of 
A40 151 natural charm and operates smoothly in the sitcom format. But he's 
A40 152 undermined by relentlessly horrid writing.<p/>
A40 153 <p_>His character, a Detroit talk<?_>-<?/>show host, is a grating 
A40 154 hybrid that combines the snickering macho arrogance of Eddie Murphy 
A40 155 and the cloying, puppy-dog cuteness of Bill Cosby in his bedroom 
A40 156 scenes with Phylicia Rashad on <tf_>The Cosby Show<tf/>.<p/>
A40 157 <p_>One minute Martin is strutting an obnoxious under-my-thumb 
A40 158 brand of chauvinism to impress his Neanderthal buddies, the next 
A40 159 he's on his knees whimpering for forgiveness from his girlfriend 
A40 160 (Tisha Campbell). It might be laughable if it weren't so 
A40 161 pathetic.<p/>
A40 162 <p_>Martin, known for his comedy work on HBO, arrives with a 
A40 163 reputation as a gifted mimic. Besides the title character, Martin 
A40 164 plays his nosy mother and a busty love machine across the hall 
A40 165 named Sheneneh. But they just seem like Lawrence in bad wigs. He 
A40 166 never goes beyond dress-up to create a distinct character, the way 
A40 167 Flip Wilson did with Geraldine.<p/>
A40 168 <p_>Nor do Lawrence and his producers do anything interesting with 
A40 169 the talk-show format. The studio is just another set for the 
A40 170 delivery of bad lines. Adrift in this debacle is Garret Morris 
A40 171 (<tf_>Saturday Night Live<tf/>), playing the manager of Martin's 
A40 172 radio station.<p/>
A40 173 <p_>Let us travel now from the depths of comedy to <tf_>The 
A40 174 Heights<tf/> of commercial exploitation.<p/>
A40 175 <p_>It's not uncommon for TV producers to copy themselves, but two 
A40 176 times in less than two years? Spelling's <tf|>90210 begat 
A40 177 <tf_>Melrose Place<tf/>, which created a market for <tf_>The 
A40 178 Heights<tf/> - same song, different verse.<p/>
A40 179 <p_><tf_>The Heights<tf/> looks less like a drama than it does a 
A40 180 product tie-in, the product being all the accouterments of youth 
A40 181 culture, from jeans to music videos.<p/>
A40 182 <p_>In a nutshell - which is plenty large enough to hold the 
A40 183 originality that went into it - <tf_>The Heights<tf/> is about 
A40 184 young people who couldn't afford the rent at Melrose Place, an 
A40 185 upscale West Hollywood address.<p/>
A40 186 <p_>Whereas the residents of <tf_>Melrose Place<tf/> are aspiring 
A40 187 actors and artists and doctors, the denizens of <tf_>The 
A40 188 Heights<tf/> hold down classic blue-collar jobs such as auto 
A40 189 mechanic, beer truck dispatcher, produce clerk and plumber's 
A40 190 assistant - all portrayed as purgatories to be escaped from at the 
A40 191 earliest opportunity.<p/>
A40 192 <p_>In their off-hours (when they aren't striding six abreast down 
A40 193 the street, the better to model their 'look') these sons and 
A40 194 daughters of the working class play in a rock band - their ticket 
A40 195 out of the unspeakable agony of real jobs.<p/>
A40 196 <p_>Pretension and phoniness greet you on every corner in <tf_>The 
A40 197 Heights<tf/>. This is the sort of show in which a drop-dead 
A40 198 beautiful character (Cheryl Pollak) says to a pursuing guy (James 
A40 199 Walters), <quote_>"I don't get it. All this romance. Why 
A40 200 me?"<quote/><p/>
A40 201 <p_>It isn't exactly clear where The Heights is. What is clear is 
A40 202 that if these fresh-faced youth without a callous among them are 
A40 203 blue-collar, I'm Ron Rice the suntan lotion king.<p/>
A40 204 <p_>Trying to follow the interchangeable cast parts of these 
A40 205 Spelling brands reminds me of the sign above airport luggage 
A40 206 carousels: <quote_>"Many bags look alike."<quote/><p/>
A40 207 <p_>I would suggest Aaron Spelling heed the comment of a character 
A40 208 in <tf_>The Heights<tf/> who says of their sound-alike band, 
A40 209 <quote_>"We need to do an original."<quote/><p/>

A40 211 <h_><p_>A fresh TV idea set in the 1300s<p/>
A40 212 <p_>By Greg Dawson<p/>
A40 213 <p_>SENTINEL TELEVISION CRITIC<p/>
A40 214 <p_>Everyone's Irish on St. Patrick's Day, and when the new fall TV 
A40 215 season rolls around (in late summer now), everyone's from Missouri: 
A40 216 Viewers are in a show-me state of mind as in, 'Show me something 
A40 217 new.'<p/>
A40 218 <p_>So the networks give us a couple dozen comedies and dramas with 
A40 219 all the freshness of discount bread. There are exceptions, of 
A40 220 course, and tonight the new fall season lives up to its billing as 
A40 221 ABC premieres <tf_>Covington Cross<tf/>, the boldest deviator from 
A40 222 the norm among the 33 new series.<p/>
A40 223 <p_>The schedule is jammed with family sitcoms and dramas, but 
A40 224 <tf_>Covington Cross<tf/> is the only one set in 14th-century 
A40 225 England and filmed on location in and around a real castle, with a 
A40 226 mostly British cast.<p/>
A40 227 <p_>It's a hoot - a high-spirited, handsomely mounted, 
A40 228 tongue-in-cheek romp that blithely mixes swordplay and slapstick, 
A40 229 feudalism and feminism, in a whimsical meeting of the 1390s and the 
A40 230 1990s.<p/>
A40 231 <p_>This is the story of a widowed dad, Sir Thomas Gray (Nigel 
A40 232 Terry), who could be Fred MacMurray in <tf_>My Three Sons<tf/>, 
A40 233 except that he has a beautiful daughter (Ione Skye) in addition to 
A40 234 three rambunctious sons, and he carries a broadsword instead of a 
A40 235 briefcase to work.<p/>

A41   1 <#FROWN:A41\><h_><p_>Fairy Tale<p/>
A41   2 <p_>by Karen Bair<p/>
A41   3 <p_>Features Writer<p/><h/>
A41   4 <p_><tf_>Once upon a time, a determined, dark-eyed ballerina 
A41   5 traveled to a dangerous city called New York. She danced principal 
A41   6 roles with famous people from the United States and Russia in one 
A41   7 of the best ballet companies in the world, and they traveled the 
A41   8 globe.<p/>
A41   9 <p_>A tall, dark, handsome man also journeyed to New York to learn 
A41  10 to dance with beautiful ballerinas. Because he was tall, he played 
A41  11 the princely roles.<p/>
A41  12 <p_>At about the same time, a dainty little ballerina ventured to 
A41  13 New York. She was so naive, she did not know enough to be 
A41  14 frightened. She danced elegantly with one of the world's most 
A41  15 respected danseurs.<p/>
A41  16 <p_>They danced to the edge of their world.<p/>
A41  17 <p_>Many of their dreams came true. Some did not. It was not easy, 
A41  18 but they knew when the time had come to pursue new dreams.<p/>
A41  19 <p_>It happened that their new paths wound to a magical Southern 
A41  20 city with grand oak trees and gracefully swaying Spanish moss.<p/>
A41  21 <p_>The dark-eyed ballerina and the tall, princely danseur danced 
A41  22 there together for the first time. They fell in love and 
A41  23 married.<p/>
A41  24 <p_>Before she had left New York, the tiny ballerina was hurt and 
A41  25 decided she would never dance again. But when she came to the 
A41  26 Southern city, a friend convinced her to put on her toe shoes. She 
A41  27 danced, and danced, and soon was dancing with the dark-eyed 
A41  28 ballerina and the princely danseur. Then she fell in love, too, and 
A41  29 married a handsome local television newsman.<p/>
A41  30 <p_>And so ...<tf/><p/>
A41  31 <p_>The room - with its barre, mirrors and American Ballet Theatre 
A41  32 posters from around the globe - is alive with dancers' energy. They 
A41  33 pose with an innate sense of performance, and both the photographer 
A41  34 and the camera love them.<p/>
A41  35 <p_><quote_>"You don't need me in this picture. I'm a third 
A41  36 wheel."<quote/><p/>
A41  37 <p_><quote_>"No, no. Come back over here. We need you in this 
A41  38 picture."<quote/><p/>
A41  39 <p_><quote_>"How does this look?"<quote/><p/>
A41  40 <p_><quote_>"Great. Perfect."<quote/><p/>
A41  41 <p_><quote_>"Move your head this way."<quote/><p/>
A41  42 <p_><quote_>"Like this?"<quote/><p/>
A41  43 <p_><quote_>"Great. Perfect. You guys are wonderful. Hold 
A41  44 it."<quote/><p/>
A41  45 <p_><quote_>"Are you sure you need me in this picture?"<quote/><p/>
A41  46 <p_>Thus cavorted Karena Brock-Carlyle, her husband John Carlyle 
A41  47 and Gaye Baxley Manhatton, who last month officially became 
A41  48 artistic directors of Savannah's Ballet South community dance 
A41  49 troupe. The trio had temporarily stepped into the role after the 
A41  50 mid-season resignation of Gayla Davis Lehotay in January. Last 
A41  51 month new contracts continued their tenure through August 1993.<p/>
A41  52 <p_>Their official titles vary according to the source, but from 
A41  53 their viewpoint, they are a team. They refer to one another as 
A41  54 co-artistic directors.<p/>
A41  55 <p_><quote_>"We all work together so we don't overpower one 
A41  56 another,"<quote/> Brock-Carlyle said in an interview after the 
A41  57 photo session. <quote_>"None of us wants power.<p/>
A41  58 <p_>"Although, they usually let me have my way. I don't know 
A41  59 why."<quote/><p/>
A41  60 <p_><*_>three-black-squares<*/><p/>
A41  61 <p_>For 14 years, she danced as Karena Brock with American Ballet 
A41  62 Theatre (ABT), performing as a principal for five of those years. 
A41  63 Famous Russian ballerina Natalia Makarova offered her some of her 
A41  64 first principal opportunities. She later partnered with Mikhail 
A41  65 Baryshnikov after he defected from Russia and joined ABT.<p/>
A41  66 <p_>The walls of the Carlyles' Hilton Head Dance Theatre offer an 
A41  67 introduction to the past: each dancing with other partners, Brock 
A41  68 in costume at the White House with the Shah of Iran and former 
A41  69 President Lyndon Johnson; and, a framed letter of appreciation to 
A41  70 her from former President Richard Nixon.<p/>
A41  71 <p_>Brock-Carlyle leads Ballet South's senior company dance 
A41  72 classes, also attended by her husband and Manhatton. She believes a 
A41  73 few of the dancers could be destined for such premiere companies as 
A41  74 ABT.<p/>
A41  75 <p_><quote_>"It's only 50 percent talent,"<quote/> she advised. 
A41  76 <quote_>"The rest is perseverance."<quote/><p/>
A41  77 <p_>She has persevered since she was in elementary school and her 
A41  78 parents bought tickets to a Sadler's Wells' performance of 
A41  79 'Sleeping Beauty,' starring Margot Fonteyn.<p/>
A41  80 <p_><quote_>"I think we sat in the very last seat in the 
A41  81 balcony,"<quote/> she recalled. <quote_>"Margot Fonteyn came out, 
A41  82 and she just bounced all the way up to the balcony to me, and I 
A41  83 said that's what I want to do. That was my vision from that point 
A41  84 on."<quote/><p/>
A41  85 <p_>She began taking classes at 9. At 14, she danced with a 
A41  86 professional company in San Francisco. The last two years of high 
A41  87 school were devoted to learning technique and physical therapy to 
A41  88 realign muscles.<p/>
A41  89 <p_><quote_>"I never dated,"<quote/> she said. <quote_>"I never 
A41  90 went to my high school prom. It didn't matter to me."<quote/><p/>
A41  91 <p_>She studied in Los Angeles with David Lichine and then spent a 
A41  92 year with the National Ballet of Holland, but ABT was her goal. A 
A41  93 friend snared a closed audition for her with former ABT director 
A41  94 Lucia Chase. She spent four years in the corps and five years as 
A41  95 soloist before becoming an ABT principal.<p/>
A41  96 <p_>For 13 years, she was married to ABT principal Ted Kivett.<p/>
A41  97 <p_><quote_>"We were maturing as artists - not necessarily as 
A41  98 people,"<quote/> she remembers. <quote_>"We worked on our dance, 
A41  99 and our marriage was crumbling. Ted was in line to become the 
A41 100 golden boy, then Baryshnikov arrived. Ted gave up and 
A41 101 left."<quote/><p/>
A41 102 <p_>Somewhere in the interim, she recalls, they were divorced.<p/>
A41 103 <p_>She has fond memories of Makarova. Brock-Carlyle tosses her 
A41 104 black hair and imitates Makarova gently prodding the ballerinas 
A41 105 with a <quote|>"dahlink."<p/>
A41 106 <p_><quote_>"She was beautiful,"<quote/> she said. <quote_>"I love 
A41 107 her."<quote/><p/>
A41 108 <p_>Her recollections of Baryshnikov are not as fond. She partnered 
A41 109 with him in the ballets 'Petrouchka' and 'Les Patineurs.'<p/>
A41 110 <p_><quote_>"He's a very serious artist,"<quote/> she said. 
A41 111 <quote_>"He demanded perfection. That's good.<p/>
A41 112 <p_>"He's very quiet. Very introverted. No one will ever know 
A41 113 him.<p/>
A41 114 <p_>"He's not very tall."<quote/><p/>
A41 115 <p_>Brock and Baryshnikov are the same height, making her taller 
A41 116 than he on pointe. When Baryshnikov took the ABT helm, he began 
A41 117 promoting inexperienced dancers.<p/>
A41 118 <p_><quote_>"Ballet is turned down from dancer to dancer,"<quote/> 
A41 119 interjected Karena's husband John. <quote_>"He broke that line. He 
A41 120 made young dancers stars. They weren't grown."<quote/><p/>
A41 121 <p_><quote_>"Artistry isn't developed over<?_>-<?/>night,"<quote/> 
A41 122 Karena added softly. <quote_>"It develops with time."<quote/><p/>
A41 123 <p_>She was offered a sixth year as an ABT principal, but turned it 
A41 124 down. She speaks little about that turning point in her career.<p/>
A41 125 <p_><quote_>"I was having personal problems,"<quote/> she said. 
A41 126 <quote_>"I stayed in New York for a year after I left ABT.<p/>
A41 127 <p_>"It was difficult. I would walk past the theater and start 
A41 128 crying."<quote/><p/>
A41 129 <p_>She freelanced and eventually traveled to Savannah to direct 
A41 130 the Savannah Ballet. Carlyle, whose parents lived in Savannah, came 
A41 131 as a guest artist. She convinced him to stay.<p/>
A41 132 <p_><*_>three-black-squares<*/><p/>
A41 133 <p_>Unlike Brock, Carlyle did not begin dancing until after high 
A41 134 school. He studied graphic design and wanted to create comic books 
A41 135 until an artist's model convinced the 6-foot-1-inch former high 
A41 136 school football player to take a ballet class. He waited tables in 
A41 137 New York and studied on scholarship for two years at the acclaimed 
A41 138 Harkness Ballet. Then dancer Melissa Hayden took him under her 
A41 139 tutelage.<p/>
A41 140 <p_><quote_>"We did New York Times cross<?_>-<?/>word puzzles after 
A41 141 class,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"One day the puzzle said, 'Name a 
A41 142 famous Canadian ballerina.' To my surprise, it was her."<quote/><p/>
A41 143 <p_>He soloed with the Tampa Ballet, then detoured permanently to 
A41 144 partner Brock. When Brock left Savannah Ballet, they formed the 
A41 145 Hilton Head Ballet Theatre.<p/>
A41 146 <p_>Seven years ago, they married. In September their son Timothy 
A41 147 will be 5.<p/>
A41 148 <p_>Karena discovered new priorities.<p/>
A41 149 <p_><quote_>"I gave up performing for Tim, "<quote/> she said. 
A41 150 <quote_>"I wanted more time with him.<p/>
A41 151 <p_>"To feel the body move beyond its limits and to move 
A41 152 expressively, it's wonderful. It's addicting. But I will never 
A41 153 dance again. I would have to give up my mornings with 
A41 154 Tim."<quote/><p/>
A41 155 <p_><*_>three-black-squares<*/><p/>
A41 156 <p_>Manhatton knows what it is to withdraw from addiction to dance. 
A41 157 She abandoned ballet after partnering in New York with Edward 
A41 158 Villella, considered by some the greatest classical danseur ever 
A41 159 born in the United States.<p/>
A41 160 <p_>A feminine, blond-haired, brilliant blue-eyed Savannah native, 
A41 161 Manhatton knew she wanted to be a ballerina at 13. Her mother took 
A41 162 her to a ballet at Savannah High School.<p/>
A41 163 <p_><quote_>"I leaned over to my mother,"<quote/> she said in her 
A41 164 honey Southern drawl, <quote_>"and I said, 'I think I've made a 
A41 165 decision.'"<quote/><p/>
A41 166 <p_>She studied locally and joined the Savannah Ballet. The 
A41 167 directors - Bojan and Stephanie Spassoff, formerly of ABT and 
A41 168 friends of Karena's - arranged for her to 'sit' the New York 
A41 169 apartment of traveling ballet friends one summer. Every inch the 
A41 170 Southern belle, she was befriended by upstairs neighbor Stanley 
A41 171 Williams, a New York City Ballet school instructor revered by 
A41 172 dancers. She was invited to observe a class.<p/>
A41 173 <p_><quote_>"Here I was in my little flowered Savannah 
A41 174 dress,"<quote/> she remembers. <quote_>"It was a huge studio. 
A41 175 Nureyev was standing there and he winked at me. I thought I would 
A41 176 faint."<quote/><p/>
A41 177 <p_>She studied at the Harkness and the famed Joffrey Ballet. 
A41 178 Villella was a protege of the New York City Ballet's legendary 
A41 179 George Balanchine, and when Villella suffered a recurring hip 
A41 180 injury, he assumed directorship of the Eglevsky Ballet and formed a 
A41 181 touring company. Villella knew Manhatton and asked her to tour. 
A41 182 Eventually they became dance partners.<p/>
A41 183 <p_>Tiny and compact, she became adept at the furious pace of the 
A41 184 Balanchine style. Then Villella's company began to fold.<p/>
A41 185 <p_><quote_>"It was such a learning experience for me,"<quote/> 
A41 186 Manhatton said. <quote_>"You can be a star one day, and you have an 
A41 187 injury and you're out and somebody's taking your place.<p/>
A41 188 <p_>"I just woke up one day. I'm not sure why I didn't want to go 
A41 189 on. I guess I had New York burnout."<quote/><p/>
A41 190 <p_>She tells the story with a pensive smile. Smiling is her 
A41 191 custom.<p/>
A41 192 <p_><quote_>"I think Gaye was raised in the Southern 
A41 193 tradition,"<quote/> Karena surmised. <quote_>"You always hold up 
A41 194 and go on, no matter what. She is always bubbly, no matter what she 
A41 195 might be feeling inside."<quote/><p/>
A41 196 <p_>Manhatton returned to Savannah and became an interior designer 
A41 197 for five years. Then Madeleine Walker, one of the community ballet 
A41 198 troupe's founders, asked her to teach.<p/>
A41 199 <p_><quote_>"I really owe Madeleine,"<quote/> Manhatton said. 
A41 200 <quote_>"She asked me one day, 'Why aren't you dancing?' She asked 
A41 201 if I would perform in a student performance. I thought it would be 
A41 202 interesting to put on a pair of pointe shoes again. Not in five 
A41 203 years had I had pointe shoes on.<p/>
A41 204 <p_>"It felt good."<quote/><p/>
A41 205 <p_>She began dancing with Carlyle and studying with Karena. During 
A41 206 this period of renewal, she fell in love with WTOC television 
A41 207 newsman Mike Manhatton, and they were married.<p/>
A41 208 <p_><quote_>"Dancing for me is not the same as when I was 
A41 209 younger,"<quote/> she explained. <quote_>"It's like reading a good 
A41 210 book and going back and reading it again. I understand more now. I 
A41 211 always danced so emotionally. I want to keep that this go round, 
A41 212 but I want to think about the technical aspects. It's like a fresh 
A41 213 start.<p/>
A41 214 <p_>"Teaching makes you analyze."<quote/><p/>
A41 215 <p_><*_>three-black-squares<*/><p/>
A41 216 <p_>Manhatton's responsibilities include teaching the junior 
A41 217 company - a step she considers vital in their progression toward 
A41 218 the senior ranks.<p/>
A41 219 <p_><quote_>"I'm very strict with them,"<quote/> she said with 
A41 220 delicate force. <quote_>"It's very difficult for a 9-year-old to be 
A41 221 serious about anything. I ask them to extend themselves beyond 
A41 222 casual involvement."<quote/><p/>
A41 223 <p_><quote_>"Gaye is wonderful with the kids,"<quote/> said Karena. 
A41 224 <quote_>"She does it in a very gentle and sweet way. But 
A41 225 firm."<quote/><p/>
A41 226 <p_>In addition to technique and artistry, Karena said her goal for 
A41 227 the senior corps is <quote_>"dedication, discipline and 
A41 228 commitment."<quote/> Stage presence evident even in the studio, she 
A41 229 commands the teen-agers' respect.<p/>
A41 230 <p_><quote_>"John gets closer to the kids,"<quote/> she said. 
A41 231 <quote_>"I never had a teacher with a sense of humor. I stay 
A41 232 aloof."<quote/><p/>
A41 233 <p_>John - the wily jester of the trio - relieves class tension by 
A41 234 imitating improper technique. Eliciting giggles, he then 
A41 235 demonstrates the correct approach.<p/>
A41 236 <p_><quote_>"I teach them through laughter,"<quote/> he said. 
A41 237 <quote_>"Then if I get stern, it's very effective."<quote/><p/>
A41 238 <p_>The trio is conscious their lessons came from sweat equity and 
A41 239 the school of life, not the relative security of a liberal arts 
A41 240 college. John's favorite studio poster is one emblazoned with the 
A41 241 word <quote|>"Read." Under it is a photo of a dancer reading a 
A41 242 Russian novel as he leaps across the room.<p/>
A41 243 <p_><quote_>"Teach kids to read,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"It 
A41 244 makes better dancers. Kids don't use their imaginations anymore. 
A41 245 They watch television. When I get angry is when they're not using 
A41 246 their minds. When they just go through the motions. Life's more 
A41 247 interesting than that."<quote/><p/>

A42   1 <#FROWN:A42\><h_><p_>Concerned producer prescribes remedies for 
A42   2 networks' doldrums<p/>
A42   3 <p_>By Steven Bochco<p/>
A42   4 <p_>Los Angeles Times<p/><h/>
A42   5 <p_>Hollywood - Here's a little quiz, multiple choice:<p/>
A42   6 <p_>Complete the following sentence: Network television stinks 
A42   7 because of: A. Producers. B. Advertisers. C. Networks. D. Dan 
A42   8 Quayle. E. All of the above.<p/>
A42   9 <p_>You could make a case for any of these choices, but my pick 
A42  10 would be: C. Networks. Let's face it, if you've spent more than 20 
A42  11 minutes in the television business, you know you can run a network 
A42  12 better than "those guys."<p/>
A42  13 <p_>I mean, c'mon, let's be honest about it. If television was a 
A42  14 dog, that dog wouldn't hunt. It's not very smart. It's not very 
A42  15 funny. It's not very truthful, or very real. It's not very 
A42  16 enlightening, and only occasionally thoughtful. In short, it's just 
A42  17 not very good. No wonder viewers are deserting the ship. The ship 
A42  18 is going down, folks.<p/>
A42  19 <p_>Listen, I feel bad for the networks. Really. They're scared to 
A42  20 death, notwithstanding their annual frenzy of optimism about their 
A42  21 new seasons, and with good reason. The economy is lousy. Viewership 
A42  22 is down. Advertising is down. Revenue is down. Costs are up. 
A42  23 Pressure groups are up. No one's having fun anymore. And it 
A42  24 shows.<p/>
A42  25 <p_>The television business, like it or not - and I don't - has 
A42  26 become politicized. Networks have become increasingly skittish 
A42  27 about any program content that is perceived by pressure groups as 
A42  28 objectionable. Does this mean that television shows have, by and 
A42  29 large, become more conservative? You tell me. The airwaves are 
A42  30 filled with law-and-order shows, both fictional and 
A42  31 quasi-fictional, which cannot by any stretch of the imagination be 
A42  32 identified as espousing liberal sentiments. And, Dan Quayle's 
A42  33 remarks about <tf_>Murphy Brown<tf/> notwithstanding, half-hour TV 
A42  34 sitcoms generally remain a bastion of traditional and overly 
A42  35 simplistic moral preachment.<p/>
A42  36 <h_><p_>Gutting of program content<p/><h/>
A42  37 <p_>The net result is that pressure groups have succeeded in 
A42  38 bullying advertisers and networks into gutting program content as 
A42  39 never before. Networks don't want controversy. They don't want bad 
A42  40 language. They don't want sex. They particularly don't want sex 
A42  41 between individuals of the same gender. What they do want is big 
A42  42 ratings and lots of advertising revenue, yet they're not willing to 
A42  43 take the risks necessary to achieve those goals.<p/>
A42  44 <p_>So, how do you change things around? How do you revitalize the 
A42  45 television business in an environment gripped by fear? If I were 
A42  46 king of the forest - i.e., a network president - here are some of 
A42  47 the things I'd try:<p/>
A42  48 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> I'd eliminate network censors. Let viewership 
A42  49 determine what's appropriate and what isn't.<p/>
A42  50 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> I'd eliminate jobs. Lots of them. Sorry, but how 
A42  51 many network executives does it really take to screw in - or screw 
A42  52 up - a light bulb?<p/>
A42  53 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> I'd stop relying on research as a network tool. 
A42  54 It doesn't work. If it did, TV wouldn't have a failure rate in 
A42  55 excess of 90 percent. I think I can manage to fail nine out of 10 
A42  56 times on my own, thank you, without some big fat research 
A42  57 department's help.<p/>
A42  58 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> I'd eliminate pilots. Which, by definition, 
A42  59 would eliminate pilot season. If you believe in something, order 
A42  60 it. Put your money where your mouth is. And never order less than a 
A42  61 full season of episodes of any new show. Not six. Not 13. But 22. 
A42  62 In a cluttered viewing landscape, 13 episodes just aren't enough to 
A42  63 gain the viewer's attention, let alone loyalty.<p/>
A42  64 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> Acknowledge that you can no longer operate in 
A42  65 old ways in a new environment. Buy only what you need. The 
A42  66 extensive stockpiling of backup shows is a waste of talent, time 
A42  67 and money.<p/>
A42  68 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> Mess with traditional program lengths. If 
A42  69 there's a really great 45-minute show you want to put on, do it.<p/>
A42  70 <p_><*_>bullet<*/>Watching the fall season is like watching the 
A42  71 start of the New York Marathon. Eliminate it. Once you've bought 
A42  72 something, give its chefs the time to cook it. When it's ready - 
A42  73 only when it's ready - put it on and leave it on.<p/>
A42  74 <h_><p_>Reduce commercials<p/><h/>
A42  75 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> How's this for a plan? Everybody's screaming - 
A42  76 rightfully so - about screen clutter. Too many credits. Too many 
A42  77 logos. Main titles are too long. Not enough program time. Well, how 
A42  78 about reducing the number of commercials you put on the air and 
A42  79 charging more for them? Less advertising time means less glut, 
A42  80 which in turn means more attention to the advertising that's there. 
A42  81 I bet they'll pay.<p/>
A42  82 <p_><*_>bullet<*/> Finally, and most importantly, I'd acknowledge 
A42  83 television as an art form and challenge those working in the medium 
A42  84 to redefine their standards of excellence accordingly. I'm weary of 
A42  85 feeling embarrassed about using the "a" word in connection with 
A42  86 television. At our best, we are artists.<p/>
A42  87 <p_>The problem, however, is that art isn't always politically 
A42  88 correct. Which means we'd have to tell the pressure groups - all of 
A42  89 them - to take a hike. We're going to give our talented writers and 
A42  90 producers the chance to make shows they're passionate about. How 
A42  91 many shows do you really see on TV where you just know the men and 
A42  92 women making them are truly passionate about their work? Not many, 
A42  93 I'll bet. But the ones that are informed by someone's passion are 
A42  94 usually the ones you make an appointment to see.<p/>
A42  95 <p_>These are only a few of the things I'd do if I were running a 
A42  96 network. Maybe they wouldn't work. But what the four major networks 
A42  97 are doing now doesn't work. So what the hell? What have we got to 
A42  98 lose that we aren't already losing?<p/>
A42  99 
A42 100 <h_><p_>Art Detour goes monthly<p/>
A42 101 <p_>'Afterhours' to open studios, galleries, more<p/>
A42 102 <p_>RICHARD NILSEN<p/>
A42 103 <p_>The Arizona Republic<p/><h/>
A42 104 <p_>An Art Detour once a year isn't enough anymore, so an 
A42 105 enterprising group of Phoenix artists and galleries has conspired 
A42 106 to create an informal "detour" once a month through the cooler 
A42 107 season.<p/>
A42 108 <p_>Called Phoenix Arts Afterhours, it will be held from 5 to 9 
A42 109 p.m. on the second Wednesday of each month from September through 
A42 110 June. It begins Wednesday.<p/>
A42 111 <p_>Twenty-two art spaces, including the Phoenix Art Museum and the 
A42 112 Heard Museum, will take part in the self-guided tour of downtown 
A42 113 studios, galleries, bookstores and museums.<p/>
A42 114 <p_>Modeled on Philadelphia's First Friday program, with its 31 
A42 115 galleries and 10 restaurants, and Tucson's popular Downtown 
A42 116 Saturday Night, the program is planned to benefit area artists, 
A42 117 restaurants and businesses.<p/>
A42 118 <p_><quote_>"The idea surfaced a couple of weeks after the Art 
A42 119 Detour in April,"<quote/> said Catherine Spencer, director of Radix 
A42 120 Gallery.<p/>
A42 121 <p_><quote_>"It was the intention of the group to have special 
A42 122 performances, demonstrations and individual studio tours. The 
A42 123 variety of works is so tremendous. I think that's what makes it 
A42 124 unique.<p/>
A42 125 <p_>"In one evening, you can see a museum show, a gallery 
A42 126 installation and then a completely alternative performance piece 
A42 127 within two miles and four hours of each other."<quote/><p/>
A42 128 <p_>This variety is the strength of the downtown Phoenix arts 
A42 129 community, Spencer said.<p/>
A42 130 <p_><quote_>"There isn't a regional history, found in other parts 
A42 131 of the metro area,"<quote/> she said diplomatically, meaning 
A42 132 <quote_>"This isn't Scottsdale."<quote/><p/>
A42 133 <p_>That can surely be said for Tony Zahn's 
A42 134 <foreign|>Volksgemeinschafthalle at 208 S. Fifth Ave.<p/>
A42 135 <p_><quote_>"It's a display area where people can look at an 
A42 136 exhibit for fun, without being burdened by the label 
A42 137 'art,'"<quote/> Zahn said. <quote_>"It is just like art, but it's 
A42 138 not."<quote/><p/>
A42 139 <p_>He calls it a <quote_>"metaesthetic theme park."<quote/><p/>
A42 140 <p_><quote_>"But I don't want to give away what people will 
A42 141 see,"<quote/> he said.<p/>
A42 142 <p_>Will there be a roller coaster?<p/>
A42 143 <p_><quote_>"Not this time, but I'm working on that."<quote/><p/>
A42 144 <p_>Metropophobobia will host readings in experimental and 
A42 145 <quote_>"obscure areas of endeavor,"<quote/> according to owner 
A42 146 Peter Ragan. And there will be coffee and espresso.<p/>
A42 147 <p_>For the less adventurous, the Phoenix Art Museum is free on 
A42 148 Wednesdays and is open until 9 p.m., and the Heard Museum will be 
A42 149 free from 5 to 9 p.m.<p/>
A42 150 <p_>The current show at the art museum, 'Transcending Turmoil: 
A42 151 Painting at the Close of China's Empire, 1796-1911,' contains more 
A42 152 than 100 fine Chinese paintings.<p/>
A42 153 <p_>The Heard is showing 'Eclectica: Recent Acquisitions,' and 
A42 154 '<*_>initial-exclamation-mark<*/>Chispas! Cultural Warriors of New 
A42 155 Mexico.'<p/>
A42 156 <p_>The Afterhours will give people a chance to visit studios, too, 
A42 157 to see what artists do.<p/>
A42 158 <p_><quote_>"I'm going to be here working,"<quote/> said sculptor 
A42 159 Kevin Irvin, who shares a studio with painter Marta Boutel at an 
A42 160 old trolley depot at 10th and Sheridan streets. <quote_>"When 
A42 161 people stop by, I'll take them around and show them what we do and 
A42 162 talk to them. There will be a little food and drink.<p/>
A42 163 <p_>"And up at this end of the tour, we have a cluster of studios, 
A42 164 including those of Ed Mell, John Kleber and Nick de Matties, making 
A42 165 a very convenient grouping."<quote/><p/>
A42 166 <p_>Not officially part of the tour is CityArts, the city of 
A42 167 Phoenix's Visual Arts Gallery at 214 E. Moreland St., which is open 
A42 168 from 6 to 9 p.m.<p/>
A42 169 <p_>Currently showing are mixed-media paintings of Jeff Falk.<p/>
A42 170 <p_>Note: CRASHarts and Gallery X will not take part until the 
A42 171 second Phoenix Arts Afterhours on Oct.14.<p/>

A42 176 <p_>LOS ANGELES - With ground<?_>-<?/>breaking performances, Sydney 
A42 177 Poitier and Robert Redford have earned their places among the icons 
A42 178 of American cinema.<p/>
A42 179 <p_>Poitier, 68, made a name for himself in the late 1950s and 
A42 180 '60s, starring in such film dramas as <tf_>Blackboard Jungle, 
A42 181 Lilies of the Field, In the Heat of the Night, To Sir With 
A42 182 Love<tf/> and <tf_>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner<tf/>. His films 
A42 183 challenged the conventions of the time and helped lead to a new era 
A42 184 in race relations.<p/>
A42 185 <p_>Redford, 55, was Hollywood's favorite leading man in the '70s 
A42 186 with such films as <tf_>The Candidate, The Sting, The Way We 
A42 187 Were<tf/> and <tf_>All the President's Men<tf/> - films that 
A42 188 exploited his cool gaze, square jaw and all-American smile.<p/>
A42 189 <p_>Thus it was strange to see both men before the microphone at a 
A42 190 recent news conference discussing their participation in the movie 
A42 191 <tf|>Sneakers, a lightweight romp through the world of computer 
A42 192 hackers and high-tech espionage. <tf|>Sneakers opens Friday.<p/>
A42 193 <p_>The movie stars Redford as a former '60s radical and dedicated 
A42 194 hacker who heads a ragtag team of computer nerds and ex-criminals 
A42 195 hired to penetrate sophisticated security systems and point out 
A42 196 their flaws.Playing the team members are Poitier, Dan Aykroyd, 
A42 197 River Phoenix and Mary McDonnell. Ben Kingsley plays Redford's 
A42 198 one-time college chum-turned-archnemesis Cosmo, and James Earl 
A42 199 Jones makes a brief appearance as a National Security Agency 
A42 200 honcho. As the production notes proudly boast, there are eight 
A42 201 Oscars and 38 Oscar nominations among the bunch.<p/>
A42 202 <p_>But why this movie?<p/>
A42 203 <p_><quote_>"I got involved with the project through a phone call 
A42 204 basically (from director Phil Alden Robinson),"<quote/> Poitier 
A42 205 said. <quote_>"By the time I got off the phone, I was 
A42 206 had."<quote/><p/>
A42 207 <p_>Poitier, who has carried many movies with his performances, 
A42 208 says it was a relief to share some of the load this time.<p/>
A42 209 <p_><quote_>"I had never done an ensemble piece before,"<quote/> he 
A42 210 says. <quote_>"This was a new and very satisfying experience.... 
A42 211 And it was a learning experience every day. It's nice to work 
A42 212 without the pressure of carrying the whole thing."<quote/><p/>
A42 213 <p_>Redford said he'd been interested in working with Robinson, who 
A42 214 previously wrote and directed <tf_>Field of Dreams<tf/> and had 
A42 215 been trying to get <tf|>Sneakers made for a decade.<p/>
A42 216 <p_><quote_>"I can't say I got into it because of the cast - the 
A42 217 cast materialized around me,"<quote/> Redford said. <quote_>"But 
A42 218 the cast certainly made the experience pleasurable, one of the best 
A42 219 I ever had.... It was a piece of entertainment touching on an 
A42 220 important issue, and it was smart."<quote/><p/>
A42 221 <p_>One problem both actors have in choosing new material is the 
A42 222 knowledge that filmgoers hold them to a higher standard because of 
A42 223 their previous accomplishments. Poitier is very aware of this 
A42 224 burden.<p/>
A42 225 <p_><quote_>"I have a responsibility if I am perceived that way to 
A42 226 prove that I am worthy of that,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"Because 
A42 227 this film is ... without great weight, doesn't mean I just come in 
A42 228 and wing it."<quote/><p/>
A42 229 <p_>Contrary to some of his statements in the past, Redford insists 
A42 230 <tf|>Sneakers was not part of a bargain he has struck to enable him 
A42 231 to do other more personal projects.<p/>
A42 232 <p_>Besides, he says, the bottom line for any movie, be it 
A42 233 <tf_>Sneakers, Incident at Oglala<tf/> or <tf_>All the President's 
A42 234 Men<tf/>, is that it is entertaining.<p/>

A43   1 <#FROWN:A43\><h_><p_>Moribund MGM Lion Shows a Few Signs of Life<p/>
A43   2 <p_>By Bob Strauss<p/><h/>
A43   3 <p_>LOS ANGELES - There's little talk these days about the Lion 
A43   4 roaring. People just seem grateful that old Leo is, at least, still 
A43   5 breathing.<p/>
A43   6 <p_>The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer trademark, recently spruced up and 
A43   7 relieved of a debilitating tie to Pathe Communications, once again 
A43   8 symbolizes a going filmmaking concern. Certainly, today's MGM is 
A43   9 not the Hollywood powerhouse that Louis B. Mayer operated from 1925 
A43  10 through the mid-'50s.<p/>
A43  11 <p_>But neither is MGM the industry deadbeat that it had become by 
A43  12 1991. Unlike many independent and mini-majors that have recently 
A43  13 succumbed to recessionary pressure, the onetime Tiffany studio has 
A43  14 been slowly stripped of <}_><-|>it<+|>its<}/> former glory for 
A43  15 nearly a quarter century. After two decades of dividing and 
A43  16 parceling out the company's assets - the film library to Ted 
A43  17 Turner, the legendary Culver City lot to Lorimar, Warner Bros. and 
A43  18 now Sony Pictures Entertainment - the aviation and casino kingpin 
A43  19 Kirk Kerkorian finally sold MGM's film entertainment division to 
A43  20 Pathe boss Giancarlo Parretti in November, 1990.<p/>
A43  21 <p_>Within six months, the Italian financier was reneging on deals 
A43  22 with major Hollywood talent, unpaid service suppliers were trying 
A43  23 to force MGM into bankruptcy, and cash could not be found to 
A43  24 release such films as 'Thelma and Louise' and 'Delirious.'<p/>
A43  25 <p_>Soon after, a very different lion - Credit Lyonnais Nederland, 
A43  26 the French nationalized bank that backed the highly leveraged, $1.3 
A43  27 billion buyout - made moves to oust Parretti. Late last year, after 
A43  28 an agonizing court battle, a Delaware chancery court removed 
A43  29 Parretti from MGM's board. New owners Credit Lyonnais handed the 
A43  30 studio over to veteran Hollywood executive Alan Ladd Jr., who, 
A43  31 though hired by Parretti, sided with the bank during the custody 
A43  32 fight.<p/>
A43  33 <h_><p_>Sterling reputation<p/><h/>
A43  34 <p_>And with good reason. Perhaps the only studio executive widely 
A43  35 beloved by Hollywood's creative community <tf|>and respected by his 
A43  36 peers, the shy, 54-year-old 'Laddie' (yes, he's the cowboy star's 
A43  37 son) hated having his name linked to the notorious Parretti's. And 
A43  38 Ladd's reputation, the Euro<?_>-<?/>bankers know, is one of MGM's 
A43  39 best remaining assets; the very fact that it's intact is testimony 
A43  40 to how highly Ladd is regarded.<p/>
A43  41 <p_>He's also got an impressive track record, which includes 
A43  42 perhaps the smartest decision in movie history: Ladd gave the green 
A43  43 light to a goofy little science-fiction film called 'Star Wars' 
A43  44 when he was running 20th Century Fox. Even Ladd's earlier stint as 
A43  45 production chief at the Kerkorian-owned MGM was one of the brighter 
A43  46 plateaus in the studio's long decline, marked by such hits as 
A43  47 'Moonstruck' and 'A Fish Called Wanda.'<p/>
A43  48 <p_>Now, Ladd hopes that MGM's upcoming slate of fall films will 
A43  49 erase the bad taste of 1991, when only 'Thelma & Louise' turned a 
A43  50 profit.<p/>
A43  51 <p_><quote_>"It's nice to be able to go to rushes of a picture or a 
A43  52 rough cut and be very thrilled with what you're seeing,"<quote/> 
A43  53 Ladd said. <quote_>"As opposed to going to see something like 
A43  54 'Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man' and thinking, 'My God! What 
A43  55 a disaster.'"<quote/><p/>
A43  56 <p_>Among MGM's upcoming releases is Gary Sinise's acclaimed remake 
A43  57 of John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men,' with John Malkovich; 
A43  58 Jean-Jacques Annaud's adaptation of Marguerite Duras's memoir 'The 
A43  59 Lover,' a big European hit that has run into commercially 
A43  60 exploitable censorship difficulties here; 'Rich in Love,' which 
A43  61 re<?_>-<?/>teams the Oscar-winning 'Driving Miss Daisy' team of 
A43  62 writer Alfred Uhry, director Bruce Beresford and producers Richard 
A43  63 and Lili Fini Zanuck, and the erotic thriller 'Body of Evidence,' 
A43  64 starring Madonna.<p/>
A43  65 <p_>Also on tap are another Beresford-Zanucks collaboration about 
A43  66 blues legend Bessie Smith; 'The Baboon Heart,' a restaurant romance 
A43  67 with Christian Slater and Marisa ('My Cousin Vinny') Tomei; the 
A43  68 comedy thriller 'Cloak and Diaper' with Kathleen Turner; new films 
A43  69 directed by Robert Townsend, John Schlesinger and Wes Craven, and 
A43  70 'Son of the Pink Panther,' in which Blake Edwards revives his old 
A43  71 comedy franchise, with Italian comic Roberto Benigni in place of 
A43  72 the late Peter Sellers.<p/>
A43  73 <p_>This slate of films bears a great responsibility; most of them 
A43  74 have to, at the very least, perform as well as MGM's mildly 
A43  75 profitable skating romance 'The Cutting Edge' did earlier this 
A43  76 year. Estimates of how much money Credit Lyonnais currently has 
A43  77 invested in MGM range from $800 million to more than $1 billion.<p/>
A43  78 <p_>If the bank ever hopes to recoup, or even to find a buyer for 
A43  79 MGM, the upcoming features have to do better than the recent run of 
A43  80 such under<?_>-<?/>achievers as 'Crisscross,', 'Rush,' 'Shattered,' 
A43  81 'The Indian Runner,' 'Life Stinks' and 'Diggstown,' which opened in 
A43  82 12th place last weekend.<p/>
A43  83 <h_><p_>Looking for hits<p/><h/>
A43  84 <p_><quote_>"Who knows?"<quote/> said Steven E. Hill, an 
A43  85 entertainment industry analyst for Hancock Institutional Equity 
A43  86 Services in San Francisco, when asked about the commercial 
A43  87 viability of upcoming MGM films. <quote_>"The list doesn't 
A43  88 particularly excite or worry me, one way or another. There's 
A43  89 nothing that makes me feel like they have some sure hits. Then 
A43  90 again, they have a list of films that may be solid. It's hard to 
A43  91 say.<p/>
A43  92 <p_>"But the key to successfully reviving the company will be 
A43  93 having hit movies. They have to have hit films, or at least 
A43  94 profitable films one after the other, and a substantial release 
A43  95 schedule."<quote/><p/>
A43  96 <p_><quote_>"First and foremost, we need to build up our production 
A43  97 program in feature films,"<quote/> acknowledged Dennis Stanfill, 
A43  98 Ladd's former boss at Fox who was brought in as MGM's co-chairman 
A43  99 and chief executive officer earlier this year. Stanfill oversees 
A43 100 the company's financial end, outstanding legal entanglements and 
A43 101 corporate restructuring, freeing up Ladd to concentrate on 
A43 102 creative, production and marketing tasks.<p/>
A43 103 <p_>Stanfill admits that, considering the hangover from Parretti's 
A43 104 regime, rebuilding MGM is a daunting assignment. <quote_>"How big 
A43 105 of a problem?"<quote/> he asked rhetorically. <quote_>"Let me put 
A43 106 it this way: This is a major challenge. It was left by Parretti 
A43 107 with a very heavy debt load and ongoing obligations. As well, it 
A43 108 went through a period of misdirection, if not mismanagement.<p/>
A43 109 <p_>"We have now set on a course, the purpose of which is to make 
A43 110 MGM, again, a great movie company in its finest tradition. That's 
A43 111 going to take a considerable amount of time. It's not a quick task, 
A43 112 but we are building, I believe, solidly and well - in close 
A43 113 co<?_>-<?/>operation with Credit Lyonnais, which is committed to 
A43 114 the long term."<quote/><p/>

A43 116 <h_><p_>Blue-Collar Slant Is Gold for Fox<p/>
A43 117 <p_>Programs Recognize Class Differences<p/>
A43 118 <p_>By David Zurawik<p/>
A43 119 <p_>Baltimore Sun<p/><h/>
A43 120 <p_>Fox Broadcasting is doing it again. Most American viewers had 
A43 121 their channel scanners locked on NBC in July and early August 
A43 122 because of the Olympics, but this is the summer of Fox.<p/>
A43 123 <p_>Once again, Fox went against the old rules of showing reruns in 
A43 124 summer and last month debuted a new series called 'Melrose Place.' 
A43 125 It's a brand-new hit show, a series that is all the buzz.<p/>
A43 126 <p_>Thanks in large part to 'Melrose Place,' Fox finished ahead of 
A43 127 one of the big three networks, NBC, in over-all household ratings 
A43 128 for the week of July 13-19. That marked a first for Fox Network. 
A43 129 And some industry analysts are predicting that Fox will finish 
A43 130 ahead of NBC for the entire 1992-93 season.<p/>
A43 131 <p_>And driven by all that, plus its hammerlock on young viewers 
A43 132 (whom advertisers most want to reach), it looks as if Fox will 
A43 133 start the fall season with more advertising time sold for more 
A43 134 money than any network except CBS, which finished first last 
A43 135 year.<p/>
A43 136 <p_>Not bad. And Fox is doing all this growing and money-making 
A43 137 when audiences for other broadcast networks are eroding.<p/>
A43 138 <p_>What is Fox doing that NBC, ABC, CBS or PBS aren't? Or, as one 
A43 139 English journalist put it as he was leaving a Fox presentation on 
A43 140 the fall preview press conference in Los Angeles recently: 
A43 141 <quote_>"What makes these Fox people - with all their shows about 
A43 142 garbage men and shoe salesman - so bloody smart, 
A43 143 anyway?"<quote/><p/>
A43 144 <p_>The shoe salesman and garbage man are, of course, Al Bundy of 
A43 145 'Married ...With Children' and Roc Emerson of 'Roc,' respectively. 
A43 146 And they are very much part of the answer to the question of what 
A43 147 makes Fox such a success. They are part of a blue-collar 
A43 148 sensibility driving some of the most popular Fox shows, such as 
A43 149 'Married,' 'Roc' and 'The Simpsons.'<p/>
A43 150 <p_>'Blue collar' is an adjective that isn't used much lately when 
A43 151 talking about prime-time television. The only other important 
A43 152 blue-collar family in prime time is the Conners of 'Roseanne' on 
A43 153 ABC.<p/>
A43 154 <p_>In fact, prime-time television rarely admits that there are 
A43 155 class differences in this country and that life looks very 
A43 156 different, depending on which side of the working-class boundary 
A43 157 you happen to live on. Almost everyone on prime-time television 
A43 158 lives in a shiny, suburban world like that of the Taylors on 'Home 
A43 159 Improvement' or a shiny, yupscale world like that of 'Murphy Brown' 
A43 160 - except on Fox.<p/>
A43 161 <p_>'Roc' lives in a row<?_>-<?/>house in Baltimore. In last year's 
A43 162 premiere episode, he delivered his comic, working-class version of 
A43 163 Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech. His dream, he said, 
A43 164 was to own a semi-detached home at the end of the row. Roc 
A43 165 furnishes his rowhouse with repaired or restored furniture 
A43 166 collected on his garbage route. What shines in 'Roc' are the 
A43 167 dreams.<p/>
A43 168 <p_>Two new Fox shows with that same sensibility will debut soon: 
A43 169 'The Heights' (on Thursday) and 'Class of '96' (in late September 
A43 170 or early October). They look like winners.<p/>
A43 171 <p_>'The Heights' is about a rock 'n' roll band of working-class 
A43 172 adults in their 20s. The band members - who live in the 
A43 173 smokestack-and-factory landscape of Bruce Springsteen's New Jersey 
A43 174 - work during the day as mechanics, truck dispatchers and grocery 
A43 175 store clerks. And, like Roc, they dream. Their dreams are expressed 
A43 176 in their music.<p/>
A43 177 <p_>'Class of '96' takes place in what might seem like the unlikely 
A43 178 setting of an Ivy League college. But the series is told in part 
A43 179 through the narration of David Copperfield Morrissey, a 
A43 180 working-class kid from New Jersey on a scholarship. Most of the 
A43 181 two-hour pilot is about class differences and Morrissey's dreams. 
A43 182 It's smart stuff - like the answers that Fox president Peter 
A43 183 Chernin gave during a recent interview in California when he was 
A43 184 asked about that working-class sensibility at Fox.<p/>
A43 185 <p_>Chernin started his explanation with the 'Marxist-Leninist' 
A43 186 quote, but added quickly that he was only kidding.<p/>
A43 187 <p_><quote_>"I think that we have strived to do a number of things 
A43 188 - one of which is to make television a little less sort of 
A43 189 saccharine or standard or predictable,"<quote/> he said. 
A43 190 <quote_>"We do live in a world in which there are class 
A43 191 differences."<quote/><p/>
A43 192 <p_>And class differences mean different audiences, in the words of 
A43 193 media scholar John Fiske, of the University of Wisconsin, who 
A43 194 insists you can't talk about TV viewers as a single audience.<p/>
A43 195 <p_><quote_>"Pluralizing the term into audiences at least 
A43 196 recognizes that there are differences between viewers that must be 
A43 197 taken into account,"<quote/> he writes in <tf_>Television 
A43 198 Culture<tf/>. <quote_>"We are not a homogenous society ...Our 
A43 199 social system is criss-crossed by axes of class, gender, race, age, 
A43 200 nationality, region, politics, and so on, all of which produce 
A43 201 strongly marked differences."<quote/><p/>
A43 202 <p_>Unlike CBS, for example, which still primarily thinks of the TV 
A43 203 audience as one huge homogeneous mass, Fox acknowledges such 
A43 204 differences and develops programs based on them, Chernin said.<p/>
A43 205 <p_><quote_>"We have always tried very hard to think about 
A43 206 audiences that are underserved,"<quote/> he said. <quote_>"If you 
A43 207 look at some of our biggest hits - 'In Living Color' and 'Beverly 
A43 208 Hills 90210' - they came from audiences that had been traditionally 
A43 209 underserved by television. In the case of 'In Living Color,' it was 
A43 210 sort of a contemporary, hip-hop minority culture. And in the case 
A43 211 of '90210,' there hadn't been a realistic teenage show."<quote/><p/>
A43 212 <p_>Working-class viewers make up one very large and 
A43 213 underrepresented audience, Chernin said. And Fox has tried to serve 
A43 214 them. It's as simple as that, he said.<p/>
A43 215 <p_>The success of the fourth network is not by any means due only 
A43 216 to this blue-collar sensibility. Two other major reasons for the 
A43 217 success of Fox are surely the network's youth appeal and a certain 
A43 218 derring-do in programming - like the decision to broadcast 'Roc' 
A43 219 live this season.<p/>
A43 220 <p_>And, while much is starting to be made of the youth appeal of 
A43 221 'The Heights' and 'Class of '96', the two shows do have a 
A43 222 working-class sensibility.<p/>
A43 223 
A44   1 <#FROWN:A44\><h_><p_>The Opera of 'The Scarlet Letter'<p/>
A44   2 <p_>Alfred Kazin<p/><h/>
A44   3 <p_>Why is there no opera of <tf_>The Scarlet Letter<tf/>? The 
A44   4 novel opens on a scene, <quote_>"The Prison-Door,"<quote/> that is 
A44   5 so dramatic in its starkness that one half-expects to hear an 
A44   6 audience burst into applause. <quote_>"A throng of bearded men, in 
A44   7 sad-colored garments and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed 
A44   8 with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded, was 
A44   9 assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which was 
A44  10 heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron 
A44  11 spikes."<quote/><p/>
A44  12 <p_>The cruel public spectacle that follows is contained in the 
A44  13 fact that although this is a primitive Boston, only some fifteen or 
A44  14 twenty years old, <quote_>"the wooden jail was already marked with 
A44  15 weather-stains and other indications of age, which gave yet a 
A44  16 darker aspect to its beetle-browed and gloomy front. The rust on 
A44  17 the ponderous iron-work of its oaken door looked more antique than 
A44  18 anything else in the new world."<quote/> To a 'new world' the 
A44  19 Puritans have transferred intact from the old everything rigid, 
A44  20 intolerant, aged, and cramped in spirit.<p/>
A44  21 <p_>The contrast between old world and new, between the dour old 
A44  22 Roger Chillingworth and his estranged and lively young wife Hester 
A44  23 Prynne, is fundamental to a novel so overwhelming in its images and 
A44  24 driving in its symbols that Henry James said that Hawthorne's 
A44  25 method amounted to <quote|>"importunity."<p/>
A44  26 <p_><quote_>Before this ugly edifice, and between it and the 
A44  27 wheel-track of the street, was a grass-plot, much overgrown with 
A44  28 burdock, pig<?_>-<?/>weed, apple-peru, and such unsightly 
A44  29 vegetation, which evidently found congenial in the soil that had so 
A44  30 early borne the black flower of civilized society, a prison. But, 
A44  31 on one side of the portal, and rooted almost at the threshold, was 
A44  32 a wild rose-bush, covered, in this month of June, with its delicate 
A44  33 gems, which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile 
A44  34 beauty to the prisoner as he went in, and to the condemned criminal 
A44  35 as he came forth to his doom, in token that the deep heart of 
A44  36 Nature could pity and be kind to him.<quote/><p/>
A44  37 <p_>No opera could begin with a scene of more violent contrasts of 
A44  38 costume, color, and personality than in what follows. A young 
A44  39 woman, tall, <quote_>"with a figure of perfect elegance,"<quote/> 
A44  40 stands on a scaffold before the whole town clasping a 
A44  41 three-month-old baby.<p/>
A44  42 <p_><quote_>On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, 
A44  43 surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of 
A44  44 gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, 
A44  45 and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that 
A44  46 it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the 
A44  47 apparel which she wore.<quote/><p/>
A44  48 <p_>Hester Prynne, a married woman with a missing husband, could 
A44  49 have been sentenced to death for adultery. Condemned always to wear 
A44  50 the letter A as a badge of shame, this gifted seamstress has turned 
A44  51 it into a resplendent work of art. To make the contrast between 
A44  52 Hester's condemnation and the splendor of the scarlet letter, 
A44  53 between her dignity on the scaffold and the deadly crowd of gray, 
A44  54 bitter old, women watching her, even more operatic and instantly 
A44  55 thrilling, she is beautiful, with <quote_>"dark and abundant hair, 
A44  56 so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam,"<quote/> and 
A44  57 <quote_>"deep black eyes."<quote/><p/>
A44  58 <p_>As she stands there, about to be castigated for her sins by two 
A44  59 leading clergymen of Boston who demand the name of her lover, 
A44  60 Hester is horrified to see in the crowd her shriveled, twisted 
A44  61 husband, Roger Chillingworth, who has been a captive of Indians in 
A44  62 the wilderness. Talk about opera! While the town chorus is 
A44  63 murmuring against her, her silently fanatical husband staring at 
A44  64 her, the ethereal-looking young clergyman, Arthur Dimmesdale, 
A44  65 frightened and trembling, is also compelled to demand the name of 
A44  66 her partner in crime. Since there seems to be no one else in this 
A44  67 crude settlement likely to interest Hester Prynne, it is obvious 
A44  68 from his double-edged aria that he is her lover.<p/>
A44  69 <p_>The extraordinary narrowness of Puritan life and thought is 
A44  70 vividly brought out by the little space Boston occupies between the 
A44  71 wilderness and the ocean. Theatrically, almost all the action takes 
A44  72 place between any two of the four main characters. Hester's only 
A44  73 companion is her mischievous, provocative daughter Pearl - an 
A44  74 emblem of the <quote|>"lawlessness" in her mother's suppressed 
A44  75 nature. Because Roger has mysterious medical knowledge he is called 
A44  76 in to treat the hysterical Hester after her public humiliation, 
A44  77 then Arthur, who is deteriorating under his inability to confess 
A44  78 his guilt. Roger soon manages to take up residence with Arthur in 
A44  79 order to investigate to the full and eventually expose the man he 
A44  80 has spotted as his wife's lover.<p/>
A44  81 <p_>With Hester trying to control her flamboyant daughter, with 
A44  82 Roger secretly preying on Arthur, and Arthur helplessly trying to 
A44  83 resist his supposed benefactor who is his <quote|>"fiend-like" 
A44  84 enemy, the concentration of repressed thought and emotion on the 
A44  85 part of all the characters becomes more and more explosive, and 
A44  86 breaks out only in the grand denouement, the most operatic 
A44  87 imaginable. The formal procession of the townspeople in celebration 
A44  88 of Arthur's overcharged Election Day sermon ends in Arthur's public 
A44  89 confession on the scaffold, embracing Hester and Pearl, before he 
A44  90 triumphantly dies. Repression at the heart of this Puritan 
A44  91 civilization, a necessary way of life, induces such a consistency 
A44  92 of tone that Hawthorne said the novel <quote_>"is positively a 
A44  93 hell-fired story, into which I found it almost impossible to throw 
A44  94 any cheering light."<quote/> He recalled years later <quote_>"my 
A44  95 emotions when I read the last scene of the Scarlet Letter to my 
A44  96 wife, just after writing it - tried to read it, rather, for my 
A44  97 voice swelled and heaved, as if I were tossed up and down on an 
A44  98 ocean, as it subsides after a storm."<quote/><p/>
A44  99 <p_>Why was he more disturbed by this book than by anything else he 
A44 100 ever wrote? He was invading the country of his ancestors, but he 
A44 101 had done this in story after story in the collections so wearily 
A44 102 named <tf_>Twice-Told Tales<tf/> and <tf_>Mosses From an Old 
A44 103 Manse<tf/>. In <tf_>The Scarlet Letter<tf/>, however, he was not 
A44 104 just beautifully (and often defensively) invoking the old Puritan 
A44 105 world in bits and pieces. Now there surfaced the long interior 
A44 106 conflict between natural respect for the past and his equal 
A44 107 abhorrence of its theological cruelty. (And Hawthorne was not a 
A44 108 church<?_>-<?/>goer, not even a liberal one.) Only a work of art, 
A44 109 of the intensest emotions, could even begin to answer to his 
A44 110 struggle with himself over a past in which, dreamlike, he often 
A44 111 felt he was living. There was no rejecting the past in the 
A44 112 transcendentalist style, which he despised. So there was no great 
A44 113 comfort for him in writing this <quote|>"hell-fired" book. The only 
A44 114 relief this bitter man gave himself was in creating his heroine. 
A44 115 The only fully admirable character in <tf_>The Scarlet Letter<tf/> 
A44 116 is Hester. Quite apart from her <quote_>"elegant figure"<quote/> 
A44 117 and <quote_>"dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off 
A44 118 the sunshine with a gleam,"<quote/> Hester is the only character in 
A44 119 the book big enough to sustain a conflict with the harsh Puritan 
A44 120 world equal to Hawthorne's own. In a book without heroes, Hester 
A44 121 has to carry the love story all by herself.<p/>
A44 122 <p_><tf_>The Scarlet Letter<tf/> was immediately recognized on its 
A44 123 publication in 1850 as the masterpiece a young and 
A44 124 self<?_>-<?/>conscious country was waiting for. It was assimilable 
A44 125 in a way that works by two New Yorkers, Melvilles <tf|>Moby-Dick 
A44 126 (1851) and Whitman's <tf_>Leaves of Grass<tf/> (1855), were not. 
A44 127 New England still seemed the source and center of an Americn 
A44 128 civilization founded on Protestant tradition. It is impossible to 
A44 129 imagine Melville and Whitman sounding as institutional as 
A44 130 Hawthorne. They were engaged, like true American originals, in the 
A44 131 prodigious language experiment necessary to their 'primitive' 
A44 132 understanding of life, meaning life at the bottom.<p/>
A44 133 <p_>Hawthorne was a true son of clerical New England in his formal 
A44 134 and even stately style. It had great tonality of sound and enormous 
A44 135 suggestiveness - irony was Hawthorne's favorite maneuver in telling 
A44 136 a story. The dark and solemn music of his unrelenting commentary on 
A44 137 the story he is presenting intervenes in the way an orchestra does 
A44 138 at the opera - setting the emotional background and reinforcing it 
A44 139 at crucial points. <tf_>The Scarlet Letter<tf/> is an elaborately 
A44 140 stylized and formal performance in every sense. It never bursts out 
A44 141 from the depths of our hidden animal nature as Melville and Whitman 
A44 142 do. Just as the novel's climax is a sermon, so the long tradition 
A44 143 of reading sermons <tf_>to an audience that always knew what to 
A44 144 expect<tf/> is also behind Hawthorne's novel. He is constantly 
A44 145 beckoning to the reader to join him in sighing over the 
A44 146 <quote_>"positively hell-fired story"<quote/> he feels compelled to 
A44 147 tell. There is a literary domesticity in Hawthorne's many gestures 
A44 148 to the reader that is very New England, based as they are on the 
A44 149 sermon, the chief medium of Protestantism, and on a congregation to 
A44 150 hear it.<p/>
A44 151 <p_>In <tf_>The Scarlet Letter<tf/>, for once in his anxious 
A44 152 literary career, Hawthorne and his immediate New England audience 
A44 153 were not at home with each other. An aggressive religious 
A44 154 conservative, Orestes A. Brownson, thought the book grossly 
A44 155 immoral. <quote_>"There is an unsound state of public 
A44 156 morals,"<quote/> he complained, <quote_>"when the novelist is 
A44 157 permitted, without a scorching rebuke, to select such crimes, and 
A44 158 to invest them with all the fascination of genius, and all the 
A44 159 charms of a hightly polished style."<quote/> An article in the 
A44 160 <tf_>Church Review<tf/> asked, <quote_>"Is the French era actually 
A44 161 begun in our literature?"<quote/> No, it was just the revisionist 
A44 162 era, the literary emancipation of New England from its old clerical 
A44 163 tyranny. But this rear guard guessed a vital fact behind the book 
A44 164 that admirers did not. Hawthorne was a deeply sexual man. Hester 
A44 165 was the creation of someone who loved women, saw them, as Verdi 
A44 166 did, as necessarily tragic and alone, but emotionally sacred in a 
A44 167 diminished world.<p/>
A44 168 <p_>In revisiting the old Puritan tyranny, Hawthorne was lucky, for 
A44 169 once, in his opportunity. <tf_>The Scarlet Letter<tf/> was his 
A44 170 first and only great literary success in a peculiarly hard and 
A44 171 solitary career as a writer. He was forty-five when he set out to 
A44 172 write the book. He was passionately married to Sophia Peabody, but 
A44 173 except with a few college friends, a bitter, usually silent, man 
A44 174 hard to know and to like. He scorned the uplift philosophy of the 
A44 175 transcendentalists in Concord. Emerson, a prig for all his genius, 
A44 176 could not read fiction intelligently. Hawthorne was unique in the 
A44 177 literary New England of his day - a grimly honest storyteller 
A44 178 fascinated by the perversity in human affairs central to his 
A44 179 hereditary Calvinism.<p/>
A44 180 <p_>Always worried about money, Hawthorne made an uneasy living 
A44 181 writing for magazine editors who paid him a pittance for some of 
A44 182 his greatest stories without recognizing their uniqueness. There 
A44 183 was a lot of hack work behind him. Like so many other American 
A44 184 authors in the nineteenth century, Hawthorne aspired to political 
A44 185 appointments. He was a solid adherent of the Democratic Party, 
A44 186 which as the party of Andrew Jackson officially represented the 
A44 187 masses but so dominated the South that it rejected criticism of 
A44 188 slavery. This suited Hawthorne's lack of political idealism. He 
A44 189 claimed that New England was as large a lump of earth as his heart 
A44 190 could hold. He was fortunate in having as his closest friends 
A44 191 Bowdoin classmates who were influential in the Democratic Party. 
A44 192 One of them was Franklin Pierce, who in 1852 became the fourteenth 
A44 193 president of the United States. In 1846 Hawthorne's party friends 
A44 194 secured him appointment as Surveyor of Salem, his native town. He 
A44 195 needed to show himself in the Custom House for only a few morning 
A44 196 hours before getting back to his writing. In 1848, however, the 
A44 197 Mexican War hero Zachary Taylor, running as a Whig, was elected 
A44 198 President, and when he assumed office in 1849 Hawthorne was 
A44 199 replaced.<p/>
A44 200 <p_>This was devastating. Friends - including Longfellow and James 
A44 201 Russell Lowell - had to raise a subscription for his support. 
A44 202 Hawthorne took his being fired as a summons to begin <tf_>The 
A44 203 Scarlet Letter<tf/>, long in his mind.
