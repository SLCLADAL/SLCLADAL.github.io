**Preparation and session set up**

If you are using this notebook on Google Colab or your own computer and you have not already installed the R packages listed below, you need to install them. You can install them by running the code chunk below. 


```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F}
# install packages
install.packages("dplyr") 
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("udpipe")
```

***


```{r prep2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source='klippy'}
# activate packages
library(dplyr)
library(stringr) 
library(udpipe) 
```

Once you have initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# POS-Tagging with UDPipe

UDPipe allows you to access numerous language models for 64 languages (for an overview of the supported languages and language models see [here](https://ladal.edu.au/postag.html#POS-Tagging_with_UDPipe)). 

To download any of these models, we can use the `udpipe_download_model` function. For example, to download the `english-ewt` model, we would use the call: `m_eng	<- udpipe::udpipe_download_model(language = "english-ewt")`. 

We start by loading  a text

```{r udi1a, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load text
text <- readLines("https://slcladal.github.io/data/testcorpus/linguistics06.txt", skipNul = T) %>%
 str_squish() %>%
  .[1]
# inspect
text
```

Now that we have a text that we can work with, we will download a pre-trained language model.

```{r udi1b, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# download language model
m_eng	<- udpipe::udpipe_download_model(language = "english-ewt")
```


We now load language model.

```{r udi1b, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load language model
m_eng <- udpipe_load_model(file = "/content/english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")
```

We can now use the model to annotate out text.

```{r udi1d, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# tokenise, tag, dependency parsing
text_anndf <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(m_eng, x = text) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::select(-sentence)
# inspect
head(text_anndf, 10)
```

It can be useful to extract only the words and their pos-tags and convert them back into a text format (rather than a tabular format). 

```{r udi2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tagged_text <- paste(text_anndf$token, "/", text_anndf$xpos, collapse = " ", sep = "")
# inspect tagged text
tagged_text
```

# POS-Tagging non-English texts

We can apply the same method for annotating, e.g. adding pos-tags, to other languages. For this, we could train our own model, or, we can use one of the many pre-trained language models that `udpipe` provides.

Let us explore how to do this by using  example texts from different languages, here from German and Spanish (but we could also annotate texts from any of the wide variety of languages for which UDPipe provides pre-trained models.


We begin by loading a German and a Dutch text.

```{r txts, warning=F, message=F}
# load texts
gertext <- readLines("https://slcladal.github.io/data/german.txt") 
duttext <- readLines("https://slcladal.github.io/data/dutch.txt") 
# inspect texts
gertext; duttext
```


Next, we install the pre-trained language models.

```{r udi_mod2, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# download language model
m_ger	<- udpipe::udpipe_download_model(language = "german-gsd")
m_dut	<- udpipe::udpipe_download_model(language = "dutch-alpino")
```

Or we load them from our machine (if we have downloaded and saved them before).

```{r udi_mod4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load language model from your computer after you have downloaded it once
m_ger	<- udpipe::udpipe_load_model(file = "/content/german-gsd-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")
m_dut	<- udpipe::udpipe_load_model(file = "/content/dutch-alpino-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe")
```


Now, pos-tag the German text.


```{r pos_ger, warning=F, message=F}
ger_pos <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(m_ger, x = gertext) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::summarise(postxt = paste(token, "/", xpos, collapse = " ", sep = "")) %>%
  dplyr::pull(unique(postxt))
# inspect
ger_pos
```

And finally, we also pos-tag the Dutch text.


```{r pos_nl, warning=F, message=F}
nl_pos <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(m_dut, x = duttext) %>%
   as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::summarise(postxt = paste(token, "/", xpos, collapse = " ", sep = "")) %>%
  dplyr::pull(unique(postxt))
# inspect
nl_pos
```

# Dependency Parsing Using UDPipe

In addition to pos-tagging, we can also generate plots showing the syntactic dependencies of the different constituents of a sentence. For this, we generate an object that contains a sentence (in this case, the sentence *Linguistics is the scientific study of language*), and we then plot (or visualize) the dependencies using the `textplot_dependencyparser` function.  

```{r udi3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# parse text
sent <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(m_eng, x = "Linguistics is the scientific study of language") %>%
  as.data.frame()
# inspect
head(sent)
```

Before we can generate the plot, we need to install additional packages.

```{r udi5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install and activate necessary packages
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("ggraph")
install.packages("textplot")
```

We now generate the plot.

```{r udi6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load package
library(textplot)
# generate dependency plot
dplot <- textplot_dependencyparser(sent, size = 5) 
# show plot
dplot
```



That's it for this tutorial. We hope that you have enjoyed this tutorial and learned how to annotate texts using language models and perform pos-tagging and dependency parsing.
