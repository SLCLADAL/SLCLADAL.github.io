# Introduction{-}

This tutorial focuses on computational literary stylistics (also digital literary stylistics) and exemplifies how computational literary stylistic analyses can be done in R. This tutorial builds on and expands  @silge2017text (see [here](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)) and the entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/litsty.Rmd). 

**Literary stylistics**

Literary stylistics refers to analyses of the language of literary texts by computational means using linguistic concepts and categories, with the goal of finding patters among the literary texts under investigation and explaining how literary meanings are created by specific language choices and patterning, the linguistic foregrounding, in the text.

Before we continue, we need to define certain terms of concepts that rae related to literary stylistics and that we will use repeatedly in this tutorials and that we need to define so that the analysis shown below makes sense.

*Term Frequency* is the measure of importance of a word in a document or how frequently it appears in that document. However there are some words such as "the","is", "of", etc. which appear frequently even though they might not be important. An approach of using a list of stop-words and removing them before analysis can be useful but in case of some documents these words might be highly relevant. 

*Inverse Document Frequency* decreases the weight for most used words and increases the weight for words that are not much used in a collection of documents. This together with the Term Frequency can be used to calculate a term's *tf-idf* (the multiplication of both the terms) which adjusts the frequency of the term based on how rarely it is used. Mathematically *idf* can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
  idf_{(term)}=  ln (\frac{n_{documents}}{n_{documents\; containing\; term}})
\end{equation}

For this tutorial we will analyze the data set pertaining to Jane Austen's novels.

## Preparation and session set up{-}

This tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/IntroR_workshop.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
# install libraries
install.packages(c("tidytext","janeaustenr","ggplot2"))
```

Once you have installed R and RStudio and initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Getting started{-}

For this tutorial we will be primarily requiring 3 packages: *tidytext*, *janeaustenr* and *tidyverse*. The *tidytext* package provides functions and supporting data sets to allow conversion of text to and from tidy formats, and to switch seamlessly between tidy tools and existing text mining packages. The *janeaustenr* package is used to load the collection of novels by Jane Austen. The *tidyverse* package provides functions for data processing and visualization.

We will start by loading the required packages. 

```{r pack_01, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janeaustenr)
library(tidytext)
library(forcats)
library(quanteda)
```

# Extracting words{-}

```{r kwic_01, eval = F}
austen_texts <- austen_books() %>%
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(text = paste(text, collapse = " ")) %>%
  stringr::str_squish()
names(austen_texts)  <- austen_books() %>%
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(book = unique(book)) %>%
  dplyr::pull(book)
pride <- quanteda::kwic(austen_texts, "pride") %>%
  as.data.frame()
# inspect data
head(pride)
```


# Identifying Keywords{-}

The problem underlying the identification of keywords is to figure out the importance of words in each document. We can assign weights to words that are more characteristic for a text if these terms are used more frequently than expected in a given text. We can then show terms ordered by their relative weight. Using the *bind_tf_idf()* function from the *tidytext* package, we can extract *tf-idf* scores which represent these relative weights and we can also  report other parameters such as number of occurrences of that word, total number of words and term frequency.

```{r book_tf_idf, warning=F, message = F}
book_words <- austen_books() %>%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  dplyr::count(book, word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(total = sum(n))
book_tf_idf <- book_words %>%
  tidytext::bind_tf_idf(word, book, n)
# inspect data
book_tf_idf
```

From the above table it is evident that the extremely common words have a very low inverse document frequency and thus a low tf-idf score. The inverse document frequency will be a higher number for words that occur in fewer documents in the collection of novels.

```{r high_tf_idf}
book_tf_idf %>%
  dplyr::select(-total) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(tf_idf))
```

For better visualisation of the words having high tf-idf scores in Jane Austen's novels the following plots will be helpful.

```{r high_tf_idfplot,  fig.height=8, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Highest tf-idf words in each of Jane Austen's Novels"}
book_tf_idf %>%
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>%
  slice_max(tf_idf, n = 15) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(tf_idf, fct_reorder(word, tf_idf), fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "tf-idf", y = NULL)
```

As you can see, the method has indeed extracted words (and by extension concepts) that are characteristic of the texts. 

# Extracting Structural Features{-}

Extracting structural features of texts is a very common and has a wide range of applications. 

## Word-Frequency Distributions{-}

Next, we load Jane Austen's novels and determine term-frequency and then determine idf.

```{r book_words, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
book_words <- austen_books() %>%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  dplyr::count(book, word, sort = TRUE)  %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(total = sum(n))
# inspect data
head(book_words)
```

From the above table it is evident that the usual suspects "the", "and" ,"to" and so-forth are leading in terms of their usage in that book. Now let us look at the distribution of *n/total* for each novel, which actually is the term frequency.

```{r tfplot, message = F, warning = F, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Term frequency distribution in Jane Austen's novels"}
ggplot(book_words, aes(n/total, fill = book)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlim(NA, 0.0009) +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y")
```
From the plots it is clear that there many words which occur rarely and fewer words that occur frequently. 


## Zipf's Law{-}

Zipf's Law represents an empirical power law or power function that was established in the 1930s and it is the most fundamental law in linguistics [see @george1935zipf]. This law states that the frequency that a word is inversely proportional to its rank in a text or collection of texts. 

Let
* N be the number of elements in a text (or collection of texts);
* k be their rank;
* s be the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution.

Zipf's law then predicts that out of a population of N elements, the normalized frequency of the element of rank k, f(k;s,N), is:

\begin{equation}
f(k;s,N)={\frac {1/k^{s}}{\sum \limits _{n=1}^{N}(1/n^{s})}} 
\end{equation}

In the code chunk below, we check if Zipf's Law applies to the words that occur in Jane Austen's novels.

```{r Zipf}
freq_by_rank <- book_words %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(rank = row_number(), 
         `term frequency` = n/total) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()
# inspect data
freq_by_rank
```

To get a better understating of Zipf's law, let us visualize the distribution by plotting on the logged rank of elements on the x-axis and logged frequency of the terms on the y-axis.

```{r fr, fig.width=5, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap="Zipf's law for Jane Austen's novels"}
freq_by_rank %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color = book)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

We can see that the plot has a negative slope which corroborates the inverse relationship of rank with respect to term frequency which shows that the words in Jane Austin's novels follow Zipf's law. 



## Lexical Diversity{-}

Lexical diversity is a complexity measure that provides information about the lexicon size of a text, i.e. how many different words occur in a text given the size of the text. Typically higher values indicate higher lexical diversity. For example, the Type-Token-Ratio (TTR) provides information about the number of word tokens (individual instances of a word) divided by the number of different word types (word forms).

To elaborate, the sentence *The dog chased the cat* contains five tokens but only 4 types because *the* occurs twice. More complex texts or more advanced learners of a language commonly have higher TTRs compared to simpler texts or less advanced language learners.

In the following example, we calculate the TTRs for the novels of Jane Austen.

```{r ttr, message=F, warning=F}
austen_books <- austen_books() %>%
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(text = paste(text, collapse = " "))
austen <- austen_books %>%
  dplyr::pull(text)
names(austen) <- austen_books %>%
  dplyr::pull(book)
tokens_austen <- austen %>%
  quanteda::corpus() %>%
  quanteda::tokens()
# inspect data
head(tokens_austen)
```


```{r}
dfm(tokens_austen, remove = stopwords("en")) %>%
  quanteda::textstat_lexdiv(measure = "all") %>%
  tidyr::gather(Measure, Value, TTR:lgeV0) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Measure = factor(Measure)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Measure %in% c("TTR")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Value, y = reorder(document, Value))) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Type-Token-Ratio (TTR)") +
  ylab("")
```



### Average Sentence Length{-}

```{r asl, warning=F, message=F}
library(lexRankr)
austen_sentences <- austen_books() %>%
  dplyr::group_by(book) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(text = paste(text, collapse = " ")) %>%
  lexRankr::unnest_sentences(sentence, text)
# inspect data
head(austen_sentences)
```


```{r}
austen_sentences %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sentlength = stringr::str_count(sentence, '\\w+')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sentlength, y = book, group = book)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point")   +          
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2) +
  xlab("Average Sentence Length (ASL)") +
  ylab("")
```

## Similarity among literary texts{-}

```{r clust, eval = F}
feature_mat <- austen %>%
  quanteda::corpus() %>%
  quanteda::dfm(remove_punct = TRUE, remove_url = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE) %>% 
  quanteda::dfm_remove(pattern = stopwords("en"))
# inspect data
ndoc(feature_mat)
```
```{r}
topfeatures(feature_mat)
```

```{r}
austen_dist <- as.dist(textstat_dist(feature_mat))
austen_clust <- hclust(austen_dist)
plot(austen_clust)
```

## Networks of Personas{-}

```{r net_01, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
romeo <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/romeo.txt", sep = "\t")
# convert into feature co-occurrence matrix
romeo_fcm <- as.fcm(as.matrix(romeo))
# inspect data
romeo_fcm
```




```{r net_05, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
textplot_network(romeo_fcm, min_freq = 0.1, edge_alpha = 0.1, edge_size = 5)
```
