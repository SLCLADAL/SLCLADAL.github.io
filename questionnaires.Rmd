# Introduction

This tutorial focuses on questionnaires and surveys. The "R"-code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/questionnairesrscript.r).

Questionnaires and surveys are widely used in language research and thus one of the most common research designs. In this section, we will discuss what needs to kept in mind when designing questionaires and surveys, what pieces of software or plattforms one can use, options for visualizing questionnaire and survey data, statistical methods that are used to evaluate questionnaire and survey data (reliability), and which statistical methods are used in analyzing the data.
