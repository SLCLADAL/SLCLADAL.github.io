## Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python{-}

The [Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) is a website that hosts an online textbook which offers an introduction to the programming language Python that is specifically designed for people interested in the humanities and social sciences.

## Sydney Corpus Lab

The [Sydney Corpus Lab](https://sydneycorpuslab.com/) aims to promote corpus linguistics in Australia. Itâ€™s a virtual, rather than a physical lab, and is an online platform for connecting computer-based linguists across the University of Sydney and beyond. Its mission is to build research capacity in corpus linguistics at the University of Sydney, to connect Australian corpus linguists, and to promote the method in Australia, both in linguistics and in other disciplines. We have strong links with the Sydney Centre for Language Research (Computational Approaches to Language node) and the Sydney Digital Humanities Research Group. 

## Text Crunching Centre{-}

At the [Text Crunching Centre](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/TCC.html), a team of experts in Natural Language Processing supports your text technology needs. The TCC is part of the Department of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich and it is a service offered to all departments of the University of Zurich as well as to external partners or customers.
