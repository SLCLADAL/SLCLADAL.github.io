# Introduction

This tutorial introduces tables and shows how to tabulate data. The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/introtablesrscript.r).

# Preparation and session set up

As all visualizations in this tutorial rely on "R", it is necessary to install "RStudio" (a programm which makes working with R particularly user-friendly). If "RStudio" is not already installed on your machine, please search for "RStudio" in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory). Once you have installed "RStudio", open it.

In addition, we prepare our session by clearing the workspace, setting options, and installing certain "libraries" or "packages" that we need in this tutorial. Thus, please install the libraries by running the code below this paragraph (simply copy and paste the code into the editor window of RStudio and select "Run" from the task bar above) - the installation may take some time (depending on the number and the nature of the libraries it may take a couple of minutes).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("rtweet", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidytext",
                   "twitteR"))
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Introduction

Tables are one of the most important ways to describe data. This tutorial describes different types of tables, how to load and save different types of tables, as well as how to manipulate tables.

When working with R, there are different types of tables that have different characteristics. The most common types of tables in "R" are:

* matrices
* data frames
* tibbels

Matrices can only contain one type of data and all data points will be converted to the type of scale with the lowest information value. For instance, if at least one variables in a table represents characters (or strings), then all other variables are also converted into characters although they may be numbers. 

Data frames can contain different types of scales and variables are not converted automatically. In this sense, data frames are more flexible and are preferrable over matrices.

Tibbles are a new type of data frame that are created when working in the tidyverse dialect of "R". The tidyverse is a new "dialect" of "R" that is particularly user-friendly and specifically designed to make it easier to transform, process, and visualize data. The tidyverse style of "R" is associated with a set of libraries that allow the use tidyverse style (e.g. the packages "dplyr", "tidy", "tidyverse", "ggplot2"). 

# Loading tables into R

There are several different functions that allow us to read tabulated data into R. If the data is stored as a txt file, there are various functions to read in the data. The most common functiosn are "read.delim" and "read.table". 

```{r lt2, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data with read.delim
mytable <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mlrdata.txt", header = TRUE)
# show first 6 lines of table
head(mytable)
```

```{r lt3, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data with read.delim
myothertable <- read.table("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mlrdata.txt", header = TRUE)
# show first 6 lines of table
head(myothertable)
```

When a tables should be loaded from Excel, it is neccessary to load the "xlsx" library. The example below only works if you exchange the path with your own path to an xls or xlsx file. This is because if we want to load data from the LADAL server, loading the table becomes slightly more complex. You can try it out loading an xls or xlsx file with some xls or xlsx file on your own computer though.

```{r lt1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(xlsx)
# load table into R
# WARNING! set your own path!
mytable <- read.xlsx("D:\\Uni\\UQ\\LADAL\\SLCLADAL.github.io\\data/testdata1.xlsx", 1)
# show first 6 lines of table
head(mytable)
```

The following section shows how to access and manipulate tables.

```{r uq2, echo=F, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/uq2.jpg")
