# Introduction

This tutorial introduces tables and shows how to tabulate data. The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/introtablesrscript.r).

# Preparation and session set up

As all caluculations and visualizations in this tutorial rely on "R", it is necessary to install "R", "RStudio", and "Tinn-R". If these programms (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not already installed on your machine, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain "libraries" or "packages" need to be installed so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the librariesby running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the libraries mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary libraries, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("rtweet", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidytext",
                   "twitteR"))
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Introduction

Tables are one of the most important ways to describe data. This tutorial describes different types of tables, how to load and save different types of tables, as well as how to manipulate tables.

When working with R, there are different types of tables that have different characteristics. The most common types of tables in "R" are:

* matrices
* data frames
* tibbels

Matrices can only contain one type of data and all data points will be converted to the type of scale with the lowest information value. For instance, if at least one variables in a table represents characters (or strings), then all other variables are also converted into characters although they may be numbers. 

Data frames can contain different types of scales and variables are not converted automatically. In this sense, data frames are more flexible and are preferrable over matrices.

Tibbles are a new type of data frame that are created when working in the tidyverse dialect of "R". The tidyverse is a new "dialect" of "R" that is particularly user-friendly and specifically designed to make it easier to transform, process, and visualize data. The tidyverse style of "R" is associated with a set of libraries that allow the use tidyverse style (e.g. the packages "dplyr", "tidy", "tidyverse", "ggplot2"). 

# Loading tables into R

There are several different functions that allow us to read tabulated data into R. If the data is stored as a txt file, there are various functions to read in the data. The most common functiosn are "read.delim" and "read.table". 

```{r lt2, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data with read.delim
mytable <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mlrdata.txt", header = TRUE)
# show first 6 lines of table
head(mytable)
```

```{r lt3, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data with read.delim
myothertable <- read.table("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mlrdata.txt", header = TRUE)
# show first 6 lines of table
head(myothertable)
```

When a tables should be loaded from Excel, it is neccessary to load the "xlsx" library. The example below only works if you exchange the path with your own path to an xls or xlsx file. This is because if we want to load data from the LADAL server, loading the table becomes slightly more complex. You can try it out loading an xls or xlsx file with some xls or xlsx file on your own computer though.

```{r lt1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(xlsx)
# load table into R
# WARNING! set your own path!
mytable <- read.xlsx("D:\\Uni\\UQ\\LADAL\\SLCLADAL.github.io\\data/testdata1.xlsx", 1)
# show first 6 lines of table
head(mytable)
```

The following section shows how to access and manipulate tables.

```{r uq2, echo=F, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/uq2.jpg")
