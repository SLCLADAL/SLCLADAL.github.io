<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This workshop introduces mixed-effects regression modeling using R. The R-markdown document for the tutorial can be downloaded <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/mmws.Rmd">here</a>. You will find more elaborate explanations and additional examples <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/regression.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The workshop consists of 2 parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Theoretical background and basics This part deals with main concepts and the underlying logic of linear and logistic (mixed-effects) regression models</p></li>
<li><p>Practical example and potential issues This part focuses on the practical implementation of linear and logistic mixed-models.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Fixed Effects Regression</h1>
<p>Before turning to mixed-effects models which are able to represent hierarchical data structures, we will focus on traditional fixed effects regression models and begin with multiple linear regression.</p>
<div id="simple-linear-regression" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Simple Linear Regression</h2>
<p>The idea behind regression analysis is expressed formally in the equation below where<span class="math inline">\(f_{(x)}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-value we want to predict, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis), <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the coefficient (the slope of the regression line).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_{(x)} = \alpha + \beta_{i}x + \epsilon\)</span></p>
<p>In other words, to estimate how much some weights who is 180cm tall, we would multiply the coefficent (slope of the line) with 180 (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) and add the value of the intercept (point where line crosses the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis).</p>
<p>Residuals are the distance between the line and the points (the red lines) and it is also called <em>variance</em>. Regression lines are those lines where the sum of the red lines should be minimal. The slope of the regression line is called <em>coefficient</em> and the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis is called the <em>intercept</em>.</p>

<p>The Estimate for the intercept is the value of y at x = 0 (or, if the y-axis is located at x = 0, the value of y where the regression line crosses the y-axis). The estimate for Date represents the slope of the regression line and tells us that with each year, the predicted frequency of prepositions increase by .01732 prepositions. The t-value is the Estimate divided by the standard error (Std. Error). Based on the t-value, the p-value can be calculated manually as shown below.</p>

<p>The <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>-values tell us how much variance is explained by our model. The baseline value represents a model that uses merely the mean. 0.0105 means that our model explains only 1.05 percent of the variance (0.010 x 100) - which is a tiny amount. The problem of the multiple R<sup>2</sup> is that it will increase even if we add variables that explain almost no variance. Hence, multiple R<sup>2</sup> encourages the inclusion of <em>junk</em> variables.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

R^2_{multiple} = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar y)^2}

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The adjusted R<sup>2</sup>-value takes the number of predictors into account and, thus, the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> will always be lower than the multiple R<sup>2</sup>. This is so because the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> penalizes models for having predictors. The equation for the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> below shows that the amount of variance that is explained by all the variables in the model (the top part of the fraction) must outweigh the inclusion of the number of variables (k) (lower part of the fraction). Thus, the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> will decrease when variables are added that explain little or even no variance while it will increase if variables are added that explain a lot of variance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

R^2_{adjusted} = 1 - (\frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k - 1})

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>If there is a big difference between the two R<sup>2</sup>-values, then the model contains (many) predictors that do not explain much variance which is not good. The F-statistic and the associated p-value tell us that the model, despite explaining almost no variance, is still significantly better than an intercept-only base-line model (or using the overall mean to predict the frequency of prepositions per text).</p>
<p>We can test this and also see where the F-values comes from by comparing the</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create intercept-only base-line model

<p>The F- and p-values are exactly those reported by the summary which shows where the F-values comes from and what they mean; namely they denote the difference between the base-line and the more saturated model.</p>
<p>The degrees of freedom associated with the residual standard error are the number of cases in the model minus the number of predictors (including the intercept). The residual standard error is the square root of the sum of the squared residuals of the model divided by the degrees of freedom. Have a look at he following to clear this up:</p>

<p>The left graph shows the residuals of the model (i.e., the differences between the observed and the values predicted by the regression model). The problem with this plot is that the residuals are not standardized and so they cannot be compared to the residuals of other models. To remedy this deficiency, residuals are normalized by dividing the residuals by their standard deviation. Then, the normalized residuals can be plotted against the observed values (centre panel). In this way, not only are standardized residuals obtained, but the values of the residuals are transformed into z-values, and one can use the z-distribution to find problematic data points. There are three rules of thumb regarding finding problematic data points through standardized residuals <span class="citation">(Field, Miles, and Field <a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>, 268–69)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Points with values higher than 3.29 should be removed from the data.</p></li>
<li><p>If more than 1% of the data points have values higher than 2.58, then the error rate of our model is too high.</p></li>
<li><p>If more than 5% of the data points have values greater than 1.96, then the error rate of our model is too high.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The right panel shows the <em>studentized residuals</em> (adjusted predicted values: each data point is divided by the standard error of the residuals). In this way, it is possible to use Student’s t-distribution to diagnose our model.</p>
<p>Adjusted predicted values are residuals of a special kind: the model is calculated without a data point and then used to predict this data point. The difference between the observed data point and its predicted value is then called the adjusted predicted value. In summary, studentized residuals are very useful because they allow us to identify influential data points.</p>
<p>The plots show that there are two potentially problematic data points (the top-most and bottom-most point). These two points are clearly different from the other data points and may therefore be outliers. We will test later if these points need to be removed.</p>
<p>We will now generate more diagnostic plots.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load package
library(ggfortify)
# generate plots
autoplot(m1.lm) + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) </code></pre>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/slr13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The diagnostic plots are very positive and we will go through why this is so for each panel. The graph in the upper left panel is useful for finding outliers or for determining the correlation between residuals and predicted values: when a trend becomes visible in the line or points (e.g., a rising trend or a zigzag line), then this would indicate that the model would be problematic (in such cases, it can help to remove data points that are too influential (outliers)).</p>
<p>The graphic in the upper right panel indicates whether the residuals are normally distributed (which is desirable) or whether the residuals do not follow a normal distribution. If the points lie on the line, the residuals follow a normal distribution. For example, if the points are not on the line at the top and bottom, it shows that the model does not predict small and large values well and that it therefore does not have a good fit.</p>
<p>The graphic in the lower left panel provides information about <em>homoscedasticity</em>. Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the residuals remains constant and does not correlate with any independent variable. In unproblematic cases, the graphic shows a flat line. If there is a trend in the line, we are dealing with heteroscedasticity, that is, a correlation between independent variables and the residuals, which is very problematic for regressions.</p>
<p>The graph in the lower right panel shows problematic influential data points that disproportionately affect the regression (this would be problematic). If such influential data points are present, they should be either weighted (one could generate a robust rather than a simple linear regression) or they must be removed. The graph displays Cook’s distance, which shows how the regression changes when a model without this data point is calculated. The cook distance thus shows the influence a data point has on the regression as a whole. Data points that have a Cook’s distance value greater than 1 are problematic <span class="citation">(Field, Miles, and Field <a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>, 269)</span>.</p>
<p>The so-called leverage is also a measure that indicates how strongly a data point affects the accuracy of the regression. Leverage values range between 0 (no influence) and 1 (strong influence: suboptimal!). To test whether a specific data point has a high leverage value, we calculate a cut-off point that indicates whether the leverage is too strong or still acceptable. The following two formulas are used for this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

Leverage_A_ = \frac{3(k + 1)}{n}

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

Leverage_B_ = \frac{2(k + 1)}{n}

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>We will look more closely at leverage in the context of multiple linear regression and will therefore end the current analysis by summarizing the results of the regression analysis in a table.</p>

A visual assessment of the model diagnostic graphics did not indicate any problematic or disproportionately influential data points (outliers) and performed significantly better compared to an intercept-only base line model but only explained .87 percent of the variance (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>: .0087, F-statistic (1, 535): 5,68, p-value: 0.0175*). The final minimal adequate linear regression model is based on 537 data points and confirms a significant and positive correlation between the year in which the text was written and the relative frequency of prepositions (coefficient estimate: .02, SE: 0.01, t-value: 2.38, p-value: .0175*).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Multiple Linear Regression</h2>
<p>In contrast to simple linear regression, which estimates the effect of a single predictor, multiple linear regression estimates the effect of various predictor (see the equation below). A multiple linear regression can thus test the effects of various predictors simultaneously.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

f_{(x)} = \alpha + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2}x_{i+1} + \dots + \beta_{n}x_{i+n} + \epsilon

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>There exists a wealth of literature focusing on multiple linear regressions and the concepts it is based on. For instance, there are <span class="citation">Achen (<a href="#ref-achen1982interpreting" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Bortz (<a href="#ref-bortz2006statistik" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Crawley (<a href="#ref-crawley2005statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Faraway (<a href="#ref-faraway2002practical" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Field, Miles, and Field (<a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> (my personal favorite), <span class="citation">Gries (<a href="#ref-gries2021statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Levshina (<a href="#ref-levshina2015linguistics" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Wilcox (<a href="#ref-wilcox2009basic" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> to name just a few. Introductions to regression modeling in R are <span class="citation">Baayen (<a href="#ref-baayen2008analyzing" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Crawley (<a href="#ref-crawley2012r" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Gries (<a href="#ref-gries2021statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, or <span class="citation">Levshina (<a href="#ref-levshina2015linguistics" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The model diagnostics we are dealing with here are partly identical to the diagnostic methods discussed in the section on simple linear regression. Because of this overlap, diagnostics will only be described in more detail if they have not been described in the section on simple linear regression.</p>
<p>A brief note on minimum necessary sample or data set size appears necessary here. Although there appears to be a general assumption that 25 data points per group are sufficient, this is not necessarily correct (it is merely a general rule of thumb that is actually often incorrect). Such rules of thumb are inadequate because the required sample size depends on the number of variables in a given model, the size of the effect and the variance of the effect. If a model contains many variables, then this requires a larger sample size than a model which only uses very few predictors. Also, to detect an effect with a very minor effect size, one needs a substantially larger sample compared to cases where the effect is very strong. In fact, when dealing with small effects, model require a minimum of 600 cases to reliably detect these effects. Finally, effects that are very robust and do not vary much require a much smaller sample size compared with effects that are spurious and vary substantially. Since the sample size depends on the effect size and variance as well as the number of variables, there is no final one-size-fits-all answer to what the best sample size is.</p>
<p>Another, slightly better but still incorrect, rule of thumb is that the more data, the better. This is not correct because models based on too many cases are prone for overfitting and thus report correlations as being significant that are not. However, given that there are procedures that can correct for overfitting, larger data sets are still preferable to data sets that are simply too small to warrant reliable results. In conclusion, it remains true that the sample size depends on the effect under investigation.</p>
<p>Despite there being no ultimate rule of thumb, <span class="citation">Field, Miles, and Field (<a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> 273-275), based on <span class="citation">Green (<a href="#ref-green1991many" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>, provide data-driven suggestions for the minimal size of data required for regression models that aim to find medium sized effects (k = number of predictors; categorical variables with more than two levels should be transformed into dummy variables):</p>
<ul>
<li>If one is merely interested in the overall model fit (something I have not encountered), then the sample size should be at least 50 + k (k = number of predictors in model).</li>
<li>If one is only interested in the effect of specific variables, then the sample size should be at least 104 + k (k = number of predictors in model).</li>
<li>If one is only interested in both model fit and the effect of specific variables, then the sample size should be at least the higher value of 50 + k or 104 + k (k = number of predictors in model).</li>
</ul>
<p>You will see in the R code below that there is already a function that tests whether the sample size is sufficient.</p>

<p>The data set consist of three variables stored in three columns. The first column contains the relationship status of the women, the second whether the man is interested in the woman, and the third column represents the money spend on the present. The data set represents 100 cases and the mean amount of money spend on a present is 88.38 dollars. In a next step, we visualize the data to get a more detailed impression of the relationships between variables.</p>

<h3>Fit linear model</h3>
<p>We will now start to implement the regression model. In a first step, we create two saturated models that contain all possible predictors (main effects and interactions). The two models are identical but one is generated with the <code>lm</code> and the other with the <code>glm</code> function as these functions offer different model parameters in their output.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m1.mlr = lm(                      # generate lm regression object
  money ~ 1 + attraction*status,  # def. rgression formula (1 = intercept)
  data = mlrdata)                 # def. data
m1.glm = glm(                     # generate glm regression object
  money ~ 1 + attraction*status,  # def. rgression formula (1 = intercept)
  family = gaussian,              # def. linkage function
  data = mlrdata)                 # def. data</code></pre>
<p>After generating the saturated models we can now start with the model fitting. Model fitting refers to a process that aims at find the model that explains a maximum of variance with a minimum of predictors <span class="citation">(see Field, Miles, and Field <a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>, 318)</span>. Model fitting is therefore based on the <em>principle of parsimony</em> which is related to Occam’s razor according to which explanations that require fewer assumptions are more likely to be true.</p>
</div>
<div id="automatic-model-fitting-and-why-you-should-not-use-it" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Automatic Model Fitting and Why You Should Not Use It</h3>
<p>In this section, we will use a step-wise step-down procedure that uses decreases in AIC (<em>Akaike Information Criterion</em>) as the criterion to minimize the model in a step-wise manner. This procedure aims at finding the model with the lowest AIC values by evaluating - step-by-step - whether the removal of a predictor (term) leads to a lower AIC value.</p>
<p>We use this method here just so that you know it exists and how to implement it but you should rather avoid using automated model fitting. The reason for avoiding automated model fitting is that the algorithsm only checks if the AIC has decreased but not if the model is stable or reliable. Thus, automated model fitting has the problem that you can never be sure that the way that lead you to the final model is reliable and that all models were indeed stable. Imagine you want to climb down from a roof top and you have a ladder. The problem is that you do not know if and how many steps are broken. This is similar to using automated model fitting. In other sections, we will explore better methods to fit models (manual step-wise step-up and step-down procedures, for example).</p>
<p>The AIC is calculated using the equation below. The lower the AIC value, the better the balance between explained variance and the number of predictors. AIC values can and should only be compared for models that are fit on the same dataset with the same (number of) cases (<span class="math inline">\(LL\)</span> stands for LogLikelihood and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> represents the number of predictors in the model).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) = -2LL + 2k
\label{eq:aic}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>An alternative to the AIC is the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Both AIC and BIC penalize models for including variables in a model. The penalty of the BIC is bigger than the penalty of the AIC and it includes the number of cases in the model (<em>LL</em> stands for <em>logged likelihood</em> or <em>LogLikelihood</em>, <em>k</em> represents the number of predictors in the model (including the intercept), and <em>N</em> represents the number of cases in the model).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) = -2LL + 2k * log(N) 
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Interactions are evaluated first and only if all insignificant interactions have been removed would the procedure start removing insignificant main effects (that are not part of significant interactions). Other model fitting procedures (forced entry, step-wise step up, hierarchical) are discussed during the implementation of other regression models. We cannot discuss all procedures here as model fitting is rather complex and a discussion of even the most common procedures would to lengthy and time consuming at this point. It is important to note though that there is not perfect model fitting procedure and automated approaches should be handled with care as they are likely to ignore violations of model parameters that can be detected during manual - but time consuming - model fitting procedures. As a general rule of thumb, it is advisable to fit models as carefully and deliberately as possible. We will now begin to fit the model.</p>

<p>The first element of the report is called <em>Call</em> and it reports the regression formula of the model. Then, the report provides the residual distribution (the range, median and quartiles of the residuals) which allows drawing inferences about the distribution of differences between observed and expected values. If the residuals are distributed non-normally, then this is a strong indicator that the model is unstable and unreliable because mathematical assumptions on which the model is based are violated.</p>
<p>Next, the model summary reports the most important part: a table with model statistics of the fixed-effects structure of the model. The table contains the estimates (coefficients of the predictors), standard errors, t-values, and the p-values which show whether a predictor significantly correlates with the dependent variable that the model investigates.</p>
<p>All main effects (status and attraction) as well as the interaction between status and attraction is reported as being significantly correlated with the dependent variable (money). An interaction occurs if a correlation between the dependent variable and a predictor is affected by another predictor.</p>
<p>The top most term is called intercept and has a value of 99.15 which represents the base estimate to which all other estimates refer. To exemplify what this means, let us consider what the model would predict a man would spend on a present for a women who is single but the man is not attracted to her: The amount he would spend (based on the model would be 99.15 dollars (the intercept) plus 57.69 dollars (because she is single) minus 47.66 dollars (because he is not interested in her) minus 63.18 dollars because of the interaction between status and attraction.</p>

<div id="outlier-detection" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Outlier Detection</h3>
<p>After implementing the multiple regression, we now need to look for outliers and perform the model diagnostics by testing whether removing data points disproportionately decreases model fit. To begin with, we generate diagnostic plots.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load package
library(ggfortify)
# generate plots
autoplot(m2.mlr) + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) </code></pre>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/mlr11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The plots do not show severe probelms such as funnel shaped patterns or drastic deviations from the diagonal line in Normal Q-Q plot (have a look at the explanation of what to look for and how to interpret these diagnostic plots in the section on simple linear regression) but data points 52, 64, and 83 are repeatedly indicated as potential outliers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># determine a cutoff for data points that have D-values higher than 4/(n-k-1)
cutoff &lt;- 4/((nrow(mlrdata)-length(m2.mlr$coefficients)-2))
# start plotting
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))           # display plots in 3 rows/2 columns
qqPlot(m2.mlr, main=&quot;QQ Plot&quot;) # create qq-plot</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 52 83</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(m2.mlr, which=4, cook.levels = cutoff); par(mfrow = c(1, 1))</code></pre>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/mlr12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The graphs indicate that data points 52, 64, and 83 may be problematic. We will therefore statistically evaluate whether these data points need to be removed. In order to find out which data points require removal, we extract the influence measure statistics and add them to out data set.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># extract influence statistics
infl &lt;- influence.measures(m2.mlr)
# add infl. statistics to data
mlrdata &lt;- data.frame(mlrdata, infl[[1]], infl[[2]])
# annotate too influential data points
remove &lt;- apply(infl$is.inf, 1, function(x) {
  ifelse(x == TRUE, return(&quot;remove&quot;), return(&quot;keep&quot;)) } )
# add annotation to data

# number of rows after removing outliers

Beta errors (or <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-errors) refer to the erroneous assumption that a predictor is not significant (based on the analysis and given the sample) although it does have an effect in the population. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-error means to overlook a significant effect because of weaknesses of the analysis. The test statistics ranges between 0 and 1 where lower values are better. If the values approximate 1, then there is serious concern as the model is not reliable given the sample size. In such cases, unfortunately, the best option is to increase the sample size.</p>

<p>Although <span class="citation">Field, Miles, and Field (<a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> suggest that the main effects of the predictors involved in the interaction should not be interpreted, they are interpreted here to illustrate how the results of a multiple linear regression can be reported. Accordingly, the results of the regression analysis performed above can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>A multiple linear regression was fitted to the data using an automated, step-wise, AIC-based (Akaike’s Information Criterion) procedure. The model fitting arrived at a final minimal model. During the model diagnostics, two outliers were detected and removed. Further diagnostics did not find other issues after the removal.</p>
<p>The final minimal adequate regression model is based on 98 data points and performs highly significantly better than a minimal baseline model (multiple R<sup>2</sup>: .857, adjusted R<sup>2</sup>: .853, F-statistic (3, 94): 154.4, AIC: 850.4, BIC: 863.32, p&lt;.001<sup><span class="math inline">\(***\)</span></sup>). The final minimal adequate regression model reports <em>attraction</em> and <em>status</em> as significant main effects. The relationship status of women correlates highly significantly and positively with the amount of money spend on the women’s presents (SE: 5.14, t-value: 10.87, p&lt;.001<sup><span class="math inline">\(***\)</span></sup>). This shows that men spend 156.8 dollars on presents are single while they spend 99,15 dollars if the women are in a relationship. Whether men are attracted to women also correlates highly significantly and positively with the money they spend on women (SE: 5.09, t-values: -9.37, p&lt;.001<sup><span class="math inline">\(***\)</span></sup>). If men are not interested in women, they spend 47.66 dollar less on a present for women compared with women the men are interested in.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the final minimal adequate regression model reports a highly significant interaction between relationship <em>status</em> and <em>attraction</em> (SE: 7.27, t-value: -8.18, p&lt;.001<sup><span class="math inline">\(***\)</span></sup>): If women are single but man are not interested in them, men spend 59.46 dollars less on their presents compared to all other constellations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Multiple Binomial Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>Logistic regression is a multivariate analysis technique that builds on and is very similar in terms of its implementation to linear regression but logistic regressions take dependent variables that represent nominal rather than numeric scaling <span class="citation">(Harrell Jr <a href="#ref-harrell2015regression" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. The difference requires that the linear regression must be modified in certain ways to avoid producing non-sensical outcomes. The most fundamental difference between logistic and linear regressions is that logistic regression work on the probabilities of an outcome (the likelihood), rather than the outcome itself. In addition, the likelihoods on which the logistic regression works must be logged (logarithmized) in order to avoid produce predictions that produce values greater than 1 (instance occurs) and 0 (instance does not occur). You can check this by logging the values from -10 to 10 using the <code>plogis</code> function as shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>round(plogis(-10:10), 5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 0.00005 0.00012 0.00034 0.00091 0.00247 0.00669 0.01799 0.04743 0.11920
## [10] 0.26894 0.50000 0.73106 0.88080 0.95257 0.98201 0.99331 0.99753 0.99909
## [19] 0.99966 0.99988 0.99995</code></pre>
<p>If we visualize these logged values, we get an S-shaped curve which reflects the logistic function.</p>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/blm0b-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>To understand what this mean, we will use a very simple example. In this example, we want to see whether the height of men affect their likelihood of being in a relationship. The data we use represents a data set consisting of two variables: height and relationship.</p>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/blm1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The left panel of the Figure above shows that a linear model would predict values for the relationship status, which represents a factor (0 = Not in Relationship and 1 = In Relationship), that are nonsensical because values above or below 1 do not make sense if the only options are 0 OR 1. The logistic function shown in the right panel of the Figure above solves this problem by working on the logged probabilities of an outcome rather than on the actual outcome.</p>

<h3>Example 1: EH in Kiwi English</h3>
<p>To exemplify how to implement a logistic regression in R <span class="citation">(see Agresti <a href="#ref-agresti1996introduction" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>; Agresti and Kateri <a href="#ref-agresti2011categorical" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> for very good and thorough introductions to this topic], we will analyze the use of the discourse particle <em>eh</em> in New Zealand English and test which factors correlate with its occurrence. The data set represents speech units in a corpus that were coded for the speaker who uttered a given speech unit, the gender, ethnicity, and age of that speaker and whether or not the speech unit contained an <em>eh</em>. To begin with, we clean the current work space, set option, install and activate relevant packages, load customized functions, and load the example data set.</p>

<p>The summary of the data show that the data set contains 25,821 observations of five variables. The variable <code>ID</code> contains strings that represent a combination file and speaker of a speech unit. The second variable represents the gender, the third the age, and the fourth the ethnicity of speakers. The fifth variable represents whether or not a speech unit contained the discourse particle <em>eh</em>.</p>
<p>Next, we factorize the variables in our data set. In other words, we specify that the strings represent variable levels and define new reference levels because as a default <code>R</code> will use the variable level which first occurs in alphabet ordering as the reference level for each variable, we redefine the variable levels for Age and Ethnicity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blrdata &lt;- blrdata %&gt;%
  # factorize variables
  dplyr::mutate(Age = factor(Age),
                Gender = factor(Gender),
                Ethnicity = factor(Ethnicity),
                ID = factor(ID),
                EH = factor(EH)) %&gt;%
  # relevel Age (Reference = Young) and Ethnicity (Reference= Pakeha))
  dplyr::mutate(Age = relevel(Age, &quot;Young&quot;),
                Ethnicity = relevel(Ethnicity, &quot;Pakeha&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>After preparing the data, we will now plot the data to get an overview of potential relationships between variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blrdata %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(EH = ifelse(EH == &quot;0&quot;, 0, 1)) %&gt;%

<p>With respect to main effects, the Figure above indicates that men use <em>eh</em> more frequently than women, that young speakers use it more frequently compared with old speakers, and that speakers that are descendants of European settlers (Pakeha) use <em>eh</em> more frequently compared with Maori (the native inhabitants of New Zealand).</p>
<p>The plots in the lower panels do not indicate significant interactions between use of <em>eh</em> and the Age, Gender, and Ethnicity of speakers. In a next step, we will start building the logistic regression model.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-building" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Model Building</h3>
<p>As a first step, we need to define contrasts and use the <code>datadist</code> function to store aspects of our variables that can be accessed later when plotting and summarizing the model. Contrasts define what and how variable levels should be compared and therefore influences how the results of the regression analysis are presented. In this case, we use treatment contrasts which are in-built. Treatment contrasts mean that we assess the significance of levels of a predictor against a baseline which is the reference level of a predictor. <span class="citation">Field, Miles, and Field (<a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>, 414–27)</span> and <span class="citation">Gries (<a href="#ref-gries2021statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> provide very good and accessible explanations of contrasts and how to manually define contrasts if you would like to know more.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load packages
library(rms)
# set contrasts
options(contrasts  =c(&quot;contr.treatment&quot;, &quot;contr.poly&quot;))
# create distance matrix
blrdata.dist &lt;- datadist(blrdata)
# include distance matrix in options
options(datadist = &quot;blrdata.dist&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we generate a minimal model that predicts the use of <em>eh</em> solely based on the intercept.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># baseline glm model
m0.glm = glm(EH ~ 1, family = binomial, data = blrdata)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="model-fitting" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Model fitting</h3>
<p>We will now start with the model fitting procedure. In the present case, we will use a manual step-wise step-up procedure during which predictors are added to the model if they significantly improve the model fit. In addition, we will perform diagnostics as we fit the model at each step of the model fitting process rather than after the fitting.</p>
<p>We will test two things in particular: whether the data has incomplete information or complete separation and if the model suffers from (multi-)collinearity.</p>
<p>Incomplete information or complete separation means that the data does not contain all combinations of the predictor or the dependent variable. This is important because if the data does not contain cases of all combinations, the model will assume that it has found a perfect predictor. In such cases the model overestimates the effect of that that predictor and the results of that model are no longer reliable. For example, if <em>eh</em> was only used by young speakers in the data, the model would jump on that fact and say <em>Ha! If there is an old speaker, that means that that speaker will never ever and under no circumstances say </em>eh* - I can therefore ignore all other factors!*</p>
<p>Multicollinearity means that predictors correlate and have shared variance. This means that whichever predictor is included first will take all the variance that it can explain and the remaining part of the variable that is shared will not be attributed to the other predictor. This may lead to reporting that a factor is not significant because all of the variance it can explain is already accounted for. However, if the other predictor were included first, then the original predictor would be returned as insignificant. This means that- depending on the order in which predictors are added - the results of the regression can differ dramatically and the model is therefore not reliable. Multicollinearity is actually a very common problem and there are various ways to deal with it but it cannot be ignored (at least in regression analyses).</p>
<p>We will start by adding <code>Age</code> to the minimal adequate model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># check incomplete information

<p>As the data does not contain incomplete information, the vif values are below 3, and adding <code>Age</code> has significantly improved the model fit (the p-value of the ANOVA is lower than .05). We therefore proceed with <code>Age</code> included.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Mixed-Effects Regression</h1>
<p>In contrast to fixed-effects regression models, mixed-effects models assume a hierarchical data structure in which data points are grouped or nested in higher order categories (e.g. students within classes). Mixed-effects models are rapidly increasing in use in data analysis because they allow us to incorporate hierarchical or nested data structures. Mixed-effects models are, of course, an extension of fixed-effects regression models and also multivariate and come in different types.</p>
<p>In the following, we will go over the most relevant and frequently used types of mixed-effect regression models, mixed-effects linear regression models and mixed-effects binomial logistic regression models.</p>
<p>The major difference between these types of models is that they take different types of dependent variables. While linear models take numeric dependent variables, logistic models take nominal variables.</p>
<div id="linear-mixed-effects-regression" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Linear Mixed-Effects Regression</h2>
<p>The following focuses on an extension of ordinary multiple linear regressions: mixed-effects regression linear regression. Mixed-effects models have the following advantages over simpler statistical tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mixed-effects models are multivariate, i.e. they test the effect of several predictors simultaneously while controlling for the effect of all other predictors.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixed models allow to statistically incorporate within-speaker variability and are thus fit to model hierarchical or nested data structures. This applies if several observations are produced by an individual speaker, for instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixed-models provide a wealth of diagnostic statistics which enables us to control e.g. (multi-)collinearity, i.e. correlations between predictors, and to test whether conditions or requirements are violated (e.g. homogeneity of variance, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Major disadvantages of mixed-effects regression modeling are that they are prone to producing high <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-errors <span class="citation">(see Johnson <a href="#ref-johnson2009getting" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> and that they require rather large data sets.</p>
<div id="introduction-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>So far, the regression models that we have used only had fixed-effects. Having only fixed-effects means that all data points are treated as if they are completely independent and thus on the same hierarchical level. However, it is very common that the data is nested in the sense that data points are not independent because they are, for instance produced by the same speaker or are grouped by some other characteristic. In such cases, the data is considered hierarchical and statistical models should incorporate such structural features of the data they work upon. With respect to regression modeling, hierarchical structures are incorporated by what is called <em>random effects</em>. When models only have a fixed-effects structure, then they make use of only a single intercept and/or slope (as in the left panel in the figure below), while mixed effects models have intercepts for each level of a random effect. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this would mean that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and/or slope for each speaker (in addition to the overall intercept that is shown as an orange line in the figure below).</p>

<h3>Random Effects</h3>
<p><em>Random Effects</em> can be visualized using two parameters: the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x equals 0) and the slope (the acclivity of the regression line). In contrast to fixed-effects models, that have only 1 intercept and one slope (left panel in the figure above), mixed-effects models can therefore have various <em>random intercepts</em> (center panel) or various <em>random slopes</em>, or both, various <em>random intercepts</em> and various <em>random slopes</em> (right panel).</p>
<p>What features do distinguish random and fixed effects?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Random effects represent a higher level variable under which data points are grouped. This implies that random effects must be categorical (or nominal but <em>they a´cannot be continuous</em>!) <span class="citation">(see Winter <a href="#ref-winter2019statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>, 236)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Random effects represent a sample of an infinite number of possible levels. For instance, speakers, trials, items, subjects, or words represent a potentially infinite pool of elements from which many different samples can be drawn. Thus, random effects represent a random sample sample. Fixed effects, on the other hand, typically do not represent a random sample but a fixed set of variable levels (e.g. Age groups, or parts-of-speech).</p></li>
<li><p>Random effects typically represent many different levels while fixed effects typically have only a few. <span class="citation">Zuur, Hilbe, and Ieno (<a href="#ref-zuur2013beginner" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> propose that a variable may be used as a fixed effect if it has less than 5 levels while it should be treated as a random effect if it has more than 10 levels. Variables with 5 to 10 levels can be used as both. However, this is a rule of thumb and ignores the theoretical reasons (random sample and nestedness) for considering something as a random effect and it also is at odds with the way that repeated measures are models (namely as mixed effects) although they typically only have very few levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed effects represent an effect that if we draw many samples, the effect would be consistent across samples <span class="citation">(Winter <a href="#ref-winter2019statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> while random effects should vary for each new sample that is drawn.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Models with only random intercepts are more common because including both random intercepts and random slopes requires larger data sets (but have a better fit because intercepts are not forced to be parallel and the lines therefore have a better fit). Always think about what random effects structure is appropriate for your model <span class="citation">(see Winter <a href="#ref-winter2019statistics" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>, 241–44)</span>. Mixed-effects are called mixed-effects because they contain both random and fixed effects.</p>
<p>Random effects are added first.</p>

<p>The data set contains the date when the text was written (Date), the genre of the text (Genre), the name of the text (Text), the relative frequency of prepositions in the text (Prepositions), and the region in which the text was written (Region).

<p>Centering or even scaling numeric variables is useful for later interpretation of regression models: if the date variable were not centered, the regression would show the effects of variables at year 0(!). If numeric variables are centered, other variables are variables are considered relative not to 0 but to the mean of that variable (in this case the mean of years in our data). Centering simply means that the mean of the numeric variable is subtracted from each value.</p>

<p>We now set up a fixed-effects model with the <code>glm</code> function and a mixed-effects model using the <code>glmer</code> function with Genre as a random effect.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load package
library(lme4)
# generate models
m0.glm &lt;- glm(Prepositions ~ 1, family = gaussian, data = lmmdata)
m0.lmer = lmer(Prepositions ~ 1 + (1|Genre), data = lmmdata)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have created the base-line models, we will test whether including a random effect structure is mathematically justified. It is important to note here that we are not going to test if including a random effect structure is theoretically motivated but simply if it causes a decrease in variance.</p>
</div>
<div id="testing-random-effects" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Testing Random Effects</h3>
<p>As a first step in the modeling process, we now need to determine whether or not including a random effect structure is justified. We do so by comparing the AIC of the base-line model without random intercepts to the AIC of the model with random intercepts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>AIC(logLik(m0.glm))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4718</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>AIC(logLik(m0.lmer))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4498</code></pre>
<p>The inclusion of a random effect structure with random intercepts is justified as the AIC of the model with random intercepts is substantially lower than the AIC of the model without random intercepts.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-fitting-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Model Fitting</h3>
<p>After having determined that including a random effect structure is justified, we can continue by fitting the model and including diagnostics as we go. Including diagnostics in the model fitting process can save time and prevent relying on models which only turn out to be unstable if we would perform the diagnostics after the fact.</p>
<p>We begin fitting our model by adding Date as a fixed effect and compare this model to our mixed-effects base-line model to see if Date improved the model fit by explaining variance and if Date significantly correlates with our dependent variable (this means that the difference between the models is the effect (size) of “Date”!)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m1.lmer &lt;- lmer(Prepositions ~ (1|Genre) + Date, data = lmmdata)
anova(m1.lmer, m0.lmer, test = &quot;Chi&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## refitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Data: lmmdata

## m1.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date

## m0.lmer    3 4502 4515  -2248     4496

<p>The model with Date is the better model (significant p-value and lower AIC). The significant p-value shows that <em>Date</em> correlates significantly with <em>Prepositions</em> (<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>(1) = 8.93, p = .0028). The <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup> value here is labeled <em>Chisq</em> and the degrees of freedom are calculated by subtracting the smaller number of DFs from the larger number of DFs.</p>
<p>We now test whether Region should also be part of the final minimal adequate model. The easiest way to add predictors is by using the <code>update</code> function (it saves time and typing).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># generate model
m2.lmer &lt;- update(m1.lmer, .~.+ Region)
# test vifs
car::vif(m2.lmer)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Date Region 
##  1.203  1.203</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># compare models                
anova(m2.lmer, m1.lmer, test = &quot;Chi&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## refitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Data: lmmdata
## Models:
## m1.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date
## m2.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date + Region
##         npar  AIC  BIC logLik deviance Chisq Df Pr(&gt;Chisq)
## m1.lmer    4 4495 4512  -2244     4487                    
## m2.lmer    5 4495 4516  -2242     4485  2.39  1       0.12</code></pre>
<p>Three things tell us that Region should not be included: (i) the AIC does not decrease, (ii) the BIC increases(!), and the p-value is higher than .05. This means, that we will continue fitting the model without having Region included. Well… not quite - just as a note on including variables: while Region is not significant as a main effect, it must still be included in a model if it were part of a significant interaction. To test if this is indeed the case, we fit another model with the interaction between Date and Region as predictor.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># generate model
m3.lmer &lt;- update(m1.lmer, .~.+Region*Date)
# extract vifs
car::vif(m3.lmer)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        Date      Region Date:Region 
##       1.969       1.203       1.780</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># compare models                
anova(m3.lmer, m1.lmer, test = &quot;Chi&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## refitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Data: lmmdata
## Models:
## m1.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date
## m3.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date + Region + Date:Region
##         npar  AIC  BIC logLik deviance Chisq Df Pr(&gt;Chisq)
## m1.lmer    4 4495 4512  -2244     4487                    
## m3.lmer    6 4496 4522  -2242     4484  2.89  2       0.24</code></pre>
<p>Again, the high p-value and the increase in AIC and BIC show that we have found our minimal adequate model with only contains Date as a main effect. In a next step, we can inspect the final minimal adequate model, i.e. the most parsimonious (the model that explains a maximum of variance with a minimum of predictors).</p>

<h3>Model Diagnostics</h3>
<p>We can now evaluate the goodness of fit of the model and check if mathematical requirements and assumptions have been violated. In a first step, we generate diagnostic plots that focus on the random effect structure.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(m1.lmer, Genre ~ resid(.), abline = 0 ) # generate diagnostic plots</code></pre>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/lmm14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The plot shows that there are some outliers (points outside the boxes) and that the variability within letters is greater than in other genres we therefore examine the genres in isolation standardized residuals versus fitted values <span class="citation">(Pinheiro and Bates <a href="#ref-pinheiro2000mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>, 175)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(m1.lmer, resid(., type = &quot;pearson&quot;) ~ fitted(.) | Genre, id = 0.05, 
     adj = -0.3, pch = 20, col = &quot;gray40&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/lmm15-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The plot shows the standardized residuals (or Pearson’s residuals) versus fitted values and suggests that there are outliers in the data (the names elements in the plots). To check if these outliers are a cause for concern, we will now use a Levene’s test to check if the variance is distributed homogeneously (homoscedasticity) or whether the assumption of variance homogeneity is violated (due to the outliers).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The use of Levene’s test to check if the model is heteroscedastic is generally not recommended as it is too lax when dealing with few observations (because in such cases it does not have the power to identify heteroscedasticity) while it is too harsh when dealing with many observations (when heteroscedasticity typically is not a severe problem).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We use Levene’s test here merely to check if it substantiates the impressions we got from the visual inspection.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># check homogeneity
leveneTest(lmmdata$Prepositions, lmmdata$Genre, center = mean)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in leveneTest.default(lmmdata$Prepositions, lmmdata$Genre, center =
## mean): lmmdata$Genre coerced to factor.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = mean)

<p>The Levene’s test shows that the variance is distributed unevenly across genres which means that we do not simply continue but should either remove problematic data points (outliers) or use a weighing method.</p>
<p>In this case, we create a new model which uses weights to compensate for heterogeneity of variance and thus the influence of outliers - which is an alternative to removing the data points and rerunning the analysis <span class="citation">(Pinheiro and Bates <a href="#ref-pinheiro2000mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>, 177)</span>. However, to do so, we need to use a different function (the <code>lme</code> function) which means that we have to create two models: the <em>old</em> minimal adequate model and the <em>new</em> minimal adequate model with added weights. After we have created these models, we will compare them to see if including weights has improved the fit.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load package

<p>The weight model (m5.lmer) that uses weights to account for unequal variance is performing significantly better than the model without weights (m4.lmer) and we therefore switch to the weight model and inspect its parameters.</p>

</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The <em>marginal R<sup>2</sup></em> (marginal coefficient of determination) represents the variance explained by the fixed effects while the <em>conditional R<sup>2</sup></em> is interpreted as a variance explained by the entire model, including both fixed and random effects <span class="citation">(Bartoń <a href="#ref-barton2020mumin" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The respective call for the model is:</p>

<p>The effects can be visualized using the <code>plot_model</code> function from the <code>sjPlot</code> package.</p>

<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/lmm21d-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>While we have already shown that the effect of Date is significant, it is small which means that the number of prepositions per text does not correlate very strongly with time. This suggests that other factors that are not included in the model also impact the frequency of prepositions (and probably more meaningfully, too).</p>
<p>Before turning to the diagnostics, we will use the fitted (or predicted) and the observed values with a regression line for the predicted values. This will not only show how good the model fit the data but also the direction and magnitude of the effect.</p>

<h3>Model Diagnostics</h3>
<p>We now create diagnostic plots. What we wish to see in the diagnostic plots is a cloud of dots in the middle of the window without any structure. What we do not want to see is a funnel-shaped cloud because this indicates an increase of the errors/residuals with an increase of the predictor(s) (because this would indicate heteroscedasticity) <span class="citation">(Pinheiro and Bates <a href="#ref-pinheiro2000mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>, 182)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># start plotting
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))           # display plots in 2 rows and 2 columns

<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/lmm22-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What a wonderful unstructured cloud - the lack of structure tells us that the model is “healthy” and does not suffer from heteroscedasticity. We will now create more diagnostic plots to find potential problems <span class="citation">(Pinheiro and Bates <a href="#ref-pinheiro2000mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>, 21)</span>.</p>

<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/lmm23-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In contrast to the unweight model, no data points are named which indicates that the outliers do no longer have unwarranted influence on the model. Now, we check the residuals of fitted values against observed values <span class="citation">(Pinheiro and Bates <a href="#ref-pinheiro2000mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>, 179)</span>. What we would like to see is a straight, upwards going line.</p>

<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/lmm24-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A beautiful, straight line! The qqplot does not indicate any problems. It is, unfortunately, rather common that the dots deviate from the straight line at the very bottom or the very top which means that the model is good at estimating values around the middle of the dependent variable but rather bad at estimating lower or higher values. Next, we check the residuals by “Genre” <span class="citation">(Pinheiro and Bates <a href="#ref-pinheiro2000mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>, 179)</span>.</p>

<p>Beautiful straight lines - perfection! Now, we inspect the observed responses versus the within-group fitted values <span class="citation">(Pinheiro and Bates <a href="#ref-pinheiro2000mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>, 178)</span>.</p>

<h3>Remarks on Prediction</h3>
<p>While the number of intercepts, the model reports, and the way how mixed- and fixed-effects arrive at predictions differ, their predictions are extremely similar and almost identical (at least when dealing with a simple random effect structure). Consider the following example where we create analogous fixed and mixed effect models and plot their predicted frequencies of prepositions per genre across the un-centered date of composition. The predictions of the mixed-effects model are plotted as a solid red line, while the predictions of the fixed-effects model are plotted as dashed blue lines.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Mixed-Effects Binomial Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>We now turn to an extension of binomial logistic regression: mixed-effects binomial logistic regression. As is the case with linear mixed-effects models logistic mixed effects models have the following advantages over simpler statistical tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mixed-effects models are multivariate, i.e. they test the effect of several predictors simultaneously while controlling for the effect of all other predictors.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixed models allow to statistically incorporate within-speaker variability and are thus fit to model hierarchical or nested data structures. This applies if several observations are produced by an individual speaker, for instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixed-models provide a wealth of diagnostic statistics which enables us to control e.g. multicollinearity, i.e. correlations between predictors, and to test whether conditions or requirements are violated (e.g. homogeneity of variance, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Major disadvantages of regression modeling are that they are prone to producing high <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-errors <span class="citation">(see Johnson <a href="#ref-johnson2009getting" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> and that they require rather large data sets.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As is the case with linear mixed-effects models, binomial logistic mixed-effect models are multivariate analyses that treat data points as hierarchical or grouped in some way. In other words, they take into account that the data is nested in the sense that data points are produced by the same speaker or are grouped by some other characteristics. In mixed-models, hierarchical structures are modelled as <em>random effects</em>. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this means that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and/or slope for each speaker.</p>
<p><em>Random Effects</em> in linear models can be visualized using two parameters: the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0) and the slope (the acclivity of the regression line). In contrast to linear mixed-effects models, random effects differ in the position and the slope of the logistic function that is applied to the likelihood of the dependent variable. <em>random intercepts</em> (center left panel ) or various <em>random slopes</em> (center right panel ), or both, various <em>random intercepts</em> and various <em>random slopes</em> (right panel ). In the following, we will only focus on models with random intercepts because this is the by far more common method and because including both random intercepts and random slopes requires huge amounts of data. Consider the Figure below to understand what is meant by “random intercepts”.</p>
<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/blmm1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The upper left panel merely shows the logistic curve representing the predictions of a fixed-effects logistic regression with a single intercept and slope. The upper right panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a of a mixed-effects logistic regression with random intercepts for each level of a grouping variable. The lower left panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a mixed-effects logistic regression with one intercept but random slopes for each level of a grouping variable. The lower right panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a mixed-effects logistic regression with random intercepts and random slopes for each level of a grouping variable.</p>
<p>After adding random intercepts, predictors (or fixed effects) are added to the model (just like with multiple regression). So mixed-effects are called mixed-effects because they contain both random and fixed effects.</p>
<p>In terms of general procedure, random effects are added first, and only after we have ascertained that including random effects is warranted, we test whether including fixed-effects is warranted <span class="citation">(Field, Miles, and Field <a href="#ref-field2012discovering" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. We test whether including random effects is warranted by comparing a model, that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the base intercept, with a model that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the intercepts of the random effect. If the mixed-effects model explains significantly more variance than the fixed-effects model without random effect structure, then we continue with the mixed-effects model. In other words, including random effects is justified.</p>

<h3>Example: Discourse LIKE in Irish English</h3>
<p>In this example we will investigate which factors correlate with the use of <em>final discourse like</em> (e.g. “<em>The weather is shite, like!</em>”) in Irish English. The data set represents speech units in a corpus that were coded for the speaker who uttered a given speech unit, the gender (Gender: Men versus Women) and age of that speaker (Age: Old versus Young), whether the interlocutors were of the same or a different gender (ConversationType: SameGender versus MixedGender), and whether another <em>final discourse like</em> had been used up to three speech units before (Priming: NoPrime versus Prime), whether or not the speech unit contained an <em>final discourse like</em> (SUFLike: 1 = yes, 0 = no.

<p>Before continuing, a few words about the minimum number of random effect levels and the minimum number of observations per random effect level are in order.</p>
<p>While many data points per random variable level increases statistical power and thus to more robust estimates of the random effects <span class="citation">(Austin and Leckie <a href="#ref-austin2018multilevel" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, it has been shown that small numbers of observations per random effect variable level do not cause serious bias and it does not negatively affect the estimates of the fixed-effects coefficients <span class="citation">(Bell, Ferron, and Kromrey <a href="#ref-bell2008multilevel" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Clarke <a href="#ref-clarke2008can" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Clarke and Wheaton <a href="#ref-clarke2007addressing" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; Maas and Hox <a href="#ref-maas2005sufficient" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. The minimum number of observations per random effect variable level is therefore 1.</p>
<p>In simulation study, <span class="citation">(Bell, Ferron, and Kromrey <a href="#ref-bell2008multilevel" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> tested the impact of random variable levels with only a single observation ranging from 0 to 70 percent. As long as there was a relatively high number of random effect variable levels (500 or more), small numbers of observations had almost no impact on bias and Type 1 error control.</p>
<p>We now plot the data to inspect the relationships within the data set.</p>

<p>The upper left panel in the Figure above indicates that men use discourse <em>like</em> more frequently than women. The center right panel suggests that priming significantly increases the likelihood of discourse like being used. The center left panel suggests that speakers use discourse like more frequently in mixed-gender conversations. However, the lower right panel indicates an interaction between gender and conversation type as women appear to use discourse like less frequently in same gender conversations while the conversation type does not seem to have an effect on men. After visualizing the data, we will now turn to the model building process.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-building-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Model Building</h3>
<p>In a first step, we set the options.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set options
options(contrasts  =c(&quot;contr.treatment&quot;, &quot;contr.poly&quot;))
mblrdata.dist &lt;- datadist(mblrdata)
options(datadist = &quot;mblrdata.dist&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In a next step, we generate fixed-effects minimal base-line models and a base-line mixed-model using the “glmer” function with a random intercept for ID (a lmer object of the final minimal adequate model will be created later).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># baseline model glm
m0.glm = glm(SUFlike ~ 1, family = binomial, data = mblrdata) 
# base-line mixed-model
m0.glmer = glmer(SUFlike ~ (1|ID), data = mblrdata, family = binomial) </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="testing-the-random-effect" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Testing the Random Effect</h3>
<p>Now, we check if including the random effect is permitted by comparing the AICs from the glm to AIC from the glmer model. If the AIC of the glmer object is smaller than the AIC of the glm object, then this indicates that including random intercepts is justified.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>aic.glmer &lt;- AIC(logLik(m0.glmer))
aic.glm &lt;- AIC(logLik(m0.glm))
aic.glmer; aic.glm</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1828</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1838</code></pre>
<p>The AIC of the glmer object is smaller which shows that including the random intercepts is justified. To confirm whether the AIC reduction is sufficient for justifying the inclusion of a random-effect structure, we also test whether the mixed-effects minimal base-line model explains significantly more variance by applying a Model Likelihood Ratio Test to the fixed- and the mixed effects minimal base-line models.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># test random effects
null.id = -2 * logLik(m0.glm) + 2 * logLik(m0.glmer)
pchisq(as.numeric(null.id), df=1, lower.tail=F) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.0006314</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># sig m0.glmer better than m0.glm</code></pre>
<p>The p-value of the Model Likelihood Ratio Test is lower than .05 which shows that the inclusion of the random-effects structure is warranted. We can now continue with the model fitting process.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-fitting-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Model Fitting</h3>
<p>The next step is to fit the model which means that we aim to find the “best” model, i.e. the minimal adequate model. In this case, we will use a manual step-wise step-up, forward elimination procedure. Before we begin with the model fitting process we need to add ´control = glmerControl(optimizer = “bobyqa”)´ to avoid unnecessary failures to converge.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m0.glmer &lt;- glmer(SUFlike ~ 1+ (1|ID), family = binomial, data = mblrdata, control=glmerControl(optimizer=&quot;bobyqa&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>During each step of the fitting procedure, we test whether certain assumptions on which the model relies are violated. To avoid <em>incomplete information</em> (a combination of variables does not occur in the data), we tabulate the variables we intend to include and make sure that all possible combinations are present in the data. Including variables although not all combinations are present in the data would lead to unreliable models that report (vastly) inaccurate results. A special case of incomplete information is <em>complete separation</em> which occurs if one predictor perfectly explains an outcome (in that case the incomplete information would be caused by a level of the dependent variable). In addition, we make sure that the VIFs do not exceed a maximum of 3 for main effects <span class="citation">(Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick <a href="#ref-zuur2010protocol" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> - <span class="citation">Booth GD (<a href="#ref-booth1994regression" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> suggest that VIFs should ideally be lower than 3 for as higher values would indicate multicollinearity and thus that the model is unstable. The value of 3 should be taken with a pinch of salt because there is no clear consensus about what the maximum VIF for interactions should be or if it should be considered at all. The reason is that we would, of course, expect the VIFs to increase when we are dealing with interactions as the main effects that are part of the interaction are very likely to correlate with the interaction itself. However, if the VIFs are too high, then this will still cause the issues with the attribution of variance. The value of 3 was chosen based on recommendations in the standard literature on multicollinearity <span class="citation">(Zuur et al. <a href="#ref-zuur2009mixedmodels" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Neter, Wasserman, and Kutner <a href="#ref-neter1990vif" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span>. Only once we have confirmed that the incomplete information, complete separation, and <em>multicollinearity</em> are not a major concern, we generate the more saturated model and test whether the inclusion of a predictor leads to a significant reduction in residual deviance. If the predictor explains a significant amount of variance, it is retained in the model while being disregarded in case it does not explain a sufficient quantity of variance.</p>

<p>The ANOVAs show that <em>Age</em> is not significant and the first ANOVA also shows that the BIC has increased which indicates that <em>Age</em> does not decrease variance. In such cases, the variable should not be included.</p>
<p>However, if the second ANOVA would report <em>Age</em> as being marginally significant, a case could be made for including it but it would be better to change the ordering in which predictors are added to the model. This is, however, just a theoretical issue here as <em>Age</em> is clearly not significant.</p>

<h3>Visualizing Effects</h3>
<p>As we will see the effects in the final summary, we visualize the effects here by showing the probability of discourse <em>like</em> based on the predicted values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># extract predicted values

<p>A proper visualization of the marginal effects can be extracted using the <code>sjPlot</code> package.</p>

<p><img src="mmws_files/figure-html/blmm33b-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see that discourse like is more likely to surface in primed contexts but that in contrast to women and men in same-gender conversations as well as women in mixed-gender conversations, priming appears to affect the use of discourse like by men in mixed-gender conversations only very little.</p>

<h3>Extracting Model Fit Parameters</h3>
<p>We now extract model fit parameters <span class="citation">(Baayen <a href="#ref-baayen2008analyzing" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>, 281)</span>.</p>

<p>The two lines that start with <code>probs</code> are simply two different ways to do the same thing (you only need one of these).</p>
<p>The model fit parameters indicate a suboptimal fit. Both the C-value and Somers’s D<sub>xy</sub> show poor fit between predicted and observed occurrences of discourse <em>like</em>. If the C-value is 0.5, the predictions are random, while the predictions are perfect if the C-value is 1. C-values above 0.8 indicate real predictive capacity <span class="citation">(Baayen <a href="#ref-baayen2008analyzing" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>, 204)</span>. Somers’ D<sub>xy</sub> is a value that represents a rank correlation between predicted probabilities and observed responses. Somers’ D<sub>xy</sub> values range between 0, which indicates complete randomness, and 1, which indicates perfect prediction <span class="citation">(Baayen <a href="#ref-baayen2008analyzing" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>, 204)</span>. The value of .2646 suggests that the model has some predictive and explanatory power, but not a lot. We will now perform the model diagnostics.</p>

The final minimal adequate model performed significantly better than an intercept-only base line model (<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>(4): <code>r 173.3278, p  = 0) and a good but not optimal fit (C: 0.7583, Somers' D~xy~: 0.5167).
