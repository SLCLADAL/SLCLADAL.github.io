![An interactive LADAL notebook](https://slcladal.github.io/images/uq1.jpg)


This tutorial is the interactive Jupyter notebook accompanying the [*Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory* (LADAL) tutorial *Regular Expressions in R*](https://ladal.edu.au/regex.html). 


**Preparation and session set up**

We set up our session by activating the packages we need for this tutorial. 


```{r prep2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(htmlwidgets)
```

Once you have initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

If you are using this notebook on your own computer and you have not already installed the R packages listed above, you need to install them. You can install them by replacing the `library` command with `install.packages` and putting the name of the package into quotation marks like this: `install.packages("dplyr")`. Then, you simply run this command and R will install the package you specified.

# Getting started with Regular Expressions

To put regular expressions into practice, we need some text that we will perform out searches on. In this tutorial, we will use texts from wikipedia about grammar.

```{r regex01, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read in first text
text1 <- readLines("https://slcladal.github.io/data/testcorpus/linguistics02.txt")
et <-  paste(text1, sep = " ", collapse = " ")
# inspect example text
et
```

In addition, we will split the example text into words to have another resource we can use to understand regular expressions

```{r regex02, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# split example text
set <- str_split(et, " ") %>%
  unlist()
# inspect
head(set)
```

## Using your own data

While the tutorial uses data from the LADAL website, you can also use your own data. You can see below what you need to do to upload and use your own data.

The code chunk below allows you to upload two files from your own computer. To be able to load your own data, you need to click on the folder symbol to the left of the screen:

![Binder Folder Symbol](https://slcladal.github.io/images/binderfolder.JPG)


Then on the upload symbol.

Next, upload the files you want to analyze and then the respective files names in the file argument of the scan function. When you then execute the code (like to code chunk below, you will upload your own data.

```{r}
mytext1 <- scan(file = "linguistics01.txt",
            what = "char", 
            sep = "", 
            quote = "", 
            quiet = T, 
            skipNul = T) %>%
            paste0(collapse = " ")
mytext2 <- scan(file = "linguistics02.txt",
            what = "char", 
            sep = "", 
            quote = "", 
            quiet = T, 
            skipNul = T) %>%
            paste0(collapse = " ")
# inspect
mytext1; mytext2

```


**Keep in mind though that you need to adapt the names of the texts in the code chunks below so that the code below work on your own texts!**

Before we delve into using regular expressions, we will have a look at the regular expressions that can be used in R and also check what they stand for.

There are three basic types of regular expressions:

* regular expressions that stand for individual symbols and determine frequencies

* regular expressions that stand for classes of symbols

* regular expressions that stand for structural properties

The regular expressions below show the first type of regular expressions, i.e. regular expressions that stand for individual symbols and determine frequencies.

The regular expressions below show the second type of regular expressions, i.e. regular expressions that stand for classes of symbols.

The regular expressions that denote classes of symbols are enclosed in `[]` and `:`. The last type of regular expressions, i.e. regular expressions that stand for structural properties are shown below.

# Practice

In this section, we will explore how to use regular expressions. At the end, we will go through some exercises to help you understand how you can best utilize regular expressions.

Show all words in the split example text that contain `a` or `n`.

```{r regex10, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set[str_detect(set, "[an]")]
```

Show all words in the split example text that begin with a lower case `a`.

```{r regex11, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set[str_detect(set, "^a")]
```

Show all words in the split example text that end in a lower case `s`.

```{r regex12, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set[str_detect(set, "s$")]
```

Show all words in the split example text in which there is an `e`, then any other character, and than another `n`.

```{r regex13, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set[str_detect(set, "e.n")]
```

Show all words in the split example text in which there is an `e`, then two other characters, and than another `n`.

```{r regex14, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set[str_detect(set, "e.{2,2}n")]
```

Show all words that consist of exactly three alphabetical characters in the split example text.

```{r regex15, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set[str_detect(set, "^[:alpha:]{3,3}$")]
```

Show all words that consist of six or more alphabetical characters in the split example text.

```{r regex16, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set[str_detect(set, "^[:alpha:]{6,}$")]
```

Replace all lower case `a`s with upper case `E`s in the example text.

```{r regex17, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_replace_all(et, "a", "E")
```

Remove all non-alphabetical characters in the split example text.

```{r regex18, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_remove_all(set, "\\W")
```

Remove all white spaces in the example text.

```{r regex19, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_remove_all(et, " ")
```
