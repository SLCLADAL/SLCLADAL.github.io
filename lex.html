<div id="introduction" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This tutorial introduces lexicography with R and shows how to use R to create dictionaries and find synonyms through determining semantic similarity in R. While the initial example focuses on English, subsequent sections show how easily this approach can be generalized to languages other than English (e.g. German, French, Spanish, Italian, or Dutch). The entire R-markdown document for the sections below can be downloaded <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/lex.Rmd">here</a>.</p>
<div id="preparation-and-session-set-up" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Preparation and session set up</h2>
<p>This tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/IntroR_workshop.html">here</a>. For this tutorials, we need to install certain <em>packages</em> from an R <em>library</em> so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options(&quot;scipen&quot; = 100, &quot;digits&quot; = 4) # suppress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c(&quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;tidytext&quot;, &quot;textdata&quot;, &quot;quanteda&quot;, &quot;koRpus&quot;, 
                   &quot;koRpus.lang.en&quot;, &quot;DT&quot;, &quot;hunspell&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Once you have installed R Studio and initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creating-dictionaries" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Creating dictionaries</h1>
<p>In a first step, we load the necessary packages from the library and define the location of the engine which we use for the part-of-speech tagging. In this case, we will use the TreeTagger <span class="citation">(see Schmid <a href="#ref-schmid1994treetagger" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>, <a href="#ref-schmid2013probabilistic" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Schmid et al. <a href="#ref-schmid2007enriched" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>,)</span>. How to install and then use the TreeTagger for English as well as for German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch is demonstrated and explained <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/tagging.html#TreeTagger:_pos-tagging_languages_other_than_English">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>You will have to install TreeTagger and change the path used below (<code>"C:\\TreeTagger\\bin\\tag-english.bat"</code>) to the location where you have installed TreeTagger on your machine. If you do not know how to install TreeTagger or encounter problems, read <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/tagging.html">this tutorial</a>!</p>
<p>In addition, you can download the pos-tagged text <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/data/orwell.txt">here</a> so you can sinply skip the next code chunk and load the data as shown below.</p>
<hr />
<pre class="r"><code># activate packages
library(tidyr)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)
library(textdata)
library(quanteda)
library(koRpus)
library(koRpus.lang.en)
library(DT)
library(hunspell)
library(coop)
library(dplyr)
library(tm)
library(cluster)
# define location of pos-tagger engine
set.kRp.env(TT.cmd=&quot;C:\\TreeTagger\\bin\\tag-english.bat&quot;, lang=&quot;en&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>In a next step, we load and process the data which in this tutorial represents the text from George Orwell’s <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>. We will not pre-process the data by for instance repairing broken or otherwise compromised words and continue by directly implementing the part-of-speech tagger.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load and pos-tag data
orwell_pos &lt;- treetag(&quot;https://slcladal.github.io/data/orwell.txt&quot;)
# select data frame
orwell_pos &lt;- orwell_pos@tokens
# inspect  results
datatable(head(orwell_pos, 100), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), filter = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If you could not pos-tag the text, you can simply execute the following code chunk which loads the pos-tagged text from the LADAL repository.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load pos-taged data
orwell_pos &lt;- read.delim(&quot;https://slcladal.github.io/data/orwell_pos.txt&quot;, sep = &quot;\t&quot;, header = T)
# inspect  results
datatable(head(orwell_pos, 100), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), filter = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>

<h2>Cleaning dictionary entries</h2>
<p>However, as the resulting table shows, the data is still very noisy, i.e. it contains a lot of <em>non-words</em>, i.e words that may be mis-spelled, broken, or otherwise compromised. In order to get rid of these, we can simply check if the word lemma exists in an existing dictionary. When you aim to identify exactly those words that are not yet part of an established dictionary, you could of course do it the other way around and remove all words that are already present in an existing dictionary.</p>

<p>To make it a bit more interesting but also keep this tutorial simple and straight-forward, we will add information about the polarity and emotionally of the words in our dictionary. We can do this by performing a sentiment analysis on the lemmas using the <code>tidytext</code> package.</p>
<p>The <code>tidytext</code> package contains three sentiment dictionaries (<code>nrc</code>, <code>bing</code>, and <code>afinn</code>). For the present purpose, we use the <code>ncr</code>dictionary which represents the Word-Emotion Association Lexicon <span class="citation">(@ Mohammad and Turney <a href="#ref-mohammad2013crowdsourcing" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. The Word-Emotion Association Lexicon which comprises 10,170 terms, and in which lexical elements are assigned scores based on ratings gathered through the crowd-sourced Amazon Mechanical Turk service. For the Word-Emotion Association Lexicon raters were asked whether a given word was associated with one of eight emotions. The resulting associations between terms and emotions are based on 38,726 ratings from 2,216 raters who answered a sequence of questions for each word which were then fed into the emotion association rating (see <span class="citation">Mohammad and Turney (<a href="#ref-mohammad2013crowdsourcing" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>). Each term was rated 5 times. For 85 percent of words, at least 4 raters provided identical ratings. For instance, the word <em>cry</em> or <em>tragedy</em> are more readily associated with SADNESS while words such as <em>happy</em> or <em>beautiful</em> are indicative of JOY and words like <em>fit</em> or <em>burst</em> may indicate ANGER. This means that the sentiment analysis here allows us to investigate the expression of certain core emotions rather than merely classifying statements along the lines of a crude positive-negative distinction.</p>
<p>To be able to use the Word-Emotion Association Lexicon we need to add another column to our data frame called <code>word</code> which simply contains the lemmatized word. The reason is that the lexicon expects this column and only works if it finds a word column in the data. The code below shows how to add the emotion and polarity entries to our dictionary.</p>

<div id="finding-synonyms" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Finding synonyms</h1>
<p>Another task that is quite common in lexicography is to determine if words share some form of relationship such as whether they are synonyms or antonyms. In computational linguistics, this is commonly determined based on the collocational profiles of words. These collocational profiles are also called <em>word vectors</em> or <em>word embeddings</em> and approaches which determine semantic similarity based on collocational profiles or word embeddings are called distributional approaches (or distributional semantics). The basic assumption of distributional approaches is that words that occur in the same context and therefore have similar collocational profiles are also semantically similar. In fact, various packages, such as <code>qdap</code> or , <code>wordnet</code> already provide synonyms for terms (all of which are based on similar collocational profiles) but we would like to determine if words are similar without knowing it in advance.</p>
<p>In this example, we want to determine if two degree adverbs (such as <em>very</em>, <em>really</em>, <em>so</em>, <em>completely</em>, <em>totally</em>, <em>amazingly</em>, etc.) are synonymous and can therefore be exchanged without changing the meaning of the sentence (or, at least, not changing it dramatically). This is relevant in lexicography as such terms can then be linked to each other and inform readers that these words are interchangeable.</p>
<p>As a first step, we load the data which contains three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one column holding the degree adverbs which is called <em>pint</em></p></li>
<li><p>one column called <em>adjs</em> holding the adjectives that the degree adverbs have modified</p></li>
<li><p>one column called <em>remove</em> which contains the word <em>keep</em> and which we will remove as it is not relevant for this tutorial</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When loading the data, we</p>
<ul>
<li><p>remove the <em>remove</em> column</p></li>
<li><p>rename the <em>pint</em> column as <em>degree_adverb</em></p></li>
<li><p>rename the <em>adjs</em> column as <em>adjectives</em></p></li>
<li><p>filter out all instances where the degree adverb column has the value <code>0</code> (which means that the adjective was not modified)</p></li>
<li><p>remove instances where <em>well</em> functions as a degree adverb (because it behaves rather differently from other degree adverbs)</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># load data

<p>In a next step, we create a matrix from this data frame which maps how often a given amplifier co-occurred with a given adjective. In text mining, this format is called a text-document matrix or tdm (which is a transposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix">document-term matrix</a> of dtm).</p>

<p>In a next step, we extract the expected values of the co-occurrences if the amplifiers were distributed homogeneously and calculate the <em>Pointwise Mutual Information</em> (PMI) score and use that to then calculate the <em>Positive Pointwise Mutual Information</em> (PPMI) scores. According to <span class="citation">Levshina (<a href="#ref-levshina2015linguistics" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> 327 - referring to <span class="citation">Bullinaria and Levy (<a href="#ref-bullinaria2007extracting" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> - PPMI perform better than PMI as negative values are replaced with zeros.

<p>As we have now obtained a similarity measure, we can go ahead and perform a cluster analysis on these similarity values. However, as we have to extract the maximum values in the similarity matrix that is not 1 as we will use this to create a distance matrix. While we could also have simply subtracted the cosine similarity values from 1 to convert the similarity matrix into a distance matrix, we follow the procedure proposed by <span class="citation">Levshina (<a href="#ref-levshina2015linguistics" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># find max value that is not 1

# create distance matrix

<p>In a next step, we visualize the results of the semantic vector space model as a dendrogram.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create cluster object

<p>The clustering solution shows that, as expected, <em>completely</em>, <em>extremely</em>, and <em>totally</em> - while similar to each other and thus interchangeable with each other - form a separate cluster from all other amplifiers. In addition, <em>real</em> and <em>really</em> form a cluster together. The clustering of <em>pretty</em>, <em>so</em>, <em>really</em>, and <em>real</em> suggest that these amplifiers are more or less interchangeable.</p>
<hr />
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>Remember that this is only a tutorial! A proper study would have to take the syntactic context into account because, while we can say <em>This really great tutorial helped me a lot</em>. we probably would not say <em>This so great tutorial helped me a lot</em>. This is because so syntactically more restricted and is strongly disfavored in attributive contexts. Therefore, the syntactic context would have to be considered in a more thorough study.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are many more useful methods for identifying semantic similarity. A very useful method (which we have implemented here but only superficially is Semantci Vector Space Modelling. If you want to know more about this, this <a href="https://gederajeg.github.io/vector_space_model_indonesian/">tutorial by Gede Primahadi Wijaya Rajeg, Karlina Denistia, and Simon Musgrave</a> <span class="citation">(Rajeg, Denistia, and Musgrave <a href="#ref-rajeg2020semvec" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> is highly recommended and will give a better understanding of SVM but this should suffice to get you started.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Going further: crowd-sourced dictionaries with R and Git</h1>
<p>While it would go beyond the scope of this tutorial, it should be noted that the approach for creating dictionaries can be applied to crowed-sourced dictionaries. To do this, you could, e.g. upload your dictionary to a Git repository such as <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> which would then allow everybody with an account on either of these platforms to add content to the dictionary. To add to the dictionary, contributors would simply have to fork the repository of the dictionary and then merge with the existing, original dictionary repository. The quality of the data would meanwhile remain under control of the owner of the original repository he they can decide on a case-by-case basis which change they would like to accept. In addition, and because Git is a version control environment, the owner could also go back to previous versions, if they think they erroneously accepted a change (merge).</p>

<p>This option is particularly interesting for the approach to creating dictionaries presented here because R Studio has an integrated and very easy to use pipeline to Git (see, e.g., <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN">here</a> and <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html">here</a>)</p>
<p>We have reached the end of this tutorial and you now know how to create and modify networks in R and how you can highlight aspects of your data.</p>
