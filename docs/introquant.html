<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This tutorial takes a philosophical or history-of-ideas approach and
introduces the logical and cognitive underpinnings of the the scientific
method. This tutorial is aimed at beginners and does not require prior
knowledge.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/g_chili.jpg" width="15%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>The aim of this tutorial is to outline why humans are need science
and it demonstrates with various examples, which are not restricted to
linguistics, that humans are prone to cognitive biases, logical
fallacies (e.g. argument ad personam, strawman arguments, post-hoc-ergo
propter hoc, argument from popularity), and inappropriate ways of
dealing with data (cherry-picking) which are likely to lead to
inaccurate conclusions. For example, humans are good (maybe too good) at
seeing patterns but not good at understanding randomness. This is the
basis for seeing faces in random patterns like the famous face on Mars.
The explanation for the human inability to see the world as it is based
on evolutionary approaches to our cognitive apparatus. It will be shown
using the example of Clever Hans (a horse that was thought to be able to
count and perform mathematical operations) that these biases can only be
avoided if one applies a methodological approach to acquiring
knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-do-we-need-science" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Why do we need
science?</h1>
<p>Before delving deeper into questions relating to defining features or
characteristics of science, it is important to understand why we need
science in the first place. Let us start out with a very simple and
preliminary definition of science as <em>a methodological process used
to acquire knowledge about the world based on empirical
evidence</em>.</p>
<p>One could argue that we do not need science as we can understand the
workings of the world around us not by evidence but by meditating. This
is not as trivial as it may sound as this is a valid way of acquiring
knowledge in what is called <em>formal sciences</em> such as logic or
mathematics. Formal sciences start out with axioms and enlarge knowledge
by applying logical operations to statements. Using a logical operation
called <em>inference</em>, we can prove that, given certain statements
(premises) are true, a derived statement (conclusion) follows with
necessity and thus must also be true. For instance, if the statement
<em>Socrates is a human being</em> (premise 1) and the <em>All humans
are mortal</em> (premise 2) are both true, then we can infer that the
statement <em>Socrates is mortal</em> (conclusion) must also be true.
Once a given statement (conclusion) is proven to be true, then this
conclusion can itself be used as a premise to arrive at new true
statements. Formal sciences are extremely powerful when it comes to
determining the logically coherence. In other words, formal sciences can
be used to construct logically coherent representations of the world
around us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this procedure to acquire knowledge does not tell us
whether the statement <em>I will raise my left arm once I have counted
to three</em> or the statement <em>I will raise my right arm once I have
counted to three</em> is true. Both options are equally possible and a
world in which I raise my left arm is just as logically coherent as a
world in which I raised my right arm. As a consequence, we need
empirical evidence to determine whether statement (as a side note: I
only counted to two and raised neither of my arms). The problem here is
that there is potentially an infinite number of possible numbers of
logically coherent worlds and in order to determine which of these
potential worlds is the world we live in (given that our world is
logically coherent which I often doubt). In other words, we need
empirical evidence to determine the workings of the world around us.</p>
<div id="errare-humanum-est" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Errare Humanum Est</h2>
<p>All of the above indicates that we need empirical evidence to
determine the rules and laws governing empirical reality but it does not
tell us why we need science. As we have established above, only
empirical evidence can lead the way to determining what the
characteristics of the world we live in are. Science comes in as we, as
human beings, are not very good at seeing and understanding the world as
it is (in fact, we are not able to do so!). To elaborate, when it comes
things we are scared of, we rather rely on emotional narratives rather
than things that really do us harm. For instance, we are more scared of
what is sometimes referred to as <em>stranger danger</em>, i.e. that
someone unknown will harm us or people dear to us than people we know
while most murders and sexual exploits are committed by people, we know
such as our family and friends. Another example would be represented by
the movie <em>Jaws</em> while mosquitoes or even cows kill more people
(mosquitoes are in fact among the most dangerous animals for humans due
to the diseases they transmit).</p>
<p>Besides being more strongly influenced by emotional narratives there
are other in-build biases such as our drive to stick to opinions rather
than correcting them or switching sides once these are proven incorrect.
In other words, we seek confirmation for our believes rather than
challenging them. For example,</p>

</script>
<p>Another reason why we need science, i.e. a methodological approach to
evaluating evidence, is that we are simply bad with numbers. Take the
famous Monty Hall example:</p>
<p>Monty Hall the host of the TV game show <em>Let’s make a deal</em> in
which every participant was given the choice between three doors -
behind two of them there was a goat while the other door hid a
prize.</p>

<p><br></p>

<tr class="header">

<tr class="odd">
<td>1. Every participant would choose one of three doors.</td>
<td align="center"><img

<tr class="even">
<td>2. After the participant had chosen a door, Monty Hall would show
the participant a goat behind one of the doors not chosen by the
participant.</td>
<td align="center"><img

<tr class="odd">

(to the other door not initially selected).</td>
<td align="center"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, what do you think - should you switch doors at that point or
doesn’t make a difference?</p>
<p>Well, in fact, you should switch doors and it does make a difference
but it is really difficult for us humans to wrap our head around it. So,
the chances of winning the prize actually increase when you switch (you
can check it out yourselves when you go to <a
href="https://www.mathwarehouse.com/monty-hall-simulation-online/">this
website</a> which simulates many scenarios and confirms that after
switching your chance of winning increases to 2 in 3.</p>

from.</th>

doors combined have a 19 out of 20 chance to win.</td>

door.</td>

<p>You would definitely switch as, in this case, as it is more intuitive
for us to see that the chances of winning concentrate on the door that
Monty leaves unopened and which we did not initially select.</p>

<div id="the-birthday-conundrum" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">The Birthday Conundrum</h2>
<p>Another interesting way to show that we are not good with numbers
relates to the so-called <em>Birthday Conundrum</em>. The birthday
conundrum deals with exponential growth and it can best be exemplified
by the following scenario: imagine you are in a class consisting of 23
students.</p>
<hr />
<div class="warning"
style="padding:0.1em; background-color:#51247a; color:#f2f2f2">
<span>
<p style="margin-top:1em; text-align:center">
<b>Think Break!</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em;">
</p>
<p></span></p>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p>`</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How likely is it that 2 students have the same birthday in a class
of 23 students?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>`</p>
<hr />
<p>In a room of just 23 people there’s a 50-50 chance of two people
having the same birthday. The vast majority of people will intuitively
come up with much higher numbers of students that are required to find a
pair of students that have the same birthday. But why is that?</p>
<p>Well, we are quite good with our numeric intuition when it comes to
simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication but we are really bad
when it comes to exponential growth.</p>
<p>Let us go back to our problem: What are the chances that two students
in a class of 23 have their birthday on the same day?</p>
<p>We could list all possible couples and count all the ways they could
fit but that would be really labor-intensive. In fact, it would be the
same as asking <em>What’s the chance to get one or more heads in 23-coin
flips?</em>.</p>
<p>Is there an easier way to solve the coin-flip and the birthday
problem?</p>
<p>Yes, there is. We can turn the problem on its head: instead of
determining the likelihood of each and every path to get heads, we
simply calculate the chance to get only tails (or all separate
birthdays).</p>
<p>If there’s a 1% chance of getting only tails (it is, in fact, <span
class="math inline">\(.5^23\)</span> to be precise but let’s stick with
1 percent for the sake of simplicity here), there’s a 99% chance of
having at least one head. We do not know if it’s only 1 head or 2 or 15
or 23: there is at least once head, and that is what matters here. If we
subtract the probability of the negative of our problem from 1, we get
the probability of the scenario that we are interested in.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to birthdays. Instead of finding all
possibilities, we find the chance that everyone is different (the
<em>negative</em> scenario). We then determine the probability of the
positive and have the chance of at least two people having the same
birthday. It can be 1 pair, or 2 or 20, but at least two people have the
same birthday.</p>
<p>So let’s go over how to calculate the actual probability.</p>
<p>n = 23 days_in_year = 365</p>
<p>The chance of 2 people having different birthdays is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
1 - \frac{365}{365} * \frac{364}{365} * \frac{363}{365} * ... *
\frac{365-23}{365} =  1 - 0.4927028 = 0.5072972
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The chance of getting a single miss, i.e. that two specific people
have the same birthday, is very high (99.7260%), but when that chance is
multiplied given all the possible pairs, the odds of two people having
the same birthday decrease very fast. The probability of two students in
a class of 23 have the same birthday is 0.5072972 (or approximately 50
percent).</p>

<p>A similar point can be made by another example: assume that a ball
and a bat together cost 1.10 AUD. The bat costs 1 AUD more than the
ball. What does the ball cost?</p>
<p>Most students initially think that the ball costs 10 cents but this
is not the correct answer. Do you know why? Well, if the ball costs 10
cents and the bat costs 1 AUD more, then the bat would cost 1.10 AUD and
both together would cost 1.20 AUD and not 1.10 AUD. The correct answer
is of course 5 cents (0.05 AUD + 1.05AUD = 1.10 AUD).</p>
<p>According to the psychologist Daniel Kahnemann, one possible
explanation for this bias is that humans have two different ways of
thinking: fast thinking which is very intuitive and quick and slow
thinking which takes longer and is more deliberate. While fast thinking
is typically a very economical way to decide, slow and deliberate is
more precise but more <em>expensive</em> as it takes more time and
effort. Science is essentially a method to approach problems, that we
would normally use fast thinking to resolve, with slow and deliberate
thought.</p>

<div id="randomness" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Randomness</h2>
<p>A very powerful cognitive bias that underlies superstitious beliefs
or behaviors is that we are very bad at dealing with randomness. In
other words, we are prone to see causes or patterns although there may
be none. An experiment involving pigeon performed by the psychologist B.
F. Skinner. Skinner provided pigeon at random intervals with food
pallets. After a while, Skinner noticed that the pigeon exhibited
unusual behaviors such as twirling around in circles or picking in a
corner. According to Skinner, the behavior that pigeon performed while
receiving food was positively enforced. In other words, a pigeon thought
that when it performed a certain behavior, this would cause food to fall
from the feeder. Something similar can be observed among athletes who
stick to certain behaviors such as not shaving etc. because they didn’t
shave when they last won. The underlying mechanism is that we assign a
causal relationship between some behavior and a certain outcome although
the behavior and the outcome may be completely unrelated.</p>

<p>A similar cognitive bias underlies many ghost sightings. We are prone
to see faces or human figures in random patterns. For example, the
famous picture of a face on Mars or faces on toasts. Similarly, if you
hear leaves turning over at night, it is likely that you think that
someone is following you, as you assign noises rather to agents such as
people rather than natural forces.</p>
<p>Bruce Hood, a psychologist at Cardiff University, offers a very
interesting evolutionary explanation for this phenomenon. To elaborate,
imagine a professor offered you 10 AUD to wear a jumper he brought along
for only a minute or so. Most people would take the offer and earn the
10 AUD. However, the professor adds that the jumper belonged to a brutal
psychopathic serial killer and asks again whether you would wear the
jumper. While some students would still wear the jumper, some students
would not wear it given this information and even students who would,
state that they would feel less comfortable. The underlying mechanism is
that we assume that the jumper is not merely a piece of cloth but that
it has changed somehow and acquired something by having been worn by a
brutal psychopathic serial killer. While this is completely natural, it
is irrational as the jumper is, in fact, merely a piece of cloth. Hood
explains that people often assign value to material things which goes to
say that people treat objects not only as material consisting of atoms
but as things that have something like an essence or a <em>soul</em>.
The underlying mechanism, he hypothesizes, adds an evolutionary
advantage as people who had this belief were less likely to get close to
items or people suffering from diseases and were thus less likely to get
infected. This goes to show that irrational thinking or responses can be
grounded in rational behavior.</p>
<p>In addition to being generally bad with numbers and assuming agents
rather than natural causes, there is another bias, called confirmation
bias, which is an inbuilt hindrance to accurate knowledge. Let’s turn to
another example to illustrate this. This example is called the <em>Wason
Selection Task</em> after Peter Wason who came up with this test.
Imaging you are presented with cards that have letters on one side and
numbers on the other. Four of these cards are placed on a table before
you. Card 1 is an <em>A</em>, card 2 is a <em>K</em>, card 3 is a
<em>2</em>, and the fourth card is a <em>7</em>. You are told that
whenever a vowel is on one side of the card, the other side is an even
number. Which of these four cards do you have to turn over to determine
whether this rule holds true?</p>

<p>What have you guessed? The most common answer is cards 1 and 2 while
the correct answer is actually cards 1 and 4 because the rule does not
say whether there are even or odd numbers behind consonants; thus,
turning over cards 2 and 3 does not help you in determining whether the
rule holds true or not - in fact, cards 2 and 3 are irrelevant for the
problem.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to another example to further illustrate cognitive
bias: Imaging that I have a rule in my mind and write down 3 numbers
which are generated in accordance with my rule. Your task is to find out
what the rule is that I have in mind. To help you finding out about
that, you are allowed to propose a fourth number and I have to answer
whether the proposed number is aligned with my rule or not. After
proposing a number, you may then propose what the rule is and I have to
tell you whether the proposed rule is the rule I had in mind or not. The
numbers I write down are 1, 2 and 4. What do you think is the rule I
have in mind and which number would you propose?</p>

<p>Typically, students first propose 8 (which is in accordance with my
rule) and the rule that is typically proposed first is <em>Double the
previous number</em>. Unfortunately, this is not the rule according to
which I generated the numbers. The next guess is typically 16 (which is
also in accordance with my rule) and students propose the rule
<em>Square the previous number</em> (which is again incorrect). It is
only when students propose numbers that contradict their hypothesized
rule that they get closer to finding the actual rule I have in mind.</p>
<p>Actually, the rule I have in mind is very simple as it is <em>The
current number must always be bigger than the previous number</em>. This
is to show that we intuitively test whether our hypothesized rule is
correct, rather than testing whether it is false. A well-reasoned
proposal would thus be numbers like 3 or 7 which conflict with the
hypothesized rule rather than numbers which comply with it.</p>
<p>This goes to show that we, as humans, aim to support ideas we already
have rather than testing our beliefs. Science, however, does exactly the
opposite: in the scientific process, ideas, hypotheses and theories are
challenged. Support for Ideas or theories comes from failed attempts to
disprove them rather than from findings which support them.</p>
<p>Why have we had a look at these examples and quizzes? Basically, the
intention here was to convince you that we as humans to not necessarily
come to rational conclusions but that there are in-built mechanisms,
which systematically lead us astray and cause us to misjudge phenomena.
It is important to understand that these biases often have a rational
cause but that they are (a) part of human nature and (b) that they are
constantly at work and thus constantly lead us astray. And it is here
where the scientific method comes in as the scientific method is simply
a procedure which prevents us from coming to erroneous conclusions.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-anthropocentric-bias" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">The Anthropocentric Bias</h2>
<p>Another bias that we as humans are rarely aware of is the
anthropological bias. The anthropological bias refers to conceptualizing
the world around us in a way that assumes that the world is just as we
as humans see the world. Another name for this bias is Experiential
Realism. To exemplify what this means, think about what the world would
look like for a bee of we were the size of microbes. Bees see
ultraviolet - a wavelength of light that we, as humans, cannot directly
perceive. This means that the world looks very different for bees. many
flowers have evolved to be seen by bees as they rely on bees to spread
their pollen. For a bee, a summer meadow looks something like the dark
night’s sky does for us: a dark blue background with islands of light
that are the flower what reflect ultraviolet radiation (see below).</p>
<p><img src="introquant_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="960" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Vyvyan Evans and Melanie Green describe the anthropological bias and
its origin as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
However, the parts of this external reality to which we have access are
largely constrained by the ecological niche we have adapted to and the
nature of our embodiment. In other words, language does not directly
reflect the world. Rather, it reflects our unique human construal of the
world: our ‘world view’ as it appears to us through the lens of our
embodiment.

<p>There are other examples which show that our perception of the world
depends on our senses and how they function. have a look at the
experiment below.</p>

<li>Look at the dot between the red and green squares for about 30

<p>The left sand dunes appear greenish while the right sand dunes look
red. This is because the neuronal networks which are responsible for
make use see green have run out of neurotransmitters. As the neurons
cannot fire anymore, we see the sand dunes without red (which makes the
dune appear green) and without green (which makes the dune appear
red).</p>
<p>This example should just draw your attention to the fact that our
perception of the world rests upon our senses and our brain.</p>
<p>Another factor which influences the way we perceive the world has to
do with something that is called <em>Gestalt</em> and has been studied
in subfield of psychology (Gestalt-psychology or Gestalt theory).
Gestalt theory has to do with how we perceive shapes by grouping or
lumping (unrelated) elements together. Consider the Figure below. Do you
see the triangle?</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/triangle.png" width="25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We cannot but see a triangle, although there is no triangle. We
simply fill in the blanks and groups the triangles together so that they
form a <em>Gestalt</em> - a shape. This becomes obvious if we re-arrange
the triangles because, now, you see Pacman!</p>

</div>
<div id="patterns-and-matters-of-habit"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Patterns and Matters of Habit</h2>
<p>Related to but different from the phenomena with Gestalt theory is
another interesting way in which our mind manipulates the input to our
senses. Have a look at the upside-down faces of Margaret Thatcher below.
Does one face strike you as odd?</p>
<p><img src="introquant_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Probably the picture of Margaret Thatcher on the right strikes you as
somewhat odd but have a look at what happens if we turn the pictures
around.</p>
<p><img src="introquant_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Most people are somewhat shocked how distorted the picture on the
right really is. This is because our brain compensates the skewness of
the Margaret Thatcher’s face in the right picture while it does not
<em>normalize</em> the picture when shown in the way that we normally
see people. The interesting point is that our brain automatically
adjusts the picture of a face based on out previous experience with
faces. One could say that our perception - especially of human faces,
autocorrects aspects of our visual input based on patterns and
expectations build from previous input.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/face.png" width="35%" style="float:right; padding:15px" /></p>
<p>The autocorrection effect also plays on another bias which has to do
with face recognition. Because reading and interpreting faces is and has
been so important and informative for us, we are prone not only to see
or find patterns in randomness but more specifically we are prone to
seeing faces or constructing faces from ambiguous input. To see what I
mean, have a look at the picture below.</p>
<p>Although the picture does not show a face, we interpret the various
elements in the picture to form - in combination - a face. Of course,
the face is not emerging from a merely chaotic assemblies of elements
but the elements in the picture are arranged to create that effect. And
although the arrangement is deliberate in the picture above, it still
goes to show that humans are particularly available for suggestive,
ambiguous input to be interpreted as human faces. One reason for this is
that the context, here understood as the combinatorial effect of various
unrelated elements, influences our perception and interpretation of
visual input.</p>
<p>Let me clarify this with another example. What symbol do you see in
the red circle?</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/abc.png" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Given that context, with the letters <em>A</em> and <em>C</em> to the
left and right of the symbol, the most natural interpretation of the
symbol is, of course, a <em>B</em>. However, if the context changes (as
you can see below), the interpretation changes with it although the
symbol and all its features remain the same.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/abc2.png" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This goes to show that our perception and interpretation of the world
around us is not solely based on the input or the element itself but
rather that categorization is context-dependent.</p>

class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Locical Fallacies and Biases</h2>
<p>In this section, we will have a look at things we do or ways we argue
that will prevent us from finding out what is really going on. These
<em>logical fallacies</em> are very common and noone is exempt from them
- we should however, be aware of them and aim to avoid them if we do not
want to arrive at wrong conclusions or make erroneous judgments.</p>
<p>Logical fallacies can be defines as flawed, deceptive, or false
arguments that can be proven wrong with reasoning and we will briefly
inspect some of the the most common logical fallacies below.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation Bias and Cherry Picking</strong></p>
<p>As creatures of habit, we focus on certain things while we ignore
others. This is quite helpful to orient ourselves in a highly complex
world but it is unfortunately quite detrimental to the scientific
endeavor. This is particularly so as we tend to ignore things or ideas
that do not match our expectations. This is called <em>confirmation
bias</em> or <em>cherry picking</em> and it is very common - even in
science. In order to avoid this logical fallacy, rather than finding
evidence that supports our assumptions and views, we need to actively
look for evidence that shows that our assumptions are wrong. But while
this is the better methodological approach towards finding real answers,
it goes against how we intuitively operate. Unfortunately, seeking to
confirm one’s view is not only human but leads to deeply misguided
conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Hominem</strong></p>
<p>An <em>ad hominem</em> is when, instead of providing a (factual)
counterargument or pointing out problems or inconsistencies in an
argument, the person bringing forward the argument is attached - often
using slurs such as <em>racist</em>, <em>lefty</em>, <em>Nazi</em>, or
the like. As such, the <em>ad hominem</em> fallacy represents the
tendency to use personal attacks rather than logic to counter an
argument. <em>Ad hominem</em> are also sometimes referred to as
<em>mudslinging</em> in public discourse and they are manipulative in
that they guide the attention away form the arguments to the personal
and emotional level without addressing core issues.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal to Authority</strong></p>
<p>An <em>appeal to authority</em> is a fallacy when someone refers to
an authoritative figure as a justification or in support of an argument
rather than explaining what this person has argued, found out, or
stated. However, this fallacy is tricky because an authority’s stance
can represent evidence, but it becomes a fallacy if the person rather
than what they showed is used as a justification. An authority should
only be referred to as a stand-in for research or a study which that
person represents or has conducted - the person itself is typically
irrelevant to the topic or the argument.</p>
<p>An example of this fallacy would be if someone said <em>X has said
that Y is the case</em> and assumes that Y is true because the
authority, X, has said so. Instead, the study or research conducted by X
is the cause for Y being likely true, rather than X merely saying
so.</p>
<p><strong>Straw Man</strong></p>
<p>The <em>straw man</em> fallacy occurs when the position of someone is
misportrayed so that it is easier to argue against it and show it to be
a flawed stance. The purpose of this fallacy is to make one’s own
position appear superior or stronger than it actually is.</p>
<p>The straw man fallacy derives its name from actual harmless, lifeless
straw men - a scarecrow - because, instead of arguing against the
position an opponent is actually holding, an easily defeated puppet
version of the opponent’s position is attacked that the opponent was
never arguing for in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Argument from Ignorance</strong></p>
<p>The argument from ignorance occurs when it is argues that a
proposition must be true because it has not been proven to be false or
if there is no evidence against it. An example of the <em>argument from
ignorance</em> would be if someone posed <em>No one has ever been able
to prove that extraterrestrials exist, so they must not be real</em> or
<em>Noone knows how the world came into being, therefore God must be the
cause</em>. An appeal to ignorance doesn’t prove anything and only
shifts the burden for proof away from the person making a claim.</p>
<p><strong>False Dichotomy</strong></p>
<p>A false dilemma or false dichotomy presents limited options —
typically by focusing on two extremes — when in fact more possibilities
exist. The phrase “America: Love it or leave it” is an example of a
false dilemma.</p>
<p>The false dilemma fallacy is a manipulative tool designed to polarize
the audience, promoting one side and demonizing another. It’s common in
political discourse as a way of strong-arming the public into supporting
controversial legislation or policies.</p>
<p><strong>Slippery Slope</strong></p>
<p>A slippery slope argument assumes that a certain course of action
will necessarily lead to a chain of future events. The slippery slope
fallacy takes a benign premise or starting point and suggests that it
will lead to unlikely or ridiculous outcomes with no supporting
evidence.</p>
<p>You may have used this fallacy on your parents as a teenager: “But
you have to let me go to the party! If I don’t go to the party, I’ll be
a loser with no friends. Next thing you know, I’ll end up alone and
jobless, living in your basement when I’m 30!”</p>
<p><strong>Circular Argument</strong></p>
<p>Circular arguments occur when a person’s argument repeats what they
already assumed before without arriving at a new conclusion. For
example, if someone says, “According to my brain, my brain is reliable,”
that’s a circular argument.</p>
<p>Circular arguments often use a claim as both a premise and a
conclusion. This fallacy only appears to be an argument when in fact
it’s just restating one’s assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Red Herring</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to fallacies, a <em>red herring</em> is an argument
that uses confusion or distraction to shift attention away from a topic
and toward a false conclusion. <em>Red herrings</em> usually contain an
unimportant fact, idea, or event that has little relevance to the real
issue. Red herrings are a very common and they are used when someone
wants to shift the focus away from a topic or an argument to something
that is easier or safer to address. As such, <em>red herrings</em> are
related to shifting from rational to emotional - similar to <em>ad
hominem</em> attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Sunk Cost</strong></p>
<p>The so-called <em>sunk cost fallacy</em> occurs when someone
continues doing something because of the effort they have already put in
- regardless of whether the additional costs outweigh the potential
benefits. <em>Sunk cost</em> is a term borrowed from economy where it
refers to expenses that can no longer be recovered. An example would be
if you continue watching a TV show only because you have already watched
some episodes although you are actually not enjoying watching the show -
you just to go through with it so the initial costs of watching the TV
shows was not “in vein”.</p>
<p>Falling pray to cognitive biases or logical fallacies means that we
are constantly deceiving ourselves and therefore need to protect
ourselves from our own wrong judgments. To protect ourselves from these
natural (systematic) delusions that have been discussed so far, we have
developed <em>skeptical or critical thinking skills</em>. Among these
skills, the <em>hypothetic-deductive method of science</em> is known as
the <em>scientific method </em>. However, these skills are not just
there - they have to be learned and trained! Such skeptical skills form
the basis of science because science, in its essence, is the search for
answers about how the world really works. And in order to avoid being
led astray, we have to safeguard us from our own biases by following a
methodological and careful approach. The next section will focus on the
relationship between science and why it must be methodological.</p>

Experiences of ghosts (or what people experience as ghosts) can be

</ol>
<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>
When aiming to answer how one factor (e.g., smoking) affects another
factor (e.g., developing cancer), we are typically interested in general
patterns or trends rather than unusual or unrepresentative cases. As
such, individual anecdotes are not useful to answer questions asking for
the relationship between factors, because we do not know how common or
prototypical the anecdotal case is. Even many anecdotes do not qualify
as data as anecdotes are likely biased and not representative. To
determine the relationship between factors, we would need systematic and
unbiased observation .

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> What is science?</h1>
<p>This chapter elaborates further on basic concepts of science but
focuses less on the philosophical underpinning and more strictly on the
craftsmanship aspect. Thus, it introduces basic concepts science
(e.g. empirical versus pure science, falsification, inter-subjectivity,
internal and external validity) and the scientific method.</p>
<div id="clever-hans" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Clever Hans</h2>
<p>So, what is science? Well, let’s start with the example of <em>Clever
Hans</em> to illustrate how science is applied to phenomena.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans"><em>Clever
Hans</em></a> was horse who responded to questions requiring
mathematical calculations by tapping his hoof. If asked by his master,
William Von Osten, what is the sum of 3 plus 2, the horse would tap his
hoof five times. It appeared the animal was responding to human language
and was capable of grasping mathematical concepts. It was 1891 when Hans
became public but only in 1904 it was discovered by Oskar Pfungst that
the horse was responding to subtle physical cues. Yet, more than a dozen
scientists observed Hans and were convinced there was no signaling or
trickery. But the scientists were wrong.</p>
<p>Pfungst noted that when the correct answer was not known to anyone
present, Clever Hans didn’t know it either. And when the horse couldn’t
see the person who did know the answer, the horse didn’t respond
correctly. This led Pfungst to conclude that the horse was getting
visual cues, albeit subtle ones. It turned out that Von Osten and others
were cuing Hans unconsciously by <em>tensing their muscles until Hans
produced</em> the correct answer. The horse truly was clever, not
because he understood human language but because he could perceive very
subtle muscle movements.</p>
<p>The fact that it took a methodological and very careful approach to
find out why the hoarse appeared to be able to do math is very telling.
So, we use science because it effectively protects us from being
deceived by others (which would be bad) and, more importantly, by
ourselves (which is much worse). The consistent application of the
scientific method not only brings insight into how the world really
works but it allows us to find ways in which the world around us can
then be used to our advantage (fire, wheel, agriculture, magnetism,
steam engine, telephone, microwave, nuclear fusion, etc.),</p>
<p>So, what is science?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science is an unbiased, fundamentally methodological enterprise that
aims at building and organizing knowledge about the empirical world in
the form of falsifiable explanations and predictions by means of
observation and experimentation. (MS)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Science is the effort to understand how the universe works through
the scientific method, with observable evidence as the basis of that
understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/scientificcircle.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Which varieties of science are there?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Empirical Science(s)</strong> examine phenomena of
reality through the scientific method (cf.), with the aim of explaining
and / or predicting them (for example, functional linguistics, biology,
astronomy, sociology, …).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formal Science(s)</strong> examine systems of abstract
constructs using axiomatically set or derived rules (for example,
mathematics, formal logic, theoretical computer science, system theory,
chaos theory, formal linguistics, …).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="popper-falsification-and-scientific-progress"

<h2 class="unnumbered">Popper, falsification, and scientific
progress</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/popper.jpg" width="30%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Sir Karl Raimund Popper was a Austrian-British academic and public
figure who vigorously defended liberal democracy and the principles of
social criticism that he believed made a flourishing open society
possible. In the context of scientific thinking, Popper is important
because he is arguably the most important philosopher of science -
probably best known for his realization that nothing can be proven in
the empirical sciences, but that hypotheses can and need to be
falsified. This means that in contrast to the formal sciences, where
statements can be proven once certain axioms are accepted, any knowledge
that is produced by the empirical sciences is always, and has to be
preliminary which implies that the empirical sciences represent an
ongoing process.</p>
<br>
<div class="warning"
style="padding:0.1em; background-color:#f2f2f2; color:#51247a">
<span>
<p style="margin-top:1em; text-align:center">
What does this mean and why can empirical sciences not prove?<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em;">
</p>
<p></span></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Well, logically speaking, no number of observations of something can
confirm a scientific theory. However, a single counterexample can be
enough to show that a theory is false. Imagine someone states that all
swans are white, any number of white swans cannot prove that that
statement is correct, but a single black swan immediately falsifies the
statement.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that to say that something is
<em>falsifiable</em> does not mean that it is false or wrong or fake: it
simply means that it can, in principle, be shown to be false by
observation or by experiment.</p>
<p>According to Popper, falsifiability is the defining criterion of what
is and what is not science: a theory can only be considered scientific
if, and only if, it is falsifiable. This led him to refute claims that
both psychoanalysis and Marxism are scientific because these theories
are not falsifiable.</p>
<p>There is an apparent progress of scientific knowledge, meaning that
our understanding of the universe appears to be improving over time. In
Popper’s view, this advance of scientific knowledge is an evolutionary
process: competing theories are systematically subjected to attempts at
falsification which leads to error elimination - so that falsification
performs similar function for science that natural selection performs
for biological evolution. Theories that better survive the process of
refutation are not more true, but rather, more <em>fit</em>.
Consequently, just as a species’ biological fitness does not ensure
continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific
theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine
of biological evolution has, over many generations, produced adaptive
traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival,
likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may
progress. For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative
theories (conjectures) and error elimination (refutation) that
scientific knowledge advances - in a process very much akin to the
interplay between genetic variation and natural selection.</p>

<div id="what-is-empirical-linguistics"

<h2 class="unnumbered">What is (empirical) Linguistics?</h2>
<p>Linguistics is commonly defined as the <em>the scientific study of
language or individual languages</em> and linguists try to uncover the
systems behind language, to describe these systems, and to theoretically
explain and model them <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-evans2006cognitive">Evans and Green 2006</a>)</span>.
Linguistics who work empirically conduct research on linguistic
phenomena based on observations of reality. As such, (empirical)

<p>In empirical research typically follows the scheme described below.
This scheme is also referred to as the <em>scientific circle</em> and we
will use the example of having lost your keys to exemplify how it
works.</p>
<p>So, let’s imagine you lost your key: in a first step we make an
observation (keys are not here). In a second step, we ask ourselves
where the keys may be (research question). In a third step, we come up
with an idea where the keys may be (hypothesis). Then, we think about
where we have lost the keys before (literature review). Next, we look
for the keys where we expect them to be (empirical testing), then, we
evaluate the result of the test (was hypothesis correct), and finally,
we either have found the keys (hypothesis was correct) or not (keys are
still missing) which causes us to come up with another idea and we need
to go through the same steps again.</p>
<p>A slightly more elaborate depiction of this scenario with the
equivalent steps in the scientific circle is listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an observation (e.g., <em>My keys are gone!</em>)</li>
<li>Formulate a research question (e.g., <em>Where are my
keys?</em>)</li>
<li>Deduce a test hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) based on observation
(e.g. <em>My keys are on the table next to the TV!</em>)</li>
<li>Formulate null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) (e.g., <em>My keys are not
on the table next to the TV!</em>)</li>
<li>Determining the level of significance at which the H<sub>0</sub> is
rejected</li>
<li>Formulate potential results: what results are possible and what do
they mean for the H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>1</sub>? (<em>My keys are not
on the table next to the TV!</em>: H<sub>0</sub> cannot be rejected,
formulate new H<sub>1</sub>)</li>
<li>Design experiment/study/research (e.g., <em>I will go over to the TV
and see if my keys on the table next to the TV.</em>)</li>
<li>Conduct experiment/study/research (e.g., <em>Actually go over to the
TV and see if my keys on the table next to the TV.</em>)</li>
<li>Statistical analysis</li>
<li>Interpretation of the results (e.g., <em>My keys are not on the
table next to the TV so I must have lost them elsewhere!</em>)</li>
<li>In case H<sub>0</sub> could not be rejected: Formulate new
H<sub>1</sub>. (e.g., <em>My keys are on the kitchen table!</em>)</li>
