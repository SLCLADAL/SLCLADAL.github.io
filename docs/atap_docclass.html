</div>


<div id="introduction" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This tutorial shows how to perform document classification using R.
The entire R markdown document for the tutorial can be downloaded <a
href="%22https://slcladal.github.io/content/atap_docclass.Rmd%22">here</a>.</p>
<p>The tutorial requires you to install and load several packages to
analyze linguistic data. To help you, we directly include the commands
to do so in the script and walk you through it step by step. Let’s get
on it!</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Motivation</h1>
<p>Document classification is a useful method of computational
linguistics since it provides an effective way of handling large
quantities of text. Think for a moment about spam mails. According to an
analysis – or self-promotion, if you will – by the anti-virus company
Kaspersky, more than half of the global email traffic is spam mail <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vergelis2019spam"
role="doc-biblioref">Vergelis et al. 2019</a>)</span> (<a
href="https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-q1-2019/90795/">see
here</a>) . How do email providers manage to sift these quantities of
data? They use document classification to separate the important email
traffic from spam mail.</p>
<p>Emails are obviously a rather specific category of text, with one
distinguishing feature: either you want them in your inbox, or you
don’t. Of course, one person’s spam may be the other person’s key to
retrieving a lost fortune, but for all intents and purposes, the global
mail traffic is binary:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>you don’t want it = spam</p></li>
<li><p>you want it = mails</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For binary classes of text such as this, document classification
comes in really handy. We will point to sources that address how
document classification can be used in contexts with more than two
categories, but in this tutorial we eschew such complexity.. To further
preserve our collective wellbeing, we now turn our backs on spam
mail.</p>
</div>
<div id="american-speeches" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> American Speeches</h1>
<p>Instead, we dive into another category of text that is notoriously
binary: American presidential speeches. Although all candidates claim to
peddle policies, what they are giving us instead are words (at least
during the campaign trails). And by throwing these words into the meat
grinder of document classification, we can identify which linguistic
features are typical of which party, and, in a slightly more extensive
analysis, we could tell the party hard-liners from the mavericks - but
for now, we’ll stick with the binary categories and with linguistic
features.</p>
<p>To use the jargon of computational linguistics: we are using
supervised document classification for political profiling. Political
profiling should not require further explanation, but the document
classification we are getting to in a minute is considered supervised
because the corpus has been constructed to include only two categories
on the basis of pre-existing knowledge.</p>
<p>We extend our thanks to Marco Guerini and his co-authors for the
construction of the CORPS II corpus, which contains 8 million words from
3618 speeches by American presidential candidates <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-guerini2010new"
role="doc-biblioref">Guerini et al. 2010</a>)</span>. This CORPS II
serves as our input. On the other end, our output will contain both a
model that can predict a speaker’s party affiliation with a pleasingly
high degree of accuracy and a list of keywords containing the linguistic
features most typical for Republican candidates - and by extension, also
those words least typical for Republicans, which in this beautifully
binary political system means the words most typical of Democratic
candidates.</p>
<div id="preparation-and-session-setup" class="section level2"
number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Preparation and
Session Setup</h2>
<p>As mentioned at the outset, this is an introduction to document
classification based on R. A rudimentary familiarity with R and RStudio
are helpful for getting the most out of this. If you have yet to install
R or are new to it, we can recommend <a
href="https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html">this tutorial to R</a>,
which walks you through the installation and shows a range of its
functionalities. In the following, we assume that you have downloaded
and installed both R and RStudio and take it from there.</p>
<p>Although R in its basic version already contains a lot of
functionalities, we do need to install some packages for the code below
to run without exploding into a bouquet of error messages. If you
already have the packages <code>quanteda</code>,
<code>quanteda.textmodels</code>, <code>stopwords</code> and
<code>ggplot2</code> installed, just skip to the next heading. If you
don’t have them yet, the first thing you want to do is run these first
lines of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(&quot;quanteda&quot;)
#install.packages(&quot;quanteda.textmodels&quot;)
#install.packages(&quot;stopwords&quot;)
#install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This may take a minute or three. In most cases, this will work
without any hiccups. If you should get an error message, we recommend
taking a moment to read what it says, and, if it does not make any sense
to you, to google it. If an issue comes up for you, chances are that
this has already happened to someone else - and, fortunately, the R
community has a pretty good track record of responding to questions
about technical issues. Generally, it is also a good idea to use a
relatively new version of R. If you have last used R two years ago, do
update it.</p>
<p>Once you have installed the packages, you’ll need to load them in the
current session. This is done with the following lines of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(quanteda)
library(quanteda.textmodels)
library(stopwords)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>With the packages loaded, the stage is set. Now we need to dress up
the actors.</p>
</div>
<div id="from-data-to-useable-objects" class="section level2"
number="3.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> From Data to Useable
Objects</h2>
<p>Before we can do anything further, we need to load the data into R.
As mentioned earlier, we are working with the CORPS II corpus compiled
by <span class="citation">Guerini et al. (<a href="#ref-guerini2010new"
role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. There are many ways to get the
corpus into R, but we are going to download the data from the data
directory of the LADAL GitHub repository. By executing the following
line of code, you tell R to download the file containing the corpus from
github and storing it in the session under the variable name
<code>rt</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rt &lt;- base::readRDS(url(&quot;https://slcladal.github.io/data/SEL_perparty_v2.rda&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>In the meantime, we want to draw your attention to the second
parameter of the readtext command, namely the specification defining the
text field. These specifications are called flags. These are often
useful and sometimes necessary. In this case, the flag does exactly what
it says: it tells R in which column the text is stored.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at <code>rt</code>, the variable in which we stored
the corpus. We can do this simply by <code>str</code> which returns the
structure of the object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(rt)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Classes &#39;readtext&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3247 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ doc_id: chr  &quot;SEL_perparty_v2.csv.1&quot; &quot;SEL_perparty_v2.csv.2&quot; &quot;SEL_perparty_v2.csv.3&quot; &quot;SEL_perparty_v2.csv.4&quot; ...
##  $ text  : chr  &quot;We who are Christians usually think about Christ in terms of obligations of charity , and faith in God , and so&quot;| __truncated__ &quot;It is a very great honor and pleasure for me to be here and participate in a dinner this evening that aims at s&quot;| __truncated__ &quot;Thank you . Praise God . Thank you very much . Tonight , I would like you first of all to join me in rememberin&quot;| __truncated__ &quot;Thank you . Thank you . Praise God . Thank you very much . I want to tell you I &#39;m very happy to have a few mom&quot;| __truncated__ ...
##  $ party : chr  &quot;rep&quot; &quot;rep&quot; &quot;rep&quot; &quot;rep&quot; ...
##  $ fileid: chr  &quot;akeyes-95&quot; &quot;akeyes-98&quot; &quot;akeyes1-2-00&quot; &quot;akeyes1-6-96&quot; ...
##  $ name  : chr  &quot;Alan_Keyes&quot; &quot;Alan_Keyes&quot; &quot;Alan_Keyes&quot; &quot;Alan_Keyes&quot; ...</code></pre>
<p>The output tells us what we are dealing with: a object consisting of
3247 documents and 3 document variables. We also see the first six rows
of the object, which shows that we are dealing with a two dimensional
matrix or a table, which in the R context is also called a data frame.
What may be surprising is that, although the object is described as
having three document variables, the data frame has five columns.</p>
<p>If we look at the structure of the corpus, we can see that the file
contains four columns, labeled <code>party</code>, <code>fileid</code>,
<code>name</code> and <code>text</code>, respectively. The object
<code>rt</code> to which we assigned the data created an additional
column, labeled <code>doc_id</code>. In this variable, the row number of
each row in the file is stored. If we were to load in a second document
and append it to the <code>rt</code> object, it would be clear which row
of data comes from which corpus. So, while it’s great to have this
<code>doc_id</code>, the output also makes it clear that it is not
meaningful information relevant to the text we are interested in.</p>
<p>The text source files come from the textual component of the files,
and the document-level metadata (“docvars”) come from either the file
contents or filenames.</p>
<p>So the three document variables are the document-level metadata,
which pertain to the texts we are interested in. Depending on the type
of analysis or operation you are interested in performing on the data,
this is not essential information. For document classification, however,
as well as many other analyses, this metadata is essential.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="from-text-to-corpus" class="section level1" number="4">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> From Text to
Corpus</h1>
<p>Before we can proceed to the document classification, we need to
process the data some more. As a first step, we turn the data frame
<code>rt</code> into a corpus object. We can do this with one intuitive
command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fulltext = corpus(rt)</code></pre>
<p>Thereby, we create a new corpus object called <code>fulltext</code>.
Let’s take a look at it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fulltext</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Corpus consisting of 3,247 documents and 3 docvars.
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.1 :
## &quot;We who are Christians usually think about Christ in terms of...&quot;
## 
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.2 :
## &quot;It is a very great honor and pleasure for me to be here and ...&quot;
## 
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.3 :
## &quot;Thank you . Praise God . Thank you very much . Tonight , I w...&quot;
## 
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.4 :
## &quot;Thank you . Thank you . Praise God . Thank you very much . I...&quot;
## 
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.5 :
## &quot;Thank you very much , God bless you . Unaccustomed as I am t...&quot;
## 
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.6 :
## &quot;Thank you very much . You all make me feel so good with that...&quot;
## 
## [ reached max_ndoc ... 3,241 more documents ]</code></pre>
<p>The output here contains the first six entries of the corpus, which
are now only the text fields, the actual speeches. The metadata is not
lost, however, as the first line of the output shows - telling us that
the corpus consost of 3,247 documents and 3 document variables. This is
precisely as it should be.</p>
<p>If you’re somewhat familiar with R, you may have noticed something
slightly off-putting. Usually, when you enter a variable name, the
output shows the whole variable. In this case, we only got the first six
entries. This is one of the benefits of the corpus object: since corpora
are often voluminous and take a surprising amount of computational power
to be displayed in the console, there is a safety mechanism built into
the corpus object. To prevent an accidental system overload, only the
head of the object is displayed.</p>
<p>With this, we have entered the domain of object-oriented programming.
We are not going to discuss this at length, but want to briefly
introduce the term and the idea behind it. Object-oriented programming
is based on the concept of <code>objects</code>, which have considerable
internal complexity, and can contain both data and code. As far as the
data goes, this is not surprising: we have something like a data frame
or a vector that contains variables. This exists in most programming
paradigms. What is different in object-oriented programming is the code,
which is often called method or behavior. The behavior we encountered
just now is that of only displaying the first six entries of the object,
and only showing the text fields, which contain the data of interest in
corpus objects. This is also where we turn our attention next.</p>
</div>
<div id="pre-processing" class="section level1" number="5">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Pre-Processing</h1>
<p>Let’s look again at the output that we got looking at the corpus
object <code>fulltext</code>. We see several features there which pose a
hindrance to solid document classification. For instance, there is
punctuation which will have to go. Similarly, the capital letters, both
in the beginning of sentences and in words like <em>Christians</em> will
have to be - for lack of a better word - exorcized. The point of
removing these and other features is to reduce the variation in the
language to such a degree that we can process the texts well
statistically, while leaving as much of the semantic content as possible
intact. With this in mind, there are several steps which are necessary
in terms of pre-processing, and we will take these one at a time.</p>
<div id="tokenization" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Tokenization</h2>
<p>The first step here is to transform the text in the corpus object
into individual tokens. Right now, each text cell in the
<code>fulltext</code> object contains one whole presidential campaign
speech. By tokenizing the corpus, each text entry in fulltext is
transformed into a list of words. In order to do this, we define a new
variable, <code>toks</code>, and use the perfectly descriptive command
<code>tokens()</code> to tokenize the corpus and assign it to the new
variable <code>toks</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks &lt;- tokens(fulltext, remove_punct = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Sneakily, we also use a flag here to remove punctuation. Let’s look
at how this step changed the content of the corpus. Having removed the
punctuation, it makes sense to pick a speech which contained punctuation
in the beginning, so we choose speech four. We can look at this specific
speech by entering the name of the object, <code>toks</code>, and adding
the row number of choice in square brackets, thus:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks[4]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Tokens consisting of 1 document and 3 docvars.
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.4 :
##  [1] &quot;Thank&quot;  &quot;you&quot;    &quot;Thank&quot;  &quot;you&quot;    &quot;Praise&quot; &quot;God&quot;    &quot;Thank&quot;  &quot;you&quot;   
##  [9] &quot;very&quot;   &quot;much&quot;   &quot;I&quot;      &quot;want&quot;  
## [ ... and 2,530 more ]</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="lowercasing" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Lowercasing</h2>
<p>This next step is fairly obvious: the heading says it, the command
says it, and it’s precisely what we are going to do. We’re going to
replace all capital letters by their lowercase equivalent in the corpus.
This is mainly to reduce the variation that arises from words that stand
at the beginning of a sentence. To do it, we use the command
<code>tokens_tolower()</code>, as demonstrated here:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks = tokens_tolower(toks)</code></pre>
<p>The command is self explanatory, but we should add: we define the
object <code>toks</code> as input, replace capital letters with
lowercase ones and assign the outcome again to the object
<code>toks</code>, thus overwriting what was there before. If we now
look at row four again, we see the result of this transformation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks[4]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Tokens consisting of 1 document and 3 docvars.
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.4 :
##  [1] &quot;thank&quot;  &quot;you&quot;    &quot;thank&quot;  &quot;you&quot;    &quot;praise&quot; &quot;god&quot;    &quot;thank&quot;  &quot;you&quot;   
##  [9] &quot;very&quot;   &quot;much&quot;   &quot;i&quot;      &quot;want&quot;  
## [ ... and 2,530 more ]</code></pre>
<p>Where before there was <em>Thank</em> and <em>I</em>, we now have
<em>thank</em> and <em>i</em>. Not much more to see here, so let’s keep
moving.</p>
</div>
<div id="stemming" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Stemming</h2>
<p>This time round, the transformation is a bit more drastic: we are
going to reduce each word in the corpus to its word stem. Take a quick
look at the first item of the toks object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks[1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Tokens consisting of 1 document and 3 docvars.
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.1 :
##  [1] &quot;we&quot;          &quot;who&quot;         &quot;are&quot;         &quot;christians&quot;  &quot;usually&quot;    
##  [6] &quot;think&quot;       &quot;about&quot;       &quot;christ&quot;      &quot;in&quot;          &quot;terms&quot;      
## [11] &quot;of&quot;          &quot;obligations&quot;
## [ ... and 6,212 more ]</code></pre>
<p>We have here, among other words, <em>christians</em>,
<em>usually</em> and <em>obligations</em>. Keep those in mind as you
reduce the corpus to wordstems, again using a fairly intuitive
command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks = tokens_wordstem(toks)</code></pre>
<p>Using the same procedure as with lowercasing, we overwrite the
contents of the <code>toks</code> object with its latest transformation.
We can see how this plays out by again looking at the first item.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks[1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Tokens consisting of 1 document and 3 docvars.
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.1 :
##  [1] &quot;we&quot;        &quot;who&quot;       &quot;are&quot;       &quot;christian&quot; &quot;usual&quot;     &quot;think&quot;    
##  [7] &quot;about&quot;     &quot;christ&quot;    &quot;in&quot;        &quot;term&quot;      &quot;of&quot;        &quot;oblig&quot;    
## [ ... and 6,212 more ]</code></pre>
<p>Everything is shortened compared to before: <em>christian</em>,
<em>usually</em>, and <em>oblig</em>. Compared to the preceding steps, a
bit more informational value is lost, but this is often a trade-off
worth taking, seeing as it typically enhances the performance of the
document classification quite substantially.</p>
</div>
<div id="remove-stopwords" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Remove Stopwords</h2>
<p>The final intrusion into the linguistic source material is the
removal of stopwords. These are words which are very common, to a degree
that one can assume that they will, on average, be equally distributed
between the two classes. They are typically also words that have no
meaning on their own, for example <em>the</em>, <em>in</em>, etc. As
they rather regulate the relations between words, they are also called
function words (as opposed to content words, which we want to keep).
There is no universal list of stopwords - and some methods make do
without removing stopwords - but for our purposes, it makes sense to
just work with a list that is readily available, which is the one
specified in the flag. The command is as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks = tokens_remove(toks, pattern = stopwords::stopwords(language = &quot;en&quot;, source = &quot;snowball&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Again, the command is very explicit in its function, the input is the
tokenized, punctuation-less, lowercased and stemmed version of the toks
object, which we overwrite to create a version that is all of the above
and additionally does not contain stopwords. We see in row one how that
looks:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>toks[1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Tokens consisting of 1 document and 3 docvars.
## SEL_perparty_v2.csv.1 :
##  [1] &quot;christian&quot; &quot;usual&quot;     &quot;think&quot;     &quot;christ&quot;    &quot;term&quot;      &quot;oblig&quot;    
##  [7] &quot;chariti&quot;   &quot;faith&quot;     &quot;god&quot;       &quot;forth&quot;     &quot;don&quot;       &quot;t&quot;        
## [ ... and 2,751 more ]</code></pre>
<p>This looks quite a bit different: a lot of words are gone, such as
<em>we</em>, <em>who</em> and <em>are</em>. For the most part, what
remains are the stems of nouns and verbs, words which carry semantic
meaning.</p>
</div>
<div id="imperfections" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Imperfections</h2>
<p>Clearly, this approach to pre-processing is not without flaws. We
still see, for instance, in the last two positions of the output, that
<em>don’t</em> was split into two tokens, <em>don</em> and <em>t</em>.
<em>Don</em> would probably also appear as the appropriate word for
various garments a lot in a Victorian fashion weekly, which is probably
not what Alan Keyes was referring to in his presidential campaign
speech, while <em>not</em> should probably be part of the stopword list.
Or, to return to the purged stopwards mentioned above, <em>who</em>
could have been accidentally removed: once the World Health
Organization’s abbreviation is lowercased, it is indistinguishable from
the pronoun. So you can see that there are some pitfalls to
pre-processing, which are usually quite harmless compared to the
benefits (and improved model). However, it can lead to problematic
omissions in certain contexts. Ultimately, you need to be aware of the
linguistic context you’re working in and make the trade-off on whether
finer-grained pre-processing is worth the effort.</p>

<div id="document-feature-matrix" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Document-Feature
Matrix</h2>
<p>With the linguistic pre-processing done, we continue to the next
step: creating a document-feature matrix – simply a table which says how
often which word occurs in each document. This is the format we need to
run the document classification. We’ll get into its structure in a
second. But first, we turn the pre-processed corpus into a
document-feature matrix. Once more, the command, <code>dfm</code>, is
fairly self-explanatory:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm &lt;- dfm(toks)</code></pre>
<p>This time round, we create a new object with the name
<code>dtm</code>, and the input to this operation is the latest version
of the <code>toks</code> object. In case you are not familiar with this
particular type of matrix, you might get a better sense for what we are
dealing with is by looking at the object directly:</p>

<p>At first glance, you can see that our variable <code>dtm</code> is an
object similar to the earlier <code>fulltext</code>, in that only the
first six rows of the matrix are pasted in the output, and that there is
a summary of the object. And now we can also see the structure of this
document-feature matrix. Turns out, the name is quite the give-away: the
document feature matrix allows us to see how often each feature appears
in each document.</p>
<p>In this matrix, we can access both the columns and the rows, the way
we usually do with data frames in R. To do this, we append a square
bracket to the object. We can access rows thusly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm[3,]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Document-feature matrix of: 1 document, 32,073 features (98.61% sparse) and 3 docvars.

## [ reached max_nfeat ... 32,063 more features ]</code></pre>
<p>Here, we see that <em>think</em> features twelve times in the third
speech in the corpus. Or, accounting for what the pre-processing did to
the text, we can say that some version of <em>think</em> appears in this
speech.</p>
<p>Accessing the columns works analogously: we simply place the number
after the comma:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm[,3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Document-feature matrix of: 3,247 documents, 1 feature (19.00% sparse) and 3 docvars.
##                        features

##   SEL_perparty_v2.csv.6    26
## [ reached max_ndoc ... 3,241 more documents ]</code></pre>
<p>We see here that <em>think</em> is a frequent feature, at least in
the first six speeches in the corpus. By looking at the metadata, or, as
we call them here, the document variables, we can see that the first six
speeches were all given by the same speaker. To access the document
variables and solve the riveting riddle of who this famous thinker is,
we can use another one of these intuitively named commands:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(docvars(dtm))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   party       fileid       name
## 1   rep    akeyes-95 Alan_Keyes
## 2   rep    akeyes-98 Alan_Keyes
## 3   rep akeyes1-2-00 Alan_Keyes
## 4   rep akeyes1-6-96 Alan_Keyes
## 5   rep akeyes1-6-98 Alan_Keyes
## 6   rep  akeyes10-96 Alan_Keyes</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>docvars</code> command, we get a list of the document
variables for each document, that is each row, in the <code>dtm</code>
object. However, we nest this inside of the command <code>head()</code>
- which is useful for taking a first look at any variable, since it only
displays the first six rows of a variable. We do this here because the
docvars are not subject to the same behavior protocol that the corpus
object is. Your computer is unlikely to overload if you were to
accidentally view the whole docvars without taking this
<code>head</code> precaution. So let’s try it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>docvars(dtm)[1:10, 1:3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    party         fileid       name
## 1    rep      akeyes-95 Alan_Keyes
## 2    rep      akeyes-98 Alan_Keyes
## 3    rep   akeyes1-2-00 Alan_Keyes
## 4    rep   akeyes1-6-96 Alan_Keyes
## 5    rep   akeyes1-6-98 Alan_Keyes
## 6    rep    akeyes10-96 Alan_Keyes
## 7    rep  akeyes11-5-00 Alan_Keyes
## 8    rep  akeyes11-9-95 Alan_Keyes
## 9    rep akeyes12-10-96 Alan_Keyes
## 10   rep  akeyes12-5-00 Alan_Keyes</code></pre>
<p>Even though it becomes clear enough which document variable stands in
which column, it requires a lot of scrolling to get to the top where the
precise name of each document variable is pasted at the top of each
column. The very top of the list is also where we find the answer to the
mystery of who uses <em>think</em> so gratuitously. If the name Alan
Keyes does not ring a bell, you are in the fortunate position to only
learn today of a person whose claims to fame include having run for
president three times, being appointed ambassador to the UN’s Economic
and Social Council by Ronald Reagan and filing a lawsuit against Barack
Obama - requesting documentation proving that Barack Obama is a natural
born citizen of the US. The things you learn in computational
linguistics never cease to amaze, eh?</p>
</div>
<div id="document-frequency-of-the-features" class="section level2"
number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Document Frequency of
the Features</h2>
<p>The next step in our journey toward document classification requires
us to count how often each feature appears in the corpus, for reasons
which will become apparent shortly. Our trusty friend, the Quanteda
package, anticipates this need and furnishes us with the appropriate
command, named <code>docfreq</code>. We use it to create a new variable,
<code>doc_freq</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>doc_freq = docfreq(dtm)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>docfreq</code> command takes our pre-processed corpus as an
argument, in the form of the <code>dtm</code> variable. The new
variable, <code>doc_freq</code> is now a long list of all the features
and their frequencies. We can confirm this by looking at the first
twenty entries, i.e. words:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(doc_freq, n=20)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   christian       usual       think      christ        term       oblig 
##         143         278        2630          30         954         559 
##     chariti       faith         god       forth         don           t 
##         158         827        1739         294        2341        2831 
##       alway       jesus       great      wisdom citizenship  understood

##        said        fact 
##        2572        1558</code></pre>
<p>The output shows us each feature and the number of occurrences. It
also shows us here that the features are not ranked by frequency yet,
but by order of appearance in the corpus. The first few features are the
ones we encounter in the first speech in the corpus.</p>
<p>To see which features occur most and least frequently in the corpus,
we can sort the variable <code>doc_freq</code>. To do this, we use the
intuitively named <code>sort()</code> function. In order to save
ourselves the trouble of scrolling, we nest the <code>sort()</code>
function inside the head function, which then looks thusly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(sort(doc_freq, decreasing=T), n=15)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        s    thank    peopl      can       us      one     want     year 
##     3165     3121     3091     3076     3041     3040     3030     3009 
##  countri     time     make     know     work      now american 
##     3009     2978     2977     2975     2955     2925     2908</code></pre>
<p>The outermost layer of the line is the <code>head()</code> command.
Inside of this, we nest the <code>sort()</code> function, which takes as
an argument the variable of interest, <code>doc_freq</code> and the
logical argument <code>decreasing = TRUE</code>. After closing the
brackets on the sort function, we add the specification that we want to
see the first fifteen entries of the head.</p>
<p>In the output, we see many features that we would expect to appear in
presidential campaign speeches. The contracted <em>’s</em> is the most
common feature, which makes sense considering that it can be used both
in the sense of <em>let’s build a better future together</em> or as a
possessive. Contraction are also generally used frequently in spoken
language. We are clearly reminded that we are dealing with a corpus of
political speeches, in because many words are associated with shaping
something: <em>can</em>, <em>want</em>, <em>make</em>, <em>work</em>
indicating the activities and <em>countri</em> pointing to the object to
be shaped. There are also flavors of urgency coming through, with
<em>year</em>, <em>time</em> and <em>now</em> referring to the
temporality of the campaign. Finally, we are reminded that we are
dealing with <em>American</em> politicians. So, we have a pretty good
interpretive turn-out already here.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For some insightful contrast, let’s look at the last fifteen features
in this ranking. To do this, we use almost exactly the same command as
before, but instead of nesting everything under <code>head()</code>, we
do it under the <code>tail()</code> function, like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tail(sort(doc_freq, decreasing=T), n=15)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##            umphf           brasim t-worry-be-happi        5-percent 
##                1                1                1                1 
## africa-caribbean              koz            4x400         meteorit 
##                1                1                1                1 
##      micro-organ        somebody-            nowak          pantoja 
##                1                1                1                1 
##           aspira          rosello        hillcrest 
##                1                1                1</code></pre>
<p>It would be possible to go and look at the contexts of these
features, but in the interest of your sanity and ours, we graciously
skip this step.</p>
<p>Instead, we return the earlier promise and explain why we created the
<code>doc_freq</code> variable. As we can still see in the output, the
features in the tail are on the one hand extremely rare, and on the
other hand not very useful. The latter reason would not be a criteria
for exclusion, but the fact that they are extremely rare could muddle up
the document classification model we are interested in, the model could
learn corpus coincidences, which are often referred to as
<em>noise</em>, thus blurring the <em>signal</em> of frequent words. So,
we remove all features from the corpus which occur less frequently than
five times. We do this using the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm = dtm[,doc_freq &gt;= 5]</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we are once again overwriting the <code>dtm</code>
variable with a specific iteration of the variable. This time, we choose
to retain all the features which occur more than five times in the
corpus, with the result that the features which occur less frequently
drop out. Let’s see how well this worked, using the same set of commands
as above. First, we overwrite the <code>doc_freq</code> variable with
the document frequencies of the latest version, then we check out the
<code>tail</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>doc_freq = docfreq(dtm)
tail(sort(doc_freq, decreasing=T), n=15)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      salina        soto   job-train  oldfashion    kennelli   underwood 
##           5           5           5           5           5           5 
##     telecom        huey   gutenberg      hilari kaleidoscop  multi-raci 
##           5           5           5           5           5           5 
##   sweepstak      bifida        1910 
##           5           5           5</code></pre>
<p>We now find a new set of random seeming words at the tail of the
<code>doc_freq</code> variable, but at least they all occur at least
five times, which means they won’t distort the model too badly. And just
to make sure we didn’t accidentally mess up the frequent features, we
can again take a look at the <code>head</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(sort(doc_freq, decreasing=T), n=15)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        s    thank    peopl      can       us      one     want     year

<p>Only to find, lo and behold, that they are identical to what we had
above. Awesome! But it makes sense to check if our data develops in the
expected way. Such checks, also called sanity checking, detect early on
if one is on the right track – instead of getting error messages in
one’s last processing step. On to a final step of preparation.</p>
</div>
<div id="tfidf" class="section level2" number="6.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> TFIDF</h2>
<p>Before we continue to the actual document classification (never fear:
we are actually going to get there), we need to weight the features in
the corpus object <code>dtm</code> by their tfidf. This beauty of an
abbreviation stands for
<code>term frequency-inverse document frequency</code>, and does exactly
what it says: the number of occurrences of the word in the current
document is divided by the number of documents in which the feature
occurs. By this division, we account for the fact that some words are
generally very frequent, and thus would receive an overproporational
amount of significance despite being rather pedestrian and carrying
little specific semantic content if we relied on frequency alone. An
example we’ve already discussed above is the contracted <em>’s</em>,
which is the most frequent feature in the corpus, on account of just
being a very common word in the English language.</p>
<p>Before we apply the tfidf weights, let’s load the first document in
the <code>dtm</code> object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm[1,]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Document-feature matrix of: 1 document, 11,785 features (94.03% sparse) and 3 docvars.
##                        features

##   SEL_perparty_v2.csv.1  82     1
## [ reached max_nfeat ... 11,775 more features ]</code></pre>
<p>This will save us a lot of scrolling time when we compare the pre-
and post-tfidf weights.</p>
<p>Once again, quanteda actually furnishes us with a command to easily
transform our <code>dtm</code> variable to adapt to the tfidf weights.
The command is self-explanatorily labeled <code>dfm_tfidf()</code>, and
we use it to overwrite the current version of the <code>dtm</code>
variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm = dfm_tfidf(dtm, force=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the command takes as its argument first the object
to be transformed. The second argument, the flag force=TRUE is usually
not needed. As a protection to makes sure that one does not tfidf-weight
twice, the dfm_tfidf function refuses to accept matrices that are
already weighted. Let’s take a look at the first entry of the
<code>dtm</code> object now, we can see that the weights of the features
have changed substantially:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm[1,]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Document-feature matrix of: 1 document, 11,785 features (94.03% sparse) and 3 docvars.
##                        features

## [ reached max_nfeat ... 11,775 more features ]</code></pre>
<p>Where before we had a simple count of occurrences, we now have the
tfidf scores. Some of the salient changes can be seen in the features
<em>christian</em> and <em>think</em>. In terms of raw counts, Alan
Keyes’ speech contains <em>christian</em> 17 times. With the tfidf
weights, <em>christian</em> actually becomes more important, with a
weight of 23.06. This indicates that <em>christian</em> is used
comparatively rarely in other speeches, making Keyes’ usage here more
impactful. By contrast, although <em>think</em> occurs 28 times in
Keyes’ speech, it only receives a tfidf score of 2.56, indicating that
it also features heavily in many other speeches in the corpus. Turns
out, Keyes is not a lone thinker among these politicians. What a
shocker.</p>
<p>Let’s stick with the feature <em>think</em> for a second, and look at
its tfidf score in the first few speeches. Remember that, since
<code>dtm</code> is an object containing data and a behavior, we can
simply enter the third column of <code>dtm</code> and receive six
manageable lines of output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm[,3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Document-feature matrix of: 3,247 documents, 1 feature (19.00% sparse) and 3 docvars.
##                        features
## docs                       think
##   SEL_perparty_v2.csv.1 2.562743

##   SEL_perparty_v2.csv.5 1.464425
##   SEL_perparty_v2.csv.6 2.379690
## [ reached max_ndoc ... 3,241 more documents ]</code></pre>
<p>We see that <em>think</em> generally has a relatively low score, but
the scores differ from speech to speech. The reason for this is that
each speech contains a different number of <em>think</em> features, but
quite a high number of speeches contain a relatively high number. Thus,
the count in each of these first six speeches is divided by the total
number of speeches containing <em>think</em>, yielding a different but
consistently rather low tfidf weight in each row.</p>
<p>As an aside, tfidf can be used directly to see which words are most
characteristic of a document, i.e. its keywords. We could see the
keywords of a document, for example document 1, by considering the words
with the highest tfidf values. The simplest way to do so is to sort the
tfidf values in decreasing order, from most to least frequent, and the
inspect the top of the list.</p>

<p>Finally, after a substantial amount of fine-tuning and preparing, we
get to the juicy bits: the document classification proper.</p>
<div id="the-training-data" class="section level2" number="7.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> The Training
Data</h2>
<p>In broad brushstrokes, it works the way it usually does: if you want
to generate an output, you need an input. This is what we spent the last
ten pages setting up. From the removal of punctuation, via lowercasing
and the removal of the features with less than five occurrences to the
weighting using the tfidf score, each step is a little boost that helps
our model achieve better results. The final (promise) step before
creating the actual model is choosing the input.</p>
<p>The situation, of course, is as follows: we have a corpus with 3,247
speeches, all of which have already been classified as being either
Republican or Democrat. If we were to simply throw the full corpus into
the model, we would run into a problem: we couldn’t test how good the
model is generally, because every scrap of data available to us right
now would be informing the model. Our results would not be robust.
Instead, what we want to do is sample a large chunk of the speeches
available to us, use that to train the model, and then test how good our
model is on the remaining speeches.</p>
<p>Once again, quanteda holds ready for us a command with the
descriptive name <code>dfm_sample()</code>. We use it as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train_dtm = dfm_sample(dtm, size=2800)</code></pre>
<p>Or, to put it into words: we create a new object called
<code>train_dtm</code>, since we are going to train the model with this.
The <code>train_dtm</code> object contains a sample of 2,800 speeches
from the pre-processed and weighted <code>dtm</code> corpus. For this
tutorial, we have just taken a random sample with a size corresponding
to roughly 85% of the corpus. There are no hard and fast rules as to
which percentage of the data should be used for training and which for
testing, but if you’re somewhere in the 90% ballpark for training data
you should be doing fine.</p>
<p>Let’s take a superficial look at our training data:</p>

<p>We see in the first row of the output that the object is a
document-feature matrix consisting of 2,800 documents, 11,785 features
and 3 document variables. We also see in the first column that the
speeches included do not form an interpretable sequence, indicating that
they are random. All is as it should be.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-testing-data" class="section level2" number="7.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> The Testing Data</h2>
<p>Now, let’s create the necessary counterpart, the testing data. We
create a new variable, which we’ll call <code>test_dtm</code>, and which
contains those speeches which are not part of the training data. The way
to do this is by taking the <code>dtm</code> object and choosing those
documents which constitute the difference between the full
<code>dtm</code> corpus and the <code>train_dtm</code> object. The
appropriate function for this is <code>setdiff()</code>, which takes as
arguments the documents which constitute the full <code>dtm</code>
corpus and removes the documents named in the <code>train_dtm</code>
variable. The function setdiff is actually used here as an index of the
dtm. Indices cannot only contain numbers, but also variables and entire
functions – Python programmers refer to this as list comprehension.
Observe that dtm is a two-dimensional object. We constrain the first
dimension (the rows, i.e. the documents) to those that are not part of
the training set, but the second dimension (the column, i.e. the word
features) is just kept. This explains the last letters of the following
code, the comma followed by the square bracket.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_dtm = dtm[setdiff(docnames(dtm), docnames(train_dtm)), ]

<p>Looking at the new <code>test_dtm</code> object, we see that it
contains the 447 speeches not included in the training data, but with
the same number of features and document variables. We can also see
that, this time round, the object is not a random sample: the documents
included are ordered numerically. In other words: all is as it should
be. And with that, onwards.</p>
</div>
<div id="naive-bayes" class="section level2" number="7.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Naive Bayes</h2>
<p>The first document classification model we are going to train is of a
type called Naive Bayes. We will not get into the statistical theory
behind Naive Bayes too much, only pointing out the distinctive feature
of this model. The name derives from the fact that the model applies
Bayes’ theorem with a strong, i.e. naive, independence assumption.
Basically, the model assumes that the class of any feature is
independent of the class of every other feature in the set. While this
is pretty simplistic, or even naive, it works well enough in practice.
Let’s have a look.</p>
<p>Training the model is simple enough, requiring just a single command,
aptly titled <code>textmodel_nb()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nb_model = textmodel_nb(train_dtm, y=docvars(train_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>You see that we once again created a new variable, this time one
called <code>nb_model</code>. We do so with the aforementioned
<code>textmodel_nb</code> command, which takes as first argument, or
input, the <code>train_dtm</code> object which we sampled earlier. The
second argument might be a bit more confusing.</p>
<p>One way to think about it is this: we have a two dimensional object.
On the x-axis, we have the training data. On the y-axis we have the
variable we want to predict, in this case the party of the speaker. With
Naive Bayes, training the model is basically a question of one simple
calculation: given that we see a feature on the x-axis, what is the
probability that the corresponding position on the y-axis is Republican.
Each feature is thus assigned a probability between 0 and 1, meaning it
is associated either more with the Democratic or more with the
Republican party. The dividing line for the result suggested is 0.5.
Simple as that, one might think. However, looking at the output of the
model, you may feel a bit underwhelmed:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nb_model</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## textmodel_nb.dfm(x = train_dtm, y = docvars(train_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))
## 
##  Distribution: multinomial ; priors: 0.5 0.5 ; smoothing value: 1 ; 2800 training documents;  fitted features.</code></pre>
<p>We get some information regarding the model’s distribution, priors,
smoothing value, training documents and fitted features, but nothing
about how well it performs.</p>
</div>
<div id="prediction" class="section level2" number="7.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Prediction</h2>
<p>In order to see how good our model is, we draw on the data we set
aside earlier, the data for testing. In this step, we use the
<code>nb_model</code> we trained a minute ago to predict the party to
which the politicians delivering the speeches in the test data belong.
The command for this is the <code>predict</code> function, which works
as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pred_nb = predict(nb_model, newdata=test_dtm)</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is the model, on the basis of which the prediction
is to be made. In this instance, we are obviously using our Naive Bayes
model, stored in the <code>nb_model</code> object. The second argument
is where we give the new data, which we set aside earlier in the
<code>test_dtm</code> variable. With that we define a new variable,
<code>pred_nb</code> which contains the predictions our model generated.
Let’s have a look at the first twenty positions:</p>

<p>What we get in the output here is exactly what we asked for: the
document title and the corresponding prediction. This is great, insofar
that we can essentially check the box on
<code>classify documents</code>. But, and this is where we’re really
getting into the thick of it: how can we figure out how well our model
performs?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="accuracy-and-interpretation" class="section level1" number="8">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Accuracy and
Interpretation</h1>
<p>you thought this was going to be straightforward: we extend our
sincere apologies. But we’re not done yet. Now that we have the
predictions for the party associated with every speech in the test data,
we can check how well the prediction performed. How? Well, we kept the
test data aside because it is already labeled, which means that we can
compare the the prediction to the actual (i.e. correct) label.</p>
<div id="confusion-matrix" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Confusion Matrix</h2>
<p>The first step for this is constructing the so-called confusion
matrix. The confusion matrix is a two-dimensional table which shows the
actual party associated with each speech on one axis, and the
predictions on the other. We can construct this using the
<code>table()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>confmat_nb = table(prediction = pred_nb, party = docvars(test_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Creating a new object called <code>confmat_nb</code>, our confusion
matrix for the Naive Bayes model, we assign to it a table. The
<code>table()</code> function takes as its arguments first the content
of the rows, here the values we predicted for the <code>pred_nb</code>
variable. Then it takes the content of the columns, here the document
variable <code>party</code> from the test data. As you will see as soon
as you look at the <code>confmat_nb</code> object, the labels
<code>prediction</code> and <code>party</code> to which we assign the
data are exactly that: the labels for the vertical and the horizontal
axis. Let’s take a look:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>confmat_nb</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           party
## prediction dem rep
##        dem 246   9
##        rep  11 181</code></pre>
<p>If everything worked out alright, you should see two pretty high
numbers in the top left and the bottom right. This is the diagonal on
which the actual label and the prediction correspond. As I’m running
this, I have 232 speeches by Democrats that were correctly predicted to
be by Democrats, and I have 187 speeches by Republicans that were
correctly predicted to be by Republicans (due to the fact that we used a
random sample, your numbers may be a bit different).</p>
<p>On the other diagonal, from bottom left to top right, we have the
wrong predictions. In my case here, that is 10 Democratic speeches that
were classified as Republican and 18 Republican speeches that were
classified as Democratic. With this representation of correct and
incorrect predictions, we can already see that the model isn’t too bad.
But to get an even better sense for how well it does, let’s put a number
on it.</p>
</div>
<div id="accuracy" class="section level2" number="8.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Accuracy</h2>
<p>Getting from the confusion matrix to a numeric representation of the
accuracy is pretty straightforward. First, we take the sum of all
correct predictions, then we divide it through the total sum of
predictions. One line of code to save this percentage value, then we
look at it, easy-peasy:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy_nb = (confmat_nb[1,1]+confmat_nb[2,2]) / sum(confmat_nb)
accuracy_nb</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9552573</code></pre>
<p>In my case, I get an accuracy of 94%, which is not at all shabby. You
will have received a slightly different number, which is due to the fact
that you have, in all conceivable likelihood, sampled a different set of
speeches to train your model. More on which in a minute. But first,
let’s dive a bit deeper into the Naive Bayes model and take a look at
the features which are representative for each party.</p>
</div>
<div id="feature-table" class="section level2" number="8.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Feature Table</h2>
<p>Let’s start with an obvious one: God. At least, it’s an obvious
feature in the American political context. One party is known for
heavily pandering to their god-fearing subjects, the other is known for
mildly pandering to their more or less god-fearing subjects. You get the
idea. Let’s see, then, how God features in our model as a predictor for
the two parties. We can see that by accessing the parameters of the
<code>nb_model</code> and specifying the parameter <code>god</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nb_model$param[,&quot;god&quot;]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##          dem          rep 
## 0.0003673162 0.0006974034</code></pre>
<p>Again, there will be slight differences in the output on account of
us using different samples, but your output should also indicate that
the feature <code>god</code> has roughly twice the weight for
Republicans than it does for Democrats. With this example, we are
obviously being facetious, but we think it’s useful to see</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>what the quote-unquote <em>insides</em> of the model look like,
and</p></li>
<li><p>how the same feature is differently weighted for the two
parties.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But let’s shift our perspective somewhat: instead of assuming that we
know how a feature will be differently weighted for the different
parties, let’s look at the features which have the strongest weights, to
find out what our data says is most typical for the Republican or the
Democratic party. To do so, we are again going to use the
<code>sort()</code> function, this time on the model parameters for the
Republican party, and nest it inside the <code>head()</code> function to
show the top thirty Republican features:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(sort(nb_model$param[&quot;rep&quot;,], decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##          tax    terrorist         bush         iraq        kerri       terror

<p>This is where it becomes interesting on a content level: we can see
that many of the strongest Republican features directly reflect aspects
of Republican policy priorities. There are strong flavors of national
security in the top thirty features, among them <em>terrorist</em>,
<em>enemi</em>, <em>war</em>, <em>attack</em>, <em>militari</em>, and
several more. There are features pointing to fiscal policy, with
<em>tax</em> and <em>money</em>; former Republican presidents, with
<em>georg</em> and <em>bush</em>; and we can be pretty certain that the
feature <em>11</em> refers to 9/11. Clearly, there is more to unpack
here, but we’ll leave that to you, and carry on by looking at the top
features in Democratic speeches:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(sort(nb_model$param[&quot;dem&quot;,], decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>

<p>The output again is not surprising, in the sense that the policy
focus of the Democratic party also becomes visible here. There are
features pointing to Medicare, with <em>health</em>, <em>insur</em>,
<em>care</em>, likely also <em>bill</em> (although it will probably also
be a reference to Bill Clinton, which would look exactly the same as a
result of our pre-processing); education is a big theme as well, with
<em>school</em>, <em>colleg</em>, <em>educ</em> and <em>student</em>
featuring prominently; and there is also a sense of inclusion, with
features like <em>communiti</em>, <em>everybodi</em> and
<em>tonight</em>.</p>
<p>We should state here clearly that these feature tables are great to
get a high-level view, firstly on whether the model managed to roughly
identify the key features, and secondly on what the content of a corpus
is, like the party programs here, but obviously no conclusions should be
drawn merely on the basis of these keywords. Just in case anyone needed
reminding.</p>
<p>That being said, there are many ways to mine these feature tables for
insight, and we’ll discuss some of them right now.</p>
</div>
<div id="weighted-feature-tables" class="section level2" number="8.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Weighted Feature
Tables</h2>
<p>The first weighting we do is very simple: we look at features that
are relatively more important for Republicans than for Democrats. They
way we do this is by dividing the the weight each feature has for
Republicans by the weight the same feature has for the Democrats, like
this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rel_weight_rep = (nb_model$param[&quot;rep&quot;,] / nb_model$param[&quot;dem&quot;,])</code></pre>
<p>Before looking at the results, a quick sanity check. We saw above
that all of the weights are rather small decimal numbers. What happens
when you divide a fraction by an even smaller fraction? You get a higher
number. So, if a feature has a high weight for Republicans, but a small
weight for Democrats, the result of the operation above yields a
relatively high number, one that is probably bigger than 1. We save the
results of the operation in a new variable, <code>rel_weight_rep</code>,
a step you’re very familiar with by now. Let’s see how this plays out,
by looking at the top 30 entries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(sort(rel_weight_rep, decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  sandinista        womb bush-cheney         sdi        bork     nuisanc

<p>This looks pretty different than the top 30 unweighted Republican
features, right? Most obviously, there are a lot of rare words in there
- <em>sandinista</em> or <em>bork</em>, anyone? - which indicates that
there is a sparse data problem. This is to say that, because some
features only occur a handful of times (in this case, thanks to our
pre-processing, a minimum of five times), they can end up overly
prominent. Our results will differ slightly from yours again, but we’ll
just take this as read in the following discussion.</p>
<p>Not everything we get in our output is readily interpretable, but
there are some features that are insightful and point to certain hot
topics. For instance, we have <em>womb</em> and <em>embryo</em> which
are plausibly connected with the Republican’s stance and debates on
abortion; we also find <em>moammar</em> and <em>ghadafi</em>, who was
the dictator of Libya at the time these speeches were made; another
feature of interest during these plague times is <em>bioshield</em>,
which refers to a US government project aimed at setting up an early
warning system for anthrax and other pathogens.</p>
<p>Let’s use the same procedure to generate the equivalent list for the
Democrats:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rel_weight_dem = (nb_model$param[&quot;dem&quot;,] / nb_model$param[&quot;rep&quot;,])
head(sort(rel_weight_dem, decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>

<p>As above, we get a bit of a mixed bag of features here, with some
features being somewhat unplaceable, but others tying in to relevant
policy topics. We get, for instance, <em>obes</em>, <em>calori</em> and
<em>nutriti</em>, which all relate to diet - which ties in with public
health policy; we also see the features <em>refinanc</em> and
<em>bailout</em>, which are reasonably important in the context of the
global financial crisis of the late 2000s.</p>
<p>Okay, so while there are some insights to be gleaned here that point
us to single events or referents, we are also left with a bunch of
features from which we cannot readily make heads nor tails. But we can
get more insightful feature tables: In order to detect broader trends,
we can add biases that favor features that occur with a high
frequency.</p>
<p>For this next step, take almost exactly the same measure as above,
except this time round, we take the Republican weights for the features
to the power of two, like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rel_weight_rep2 = (nb_model$param[&quot;rep&quot;,]^2 / nb_model$param[&quot;dem&quot;,])</code></pre>
<p>So, what are we doing here? Essentially, we are entering the
exponential realm, where the changes to numbers are in reference to
their original value. What this means is that the effect of an operation
is bigger on the weights which had higher value starting out, than to
those which had lower values.</p>
<p>Perhaps this becomes clearer with a numeric example. If we take the
second power of 0.1, the result is further away from the original number
than if we take the second power of 0.01. We can see this by subtracting
the second power:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>0.1-(0.1^2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.09</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>0.01-(0.01^2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.0099</code></pre>
<p>Why does this matter? Because the change to the rare words we saw
above, which came out on top of the list because they had higher
weights, is bigger than the change to the more frequent words, which did
not make the top pick because they had lower weights. Since we are
keeping the Democrat weights the way they were, we are basically evening
the playing field in our variable <code>rel_weight_rep2</code>. Let’s
see how that affects the top 30 feature table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(sort(rel_weight_rep2, decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  sandinista     nuisanc      frivol        womb bush-cheney         sdi

<p>After all the conceptual trouble we went through for these results,
you may be a bit underwhelmed to find a lot of the same words cropping
up. In our example, we find some shifts that indicate broader trends,
and you’ll likely see one or two more <em>mainstream</em> words in your
top 30 feature table us well, if you look closely.</p>
<p>In our case, the relevant new features are <em>regim</em>,
<em>iraqi</em> and <em>libya</em>. As mentioned earlier, Libya and
former dictator Muammar Gahadafi were big topics at the time, and we
think it’s telling that <em>libya</em> and <em>regim</em> only shows up
in the feature table after this weighting step, since it’s quite likely
that the Democratic candidates would also have discussed the Libyan
situation frequently during this period. The same, of course, goes for
the <em>iraqi</em> feature.</p>
<p>Okay, now let’s see how things stand for the Democrats:</p>

<p>In our results, we see a rather pronounced change in the output once
we apply this weighting to the Democrat features. The features showing
up in the top thirty here are fairly similar to the unweighted features,
and point to broadly recognizable policy issues: <em>health</em>,
<em>insur</em>, <em>care</em> and <em>bill</em> are likely in reference
to Medicare for All; <em>kid</em>, <em>school</em>, <em>educ</em>,
<em>student</em> and <em>college</em> point to the education platform
which a lot of Democratic candidates highlight.</p>
<p>Let’s look at two more ways of biasing the feature tables in favor of
frequent words. The next one is a lot more intuitive: we take the
weights, and multiply them by the document frequencies for each feature.
The more frequent a feature, the higher the result, and words mentioned
particularly frequently, for instance because they were <em>hot</em>
topics for longer periods of time, are boosted. Easy peasy:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rel_weight_rep3 = (nb_model$param[&quot;rep&quot;,]*doc_freq)
head(sort(rel_weight_rep3, decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       tax        re     senat        ve   freedom    govern    presid   america

<p>We are really entering mainstream topics now, and the features start
to tie in with the Republican policy themes on a major level: we get
<em>tax</em>, <em>freedom</em>, <em>secur</em>, <em>job</em> and
<em>busi</em>, pointing strongly to Republican domestic policy focal
points; we get foreign policy for a turbulent world with <em>war</em>,
<em>terror</em>, <em>forc</em>, <em>iraq</em>; and we get aspects of US
gouvernance, with <em>state</em>, <em>presid</em>, <em>nation</em>,
<em>vote</em> and <em>bush</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s also take a look at the top Democratic features under this
weighting scheme:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rel_weight_dem3 = (nb_model$param[&quot;dem&quot;,]*doc_freq)
head(sort(rel_weight_dem3, decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        re     thing         t    school    health       got        ve        go

##  1.750694  1.721126  1.718553  1.705778  1.680197  1.680027</code></pre>
<p>Here, we also get a rather distinct set of new words in the table: we
still have aspects of <em>care</em> and <em>health</em>, as well as
<em>educ</em> and <em>school</em>, but on top of that we get some
value-based features like <em>right</em> and <em>just</em>. This
weighting also shows a bit of how Democrats argue: there is a flavor of
causality with <em>becaus</em> and <em>need</em>, and there are calls
for the <em>new</em> and <em>chang</em>.</p>
<p>What cropped up in the top features for both parties are
contractions: <em>re</em>, <em>ve</em>, <em>don</em>, <em>t</em>, and
<em>m</em>. These are words that are generally frequent, and our
frequency weighting now has the side effect that entries for frequent
words overlap.</p>
<p>One could imagine a research question here: how well can document
classification distinguish between American and British politicians on
the basis of speeches?</p>
<p>Let’s look at a final weighting scheme. We use almost the same
approach as above, but this time round we multiply the feature weights
with the logarithms of the document frequency. This is different
compared to the other approaches in that it still somewhat favors
frequent words, but the gap between the more and less frequent words
becomes relatively small. The danger that generally frequent words,
e.g. contractions, move up to the top gets smaller. In case you need
convincing of this, just take a quick look at the first few document
frequencies and their logarithms:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(doc_freq)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## christian     usual     think    christ      term     oblig 
##       143       278      2630        30       954       559</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. Now let’s take a look at how this impacts the top
thirty features:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rel_weight_rep4 = (nb_model$param[&quot;rep&quot;,]*log(doc_freq))
head(sort(rel_weight_rep4, decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>

<p>The changes compared to the earlier weightings are relatively slight
here, but there are some different features which offer a new policy
flavor. While <em>tax</em> appears in most of the Republican top
features, regardless of the approach to weighting, here we get the
features <em>money</em> and <em>spend</em>, which chimes well with
Republican fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s see what this weighting yields for the Democrats:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rel_weight_dem4 = (nb_model$param[&quot;dem&quot;,]*log(doc_freq))
head(sort(rel_weight_dem4, decreasing=T), n=30)</code></pre>

<p>Again, we see many familiar features, but we get a few features which
bring in something new. We see <em>problem</em>, which is a good
springboard for any policy platform; we also get <em>percent</em>, which
may point to a mode of argumentation; and <em>everybodi</em>, augmenting
the message of inclusion which has been part of previous feature tables
in the form of <em>communiti</em>.</p>
<p>Having looked at all these different weightings and brought our
perspective as politically interested researchers to them, we ought to
issue a caveat: Obviously, we would have to go and look at the speeches
in detail to draw meaningful conclusions about what the policy programs
and interests of the Republican and Democratic parties are. What we
wanted to demonstrate here is that the feature tables and the different
weightings offer a strong flavor as to the most important topics, but
this should not be confused with actual political demands.</p>
<p>After this extensive trawl through the feature tables, two topics
remain for us to cover together here. The first of these are
alternatives to the Naive Bayes model. Second, and ultimately, we are
going to point out some steps which could be summarized aptly under
<em>Best Practices</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="alternative-models" class="section level1" number="9">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Alternative Models</h1>
<p>Although we did not state so explicitly above, you won’t be terribly
surprised at the fact that the Naive Bayes isn’t the only algorithm we
can use to train a document classification model. There is a flourishing
ecosystem of classification algorithms out there, from the <em>support
vector machine</em> to the <em>random forest</em>. The one we are
looking at here, though, is the logistic regression.</p>
<div id="logistic-regression-model" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Logistic Regression
Model</h2>
<p>All classification algorithms have their pros and cons, usually
resulting in a trade-off the researcher has to make between the amount
of computational capacity required, the accuracy of the model, the
interpretability etc. With the Naive Bayes model, we came down on the
side of the less computationally intensive and less accurate end. With
the logistic regression model, we ramp up both the computational
requirements as well as the accuracy, while still remaining easily
interpretable. You’ll see what we mean in a second.</p>
<p>A lot of what we are doing here should look very familiar. First, we
create a new variable, called <code>lr_model</code>. We assign to it a
text model based on the logistic regression algorithm, which we create
using one of these aptly named quanteda functions:
<code>textmodel_lr</code>. The arguments are identical to the arguments
in the Naive Bayes approach. First, we throw in the training data, then
we specify the document variable we want to train on. We run this
command, and take a peek at the <code>lr_model</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lr_model = textmodel_lr(train_dtm, y=docvars(train_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))
lr_model</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## textmodel_lr.dfm(x = train_dtm, y = docvars(train_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))
## 
## 2,800 training documents; 11,785 fitted features.
## Method: binomial logistic regression</code></pre>
<p>As with the <code>nb_model</code>, just looking at the
<code>lr_model</code> does not yield terrific insight, beyond the fact
that the model looks the way it ought. We can tell this from the
description: we input 2,800 training documents and have 11,785 features,
as always in our data. Most importantly for the current purpose, we
receive confirmation that the method is that of the <em>binomial
logistic regression</em>. Perfect!</p>
<p>To see how well the logistic regression model does, we take exactly
the same steps as we did for the Naive Bayes model: first, we use the
model to predict the party of the speeches in the test data. Then, we
create a confusion matrix. We also already draw up the confusion matrix
of the <code>nb_model</code>, so we can easily compare the two.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pred_lr = predict(lr_model, newdata=test_dtm)
confmat_lr = table(prediction = pred_lr, PARTY = docvars(test_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))
confmat_lr</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           PARTY
## prediction dem rep
##        dem 249   9
##        rep   8 181</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>confmat_nb</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           party
## prediction dem rep
##        dem 246   9
##        rep  11 181</code></pre>
<p>As above, we will not get exactly the same numbers here, but unless
something went terribly wrong, you should see that the logistic
regression model is somewhat more successful at correctly predicting the
party.</p>
<p>Let’s go a step further and put the proverbial and actual number on
it. We discussed earlier how we can calculate the accuracy from the
confusion matrix. So, we sum again the number of correct predictions and
divide them by the total number of predictions. And for easier
comparison, we’ll draw up the accuracy of the Naive Bayes model as
well:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy_lr = (confmat_lr[1,1]+confmat_lr[2,2]) / sum(confmat_lr)
accuracy_lr</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9619687</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy_nb</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9552573</code></pre>
<p>What we see in the confusion matrix is, of course, mirrored in the
accuracy of the models. In my case, the logistic regression model is
approximately 2.5 percentage points more accurate than the Naive Bayes
model. Does this roughly match the difference you see between your two
models?</p>
</div>
<div id="differences-explained" class="section level2" number="9.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Differences
Explained</h2>
<p>That we get different results when creating models using different
algorithms will not surprise you whatsoever. But you might have noticed
a different theme running through the last few steps: we are not able to
say confidently that the numbers we get are exactly the ones you are
seeing. The reason, as alluded to briefly above, is that chances are
really high that you are training your model on a different sample of
speeches than we are.</p>
<p>And you can see for yourself how this works. We are going to repeat
the steps from the data sampling to the calculation of the accuracy. The
only thing that changes is the set of training data that is sampled
initially. You can either just let the code do its thing and check out
the results; or you can quickly try to recall for yourself what each
line does (and sneak a peek at the descriptions above, in case you can’t
reconstruct why we are doing what). For didactic purposes, we obviously
recommend the latter, but we can’t hold a grudge against you if you just
want to see the results:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train_dtm2 = dfm_sample(dtm, size=2800)
test_dtm2 = dtm[setdiff(docnames(dtm), docnames(train_dtm2)), ]
lr_model2 = textmodel_lr(train_dtm2, y=docvars(train_dtm2, &quot;party&quot;))
pred_lr2 = predict(lr_model2, newdata=test_dtm)
confmat_lr2 = table(prediction = pred_lr2, PARTY = docvars(test_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))
confmat_lr2</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           PARTY
## prediction dem rep
##        dem 256   3
##        rep   1 187</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>confmat_lr</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           PARTY
## prediction dem rep
##        dem 249   9
##        rep   8 181</code></pre>
<p>You’ll find that the confusion matrices show a visible difference
between the two logistic regression models, trained on two different
samples. Constituted by the fact of how we calculate it, this difference
is obviously also reflected in the accuracy:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy_lr2 = (confmat_lr2[1,1]+confmat_lr2[2,2]) / sum(confmat_lr2)
accuracy_lr2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9910515</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy_lr</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9619687</code></pre>
<p>The difference we see here in the confusion matrix and the accuracy
have a pretty detrimental implication for any scientific application of
document classification: the results are not robustly replicable in the
face of random sampling. To prevent you from turning in naive results
(pardon the pun), we’ll discuss next what you can do in the face of this
issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="best-practices" class="section level2" number="9.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Best Practices</h2>
<p>In any field, whether empirical or theoretical, part of what
constitutes good academic practice is to be transparent about a) what
the steps you have taken to arrive from your starting point to your
conclusion and b) what the limitations and affordances of your
methodology are.</p>
<p>As far as the steps go, we have given you a detailed blow-by-blow
instruction about how we get from the input data to meaningful results,
both in terms of document classification accuracy and salient features.
If you made it this far into this notebook you must also be quite
convinced of the affordances of document classification. What we are
going to discuss next is probably the best way to address the
limitations of document classification which arise from sampling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sampling-and-re-sampling-our-way-to-robustness"
class="section level1" number="10">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Sampling and
Re-Sampling Our Way to Robustness</h1>
<p>Seeing as you’re here, we take it there’s a decent chance that you’ve
come across a normal distribution before. While we’re certain that
you’re a lovely person, all of us sometimes need our memories jogged -
in which case we recommend you refer to this excellent introduction to
descriptive statistics or our very own introduction to inferential
statistics, where we discuss and demonstrate in R how the normal
distribution arises, using the example of coin tosses (pardon the
shameless plug).</p>
<p>The reason we’re bringing this up is because you can use the
mechanisms of the normal distribution to increase the robustness of your
document classification results. While the data you’re training the
model on determines the precise accuracy of the model, there is nothing
much that can make it go too far afield. Consider: we are using ca. 90%
of the speeches to train the data. As a result most of the data is used
to train the models each time, meaning that there is only a limited
level of variation that can arise between the models trained on
different samples. The consequence of this is that if we train enough
models on enough samples and calculate the accuracy of each model, we
will end up with a normal distribution.</p>
<div id="loops" class="section level2" number="10.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Loops</h2>
<p>Since it’s a bit tedious to run through the whole sequence of
commands from sampling to calculating the accuracy, we can use a loop to
go through this process any given number of times (although here, as
with the choice of algorithm, there is a small trade-off between the
number of times we can and want to do this and the benefits to
robustness). Let’s take a look at how this loop thing works.</p>
<p>First, we construct a new variable. Let’s call it <em>accuracy</em>.
We’ll be basing our loop on this, so we will make <em>accuracy</em> a
vector, a list of numbers, whose length corresponds to the number of
times we want to run our loop. We can do this as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy = 1:100</code></pre>
<p>If you look at <code>accuarcy</code>, you can see that it’s just a
vector containing the integers 1 through 100:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18
##  [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36
##  [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54
##  [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72
##  [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90
##  [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100</code></pre>
<p>Now for the loop. If you’ve never come across this before, it might
seem like a bit of an unwieldy construction - in which case, we
recommend focusing first on the six lines of code inside the { curly
brackets }:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in accuracy){
  train_dtm = dfm_sample(dtm, size=2800)
  test_dtm = dtm[setdiff(docnames(dtm), docnames(train_dtm)), ]
  lr_model = quanteda.textmodels::textmodel_nb(train_dtm, docvars(train_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))
  pred_lr = predict(lr_model, newdata=test_dtm)
  confmat_lr = table(prediction = pred_lr, PARTY = docvars(test_dtm, &quot;party&quot;))
  accuracy[i] = (confmat_lr[1,1]+confmat_lr[2,2]) / sum(confmat_lr)
}</code></pre>
<p>What you find inside the curly brackets should, for the most part, be
familiar. In the first line, we have the sampling of the training data.
This is the essential step, which allows us to identify how robust our
results are. The second line defines the test data in relation to the
training data. In the third line, we train our linear regression model.
The fourth line uses the model to predict the parties of the speeches in
the test data. The fifth line creates the by now familiar confusion
matrix. And finally, in the sixth line, we calculate the accuracy, and
save it to our variable, <code>accuracy</code>.</p>
<p>The one unfamiliar element occurs in this sixth line, where we
indicate that the accuracy is to be saved to the index position [i] in
the vector <code>accuracy</code>. This starts to make sense if we look
at what is outside the curly brackets. The line which we actually start
the command with is <code>for (i in accuracy)</code>, followed by what
is in the brackets.</p>
<p>This basically states that for each index, each entry, in the vector
accuracy, the sequence of commands in the curly brackets should be
executed. With the sixth line inside the curly bracket, we make use of
the fact that we can overwrite any single value contained within the
vector <code>accuracy</code>, without altering the length of the
vector.</p>
<p>When we execute the loop, the six lines of code inside the curly
brackets run twenty times. The first time, the accuracy that we
calculate is saved in the first position of the vector, overwriting the
number <code>1</code> that was there before. The second time, the
calculated accuracy overwrites the second position of the vector, where
the number <code>2</code> was before. And so on, until each of the
twenty integers has been replaced with the accuracy of twenty models
trained on twenty different sets of training data.</p>
<p>We can see that this works by looking at the variable accuracy once
we’ve run the loop:</p>

<p>Where before we had integers, we now have values somewhere in the
ballpark of 92-98% (also depending on whether we use Naive Bayes or the
more performant Logistic Regression). On the one hand this shows us that
there is some observable variation in the accuracy of our models which
is predicated on the data sample the model is trained on. On the other
hand, it shows us that, regardless of the training data, the models all
reach a decent degree of accuracy somewhere above 90% also in a
worst-case scenario.</p>
</div>
<div id="demonstrating-robustness" class="section level2" number="10.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Demonstrating
Robustness</h2>
<p>While it’s easy enough to take in the results of the loop if we’re
working with a fairly low number of iterations, it becomes a bit more
challenging if we consider running this loop hundreds of times. In those
cases, we can summarize our results in some key statistics and show them
graphically in the form of a histogram. We aren’t going for any shiny
visuals here, but you can find many a good instruction into how to make
those. We’ll just show you the bare-bones approaches here.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to get a summary of a numerical vector is the
<code>summary()</code> command, which is part of basic R functionality.
Let’s take a look:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(accuracy)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.9083  0.9329  0.9396  0.9393  0.9485  0.9642</code></pre>
<p>We get several statistics here. On either pole of the output we see
the minimum and maximum values contained in the vector. In my case, the
worst model achieved an accuracy of 91% while the best model achieved an
accuracy of 97%. In between these two poles we have the median and the
arithmetic mean, the colloquial (sometimes even pedestrian) average. In
my case, both the medium and the mean landed on 94.2%, indicating both
that the module robustly achieves an accuracy of 94% and that the
accuracies are indeed normally distributed.</p>
<p>We can also visualize this normal distribution in a histogram, using
the <code>hist()</code> command. The first argument here is the data,
our <code>accuarcy</code> vector, and the second argument makes the
whole graphic more visually palatable (try it without this specification
to see what we’re talking about):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy %&gt;%
  as.data.frame() %&gt;%
  dplyr::rename(accuracy = 1) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = accuracy)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</code></pre>
<p><img src="atap_docclass_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What you see in the bottom right quadrant should roughly resemble a
normal distribution - although we will add the disclaimer that there is
a chance that it doesn’t, on account of the fact that we don’t have that
many data points. Once we reach somewhere around a thousand runs, we
should more or less reliably arrive at a normal distribution. But be
warned: if you do that, it’s probably worth starting the loop and then
going to fix yourself a snack. Unless you have a really good computer,
this could take a while.</p>
<p>What you’ll also notice about the graph we just created is that it’s
centered around the mean of our distribution. This is great when you
want to see what the distribution looks like. If you’ve arrived at the
point where you want to brag about how good your results are, we
recommend plotting the histogram showing all of the x-axis between 0 and
1. We can do this with the additional specification of
<code>xlim=0:1</code>. Like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy %&gt;%
  as.data.frame() %&gt;%
  dplyr::rename(accuracy = 1) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = accuracy)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,1)) +
  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</code></pre>
<p><img src="atap_docclass_files/figure-html/hist-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now you can see that the results cluster fairly heavily in the far
right of the graph, as expected. The final metric we want to draw your
attention to, in case it hasn’t sprung to mind yet, is the standard
deviation. There is a technical definition that you can look up at your
leisure; but in short it describes how widely the data is scattered
around the mean. The heuristic is that, the higher the standard
deviation, the less robust the results. Let’s take a look at the
standard deviations for our accuracies:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sd(accuracy)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.01088737</code></pre>
<p>In my case, I get a standard deviation of 1.2 percentage points. This
translates to the following: roughly 66% of all models achieve an
accuracy of 94.2% (the mean), plus and minus 1.2 percentage points. So
two thirds of the models make predictions that are 93% to 95.4%
accurate.</p>
<p>There are other methods to measure robustness, a popular one is
n-fold cross validation, in which we train n times, with a specific
1-1/n section used for training and 1/n for testing, in such a way that
every section is used once for testing. You could program n-fold cross
validation as an advanced exercise. Using a loop with random sampling is
a simple way to explore robustness, albeit less systematic than
cross-validation.</p>
<p>If you always want to get the same result, you can also force the
sampling to always return the same documents, by setting a seed for the
random calculation with the set.seed() function. While this ensures
reproducibility, it may hide robustness problems, and this is why we
chose not to use it.</p>
<p>For a spam filter, the performance of our system would clearly be
insufficient (we can see at least one of us biting into his laptop if
every 20th spam mail reached our inbox). But as you have seen, there are
various ways in which a higher accuracy can be achieved, from the
specific pre-processing steps to the choice of algorithms. While there
are dozens, if not hundreds, of other parameters that can be tweaked,
after working your way through this introduction you should be ready to
start your own document classification experiments and do cool stuff!
Let’s get on it!</p>
