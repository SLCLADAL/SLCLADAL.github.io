<div id="introduction" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h1>
<p>Most people work with computers daily, yet few have been taught how
to effectively organize files and folders, manage data, and prevent data
loss. This tutorial aims to fill that gap by providing practical advice
and general tips to keep your computer clean and running smoothly.
Additionally, we will explore methods for organizing files and folders
efficiently. Finally, we will offer guidance on managing and storing
data safely and orderly.</p>
<p>This tutorial will address the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your computer is very slow and gets very hot</li>
<li>Your filing system is a mess, and you want to tidy it up</li>
<li>You want to secure your files from unauthorized access</li>
<li>You want to work more efficiently with tabulated data</li>
</ul>
<p>Our focus will be on Windows machines, and the content is designed
for everyone, especially those who consider themselves less
computer-savvy. Therefore, we will not cover in detail the manual
optimization of Windows and system options. For more advanced users,
additional resources on optimizing Windows and system settings for
maximum performance can be found here.</p>
<p>This tutorial builds on resources such as the Digital Essentials
module offered by the UQ Library, the Reproducible Research resources
created by Griffith University’s Library and eResearch Services, and
Amanda Miotto’s Reproducible Research Things. For more comprehensive
information on computers, the digital world, and computer safety, refer
to the Digital Essentials course available through UQ’s library
resources.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding
of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping your computer running efficiently and preventing
overheating</li>
<li>Organizing your files and folders systematically</li>
<li>Securing your files to protect them from unauthorized access</li>
<li>Managing tabulated data effectively to enhance productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started on making your computer experience smoother and
more secure.</p>
</div>
<div id="general-tips-for-using-computers"
class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">General Tips for Using Computers</h1>
<p>In this section, we will cover some essential tips to prevent your
computer from slowing down or overheating. These tips are also useful
for increasing your computer’s speed. With proper care, even older
machines can handle most everyday tasks and meet your computational
needs.</p>
<div id="restart-your-computer-regularly"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Restart Your Computer Regularly</h2>
<ul>
<li>While it can be convenient to use sleep mode repeatedly, you should
shut down and restart your computer regularly. This is necessary to
install already downloaded updates and allows your computer to clear out
accumulated data. Rather than using sleep mode, shut down and restart
your computer at least once per week so automatic software updates can
be installed. In cases of high security risk, you may be forced to
restart your computer immediately, as updates often close security gaps
in specific programs or the operating system.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="keep-your-computer-up-to-date"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Keep Your Computer Up-to-Date</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keeping your computer up-to-date is crucial for smooth performance
and security. Outdated software lacks the latest security features and
can put your computer at risk.</li>
<li>Although updates can be annoying, they help close security gaps and
improve the functionality of the software you use. Regularly check for
updates to ensure your system is protected and runs efficiently. If you
are unsure how to check for updates, a step-by-step tutorial is
available here.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="monitor-your-computers-performance"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Monitor Your Computer’s Performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regularly monitor your computer’s performance to identify and
resolve potential issues early. Task Manager (Windows) or Activity
Monitor (Mac) can help you keep an eye on resource usage and terminate
unnecessary processes that slow down your system.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="manage-startup-programs" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Manage Startup Programs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many programs are set to start automatically when your computer
boots up, which can significantly slow down startup times. Use Task
Manager (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac) to manage and disable
unnecessary startup programs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="clean-up-your-hard-drive" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Clean Up Your Hard Drive</h2>
<ul>
<li>Over time, your computer accumulates unnecessary files that can slow
down performance. Regularly clean up your hard drive by deleting
temporary files, clearing cache, and removing unused programs. Tools
like Disk Cleanup (Windows) or CleanMyMac (Mac) can automate this
process.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="use-anti-virus-software" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Use Anti-Virus Software</h2>
<p>Using reliable antivirus software is essential to protect your
computer from malware, viruses, and other security threats. Here are
some key points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What Antivirus Software Does</strong>: Antivirus software
scans your computer for malicious software (malware) and checks if any
installed software behaves differently than expected if it were not
infected. It also prevents, detects, and removes malicious software to
protect your system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP)</strong>: This
antivirus software is installed on all UQ computers. SEP protects your
computer from malware and regularly checks for infections. To run a
manual scan, click on the antivirus software icon in the lower right
corner of your PC and follow the instructions. While SEP is not free for
private use, UQ members can get a discount through a special deal with
the manufacturer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Free Antivirus Alternatives</strong>: There are several
free antivirus options available if you prefer not to pay for antivirus
software. One popular choice is the free version of Avira. Avira not
only protects your computer from malware but also includes features to
improve your computer’s performance. Depending on the version, Avira can
also implement these improvements automatically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Malwarebytes</strong>: Another excellent option is
Malwarebytes, which also offers a free version. Malwarebytes is known
for its extensive and up-to-date malware database, which allows it to
detect even the most recent malware threats. It provides comprehensive
protection and is a valuable addition to your cybersecurity
toolkit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Scans and Updates</strong>: Regularly running
antivirus scans and keeping your software updated ensures that your
computer remains protected against the latest threats. Most antivirus
programs offer scheduled scans and automatic updates to keep your system
secure without requiring manual intervention.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By using reliable antivirus software and keeping it updated, you can
significantly reduce the risk of malware infections and maintain your
computer’s performance and security.</p>
</div>
<div id="optimize-power-settings" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Optimize Power Settings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adjust your computer’s power settings to balance performance and
energy consumption. In Windows, use the Power Options settings to select
a balanced or high-performance plan. On a Mac, access Energy Saver
preferences to customize your power settings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="keep-your-computer-physically-clean"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Keep Your Computer Physically Clean</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dust and debris can accumulate inside your computer, causing it to
overheat and slow down. Regularly clean your computer’s exterior and
interior components, such as the keyboard, vents, and fans. Use
compressed air to remove dust from hard-to-reach areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can ensure your computer remains
efficient, secure, and capable of handling your daily tasks. Proper
maintenance and regular updates are key to extending the life and
performance of your machine.</p>
</div>
<div id="look-out-for-leeches-and-malware"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Look out for leeches and malware</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you download software, it is quite common that, in addition to
the software you are looking for, other additional software will be
downloaded and installed as a default. To avoid this, make sure to
uncheck such options when installing the software that you want. This
simply requires that you pay attention and read the options that you can
check or uncheck during the installation when installing software.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="use-anti-virus-software-1" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Use anti-virus software</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Antivirus software checks if any software on your computer has
been reported as malware or if your software differs from what it should
look like if it were not infected.</p></li>
<li><p>Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) is an anti-virus software that
is installed on all UQ computers. This software protects your computer
from malware but also checks if your computer is already “infected”.
Such checks are performed regularly but to run such a check manually,
you can simply click on the antivirus software icon in the lower right
corner of your PC and follow the instructions. While Symantec Endpoint
Protection is not free and you have to pay a fee if you want to install
it on a private PC, UQ has a deal with the manufacturer that gives UQ
members a discount.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also free alternatives available such as the free
version of Avira in case you do not want to pay for anti-virus software.
Both the free and the commercial versions of Avira have the advantage
that they also allow you to check if the performance of your PC can be
improved (in addition to merely protecting your computer) and -
depending on the version - they can also implement these
improvements.</p></li>
<li><p>Another option that helps to detect software on your computer is
Malwarebytes which also has a free version and which has the most
up-to-date data base of malware which means that it is able to detect
even very “fresh” malware.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="no-data-on-desktop-or-c-drive"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">No data on Desktop or C-drive</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>When you start your computer, different parts of the computer are
started at different times with different priorities. The Desktop is
always started with the highest priority which means that if you have a
lot of stuff on your desktop, then the computer will load all that stuff
once it kicks into action (which will cause it to work quite heavily at
each start and also slow down quite dramatically).</p></li>
<li><p>This means that you should avoid storing data on any part of your
system that is activated routinely. Rather, try to separate things that
need to be loaded from things that only need to be loaded if they are
actually used. For this reason, you should also avoid storing data on
your C-drive. In fact, the C-drive should only contain programs as it is
activated automatically at each start.</p></li>
<li><p>You can, for example, store all your projects on your D-Drive or,
even better, on OneDrive, Google’s MyDrive, or in Dropbox where it is
only started once you actively click and open a folder. If you use
cloud-based storage options (OneDrive, Google’s MyDrive, or Dropbox) the
files are also backed up automatically. However, you should not use
either of these for sensitive data (sensitive data should be stored on
your PC, an external hard drive and UQ’s RDM.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to have data accessible via your desktop, you can
still do so by using links (also called short-cuts): place a link to
your data (stored on another drive) on your desktop and you can load
your data easily without it being activated at every start.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tidy-your-room" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Tidy your room!</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just like in real life, you should clean your computer. Full bins,
for instance, will slow down your computer so you should empty it
regularly. In addition, your computer will store and collect files when
it is running. These files (temp files, cookies, etc.) also slow your
computer down. As such files are redundant, they should be deleted
regularly. You can remove such files manually using the msconfig prompt
(you find a video tutorial on how to do this here). If you want to
optimize your computer manually via the msconfig prompt, simply enter
msconfig in the Window’s search box in the lower left corner of your PC
(or search for it in the search box that opens when you click on the
Window’s symbol). However, an easier way is to use software to help you
with cleaning your computer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="software-to-clean-your-computer"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Software to clean your computer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>While UQ provides various software applications that keep your
computer secure, it does not have any specific recommendations for
software to keep your computer digitally clean.</p></li>
<li><p>Luckily, there are numerous software applications that can help
you with keeping your computer clean and up-to-date (you will find a
list of software options for PCs here). We will only look at two options
here (The two applications we will discuss are CCleaner and Avira) but a
quick Google search will provide you with many different
alternatives.</p></li>
<li><p>The most widely used program to clean your computer (if you have
a PC rather than a Mac) is CCleaner. There are different versions of
CCleaner but the free version suffices to delete any superfluous files
and junk from your computer. When using this program, you should,
however, be careful not to remove information that is useful. For
instance, I like to keep all tabs of my current session in my browser
and I therefore have to change the default options in CCleaner to avoid
having to reopen all my tabs when I next open my browser. Here is a
short video tutorial on how to use the CCleaner.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, the free version of Avira also has a function that
you can use to clean your computer. In fact, Avira will also inform you
about any software that is out-of-date and other issues. Here is a short
video tutorial on how to use the Avira for cleaning your computer and
performing an anti-virus scan.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="encryption-and-computer-security"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Encryption and Computer Security</h2>
<p>Ensuring that your computer and network are secured means that you
have far less a chance of a data breach or hack.</p>
<p>As some information is sensitive (especially when it comes to exams
and attendance in courses), I encrypt folders and files that contain
such information. To encrypt a file or folder I right-click on the file
or folder and go to properties &gt; advanced, the I check encrypt
contents to secure data and confirm the changes by checking OK. Then I
back-up the encryption key where I check enable certificate privacy and
create password and store the encrypted file in the original folder. You
can find a step-by-step guide on how to encrypt files in this video.</p>
<p>You can also encrypt your entire computer. Information about how to
do this can be found here and tips specific for</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Macs can be found <a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204837">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Windows 10 can be found <a
href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Windows 7 can be found <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=4794">here</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also recommendable to use or create strong passwords. Here are
some tips for creating secure passwords:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t just use one password - use a different password for every
account</p></li>
<li><p>Use a pass phrase - instead of a singular word, try a sequence of
words for instance, DogsandCatsareawesome (Do not use this as your
password)</p></li>
<li><p>Include numbers, capital letters and symbols</p></li>
<li><p>The longer the password, the better</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t write passwords down</p></li>
<li><p>Turn on two-factor authentication</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative is to use a password manager. Again, the Digital
Essentials module has a lot of information about password management
(password managers explained in detail in section 4).</p>
<p>Password managers provide a similar level of convenience to “Login
with Facebook” but are much safer. Password managers create an encrypted
database of all your usernames and passwords, that only you can access
with a master password. This means you only need to remember one
password to have access to all of your accounts. Most password managers
will include the ability to generate secure passwords that you can use
for new or existing account logins. Because you only need to remember
one master password, you can generate and store complex passwords for
your needs. This way, you are not relying on your memory and easy
passwords to remember many different account login details.</p>
<p>Also, to find out if your email has been compromised, you can check
this here</p>
<p>Recently, UQ has adopted Multi-Factor Authentication which is more
secure than simple authentication. You should use it when the option is
available (Signing in with a password and an email to your account with
a pin).</p>
<p>As a general tip, avoid unsecured wifi and, if its available, Eduroam
is usually a better option than free wifi/cafe wifi.</p>
<p>For Beginners</p>
<ul>
<li>Have good strong passwords and encrypt your computer’s hard
drive</li>
</ul>
<p>For Intermediates</p>
<ul>
<li>Get set up on a password manager</li>
</ul>
<p>For Advanced passwordists</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to ensure that your team/cluster is encrypted and practicing
safe habits.</li>
</ul>
