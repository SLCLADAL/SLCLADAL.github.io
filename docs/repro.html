<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Basic concepts</h1>
<p>This section introduces some basic concepts and provides useful tips
for managing your research data.</p>
<div id="what-is-data-management" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">What is Data Management?</h2>
<p>Data management refers to the comprehensive set of practices,
policies, and processes used to manage data throughout its lifecycle
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-corea2019data">Corea 2019, chap.
1</a>)</span>. This involves ensuring that data is collected, stored,
processed, and maintained in a way that it can be effectively used for
analytical purposes. Good data management is crucial for enabling
accurate, reliable, and meaningful analysis.</p>
<p>Key components of data management in data analytics include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Data Collection and Acquisition</strong>: Gathering data
from various sources, which can include databases, APIs, sensors, web
scraping, and more. The goal is to ensure the data is collected in a
systematic and consistent manner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Utilizing databases, data
warehouses, data lakes, or cloud storage solutions to store collected
data securely and efficiently. This ensures that data is easily
accessible for analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Cleaning and Preparation</strong>: Involves
identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data to
improve its quality. This step is critical for ensuring the accuracy of
any subsequent analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Integration</strong>: Combining data from different
sources into a single, unified dataset. This often involves ETL
(Extract, Transform, Load) processes where data is extracted from
different sources, transformed into a consistent format, and loaded into
a central repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Governance</strong>: Establishing policies and
procedures to ensure data is managed properly. This includes defining
roles and responsibilities, ensuring data privacy and security, and
maintaining compliance with regulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Security</strong>: Implementing measures to protect
data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other threats. This
involves encryption, access controls, and regular security
audits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Using statistical methods,
algorithms, and software tools to analyze data and extract meaningful
insights. This can involve descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive
analytics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Presenting data in graphical
or pictorial formats such as charts, graphs, and dashboards to help
users understand trends, patterns, and insights more easily.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Quality Management</strong>: Continuously monitoring
and maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. This
involves data profiling, validation, and auditing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metadata Management</strong>: Managing data about data,
which includes documenting the data’s source, format, and usage.
Metadata helps in understanding the context and provenance of the
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Lifecycle Management</strong>: Managing data through
its entire lifecycle, from initial creation and storage to eventual
archiving and deletion. This ensures that data is managed in a way that
supports its long-term usability and compliance with legal
requirements.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Effective data management practices ensure that data is high quality,
well-organized, and accessible, which is essential for accurate and
actionable data analytics. By implementing robust data management
strategies, organizations can improve the reliability of their analyses,
make better-informed decisions, and achieve greater operational
efficiency.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Reproducibility and Transparency</h2>
<p>Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, demanding
that two analyses empirical analyses yield consistent outcomes under
equivalent conditions and with comparable populations under scrutiny
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gundersen2021repro">Gundersen
2021</a>; <a href="#ref-goodman2016repro">Goodman, Fanelli, and
Ioannidis 2016</a>)</span>. Historically, the reproducibility of
scientific findings was often assumed, but this assumption has been
substantially challenged by the Replication Crisis <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-moonesinghe2007false">Moonesinghe,
Khoury, and Janssens 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-simons2014repro">Simons
2014</a>)</span>. The Replication Crisis, extensively documented <span
class="citation">Ioannidis (<a
href="#ref-ioannidis2005false">2005</a>)</span>, represents an ongoing
methodological quandary stemming from the failure to reproduce critical
medical studies and seminal experiments in social psychology during the
late 1990s and early 2000s. By the early 2010s, the crisis had extended
its reach to encompass segments of the social and life sciences <span
class="citation">Diener and Biswas-Diener (<a
href="#ref-noba2019replication">2019</a>)</span>, significantly eroding
public trust in the results of studies from the humanities and social
sciences <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-sciencealert2018replication">McRae 2018</a>; <a
href="#ref-atlantic2018psychology">Yong 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Below are definitions of terms relevant for distinguishing in
discussions around reproducibility and transparency. This clarification
is necessary to avoid misunderstandings stemming from the common
conflation of similar yet different terms in this discourse.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Replication</strong>: Replication involves repeating a
study’s procedure to determine if the prior findings can be reproduced.
Unlike reproduction, which utilizes the same data and method,
replication entails applying a similar method to different but
comparable data. The aim is to ascertain if the results of the original
study are robust across new data from the same or similar populations.
Replication serves to advance theory by subjecting existing
understanding to new evidence <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-nosek2020replication">Nosek and Errington 2020</a>; <a
href="#ref-moonesinghe2007false">Moonesinghe, Khoury, and Janssens
2007</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reproduction</strong>: In contrast, reproduction (or
computational replication) entails repeating a study by applying the
exact same method to the exact same data (this is what <span
class="citation">McEnery and Brezina (<a
href="#ref-mcenery2022fundamental">2022</a>)</span> refer to as
<em>repeatability</em>). The results should ideally be identical or
highly similar to those of the original study. Reproduction relies on
reproducibility, which assumes that the original study’s authors have
provided sufficient information for others to replicate the study. This
concept often pertains to the computational aspects of research, such as
version control of software tools and environments <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nosek2020replication">Nosek and
Errington 2020</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>: Robustness refers to the stability
of results when studies are replicated using different procedures on
either the same or different yet similar data. While replication studies
may yield different results from the original study due to the use of
different data, robust results demonstrate consistency in the direction
and size of effects across varying procedures <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-nosek2020replication">Nosek and Errington
2020</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Triangulation</strong>: Recognizing the limitations of
replication and reproducibility in addressing the issues highlighted by
the Replication Crisis, researchers emphasize the importance of
triangulation. Triangulation involves strategically employing multiple
approaches to address a single research question, thereby enhancing the
reliability and validity of findings <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-munafo2018robust">Munafò and Davey Smith
2018</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practical versus theoretical/formal
reproducibility</strong>: This distinction distinguishes between
practical and theoretical or formal reproducibility <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-msch2024repro">Schweinberger
2024</a>)</span>. Practical reproducibility emphasizes the provision of
resources by authors to facilitate the replication of a study with
minimal time and effort. These resources may include notebooks, code
repositories, or detailed documentation, allowing for the
reproducibility of studies across different computers and software
environments <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-gruning2018practical">Grüning et al.
2018</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Transparency in research entails
clear and comprehensive reporting of research procedures, methods, data,
and analytical techniques. It involves providing sufficient information
about study design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation to
enable others to understand and potentially replicate the study.
Transparency is particularly relevant in qualitative and interpretive
research in the social sciences, where data sharing may be limited due
to ethical or copyright considerations <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-moravcsik2019transparency">Moravcsik
2019</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We now move on to some practical tips and tricks on how to implement
transparent and well-documented research practices.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="organizing-projects" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Organizing Projects</h1>
<p>In this section, we focus on what researchers can do to render their
workflows more transparent, recoverable, and reproducible.</p>
<p>A very easy-to-implement, yet powerful method for maintaining a tidy
and transparent workflow relates to project management and organization.
Below are some tips to consider when planning and organizing
projects.</p>
<div id="folder-structures" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Folder Structures</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/folderstructure2.png" width="35%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Different methods of organizing your folders have unique advantages
and challenges, but they all share a reliance on a tree-structure
hierarchy, where more general folders contain more specialized
subfolders. For instance, if your goal is to locate any file with
minimal clicks, an alphabetical folder structure might be effective. In
this system, items are stored based on their initial letter (e.g.,
everything starting with a “T” like “travel” under “T”, or everything
related to “courses” under “C”). However, this method can be unintuitive
as it groups completely unrelated topics together simply because they
share the same initial letter.</p>
<p>A more common and intuitive approach is to organize your data into
meaningful categories that reflect different aspects of your life. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Work</strong>: This can include subfolders like
<em>Teaching</em> and <em>Research</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Personal</strong>: This can encompass <em>Rent</em>,
<em>Finances</em>, and <em>Insurances</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Media</strong>: This might include <em>Movies</em>,

</ul>
<p>This method not only makes it easier to locate files based on context
but also keeps related topics grouped together, enhancing both
accessibility and logical organization.</p>
<p>To further improve folder organization, consider the following best
practices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Use a consistent naming convention to
avoid confusion.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Use clear and descriptive names for
folders and files.</li>
<li><strong>Date-Based Organization</strong>: For projects that evolve
over time, include dates in the folder names.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Maintenance</strong>: Periodically review and
reorganize your folders to keep them tidy and relevant.</li>
</ol>
<p>Folders and files should be labeled in a meaningful and consistent
way to avoid ambiguity and confusion. Avoid generic names like
<em>Stuff</em> or <em>Document</em> for folders, and <em>doc2</em> or
<em>homework</em> for files. Naming files consistently, logically, and
predictably helps prevent disorganization, misplaced data, and potential
project delays. A well-thought-out file naming convention ensures that
files are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier to Process</strong>: Team members won’t have to
overthink the file naming process, reducing cognitive load.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to Access, Retrieve, and Store</strong>: A consistent
naming convention facilitates quick and easy access to files.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to Browse Through</strong>: Organized files save time
and effort when searching through directories.</li>
<li><strong>Harder to Lose</strong>: A logical structure makes it less
likely for files to be misplaced.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to Check for Obsolete or Duplicate Records</strong>:
Systematic naming aids in identifying and managing outdated or redundant
files.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Folders for Research and Teaching</h2>
<p>Having a standard folder structure can keep your files neat and tidy
and save you time looking for data. It can also help if you are sharing
files with colleagues and having a standard place to put working data
and documentation.</p>
<p>Store your projects in a separate folder. For instance, if you are
creating a folder for a research project, create the project folder
within a separate <em>project</em> folder that is within a
<em>research</em> folder. If you are creating a folder for a course,
create the course folder within a <em>courses</em> folder within a
<em>teaching</em> folder, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/folderstructure.png" width="35%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Whenever you create a folder for a new project, try to have a set of
standard folders. For example, when I create research project folders, I
always have folders called <em>archive</em>, <em>data</em>,
<em>docs</em>, and <em>images</em>. When I create course folders, I
always have folders called <em>slides</em>, <em>assignments</em>,
<em>exam</em>, <em>studentmaterials</em>, and <em>correspondence</em>.
However, you are, of course, free to modify and come up or create your
own basic project design. Also, by prefixing the folder names with
numbers, you can force your files to be ordered by the steps in your
workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having different sub folders allows you to avoid having too many
files and many different file types in a single folder. Folders with
many different files and file types tend to be chaotic and can be
confusing. In addition, I have one ReadMe file on the highest level
(which only contains folders except for this one single file) in which I
describe very briefly what the folder is about and which folders contain
which documents as well as some basic information about the folder
(e.g. why and when I created it). This ReadMe file is intended both for
me as a reminder what this folder is about and what it contains but also
for others in case I hand the project over to someone else who continues
the project or for someone who takes over my course and needs to use my
materials.</li>
</ul>

<div id="shared-folder-structures" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Shared Folder Structures</h2>
<p>If you work in a team or regularly share files and folders,
establishing a logical structure for collaboration is essential. Here
are key considerations for developing an effective team folder
structure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Pre-existing Agreements</strong>: Before implementing a
new folder structure, ensure there are no existing agreements or
conventions in place. Collaborate with team members to assess the
current system and identify areas for improvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaningful Naming</strong>: Name folders in a way that
reflects their contents and purpose. Avoid using staff names and opt for
descriptive labels that indicate the type of work or project. This
ensures clarity and accessibility for all team members.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Maintain consistency across the
folder hierarchy to facilitate navigation and organization. Adhere to
the agreed-upon structure and naming conventions to streamline workflows
and minimize confusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hierarchical Structure</strong>: Organize folders
hierarchically, starting with broad categories and gradually narrowing
down to more specific topics. This hierarchical arrangement enhances
organization and facilitates efficient file retrieval.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Differentiate Ongoing and Completed Work</strong>:
Differentiate between ongoing and completed work by segregating folders
accordingly. As projects progress and accumulate files, separating older
documents from current ones helps maintain clarity and focus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backup Solutions</strong>: Implement robust backup
solutions to safeguard against data loss in the event of a disaster.
Utilize university-provided storage solutions or external backup
services to ensure files are securely backed up and
retrievable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Post-Project Cleanup</strong>: Conduct regular cleanup
activities to remove redundant or obsolete files and folders
post-project completion. This declutters the workspace, improves
efficiency, and ensures that relevant data remains easily
accessible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By following these guidelines, teams can establish a cohesive and
efficient folder structure that promotes collaboration, organization,
and data integrity.</p>

<div id="file-naming-convention-fnc" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">File Naming Convention (FNC)</h2>
<p>One of the most basic but also most important practices a researcher
can do to improve the reproducibility and transparency of their research
is to follow a consistent file naming convention. A File Naming
Convention (FNC) is a systematic framework for naming your files in a
way that clearly describes their contents and, importantly, how they
relate to other files. Establishing an agreed-upon FNC before collecting
data is essential as it ensures consistency, improves organization, and
facilitates easier retrieval and collaboration. By establishing a clear
and consistent File Naming Convention, you can significantly improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of your data management practices, making
it easier to handle, share, and preserve important information.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/naming.png" width="50%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Key elements to consider when creating a File Naming Convention
include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Descriptive Names</strong>: Use clear and descriptive
names that provide information about the file’s content, purpose, and
date. Avoid vague or generic names.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Apply the same naming format across
all files to maintain uniformity. This includes using consistent date
formats, abbreviations, and capitalization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version Control</strong>: Incorporate version numbers or
dates in the file names to track revisions and updates. For example,
“ProjectReport_v1.0_2024-05-22.docx”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid Special Characters</strong>: Use only alphanumeric
characters and underscores or hyphens to avoid issues with different
operating systems or software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Length and Readability</strong>: Keep file names concise
yet informative. Avoid overly long names that may be difficult to read
or cause problems with file path limitations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organizational Context</strong>: Reflect the file’s place
within the broader project or system. For example, use a prefix that
indicates the department or project phase.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Example of a File Naming Convention:</p>
<pre><code>[ProjectName]_[DocumentType]_[Date]_[Version].[Extension]</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>ClimateStudy_Report_20240522_v1.0.docx</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/goodnaming.png" width="35%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Here are some additional hints for optimizing file naming:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Avoid Special Characters</strong>: Special characters
like +, !, “, -, ., ö, ü, ä, %, &amp;, (, ), [, ], &amp;, $, =, ?, ’, #,
or / should be avoided. They can cause issues with file sharing and
compatibility across different systems. While underscores (_) are also
special characters, they are commonly used for readability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No White Spaces</strong>: Some software applications
replace or collapse white spaces, which can lead to problems. A common
practice is to capitalize initial letters in file names to avoid white
spaces (e.g., <em>TutorialIntroComputerSkills</em> or
<em>Tutorial_IntroComputerSkills</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include Time-Stamps</strong>: When adding dates to file
names, use the YYYYMMDD format. This format ensures that files are
easily sorted in chronological order. For example, use
<em>TutorialIntroComputerSkills20230522</em> or
<em>Tutorial_IntroComputerSkills_20230522</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Benefits of a robust File Naming Convention include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Organization</strong>: Files are easier to
categorize and locate.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Collaboration</strong>: Team members can understand
and navigate the file structure more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency and Standardization</strong>: Reduces errors and
confusion, ensuring that everyone follows the same system.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined Data Management</strong>: Simplifies the process
of managing large volumes of data.</li>

<div id="data-handling-and-management"
class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Data Handling and Management</h1>
<p>The following practical tips and tricks focus on data handling and
provide guidance to avoid data loss.</p>
<div id="keeping-copies-and-the-3-2-1-rule"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Keeping copies and the 3-2-1 Rule</h2>
<p>Keeping a copy of all your data (working, raw, and completed) both in
the cloud (recommended) and on your computer is incredibly important.
This ensures that if you experience a computer failure, accidentally
delete your data, or encounter data corruption, your research remains
recoverable and restorable.</p>
<p>When working with and processing data, it is also extremely important
to always keep at least one copy of the original data. The original data
should never be deleted; instead, you should copy the data and delete
only sections of the copy while retaining the original data intact.</p>
<p>The 3-2-1 backup rule has been developed as a guide against data loss
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcmaster2021data">Pratt
2021</a>)</span>. According to this rule, one should strive to have at
least three copies of your project stored in different locations.
Specifically, maintain at least three (3) copies of your data, storing
backup copies on two (2) different storage media, with one (1) of them
located offsite. While this guideline may vary depending on individual
preferences, I personally adhere to this approach for safeguarding my
projects.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/copiesrule.jpg" width="50%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>on my personal notebook</p></li>
<li><p>on at least one additional hard drive (that you keep in a secure
location)</p></li>
<li><p>in an online repository (for example, UQ’s <a
href="https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm"><em>Research Data
Management system (RDM)</em></a> <em>OneDrive</em>, <em>MyDrive</em>,
<em>GitHub</em>, or <em>GitLab</em>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/homercopies.jpg" width="30%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Using online repositories ensures that you do not lose any data in
case your computer crashes (or in case you spill lemonade over it -
don’t ask…) but it comes at the cost that your data can be more
accessible to (criminal or other) third parties. Thus, if you are
dealing with sensitive data, I suggest to store it on an additional
external hard drive and do not keep cloud-based back-ups. If you trust
tech companies with your data (or think that they are not interested in
stealing your data), cloud-based solutions such as <em>OneDrive</em>,
Google’s <em>MyDrive</em>, or <em>Dropbox</em> are ideal and easy to use
options (however, <a href="https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm">UQ’s
RDM</a> is a safer option).</p>
<p>The UQ library also offers additional information on complying with
ARC and NHMRC data management plan requirements and that <a

requirements for sensitive data (see <a

<h2 class="unnumbered">Dealing with Sensitive Data</h2>
<p>This section will elaborate on who to organize and handle (research)
data and introduce some basic principles that may help you to keep your
data tidy.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for sensitive data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive data are data that can be used to identify an individual,
species, object, or location that introduces a risk of discrimination,
harm, or unwanted attention. Major, familiar categories of sensitive
data are: personal data - health and medical data - ecological data that
may place vulnerable species at risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Separating identifying variables from your data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Separating or deidentifying your data has the purpose to protect
an individual’s privacy. According to the Australian Privacy Act 1988,
“personal information is deidentified if the information is no longer
about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonably
identifiable”. Deidentified information is no longer considered personal
information and can be shared. More information on the Commonwealth
Privacy Act can be located <a
href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00979">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Deidentifying aims to allow data to be used by others for
publishing, sharing and reuse without the possibility of
individuals/location being re-identified. It may also be used to protect
the location of archaeological findings, cultural data of location of
endangered species.</p></li>
<li><p>Any identifiers (name, date of birth, address or geospatial
locations etc) should be removed from main data set and replaced with a
code/key. The code/key is then preferably encrypted and stored
separately. By storing deidentified data in a secure solution, you are
meeting safety, controlled, ethical, privacy and funding agency
requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-identifying an individual is possible by recombining the
deidentifiable data set and the identifiers.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="managing-deidentification-ardc"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Managing Deidentification (ARDC)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan deidentification early in the research as part of your data
management planning</p></li>
<li><p>Retain original unedited versions of data for use within the
research team and for preservation</p></li>
<li><p>Create a deidentification log of all replacements, aggregations
or removals made</p></li>
<li><p>Store the log separately from the deidentified data
files</p></li>
<li><p>Identify replacements in text in a meaningful way, e.g. in
transcribed interviews indicate replaced text with [brackets] or use XML
mark-up tags.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Management of identifiable data (ARDC)</strong></p>
<p>Data may often need to be identifiable (i.e. contains personal
information) during the process of research, e.g. for analysis. If data
is identifiable then ethical and privacy requirements can be met through
access control and data security. This may take the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Control of access through physical or digital means
(e.g. passwords)</p></li>
<li><p>Encryption of data, particularly if it is being moved between
locations</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring data is not stored in an identifiable and unencrypted
format when on easily lost items such as USB keys, laptops and external
hard drives.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking reasonable actions to prevent the inadvertent disclosure,
release or loss of sensitive personal information.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Software</h2>
<p>Using free, open-source software for data processing and analysis,
such as Praat, R, Python, or Julia, promotes transparency and
reproducibility by reducing financial access barriers and enabling
broader audiences to conduct analyses. Open-source tools provide a
transparent and accessible framework for conducting analyses, allowing
other researchers to replicate and validate results while eliminating
access limitations present in commercial tools, which may not be

<p>Documentation involves meticulously recording your work so that
others—or yourself at a later date—can easily understand what you did
and how you did it. This practice is crucial for maintaining clarity and

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Be Clear and Concise</strong>: Write in a straightforward
and concise manner. Avoid jargon and complex language to ensure that
your documentation is accessible to a wide audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include Context</strong>: Provide background information
to help the reader understand the purpose and scope of the work. Explain
why certain decisions were made.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step-by-Step Instructions</strong>: Break down processes
into clear, sequential steps. This makes it easier for someone to follow
your workflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Consistent Formatting</strong>: Consistency in

<h2 class="unnumbered">Documentation and the Bus Factor</h2>
<p>Documentation is not just about where your results and data are
saved; it encompasses a wide range of forms depending on your needs and
work style. Documenting your processes can include photos, word
documents with descriptions, or websites that detail how you work.</p>
<p>The concept of documentation is closely linked to the <em>Bus
Factor</em> <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-jabrayilzade2022bus">Jabrayilzade et al. 2022</a>)</span> — a
measure of how many people on a project need to be unavailable (e.g.,
hit by a bus) for the project to fail. Many projects have a bus factor
of one, meaning that if the key person is unavailable, the project
halts. Effective documentation raises the bus factor, ensuring that the
project can continue smoothly if someone suddenly leaves or is
unavailable.</p>
<p>In collaborative projects, having a log of where to find relevant
information and who to ask for help is particularly useful. Ideally,
documentation should cover everything that a new team member needs to
know. The perfect person to create this log is often the last person who
joined the project, as they can provide fresh insights into what
information is most needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-an-onboarding-log" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Creating an Onboarding Log</h2>
<p>If you haven’t created a log for onboarding new team members, it’s
highly recommended. This log should be stored in a ReadMe document or
folder at the top level of the project directory. This ensures that
essential information is easily accessible to anyone who needs it.</p>
<p>By documenting thoroughly and effectively, you improve the resilience
and sustainability of your project, making it less dependent on any
single individual and enhancing its overall robustness.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Reproducible reports and notebooks</h2>
<p>The development of reproducible reports using notebooks, whether R

notebooks seamlessly blend explanatory text, code, and output, including
tables and visualizations, providing others with the means to thoroughly
understand and replicate an analysis at the click of a button <span

<p>Robust tools like R notebooks or Jupyter notebooks provide a
comprehensive framework for transparently documenting all code-based
data processing and analytic steps in a research project. Notebooks
enable the documentation of scripted workflows, capturing both the code
and its corresponding outputs in their raw, un-rendered format (see the
raw, un-rendered notebook). Once transformed into formats such as HTML,
DOCX, or PDF files (see the rendered notebook), these notebooks
facilitate easy sharing with other researchers, ensuring accessibility

<div id="version-control" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Version control</h2>
<p>Implementing version control systems, such as Git, helps track
changes in code and data over time. The primary issue that version
control applications address is the dependency of analyses on specific
versions of software applications. What may have worked and produced a
desired outcome with one version of a piece of software may no longer
work with another version. Thus, keeping track of versions of software
packages is crucial for sustainable reproducibility. Additionally,
version control extends to tracking different versions of reports or
analytic steps, particularly in collaborative settings <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blischak2016quick">Blischak, Davenport,
and Wilson 2016</a>)</span>. Version control facilitates collaboration
by allowing researchers to revert to previous versions if necessary and
provides an audit trail of the data processing, analysis, and reporting
steps. It enhances transparency by capturing the evolution of the
research project. Version control systems, such as Git, can be utilized
to track code changes and facilitate collaboration <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blischak2016quick">Blischak, Davenport,
and Wilson 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/gitlogo.png" width="30%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>RStudio has built-in version control and also allows direct
connection of projects to GitHub repositories. GitHub is a web-based
platform and service that provides a collaborative environment for
software development projects. It offers version control using Git, a
distributed version control system, allowing developers to track changes
to their code, collaborate with others, and manage projects efficiently.
GitHub also provides features such as issue tracking, code review, and
project management tools, making it a popular choice for both individual
developers and teams working on software projects.</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing resources (such as notebooks, code, annotation
schemes, additional reports, etc.) on repositories like GitHub (<a
href="https://github.com/" class="uri">https://github.com/</a>) <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-beer2018introducing">Beer

thereby ensuring that the research remains available for future analysis
and verification. By openly sharing research materials on platforms like
GitHub, researchers enable others to access and scrutinize their work,
thereby promoting transparency and reproducibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="digital-object-identifier-doi-and-persistent-identifier-pid"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Persistent
identifier (PiD)</h2>
<p>Once you’ve completed your project, help make your research data
discoverable, accessible and possibly re-usable using a PiD such as a
DOI! A <a href="https://www.doi.org/">Digital Object Identifier
(DOI)</a> is a unique alphanumeric string assigned by either a
publisher, organisation or agency that identifies content and provides a
PERSISTENT link to its location on the internet, whether the object is
digital or physical. It might look something like this <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/01/4F8E15A1B4D89"
class="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/01/4F8E15A1B4D89</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/doi.png" width="20%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>DOIs are also considered a type of persistent identifiers (PiDs). An
identifier is any label used to name some thing uniquely (whether
digital or physical). URLs are an example of an identifier. So are
serial numbers, and personal names. A persistent identifier is
guaranteed to be managed and kept up to date over a defined time
period.</p>
<p>Journal publishers assign DOIs to electronic copies of individual
articles. DOIs can also be assigned by an organisation, research
institutes or agencies and are generally managed by the relevant
organisation and relevant policies. DOIs not only uniquely identify
research data collections, it also supports citation and citation
metrics.</p>
<p>A DOI will also be given to any data set published in UQ eSpace,
whether added manually or uploaded from <a
href="https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm">UQ RDM</a>. For information
on how cite data, have a look <a

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DOIs are a persistent identifier and as such carry expectations
of curation, persistent access and rich metadata</p></li>
<li><p>DOIs can be created for DATA SETS and associated outputs
(e.g. grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc) - DOIs for
data are equivalent with DOIs for other scholarly publications</p></li>
<li><p>DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both
metrics and altmetrics)</p></li>

<div id="optimizing-r-workflows" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Optimizing R
Workflows</h1>
<p>While most researchers in the language sciences are somewhat familiar
with R, workshops focusing on specific tasks, such as statistical
analyses in R, are increasingly common. However, workshops dedicated to
general proficiency in R are rare.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/rstudiologo.png" width="40%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>When discussing ‘working in R,’ I refer to concerns surrounding
reproducible and efficient workflows, session management, and adherence
to formatting conventions for R code. The subsequent sections will offer
guidance on optimizing workflows and enhancing research practices to
foster transparency, efficiency, and reproducibility.</p>
<div id="rproj" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Rproj</h2>
<p>If you’re utilizing RStudio, you can create a new R project, which is
essentially a working directory identified by a <code>.RProj</code>
file. When you open a project (either through ‘File/Open Project’ in
RStudio or by double-clicking on the <code>.RProj</code> file outside of
R), the working directory is automatically set to the location of the
<code>.RProj</code> file.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/rproj.png" width="40%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>I highly recommend creating a new R Project at the outset of each
research endeavor. Upon creating a new R project, promptly organize your
directory by establishing folders to house your R code, data files,
notes, and other project-related materials. This can be done outside of
R on your computer or within the Files window of RStudio. For instance,
consider creating a ‘R’ folder for your R code and a ‘data’ folder for
your datasets.</p>
<p>Prior to adopting R Projects, I used <code>setwd()</code> to set my
working directory. However, this method has drawbacks as it requires
specifying an absolute file path, which can lead to broken scripts and
hinder collaboration and reproducibility efforts. Consequently, reliance
on <code>setwd()</code> impedes the sharing and transparency of analyses
and projects. By contrast, utilizing R Projects streamlines workflow
management and facilitates reproducibility and collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div id="folder-structure" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Folder structure</h2>
<p>Like with all (project) folders, it is recommendable to use a common
folder structure as to make it easier to find information or particular
files.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Solving dependency issues: renv</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/renv.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>The <code>renv</code> package introduces a novel approach to
enhancing the independence of R projects by eliminating external
dependencies. By creating a dedicated library within your project,
<code>renv</code> ensures that your R project operates autonomously from
your personal library. Consequently, when sharing your project, the
associated packages are automatically included.</p>
<p><code>renv</code> aims to provide a robust and stable alternative to
the <code>packrat</code> package, which, in my experience, fell short of
expectations. Having utilized <code>renv</code> myself, I found it to be
user-friendly and reliable. Although the initial generation of the local
library may require some time, it seamlessly integrates into workflows
without causing any disruptions. Overall, <code>renv</code> is highly
recommended for simplifying the sharing of R projects, thereby enhancing
transparency and reproducibility.</p>
<p>One of <code>renv</code>’s core principles is to preserve existing
workflows, ensuring that they function as before while effectively
isolating the R dependencies of your project, including package
versioning.</p>
<p>For more information on <code>renv</code> and its functionalities, as
well as guidance on its implementation, refer to the <a

<h2 class="unnumbered">Version Control with Git</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/gitgithub.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p><strong>Getting started with Git</strong></p>
<p>To connect your Rproject with GitHub, <strong>you need to have Git
installed</strong> (if you have not yet downloaded and installed Git,
simply search for <code>download git</code> in your favorite search
engine and follow the instructions) and <strong>you need to have a
GitHub account</strong>. If you do not have a GitHub account, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYTifWe6M8I">here</a> is a video
tutorial showing how you can do this. If you have trouble with this, you
can also check out <em>Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</em> at
<code>happygitwithr.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/gitdownload.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Just as a word of warning: when I set up my connection to Git and
GitHUb things worked very differently, so things may be a bit different
on your machine. In any case, I highly recommend <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5_v5f6128M">this YouTube
tutorial</a> which shows how to connect to Git and GitHub using the
<code>usethis</code> package or <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL6L2MNqPHg&amp;t=716s">this,
slightly older, YouTube tutorial</a> on how to get going with Git and
GitHub when working with RStudio.</p>
<p><strong>Old school</strong></p>
<p>While many people use the <code>usethis</code> package to connect
RStudio to GitHub, I still use a somewhat <em>old school</em> way to
connect my projects with GitHub. I have decided to show you how to
connect RStudio to GitHub using this method, as I actually think it is
easier once you have installed Git and created a gitHub account.</p>
<p>Before you can use Git with R, you need to tell RStudio that you want
to use Git. To do this, go to <code>Tools</code>, then
<code>Global Options</code> and then to <code>Git/SVN</code> and make
sure that the box labeled
<code>Enable version control interface for RStudio projects.</code> is
checked. You need to then browse to the Git executable file (for
Window’s users this is called the <code>Git.exe</code> file).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/globaloptionsr.png" width="40%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, we can connect our project to Git (not to GitHub yet). To do
this, go to <code>Tools</code>, then to <code>Project Options...</code>
and in the <code>Git/SVN</code> tab, change
<code>Version Control System</code> to <code>Git</code> (from
<code>None</code>). Once you have accepted these changes, a new tab
called <code>Git</code> appears in the upper right pane of RStudio
(<em>you may need to / be asked to restart RStudio at this point</em>).
You can now commit files and changes in files to Git.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/globaloptionsgit.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>To commit files, go to the Git tab and check the boxes next to the
files you would like to commit (this is called <em>staging</em>; meaning
that these files are now ready to be committed). Then, click on
<code>Commit</code> and enter a message in the pop-up window that
appears. Finally, click on the <code>commit</code> button under the
message window.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting your Rproj with GitHub</strong></p>
<p>To integrate your R project with GitHub, start by navigating to your
GitHub page and create a new repository (repo). You can name it anything
you like; for instance, let’s call it <code>test</code>. To create a new
repository on GitHub, simply click on the <code>New</code> icon and then
select <code>New Repository</code>. While creating the repository, I
recommend checking the option to ‘Add a README’, where you can provide a
brief description of the contents, although it’s not mandatory.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created the GitHub repo, the next step is to connect it
to your local computer. This is achieved by ‘cloning’ the repository.
Click on the green <code>Code</code> icon on your GitHub repository
page, and from the dropdown menu that appears, copy the URL provided
under the <code>clone with HTTPS</code> section.</p>
<p>Now, open your terminal (located between <code>Console</code> and
<code>Jobs</code> in RStudio) and navigate to the directory where you
want to store your project files. Use the <code>cd</code> command to
change directories if needed. Once you’re in the correct directory,
include the URL you copied from the git repository after the command
<code>git remote add origin</code>. This sets up the connection between
your local directory and the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Next, execute the command <code>git branch -M main</code> to rename
the default branch to <code>main</code>. This step is necessary to align
with recent changes in GitHub’s naming conventions, merging the previous
<code>master</code> and <code>main</code> branches.</p>
<p>Finally, push your local files to the remote GitHub repository by
using the command <code>git push -u origin main</code>. This command
uploads your files to GitHub, making them accessible to collaborators
and ensuring version control for your project.</p>
<p>Following these steps ensures seamless integration between your R
project and GitHub, facilitating collaboration, version control, and
project management.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># initiate the upstream tracking of the project on the GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHUbUserName/YouGitHubRepositoryName.git
# set main as main branch (rather than master)
git branch -M main
# push content to main
git push -u origin main</code></pre>
<p>We can then commit changes and push them to the remote GitHub
repo.</p>
<p>You can then go to your GitHub repo and check if the documents that
we pushed are now in the remote repo.</p>
<p>From now on, you can simply commit all changes that you make to the
GitHub repo associated with that Rproject. Other projects can, of
course, be connected and push to other GitHub repos.</p>
</div>
<div id="solving-path-issues-here" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Solving path issues: here</h2>
<p>The primary objective of the here package is to streamline file
referencing within project-oriented workflows. Unlike the conventional
approach of using setwd(), which is susceptible to fragility and heavily
reliant on file organization, here leverages the top-level directory of
a project to construct file paths effortlessly.</p>
<p>This approach significantly enhances the robustness of your projects,
ensuring that file paths remain functional even if the project is
relocated or accessed from a different computer. Moreover, the here
package mitigates compatibility issues when transitioning between
different operating systems, such as Mac and Windows, which
traditionally require distinct path specifications.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># define path
example_path_full &lt;- &quot;D:\\Uni\\Konferenzen\\ISLE\\ISLE_2021\\isle6_reprows/repro.Rmd&quot;
# show path
example_path_full</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;D:\\Uni\\Konferenzen\\ISLE\\ISLE_2021\\isle6_reprows/repro.Rmd&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>here</code> package, the path starts in folder where
the Rproj file is. As the Rmd file is in the same folder, we only need
to specify the Rmd file and the <code>here</code> package will add the
rest.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load package
library(here)
# define path using here
example_path_here &lt;- here::here(&quot;repro.Rmd&quot;)
#show path
example_path_here</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;F:/data recovery/Uni/UQ/SLC/LADAL/SLCLADAL.github.io/repro.Rmd&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="reproducible-randomness-set.seed"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Reproducible randomness: set.seed</h2>
<p>The <code>set.seed</code> function in R sets the seed of R‘s random
number generator, which is useful for creating simulations or random
objects that can be reproduced. This means that when you call a function
that uses some form of randomness (e.g. when using random forests),
using the <code>set.seed</code> function allows you to replicate
results.</p>
<p>Below is an example of what I mean. First, we generate a random
sample from a vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>numbers &lt;- 1:10
randomnumbers1 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers1</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  6  9  1  8  2 10  7  3  5  4</code></pre>
<p>We now draw another random sample using the same <code>sample</code>
call.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>randomnumbers2 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers2</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  3  2  7  1  8  4  6 10  9  5</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we now have a different string of numbers although we
used the same call. However, when we set the seed and then generate a
string of numbers as show below, we create a reproducible random
sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123)
randomnumbers3 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers3</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  3 10  2  8  6  9  1  7  5  4</code></pre>
<p>To show that we can reproduce this sample, we call the same seed and
then generate another random sample which will be the same as the
previous one because we have set the seed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123)
randomnumbers4 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers4</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  3 10  2  8  6  9  1  7  5  4</code></pre>

<p>Table 3 should be the easiest to parse and understand. This is so
because only Table 3 is <em>tidy</em>. Unfortunately, however, most data
that you will encounter will be untidy. There are two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most people aren’t familiar with the principles of tidy data, and
it’s hard to derive them yourself unless you spend a lot of time working
with data.</p></li>
<li><p>Data is often organised to facilitate some use other than
analysis. For example, data is often organised to make entry as easy as
possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that for most real analyses, you’ll need to do some
tidying. The first step is always to figure out what the variables and
observations are. Sometimes this is easy; other times you’ll need to
consult with the people who originally generated the data. The second
step is to resolve one of two common problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One variable might be spread across multiple columns.</p></li>
<li><p>One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid structuring in ways that make it harder to parse, there are
three interrelated principles which make a data set tidy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each variable must have its own column.</p></li>
<li><p>Each observation must have its own row.</p></li>
<li><p>Each value must have its own cell.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional advantage of tidy data is that is can be transformed
more easily into any other format when needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-minimize-storage-space"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">How to minimize storage space</h2>
<p>Most people use or rely on data that comes in spreadsheets and use
software such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc. However,
spreadsheets produced by these software applications take up a lot of
storage space.</p>
<p>One way to minimize the space, that your data takes up, is to copy
the data and paste it into a simple editor or txt-file. The good thing
about txt files is that they take up only very little space and they can
be viewed easily so that you can open the file to see what the data
looks like. You could then delete the spread sheet because you can copy
and paste the content of the txt file right back into a spread sheet
when you need it.</p>
<p>If you work with R, you may also consider to save your data as .rda
files which is a very efficient way to save and story data in an R
environment</p>
<p>Below is an example for how you can load, process, and save your data
as .rda in RStudio.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load data
lmm &lt;- read.delim(&quot;https://slcladal.github.io/data/lmmdata.txt&quot;, header = TRUE)
# convert strings to factors
lmm &lt;- lmm %&gt;%
  mutate(Genre = factor(Genre),
         Text = factor(Text),
         Region = factor(Region))
# save data
base::saveRDS(lmm, file = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;lmm_out.rda&quot;))
# remove lmm object
rm(lmm)
# load .rda data
lmm  &lt;- base::readRDS(file = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;lmm_out.rda&quot;))
# or from web
lmm  &lt;- base::readRDS(url(&quot;https://slcladal.github.io/data/lmm.rda&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;))
# inspect data
str(lmm)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    537 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ Date        : int  1736 1711 1808 1878 1743 1908 1906 1897 1785 1776 ...
##  $ Genre       : Factor w/ 16 levels &quot;Bible&quot;,&quot;Biography&quot;,..: 13 4 10 4 4 4 3 9 9 3 ...
##  $ Text        : Factor w/ 271 levels &quot;abott&quot;,&quot;albin&quot;,..: 2 6 12 16 17 20 20 24 26 27 ...
##  $ Prepositions: num  166 140 131 151 146 ...
##  $ Region      : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;North&quot;,&quot;South&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...</code></pre>
<p>To compare, the <code>lmmdata.txt</code> requires 19.2KB while the
<code>lmmdata.rda</code> only requires 5.2KB (and only 4.1KB with
<em>xz</em> compression). If stored as an Excel spreadsheet, the same
file requires 28.6KB.</p>

<div id="generating-interactive-notebooks" class="section level1"

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Generating interactive
notebooks</h1>
<p>In this section of the tutorial, we delve into the creation of
interactive notebooks. These notebooks are generated from a GitHub
repository using a template provided by the <em>Australian Text
Analytics Platform</em> (ATAP) and the <em>Language Data Commons of
Australia</em> (LDaCA).</p>
<p>The transformation from a static to an interactive notebook involves
Dockerizing the GitHub repository, essentially creating a virtual
machine based on the repository’s specified parameters. Subsequently,
the interactive notebook is loaded into a Binder workspace, enabling
others to interact with copies of your notebook. Once a session
concludes, the copy of the notebook is closed, although you have the
option to save a copy at any point.</p>
<p>Interactive notebooks serve various purposes, including rendering
one’s work transparently or sharing analyses with reviewers. They
accommodate both quantitative statistical and qualitative interpretative
work.</p>
<p>Notably, interactive notebooks empower others to execute and edit
your code, facilitating data and analysis validation.</p>
<p>Before generating an interactive notebook, ensure you have three
essential components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An R project containing an Rmd file.</li>
<li>An Rmd file named <em>rmd2jupyter.Rmd</em>.</li>
<li>A GitHub account.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Rmd file should utilize only one programming language, such as R,
Python, or Julia, without mixing languages. Additionally, all necessary
resources, such as data, should be accessible within the GitHub
repository. It’s highly recommended to generate interactive notebooks
only once a project or analysis is complete.</p>
<p>Now, let’s proceed with the process of generating an interactive
notebook.</p>
<div id="preparation-of-the-rmd" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Preparation of the Rmd</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Begin by duplicating the Rmd file. A simple convention is to
append “_cb” to the filename, indicating that this version will be
converted into an interactive notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike R Notebooks, interactive Jupyter notebooks do not utilize
a YAML metadata header. Consequently, remove the YAML metadata header
from the duplicated Rmd file and replace it with a first-level header to
denote the notebook’s title. It’s advisable to adjust all headers in the
Rmd file to maintain the original structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a separate script file to list all required packages for
installation. Remove any code chunks responsible for installing
packages, as Jupyter notebooks have limited options for hiding code
chunks.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="converting-your-rmd-into-a-jupyter-notebook"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Converting your Rmd into a Jupyter notebook</h2>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open the “rmd2jupyter.Rmd” file and proceed to install and activate
the “rmd2jupyter” package, which contains the necessary function for Rmd
to Jupyter conversion. Since this package isn’t available via CRAN,
utilize the “devtools” package for installation.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(&quot;mkearney/rmd2jupyter&quot;)
library(rmd2jupyter)</code></pre>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once the “rmd2jupyter” package is activated, use the “rmd2jupyter”
function to convert the Rmd file to a Jupyter notebook.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Convert one notebook
rmd2jupyter::rmd2jupyter(here::here(&quot;acvqainter_cb.Rmd&quot;))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-github-repository-that-connects-to-binder"
class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Creating a GitHub repository that connects to
Binder</h2>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Log in to your GitHub account and visit: <a
href="https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/r-binder-template">https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/r-binder-template</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the GitHub page, click on <em>Use this template</em> and
select <em>Create a new repository</em> from the dropdown menu. Assign a
name to the repository and optionally provide a brief
description.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the “install.R” file and specify the packages to be
pre-installed by adding commands like <em>install.packages(“dplyr”)</em>
on separate lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload your Jupyter notebook by selecting <em>Upload file</em>
from the drop-down menu. Additionally, if you need to create folders,
create a dummy file first and specify its location as a
subfolder.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once all required packages, the Jupyter notebook, and any necessary
data files are uploaded, initiate the notebook by following the provided
link. Adapt the URL to point to your interactive notebook by adjusting
the username, repository name, and notebook filename.</p>
<p>Alternatively, consider uploading your Jupyter notebook to Google
Colab for sharing. However, note that Google Colab may terminate
sessions if computations take too long or exceed resource limits.</p>
<p>Please anticipate an extended setup time for the interactive
notebook’s first launch, as Docker image creation from the GitHub
repository may take up to an hour for complex notebooks with numerous
dependencies. Simpler notebooks typically start faster but may still
require at least 10 minutes for the initial setup.</p>

<li><p>Clone your new repo in RStudio via <em>File</em> -&gt; <em>New
Project</em> -&gt; <em>Version Control</em> -&gt; <em>Git</em>. Paste
the link from the previous step in the Repository URL box.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>index.Rmd</code>, replace “YOUR TITLE HERE” with your
title.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>index.Rmd</code>, replace “YOUR NAMES HERE” with your
names.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>_bookdown.yml</code>, replace “YOUR GITHUB USERNAME”
with your GitHub username in the two instances.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>_bookdown.yml</code>, replace “YOUR GITHUB REPO” with
your GitHub repo name in the two instances. Note that steps 3 and 4
provide links to the <code>.Rmd</code> files of your project for editing
and viewing. Update these file paths if you move your <code>.Rmd</code>
files. Once your book is rendered, test that the edit (pen) and view
(eye) buttons work.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>_output.yml</code>, change “YOUR SHORT TITLE” to a
shortened version of your title. Leave the “after:” line indicating that
the book was published with bookdown unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>Install <strong>bookdown</strong> with
<code>install.packages("bookdown")</code>. If you already have it,
update to the latest version.</p></li>
<li><p>Render locally with
<code>bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")</code> or by clicking the
<em>Build book</em> button in the Build tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>browseURL("docs/index.html")</code> to view your book
locally or open <code>index.html</code> in a browser.</p></li>
<li><p>If everything looks good, commit and push all changed files to
GitHub. Note that you’ll need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you
wish to update the online book.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit README (GitHub or RStudio): Once you’ve completed these
steps, delete the content of this <strong>README</strong> and add a
brief description of your project with a link to the book URL.</p></li>
