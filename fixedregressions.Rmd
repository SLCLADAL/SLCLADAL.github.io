# Introduction

This section focuses on fixed-effects regression modeling using "R". The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/fixedregressionsscript.r).

Regression models are among the most widely used methods in data analysis because they are:

* multivariate and can thus incorporate many predictors in a single model (which allows to test the impact of one predictor while all other predictors in the model remain controlled)
* extremely flexible and and can be fitted to different types of predictors and dependend variables
* provide output that can be easily interpreted
* conceptually relative simple and not overly complex froma  mathematical perspective

Fixed-effects regression models are simple additive models which means that the predicted values represent the intercept value plus the effects of the individual predictors while mixed-effects models are based on more complex matrix multiplications where predicted values represent the product of the random effect multiplied by the intercept values plus the effects of the fixed effects. "R" offers a various ready-made functions with which implemneting different types of regression models is very easy.

In the following, we will go over the most relevant and frequently used types of regression models:
* multiple linear regression
* multiple binomial logistic regression
* ordinal regression
* Poissant regression
* robust regression

The major difference between these types of models is that they take different types of dependent variables: linear regressions take numeric , logistic regressions take nominal variables, ordinal regressions take ordinal variables, and Poissant regressions take dependent variables that reflect counts of (rare) events. Robust regression, in contrast, is a simple multiple linear regression that is able to handle outliers due to a weighing procedure.

# Preparation and session set up

Since all examples will be performed in "R", it is necessary to install "R", "RStudio", and "Tinn-R". If these programms (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not already installed on your machine, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain "libraries" or "packages" need to be installed so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the librariesby running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the libraries mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary libraries, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("boot", "car", "effects", "ggplot2",
                   "Hmisc", "languageR", "lme4", "mlogit",
                   "msm", "plyr", "QuantPsyc", "RLRsim", "rms",
                   "sandwich", "sjPlot", "visreg"))
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Multiple Linear Regression

In contrast to simple linear regression, which estimates the effect of a single predictor, multiple linear regression estimates the effect of various predictor (cf. equation (\ref{eq:mlr})). A multiple linear regression can thus test the effects of various predictors simultaneously.

\begin{equation}

f_{(x)} = \alpha + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \beta_{2}x_{i+1} + \dots + \beta_{n}x_{i+n} + \epsilon

\end{equation}

There exists a wealth of literature focusing on multiple linear regressions and the concepts it is based on.  For instance, there are [@achen1982interpreting], [@bortz2006statistik], [@crawley2005statistics], [@faraway2002practical], [@field2012discovering] (my personal favourite), and [@wilcox2009basic] to name just a few. Introductions to regression modelling in "R" are [@baayen2008analyzing], [@crawley2012r], or [@gries2009statistics].

The model diagnostics we are dealing with here are partly identical to the diagnostic methods discussed in the section on simple linear regression. Because of this overlap, diagnostics will only be described in more detail if they have not been described in the section on simple linear regression.

A brief note on minimum necessary sample or data set size appears necessary here. Although there appears to be a general assumption that 25 data points per group are sufficient, this is not necessarily correct (it is merely a general rule of thumb that is actually often incorrect). Such rules of thumb are inadequate because the required sample size depends on the number of variables in a given model, the size of the effect and the variance of the effect. If a model contains many variables, then this requires a larger sample size than a model which only uses very few predictors. Also, to detect an effect with a very minor effect size, one needs a substantially larger sample compared to cases where the effect is very strong. In fact, when dealing with small effects, model require a minimum of 600 cases to reliably detect these effects. Finally, effects that very robust and do not vary much require a much smaller sample size compared with effects that are spurious and vary substantially. Since the sample size depends on the effect size and variance as well as the number of variables, there is no final one-size-fits-all answer to what the best sample size is.

Another, slightly better but still incorrect, rule of thumb is that the more data, the better. This is not correct because models based on too many cases are prone for overfitting and thus report correlations as being significant that are not. However, given that there are procedures that can correct for overfitting, larger data sets are still preferable to data sets that are simply too small to warrant reliable results. In conclusion, it remains true that the sample size depends on the effect under investigation.

Despite there being no ultimate rule of thumb, @field2012discovering 273-275), based on @green1991many, provide data-driven suggestions for the minimal size of data required for regression models that aim to find medium sized effects (k = number of predictors; categorical variables with more than two levels should be transformed into dummy variables):

* If one is merely interested in the overall model fit (something I have not encountered), then the sample size should be at least 50 + k (k = number of predictors in model).
*  If one is only interested in the effect of specific variables, then the sample size should be at least 104 + k (k = number of predictors in model).
*  If one is only interested in both model fit and the effect of specific variables, then the sample size should be at least the higher value of 50 + k or 104 + k (k = number of predictors in model).

You will see in the "R"-code below that there is already a function that tests whether the sample size is sufficient.

## Example: Gifts and Availability

The example we will go through here is taken from @field2012discovering. In this example, the research question is if the money that men spend on presents for women depends on the women's attractiveness and their relationship status. To answer this research question, we will implement a multiple linear regression and start by preparing the "R"-session (cleaning the workspace, setting options necessary, installing and activating necessary packages, and loading functions).

```{r mlr1, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(QuantPsyc)
library(boot)
# load functions
source("rscripts/multiplot_ggplot2.r")
source("rscripts/mlinr.summary.r")
source("rscripts/SampleSizeMLR.r")
source("rscripts/ExpR.r")
```

After preparing the session, we can now load the data and inspect its structure and properties.

```{r mlr2, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
mlrdata <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mlrdata.txt", header = TRUE)
head(mlrdata)    # inspect first 6 lines
str(mlrdata)     # inspect structure
summary(mlrdata) # summarize data
```

The data set consist of three variables stored in three columns. The first column contains the relationship status of the women, the second whether the man is interested in the woman, and the third column represents the money spend on the present. The data set represents 100 cases and the mean amount of money spend on a present is 88.38 dollars. In a next step, we visualize the data to get a more detailed impression of the relationships between variables.

```{r mlr3, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create plot
# plot 1
p1 <- ggplot(mlrdata,                   # def. data
             aes(status, money)) +      # def. x/y-axes
  geom_boxplot(fill=c("gold", "indianred4")) + # def. col.
  theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 8))+   # black and white theme
  labs(x = "") +                        # x-axis label
  labs(y = "Money spent on present (AUD)", cex = .75) +   # y-axis label
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 250)) +   # y-axis range
  guides(fill = FALSE) +                # no legend
  ggtitle("Status")                     # title
# plot 2
p2 <- ggplot(mlrdata,
             aes(attraction, money)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill=c("grey30", "grey70")) +
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 8))+
  labs(x = "") +                              # x-axis label
  labs(y = "Money spent on present (AUD)") +  # y-axis label
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 250)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Attraction")
# plot 3
p3 <- ggplot(mlrdata,
             aes(x = money)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),    # add density statistic
                 binwidth = 10,         # def. bin width
                 colour = "black",      # def. bar edge colour
                 fill = "white") +      # def. bar col.
    theme_bw() +                        # black-white theme
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill = "#FF6666") # def. col. of overlay
# plot 4
p4 <- ggplot(mlrdata, aes(status, money)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = F, aes(fill = factor(status))) + # create boxplot
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1") +   # def. col. palette
  facet_wrap(~ attraction, nrow = 1) +  # separate panels for attraction
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 8)) +
  labs(x = "") +
  labs(y = "Money spent on present (Euro)") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 250)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
# show plots
multiplot(p1, p3, p2, p4, cols = 2)
```

The upper left figure consists of a boxplot which shows how much money was spent based on the relationship status of the moan. The figure suggests that men spend more on women who are not in a relationship. The next figure shows the relationship between the money spend on presents and whether or not the men were interested in the women.

The boxplot in the upper right panel suggests that men spend substantially more on women if the men are interested in them. The next figure depicts the distribution of the amounts of money spend on women. In addition, the figure indicates the existence of two outliers (dots in the boxplot)

The histogram in the lower left panel shows that, although the mean amount of money spent on presents is 88.38 dollars, the distribution peaks around 50 dollars indicating that on average, men spend about 50 dollars on presents. Finally, we will plot the amount of money spend on presents against relationship status by attraction in order to check whether the money spent on presents is affected by an interaction between attraction and relationship status.

The boxplot in the lower right panel confirms the existence of an interaction (a non-additive term) as men only spend more money on single women if the men are interested in the women. If men are not interested in the women, then the relationship has no effect as they spend an equal amount of money on the women regardless of whether they are in a relationship or not.

We will now start to implement the regression model. In a first step, we initialize four base-line models: two minimal base-line models that only use the intercept as their sole predictor and two saturated base-line models that contain all possible predictors. The model pairs are generated with the "lm" and the "glm" function as these functions offer different model parameters in their output.

```{r mlr4, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m0.mlr = lm(         # generate lm regression object
  money ~ 1,         # def. rgression formula (1 = intercept)
  data = mlrdata)    # def. data
m0.glm = glm(        # generate glm regression object
  money ~ 1,         # def. rgression formula (1 = intercept)
  family = gaussian, # def. linkage function
  data = mlrdata)    # def. data
m1.mlr = lm(         # generate lm regression object
  money ~ (status + attraction)^2, # def. rgression formula
  data = mlrdata)    # def. data
m1.glm = glm(        # generate glm regression object
  money ~ status * attraction,     # def. rgression formula
  family = gaussian, # def. linkage function
  data = mlrdata)    # def. data set
```

After generating the saturated base-line models we can now start with the model fitting. Model fitting refers to a process that aims at find the model that explains a maximum of variance with a minimum of predictors [cf. @field2012discovering 318]. Model fitting is therefore based on the *principle of parsimony* which is related to Occam's razor according to which explanations that require fewer assumptions are more likely to be true.

## Automatic Model Fitting

In this section, we will use a step-wise step-down procedure that uses decreases in AIC (Akaike information criterion) as the criterion to minimize the model in a step-wise manner. This procedure aims at finding the model with the lowest AIC values by evaluating - step-by-step - whether the removal of a predictor (term) leads to a lower AIC value.

The AIC is calculated using the equation below. The lower the AIC value, the better the balance between explained variance and the number of predictors. AIC values can and should only be compared for models that are fit on the same dataset with the same (number of) cases ($LL$ stands for LogLikelihood and $k$ represents the number of predictors in the model).

\begin{equation}

-2LL + 2k
\label{eq:aic}

\end{equation}

Interactions are evaluated first and only if all interactions have been removed would the procedure start removing main effects. Other model fitting procedures (forced entry, step-wise step up, hierarchical) are discussed during the implementation of other regression models. We cannot discuss all procedures here as model fitting is rather complex and a discussion of even the most common procedures would to lengthy and time consuming at this point. It is important to note though that there is not perfect model fitting procedure and automated approaches should be handled with care as they are likely to ignore violations of model parameters that can be detected during manual - but time consuming - model fitting procedures. As a general rule of thumb, it is advisable to fit models as carefully and deliberately as possible. We will now begin to fit the model.

```{r mlr5, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# automated AIC based model fitting
step(m1.mlr, direction = "both")
```

The automated model fitting procedure informs us that removing predictors ahs not caused a decrease in the AIC. The saturated model is thus also the final minimal adequate model. We will now inspect the final minimal model and go over the model report.

```{r mlr6, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m2.mlr = lm(                       # generate lm regression object
  money ~ (status + attraction)^2, # def. regression formula
  data = mlrdata)                  # def. data
m2.glm = glm(                      # generate glm regression object
  money ~ (status + attraction)^2, # def. regression formula
  family = gaussian,               # def. linkage function
  data = mlrdata)                  # def. data
# inspect final minimal model
summary(m2.mlr)
```

The first element of the report is called *Call* and it reports the regression formula of the model. Then, the report provides the residual distribution (the range, median and quartiles of the residuals) which allows drawing inferences about the distribution of differences between observed and expected values. If the residuals are distributed unevenly, then this is a strong indicator that the model is unstable and unreliable because mathematical assumptions on which the model is based are violated.

Next, the model summary reports the most important part: a table with model statistics of the fixed-effects structure of the model. The table contains the estimates (coefficients of the predictors), standard errors, t-values, and the p-values which show whether a predictor significantly correlates with the dependent variable that the model investigates.

All main effects (status and attraction) as well as the interaction between status and attraction is reported as being significantly correlated with the dependent variable (money). An interaction occurs if a correlation between the dependent variable and a predictor is affect by another predictor.

The top most term is called intercept and has a value of 99.15 which represents the base estimate to which all other estimates refer. To exemplify what this means, let us consider what the model would predict a man would spend on a present for a women who is single but the man is not attracted to her: The amount he would spend (based on the model would be 99.15 dollars (the intercept) plus 57.69 dollars (because she is single)  minus 47.66 dollars (because he is not interested in her) minus 63.18 dollars because of the interaction between status and attraction.

```{r mlr7, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#intercept  Single  NotInterested  Single:NotInterested
99.15     + 57.69  + 0           + 0     # 156.8 single + interested
99.15     + 57.69  - 47.66       - 63.18 # 46.00 single + not interested
99.15     - 0      + 0           - 0     # 99.15 relationship + interested
99.15     - 0      - 47.66       - 0     # 51.49 relationship + not interested
```

Interestingly, the model predicts that a man would invest even less money in a woman that he is not interested in if she were single compared to being in a relationship! We can derive the same results easier using the "predict" function.

```{r mlr8, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# make prediction based on the model for original data
prediction <- predict(m2.mlr, newdata = mlrdata)
# inspect predictions
table(round(prediction,2))
```

Below the table of coefficient, the summary reports model statistics that provide information about how well the model performs. The difference between the values and the values in the coefficients table is that the model statistics refer to the model as a whole rather than focusing on individual predictors.

The multiple R^2^-value is a measure of how much variance the model explains. A multiple R^2^-value of 0 would inform us that the model does not explain any variance while a value of .852 mean that the model explains 85.2 percent of the variance. A value of 1 would inform us that the model explains 100 percent of the variance and that the predictions of the model match the observed values perfectly. Multiplying the multiple R^2^-value thus provides the percentage of explained variance. Models that have a multiple R^2^-value equal or higher than .05 are deemed substantially significant [ cf @szmrecsanyi2006morphosyntactic 55]. It has been claimed that models should explain a minimum of 5 percent of variance but this is problematic as itis not uncommon for models to have very low explanatory power while still performing significantly and systematically better than chance. In addition, the total amount of variance is negligible in cases where one is interested in very weak but significant effects. It is much more important for model to perform significantly better than minimal base-line models because if this is not the case, then the model does not have any predictive and therefore no explanatory power.

The adjusted R^2^-value considers the amount of explained variance in light of the number of predictors in the model (it is thus somewhat similar to the AIC and BIC) and informs about how well the model would perform if it were applied to the population that the sample is drawn from. Ideally, the difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value should be very small as this means that the model is not overfitted. If, however, the difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value is substantial, then this would strongly suggest that the model is instable and overfitted to the data while being inadequate for drawing inferences about the population. Differences between multiple and adjusted R^2^-values indicate that the data contains outliers that cause the distribution of the data on which the model is based to differ from the distributions that the model mathematically requires to provide reliable estimates. The difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value in our model is very small (85.2-84.7=.05) and should not cause concern.

Before continuing, we will calculate the confidence intervals of the coefficients.

```{r mlr9, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract confidence intervals of the coefficients
confint(m2.mlr)
# compare baseline- and minimal adequate model
anova(m0.mlr, m2.mlr)
```

Now, we compare the final minimal adequate model to the base-line model to test whether then final model significantly outperforms the baseline model.

```{r mlr10, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# compare baseline- and minimal adequate model
Anova(m0.mlr, m2.mlr, type = "III")
```

The comparison between the two model confirms that the minimal adequate model performs significantly better (makes significantly more accurate estimates of the outcome variable) compared with the baseline model.

## Outlier Detection

After implementing the multiple regression, we now need to look for outliers and perform the model diagnostics by testing whether removing data points disproportionately decreases model fit. To begin with, we generate diagnostic plots.

```{r mlr11, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# start plotting
par(mfrow = c(1, 4)) # display plots in 3 rows/2 columns
plot(m2.mlr)         # plot fitted values
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # restore original settings
```

```{r mlr12, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# determine a cutoff for data points that have D-values higher than 4/(n-k-1)
cutoff <- 4/((nrow(mlrdata)-length(m2.mlr$coefficients)-2))
# start plotting
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))           # display plots in 3 rows/2 columns
qqPlot(m2.mlr, main="QQ Plot") # create qq-plot
plot(m2.mlr, which=4, cook.levels = cutoff) # plot cook*s distance
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))           # restore original settings
```

The graphs indicate that data points 52, 64, and 83 may be problematic. We will therefore statistically evaluate whether these data points need to be removed. In order to find out which data points require removal, we extract the influence measure statistics and add them to out data set.

```{r mlr13, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract influence statistics
infl <- influence.measures(m2.mlr)
# add infl. statistics to data
mlrdata <- data.frame(mlrdata, infl[[1]], infl[[2]])
# annotate too influential data points
remove <- apply(infl$is.inf, 1, function(x) {
  ifelse(x == TRUE, return("remove"), return("keep")) } )
# add annotation to data
mlrdata <- data.frame(mlrdata, remove)
# number of rows before removing outliers
nrow(mlrdata)
# remove outliers
mlrdata <- mlrdata[mlrdata$remove == "keep", ]
# number of rows after removing outliers
nrow(mlrdata)
```

The difference in row in the data set before and after removing data points indicate that two data points which represented outliers have been removed.

## Rerun Regression

As we have a different data set now, we need to rerun the regression analysis. As the steps are identical to the regression analysis performed above, the steps will not be described in greater detail.

```{r mlr14, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# recreate regression models on new data
m0.mlr = lm(money ~ 1, data = mlrdata)
m0.glm = glm(money ~ 1, family = gaussian, data = mlrdata)
m1.mlr = lm(money ~ (status + attraction)^2, data = mlrdata)
m1.glm = glm(money ~ status * attraction, family = gaussian,
             data = mlrdata)
# automated AIC based model fitting
step(m1.mlr, direction = "both")
```


```{r mlr15, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create new final models
m2.mlr = lm(money ~ (status + attraction)^2, data = mlrdata)
m2.glm = glm(money ~ status * attraction, family = gaussian,
             data = mlrdata)
# inspect final minimal model
summary(m2.mlr)
```

```{r mlr16, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract confidence intervals of the coefficients
confint(m2.mlr)
```

```{r mlr17, eval = T, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# compare baseline with final model
anova(m0.mlr, m2.mlr)
```

```{r mlr18, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# compare baseline with final model
Anova(m0.mlr, m2.mlr, type = "III")
```

## Additional Model Diagnostics

After rerunning the regression analysis on the updated data set, we again create diagnostic plots in order to check whether there are potentially problematic data points.

```{r mlr19, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# start plotting
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # display plots in 2 rows/2 columns
plot(m2.mlr)         # plot fitted values
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # restore original settings
```



```{r mlr20, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# determine a cutoff for data points that have
# D-values higher than 4/(n-k-1)
cutoff <- 4/((nrow(mlrdata)-length(m2.mlr$coefficients)-2))
# start plotting
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))           # display plots in 1 row/2 columns
qqPlot(m2.mlr, main="QQ Plot") # create qq-plot
plot(m2.mlr, which=4, cook.levels = cutoff) # plot cook*s distance
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))           # restore original settings
```

Although the diagnostic plots indicate that additional points may be problematic, but these data points deviate substantially less from the trend than was the case with the data points that have already been removed. To make sure that retaining the data points that are deemed potentially problematic by the diagnostic plots, is acceptable, we extract diagnostic statistics and add them to the data.

```{r mlr21, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add model diagnostics to the data
mlrdata$residuals <- resid(m2.mlr)
mlrdata$standardized.residuals <- rstandard(m2.mlr)
mlrdata$studentized.residuals <- rstudent(m2.mlr)
mlrdata$cooks.distance <- cooks.distance(m2.mlr)
mlrdata$dffit <- dffits(m2.mlr)
mlrdata$leverage <- hatvalues(m2.mlr)
mlrdata$covariance.ratios <- covratio(m2.mlr)
mlrdata$fitted <- m2.mlr$fitted.values
```

We can now use these diagnostic statistics to create more precise diagnostic plots.

```{r mlr22, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot 5
p5 <- ggplot(mlrdata,
             aes(studentized.residuals)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 8))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),
                 binwidth = 1,
                 colour="black",
                 fill="white") +

The new diagnostic plots do not indicate outliers that require removal. With respect to such data points the following parameters should be considered:

* Data points with standardised residuals > 3.29 should be removed [@field2012discovering 269]

* If more than 1 percent of data points have standardized residuals exceeding values > 2.58, then the error rate of the model is inacceptable [@field2012discovering 269].

* If more than 5 percent of data points have standardized residuals exceeding values   > 1.96, then the error rate of the model is inacceptable [@field2012discovering 269]

* In addition, data points with Cook's D-values > 1 should be removed [@field2012discovering 269]

* Also, data points with leverage values $3(k + 1)/n$ (k = Number of predictors, N = Number of cases in model) should be removed [@field2012discovering 270]

* There should not be (any) autocorrelation among predictors. This means that independent variables cannot be correlated with itself (for instance, because data points come from the same subject). If there is autocorrelation among predictors, then a Repeated Measures Design or a (hierarchical) mixed-effects model should be implemented instead.

* Predictors cannot substantially correlate with each other (multicollinearity). If a model contains predictors that have variance inflation factors (VIF) > 10 the model is completely unreliable [@myers1990classical] and predictors causing such VIFs should be removed. Indeed, even VIFs of 2.5 can be problematic [@szmrecsanyi2006morphosyntactic 215] and [@zuur2010protocol] proposes that variables with VIFs exceeding 3 should be removed!

* Data points with 1/VIF values $<$ .1 must be removed (data points with values above .2 are considered problematic) [@menard1995applied].

* The mean value of VIFs should be $<$ 1 [@bowerman1990linear].

```

Except for the mean VIF value (2.307) which should not exceed 1, all diagnostics are acceptable. We will now test whether the sample size is sufficient for our model. With respect to the minimal sample size and based on [@green1991many], [@field2012discovering 273-274] offer the following rules of thumb  (k = number of predictors; categorical predictors with more than two levels should be recoded as dummy variables):

## Evaluation of Sample Size

After performing the diagnostics, we will now test whether the sample size is adequate and what the values of "R" would be based on a random distribution in order to be able to estimate how likely a $\beta$-error is given the present sample size [cf. @field2012discovering 274]. Beta errors (or $\beta$-errors) refer to the erroneous assumption that a predictor is not significant (based on the analysis and given the sample) although it does have an effect in the population. In other words, $\beta$-error means to overlook a significant effect because of weaknesses of the analysis. The test statistics ranges between 0 and 1 where lower values are better. If the values approximate 1, then there is serious concern as the model is not reliable given the sample size. In such cases, unfortunately, the best option is to increase the sample size.

```{r mlr24, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# check if sample size is sufficient
smplesz(m2.mlr)
# check beta-error likelihood
expR(m2.mlr)
```

The function "smplesz" reports that the sample size is insufficient by 9 data points according to [@green1991many]. The likelihood of $\beta$-errors, however, is very small (0.0309). As a last step, we summarize the results of the regression analysis.

```{r mlr25, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# tabulate regression results
mlrsummary <- mlr.summary(m2.mlr, m2.glm, ia = T)
# remove columns with confidence intervals
mlrsummary[,-c(4:5)]
```

Although [@field2012discovering] suggest that the main effects of the predictors involved in the interaction should not be interpreted, they are interpreted here to illustrate how the results of a multiple linear regression can be reported. Accordingly, the results of the regression analysis performed above can be summarized as follows:

A multiple linear regression was fitted to the data in a step-wise step-down, AIC-based (Akaike's Information Criterion) procedure to the data and arrived at a final minimal model. During the model diagnostics, two outliers were detected and removed. Further diagnostics did not find other issues after the removal.

The final minimal adequate regression model is based on 98 data points and performs highly significantly better than a minimal baseline model (Multiple R^2^: .857, Adjusted R^2^: .853, F-statistic (3, 94): 154.4, AIC: 850.4, BIC: 863.32, p<.001$***$). The final minimal adequate regression model reports *attraction* and *status* as significant main effects. The relationship status of women correlates highly significantly and positively with the amount of money spend on the women's presents (SE: 5.14, t-value: 10.87, p<.001$***$). This shows that men spend 156.8 dollars on presents are single while they spend 99,15 dollars if the women are in a relationship. Whether men are attracted to women also correlates highly significantly and positively with the money they spend on women (SE: 5.09, t-values: -9.37, p<.001$***$). If men are not interested in women, they spend 47.66 dollar less on a present for women compared with women the men are interested in.

Furthermore, the final minimal adequate regression model reports a highly significant interaction between relationship *status* and *attraction* (SE: 7.27, t-value: -8.18, p<.001$***$): If women are single but man are not interested in them, men spend 59.46 dollars less on their presents compared to all other constellations.

## Exercises

1.  Download the data "exdatamlr" from "https://slcladal.github.io/data/exdatamlr.txt" and apply what you have learned by implementing a multiple linear regression model so that you can answer how movement (move) and food intake (food) affect weight (given the data at hand).

# Multiple Binomial Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a multivariate analysis technique that builds on and is very similar in terms of its implementation to linear regression but logistic regressions take dependent variables that represent nominal rather than numeric scaling. The difference requires that the linear regression must be modified in certain ways to avoid producing non-sensical outcomes. The most fundamental difference between logistic and linear regressions is that logistic regression work on the probabilities of an outcome (the likelihood), rather than the outcome itself. In addition, the likelihoods on which the logistic regression works must be logged (logarithmized) in order to avoid produce predictions that produce values greater than 1 (instance occurs) and 0 (instance does not occur).

To understand what this mean, we will use a very simple example. In this example, we want to see whether the height of men affect their likelihood of being in a relationship. The data we use represents a data set consisting of two variables: height and relationship.

```{r blm1, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bodyheight=rnorm(20,180,10) # generates 20 values, with mean of 30 & s.d.=2
bodyheight=sort(bodyheight) # sorts these values in ascending order.
relationship=c(0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1) # assign 'survival' to these 20 individuals non-randomly... most mortality occurs at smaller body size
blrex=as.data.frame(cbind(bodyheight,relationship)) # saves data frame with two columns: body size & survival
library(knitr)
kable(blrex, caption = "Example data set representing the height and relationship status of a sample of men.")
```

```{r blm2, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(ggplot2)
# plot 1
p1 <- ggplot(blrex,
             aes(bodyheight, relationship)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  labs(x = "Height") +
  labs(y = "Relationship", cex = .75) +
  theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 8))+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-0.2, 1.2), xlim = c(160, 200)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 1, 1), labels = c("Not in Relationship", "In Relationship")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
# plot 2
p2 <- ggplot(blrex, aes(x=bodyheight, y=relationship)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm",
    method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
    se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-0.2, 1.2), xlim = c(160, 200)) +
  labs(x = "Height") +                        # x-axis label
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 1, 1), labels = c("Not in Relationship", "In Relationship")) +
  labs(y = "Relationship", cex = .75)
# draw two plots in one window
multiplot(p1, p2, cols = 2)
```

The left panel of the Figure above shows that a linear model would predict values for the relationship status, which represents a factor (0 = Not in Relationship and 1 = In Relationship), that are non-sensical because 1.1 does not make sense if the only options are 0 OR 1. The logistic function shown in the right panel of the Figure above solves this problem by working on the logged probabilities of an outcome rather than on the actual outcome.

## Example 1: Eh in Kiwi English

To exemplify hot to implement a logistic regression in "R", we will analyse the use of the discourse particle *eh* in New Zealand English and test which factors correlate with its occurrence. The data set represents speech units in a corpus that were coded for the speaker who uttered a given speech unit, the gender, ethnicity, and age of that speaker and whether or not the speech unit contained an *eh*. To begin with, we clean the current work space, set option, install and activate relevant packages, load customized functions, and load the example data set.

```{r blm3, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 # clean workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
 # set options
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4)
# load libraries
library(effects)
library(ggplot2)
library(mlogit)
library(plyr)
library(rms)
library(sjPlot)
library(visreg)
# load functions
source("rscripts/multiplot_ggplot2.R")
source("rscripts/blr.summary.R")
# load data
blrdata <- read.table("data/blrdata.txt",
                      comment.char = "",  # data does not contain comments
                      quote = "",         # data does not contain quotes
                      sep = "\t",         # data is tab separetd
                      header = T)         # variables have headers
# inspect data
str(blrdata)
```

 The summary of the data show that the data set contains 25,821 observations of five variables. The variable "ID" contains strings that represent a combination file and speaker of a speech unit. The second variable represents the gender, the third the age, and the fourth the ethnicity of speakers. The fifth variable represents whether or not a speech unit contained the discourse particle *eh*. The first six lines of the data set are shown in the Table below.

```{r blm4, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(blrdata), caption = "First six line of the blrdata data set.")
```

Next, we factorize the variables in our data set. In other words, we specify that the strings represent variable levels and define new reference levels because as a default "R" will use the variable level which first occurs in alphabet ordering as the reference level for each variable, we redefine the variable levels for Age and Ethnicity.

```{r blm5, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vrs <- c("Age", "Gender", "Ethnicity", "ID")  # define variables to be factorized
fctr <- which(colnames(blrdata) %in% vrs)     # define vector with variables
blrdata[,fctr] <- lapply(blrdata[,fctr], factor) # factorize variables
blrdata$Age <- relevel(blrdata$Age, "Young") # relevel Age (Young = Reference)
blrdata$Ethnicity <- relevel(                # relevel Ethnicity
  blrdata$Ethnicity, "Pakeha") # define Pakeha as Reference level)
```

After preparing the data, we will now plot the data to get an overview of potential relationships between variables.

```{r blm6, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

With respect to main effects, the Figure above indicates that men use *eh* more frequently than women, that young speakers sue it more frequently compared with old speakers, and that speakers that are descendants of European settlers (Pakeha) use *eh* more frequently compared with Maori (the native inhabitants of New Zealand).

The plots in the lower panels do not indicate significant interactions between use of *eh* and the Age, Gender, and Ethnicity of speakers. In a next step, we will start building the logistic regression model.

## Model Building

As a first step, we need to define contrasts and add a distance matrix to the options. Contrasts define what should be tested and therefore has influence on how the results of the regression analysis are presented.

```{r blm7, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# set contrasts
options(contrasts  =c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly"))
# create distance matrix
blrdata.dist <- datadist(blrdata)
# include distance matrix in options
options(datadist = "blrdata.dist")
```

Next, we generate four base-line models: two minimal models that predict the use of *eh* sole based on the intercept and two initial saturated regression models that include all variables and their interactions.

```{r blm8, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# baseline glm model
m0.glm = glm(EH ~ 1, family = binomial, data = blrdata)
# baseline lrm model
m0.lrm = lrm(EH ~ 1, data = blrdata, x = T, y = T)
m1.glm = glm(EH ~ Age*Gender*Ethnicity, family = binomial, data = blrdata)
m1.lrm = lrm(EH ~ Age*Gender*Ethnicity, data = blrdata, x = T, y = T)
```

A few words on "glm" vs "lrm":   Baayen (2008:196-197) states that lrm should be the function of choice in cases where each row contains exactly 1 success OR failure (1 or 0) while glm is preferable if there are two columns holding the number of successes and the number of failures respectively. I have tried it both ways and both functions work fine if each row contains exactly 1 success OR failure but only glm can handle the latter case.

## Model fitting

We will now start with the model building procedure. In the present case, we will use a manual step-wise step-down protocol during which predictors are removed from the model if they do not significantly to the model fit.

```{r blm9, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# remove Age:Gender:Ethnicity
m2.glm <- update(m1.glm, . ~ . -Age:Gender:Ethnicity)
# check if removal significantly decreases model fit
anova(m1.glm, m2.glm, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVA shows that the fit of the saturated model (m1.glm) and the model without the interaction between Age, Gender, and Ethnicity (m2.glm) do not differ significantly. The lack of a significant difference is provided in the value of Pr(>Chi) (0.63) which is higher than .05. Because the models do not differ significantly, we continue with the smaller model (m3.glm) as this is the correct procedure based on the principle of parsimony.

```{r blm10, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m3.glm <- update(m2.glm, . ~ . -Gender:Ethnicity)
anova(m2.glm, m3.glm, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVA shows that the fit of the saturated model (m2.glm) and the model without the interaction between Gender and Ethnicity (m3.glm) do not differ significantly. The lack of a significant difference is provided in the value of Pr(>Chi) (0.94) which is higher than .05. Because the models do not differ significantly, we continue with the smaller model (m3.glm) as this is the correct procedure based on the principle of parsimony.

```{r blm11, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m4.glm <- update(m3.glm, . ~ . -Age:Gender)
anova(m3.glm, m4.glm, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVA shows that the fit of the saturated model (m3.glm) and the model without the interaction between Age and Gender (m4.glm) do not differ significantly. The lack of a significant difference is provided in the value of Pr(>Chi) (0.63) which is higher than .05. Because the models do not differ significantly, we continue with the smaller model (m4.glm) as this is the correct procedure based on the principle of parsimony.

```{r blm12, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m5.glm <- update(m4.glm, . ~ . -Age:Ethnicity)
anova(m4.glm, m5.glm, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVA shows that the fit of the saturated model (m4.glm) and the model without the interaction between Age and Ethnicity (m5.glm) do not differ significantly. The lack of a significant difference is provided in the value of Pr(>Chi) (0.09) which is higher than .05. Because the models do not differ significantly, we continue with the smaller model (m5.glm) as this is the correct procedure based on the principle of parsimony.

```{r blm13, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m6.glm <- update(m5.glm, . ~ . -Ethnicity)
anova(m5.glm, m6.glm, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVA shows that the fit of the saturated model (m5.glm) and the model without the main effect for Ethnicity (m6.glm) do not differ significantly. The lack of a significant difference is provided in the value of Pr(>Chi) (0.61) which is higher than .05. Because the models do not differ significantly, we continue with the smaller model (m6.glm) as this is the correct procedure based on the principle of parsimony.

```{r blm14, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m7.glm <- update(m6.glm, . ~ . -Gender)
anova(m7.glm, m6.glm, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVA shows that the fit of the more saturated model (m6.glm) and the model without the main effect for Gender (m7.glm) differ significantly. The significant difference is provided in  the value of Pr(>Chi) (<0.0000000000000002 ***) which is smaller than .05. Because the models differ significantly, we continue with the more saturated model (m6.glm) as this is the correct procedure based on the principle of parsimony.

```{r blm15, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m8.glm <- update(m6.glm, . ~ . -Age)
anova(m8.glm, m6.glm, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVA shows that the fit of the more saturated model (m6.glm) and the model without the main effect for Age (m8.glm) differ significantly. The significant difference is provided in the value of Pr(>Chi) (<0.0000000000000002 ***) which is smaller than .05. Because the models differ significantly, we continue with the more saturated model (m6.glm) as this is the correct procedure based on the principle of parsimony.

As we have now arrived at the final minimal adequate model (m6.glm), we generate a final minimal model using the "lrm" model.

```{r blm16, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m6.lrm <- lrm(EH ~ Age+Gender, data = blrdata, x = T, y = T, linear.predictors = T)
m6.lrm
```


```{r blm17, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anova(m6.lrm)
```

After fitting the model, we validate the model to avoid arriving at a final minimal model that is overfitted to the data at hand.

## Model Validation

To validate the final minimal model, we apply the "validate" function and apply it to the initial saturated model. The output of the "validate" function shows how often predictors are retained if the sample is re-selected with the same size but with placing back the drawn data point. The execution of the function requires some patience as it is rather computationally expensive.

```{r blm18, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# model validation
validate(m1.lrm, bw = T, B = 200)
```

The "validate" function shows that retaining two predictors (Age and Gender) is the best option and thereby confirms our final minimal adequate model as the best minimal model. In addition, we check whether we need to include a penalty for data points because they have too strong of an impact of the model fit. To see whether a penalty is warranted, we apply the "pentrace" function to the final minimal adequate model.

```{r blm19, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pentrace(m6.lrm, seq(0, 0.8, by = 0.05)) # determine penalty
```

The "pentrace" function proposes a penalty of .8 but the values are so similar  that a penalty is unnecessary. In a next step, we rename the final models.

```{r blm20, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lr.glm <- m6.glm  # rename final minimal adeqaute glm model
lr.lrm <- m6.lrm  # rename final minimal adeqaute lrm model
```

Now, we calculate a Model Likelihood Ratio Test to check if the final model performs significantly better than the initial minimal base-line model. The result of this test is provided as a default if we call a summary of the lrm object.

```{r blm21, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
modelChi <- lr.glm$null.deviance - lr.glm$deviance
chidf <- lr.glm$df.null - lr.glm$df.residual
chisq.prob <- 1 - pchisq(modelChi, chidf)
modelChi; chidf; chisq.prob
```

The code above provides three values: a $\chi$^2^, the degrees of freedom, and a p-value. The p-value is lower than .05 and the results of the Model Likelihood Ratio Test therefore confirm that the final minimal adequate model performs significantly better than the initial minimal base-line model. Another way to extract the model likelihood test statistics is to use an ANOVA to compare the final minimal adequate model to the minimal base-line model.

The Model Likelihood Ratio Test

```{r blm22, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anova(m0.glm, lr.glm, test = "Chi") # Model Likelihood Ratio Test
```

In a next step, we calculate pseudo-R^2^ values which represent the amount of residual variance that is explained by the final minimal adequate model. We cannot use the ordinary R^2^ because the model works on the logged likelihoods rather than the values of the dependent variable.


```{r blm23, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate pseudo R^2
# number of cases
ncases <- length(fitted(lr.glm))
R2.hl <- modelChi/lr.glm$null.deviance
R.cs <- 1 - exp ((lr.glm$deviance - lr.glm$null.deviance)/ncases)
R.n <- R.cs /( 1- ( exp (-(lr.glm$null.deviance/ ncases))))
# function for extracting pseudo-R^2
logisticPseudoR2s <- function(LogModel) {
  dev <- LogModel$deviance
	nullDev <- LogModel$null.deviance
	modelN <-  length(LogModel$fitted.values)
	R.l <-  1 -  dev / nullDev
	R.cs <- 1- exp ( -(nullDev - dev) / modelN)
	R.n <- R.cs / ( 1 - ( exp (-(nullDev / modelN))))
	cat("Pseudo R^2 for logistic regression\n")
	cat("Hosmer and Lemeshow R^2  ", round(R.l, 3), "\n")
	cat("Cox and Snell R^2        ", round(R.cs, 3), "\n")
	cat("Nagelkerke R^2           ", round(R.n, 3),    "\n") }
logisticPseudoR2s(lr.glm)

```

The low pseudo-R^2^ values show that our model has very low explanatory power as it only accounts for approximately 2.6 to 4.6 percent of the variance in the data. Next, we extract the confidence intervals for the coefficients of the model.

```{r blm24, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract the confidence intervals for the coefficients
confint(lr.glm)
```

Despite having low explanatory and predictive power, the age of speakers and their gender is  significant as the confidence intervals of the coefficients do not overlap with 0.

## Effect Size

In a next step, we compute odds ratios and their confidence intervals. Odds Ratios represent a common measure of effect size and can be used to compare effect sizes across models. Odds ratios rang between 0 and infinity. Values of 1 indicate that there is not effect. The further away the values from 1, the stronger the effect. If the values are lower than 1, then the variable level correlates negatively with the occurrence of the outcome (the likelihood decreases) while values above 1 indicate a positive correlation and show that the variable level causes an increase in the likelihood of the outcome (the occurrence of EH).

```{r blm25, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
exp(lr.glm$coefficients) # odds ratios
exp(confint(lr.glm))     # confidence intervals of the coefficients
```

The odds ratios confirm that older speakers use *eh* significantly less often compared with younger speakers and that women use *eh* less frequently than men as the confidence intervals of the odds rations do not overlap with 1. In a next step, we calculate the prediction accuracy of the model.

## Accuracy

In order to calculate the prediction accuracy of the model, we rearrange the data so that it does not reflect one speech unit per row but the number of speech units with *eh* and the number of speech units without *eh* per speaker! Thus, we transform the data into a per speaker rather than a per speech-unit format.

```{r blm26, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
blrdata_byspeaker <- table(blrdata$ID, blrdata$EH)
blrdata_byspeaker <- data.frame(rownames(blrdata_byspeaker), blrdata_byspeaker[, 1], blrdata_byspeaker[, 2])
names(blrdata_byspeaker) <- c("ID", "NOEH", "EH")
rownames(blrdata_byspeaker) <- 1:length(blrdata_byspeaker[,1])

blrdata_byspeaker <- join(blrdata_byspeaker,  # join by-speaker data and biodata
                          blrdata, by = "ID", # join by ID
                          type = "left",      # only speakers for which bio data is provided
                          match = "first")    #
blrdata_byspeaker$EH <- NULL                  # remove EH column
```



```{r blm27, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)    # load library
kable(head(blrdata_byspeaker), caption = "First six rows of the by-speaker data.")
```


```{r blm28, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# use by.spk data to fit another model which we will use to test the accuracy of the model
lr.glm.spk <- glm(cbind(EH, NOEH) ~ Age*Gender + Ethnicity + Age:Ethnicity, data = blrdata_byspeaker, family = binomial)
correct <- sum(blrdata_byspeaker$EH * (predict(lr.glm.spk, type = "response") >= 0.5)) + sum(blrdata_byspeaker$NOEH * (predict(lr.glm.spk, type="response") < 0.5))
tot <- sum(blrdata_byspeaker$EH) + sum(blrdata_byspeaker$NOEH)
predict.acc <- (correct/tot)*100
predict.acc
```

The models predicts 99.6 of cases accurately which appears to be a satisfactory result but in order to evaluate the prediction accuracy, we need to compare it to the accuracy of the minimal base-line model.

```{r blm29, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract prediction accuracy
lr.glm.spk.base <- glm(cbind(EH, NOEH) ~ 1, data = blrdata_byspeaker, family = binomial)
correct.b <- sum(blrdata_byspeaker$EH * (predict(lr.glm.spk.base, type = "response") >= 0.5)) + sum(blrdata_byspeaker$NOEH * (predict(lr.glm.spk.base, type="response") < 0.5))
tot.b <- sum(blrdata_byspeaker$EH) + sum(blrdata_byspeaker$NOEH)
predict.acc.base <- (correct.b/tot.b)*100
# inspect prediction accuracy
predict.acc.base
```


Both, the final-minimal and the minimal base-line model have the same prediction accuracy. This is interesting and we need to determine why this is the case. WE will extract the predictions based on both models to find out why the predictions are identical.


```{r blm30, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# compare preictions of final and base line model
which(lr.glm.spk$fitted > .5)
which(lr.glm.spk.base$fitted > .5)
```


The reason why both models arrive at the same predictions is that because both models always predict an absence of EH.

We can now plot the effects using the visreg package [cf. @Breheny2013]

```{r blm31, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create plot
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
visreg(lr.glm, "Age", xlab = "Age",
       ylab = "Logged Odds (EH)",
       ylim = c(-3, 0))
visreg(lr.glm, "Gender", xlab = "Gender",
       ylab = "Logged Odds (EH)",
       ylim = c(-3, 0))
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```


## Model Diagnostics

We are now in a position to perform model diagnostics and test if the model violates distributional requirements. In a first step, we test for the existence of multicollinearity.

### Multicollinearity

To check whether the final minimal model contains predictors that correlate with each other, we extract variance inflation factors (VIF). If a model contains predictors that have variance inflation factors (VIF) > 10 the model is completely unreliable and cannot claim the multicollinearity is absent [@myers1990classical]. Predictors causing such VIFs should be removed. Indeed, predictors with VIF values greater than 4 are usually already problematic but, for large data sets, even VIFs greater than 2 can lead inflated standard errors (Jaeger 2013:http://wiki.bcs.rochester.edu/HlpLab/LSA2013Regression?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=LSA13-Lecture6-CommonIssuesAndSolutions.pdf). Also, VIFs of 2.5 can be problematic [@szmrecsanyi2006morphosyntactic 215] and [@zuur2010protocol] proposes that variables with VIFs exceeding 3 should be removed.

```{r blm32, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vif(lr.glm)
```

In addition, predictors with 1/VIF values $<$ .1 must be removed (data points with values above .2 are considered problematic) [@menard1995applied] and the mean value of VIFs should be $<$ 1 [@bowerman1990linear].

```{r blm33, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mean(vif(lr.glm))
```

### Outlier detection

In order to detect potential outliers, we will calculate diagnostic parameters and add these to our data set.

```{r blm34, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
infl <- influence.measures(lr.glm) # calculate influence statistics
blrdata <- data.frame(blrdata, infl[[1]], infl[[2]]) # add influence statistics
```

```{r blm35, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)    # load library
kable(head(blrdata), caption = "First six rows of the data set with added influence statistics.")
```


### Sample Size

We now check whether the sample size is sufficient for our analysis [@green1991many].
* if you are interested in the overall model: 50 + 8k (k = number of predictors)
* if you are interested in individual predictors: 104 + k
* if you are interested in both: take the higher value!

```{r blm36, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# function to evaluate sample size
smplesz <- function(x) {
  ifelse((length(x$fitted) < (104 + ncol(summary(x)$coefficients)-1)) == TRUE,
    return(
      paste("Sample too small: please increase your sample by ",
      104 + ncol(summary(x)$coefficients)-1 - length(x$fitted),
      " data points", collapse = "")),
    return("Sample size sufficient")) }
# apply unction to model
smplesz(lr.glm)
```

According to rule of thumb provided in @green1991many, the sample size is sufficient for our analysis.

## Summarizing Results

```{r blm37, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
blrmsummary <- blrm.summary(lr.glm, lr.lrm, predict.acc) # summarize regression analysis
blrmsummary[, -c(4:5)] # remove columns with confidence intervals
```

**R2 (Hosmer & Lemeshow)**

 "Rt is the proportional reduction in the absolute value of the log-likelihood
 measure and as such it is a measure of how much the badness of fit improves
 as a result of the inclusion of the predictor variables. It can vary between 0
(indicating that the predictors are useless at predicting the outcome variable)
 and 1 (indicating that the model predicts the outcome variable perfectly)"
(@field2012discovering 317).

**R2 (Cox & Snell)**

 "Cox and Snell's R~s (1989) is based on the deviance of the model (-2LL(new»)
 and the deviance of the baseline model (-2LL(baseline), and the sample size,
 n [...]. However, this statistic never reaches its theoretical maximum of 1.

**R2 (Nagelkerke)**

 Since R2 (Cox & Snell) never reaches its theoretical maximum of 1,
 Nagelkerke (1991) suggested Nagelkerke's R^2. (Field, Miles & Field 2012:317-318).

**Somers’ Dxy**

 Somers’ Dxy is a rank correlation between predicted probabilities and observed
 responses ranges between 0 (randomness) and 1 (perfect prediction). (cf. @baayen2008analyzing 204).

**C**
 C is an index of concordance between the predicted probability and the
 observed response. When C takes the value 0.5, the predictions are random,
 when it is 1, prediction is perfect. A value above 0.8 indicates that the
 model may have some real predictive capacity (cf. @baayen2008analyzing 204).

**Akaike information criteria (AIC)**

Akaike information criteria (AlC = -2LL + 2k) provide a value that reflects a ratio between the number of predictors in the model and the variance that is explained by these predictors. Changes in AIC can serve as a measure of whether the inclusion of a variable leads to a significant increase in the amount of variance that is explained by the model. "You can think of this as the price you pay for something: you get a better value of R^2^, but you pay a higher price, and was that higher price worth it?  These information criteria help you to decide. The BIC is the same as the AIC but adjusts the penalty included in the AlC (i.e., 2k) by the number of cases: BlC = -2LL + 2k x log(n) in which n is the number of cases in the model" (@field2012discovering 318).


# Ordinal Regression

Ordinal regression is very similar to multiple linear regression but takes an ordinal dependent variable. For this reason, ordinal regression is one of the key methods in analyzing Likert data.

```

# Robust Regression

```{r rr1, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(foreign)
library(MASS)
library(sfsmisc)
# load data
robustdata <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/robustdata.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)
# inspect data
summary(robustdata)
```


```{r rr2, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create model
slm <- lm(crime ~ poverty + single, data = robustdata)
# inspect model
summary(slm)
```

We now check whether the model is well fitted using diagnostic plots.

```{r rr3, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create model diagnost plots
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2), oma = c(0, 0, 1.1, 0))
plot(slm, las = 1)
par(opar)
```

The diagnostic plots indicate that there is an outlier in the data (data point 51). Therefore, we need to evaluate if the outlier severely affects the fit of the model.

```{r rr4, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
robustdata[c(9, 25, 51), 1:2]
```


```{r rr5, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
d1 <- cooks.distance(slm)
r <- stdres(slm)
a <- cbind(robustdata, d1, r)
a[d1 > 4/51, ]
```


```{r rr6, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rabs <- abs(r)
a <- cbind(robustdata, d1, r, rabs)
asorted <- a[order(-rabs), ]
asorted[1:10, ]
```



```{r rr7, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create robust regression model
rmodel <- rlm(crime ~ poverty + single, data = robustdata)
# inspect model
summary(rmodel)
```


```{r rr8, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hweights <- data.frame(state = robustdata$state, resid = rmodel$resid, weight = rmodel$w)
hweights2 <- hweights[order(rmodel$w), ]
hweights2[1:15, ]
```


```{r rr9, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rr.bisquare <- rlm(crime ~ poverty + single, data=robustdata, psi = psi.bisquare)
summary(rr.bisquare)
```


```{r rr10, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
biweights <- data.frame(state = robustdata$state, 
                        resid = rr.bisquare$resid,
                        weight = rr.bisquare$w)
biweights2 <- biweights[order(rr.bisquare$w), ]
biweights2[1:15, ]
```

After inspecting the weights, we also want to extract the p-values for the predictors. The p-values have to be calculated separately using the "f.robftest" fucntion from the "sfsmisc" library.

```{r rr11, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p_poverty <- f.robftest(rmodel, var = "poverty")
p_single <- f.robftest(rmodel, var = "single")
# inspect results
p_poverty; p_single
```

The output shows that poverty is not a significant predictor while single correlates highly significanty with crime.
