This is the website of the **Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL)** of the [School of Languages and Cultures](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/) at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/).


**What is LADAL?** 

The aim of LADAL is to assist UQ staff and students with data processing, visualization, and analysis in R as well as to offer guidance with language technology and digital research tools. The focus of this site is placed on dealing with language data and to introduce computational methods and concepts of quantitative reasoning by providing hands-on tutorials and self-guided study materials on various topics that are relevant to our research. 

**Structure and content of the LADAL website** 

The LADAL website provides introductions to quantitative reasoning, research designs, and computational methods including data visualization and statistics. The areas covered on the LADAL website are 

* "Basics": introductions to quantitative reasoning and basic concepts in empirical language studies.

* "Data Processing": introductions to R as programming environment for processing and handling language data.

*  "Visualization": tutorials on data visualization with R.

*  "Statistics": tutorials on statistics using R.

*  "Text Analysis/Corpus Linguistics": tutorials on using R for text analytics, Natural Language Processing, and Corpus Linguistics.
