Welcome to the website of the **Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL)** of the [School of Languages and Cultures](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/) at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/).


**What is LADAL?** 

Originally, the LADAL website was created to assist UQ staff and students with data processing, visualization, and analysis in R as well as to offer guidance with language technology and digital research tools. However, anyone who has an interest in computational approaches to data is become to make use of the LADAL resources.

The LADAL website is a resource to foster computational and digital skills and it provides information and practical tutorials on data processing and visualization as well as on statistical methods relevant for language research. 

The aim of LADAL is to provide hands-on tutorials and self-guided study materials that assist with data processing, visualization, and analysis in R. In addition, the resources provided on the LADAL website aim to offer guidance with language technology and digital research tools that are particularly useful in Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing. In order to be attractive to both beginners and people with advanced skills, the LADAL website covers not only data processing and statistics for people that already have advanced knowledge of such methods but also introductions to basic topics and concepts of quantitative reasoning.

The focus of this site is placed on language data. This is so as the LADAL is a project hosted by the [School of Languages and Cultures](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/) at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). As such, the primary concern of LADAL is to introduce computational methods that are relevant to research involving language data. 

**The LADAL website** 

The LADAL website provides introductions to quantitative reasoning, research designs, and computational methods including data visualization and statistics. The areas covered on the LADAL website are 

* "Basics": introductions to quantitative reasoning and basic concepts in empirical language studies.

* "Data Processing": introductions to R as programming environment for processing and handling language data.

*  "Visualization": tutorials on data visualization with R.

*  "Statistics": tutorials on statistics using R.

*  "Text Analysis/Corpus Linguistics": tutorials on using R for text analytics, Natural Language Processing, and Corpus Linguistics.


**Who is the LADAL website for?**

The LADAL aspires to attract complete novices as well as expert users. And, while the focus of the LADAL website is placed on handling language data, anyone who has an interest in quantitative methods, data visualization, statistics, or R is welcome to explore this webpage. 

**About the LADAL webpage**

Like the hands-on tutorials available on the LADAL webpage, the website itself is written in R (or R Markdown to be precise) which goes to show that R is not merely a software package but a fully-fledged programming environment in which not only allows complex Natural Language Processing, statistics and data visualizations but it can also be used to create websites or apps, and has direct pipelines for version control (Git). The flexibility of R makes it a sensible choice for researchers that strive for high quality and full flexibility while following Best Practices that enable complete replicability and transparency.  

As computation is becoming ever more prevalent across disciplines as well as in both the social and economic domains, the LADAL website aims to offer a resource space for R and guides that make it accessible to lay users as well as expert programmers.
