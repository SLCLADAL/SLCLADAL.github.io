Welcome to the website of the **Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL)** of the [School of Languages and Cultures](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/) at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/).


# What is LADAL?{-}

The LADAL is school-based support infrastructure for digital humanities researchers that assists UQ staff and students with data processing, visualization, and analysis and offers guidance on matters relating to language technology and digital research tools. 

The LADAL aims to help develop computational and digital skills by providing information and practical, hands-on tutorials on data and text analytics as well as on statistical methods relevant for language research. In addition, the LADAL provides self-guided study materials relevant for computational Natural Language Processing. In order to be attractive to both beginners and people with advanced skills, the LADAL website covers topics and introduces methods relevant for people coming with different degrees of prior knowledge and experience - ranging from  introductions to concepts of quantitative reasoning to step-by-step guides on advanced statistical modeling.

Since the primary concern of LADAL is to introduce computational methods that are relevant to research involving natural language, the focus of this website is placed on linguistic data and methods relevant for text analytics. 

The LADAL provides resources for (language) data analytics and offers introductions to quantitative reasoning, research designs, and computational methods including data visualization and statistics. The areas covered on the LADAL website are 

* introductions to quantitative reasoning and basic concepts in empirical language studies.

* introductions to R as programming environment for processing natural language data.

* tutorials on data visualization and data analytics (statistics and machine learning).

* tutorials on text analysis, distant reading, and Corpus Linguistics.


# Who is the LADAL website for?{-}

The LADAL resources are aimed at researchers in HASS (Humanities, Arts, and the Social Sciences) and we aspire to attract complete novices as well as expert users. And, while the focus of the LADAL website is placed on handling data that represents natural language, anyone who has an interest in quantitative methods, data visualization, statistics, or R is welcome to explore this webpage. 

# LADAL and R{-}

This website - like the self-guided study materials offered by the LADAL - is entirely based on and written in  R-markdown which shows how versatile R is. R is, in fact, not merely a software package but a fully-fledged programming environment which not only allows complex Natural Language Processing, statistics and data visualizations but it can also be used to create websites or apps, and has direct pipelines for version control (Git). The flexibility of R makes it a sensible choice for researchers that strive for high quality and full flexibility while following Best Practices that enable complete replicability and transparency.  

However, we hope to expand the resources provided by LADAL to other tools and environments (e.g. Python) in the future. 

As computation is becoming ever more prevalent across disciplines as well as in both the social and economic domains, the LADAL website aims to offer a resource space for R and guides that make it accessible to lay users as well as expert programmers.
