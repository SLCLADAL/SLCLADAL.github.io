<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/isle6logo.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>This document contains the materials for the reproducibility part of the workshop <em>Replication and Reproducibility in English Corpus Linguistics</em> organized by Martin Schweinberger and Joseph Flanagan at the 6<sup>th</sup> meeting of the <em>International Society for the Linguistics of English</em> (ISLE6) hosted by the University of Eastern Finland. The workshop is held on June 2, 2021; ISLE6 takes place between June 2 and June 5, 2021.</p>
<p>The workshop introduces basic data management techniques, version control measures, and issues relating to reproducible research. The entire R markdown document for this workshop session can be downloaded <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/isle6_reprows.html">here</a>. The GitHub repo for this workshop can be found <a href="https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/isle6_reprows">here</a>. <a href="https://slcladal.github.io/repro.html">A more detailed introduction to data management, version control, and reproducible research practices</a> can be found on the website of the <em><a href="https://slcladal.github.io/index.html">Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL)</a></em>. Some of the contents of this tutorial build on Amanda Miotto’s <a href="https://github.com/amandamiotto/Reproducible-Research-Things">Reproducible Reseach Things</a>.</p>
<p>When working with any sort of data on your computer, issues relating to organizing files and folders, managing data and projects, avoiding data loss, and efficient work flows are essential. The idea behind this workshop section is to address this issue and to provide advice on how to handle data and creating efficient workflows that will help you (and your team) in your research.</p>
<p>This part of the workshop consists out of 2 parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Data Management</strong><br />
This part of the workshop focuses on general principles that help to organize your data and help maintain efficient workflows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimizing workflows in RStudio</strong><br />
This part of the workshop focuses on how to optimize your workflows in RStudio and how to create reproducible and robust data processing and analysis chains.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As this workshop is introductory, we will only highlight the most basic ways and tools that you can use to improve your workflows and make them reproducible. We cannot focus on any of the tools in great detail as we want to cover as much ground as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-management" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Data Management</h1>
<p>This section introduces some basic concepts and provides useful tips for managing your research data.</p>
<div id="folder-structure" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Folder structure</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/folderstructure2.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>There are various ways in which you can organize your folders. All of these ways to organize your folders have different advantages and problems but they all have in common that they rely on a tree-structure - more general folders contain more specialized ones. For example, if you want to find any file with as few clicks as possible, an alphabetical folder structure would be a good solution. Organized in this way, everything that starts with a certain letter will be stored by its initial letter (e.g. everything starting with a <em>t</em> such as <em>travel</em> under <em>T</em> or everything related to your <em>courses</em> under <em>C</em>). However, organizing your data alphabetically is not intuitive and completely unrelated topics will be located in the same folder.</p>
<p>A more common and intuitive way to organize your data is to separate your data into meaningful aspects of your life such as Work (containing, e.g., <em>teaching</em> and <em>research</em>), Living (including <em>rent</em>, <em>finances</em>, and <em>insurances</em>), and Media (including <em>Movies</em>, <em>Music</em>, and <em>Audiobooks</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="naming-conventions" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Naming conventions</h2>
<p>A File Naming Convention (FNC) is a framework or protocol if you like for naming your files in a way that describes what files contain and importantly, how they relate to other files. It is essential prior to collecting data to establish an agreed FNC.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/naming.png" width="35%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Folders (as well as files) should be labeled in a meaningful way. This means that you avoid names like <em>Stuff</em> or <em>Document</em> for folders and <em>doc2</em> or <em>homework</em> for files.</p>
<p>Naming files consistently, logically and in a predictable manner will prevent against unorganized files, misplaced or lost data. It could also prevent possible backlogs or project delays. A file naming convention will ensure files are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Easier to process - All team members won’t have to over think the file naming process</p></li>
<li><p>Easier to facilitate access, retrieval and storage of files</p></li>
<li><p>Easier to browse through files saving time and effort</p></li>
<li><p>Harder to lose!</p></li>
<li><p>Check for obsolete or duplicate records</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>University of Edinburgh</em> has a comprehensive and easy to follow list (with examples and explanations) of <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/records-management/guidance/records/practical-guidance/naming-conventions">13 Rules for file naming conventions</a> (shown below). You can also use the recommendations of the <em>Australian National Data Services</em> (ANDS) <a href="https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/data-management/file-wrangling">guide of file wrangling</a>. Some of the suggestions are summarized below.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/goodnaming.png" width="40%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/records-management/guidance/records/practical-guidance/naming-conventions">13 Rules for file naming conventions</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Keep file names short, but meaningful<br />
</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary repetition and redundancy in file names and file paths.<br />
</li>
<li>Use capital letters to delimit words, not spaces or underscores<br />
</li>
<li>When including a number in a file name always give it as a two-digit number, i.e. 01-99, unless it is a year or another number with more than two digits.<br />
</li>
<li>If using a date in the file name always state the date ‘back to front’, and use four digit years, two digit months and two digit days: YYYYMMDD or YYYYMM or YYYY or YYYY-YYYY.<br />
</li>
<li>When including a personal name in a file name give the family name first followed by the initials.<br />
</li>
<li>Avoid using common words such as ‘draft’ or ‘letter’ at the start of file names, unless doing so will make it easier to retrieve the record.<br />
</li>
<li>Order the elements in a file name in the most appropriate way to retrieve the record.<br />
</li>
<li>The file names of records relating to recurring events should include the date and a description of the event, except where the inclusion of any of either of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.<br />
</li>
<li>The file names of correspondence should include the name of the correspondent, an indication of the subject, the date of the correspondence and whether it is incoming or outgoing correspondence, except where the inclusion of any of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.<br />
</li>
<li>The file name of an email attachment should include the name of the correspondent, an indication of the subject, the date of the correspondence, ‘attch’, and an indication of the number of attachments sent with the covering email, except where the inclusion of any of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.<br />
</li>
<li>The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of ‘V’ followed by the version number and, where applicable, ‘Draft’.<br />
</li>
<li>Avoid using non-alphanumeric characters in file names.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="documentation-and-the-bus-factor" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Documentation and the Bus Factor</h2>
<p>Documentation is the idea of documenting your work so that outsiders (or yourself after a long time) can understand what you did and how you did it. As a general rule, you should document where to find what as if you informed someone else how to find stuff on your computer.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/busfactor.png" width="50%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Documentation can include where your results and data are saved but it can also go far beyond this. Documentation does not have to be complex and it can come in different forms, depending on your needs and your work. Documenting what you do can also include photos, word documents with descriptions, or websites that detail how you work.</p>
<p>The idea behind documentation is to keep a log of the contents of folders so that you at a later point in time or someone else can continue your work in case you or someone else is run over by a bus (hence the Bus Factor).</p>
<p>In fact, documentation is all about changing the Bus Factor - how many people on a project would need to be hit by a bus to make a project fail. Many times, projects can have a bus factor of one. Adding documentation means when someone goes on leave, needs to take leave suddenly or finishes their study, their work is preserved for your project.</p>
<p>If you work in a collaborative project, it is especially useful to have a log of where one can find relevant information and who to ask for help with what. Ideally you want to document anything that someone coming on board would need to know. Thus, if you have not created a log for on-boarding, the perfect person to create a log would be the last person who joined the project. Although there is no fixed rule, it is recommendable to store the log either as a ReadMe document or in a ReadMe folder on the top level of the project.</p>

<div id="keep-copies" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Keep copies</h2>
<p>Keeping a copy of all your data (working, raw and completed) in the cloud is incredibly important. This ensures that if you have a computer failure, accidentally delete your data or your data is corrupted, your research is recoverable and restorable.</p>
<p><strong>The 3-2-1 backup rule</strong></p>
<p>Try to have at least three copies of your project that are in different locations. The rule is: keep at least three (3) copies of your data, and store backup-copies on two (2) different storage media , with one (1) of them located offsite. Although this is just a personal preference, I always safe my projects</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/copiesrule.jpg" width="40%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>on my personal notebook</p></li>
<li><p>on at least one additional hard drive (that you keep in a secure location)</p></li>
<li><p>in an online repository (for example, UQ’s <a href="https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm"><em>Research Data Management system (RDM)</em></a> <em>OneDrive</em>, <em>MyDrive</em>, <em>GitHub</em>, or <em>GitLab</em>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using online repositories ensures that you do not lose any data in case your computer crashes (or in case you spill lemonade over it - don’t ask…) but it comes at the cost that your data can be more accessible to (criminal or other) third parties. Thus, if you are dealing with sensitive data, I suggest to store it on an additional external hard drive and do not keep cloud-based back-ups. If you trust tech companies with your data (or think that they are not interested in stealing your data), cloud-based solutions such as <em>OneDrive</em>, Google’s <em>MyDrive</em>, or <em>Dropbox</em> are ideal and easy to use options (however, <a href="https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm">UQ’s RDM</a> is a safer option).</p>
<p>The UQ library also offers additional information on complying with ARC and NHMRC data management plan requirements and that <a href="https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm">UQ RDM</a> meets these requirements for sensitive data (see <a href="https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/for-researchers/uq-research-data-manager/faqs-complying-with-policy-and-requirements">here</a>).</p>

<h2>Avoid duplicates</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/homercopies.jpg" width="30%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Many of the files on our computers have several duplicates or copies on the same machine. Optimally, each file should only be stored once (on one machine). Thus, to minimize the superfluous files on your computer, we can delete any duplicates of files.</p>
<p>You can, of course, do that manually but a better way to do this is to use programs that detect files that are identical in name, file size, and date of creation. One of these programs is the <a href="https://www.duplicatecleaner.com/">Douplicate Cleaner</a>. A tutorial on how to use it can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqutzFSkVCE">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-organize-projects" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>How to organize projects</h2>
<p>This section focuses on how to organize your projects and how to use your computer in doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Project folder design</strong></p>
<p>Having a standard folder structure can keep your files neat and tidy and save you time looking for data. It can also help if you are sharing files with colleagues and having a standard place to put working data and documentation.</p>
<p>Store your projects in a separate folder. For instance, if you are creating a folder for a research project, create the project folder within a separate <em>project</em> folder that is within a <em>research</em> folder. If you are creating a folder for a course, create the course folder within a <em>courses</em> folder within a <em>teaching</em> folder, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/folderstructure.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Whenever you create a folder for a new project, try to have a set of standard folders. For example, when I create research project folders, I always have folders called <em>archive</em>, <em>data</em>, <em>docs</em>, and <em>images</em>. When I create course folders, I always have folders called <em>slides</em>, <em>assignments</em>, <em>exam</em>, <em>studentmaterials</em>, and <em>correspondence</em>. However, you are, of course, free to modify and come up or create your own basic project design. Also, by prefixing the folder names with numbers, you can force your files to be ordered by the steps in your workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having different sub folders allows you to avoid having too many files and many different file types in a single folder. Folders with many different files and file types tend to be chaotic and can be confusing. In addition, I have one ReadMe file on the highest level (which only contains folders except for this one single file) in which I describe very briefly what the folder is about and which folders contain which documents as well as some basic information about the folder (e.g. why and when I created it). This ReadMe file is intended both for me as a reminder what this folder is about and what it contains but also for others in case I hand the project over to someone else who continues the project or for someone who takes over my course and needs to use my materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work in a team or share files and folders regularly, it makes sense to develop a logical structure for your team, you need to consider the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check to make sure there are no pre-existing folder structure agreements</p></li>
<li><p>Name folders appropriately and in a meaningful manner. Don’t use staff names and consider using the type of work</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency - make sure you use the agreed structure/hierarchy</p></li>
<li><p>Structure folders hierarchically - start with a limited number of folders for the broader topics, and then create more specific folders within these</p></li>
<li><p>Separate ongoing and completed work - as you start to create lots of folders and files, it is a good idea to start thinking about separating your older documents from those you are currently working on</p></li>
<li><p>Backup – ensure folders and files are backed up and retrievable in the event of a disaster. UQ like most universities, have safe storage solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean up folders and files post project.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="data-as-publications" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Data as publications</h2>
<p>More recently, regarding data as a form of publications has gain a lot of traction. This has the advantage that it rewards researchers who put a lot of work into compiling data and it has created an incentive for making data available, e.g. for replication. The UQ RDM and UQ eSpace can help with the <a href="https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/publish-a-dataset-with-uqrdm-and-uq-espace">process of publishing a dataset</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/rdm.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>There are many platforms where data can be published and made available in a sustainable manner. Below are listed just some options that are recommendable:</p>
<details>
<p><summary><strong>UQ Research Data Manager</strong></summary></p>
<p>The <a href="https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm">UQ Research Data Manager</a> (RDM) system is a robust, world-leading system designed and developed here at UQ. The UQ RDM provides the UQ research community with a collaborative, safe and secure large-scale storage facility to practice good stewardship of research data. The European Commission report “Turning FAIR into Reality” cites UQ’s RDM as an exemplar of, and approach to, good research data management practice. The disadvantage of RDM is that it is not available to everybody but restricted to UQ staff, affiliates, and collaborators.</p>
</details>
<details>
<p><summary><strong>Open Science Foundation</strong></summary></p>
<p>The <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Foundation</a> (OSF) is a free, global open platform to support your research and enable collaboration.</p>
</details>
<details>
<p><summary><strong>TROLLing</strong></summary></p>
<p><a href="https://dataverse.no/dataverse/trolling">TROLLing | DataverseNO</a> (<em>The Tromsø Repository of Language and Linguistics</em>) is a repository of data, code, and other related materials used in linguistic research. The repository is open access, which means that all information is available to everyone. All postings are accompanied by searchable metadata that identify the researchers, the languages and linguistic phenomena involved, the statistical methods applied, and scholarly publications based on the data (where relevant).</p>
</details>
<details>
<p><summary><strong>Git</strong></summary></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> offers the distributed version control using Git. While GitHub is not designed to host research data, it can be used to share small collections of research data and make them available to the public. The size restrictions and the fact that GitHub is a commercial enterprise owned by Microsoft are disadvantages of this as well as alternative, but comparable platforms such as <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Optimizing workflows in RStudio</h1>
<p>Most researchers in the language science are familiar to R to some extend. However, while workshops on how to perform particular tasks in R, such as how to do statistical analyses in R, are becoming more widespread, there rarely exist any workshops on how to work in R.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/rstudiologo.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>By working in R, I am referring to issues relating to reproducible and effective work flows and session management but also to formatting conventions for R code. The following sections will provide some guidance on how to optimize your work flows and how to make your research practices more transparent, efficient, and reproducible.</p>
<div id="installing-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Installing R and RStudio</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You have NOT yet installed <strong>R</strong> on your computer?</p>

<li>Click <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a> for downloading and installing RStudio.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a more elaborate explanation of how to download and install R and RStudio <a href="https://gitlab.com/stragu/DSH/blob/master/R/Installation.md">here</a> that was created by the UQ library.</p>
</div>
<div id="rproj" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Rproj</h2>
<p>If you’re using RStudio, you have the option of creating a new R project. A project is simply a working directory designated with a <code>.RProj</code> file. When you open a project (using File/Open Project in RStudio or by double–clicking on the <code>.RProj</code> file outside of R), the working directory will automatically be set to the directory that the <code>.RProj</code> file is located in. Using Rprojects makes working in and with R much easier and you can always return exactly to where you left of when you closed the Rproject.</p>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/rproj.png" width="40%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>I recommend creating a new R Project whenever you are starting a new research project. Once you’ve created a new R project, you should immediately create folders in the directory which will contain your R code, data files, notes, and other material relevant to your project (you can do this outside of R on your computer, or in the Files window of RStudio). For example, you could create a folder called <em>scripts</em> that contains all of your R code (the scripts), a folder called <em>data</em> that contains all your data, a folder called <em>images</em> for your visualizations, etc.</p>
<p>Before working with Rprojects, I set my working directories with <code>setwd()</code> but this is not optimal because it takes an absolute file path as an input then sets it as the current working directory of the R process. However, this makes scripts break easily and it makes it more difficult to share my analyses and projects with others. Hence, the <code>setwd()</code> approach makes it very difficult to share work and make it transparent and reproducible.</p>
</div>
<div id="solving-dependency-issues-renv" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Solving dependency issues: renv</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/renv.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>The <code>renv</code> package is a new way to make Rprojects independent and thus to remove outside dependencies from Rprojects. The <code>renv</code> package creates a new library within your project so that your Rproject is independent of your personal library and when you share your project, you automatically also share the packages that you have used. The idea behind <code>renv</code> is to be a robust, stable replacement for the <code>packrat</code> package which was rather unsatisfactory to work with (speaking from experience here).</p>
<p>I have used <code>renv</code> and, while it took some time to generate the local library on first use, it was very easy to use, did not cause any issues and is overall very recommendable to get rid of outside dependencies and thus make Rprojects easier to share for transparency and reproducibility.</p>
<p>Underlying the philosophy of <code>renv</code> is that all existing work flows should just work as they did before – <code>renv</code> helps to isolate your project’s R dependencies (like package versioning).</p>
<p>You can get more information about <code>renv</code> and how it works, as well as how you can use it <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="version-control-with-git" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Version Control with Git</h2>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/gitgithub.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>The easiest way to use version control when working with RStudio is to use the <code>usethis</code> package. To connect your Rproject with GitHub, <strong>you need to have Git installed</strong> (if you have not yet downloaded and installed Git, simply search for <code>download git</code> in your favorite search engine and follow the instructions) and <strong>you need to have a GitHub account</strong>. If you do not have a GitHub account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYTifWe6M8I">here</a> is a video tutorial showing how you can do this.</p>
<p>To connect your Rproject and GitHub, open Rmd file in your Rproj and load the <code>usethis</code> package (you may need to install the <code>usethis</code> package if you have not already done so before.). In addition, you have to</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(usethis)
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = &quot;Your Name&quot;, user.email = &quot;youremail@somehost.com&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://slcladal.github.io/images/git_connect_rstudio2.png" width="25%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Then, we go to our github page and create a new GitHub repository (repo) that we call <code>isle6_reprows</code> (or whatever you want to call your repository). To create a new repository on GitHub, simply click on <code>New Repository</code> after you have clicked on the <code>New</code> icon. I recommend that you check <code>Add a Readme</code> in which you can describe what the repo contains, but you do not have to do this.</p>
<p>Once you have created a new GitHub repo, we need to connect this repo to our computer. To do this, we need to <em>clone</em> the repo which we do by clicking on the green <code>Code</code> icon. When you click on the green <code>Code</code> icon, a dropdown menu appears and you copy the url in the section <code>clone with HTTPS</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we <em>turn on</em> Git by going to <code>Tools</code> &gt; <code>Project Options</code> &gt; <code>Git/SVN</code> and change from <em>None</em> to Git.</p>
<p>Then, we go to the <strong>Terminal</strong> (in-between <code>Console</code> and <code>Jobs</code>) and check the current working directory using <code>pwd</code> command (print working directory).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># check current working directory ()
pwd</code></pre>
<p>We can then set the working directory to the current directory using the <code>cd</code> command (change directory) followed by a white space and the the path to the project folder.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># move to the project directory
cd D:/Uni/Konferenzen/ISLE/ISLE_2021/isle6_reprows</code></pre>
<p>We can assure ourselves that the current directory now is in the project folder by using the <code>pwd</code> command.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># check current working directory
pwd</code></pre>
<p>Now, we include the path we got from the git repository after the command <code>git remote add origin</code> and then first pull files from that repo (using the command <code>git pull origin master</code>) and finally push our files into the remote GitHub repo by using the command <code>git push -u origin master</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># initiate the upstream tracking of the project on the GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/isle6_reprows.git
# pull all files from the GitHub repo (typically just readme, license, gitignore)
git pull origin master
# set up GitHub repo to track changes on local machine
git push -u origin master</code></pre>
<p>We can then commit changes and push them to the remote GitHub repo.</p>
<p>You can then go to your GitHub repo and check if the documents that we pushed are now in the remote repo.</p>
<p>From now on, you can simply commit all changes that you make to the GitHub repo associated wiht that Rproject. Other projects can, of course, be connected and push to other GitHub repos.</p>
</div>
<div id="solving-path-issues-here" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Solving path issues: here</h2>
<p>The goal of the <code>here</code> package is to enable easy file referencing in project-oriented workflows. In contrast to using <code>setwd()</code>, which is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files, <code>here</code> uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files.</p>
<p>This makes your projects more robust as the paths will still work if you put your project into another location or on another computer. Also, moving between Mac and Windows (which would require different kind of path specifications) is no longer an issue with the <code>here</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># define path
example_path_full &lt;- &quot;D:\\Uni\\Konferenzen\\ISLE\\ISLE_2021\\isle6_reprows/repro.Rmd&quot;
# show path
example_path_full</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;D:\\Uni\\Konferenzen\\ISLE\\ISLE_2021\\isle6_reprows/repro.Rmd&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>here</code> package, the path starts in folder where the Rproj file is. As the Rmd file is in the same folder, we only need to specify the Rmd file and the <code>here</code> package will add the rest.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load package
library(here)
# define path using here
example_path_here &lt;- here::here(&quot;repro.Rmd&quot;)
#show path
example_path_here</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;D:/Uni/UQ/SLC/LADAL/SLCLADAL.github.io/repro.Rmd&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="reproducible-randomness-set.seed" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Reproducible randomness: set.seed</h2>
<p>The <code>set.seed</code> function in R sets the seed of R‘s random number generator, which is useful for creating simulations or random objects that can be reproduced. This means that when you call a function that uses some form of randomness (e.g. when using random forests), using the <code>set.seed</code> function allows you to replicate results.</p>
<p>Below is an example of what I mean. First, we generate a random sample from a vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>numbers &lt;- 1:10
randomnumbers1 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers1</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  7  2  4  6  3 10  8  1  9  5</code></pre>
<p>We now draw another random sample using the same <code>sample</code> call.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>randomnumbers2 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers2</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  3  5  8  7  4  1 10  9  6  2</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we now have a different string of numbers although we used the same call. However, when we set the seed and then generate a string of numbers as show below, we create a reproducible random sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123)
randomnumbers3 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers3</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  3 10  2  8  6  9  1  7  5  4</code></pre>
<p>To show that we can reproduce this sample, we call the same seed and then generate another random sample which will be the same as the previous one because we have set the seed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123)
randomnumbers4 &lt;- sample(numbers, 10)
randomnumbers4</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  3 10  2  8  6  9  1  7  5  4</code></pre>
