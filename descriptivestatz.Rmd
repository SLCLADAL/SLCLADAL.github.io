# Introduction

This tutorial focuses on how to describe and summarize data [see e.g. @bickel2012descriptive; @thompson2009descriptive]. The entire R markdown document for this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/descriptivestatz.Rdm).

To show why data summaries are useful, think of the following: you are teaching two different classes in the same school, in the same grade, and at the same level. Both classes take the same exam and, after correcting and grading the exams, someone asks you which class performed better. You could of course say something along the lines of "Well, class A had 5 Bs, 10 Cs, 12 Ds, and 2 Fs while class B had 2 As, 8 Bs, 10 Ds, and 4 Fs" but this answer is not really satisfying. Descriptive statistics enable you to summarize complex data sets in very few words and using only very basic, and easy to understand, concepts. And this is what we will be dealing with in the following. 

Before delving deeper into what descriptive statistics is, it is useful to have a general idea of how it can be contextualized. Thus, on a more general note, we will be dealing only with one particular subbranch of statistics. Statistics in general can be defined as a branch of mathematics that deals with data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. As such, statistics can be subdivided into two main areas. *Descriptive statistics* deals with the description of data and their visualization, while *inferential statistics* deals with data analysis and interpretation. Typically, this means testing assumptions about correlations between variables (see for example [here](https://slcladal.github.io/basicstatzregression.html)). As stated above, here, we will be dealing with the description of data, especially with *measures of central tendency*, *measures of variability* and *confidence intervals*.

**Preparation and session set up**

As all calculations and visualizations in this tutorial rely on "R", it is necessary to install "R" and "RStudio". If these programs (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not already installed on your machine, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain "libraries" or "packages" need to be installed so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the libraries by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the libraries mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary libraries, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
# install packages
install.packages(c("boot", "DescTools", "dplyr", "knitr", "psych", 
                   "Rmisc", "stringr"))
```

After having installed the packages, we have to activate them by running the code below.

```{r prep2, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# activate packages
library(boot)
library(DescTools)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(psych)
library(Rmisc)
library(stringr)
```

Once you have installed R, R-Studio, and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Measures of Centrality

In linguistics three measures of centrality or measures of central tendency are of particular relevance: the *mean*, the *median* and the *mode* [@gaddis1990introduction]. In addition, there are two more measures of central tendency, the geometric and the harmonic mean which we will only briefly discuss as they are not that relevant for language research. What measure is appropriate depends on the type of variable scaling, the distribution of the data, and what is the intended aim of the data summary.

```{r echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, }
Means <- c("(Arithmetic) mean (average)", "Median (middle value)", "Mode (most frequent value)", "Geometric mean (average factor)", "Harmonic mean (average rate)")
Use <- c("Description of normally distributed numeric variables (most common measure of central tendency)", "Description of non-normal numeric variables or ordinal variables (skewed data or influential outliers)", "Description of nominal and categorical variables", "Description of dynamic processes such as growth rates", "Description of dynamic processes such as velocities")
df <- data.frame(Means, Use)
kable(df, caption = "Measures of central tendency and their use.")
```

In the following we will go over these types of measures of central tendencies, exemplify their use, describe their strengths and weaknesses, and show how to calculate them in R.

## Mean

The mean is used when the data is numeric and normally distributed. The mean is calculated by applying the formula shown below.

\begin{equation}
  \bar{x}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+ \dots + x_{n}}{n}
\end{equation}

To calculate the mean, sum up all values and divide by the number of values. See the example below for clarification. 

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
x1 <- c(2, 8, 4, 6)
x2 <- c(5, 5, 5, 5)
barplot(x1, ylim = c(0,10), axes = F)
text(seq(.7, 4.3, 1.2), x1+1, x1)
barplot(x2, ylim = c(0,10), axes = F, col = rep("red", 4))
text(seq(.7, 4.3, 1.2), x2+1, x2)
mtext("(Arithmetic) Mean", 3,1,at=2.5)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Consider, we are interested in the mean length of sentences in a short text, then the first thing we could do would be to list the sentences and their length in a table.


```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
Sentences <- c("Call me Ishmael", "Some years ago -- never mind how long precisely -- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.", "It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation.", "Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.")
Words <- c(3, 40, 15, 87)
df <- data.frame(Sentences, Words)
kable(df, caption = "Sentences of the first paragraph of Herman Melville's *Moby Dick* and the number of words in each sentence.")
```


To calculate the mean, we need to divide the sum of the number of words per sentence (145) by the number of sentences (7) (see the equation below).

\begin{equation}
\frac{3+40+15+87}{4} = \frac{145}{4} = 36.25
\label{eq:mittel2}
\end{equation}

The mean sentences length in our example is 36.25 words

In R, the *mean* is calculated as follows.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
# create numeric vector
frequencies <- c(3, 40, 15, 87)
# calculate mean
mean(frequencies)
```

## Median

The median is typically used when dealing with ordinal variables, i.e. variables that are ordered but not truly numeric. The median is the central value in a de- or increasing ordering of values in a vector. In other words, 50 percent of values are above and 50 percent of values are below the median in a given vector.

If the vector contains an even number of elements, then the two central values are summed up and divided by 2. If the vector contains an uneven number of elements, the median represents the central value.

\begin{equation}
median_{x}=
\begin{cases}
x_{\frac{n+1}{2}} & n\text{ uneven} \\
\frac{1}{2}\bigl(x_{\frac{n}{2}}+x_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\bigr) & n\text{ even}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:median}
\end{equation}

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
x1 <- c(5, 2, 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, 4, 6)
x2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
barplot(x1, ylim = c(0,11), axes = F)
text(seq(.7, (.7+9*1.2), 1.2), x1+1, x1)
barplot(x2, ylim = c(0,11), axes = F, col = c(rep("grey", 4), "red", rep("grey", 4)))
text(seq(.7, (.7+9*1.2), 1.2), x2+1, x2)
mtext("Median value", 3, 1, at =(.7+4*1.2))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Let's have a look at an example. Consider you are interested in the age stratification of speakers in the private dialogue section of the Irish component of the *International Corpus of English* (ICE). When tabulating and plotting the age variable you get the following table and graph.


```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
Age <- c("0-10", "19-25", "26-33", "34-41", "42-49", "50+")
Counts <- c(9, 160, 70, 15, 9, 57)
df <- data.frame(Age, Counts)
kable(df, caption = "Number of speakers across age groups in the private dialogue section of the Irish component of the  *International Corpus of English* (ICE)")
```


```{r echo=F, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
Age <- c("0-18", "19-25", "26-33", "34-41", "42-49", "50+")
Counts <- c(9, 160, 70, 15, 9, 57)
df <- data.frame(Age, Counts)
```

```{r echo=F, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
barplot(df$Counts,
        ylim = c(0,200),
        ylab = "Frequency",
        xlab = "Age")
mtext(df$Age, 1, 1, at = seq(.7, 6.7, 1.2))
text(seq(.7, 6.7, 1.2), df$Counts +10, df$Counts)
box()
```


The age groups represent an order factor which means that there are categories with a natural order (here from old to young or vice versa). If we order speakers according to their age from young to old, we get a vector of length 320. If we then take the central value, i.e. the value of the 160^th^ speaker, we get the median age in the private dialogue section of the Irish component of the *International Corpus of English* (ICE). 

In R, the *median* is calculated as shown below.

```{r median}
# create a vector consisting out of ranks
ranks <- c(rep(1, 9), rep(2, 160), rep(3, 70), rep(4, 15), rep(5, 9), rep(6, 57))
# calculate median
median(ranks)
```
In our case, the median age is *19-25* because the 160^th^ speaker belongs to the 2^nd^ age group, i.e. the age group with speakers between 19 and 25 years old.  

## Mode

The mode is typically used when dealing with categorical variables and it reports which level of a factor or a categorical variable is the most frequent. 

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
x1 <- c(5, 2, 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, 4, 6)
x2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
barplot(x1, ylim = c(0,11), axes = F)
text(seq(.7, (.7+9*1.2), 1.2), x1+1, x1)
barplot(x2, ylim = c(0,11), axes = F, col = c(rep("grey", 8), "red"))
text(seq(.7, (.7+9*1.2), 1.2), x2+1, x2)
mtext("Mode", 3, 1, at =(.7+8*1.2))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Here is an example to illustrate the mode. Consider you are interested where most speakers in the private dialogue section of the Irish component of the *International Corpus of English* are currently residing and you get the following distribution.

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
CurrentResidence <- c("Belfast", "Down", "Dublin (city)", "Limerick", "Tipperary")
Speakers <- c(98, 20, 110, 13, 19)
df <- data.frame(CurrentResidence, Speakers)
kable(df, caption = "Number of speakers across counties of current residency in the private dialogue section of the Irish component of the  *International Corpus of English* (ICE)")
```


```{r echo=F, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
barplot(df$Speakers,
        ylim = c(0,200),
        ylab = "Frequency",
        xlab = "Age")
mtext(df$CurrentResidence, 1, 1, at = seq(.7, 5.5, 1.2))
text(seq(.7, 5.5, 1.2), df$Speakers +10, df$Speakers)
box()
```

The tabulated and visualized data show that the mode is *"Dublin (City)"*, because the largest group (110 speakers) of speakers in the corpus are speakers from the city of Dublin. This means that the "average" speaker in in the private dialogue section of the Irish component of the *International Corpus of English* (ICE) is from Dublin city.

In R the *mode* is calculated as shown below:

```{r mode}
# create a factor with the current residence of speakers
CurrentResidence <- c(rep("Belfast", 98),         # repeat "Belfast" 98 times
                      rep("Down", 20),            # repeat "Down" 20 times
                      rep("Dublin (city)", 110),  # repeat "Dublin (city)" 110 times
                      rep("Limerick", 13),        # repeat "Limerick" 13 times
                      rep("Tipperary", 19))       # repeat "Tipperary" 19 times
# calculate mode
names(which.max(table(CurrentResidence)))         # extract which level occurs most frequently
```

A word of warning is in order here as only the first(!) maximal value is provided by R even if several categories have the same frequency. 

## Geometric mean

The geometric mean represents a measure of central tendency that is used when dealing with dynamic processes where the later elements are dependent on the previous elements. The geometric mean is calculated according to the equation below.

\begin{equation}
\bar{x}_{geometric} = \sqrt[n]{x_1 \times x_{i+1} \times \dots \times x_n}
\end{equation}

Imagine you have the option to buy two different stock packages and you have to buy one of them. Which one would you buy?

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
Year <- c("Year 1", "Year 2", "Year 3", "Year 4")
Package1 <- c("+5%", "-5%", "+5%", "-5%")
Package2 <- c("+20%", "-20%", "+20%", "-20%")
df <- data.frame(Year, Package1, Package2)
kable(df, caption = "Performance of two stock packages.")
```

Is one package better than the other? Did one package perform better than the other?


* Package 1:
    + Return: $1.05 \times .95 \times 1.05 \times .95  = .995$ (0.5% loss)
    + Year-over-year average: $.995^{1/4}$ = ~0.125% loss per year
* Package 2:
    + Return: $1.2 \times .8 \times 1.2 \times .8 = 0.9216$ (7.84% loss)
    + Year-over-year average: $.9216^{1/4}$ = ~2% loss per year.

Package 2 performs substantially worse because here, the changes in growth depend on the previous growth rates.

## Harmonic mean

The harmonic mean is a measure of central tendency that provides us with the average rate and is used when dealing with dynamic processes that involve velocities and distances. The harmonic mean is calculated according to the equation below.

\begin{equation}
\bar{x}_{harmonic} = 
\frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_i} + \frac{1}{x_{i+1}} + \frac{1}{x_{i+\dots}} + \frac{1}{x_n}}
\end{equation}

Let's use an example to see what the harmonic mean describes. Imagine you assign group projects to students and you are interested in the average time it takes them to finalize the projects. The cruial thing is that the end state is the same: the finished project.

Let us say there are two groups, group A and group B. It takes group A 30 hours and group B 60 hours to finish their project. What is the average rate at which these two groups have finished their projects? If we used the arithmetic mean, we would say it takes them on average 45 hours to finish their projects but this is not appropriate in the present case.

\begin{equation}
\bar{x}_{harmonic} = 
\frac{2}{\frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{60}} = \frac{2}{\frac{2}{60} + \frac{1}{60}} = \frac{2}{\frac{3}{60}} = \frac{2}{1} \times \frac{60}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40
\end{equation}

The harmonic mean is used when two rates contribute to the same workload (for instance when we download a file). Each instalment is in a relay race and contributes the same amount to the issue. For example, we make a round trip to work and back. The way to work is 60 kilometres. On the way to work, we can only travel at 30 kph while we can go 60 kph on the way back. The distance is the same. Half of the results (distance travelled) comes from the first rate (30 kilometres per hour) and the other half from the second rate (60 kilometres per hour). The result is that is takes us 3 hours to get to work and back.

The reason why using the arithmetic mean is inappropriate in such cases is the following: The idea behind the arithmetic mean is that we calculate a single value that can replace all values in a given distribution and the sum of the mean values is identical to the sum of the observed values. So, the average is a single element that replaces each element. In our example, we have to drive at 40 kilometres per hour (instead of 30) to work and 40 kilometres per hour (instead of 60) to get back from work in the same amount of time. If we went with 45 kilometres pe hour, then the result would not be 3 hours but 2 hours and 40 minutes so that the result would not be the same.

## Notes on Measures of Centrality

You may ask yourself why there are three different types to calculate the central tendency of a why this is necessary. To answer these questions, consider the following example: Imagine you are interested whether the use of discourse particles differs across two corpora that represent the speech of the same five speakers but different registers. In a first step, you calculate the relative frequency of discourse particle use and both corpora have a mean of 13.4 particles per 1,000 words. Given the mean, the two corpora do not seem to differ. However, when tabulating and plotting the use of particles by speaker across these two corpora we will become immediately aware of the fact that the mean is not the appropriate measure of the central tendency in situations where distributions are very dissimilar.  


```{r echo=F, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
# create data
Corpus <- c(rep("C1", 5), 
            rep("C2", 5))
Speaker <- rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"), 2)  
Frequency <- c(5.2, 11.4, 27.1, 13.7, 9.6, 0.2, 0.0, 1.1, 93.7, 0.4)  
particletable <- data.frame(Corpus, Speaker, Frequency)
A <- c(5.2, 0.2)
B <- c(11.4, 0.0)
C <- c(27.1, 0.1)
D <- c(13.7, 93.7)
E <- c(9.6, 0.4)
barplotdata <- data.frame(A, B, C, D, E)
barplotdata <- as.matrix(barplotdata)
rownames(barplotdata) <- c("Corpus1", "Corpus2")
```

```{r echo=F, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
kable(particletable, 
      caption = "Relative frequencies of discourse particles per speaker in two corpora")
```

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
barplot(barplotdata, 
        main = "Use of discourse particles across two corpora", # add title
        xlab="Speaker",                    # add x-axis label
        ylab="Relative Frequency",         # add y-axis label
        ylim = c(0,110),                   # define y-axis range
        col=c("darkblue","red"),           # define colors
        legend = rownames(barplotdata),    # add a legend
        beside=T,                          # stack the bars
        las = 1                            # tick label perpensicular
        )                                  # end barplot
box()                                      # create a box around panel
text(c(1.5,2.5,4.5,5.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,11.5, 13.5,14.5), barplotdata+5, barplotdata) 
```

The Figure above shows that the use of discourse particles is distributed rather evenly across speakers in Corpus 1 while 4 out of 5 speakers use almost no discourse particles in Corpus 2 - only speaker D makes extensive use of discourse particles in corpus 2. The high usage frequency of discourse particles by speaker D in corpus 2 causes the mean of corpus 2 to be identical to the mean reported for corpus 1 although the distribution of usage rates differs drastically. This means that reporting the median in addition to the mean can be useful even for numeric variables if the distribution of values is very dissimilar.

To exemplify, we will summarize the distribution of discourse particles in the two corpora: The use of discourse particles in corpus 1 (mean = 13.7, median = 11.4) is substantially different from the use of discourse particles in corpus 2 (mean = 13.7, median = 0.4).

It is important to keep in mind that - similar to variable scales - measures of central tendency are downward compatible but not upward compatible. This means that one may report the median and mode for numeric variables but the mean may only be used for numeric variables but not for categorical variables. In the following, we have a look at another, more common, way to describe the differences in the distribution between the two corpora, namely, measures of variability. 

# Measures of Variability

Measures of variability provide information about the distribution of values such as whether the data are distributed evenly and do not differ substantially or whether the data are rather heterogeneous and are distributed very unevenly [@thompson2009descriptive]. In the following, we will have a look at the *variance* and the *standard deviation*. 

As before, we will use a practical example to see the usefulness of applying measures of variability. Imagine you dealing with two cities that have the same mean temperature per year. However, the variability of temperatures varies differs dramatically between the two cities.

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
Month <- c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December", "Mean")
CityA <- c(-5, -12, 5, 12, 15, 18, 22, 23, 20, 16, 8, 1, 10.25)  
CityB <- c(7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 15, 13, 11, 8, 7, 10.25)  
temprature <- data.frame(Month, CityA, CityB)
kable(temprature, caption = "Average temperature in two cities by month")
```

```{r echo=F, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
January <- c(-5.00,  7.00)
February <- c(-12.00,  7.00)
March <- c(5.00,  8.00)
April <- c(12.00,  9.00)
May <- c(15.00, 10.00)
June <- c(18.00, 13.00)
July <- c(22.00, 15.00)
August <- c(23.00, 15.00)
September <- c(20.00, 13.00)
October <- c(16.00, 11.00)
November <- c(8.00,  8.00)
December <- c(1.00,  7.00)
lineplotdata <- data.frame(January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December)
lineplotdata <- as.matrix(lineplotdata)
rownames(lineplotdata) <- c("CityA", "City")
```

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
plot(lineplotdata[1,], 
     type = "l", 
     col = "red", 
     axes = F, 
     ylab = "Temperture", 
     xlab = "Month",
     ylim = c(-15, 30),
     lty = 1)
lines(lineplotdata[2,], 
      col = "darkblue",
      lty = 2)
axis(1, 1:12, colnames(lineplotdata), cex = .75, las = 2)
axis(2, seq(-15, 30, 5), seq(-15, 30, 5), las = 2)
box()
legend("topright", 
       lty = c(1,2), 
       col = c("red", "darkblue"), 
       legend = c("City A", "City B"), 
       bty = "n")
```



In the following, we will discuss and calculate different measures of variability for the two cities.

## Range

The range is the simples measure of variability and reports the lowest and highest value of a distribution. That is, the range provides minimum and maximum of a vector to show the span of values within a distribution.

In R, the *range* is extracted as shown below.

```{r range}
# create a numeric vector
cityA <- c(-5, -12, 5, 12, 15, 18, 22, 23, 20, 16, 8, 1)
min(cityA); max(cityA) # extract range
```

The lowest temperature value for city A is -12 degrees Celsius and the highest value is 23 degrees Celsius. The range thus spans from -12 to 23. 

## Interquartile range (IQR)

The interquartile range (IQR) informs about how values are distributed and it denotes the range that encompasses 50 percent of data points. This means that the IQR spans from the first quantile that encompasses 25 percent of the data to the third quartile that encompasses 75 percent of the data. 

The easiest way to extract the IQR in R is to apply the "summary" function to a vector as shown below.

```{r iqr}
summary(cityA) # extract IQR
```

The "summary" function reports that 25 percent of the data fall within -12 and 4 degrees Celsius. The second IQR ranges between 4 and 13.5 degrees Celsius (the median), the third IQR range between 13.5 and 18.5 degrees Celsius, while the fourth IQR ranges between 18.5 and the highest value in the data (23 degrees Celsius). The IQR represent identical width only if the data is distributed normally. Therefore, when dealing with non-normal data, the best option to provide a summary of the distribution is to report the IQRs

## Variance

The variance is calculated according to the formula below. To calculate the variance, each value is subtracted from the mean and the result is squared. The squared values are then added and the resulting sum is divided by the number of values minus 1.


$s = \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^{2}$


For our example, the variance of temperatures for city A is 123.6591 and 9.477273 for city B.

In R, the *variance* is calculated as shown below.

```{r variance}
sd(cityA)^2
```


## Standard deviation 

The standard deviation (abbreviated with capital $sigma$ $\sigma$) is calculated according to first equation shown below or, alternatively, according to second equation shown below and it is the square root of the squared variance.

$\sigma = \sqrt{s} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$

$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$

For our example, the first equation shown above provides a standard deviation of 11.12 for city A and a standard deviation of 3.08 for city B.

In R, the *standard deviation* is calculated as shown below.

```{r sd}
sd(CityA) # calculate standard deviation
```

The standard deviation of temperature values of city A is 11.12.

## Standard Error

The standard error is a measure of variability in the sense that it reports the average distance from some parameters (most often from the mean). It is calculated as the standard deviation of the residuals of the parameter in question. To exemplify the standard error, we will extract and tabulate the most frequent 20 words in the Irish component of the *International Corpus of English* (ICE Ireland 1.2.2)

```{r corpus1, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# define path to corpus
corpusfiles = list.files(path = "data/ICEIrelandSample", pattern = NULL, all.files = T, full.names = T, recursive = T, ignore.case = T, include.dirs = T)
# load and clean corpus
corpus <- lapply(corpusfiles, function(x) {
  scan(x, what = "char", sep = "", quote = "", quiet = T, skipNul = T)})
corpus <- unlist(corpus)                  # unlist corpus
corpus <- paste(corpus, sep = " ", collapse = " ")    # paste corpus together in one element
corpus <- gsub(" {2,}", " ", corpus)      # remove superfluous white spaces
corpus <- str_replace_all(corpus, ">.{1,20}</", "><") # clean corpus
corpus <- str_replace_all(corpus, "<.{1,50}>", "")    # clean corpus
corpus <- gsub(" {2,}", " ", corpus)      # remove superfluous white spaces
corpus <- str_trim(corpus, side = "both") # remove superfluous white spaces at string margins
corpus <- tolower(corpus)                 # convert to lower case
corpuswords <- strsplit(corpus, " ")      # split corpus into words
words <- table(corpuswords)[order(table(corpuswords), decreasing = T)][1:20]  # inspect frequency of first 20 elements
pos <- c("PPR", "ART", "PPR", "CON", "OTH", "PPR", "OTH", "ART", "V", "DPR", "PRP", "PRP", "PPR", "V", "V", "PPR", "PPR", "CON", "DPR", "ART")
wordstb <- data.frame(names(words), pos, as.vector(words))
colnames(wordstb) <- c("WordType", "POS", "Frequency")
kable(wordstb, caption = "20 most frequent words in the sample corpus of ICE Ireland.")
```

The standard error of the mean is calculated using the equation below.

\begin{equation}
\sigma~{\bar{x}}~ =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} 
\end{equation}

The standard error can be calculated manually (see below) by implementing the equation from above.

```{r semanual, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sd(wordstb$Frequency, na.rm=TRUE) /  
   sqrt(length(wordstb$Frequency[!is.na(wordstb$Frequency)]))  
```

An easier way to extract standard errors is to use the "describe" function from the "psych" package (see below)

```{r se, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# decsribe data
describe(wordstb$Frequency,  # vector to be described
               type=2)       # determine of skew and kurtosis
```

# Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals provide an estimation of in-between which values the reported value would lie in the population with a confidence of 95 percent. There are several ways to extract that information and to exemplify how to extract confidence intervals for values, we will look at the frequency of the 20 most frequent words in a sample of the Irish component of the *International Corpus of English* (ICE Ireland 1.2.2). Below you see a table showing the data we will be working with here.

## Confidence Intervals for Simple Vectors

```{r corpus2, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# define path to corpus
corpusfiles = list.files(path = "data/ICEIrelandSample", pattern = NULL, all.files = T, full.names = T, recursive = T, ignore.case = T, include.dirs = T)
# load and clean corpus
corpus <- lapply(corpusfiles, function(x) {
  scan(x, what = "char", sep = "", quote = "", quiet = T, skipNul = T)})
corpus <- unlist(corpus)                  # unlist corpus
corpus <- paste(corpus, sep = " ", collapse = " ")    # paste corpus together in one element
corpus <- gsub(" {2,}", " ", corpus)      # remove superfluous white spaces
corpus <- str_replace_all(corpus, ">.{1,20}</", "><") # clean corpus
corpus <- str_replace_all(corpus, "<.{1,50}>", "")    # clean corpus
corpus <- gsub(" {2,}", " ", corpus)      # remove superfluous white spaces
corpus <- str_trim(corpus, side = "both") # remove superfluous white spaces at string margins
corpus <- tolower(corpus)                 # convert to lower case
corpuswords <- strsplit(corpus, " ")      # split corpus into words
words <- table(corpuswords)[order(table(corpuswords), decreasing = T)][1:20]  # inspect frequency of first 20 elements
pos <- c("PPR", "ART", "PPR", "CON", "OTH", "PPR", "OTH", "ART", "V", "DPR", "PRP", "PRP", "PPR", "V", "V", "PPR", "PPR", "CON", "DPR", "ART")
wordstb <- data.frame(names(words), pos, as.vector(words))
colnames(wordstb) <- c("WordType", "POS", "Frequency")
kable(wordstb, caption = "20 most frequent words in the sample corpus of ICE Ireland.")
```

One easy method for extracting confidence intervals is to apply the "t.test" function.  

```{r ttest, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
t.test(wordstb$Frequency, conf.level=0.95)  # extract mean and confidence intervals
```
 
The "t.test" function provides the mean frequency of the 20 most frequent words in the corpus (521.55) and the 95 percent confidence band: With 95 percent confidence, the mean frequency of the top twenty word types across corpora of the same size and similar register will have a mean between 391.4 and 651.7 words.

Another way to extract the mean and its confidence intervals is by using the "CI" function from the "Rmisc" package.

```{r CI, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract mean and confidence intervals
CI(wordstb$Frequency, ci=0.95)   
``` 

The next way to extract the mean and its confidence intervals we will exemplify here is by using the "MeanCI" function from the "DescTools" package.

```{r MeanCI, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract mean and confidence intervals
MeanCI(wordstb$Frequency, conf.level=0.95)   
``` 

The last way to calculate the mean and its confidence intervals is by bootstrapping or resampling the data and calculating confidence intervals based on the distribution of the resamples data. This is also done via the "MeanCI" function from the "DescTools" package.

```{r MeanCI2, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract mean CIs
MeanCI(wordstb$Frequency, method="boot", type="norm", R=1000)
``` 

Because this is a data-driven approach, the results will vary, depending on the characteristics of the resampled data. To illustrate, compare the values provided above to the values generated below.

```{r MeanCIboot, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract mean CIs
MeanCI(wordstb$Frequency, method="boot", type="norm", R=1000)
```

## Confidence Intervals for Grouped Data

To extract the confidence intervals for grouped data, we can sue the "summarySE" function from the "Rmisc" package.

```{r MeanCIboot2, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# apply summarySE function to data
summarySE(data=wordstb,           
          # define variable representing frequencies
          measurevar="Frequency", 
          # define grouping variabel
          groupvars="POS",        
          # extract standard deviation, standard error, 
          # and confidence intervals
          conf.interval = 0.95)   
```  


Confidence intervals for mean by bootstrap with boot package

```{r boot, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# function to extract values
BootFunction = function(x, index) {                        
                  return(c(mean(x[index]),
                           var(x[index]) / length(index)))
}
# apply function to data
Bootstrapped = boot(data=wordstb$Frequency,                
            statistic=BootFunction,
            R=1000)
# extract values
mean(Bootstrapped$t[,1])                                   
# alternative to extract values
boot.ci(Bootstrapped, conf=0.95)                           
```  

The advantage of using bootstrapping method lies in the fact that the data is (frequently) not distributed normally which is not an issue for the bootstrapping and it will thus provide more reliable results as it does not rely on distributional assumptions about the data. 


## Confidence Intervals for Nominal Data

We now turn to confidence intervals for nominal data [see also @thomas1975confidence]. When dealing with nominal data, confidence intervals can be determined with the "binom.test" function in the in-built "stats" package. Alternative methods are available via the "BinomCI" and "MultinomCI" functions from the "DescTools" package.  More advanced techniques for confidence intervals on nominal data are available via the "PropCIs" package.

```{r cinominal, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
binom.test(2, 20, 0.5,              # binom.test(x, n, p = 0.5, ...)
           alternative="two.sided", # define sidedness
           conf.level=0.95)         # define confidence level
```  

Another way to use the "binom.test" function is shown below.

```{r cinominal2, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Input =("
 Paw
 right
 left
 right
 right
 right
 right
 left
 right
 right
 right  
")

Gus = read.table(textConnection(Input),header=TRUE)

Successes = sum(Gus$ Paw == "left")      # Note the == operator
Failures  = sum(Gus$ Paw == "right")

Total = Successes + Failures

Expected = 0.5

binom.test(Successes, Total, Expected,
           alternative="two.sided",
           conf.level=0.95)

```  
 
 
 
```{r cinominal3, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract CIs                  
BinomCI(2, 20,                        # apply BinomCI function
        conf.level = 0.95,            # define ci
        method = "modified wilson")   # define method for ci extraction
```  

Other methods: "wilson", "wald", "agresti-coull", "jeffreys", "modified wilson", "modified jeffreys", "clopper-pearson", "arcsine", "logit", "witting". 

## Confidence Intervals for Multinomial Data

We use the "MultinomCI" function to extract the confidence intervals form multinominal data.

```{r multinominal, echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
observed = c(35,74,22,69)       # define multinominal vector
MultinomCI(observed,            # apply MultinomCI function
           conf.level=0.95,     # define ci
           method="goodman")    # define method for ci extraction
```
