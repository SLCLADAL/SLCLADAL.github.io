# Introduction

This section focuses set up an "R"-Project and how to prepare working in "R" more generally.

# Preparation

As the following sections briefly introduce "R"-Projects and how to set up an "R" session, it is necessary to install "R", "RStudio", and "Tinn-R". If these programms (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not installed yet, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain "libraries" need to be installed so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the libraries needed for running the code below. If you have already installed the libraries mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary libraries, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
# install libraries
install.packages(c(""))
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.
