# Introduction

This tutorial introduces creating (web) applications in "R". The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/appsrscript.r).

# Preparation and session set up

As all visualizations in this tutorial rely on "R", it is necessary to install "RStudio" (a programm which makes working with R particularly user-friendly). If "RStudio" is not already installed on your machine, please search for "RStudio" in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory). Once you have installed "RStudio", open it.

In addition, we prepare our session by clearing the workspace, setting options, and installing certain "libraries" or "packages" that we need in this tutorial. Thus, please install the libraries by running the code below this paragraph (simply copy and paste the code into the editor window of RStudio and select "Run" from the task bar above) - the installation may take some time (depending on the number and the nature of the libraries it may take a couple of minutes).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("shiny"))
```

Once these libraries are installed, you are good to go.    

# Getting started with Shiny

The most basic way to display geospatial data is to simply download and display a map. In order to do that, we load the libraries neccessary for extracting and plotting the map, before we can go ahead and actually extracting and ploting the map. 

```{r shy1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(shiny)
# create user interface
ui <- fluidPage()
# determine server action
server <- function(input, output)
# combine ui and server with shiny
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

```{r shy2, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(shiny)
# create user interface
ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "num",
              label = "Choose a number",
              value = 25, min = 1, max = 100),
  plotOutput("hist")
)
# determine server action
server <- function(input, output){
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$num))
  })
}
# combine ui and server with shiny
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


```{r uq2, echo=F, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/uq2.jpg")
```
