# Introduction

This tutorial focuses on questionnaires and surveys. The "R"-code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/questionnairesrscript.r).

Questionnaires and surveys are widely used in language research and thus one of the most common research designs. In this section, we will discuss what needs to kept in mind when designing questionaires and surveys, what pieces of software or plattforms one can use, options for visualizing questionnaire and survey data, statistical methods that are used to evaluate questionnaire and survey data (reliability), and which statistical methods are used in analyzing the data.

# What is a questionnaire?

Questionaires are also referred to as surveys, inventories, forms, tests, batteries, checklists, scales, etc. They do not necessarily focus on questions and they do not test knowledge: there are no right or wrong answers.

“Questionnaires are any written instruments that present respondents with a series of  questions or statements to which they are to react either by writing out their answers or selecting among existing answers.”  (Brown, 2001, p 6)

Questionaires elicit three types of data:

* Factual 
* Behavioral
* Attitudinal

While factual and behavioural data about what the respondent is and does, attitudinal data aim to tap into what the respondent thinks or feels.
