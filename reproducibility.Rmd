# Introduction{-}

This tutorial introduces basic data management techniques, version control measures, and issues relating to reproducible research. The entire R markdown document for this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/reproducibility.html). In data science or when working with data more generally, issues relating to organizing organizing files and folders, managing data and projects, avoiding data loss, and efficient work flows are essential. The idea behind this tutorial is to address this issue and provide advice on how to handle data and creating efficient workflows. 

Some of the contents of this tutorial build on the [*Digital Essentials module*](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/research-tools-techniques/digital-essentials) that is offered by the UQ library, the *Reproducible Research resources* (created by Griffith University’s Library and eResearch Services), and on Amanda Miotto's [Reproducible Reseach Things](https://github.com/amandamiotto/Reproducible-Research-Things). You can find additional information on all things relating to computers, the digital world, and computer safety in the [*Digital Essentials* course](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/research-tools-techniques/digital-essentials) that is part of UQ's library resources.

# Data Management{-}

This section introduces some basic concepts and provides useful tips for managing your research data.

## Folder structure{-}

The UQ Library offers the [Digital Essentials module Working with Files](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/research-tools-techniques/digital-essentials/working-with-files). This module contains information on storage options, naming conventions, back up options, metadata, and file formats. Some of these issues are dealt with below but the materials provided by the library offer a more extensive introduction into these topics.

There are various ways in which you can organize your folders. All of these ways to organize your folders have different advantages and problems but they all have in common that they rely on a tree-structure - more general folders contain more specialized ones. For example, if you want to find any file with as few clicks as possible, an alphabetical folder structure would be a good solution. Organized in this way, everything that starts with a certain letter will be stored by its initial letter (e.g. everything starting with a "t" such as "travel" under "T" or everything related to your "courses" under "C"). However, organizing your data alphabetically is not intuitive and completely unrelated topics will be located in the same folder.

A more common and intuitive way to organize your data is to separate your data into meaningful aspects of your life such as Work (containing, e.g., *teaching* and *research*), Living (including *rent*, *finances*, and *insurances*), and Media (including *Movies*, *Music*, and *Audiobooks*). 

## Naming conventions{-} 

A File Naming Convention (FNC) is a framework or protocol if you like for naming your files in a way that describes what files contain and importantly, how they relate to other files. It is essential prior to collecting data to establish an agreed FNC.

Folders (as well as files) should be labelled in a meaningful way. This means that you avoid names like *Stuff* or *Document* for folders and *doc2* or *homework* for files. 

Naming files consistently, logically and in a predictable manner will prevent against unorganized files, misplaced or lost data. It could also prevent possible backlogs or project delays. A file naming convention will ensure files are:

* Easier to process - All team members won't have to over think the file naming process

* Easier to facilitate access, retrieval and storage of files

* Easier to browse through files saving time and effort

* Harder to lose!

* Check for obsolete or duplicate records

The *University of Edinburgh* has a comprehensive and easy to follow list (with examples and explanations) of [13 Rules for file naming conventions](https://www.ed.ac.uk/records-management/guidance/records/practical-guidance/naming-conventions). You can also use the recommendations of the 

*Australian National Data Services* (ANDS) [guide of file wrangling](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/data-management/file-wrangling). Some of the suggestions are summarized below.

Like the different conventions for folders, there are different conventions for files. As a general rule, any special character symbols, such as +, !, ", -, ., ö, ü, ä, %, &, (, ), [, ], &, $, =, ?, ', #, or / but also including white spaces, should be avoided (while _ is also a special character, it is still common practice to include them in file names for readability). One reason for this is that you will may encounter problems when sharing files if you avoid white spaces and special characters. Also, some software applications automatically replace or collapse white spaces. A common practice to avoid this issue is to capitalize initial letters in file names which allows you avoid white spaces. An example would be *TutorialIntroComputerSkills* or *Tutorial_IntroComputerSkills*.

When you want to include time-stamps in file names, the best way to do this is to use the YYYYMMDD format (rather than DDMMYYYY or even D.M.YY). The reason is that if dates are added this way, the files can be easily sorted in ascending or descending order. To elaborate on the examples shown before, we may use *TutorialIntroComputerSkills20200413* or *Tutorial_IntroComputerSkills_20200413*

**For Beginners**

* Let's look at some easy naming convention for your data files and documents. Any dates are best stored with YYYY-MM-DD. Try to avoid spaces in your file names

**For Intermediates**

* Make sure you follow [13 Rules for file naming conventions](https://www.ed.ac.uk/records-management/guidance/records/practical-guidance/naming-conventions)

**For Advanced file namers**

* Do you have a policy in your team/section/cluster around naming conventions? If not, this is a great way of getting everyone on the same page.

## Documentation and the Bus Factor{-}

Documentation is the idea of documenting your work so that outsiders (or yourself after a long time) can understand what you did and how you did it. As a general rule, you should document where to find what as if you informed someone else how to find stuff on your computer.

Documentation can include where your results and data are saved but it can also go far beyond this. Documentation does not have to be complex and it can come in different forms, depending on your needs and your work. Documenting what you do can also include photos, word documents with descriptions, or websites that detail how you work. 

The idea behind documentation is to keep a log of the contents of folders so that you at a later point in time or someone else can continue your work in case you or someone else is run over by a bus (hence the Bus Factor). 

In fact, documentation is all about changing the Bus Factor - how many people on a project would need to be hit by a bus to make a project fail. Many times, projects can have a bus factor of one. Adding documentation means when someone goes on leave, needs to take leave suddenly or finishes their study, their work is preserved for your project.

If you work in a collaborative project, it is especially useful to have a log of where one can find relevant information and who to ask for help with what. Ideally you want to document anything that someone coming on board would need to know. Thus, if you have not created a log for on-boarding, the perfect person to create a log would be the last person who joined the project. Although there is no fixed rule, it is recommendable to store the log either as a ReadMe document or in a ReadMe folder on the top level of the project.

**For Beginners**

* Read this first: [How to start Documenting and more by CESSDA ERIC](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata)

* Start with documenting in a text file or document- any start is a good start

* Have this document automatically synced to the cloud with your data or keep this in a shared place such as *Google docs*, *Microsoft teams*, or *Owncloud*. If you collaborate on a project and use UQ’s RDM, you should store a copy of your documentation there.

**For Intermediates**

* Once you have the basics in place, go into detail on how your workflow goes from your raw data to the finished results. This can be anything from a detailed description of how you analyse your data, over R Notebooks, to downloaded function lists from Virtual Lab.

**For Advanced documentarians**

* Learn about Git Repositories and wikis.

## Keep copies{-}

Keeping a copy of all your data (working, raw and completed) in the cloud is incredibly important. This ensures that if you have a computer failure, accidentally delete your data or your data is corrupted, your research is recoverable and restorable. 

**The 3-2-1 backup rule**

Try to have at least three copies of your project that are in different locations. The rule is: keep at least three (3) copies of your data, and store two (2) backup copies on different storage media, with one (1) of them located offsite. Although this is just a personal preference, I always safe my projects 

* on my personal notebook

* on at least one additional hard drive (that you keep in a secure location)

* in an online repository (for example, UQ's [*Research Data Management system (RDM)*](https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm) *OneDrive*, *MyDrive*, *GitHub*, or *GitLab*)

Using online repositories ensures that you do not lose any data in case your computer crashes (or in case you spill lemonade over it - don't ask...) but it comes at the cost that your data can be more accessible to (criminal or other) third parties. Thus, if you are dealing with sensitive data, I suggest to store it on an additional external hard drive and do not keep cloud-based back-ups. If you trust tech companies with your data (or think that they are not interested in stealing your data), cloud-based solutions such as *OneDrive*, Google's *MyDrive*, or *Dropbox* are ideal and easy to use options (however,  [UQ's RDM](https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm) is a safer option). 

The UQ library also offers additional information on complying with ARC and NHMRC data management plan requirements and that [UQ RDM](https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm) meets these requirements for sensitive data (see [here](https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/for-researchers/uq-research-data-manager/faqs-complying-with-policy-and-requirements)).

**For Beginners**

* Get your data into [UQ's RDM](http://rdm.uq.edu.au/) or Cloud Storage - If you need help, talk to the library or your tech/eResearch/QCIF Support

**For Advanced backupers**

* Build a policy for your team or group on where things are stored. Make sure the location of your data is saved in your documentation


## Avoid duplicates{-}

Many of the files on our computers have several duplicates or copies on the same machine. Optimally, each file should only be stored once (on one machine). Thus, to minimize the superfluous files on your computer, we can delete any duplicates of files. You can, of course, do that manually but a better way to do this is to use programs that detect files that are identical in name, file size, and date of creation. One of these programs is the [Douplicate Cleaner](https://www.duplicatecleaner.com/). A tutorial on how to use it can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqutzFSkVCE).  

## How to organize projects{-}

This section focuses on how to organize your projects and how to use your computer in doing so. 

**Project folder design**

Having a standard folder structure can keep your files neat and tidy and save you time looking for data. It can also help if you are sharing files with colleagues and having a standard place to put working data and documentation.

Store your projects in a separate folder. For instance, if you are creating a folder for a research project, create the project folder within a separate *project* folder that is within a *research* folder. If you are creating a folder for a course, create the course folder within a *courses* folder within a *teaching* folder, etc.

Whenever you create a folder for a new project, try to have a set of standard folders. For example, when I create research project folders, I always have folders called *archive*, *datatable*, and *images*. When I create course folders, I always have folders called *slides*, *assignments*, *exam*, *studentmaterials*, and *correspondence*. However, you are, of course, free to modify and come up or create your own basic project design. Also, by prefixing the folder names with numbers, you can force your files to be ordered by the steps in your workflow.

* Having different sub folders allows you to avoid having too many files and many different file types in a single folder. Folders with many different files and file types tend to be chaotic and can be confusing. In addition, I have one ReadMe file on the highest level (which only contains folders except for this one single file) in which I describe very briefly what the folder is about and which folders contain which documents as well as some basic information about the folder (e.g. why and when I created it). This ReadMe file is intended both for me as a reminder what this folder is about and what it contains but also for others in case I hand the project over to someone else who continues the project or for someone who takes over my course and needs to use my materials.  

If you work in a team or share files and folders regularly, it makes sense to develop a logical structure for your team, you need to consider the following points:

* Check to make sure there are no pre-existing folder structure agreements

* Name folders appropriately and in a meaningful manner. Don't use staff names and consider using the type of work

* Consistency - make sure you use the agreed structure/hierarchy

* Structure folders hierarchically - start with a limited number of folders for the broader topics, and then create more specific folders within these

* Separate ongoing and completed work - as you start to create lots of folders and files, it is a good idea to start thinking about separating your older documents from those you are currently working on

* Backup – ensure folders and files are backed up and retrievable in the event of a disaster. UQ like most universities, have safe storage solutions.

* Clean up folders and files post project.

**For Beginners**

* Pick some of your projects and illustrate how you currently organize your files. See if you can devise a better naming convention or note one or two improvements you could make to how you name your files.

* There are some really good folder template shapes around. [Here is one](http://nikola.me/) you can download.

**For Advanced Folder designers**

* Come up with a policy for your team for folder structures. You could create a template and put it in a downloadable location for them to get them started.

## How to organize data{-}

This section will elaborate on who to organize and handle (research) data and introduce some basic principles that may help you to keep your data tidy.

**Never delete data!**

* The first thing to keep in mind when dealing with data is to keep at least one copy of the original data. The original data should never be deleted but, rather, you should copy the data and delete only sections of the copy while retaining the original data intact. 

**Tips for sensitive data**

* Sensitive data are data that can be used to identify an individual, species, object, or location that introduces a risk of discrimination, harm, or unwanted attention. Major, familiar categories of sensitive data are: personal data - health and medical data - ecological data that may place vulnerable species at risk.

**Separating identifying variables from your data**

* Separating or deidentifying your data has the purpose to protect an individual's privacy. According to the Australian Privacy Act 1988, "personal information is deidentified if the information is no longer about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable". Deidentified information is no longer considered personal information and can be shared. More information on the Commonwealth Privacy Act can be located [here](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00979).

* Deidentifying aims to allow data to be used by others for publishing, sharing and reuse without the possibility of individuals/location being re-identified. It may also be used to protect the location of archaeological findings, cultural data of location of endangered species.

* Any identifiers (name, date of birth, address or geospatial locations etc) should be removed from main data set and replaced with a code/key. The code/key is then preferably encrypted and stored separately. By storing deidentified data in a secure solution, you are meeting safety, controlled, ethical, privacy and funding agency requirements.

* Re-identifying an individual is possible by recombining the deidentifiable data set and the identifiers.

**Australian practical guidance for Deidentification (ARDC)**

* Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) formerly known as Australian National Data Service (ANDS) released a fabulous guide on Deidentification. The Deidentification guide is intended for researchers who own a data set and wish to share safely with fellow researchers or for publishing of data. The guide can be located [here](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/de-identifying-data).

**Nationally available guidelines for handling sensitive data**  

* The *Australian Government’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner* (OAIC) and CSIRO Data61 have released a *Deidentification Decision Making Framework*, which is a “practical guide to deidentification, focusing on operational advice”. The guide will assist organisations that handle personal information to deidentify their data effectively.

* The OAIC also provides [high-level guidance](https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/guides/de-identification-and-the-privacy-act) on deidentification of data and information, outlining what deidentification is, and how it can be achieved. 

* The [Australian Government’s guidelines for the disclosure of health information](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data), includes techniques for making a data set non-identifiable and example case studies. 

* Australian Bureau of Statistics’ National Statistical Service Handbook. Chapter 11 contains a summary of methods to maintain privacy.

* med.data.edu.au gives [information about anonymisation](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data) 

* The Office of the Information Commissioner Queensland’s guidance on deidentification techniques can be found [here](https://www.oic.qld.gov.au/guidelines/for-government/guidelines-privacy-principles/applying-the-privacy-principles/privacy-and-de-identification) 

**Tips for managing deidentification (ARDC)**

* Plan deidentification early in the research as part of your data management planning

* Retain original unedited versions of data for use within the research team and for preservation

* Create a deidentification log of all replacements, aggregations or removals made

* Store the log separately from the deidentified data files

* Identify replacements in text in a meaningful way, e.g. in transcribed interviews indicate replaced text with [brackets] or use XML mark-up tags.

**Management of identifiable data (ARDC)**

Data may often need to be identifiable (i.e. contains personal information) during the process of research, e.g. for analysis. If data is identifiable then ethical and privacy requirements can be met through access control and data security. This may take the form of:

* Control of access through physical or digital means (e.g. passwords)

* Encryption of data, particularly if it is being moved between locations

* Ensuring data is not stored in an identifiable and unencrypted format when on easily lost items such as USB keys, laptops and external hard drives.

* Taking reasonable actions to prevent the inadvertent disclosure, release or loss of sensitive personal information.

**Safely sharing sensitive data guide (ARDC)**

* ANDS' Deidentification Guide collates a selection of Australian and international practical guidelines and resources on how to deidentify data sets. You can find more information about deidentification [here](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/737211/De-identification.pdf) and information about safely sharing sensitive data [here](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/sharing-sensitive-data).

## How to minimize storage space{-}

Most people use or rely on data that comes in spreadsheets and use software such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc. However, spreadsheets produced by these software applications take up a lot of storage space. 

* One way to minimize the space, that your data takes up, is to copy the data and paste it into a simple editor or txt-file. The good thing about txt files is that they take up only very little space and they can be viewed easily so that you can open the file to see what the data looks like. You could then delete the spread sheet because you can copy and paste the content of the txt file right back into a spread sheet when you need it. 


## Data as publications{-}

More recently, regarding data as a form of publications has gain a lot of traction. This has the advantage that it rewards researchers who put a lot of work into compiling data and it has created an incentive for making data available, e.g. for replication. The UQ RDM and UQ eSpace can help with the [process of publishing a dataset](https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/publish-a-dataset-with-uqrdm-and-uq-espace).

**Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Persistent identifier (PiD)**

Once you've completed your project, help make your research data discoverable, accessible and possibly re-usable using a PiD such as a DOI! A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned by either a publisher, organisation or agency that identifies content and provides a PERSISTENT link to its location on the internet, whether the object is digital or physical. It might look something like this http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/01/4F8E15A1B4D89. 

DOIs are also considered a type of persistent identifiers (PiDs). An identifier is any label used to name some thing uniquely (whether digital or physical). URLs are an example of an identifier. So are serial numbers, and personal names. A persistent identifier is guaranteed to be managed and kept up to date over a defined time period.

Journal publishers assign DOIs to electronic copies of individual articles. DOIs can also be assigned by an organisation, research institutes or agencies and are generally managed by the relevant organisation and relevant policies. DOIs not only uniquely identify research data collections, it also supports citation and citation metrics.

A DOI will also be given to any data set published in UQ eSpace, whether added manually or uploaded from [UQ RDM](https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm). For information on how cite data, have a look [here](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/node/4128/5#5).

**Key points**

* DOIs are a persistent identifier and as such carry expectations of curation, persistent access and rich metadata

* DOIs can be created for DATA SETS and associated outputs (e.g. grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc) - DOIs for data are equivalent with DOIs for other scholarly publications

* DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both metrics and altmetrics)

* Resolvable DOIs provide easy online access to research data for discovery, attribution and reuse

**For Beginners** 

* Ensure data you associate with a publication has a DOI- your library is the best group to talk to for this.

**For Intermediates**

* Learn more about how your DOI can potentially increase your citation rates by watching this 4m:51s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqtiY7oZ6k&feature=youtu.be)

* Learn more about how your DOI can potentially increase your citation rate by reading the [ANDS Data Citation Guide](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/data-citation-awareness)

**For Advanced identifiers**

* Learn more about [PiDs and DOIs](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/persistent-identifiers-awareness)

* Contact the Library for advice on how to obtain a DOI upon project completion.

* Have a look at [ANDS/ARDC - Citation and Identifiers](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/citation-and-identifiers)

* Check out the [DOI system for research data](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/doi)

## Tidy data principles{-}

The same (underlying) data can be represented in multiple ways. The following three tables are show the same data but in different ways.

```{r introcmp01, eval = F, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages(tidyr)
install.packages(gapminder)
```

```{r introcmp02, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)
countries <- c("Afghanistan", "Australia", "China", "Germany", "Tanzania")
Table <- gapminder %>%
  dplyr::select(country, year, continent, lifeExp) %>%
  dplyr::filter(year == 2007 | year == 2002,
                country %in% countries)
```


```{r introcmp03, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
Table1 <- Table %>%
  tidyr::spread(year, lifeExp)
kable(Table1, caption = "Table 1.")
```

```{r introcmp04, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Table2 <- Table %>%
  dplyr::mutate(country = paste(country, " (", continent, ")", sep = "")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-continent) %>%
  tidyr::spread(country, lifeExp)
kable(Table2, caption = "Table 2.")
```

```{r introcmp05, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Table5 <- Table
kable(Table5, caption = "Table 3.")
```

Table 3 should be the easiest to parse and understand. This is so because only Table 3 is *tidy*. Unfortunately, however, most data that you will encounter will be untidy. There are two main reasons:

* Most people aren’t familiar with the principles of tidy data, and it’s hard to derive them yourself unless you spend a lot of time working with data.

* Data is often organised to facilitate some use other than analysis. For example, data is often organised to make entry as easy as possible.

This means that for most real analyses, you’ll need to do some tidying. The first step is always to figure out what the variables and observations are. Sometimes this is easy; other times you’ll need to consult with the people who originally generated the data. The second step is to resolve one of two common problems:

* One variable might be spread across multiple columns.

* One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

To avoid structuring in ways that make it harder to parse, there are three interrelated principles which make a data set tidy:

* Each variable must have its own column.

* Each observation must have its own row.

* Each value must have its own cell.

An additional advantage of tidy data is that is can be transformed more easily into any other format when needed.
