# Introduction

This tutorial introduces mixed-effects regression modelling using "R". The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/mixedregressionsrscript.r).

Mixed-effects models are rapidly increasing in use in data analysis because they allow us to incorporate hierarchical or nested data structures. Mixed-effects models are, of course, an extension of fixed-effects regression models and also multivariate and come in different types. 

In contrast to fixed-effects regression models, mixed-effects models are not simple additive models because they are based on complex matrix multiplications where predicted values represent the product of the random effects multiplied by the intercept values plus the estimates of the fixed effects component in the model. 

In the following, we will go over the most relevant and frequently used types of mixed-effect regression models, mixed-effects linear regression models and mixed-effects binomial logistic regression models. 

The major difference between these types of models is that they take different types of dependent variables. While linear models take numeric dependent variables, logistic models take nominal variables.

# Preparation and session set up

As all calculations and visualizations in this tutorial rely on "R", it is necessary to install "R", "RStudio", and "Tinn-R". If these programs (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not already installed on your machine, please search for them in your favourite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain "libraries" or "packages" need to be installed so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the libraries by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the libraries mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary libraries, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("RLRsim", "nlme", "lme4", "Hmisc", "RLRsim", 
                   "sjPlot", "visreg", "mlogit", "plyr", "rms", 
                   "ggplot2", "effects", "lme4", "languageR", "Hmisc"))
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.


# Linear Mixed-Effects Regression Models \label{mem}

The following focuses on an extension of ordinary multiple linear regressions: mixed-effects regression linear regression. Mixed-effects models have the following advantages over simpler statistical tests: 

* Mixed-effects models are multivariate, i.e. they test the effect of several predictors simultaneously while controlling for the effect of all other predictors. 

* Mixed models allow to statistically incorporate within-speaker variability and are thus fit to model hierarchical data structures. 

* Mixed-models provide a wealth of diagnostic statistics which enables us to control e.g. multicollinearity, i.e. correlations between predictors, and to test whether conditions or requirements are violated (e.g. homogeneity of variance, etc.). 

Major disadvantages of mixed-effects regression modelling are that they are prone to producing Î²-errors (cf. Johnson 2009) and that they require rather large data sets. 

## Introduction 

So far, the regression models that we have used only had fixed-effects. having only fixed-effects means that all data points are treated as if they are completely independent and thus on the same hierarchical level. However, it is very common, that the data is nested in the sense that data points are not independent because they are, for instance produced by the same speaker or are grouped by some other characteristic. In such cases, the data is considered hierarchical and statistical models should incorporate such structural features of the data they work upon. With respect to regression modelling, hierarchical structures are incorporated by what is called *random effects*. When models only have a fixed-effects structure, then they make use of only a single intercept and/or slope (as in the left panel in the figure below), while mixed effects models have intercepts for each level of a random effect. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this would mean that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and or slope for each speaker. 

```{r lmm1, echo=F, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# random intercepts and random slops
x <- 0:10
y = 0:10
# start plot
par(mfrow = c(1, 4))
# intercepts

```


*Random Effects* have two parameters: the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis) and the slope (the acclivity of the regression line). In contrast to fixed-effects models have only 1 intercept and one slope (left panel of the Figure above) while mixed-effects models can have various *random intercepts* (centre left panel \ref{fig:mem02}) or various *random slopes* (centre right panel \ref{fig:mem02}), or both, various *random intercepts* and various *random slopes* (right panel \ref{fig:mem02}). In the following, we will only focus on models with random intercepts because this is the by far more common method and because including both random intercepts and random slopes requires huge amounts of data. Consider the Figure below to understand what is meant by "random intercepts".

```{r lmm2, eval=T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Height <- c(169, 176, 164, 160, 158, 173, 166, 161, 180, 187, 170, 177, 163, 161, 157)
Weight <- c(68, 72, 65, 62, 60, 80, 75, 70, 85, 92, 88, 92, 85, 82, 80) # plot scatterplot and the regression line
z <- c("a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "c", "c")
tb <- data.frame(Height,Weight, z)
a <- tb[z == "a", ]
a <- a[, 1:2]
b <- tb[z == "b", ]
b <- b[, 1:2]
c <- tb[z == "c", ]
c <- c[, 1:2]
d <- tb[, 1:2]
# plot
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
# plot 1
plot(a, xlim = c(150, 200), ylim = c(50, 100))
text(b[,1], b[,2], "+")
text(c[,1], c[,2], "*")
# plot 2
plot(a, xlim = c(150, 200), ylim = c(50, 100))
mod0 <- lm(d$Weight ~ d$Height, data = d)
abline(mod0, lty=1, col = "black")
text(b[,1], b[,2], "+")
text(c[,1], c[,2], "*")
# plot 3
plot(a, xlim = c(150, 200), ylim = c(50, 100))
grid()
mod1 <- lm(a$Weight ~ a$Height, data = a)
abline(mod0, lty=1, col = "black")
abline(mod0[[1]][[1]]+10, mod0[[1]][[2]], lty = 2, col = "red")
abline(mod0[[1]][[1]]-10, mod0[[1]][[2]], lty = 3, col = "blue")
abline(mod0[[1]][[1]]-1, mod0[[1]][[2]], lty = 4, col = "green")
text(b[,1], b[,2], "+")
text(c[,1], c[,2], "*")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

```

The left panel merely shows the data while the centre panel includes the regression line for a regression that estimates Weight based on Height. The right panel shows the regression line and, in addition, random intercepts each of the three groups.

After adding random intercepts, predictors (or fixed effects) are added to the model (just like with multiple regression). So mixed-effects are called mixed-effects because they contain both random and fixed effects.

In terms of general procedure, random effects are added first, and only after we have ascertained that including random effects is warranted, we test whether including fixed-effects is warranted [@field2012discovering]. We test whether including random effects is warranted by comparing a model, that bases its estimates of the depended variable solely on the base intercept (the mean), with a model, that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the intercepts of the random effect. If the random-effect model explains significantly more variance than the simple model without random effect structure, then we continue with the mixed-effects model. In other words, including random effects is justified if they reduce residual deviance.

## Example: Preposition Use across Time by Genre

To explore how to implement a mixed-effects model in "R" we revisit the preposition data that contains relative frequencies of prepositions in English texts written between 1150 and 1913. As a first step, and to prepare our analysis, we load necessary "R" packages, specify options, and load as well as provide an overview of the data.

```{r lmm3, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# activate packages
library(car)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lme4)
library(nlme)
library(RLRsim)
# load functions
source("https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/multiplot_ggplot2.r")
# set options
# supress scientific notation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4)      
# do not convert strings into factors
options(stringsAsFactors = F)              
# read in data
lmmdata <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/lmmdata.txt", header = TRUE) %>%
# convert date into a numeric variable
    dplyr::mutate(Date = as.numeric(Date))
# inspect updated data set
head(lmmdata); nrow(lmmdata) 
```

The data set contains the date when the text was written (Date), the genre of the text (Genre), the name of the text (Text), the relative frequency of prepositions in the text (Prepositions), and the region in which the text was written (Region). We now plot the data to get a first impression of its structure.

```{r lmm4, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# visualize variables (2 plots per row)
# 3 plots in 1 window
def.par <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
nf <- layout(matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 3), 2, 2, byrow = T))
plot(lmmdata$Prepositions ~ lmmdata$Date, ylab = "Frequency", xlab = "Year of publication", ylim = c(0, 200))
abline(lm(lmmdata$Prepositions ~ lmmdata$Date), lty = 3, lwd = 2, col = "red")
# re-set margins to fit the labels
par(mar = c(7.2, 4, 1, 2) + 0.1)
# reorder Genre by median
Genrebymedian <- with(lmmdata, reorder(Genre, -Prepositions, median))
#	generate plots
plot(lmmdata$Prepositions ~ Genrebymedian,
  col = "lightgrey",
  ylab = "Frequency",
  xlab = "",
  las = 2,
  cex.axis = .7,
  cex = .5,
  ylim = c(0,200))
# re-set margins
par(mar = c(5, 4, 1, 2) + 0.1)
x = lmmdata$Prepositions
h = hist(lmmdata$Prepositions,
	ylim =c(0, 200),
	xlim = c(50, 200),
	xlab = "Prepositions per text",
	col = "lightgrey",
	main = "")
xfit <- seq(min(lmmdata$Prepositions), max(lmmdata$Prepositions), length = 40)
yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean = mean(lmmdata$Prepositions),sd = sd(lmmdata$Prepositions))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
lines(xfit, yfit, lty = 2, lwd=2); par(def.par)# restore original graphic's parameters
```

The scatter plot in the upper panel indicates that the use of prepositions has moderately increased over time while the boxplots in the lower left panel show that the genres differ quite substantially with respect to their median frequencies of prepositions per text. Finally, the histogram in the lower right panel show that preposition use is distributed normally with a mean of 132.2 prepositions per text. 

```{r lmm5, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot 8
p8 <- ggplot(lmmdata, aes(Date, Prepositions)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year") +
  labs(y = "Prepositions per 1,000 words") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")  + 
  theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 10))
# plot 9
p9 <- ggplot(lmmdata, aes(Region, Prepositions)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Region") +
  labs(y = "Prepositions per 1,000 words") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") # with linear model smoothing!
# include genre (lowess)
multiplot(p8, p9, cols = 2)
```

```{r lmm6, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(lmmdata, aes(Date, Prepositions)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Genre, nrow = 4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year") +
  labs(y = "Prepositions per 1,000 words") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 220))
```

Centring or scaling numeric variables is useful for later interpretation of regression models: if the date variable was not centred, the regression would show the effects of variables at year 0(!). If numeric variables are scaled, other variables are variables are considered relative not to 0 but to the mean of that variable (in this case the mean of years in our data). Centring simply means that the mean of the numeric variable is subtracted from each value.

```{r lmm7, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lmmdata$Date <- scale(lmmdata$Date, scale = F)
# inspect data
head(lmmdata); str(lmmdata)
```

We now set up a fixed-effects model with the "glm" function and a mixed-effects model using the "glmer" function with Genre as a random effect.

```{r lmm8, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# generate models
m0.glm <- glm(Prepositions ~ 1, family = gaussian, data = lmmdata)
m0.glmer = glmer(Prepositions ~ 1 + (1|Genre), data = lmmdata, family = "gaussian", REML = F)
```

Now that we have created the base-line models, we will test whether including a random effect structure is mathematically justified. It is important to note here that we are not going to test if including a random effect structure is theoretically motivated but simply if it causes a decrease in variance.


## Testing Random Effects

As a first step in the modelling process, we now need to determine whether or not including a random effect structure is justified. We do so by comparing the base-line model without random intercepts to the model with random intercepts using a Likelihood Ratio Test. A short word of warning is in order here regarding the specific of the model: we need to set "REML = T" because Relative Estimate Maximum Likelihood (REML) provides better estimates for the random effects part of the model compared with the simpler Maximum Likelihood (ML) specification [@field2012discovering 879]. 


```{r lmm9, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x2 = -2*logLik(m0.glm, REML = T)+2*logLik(m0.glmer, REML = T)
x2 <- x2 <- x2[[1]]
list(x2, pchisq(x2, df=2, lower.tail=F))
```

The inclusion of a random effect structure with random intercepts is justified based on the Likelihood Ratio Test. 

As a note on model comparisons: when we compare mixed-effects models, the REML specification must be "FALSE" or set to "method = "ML" (Maximum Likelihood)  [@field2012discovering 879]. This is because "ML" produces more accurate estimates of fixed regression parameters. In contrast, one should use "REML"  when compaing fixed to mixed models as REML produces more accurate estimates of random variances [@twisk2006multilevel]. 


## Model Fitting

After having determined that including a random effect structure is justified, we can continue by fitting the model and including diagnostics as we go. Including diagnostocs in the model fitting porcess can save time and prevent relying on modles which only turn out to be unstable if we would perform the diagnostics after the fact.

We begin fitting our model by adding Date as a fixed effect and compare this model to our mixed-effects base-line model to see if Date improved the model fit by explaining variance and if Date significantly correlates with our dependent variable (this means that the difference between the models is the effect (size) of "Date"!)


```{r lmm10, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m1.glmer <- glmer(Prepositions ~ (1|Genre) + Date, data = lmmdata, REML = T)
anova(m1.glmer, m0.glmer, test = "Chi")
```


The model with Date is the better model (significant p-value and lower AIC). The significant p-value shows that "Date" correlates significantly with "Prepositions" ($\chi^2^$(1) = 8.93, p = .0028). The $\chi^2^$ value here is labeled  "L.Ratio" and the degrees of freedom are calculated by subtracting the smaller number of DFs from the larger number of DFs.

We now test whether Region should also be part of the final minimal adequate model. The easiest way to add predicors is by using the "predict" function (it saves time and typing).

```{r lmm11, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m2.glmer <- update(m1.glmer, .~.+Region)
# compare models                
anova(m2.glmer, m1.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

Three things tell us that Region should not be included: (i) the AIC does not decrease, (ii) the BIC increases(!), and the p-value is higher than .05. This means, that we will continue fitting the model without having Region included. Well... not quite - just as a note on including variables: while Region is not significant as a main effect, it must still be included in a model if it were part of a significant interaction. To test if this is indeed the case, we fit another model with the interaction between Date and Region as predictor.

```{r lmm12, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m3.glmer <- update(m1.glmer, .~.+Region*Date)
# compare models                
anova(m3.glmer, m1.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

Again, the high p-value and the incerase in AIC and BIC show that we have found our minimal adequate model with only contains Date as a main effect. In a next step, we can inspect the final minimal adequate model, i.e. the most parsimonous (the model that explains a maximum of variance with a minimum of predictors).

```{r lmm13, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# inspect results
summary(m1.glmer)

```

## Model Diagnostics

We can now evaluate the goodness of fit of the model and check if mathematical requirements and assumptions have been violated. In a first step, we generate diagnostic plots that focus on the random effect structure.

```{r lmm14, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(m1.glmer, Genre ~ resid(.), abline = 0 ) # generate diagnostic plots
```

The plot shows that there are some outliers (points outside the boxes) and that the variability within letters is greater than in other genres we therefore examine the genres in isolation standardized residuals versus fitted values [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 175].

```{r lmm15, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(m1.glmer, resid(., type = "pearson") ~ fitted(.) | Genre, id = 0.05, adj = -0.3)
```

The plot shows the standardized residuals (or Pearson's residuals) versus fitted values and suggests that there are outliers in the data (the names elements in the plots). We create a new model which uses weights to compensate for inheterogeneity of variance and thus the influence of outliers - which is an alternative to removing the data points and rerunning the analysis [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 177]. However, to do so, we need to use a different function (the "lmer" function) which measn that we have to create two models: the "old" minimal adequate model and the "new" minimal adequate model with added weights. After we have created these models, we will compare them to see if including weights has improved the fit.

```{r lmm16, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m4.lme = lme(Prepositions ~ Date, random = ~1|Genre, data = lmmdata, method = "ML")
m5.lme <- update(m4.lme, weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | Genre))
# compare models
anova(m5.lme, m4.lme)
```

The weight model (m5.lme) that uses weights to account for unequal variance is performing significantly better than the model without weights (m4.lme) and we therefore switch to the weight model and inspect its parameters.

```{r lmm17, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# inspect results
summary(m5.lme)        
```

We can also use an ANOVA display which is more to the point. 

```{r lmm18, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anova(m5.lme)          
```

As we did before, we now check, whether the final minimal model (with weights) outperforms an intercept-only base-line model.

```{r lmm19, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# creat base-line model
m0.lme = lme(Prepositions ~ 1, random = ~1|Genre, data = lmmdata, method = "ML", weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | Genre))
anova(m5.lme, m0.lme)  # test if date is significant
```

Our final minimal adequate model with weights performs significantly better than an intercept only base-line model. Before doing the final diagnostics, we well inspect the estimates for the random effect structure to check if there are values which require further inscpection (e.g. because they are drastically different from all other values).

```{r lmm20, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract estimates and sd for fixed and random effects
intervals(m5.lme)      
```

The random effect estimates do not show any outliers or dratsically increased or decreased values which measn that the random effect structure is fine.

## Effect Sizes

We will now extract effect sizes (in the example: the effect size of date) and calculate normalized effect size measures (this effect size measure works for all fixed effects). To calculate the effect size, take the square root of the squared t-value divided by the t-value squared plus the degrees of freedom: 

r = `sqrt(t^2^/(t^2^+df))`.

A brief word of warning is in order here: only apply this function to main effects that are not involved in interactions as they are meaningless because the amount of variance explained by main effects involved in interactions is unclear [@field2012discovering 641].

```{r lmm21, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ef.lme <- function(x) {
  df <- summary(x)[[20]][6]
  t <-  summary(x)[[20]][8]
  #df <- summary(x)$tTable[, 3]
  #t <- summary(x)$tTable[, 4]
  r <- sqrt((t^2)/((t^2)+df))
  return(paste("Pearson's r = ", round(r, 3)))
  }
ef.lme(m5.lme)
```

While we have already shown that the effect of Date is significant, it is small which means that the number of prepositions per text doe snot correlate evry stribgyl with time. This suggesta that other factors athat are not included in the model also impact the frequency of prepositions (and probably more meaningfully, too). 

## Model Diagnostics 

We now create diagnostic plots. What we wish to see in the diagnostic plost is a cloud of dots in the middle of the window without . What we do not want to see is a funnel-shaped cloud because this indicates an increase of the errors/residuals with an increase of the predictor(s) (because this would indicate heteroscedasticity) [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 182].

```{r lmm22, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# start plotting
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))           # display plots in 2 rows and 2 columns
plot(m5.lme, pch = 20, col = "black", lty = "dotted")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

What a wonderful unstructured cloud - the lack of structure tells us that the model is "healthy" and does not suffer from heteroscedasticity. We will now create more diagnostic plots to find potential problems [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 21].

```{r lmm23, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# fitted values by Genre
plot(m5.lme, form = resid(., type = "p") ~ fitted(.) | Genre, abline = 0, cex = .5)

```

In contrast to the unweight model, no data points are named which indicates that the outliers do no longer have unwarrented influence on the model. Now, we check the residuals of fitted values against observed values [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 179]. What we would like to see is a straight, upwards going line.

```{r lmm24, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# residuals of fitted values against observed
qqnorm(m5.lme, pch = 20, col = "black")
```

A beautiful, straight line! The qqplot does not indicate any problems. It is, unfortunately, rather common that the dots deviate from the straight line at the very bottom or the very tp which means that the model is good at estimating values around the middle of the dependent variable but rather bad at estimating lower or higher values. Next, we check the residuals by "Genre" [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 179].

```{r lmm25, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# residuals by genre
qqnorm(m5.lme, ~resid(.) | Genre, pch = 20, col = "black" )
```

Beautiful straight lines - perfection! Now, we inspect the observed responses versus the within-group fitted values [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 178].

```{r lmm26, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# observed responses versus the within-group fitted values
plot(m5.lme, Prepositions ~ fitted(.), id = 0.05, adj = -0.3, 
     xlim = c(80, 220), cex = .8, pch = 20, col = "blue")
```

Although some data points are named, the plot does not show any structure, like a funnel, which would have been problematic.

## Reporting Results 

Before we do the write-up, we have a look at the model summayr one last time as this will provide us with at least some of the parameters that we want to report. 

```{r lmm27, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(m5.lme)
```

A mixed-effect linear regression model. which contained the genre of texts as random effect was fit to to the data. Due to presence of outliers in the data, weights were included into the model which led to a significantly imporved model fit compared to an unweight model (). The final minimal adequate model performed significantly better than an intercept-only base line model ($\chi^2^$(1): 52.87, p <.0001) and showed that the the frequency of prepositions increases significantly but only marginally with the date of composition ($\chi^2^$(2): 10.12, p: 0.0063, Pearson's $r$ =  0.172). Neither the region where the text was composed nor a higher order interaction between genre and region significantly correlated with the use of prepositions in the data. 

# Mixed-Effects Binomial Logistic Regression Models

We now turn to an extension of binomial logistic regression: mixed-effects binomial logistic regression. As is the case with linear mixed-effects models logistic mixed effects models have the following advantages over simpler statistical tests: 

* Mixed-effects models are multivariate, i.e. they test the effect of several predictors simultaneously while controlling for the effect of all other predictors. 

* Mixed models allow to statistically incorporate within-speaker variability and are thus fit to model hierarchical data structures. 

* Mixed-models provide a wealth of diagnostic statistics which enables us to control e.g. multicollinearity, i.e. correlations between predictors, and to test whether conditions or requirements are violated (e.g. homogeneity of variance, etc.). 

Major disadvantages of regression modelling are that they are prone to producing Î²-errors (cf. Johnson 2009) and that they require rather large data sets. 

## Introduction 

As is the case with linear mixed-effects models, binomial logistic mixed-effect models are multivariate analysis that treat data points as hierarchical or grouped in some way. In other words, they take into account that the data is nested in the sense that data points are produced by the same speaker or are grouped by some other characteristics. In mixed-models, hierarchical structures are modelled as *random effects*. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this means that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and/or slope for each speaker. 

*Random Effects* in linear models two parameters: the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis) and the slope (the acclivity of the regression line). In contrast to linear mixed-effects models, random effects differ in the position and the slope of the logistic function that is applied to the likelihood of the dependent variable.  *random intercepts* (centre left panel \ref{fig:mem02}) or various *random slopes* (centre right panel \ref{fig:mem02}), or both, various *random intercepts* and various *random slopes* (right panel \ref{fig:mem02}). In the following, we will only focus on models with random intercepts because this is the by far more common method and because including both random intercepts and random slopes requires huge amounts of data. Consider the Figure below to understand what is meant by "random intercepts".

The upper left panel merely shows the logistic curve representing the predictions of a fixed-effects logistic regression with a single intercept and slope. The upper right panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a of a mixed-effects logistic regression with random intercepts for each level of a grouping variable. The lower left panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a mixed-effects logistic regression with one intercept but random slopes for each level of a grouping variable. The lower right panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a mixed-effects logistic regression with random intercepts and random slopes for each level of a grouping variable.

After adding random intercepts, predictors (or fixed effects) are added to the model (just like with multiple regression). So mixed-effects are called mixed-effects because they contain both random and fixed effects.

In terms of general procedure, random effects are added first, and only after we have ascertained that including random effects is warranted, we test whether including fixed-effects is warranted [@field2012discovering]. We test whether including random effects is warranted by comparing a model, that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the base intercept, with a model that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the intercepts of the random effect. If the mixed-effects model explains significantly more variance than the fixed-effects model without random effect structure, then we continue with the mixed-effects model. In other words, including random effects is justified if they reduce residual deviance.

## Example: Discourse LIKE in Irish English

In this example we will investigate which factors correlate with the use of *final discourse like* (e.g. "*The weather is shite, like!*") in Irish English. The data set represents speech units in a corpus that were coded for the speaker who uttered a given speech unit, the gender (Gender: Men versus Women) and age of that speaker (Age: Old versus Young), whether the interlocutors were of the same or a different gender (ConversationType: SameGender  versus MixedGender), and whether another *final discourse like* had been used up to three speech units before (Priming: NoPrime versus Prime), whether or not the speech unit contained an *final discourse like* (SUFLike: 1 = yes, 0 = no. To begin with, we clean the current work space, set option, install and activate relevant packages, load customized functions, and load the example data set.

```{r blmm2, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# activate library
library(Hmisc)      
library(RLRsim)     
library(sjPlot)     
library(visreg)     
library(mlogit)     
library(rms)        
library(ggplot2)    
library(effects)    
library(lme4)       
library(languageR)
# load functions
source("rscripts/multiplot_ggplot2.R")   
source("rscripts/PseudoR2lmerBinomial.R") 
source("rscripts/meblr.summary.R")       
```

Next, we load the data and inspect the structure of the data set,


```{r blmm3, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
mblrdata <- read.table("https://slcladal.github.io/data/mblrdata.txt", 
                       comment.char = "",# data does not contain comments
                       quote = "",       # data does not contain quotes
                       sep = "\t",       # data is tab separated
                       header = T)       # data has column names
# inspect data structure
str(mblrdata)                               
```

As all variables except for the dependent variable (SUFlike) are character strings, we
factorize the independent variables.

```{r blmm4, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# def. variables to be factorized
vrs <- c("ID", "Age", "Gender", "ConversationType", "Priming")
# def. vector with variables
fctr <- which(colnames(mblrdata) %in% vrs)     
# factorize variables
mblrdata[,fctr] <- lapply(mblrdata[,fctr], factor)
# relevel Age (Young = Reference)
mblrdata$Age <- relevel(mblrdata$Age, "Young") 
```

Before continuing, we check if speakers need to be collapsed because they nest too few data points. As a general rule of thumb, random effects should have a minimum of 20 data points per level.

```{r blmm5, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(table(mblrdata$ID)[order(table(mblrdata$ID), decreasing = T)],
     ylim = c(0,150), ylab = "Frequency", cex = .5)
```

The plot indicates that the vast majority of speakers represent more than 20 cases. However, we will collapse speakers that represent fewer data points.

```{r blmm6, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
collapsespeaker <- table(mblrdata$ID)[which(table(mblrdata$ID) < 21)]
mblrdata$ID <- ifelse(mblrdata$ID %in% collapsespeaker, "Other", mblrdata$ID)
```

After preparing the data, we have a look at the first six lines of the data set.

```{r blmm7, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)    # load library
kable(head(mblrdata), caption = "First six rows of the data set.")
```

We now plot the data to inspect the relationships within the data set.

```

The upper left panel in the Figure above indicates that men sue discourse like more frequently than women. The centre right panel suggests that priming significantly increases the likelihood of discourse like being used. The centre left panel suggests that speakers use discourse like more frequently in mixed-gender conversations.  However, the lower right panel indicates an interaction between gender and conversation type as women appear to use discourse like less frequently in same gender conversations while the conversation type does not seem to have an effect on men. After visualizing the data, we will now turn to the model building process.

## Model Building

In a first step, we set the options and generate a distance matrix of the data.

```{r blmm9, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# set options
options(contrasts  =c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly"))
mblrdata.dist <- datadist(mblrdata)
options(datadist = "mblrdata.dist")
```

In a next step, we generate fixed-effects minimal base-line models and a base-line mixed-model using the "glmer" function with a random intercept for ID (a lmer object of the final minimal adequate model will be created later).

```{r blmm10, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# baseline model glm
m0.glm = glm(SUFlike ~ 1, family = binomial, data = mblrdata) 
# baseline model lrm
m0.lrm = lrm(SUFlike ~ 1, data = mblrdata, x = T, y = T) 
# base-line mixed-model
m0.glmer = glmer(SUFlike ~ (1|ID), data = mblrdata, family = binomial) 
```

## Testing the Random Effect

Now, we check if including the random effect is permitted by comparing the AICs from the glm to AIC from the glmer model. If the AIC of the glmer object is smaller than the AIC of the glm object, then this indicates that including random intercepts is justified.


```{r blmm11, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
aic.glmer <- AIC(logLik(m0.glmer))
aic.glm <- AIC(logLik(m0.glm))
aic.glmer; aic.glm
```

The AIC of the glmer object is smaller which shows that including the random intercepts is justified. To confirm whether the AIC reduction is sufficient for justifying the inclusion of a random-effect structure, we also test whether the mixed-effects minimal base-line model explains significantly more variance by applying a Model Likelihood Ratio Test to the fixed- and the mixed effects minimal base-line models.

```{r blmm12, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# test random effects
null.id = -2 * logLik(m0.glm) + 2 * logLik(m0.glmer)
pchisq(as.numeric(null.id), df=1, lower.tail=F) 
# sig m0.glmer better than m0.glm
```

The p-value of the Model Likelihood Ratio Test is lower than .05 which shows that the inclusion of the random-effects structure is warranted. We can now continue with the model fitting process.

## Model Fitting

The next step is to fit the model which means that we aim to find the "best" model, i.e. the minimal adequate model. In this case, we will use a manual step-wise step-up, forward elimination procedure.
Before we begin with the model fitting process we need to add Â´control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")Â´ to avoid unnecessary failures to converge.

```{r blmm13, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m0.glmer <- glmer(SUFlike ~ 1+ (1|ID), family = binomial, data = mblrdata, control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"))
```

During each step of the fitting procedure, we test whether certain assumptions on which the model relies are violated. To avoid *incomplete information* (a combination of variables does not occur in the data), we tabulate the variables we intend to include and make sure that all possible combinations are present in the data. Including variables although not all combinations are present in the data would lead to unreliable models that report (vastly) inaccurate results. A special case of incomplete information is *complete separation* which occurs if one predictor perfectly explains an outcome (in that case the incomplete information would be caused by a level of the dependent variable). In addition, we make sure that the VIFs do not exceed a maximum of 3 for main effects [@zuur2010protocol] - @booth1994regression suggest that VIFs should ideally be lower than 1.5 - and 20 for interactions as higher values would indicate multicollinearity and thus that the model is unstable. The value of 20 should be taken with a pinch of salt because there is no clear consensus about what the maximum VIF for interactions should be or if it should be considered at all. The reason is that we would, of course, expect the VIFs to increase when we are dealing with interactions as the main effects that are part of the interaction are very likely to correlate with the interaction itself. However, if the VIFs are too high, then this will still cause the issues with the attribution of variance. The value of 20 was chosen as it is twice the most generous value for acceptable VIFs for main effects in the standard literature on multicollinearity [@zuur2009mixedmodels, @neter1990vif]. Only once we have confirmed that the incomplete information, complete separation, and *multicollinearity* are not a major concern, we generate the more saturated model and test whether the inclusion of a predictor leads to a significant reduction in residual deviance. If the predictor explains a significant amount of variance, it is retained in the model while being disregarded in case it does not explain a sufficient quantity of variance.  

```{r blmm14, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m1.glm <- update(m0.glm, .~.+Priming)
m1.glmer <- update(m0.glmer, .~.+Priming)
anova(m1.glmer, m0.glmer, test = "Chi") 
```

Since the tests do not show problems relating to incomplete information, because including Priming significantly improves the model fit (decrease in AIC and BIC values), and since it correlates significantly with our dependent variable, we include Priming into our model.

```{r blmm15, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Age
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Age, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m2.glm <- update(m1.glm, .~.+Age)
ifelse(max(vif(m2.glm)) <= 3,  "VIFs okay", "VIFs unacceptable") 
m2.glmer <- update(m1.glmer, .~.+Age)
anova(m2.glmer, m1.glmer, test = "Chi")   
Anova(m2.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

The ANOVAs show that Age is marginally significant but, more importantly, the first ANOVA report also shows that the BIC has increased which indicates that Age does not substantially decrease variance. In such cases, the variable should not be included. A case could be made, however, if the second ANOVA would report Age as being significant but before simply continuing with the model fitting, it would be better to change the ordering in which predictors are added to the model.

```{r blmm16, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Gender
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m3.glm <- update(m1.glm, .~.+Gender)
ifelse(max(vif(m3.glm)) <= 3,  "VIFs okay", "VIFs unacceptable") 
m3.glmer <- update(m1.glmer, .~.+Gender)
anova(m3.glmer, m1.glmer, test = "Chi")
Anova(m3.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

Gender is significant and will therefore be included as a predictor (you can also observe that including Gender has substantially decreased both AIC and BIC).

```{r blmm17, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m4.glm <- update(m3.glm, .~.+ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m4.glm)) <= 3,  "VIFs okay", "VIFs unacceptable") 
m4.glmer <- update(m3.glmer, .~.+ConversationType)
anova(m4.glmer, m3.glmer, test = "Chi") 
Anova(m4.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

ConversationType improves model fit (AIC and BIC decrease and it is reported as being significant) and will, therefore, be included in the model.

```{r blmm18, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming*Age
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming, mblrdata$Age, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m5.glm <- update(m4.glm, .~.+Priming*Age)
ifelse(max(vif(m5.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!") # VIFs ok
m5.glmer <- update(m4.glmer, .~.+Priming*Age)
anova(m5.glmer, m4.glmer, test = "Chi") 
Anova(m5.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

The interaction between Priming and Age is not significant and will thus not be included.

```{r blmm19, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming*Gender
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming, mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m6.glm <- update(m4.glm, .~.+Priming*Gender)
m6.glmer <- update(m4.glmer, .~.+Priming*Gender)
anova(m6.glmer, m4.glmer, test = "Chi") 
Anova(m6.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

The interaction between Priming and Gender improved model fit (AIC and BIC reduction) and significantly correlates with the use of speech-unit final LIKE. It will therefore be included in the model.

```{r blmm20, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming*ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming, mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m7.glm <- update(m6.glm, .~.+Priming*ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m7.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!")
m7.glmer <- update(m6.glmer, .~.+Priming*ConversationType)
anova(m7.glmer, m6.glmer, test = "Chi")
Anova(m7.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

The interaction between Priming and ConversationType significantly correlates with the use of speech-unit final LIKE but it does not explain much variance (AIC and BIC increase). It will be included in the model but it will very likely have a very small or spurious effect.

```{r blmm21, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Age*Gender
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Age, mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m8.glm <- update(m7.glm, .~.+Age*Gender)
ifelse(max(vif(m8.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!")
m8.glmer <- update(m7.glmer, .~.+Age*Gender)
anova(m8.glmer, m7.glmer, test = "Chi") 
```

The interaction between Age and Gender is not significant and will thus continue without it.

```{r blmm22, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Age*ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Age, mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m9.glm <- update(m7.glm, .~.+Age*ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m9.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!") 
m9.glmer <- update(m7.glmer, .~.+Age*ConversationType)
anova(m9.glmer, m7.glmer, test = "Chi") 
```

The interaction between Age and ConversationType is not significant and will thus continue without it.

```{r blmm23, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Gender*ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m10.glm <- update(m7.glm, .~.+Gender*ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m10.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!")
m10.glmer <- update(m7.glmer, .~.+Gender*ConversationType)
anova(m10.glmer, m7.glmer, test = "Chi") 
Anova(m10.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

The interaction between Gender and ConversationType improved model fit (AIC and BIC reduction) and significantly correlates with the use of speech-unit final LIKE. It will therefore be included in the model.

```{r blmm24, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming*Age*Gender
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming,mblrdata$Age, mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m11.glm <- update(m10.glm, .~.+Priming*Age*Gender)
ifelse(max(vif(m11.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!")
m11.glmer <- update(m10.glmer, .~.+Priming*Age*Gender)
anova(m11.glmer, m10.glmer, test = "Chi") 
```

The interaction between Priming, Age and Gender is not significant and we will thus continue without it.

```{r blmm25, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming*Age*ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming,mblrdata$Age, mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m12.glm <- update(m10.glm, .~.+Priming*Age*ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m12.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!")
m12.glmer <- update(m10.glmer, .~.+Priming*Age*ConversationType)
anova(m12.glmer, m10.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

The interaction between Priming, Age and ConversationType is not significant and we will thus continue without it.

```{r blmm26, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming*Gender*ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming,mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m13.glm <- update(m10.glm, .~.+Priming*Gender*ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m13.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!")
vif(m13.glm)
m13.glmer <- update(m10.glmer, .~.+Priming*Gender*ConversationType)
anova(m13.glmer, m10.glmer, test = "Chi")
Anova(m13.glmer, test = "Chi")
```

Although the VIFs are slightly higher than 20, the maximum values is 21.643 and thus not excessive. And since the three-way interaction between Priming, Gender, and ConversationType is not only significantly correlated with the dependent variable but also decreases AIC and BIC, we will include it in the model.

```{r blmm27, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Age*Gender*ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Age,mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m14.glm <- update(m13.glm, .~.+Age*Gender*ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m14.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!")
vif(m14.glm)
```

In this case, the VIFs are excessive and have values higher than 30 which shows an unacceptable degree of multicollinearity so that we abort and move on the next model.

```{r blmm28, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# add Priming*Age*Gender*ConversationType
ifelse(min(ftable(mblrdata$Priming,mblrdata$Age,mblrdata$Gender, mblrdata$ConversationType, mblrdata$SUFlike)) == 0, "incomplete information", "okay")
m15.glm <- update(m13.glm, .~.+Priming*Age*Gender*ConversationType)
ifelse(max(vif(m15.glm)) <= 20,  "VIFs okay", "WARNING: high VIFs!") 
vif(m15.glm)
```

Again, the VIFs are excessive and have values higher than 30. As this was the last possible model, we have found our final minimal adequate model in m13.glmer.

In a next step, we create an overview of model comparisons which serves as a summary for the model fitting process and provides AIC, BIC, and $\chi$^2^ values.

```{r blmm29, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# comparisons of glmer objects
m1.m0 <- anova(m1.glmer, m0.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m2.m1 <- anova(m2.glmer, m1.glmer, test = "Chi")   
m3.m1 <- anova(m3.glmer, m1.glmer, test = "Chi")
m4.m3 <- anova(m4.glmer, m3.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m5.m4 <- anova(m5.glmer, m4.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m6.m4 <- anova(m6.glmer, m4.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m7.m6 <- anova(m7.glmer, m6.glmer, test = "Chi")
m8.m7 <- anova(m8.glmer, m7.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m9.m7 <- anova(m9.glmer, m7.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m10.m7 <- anova(m10.glmer, m7.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m11.m10 <- anova(m11.glmer, m10.glmer, test = "Chi") 
m12.m10 <- anova(m12.glmer, m10.glmer, test = "Chi")
m13.m10 <- anova(m13.glmer, m10.glmer, test = "Chi")
# create a list of the model comparisons
mdlcmp <- list(m1.m0, m2.m1, m3.m1, m4.m3, m5.m4, m6.m4, m7.m6, m8.m7, m9.m7, m10.m7, m11.m10, m12.m10, m13.m10)
# load function for summary
source("rscripts/ModelFittingSummarySWSU.R") # for GLMEM (step-wise step-up)
mdlft <- mdl.fttng.swsu(mdlcmp)
mdlft <- mdlft[,-2]
library(knitr)    # load library
kable(mdlft, caption = "Model fitting process summary.")
```

We now rename our final minimal adequate model, test whether it performs significantly better than the minimal base-line model, and print the regression summary.

```{r blmm30, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mlr.glmer <- m13.glmer # rename final minimal adequate model
mlr.glm <- m13.glm # rename final minimal adequate fixed-effects model
anova(mlr.glmer, m0.glmer, test = "Chi") # final model better than base-line model
print(mlr.glmer, corr = F) # inspect final minimal adequate model
```

To extract the effect sizes of the significant fixed effects, we compare the model with that effect to a model without that effect so that we can ascertain how much variance that effect explains. In our case, this is purely to show how to do this because main effects are superseded by interactions in which they are involved and should therefore not be interpreted [@field2012discovering 622].

```{r blmm32, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anova(m1.glmer, m0.glmer, test = "Chi") 
```

```{r blmm33, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anova(m3.glmer, m1.glmer, test = "Chi") # Gender effect
```

```{r blmm34, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anova(m4.glmer, m3.glmer, test = "Chi") #  ConversationType effect
```

## Extracting Model Fit Parameters

We now create an "lrm" and "lmer" object that are equivalent to the final minimal adequate model (but the former without the random effect).

```{r blmm35, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mlr.lrm <- lrm(SUFlike ~ Priming + Gender + ConversationType, data = mblrdata, x = T, y = T)
m1.glm = glm(SUFlike ~ Priming + Gender + ConversationType, family = binomial, data = mblrdata) # baseline model glm
# we now create a lmer object equivalent to the final minimal adequate model
mlr.lmer <- lmer(SUFlike ~ Age + Gender + ConversationType + (1|ID), data = mblrdata, family = binomial)
```


We now check on the lmer object if the fixed effects of the "lrm" and of the "lmer" model correlate [@baayen2008analyzing 281].

```{r blmm36, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cor.test(coef(mlr.lrm), fixef(mlr.lmer))
```

The fixed effects correlate strongly (.8827) which is a good indicator as it suggests that the coefficient estimates are sufficiently stable. We now activate the "Hmisc" package (if not already active) to extract model fit parameters [@baayen2008analyzing 281].

```{r blmm37, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(Hmisc)   
probs = 1/(1+exp(-fitted(mlr.lmer)))
probs = binomial()$linkinv(fitted(mlr.lmer))
somers2(probs, as.numeric(mblrdata$SUFlike))
```

The model fit parameters indicate a suboptimal fit. Both the C-value and Somers's D~xy~ show poor fit between predicted and observed occurrences of SUFlike.  If the C-value is 0.5, the predictions are random, while the predictions are perfect if the C-value is 1. C-values above 0.8 indicates real predictive capacity [@baayen2008analyzing 204]. Somersâ D~xy~ is a value that represents a rank correlation between predicted probabilities and observed responses. Somersâ D~xy~ values range between 0, which indicates complete randomness, and 1, which indicates perfect prediction [@baayen2008analyzing 204]. This a value of .2646 suggests that the model performs better than chance but not substantially so. We will now perform the model diagnostics.

## Model Diagnostics

We begin the model diagnostics by generating a diagnostic that plots the fitted or predicted values against the residuals.

```{r blmm38, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(mlr.glmer, pch = 20, col = "black", lty = "dotted")
```

Next, we examine the residuals using diagnostic plots [@pinheiro2000mixedmodels 175].

```{r blmm40, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# diagnostic plots
plot(mlr.glmer, ID ~ resid(.), abline = 0 , cex = .5)
```

```{r blmm41, eval = T, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# summarize final model
mblrmtb <- meblrm.summary(m0.glm, m1.glm, m0.glmer, mlr.glmer, dpvar=mblrdata$SUFlike)
mblrmtb[, -c(4:5)]
```
