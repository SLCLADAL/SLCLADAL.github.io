knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/Ad_Courtois.png")
``` 

The second talk in the LADAL Webinar Series 2022 is by Cedric Courtois about using archives as source and as study object. Cedric  is a senior lecturer in the School of Communication and Arts in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Queensland. Before joining UQ, Cedric worked, for example, at the  Hans Bredow Institute (HBI) which is now also the Leibniz Institute for Media Research and collaborating partner of LADAL. He is both an audience researcher and a methodologist. His research interests include algorithmic impact in digital culture and data science applications in (digital) media and communication research (including text mining	and image processing).


### 2022/03/07: LADAL Webinar Series 2022 - WE ARE BACK!{-}

```{r grieve, echo=FALSE, out.width= "50%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/Opening_Ad_Grieve.png")
``` 

The LADAL Webinar Series 2022 starts off with a talk by Jack Grieve about cultural and regional constraints on the spread of linguistic innovations. Jack is Professor of Corpus Linguistics at the University of Birmingham and Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. His research involves analysing large corpora of natural language to understand language variation and change. He is especially interested in grammatical and lexical variation in the English language across time, space and communicative context, as well as developing methods for quantitative linguistic analysis. Jack also conducts research on authorship analysis and sometimes consults on casework as a forensic linguist. 

### 2022/01/10: We are growing again!{-}

``` 

[Ben Foley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IgD8XBYAAAAJ&hl=en) has joined LADAL and we are more than thrilled about this! Ben was the project manager of CoEDL's *Transcription Acceleration Project* (TAP) and he has specialized on speech recognition and the development of user-friendly speech recognition tools. Also, Ben’s previous experience with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language resource development has resulted in apps and websites galore. 

Welcome Ben!

### 2021/12/02: LADAL officially joins ATAP!{-}

```{r fireworks, echo=FALSE, out.width= "30%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/fireworks.jpg")
```

LADAL is now officially part of the *Australian Text Analytics Platform* (ATAP). The aim of the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) is to provide researchers with a toolset that is more powerful and customisable than those contained in the standard packages, while being accessible to a large number of researchers who do not have strong coding skills. A key outcome of the project will be the development of an integrated notebooks-based platform for processing and mining text data.

ATAP is funded by the *Australian Research Data Commons* (ARDC) Platforms Program and ATAP is lead by Michael - Martin is part of the steering committee, a Chief investigator (CI), and he is chairing a User Group.

### Best Practices in Corpus Linguistics – What lessons should we take from the Replication Crisis and how can we guarantee high quality in our research?{-}

Date: 20–24 May 2020

Presentation at ICAME 41 (41th Meeting of the International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English). Heidelberg, Germany.</summary>

Materials: [slides](http://martinschweinberger.de/docs/ppt/schweinberger-ppt-heidelberg-2020-05-21.pdf), [video](http://martinschweinberger.de/docs/materials/SchweinbergerBestPractices_ICAME41.mp4)

**Abstract**: This paper addresses issues relating to best practices in Data Management and Data Analysis in Corpus Linguistics (CL) and offers guidelines for compiling, storing, handling, and analysing data according to best practices which guarantee transparency and high quality in CL. 

Open Data and Best Practices in Data Science are increasingly attracting attention as a result of the so-called Replication Crisis (RC) which is an ongoing methodological crisis primarily affecting parts of the social and life sciences that began in the early 2010s (Diener & Biswas-Diener 2019). The RC has contributed to the loss of trust that the Humanities and Social Science have been experienced over the past two decades (Yong 2018). While a discussion about Best Practices in CL has recently begun (Berez-Kroeker et al. 2018) more attention has to be placed on the causes of the RC and the lessons that can be learnt from it. 

CL is somewhat disjunct from current developments in Data Science due to a lack of communication and unawareness of existing resources. This talk aims to raise awareness in CL about existing resources and problematic practices that are still common in CL, and it proposes solutions that are easily implemented and can guarantee transparency, replicability, and high quality of research outputs in CL. 

The solutions that this talk focuses on encompass 

*	being aware and following the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) in data management; 

*	the recognition of corpora as research outputs which allows corpora to be uniquely indexed (DOIs) and thereby enabling corpus compilers to profit from making corpora accessible as these can be cited like other publications which increases citation scores and visibility;

*	the use of Git to share code and data which is an easy way to share resources free of charge by utilizing existing research infrastructure;

* the use of R Notebooks to document analyses and making them available to the community and reviewers to enable full replicability and reproducibility;

*	making use of documentation and policy protocols in departments, schools and institutes to ease onboarding procedures and prevent data loss and corruption. 

The talk thus offers relevant information for authors as well as editors and publishers to enable replication, avoid “bad” research practices, and increase the quality of research.

Speaker: Michael Haugh & Martin Schweinberger

Presentation at the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC): The Australian eResearch Skilled Workforce Summit. Sydney, Australia, 29-30/7/2019.

</summary>

Materials: [slides](http://martinschweinberger.de/docs/ppt/HaughSchweinberger_eResearchSummit_20190730.pptx)

**Abstract**: This presentation introduces the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL), and discusses the implications of our experiences to date in establishing it for broader efforts to develop researcher capacity in the digital humanities. 

The LADAL is school-based support infrastructure for digital humanities researchers. It aims to assist staff and postgraduate students within the UQ School of Languages and Cultures to learn how to use data analytics, digital research tools, and other forms of technology to enhance their existing research programs, as well as offer pathways to new research possibilities. It complements the more generic resources and training in digital humanities methods offered by libraries (e.g. the Digital Scholars Hub at UQ) with the more specialised training/support in particular digital research methods and technologies that are required by researchers working on specific languages and cultures. 

The LADAL consists of a specialist computing lab for language-based computational and experimental work (the Computational and Experimental Workshop) and an online virtual lab. With respect to web-based materials, the LADAL website (https://slcladal.github.io/index.html) offers self-guided study materials and hands-on tutorials on topics relating to digital tools, computational methods for data extraction and processing, data visualization, statistical analyses of language data, and provides links to further resources and short descriptions of digital tools relevant for digital HASS research. 

In addition, the LADAL offers face-to-face consultations and specialized workshops. UQ researchers are encouraged to contact LADAL staff for advice and guidance on matters relating to digital research tools, data visualization, various statistical procedures, and text analytics. 

Staff feedback during face-to-face consultations and workshop attendance confirms there is substantial demand for the kind of digital humanities infrastructure offered by LADAL. It also suggests that support and training for researchers in the digital humanities should be conceptualized on a continuum from more generic through to more localized support.
