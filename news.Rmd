# ANNOUNCEMENTS{-}

### 2/10/2020: Library Excellence!{-}

Stephane Guillou has agreed to be a contributor and affiliate of LADAL! That is really fantastic not only because Stephane is all-around awesome and a true R wiz but Stephane is also directing the upskilling efforts in R, Python, and Git at the UQ library and thus brings along a fantastic skill-set!
