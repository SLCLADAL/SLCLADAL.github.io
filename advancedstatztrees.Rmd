# Introduction

This tutorial focuses on tree-based models and their implementation in "R". The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/advancedstatztreesrscript.r).

# Preparation and session set up

As all caluculations and visualizations rely on "R", it is necessary to install "R", "RStudio", and "Tinn-R". If these programms (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not already installed on your machine, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain "libraries" or "packages" need to be installed so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the librariesby running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the libraries mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary libraries, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("Boruta", "caret", "cowplot", "dplyr", 
                   "ggplot2", "Gmisc", "grid", "Hmisc", 
                   "knitr", "party", "partykit", "randomForest", 
                   "Rling"))
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Conditional Inference Trees

This section deals with tree-structure models, the most basic type is a conditional inference tree. Like random forests, conditional inference trees are non-parametric and thus do not rely on distributional requirements (or at least on fewer). The tree structure represents recursive partitioning of the data to minimize residual deviance. There are several advatages to using tree-based models:

* Tree-structure models are very useful because they can deal with different types of variables and provide a very good understaning of the structure in the data. 
* Tree-structure models are particularly interesting for linguists because they can handle moderate sample sizes and many high-order interactions better then regression models. 
* Tree-based models can be used as variable-selection procedure which informs about which variables have any sort of significant relationship with the dependent varabe and can thereby inform model fitting.

Before we implement a conditional inference tree in R, we will have a look at how it works. We will do this in more detail here as random forests and Boruta anlyses are extensions of conditional inference trees and are therefore based on the same concepts.

Below is a conditional inference tree which shows how and what factors contribute to the use of discourse like. All conditional inference trees answer a simple question, namely "How do we classify elements based on the given predictors?". The answer that conditional inference trees provide is the classification of the elements based on the levels of the predictors. If predictors are not significant or all elements can be classified correctly without them (i.e. if these predictors are unneccessary), then they are not included in the decision tree (or in the model fitting process).  The conditional inference tree shows that the best predictor for discourse *like* use is age as it is the highest node. Among young speakers, those with high status use like more compared with speakers of lower social status. Among old speakers, women use discourse *like* more than men.

```{r cit1, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(partykit)              # activate partykit library
library(dplyr)                 # activate dplyr library
options(stringsAsFactors = T)  # set options: do not convert strings
citdata <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinSchweinberger/coedlss2019materials/master/datatables/treedata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
set.seed(111)        # set.seed
# apply bonferroni correction (1 minus alpha multiplied by n of predictors)
control = ctree_control(mincriterion = 1-(.05*ncol(citdata)-1))
# create initial conditional inference tree model
citd.ctree <- ctree(LikeUser ~ Age + Gender + Status,
                    data = citdata)
plot(citd.ctree, gp = gpar(fontsize = 8)) # plot final ctree
```

Before going through how this conditional decision tree is generated, let us first go over some basic concepts. The top of the decision tree is called "root" or "root node", the categories at the end of branches are called "leaves" or "leaf nodes". Nodes that are in-between the root and leaves are called "internal nodes" or just "nodes". The root node has only arrows or lines pointing away from it, internal nodes have lines going to and from them, while leaf nodes only have lines pointing towards them.

Let us now go over the process by which the decision tree above is generated. In our example, we want to predict whether a person makes use of discourse *like* given their age, gender, and social status. The first six lines of this ficticious data set are displayed in the table below:

```{r cit2, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)                 # activate library for tabulating
citdata <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinSchweinberger/coedlss2019materials/master/datatables/treedata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
attach(citdata)
kable(head(citdata), caption = "Example data set to illustrate conditional inference trees.")
```

In a first step, we initialize our R session by activating relevant libraries, setting options and setting a seed. Then, we load the data into R.

```{r cit3, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# activate libraries
library(partykit)              
library(dplyr)  
library(grid)
library(Gmisc) 
library(Rling) 
library(ggplot2)       
library(cowplot)       
library(randomForest)
library(party)
library(Hmisc)
library(Boruta) 
library(RCurl)
# to install the caret library, it was neccessary to go through the installation 
# process below - once caret is installed once, you do not need to go through 
# these steps again
# install caret library
#source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R"); biocLite(); library(Biobase)
#install.packages("Biobase", repos=c("http://rstudio.org/_packages", "http://cran.rstudio.com", 
#                                      "http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies=TRUE))
#install.packages("dimRed", dependencies = TRUE)
#install.packages('caret', dependencies = TRUE)
# activate caret library
library(caret) 
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
options(scipen = 999)
options(max.print=10000)
# load data
citdata <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinSchweinberger/coedlss2019materials/master/datatables/treedata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
# inspect data
head(citdata); str(citdata)
```

The "str" functions output tells us that the data is not factorized yet. As tree-based models require either numeric or factorized data, we factorize the "character" variables in our data.

```{r cit4, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# factorize variables (cit require factors instead of character vectors)
fcts <- c("Age", "Gender", "Status", "LikeUser")
citdata[fcts] <- lapply(citdata[fcts], factor)
# inspect data
str(citdata)
```

The data now consists of of factors which two levels each. After initializing the R session, it needs to be determined, what the root of the decision tree should be. This means that we have to determine which of the variables represents the root node. In order to do so, we tabulate for each variable level, how many speakers of that level have used discourse *like* (LikeUsers) and how many have not used discourse *like* (NonLikeUsers).

```{r cit5, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# tabulate data
table(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Gender)

table(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Age)

table(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Status)
```

None of the predictors is perfect (the perdictors are therefore refered to as "impure"). To determine which variable is the root, we will caluculate the degree of "impurity" for each variable - the variable which has the lowest impurity value will be the root.

The most common measure of impurity in the conext of conditional inference trees is called "Gini". For each level we apply the following equation to determine the impuruty value:

\begin{equation}

G_{x} = 1 - ( p_{1} )^{2} - ( p_{0} )^{2}

\end{equation}

For the node for men, this would mean the following:

\begin{equation}

G_{men} = 1-(\frac{42} {42+75})^{2} - (\frac{75} {42+75})^{2} = 0.4602235

\end{equation}

For women, we caculate G or Gini as follows:

\begin{equation}

G_{women} = 1-(\frac{91} {91+43})^{2} - (\frac{43} {91+43})^{2} = 0.4358432

\end{equation}

To calculate the Gini value of Gender, we need to calculate the weighted average leaf node impurity (weighted because the number of speakers is different in each group). We calculate the weighted avergage leaf node impurity using the forluar below. 

\begin{equation}

G_{Gender} = \frac{N_{men}} {N_{Total}} \times G_{men} +  \frac{N_{women}} {N_{Total}} \times G_{women}

G_{Gender} = \frac{159} {303} \times 0.4602235 +  \frac{144} {303} \times 0.4358432 = 0.4611915

\end{equation}

Before we do these calculations in R, we will just briefly revisit the gender distribution and perform a \chi^2^-test to see whether testing gender makes sense in the first place.

```{r cit6, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# GENDER
# re-inspect gender distribution
tblikegender <- table(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Gender)
tblikegender

chisq.test(tblikegender) # sig difference: data can be split!
```

The \chi^2^-test shows that testing if we should split by gender does make sense as there are significant differences between men and women. We will now perform the gini-calculation for gender (see below).

```{r cit7, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate Gini for men
gini_men <- 1-(42/(42+75))^2 - (75/(42+75))^2
# calculate Gini for women
gini_women <- 1-(91/(91+43))^2 - (43/(91+43))^2
# calculate weighted average of Gini for Gender
gini_gender <- 42/(42+75)* gini_men +  91/(91+43) * gini_women
gini_gender
```

The gini for gender is .461. In a next step, we revisit the age distribution and also perform a \chi^2^-test.

```{r cit8, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# re-inspect age distribution
tblikeage <- table(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Age)
tblikeage

chisq.test(tblikeage) # sig difference: data can be split!
```

As the \chi^2^-test returns a significant result, we continue to calculate the gini value for age.

```{r cit9, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate Gini for age groups
gini_young <- 1-(92/(92+34))^2 - (34/(92+34))^2  # Gini: young
gini_old <- 1-(41/(41+84))^2 - (84/(41+84))^2    # Gini: old
# calculate weighted average of Gini for Age
gini_age <- 92/(92+34)* gini_young +  41/(41+84) * gini_old
gini_age

```

The gini for age is .432 and we continue by revisiting the status distribution and also perform a \chi^2^-test.

```{r cit10, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# re-inspect status distribution
tblikestatus <- table(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Status)
tblikestatus

chisq.test(tblikestatus) # sig difference: data can be split!
```

As the \chi^2^-test returns a significant result, we continue to calculate the gini value for status.

```{r cit11, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gini_high <- 1-(73/(33+73))^2 - (33/(33+73))^2   # Gini: high
gini_low <- 1-(60/(60+85))^2 - (85/(60+85))^2    # Gini: low
# calculate weighted average of Gini for Status
gini_status <- 73/(33+73)* gini_high +  60/(60+85) * gini_low
gini_status
```

The gini for status is .496 and we can now compare the gini values for age, gender, and status.

```{r cit12, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# compare age, gender, and status ginis
gini_age; gini_gender; gini_status
```

Since age has the lowest gini (impurity) value, our first split is by age and age, thus, represents our root node. Our manually calculated conditional inference tree right  now looks as below.

```{r cit13, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot tree we have so far!
grid.newpage()
# set some parameters to use repeatedly
leftx <- .25
midx <- .5
rightx <- .75
width <- .4
gp <- gpar(fill = "lightgrey")
# create boxes
(rando <- boxGrob("Age", 
                  x=midx, y=.9, box_gp = gp, width = width))
# connect boxes like this
(g1 <- boxGrob("41-80\n  NonLikeUsers  LikeUsers \n 84                 41", 
               x=leftx, y=.5, box_gp = gp, width = width))
(g2 <- boxGrob("15-40\n NonLikeUsers  LikeUsers \n 34                  92", 
               x=rightx, y=.5, box_gp = gp, width = width))
connectGrob(rando, g1, "N")
connectGrob(rando, g2, "N")

```

In a next step, we need to find out which of the remaining variables best separates the speakers who use discourse *like* from those that do not under the first node. In order to do so, we calculate the Gini values for Gender and SocialStatus for the "41-80" node.

In a first step, we tabulate the old speakers by gender, inspect the distribution, and use a \chi^2^-test to evaluate whether splitting makes sense.

```{r cit14, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 2ND NODE
# split data according to first split (only old data for now)
old <- citdata[citdata$Age == "41-80",]
# inspect distribution
tboldgender <- table(old$LikeUser, old$Gender)
tboldgender

chisq.test(tboldgender) # sig difference: data can be split!
```

As the \chi^2^-test returns a significant result, we continue to calculate the gini value for gender among old speakers.

```{r cit15, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate Gini for Gender
# calculate Gini for men
gini_oldmen <- 1-(tboldgender[2,2]/sum(tboldgender[,2]))^2 - (tboldgender[1,2]/sum(tboldgender[,2]))^2
# calculate Gini for women
gini_oldwomen <- 1-(tboldgender[2,1]/sum(tboldgender[,1]))^2 - (tboldgender[1,1]/sum(tboldgender[,1]))^2
# # calculate weighted aAverage of Gini for Gender
gini_oldgender <- sum(tboldgender[,2])/sum(tboldgender)* gini_oldmen +  sum(tboldgender[,1])/sum(tboldgender) * gini_oldwomen
gini_oldgender
```

The gini values for gender among old speakers is .345. We continue byinspecting the status distribution among old speakers.

```{r cit16, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate Gini for Status
# inspect distribution
tboldstatus <- table(old$LikeUser, old$Status)
tboldstatus

chisq.test(tboldstatus) # sig difference: data can be split!
```

Since the \chi^2^-test returns a non-significant result, we do not need to calculate the gini value for status and split the old speakers by gender without further calculation. In a next step, we determine if we need to further divide the 3^rd^ node (old male speakers) by status. To do so, we inspect the status distribution for old male speakers and perform a  \chi^2^-test. 

```{r cit17, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 3RD NODE
# split data according to first split (only old data for now)
oldmale <- citdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(Age == "41-80") %>%
  dplyr::filter(Gender == "male")
# inspect distribution
tboldmalestatus <- table(oldmale$LikeUser, oldmale$Status)
tboldmalestatus

chisq.test(tboldmalestatus) # no sig difference: no more splits!
```

Since the  \chi^2^-test reports no significant differences, we have reached an end ("leave") of this brach of out tree. We will now move on and check if we need to split the 4^th^ node (old female speakers) by status.

```{r cit18, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 4TH NODE
# split data according to first split (only old data for now)
oldfemale <- citdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(Age == "41-80") %>%
  dplyr::filter(Gender == "female")
# inspect distribution
tboldfemalestatus <- table(oldfemale$LikeUser, oldfemale$Status)
tboldfemalestatus

chisq.test(tboldfemalestatus) # no sig difference: no more splits!

```

Here, too, we have reached the end of this branch ("leave") because the \chi^2^-test reports no significant differences. We can thus move on to the young speakers (the 5^th^ node) and test if and how to split this branch. 

```{r cit19, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 5TH NODE
# split data according to first split (only young data)
young <- citdata[citdata$Age == "15-40",]
# inspect distribution
tbyounggender <- table(young$LikeUser, young$Gender)
tbyounggender

chisq.test(tbyounggender) # no sig difference: do not split!
```

As the \chi^2^-test does not report significant differences, we inspect the status distribution and check if low an high status speakers differ significantly.

```{r cit20, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate Gini for Status
# inspect distribution
tbyoungstatus <- table(young$LikeUser, young$Status)
tbyoungstatus

chisq.test(tbyoungstatus) # sig difference: split!

```

Since the \chi^2^-test reports a significant result and gender was reported as being insignificant, we split by status without having to calculate the gini for status here. In a next step, we inspect the distribution of young low status speakers and test if we should split by gender.

```{r cit21, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 6TH NODE
# split data according to first and second split (young and low status data)
younglow <- citdata %>%
  filter(Age == "15-40") %>%
  filter(Status == "low")
# inspect gender distribution
tbyounglowgender <- table(younglow$LikeUser, younglow$Gender)
tbyounglowgender

chisq.test(tbyounglowgender) # no sig difference: no more splits!
```

Here, too, we have reached the end of this branch ("leave") because the \chi^2^-test reports no significant differences. We can thus move on to the young high status speakers (the 7^th^ node) and test if we need to split this branch by gender. Again, we inspect the distribution and perform a \chi^2^-test.

```{r cit22, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 7TH node
# split data according to first and second split (young and high status data)
younghigh <- citdata %>%
  filter(Age == "15-40") %>%
  filter(Status == "high")
# inspect gender distribution
tbyounghighgender <- table(younghigh$LikeUser, younghigh$Gender)
tbyounghighgender

chisq.test(tbyounghighgender) # no sig difference: no more splits!
```

The lack of a significant difference reported by the \chi^2^-test tells us that we have reached our final tree as all branches end in leaves now. 

This analysis can be implemented much more smoothly in R, of course, which we will do below. Just a quick word on setting seeds. When we assign or set a seed, this measn that any random number that is generated will be stored which makes analyses reproducible. Otherwise we would, of course, get different results if we relied n newly randomly generated numbers. 

```{r cit23, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# set.seed (to store random numbers and thus make results reporducible)
set.seed(2019120202) 
# apply bonferroni correction (1 minus alpha multiplied by n of predictors)
control = ctree_control(mincriterion = 1-(.05*(ncol(citdata)-1)))
# create initial conditional inference tree model
citd.ctree <- ctree(LikeUser ~ Age + Gender + Status, data = citdata)
plot(citd.ctree, gp = gpar(fontsize = 8)) # plot final ctree
```

In addition to plotting the conditional inference tree, we can also check its accuracy. To do so, we predict the use of like based on the conditional inference tree and compare them to the observed uses of like. Then we use the "confusionMatrix" function from the "caret" package to get an overview of the accuracy statistics.

```{r cit24, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
citprediction <- predict(citd.ctree)
confusionMatrix(citprediction, citdata$LikeUser)
```

The conditional inference tree has an accuracy of 72.91 percent which is significantly better than the base-line accuracy of 52.99 percent. To understand what the other statistics refer to and how they are calculated, run the command "?confusionMatrix". 

## Splitting numeric, ordinal, and true categorical variables

While it is rather straight forward to calculate the Gini values for categorical variables, it may not seem quite as apparent how to calculate splits for numeric or ordinal variables. To illustrate how the algorithm works on such variables, consider the example data set shown below.

```{r citn1, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)                 # activate library for tabulating
citdata2 <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/numerictreedata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
kable(citdata2, caption = "Example data set to illustrate numeric splits in conditional inference trees.")
```

In a first step, we order the numeric variable so that we arrive at the follwoing table.

```{r citn2, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
citdata2 <- citdata2 %>%
  arrange(Age)
kable(citdata2, caption = "Example data set to illustrate numeric splits in conditional inference trees.")
```

Next, we calculate the means for each level of "Age".

```{r citn3, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Age <- c(15, ((15+22)/2), 22, ((22+27)/2), 27, ((27+37)/2), 37, ((37+42)/2), 42, ((42+63)/2), 63)
LikeUser <- c("yes", "", "yes", "", "yes", "", "no", "", "yes", "", "no")
citdata3 <- data.frame(Age, LikeUser)
kable(citdata3, caption = "Ordered data set with mean age levels to illustrate numeric splits in conditional inference trees.")
```

Now, we calculate the Gini values for each average level of age. How this is done is shown below for the first split.

\begin{equation}

G_{x} = 1 - ( p_{1} )^{2} - ( p_{0} )^{2}

\end{equation}

For an age smaller than 18.5 this would mean:

\begin{equation}

G_{youngerthan18.5} = 1-(\frac{1} {1+0})^{2} - (\frac{0} {1+0})^{2} = 0.0

\end{equation}

For an age greater than 18.5, we caculate G or Gini as follows:

\begin{equation}

G_{olerthan18.5} = 1-(\frac{2} {2+3})^{2} - (\frac{3} {2+3})^{2} = 0.48

\end{equation}

 Now, we calculate the Gini for that split as we have done above.
 
\begin{equation}

G_{split18.5} = \frac{N_{youngerthan18.5}} {N_{Total}} \times G_{youngerthan18.5} +  \frac{N_{olderthan18.5}} {N_{Total}} \times G_{olderthan18.5}

G_{split18.5} = \frac{1} {6} \times 0.0 +  \frac{5} {6} \times 0.48 = 0.4

\end{equation}

We then have to calculate the gini values for all possible age splits which yields the following results:

```{r citn4, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 18.5
1-(1/(1+0))^2 - (0/(1+0))^2
1-(2/(2+3))^2 - (3/(2+3))^2
1/6 * 0.0 +  5/6 * 0.48
# 24.4
1-(2/(2+0))^2 - (0/(2+0))^2
1-(3/(3+1))^2 - (2/(3+1))^2
2/6 * 0.0 +  4/6 * 0.1875
# 32
1-(3/(3+0))^2 - (0/(3+0))^2
1-(1/(1+2))^2 - (2/(1+2))^2
3/6 * 0.0 +  3/6 * 0.4444444
# 39.5
1-(3/(3+1))^2 - (1/(3+1))^2
1-(1/(1+1))^2 - (1/(1+1))^2
4/6 * 0.375 +  2/6 * 0.5
# 52.5
1-(4/(4+1))^2 - (1/(4+1))^2
1-(0/(0+1))^2 - (1/(0+1))^2
5/6 * 0.32 +  1/6 * 0.0
```


```{r citn5, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
AgeSplit <- c(((15+22)/2), ((22+27)/2), ((27+37)/2), ((37+42)/2), ((42+63)/2))
Gini <- c(0.4, 0.5,0.444, 0.41, 0.267)
citdata3 <- data.frame(AgeSplit, Gini)
kable(citdata3, caption = "Possible age splits and their associated Gini values.")
```

The split at 52.5 years of age has the lowest Gini value. Accordingly, we would split the data between speakers who are younger than 52.5 and speakers who are older than 52.5 years of age. The lowest Gini value for any age split would also be the Gini value that would be compared to other variables. 

The same procedure that we have used to determine potential splits for a numeric variable would apply to an ordinal variable with only two differences:

* The Gini values are calculated for the actual levels and not the means between variable levels. 
* The Gini value is nor calculated for the lowest and highest level as the calculation of the Gini values is impissble for extreme values. Extreme levels can, therefore, not serve as a potential split locations. 

When dealing with categorical variables with more than two levels, the situation is slightly more complex as we would also have to calculate the Gini values for combinations of variable levels. While the calculations are, in principle, analogous to the ones performed for binary of nominal categorical variables, we would also have to check if combinations would lead to improved splits. For instance, imagine we have a variable with categories "A", "B", and "C". In such cases we would not only have to calculate the Gini scores for "A", "B", and "C" but also for "A plus B", "A plus C", and "B plus C". Note that we ignore the combination "A plus B plus C" as this combination would include all other portential combinations. 

## Problems of Conditional Inference Trees

Conditional Inference Trees are very intuitive, multivariate, non-parametric, they do not require large data sets, and they are easy to implement. Despite these obvious advatages, they have at least two major short comings: 

* they are prone to overfitting;

* they do not perform well why they are applied to new data. 

An extension which remedies these problems is to grow many varied trees - this is called a Random Forest Analysis and will have a look at how Random Forests work and how to implement them in R in the next section. 

#  Random Forests

Random Forests are an extension of Conditional Inference Trees. Like Conditional Inference Trees, Random Forests represent a multivariate, non-parametric partitioning method that is particularly useful when dealing with relatively small sample sizes and many predictors (including interactions). Random Forests outperform CITs in that they are substantially less prone to overfitting and they perform much better when applied to new data.

**Bootstrapped Data**

Random Forests do not work on one-and-the-same data set (as CITs do) but in Random Forest analyses, many samples (with replacement) are drawn from the original data set. This generation of new data set based on an existing data set is called "bootstrapping". Bootstrapping allows us to produce many trees based on variations of the original data set rather than dealing with only a single, fixed data set that would produce only a single tree. Therefore, because the data is different each time, the individual CITs are also different. 

Imagine, we are dealing with a very small data set to which we want to apply a Random Forest Analysis. The original data set is displayed below. 

```{r rf1, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
citdata <- read.delim("data/treedata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
citdata <- head(citdata)
citdata$ID <- 1:nrow(citdata)
citdata <- citdata %>%
  dplyr::select(ID, Age, Gender, Status, LikeUser)
kable(citdata, caption = "Example data set to illustrate Random Forests.")
```

We now draw a sample from this data set and receive the following data set.

```{r rf2, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
citdata <- citdata[c(6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2),]
rownames(citdata) <- NULL
kable(citdata, caption = "Bootstrapped data set to illustrate Random Forests.")
```

As you can see, the bootstrapped data contains the second row twice while the fifth row is missing.

**Out-Of-Bag data**

Because the data is reshuffeled for every new tree, a part of the data (on average about 30%) remains unused fro a given tree. The dat that is not used is called Out-Of-Bag data or OOB. The OOB is importnat because the quality of teh overall performance of the random forest can be assessed by applying the resulting tree-model to the data that it was not fit to. The quality of that tree is then measured in the OOB error, which is the error rate of the respective tree if applied to the OOB data.

**Random Variable Selection**

Random Forests also differ from simple CITs in that at each step, not all possible variables are considered for a node, but only a subset. For example, we have a data set with five predicting independent variables and one dependent variable. When generating a CIT, all possible variables (variables that do not represent a node further up in the tree) are consiederd as splitting candidates. In Random Forests, only a fixed number (typically the square-root of the number of independent variables) are considered as candidates for a node. So at each potential split, a fixed number of randomly selected variables is considered potential node candidates.

## Random Forests in R

This section shows how a Random Forest Analysis can be implemented in R. Ina first step, we load and inspect the data.

```{r rf3, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load random forest data
rfdata <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinSchweinberger/coedlss2019materials/master/datatables/rfdata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
# inspect data
head(rfdata); str(rfdata)

```

The data consists of four categorical variables (Gender, Age, ConversationType, and SUFLike). Our dependent variable is SUFLike which stands for speech-unit final like (a pragmatic marker that is common in Irish English and is used as in "A wee girl of her age, like"). While Age and Gender are pretty straight forward what they are called, ConversationType encodes whether a conversation has taken place between interlocutors of the same or of different genders.

Before going any further,w e need to factorize the variables as tree-based modesl require factors instead of character variables (but tehy can, of course, handle numeric and ordinal variables). In addition, we will check if the data contains missing values (NAs).

```{r rf4, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# factorize variables (rf require factors instead of character vectors)
fcts <- c("Gender", "Age", "ConversationType", "Priming", "SUFLike")
rfdata[fcts] <- lapply(rfdata[fcts], factor)
# inspect data
str(rfdata)

# check for NAs
natest <- rfdata %>%
  na.omit()
nrow(natest) # no NAs present in data (same number of rows with NAs omitted)
```



Note that for most machine learning methods, you need to divide the data manually into a "training" set and a "test" set. This allows you to train the method using the training data, and then test it on data it was not originally trained on.

In contrast, Random Forests split the data into "training" and "test" sets for you. This is because Random Forests use bootstrapped data, and thus, not every sample is used to build every tree. The "training" dataset is the bootstrapped data and the "test" dataset is the remaining samples. The remaining samples are called the "Out-Of-Bag" (OOB) data.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(42)
## impute any missing values in the training set using proximities
data.imputed <- rfImpute(hd ~ ., data = data, iter=6)
```

The argument "iter" refers to the number of iterations to run. Breiman says 4 to 6 iterations is usually good enough. With this dataset, when we set iter=6, OOB-error bounces around between 17% and 18%. When we set iter=20, we get values a little better and a little worse, so doing more iterations doesn't improve the situation.

Also, if you really want to micromanage how rfImpute(), you can change the number of trees it makes (the default is 300) and the number of variables that it will consider at each step.
 
Now we are ready to build a random forest. If the thing we're trying to predict (in this case it is  whether or not someone has heart disease) is a continuous number  (i.e. "weight" or "height"), then by default, randomForest() will set  "mtry", the number of variables to consider at each step,  to the total number of variables divided by 3 (rounded down), or to 1  (if the division results in a value less than 1).  If the thing we're trying to predict is a "factor" (i.e. either "yes/no"  or "ranked"), then randomForest() will set mtry to  the square root of the number of variables (rounded down to the next  integer value).
 
In this example, "hd", the thing we are trying to predict, is a factor and  there are 13 variables. So by default, randomForest() will set  mtry = sqrt(13) = 3.6 rounded down = 3.  Also, by default random forest generates 500 trees (NOTE: rfImpute() only generates 300 tress by default)

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model <- randomForest(hd ~ ., data=data.imputed, proximity=TRUE)
model 
```

The model gives us an overview of the call, along with the OOB error rate for the forest with ntree trees (in this case ntree=500 by default). In additon, the output provides a confusion matrix for the forest with ntree trees. The confusion matrix is laid out like this:

```{r echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)                 # activate library for tabulating
confusionmatrixtb <- matrix(c("", "Healthy", "Unhealthy", "Healthy", "Number of healthy people correctly called healthy by the forest.", "Number of healthy people incorectly called unhealthy by the forest", "Unhealthy", "Number of unhealthy people incorrectly called healthy by the forest", "Number of unhealthy people correctly called unhealthy by the forest"), ncol = 3, byrow = T)
kable(head(confusionmatrixtb), caption = "Confusion matrix for the random forest for Heart Disease data.")
```

Now, we check to see if the random forest is actually big enough... Up to a point, the more trees in the forest, the better. You can tell when  you've made enough when the OOB no longer improves.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

oob.error.data <- data.frame(
  Trees=rep(1:nrow(model$err.rate), times=3),
  Type=rep(c("OOB", "Healthy", "Unhealthy"), each=nrow(model$err.rate)),
  Error=c(model$err.rate[,"OOB"],
    model$err.rate[,"Healthy"],
    model$err.rate[,"Unhealthy"]))
 
ggplot(data=oob.error.data, aes(x=Trees, y=Error)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=Type))
# ggsave("oob_error_rate_500_trees.pdf")
```

The blue line shows the error rate specifically for calling "Unheathly" patients that are OOB. The green line shows the overall OOB error rate. The red line shows the error rate specifically for calling "Healthy" patients that are OOB.
 
After building a random forest with 500 tress, the graph does not make it clear that the OOB-error has settled on a value or, if we added more trees, it would continue to decrease. So we do the whole thing again, but this time add more trees.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model <- randomForest(hd ~ ., data=data.imputed, ntree=1000, proximity=TRUE)
model
```

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
oob.error.data <- data.frame(
  Trees=rep(1:nrow(model$err.rate), times=3),
  Type=rep(c("OOB", "Healthy", "Unhealthy"), each=nrow(model$err.rate)),
  Error=c(model$err.rate[,"OOB"],
    model$err.rate[,"Healthy"],
    model$err.rate[,"Unhealthy"]))
 
ggplot(data=oob.error.data, aes(x=Trees, y=Error)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=Type))
# ggsave("oob_error_rate_1000_trees.pdf")
```

After building a random forest with 1,000 trees, we get the same OOB-error 16.5% and we can see convergence in the graph. So we could have gotten away with only 500 trees, but we wouldn't have been sure that number was enough.
 
If we want to compare this random forest to others with different values for mtry (to control how many variables are considered at each step)...

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
oob.values <- vector(length=10)
for(i in 1:10) {
  temp.model <- randomForest(hd ~ ., data=data.imputed, mtry=i, ntree=1000)
  oob.values[i] <- temp.model$err.rate[nrow(temp.model$err.rate),1]
}
oob.values
```

The lowest value is when mtry=3, so the default setting was the best. Now let's create an MDS-plot to show how the samples are related to each other.

Start by converting the proximity matrix into a distance matrix.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
distance.matrix <- dist(1-model$proximity)
mds.stuff <- cmdscale(distance.matrix, eig=TRUE, x.ret=TRUE)
## calculate the percentage of variation that each MDS axis accounts for...
mds.var.per <- round(mds.stuff$eig/sum(mds.stuff$eig)*100, 1)
## now make a fancy looking plot that shows the MDS axes and the variation:
mds.values <- mds.stuff$points
mds.data <- data.frame(Sample=rownames(mds.values),
  X=mds.values[,1],
  Y=mds.values[,2],
  Status=data.imputed$hd)
 
ggplot(data=mds.data, aes(x=X, y=Y, label=Sample)) +
  geom_text(aes(color=Status)) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab(paste("MDS1 - ", mds.var.per[1], "%", sep="")) +
  ylab(paste("MDS2 - ", mds.var.per[2], "%", sep="")) +
  ggtitle("MDS plot using (1 - Random Forest Proximities)")
```

As a final step, we plot the effect sizes of the variables as the mean of decrease in Gini values.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
varImpPlot(model, main = "", pch = 20) 
```


## Random Forests in R: Really

We now use a similar but slightly more elaborate method of going through a random forest analysis. Again, we start the procedure by activating libraries that we will need and by loading the data and setting a seed. A seed allows us to replicate this analysis.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rfd <- read.delim("data/treedata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
set.seed(222)                       # set seed
```

After the data preparation, we can now start with the random forest analysis and, in a first step, we partition the data in order to be able to evaluate the precision of the random forest model later on. We partition the data into a training and a test set.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
id <- sample(2, nrow(rfd), replace = T, prob = c(.7, .3))
train <- rfd[id == 1, ]
test <- rfd[id == 2,]
```

We now create an initial random forest model and inspect its parameters.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
like_rf1 <- randomForest(LikeUser~., data = train)
print(like_rf1) # inspect model
```

We can also inspect attibutes of the random forest model.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
attributes(like_rf1)
```

After running an initial random forest model, we will now start with the model evaluation. To evaluate the model, we will have to load additional libraries.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install package
#source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R"); biocLite(); library(Biobase)
#install.packages("Biobase", repos=c("http://rstudio.org/_packages", "http://cran.rstudio.com", 
#                                      "http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies=TRUE))
#install.packages("dimRed", dependencies = TRUE)
#install.packages('caret', dependencies = TRUE)
# load caret library
library(caret) # because initially caret did not work, the libraries above had to be installed
ptrain1 <- predict(like_rf1, train) # extract prediction for training data
head(ptrain1); head(train$LikeUser)         # inspect predictions
```

Now, we generate a confusion matrix for the training data, extract the prediction for test data, and create confusion matrix for the test data.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
confusionMatrix(ptrain1, train$LikeUser)  
ptest1 <- predict(like_rf1, test)
confusionMatrix(ptest1, test$LikeUser)
```

Now, we determine error rate of random forest model.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(like_rf1, main = "")
```

After going through the model evaluation, we can now tune the ransom forest model.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
like_rf2 <- tuneRF(train[, !colnames(train)== "LikeUser"], 
                        train[, colnames(train)== "LikeUser"], 
                        stepFactor = 3, # for most values 3 appears to be optimal
                        plot = T,
                        ntreeTry = 200,
                        trace = T,
                        improve = .05
)
```

Again, we create an improved model and inspect its properties.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

like_rf2 <- randomForest(LikeUser~., data = train, 
                              ntree = 200,
                              ntry = 6,
                              importance= T,
                              proximity = T)
print(like_rf2)   # inspect model
```

As before, we extract the predictions based on the improved model and create a confusion matrix.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ptrain2 <- predict(like_rf2, train)
confusionMatrix(ptrain2, train$LikeUser)
```

We will now extract predictions for test data and create a confusion matrix.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ptest2 <- predict(like_rf2, test)
confusionMatrix(ptest2, test$LikeUser)
```

Now, we inspect number of nodes per tree in the forest.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hist(treesize(like_rf2), main = "", col = "lightgray")
```

We now move on and determine the effect size by checking variable importance.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
varImpPlot(like_rf2, main = "", pch = 20) 
```

The left plot shows the accuracy. More precisely, it shows how much accuracy decreases if factor is left out. The right plot shows the impurity of the nodes of the model based on the predictors. In other words, it shows how much more unpure (ambiguous) the distributions become if factor is left out  extract variable importance values.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
importance(like_rf2)
```

Which variables have been used in the trees?

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
varUsed(like_rf2)
```

We can also show the effect size in partial dependence plots.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
partialPlot(like_rf2, train, Age)
```

To extract a specific tree. we can use the following command.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
getTree(like_rf2, 1, labelVar = T)
```

Finally, a multidimensional scaling plot shows patternings in the data.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
MDSplot(like_rf2, test$LikeUser)
```

## Random Forests in R: Really again

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# detach partykit
#detach("package:partykit", unload=TRUE)
# load package party
library(party)
# set seed
set.seed(333)

like.rf <- cforest(LikeUser ~ Age + Gender + Status,
                        data = rfd, controls = cforest_unbiased(ntree = 50, mtry = 3))
# determine importance of factors
like.varimp <- varimp(like.rf, conditional = T)
round(like.varimp, 3)
```

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot result
dotchart(sort(like.varimp), pch = 20, main = "Conditional importance of variables")
```

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library

# evaluate random forst
like.rf.pred <- unlist(treeresponse(like.rf))[c(FALSE,TRUE)]
somers2(like.rf.pred, as.numeric(rfd$LikeUser) - 1)
```


## Random Forests in R: Really?

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(party)
cf1 <- cforest(LikeUser ~ . , data= rfd, control=cforest_unbiased(mtry=2,ntree=100)) # fit the random forest
varimp(cf1) # get variable importance, based on mean decrease in accuracy
```

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# conditional=True, adjusts for correlations between predict
varimp(cf1, conditional=TRUE) 
```

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
varimpAUC(cf1)  # more robust towards class imbalance.
```


```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mar = c(5, 8, 4, 2) + 0.1)
plot(y = 1:length(varimpAUC(cf1)), x = varimpAUC(cf1)[order(varimpAUC(cf1))], 
     axes = F, ann = F, pch = 20, xlim = c(-0.01, 0.2), main = "Predictor Importance")
axis(1, at = seq(-0.01, 0.2, 0.05), seq(-0.01, 0.2, 0.05))
axis(2, at = 1:length(varimpAUC(cf1)), names(varimpAUC(cf1))[order(varimpAUC(cf1))], las = 2)
grid()
box()
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)
```

# Boruta

Boruta (Kursa & Rudnicki 2010, 2018) is a variable selection procedure and it represents an extension of random forest analyses (cf. Breiman 2001; Tagliamonte & Baayen 2012). The name “Boruta” is derived from a demon in Slavic mythology who dwelled in pine forests. Boruta is an alternative to regression modelling that is better equipped to handle small data sets because it uses a distributional approach during which hundreds of (random) forests are grown from permutated data sets. This means that Boruta outperforms random forest analyses because it does not provide merely a single value for each predictor but a distribution of values leading to higher reliability.

The Boruta analysis consists out of five steps. 

* In a first step, the Boruta algorithm copies the data set and adds randomness to the data by (re-)shuffling data points and thereby creating randomized variables. These randomized variables are referred to as shadow features. 

* Secondly, a random forest classifier is trained on the extended data set. 

* In a third step, a feature importance measure (Mean Decrease Accuracy represented by z-scores) is calculated to determine the relative importance of all predictors (both original or real variables and the randomized shadow features). 

* In the next step, it is checked at each iteration of the process whether a real predictor has a higher importance compared with the best shadow feature. The algorithm keeps track of the performance of the original variables by storing whether they outperformed the best shadow feature or not in a vector. 

* In the fifth step, predictors that did not outperform the best shadow feature are removed and the process continues without them. After a set number of iterations, or if all the variables have been either confirmed as outperforming the best shadow feature, the algorithm stops. 

Despite its obvious advantages of Boruta over random forest analyses and regression modelling, it can neither handle multicollinearity not hierarchical data structures where data points are nested or grouped by a given predictor (as is the case in the present analysis as data points are grouped by adjective type). As Boruta is a variable selection procedure, it is also limited in the sense that it provides information on which predictors to include and how good these predictors are (compared to the shadow variables) while it is neither able to take hierarchical data structure into account, nor does it provide information about how one level of a factor compares to other factors. In other words, Boruta shows that a predictor is relevant and how strong it is but it does not provide information on how the likelihood of an outcome being used differs between variable levels, for instance between men and women. 

# Boruta in R

We begin by preparing the session. In a first step, we load the necessary library and the data.


```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages(Boruta)       # install Boruta library (remove # to activate)
library(Boruta)                # activate Boruta library
options(stringsAsFactors = T)  # set options: do not convert strings
options(scipen = 999)          # set options: supress math. notation
options(max.prAmplified=10000) # set options
# load data
borutadata <- read.delim("data/treedata.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
head(borutadata)
```

Now that we have loaded the data, we will start our initial analysis.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# initial run
boruta1 <- Boruta(LikeUser~.,data=borutadata)
print(boruta1)

getConfirmedFormula(boruta1)
```
```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(boruta1, cex = .5)
```

We now have a look at the importance history to see if any variables can be removed from the analysis.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plotImpHistory(boruta1)
```

After inspecting the importance history, we see that our predictors performed consistently better than chance and the Boruta parameters tehrefore do not need to be modified and we also do not need to remove insignificant variables which do not consistently perform better than the shadow variable. If perdictors do perform worse than the best shadow variable, then these variables should be excludde and the Boruta analysis should be re-run on the dataset that does no longer contain the superfluous variable.  

Now, we print the confirmed formular to check which predictors should be included in the model.

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
getConfirmedFormula(boruta1)
```

As a last step, we customize the results plot of the Boruta analysis.


```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mar = c(8, 8, 4, 2) + 0.1)
plot(boruta1, cex.axis=.75, las=2, xlab="", ylab = "", cex = .75, 
     col = c("grey50", "grey50", "grey50","grey90","grey90","grey90"))
abline(v = 3.5, lty = "dashed")
mtext("Predictors", 1, line = 6, at = 5, cex = 1)
mtext("Control", 1, line = 6, at = 2, cex = 1)
mtext("Importance", 2, line = 2.5, at = 20, cex = 1, las = 0)
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)
```
