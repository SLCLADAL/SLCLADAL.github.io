**Abstract**: Looking for ways to automate some of those repetitive data analysis tasks? This introductory session will give you an idea of what you can do with R and whether you would like to use it for your data analysis. Please install R and R Studio prior(!) to the workshop. Instructions from the UQ Library regarding installing R and R Studio can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/stragu/DSH/blob/master/R/Installation.md). Once R Studio is installed you will need to install the tidyverse package by opening R Studio and typing at the prompt in the console the following command:


```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
