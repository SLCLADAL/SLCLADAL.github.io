# Introduction

This section presents case studies on how to use "R" in corpus linguistics. The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/fixedregressionsscript.r).

The case studies merely exemplify ways in which "R" can be used in language-based research rather than providing mdels of how to do research. The first case study aims to answer if swearing differs across the genders. In other words, this case study focuses on whether men or women swear more. The second analysis investigates the use of adjectiv amplifiers in Australian English and aims to answer whether *very* is replaced by *really* as the dominant amplifying variant.

# Preparation and session set up

Since all examples will be performed in "R", it is necessary to install "R", "RStudio", and "Tinn-R". If these programms (or, in the case of "R", environments) are not already installed on your machine, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain "libraries" or "packages" need to be installed so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the librariesby running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the libraries mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary libraries, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("tm", "dplyr","stringr", "visreg"))
```

One installation may be a little more complex (depending on the type of machine you are using and the version of "R" that the machine is running). To install the development version of the "data.table" package, we need to install it directly from github (rather than a CRAN mirror server).

```{r prep2, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# manual installation
install.packages("devtools")
# load devtools and install development version of data.table
library(devtools)
install_github("Rdatatable/data.table", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

Once you have installed "R", "R-Studio", "Tinn-R", and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Gender Differences in Swearing

This case study aims to answer if the frequency with which speakers use swear words is correlated with the gender of speakers. In a first step, we load the libraries and functions that we need and set the options for the"R" session. 

```{r sw1, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
#library(tm)
#library(data.table)
#library(stringr)
# load function
source("https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/ConcR.r")
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
options(scipen=999)
```

After loading the libraries and functions, we can start loading and processing the data and defining our serach.

```{r sw2, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# define path to corpus data
path <- "https://slcladal.github.io/data/ICEIrelandSample/"
# get list of files in corpus
corpusfiles <- list.files(path = path, pattern = NULL, all.files = T,
                          full.names = T, recursive = T, 
                          ignore.case = T, include.dirs = T)
# load corpus
corpus <- lapply(corpusfiles, function(x){
  x <- scan(x, what = "char", sep = "", quote = "", quiet = T, skipNul = T)
  x <- unlist(x)  
})
# inspect corpus
str(corpus)
corpusfiles


```


```{r sw3, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# load bio data
bio <- read.table("https://slcladal.github.io/data/data01.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")







# define surrounding context for KWIC display
context <- 20
# define that we want everything that preceeds a match for the serach pattern 
all.pre = T
# define search patterns
search.pattern1 <- c("[A|a]rse[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern2 <-  c("[F|f]uck[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern3 <-  c("[S|s]hit[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern4 <-  c("[C|c]ock[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern5 <-  c("[W|w]hore[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern6 <-  c("[A|a]ss")
search.pattern7 <-  c("[D|d]ick[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern8 <-  c("[W|w]anker[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern9 <-  c("[C|c]rap[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern10 <-  c("[B|b]itch[a-z]{0,}")
search.pattern11 <-  c("[D|d]amn[a-z]{0,}")
```

It would, of course, also be possible to search for all search patterns in a single search but it may be advantageous to split search patterns so that the code is easier to parse and understand. After preparing the search, we perform the concordancing. 

```{r sw3, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
# read in text
corpusfiles <- list.files(path)
  
  lapply(path, function(x){
  list.files(path)
  readLines("https://slcladal.github.io/data/origindarwin.txt") %>%
  paste(sep = " ", collapse = " ") %>%
  str_replace_all("(CHAPTER [XVI]{1,7}\\.{0,1}) ", "qwertz\\1") %>%
  tolower() %>%  
  strsplit("qwertz") %>%
  unlist()  
  
})


```{r sw3, eval = T, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# start search
sw1 <- ConcR(pathname, search.pattern1, context, all.pre = T)
sw2 <- ConcR(pathname, search.pattern2, context, all.pre = T)

sw4 <- ConcR(pathname, search.pattern4, context, all.pre = T)
#sw5 <- ConcR(pathname, search.pattern5, context, all.pre = T)
