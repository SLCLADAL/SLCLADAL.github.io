For the more advanced, a recommendable resource for tree-based modeling is @prasad2006newer, @strobl2009tree and @breiman2001modeling. A very good paper dealing with many critical issues related to tree-based models is @gries2021statistics.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://slcladal.github.io/images/yr_chili.jpg){width=15% style=\"float:right; padding:10px\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis tutorial is aimed at intermediate and advanced users of R with the aim of showcasing how to perform tree-based modeling and classification using R. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged analysis but rather to show and exemplify how to implement and perform basic tree-based modeling and classification using R. \n\n<div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#f2f2f2; color:#51247a'>\n<span>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\nThe entire R Notebook for the tutorial can be downloaded [**here**](https://slcladal.github.io/content/tree.Rmd).  If you want to render the R Notebook on your machine, i.e. knitting the document to html or a pdf, you need to make sure that you have R and RStudio installed and you also need to download the [**bibliography file**](https://slcladal.github.io/content/bibliography.bib) and store it in the same folder where you store the Rmd file. <br></p>\n<p style='margin-left:1em;'>\n</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\nTree-structure models  fall into the machine-learning rather than the inference statistics category as they are commonly used for classification and prediction tasks rather than explanation of relationships between variables. The tree structure represents recursive partitioning of the data to minimize residual deviance that is based on iteratively splitting the data into two subsets. \n\nThe most basic type of tree-structure model is a decision tree which is a type of classification and regression tree (CART). A more elaborate version of a CART is called a Conditional Inference Tree (CIT). The difference between a CART and a CIT is that CITs use significance tests, e.g. the p-values, to select and split variables rather than some information measures like the Gini coefficient [@gries2021statistics].\n\nLike random forests, inference trees are non-parametric and thus do not rely on distributional requirements (or at least on fewer).\n\n\n## Advantages {-}\n\nSeveral advantages have been associated with using tree-based models:\n\n1. Tree-structure models are very useful because they are **extremely flexible** as they can deal with different types of variables and provide a very good understanding of the structure in the data. \n\n2. Tree-structure models have been deemed particularly interesting for linguists because they can handle **moderate sample sizes** and many high-order interactions better then regression models. \n\n3. Tree-structure models are (supposedly) better at detecting **non-linear or non-monotonic relationships** between predictors and dependent variables. This also means that they are better at finding and displaying interaction sinvolving many predictors. \n\n4. Tree-structure models are **easy** to implement in R and do not require the model selection, validation, and diagnostics associated with regression models.\n\n5. Tree-structure models can be used as **variable-selection** procedure which informs about which variables have any sort of significant relationship with the dependent variable and can thereby inform model fitting.\n\n## Problems {-}\n\nDespite these potential advantages, a word of warning is in order: @gries2021statistics admits that tree-based models can be very useful but there are some issues that but some serious short-comings of tree-structure models remain under-explored. For instance, \n\n1. Forest-models (Random Forests and Boruta) only inform about the **importance** of a variable but not if the variable is important as a main effect or as part of interactions (or both)! The importance only shows that there is some important connection between the predictor and the dependent variable. While partial dependence plots (see [here](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html) for more information) offer a remedy for this shortcoming to a certain degree, regression models are still much better at dealing with this issue. \n\n2. Simple tree-structure models have been shown to fail in detecting the correct predictors if the variance is solely determined by a **single interaction** [@gries2021statistics, chapter 7.3]. This failure is caused by the fact that the predictor used in the first split of a tree is selected as the one with the strongest main effect [@boulesteix2015interaction, 344]. This issue can, however, be avoided by hard-coding the interactions as predictors plus using ensemble methods such as random forests rather than individual trees [see @gries2021statistics, chapter 7.3]. \n\n3. Another shortcoming is that tree-structure models partition the data (rather than \"fitting a line\" through the data which can lead to more **coarse-grained predictions** compared to regression models when dealing with numeric dependent variables [again, see @gries2021statistics, chapter 7.3]. \n\n4. @boulesteix2015interaction[341] state that high correlations between predictors can hinder the **detection of interactions** when using small data sets. However, regression do not fare better here as they are even more strongly affected by (multi-)collinearity [see @gries2021statistics, chapter 7.3].\n\n5. Tree-structure models are bad a detecting interactions when the variables have **strong main effects** which is, unfortunately, common when dealing with linguistic data [@wrigt2016interac].\n\n6. Tree-structure models cannot handle **factorial variables** with many levels (more than 53 levels) which is very common in linguistics where individual speakers or items are variables.\n\n7. Forest-models (Random Forests and Boruta) have been deemed to be better at dealing with small data sets. However, this is only because the analysis is based on **permutations** of the original small data set. As such, forest-based models only appear to be better at handling small data sets because they \"blow up\" the data set rather than really being better at analyzing the original data.\n\n\nBefore we implement a conditional inference tree in R, we will have a look at how decision trees work. We will do this in more detail here as random forests and Boruta analyses are extensions of inference trees and are therefore based on the same concepts.\n\n\n## Classification And Regression Trees\n\nBelow is an example of a decision tree which shows what what response to expect - in this case whether a speaker uses discourse *like* or not. Decision trees, like all CARTs and CITs, answer a simple question, namely *How do we best classify elements based on the given predictors?*. The answer that decision trees provide is the classification of the elements based on the levels of the predictors. In simple decision trees, all predictors, even those that are not significant are included in the decision tree. The decision tree shows that the best (or most important) predictor for the use of discourse *like* is age as it is the highest node. Among young speakers, those with high status use *like* more compared with speakers of lower social status. Among old speakers, women use discourse *like* more than men.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tree\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"grid\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tree_files/figure-html/cit1a-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe *yes* and *no* at the bottom show if the speaker should be classified as a user of discourse *like* (*yes* or *no*). Each split can be read as *true* to the left and *false* to the right. So that, at the first split, if the person is between the ages of 15 and 40, we need to follow the branch to the left while we need to follow to the right if the person is not 15 to 40.\n\nBefore going through how this conditional decision tree is generated, let us first go over some basic concepts. The top of the decision tree is called *root* or *root node*, the categories at the end of branches are called *leaves* or *leaf nodes*. Nodes that are in-between the root and leaves are called *internal nodes* or just *nodes*. The root node has only arrows or lines pointing away from it, internal nodes have lines going to and from them, while leaf nodes only have lines pointing towards them.\n\nHow to prune and evaluate the accuracy of decision trees is not shown here. If you are interested in this, please check out chapter 7 of @gries2021statistics which is a highly recommendable resource that provide a lot of additional information about decision trees and CARTs. \n\n\n# Tree-Based Models in R {-}\n\nWe will now focus on how to implement tree-based models in R and continue with getting a more detaled understanding og how tree-based methods work.\n\n**Preparation and session set up**\n\nThis tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install packages\ninstall.packages(\"Boruta\")\ninstall.packages(\"tree\")\ninstall.packages(\"caret\")\ninstall.packages(\"cowplot\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggparty\")\ninstall.packages(\"Gmisc\")\ninstall.packages(\"grid\")\ninstall.packages(\"Hmisc\")\ninstall.packages(\"party\")\ninstall.packages(\"partykit\")\ninstall.packages(\"randomForest\")\ninstall.packages(\"pdp\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"RCurl\")\ninstall.packages(\"vip\")\ninstall.packages(\"flextable\")\n# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"rlesur/klippy\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow that we have installed the packages, we can activate them as shown below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set options\noptions(stringsAsFactors = F)\noptions(scipen = 999)\noptions(max.print=10000)\n# load packages\nlibrary(Boruta)\nlibrary(tree)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggparty)\nlibrary(Gmisc)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(Hmisc)\nlibrary(party)\nlibrary(partykit)\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(pdp)\nlibrary(RCurl)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(vip)\nlibrary(flextable)\n# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button\nklippy::klippy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<script>\n  addClassKlippyTo(\"pre.r, pre.markdown\");\n  addKlippy('left', 'top', 'auto', '1', 'Copy code', 'Copied!');\n</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOnce you have installed R, RStudio, and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.\n\n## How Tree-Based Methods Work {-}\n\n\nLet us now go over the process by which the decision tree above is generated. In our example, we want to predict whether a person makes use of discourse *like* given their age, gender, and social status. \n\nLet us now go over the process by which the decision tree above is generated. In our example, we want to predict whether a person makes use of discourse *like* given their age, gender, and social status. \n\nIn a first step, we load and inspect the data that we will use in this tutorial. As tree-based models require either numeric or factorized data, we factorize the \"character\" variables in our data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load data\ncitdata <-

\n\nThe first step in generating a decision tree consists in determining, what the root of the decision tree should be. This means that we have to determine which of the variables represents the root node. In order to do so, we tabulate for each variable level, how many speakers of that level have used discourse *like* (LikeUsers) and how many have not used discourse *like* (NonLikeUsers).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# tabulate data\ntable(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     \n      female male\n  no      43   75\n  yes     91   42\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     \n      15-40 41-80\n  no     34    84\n  yes    92    41\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(citdata$LikeUser, citdata$Status)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     \n      high low\n  no    33  85\n  yes   73  60\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNone of the predictors is perfect (the predictors are therefore referred to as *impure*). To determine which variable is the root, we will calculate the degree of \"impurity\" for each variable - the variable which has the lowest impurity value will be the root.\n\nThe most common measure of impurity in the context of conditional inference trees is called *Gini* (an alternative that is common when generating regression trees is the deviance). The Gini value or gini index was introduced by Corrado Gini as a measure for income inequality. In our case we seek to maximize inequality of distributions of leave nodes which is why the gini index is useful for tree based models. For each level we apply the following equation to determine the gini impurity value:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{x} = 1 - ( p_{1} )^{2} - ( p_{0} )^{2}\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor the node for men, this would mean the following:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{men} = 1-(\\frac{42} {42+75})^{2} - (\\frac{75} {42+75})^{2} = 0.4602235\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor women, we calculate G or Gini as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{women} = 1-(\\frac{91} {91+43})^{2} - (\\frac{43} {91+43})^{2} = 0.4358432\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nTo calculate the Gini value of Gender, we need to calculate the weighted average leaf node impurity (weighted because the number of speakers is different in each group). We calculate the weighted average leaf node impurity using the equation below. \n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{Gender} = \\frac{N_{men}} {N_{Total}} \\times G_{men} +  \\frac{N_{women}} {N_{Total}} \\times G_{women}\n\nG_{Gender} = \\frac{159} {303} \\times 0.4602235 +  \\frac{144} {303} \\times 0.4358432 = 0.4611915\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe will now perform the gini-calculation for gender (see below).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# calculate Gini for men\ngini_men <- 1-(42/(42+75))^2 - (75/(42+75))^2\n# calculate Gini for women\ngini_women <- 1-(91/(91+43))^2 - (43/(91+43))^2\n# calculate weighted average of Gini for Gender\ngini_gender <- 42/(42+75)* gini_men +  91/(91+43) * gini_women\ngini_gender\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.4611915\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe gini for gender is 0.4612.

Then, we would continue doing the same for the remaining branches until the entire data is binned into different leaf nodes.\n\n\nIn addition to plotting the decision tree, we can also check its accuracy. To do so, we predict the use of *like* based on the decision tree and compare them to the observed uses of *like*. Then we use the `confusionMatrix` function from the `caret` package to get an overview of the accuracy statistics.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndtreeprediction <- as.factor(ifelse(predict(dtree)[,2] > .5, \"yes\", \"no\"))\nconfusionMatrix(dtreeprediction, citdata$LikeUser)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe conditional inference tree has an accuracy of 72.9 percent which is significantly better than the base-line accuracy of 53.0 percent (No Information Rate $*$ 100). To understand what the other statistics refer to and how they are calculated, run the command `?confusionMatrix`. \n\n## Splitting numeric, ordinal, and true categorical variables{-}\n\nWhile it is rather straight forward to calculate the Gini values for categorical variables, it may not seem quite as apparent how to calculate splits for numeric or ordinal variables. To illustrate how the algorithm works on such variables, consider the example data set shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div

age. How this is done is shown below for the first split.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{x} = 1 - ( p_{1} )^{2} - ( p_{0} )^{2}\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor an age smaller than 18.5 this would mean:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{youngerthan18.5} = 1-(\\frac{1} {1+0})^{2} - (\\frac{0} {1+0})^{2} = 0.0\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor an age greater than 18.5, we calculate G or Gini as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{olerthan18.5} = 1-(\\frac{2} {2+3})^{2} - (\\frac{3} {2+3})^{2} = 0.48\n\n\\end{equation}\n\n Now, we calculate the Gini for that split as we have done above.\n \n\\begin{equation}\n\nG_{split18.5} = \\frac{N_{youngerthan18.5}} {N_{Total}} \\times G_{youngerthan18.5} +  \\frac{N_{olderthan18.5}} {N_{Total}} \\times G_{olderthan18.5}\n\nG_{split18.5} = \\frac{1} {6} \\times 0.0 +  \\frac{5} {6} \\times 0.48 = 0.4\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe then have to calculate the gini values for all possible age splits which yields the following results:\n\n\n:::

Accordingly, we would split the data between speakers who are younger than 52.5 and speakers who are older than 52.5 years of age. The lowest Gini value for any age split would also be the Gini value that would be compared to other variables. \n\nThe same procedure that we have used to determine potential splits for a numeric variable would apply to an ordinal variable with only two differences:\n\n* The Gini values are calculated for the actual levels and not the means between variable levels. \n* The Gini value is nor calculated for the lowest and highest level as the calculation of the Gini values is impossible for extreme values. Extreme levels can, therefore, not serve as a potential split location. \n\nWhen dealing with categorical variables with more than two levels, the situation is slightly more complex as we would also have to calculate the Gini values for combinations of variable levels. While the calculations are, in principle, analogous to the ones performed for binary of nominal categorical variables, we would also have to check if combinations would lead to improved splits. For instance, imagine we have a variable with categories A, B, and C. In such cases we would not only have to calculate the Gini scores for A, B, and C but also for A plus B, A plus C, and B plus C. Note that we ignore the combination A plus B plus C as this combination would include all other potential combinations. \n\n\n# Conditional Inference Trees\n\nConditional Inference Trees (CITs) are much better at determining the *true* effect of a predictor, i.e. the effect of a predictor if all other effects are simultaneously considered. In contrast to CARTs, CITs use p-values to determine splits in the data. Below is a conditional inference tree which shows how and what factors contribute to the use of discourse *like*. In conditional inference trees predictors are only included if the predictor is significant (i.e. if these predictors are necessary). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitdata <- read.delim(\"https://slcladal.github.io/data/treedata.txt\", header = T, sep = \"\\t\")\nset.seed(111)        # set.seed\n# apply bonferroni correction (1 minus alpha multiplied by n of predictors)\ncontrol = ctree_control(mincriterion = 1-(.05*ncol(citdata)-1))\n# convert character strings to factors\ncitdata <- citdata %>%\n  dplyr::mutate_if(is.character, factor)\n# create initial conditional inference tree model\ncitd.ctree <- partykit::ctree(LikeUser ~ Age + Gender + Status,\n                    data = citdata)\nplot(citd.ctree, gp = gpar(fontsize = 8)) # plot final ctree\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tree_files/figure-html/cit1b-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Prettifying your CIT tree{-}\n\nThe easiest and most common way to visualize CITs is to simply use the `plot` function from `base R`. However, using this function does not allow to adapt and customize the visualization except for some very basic parameters. The `ggparty` function allows to use the `ggplot` syntax to customize CITs which allows more adjustments and is more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nTo generate this customized CIT, we activate the `ggparty` package and extract the significant p-values from the CIT object. We then plot the CIT and define the nodes, edges, and text elements as shown below. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# extract p-values\npvals <- unlist(nodeapply(citd.ctree, ids = nodeids(citd.ctree), function(n) info_node(n)$p.value))\npvals <- pvals[pvals <.05]\n# plotting\nggparty(citd.ctree) +\n  geom_edge() +\n  geom_edge_label() +\n  geom_node_label(line_list = list(aes(label = splitvar),\n                                   aes(label = paste0(\"N=\", nodesize, \", p\", \n                                                      ifelse(pvals < .001, \"<.001\", paste0(\"=\", round(pvals, 3)))), \n                                       size = 10)),\n                  line_gpar = list(list(size = 13), \n                                   list(size = 10)), \n                  ids = \"inner\") +\n  geom_node_label(aes(label = paste0(\"Node \", id, \", N = \", nodesize)),\n    ids = \"terminal\", nudge_y = -0.0, nudge_x = 0.01) +\n  geom_node_plot(gglist = list(\n    geom_bar(aes(x = \"\", fill = LikeUser),\n             position = position_fill(), color = \"black\"),\n      theme_minimal(),\n      scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray50\", \"gray80\"), guide = FALSE),\n      scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1)),\n    xlab(\"\"), \n    ylab(\"Probability\"),\n    geom_text(aes(x = \"\", group = LikeUser,\n                  label = stat(count)),\n              stat = \"count\", position = position_fill(), vjust = 1.1)),\n    shared_axis_labels = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tree_files/figure-html/pretty-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can also use `position_dodge` (instead of `position_fill`) to display frequencies rather than probabilities as shown below. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# plotting\nggparty(citd.ctree) +\n  geom_edge() +\n  geom_edge_label() +\n  geom_node_label(line_list = list(aes(label = splitvar),\n                                   aes(label = paste0(\"N=\", nodesize, \", p\", \n                                                      ifelse(pvals < .001, \"<.001\", paste0(\"=\", round(pvals, 3)))), \n                                       size = 10)),\n                  line_gpar = list(list(size = 13), \n                                   list(size = 10)), \n                  ids = \"inner\") +\n  geom_node_label(aes(label = paste0(\"Node \", id, \", N = \", nodesize)),\n    ids = \"terminal\", nudge_y = 0.01, nudge_x = 0.01) +\n  geom_node_plot(gglist = list(\n    geom_bar(aes(x = \"\", fill = LikeUser),\n             position = position_dodge(), color = \"black\"),\n      theme_minimal(),\n    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), \n            panel.grid.minor = element_blank()),\n      scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray50\", \"gray80\"), guide = FALSE),\n      scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 20),\n                         limits = c(0, 100)),\n    xlab(\"\"), \n    ylab(\"Frequency\"),\n      geom_text(aes(x = \"\", group = LikeUser,\n                    label = stat(count)),\n                stat = \"count\", \n                position = position_dodge(0.9), vjust = -0.7)),\n    shared_axis_labels = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tree_files/figure-html/plotctree-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Problems of Conditional Inference Trees{-}\n\nLike other tree-based methods, CITs are very intuitive, multivariate, non-parametric, they do not require large data sets, and they are easy to implement. Despite these obvious advantages, they have at least one major short coming compared to other, more sophisticated tree-structure models (in addition to the general issues that tree-structure models exhibit as discussed above: they are prone to **overfitting** which means that they fit the observed data very well but preform much worse when being applied to new data.\n\nAn extension which remedies this problem is to use a so-called ensemble method which grows many varied trees. The most common ensemble method is called a *Random Forest Analysis* and will have a look at how Random Forests work and how to implement them in R in the next section. \n\n#  Random Forests\n\nRandom Forests (RFs) are an extension of Conditional Inference Trees [@breiman2001rf]. Like Conditional Inference Trees, Random Forests represent a multivariate, non-parametric partitioning method that is particularly useful when dealing with relatively small sample sizes and many predictors (including interactions) and they are insensitive to multicollinearity (if two predictors strongly correlate with the dependent variable AND are highly correlated or collinear, RFs will report both variables as highly important - the ordering in which they were included into the model is irrelevant). The latter point is a real advantage over regression models in particular. Also, RFs outperform CITs in that they are substantially less prone to overfitting and they perform much better when applied to new data. However, random forests have several issues:\n\n* RFs only show variable importance but not if the variable is positively or negatively correlated with the dependent variable;\n\n* RFs do not report if a variable is important as a main effect or as part of an interactions \n\n* RFs do not indicate in which significant interactions a variable is involved.\n\nTherefore, Random Forest analyses are ideal for classification, imputing missing values, and - though to a lesser degree - as a variable selection procedure but they do not lend themselves for drawing inferences about the relationships of predictors and dependent variables. \n\n**Bootstrapped Data**\n\nRandom Forests do not work on one-and-the-same data set (as CITs do) but in Random Forest analyses, many samples (with replacement) are drawn from the original data set. This generation of new data set based on an existing data set is called \"bootstrapping\". Bootstrapping allows us to produce many trees based on variations of the original data set rather than dealing with only a single, fixed data set that would produce only a single tree. Therefore, because the data is different each time, the individual CITs are also different. \n\nImagine, we are dealing with a very small data set to which we want to apply a Random Forest Analysis. The original data set is displayed below. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div

missing.\n\n### Out-Of-Bag data{-}\n\nBecause the data is reshuffled for every new tree, a part of the data (on average about 30%) remains unused for a given tree. The data that is not used is called Out-Of-Bag data or OOB. The OOB is important because the quality of the overall performance of the random forest can be assessed by applying the resulting tree-model to the data that it was not fit to. The quality of that tree is then measured in the OOB error, which is the error rate of the respective tree if applied to the OOB data.\n\n### Random Variable Selection{-}\n\nRandom Forests also differ from simple CITs in that at each step, not all possible variables are considered for a node, but only a subset. For example, we have a data set with five predicting independent variables and one dependent variable. When generating a CIT, all possible variables (variables that do not represent a node further up in the tree) are considered as splitting candidates. In Random Forests, only a fixed number (typically the square-root of the number of independent variables) are considered as candidates for a node. So, at each potential split, a fixed number of randomly selected variables is considered potential node candidates.\n\n## Random Forests in R{-}\n\nThis section shows how a Random Forest Analysis can be implemented in R. Ina first step, we load and inspect the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load random forest data\nrfdata <- read.delim(\"https://slcladal.github.io/data/mblrdata.txt\", header = T, sep

Our dependent variable is `SUFlike` which stands for speech-unit final *like* (a pragmatic marker that is common in Irish English and is used as in *A wee girl of her age, like*). While Age and Gender are pretty straight forward what they are called, *ConversationType* encodes whether a conversation has taken place between interlocutors of the same or of different genders.\n\nBefore going any further, we need to factorize the variables as tree-based models require factors instead of character variables (but they can, of course, handle numeric and ordinal variables). In addition, we will check if the data contains missing values (NAs; NA stands for *not available*).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# factorize variables (rf require factors instead of

Random Forests offer a very nice way to deal with missing data though. If NAs are present, they can either be deleted OR their values for any missing values can be imputed using proximities. In this way, such data points do not have to be removed which can be problematic especially when dealing with relatively small data sets. For imputing values, you could run the code below but as our data does not have NAs, we will skip this step and just show it here so you can have a look at how it is done.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# replacing NAs with estimates\ndata.imputed <- rfImpute(SUFlike ~ ., data = rfdata, iter=6)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe argument `iter` refers to the number of iterations to run.

When we were to set `iter` to 20, we get values a little better and a little worse, so doing more iterations doesn't improve the situation.\n\nAlso, if you want to customize the `rfImpute` function, you can change the number of trees it uses (the default is 300) and the number of variables that it will consider at each step.\n\nWe will now generate a first random forest object and inspect its model fit.

If the thing we're trying to predict is a \"factor\" (i.e. either \"yes/no\"  or \"ranked\"), then `randomForest()` will set `mtry` to  the square root of the number of variables (rounded down to the next  integer value).Again, we start by setting a seed  to store random numbers and thus make results reproducible.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set.seed\nset.seed(2019120205)\nrfmodel2 <- randomForest::randomForest(SUFlike ~ ., \n                                       data=rfdata, \n                                       mtry = 2,\n                                       proximity=TRUE)\n# inspect model\nrfmodel2 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\n randomForest(formula = SUFlike ~ ., data = rfdata, mtry = 2,      proximity = TRUE) \n               Type of random forest: regression\n                     Number of trees: 500\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 2\n\n          Mean of squared residuals: 0.1277716\n                    % Var explained: 10.28\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output tells us that the model explains less than 15 percent of the variance.

This allows us to evaluate how well the RF performs on data that it was not trained on. This approach is particularly common in machine learning contexts. \n\n# Boruta\n\nBoruta [@kursa2010feature] is a variable selection procedure and it represents an extension of random forest analyses [@breiman2001rf]. The name *Boruta* is derived from a demon in Slavic mythology who dwelled in pine forests. Boruta is an alternative to regression modeling that is better equipped to handle small data sets because it uses a distributional approach during which hundreds of (random) forests are grown from permuted data sets. \n\n## Advantages {-}\n\nBoruta outperforms random forest analyses because:\n\n* Boruta does not provide merely a single value for each predictor but a distribution of values leading to higher reliability. \n\n* Boruta provides definitive cut-off points for variables that have no meaningful relationship with the dependent variable. This is a crucial difference between RF and Boruta that make Boruta particularly interesting from a variable selection point of view.\n\n## Procedure {-}\n\nThe Boruta procedure consists out of five steps. \n\n* In a first step, the Boruta algorithm copies the data set and adds randomness to the data by (re-)shuffling data points and thereby creating randomized variables. These randomized variables are referred to as shadow features. \n\n* Secondly, a random forest classifier is trained on the extended data set. \n\n* In a third step, a feature importance measure (Mean Decrease Accuracy represented by z-scores) is calculated to determine the relative importance of all predictors (both original or real variables and the randomized shadow features). \n\n* In the next step, it is checked at each iteration of the process whether a real predictor has a higher importance compared with the best shadow feature. The algorithm keeps track of the performance of the original variables by storing whether they outperformed the best shadow feature or not in a vector. \n\n* In the fifth step, predictors that did not outperform the best shadow feature are removed and the process continues without them. After a set number of iterations, or if all the variables have been either confirmed as outperforming the best shadow feature, the algorithm stops. \n\nDespite its obvious advantages of Boruta over random forest analyses and regression modeling, it can neither handle multicollinearity not hierarchical data structures where data points are nested or grouped by a given predictor (as is the case in the present analysis as data points are grouped by adjective type). As Boruta is a variable selection procedure, it is also limited in the sense that it provides information on which predictors to include and how good these predictors are (compared to the shadow variables) while it is neither able to take hierarchical data structure into account, nor does it provide information about how one level of a factor compares to other factors. In other words, Boruta shows that a predictor is relevant and how strong it is but it does not provide information on how the likelihood of an outcome being used differs between variable levels, for instance between men and women. \n\n## Boruta in R{-}\n\nWe begin by loading and inspecting the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load data\nborutadata <- read.delim(\"https://slcladal.github.io/data/ampaus05_statz.txt\", header = T, sep = \"\\t\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div

We thus continue by removing variables that were confirmed as being unimportant, then setting a new seed, re-running the Boruta on the reduced data set, and again inspecting the decisions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# remove irrelevant variables\nrejected <- names(boruta1$finalDecision)[which(boruta1$finalDecision == \"Rejected\")]\n# update data for boruta\nborutadata <- borutadata %>%\n  dplyr::select(-rejected)\n# set.seed (to store random numbers and thus make results reproducible)\nset.seed(2019120208)\n# 2nd run\nboruta2 <- Boruta(really~.,data=borutadata)\nprint(boruta2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nBoruta performed 99 iterations in 7.846175 secs.\n 8 attributes confirmed important: Adjective, AudienceSize,\nConversationType, Emotionality, FileSpeaker and 3 more;\n No attributes deemed unimportant.\n 1 tentative attributes left: Gradabilty;\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# extract decision\ngetConfirmedFormula(boruta2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nreally ~ Adjective + FileSpeaker + Function + ConversationType + \n    AudienceSize + very + Freq + Emotionality\n<environment: 0x561539916328>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnly adjective frequency and adjective type are confirmed as being important while all other variables are considered tentative. However, no more variables need to be removed as all remaining variables are not considered unimportant. In a last step, we visualize the results of the Boruta analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nborutadf <- as.data.frame(boruta2$ImpHistory) %>%\n  tidyr::gather(Variable, Importance, Adjective:shadowMin) %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(Type = ifelse(str_detect(Variable, \"shadow\"), \"Control\", \"Predictor\")) %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(Type = factor(Type),\n                Variable = factor(Variable))\nggplot(borutadf, aes(x = reorder(Variable, Importance, mean), y = Importance, fill = Type)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=3.5, linetype=\"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray80\", \"gray40\")) +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +\n  labs(x = \"Variable\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tree_files/figure-html/bo7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf the remaining variables, adjective frequency and adjective type have the strongest effect and are confirmed as being important while syntactic function fails to perform better than the best shadow variable. All other variables have only a marginal effect on the use of really as an adjective amplifier.\n\n\n# Citation & Session Info {-}\n\nSchweinberger, Martin. 2022. *Tree-Based Models in R*.
