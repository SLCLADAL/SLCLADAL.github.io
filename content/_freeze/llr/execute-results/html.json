The aim of this tutorial is to showcase how to extract information from essays from learners and L1 speakers of English and how to analyze these essays. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged analysis but rather to show and exemplify some common methods for data extraction, processing, and analysis.\n\n\n<div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#f2f2f2; color:#51247a'>\n<span>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\nThe entire R Notebook for the tutorial can be downloaded [**here**](https://slcladal.github.io/content/llr.Rmd).

If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the packages so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install packages\ninstall.packages(\"quanteda\")\ninstall.packages(\"flextable\")\ninstall.packages(\"quanteda.textstats\")\ninstall.packages(\"quanteda.textplots\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"tm\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidytext\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"NLP\")\ninstall.packages(\"openNLP\")\ninstall.packages(\"openNLPdata\")\ninstall.packages(\"koRpus\")\ninstall.packages(\"stringi\")\ninstall.packages(\"hunspell\")\ninstall.packages(\"wordcloud2\")\ninstall.packages(\"pacman\")\n# install the language support package\nkoRpus::install.koRpus.lang(\"en\")\n# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"rlesur/klippy\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have installed the packages, we can activate them as shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set options\noptions(stringsAsFactors = F)\noptions(scipen = 999)\noptions(max.print=1000)\noptions(java.parameters = c(\"-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC\", \"-Xmx8192m\"))\n#gc()\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(flextable)\nlibrary(tm)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(NLP)\nlibrary(openNLP)\nlibrary(quanteda)\nlibrary(quanteda.textstats)\nlibrary(quanteda.textplots)\nlibrary(koRpus)\nlibrary(koRpus.lang.en)\nlibrary(stringi)\nlibrary(hunspell)\nlibrary(wordcloud2)\nlibrary(pacman)\npacman::p_load_gh(\"trinker/entity\")\n# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button\nklippy::klippy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<script>\n  addClassKlippyTo(\"pre.r, pre.markdown\");\n  addKlippy('left', 'top', 'auto', '1', 'Copy code', 'Copied!');\n</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce you have installed R and RStudio and once you have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.\n\n**Loading data**\n\nWe use 7 essays written by learners from the [*International Corpus of Learner English* (ICLE)](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/icle.html) and two files containing a-level essays written by L1-English British students from [*The Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays* (LOCNESS)](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/locness.html) which was compiled by the *Centre for English Corpus Linguistics* (CECL), Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

Those who share this point of view usually say that at present we are so very much under the domination of science, industry, technology, ever-increasing tempo of our lives and so on, that neither dreaming nor imagination can possibly survive. Their usual argument is very simple - they suggest to their opponents to look at some samples of the modern art and to compare them to the masterpieces of the \\\"Old Masters\\\" of painting, music, literature.\"\n[2] \"As everything which is simple, the argument sounds very convincing. Of course, it is evident, that no modern writer, painter or musician can be compare to such names as Bach, Pushkin< Byron, Mozart, Rembrandt, Raffael et cetera. Modern pictures, in the majority of cases, seem to be merely repetitions or combinations of the images and methods of painting, invented very long before. The same is also true to modern verses, novels and songs.\"                                                                                                                        \n[3] \"But, I think, those, who put forward this argument, play - if I may put it like this - not fair game with their opponents, because such an approach presupposes the firm conviction, that dreaming and imagination can deal only with Arts, moreover, only with this \\\"well-established set\\\" of Arts, which includes music, painting, architecture, sculpture and literature. That is, a person, who follows the above-mentioned point of view tries to make his opponent take for granted the statement, the evidence of which is, to say the least, doubtful.\"                 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe data inspection shows the first 3 text elements from the essay written a Russian learner of English to provide an idea of what the data look like. \n\nNow that we have loaded some data, we can go ahead and extract information from the texts and process the data to analyze differences between L1 speakers and learners of English.\n\n# Concordancing{-}\n\nConcordancing refers to the extraction of words or phrases from a given text or texts [@lindquist2009corpus]. Commonly, concordances are displayed in the form of key-word in contexts (KWIC) where the search term is shown with some preceding and following context. Thus, such displays are referred to as key word in context concordances. A more elaborate tutorial on how to perform concordancing with R is available [here](https://slcladal.github.io/kwics.html).\n\n\nConcordancing is helpful for seeing how a given term or phrased is used in the data, for inspecting how often a given word occurs in a text or a collection of texts, for extracting examples, and it also represents a basic procedure, and often the first step, in more sophisticated analyses. \n\nWe begin by creating KWIC displays of the term *problem* as shown below. To extract the kwic concordances, we use the `kwic` function from the `quanteda` package [cf. @benoit2018quanteda]. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# combine data from l1 speakers\nl1 <- c(ns1, ns2)\n# combine data from learners\nlearner <- c(de, es, fr, it, pl, ru)\n# extract kwic for term \"problem\" in learner data\nkwic <- quanteda::kwic(learner,               # the data in which to search\n                       pattern = \"problem.*\", # the pattern to look for\n                       valuetype = \"regex\",   # look for exact matches or patterns\n                       window = 10) %>%       # how much context to display (in elements) \n  # convert to table (called data.frame in R)\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  # remove superfluous columns\n  dplyr::select(-to, -from, -pattern)\n# inspect\nhead(kwic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  docname                                                     pre  keyword\n1  text12                      Many of the drug addits have legal problems\n2  text12     countries , like Spain , illegal .

For instance, use the `textplot_xray` function from the `quanteda.textplots` package to visualize where in some texts the term *people* and the term *imagination*  occurs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create kwics for people and imagination\nkwic_people <- quanteda::kwic(learner, pattern = c(\"people\", \"imagination\"))\n# generate x-ray plot\nquanteda.textplots::textplot_xray(kwic_people)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](llr_files/figure-html/conc4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also search for phrases rather than individual words. To do this, we need to use the `phrase` function in the `pattern` argument as shown below. In the code chunk below, we look for any combination of the word *very* and any following word. It we would wish, we could of course also  sort (or order) the concordances as we have done above.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# generate kwic for phrases staring with very\nkwic <-

collocation networks{-}\n\nNetwork graphs are a very useful and flexible tool for visualizing relationships between elements such as words, personas, or authors. This section shows how to generate a network graph for collocations of the term *transport* using the `quanteda` package.\n\nIn a first step, we generate a document-feature matrix based on the sentences in the L1 data. A document-feature matrix shows how often elements (here these elements are the words that occur in the L1 data) occur in a selection of documents (here these documents are the sentences in the L1 data).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create document-feature matrix\nns_dfm <- ns_sen %>% \n  #quanteda::dfm(remove_punct = TRUE) %>%\n    quanteda::dfm(remove = stopwords('english'),

This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year, consequently putting pressure on the UKs transports network. The biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities. Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour periods. Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters, clean, easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads. For commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing, more comfortable and cheaper. Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended, widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic, we are our own enemy! Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer, creating smog and forming acid rain. Tourturing the Earth we are living on. In concluding I wish to propose clean, efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future.\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn a next step, we can apply the `lex.div` function from the `koRpus` package which calculates the different lexical diversity measures for us.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# extract lex. div. measures\nns1_lds <- lapply(ns1_ess, function(x){\n  x <- koRpus::lex.div(x, force.lang = 'en', # define language \n                       segment = 20,      # define segment width\n                       window = 20,       # define window width\n                       quiet = T,\n                       # define lex div measures\n                       measure=c(\"TTR\", \"C\", \"R\", \"CTTR\", \"U\", \"Maas\"),\n                       char=c(\"TTR\", \"C\", \"R\", \"CTTR\",\"U\", \"Maas\"))\n})\n# inspect\nns1_lds[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n\nTotal number of tokens: 217 \nTotal number of types:  134\n\nType-Token Ratio\n               TTR: 0.62 \n\nTTR characteristics:\n   Min. 1st Qu.
