The scientific interest of such questions typically lies not merely in the contingent facts of today’s particular languages and language families, rather the goal is to characterize the nature of human language in general, using today’s contingent empirical data as evidence. One of the key challenges that makes this task difficult to carry out in a principled way is that languages are historically related to each other. This document is a practical introduction to the use of _phylogenetic comparative methods_, which will help to meet this challenge in a principled way.\n\n**Preparation and session set up**\n\nThis tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code in subsequent sections, please first install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set options\noptions(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation\noptions(\"scipen\" = 100, \"digits\" = 4) # suppress math annotation\n# install packages\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"flextable\")\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"phangorn\")\n# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks\ndevtools::install_github(\"rlesur/klippy\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"erichround/phyloWeights\", \n                         dependencies = T, \n                         INSTALL_opts = c(\"--no-multiarch\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"erichround/glottoTrees\", \n                         dependencies = T, \n                         INSTALL_opts = c(\"--no-multiarch\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we activate the packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# activate packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(flextable)\nlibrary(phyloWeights)\nlibrary(glottoTrees)\nlibrary(ape)\n# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button\nklippy::klippy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<script>\n  addClassKlippyTo(\"pre.r, pre.markdown\");\n  addKlippy('left', 'top', 'auto', '1', 'Copy code', 'Copied!');\n</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce you have installed R, RStudio, and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.\n\n## An intuitive introduction to the challenge of genealogy{-}\n\nTo get an intuitive notion of the challenge that is presented by the genealogical relatedness of languages, consider the small language family pictured in the figure below. It contains four languages, which are either SOV or SVO. The question is: What proportion of this family is SOV? Should you just count the languages, in which case the answer is literally 75%? This answer may seem not quite right, because now one half of the family is counting three times as much as the other half, just because it had the fortune of containing more languages. Put another way, the figure of 75% is strongly influenced by contingencies of history.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/SOV-tree-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn a LADAL seminar on 4 November, 2021 [@macklin-cordes_phylogenetic_2021] and in a related journal article [@macklin-cordes_challenges_nodate], Jayden Macklin-Cordes and I review some of history of thinking in linguists' attempts to account for historical relatedness of exactly this kind when comparing across languages. We also explain how _phylogenetic comparative methods_ present the most principled response to it developed so far. We recommend reviewing either of these sources, since they cover the scientific content which corresponds to the practical, technical content in this tutorial. Here, we will not review the scientific content at any length.\n\nThis document provides a guide to the practical use of phylogenetic comparative methods for linguistic typology, specifically, the calculation of genealogically-sensitive proportions and averages. These are methods which provide an answer to the question: \"When characterising the frequencies of traits among the world’s languages, how can we take genealogy into account?\" Here we cover two methods for calculating genealogically-sensitive proportions and averages: the 'ACL' method [@altschul_weights_1989] and the 'BM' method [@stone_constructing_2007].\n\nBecause a key part of this kind of analysis is the preparation of a phylogenetic tree, an important component of the tutorial will be about how such trees can be prepared. \n\nThe tutorial is divided into four main sections. Section [Trees in R](#Trees-in-R) is an introduction to how trees are represented in R. Section [Genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions](#Genealogically-sensitive-averages-and-proportions) discusses the calculation of genealogically-sensitive proportions and averages. Section [Using and adapting trees from glottolog.com](#Using-and-adapting-trees-from-glottolog.com)\n explains how typologists can prepare phylogenetic trees by adapting resources freely available from glottolog.com [@glottolog]. And Section [Putting it together: A worked example](#Putting-it-together:-A-worked-example) provides a worked example used in a typological investigation of sonority sequencing by @yin_violations_2020.\n\nMuch of the discussion below is an introduction to the functionality of two R packages, `glottoTrees` [@glottoTrees] and `phyloWeights` [@phyloWeights], which have been specifically written for these tasks. The text of this tutorial is taken largely from the Supplementary Materials section S1 of @macklin-cordes_challenges_nodate.\n\n<!-- This document represents an empty R Markdown file (or Rmd file) for a LADAL tutorial. The R Markdown document for this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/content/base.Rmd). -->\n\n<!-- You will also have to download the bibliography file from https://slcladal.github.io/content/bibliography.bib for the tutorial to be knitted correctly. Although the knitted (or rendered) html file will look different from the LADAL design (because we have modified the theme for the LADAL page), it will be just like a proper LADAL tutorial once we have knitted the Rmd file on our machines and integrated your tutorial into the LADAL website. -->\n\n# Trees in R {#r-trees}\n\nThis section discusses how trees are created, manipulated and plotted in R. Terminology we will use includes: _tips_ at the ends of trees, which in a linguistic tree would usually be the languages or lects; the _branches_ of a tree; the _interior nodes_ or just _nodes_ of a tree, where branches join together; and the _root_ of the tree, its deepest node. R will represent trees as complex objects, in which the tips, nodes and branches all appear, along with labels for the tips and nodes. \n\nOne of the simplest methods of constructing a tree in R begins with a description of the tree using a form a bracketing notation known as the _Newick_ standard [@Newick]. In its simplest form, a tree is represented in Newick format by a set of tip labels grouped by parentheses, separated by commas, and ending with a semicolon. For example, here is a string that represents a tree with four tips, `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`, which we assign to the object `my_newick`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_newick <- \"(((A,B),C),D);\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nA Newick-formatted string can then be converted to a tree object by supplying it as the `text` argument of the function `read.tree()`, from the `ape` package:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_tree <- read.tree(text = my_newick)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can plot the tree using the `plot()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(my_tree)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy default, trees in R are plotted horizontally following the convention in biology. The `glottoTrees` package provides a function `plot_glotto()` which plots trees in a more typical, downward-running linguistic format, as below.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_glotto(my_tree)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe tree object `my_tree` which we defined above did not include information about branch lengths. In Newick format, branch lengths are written with a preceding colon and appear directly after a language or the closing bracket for a subgroup:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_newick2 <- \"(((A:4,B:4):1,C:5):3,D:8);\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nConverting this to a tree object and plotting it:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_tree2 <- read.tree(text = my_newick2)\nplot_glotto(my_tree2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTrees can have labels not only for their tips, but also for their internal nodes. In linguistics, an internal node of a tree may be interpreted taxonomically, as representing a subgroup and labeled accordingly, or genealogically, as a proto-language from which the subgroup descends and labeled accordingly. In Newick format, labels for internal nodes are placed directly after a closing parenthesis. For example, here we add labels that reflect a genealogical interpretation of the nodes:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_newick3 <- \"(((A:4,B:4)proto-AB:1,C:5)proto-ABC:3,D:8)proto-ABCD;\"\nmy_tree3 <- read.tree(text = my_newick3)\nplot_glotto(my_tree3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTechnically speaking, trees are represented by R as objects with a customised class called `phylo`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(my_tree3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"phylo\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA `phylo` object stores information about the tree _topology_ (i.e., its branching structure), the branch lengths, and the labels of the tips and nodes. In R we often use the `$` operator to access one object that is contained inside another. For instance, the object `y` contained within the larger object `x` would be referred to as `x$y`. Here are some examples:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_tree3$edge.length\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3 1 4 4 5 8\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_tree3$tip.label\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_tree3$node.label\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"proto-ABCD\" \"proto-ABC\"  \"proto-AB\"  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother object class in R, related to the `phylo` class, is the `multiPhylo` class. Objects of the `multiPhylo` class are used to store multiple `phylo` trees in a single, larger object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnewick_a <- \"(((A:4,B:4):1,C:5):3,D:8);\"\nnewick_b <- \"((A:2,B:2):1,(C:1,D:1,E:1):2);\"\ntree_a <- read.tree(text = newick_a)\ntree_b <- read.tree(text = newick_b)\nmy_multiPhylo <- c(tree_a, tree_b)\nclass(my_multiPhylo)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"multiPhylo\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor reasons we won't go into here, the `phylo` trees inside a `multiPhylo` object are not accessed using the `$` operator but using double square brackets. For example, here we refer to the second tree inside the object `my_multiPhylo` by writing `my_multiPhylo[[2]]`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_glotto(my_multiPhylo[[2]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBefore concluding this section, a final word is in order about the irrelevance of the left-to-right arrangement of trees. In a tree, there is no meaningful difference between (A,B) and (B,A): in both, A and B are sisters under a shared parent node. Similarly, these are all equivalent: (A,B,C), (A,C,B), (B,A,C), (B,C,A), (C,A,B) and (C,B,A). And likewise, these are all equivalent: (A,(B,C)), (A,(C,B)), ((B,C),A) and ((C,B),A).\n\n\n\n# Genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions {#averages}\n\nWe now turn to the calculation of genealogically-sensitive proportions and averages. To begin, consider these six trees, which represent six different hypotheses about the genealogical relationships between languages `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`. Also plotted here are the languages' dominant word orders and their numbers of consonant phonemes. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672 height=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nQuestions that we seek to answer are: what is the proportion of this set of languages that is SOV?; and what is the average number of consonant phonemes in this set of languages? Moreover, we want the answers to be sensitive to genealogy, and we're interested in how the answers may vary according to which of these six genealogical hypotheses is adopted.\n\nCalculating genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions will require two key components:\n\n1. A `phylo` or `multiPhylo` object containing one or more trees.\n2. A dataframe, which (i) contains the typological data to be averaged and (ii) relates that data to the tips of the trees.\n\nThe `phylo` or `multiPhylo` object can be manually defined, as described in Section [Trees in R](#Trees-in-R), can be read from a file,[^1] or it can be constructed by using and adjusting materials freely available from glottolog.com, as described below in Section [Using and adapting trees from glottolog.com](#Using-and-adapting-trees-from-glottolog.com). In this example, our six trees can be manually defined using the code below, which places them inside a single `multiPhylo` object named `multi_phylo_ABCD`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiPhylo_ABCD <- \n  c(read.tree(text = \"(((A:0.2,B:0.2,C:0.2):1.8,D:2):0.3);\"),\n    read.tree(text = \"(((A:1,B:1,C:1):1,D:2):0.3);\"), \n    read.tree(text = \"(((A:1.8,B:1.8,C:1.8):0.2,D:2):0.3);\"), \n    read.tree(text = \"((((A:1,B:1):0.8,C:1.8):0.2,D:2):0.3);\"),\n    read.tree(text = \"(((A:1.8,(B:1,C:1):0.8):0.2,D:2):0.3);\"),\n    read.tree(text = \"(((A:1,B:1):1,(C:1.8,D:1.8):0.2):0.3);\")\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\n[^1]: See online documentation of the `ape` package for reading trees from various common file formats.\n\nThe dataframe can be manually defined or be read from a file. Perhaps the easiest method is to read from a file that you have created and saved in \"CSV\" (comma separated value) format. CSV files can be created in commercial spreadsheet software like Excel, and then read by R using the `read.csv()` function like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_dataframe <- read.csv(\"my_csv_file.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe dataframe must contain one column named `tip` (note that in R, names of columns and other objects are case sensitive) plus at least one column containing numerical data. The contents of the `tip` column must be the same as the tip labels of the tree(s) in the `phylo` or `multiPhylo` object. The contents of the numerical columns will depend on whether a proportion or an average is desired. To calculate a proportion, fill a numerical column with 1 if the language possesses the property and 0 if it does not. To calculate an average, fill a numerical column with the values of the variable for each language.\n\nFor this example, the dataframe required is defined in the code below. In addition to the `tip` column, it contains two numerical columns, `is_SOV` and `n_consonants`. As good housekeeping, we recommend using column names of the form `is_X` or `has_X` for columns that contain data for proportions, and names of the form `n_X` for columns that contain counts to be averaged.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_ABCD <- data.frame(tip = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"), \n                        is_SOV = c(1, 1, 1, 0), \n                        n_consonants = c(18, 20, 22, 40),\n                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nGenealogically-sensitive averages and proportions are obtained using the `phyloWeights` function `phylo_average()`, specifying its arguments `phy` and `data` as in the example below. Here we have assigned the output of this function to a new object `results_ABCD`. We recommend always assigning the output of `phylo_average()` to an object. We will see below how to extract from it the various parts of the results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_ABCD <- phylo_average(phy = multiPhylo_ABCD, data = data_ABCD)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe function `phylo_average()` may take up to several minutes to run if the tree is large, or many trees are provided. It will return error messages if the inputs provided to it are not what is required.\n\nThe results object will contain several parts, which can be accessed using the `$` operator. In `$phy` will be the tree(s) that were supplied and in `$data` will be the dataframe that was supplied, e.g.:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_ABCD$data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  tip is_SOV n_consonants\n1   A      1           18\n2   B      1           20\n3   C      1           22\n4   D      0           40\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn `$ACL_averages` is a dataframe containing the genealogically-sensitive averages/proportions according to the ACL method. The dataframe has one row per tree and one column for each of the numerical columns in the `data` dataframe. Here you can see how the answer to our questions changes as the hypotheses about the tree changes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_ABCD$ACL_averages\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   tree    is_SOV n_consonants\n1 tree1 0.5172414     29.65517\n2 tree2 0.6000000     28.00000\n3 tree3 0.7142857     25.71429\n4 tree4 0.6768559     26.63755\n5 tree5 0.6768559     26.28821\n6 tree6 0.7115385     25.92308\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn `$BM_averages` appear the genealogically-sensitive averages or proportions obtained using the BM method:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_ABCD$BM_averages\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   tree    is_SOV n_consonants\n1 tree1 0.5568599     28.86280\n2 tree2 0.6952381     26.09524\n3 tree3 0.7468354     25.06329\n4 tree4 0.7256904     25.56443\n5 tree5 0.7256904     25.40796\n6 tree6 0.7288732     25.50704\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn terms of their inner workings, both methods work by assigning weights to languages, and those weights then reflect how much each language contributes to the final result. These weights can be found in `$ACL_weights` and `$BM_weights`. You might like to compare, for each tree, the weights for languages `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` with the positions of the languages in the tree, in order to get an idea of how the weights relate to the tree shape.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_ABCD$ACL_weights\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  tip     tree1 tree2     tree3     tree4     tree5     tree6\n1   A 0.1724138   0.2 0.2380952 0.1965066 0.2838428 0.2115385\n2   B 0.1724138   0.2 0.2380952 0.1965066 0.1965066 0.2115385\n3   C 0.1724138   0.2 0.2380952 0.2838428 0.1965066 0.2884615\n4   D 0.4827586   0.4 0.2857143 0.3231441 0.3231441 0.2884615\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults_ABCD$BM_weights\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  tip     tree1     tree2     tree3     tree4     tree5     tree6\n1   A 0.1856200 0.2317460 0.2489451 0.2288579 0.2679747 0.2288732\n2   B 0.1856200 0.2317460 0.2489451 0.2288579 0.2288579 0.2288732\n3   C 0.1856200 0.2317460 0.2489451 0.2679747 0.2288579 0.2711268\n4   D 0.4431401 0.3047619 0.2531646 0.2743096 0.2743096 0.2711268\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is possible to save any of these dataframes to a file using the `write.csv()` function, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite.csv(results_ABCD$ACL_averages, file = \"my_ACL_averages.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Using and adapting trees from glottolog.com {#glottolog}\n\nAs we have seen, using phylogenetic comparative methods, such as methods for calculating genealogically-sensitive averages, requires us to have one or more trees, expressing hypotheses about genealogical relationships among the languages. In this section we address the questions, where can linguists obtain their trees from?; and how can linguists adapt those trees to reflect their own hypotheses about language relatedness?\n\nOur starting point is glottolog.com [@glottolog], a major online publication which contains many useful resources for quantitative typology. The R package `glottoTrees` [@glottoTrees] has been written to help linguists make the most of these resources, including by modifying them as they desire. This section covers the glottolog data itself and the functionality of `glottoTrees`. We introduce glottolog's genealogical data in Section [Glottolog's genealogical data](#Glottolog's-genealogical-data), discussing how to locate metadata about languages and families of interest, and how to view glottolog's linguistic family trees. Since genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions require all of the languages in the study to be linked in a tree, we then discuss how glottolog's individual trees can be combined into larger, composite trees in Section \\@ref(combining-trees). Since typological studies will often examine language varieties at a level of granularity that differs from glottolog's own, in Section [How to modify trees](#How-to-modify-trees) we discuss how to add and remove languages from trees. In Section [How to add branch lengths](#How-to-add-branch-lengths) we discuss how to add branch lengths to trees, since branch lengths are necessary for the calculation of genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions. Section \\@ref(exporting) discusses how to export trees for use with other software.\n\n## Glottolog's genealogical data {#glottolog-genealogical}\n\nGlottolog provides metadata about the world's language varieties, their division into language families and the hierarchical subgrouping of languages inside those families. Naturally, there are many points of contention in linguistics about what the world's stock of languages and dialects actually is, how it groups into families, and how the families themselves are subgrouped. Glottolog provides one set of answers, and structures them in a way which provides typologists with a basis for carrying out changes to suit their own hypotheses. In later sections we will see how this can be done. In this section we describe glottolog's own global linguistic metadata.\n\nAt time of writing, the current version of glottolog is v4.4. The `glottoTrees` package contains a copy of the v4.4 metadata covering language names, language identification codes, family names, geographical groupings, and family trees. The original metadata files that contain this information are currently available at https://glottolog.org/meta/downloads, where a file named `tree_glottolog_newick.txt`[^321] contains glottolog's trees, and `languages_and_dialects_geo.csv` provides geographical metadata. \n\n[^321]: Although this file is named `tree_glottolog_newick.txt`, it is not in true Newick format due to its use of square brackets in node and tip labels [@Newick]. In `glottoTrees`, the square brackets in glottolog's file are converted to angled brackets (i.e., greater-than and less-than symbols), to bring them into conformity with the Newick standard.\n\nLanguage metadata can be accessed using the `glottoTrees` function `get_glottolog_languages()`. This function returns a dataframe of close to twenty-six thousand rows.

Together, the 420 trees contain 8,209 internal nodes and 17,008 tips, many of which represent varieties that would typically be considered dialects. Geographically, glottolog assigns each language variety to one of six _macroareas_: Africa, Australia, Eurasia, Papunesia, South America or North America. The `glottoTrees` metadata includes a column `main_macroarea`. This is the one macroarea which contains more of the family's language varieties than any other. We will see how this information can be useful in Section \\@ref(combining-trees).\n\nGlottolog's 420 family trees are stored in a `multiPhylo` object named `glottolog_trees_v4.4`. For example, here is glottolog's representation of the Great Andamanese family, which is tree 340 within the object `glottolog_trees_v4.4`. For readability, we plot this tree horizontally:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GA <- glottolog_trees_v4.4[[340]]\nplot(tree_GA, x.lim = c(-0.3, 14))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJust above, we obtained the tree for Great Andamanese by referring to its tree number (340) in the `glottolog_trees_v4.4` object. The package `glottoTrees` also provides a function `get_glottolog_trees()` which enables trees to be obtained using the glottolog name for their families, for instance:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GA <- get_glottolog_trees(\"GreatAndamanese\")\nplot(tree_GA, x.lim = c(-0.3, 14))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you know the name of one or more families and would like to now the number of their trees, use `which_tree()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich_tree(\"GreatAndamanese\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGreatAndamanese \n            340 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich_tree(c(\"Turkic\", \"Tupian\", \"Tuu\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTurkic Tupian    Tuu \n   217     32     76 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBoth `get_glottolog_trees()` and `which_tree()` allow the usage of a `glottolog_version` argument, to refer to older versions of glottolog. For instance, here are the tree numbers of the same families in version 4.1:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich_tree(\"GreatAndamanese\", glottolog_version = \"4.1\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGreatAndamanese \n              6 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich_tree(c(\"Turkic\", \"Tupian\", \"Tuu\"), glottolog_version = \"4.1\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTurkic Tupian    Tuu \n    66    297     80 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn glottolog's trees, the tip labels are rather long, consisting of a name followed by a glottocode in angled brackets, an ISO code in angled brackets (if one exists) and possibly the string \"-l-\". Node labels (not shown in the tree above) have the same structure. The `glottoTrees` function `abridge_labels()` will shorten labels to just the glottocode, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GA_abr <- abridge_labels(tree_GA)\nplot_glotto(tree_GA_abr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function `abridge_labels()` will issue a warning if there are tip or node labels in which it is unable to identify a glottocode. We will see an example of this shortly below.\n\nIn glottolog's trees, the branches are all of equal length. We will discuss how to assign more realistic branch lengths in Section [How to add branch lengths](#How-to-add-branch-lengths).\n\n## How to combine trees {#combining-trees}\n\nAs discussed @macklin-cordes_challenges_nodate, the comparison of languages across language families unavoidably carries a commitment to a genealogical hypothesis, even if that hypotheses is, tacitly, that all families are equally (un)related. Given that making such hypotheses is unavoidable, it will be most beneficial for progress in the field to make them explicit. To enable typologists to explore genealogical hypotheses and to make those hypotheses explicit, `glottoTrees` provides tools for combining multiple glottolog trees into one.\n\nTo begin with a small example, here we combine five glottolog families to represent the hypothesised Arnhem group in northern Australia [@green_proto_2003]. First we create a `multiPhylo` object containing the five glottolog language families (Gunwinyguan, Mangarrayi-Maran, Maningrida, and the isolates Kungarakany and Gaagudju):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narnhem_family_names <- \n  c(\"Gunwinyguan\", \"Mangarrayi-Maran\", \"Maningrida\", \"Kungarakany\", \"Gaagudju\")\nmultiPhylo_arnhem <- get_glottolog_trees(arnhem_family_names)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `glottoTrees` function `assemble_rake()` enables the trees in a `multiPhylo` object to be assembled into a single tree with a rake structure at its root. Here we apply `assemble_rake()` to our `multiPhylo` object and assign the resulting, single tree to the object `tree_arnhem`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_arnhem <- assemble_rake(multiPhylo_arnhem)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor plotting, it will be convenient to shorten the labels in the tree to just the glottocodes, using `abridge_labels()`. However, the root node in our newly created tree `tree_arnhem` has no label. Accordingly, the function `abridge_labels()` will issue a warning, that it encountered one node without a glottocode. This is not an error message, and `abridge_labels()` still shortens all labels to glottocodes where it can; it is just flagging the fact that it was not able to do so in all cases.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_arnhem_abr <- abridge_labels(tree_arnhem)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in abridge_labels(tree_arnhem): Labels without glottocodes were detected\nand left unchanged for: 0 tip(s); 1 node(s):\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPlotting the resulting tree enables us to inspect our newly created Arnhem tree. Note how all five families are joined to the root in a rake-like structure, without any additional subgrouping.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_glotto(tree_arnhem_abr, nodelabels = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is possible to give a combined tree more structure, by using `assemble_rake()` iteratively. For instance, suppose we wished to hypothesise that Gunwinyguan, Mangarrayi-Maran and Maningrida form their own subgroup. First, we create a `multiPhylo` object containing those three trees, and combine it into a single rake tree, which we call `tree_A`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiPhylo_A <- get_glottolog_trees(c(\"Gunwinyguan\", \"Mangarrayi-Maran\", \"Maningrida\"))\ntree_A <- assemble_rake(multiPhylo_A)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we create the final tree by combining `tree_A` with the two isolate family trees:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultiPhylo_arnhem2 <- c(tree_A, get_glottolog_trees(c(\"Kungarakany\", \"Gaagudju\")))\ntree_arnhem2 <- assemble_rake(multiPhylo_arnhem2)\ntree_arnhem2_abr <- abridge_labels(tree_arnhem2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in abridge_labels(tree_arnhem2): Labels without glottocodes were\ndetected and left unchanged for: 0 tip(s); 2 node(s): ,\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_glotto(tree_arnhem2_abr, nodelabels = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTypological studies often examine languages from very many families. To group all 420 families into a single 'supertree', `glottoTrees` provides the function `assemble_supertree()`. By default, the function returns a supertree that divides first into glottolog's six macroareas, with an internal node for each, and directly below these macroarea nodes appear all of the glottolog families, grouped by their `main_macroarea` mentioned in Section [Glottolog's genealogical data](#Glottolog's-genealogical-data) above. This tree is enormous, so we do not plot it here. It is obtained like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_supertree <- assemble_supertree()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe highest-level, macroarea groupings can also be controlled through the function's argument `macro_groups`. For instance, to group all of the world's families directly into a 420-pronged rake structure, set `macro_groups = NULL`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_supertree <- assemble_supertree(macro_groups = NULL)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt is also possible to group macroareas together, for example, to combine North and South America into a single group. Grouping of macroareas is achieved by setting the `macro_groups` argument to a _list_ whose items are the desired groups of macroareas. Each group will then appear as one of the highest-level nodes of the tree, and all of its families below it. For instance, to keep all of glottolog's macroareas separate, but to combine North and South America into a single group, the following code would be used. First we define a list, which we've called `my_list`, within which any groupings containing more than one macroarea are represented as a vector, using the `c()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_list <- list(\"Africa\", \"Australia\", \"Eurasia\", \"Papunesia\",\n                c(\"South America\", \"North America\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then use that list as the `macro_groups` argument of `assemble_supertree()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_supertree <- assemble_supertree(macro_groups = my_list)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTaking a second example, to create a supertree containing only the families whose `main_macroarea` is either Africa or Eurasia, and to place Africa and Eurasia under separate, highest-level nodes, we would use:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_list <- list(\"Africa\", \"Eurasia\")\nmy_supertree <- assemble_supertree(macro_groups = my_list)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## How to modify trees {#filter-tips}\n\nThere are several reasons why typologists may wish to use a tree that departs from the glottolog trees. Most commonly, a typological study will cover a set of languages that differs from the set of tips in any single glottolog tree, either through the exclusion of some of the lects that glottolog represents as tips or through the distinction of additional lects. A third case that can arise is when glottolog places one or more dialects at the tree's tips and more a general, language node above them. The typologist may have data that applies to the language (an internal node) rather than the dialects (the tips), yet the calculation of genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions requires one's typological variables to be related to the tips of trees, not to internal nodes. In these cases and many others, the typologist may wish to alter the glottolog tree to suit the purposes of the research. The `glottoTrees` package supplies a set of functions to aid in performing each of these tree manipulations. In this section we introduce them and illustrate their use.\n\nIn the following examples, we will make use glottolog's representation of the Great Andamanese family, whose labels we shorten to just the glottocodes using `abridge_labels()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GA <- get_glottolog_trees(\"GreatAndamanese\")\ntree_GA_abr <- abridge_labels(tree_GA)\nplot_glotto(tree_GA_abr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### How to remove tips\n\nFirstly, we illustrate the removal of tips from a tree. There are two functions in `glottoTrees` for doing this. The function `remove_tip()` works by specifying which tips are to be removed, while the function `keep_tip()` works by specifying which tips are to be retained. First we will remove three of the original ten tips in the Great Andamanese tree.  We do this by setting the `label` argument of `remove_tip()` to a vector containing the labels of the tips to be removed. Within the vector, the labels can appear in any order.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAa <- remove_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = c(\"akab1249\", \"akak1251\", \"apuc1241\"))\nplot_glotto(tree_GAa)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this next example, we remove the tips `akab1249` and `akar1243`. These tips are the only tips that sit below the internal node `sout2683`. This is significant, because it triggers a convention in tree manipulation, that if all tips below a node are removed, then the node is removed also. We see that here:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAb <- remove_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = c(\"akab1249\", \"akar1243\"))\nplot_glotto(tree_GAb)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe now illustrate the usage of the `glottoTrees` function `keep_tip()`. Here we use it to retain six of the original ten tips in the Great Andamanese. We do this by setting the `label` argument to a vector containing the labels of the six desired tips.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAc <- keep_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = c(\"akar1243\", \"akak1251\", \"akac1240\",\n                                            \"akak1252\", \"apuc1241\", \"okoj1239\"))\nplot_glotto(tree_GAc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs before, if our use of `keep_tip()` results in a node having all of the tips below it removed, then the node will also be removed automatically. This is illustrated here, where the node `boca1235` is removed automatically because neither of the tips below it are kept:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAd <- keep_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = c(\"akar1243\", \"akak1251\", \"akak1252\",\n                                            \"apuc1241\", \"okoj1239\"))\nplot_glotto(tree_GAd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### How to remove tips and convert nodes to tips\n\nAs mentioned earlier, many of the tips in glottolog's trees correspond to dialects, with languages represented as nodes above the dialectal tips. One usage case we foresee is that a typologist will wish to study a set of language varieties, some of which correspond to glottolog's tips and some of which correspond to nodes. The `glottoTrees` function `keep_as_tips()` takes an argument `label` which can contain both tip labels and node labels. Any tips will be kept, and any nodes will be converted into tips, with all of the structure below them being removed. Be mindful when using `keep_as_tips()` that it is not possible to both convert a node into a tip and also retain the structure below it, such as tips that it dominates. Here we keep the same tips as in the tree above, while also converting the node `boca1235` into a tip:[^92]\n\n[^92]: Converting nodes into tips may cause them to move to the left or right in the tree plot.

This reflects that fact that `remove_tip()`, `keep_tip()` and `keep_as_tip()` all preserve the original _depth_ of any tips that remain in the tree (you may like to confirm this by reviewing the plots above). Depending on the researcher's needs, this outcome may or may not be desirable. If it is undesirable, then non-branching, internal nodes can be removed using the `glottoTrees` function `collapse_node()`. For instance, here we remove two of the non-branching nodes from the tree `tree_GAc` above, by naming them in the `label` argument of `collapse_node()`. In the resulting tree, these nodes have been removed, thus reducing the depth of the tips below them:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAg <- collapse_node(tree_GAc, label = c(\"boca1235\", \"okol1242\"))\nplot_glotto(tree_GAg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png){fig-align='center' width=55%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen deciding whether to collapse nodes, in can be handy to know which nodes in a tree that have only one child below them. The function `nonbranching_nodes()` will return a vector of all such nodes, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnonbranching_nodes(tree_GAc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"okol1242\" \"boca1235\" \"jeru1239\" \"sout2683\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnonbranching_nodes(tree_GAg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"jeru1239\" \"sout2683\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function `collapse_node()` can also be used to alter a subgrouping hypothesis, and specifically, to remove a layer of subgrouping, converting a nested structure ((A,B),C) into a flat structure (A,B,C). For instance, here we remove the `okol1242` node of the original glottolog Great Andamanese tree, converting its two daughter languages into sisters of `okoj1239`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAh <- collapse_node(tree_GA_abr, label= \"okol1242\")\nplot_glotto(tree_GAh)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### How to add tips\n\nThe function `add_tip()` allows tips to be added to a tree. The `label` argument specifies the name of the new tip, while `parent_label` specifies the label of the node below which the new tip should appear. Here we add a tip `xxxx1234` below the node `sout2683`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAi <- add_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = \"xxxx1234\", parent_label = \"sout2683\")\nplot_glotto(tree_GAi)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png){fig-align='center' width=55%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### How to clone tips\n\nNext we illustrate the cloning of tips. Cloning tips may be useful when glottolog provides only one glottocode, and thus only one tree tip, corresponding to multiple lects in the typologist's study. To clone a tip, use the function `clone_tip()` and in the `label` argument, provide a vector of the tips to be cloned. Here we clone tips `akar1243` and `akak1252`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAj <- clone_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = c(\"akar1243\", \"akak1252\"))\nplot_glotto(tree_GAj)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy default, clones are added to the tree as sisters directly beneath the parent node of the original tip. An alternative is to create a new subgroup for each set of sister clones, using the `subgroup` argument and setting it to `subgroup = TRUE`. Each newly created subgroup node is given a label that matches the cloned tips it dominates:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAk <- clone_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = c(\"akar1243\", \"akak1252\"), subgroup = TRUE)\nplot_glotto(tree_GAk)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is also possible to make more than one clone using the `n` argument. Here we create three new clones of `akab1248` and place them in a subgroup:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAl <- clone_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = \"akab1248\", n = 3, subgroup = TRUE)\nplot_glotto(tree_GAl)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne of the consequences of cloning tips is that the in the resulting tree, not all tips will have distinct names. The function `apply_duplicate_suffixes()` will add a suffix to any tips with duplicate labels, to make them unique.[^777] The suffix will consist of a hyphen followed by a number. Here we add suffixes to the tree `tree_GAj`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAm <- apply_duplicate_suffixes(tree_GAj)\nplot_glotto(tree_GAm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[^777]: `apply_duplicate_suffixes()` will also add suffixes to any nodes with duplicate labels.\n\n### How to move a tip\n\nUsing the function `move_tip()`, a tip can be moved to a new position, beneath a new parent node (one of the nodes already in the tree) which is specified with the `parent_label` argument:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAn <- move_tip(tree_GA_abr, label = \"apuc1241\", parent_label = \"jeru1239\")\nplot_glotto(tree_GAn)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### How to move a node and its descendants\n\nIn a similar fashion, the function `move_node()` is used to move an internal node, along with all of the structure below it, to a position beneath a new parent node:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAo <- move_node(tree_GA_abr, label = \"jeru1239\", parent_label = \"okol1242\")\nplot_glotto(tree_GAo)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Summary: a general-purpose toolkit for curating trees' topology\n\nThe functions `remove_tip()`, `keep_tip()`, `keep_as_tip()`, `convert_to_tip()`, `collapse_node()`, `add_tip()`, `clone_tip()`, `move_tip()` and `move_node()` provide a general-purpose toolkit for modifying a single glottolog tree, or a combined tree, or supertree, to make its set of tips, and the subgrouping of those tips, conform to the set of lects that a typologist is analysing in a typological study.\n\n\n## How to add branch lengths {#add-lengths}\n\nBranch lengths in a tree convey information, and most phylogenetic comparative methods, including genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions, are sensitive to the information represented by the branch lengths. (To be specific, genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions are sensitive to the _relative_ lengths of the branches, so multiplying all of the branch lengths in a tree by some constant amount would not affect the results.)\n\nGlottolog's trees contain informative subgrouping structure, but the branch lengths are all equal. Even without knowing what the true branch lengths are for a linguistic tree, we do know that a situation in which all are equal is highly unlikely. A good approximation to the most-likely[^55] distribution of branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree, under a variety of assumptions, is exponential [@venditti2010phylogenies], i.e., very long branches are rare, and very short ones are frequent. This notion is implemented in the `glottoTrees` package by the function `rescale_branches_exp()`, which sets the deepest branches to length 1/2, then next layer to length 1/4, then the next to 1/8 and so on. This will produce a more plausible set of branch lengths, even in the absence of firm knowledge of exact lengths, and on these grounds we advocate its use if additional information about branch lengths is not available.\n\n[^55]: 'Most likely' doesn't mean that we expect to see trees with exactly these branch lengths. Compare this to flipping a coin two million times: although it is unlikely that the outcome will be exactly one million heads and one million tails, it remains true that one million heads and one million tails is the most likely outcome, in the strict sense that it is more likely than any other outcome. The branch lengths discussed here are 'most likely' is a similar sense.\n\nHere is an example of the result of applying exponential branch lengths to glottolog's Great Andamanese tree:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_GAp <- rescale_branches_exp(tree_GA_abr)\nplot_glotto(tree_GAp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere is an example of the result of applying them to glottolog's Eskimo-Aleut tree, of 30 tips:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_EA <- get_glottolog_trees(\"Eskimo-Aleut\")\ntree_EA_abr <- abridge_labels(tree_EA)\ntree_EAa <- rescale_branches_exp(tree_EA_abr)\nplot_glotto(tree_EAa, nodelabels = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAn additional option is to stretch the terminal branches so that all tips are equidistant from the root, creating what is known as an _ultrametric_ tree. This is done using the function `ultrametricize()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_EAb <- ultrametricize(tree_EAa)\nplot_glotto(tree_EAb, nodelabels = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-57-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAn additional function, `rescale_deepest_branches()`, can be used to adjust just the deepest layer of branches. This may be useful where multiple family trees have been joined together, and there is a desire to manipulate the implied closeness or distance between the first-order branches. For example, here we take the hypothesised Arnhem group from Section \\@ref(combining-trees). First we assign exponential branch lengths with `set_branch_lengths_exp()`, which sets the deepest branch length to 1/2. Then we triple the distance of the deepest level of relationships by changing the first branch length to 1.5 using `rescale_deepest_branches()`, before ultrametricising the tree:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_arnhem_a <- rescale_branches_exp(tree_arnhem_abr)\ntree_arnhem_b <- rescale_deepest_branches(tree_arnhem_a, 1.5)\ntree_arnhem_c <- ultrametricize(tree_arnhem_b)\nplot_glotto(tree_arnhem_c, nodelabels = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-58-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exporting trees for use with other software {#exporting}\n\nIn R, trees can be saved to file in Newick format using the function `write.tree()` in the `ape` package. Files like this can be opened by other software such as FigTree[^94], which can be used to interactively generate tree plots that may be useful for publication and dissemination. For instance, here we write the tree `tree_arnhem_c` to a file whose filename ends in the standard file extension, `.tree`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite.tree(tree_arnhem_c, \"my_arnhem_tree.tree\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOften it will be desirable to reproduce a tree with labels that are more reader-friendly than glottocodes. `glottoTrees` provides the function `relabel_with_names()`, which will replace full glottolog labels, or labels consisting of just a glottocode, with glottolog's corresponding language, dialect, subgroup or family name. Here we relabel the Arnhem tree by the languages' names. As was the case with `abridge_labels()`, warnings are given by `relabel_with_names()` if a tree contains any nodes that cannot be relabeled in this way; these are not errors, just alerts.\n\n[^94]: https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_arnhem_c_namelabels <- relabel_with_names(tree_arnhem_c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in relabel_with_names(tree_arnhem_c): Labels without glottocodes were\ndetected and left unchanged for: 0 tip(s); 1 node(s):\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_glotto(tree_arnhem_c_namelabels, nodelabels = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Putting it together: A worked example {#example}\n\nIn this section we provide a real worked example of the use of the methods described above.\n\n@yin_violations_2020 examined violations of the sonority sequencing principle in 496 languages, and calculated the genealogically-sensitive proportions of languages in which various violations occurred.

And since the genealogies of human languages are still incompletely known, it is imperative to make our phylogenetic hypotheses and assumptions as explicit and as testable as possible. In this document, we hope have shown that doing so is entirely feasible.\n\nThrough the use of `glottoTrees` and `phyloWeights`, we hope that in the future, linguistic trees and the code used to produce them can be published together with typological studies. This will enable subsequent researchers to replicate the study's findings, and just as importantly, to modify its assumptions by modifying the trees, and thereby to test further hypotheses inspired by the initial research.\n\nIf you find these practical tools useful in your own research, please cite the packages as @glottoTrees and @phyloWeights. If you wish to cite the notion of genealogically-sensitive averages and proportions, please cite either @macklin-cordes_challenges_nodate and/or the more specific references therein.\n\nIf you think you've encountered a bug or anomalous behaviour in `glottoTrees` and `phyloWeights`, please be in contact, either through the package github pages or by email: e.round@uq.edu.au. It's important for the good of the science that linguists can use these methods without undue impediments.\n\n\n# Citation & Session Info {-}\n\nRound, Erich. 2022. *Practical phylogenetic comparative methods for linguistic typology*.
