This page contains links, information, and details about upcoming and past workshops offered by LADAL or its collaborators and partners. Also, LADAL members present their research or information relevant to LADAL at conferences. Below are links to upcoming events (conferences/workshops/presentations) and presentations containing information about LADAL or research based on LADAL. \n\n# Upcoming Workshops{-}\n\nBelow you will find the details of the workshops offered by LADAL or [Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)](https://www.atap.edu.au) or its collaborators and partners.\n\n\n\n\n# Previous workshops{-}\n\n## 17 June 2022 - AcqVA Aurora workshop: From Tables to Forests{-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://slcladal.github.io/images/acqvalab.png){width=30% style=\"float:right; padding:10px\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis workshop consists of two parts. The first part of the workshop focuses on loading and working with tabular data R. In this part of the workshop, we will learn how to load, inspect, process, and summarize tabulated data. The second part of the workshop focuses tree-based models in R, such as conditional inference trees, random forests, and Boruta, which have become more prominent in the language science over the past decade. This part will discuss the underlying logic of tree-based models, how they can be implemented in R, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.\n \nThe materials for this workshop can be accessed via [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/acqvatabletree) and the rendered script is available [here](https://martinschweinberger.github.io/acqvatabletree/).\n\n\n## Network analysis and Topic Modeling on Twitter data using R{-}\n\n[This online workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/network-analysis-and-topic-modeling-on-twitter-data-using-r-registration-327690108937?keep_tld=1) is offered free to Australian researchers and research students and will cover:\n\n* Introduction to network theory.  \n* Fundamental principles of using R for network analysis.  \n* Topic modeling of tweet text using R. \n\nThe data used for the workshop will be an open source dataset of Twitter data relating to the 2019 Federal Election.\n\nDate: May 18 2022 Time: 9:00AM - 12:00PM AEST Venue: Online\n\nRegistration is required and the workshop is brought to you by the teams at the [*Australian Digital Observatory* (ADO)](https://www.digitalobservatory.net.au/) and the [Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)](https://www.atap.edu.au) via the [*Australian Research Data Commons* (ARDC)](https://ardc.edu.au/).\n\n## Monotreme Mania!{-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://slcladal.github.io/images/ATAPlogo.png){width=30% style=\"float:right; padding:10px\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comparative text analytics on Twitter data**\n\nThis online workshop is offered free to Australian researchers and research students and will cover:\n\n* Collecting and transforming Twitter data using twarc.  \n* Analysing the collected Twitter data using the R ecosystem for text analytics.\n\nRegister via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/monotreme-mania-comparative-text-analytics-on-twitter-data-registration-275328062647)\n\nUpdate - 09/03/2022 The workshop is now fully booked.
