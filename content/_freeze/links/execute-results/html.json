The larger and more accurate big model is fit for GPUs and multi-core computers; the faster small model is more appropriate for personal computers.\n\n## Digital Humanities Awards{-}\n\nThe [Digital Humanities Awards](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2021/voting/) page contains a list of great DH resources for the following categories:\n\n* Best Exploration Of DH Failure/Limitations  \n* Best DH Data Visualization  \n* Best Use Of DH For Fun  \n* Best DH Dataset  \n* Best DH Short Publication  \n* Best DH Tool Or Suite Of Tools  \n* Best DH Training Materials  \n* Special Category: Best DH Response To COVID-19\n\n## Text Analysis in Python for Social Scientists{-}\n\nThe book [Text Analysis in Python for Social Scientists. Prediction and Classification](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/text-analysis-in-python-for-social-scientists/54B82AEA3FB586919A2265E6799ACB11#element)  contains a wealth of information about about a wide variety of sociocultural constructs. Automated prediction methods can infer these quantities (sentiment analysis is probably the most well-known application). However, there is virtually no limit to the kinds of things we can predict from text: power, trust, misogyny, are all signaled in language. These algorithms easily scale to corpus sizes infeasible for manual analysis. Prediction algorithms have become steadily more powerful, especially with the advent of neural network methods. However, applying these techniques usually requires profound programming knowledge and machine learning expertise. As a result, many social scientists do not apply them. This Element provides the working social scientist with an overview of the most common methods for text classification, an intuition of their applicability, and Python code to execute them. It covers both the ethical foundations of such work as well as the emerging potential of neural network methods.\n\n## Data Measurements Tool{-}\n\n[This blog entry introduces the Data Measurements Tool](https://huggingface.co/blog/data-measurements-tool). The Data Measurements Tool is a Interactive Tool for Looking at Datasets. The Data Measurements Tool is a open-source Python library and no-code interface called the Data Measurements Tool, using our Dataset and Spaces Hubs paired with the great Streamlit tool. This can be used to help understand, build, curate, and compare datasets.\n\n\n\n***\n\n[Back to top](#announcements)\n\n[Back to HOME](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)\n\n*** ",
