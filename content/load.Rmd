# Introduction{-}

The data we work with comes in many formats and types. Therefore, this tutorial shows how you can load and save different types of data when working with R.

```{r diff, echo=FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/g_chili.jpg")
```

This tutorial is aimed at beginners  with the aim of showcasing how to load and save different type of data and data structures in R. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged analysis but rather to show and exemplify how to load and save the most common types of data in R.

## Preparation and session set up{-}

This tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the packages so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install packages
install.packages("xlsx")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("flextable")
install.packages("openxlsx")
install.packages("here")
# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks
remotes::install_github("rlesur/klippy")
```

Now that we have installed the packages, we can activate them as shown below.

```{r prep2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
# load packages
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(flextable)
library(xlsx)
library(openxlsx)
library(here)
# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button
klippy::klippy()
```

Once you have installed RStudio and initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

<b>NOTE</b><br><br>
As most of the time we load data from our own computers, this tutorial also assumes that you load from your own computer.  
<br>
Specifically, we assume that you have a subfolder called `data` in which you have stored your data in the directory where you have your R project (the Rproj file). We assume that the data sets we load are located in that data subfolder. We also show you how you can load multiple text files into R (which is common if you work with corpora, e.g.). The multiple texts are located in a folder called `textcorpus` within the data subfolder.  
<br>
If you have a separate set-up, you have to adapt the path to the data for the tutorial to work on your own computer. (Also note that the `here` functions is used to create paths that start in the directory where the Rproj is located.</p>

# Tabulated data {-}

There are several different functions that allow us to read comma separated (csv) and other Excel files into R. 

## CSV {-} 

A common data type when working with tabulated data are comma separated files (csv). To load such files, we can use the `read.csv` function as shown below.

```{r lcsv1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
datcsv <-read.csv(here::here("data", "testdat.csv"), header=TRUE)
# inspect
head(datcsv)
```

The data is not spectacular and consist of a table with 2 columns (`Variable1`, and `Variable2`).

Sometimes, csv files are actually not comma-separated but use a semi-colon as a separator. In such cases, we can use the `read.delim` function to load the csv and specify that the separator (`sep`) is ";".

```{r lcsv2}
# load csv with ;
datcsv2 <- read.delim(here::here("data", "testdat2.csv"), 
                   sep = ";", header = TRUE)
# inspect data
head(datcsv2)
```

To save a data set as a csv on your computer (here it is saved within the `data` folder within the folder where the Rproj is located).

```{r scsv1, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
write.csv(datcsv, here::here("data", "testdat.csv"), row.names = F)
```


## XLSX {-}

To load excel data, you can use the `read.xlsx` function from the `openxlsx` package. We have activated the `openxlsx` package in the session preparation so we do not need to activate it again here. If you get an error message telling you that R did not find the `read.xlsx` function, you need to activate the `openxlsx` package by running the `library(openxlsx)`.

```{r lxlsx, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
datxlsx <- openxlsx::read.xlsx(here::here("data", "testdat.xlsx"), sheet = 1)
# inspect
head(datxlsx)
```

To save xlsx files, we can use the `write.xlsx` from the `openxlsx` package as shown below.

```{r sxlsx, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
write.xlsx(datxlsx, here::here("data", "testdat.xlsx"))
```

## TXT (tabulated) {-}

If  the data is tabular and stored as a txt-file, there are various functions to read in the data. The most common functions are `read.delim` and `read.table`. The read.delim function is very flexible and allows you to specify the separator and inform R that the first row contains column headers rather than data points (if the data does not contain column headers, then you do not need to specify `header = T` because `header = F` is the default).

```{r ltxt1, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load tab txt 1
dattxt <- read.delim(here::here("data", "testdat.txt"), 
                   sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
# inspect data
head(dattxt)
```

The `read.table` function is very similar and can also be used to load various types of tabulated data. Again, we let R know that the first row contains column headers rather than data points.

```{r ltxt2, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load tab txt
dattxt2 <- read.table(here::here("data", "testdat.txt"), header = TRUE)
# inspect 
head(dattxt2)
```


To save tabulated txt files, we use the `write.table` function. In the  `write.table` function we define the separator (in this case we write a tab-separated file) and inform R to not add row names (i.e, that R should not number rows and store this information in a separate column).

```{r ltxt, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# save txt
write.table(dattxt, here::here("data", "testdat.txt"), sep = "\t", row.names = F)
```


# Unstructured data {-}

## TXT {-}

Unstructured data (most commonly data representing raw text) is also very common - particularly when working with corpus data.

To load text data into R (here in the form of a txt file), we can use the `scan` function. Reading in texts using the `scan` function will result in loading vectors of stings where each string represents a separate word.

```{r ltext1, message=F, warning=F}
testtxt <- scan(here::here("data", "english.txt"), what = "char")
# inspect
testtxt
```

In contract, the `readLines` function will read in complete lines  and result in a vector of strings representing lines (if the entire text is in 1 line, the the entire text will be loaded as a single string).

```{r ltext2, message=F, warning=F}
testtxt2 <- readLines(here::here("data", "english.txt"))
# inspect
testtxt2
```

To save text data, we can use the `writeLines` function as shown below.

```{r stext1, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
writeLines(text2, here::here("data", "english.txt"))
```

## Multiple TXTs {-}

When working with text data, it is ver common that we have to load multiple (or many) files containing texts. In this case, we first store the locations of the files in an object (here called `fls`) and then load the files in these locations using `sapply` (a looping function). In the `sapply` function, we can use either `scan` or `writeLines` to read in the text. Below we use `scan` and then combine the individual elements into a text using the `paste` function. The output shows that we have successfully loaded 7 txt files from the testcorpus that is in the data folder.

```{r lmulttexts, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract file paths
fls <- list.files(here::here("data", "testcorpus"), pattern = "txt", full.names = T)
# load files
txts <- sapply(fls, function(x){
  x <- scan(x, what = "char") %>%
    paste0( collapse = " ")
  })
# inspect
str(txts)
```

To save multiple txt files, we follow a similar procedure and first determine the paths that define where R will store the files and then loop over the files and store them in the testcorpus folder.

```{r smulttexts, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# define where to save each file
outs <- file.path(paste(here::here(), "/", "data/testcorpus", "/", "text", 1:7, ".txt", sep = ""))
# save the files
lapply(seq_along(txts), function(i) 
       writeLines(txts[[i]],  
       con = outs[i]))
```


# R data objects {-}

When working withR in RStudio, it makes sense to save data as R data objects as this requires minimal storage space and allows to load and save data very quickly. R data objects can have any format (structured, unstructured, lists, etc.). Here, we use the `readRDS` function to load R data objects (which can represent any form or type of data). 

```{r rda, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
rdadat <- readRDS(here::here("data", "testdat.rda"))
# inspect
head(rdadat)
```

To save R data objects, we use the `saveRDS` function as shown below.

```{r srda1, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
saveRDS(rdadat, file = here::here("data", "testdat.rda"))
```


# Web data {-}

You can load all types of data discussed above from the web. the only thing you need to do is to change the path. Instead of defining a path on your own computer, simply replace it with a url with thin the `url` function nd the additional argument `"rb"`.

So loading the `testdat.rda` from the LADAL github data repo woudl require the following path specification:

`url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/testdat.rda", "rb")`

compared to the data repo in the current Rproj:

`here::here("data", "testdat.rda")`


See below how you can load, e.g., an rda object from the LADAL data repo on GitHub.

```{r lweb, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
webdat <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/testdat.rda", "rb"))
# inspect
head(webdat)
```


We can then store this data as shown in the sections above.
