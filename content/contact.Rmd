# Get in Touch!{-}

To subscribe to our email list,  simply write an email to **ladal@uq.edu.au** with the subject **email list**.

# Becoming a contributor{-}

You have an idea for a tutorial and would like us to integrate it into LADAL? No worries! You can simply download this [skeleton Rmd](https://slcladal.github.io/base.Rmd) and write your own LADAL tutorial. You can then send us the Rmd file (with any additional files we need to knit the document) and we will then check it. Once your tutorial has been approved, it will be published as a proper LADAL tutorial. 

# Reporting and fixing errors{-}


You have found a mistake or an error in one of our tutorials? No worries! You can report the error or even fix it yourself without much hustle!  Depending on how tech savvy you are and how much time or willingness to contribute you have, there are different options for point out out errors or even correcting them. Below you find descriptions of how you can report and fix bugs on the LADAL pages.



```{r email2, echo=FALSE, out.width= "30%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:15px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/happycomputer.png")
```

## Reporting errors via Email{-}

If you simply want to report an error, you can contact the LADAL team via **ladal\@uq.edu.au** or you can contact Martin via **m.schweinberger\@uq.edu.au**. 

It may take some time until we manage to check and fix the bug, but we try to be as swift as possible and we will get to it eventually. 

## Fixing bugs directly on GitHub{-}

An even better option than reporting an error is to fix the bug via GitHub. That way, we receive an email that someone found an error and has submitted a fix which we can then review and accept (or decline). Below is a detailed description of how exactly you can do that.

To be able to correct errors via GitHub, you need a GitHub account (you can register and sign in [here](https://github.com/)). We will create a tutorial in which we show you how to do this - in the mean time, we have to rely on your skills to try and find out how to do this yourself.
