This tutorial is aimed at beginners and intermediate users of R with the aim of showcasing how to perform basic topic modeling on textual data using R and how to visualize the results of such a model. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged analysis but rather to show and exemplify selected useful methods associated with topic modeling.

This tutorial builds heavily on and uses materials from [@silge2017text, chapter 6] (see [here](https://www.tidytextmining.com/topicmodeling)) and  [this tutorial](https://tm4ss.github.io/docs/Tutorial_6_Topic_Models.html) on topic modelling using R by Andreas Niekler and Gregor Wiedemann [see @WN17]. [The tutorial](https://tm4ss.github.io/docs/index.html) by Andreas Niekler and Gregor Wiedemann is more thorough, goes into more detail than this tutorial, and covers many more very useful text mining methods.

Topic models refers to a suit of methods employed to uncover latent structures within a corpus of text. These models operate on the premise of identifying abstract *topics* that recur across documents. In essence, topic models sift through the textual data to discern recurring patterns of word co-occurrence, revealing underlying semantic themes [@busso2022operation; ]. This technique is particularly prevalent in text mining, where it serves to unveil hidden semantic structures in large volumes of textual data.

Conceptually, topics can be understood as clusters of co-occurring terms, indicative of shared semantic domains within the text. The underlying assumption is that if a document pertains to a specific topic, words related to that topic will exhibit higher frequency compared to documents addressing other subjects. For example, in documents discussing dogs, terms like *dog* and *bone* are likely to feature prominently, while in documents focusing on cats, *cat* and *meow* would be more prevalent. Meanwhile, ubiquitous terms such as *the* and *is* are expected to occur with similar frequency across diverse topics, serving as noise rather than indicative signals of topic specificity.

Various methods exist for determining topics within topic models. For instance, @gerlach2018network and @hyland2021multilayer advocate for an approach grounded in stochastic block models. However, most applications of topic models use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [@blei2003latent] or Structural Topic Modeling  [@roberts2016navigating].

LDA, in particular, emerges as a widely embraced technique for fitting topic models. It operates by treating each document as a blend of topics and each topic as a blend of words. Consequently, documents can exhibit content overlaps, akin to the fluidity observed in natural language usage, rather than being strictly segregated into distinct groups.

@gillings2022interpretation state that topic modelling is based on the following key assumptions:

* The corpus comprises a substantial number of documents.  
* A topic is delineated as a set of words with varying probabilities of occurrence across the documents.  
* Each document exhibits diverse degrees of association with multiple topics.  
* The collection is structured by underlying topics, which are finite in number, organizing the corpus.  

Given the availability of vast amounts of textual data, topic models can help to organize and offer insights and assist in understanding large collections of unstructured text and they are widely used in natural language processing and computational text analytics. However, the use of topic modelling in discourse studies has received criticism [@brookes2019utility] due to the following issues: 

1. **Thematic Coherence**: While topic modeling can group texts into *topics*, the degree of thematic coherence varies. Some topics may be thematically coherent, but others may lack cohesion or accuracy in capturing the underlying themes present in the texts.

2. **Nuanced Perspective**: Compared to more traditional approaches to discourse analysis, topic modeling often provides a less nuanced perspective on the data. The automatically generated topics may overlook subtle nuances and intricacies present in the texts, leading to a less accurate representation of the discourse.

3. **Distance from Reality**: @brookes2019utility suggest that the insights derived from topic modeling may not fully capture the "reality" of the texts. The topics generated by the model may not accurately reflect the complex nature of the discourse, leading to potential misinterpretations or oversimplifications of the data.

4. **Utility for Discourse Analysts**: While topic modeling may offer a method for organizing and studying sizable data sets, @brookes2019utility questions the utility for discourse analysts and suggests that traditional discourse analysis methods consistently provide a more nuanced and accurate perspective on the data compared to topic modeling approaches.

This criticism is certainly valid if topic modeling is solely reliant on a purely data-driven approach without human intervention. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to combine data-driven topic modeling with human-supervised seeded methods to arrive at more reliable and accurate topics.

**Preparation and session set up**

This tutorial is conducted within the R environment. If you're new to R or haven't installed it yet, you can find an introduction to R and further instructions on how to use it [here](https://ladal.edu.au/intror.html). To ensure smooth execution of the scripts provided in this tutorial, it's necessary to install specific packages from the R library. Before proceeding to the code examples, please ensure you've installed these packages by running the code provided below. If you've already installed the required packages, feel free to skip ahead and disregard this section. To install the necessary packages, simply execute the following code.

# Topic Modelling{-}

In this tutorial, we'll explore a two-step approach to topic modeling. Initially, we'll employ an unsupervised method to generate a preliminary topic model, uncovering inherent topics within the data. Subsequently, we'll introduce a human-supervised, seeded model, informed by the outcomes of the initial data-driven approach. Following this (recommended) procedure, we'll then delve into an alternative purely data-driven approach.

Our tutorial begins by gathering the necessary corpus data. We'll be focusing on analyzing the *State of the Union Addresses* (SOTU) delivered by US presidents, with the aim of understanding how the addressed topics have evolved over time. Given the length of these addresses (amounting to 231 in total), it's important to acknowledge that document length can influence topic modeling outcomes. In cases where texts are exceptionally short (like Twitter posts) or long (such as books), adjusting the document units for modeling purposes can be beneficial—either by combining or splitting them accordingly.

To tailor our approach to the SOTU speeches, we've chosen to model at the paragraph level instead of analyzing entire speeches at once. This allows for a more detailed analysis, potentially leading to clearer and more interpretable topics. We've provided a data set named `sotu_paragraphs.rda`, which contains the speeches segmented into paragraphs for easier analysis.

In terms of preprocessing the data (cleaning it and making it ready for analysis), we convert the text to lower case, remove stopwords words (like *the* and *and* as they often add noise to the topic modeling process, making it harder to identify meaningful topics), we remove punctuation and numbers, and we stem the text data.

```{r tm2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
textdata <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/sotu_paragraphs.rda", "rb"))
# create corpus object
tm::Corpus(DataframeSource(textdata)) %>%
  # convert to lower case
  tm::tm_map(content_transformer(tolower))  %>%
  # remove superfluous white spaces
  tm::tm_map(stripWhitespace)  %>%
  # remove stop words
  tm::tm_map(removeWords, quanteda::stopwords()) %>% 
  # remove punctuation
  tm::tm_map(removePunctuation, preserve_intra_word_dashes = TRUE) %>%
  # remove numbers
  tm::tm_map(removeNumbers) %>% 
  # stemming
  tm::tm_map(stemDocument, language = "en") -> textcorpus
# inspect data
str(textcorpus)
```

```{r}
# load data
txts <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/sotu_paragraphs.rda", "rb")) 
txts$text %>%
  # tokenise
  quanteda::tokens(remove_punct = TRUE,       # remove punctuation 
                   remove_symbols = TRUE,     # remove symbols 
                   remove_number = TRUE) %>%  # remove numbers
  # remove stop words
  quanteda::tokens_select(pattern = stopwords("en"), selection = "remove") %>%
  # stemming
  quanteda::tokens_wordstem() %>%
  # convert to document-frequency matrix
  dfm(tolower = T) -> ctxts
# add docvars
docvars(ctxts, "president") <- txts$president
docvars(ctxts, "date") <- txts$date
docvars(ctxts, "speechid") <- txts$speech_doc_id
docvars(ctxts, "docid") <- txts$doc_id
# clean data
ctxts <- dfm_subset(ctxts, ntoken(ctxts) > 0)
# inspect data
ctxts[1:5, 1:5]
```

## Human-in-the-loop Topic Modelling {-}

Now that we have loaded and prepared the data for analysis, we follow the two-step approach where we, first, we perform an unsupervised LDA to check what topics are present in our data. Then, we perform a supervised LDA (based on the results of the unsupervised LDA) to identify meaningful topics in our data. For the supervised LDA, we define so-called *seed terms* that help in generating coherent topics.

In the initial data-driven step, we vary the number of topic the LDA algorithms looks for until we identify coherent topics in the data.

```{r}
# generate model: change k to different numbers, e.g. 10 or 20 and look for consistencies in the keywords for the topics below.
topicmodels::LDA(ctxts, k = 15, control = list(seed = 1234)) -> ddlda
```

```{r}
# extract topics
ddlda_topics <- tidy(ddlda, matrix = "beta")
# inspect
head(ddlda_topics, 45)
```



```{r}
ddlda_top_terms <- ddlda_topics %>%
  dplyr::group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_max(beta, n = 10) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::arrange(topic, -beta)
# inspect
ddlda_top_terms
```



## Data-driven Topic Modelling {-}

### Model calculation{-}

After the preprocessing, we have two corpus objects: `processedCorpus`, on which we calculate an LDA topic model [@blei2003lda]. To this end, *stopwords*, i.e. function words that have relational rather than content meaning,  were removed, words were stemmed and converted to lowercase letters and special characters were removed. The second corpus object `corpus` serves to be able to view the original texts and thus to facilitate a qualitative control of the topic model results.

We now calculate a topic model on the `processedCorpus`. For this purpose, a DTM of the corpus is created. In this case, we only want to consider terms that occur with a certain minimum frequency in the body. This is primarily used to speed up the model calculation.

```{r tm3a}
# compute document term matrix with terms >= minimumFrequency
minimumFrequency <- 5
DTM <- DocumentTermMatrix(processedCorpus, control = list(bounds = list(global = c(minimumFrequency, Inf))))
# have a look at the number of documents and terms in the matrix
dim(DTM)
# due to vocabulary pruning, we have empty rows in our DTM
# LDA does not like this. So we remove those docs from the
# DTM and the metadata
sel_idx <- slam::row_sums(DTM) > 0
DTM <- DTM[sel_idx, ]
textdata <- textdata[sel_idx, ]
``` 

As an unsupervised machine learning method, topic models are suitable for the exploration of data. The calculation of topic models aims to determine the proportionate composition of a fixed number of topics in the documents of a collection. It is useful to experiment with different parameters in order to find the most suitable parameters for your own analysis needs.

For parameterized models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the number of topics `K` is the most important parameter to define in advance. How an optimal `K` should be selected depends on various factors. If `K` is too small, the collection is divided into a few very general semantic contexts. If `K` is too large, the collection is divided into too many topics of which some may overlap and others are hardly interpretable.

An alternative to deciding on a set number of topics is to extract parameters form a models using a rage of number of topics. This approach can be useful when the number of topics is not theoretically motivated or based on closer, qualitative inspection of the data. In the example below, the determination of the optimal number of topics follows @murzintcev2020idealtopics, but we only use two metrics (*CaoJuan2009* and *Deveaud2014*) - it is highly recommendable to inspect the results of the four metrics available for the `FindTopicsNumber` function (*Griffiths2004*, *CaoJuan2009*, *Arun2010*, and *Deveaud2014*). 

```{r tm3b, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create models with different number of topics
result <- ldatuning::FindTopicsNumber(
  DTM,
  topics = seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 1),
  metrics = c("CaoJuan2009",  "Deveaud2014"),
  method = "Gibbs",
  control = list(seed = 77),
  verbose = TRUE
)
```


We can now plot the results. In this case, we have only use two methods *CaoJuan2009* and *Griffith2004*. The best number of topics shows low values for *CaoJuan2009* and high values for *Griffith2004* (optimally, several methods should converge and show peaks and dips respectively for a certain number of topics).

```{r tm3c, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
FindTopicsNumber_plot(result)
```


For our first analysis, however, we choose a thematic "resolution" of `K = 20` topics. In contrast to a resolution of 100 or more, this number of topics can be evaluated qualitatively very easy.

```{r tm4}
# number of topics
K <- 20
# set random number generator seed
set.seed(9161)
# compute the LDA model, inference via 1000 iterations of Gibbs sampling
topicModel <- LDA(DTM, K, method="Gibbs", control=list(iter = 500, verbose = 25))
```

Depending on the size of the vocabulary, the collection size and the number K, the inference of topic models can take a very long time. This calculation may take several minutes. If it takes too long, reduce the vocabulary in the DTM by increasing the minimum frequency in the previous step.

The topic model inference results in two (approximate) posterior probability distributions: a distribution `theta` over K topics within each document and a distribution `beta` over V terms within each topic, where V represents the length of the vocabulary of the collection (V = `r nTerms(DTM)`). Let's take a closer look at these results:


```{r tm5}
# have a look a some of the results (posterior distributions)
tmResult <- posterior(topicModel)
# format of the resulting object
attributes(tmResult)
nTerms(DTM)              # lengthOfVocab
# topics are probability distributions over the entire vocabulary
beta <- tmResult$terms   # get beta from results
dim(beta)                # K distributions over nTerms(DTM) terms
rowSums(beta)            # rows in beta sum to 1
nDocs(DTM)               # size of collection
# for every document we have a probability distribution of its contained topics
theta <- tmResult$topics 
dim(theta)               # nDocs(DTM) distributions over K topics
rowSums(theta)[1:10]     # rows in theta sum to 1
```

Let's take a look at the 10 most likely terms within the term probabilities `beta` of the inferred topics (only the first 8 are shown below).

```{r tm6}
terms(topicModel, 10)
```

```{r tm7}
exampleTermData <- terms(topicModel, 10)
exampleTermData[, 1:8]
```

For the next steps, we want to give the topics more descriptive names than just numbers. Therefore, we simply concatenate the five most likely terms of each topic to a string that represents a pseudo-name for each topic.

```{r tm8}
top5termsPerTopic <- terms(topicModel, 5)
topicNames <- apply(top5termsPerTopic, 2, paste, collapse=" ")
```

## Visualization of Words and Topics{-}

Although wordclouds may not be optimal for scientific purposes they can provide a quick visual overview of a set of terms. Let's look at some topics as wordcloud.

In the following code, you can change the variable **topicToViz** with values between 1 and 20 to display other topics.

``` {r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=F}
# visualize topics as word cloud
topicToViz <- 11 # change for your own topic of interest
topicToViz <- grep('mexico', topicNames)[1] # Or select a topic by a term contained in its name
# select to 40 most probable terms from the topic by sorting the term-topic-probability vector in decreasing order
top40terms <- sort(tmResult$terms[topicToViz,], decreasing=TRUE)[1:40]
words <- names(top40terms)
# extract the probabilites of each of the 40 terms
probabilities <- sort(tmResult$terms[topicToViz,], decreasing=TRUE)[1:40]
# visualize the terms as wordcloud
mycolors <- brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")
wordcloud(words, probabilities, random.order = FALSE, color = mycolors)
```

Let us now look more closely at the distribution of topics within individual documents. To this end, we visualize the distribution in 3 sample documents.

Let us first take a look at the contents of three sample documents:

```{r tm9}
exampleIds <- c(2, 100, 200)
lapply(corpus[exampleIds], as.character)
```

```{r tm10}
exampleIds <- c(2, 100, 200)
print(paste0(exampleIds[1], ": ", substr(content(corpus[[exampleIds[1]]]), 0, 400), '...'))
print(paste0(exampleIds[2], ": ", substr(content(corpus[[exampleIds[2]]]), 0, 400), '...'))
print(paste0(exampleIds[3], ": ", substr(content(corpus[[exampleIds[3]]]), 0, 400), '...'))
```

After looking into the documents, we visualize the topic distributions within the documents.

``` {r results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
N <- length(exampleIds)
# get topic proportions form example documents
topicProportionExamples <- theta[exampleIds,]
colnames(topicProportionExamples) <- topicNames
vizDataFrame <- melt(cbind(data.frame(topicProportionExamples), document = factor(1:N)), variable.name = "topic", id.vars = "document")  
ggplot(data = vizDataFrame, aes(topic, value, fill = document), ylab = "proportion") + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +  
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ document, ncol = N)
```

## Topic distributions{-}

The figure above shows how topics within a document are distributed according to the model. In the current model all three documents show at least a small percentage of each topic. However, two to three topics dominate each document.

The topic distribution within a document can be controlled with the *Alpha*-parameter of the model. Higher alpha priors for topics result in an even distribution of topics within a document. Low alpha priors ensure that the inference process distributes the probability mass on a few topics for each document. 

In the previous model calculation the alpha-prior was automatically estimated in order to fit to the data (highest overall probability of the model). However, this automatic estimate does not necessarily correspond to the results that one would like to have as an analyst. Depending on our analysis interest, we might be interested in a more peaky/more even distribution of topics in the model. 

Now let us change the alpha prior to a lower value to see how this affects the topic distributions in the model.

```{r tm11}
# see alpha from previous model
attr(topicModel, "alpha") 
```

```{r tm12}
topicModel2 <- LDA(DTM, K, method="Gibbs", control=list(iter = 500, verbose = 25, alpha = 0.2))
tmResult <- posterior(topicModel2)
theta <- tmResult$topics
beta <- tmResult$terms
topicNames <- apply(terms(topicModel2, 5), 2, paste, collapse = " ")  # reset topicnames
```

Now visualize the topic distributions in the three documents again. What are the differences in the distribution structure?

``` {r results="hide", echo=T, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
# get topic proportions form example documents
topicProportionExamples <- theta[exampleIds,]
colnames(topicProportionExamples) <- topicNames
vizDataFrame <- melt(cbind(data.frame(topicProportionExamples), document = factor(1:N)), variable.name = "topic", id.vars = "document")  
ggplot(data = vizDataFrame, aes(topic, value, fill = document), ylab = "proportion") + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +  
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ document, ncol = N)
```

## Topic ranking{-}

First, we try to get a more meaningful order of top terms per topic by re-ranking them with a specific score [@Chang2009]. The idea of re-ranking terms is similar to the idea of TF-IDF. The more a term appears in top levels w.r.t. its probability, the less meaningful it is to describe the topic. Hence, the scoring advanced favors terms to describe a topic.

```{r tm13}
# re-rank top topic terms for topic names
topicNames <- apply(lda::top.topic.words(beta, 5, by.score = T), 2, paste, collapse = " ")
```

What are the defining topics within a collection? There are different approaches to find out which can be used to bring the topics into a certain order.

### Approach 1{-}

We sort topics according to their probability within the entire collection:

```{r tm14}
# What are the most probable topics in the entire collection?
topicProportions <- colSums(theta) / nDocs(DTM)  # mean probabilities over all paragraphs
names(topicProportions) <- topicNames     # assign the topic names we created before
sort(topicProportions, decreasing = TRUE) # show summed proportions in decreased order
```
```{r tm15}
soP <- sort(topicProportions, decreasing = TRUE)
paste(round(soP, 5), ":", names(soP))
```

We recognize some topics that are way more likely to occur in the corpus than others. These describe rather general thematic coherence. Other topics correspond more to specific contents. 

### Approach 2{-}

We count how often a topic appears as a primary topic within a paragraph This method is also called Rank-1.

```{r tm16}
countsOfPrimaryTopics <- rep(0, K)
names(countsOfPrimaryTopics) <- topicNames
for (i in 1:nDocs(DTM)) {
  topicsPerDoc <- theta[i, ] # select topic distribution for document i
  # get first element position from ordered list
  primaryTopic <- order(topicsPerDoc, decreasing = TRUE)[1] 
  countsOfPrimaryTopics[primaryTopic] <- countsOfPrimaryTopics[primaryTopic] + 1
}
sort(countsOfPrimaryTopics, decreasing = TRUE)
```
```{r tm17}
so <- sort(countsOfPrimaryTopics, decreasing = TRUE)
paste(so, ":", names(so))
```

We see that sorting topics by the  Rank-1 method places topics with rather specific thematic coherences in upper ranks of the list. 

This sorting of topics can be used for further analysis steps such as the semantic interpretation of topics found in the collection, the analysis of time series of the most important topics or the filtering of the original collection based on specific sub-topics.

## Filtering documents{-}

The fact that a topic model conveys of topic probabilities for each document, resp. paragraph in our case, makes it possible to use it for thematic filtering of a collection. AS filter we select only those documents which exceed a certain threshold of their probability value for certain topics (for example, each document which contains topic `X` to more than 20 percent).

In the following, we will select documents based on their topic content and display the resulting document quantity over time.

```{r tm18}
topicToFilter <- 6  # you can set this manually ...
# ... or have it selected by a term in the topic name (e.g. 'children')
topicToFilter <- grep('children', topicNames)[1] 
topicThreshold <- 0.2
selectedDocumentIndexes <- which(theta[, topicToFilter] >= topicThreshold)
filteredCorpus <- corpus[selectedDocumentIndexes]
# show length of filtered corpus
filteredCorpus
``` 

Our filtered corpus contains `r length(filteredCorpus)` documents related to the topic `r topicToFilter` to at least 20 %.

## Topic proportions over time{-}

In a last step, we provide a distant view on the topics in the data over time. For this, we aggregate mean topic proportions per decade of all SOTU speeches. These aggregated topic proportions can then be visualized, e.g. as a bar plot. 

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.align='center', warning=F, message=F}
# append decade information for aggregation
textdata$decade <- paste0(substr(textdata$date, 0, 3), "0")
# get mean topic proportions per decade
topic_proportion_per_decade <- aggregate(theta, by = list(decade = textdata$decade), mean)
# set topic names to aggregated columns
colnames(topic_proportion_per_decade)[2:(K+1)] <- topicNames
# reshape data frame
vizDataFrame <- melt(topic_proportion_per_decade, id.vars = "decade")
# plot topic proportions per decade as bar plot
ggplot(vizDataFrame, aes(x=decade, y=value, fill=variable)) +
