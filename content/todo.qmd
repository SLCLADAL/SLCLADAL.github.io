# Issues

**To be resolved ASAP**

Rewrite

* mapping
* textanalysis
* tagging

**Intermediate to-dos**

Add tutorials on

1. MuPARF (cool method used in Second language Acquisiton that combined regressiona dn Random Forstes)

2. Semantic Analysis (WordNet and Semantic taggers)

3. SEMs (just a basic example and talking about the pros and cons)

4. Loading data (showing how to load and save different types of data structures)

5. Interrrater reliability

6. Add to the data vis tutorial (expand the list of visualization types)

7. Create a video about how people can fx errors on LADAL via GitHub

8. Think about the Sherratization (but I will definitely need help with that - I hope Sam will be able to assist me in this...)
