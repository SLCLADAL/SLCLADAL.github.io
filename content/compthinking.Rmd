The workshop **Computational Thinking in the Humanities** was a 3-hour online workshop featuring two plenary talks, lightning presentations, as well as a panel discussion. The workshop is co-organized by the [**Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)**](https://www.atap.edu.au/), [**FIN-CLARIAH** ](https://www.kielipankki.fi/organization/fin-clariah/) and its UEF representatives, and the [**Australian Digital Observatory**](https://www.digitalobservatory.net.au/). 

The workshop has received financial supported from the [**Digital Cultures and Societies Hub**](https://hass.uq.edu.au/Digital-Cultures-and-Societies) at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/). 

The workshop took place 

**Thursday, Sep. 1, 2022**, 5-8pm Queensland, 10am-1pm Finland,  8-11am UK.



# Event Description {-}

Computers and software are now inescapable in our daily lives - while much of our research might now be enabled or mediated by these computers, that doesn't mean that our research practices have fundamentally changed - a digital library is still recognisably a library. 

* What does computational thinking mean for the humanities?  
* How can the humanities embrace computing and computational approaches on their own terms, and avoid simply scavenging and repurposing approaches developed within other fields?  
* How do we resist having our "problems" "solved" for us?  
* What are the methodological and epistemological foundations of a field that is both computational and of the humanities - does computation actually change the nature of what we do?  

This international workshop will bring together speakers to address this topic, drawing on perspectives from several fields. We hope that this event will prompt reflection, introduce new ideas, spark discussions and plant the seeds for future collaborations.
