## Other Resources{-}

### BookNLP{-}

[BookNLP](https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp) is a natural language processing pipeline that scales to books and other long documents (in English), including:

* Part-of-speech tagging  
* Dependency parsing  
* Entity recognition  
* Character name clustering (e.g., "Tom", "Tom Sawyer", "Mr. Sawyer", "Thomas Sawyer" -> TOM_SAWYER) and coreference resolution  
* Quotation speaker identification  
* Supersense tagging (e.g., "animal", "artifact", "body", "cognition", etc.)  
* Event tagging  
* Referential gender inference (TOM_SAWYER -> he/him/his)

BookNLP ships with two models, both with identical architectures but different underlying BERT sizes. The larger and more accurate big model is fit for GPUs and multi-core computers; the faster small model is more appropriate for personal computers.

### Digital Humanities Awards{-}

The [Digital Humanities Awards](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2021/voting/) page contains a list of great DH resources for the following categories:

* Best DH Dataset  
* Best DH Short Publication  
* Best DH Tool Or Suite Of Tools  
* Best DH Training Materials  
* Special Category: Best DH Response To COVID-19

### Text Analysis in Python for Social Scientists{-}

The book [Text Analysis in Python for Social Scientists. Prediction and Classification](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/text-analysis-in-python-for-social-scientists/54B82AEA3FB586919A2265E6799ACB11#element)  contains a wealth of information about about a wide variety of sociocultural constructs. Automated prediction methods can infer these quantities (sentiment analysis is probably the most well-known application). However, there is virtually no limit to the kinds of things we can predict from text: power, trust, misogyny, are all signaled in language. These algorithms easily scale to corpus sizes infeasible for manual analysis. Prediction algorithms have become steadily more powerful, especially with the advent of neural network methods. However, applying these techniques usually requires profound programming knowledge and machine learning expertise. As a result, many social scientists do not apply them. This Element provides the working social scientist with an overview of the most common methods for text classification, an intuition of their applicability, and Python code to execute them. It covers both the ethical foundations of such work as well as the emerging potential of neural network methods.

### Data Measurements Tool{-}

[This blog entry introduces the Data Measurements Tool](https://huggingface.co/blog/data-measurements-tool). The Data Measurements Tool is a Interactive Tool for Looking at Datasets. The Data Measurements Tool is a open-source Python library and no-code interface called the Data Measurements Tool, using our Dataset and Spaces Hubs paired with the great Streamlit tool. This can be used to help understand, build, curate, and compare datasets.

# Style Guide {-}

## Introduction{-}

If you want to contribute to LADAL and become an author, you can use [**this stylesheet**](https://slcladal.github.io/content/base.Rmd) for your LADAL tutorial. The sections below provide additional information on the style and format of your LADAL tutorial. The R Markdown document that you can use as a template can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/content/base.Rmd).

You will also have to download the bibliography file from https://slcladal.github.io/content/bibliography.bib for the tutorial to be knitted correctly. Although the knitted (or rendered) html file will look different from the LADAL design (because we have modified the theme for the LADAL page), it will be just like a proper LADAL tutorial once we have knitted the Rmd file on our machines and integrated your tutorial into the LADAL website.

**Preparation and session set up**

This tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # suppress math annotation
# install packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("flextable")
# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rlesur/klippy")
```

Next, we activate the packages. Please include `klippy` in the installation and loading chunks  to allow easy copy&pasting of code.

```{r prep2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# activate packages
library(tidyverse)
library(flextable)
# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button
klippy::klippy()
```

Once you have installed R, RStudio, and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

## Tutorial content

Load some data and show what you want to show.


```{r load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
data <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/sld.rda", "rb"))
```

Use `flextable` for displaying tabular data as shown below. 

```{r extable, echo = T, message=F, warning=F}
data %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  head(10) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::set_table_properties(width = .5, layout = "autofit") %>%
  flextable::theme_zebra() %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12) %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12, part = "header") %>%
  flextable::align_text_col(align = "center") %>%
  flextable::set_caption(caption = "")  %>%
  flextable::border_outer()
```



Below is the code chunk for exercises.


***

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#51247a; color:#f2f2f2'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>EXERCISE TIME!</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
</p></span>
</div>

<div class="question">` 

1. This is an example question.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  ```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  # this is some code
  1+1
  ```
</details>


</div>`

## Remarks on type setting

Level 1 headers with numbers,, lower level headers without numbering (add {-} at the end of the header to suppress numbering).

Function and package names in `package` style (different from normal text). 

Use italics for emphasis rather than bold type. 

## Citation & Session Info {-}

Your last name, your first name. `r format(Sys.time(), '%Y')`. *The title of your tutorial*. Your location: your affiliation (in case you have one). url: https://slcladal.github.io/shorttitleofyourtutorial.html (Version `r format(Sys.time(), '%Y.%m.%d')`).
