# Introduction{-}

Most people work with computers daily, yet few have been taught how to effectively organize files and folders, manage data, and prevent data loss. This tutorial aims to fill that gap by providing practical advice and general tips to keep your computer clean and running smoothly. Additionally, we will explore methods for organizing files and folders efficiently. Finally, we will offer guidance on managing and storing data safely and orderly.

This tutorial will address the following issues:

- Your computer is very slow and gets very hot
- Your filing system is a mess, and you want to tidy it up
- You want to secure your files from unauthorized access
- You want to work more efficiently with tabulated data

Our focus will be on Windows machines, and the content is designed for everyone, especially those who consider themselves less computer-savvy. Therefore, we will not cover in detail the manual optimization of Windows and system options. For more advanced users, additional resources on optimizing Windows and system settings for maximum performance can be found here.

This tutorial builds on resources such as the Digital Essentials module offered by the UQ Library, the Reproducible Research resources created by Griffith University’s Library and eResearch Services, and Amanda Miotto’s Reproducible Research Things. For more comprehensive information on computers, the digital world, and computer safety, refer to the Digital Essentials course available through UQ’s library resources.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of:

- Keeping your computer running efficiently and preventing overheating
- Organizing your files and folders systematically
- Securing your files to protect them from unauthorized access
- Managing tabulated data effectively to enhance productivity

Let's get started on making your computer experience smoother and more secure.

# General Tips for Using Computers{-}

In this section, we will cover some essential tips to prevent your computer from slowing down or overheating. These tips are also useful for increasing your computer's speed. With proper care, even older machines can handle most everyday tasks and meet your computational needs.

## Restart Your Computer Regularly{-}

- While it can be convenient to use sleep mode repeatedly, you should shut down and restart your computer regularly. This is necessary to install already downloaded updates and allows your computer to clear out accumulated data. Rather than using sleep mode, shut down and restart your computer at least once per week so automatic software updates can be installed. In cases of high security risk, you may be forced to restart your computer immediately, as updates often close security gaps in specific programs or the operating system.

## Keep Your Computer Up-to-Date{-}

- Keeping your computer up-to-date is crucial for smooth performance and security. Outdated software lacks the latest security features and can put your computer at risk.
- Although updates can be annoying, they help close security gaps and improve the functionality of the software you use. Regularly check for updates to ensure your system is protected and runs efficiently. If you are unsure how to check for updates, a step-by-step tutorial is available here.

## Monitor Your Computer's Performance{-}

- Regularly monitor your computer's performance to identify and resolve potential issues early. Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) can help you keep an eye on resource usage and terminate unnecessary processes that slow down your system.

## Manage Startup Programs{-}

- Many programs are set to start automatically when your computer boots up, which can significantly slow down startup times. Use Task Manager (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac) to manage and disable unnecessary startup programs.

## Clean Up Your Hard Drive{-}

- Over time, your computer accumulates unnecessary files that can slow down performance. Regularly clean up your hard drive by deleting temporary files, clearing cache, and removing unused programs. Tools like Disk Cleanup (Windows) or CleanMyMac (Mac) can automate this process.

## Use Anti-Virus Software{-}

Using reliable antivirus software is essential to protect your computer from malware, viruses, and other security threats. Here are some key points to consider:

* **What Antivirus Software Does**: Antivirus software scans your computer for malicious software (malware) and checks if any installed software behaves differently than expected if it were not infected. It also prevents, detects, and removes malicious software to protect your system.

* **Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP)**: This antivirus software is installed on all UQ computers. SEP protects your computer from malware and regularly checks for infections. To run a manual scan, click on the antivirus software icon in the lower right corner of your PC and follow the instructions. While SEP is not free for private use, UQ members can get a discount through a special deal with the manufacturer.

* **Free Antivirus Alternatives**: There are several free antivirus options available if you prefer not to pay for antivirus software. One popular choice is the free version of Avira. Avira not only protects your computer from malware but also includes features to improve your computer's performance. Depending on the version, Avira can also implement these improvements automatically.

* **Malwarebytes**: Another excellent option is Malwarebytes, which also offers a free version. Malwarebytes is known for its extensive and up-to-date malware database, which allows it to detect even the most recent malware threats. It provides comprehensive protection and is a valuable addition to your cybersecurity toolkit.

* **Regular Scans and Updates**: Regularly running antivirus scans and keeping your software updated ensures that your computer remains protected against the latest threats. Most antivirus programs offer scheduled scans and automatic updates to keep your system secure without requiring manual intervention.

By using reliable antivirus software and keeping it updated, you can significantly reduce the risk of malware infections and maintain your computer's performance and security.

## Optimize Power Settings{-}

- Adjust your computer's power settings to balance performance and energy consumption. In Windows, use the Power Options settings to select a balanced or high-performance plan. On a Mac, access Energy Saver preferences to customize your power settings.

## Keep Your Computer Physically Clean{-}

- Dust and debris can accumulate inside your computer, causing it to overheat and slow down. Regularly clean your computer's exterior and interior components, such as the keyboard, vents, and fans. Use compressed air to remove dust from hard-to-reach areas.

By following these tips, you can ensure your computer remains efficient, secure, and capable of handling your daily tasks. Proper maintenance and regular updates are key to extending the life and performance of your machine.

## Look out for leeches and malware {-}

* When you download software, it is quite common that, in addition to the software you are looking for, other additional software will be downloaded and installed as a default. To avoid this, make sure to uncheck such options when installing the software that you want. This simply requires that you pay attention and read the options that you can check or uncheck during the installation when installing software.

## Use anti-virus software {-}

* Antivirus software checks if any software on your computer has been reported as malware or if your software differs from what it should look like if it were not infected.

* Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) is an anti-virus software that is installed on all UQ computers. This software protects your computer from malware but also checks if your computer is already “infected”. Such checks are performed regularly but to run such a check manually, you can simply click on the antivirus software icon in the lower right corner of your PC and follow the instructions. While Symantec Endpoint Protection is not free and you have to pay a fee if you want to install it on a private PC, UQ has a deal with the manufacturer that gives UQ members a discount.

* There are also free alternatives available such as the free version of Avira in case you do not want to pay for anti-virus software. Both the free and the commercial versions of Avira have the advantage that they also allow you to check if the performance of your PC can be improved (in addition to merely protecting your computer) and - depending on the version - they can also implement these improvements.

* Another option that helps to detect software on your computer is Malwarebytes which also has a free version and which has the most up-to-date data base of malware which means that it is able to detect even very “fresh” malware.

## No data on Desktop or C-drive {-}

* When you start your computer, different parts of the computer are started at different times with different priorities. The Desktop is always started with the highest priority which means that if you have a lot of stuff on your desktop, then the computer will load all that stuff once it kicks into action (which will cause it to work quite heavily at each start and also slow down quite dramatically).

* This means that you should avoid storing data on any part of your system that is activated routinely. Rather, try to separate things that need to be loaded from things that only need to be loaded if they are actually used. For this reason, you should also avoid storing data on your C-drive. In fact, the C-drive should only contain programs as it is activated automatically at each start.

* You can, for example, store all your projects on your D-Drive or, even better, on OneDrive, Google’s MyDrive, or in Dropbox where it is only started once you actively click and open a folder. If you use cloud-based storage options (OneDrive, Google’s MyDrive, or Dropbox) the files are also backed up automatically. However, you should not use either of these for sensitive data (sensitive data should be stored on your PC, an external hard drive and UQ’s RDM.)

* If you want to have data accessible via your desktop, you can still do so by using links (also called short-cuts): place a link to your data (stored on another drive) on your desktop and you can load your data easily without it being activated at every start.

## Tidy your room! {-}

* Just like in real life, you should clean your computer. Full bins, for instance, will slow down your computer so you should empty it regularly. In addition, your computer will store and collect files when it is running. These files (temp files, cookies, etc.) also slow your computer down. As such files are redundant, they should be deleted regularly. You can remove such files manually using the msconfig prompt (you find a video tutorial on how to do this here). If you want to optimize your computer manually via the msconfig prompt, simply enter msconfig in the Window’s search box in the lower left corner of your PC (or search for it in the search box that opens when you click on the Window’s symbol). However, an easier way is to use software to help you with cleaning your computer.

## Software to clean your computer {-}

* While UQ provides various software applications that keep your computer secure, it does not have any specific recommendations for software to keep your computer digitally clean.

* Luckily, there are numerous software applications that can help you with keeping your computer clean and up-to-date (you will find a list of software options for PCs here). We will only look at two options here (The two applications we will discuss are CCleaner and Avira) but a quick Google search will provide you with many different alternatives.

* The most widely used program to clean your computer (if you have a PC rather than a Mac) is CCleaner. There are different versions of CCleaner but the free version suffices to delete any superfluous files and junk from your computer. When using this program, you should, however, be careful not to remove information that is useful. For instance, I like to keep all tabs of my current session in my browser and I therefore have to change the default options in CCleaner to avoid having to reopen all my tabs when I next open my browser. Here is a short video tutorial on how to use the CCleaner.

*  In addition, the free version of Avira also has a function that you can use to clean your computer. In fact, Avira will also inform you about any software that is out-of-date and other issues. Here is a short video tutorial on how to use the Avira for cleaning your computer and performing an anti-virus scan.

## Encryption and Computer Security {-}

Ensuring that your computer and network are secured means that you have far less a chance of a data breach or hack.

As some information is sensitive (especially when it comes to exams and attendance in courses), I encrypt folders and files that contain such information. To encrypt a file or folder I right-click on the file or folder and go to properties > advanced, the I check encrypt contents to secure data and confirm the changes by checking OK. Then I back-up the encryption key where I check enable certificate privacy and create password and store the encrypted file in the original folder. You can find a step-by-step guide on how to encrypt files in this video.

You can also encrypt your entire computer. Information about how to do this can be found here and tips specific for

* Macs can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204837)

* Windows 10 can be found [here](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10)

* Windows 7 can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=4794)

It is also recommendable to use or create strong passwords. Here are some tips for creating secure passwords:

* Don’t just use one password - use a different password for every account

* Use a pass phrase - instead of a singular word, try a sequence of words for instance, DogsandCatsareawesome (Do not use this as your password)

* Include numbers, capital letters and symbols

* The longer the password, the better

* Don’t write passwords down

* Turn on two-factor authentication

An alternative is to use a password manager. Again, the Digital Essentials module has a lot of information about password management (password managers explained in detail in section 4).

Password managers provide a similar level of convenience to “Login with Facebook” but are much safer. Password managers create an encrypted database of all your usernames and passwords, that only you can access with a master password. This means you only need to remember one password to have access to all of your accounts. Most password managers will include the ability to generate secure passwords that you can use for new or existing account logins. Because you only need to remember one master password, you can generate and store complex passwords for your needs. This way, you are not relying on your memory and easy passwords to remember many different account login details.

Also, to find out if your email has been compromised, you can check this here

Recently, UQ has adopted Multi-Factor Authentication which is more secure than simple authentication. You should use it when the option is available (Signing in with a password and an email to your account with a pin).

As a general tip, avoid unsecured wifi and, if its available, Eduroam is usually a better option than free wifi/cafe wifi.

For Beginners

* Have good strong passwords and encrypt your computer’s hard drive

For Intermediates

* Get set up on a password manager

For Advanced passwordists

* Try to ensure that your team/cluster is encrypted and practicing safe habits.
