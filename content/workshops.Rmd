LADAL and its collaborators offer workshops of matter relating to text analytics, statistics, data visualization, and related topics. This page contains links, information, and details about upcoming and past workshops offered by LADAL or its collaborators and partners. Also, LADAL members present their research or information relevant to LADAL at conferences. Below are links to upcoming events (conferences/workshops/presentations) and presentations containing information about LADAL or research based on LADAL. 

# Upcoming Workshops{-}

Below you will find the details of the workshops offered by LADAL or [Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)](https://www.atap.edu.au) or its collaborators and partners.




# Previous workshops{-}

## 17 June 2022 - AcqVA Aurora workshop: From Tables to Forests{-}

```{r acqvaj10, echo=FALSE, out.width= "30%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/acqvalab.png")
```

This workshop consists of two parts. The first part of the workshop focuses on loading and working with tabular data R. In this part of the workshop, we will learn how to load, inspect, process, and summarize tabulated data. The second part of the workshop focuses tree-based models in R, such as conditional inference trees, random forests, and Boruta, which have become more prominent in the language science over the past decade. This part will discuss the underlying logic of tree-based models, how they can be implemented in R, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.
 
The materials for this workshop can be accessed via [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/acqvatabletree) and the rendered script is available [here](https://martinschweinberger.github.io/acqvatabletree/).
