# Introduction{-}

This document represents an empty R markdown file (or Rmd file) for a LADAL tutorial. The R markdown document for this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/base.Rmd).

You will also have to download the bibliography file from https://slcladal.github.io/bibliogrpahy.bib for the tutorial to be knitted correctly. Although the knitted (or rendered) html file will look different from the LADAL design (because we have modified the theme for the LADAL page), it will be just like a proper LADAL tutorial once we have knitted the Rmd file on our machines and integrated your tutorial into the LADAL website.

## Preparation and session set up{-}

This tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # suppress math annotation
# install packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse"))
```

```{r prep2, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# activate packages
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(DT)
```

Once you have installed R, RStudio, and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Tutorial content

Load some data and show what you want to show.

```{r load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
data <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/lmmdata.txt", header = TRUE)
# display data
head(data)
```
