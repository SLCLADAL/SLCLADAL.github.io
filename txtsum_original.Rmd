# Introduction{-}

This tutorial shows how to summarize texts automatically using R by extracting the most prototypical sentences. The RNotebook for this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/txtsum.Rmd). If you want to render the Rmarkdown notebook on your machine, i.e. knitting the document to a html or pdf file, you need to make sure that you have R installed and you also need to download the [bibliography file](https://slcladal.github.io/bibliography.bib) and store it in the same folder where you store the Rmd file. 


**Preparation and session set up**

This tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html). For this tutorials, we need to install certain *packages* from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead and ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the libraries so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)          # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 12) # suppress math annotation
# install packages
install.packages("xml2")
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("lexRankr")
install.packages("textmineR")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("quanteda")
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("here")
# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks
remotes::install_github("rlesur/klippy")
```

Next we activate the packages.

```{r prep2, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# activate packages
library(xml2)
library(rvest)
library(lexRankr)
library(textmineR)
library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda)
library(igraph)
library(here)
# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button
klippy::klippy()
```

Once you have installed RStudio and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Basic Text summarization

This section shows an easy to use text summarizing method which extracts the most prototypical sentences from a text. As such, this text summarizer does not generate sentences based on prototypical words but evaluates how prototypical or cetral sentences are and then orders the sentences in a text according to their prototypicality (or centrality).

For this example, we will download text from a Guardian article about a meeting between Angela Merkel and Donald Trump at the G20 summit in 2017. In a first step, we define the url of the webpage hosting the artcile.

```{r}
# url to scrape
url = "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/26/angela-merkel-and-donald-trump-head-for-clash-at-g20-summit"
```

Next, we extract the text of the article using the`xml2  and the `rvest` packages.

```{r}
# read page html
page = xml2::read_html(url)
# extract text from page html using selector
page %>%
  # extract paragraphs
  rvest::html_nodes("p") %>%
  # extract text
  rvest::html_text() -> text
# inspect data
head(text)
```

Now that we have the text, we apply the `lexRank` function from the `lexRankr` package to determine the prototypicality (or centrality) and extract the three most central sentences.

```{r}
# perform lexrank for top 3 sentences
top3sentences = lexRankr::lexRank(text,
                          # only 1 article; repeat same docid for all of input vector
                          docId = rep(1, length(text)),
                          # return 3 sentences to mimick /u/autotldr's output
                          n = 3,
                          continuous = TRUE)
# inspect
top3sentences
```

Next, we extract and display the sentences from the table. 

```{r}
top3sentences$sentence
```

The output show the three most prototypical (or central) sentences of the article. The articles are already in chronological order - if the sentences were not in chronological order, we could also have ordered them by *sentenceId* before displaying them using `dplyr` and `stringr` package functions as shown below (in our case the order does not change as the prototypicality and the chronological order are identical).

```{r}
top3sentences %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sentenceId = as.numeric(stringr::str_remove_all(sentenceId, ".*_"))) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(sentenceId) %>%
  dplyr::pull(sentence)
```

# Advanced text summarization

The approach to text summarization shown in this section is based on the vignette for the `textmineR` package provided by Thomas W. Jones (see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textmineR/vignettes/e_doc_summarization.html)). This approach is a bit more compelx compared to the text summarizing shown above as it is a version of the TextRank algorithm and uses word embeddings and network analysis to build a basic document summarizer.

In a first step, we split a document into sentences, create a nearest-neighbor network where sentences are connected to other similar sentences, and rank the sentences according to eigenvector centrality.

We will use a word embedding model, created on a whole corpus, to project the sentences into the embedding space. Once in the embedding space, we will measure similarity between documents using Hellinger distance. Hellinger distance is a metric specifically for probability distributions. Since we’ll use LDA to create embeddings to a probability space, it’s a useful measure.

## Getting started{-}

We’ll use the movie review data set from text2vec again. The first thing we need to do is create a TCM and embedding model. We will skip evaluation such as R-squared, coherence, inspecting top terms, etc. However, in any real application, I’d strongly suggest evaluating your models at every step of the way.

```{r}
darwin <- base::readRDS(url("https://slcladal.github.io/data/origindarwin.rda", "rb")) %>%
  # remove superfluous white spaces
  stringr::str_squish() %>% 
  paste0(collapse = " ") %>%
  stringr::str_remove_all("- ") %>%
  stringi::stri_split_boundaries(type = "sentence") %>%
  unlist() %>%
  .[nchar(.) > 20]
# inspect
head(darwin, 10)
```

In a next step, we select a sample of all sentences so the code run-time is quicker. 

```{r}
# select random sample
set.seed(123)
darwin <- sample(darwin, 200)
# Create Term-Cooccurence Matrix
tcm <- CreateTcm(doc_vec = darwin,
                 skipgram_window = 10,
                 verbose = FALSE,
                 cpus = 2)
# inspect
tcm[1:5, 1:5]
```

We now use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to get embeddings into probability space. This will take considerably longer as the TCM matrix has many more rows than a Document Term Matrix (DTM).

```{r}
# create embeddings list
embeddings <- FitLdaModel(dtm = tcm,
                          k = 50,
                          iterations = 200,
                          burnin = 180,
                          alpha = 0.1,
                          beta = 0.05,
                          optimize_alpha = TRUE,
                          calc_likelihood = FALSE,
                          calc_coherence = FALSE,
                          calc_r2 = FALSE,
                          cpus = 2)
```


## Building a basic document summarizer{-}

Let’s use the above embeddings model to create a document summarizer. This will return the three most relevant sentences in each review.

The summarizer works best as a function, as we have many documents to summarize. The function summarizer is defined in the next section. However, let’s look at some key bits of code in detail.

The variable doc represents a single document, or a single element of a character vector.

In the code chunk below, we split the document into sentences using the stringi package. Then we embed each sentence under the model built on our whole corpus, above.

```{r}
# add order to sentences
names(darwin) <- seq_along(darwin)
# embed the sentences in the model
e <- CreateDtm(darwin, ngram_window = c(1,1), verbose = FALSE, cpus = 2)
# remove any documents with 2 or fewer words
e <- e[ rowSums(e) > 2 , ]
  
  vocab <- intersect(colnames(e), colnames(embeddings$gamma))
  
  e <- e / rowSums(e)
  
  e <- e[ , vocab ] %*% t(embeddings$gamma[ , vocab ])
  
  e <- as.matrix(e)
```

Next, we measure the distance between each of the sentences within the embedding space.

```{r}
# get the pairwise distances between each embedded sentence
e_dist <- CalcHellingerDist(e)
```


Since we are using a distance measure whose values fall between 0 and 1, we can take 1−distance to get a similarity. We’ll also re-scale it to be between 0 and 100. (The rescaling is just a cautionary measure so that we don’t run into numerical precision issues when performing calculations downstream.)

```{r}
# turn into a similarity matrix
g <- (1 - e_dist) * 100
```

If you consider a similarity matrix to be an adjacency matrix, then you have a fully-connected graph. For the sake of potentially faster computation and with the hope of eliminating some noise, we will delete some edges. Going row-by-row, we will keep connections only to the top 3 most similar sentences.

```{r}
# we don't need sentences connected to themselves
diag(g) <- 0
# turn into a nearest-neighbor graph
g <- apply(g, 1, function(x){
  x[ x < sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)[ 3 ] ] <- 0
  x})
# by taking pointwise max, we'll make the matrix symmetric again
g <- pmax(g, t(g))
```

Using the igraph package (with its own objects) to calculate eigenvector centrality. From there, we’ll take the top three sentences.

```{r}
g <- graph.adjacency(g, mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE)
# calculate eigenvector centrality
ev <- evcent(g)
# format the result
result <- darwin[ names(ev$vector)[ order(ev$vector, decreasing = TRUE)[ 1:3 ] ] ]
result <- result[ order(as.numeric(names(result))) ]
paste(result, collapse = " ")
```
  
## Summarizer function{-}

The code below puts it all together in a single function. The first few lines vectorize the code, so that we can summarize multiple documents from a single function call.

```{r}
summarizer <- function(doc, gamma) {
  # recursive fanciness to handle multiple docs at once
  if (length(doc) > 1 )
    # use a try statement to catch any weirdness that may arise
    return(sapply(doc, function(d) try(summarizer(d, gamma))))
  # parse it into sentences
  sent <- stringi::stri_split_boundaries(doc, type = "sentence")[[ 1 ]]
  names(sent) <- seq_along(sent) # so we know index and order
  # embed the sentences in the model
  e <- CreateDtm(sent, ngram_window = c(1,1), verbose = FALSE, cpus = 2)
  # remove any documents with 2 or fewer words
  e <- e[ rowSums(e) > 2 , ]
  vocab <- intersect(colnames(e), colnames(gamma))
  e <- e / rowSums(e)
  e <- e[ , vocab ] %*% t(gamma[ , vocab ])
  e <- as.matrix(e)
  # get the pairwise distances between each embedded sentence
  e_dist <- CalcHellingerDist(e)
  # turn into a similarity matrix
  g <- (1 - e_dist) * 100
  # we don't need sentences connected to themselves
  diag(g) <- 0
  # turn into a nearest-neighbor graph
  g <- apply(g, 1, function(x){
    x[ x < sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)[ 3 ] ] <- 0
    x
  })
  # by taking pointwise max, we'll make the matrix symmetric again
  g <- pmax(g, t(g))
  g <- graph.adjacency(g, mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE)
  # calculate eigenvector centrality
  ev <- evcent(g)
  # format the result
  result <- sent[ names(ev$vector)[ order(ev$vector, decreasing = TRUE)[ 1:3 ] ] ]
  result <- result[ order(as.numeric(names(result))) ]
  #paste(result, collapse = " ")
}
```

How well did we do? Let’s look at summaries from the first three reviews.

```{r}
# Let's see the summary of the first couple of reviews
docs <- text
names(docs) <- seq_along(1:length(text))
# apply summarizer function
sums <- summarizer(docs, gamma = embeddings$gamma)
# inspect results
sums
```

Compare that to the whole reviews yourself.
