# Introduction

This tutorial introduces collostructional analysis using "R". The entire code for the sections below can be downloaded [here](https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/collostructionalanalysisrscript.r).

Collostructional  analysis  investigates  the  lexicogrammatical associations between constructions and  lexical elements and there exist three basic subtypes of collostructional analysis: 

* Simple Collexeme Analysis
* Distinctive Collexeme Analysis
* Co-Varying Collexeme Analysis

The collostructional family of analyses (Stefanowitsch & Gries 2003, 2005; Gries & Stefanowitsch 2004; cf. also Hilpert 2006) allow for the quantification and evaluation of attraction between elements that occur in two distinct slots within a specified construction.

**Preparation and session set up**

As all visualizations in this tutorial rely on R, it is necessary to install R and RStudio. If these programs (or, in the case of R, environments) are not already installed on your machine, please search for them in your favorite search engine and add the term "download". Open any of the first few links and follow the installation instructions (they are easy to follow, do not require any specifications, and are pretty much self-explanatory).

In addition, certain *packages* need to be installed from an R *library* so that the scripts shown below are executed without errors. Before turning to the code below, please install the packages by running the code below this paragraph. If you have already installed the packages mentioned below, then you can skip ahead ignore this section. To install the necessary packages, simply run the following code - it may take some time (between 1 and 5 minutes to install all of the packages so you do not need to worry if it takes some time).

```{r prep1, echo=T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# clean current workspace
rm(list=ls(all=T))
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)         # no automatic data transformation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4) # supress math annotation
# install libraries
install.packages(c("collostructions"))
```

Once you have installed R, R-Studio, and have also initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

# Basic Simple Collexeme Analysis

```{r bsc1, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load library
library(collostructions)
# inspect inbuilt data
str(goVerb); head(goVerb)
```



```{r bsc2, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sum(goVerb$CORP.FREQ)
```


```{r bsc3, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
collex(goVerb, corpsize = 1e+08L, am = "logl", reverse = FALSE, decimals = 5,
       threshold = 1, cxn.freq = NULL, str.dir = FALSE)
```

```{r bsc4, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#collex.covar(goVerb, am = "logl", raw = TRUE, all = FALSE,
#             reverse = FALSE, decimals = 5, str.dir = FALSE)
```

```{r bsc5, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#collex.dist(goVerb, am = "logl", raw = FALSE, reverse = FALSE, decimals = 5,
#            threshold = 1, cxn.freqs = NULL, str.dir = FALSE)
```

```{r uq2, echo=F, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/uq2.jpg")
