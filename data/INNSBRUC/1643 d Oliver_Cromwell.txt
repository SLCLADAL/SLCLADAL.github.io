SIR The complaints you preferred to my lord against your Lieutenant Colonel both by Mr Lee and your own letters have occasioned his stay here my Lord being 'so' employed in regard of many occasions which are upon him that he hath not been at leisure to hear him make his defence which in pure justice ought to be granted him or any man before a judgment be passed upon him During his abode here and absence from you he hath acquainted me what a grief it is to him to be ab_sent from his charge especially now the regiment is called forth to action and therefore asking of me my opinion I advised him speedily to repair unto you Surely you are not well advised thus to turn off one so faithful to the cause and so able to serve you as this man is Give me leave to tell you I cannot be of your judgment 'cannot understand if a man notorious for wickedness for oaths for drinking hath as great a share in your affection as one who fears an oath who fears to sin that this doth commend your elec_tion of men to serve as fit instruments in this work! Ay but the man is an Anabaptist Are you sure of that? Admit he be shall that render him incapable to serve the Public? He is indiscreet It may be so in some things we have all human infirmities I tell you if you had none but such indiscreet men about you and would be pleased to use them kindly you would find as good a fence to you as any you have yet chosen Sir the State in choosing men to serve it takes no notice of their opinions if they be willing faithfully to serve it that satisfies I advised you formerly to bear with men of different minds from yourself if you had done it when I advised you to it I think you would not have had so many stumblingblocks in your way It may be you judge otherwise but I tell you my mind I desire you would receive this man into your favour and opinion I believe if he follow my counsel he will deserve no other but respect from you Take heed of being sharp or too easily sharpened by others against those to whom you can object little but that they square not with you in every opinion concerning matters of religion If there be any other offence to be charged upon him that must in a judicial way receive determination I know you will not think it fit my Lord should discharge an Officer of the Field but in a regulate way I question whether you or I have any precedent for that I have no further to trouble you but rest Your humble servant OLIVER CROMWELL 
