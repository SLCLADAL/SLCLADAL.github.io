It hath pleased God to bring off Sir Thomas Fair_fax his Horse over the river from Hull being about One and twenty Troops of Horse and Dragoons The Lincolnshire Horse laboured to hinder this work being about Thirty four Colours of Horse and Dragoons we marched up to their landing place and the Lincolnshire Horse retreated After they were come over we all marched towards Holland and when we came to our last quarter upon the edge of Holland the Enemy quartered within four miles of us and kept the field all night with his whole body his intendment as we conceive was to fight us or hoping to interpose betwixt us and our retreat having received to his Thirty four Colours of Horse Twenty fresh Troops ten Companies of 'Dragoons ' and about a Thousand Foot being General King's own Regiment With these he attempted our guards and our quarters and if God had not been merciful had ruined us before we had known of it the Five Troops we set to keep the watch failing much of their duty But we got to horse and retreated in good order with the safety of all our Horse of the Association not losing four of them that I hear of and we got five of theirs And for this we are exceedingly bound to the goodness of God who brought our troops off with so little loss I write unto you to acquaint you with this the rather that God may be acknowledged and that you may help forward in sending such force away unto us as lie unprofitably in your country And especially that Troop of Captain Margery's which surely would not be wanting now we so much need it! I hear there hath been much exception taken to Captain Margery and his Officers for taking of horses I am sorry you should discountenance those who (not to make benefit to themselves but to serve their Country) are willing to venture their lives and to purchase to themselves the displeasure of bad men that they may do a Public benefit I undertake not to justify all Captain Margery's actions but his own con_science knows whether he hath taken the horses of any but Malignants and it were somewhat too hard to put it upon the consciences of your fellow Deputy Lieutenants whether they have not freed the horses of known Malignants? A fault not less considering the sad estate of this Kingdom than to take a horse from a known Honest man the offence being against the Public which is a considerable aggravation! I know not the measures everyone takes of Malignants I think it is not fit Captain Margery should be the judge but if he in his taking of horses hath ob_served the plain character of a Malignant and cannot be charged for one horse otherwise taken it had been better that some of the bitterness wherewith he and his have been followed had been spared! The horses that his Cornet Boulry took he will put him_self upon that issue for them all If these men be accounted troublesome to the Country I shall be glad you would send them all to me I'll bid them welcome And when they have fought for you and endured some other difficulties of war which your honester men will hardly bear I pray you then let them go for honest men! I protest unto you many of those men which are of your Countrey's choosing under Captain Johnson are so far from serving you that were it not that I have honest Troops to master them although they be well paid yet they are so mutinous that I may justly fear they would cut my throat! Gentlemen it may be it provokes some spirits to see such plain men made Captains of Horse It had been well that men of hon_our and birth had entered into these employments but why do they not appear? Who would have hindered them? But seeing it was necessary the work must go on better plain men than none but best to have men patient of wants faithful and conscientious in their employment And such I hope these will approve themselves to be Let them therefore if I be thought worthy of any favour leave your Country with your good wishes and a blessing I am confident they will be well bestowed And I believe before it be long you will be in their debt and then it will not be hard to quit scores What arms you can furnish them withal I beseech you do it I have hitherto found your kindness great to me I know not what I have done to lose it I love it so well and price it so high that I would do my best to gain more You have the assured affec_tion of Your most humble and faithful servant OLIVER CROMWELL P S I understand there were some exceptions taken at a horse that was sent to me which was seized out of the hands of one Mr Goldsmith of Wilby If he be not by you judged a Malignant and that you do not approve of my having of the Horse I shall as willingly return him again as you shall desire And therefore I pray you signify your pleasure to me here_in under your hands Not that I would for ten thou_sand horses have the Horse to my own private benefit saving to make use of him for the Public for I will most gladly return the value of him to the State If the gentleman stand clear in your judgments I beg it as a special favour that if the Gentleman be freely willing to let me have him for my money let him set his own price I shall very justly return him the money Or if he be unwilling to part with him but keeps him for his own pleasure be pleased to send me an answer thereof I shall instantly return him his Horse and do it with a great deal more satisfaction to myself than keep him Therfore I beg it of you to satisfy my desire in this last request it shall exceedingly oblige me to you If you do it not I shall rest very unsatisfied and the Horse will be a burden to me so long as I shall keep him 
