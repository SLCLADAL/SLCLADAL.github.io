My most kind and loving brother I heartily recommend me unto you Pleaseth it your grace to understand that my lord the king hath instantly desired me to write unto you that it would please you for his sake and mine to send unto my lord Darcy to deliver Francois Descars upon a reasonable ransom unto you and that it would please your grace to pay his ransom for the time and that he might be delivered unto your grace you shortly to have the money again after that word is of his deliverance or else he not to return as hither Furthermore the duke of Bretagne otherwise called the dauphin hath divers seasons moved me to write to your grace for the said Francois forasmuch as he is one of his servants the which to do I made him promise and to the duke of Longuevilee also for I assure your grace they made me and the noblemen of my company great cheer from Bologne forth as the duke of Norfolk the lord marquis with other noble men can inform your grace These premises considered I beseech your grace to desire the lord Darcy to deliver upon as little a ransom as reasonably may be his said prisoner for as I am credibly informed here he is but a poor gentleman Now somewhat I would that my lord the king (and) the both dukes to whom I am much bound should think he should be the more favoured for my sake When this man is de livered I beseech you to send word by the bringer of this or some other what his ransom is which I pray God may be reasonable and little who preserve your grace Amen From Abbeville the 18th day of October by your very loving sister MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE To my most kind and loving brother the king's grace of England
