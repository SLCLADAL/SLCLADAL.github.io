I understand that you have lately released some persons committed by Major Ireton and Captain Husband and one committed by Captain Castle all 'committed' upon clear and necessary grounds as they are represented unto me 'grounds' rendering them as very enemies as any we have and as much requi_ring to have them continued secured I have given order to Captain Husband to see them recommitted to the hands of my Marshal Richard White And I much desire you for the future not to entrench upon me so much as to release them or any committed in the like case by myself or my De_puty and Commanders in the Garrison until myself or some Superior Authority be satisfied in the cause and do give order in allowance of their enlargement For I profess I will be no Goveror nor engage any other under me to undertake such a charge upon such weak terms! I am so sensible of the need we have to improve the present opportunity of our being masters of the field and having no Enemy near the Isle and to spare whatever charge we can towards the making of those Fortifications which may render it more defensible hereafter if we shall have more need I shall desire you for that end to ease the Isle and Treasury from the superfluous charge of 'having' Two several Com_mittees for the several parts of the Isle and that one Committee settled at March may serve for the whole Isle Wherefore I wish that one of your number may in your courses intend and appear at that Com_mittee to manage and uphold it the better for all parts of the Isle Resting upon your care herein I remain Your friend to serve you OLIVER CROMWELL 
