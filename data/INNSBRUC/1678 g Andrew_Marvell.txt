Gentlemen my very worthy friends The house of Commons not having the Chancellor's Speech that day printed or written sate (I meane yesterday) not long nor did much worke The Bill for incouragement of the woollen manufacture which was in progresse last Session was read the first time They also appointed a Committee to bring in a Bill or Bills to hinder the growth of Popery Also a Committee to inspect the Laws concerning the Poore in order to rectify them Severall things of the like publick and good intention were set on foot againe which I shall be glad to see come to perfection To day (which was intended though not ordered for consideration of his Majestyes and the Chancelors speech) but the morning being most part spent before the Speeches were published there was a Motion made for an humble Addresse to his Majesty to know of him the State of Affairs as they now stand in relation to War or Peace and that if his Majesty shall thinke fit to enter into a Warre with the French King with the Assistance of the Emperour and such other Princes and States as shall come into the Confederacy this House will support and assist his Majesty in the carrying on the Warre This debate tooke up the whole day forasmuch as some counted this Adresse to be unseasonable when it appeard that all things abroad were so disposed toward a Peace Some thought it more requisite to proceed first of all to the disbanding of the Army others that it were best to lay by all apprehensions and jealousyes & to furnish the King with mony leaving the rest to his M tyes discretion In this variety of opinions the House came about foure a clock to a Question of Adjourning the Debate w ch was carryed in the Affirmatiue by 195 against 176 In generall what I learne by information both within and without doors is that both Holland & Spaine appeare to be agreed upon termes with France I have inclosed the Speeches I remaine Gentlemen &c Your most affectionate servant Andr Marvell
