My very good lord With all my heart I commend me unto you I understand that it hath pleased the king my brother to promote doctor West being here one of his ambassadors to the bishoprick of Ely whereof I am right glad By reason of which promotion he must depart with divers of his benefices among which he hath two one called Egglesfield in the bishopric of Durham and the other the archdaeconry of Derby which (as I am informed) be of no great value Beseeching you my lord at mine instance and for my sake to be so good lord unto my ser vant John Palgrave master of art which hath done unto me right good and acceptable service to his and his friends' great charge and on my part as yet hitherto unremembered as by your good wisdom and provision to find the means that he may have one of the said benefices Heartily praying you and trusting that you will do it with effect and to re scribe unto me your good will done therein And thus the Holy Ghost preserve you From Paris the third day of April MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE To my lord of York
