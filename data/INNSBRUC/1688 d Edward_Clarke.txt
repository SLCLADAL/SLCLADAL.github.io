Dear Sir Your kind letter of the 17th has been now a full week in my hands for which you had immediately received my thanks had I been able to write But soon after my last of the 16th from Salisbury to you I was taken ill of an ague with an ill fever that attended it which so much weakened me that it was not without great difficulty I got hither but by use of the Cortex Peruv I thank God I am now able to tell you that I am at present free from both and do hope shall continue so but am not in condition to go abroad to dispatch the business I came into the country for which you may imagine (my circumstances considered) is no small disappointment and trouble to me You have exceedingly obliged my gardener by your junkills and the large nasturtium indicum seed you have sent him which we hear are safely arrived at Topsom by Spicer and I hope some time the next week to get them safe hither The lime_tree seeds and the turnip seeds you mention will be no less acceptable when they come but I hear nothing as yet of their arrival I am entirely satisfied in every article of yours and Mr F 's accompts and do not doubt but Mr Percival will make punctual payment of the bill that is drawn on him for L110 17s 11d mentioned in your letter But I have neither strength nor time to thank my good friend Benjamin Furly as I ought either for his great kindness to me whilst I was in Holland or the extra_ordinary care and trouble he hath taken for me since And there_fore I beg you to make him sensible of my hearty acknowledg_ments and earnest hopes that I may some time or other be happy in an opportunity to serve him And I heartily thank you for opening the complimentary letter you mention that was directed to me And I wish you had done the like by the other also for I cannot guess at the hand by that part of the super_scription you sent me Therfore pray open that also and in your next let me know the contents of it if material and by whom it was written And with mine and madam's true love and service to you and all the good family with you I subscribe though perfectly tired yet your most affectionate friend and obliged servant E {Clarke September the 30th Miss Betty adds her service to you and all her younger gallants etc
