Pleaseth it your grace to my greatest discomfort sorrow and disconsolation but lately I have been advertised of the great and high displeasure which your highness beareth unto me and my lord of Suffolk for the marriage between us Sire I will not in any wise deny but that I have offended your grace for the which I do put myself most humbly in your clemency and mercy Nevertheless to the intent that your highness should not think that I had simply carnally or of any sensual appetite done the same I having no regard to fall in your grace's displeasure I assure your grace that I had never done against your ordinance and consent but by the reason of the great despair wherein I was put by the two friars which hath certified me in case I come to England your council would never consent to the marriage between the said lord and me with many other sayings con cerning the same promise so that I verily thought that the said friars would never have offered to have made me like overture unless they might have had charge from some of your council the which put me in such consternation fear and doubt of the obtaining of the thing which I desired most in this world that I rather chose to put me in your mercy accomplishing the marriage than to put me in the order of your council knowing them to be other ways Suffolk in choice whether he would accomplish the marriage within four days or else that he should never have enjoyed me whereby I know well that I constrained him to break such promises as he made your grace as well for fear of losing of me as also that I ascertained him that by their consent I would never come into England And now that your grace knoweth the both offences of the which I have been the only occasion I most humbly and as your most sorrowful sister requiring you to have compassion upon us both and to pardon our offences and that it will please your grace to write to me and to my lord of Suffolk some comfortable words for it should be greatest comfort for us both By your loving and most humble sister MARY To the King's grace
