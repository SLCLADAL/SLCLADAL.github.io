My honourable and good Lord I have received your letter even as I was weighing to go out and for the first part I am most heartily to give your Lordship thanks for your honourable favour I will acknowledge it with all my love and ready to do you any service For Mr Hawkyns' bargain he is presently to repair to the Court where he shall be best able to answer in his own defence but this much I will say to your Lordship I have been aboard of every ship that goeth out with me and in every place where any may creep and I do thank God that they be in the estate they be in and there is never a one of them that knows what a leak means I have known when an Admiral of England hath gone out and two ships in fleet could not say so There is none that goeth out now but I durst go to the Rio de la Plata in her and yet the Mary Rose and the Swallow be with me who were ships in the King's Majesty's her father's time And therefore I dare presume greatly that those that have been made in her Majesty's time be very good and serviceable and shall prove them arrant liars that have reported the contrary And I thank God her Majesty I hope may be well assured of their goodness yet every thing hath his time and must be helped as need requireth My Lord I had no meaning to carry away all the officers I have none with me but Sir W Wynter I leave Mr Hawkyns and Mr Borough behind to wait on your Lordship and to put the four great ships in readiness which we shall greatly need if the Spanish forces come out And so my Lord having no more leisure to write at large being under sail I bid your Lordship most heartily farewell the 21st of February at 12 o'clock the afternoon Your Lordship's most assured to command C HOWARD
