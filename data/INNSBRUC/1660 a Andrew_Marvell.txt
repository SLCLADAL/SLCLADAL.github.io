Gentlemen my worthy friends Although during the necessary absence of my partner M r Ramsden I write but with halfe a penn and can scarce perswade myselfe to send you so imperfect an account of your own and the publick affairs as I needs must for want of his assistance yet I had rather expose mine own defects to your good interpretation then excuse thereby a totall neglect of my duty and that trust which is divided upon me At my late absence out of Town I had taken such order that if you had commanded me any thing I might soon have received it and so returned on purpose to this place to have obeyed you But hearing nothing of that nature however I was present the first day of the Parliaments sitting and tooke care to write to M r Maior what work we had cut out Since when we have had litle new but onely been making a progresse in those things I then mentioned There is yet brought in an Act in which of all others your corporation is the least concerned that is where wives shall refuse to cohabit with their husbands that in such case the husband shall not be liable to pay any debts which she shall run into for clothing diet lodging or other expenses I wish with all my heart you were no more touched in a vote that we have made for bringing in an Act of a new Assessment for six moneths of 70000 li per mensem to begin next January The truth is the delay ere monyes can be got in eats up a great part of all that is levying and that growing charge of the Army and Navy doubles upon us And that is all that can be said for excuse of our selves to the Country to whom we had giuen our own hopes of no further Sessment to be raised but must now needs incurre the censure of improvidence before or prodigality now though it becomes no private member the resolution having passed the house to interpose further his own judgement in a thing that can not be remedied and it will be each mans ingenuity not to grudge an after payment for that settlement and freedome from Armyes & Navyes w ch before he would have been glad to purchase with his whole fortune There remain some eight Regiments to be disbanded but those all horse in a manner and some seauenteen shipps to be payd of that have laid so long upon charge in the harbour beside fourscore shipps w ch are reckoned to us for this winter guard But after that all things are to go upon his Majestyes own purse out of the Tunnage & Poundage & his other revenues But there being so great a provision made for mony I doubt not but ere we rise to see the whole army disbanded and according to the Act hope to see your Town once more ungarrisond in w ch I should be glad and happy to be instrumentall to the uttermost For I can not but remember though then a child those blessed days when the youth of your own town were trained for your militia and did methought become their arms much better then any soldiers that I have seen there since And it will not be amisse if you please (now that we are about a new Act of regulating the Militia that it may be as a standing strength but not as ill as a perpetuall Army to the Nation) to signify to me any thing in that matter that were according to your ancient custome & desirable for you For though I can promise litle yet I intend all things for your service The Act for review of the Poll bill proceeds & that for making this declaration of his Majesty a Law in religious matters Order likewise is given for drawing up all the votes made during our last sitting in the businesse of Sales of Bishops and Deans and Chapters lands into an Act w ch I should be glad to see passd The purchasers the other day offerd the house 600000 li in ready mony & to make the Bishops &c revenue as good or better then before But the House thought it not fit or seasonable to hearken to it We are so much the more concernd to see that great interest of the purchasers satisfyed & quieted at least in that way which our own votes have propounded On Munday next we are to return to the consideration of apportioning 100000 li p ann~ upon all the lands in the nation in lieu of the Court of Wards The debate among the Countyes each thinking it selfe over rated makes the successe of that businesse somthing casuall & truly I shall not assist it much for my part for it is litle reason that your Town should contribute in that charge The Excise bill for longer continuance (I wish it prove not too long) will come in also next weeke And I foresee we shall be called upon shortly to effect our vote made the former sitting of raising his Majesties revenue to 1200000 li per Annum I do not love to write so much of this mony news But I thinke you have observed that Parliaments have been always made use of to that purpose and though we may buy gold too deare yet we must at any rate be glad of Peace Freedome & a good Conscience M r Maior tells me your duplicates of the Poll are coming up I shall go with them to the Exchequer & make your excuse if any be requisite My long silence hath made me now tres_passe on the other hand in a long letter but I doubt not of your good construction of so much familiarity and trouble from Gentlemen Your most affectionate friend & servant Andr Marvell Westminster Nov 17 1660
