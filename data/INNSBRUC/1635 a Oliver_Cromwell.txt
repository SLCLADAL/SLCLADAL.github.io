To my very loving friend Mr Storie at the Sign of the Dog in the Royal Exchange London Deliver these MR STORIE St Ives 11th January 1635 Amongst the catalogue of those good works which your fellow citizens and our countrymen have done this will not be reckoned for the least That they have provided for the feeding of souls Building of hos_pitals provides for men's bodies to build material temples is judged a work of piety but they that pro_cure spiritual food they that build up spiritual temples they are the men truly charitable truly pious Such a work as this was your erecting the Lecture in our Country in the which you placed Dr Wells a man of goodness and industry and ability to do good every way not short of any I know in England and I am persuaded that sithence his coming the Lord hath by him wrought much good among us It only remains how that He who first moved you to this put you forward in the continuance thereof it was the Lord and therefore to Him lift we up our hearts that He would perfect it And surely Mr Storie it were a piteous thing to see a Lecture fall in the hands of so many able and godly men as I am per_suaded the founders of this are in these times wherein we see they are suppressed with too much haste and violence by the enemies of God his Truth Far be it that so much guilt should stick to your hands who live in a City so renowned for the clear shining light of the Gospel You know Mr Storie to withdraw the pay is to let fall the Lecture for who goeth to warfare at his own cost? I beseech you therefore in the bowels of Jesus Christ put it forward and let the good man have his pay The souls of God's children will bless you for it and so shall I and ever rest Your loving Friend in the Lord OLIVER CROMWELL Commend my hearty love to Mr Busse Mr Beadly and my other good friends I would have written to Mr Busse but I was loath to trouble him with a long letter and I feared I should not receive an answer from him from you I expect one so soon as conveniently you may Vale 
