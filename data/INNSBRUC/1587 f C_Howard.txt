Sir I had forgotten in my last letter to answer the matter you did write in touching Captain Morgan my man If he had been here I would have sent him unto you but he is extreme sick at London and as I do understand in some danger which I am very sorry for for he is a tall gentle man He hath the charge of all my soldiers in my ship and hath done his duty very well I hope he will answer all honestly and well Sir if the Commissioners be once gone over and that there be a surcease of arms it shall be but folly and to no purpose for me to lie here I think both I and the noblemen leaving sufficient lieu tenants in our ships and the officers as Sir W Wynter Mr Hawkyns and Mr Borough remain here with the navy will be sufficient for before these ships can have their full number of men again it will be a month to gather them do what we can And I pray to God we have them when we shall need for many are gone abroad and specially the chiefest men God send me to see such a company together again when need is I protest it before God I write not this to you because I am weary with being here for if it were not for her Majesty's presence I had rather live in the company of these noble ships than in any place And yet would I be glad that there were something to do I am more sorrier for the noblemen than any ways for myself for I would have them save to spend when need shall be I do assure you they live here bountifully and it will be hard finding of such noblemen as these be so well affected to this service and that will love the sea so well as they do Sir if you think that my continuing here with the navy serve to good purpose I shall like well of it but methinks if there be a surcease of arms then my lying here will make a jest to many and they have reason I think it will be a most fittest time to ground our ships in for now at our coming out it was you know on such a sudden as we could not ground but two or three of the middle sort so as the great ships were not grounded I have with the advice of the officers and masters thought good to begin with some the next spring and so in a three springs dispatch them all and have them all in most excellent order by the midst of March all save the men and I doubt not but the ships shall prove some notable liars and if cause fall out do a better day of service for England than ever ships did for it yet But this assure yourself if the forces of Spain do come before the midst of April there will be as much ado to have men to furnish us as ever was but men must have or else the ships will do no good God knows it is but a bare sight to see us now to that it was and I would not wish any to take the pains to come to see us till we are newly sup plied when cause shall be Sir God send you well to do and continuance of your health and so I bid you most heartily farewell From aboard her Majesty's good ship the Bear the 28th of January Your assured loving friend C HOWARD
