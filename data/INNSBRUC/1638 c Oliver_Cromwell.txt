To my beloved Cousin Mrs St John at Sir William Masham his House called Otes in Essex Present these DEAR COUSIN Ely 13th October 1638 I thankfully acknowledge your love in your kind remembrance of me upon this opportunity Alas you do too highly prize my lines and my company I may be ashamed to own your expressions considering how un_profitable I am and the mean improvement of my talent Yet to honour my God by declaring what He hath done for my soul in this I am confident and I will be so Truly then this I find That He giveth springs in a dry barren wilderness where no water is I live you know where in Meshec which they say signi_fies Prolonging in Kedar which signifies Blackness yet the Lord forsaketh me not Though He do prolong yet He will I trust bring me to His tabernacel to His resting place My soul is with the Congregation of the Firstborn my body rests in hope and if here I may honour my God either by doing or by suffering I shall be most glad Truly no poor creature hath more cause to put him_self forth in the cause of his God than I I have had plentiful wages beforehand and I am sure I shall ne_ver earn the least mite The Lord accept me in His Son and give me to walk in the light and give us to walk in the light as He is the light! He it is that enlighteneth our blackness our darkness I dare not say He hideth His face from me He giveth me to see light in His light One beam in a dark place hath exceeding much refreshment in it blessed be His Name for shining upon so dark a heart as mine! You know what my manner of life hath been Oh I lived in and loved darkness and hated light I was a chief the chief of sinners This is true I hated godliness yet God had mercy on me O the riches of His mercy! Praise Him for me pray for me that He who hath begun a good work would perfect it in the day of Christ Salute all my friends in that Family whereof you are yet a member I am much bound unto them for their love I bless the Lord for them and that my Son by their procurement is so well Let him have your prayers your counsel let me have them Salute your Husband and Sister from me He is not a man of his word! He promised to write about Mr Wrath of Epping but as yet I receive no letters put him in mind to do what with conveniency may be done for the poor Cousin I did solicit him about Once more farewell The Lord be with you so prayeth Your truly loving Cousin OLIVER CROMWELL 
