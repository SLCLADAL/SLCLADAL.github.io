Then said Sir Hughe Conway to hym agayn I pray you souffer me to tell forthe my talle for I amnot yet athe ynd Ye have in mynde wat that I have shewed you touchyng this matris Of my fayth in lyke wyse sythens my comyng I have shewed the same to Sir Nycholas Voux lieutenant of Gysnes and to Sir Antony Broune lieutenant of the castell here and they answeryd me both this that they had to good holdes to resorte unto the whiche thay seid sholdbe sure to make their paxce ho so ever the worlde tourne  Then my master youre depute and master porter boyth said to hym that he could no lase doo but shew thes matres unto youre hyghnes He said that Hyt ware good that the kyngis grace knew thees sayyngis but asyet I have not shewed hym no part heroff nother never I wildo  Then said master porter to hym angrely and sware by Godis precious soule he be the more to blame to kepe suche matris from his hygnes and in lyke wyse said my master your depute and all we beyyng there Item after many wordis spoken touchyng the same Sir Hughe Conway said Yf ye knew kynge Harry oure master as I doo ye woldbe ware how that ye brake to hym in ony suche matres for he wold take yt to be said but of envy yll wille and malis Then should anion have blame and no thanke for his trouth and good mynd and that have I welle proved here to fore in lyke causes for that tyme that the lord Lovell lay in Colchester a trysty frend of myn came to me and shewed me in councell the day and tyme of hys departyng and of alle hys purpos I was sworen to hym that I should never utter thys to man lyvyng to hys hurte butt yet forthwith after wardis by cause of my alegens I came to Sir Raynold Bray and shewed hym all as is abovwe and forthwith he said that Master Bray shewed the same unto the kyngis Wheruppon I was brought byfore hys hygnes and I affirmed all to be true as my seid frend hade shewed and the kynge said that hyt could not be so and resoned with me alwayes to the contrary of my said sayynges At last he asked what he was that told me thus tale of hys departyng I prayed hys hygnes to pardon me for I said that I was sworen to hym that I should never utter hym to be drawen with wyld horsses wherewith the kynge was angry and displesed with me for my good wille I shall no more tempt hym wile I lyve in suche causes  Then said master porter I thynk that ye drast never speke thees wordes to the kyngis grace as ye have rehersed them now here  and he sware my grett othes that he dyde Item my master youre deputie said that I knowell that the kyngis hyghnes is harde of credens in suche matres and that knowe ye  he said master porter aswell as I for how longe was yt er hys grace and hys councell wold belyve ony thyng of untrothe to be in Sir Jame Tyrell and some said I dyd seke to do hym hurte for malis  Item a nodre tyme I dyd wryt unto hys hygnes that oone hade shewed me that Sir Robert Clyfford should say here in his toune to a lady that Perken Warbeke was kynge Edwardes sone Never wordes went coldre to my hart then they dyd Hys hygnes sent me sharpe wrytyng agay that he wold have the prouffe of this matier I hade no wittnes then but my sylfe but as hyt hapned afterwardes I caused hym by good crafte to confesse the same he had said to me be fore hym that was marshell here at that tyme and els I hade lykly to be putt to a grett plonge for my trothe At the last al thought that hit was not to shewe this to youre grace without better proffe yet master porter said yt was grett pitty that the kinge dyd not tryst hys true knyghtes better and to geve them credens in suche thynges as they should shew for hys surtie for grett hurt may come by that mene  Item after this the treserer said Master depute and master porter what daunger be we in now remem bryng all thynges welle for we have no suche holdes to resort unto as thees other men have consydryng also oure many enymies that we have in this toune and els where that wilbe glade to distroy and murdre us all yf other should come to the kyngis grace then wele And for trothe I knowell that he cannot longe con tynu for hyt is wryten of hym that he shall no longer raygne then dyd kynge Edward wiche he said was byt xxij=te= yere and lytle more  Then said my master youre depute I by sherwe hys hart that so dyde wryte and also I pray god send all them that thynk the same tobe true a shorte shamfull dethe  The treserer said agayn We may not be angry in this matris when we shall comyn for the surtie of our sylfes aswell as of this the kyngis toune for I thynk not veryly thus to be all true that I have said but I knowell that every man ys mortall and must dij and that that I have said I shall shew you my boke that shall declare you the same playnly to be as I have said and spoken  Master porter said Then I pray you master tresere brene that boke and a vayngens take the first wryter  Item then said my master youre depute to master Convaye I pray you leve thys profyciyng of the kynge for ye speke of thynges that I
