B01 0010  1    #ASSEMBLY SESSION BROUGHT MUCH GOOD#
B01 0010  6    The General Assembly, which adjourns today, has performed
B01 0020  5    in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day
B01 0030  4    it convened. It was faced immediately with a showdown
B01 0040  1    on the schools, an issue which was met squarely in
B01 0040 11    conjunction with the governor with a decision not to
B01 0050  7    risk abandoning public education.
B01 0060  1       There followed the historic appropriations and budget
B01 0060  8    fight, in which the General Assembly decided to tackle
B01 0070  8    executive powers. The final decision went to the executive
B01 0080  7    but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting
B01 0090  2    procedures and to provide legislators information they
B01 0100  2    need.
B01 0100  3       Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance
B01 0110  1    them have become musts if the state in the next few
B01 0110 12    years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government. This
B01 0120  6    session, for instance, may have insured a financial
B01 0140  3    crisis two years from now.
B01 0140  8       In all the turmoil, some good legislation was passed.
B01 0150  6    Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and
B01 0160  5    await future action. Certainly all can applaud passage
B01 0170  1    of an auto title law, the school bills, the increase
B01 0170 11    in teacher pensions, the ban on drag racing, acceptance
B01 0180  8    by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state
B01 0190  5    roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside
B01 0200  3    city limits, repeal of the college age limit law and
B01 0200 13    the road maintenance bond issue.
B01 0210  5       No action has been taken, however, on such major
B01 0220  4    problems as ending the fee system, penal reform, modification
B01 0230  1    of the county unit system and in outright banning of
B01 0230 11    fireworks sales. Only a token start was made in attacking
B01 0240 10    the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue
B01 0250  6    of attracting industry to the state.
B01 0260  1       The legislature expended most of its time on the
B01 0260 10    schools and appropriations questions. Fortunately it
B01 0270  4    spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions
B01 0280  4    which in the past have made Georgia look like anything
B01 0290  2    but "the empire state of the South".
B01 0290  9       We congratulate the entire membership on its record
B01 0300  7    of good legislation. In the interim between now and
B01 0310  5    next year, we trust the House and Senate will put their
B01 0320  3    minds to studying Georgia's very real economic, fiscal
B01 0330  1    and social problems and come up with answers without
B01 0330 10    all the political heroics. @
B01 0340  3    #LEAGUE REGULARLY STANDS ON THE SIDE OF RIGHT#
B01 0340 11    The League of Women Voters, 40 now and admitting it
B01 0350 10    proudly, is inviting financial contributions in the
B01 0360  5    windup of its fund drive. It's a good use of money.
B01 0370  5       These women whose organization grew out of the old
B01 0380  3    suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's
B01 0380 10    dictum that one must cherish the people's spirit but
B01 0390  9    "Keep alive their attention".
B01 0400  2       "If once they become inattentive to the public affairs",
B01 0410  2    Jefferson said, "you and I, and Congress and assemblies,
B01 0420  1    judges and governors, shall all become wolves".
B01 0420  8       Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware
B01 0430  6    of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the
B01 0440  5    league gives to public affairs. The league workers
B01 0450  2    search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues
B01 0450 13    and make them available to the public. The harder the
B01 0460 10    choice, the more willing the league is to wade in.
B01 0470  7    And the league takes a stand, with great regularity,
B01 0480  2    on the side of right. @
B01 0480  8    #LOOK TO COOSA VALLEY FOR INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS#
B01 0490  3    Cities and counties interested in industrial development
B01 0500  2    would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes
B01 0500 13    peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that
B01 0510  4    are members of the Coosa Valley Area Planning and Development
B01 0520  6    Commission.
B01 0520  7       Coupling its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000
B01 0530  9    state grant authorized by Gov& Vandiver, the group
B01 0540  5    expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech&.
B01 0550  3    Then a full-time planning office will be established
B01 0560  1    in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research
B01 0560 12    staff for development of an area planning and industrial
B01 0570  9    development program.
B01 0580  1       The undertaking has abundant promise. It recognizes
B01 0580  8    the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors
B01 0590  9    and that by banding together in an area-wide effort
B01 0600  7    better results can be accomplished than through the
B01 0610  3    go-it-alone approach. @
B01 0610  8    #RUSK IDEA STRENGTHENS UNITED STATES DEFENSE#
B01 0620  3    The Rusk belief in balanced defense, replacing the
B01 0640  1    Dulles theory of massive retaliation, removes a grave
B01 0640  9    danger that has existed.
B01 0650  3       The danger lay not in believing that our own ~A-bombs
B01 0660  1    would deter Russia's use of hers; that theory was and
B01 0660 11    is sound. The danger lay in the American delusion that
B01 0670 10    nuclear deterrence was enough.
B01 0680  3       By limiting American strength too much to nuclear
B01 0690  1    strength, this country limited its ability to fight
B01 0690  9    any kind of war besides a nuclear war. This strategy
B01 0700  7    heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear
B01 0710  6    war.
B01 0710  7       It also weakened our diplomatic stance, because
B01 0720  3    Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear
B01 0730  1    war except in the ultimate extremity.
B01 0730  7       This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start
B01 0740  6    low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity.
B01 0750  2       By maintaining the nuclear deterrent, but gearing
B01 0760  1    American military forces to fight conventional wars
B01 0760  8    too, Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear
B01 0770  8    brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety
B01 0780  5    into our military position. @
B01 0790  1    #DEKALB BUDGET SHOWS COUNTY IS ON BEAM#
B01 0800  6    DeKalb's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries
B01 0810  4    with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.
B01 0820  1       It includes a raise in the county minimum wage,
B01 0820 10    creation of several new jobs at the executive level,
B01 0830  9    financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts,
B01 0840  4    and increased expenditures for essential services such
B01 0850  3    as health and welfare, fire protection, sanitation
B01 0850 10    and road maintenance.
B01 0860  3       That such expansion can be obtained without a raise
B01 0870  3    in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound
B01 0870 15    fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners,
B01 0880 10    headed by Chairman Charles O& Emmerich who is demonstrating
B01 0890  7    that the public trust he was given was well placed,
B01 0900  7    and other county officials. @

B01 0910  7    G& Mennen Williams is learning the difficulties of
B01 0920  4    diplomacy rapidly. Touring Africa, the new U&S& assistant
B01 0930  3    secretary of state observed "Africa should be for the
B01 0940  3    Africans" and the British promptly denounced him. Then
B01 0940 11    he arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying
B01 0950  8    signs saying "American imperialists, go home". Chin

B01 0960  8    #POWER COMPANY BACKS CONFIDENCE WITH DOLLARS#
B01 0970  5    Confidence in the state's economic future is reflected
B01 0980  4    in the Georgia Power Company's record construction
B01 0990  1    budget for this year.
B01 0990  5       The firm does a large amount of research and its
B01 1000  4    forecasts have meaning. It is good to know that Georgia
B01 1010  1    will continue to have sufficient electrical power not
B01 1010  9    only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage
B01 1020  9    a more rapid rate of industrialization.
B01 1040  1       Georgia's mental health program received a badly
B01 1040  8    needed boost from the General Assembly in the form
B01 1050  8    of a $1,750,000 budget increase for the Milledgeville
B01 1060  4    State Hospital.
B01 1060  6       Actually it amounts to $1,250,000 above what the
B01 1070  6    institution already is receiving, considering the additional
B01 1080  3    half-million dollars Gov& Vandiver allocated last year
B01 1090  3    from the state surplus.
B01 1090  7       Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money
B01 1100  6    and is. But exactly how far it will go toward improving
B01 1110  2    conditions is another question because there is so
B01 1110 10    much that needs doing.
B01 1120  3       The practice of charging employes for meals whether
B01 1130  1    they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished.
B01 1130 11    The work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours
B01 1140  9    and more per week should be reduced.
B01 1150  2       More attendants, nurses and doctors should be hired.
B01 1160  1    Patients deserve more attention than they are getting.
B01 1160  9       Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal
B01 1170  9    year, Georgia will be spending only around $3.15 per
B01 1180  5    day per patient. The national average is more than
B01 1190  3    $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the
B01 1190 13    mental health field to be too low. Kansas, regarded
B01 1200  9    as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally
B01 1210  6    ill, spends $9 per day per patient.
B01 1220  1       Georgia has made some reforms, true. The intensive
B01 1220  9    treatment program is working well. But in so many other
B01 1230  9    areas we still are dragging.
B01 1240  1       Considering what is being done compared to what
B01 1240  9    needs to be done, it behooves the hospital management
B01 1250  7    to do some mighty careful planning toward making the
B01 1260  4    best possible use of the increase granted. The boost
B01 1270  2    is helpful but inadequate.- @
B01 1280  1    #THE END OF TRUJILLO#
B01 1280  5    Assassination, even of a tyrant, is repulsive to men
B01 1290  3    of good conscience. Rafael Trujillo, the often-blood
B01 1290 11    thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years,
B01 1300  9    perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal
B01 1310  8    of history. But whether the murder of El Benefactor
B01 1320  4    in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of
B01 1330  2    the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now
B01 1330 11    be answered.
B01 1340  1       Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination.
B01 1340  8    The responsibility for scores of deaths, including
B01 1350  6    the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez, a
B01 1360  4    professor at Columbia University in New York, has been
B01 1370  3    laid at his door. He had been involved in countless
B01 1370 13    schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring
B01 1380  9    countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela.
B01 1390  7    It was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of
B01 1400  7    his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan
B01 1410  3    government, reportedly involving the use of Dominican
B01 1420  1    arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez,
B01 1420  9    has been uncovered and quashed.
B01 1430  5       The recent history of the Dominican Republic is
B01 1440  3    an almost classical study of the way in which even
B01 1440 13    a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become
B01 1450  6    oppressive. Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things
B01 1460  6    for his country: he improved public facilities such
B01 1470  4    as roads and sanitation, attracted industry and investment
B01 1480  2    and raised the standard of living notably. But the
B01 1480 11    price was the silence of the grave for all criticism
B01 1490 10    or opposition.
B01 1500  1       El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth.
B01 1500  9    The jails were filled to overflowing with political
B01 1510  6    prisoners who had incurred his displeasure. He maintained
B01 1520  4    amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere
B01 1530  3    which sycophantically chanted his praise, and his influence
B01 1540  2    extended even to Congress.
B01 1540  6       Until the last year or so the profession of friendship
B01 1550  5    with the United States had been an article of faith
B01 1560  3    with Trujillo, and altogether too often this profession
B01 1570  1    was accepted here as evidence of his good character.
B01 1570 10    Tardily the Government here came to understand how
B01 1590  5    this country's own reputation was tarnished by the
B01 1600  4    association with repression. Last year, after Trujillo
B01 1610  1    had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean,
B01 1610 10    the United States and many other members of the Organization
B01 1620 10    of American States broke diplomatic relations with
B01 1630  6    him.
B01 1630  7       Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny
B01 1640  5    knows no ideological confines. Trujillo's dictatorship
B01 1650  2    had been along conservative, right-wing lines. But
B01 1660  1    after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing
B01 1660 10    Communist slogans. There was considerable evidence
B01 1670  6    of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba, previously
B01 1680  5    a bete noire to Trujillo- thus illustrating the way
B01 1690  4    in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.
B01 1700  1       What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle. The
B01 1710  1    Dominican people have known no democratic institutions
B01 1710  8    and precious little freedom for a generation, and all
B01 1720  7    alternative leadership has been suppressed. Perhaps
B01 1730  3    the army will be able to maintain stability, but the
B01 1740  2    vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger.
B01 1740 10    The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type
B01 1750  7    authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom.
B01 1760  5    Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people,
B01 1770  4    who deserve to breathe without fear. For that reason
B01 1780  2    any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative
B01 1790  1    government to the Dominican Republic will need the
B01 1790  9    greatest sympathy and help.
B01 1800  3    #START ON RAPID TRANSIT#
B01 1800  7    High-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial
B01 1810  3    Parkway, operating between downtown Washington and
B01 1820  2    Cabin John, Glen Echo and Brookmont, would constitute
B01 1825  1    an alluring sample of what the new National Capital
B01 1830  9    Transportation Agency can do for this city. In presenting
B01 1840  8    plans for such express buses before the Montgomery
B01 1850  4    County Council, the administrator of the ~NCTA, C&
B01 1860  2    Darwin Stolzenbach, was frankly seeking support for
B01 1870  1    the projects his agency will soon be launching. Such
B01 1870 10    support should not be difficult to come by if all the
B01 1880 10    plans to be presented by the ~NCTA are as attractive
B01 1890  4    as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown
B01 1900  3    area.
B01 1900  4       Because the buses would not stop on the parkway,
B01 1910  2    land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby
B01 1910 11    will be needed. The ~NCTA is well advised to seek funds
B01 1920  9    for this purpose from the present session of Congress.
B02 0010  1    #MUST BERLIN REMAIN DIVIDED?#
B02 0010  5    The inference has been too widely accepted that because
B02 0020  4    the Communists have succeeded in building barricades
B02 0030  1    across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment
B02 0030 10    of that living city.
B02 0040  4       So far as the record is concerned, the Western powers
B02 0050  2    have not acquiesced and should not do so.
B02 0050 10       Though Walter Ulbricht, by grace of Soviet tanks,
B02 0060  7    may be head man in East Germany, that does not give
B02 0070  6    him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin
B02 0080  3    or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone.
B02 0100  1       The wartime protocol of September 12, 1944, designated
B02 0100  9    a special "Greater Berlin" area, comprising the entire
B02 0110  6    city, to be under joint occupation. It was not a part
B02 0120  7    of any one of the three (later four) zones for occupation
B02 0130  4    by Soviet, American, British, and French troops respectively.
B02 0140  2    After the Berlin blockade and airlift, the Council
B02 0150  1    of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose "to
B02 0150 10    mitigate the effects of the present administrative
B02 0160  6    division of Germany and of Berlin".
B02 0170  1       For some time the Communists honored the distinction
B02 0180  1    between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector
B02 0180 11    of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the
B02 0190  8    two areas. Then they moved offices of the East German
B02 0200  6    puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally
B02 0210  4    to treat it as the capital of East Germany.
B02 0220  1       That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West
B02 0220 11    Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western
B02 0230  6    governments appears in notes which Britain, France,
B02 0240  2    and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's
B02 0250  1    gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer
B02 0250  9    and other West German officials to West Berlin. The
B02 0260  8    Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had
B02 0270  7    in East Berlin- and was certainly less provocative
B02 0280  3    than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler.
B02 0290  2       The British and other replies to that Moscow note
B02 0300  1    pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities "to
B02 0300  9    integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating
B02 0310  7    it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital
B02 0320  6    of East Germany". They insisted on the "fundamental
B02 0330  3    fact" that "the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite
B02 0340  1    status".
B02 0340  2       This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those
B02 0350  2    efforts as an accomplished fact. There remains, of
B02 0350 10    course, the question of what the West can do beyond
B02 0360  9    diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from
B02 0370  5    becoming accomplished facts.
B02 0370  8       One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades
B02 0380  7    of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist
B02 0390  6    "vopos" try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents.
B02 0400  3    Another remained when an American Army car was recovered
B02 0410  2    but with a broken glass. The glass may seem trivial
B02 0410 12    but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents
B02 0420  7    unless they are redressed.
B02 0430  1       Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and
B02 0430 10    the West German misgivings about "salami" tactics,
B02 0440  7    it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay
B02 0450  6    to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative
B02 0460  2    will mark a stiffening of response not only to future
B02 0470  1    indignities and aggressions but also to some that have
B02 0470 10    passed.
B02 0480  1    #PRAIRIE NATIONAL PARK#
B02 0480  3    Thousands of buffalo ("bison" they will never be to
B02 0490  4    the man on the street) grazing like a mobile brown
B02 0490 14    throw-rug upon the rolling, dusty-green grassland.
B02 0500  7    A horizon even and seamless, binding the vast sun-bleached
B02 0510  6    dome of sky to earth.
B02 0510 11       That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly
B02 0520  9    fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest
B02 0530  7    of the American continent as any later cinema image
B02 0540  4    of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood.
B02 0550  1    For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken
B02 0550 11    and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a
B02 0560  9    whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that
B02 0570  5    was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and
B02 0580  3    Mississippi valleys began to fill.
B02 0580  8       The National Park Service now proposes to preserve
B02 0590  7    an area in Pottawatomie County, northeast Kansas, as
B02 0600  4    a "Prairie National Park". There the buffalo would
B02 0610  3    roam, to be seen as a tapestry, not as moth-eaten zoo
B02 0620  1    specimens. Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth
B02 0620 10    would be saved. Grasslands would extend, unfenced,
B02 0630  5    unplowed, unbroken by silo or barn- as the first settlers
B02 0640  7    saw them.
B02 0640  9       The Park Service makes an impressive ecological
B02 0650  4    and statistical case for creating this new park. American
B02 0660  2    history should clinch the case when Congress is asked
B02 0660 11    to approve.
B02 0670  2    #WHISKY ON THE AIR#
B02 0670  6    A Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the
B02 0680  3    customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising
B02 0690  1    on ~TV and radio. Starting with small stations not
B02 0690 10    members of the National Association of Broadcasters,
B02 0700  6    the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor
B02 0710  7    barriers in major-market stations.
B02 0720  1       Probably the best answer to this kind of entering
B02 0720 10    wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal
B02 0730  5    Communications Commission to ban such advertising through
B02 0740  6    its licensing power.
B02 0740  9       The National Association of Broadcasters code specifically
B02 0750  6    bars hard-liquor commercials. Past polls of public
B02 0760  6    opinion show popular favor for this policy. Even the
B02 0770  4    Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific
B02 0780  1    prohibition.
B02 0780  2       Why, then, with these voluntary barricades and some
B02 0790  2    state laws barring liquor ads, is it necessary to seek
B02 0790 12    congressional action? Simply because the subverting
B02 0800  6    action of firms that are not members of the Distilled
B02 0810  6    Spirits Institute and of radio and ~TV stations that
B02 0820  3    are not members of the ~NAB tends to spread.
B02 0830  1       Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless
B02 0830 10    will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise
B02 0840  9    they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code
B02 0850  7    competitors.
B02 0850  8       Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or
B02 0860  6    other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous
B02 0870  4    than the pseudo-sophistication with which ~TV soft-drinks
B02 0880  3    are downed or toothpaste applied, there is a sad difference
B02 0890  1    between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola
B02 0890  9    and gulling him into downing bourbon.
B02 0900  4       A law is needed.
B02 0900  8    #NEW YORK: DEMOCRATS' CHOICE#
B02 0910  2    Registered Democrats in New York City this year have
B02 0920  1    the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for
B02 0920  9    Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will
B02 0930  9    run their party organization.
B02 0940  1       In the central contest, that for Mayor, they may
B02 0940 10    have found some pertinent points in what each faction
B02 0950  8    has said about the other.
B02 0960  1       Mayor Robert F& Wagner must, as his opponents demand,
B02 0960 10    assume responsibility for his performance in office.
B02 0970  7    While all citizens share in blame for lax municipal
B02 0980  7    ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems
B02 0990  2    in the schools, law enforcement and fiscal policies.
B02 0990 10    The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against
B02 1000  9    his own record.
B02 1010  1       State Controller Arthur Levitt, on the other hand,
B02 1010  9    cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the
B02 1020  9    candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have
B02 1030  6    shown livelier interest in political power than in
B02 1040  2    the city's welfare. They, too, have links with the
B02 1040 11    city's ills.
B02 1050  2       Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited.
B02 1050 12    Mayor Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more
B02 1060  7    mercilessly exposed than those of Mr& Levitt who left
B02 1070  8    an impression of quiet competence in his more protected
B02 1080  5    state post.
B02 1080  7       As Mayor, Mr& Levitt might turn out to be more independent
B02 1090  8    than some of his leading supporters would like. His
B02 1100  4    election, on the other hand, would unquestionably strengthen
B02 1110  2    the "regulars".
B02 1110  4       Mr& Wagner might or might not be a "new" Mayor in
B02 1120  7    this third term, now that he is free of the pressure
B02 1130  3    of those party leaders whom he calls "bosses". These
B02 1140  1    are, of course, the same people whose support he has
B02 1140 11    only now rejected to seek the independent vote.
B02 1150  6       But his reelection would strengthen the liberal
B02 1160  3    Democrats and the labor unions who back him.
B02 1170  1       If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats
B02 1170 11    may wish, it nevertheless must be made. The vote still
B02 1180  9    gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government
B02 1190  7    and their party.
B02 1200  1    #LITTLE WAR, BIG TEST#
B02 1200  5    Both Mr& ~K's have so far continued to speak softly
B02 1210  4    and carry big sticks over Laos.
B02 1210 10       President Kennedy, already two quiet demands down,
B02 1220  7    still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering
B02 1230  5    a public ultimatum to Moscow. But at the same time
B02 1240  2    he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an
B02 1240 11    hour of the fighting. And Secretary Rusk, en route
B02 1250  7    to Bangkok, doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements
B02 1260  6    for the possible entry of Australian or Thai ~SEATO
B02 1270  4    forces.
B02 1270  5       For Mr& Kennedy, speaking softly and carrying a
B02 1280  5    sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation.
B02 1290  2    The new President is in no position to start out his
B02 1290 13    dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs. He
B02 1300  8    must show at the outset that he means exactly what
B02 1310  6    he says.
B02 1310  8       In this case he has put the alternatives clearly
B02 1320  4    to Mr& Khrushchev for the third time. At his press
B02 1330  3    conference Mr& Kennedy said, "All we want in Laos is
B02 1340  2    peace not war **h a truly neutral government not a
B02 1340 12    cold war pawn". At the scene he has just as clearly
B02 1350  9    shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready
B02 1360  4    position.
B02 1360  5       Since Laos is of no more purely military value to
B02 1370  4    Moscow itself than it is to Washington, this approach
B02 1380  2    might be expected to head off Mr& Khrushchev for the
B02 1380 12    moment. But because of the peculiar nature of the military
B02 1390 10    situation in Laos, the Soviet leader must be tempted
B02 1400  8    to let things ride- a course that would appear to cost
B02 1410  6    him little on the spot, but would bog Washington in
B02 1420  2    a tactical mess.
B02 1420  5       As wars go, Laos is an extremely little one. Casualties
B02 1430  4    have been running about a dozen men a day. The hard
B02 1440  2    core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only
B02 1440 11    some 2,000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters. But
B02 1450  7    for the United States and its ~SEATO allies to attempt
B02 1460  6    to shore up a less tough, less combat-tested government
B02 1470  2    army in monsoon-shrouded, road-shy, guerrilla-th'-wisp
B02 1480  1    terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners.
B02 1490  1       But if anything can bring home to Mr& Khrushchev
B02 1490 10    the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment
B02 1500  7    from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indians contest,
B02 1510  2    it will probably be the fact that ~SEATO forces are
B02 1520  3    ready to attempt it- plus the fact that Moscow has
B02 1520 13    something to lose from closing off disarmament and
B02 1530  8    other bigger negotiations with Washington.
B02 1540  3       Fortunately both the Republicans and America's chief
B02 1550  2    Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos
B02 1560  1    aim of the President. Actually it would be more accurate
B02 1560 11    to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung
B02 1570  9    fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve
B02 1580  6    a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table.
B02 1590  2       It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle
B02 1600  1    so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as
B02 1600 12    unreasonable. The State Department tacitly rejected
B02 1610  6    the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of
B02 1620  5    1954, and last year Washington backed the rightist
B02 1630  2    coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma.
B02 1640  1       But since last fall the United States has been moving
B02 1640 10    toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to
B02 1650  7    back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by
B02 1660  3    outside observers and followed by a conference of interested
B02 1670  2    powers.
B02 1670  3       The road to a guaranteed-neutral, coup-proof Laos
B02 1680  2    is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's
B02 1680 12    terrain. But for the safety of Southeast Asia, and
B02 1690  9    for the sake of the Laotian people- who would not be
B02 1700  7    well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged
B02 1710  3    in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that
B02 1720  1    country from the cold war had to be made. The world
B02 1720 12    awaits Mr& Khrushchev's choice of alternatives.
B02 1730  4    #A VOTE FOR EDUCATIONAL ~TV#
B02 1740  1    The Senate's overwhelming (64-13) vote to support locally
B02 1740 10    controlled educational ~TV efforts should be emulated
B02 1750  7    in the lower house.
B02 1760  2       Twice previously the Senate has approved measures
B02 1760  9    backing ~ETV and the House has let them die. But this
B02 1770 11    year prospects may be better. The House communications
B02 1780  7    subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill
B02 1790  6    calling for the states to match federal funds.
B02 1800  1       This year's Senate measure would provide each state
B02 1800  9    and the District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be
B02 1810  8    used in support of private, state, or municipal ~ETV
B02 1820  5    efforts. The funds would be used for equipment, not
B02 1830  4    for land, buildings, or operation.
B02 1830  9       The relatively few communities that have educational
B02 1840  6    stations have found them of considerable value. But,
B02 1850  5    lacking money from commercial sponsors, the stations
B02 1855  2    have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving
B02 1860  6    their service. Other communities- the ones to be aided
B02 1870  8    most by the Senate bill- have had difficulty starting
B02 1880  7    such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment.
B03 0010  1    #A GOOD MAN DEPARTS GOODBY, MR& SAM#
B03 0010  8    Sam Rayburn was a good man, a good American, and, third,
B03 0020  6    a good Democrat.
B03 0020  9       He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure;
B03 0030  8    Mr& Speaker, Mr& Sam, and Mr& Democrat, at one and
B03 0040  7    the same time.
B03 0040 10       The House was his habitat and there he flourished,
B03 0050  7    first as a young representative, then as a forceful
B03 0060  5    committee chairman, and finally in the post for which
B03 0070  1    he seemed intended from birth, Speaker of the House,
B03 0070 10    and second most powerful man in Washington.
B03 0080  6       Mr& Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to
B03 0090  6    label. He was no flaming liberal, yet the New Deal,
B03 0100  2    the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him. He was
B03 0110  1    not a rear-looking conservative, yet partisans of that
B03 0110 10    persuasion will miss him as much as any.
B03 0120  7       Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician
B03 0130  4    by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence
B03 0140  1    and that he keep his word. Sam Rayburn took unnumbered
B03 0140 11    secrets with him to the grave, for he was never loquacious,
B03 0150 10    and his word, once given, was not subject to retraction.
B03 0160  7    It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected
B03 0170  6    that others keep theirs.
B03 0170 10       The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant
B03 0180  7    or theatrical. His leadership was not for audiences.
B03 0190  5    A growl, a nod, was usually enough. When it was not,
B03 0200  3    one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented.
B03 0210  1    He would rise in the well of the House, his chin upon
B03 0210 13    his chest, his hands gripping the side of a desk, and
B03 0220  9    the political and legislative chatter would subside
B03 0230  4    into silence.
B03 0230  6       He spoke briefly, sensibly, to the point and without
B03 0240  6    oratorical flourishes He made good, plain American
B03 0250  2    common sense and the House usually recognized it and
B03 0250 11    acted upon it.
B03 0260  3       These public efforts were rare because Mr& Rayburn
B03 0270  1    normally did his counseling, persuading and educating
B03 0270  8    long before an issue reached its test on the House
B03 0280  9    floor. He expected Democrats to do their duty when
B03 0290  6    it had been patiently pointed out to them. With his
B03 0300  2    long service he had a long memory, an excellent thing
B03 0300 12    in a political leader.
B03 0310  2       He was, of course, in the House for a very long
B03 0320  1    time. There are only two men remaining in Congress
B03 0320 10    who, with Rayburn, voted for the declaration of war
B03 0330  7    against Germany in 1917. To almost two generations
B03 0340  4    of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence
B03 0350  2    of Mr& Sam coincided with that of the House.
B03 0360  1       And it was the House he loved. To be presiding officer
B03 0360 11    of it was the end of his desire and ambition. The Senate
B03 0370  9    to him was not the "upper body" and he corrected those
B03 0380  6    who said he served "under" the president. He served
B03 0390  4    "with" him.
B03 0390  6       Sound the roll of those with whom he served and
B03 0400  6    who preceded him in death. Woodrow Wilson, with whom
B03 0410  3    he began his years in Washington, Warren G& Harding,
B03 0420  1    Calvin Coolidge, ~FDR, with whom he managed a social
B03 0420 10    revolution. And those still with us, Herbert C& Hoover,
B03 0430  9    Harry S& Truman, Dwight D& Eisenhower and John F& Kennedy.
B03 0440  8       He was a fighter for those of his own party. Mr&
B03 0450 10    Truman has only to recall the "hopeless" campaign of
B03 0460  5    1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the
B03 0470  5    first experience of Mr& Kennedy with Congress would
B03 0480  1    have been sadder than it was had not Mr& Sam been there.
B03 0480 13    As it was, his absence because of his final illness
B03 0490  9    was a blow to the administration.
B03 0500  1       With Republican presidents, he fought fair. He was
B03 0510  1    his own man, not an automatic obstructionist. He kept
B03 0510 10    his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns,
B03 0520  6    but that is part of the game he was born to play.
B03 0530  5       Under any name- Mr& Speaker, Mr& Democrat, Mr& Sam-
B03 0540  4    he was a good man.
B03 0540  9    #~UN OFF THE CONGO TRACK#
B03 0550  1    Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve
B03 0550 11    the cause of peace under the United Nations banner
B03 0560  9    have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese
B03 0570  7    troops supposedly their friends.
B03 0580  1       In 18 months, no more grisly incident has been reported
B03 0580 11    from that jungle. Simply out of bloodlust, their murderers
B03 0590  8    dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into
B03 0600  7    the river. The excuse was offered for them that they
B03 0610  5    had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.
B03 0620  1    In other words, atrocities by savages wearing the uniform
B03 0620 10    of the central government might be condoned, had the
B03 0630  7    victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga.
B03 0640  4       Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood
B03 0650  5    or that ~UN is making any progress whatever toward
B03 0660  2    its goal of so making it? To the contrary, through
B03 0660 12    the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence.
B03 0670  8    Mass rapes, troop mutinies, uncontrolled looting and
B03 0680  4    pillage and reckless military adventures, given no
B03 0690  3    sanction by any political authority, have become almost
B03 0700  1    daily occurrences. Yet this basic condition of outlawry
B03 0700  9    and anarchy is not the work of Katanga. It happens
B03 0710  8    in the territory of the Leopoldville government, which
B03 0720  3    is itself a fiction, demonstrably incapable of governing,
B03 0730  3    and commanding only such limited credit abroad as ~UN
B03 0740  1    support gives it.
B03 0740  4       The main question raised by the incident is how
B03 0750  2    much longer will ~UN bury its head in the sand on the
B03 0750 14    Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that
B03 0760  9    it has no solution in present terms? The probable answer
B03 0770  6    is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise
B03 0780  5    a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations
B03 0790  2    wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are
B03 0790 14    visiting ruin on Central Africa.
B03 0800  5       Right now, they are pushing a resolution which would
B03 0810  5    have ~UN use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga.
B03 0820  2    That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several
B03 0830  1    points of view. The ~UN army is too weak, too demoralized
B03 0830 12    for the task. Further, it has its work cut out stopping
B03 0840 11    anarchy where it is now garrisoned. Last, it makes
B03 0850  7    no sense to deliver Katanga, the one reasonably solid
B03 0860  3    territory, into the existing chaos.
B03 0860  8       The Congo should have been mandated, because it
B03 0870  7    was not ready for independence. The idea was not even
B03 0880  6    suggested because political expediency prevailed over
B03 0890  2    wisdom. It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate
B03 0890 13    because it is inconsistent with what is termed political
B03 0900  9    realism. But if any realism and feeling for truth remain
B03 0910  8    in the General Assembly, it is time for men of courage
B03 0920  7    to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some
B03 0930  3    new approach. Otherwise, ~UN will march blindly on
B03 0930 11    to certain defeat.
B03 0940  3    #FEATHERBED REVERSAL#
B03 0940  5    A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement
B03 0950  5    reached between the Southern Pacific Co& and the Order
B03 0960  5    of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the
B03 0970  3    grounds that it was not based on complete information.
B03 0980  1       The editorial was based on a news association dispatch
B03 0980  9    which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement
B03 0990  7    whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week
B03 1000  6    whether they worked or not and that a reduction in
B03 1010  2    their number was limited to 2 per cent per year. Our
B03 1010 13    comment was that this was "featherbedding" in its ultimate
B03 1020  9    form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced
B03 1030  7    since it had entered into such an agreement. The statement
B03 1040  5    was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received
B03 1050  3    some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but
B03 1060  1    that it was difficult to imagine what could balance
B03 1060 10    a job for life.
B03 1070  1       Additional information supplied to us discloses
B03 1070  7    that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers
B03 1080  7    of which it was in need. Also, normal personal attrition
B03 1090  5    would make the job reduction provision more or less
B03 1100  4    academic.
B03 1100  5       The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific
B03 1110  2    was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable
B03 1120  1    to other situations in other industries. The solution
B03 1120  9    reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the
B03 1130  8    railroad than that originally included in a series
B03 1140  5    of union demands.
B03 1150  1    #MEDITATIONS FROM A FALLOUT SHELTER#
B03 1150  6    Time was when the house of delegates of the American
B03 1160  4    Bar association leaned to the common sense side. But
B03 1170  3    the internationalists have taken over the governing
B03 1170 10    body of the bar, and when the lads met in St& Louis,
B03 1180 11    it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote
B03 1190  7    unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less
B03 1200  4    than wonderful, despite an imperfection here and there.
B03 1210  2       It was, the brief writers decided, "man's best hope
B03 1220  1    for a peaceful and law abiding world". Peace, it's
B03 1220 10    wonderful, and "world law", it's wonderful, too, and
B03 1230  7    shouldn't we get an international covenant extending
B03 1240  3    it into space, before the Russians put some claim jumper
B03 1250  4    on the moon?
B03 1250  7       Meanwhile, in Moscow, Khrushchev was adding his
B03 1260  4    bit to the march of world law by promising to build
B03 1270  1    a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of ~TNT,
B03 1270 13    to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs
B03 1280  9    who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin
B03 1290  5    to communism.
B03 1290  7       A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions- roughly
B03 1300  5    some six and a half times bigger than anything the
B03 1310  4    United States has triggered experimentally- would certainly
B03 1320  2    produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev
B03 1320 11    might use it to propel the seminar of the house of
B03 1330 11    delegates from St& Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't
B03 1340  8    even be any beer to drink.
B03 1350  1       While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin
B03 1350 11    contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason
B03 1360  9    by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate
B03 1370  6    coexistence thru suicide.
B03 1370  9       "Fools", he bayed, "what do you think you are doing"?
B03 1390  1       The only response we can think of is the humble
B03 1390 10    one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with
B03 1400  5    our shoes in the United Nations, but perhaps the heavy
B03 1410  4    domes in the house of delegates can improve on this
B03 1420  1    feeble effort.
B03 1420  3       Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason
B03 1430  1    was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking
B03 1430 10    of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a
B03 1440  8    gun. The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to
B03 1450  4    Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro rushed
B03 1460  2    to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian
B03 1470  1    foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer
B03 1470 10    of old Ten O'Clock Shadow. The plane was sent back
B03 1480  7    to the United States, for a change, but Castro kept
B03 1490  6    the crazy gunman, who will prove a suitable recruit
B03 1500  2    to the revolution.
B03 1500  5       Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed
B03 1510  4    by Castro's right hand man, Che Guevara, who edified
B03 1520  3    the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting
B03 1530  1    in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents
B03 1530  9    purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas,
B03 1540  8    Venezuela. The contents were highly embarrassing to
B03 1550  5    American spokesmen, who were on hand to promise Latin
B03 1560  4    Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.
B03 1570  1       Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced
B03 1570 10    by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes,
B03 1580  6    but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer
B03 1590  6    to the effect that, but for its own incompetence in
B03 1600  3    protecting American interests, these things would not
B03 1610  2    happen. The same can be said about the half-hearted
B03 1610 12    Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April,
B03 1620  7    which, we trust, is not symptomatic of the methods
B03 1630  5    to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev.
B03 1640  2       Pass the iron rations, please, and light another
B03 1650  1    candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded
B03 1650 11    to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away.
B03 1660 12    #THE CUSTOMER LOSES AGAIN#
B03 1670  2    The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce
B03 1670 10    commission has ordered a group of railroads not to
B03 1680  9    reduce their freight rates on grain, as they had planned
B03 1690  7    to do this month.
B03 1690 11       The request for lower rates originated with the
B03 1700  6    Southern railway, which has spent a good deal of time
B03 1710  6    and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which
B03 1720  1    it says it can move grain at about half what it costs
B03 1720 13    in the conventional, smaller car. By reducing rates
B03 1730  6    as much as 60 per cent, it and its associated railroads
B03 1740  3    hope to win back some of the business they have lost
B03 1750  2    to truckers and barge lines.
B03 1750  7       The board's action shows what free enterprise is
B03 1760  5    up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.
B04 0010  1    #A SHOCK WAVE FROM AFRICA#
B04 0010  6    WORD OF Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane
B04 0020  5    crash has sent a shockwave around the globe. As head
B04 0030  3    of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace,
B04 0030 14    and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs
B04 0040 11    precariously. It was on the eve of a momentous U&N&
B04 0050  8    session to come to grips with cold war issues. His
B04 0060  4    firm hand will be desperately missed.
B04 0060 10       Mr& Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace.
B04 0070 10    He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe, the secessionist
B04 0080  7    president of Congo's Katanga province where recent
B04 0090  4    fighting had been bloody. He earnestly urged a cease-fire.
B04 0100  5       The story of the fatal crash is not fully known.
B04 0110  2    The U&N&-chartered plane which was flying from the
B04 0110 11    conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been
B04 0120  9    riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was
B04 0130  6    newly repaired. Whether this, or overt action, was
B04 0150  4    the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.
B04 0160  1       The death of Mr& Hammarskjold removes the United
B04 0160  9    Nations' most controversial leader. He was controversial
B04 0170  7    because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom
B04 0180  5    with justice. He courageously defended the rights of
B04 0190  4    small nations, and he stood his ground against the
B04 0200  1    savage attacks of the Communist bloc.
B04 0200  7       The Congo, in whose cause he died, was the scene
B04 0210  6    of one of his greatest triumphs. His policies had resolved
B04 0220  3    the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war
B04 0230  1    and workable solutions were beginning to take shape.
B04 0230  9    When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these
B04 0240  5    solutions Mr& Hammarskjold, despite the danger, flew
B04 0250  4    to exert a calming influence. He gave his life for
B04 0260  2    his beliefs.
B04 0260  4       The U&N& session scheduled for today will meet under
B04 0270  4    the cloud of his passing. It is a crucial session with
B04 0280  1    the world on the edge of momentous developments.
B04 0280  9       If the manner of his passing moves the nations to
B04 0290  8    act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues
B04 0300  4    that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason
B04 0310  1    and justice. That is the hope of mankind.
B04 0310  9    #MONUMENT TO TOGETHERNESS#
B04 0320  1    REACHING AGREEMENT on projects of value to the whole
B04 0320 10    community has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest
B04 0330  9    tasks. Too many have bogged down in bickering. Even
B04 0340  8    when public bodies arrived at a consensus, at least
B04 0350  5    one dissenting vote has been usual.
B04 0350 11       So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity.
B04 0360  9    All nine members of the Inter-American Center Authority
B04 0370  6    voted for Goodbody + Company's proposal to finance
B04 0380  4    the long-awaited trade and cultural center.
B04 0390  1       The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell
B04 0390 11    out the terms of its contract. If the indenture is
B04 0400  8    accepted, the authority will proceed to validate a
B04 0410  5    bond issue repayable from revenue. Then Goodbody will
B04 0420  2    hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing
B04 0420 11    the spacious Graves Tract to house the center.
B04 0430  7       The next step awaits approval today by the Metro
B04 0440  6    commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port
B04 0450  3    Authority. They allotted $500,000 three years ago to
B04 0460  1    support Interama until its own financing could be arranged.
B04 0460 10    Less than half the sum has been spent, since the Interama
B04 0470 10    board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking
B04 0480  6    negotiations. The balance is being budgeted for the
B04 0490  4    coming year.
B04 0490  6       Unanimity on Interama is not surprising. It is one
B04 0500  5    of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone
B04 0510  2    is agreed. The City of Miami recently yielded a prior
B04 0510 12    claim of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear
B04 0520 10    the way for the project. County officials have cooperated
B04 0530  5    consistently. So have the people's elected spokesmen
B04 0540  3    at the state and federal levels.
B04 0540  9       Interama, as it rises, will be a living monument
B04 0550  9    to Greater Miami's ability to get together on worthwhile
B04 0560  6    enterprises.
B04 0560  7    #A SHORT REPORT AND A GOOD ONE#
B04 0570  4    PROGRESS, or lack of it, toward civil rights in the
B04 0580  2    50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation
B04 0580 12    issued last week by the United States Commission on
B04 0590  9    Civil Rights.
B04 0600  1       Much happened in this field during the past 12 months.
B04 0600 11    Each state advisory committee documented its own activity.
B04 0610  7    Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida's is the
B04 0620  6    shortest of all, requiring only four paragraphs.
B04 0630  2       "The established pattern of relative calm in the
B04 0640  1    field of race relations has continued in all areas",
B04 0640 10    reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville
B04 0650  8    and including two South Floridians, William D& Singer
B04 0660  5    and John B& Turner of Miami.
B04 0670  1       "No complaints or charges have been filed during
B04 0670  9    the past year, either verbally or written, from any
B04 0680  8    individual or group.
B04 0690  1       "The committee continues to feel that Florida has
B04 0690  9    progressed in a sound and equitable program at both
B04 0700  9    the state and local levels in its efforts to review
B04 0710  5    and assess transition problems as they arise from time
B04 0720  2    to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights".
B04 0720 11       Problems have arisen in this sensitive field but
B04 0730  8    have been handled in most cases with understanding
B04 0740  4    and restraint. The progress reported by the advisory
B04 0750  2    committee is real. While some think we move too fast
B04 0750 12    and others too slowly, Florida's record is a good one
B04 0760  9    and stands out among the 50.
B04 0770  3    #WEST GERMANY REMAINS WESTERN#
B04 0770  7    WEST GERMANY will face the crucial tests that lie ahead,
B04 0780  8    on Berlin and unification, with a coalition government.
B04 0790  4    This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's national
B04 0800  2    election.
B04 0800  3       Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party
B04 0810  2    slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough
B04 0820  1    to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed
B04 0820 10    since 1957. In order to form a new government it must
B04 0830  9    deal with one of the two rival parties which gained
B04 0840  4    strength. Inevitably this means some compromise.
B04 0850  1       The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired.
B04 0850 10    Both Willy Brandt's Social Democrats, who gained 22
B04 0860  8    seats in the new parliament, and the Free Democrats,
B04 0870  7    who picked up 23, will insist on that before they enter
B04 0880  6    the government.
B04 0880  8       Moon-faced Ludwig Erhart, the economic expert, probably
B04 0890  6    will ascend to the leadership long denied him.
B04 0900  4       If he becomes chancellor, Dr& Erhart would make
B04 0910  2    few changes. The wizard who fashioned West Germany's
B04 0910 10    astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free
B04 0920  8    enterprise. He is dedicated to building the nation's
B04 0930  5    strength and, as are all West Germans, to a free Berlin
B04 0940  5    and to reunion with captive East Germany.
B04 0950  1       What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies
B04 0950 12    consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition
B04 0960  9    that will result.
B04 0970  1       If the party of Adenauer and Erhart, with 45 per
B04 0970 10    cent of the vote, approaches the party of Willy Brandt,
B04 0980  7    which won 36 per cent, the result would be a stiffening
B04 0990  5    of the old resolve. West Berlin's Mayor Brandt vigorously
B04 1000  3    demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his
B04 1010  1    city and won votes by it.
B04 1010  7       The Free Democrats (12 per cent of the vote) believe
B04 1020  5    a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the
B04 1030  2    Soviet Union, and more dealings with the Communist
B04 1030 10    bloc.
B04 1040  1       The question left by the election is whether West
B04 1040 10    Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more
B04 1050  6    flexibility. It could go either way, since the gains
B04 1060  5    for both points of view were about the same.
B04 1070  1       Regardless of the decision two facts are clear.
B04 1070  9    West Germany, with its industrial and military might,
B04 1080  6    reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the
B04 1090  4    free nations. And the career of Konrad Adenauer, who
B04 1100  2    upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which
B04 1105  1    Bismarck began, draws near the end.
B04 1110  6    #BETTER ASK BEFORE JOINING#
B04 1110 10    AMERICANS are a nation of joiners, a quality which
B04 1120  9    our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing. But
B04 1130  5    it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make
B04 1140  4    a spectacle of himself.
B04 1140  8       For instance, so-called "conservative" organizations,
B04 1150  3    some of them secret, are sprouting in the garden of
B04 1160  5    joining where "liberal" organizations once took root.
B04 1170  2       One specific example is a secret "fraternity" which
B04 1180  1    will "coordinate anti-Communist efforts". The principle
B04 1180  8    is commendable but we suspect that in the practice
B04 1190  8    somebody is going to get gulled.
B04 1200  2       According to The Chicago Tribune News Service, State
B04 1210  2    Atty& Gen& Stanley Mosk of California has devised a
B04 1210 11    series of questions which the joiner might well ask
B04 1220  9    about any organization seeking his money and his name:
B04 1230  7    _1._
B04 1230  8       Does it assail schools and churches with blanket
B04 1240  5    accusations?
B04 1240  6    _2._
B04 1240  7       Does it attack other traditional American institutions
B04 1250  4    with unsupportable and wild charges?
B04 1260  1    _3._
B04 1260  2       Does it put the label of un-American or subversive
B04 1260 12    on everyone with whom it disagrees politically?
B04 1270  7    _4._
B04 1270  8       Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming
B04 1280  7    American statesmen for wars, communism, depression,
B04 1290  3    and other troubles of the world?
B04 1290  9    _5._
B04 1290 10       Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such
B04 1300  8    means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing
B04 1310  5    campaigns?
B04 1310  6    _6._
B04 1310  7       Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount
B04 1320  7    of money they collect than in the principles they purport
B04 1330  4    to advocate?
B04 1330  6       In some instances a seventh question can be added:
B04 1340  5    _7._
B04 1340  6       Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign
B04 1350  5    government, political party or personality in opposition
B04 1360  1    or preference to the American system?
B04 1360  7       If the would-be joiner asks these questions he is
B04 1370  7    not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking
B04 1380  4    to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions
B04 1390  2    of Americans in a troubled time. FALLING somewhere
B04 1400  1    in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas-
B04 1400 10    difficult to see but undeniably there, nevertheless-
B04 1410  7    is the tropical green "city" of Islandia, a string
B04 1420  6    of offshore islands that has almost no residents, limited
B04 1430  4    access and an unlimited future. The latter is what
B04 1440  2    concerns us all. Whatever land you can see here, from
B04 1440 12    the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward,
B04 1450  8    belongs to someone- people who have title to the land.
B04 1460  7    And what you can't see, the land underneath the water,
B04 1470  4    belongs to someone, too. The public. The only real
B04 1480  2    problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the
B04 1480 13    above-water land can develop their property without
B04 1490  7    the public losing its underwater land and the right
B04 1500  5    to its development for public use and enjoyment. In
B04 1510  2    the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida, the
B04 1510 11    developers of waterfront land have too often wound
B04 1520  8    up with both their land and ours. In this instance,
B04 1530  4    happily, insistence is being made that our share is
B04 1540  2    protected. And until this protection is at least as
B04 1540 11    concrete as, say, the row of hotels that bars us from
B04 1550 10    our own sands at Miami Beach, those who represent us
B04 1560  5    all should agree to nothing.
B04 1570  1    #CLOSED DOORS IN CITY HALL#
B04 1580  1    The reaction of certain City Council members to California's
B04 1590  2    newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was
B04 1590 12    disappointing.
B04 1600  1       We had assumed that at least this local legislative
B04 1610  1    body had nothing to hide, and, therefore, had no objections
B04 1610 11    to making the deliberations of its committees and the
B04 1620  8    city commissions available to the public.
B04 1630  4       In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes, collectively
B04 1640  2    known as the Brown Act, the Legislature declares that
B04 1650  1    "the public commissions, boards and councils and other
B04 1650  9    public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct
B04 1660 10    of the people's business. It is the intent of the law
B04 1670  8    that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations
B04 1680  4    be conducted openly.
B04 1680  7       "The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty
B04 1690  9    to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating
B04 1700  6    authority, do not give their public servants the right
B04 1710  4    to decide what is good for the people to know and what
B04 1720  2    is not good for them to know.
B04 1720  9       The full implementation of these noble words, however,
B04 1730  5    has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature.
B04 1740  3    Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting
B04 1750  1    guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted,
B04 1750  9    but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento
B04 1760  9    plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act.
B04 1770  6       Despite the lip service paid by local governments,
B04 1780  3    the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted
B04 1790  1    by reservations and rationalizations. When all else
B04 1790  8    fails, it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental
B04 1800  9    operations.
B04 1810  1       We submit that this is a most desirable effect of
B04 1810 11    the law- and one of its principal aims. Without public
B04 1820  7    scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would
B04 1830  5    no doubt be conducted more speedily. But the citizens
B04 1840  2    would, of course, never be sure that the decisions
B04 1840 11    that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious.
B05 0010  1    #HELP WHEN NEEDED#
B05 0010  4    @ IF THE Dominican Republic achieves free, democratic
B05 0020  3    government, it will be due in large part to the U&S&
B05 0030  1    show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent
B05 0030 10    a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship.
B05 0040  5       Outwardly, Ciudad Trujillo is calm. None of the
B05 0050  7    Trujillo family remains. Mr& Balaguer is in control,
B05 0060  5    and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect
B05 0070  3    his offer of a coalition government preliminary to
B05 0070 11    free elections in the spring.
B05 0080  4       Had U&S& warships not appeared off the Dominican
B05 0090  3    coast, there is every possibility that the country
B05 0090 11    would now be wracked by civil war. Ultimately either
B05 0100  9    the Trujillos would have been returned to power or
B05 0110  7    the conflict would have produced conditions favorable
B05 0120  2    to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro
B05 0130  1    in Cuba.
B05 0130  3       Within the Organization of American States, there
B05 0140  2    may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention
B05 0150  1    which was not without risk obviously. But there was
B05 0150 10    no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined
B05 0160  6    Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting, "Vive Yankees"!
B05 0170  4    More, the U&S& action was hailed by a principal opposition
B05 0180  5    leader, Dr& Juan Bosch, as having saved "many lives
B05 0190  3    and many troubles in the near future".
B05 0190 10       Mr& Balaguer's troubles are by no means over. He
B05 0200  9    will need the help of all ~OAS members to eradicate,
B05 0210  7    finally, the forces of authoritarianism, pro-Trujillo
B05 0220  3    and pro-Castro alike. In cooperating toward that objective,
B05 0230  3    ~OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated
B05 0240  2    by the United States. @
B05 0240  7    #MATTER OF SURVIVAL#
B05 0240 10    @ THOSE watching the growing rivalry between craft
B05 0250  8    unions and industrial unions may recognize all the
B05 0260  6    pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935.
B05 0270  4       Now, as then, it is a matter of jobs. Craft unions
B05 0280  2    seek work that industrial unions claim, such as factory
B05 0280 11    maintenance.
B05 0290  1       The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark
B05 0290 10    secession from the American Federation of Labor of
B05 0300  8    its industrial union members. That breach was healed
B05 0310  6    20 years later by merger of the American Federation
B05 0320  2    of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.
B05 0330  1    Or that's what it looked like at the time.
B05 0330 10       But automation and the increasing complexity of
B05 0340  6    factories has renewed the competition for jobs. Walter
B05 0350  4    Reuther, leader of the industrial union faction of
B05 0360  2    the ~AFL-~CIO, says another two years of this squabbling
B05 0370  1    will be disastrous for all American labor.
B05 0370  8       Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor
B05 0380  7    as, say, Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters, is a matter
B05 0390  5    of conjecture. But the jurisdictional disputes that
B05 0400  2    result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win
B05 0400 11    friends for labor.
B05 0410  2       Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as
B05 0410 13    a condition of national survival, this country can
B05 0420  7    have little patience with labor's family feuds. The
B05 0430  5    concept of labor as a special class is outmoded, and
B05 0440  3    in the task confronting America as bastion of the free
B05 0450  1    world, labor must learn to put the national interest
B05 0450 10    first if it is itself to survive. @
B05 0460  4    #DETERRENT#
B05 0460  5    @ THE Army, Navy and Air Force, among others, may question
B05 0470  6    Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United
B05 0480  6    States agriculture is the "strongest deterrent" to
B05 0490  3    the spread of communism. But the secretary insists
B05 0490 11    that the success of the American farmer is the "greatest
B05 0500 10    single source of strength" in the struggle to insure
B05 0510  8    freedom around the world.
B05 0520  1       Mr& Freeman said that in many of the countries he
B05 0520 11    visited on a recent world trade trip people were more
B05 0530  9    awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses
B05 0540  5    than by our industrial production- or even by the Soviet's
B05 0550  5    successes in space. This shouldn't surprise the secretary;
B05 0560  3    American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses
B05 0570  1    for a long, long time.
B05 0570  6       In fact, over the years, the American farmer's capacity
B05 0580  3    to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar.
B05 0590  2    And thus far, Mr& Freeman has offered very little relief.
B05 0600  1       The 1961 feed grain program, which the secretary
B05 0600  9    sponsored, has been declared a billion dollar fiasco.
B05 0610  8    In exchange for higher price supports, growers pledged
B05 0620  4    reduction in planted acreage. But the farmers outsmarted
B05 0630  3    Washington by shortening the distance between the rows
B05 0640  2    and pouring on the fertilizer.
B05 0640  7       The result: $1.1 billion added to the deficit in
B05 0650  6    the federal budget. Perhaps, as Mr& Freeman says, American
B05 0660  3    agriculture may stop the Communists, but it is also
B05 0670  1    swindling the American taxpayer. @
B05 0670  6    #WHAT'S WRONG AT STATE#
B05 0670 10    @ A SENATE subcommittee headed by Sen& Jackson of Washington
B05 0690  1    has been going over the State Department and has reached
B05 0690 11    some predictable conclusions. The department needs
B05 0700  6    a clearer "sense of direction" at the top and it needs
B05 0710  8    fewer, but better, people, Sen& Jackson says.
B05 0720  3       The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the
B05 0730  2    effectiveness of the department. President Kennedy
B05 0730  8    has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance.
B05 0740  6       But those who would revitalize so complex an organization
B05 0750  6    must, first of all, overcome the resistance of layers
B05 0760  4    of officials wedded to traditional procedures, suspicious
B05 0770  2    of innovation and fearful of mistakes.
B05 0770  8       Nor does Sen& Jackson discuss the delicate situation
B05 0780  6    created by the presence in the White House of a corps
B05 0790  7    of presidential assistants engaged in the study of
B05 0800  3    foreign policy. This tends to create friction and confusion
B05 0810  1    and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore
B05 0810 12    vigor and initiative among his subordinates.
B05 0820  5       But competent observers believe he is making progress,
B05 0830  5    particularly toward what Sen& Jackson lists as the
B05 0840  4    primary need- "a clearer understanding of where our
B05 0850  1    vital national interests lie and what we must do to
B05 0850 11    promote them".
B05 0860  1       The Jackson report will provide some of the political
B05 0860 10    support Mr& Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department
B05 0870 13    personnel engaged, as Sen& Jackson puts it, "in work
B05 0880  9    that does not really need doing". Mr& Rusk should also
B05 0890  7    draw comfort from Sen& Jackson's recommendation that
B05 0900  3    congressional methods of dealing with national security
B05 0910  2    problems be improved. Self-criticism is a rare but
B05 0910 11    needed commodity in Congress. @
B05 0920  5    #BETTING MEN#
B05 0920  7    @ FORECASTING economic activity is a hazardous undertaking
B05 0930  7    even for the specialist. But now apparently the job
B05 0940  6    of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to
B05 0950  4    risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment
B05 0960  1    trends.
B05 0960  2       James P& Mitchell, when he was the head of the department,
B05 0970  1    promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop
B05 0970 10    below three million a couple of years ago. He lost,
B05 0980 10    but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora.
B05 0990  7       His successor, Secretary Goldberg, also has been
B05 1000  4    guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which
B05 1010  1    has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last
B05 1010 12    11 months. No betting man, Mr& Goldberg says he's merely
B05 1020  8    "putting my neck out again" by predicting the rate
B05 1030  6    will go down this month. He is basing his guess on
B05 1040  4    new government statistics that show business has broadened
B05 1050  1    its stride- a new record high in personal income, an
B05 1050 11    increase in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales
B05 1060  9    and a gain in orders for durable goods.
B05 1070  3       Mr& Mitchell had an excuse for losing- the steel
B05 1080  2    strike lasted much longer than he anticipated. Mr&
B05 1080 10    Goldberg has less reason for missing. The economy seems
B05 1090  9    to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane
B05 1100  8    season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't
B05 1110  5    be blamed in November. The odds thus appear favorable
B05 1120  1    that the secretary's neck may be spared. @

B05 1150  7    insists he would be very unhappy if communism established
B05 1160  5    its power in Southeast Asia.
B05 1170  1       But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph
B05 1170  8    is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the
B05 1180 10    towel. "I have to see the facts", is the way the prince

B05 1210  2       Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some

B05 1240  1    #BOTTOM SIGHTED#
B05 1240  3    @ COMMERCE Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast
B05 1250  3    in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's
B05 1250 11    economic forecasters. Weeks ago he saw a business upturn
B05 1260  9    in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues
B05 1270  8    in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement.
B05 1280  5    Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary
B05 1290  3    Goldberg fell into line with Mr& Hodges' appraisal,
B05 1300  1    though there has been some reluctance to do so at the
B05 1300 12    White House.
B05 1310  2       And now Mr& Hodges has pioneered further into the
B05 1320  1    economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks
B05 1320  9    business has stopped sliding and that it should start
B05 1330  7    going upward from this point. He is the first top administration
B05 1340  6    officer to see the bottom of the slump.
B05 1350  1       The secretary based his assessment on the upturn
B05 1350  9    in retail sales. February's volume was 1 per cent above
B05 1360  9    January's for the first pickup since last October,
B05 1370  6    although it's still 1.5 per cent off from February
B05 1380  4    1960.
B05 1380  5       Corroborating Mr& Hodges' figures was the Federal
B05 1390  4    Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase
B05 1400  1    in the nation's department stores for the week ending
B05 1400 10    March 4. In Newark, for example, this gain was put
B05 1410  9    at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level. Of course,
B05 1420  6    some of the credit for the sale boost must be given
B05 1430  4    to improvement in the weather and to the fact that
B05 1430 14    Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.
B05 1440 10       Another optimistic sign, this one from the Labor
B05 1450  7    Department, was the report that the long rise in unemployment
B05 1460  6    compensation payments "was interrupted for the first
B05 1470  4    time in the week ending Feb& 25". Initial claims for
B05 1480  2    jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100
B05 1480 11    in the week ending March 4.
B05 1490  4       Mr& Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he
B05 1500  3    doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income
B05 1500 15    taxes. Well, we can't have everything. Prosperity for
B05 1510  8    the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut.

B05 1530 11    march to the sea, for in a single generation he has
B05 1540 10    parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses
B05 1550  6    on to develop the few open spaces that remain. Now
B05 1560  3    the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary, 31 acres of magic
B05 1560 12    attraction for exotic herons, is threatened, but the
B05 1570  8    battlefront extends far beyond our state.
B05 1580  5       Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation
B05 1590  3    of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline, the tiny tract at
B05 1600  2    Stone Harbor may seem unimportant. But Interior Secretary
B05 1600 10    Udall warns that there is a race on between those who
B05 1610 11    would develop our few surviving open shorelines and
B05 1620  5    those who would save them for the enjoyment of all
B05 1630  3    as public preserves.
B05 1630  6       The move for establishment of a national seashore
B05 1640  5    park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod, from Provincetown
B05 1650  1    to Chatham, is strengthened by President Kennedy's
B05 1650  8    interest in that area. But preservation of the natural
B05 1660  9    beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern,
B05 1670  7    for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot
B05 1680  3    of people from all over the country.
B05 1680 10       By comparison, Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies
B05 1690  6    seem less formidable, for aside from the Audubon Society,
B05 1700  7    they are mostly the snowy, common and cattle egrets
B05 1710  5    and the Louisiana, green, little blue and black-crowned

B05 1730  7    sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include
B05 1740  9    in its program to double its park space.
B05 1750  3       The desirability of preserving such places as the
B05 1760  1    Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more
B05 1760  9    apparent every year. Public sentiment for conserving
B05 1770  6    our rich natural heritage is growing. But that heritage

B05 1820  5    Shriver, get off the train right now.
B05 1830  1       First of all, the recruits will have to undergo
B05 1830 10    arduous schooling. It will be a 16-hour training day.
B05 1840  9    Then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country
B05 1850  4    where the diet, culture, language and living conditions
B05 1860  2    will be different. And the pay, of course, will be
B05 1860 12    nil.
B05 1870  1       Despite all this, the idea apparently has captured
B05 1870  9    the imagination of countless youths whose parents are
B05 1880  7    probably more surprised by the response than anybody
B05 1890  5    else.
B06 0010  1       The study of the St& Louis area's economic prospects
B06 0010 10    prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference
B06 0020  7    confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan
B06 0030  8    St& Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture
B06 0040  8    of the Missouri-Illinois countryside.
B06 0050  2       St& Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing
B06 0060  1    and in some places stagnant mid-continent region. Slackened
B06 0070  1    regional demand for St& Louis goods and services reflects
B06 0070 10    the region's relative lack of purchasing power. Not
B06 0080  7    all St& Louis industries, of course, have a market
B06 0090  6    area confined to the immediate neighborhood. But for
B06 0100  3    those which do, the slow growth of the area has a retarding
B06 0110  1    effect on the metropolitan core. The city has a stake
B06 0110 11    in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout
B06 0120  6    outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois.
B06 0130  2       Gov& Dalton's new Commerce and Industry Commission
B06 0140  2    is moving to create a nine-state regional group in
B06 0140 12    a collective effort to attract new industry. That is
B06 0150  8    one approach. Another would be to take the advice of
B06 0160  8    Dr& Elmer Ellis, president of the University of Missouri,
B06 0170  5    and provide for an impartial professional analysis
B06 0180  2    of Missouri's economy. He says the state, in order
B06 0180 11    to proceed with economic development, must develop
B06 0190  7    an understanding of how the various parts of its economy
B06 0200  7    fit together and dovetail into the national economy.
B06 0210  3    @
B06 0210  4       The research center of the University's School of
B06 0220  3    Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake
B06 0230  1    the analysis Dr& Ellis has been talking about. He and
B06 0230 11    Dean John W& Schwada of the Business School outlined
B06 0240  9    the project at a recent conference. The University
B06 0250  6    can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic
B06 0260  5    development through such a study.
B06 0270  1       In Southern Illinois, the new federal program of
B06 0270  9    help to economically depressed areas ought to provide
B06 0280  6    some stimulus to growth. The Carbondale Industrial
B06 0290  2    Development Corp& has obtained a $500,000 loan to help
B06 0300  3    defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory
B06 0300 12    to accommodate production that will provide 500 new
B06 0310  7    jobs. Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West
B06 0320  1    Frankfort labor market, where unemployment has been
B06 0330  3    substantially higher than the national average. The
B06 0330 10    Federal program eventually should have a favorable
B06 0340  7    impact on Missouri's depressed areas, and in the long
B06 0350  6    run that will benefit St& Louis as well. @
B06 0360  1       Politics-ridden St& Clair county in Illinois presents
B06 0370  1    another piece of the problem of metropolitan development.
B06 0370  9    More industrial acreage lies vacant in St& Clair county
B06 0380  8    than in any other jurisdiction in the St& Louis area.
B06 0390  7    The unstable political situation there represents one
B06 0400  4    reason new plants shy away from the East Side.
B06 0410  1       And then there is St& Louis county, where the Democratic
B06 0420  1    leadership has shown little appreciation of the need
B06 0420  9    for sound zoning, of the important relationship between
B06 0430  6    proper land use and economic growth. St& Louis county
B06 0440  5    under its present leadership also has largely closed
B06 0450  3    its eyes to the need for governmental reform, and permitted
B06 0460  1    parochial interests to take priority over area-wide
B06 0460  9    interests. Some plant-location specialists take these
B06 0470  6    signs to mean St& Louis county doesn't want industry,
B06 0480  5    and so they avoid the area, and more jobs are lost.
B06 0490  4       Metropolitan St& Louis's relatively slow rate of
B06 0500  3    growth ought to be a priority concern of the political,
B06 0500 13    business, civic and other leaders on both sides of
B06 0510  9    the Mississippi. Without a great acceleration in the
B06 0520  6    metropolitan area's economy, there will not be sufficient
B06 0530  4    jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters, and St&
B06 0540  1    Louis will slip into second-class status.
B06 0540  8    #AN EXCESS OF ZEAL#
B06 0550  1    Many of our very best friends are reformers. Still
B06 0550 10    we must confess that sometimes some of them go too
B06 0560  8    far. Take, for example, the reformers among New York
B06 0570  4    City's Democrats. Having whipped Mr& De Sapio in the
B06 0580  4    primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall,
B06 0590  1    they have changed the name to Chatham Hall. Even though
B06 0590 11    headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham
B06 0600  8    building, do they believe that they can make the new
B06 0610  7    name stick?
B06 0610  9       Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger
B06 0620  6    often were regarded as badges of political shame, the
B06 0630  3    sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their
B06 0640  2    credit. But it is tradition rather than the record
B06 0640 11    which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name. After
B06 0650  9    all, it goes back to the days in which sedition was
B06 0660  6    not un-American, the days in which the Sons of St&
B06 0670  3    Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force
B06 0680  1    and violence- the British government that is.
B06 0680  8       Further, do our reforming friends really believe
B06 0690  6    that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment
B06 0700  4    of the tiger from their zoo? They will- when they give
B06 0710  2    up the donkey and the elephant. Instead of attempting
B06 0710 11    the impossible, why not a publicity campaign to prove
B06 0720  8    that all the tiger's stripes are not black? That might
B06 0730  7    go over.
B06 0730  9    #THE FAGET CASE#
B06 0730 12    The White House itself has taken steps to remove a
B06 0740 10    former Batista official, Col& Mariano Faget, from his
B06 0750  3    preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees
B06 0760  4    for the Immigration Service.
B06 0760  8       The Faget appointment was preposterous on several
B06 0770  7    grounds. The Kennedy Administration had assured anti-Castro
B06 0780  6    Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates
B06 0790  6    of Dictator Batista. Using a Batista man to screen
B06 0800  4    refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the
B06 0800 11    democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose
B06 0810  7    Castro.
B06 0810  8       Moreover, Col& Faget's information on Cuba was too
B06 0820  8    outdated to be useful in "screening" Castro agents;
B06 0830  6    the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican
B06 0840  6    dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power. And while
B06 0850  4    he had headed Batista's anti-Communist section, the
B06 0860  2    Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much
B06 0860 11    as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists.
B06 0865  8       Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with
B06 0880  7    Gen& J& M& swing, an Eisenhower appointee as head of
B06 0890  6    the Immigration Service. Gen& Swing has received public
B06 0900  4    attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives
B06 0910  2    of his office. His official term expired last summer.
B06 0920  1    Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement
B06 0920 10    by his friend, Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania,
B06 0930  5    at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently
B06 0940  4    searching for all the House votes it could get.
B06 0950  3       Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration
B06 0960  1    matters, but he has announced plans to retire in 1962.
B06 0960 11    At that point the Administration will have little reason
B06 0970  8    to hang onto Gen& Swing. The Faget case was the kind
B06 0980  8    of salvage job the Administration should not have to
B06 0990  5    repeat.
B06 0990  6    #MR& EISENHOWER, POLITICIAN#
B06 0990  9    As President, Dwight D& Eisenhower often assumed a
B06 1000  8    role aloof from the strife of partisan politics. As
B06 1010  7    a former President, however, Mr& Eisenhower abandoned
B06 1020  3    this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New
B06 1030  3    York Republican rally, and generally missed his target.
B06 1030 11       Mr& Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard
B06 1040 10    lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the
B06 1050 11    entire Corps as a "juvenile experiment" and to suggest
B06 1060  6    sending a Corps member to the moon. This was juvenile
B06 1070  5    ridicule. Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious
B06 1080  3    purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad.
B06 1080 12    His words were the more ungracious to come from a man
B06 1090 11    who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships
B06 1100  6    dedicated to the same goal of international understanding.
B06 1110  4       The former President blithely ignored recent history
B06 1120  4    in speaking of "dollarette" dollars under Kennedy Administration
B06 1130  3    fiscal policies. It was the Eisenhower Administration
B06 1140  1    which produced the largest peacetime deficit.
B06 1140  7       Finally, Mr& Eisenhower found nothing but confusion
B06 1150  7    in Washington. This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin
B06 1160  7    crisis, when President Eisenhower first told reporters
B06 1170  4    that Berlin could not be defended with conventional
B06 1180  1    weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out
B06 1180 11    of the picture too. The crisis has been renewed since
B06 1190  9    then but the confusion has hardly been compounded.
B06 1200  5       Ex-Presidents, relieved of accountability for policy,
B06 1210  3    sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their
B06 1220  3    words. Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff
B06 1230  1    discourses have been in that vein. Nobody can deny
B06 1230 10    the right of former Chief Executives to take part in
B06 1240  7    politics, but the American people expect them always
B06 1250  4    to remember the obligations of national leadership
B06 1260  1    and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility.
B06 1260 10    This is a matter of respect for the Presidency. Mr&
B06 1270  7    Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect
B06 1280  5    for that or for his elder statesmanship.
B06 1290  1    #QUEEN OF THE SEAS#
B06 1290  5    The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed, luxury,
B06 1300  3    and impeccable British service on the high seas. Reports
B06 1310  1    that the venerable liner, which has been in service
B06 1310 10    since 1936, was to be retired struck a nostalgic note
B06 1320  8    in many of us. But the Cunard line, influenced by unpleasant
B06 1330  5    economic facts and not sentiment, has decided to keep
B06 1340  4    the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least.
B06 1350  1       A new queen, with the prosaic title of ~Q3, had
B06 1350 11    been planned for several years to replace the Queen
B06 1360  8    Mary. The British government, concerned about the threat
B06 1370  5    of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry, had put
B06 1380  4    through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling
B06 1390  1    $50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton
B06 1390 11    passenger liner.
B06 1400  2       Since 1957, more and more trans-Atlantic passengers
B06 1410  1    have been crossing by air. Economy class fares and
B06 1410 10    charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers
B06 1420  7    to the airlines. Competition from other steamship lines
B06 1430  5    has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one-third
B06 1440  4    to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked
B06 1450  1    drop of profits on the Atlantic run.
B06 1450  8       The Cunard line has under consideration replacing
B06 1460  4    the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75,000 tons.
B06 1470  3    This would be cheaper to operate and could be used
B06 1470 13    for cruises during the lean winter months. Also under
B06 1480  9    consideration is an increased investment in Cunard
B06 1490  6    Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York.
B06 1500  4       The decline of the Cunard line from its position
B06 1510  1    of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development
B06 1520  1    in the history of transportation.
B06 1520  6    #MISSION TO VIET NAM#
B06 1520 10    Gen& Maxwell Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is
B06 1530  8    "very much encouraged" about the chances of the pro-Western
B06 1540  8    government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla
B06 1550  5    attacks comes close to an announcement that he will
B06 1560  4    not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster
B06 1570  2    the Vietnamese Army. Gen& Taylor will report to President
B06 1580  1    Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to
B06 1580 13    South Viet Nam and, judging from some of his remarks
B06 1590  9    to reporters in the Far East, he is likely to urge
B06 1600  6    a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military,
B06 1610  2    economic, political and other resources.
B06 1610  7       There was good reason for Gen& Taylor to make an
B06 1620  9    inspection trip at this time. Communist guerrillas
B06 1630  3    recently have been reported increasing their activities
B06 1640  2    and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed
B06 1640 12    a new crisis. South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next
B06 1650 10    year- more than 300,000 tons- may have been destroyed.
B06 1660  7    The Viet Cong, the Communist rebels, may have lost
B06 1670  5    their stored grain and arms factories. The rebels may
B06 1680  3    try to seize what is left of the October harvest when
B06 1680 14    the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November.
B06 1690  9       Nothing that is likely to happen, however, should
B06 1700  7    prompt the sending of United States soldiers for other
B06 1710  5    than instructional missions. The Indochina struggle
B06 1720  2    was a war to stay out of in 1954, when Gen& Ridgway
B06 1730  1    estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions
B06 1740 11    at the outset to win a war the French were losing.
B06 1750  7    It is a war to stay out of today, especially in view
B06 1760  3    of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently
B06 1770  1    does not want United States troops. He may want additional
B06 1770 11    technical help, and this should be forthcoming. South
B06 1780  8    Viet Nam has received $1,450,000,000 in United States
B06 1790  5    aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been
B06 1800  3    stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B& Johnson's
B06 1810  1    visit last May.
B06 1810  4       Gen& Taylor, the President's special military adviser,
B06 1820  4    is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb
B06 1830  3    to propaganda or pressure. It is probable that his
B06 1830 12    recommendations will be informed and workable, and
B06 1840  7    that they will not lead to involving the United States
B06 1850  5    in an Asian morass.
B06 1860  1       Gov& John M& Dalton, himself a lawyer and a man
B06 1860 11    of long service in government, spoke with rich background
B06 1870  8    and experience when he said in an address here that
B06 1880  8    lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General
B06 1890  3    Assembly, or quit accepting fees from individuals and
B06 1900  2    corporations who have controversies with or axes to
B06 1900 10    grind with the government and who are retained, not
B06 1910  7    because of their legal talents, but because of their
B06 1920  5    government influence.
B07 0010  1    #THE U& N&'S 'GRAVEST CRISIS'#
B07 0010  6    Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U& N&'s
B07 0020  5    problem of electing a temporary successor to the late
B07 0030  5    Dag Hammarskjold as "the gravest crisis the institution
B07 0040  2    has faced". Of course it is. If the decision goes wrong,
B07 0050  1    it may be- as Mr& Stevenson fears- "the first step
B07 0050 11    on the slippery path downhill" to a U& N& without operational
B07 0060 10    responsibilities and without effective meaning.
B07 0070  5       The integrity of the office not merely requires
B07 0080  5    that the Secretary General shall be, as the Charter
B07 0090  3    puts it, "the chief administrative officer of the Organization",
B07 0100  1    but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive
B07 0100 12    instructions from any government or any other authority
B07 0110  8    "external to the Organization". In other words, the
B07 0120  7    Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan, international
B07 0130  4    servant, not a political, national one. He should be,
B07 0140  4    as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was, a citizen of the
B07 0150  1    world.
B07 0150  2       The Charter does stipulate that "due regard" shall
B07 0160  1    be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on
B07 0160 11    "as wide a geographical basis as possible". The United
B07 0170  6    States and its allies have had no objection to this.
B07 0180  6    What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians
B07 0190  4    to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death
B07 0200  2    to turn the entire U& N& staff from the Secretary down
B07 0210  1    into political agents of the respective countries from
B07 0210  9    which they come.
B07 0220  1       The controversy now revolves mainly around the number
B07 0220  9    and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary
B07 0230  8    General and, more particularly, around the nature of
B07 0240  5    his relationship with them. Although the United States
B07 0250  4    and the U& S& S& R& have been arguing whether there
B07 0260  3    shall be four, five or six top assistants, the most
B07 0260 13    important element in the situation is not the number
B07 0270  9    of deputies but the manner in which these deputies
B07 0280  6    are to do their work.
B07 0280 11       If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary
B07 0290 10    General's decisions the nature of the organization
B07 0300  6    will have changed. If they give him advice when he
B07 0310  3    asks it, or if they perform specified duties under
B07 0310 12    his direction, the nature of the U& N& will not of
B07 0320 10    necessity change. The Secretary General must have,
B07 0330  6    subject to the constitutional direction of the Security
B07 0340  4    Council and the General Assembly, the power to act,
B07 0350  3    to propose action and to organize action without being
B07 0350 12    hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone
B07 0360  8    else's instructions.
B07 0370  1       This is the root issue for which the United States
B07 0370 11    should stand. We should not become confused or let
B07 0380  8    our public become confused over irrelevant questions
B07 0390  3    of number or even of geography. What we must have,
B07 0400  2    if the United Nations is to survive, is as nonpolitical,
B07 0400 12    nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings
B07 0410  9    can make it, subject to no single nation's direction
B07 0420  6    and subservient to no single nation's ambition.
B07 0430  2    #WHAT THE NEW CHARTER DOES#
B07 0430  7    The new City Charter, which should get a Yes vote as
B07 0440  8    Question No& 1 on Nov& 7, would not make a good Mayor
B07 0450  6    out of a bad one. There is no such magic in man-made
B07 0460  4    laws. But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive
B07 0470  1    powers, remove the excuse in large degree that he is
B07 0470 11    a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate, increase
B07 0480  8    his budget-making authority both as to expense and
B07 0490  6    capital budgets, and vest in him the right to reorganize
B07 0500  3    city departments in the interest of efficiency and
B07 0500 11    economy.
B07 0510  1       Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate
B07 0515  1    and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council
B07 0520  8    and the Mayor. Thus there is a clearer division of
B07 0530  7    authority, administrative and legislative. The board
B07 0540  3    is diminished in both respects, while it retains control
B07 0550  1    over zoning, franchises, pier leases, sale, leasing
B07 0550  8    and assignment of property, and other trusteeship functions.
B07 0560  7    The board will be able to increase, decrease, add or
B07 0570  6    eliminate budget items, subject to the Mayor's veto;
B07 0580  3    but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering
B07 0590  3    power. Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes
B07 0600  1    will require concurrence by board and Council, and
B07 0600  9    a two-thirds vote.
B07 0610  1       The Controller retains his essential "fiscal watchdog"
B07 0610  8    functions; his broad but little used investigative
B07 0620  7    powers are confirmed. He loses now-misplaced tax collection
B07 0630  7    duties, which go to the Finance Department. On net
B07 0640  4    balance, in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition
B07 0650  2    to the new Charter as an invasion of his office, the
B07 0650 13    Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness
B07 0660  8    to good government than he has now.
B07 0670  5       Borough Presidents, while retaining membership in
B07 0680  3    the Board of Estimate, lose their housekeeping functions.
B07 0690  1    Highways go to a new Department of Highways, sewers
B07 0690 10    to the Department of Public Works, such street cleaning
B07 0700  7    as Borough Presidents now do (in Queens and Richmond)
B07 0710  7    to the Sanitation Department.
B07 0720  1       Some fiscal changes are important. The expense (operating)
B07 0720  9    budget is to be a program budget, and red tape is cut
B07 0730 12    to allow greater autonomy (with the Mayor approving)
B07 0740  5    in fund transfers within a department. The capital
B07 0750  3    budget, for construction of permanent improvements,
B07 0750  9    becomes an appropriating document instead of just a
B07 0760  8    calendar of pious promises; but, as a second-look safeguard,
B07 0770  7    each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public
B07 0780  6    hearing before construction proceeds.
B07 0790  1       A road block to desirable local or borough improvements,
B07 0790 10    heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers
B07 0800  8    and hence a drag on progress, is removed by making
B07 0810  6    these a charge against the whole city instead of an
B07 0820  4    assessment paid by those immediately affected. This
B07 0820 11    will have a beneficial effect by expediting public
B07 0830  8    business; it will also correct some injustices.
B07 0840  4       Enlargement of the City Council and a new method
B07 0850  5    of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.
B07 0860  1    #INTER-AMERICAN PRESS#
B07 0860  4    The Inter-american Press Association, which blankets
B07 0870  3    the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape
B07 0880  1    Horn, is meeting in New York City this week for the
B07 0880 12    first time in eleven years. The I& A& P& A& is a reflection
B07 0890 11    of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere; and in
B07 0900  8    these days this inevitably means a concentration on
B07 0910  5    the effects of the Cuban revolution.
B07 0920  1       As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by
B07 0920  9    the Castro regime, more and more Cuban publishers,
B07 0930  6    editors and correspondents were forced into exile.
B07 0940  3    The I& A& P& A& found itself driven from journalism
B07 0950  1    into politics as it did its best to bring about the
B07 0950 12    downfall of the Castro Government and the return of
B07 0960  9    the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista's
B07 0970  6    dictatorship began in 1952.
B07 0980  1       Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of
B07 0980 10    decades of corruption and social imbalances. In such
B07 0990  6    conditions all freedoms are lost. This, in more diplomatic
B07 1000  5    language, is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper
B07 1010  2    men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United
B07 1010 12    States Government. He felt able to end on a note of
B07 1020 11    hope. He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year
B07 1030  8    Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social
B07 1040  5    reforms. No group can contribute more to the success
B07 1050  2    of the program than the editors and publishers of the
B07 1050 12    Inter-American Press Association.
B07 1060  3    #MEETING IN MOSCOW#
B07 1060  6    The Twenty-second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens
B07 1070  6    in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply
B07 1080  4    with the script prepared many months ago when this
B07 1090  3    meeting was first announced. According to the original
B07 1090 11    program, Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking
B07 1100  7    toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration
B07 1110  8    or rage- depending upon individual or national politics-
B07 1120  6    because of the "bold program for building communism
B07 1130  4    in our time" which the Congress will adopt. But far
B07 1140  3    from being concerned about whether or not Russia will
B07 1140 12    have achieved Utopia by 1980, the world is watching
B07 1150  9    Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not
B07 1160  8    there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future.
B07 1170  4       The evident contradiction between the rosy picture
B07 1180  2    of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's
B07 1190  1    program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed
B07 1190 10    by Premier Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led
B07 1200  7    to speculation abroad that the program may be severely
B07 1210  6    altered. Whether it is or not, the propaganda impact
B07 1220  2    on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted
B07 1230  1    at this meeting will be far less than had been originally
B07 1230 12    anticipated. And there must be many Soviet citizens
B07 1240  8    who know what is going on and who realize that before
B07 1250  6    they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980
B07 1260  3    they and their children must first survive.
B07 1260 10       This Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating
B07 1270  7    his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly
B07 1280  7    succession should death or illness remove him from
B07 1290  4    the scene in the next few years. The widespread purge
B07 1300  1    that has taken place the past twelve months or so among
B07 1300 12    Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance
B07 1310  7    that the party officials who will dominate the Congress,
B07 1320  5    and the Central Committee it will elect, will all have
B07 1330  4    passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening,
B07 1330 10    both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance
B07 1340 10    on the job.
B07 1350  1    #DR& CONANT'S CALL TO ACTION#
B07 1350  6    Dr& James B& Conant has earned a nationwide reputation
B07 1360  5    as a moderate and unemotional school reformer. His
B07 1370  2    earlier reports considered the American public schools
B07 1380  1    basically sound and not in need of drastic change.
B07 1380 10    Now, a close look at the schools in and around the
B07 1390  8    ten largest cities, including New York, has shattered
B07 1400  3    this optimism. Dr& Conant has come away shocked and
B07 1410  2    angry. His new book, entitled "Slums and Suburbs",
B07 1410 10    calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster.
B07 1420  8       There is room for disagreement concerning some of
B07 1430  5    Dr& Conant's specific views. His strong opposition
B07 1440  3    to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside
B07 1450  1    their own neighborhood, in the interest of integration,
B07 1450  9    will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for,
B07 1460  9    and achieved, this open or permissive enrollment. Dr&
B07 1470  5    Conant may underestimate the psychological importance
B07 1480  2    of even token equality.
B07 1480  6       His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made
B07 1490  6    the training institutions for medical, law and graduate
B07 1500  4    schools will run into strong opposition from these
B07 1500 12    colleges themselves- even though what he is recommending
B07 1510  7    is already taking shape as a trend.
B07 1520  5       But these are side issues to a powerful central
B07 1530  2    theme. That theme cuts through hypocrisies, complacency
B07 1530  9    and double-talk. It labels the slums, especially the
B07 1540  9    Negro slums, as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands
B07 1550  6    of youngsters. The villains of the piece are those
B07 1560  6    who deny job opportunities to these youngsters, and
B07 1570  2    Dr& Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike.
B07 1570 10    The facts, he adds, are hidden from public view by
B07 1580  9    squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their
B07 1590  5    right name and by insistence on token integration rather
B07 1600  2    than on real improvement of the schools, regardless
B07 1600 10    of the color of their students.
B07 1610  6       A call for action "before it is too late" has alarming
B07 1620  6    implications when it comes from a man who, in his previous
B07 1630  2    reports on the schools, cautioned so strongly against
B07 1630 10    extreme measures. These warnings must not be treated
B07 1640  8    lightly. Dr& Conant's conscientious, selfless efforts
B07 1650  4    deserve the nation's gratitude. He has served in positions
B07 1660  6    of greater glamour, both at home and abroad; but he
B07 1670  3    may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward
B07 1680  1    report on the state of the public schools.
B07 1690  1    #AND NOW- MORE JUNK MAIL#
B07 1690  6    A fascinating letter has just reached this desk from
B07 1700  4    a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk
B07 1700 13    mail. He was delighted to learn that the Post Office
B07 1710 10    Department is now going to expand this service to deliver
B07 1720  8    mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents
B07 1730  6    without the use of stamps, names, addresses or even
B07 1740  3    zone numbers. In accordance with legislation passed
B07 1750  1    at the last session of Congress, each Representative
B07 1750  9    is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk
B07 1760  8    newsletters, speeches and other literature to be dropped
B07 1770  5    in every letter box in his district. This means an
B07 1780  2    added burden to innumerable postmen, who already are
B07 1780 10    complaining of heavy loads and low pay, and it presumably
B07 1790 10    means an increased postal deficit, but, our correspondent
B07 1800  5    writes, think of the additional junk mail each citizen
B07 1810  4    will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.

B07 1820  2    #OUR CREDITORS DO NOT FORGET US#
B07 1820  8    Letter writing is a dying art. Occasional letters are
B07 1830  5    sent by individuals to one another and many are written
B07 1840  4    by companies to one another, but these are mostly typewritten.
B07 1850  2    Most mail these days consists of nothing that could
B07 1850 11    truly be called a letter.
B08 0010  1       Old, tired, trembling the woman came to the cannery.
B08 0010 10    She had, she said, heard that the plant was closing.
B08 0020  9    It couldn't close, she said. She had raised a calf,
B08 0030  7    grown it beef-fat. She had, with her own work-weary
B08 0040  3    hands, put seeds in the ground, watched them sprout,
B08 0040 12    bud, blossom, and get ready to bear. She was ready
B08 0050 10    to kill the beef, dress it out, and with vegetables
B08 0060  6    from her garden was going to can soup, broth, hash,
B08 0070  2    and stew against the winter. She had done it last year,
B08 0070 13    and the year before, and the year before that, and
B08 0080 10    she, and her people were dependent upon these cans
B08 0090  6    for food.
B08 0090  8       This did not happen in counties of North Georgia,
B08 0100  5    where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land.
B08 0110  3    Nor in South Georgia, where the summer sun shines warmly
B08 0120  1    and gives early life to the things growing in the flat
B08 0120 12    fields.
B08 0130  1       This happened in Decatur, DeKalb County, not 10
B08 0130  9    miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta.
B08 0140  5       And now, the woman, tired and trembling, came here
B08 0150  4    to the DeKalb County cannery. "Is it so the cannery
B08 0160  2    is going to close"?
B08 0160  6       O& N& Moss, 61, tall, grey as a possum, canning
B08 0170  6    plant chief since 1946, didn't know what to say. He
B08 0180  4    did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans
B08 0180 15    this summer. He did say he was out of cans, the No&
B08 0190 12    3's, but "I requisitioned 22,000". He said he had No&
B08 0200  7    2's enough to last two weeks more.
B08 0210  3       Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one. A
B08 0220  1    three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman
B08 0220  9    Charles O& Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery
B08 0230  8    be closed. Reason: the cannery loses $3,000 yearly.
B08 0240  6       But DeKalb citizens, those who use the facilities
B08 0250  5    of the cannery, say the cannery is not supposed to
B08 0260  2    make any money.
B08 0260  5       "The cannery", said Mrs& Lewellyn Lundeen, an active
B08 0270  4    booster of the cannery since its opening during the
B08 0280  2    war and rationing years of 1941, to handle the "victory
B08 0280 12    garden" produce, "is a service to the taxpayer. And
B08 0290  9    one of the best services available to the people who
B08 0300  6    try to raise and can meat, to plant, grow vegetables
B08 0310  3    and put them up. It helps those people who help themselves.
B08 0320  1       "The county, though, seems more interested in those
B08 0330  1    people who don't even try, those who sit and draw welfare
B08 0330 12    checks and line up for surplus food".
B08 0340  6       A driver of a dairy truck, who begins work at 1
B08 0350  5    a&m& finishes before breakfast, then goes out and grows
B08 0360  2    a garden, and who has used the cannery to save and
B08 0360 13    feed a family of five, asked, "What in the world will
B08 0370  9    we do"?
B08 0370 11       "What in the world", echoed others, those come with
B08 0380  9    the beans, potatoes, the tomatoes, "will any of us
B08 0390  7    do"?
B08 0390  8       Moss, a man who knows how much the cannery helps
B08 0400  6    the county, doesn't believe it will close. But he is
B08 0410  4    in the middle, an employe of DeKalb, but on the side
B08 0420  1    of the people.
B08 0420  4       The young married people; the old couples. The dairy
B08 0430  2    truck driver; the old woman with the stew.
B08 0430 10       "Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps", he
B08 0440 10    said. "Sir, I know the cannery helps".
B08 0460  1       Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness
B08 0460 11    comes hard. When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately
B08 0470  8    caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to
B08 0480  8    say, "Just forget it". There is one thing I know; a
B08 0490  7    person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace
B08 0500  2    as long as the heart holds a grudge. I know a man who
B08 0500 15    held resentment against a neighbor for more than three
B08 0510  9    decades. Several years ago I was his pastor. One night,
B08 0520  8    at the close of the evening service, he came forward,
B08 0530  4    left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart
B08 0540  2    to God. After almost everyone had gone he told me the
B08 0540 13    simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved
B08 0550  9    a fence a few feet over on his land.
B08 0560  3       "We tried to settle this dispute", he said, "but
B08 0570  1    could never come to an agreement. I settled it tonight",
B08 0570 11    he continued. "I leave this church with a feeling that
B08 0580  9    a great weight has been lifted off my heart, I have
B08 0590  8    left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor".
B08 0600  3       Forgiveness is the door through which a person must
B08 0610  3    pass to enter the Kingdom of God. You cannot wear the
B08 0610 14    banner of God and at the same time harbor envy, jealousy
B08 0620 11    and grudges in your heart. Henry van Dyke said, "Forgive
B08 0630  8    and forget if you can; but forgive anyway".
B08 0640  4       Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness.
B08 0650  2    We must, first of all, be willing to forgive others
B08 0650 12    before we can secure God's forgiveness. "For if ye
B08 0660  9    forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
B08 0670  5    will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their
B08 0680  5    trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses".
B08 0690  3    Matthew 6:14-15. It will do no good to seek God's forgiveness
B08 0700  3    until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.
B08 0710  1       Then, Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is
B08 0710  8    unlimited. In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples
B08 0720  8    to pray we find these words, "Forgive us our debts".
B08 0730  6    When a person meets God's requirements for the experience
B08 0740  4    of forgiveness he is forgiven. God's mercy and patience
B08 0750  3    will last forever. Forgiveness implies more than a
B08 0750 11    person wanting his past sins covered by God's love.
B08 0760  9    It also implies that a man wants his future to be free
B08 0770 10    from the mistakes of the past. We want the past forgiven,
B08 0780  6    but at the same time we must be willing for God to
B08 0790  3    direct the future.
B08 0790  6       Finally, we must be willing to forgive others as
B08 0800  3    many times as they sin against us. Once Peter asked,
B08 0810  1    "How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive
B08 0810 12    him? Till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, until
B08 0820  8    seventy times seven". Matthew 18:21-22.
B08 0830  4       Jesus not only taught forgiveness, He gave us an
B08 0840  4    example of it on the cross. With all the energy of
B08 0840 15    his broken body he prayed, "Father, forgive them, for
B08 0850  8    they know not what they do". Luke 23:34.
B08 0870  1       She's been in and out of my house for a dozen years
B08 0870 13    now, although she's still a teen-ager who looks like
B08 0880  9    a baby, she is getting married. Her mother, now dead,
B08 0890  6    was my good friend and when she came to tell us about
B08 0900  4    her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering
B08 0900 16    wish to say something meaningful to her, something
B08 0910  8    her mother would wish said. For a while there was such
B08 0920  8    shrill girlish commotion I couldn't have made myself
B08 0930  4    heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia.
B08 0940  3    But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had
B08 0940 14    been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable
B08 0950 10    to the young female- six girls sprawled on one bed,
B08 0960  7    drinking Cokes and giggling- she came back to the kitchen
B08 0970  9    to talk with me a minute.
B08 0980  1       "How do you know you love somebody enough to get
B08 0980 10    married"? she asked.
B08 0990  1       It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers
B08 0990 10    have ever asked: How can you be sure?
B08 1000  8       "Aren't you sure"? I asked, looking at her searchingly.
B08 1010  7    I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait,
B08 1020  7    to consider, to know for certain because life is so
B08 1030  3    long and marriage is so important. But if she were
B08 1030 13    just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such
B08 1040  9    a question might frighten her out of a really good
B08 1050  7    marriage. Besides, in all honesty, I don't know how
B08 1060  3    you can be sure. I don't know any secret recipe for
B08 1060 14    certainty. In the fevered, intoxicating, breathless
B08 1070  6    state of being in love the usual signposts that guide
B08 1080  6    you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes
B08 1090  3    obscured. I knew of but one test and I threw it out
B08 1100  2    to her for what it was worth.
B08 1100  9       "Does he ever bore you"? I asked.
B08 1110  3       "Bore me"? she was shocked. Oh, no-o! Why, he's
B08 1120  2    so darling and **h"
B08 1120  6       "I mean", I went on ruthlessly, "when he's not talking
B08 1130  5    about you or himself or the wonders of love, is he
B08 1140  5    interesting? Does he care about things that matter
B08 1150  1    to you? Can you visualize being stranded with him on
B08 1150 11    a desert island for years and years and still find
B08 1160  8    him fascinating?
B08 1160 10       Because, honey, I thought silently, there are plenty
B08 1170  8    of desert islands in every marriage- long periods when
B08 1180  6    you're hopelessly stranded, together. And if you bore
B08 1190  5    each other then, heaven help you.
B08 1190 11       She came back the other day to reassure me. She
B08 1200  9    has studied and observed and she is convinced that
B08 1210  5    her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.
B08 1220  1       She asked if I had other advice and, heady with
B08 1220 11    success, I rushed it in, I hope not too late. Be friends
B08 1230 12    with your mother-in-law. Jokes, cartoons and cynics
B08 1240  5    to the contrary, mothers-in-law make good friends.
B08 1260  1       I do not know Dr& Wilson Sneed well. But I was deeply
B08 1260 13    moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St&
B08 1270 10    Luke's Church in Atlanta. It was the cry of not just
B08 1280 10    one heart; it spoke for many in the clergy, I suspect.
B08 1290  6    The pulpit is a lonely place. Who stops to think of
B08 1300  4    that?
B08 1300  5       Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind
B08 1310  3    the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of
B08 1310 13    service to this majestic church. "Such a church needs
B08 1320  9    vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only
B08 1330  9    so much of these endowments", he told his members.
B08 1340  5       A minister should not stay "beyond the time that
B08 1350  3    his leadership should benefit" his church, he wrote,
B08 1350 11    "**h for he becomes ordinary **h". @
B08 1360  7    ##
B08 1360  8    And so the young minister resigned, to go and study
B08 1370  6    and pray, having never passed a day, he told his parishioners,
B08 1380  4    when "I did not gain from you far more than I ever
B08 1390  3    gave to you".
B08 1390  6       His very honest act called up the recent talk I
B08 1400  3    had with another minister, a modest Methodist, who
B08 1400 11    said: "I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give
B08 1410 12    a message of love and comfort to other men, and I would
B08 1420  9    have it no other way: and it is unworthy to think of
B08 1430  7    self. But oh, how I do sometimes need just a moment
B08 1440  3    of rest, and peace, in myself".
B08 1440  9       A man who gives himself to God and to the believers
B08 1450  8    of his church takes upon himself a life of giving.
B08 1460  5    He does not expect to get great riches or he would
B08 1470  1    not have chosen to answer the call to preach. The good
B08 1470 12    ones are not motivated to seek vainly, nor are they
B08 1480  8    disposed to covet comfort, or they would have been
B08 1490  4    led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity. Theirs
B08 1500  2    is a sacrificial life by earthly standards.
B08 1500  9    ##
B08 1500 10    Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from
B08 1510 10    him and expect interpretation of the infinite through
B08 1520  5    him- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due,
B08 1530  4    we of the congregations are the first to tell him what
B08 1530 15    is in our minds instead of listening to what is in
B08 1540 11    his soul. We press him to conform to our comfortable
B08 1550  7    conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with
B08 1560  2    his word, and God's. We do not defeat the good ones
B08 1570  1    with this cruelty, but we add to their burden, while
B08 1570 11    expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return
B08 1580  8    for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks
B08 1590  5    a week, American cash. If we break the minister to
B08 1600  2    our bit, we are buying back our own sins. If he won't
B08 1600 14    break, we add to the stress he bears.
B08 1610  7       And a minister of all men is most conscious that
B08 1620  3    he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly
B08 1630  1    humanity is heir to. We expect him to be noble, and
B08 1630 12    to make us so- yet he knows, and tries to tell us,
B08 1640  9    how very humble man must be.
B08 1650  1       We expect bestowal of God's love through him. But
B08 1650 10    how little love we give him. The church truly is not
B08 1660  9    a rest home for saints, but a hospital for sinners.
B08 1670  4    Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room
B08 1680  2    to receive first aid, and we leave unmindful that the
B08 1680 12    man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers,
B08 1690 10    too.
B09 0010  1       Mr& Podger always particularly enjoyed the last
B09 0010  8    night of each summer at Loon Lake. The narrow fringe
B09 0020  8    of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure.
B09 0030  6       The evening was not always spent in the same way.
B09 0040  6    This year, on a night cool with the front of September
B09 0050  1    moving in, but with plenty of summer still about, the
B09 0050 11    Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the
B09 0060  8    Pod. The little cottage was bursting with people of
B09 0070  6    all ages.
B09 0070  8       In the midst of it all, Mr& Podger came out on the
B09 0080  7    Pod porch, alone. He had that day attended a country
B09 0090  4    auction, and he had come back with a prize.
B09 0100  1       The prize was an old-fashioned, woven cloth hammock,
B09 0100  9    complete with cross-top pillow, fringed side pieces,
B09 0110  5    and hooks for hanging. Mrs& Podger had obligingly pushed
B09 0120  4    things around on the porch to make room for it, and
B09 0130  3    there it was, slung in a vine-shaded corner, the night
B09 0130 14    breeze rippling its fringe with a slow, caressing movement.
B09 0140  9       Mr& Podger sat down in it, pushed himself back and
B09 0150 10    forth in one or two slow, rhythmic motions, and then
B09 0160  6    swung his feet up into it. He closed his eyes and let
B09 0170  5    the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly
B09 0180  1    over him. Suddenly one young voice rose above the others.
B09 0180 11    "But", it said, "do you always know when you're happy"?
B09 0200  1       The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound,
B09 0200 11    but the question stayed in Mr& Podger's mind. Here,
B09 0210  7    in the cool, autumn-touched evening, Mr& Podger mentally
B09 0220  5    retraced a day that had left him greatly contented
B09 0230  2    and at peace.
B09 0230  5    #@#
B09 0230  6    It had begun with the blue jay feather. Walking along
B09 0240  4    the lake before breakfast, Mr& Podger had seen the
B09 0250  3    feather, and the bird that had lost it in flight. The
B09 0250 14    winging spread of blue had gone on, calling harshly,
B09 0260  9    into the wood. The small shaft of blue had drifted
B09 0270  7    down and come to rest at his feet. All day long Mr&
B09 0280  4    Podger, who was a straw-hat man in the summer, had
B09 0285  1    worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield.
B09 0290 11    Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy
B09 0300  9    all day? Hardly. But it was something to have seen
B09 0310  6    it floating down through the early morning sunshine,
B09 0320  2    linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters
B09 0320 14    by the lake.
B09 0330  3       Then, since the auction was being held nearby, he
B09 0330 12    had walked to it. And there, on the way, had been the
B09 0340 12    box turtle, that slow, self-contained, world-ignoring
B09 0350  6    relic of pre-history, bent, for reasons best known
B09 0360  4    to itself, on crossing the road. It was doing very
B09 0370  1    well, too, having reached the center, and was pursuing
B09 0370 10    its way with commendable singleness of purpose when
B09 0380  5    Mr& Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a
B09 0390  6    flashy little sports car. Would the driver see the
B09 0400  2    turtle? Would he take pains to avoid it?
B09 0400 10       Mr& Podger took no chances. Taking off his hat and
B09 0410  9    signaling the driver with it, Mr& Podger stepped into
B09 0420  6    the road, lifted the surprised turtle and consummated
B09 0430  3    its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking
B09 0440  1    suddenness.
B09 0440  2       The turtle immediately withdrew into its private
B09 0450  1    council room to study the phenomenon. But Mr& Podger
B09 0450 10    and the driver of the sports car waved at each other.
B09 0460 10    Here in the cool darkness Mr& Podger could still feel
B09 0470  6    the warmth of midday, could still see the yellow butterflies
B09 0480  5    dancing over the road, could still see the friendly
B09 0490  2    grin on the young, sun-browned face as the driver looked
B09 0490 13    back over his shoulder for a moment before the car
B09 0500 10    streaked out of sight.
B09 0510  1       Where was the driver now? What was he doing? And
B09 0510 11    the turtle? Mr& Podger smiled. For a few brief minutes
B09 0520  9    they had all been part of one little drama. The three
B09 0530  8    would never meet again, but for some reason or other
B09 0540  5    Mr& Podger was sure he would always remember the incident.
B09 0550  3       Then there had been the auction itself. Mr& Podger
B09 0560  2    heard again, at will, the voice of the auctioneer,
B09 0560 11    the voices of the bidders, and finally the small boy
B09 0570  9    who had been so interested in Mr& Podger's hammock
B09 0580  5    purchase.
B09 0580  6       "I like them things, too", he had said. "We got
B09 0590  7    one at home. You know what? If you're lyin' out in
B09 0600  5    the hammock at night, and it gets kinda cool- you know-
B09 0610  5    you just take these sides with the fringe on- see-
B09 0620  1    and wrap 'em right over you. I do it, lots o' times-
B09 0620 13    I like to lie in a hammock at night, by myself, when
B09 0630 10    it's all quiet. **h The wind moves it a little bit-
B09 0640  7    you know **h".
B09 0640 10    #@#
B09 0640 11    Mr& Podger had thanked him gravely, and now he made
B09 0650  8    use of the advice. As he pulled the fringed sides up
B09 0660  5    and made himself into a cocoon, Mr& Podger saw that
B09 0670  3    thin, attractive, freckled little face again, and hoped
B09 0670 11    that the boy, too, was lying in a cool, fringed-wrapped
B09 0680 11    quiet.
B09 0680 12       Alacrity, the Podger cat, came by the hammock, rubbed
B09 0690  9    her back briefly against it, and then, sure of a welcome,
B09 0700  9    hopped up. She remarked that she found the night wind
B09 0710  6    a little chilly, and Mr& Podger took her inside the
B09 0720  3    fringe. Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the
B09 0720 12    tree crickets, rivaled the hum of voices from inside
B09 0730  9    the Pod.
B09 0730 11       Mr& Podger was just adding this to his pictures
B09 0740  9    of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst
B09 0750  6    out. "Dad"! she said. "It's getting so chilly we've
B09 0760  5    lighted a fire, and we're going to tell a round robin
B09 0770  4    story- a nice, scary one. We need you to start it.
B09 0770 15    Why are you out here all by yourself? Aren't you happy"?
B09 0790  1       Mr& Podger opened his cocoon and emerged, tucking
B09 0790  9    Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire.
B09 0800 10    "Of course I am", he said. "Never happier in my life.
B09 0810  6    I just came out here to know it".
B09 0820  1    _DALLAS_
B09 0820  2       As the South begins another school year, national
B09 0820 10    and even world attention is directed at the region's
B09 0840  7    slow progress toward racial equality in the public
B09 0850  5    schools.
B09 0850  6       Desegregation is beginning in two more important
B09 0860  4    Southern cities- Dallas and Atlanta. In each city civic
B09 0870  3    and education leaders have been working hard to get
B09 0870 12    public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability
B09 0880  7    of equal treatment.
B09 0890  1       These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial
B09 0890  8    classrooms peacefully. The programs do not take sides
B09 0900  7    on the issue itself. They point out simply that "it
B09 0910  5    is the law of the land".
B09 0910 11       The two cities have the examples of Little Rock
B09 0920  8    and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting
B09 0930  5    to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation.
B09 0940  3    Even better, they have the examples of Nashville and
B09 0950  2    Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.
B09 0960  1       In each case there was an initial act of violence.
B09 0960 11    In Nashville, a school was dynamited. In Houston, there
B09 0970  7    were a few incidents of friction between whites and
B09 0980  4    Negroes, none of which were serious.
B09 0990  1       In each city quick public reaction and fast action
B09 0990  9    by the city government halted the threats of more serious
B09 1000  7    incidents.
B09 1000  8       The Nashville plan, incidentally, has become recognized
B09 1010  6    as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical
B09 1020  6    to put into effect in the troubled South. It is a "stair-step"
B09 1030  6    plan, in which desegregation begins in the first grade.
B09 1040  4    Each year another grade is added to the process, until
B09 1050  1    finally all 12 grades are integrated. The schedules
B09 1050  9    are flexible so that the program can be accelerated
B09 1060  8    as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that
B09 1070  4    it is something that has to be done, "so why not now".
B09 1080  3       The program has worked well in both Nashville and
B09 1090  1    Houston. It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans, where
B09 1090 11    the two schools selected for the first moves toward
B09 1100  7    integration were boycotted by white parents. Another
B09 1110  4    attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume
B09 1120  3    the program.
B09 1120  5       Generally, throughout the South, there is a growing
B09 1130  2    impatience with the pattern of violence with which
B09 1130 10    every step of desegregation is met.
B09 1140  6       Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of
B09 1150  4    racial barriers has been in Dallas. During the summer,
B09 1160  1    Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated
B09 1160  7    restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments.
B09 1170  8    It was part of a citywide move toward full integration.
B09 1180  8       So successful has been this program, worked out
B09 1190  6    by white and Negro civic leaders, that further extensions
B09 1200  3    are expected in the next few months. Hotels, for example,
B09 1210  2    are ready to let down the bars. Already, at least one
B09 1210 13    hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial
B09 1220  9    basis. Several conventions have been held in recent
B09 1230  6    months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis.
B09 1240  2       This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions
B09 1250  1    which prevailed several years ago, when a series of
B09 1250 10    bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving
B09 1260  6    into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas.
B09 1270  3       It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which
B09 1280  2    appears to be spreading all across the South. Southern
B09 1290  1    whites themselves are realizing that they had been
B09 1290  9    wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from
B09 1300  7    claiming equal rights. They insist they are ashamed
B09 1310  4    of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama
B09 1320  1    when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial
B09 1320 10    discrimination in local bus depots.
B09 1330  5       All across the South there are signs that racial
B09 1340  3    violence is finding less approval among whites who
B09 1340 11    themselves would never take active part but might once
B09 1350  9    have shown a tolerant attitude toward it.
B09 1360  4       There are many causes for this change. One of the
B09 1370  3    most important is economic. Business leaders are aware
B09 1370 11    now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence.
B09 1380 10    They are putting strong pressure on their police departments
B09 1390  7    to keep order. In the past these same Southerners were
B09 1400  6    inclined to look the other way.
B09 1410  1       And as the businessmen have begun to act, a real
B09 1410 11    sense of co-operation has sprung up. This co-operation
B09 1420  7    has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices
B09 1430  5    to demands for peaceable accommodation. They realize
B09 1440  2    that by acting in concert, rather than individually,
B09 1440 10    they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation-
B09 1450  9    economic and otherwise.
B09 1470  1       Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California
B09 1470 10    a few months ago, I've been introduced to a new game
B09 1480 11    called Lanesmanship. Played mostly on the freeways
B09 1490  6    around Los Angeles, it goes like this:
B09 1500  2       A driver cruising easily at 70 m&p&h& in Lane ~A
B09 1510  2    of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam
B09 1510 12    ahead. Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving
B09 1520  9    more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane
B09 1530  6    ~B, which is heavily populated by cars also moving
B09 1540  3    at 70 m&p&h&.
B09 1540  6       The adjacent driver in Lane ~B has three choices
B09 1550  5    open to him. He can (1) point his car resolutely at
B09 1560  2    the invading fender and force the other driver back
B09 1560 11    into Lane ~A; (2) slow down and permit the ambivalent
B09 1570  9    driver to change lanes; or (3) alternately accelerate
B09 1580  5    and decelerate, thus keeping the first driver guessing
B09 1590  4    as to his intentions, thereby making a fascinating
B09 1600  1    sport of the whole affair.
B09 1600  6       The really remarkable thing to me is that most California
B09 1610  6    natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit
B09 1620  3    the invading car free access. Whether or not this is
B09 1620 13    done out of enlightened self-preservation, I don't
B09 1630  8    know. But it is done, consistently and I'm both surprised
B09 1640  6    and impressed.
B09 1640  8    #@#
B09 1640  9    This could never happen in my native Chicago. There
B09 1650  9    such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure
B09 1660  8    sign of deteriorating manhood. In Chicago, the driver
B09 1670  4    cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor
B09 1680  1    in an effort to force the other car back. Failing this,
B09 1680 12    he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and
B09 1690  7    shake his fist threateningly.
B09 1700  1       This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways,
B09 1700  9    however, does an injustice to Southern California drivers.
B09 1710  8    At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall
B09 1720  9    Field and Company, I would like to challenge an old
B09 1730  6    and hallowed stereotype. After three months of research,
B09 1750  3    I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers
B09 1750 11    are considerably more courteous and competent than
B09 1760  7    any other drivers I've ever encountered.
B09 1770  3       During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles
B09 1780  2    there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming
B09 1780 10    drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit
B09 1790  9    me to pull out of an impossible side street.
B10 0010  1    _MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17._
B10 0010  5       An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today
B10 0020  3    and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball
B10 0030  1    club would be improved this year.
B10 0030  7       Now Richards, of course, is known as a deep thinker
B10 0040  6    as baseball managers go. He can often make the complex
B10 0050  2    ridiculously simple, and vice versa. This happened
B10 0050  9    to be vice versa, but even so, the answer was a masterpiece.
B10 0060  4       "It's a whole lot easier", he said, "to increase
B10 0070  3    the population of Nevada, than it is to increase the
B10 0080  1    population of New York city". And with that he walked
B10 0080 11    off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher.
B10 0090  6       "That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote", said the
B10 0100  6    writer, scratching his head. "Now, if I can just figure
B10 0110  4    out what he's talking about, I'll use it".
B10 0120  1    #TWO SPOTS OPEN#
B10 0120  3    This was just Richard's way of saying that last year
B10 0130  2    the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs
B10 0130 12    wide open. Some brilliant rookies nailed them down,
B10 0140  7    so that this spring just two spots, left and right
B10 0150  5    field, are really up for grabs.
B10 0150 11       It should be easier to plug two spots than it was
B10 0160 10    to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year,
B10 0170  6    but so far it hasn't worked that way.
B10 0180  1       This angle of just where the Orioles can look for
B10 0180 11    improvement this year is an interesting one. You'd
B10 0190  7    never guess it from the way they've played so far this
B10 0200  5    spring, but there remains a feeling among some around
B10 0210  2    here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle
B10 0210 12    for the pennant in 1961.
B10 0220  4       Obviously, if this club is going to move from second
B10 0230  2    to first in the American League, it will have to show
B10 0230 13    improvement someplace. Where can that improvement possibly
B10 0240  7    come from?
B10 0250  1       You certainly can't expect the infield to do any
B10 0250 10    better than it did last year.
B10 0260  5    #ROBBY COULD BE BETTER#
B10 0260  9    Brooks Robinson is great, and it is conceivable that
B10 0270  6    he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960. You
B10 0280  5    can't expect it, though. Robby's performance last year
B10 0290  2    was tremendous.
B10 0290  4       It's the same with Ron Hansen and jim Gentile. If
B10 0300  4    they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no
B10 0310  1    complaint. They shouldn't be asked to carry any more
B10 0310 10    of the burden.
B10 0320  1       Hansen will be getting a late spring training start,
B10 0320 10    which might very well set him back. He got off to an
B10 0330 11    exceptional start last season, and under the circumstances
B10 0340  5    probably won't duplicate it.
B10 0350  1       There are some clubs which claim they learned something
B10 0350 10    about pitching to him last year. They don't expect
B10 0360  8    to stop him, just slow him down some with the bat.
B10 0370  6    He'll still be a top player, they concede, because
B10 0380  2    he's got a great glove and the long ball going for
B10 0380 13    him. But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive
B10 0390  9    production.
B10 0390 10    #BREEDING MIGHT MOVE UP#
B10 0400  4    Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs.
B10 0410  1    Don't ask him more.
B10 0410  5       I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch.
B10 0420  4    But even so, he had a good year in 1960 and won't do
B10 0430  1    too much better.
B10 0430  4       So, all in all, the infield can't be expected to
B10 0440  2    supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from
B10 0440 11    second to first.
B10 0450  3       And the pitching will also have trouble doing better.
B10 0470  1    Richards got a great performance out of his combination
B10 0470 10    of youth and experience last season.
B10 0480  4       Where, then, can we look for improvement?
B10 0500  1       "From Triandos, Brandt and Walker", answers Richards.
B10 0510  1    "They're the ones we can expect to do better".
B10 0510 10       The man is right, and at this time, indications
B10 0520  9    are that these three are ready for better seasons.
B10 0530  5       Triandos hasn't proved it yet, but he says he's
B10 0540  4    convinced his thumb is all right. He jammed it this
B10 0550  1    spring and has had to rest it, but he says the old
B10 0550 13    injury hasn't bothered him. If he can bounce back with
B10 0560  8    one of those 25 home runs years, the club will have
B10 0570  5    to be better off offensively.
B10 0570 10       I'm still not convinced, though, I'll have to see
B10 0580  8    more of him before predicting that big year for him.
B10 0590  6    Hank Foiles, backed up by Frank House who will be within
B10 0610  5    calling distance in the minors, make up better second
B10 0620  1    line catching than the Birds had all last year, but
B10 0620 11    Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking
B10 0630 10    pennant.
B10 0630 11       To me, Brandt looks as though he could be in for
B10 0640  9    a fine year. He hasn't played too much, because Richards
B10 0650  5    has been working on him furiously in batting practice.
B10 0660  2    He's hitting the ball hard, in the batting cage, and
B10 0670  1    his whole attitude is improved over this time last
B10 0670 10    year.
B10 0670 11       When he came to Baltimore, he was leaving a team
B10 0680 10    which was supposed to win the National League pennant,
B10 0690  5    and he was joining what seemed to be a second division
B10 0700  4    American League club. He was down, hard to talk to,
B10 0710  1    and far too nonchalant on the field. As of now, that
B10 0710 12    all seems behind him. He's been entirely different
B10 0720  6    all spring.
B10 0720  8       And Walker looks stronger, seems to be throwing
B10 0730  7    better than he did last year. Let him bounce back,
B10 0740  4    and he could really set up the staff.
B10 0740 12       So, if the Orioles are to improve, Brandt, Triandos
B10 0750  9    and Walker will have to do it.
B10 0760  4       So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't
B10 0770  1    seem capable of carrying the load.
B10 0770  7       Of course, this isn't taking into consideration
B10 0780  4    the population of Nevada and New York city, but it's
B10 0790  4    the way things look from here at this point.
B10 0800  1       Is the mother of an "autistic" child at fault? (The
B10 0800 11    "autistic" child is one who seems to lack a well-defined
B10 0810 11    sense of self. He tends to treat himself and other
B10 0820  8    people as if they were objects- and sometimes he treats
B10 0830  7    objects as if they were people.) Did his mother make
B10 0840  3    him this way?
B10 0840  6       Some people believe she did.
B10 0850  1       We think differently. We believe that autism, like
B10 0850  9    so many other conditions of defect and deviation, is
B10 0860  6    to a large extent inborn. A mother can help a child
B10 0870  5    adapt to his difficulties.
B10 0870  9       Sometimes she can- to a large extent- help him overcome
B10 0880  8    them. But we don't think she creates them. We don't
B10 0890  6    think she can make her child defective, emotionally
B10 0900  2    disturbed or autistic.
B10 0900  5       The mother of a difficult child can do a great deal
B10 0910  7    to help her own child and often, by sharing her experiences,
B10 0920  3    she can help other mothers with the same problem. Since
B10 0930  2    little is known about autism, and almost nothing has
B10 0930 11    been written for the layman, we'd like to share one
B10 0940  9    experienced mother's comments. She wrote:
B10 0950  3    #TOTAL DISINTEREST#
B10 0950  5    "As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking
B10 0960  5    in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything, I
B10 0970  2    have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he
B10 0980  1    first plays with a new toy. He wants me to do everything
B10 0990 12    for him.
B10 1000  1       "You don't believe that autistic children become
B10 1000  7    autistic because of something that happens to them
B10 1010  6    or because of the way their mother treats them. But
B10 1020  3    I do and my psychiatrist does, too. I know, that my
B10 1030  1    son wants control and direction, but being autistic
B10 1030  9    myself I cannot give full control or direction.
B10 1040  5       "One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned.
B10 1050  5    This is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact
B10 1060  3    with others- for instance, my children and I. When
B10 1070  2    I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms
B10 1070 14    until he is as straight and stiff as a board. He pushes
B10 1080 10    and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling
B10 1090  8    of being held. Physical contact is uncomforatble for
B10 1100  3    him"!
B10 1100  4       This mother is quite correct. As a rule, the autistic
B10 1110  5    child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others. Parents
B10 1120  2    have to find other ways of comforting him. For the
B10 1120 12    young child this may be no more than providing food,
B10 1130 10    light or movement. As he grows older it may be a matter
B10 1140  9    of providing some accustomed object (his "magic" thing).
B10 1150  4    Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go
B10 1160  3    through may do the trick. The answer is different for
B10 1160 13    each autistic child, but for most there is an answer.
B10 1170  9    Only ingenuity will uncover it.
B10 1180  2    #WHAT FUTURE HOLDS#
B10 1180  5    "Dear Doctors: We learned this year that our older
B10 1190  5    son, Daniel, is autistic. We did not accept the diagnosis
B10 1200  2    at once, but gradually we are coming to. Fortunately,
B10 1200 11    there is a nursery school which he has been able to
B10 1210 11    attend, with a group of normal children.
B10 1220  4       "I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal, though
B10 1230  2    of course I realize he is far from that at present.
B10 1230 13    What I do is to try to bring him into contact with
B10 1240 12    reality as much as possible. I try to give him as many
B10 1250  8    normal experiences as possible.
B10 1260  1       "What is your experience with autistic children?
B10 1260  8    How do they turn out later"?
B10 1270  4       Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively
B10 1280  2    normal lives. Certainly, most continue to lack a certain
B10 1280 11    warmth in communication with other people, but many
B10 1290  8    adjust to school, even college, to jobs and even to
B10 1300  7    marriage and parenthood.
B10 1300 10    #SINGLE-COLOR USE#
B10 1320  1    _QUESTION_
B10 1320  1       - A first grader colors pictures one solid color,
B10 1330  1    everything- sky, grass, boy, wagon, etc&. When different
B10 1330  8    colors are used, she is just as likely to color trees
B10 1340 11    purple, hair green, etc&.
B10 1350  2       The other children in the class use this same coloring
B10 1360  1    book and do a fairly good job with things their proper
B10 1360 12    color. Should I show my daughter how things should
B10 1370  8    be colored? She is an aggressive, nervous child. Is
B10 1380  4    a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow
B10 1390  3    these traits?
B10 1390  5    _ANSWER_
B10 1390  6       - Her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying
B10 1400  6    the motor act of coloring, without having reached the
B10 1410  3    point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.
B10 1420  1    This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is
B10 1420 11    a little immature for the first grade.
B10 1430  5       No, coloring isn't exactly something you teach a
B10 1440  4    child. You sometimes give them a little demonstration,
B10 1450  1    a little guidance, and suggestions about staying inside
B10 1450  9    the lines. But most learn to color and paint as and
B10 1460  9    when they are ready with only a very little demonstration.
B10 1480  1       SEEN in decorating circles of late is a renewed
B10 1480 10    interest in an old art: embroidery. Possibly responsible
B10 1490  8    for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes
B10 1500  5    in rooms, which seems slated to replace the one-color
B10 1510  5    look to which we have been accustomed. Just as a varitinted
B10 1520  3    Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room
B10 1520 13    scheme, so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.
B10 1530 10       One such, in fact, is a rug. Though not actually
B10 1540  9    crewel embroidery, it has that look with its over-stitched
B10 1550  7    raised pattern in blue, pink, bronze and gold and a
B10 1560  5    sauterne background. The twirled, stylized design of
B10 1570  1    winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the
B10 1570  9    embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery
B10 1580  6    during the Jacobean period in England.
B10 1590  2       Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be
B10 1590  9    appearing more frequently this fall than in the past
B10 1600  9    few years is still available in this country. The work
B10 1610  6    is executed in England (by hand) and can be worked
B10 1620  4    in any desired design and color.
B10 1620 10       Among some recent imports were seat covers for one
B10 1630  7    series of dining room chairs on which were depicted
B10 1640  4    salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and
B10 1650  2    another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic
B10 1650 12    color.
B10 1660  1    #CHINESE INFLUENCE#
B10 1660  3    For a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection
B10 1670  3    of fine English Chippendale furniture, fabric wall
B10 1670 10    panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired
B10 1680  8    design of this revered Eighteenth Century period. Since
B10 1690  6    the work is done by hand, the only limitation, it is
B10 1700  6    said, "is that of human conception".
B10 1710  1       Modern embroidered panels, framed and meant to be
B10 1710  9    hung on the wall, are another aspect of this trend.
B10 1720  8    These have never gone out of style in Scandinavian
B10 1730  4    homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there
B10 1740  2    in shops which specialize in handicrafts. An amateur
B10 1740 10    decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long
B10 1750 11    winter evenings, and, by picking up her living room
B10 1760  6    color scheme, add a decorative do-it-yourself note
B10 1770  2    to the room.
B11 0010  1       California Democrats this weekend will take the
B11 0010  8    wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which
B11 0020  6    they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district
B11 0030  5    headquarters, party clubrooms and workers' backyards.
B11 0040  2       They seem darned proud of it.
B11 0040  8       And they're confident that the ~GOP, currently assailed
B11 0050  7    by dissensions within the ranks, will be impressed
B11 0060  7    by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled
B11 0070  5    machine.
B11 0070  6    #@#
B11 0070  7    Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled
B11 0080  5    as a conference of the California Democratic Council
B11 0090  3    directorate. But it will include 200-odd officeholders,
B11 0100  1    organization leaders and "interested party people".
B11 0110  1       Out of this session may come:
B11 0110  7    _1_
B11 0110  8       - Plans for a dramatic, broad-scale party rally
B11 0120  5    in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer
B11 0130  3    Democrats from all over the country.
B11 0130  9    _2_
B11 0130 10       - Blueprints for doubling the ~CDC's present 55,000
B11 0140  7    enrollment.
B11 0150  1    _3_
B11 0150  3       - Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing
B11 0150 10    convention in Fresno next Jan& 26-28.
B11 0160  6    _4_
B11 0160  7       - And proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking
B11 0170  5    conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional districts.
B11 0180  2       At the head of the ~CDC is an unorthodox, 39-year-old
B11 0190  4    amateur politico, Thomas B& Carvey Jr&, whose normal
B11 0200  3    profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon
B11 0210  1    missiles. He's approached his Democratic duties in
B11 0210  8    hard-nosed engineering fashion.
B11 0220  2    #@#
B11 0220  3    Viewed from afar, the ~CDC looks like a rather stalwart
B11 0230  4    political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out
B11 0240  1    into an array of district leaders and standing committees,
B11 0240 10    and thence into its component clubs and affiliated
B11 0250  7    groups- 500 or so.
B11 0260  1       Much of its strength stems from the comfortable
B11 0260  8    knowledge that every "volunteer" Democratic organization
B11 0270  4    of any consequence belongs to the ~CDC.
B11 0280  3    #@#
B11 0280  4    Moreover, the entire state Democratic hierarchy, from
B11 0290  2    Gov& Brown on down to the county chairmen, also participates
B11 0300  1    in this huge operation.
B11 0300  5       Contrarily, Republican "volunteers" go their separate
B11 0310  4    ways, and thus far have given no indication that they'd
B11 0320  3    be willing to join forces under a single directorate,
B11 0330  1    except in the most loose-knit fashion.
B11 0330  8       Carvey believes that reapportionment, which left
B11 0350  3    many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries,
B11 0360  2    actually will increase ~CDC membership. Where only
B11 0370  2    one club existed before, he says, two will flourish
B11 0370 11    henceforth.
B11 0380  1       Biggest organizational problem, he adds, is setting
B11 0380  8    up ~CDC units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory.
B11 0390  7    Paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that
B11 0400  6    register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's favor, strongest
B11 0410  3    where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly
B11 0420  1    even basis.
B11 0420  3       Like most Democratic spokesmen, Carvey predicts
B11 0430  1    1962 will be a tremendously "partisan year". Hence
B11 0430  9    the attention they're lavishing on the ~CDC.
B11 0440  6       In all probability, the council will screen and
B11 0450  5    endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress,
B11 0460  2    and then strive to put its full weight behind these
B11 0460 12    pre-primary favorites. This bodes heated contests in
B11 0470  7    several districts where claims have already been staked
B11 0480  6    out by Democratic hopefuls who don't see eye-to-eye
B11 0490  5    with the ~CDC.
B11 0490  8       Naturally, the statewide races will provide the
B11 0500  5    major test for the expanding council.
B11 0510  1       Shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John
B11 0510  8    F& Kennedy last year, who relegated it to a somewhat
B11 0520  8    subordinate role in the Presidential campaign, the
B11 0530  3    ~CDC plainly intends to provide the party's campaign
B11 0540  2    muscle in 1962. There is evidence that it will be happily
B11 0540 13    received by Gov& Brown and the other constitutional
B11 0550  8    incumbents.
B11 0550  9    #@#
B11 0560  1    Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would
B11 0560  9    be Brown's most formidable foe, with ex-Gov& Knight
B11 0570  8    a close second. But the rest of the ~GOP gubernatorial
B11 0580  8    aspirants don't worry him very much.
B11 0590  4       In his ~CDC work, Carvey has the close-in support
B11 0600  2    and advice of one of California's shrewdest political
B11 0600 10    strategists: former Democratic National Committeeman
B11 0610  5    Paul Ziffren, who backed him over a Northland candidate
B11 0620  8    espoused by Atty& Gen& Stanley Mosk. (Significantly,
B11 0630  4    bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk
B11 0640  4    moving into the national committee post over Ziffren
B11 0650  1    are still audible in party circles.)
B11 0650  7    #@#
B11 0650  8    NOTE: We've just received an announcement of the 54th
B11 0660  8    Assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention
B11 0670  3    Wednesday night in South Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg&,
B11 0680  5    which graphically illustrates the ~CDC's broad appeal.
B11 0690  4    State Sen& Dick Richards will keynote; state and county
B11 0710  1    committeemen, ~CDC directors and representatives, members
B11 0720  2    of 16 area clubs, and "all residents" have been invited.
B11 0740  1       This is going to be a language lesson, and you can
B11 0740 12    master it in a few minutes. It is a short course in
B11 0750 10    Communese.
B11 0750 11       It works with English, Russian, German, Hungarian
B11 0760  6    or almost any other foreign tongue. Once you learn
B11 0770  5    how to translate Communese, much of each day's deluge
B11 0780  3    of news will become clearer. At least, I have found
B11 0780 13    it so.
B11 0790  2    #@#
B11 0790  3    For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated
B11 0800  1    Dr& Freud, Communists of all shapes and sizes almost
B11 0800 10    invariably impute to others the very motives which
B11 0810  8    they harbor themselves. They accuse their enemies of
B11 0820  5    precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most
B11 0830  3    guilty.
B11 0830  4       President Kennedy's latest warning to the Communist
B11 0840  2    world that the United States will build up its military
B11 0850  1    strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere
B11 0850 10    was somewhat surprisingly, reported in full text or
B11 0860  6    fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain. Then
B11 0870  4    the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces
B11 0890  1    with striking consistency.
B11 0890  4       Now listen closely:
B11 0900  1       Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English
B11 0900  8    to England:
B11 0910  1    #@#
B11 0910  2    "President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet
B11 0910  9    proposals, to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a
B11 0920 10    threat, as part of the world menace allegedly looming
B11 0930  6    over the countries of capitalism. Evidently the war
B11 0940  3    drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred
B11 0960  1    up in the West have been planned long in advance. The
B11 0960 12    West Berlin crisis is being played up artificially
B11 0970  7    because it is needed by the United States to justify
B11 0980  5    its arms drive".
B11 0980  8       The Soviet news agency ~TASS datelined from New
B11 0990  6    York in English to Europe:
B11 1000  1       "President Kennedy's enlargement of the American
B11 1000  7    military program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus
B11 1010 10    to the American munitions industry. When the stock
B11 1020  6    exchange opened this morning, many dealers were quick
B11 1030  5    to purchase shares in Douglas, Lockheed and United
B11 1040  2    Aircraft and prices rose substantially. Over 4 million
B11 1040 10    shares were sold, the highest figures since early June.
B11 1050  9    (Quotations follow".)
B11 1060  1       ~TASS datelined Los Angeles, in English to Europe:
B11 1070  1       "Former Vice President Nixon came out in support
B11 1070  9    of President Kennedy's program for stepping up the
B11 1080  8    arms race. He also demanded that Kennedy take additional
B11 1090  6    measures to increase international tension: specifically
B11 1100  3    to crush the Cuban revolution, resume nuclear testing,
B11 1110  3    resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful
B11 1120  1    seat in the United Nations, and postpone non-military
B11 1120 10    programs at home".
B11 1130  2       ~TASS from Moscow in English to Europe:
B11 1140  1       "The American press clamored for many days promising
B11 1140  9    President Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic
B11 1150  9    and foreign problems confronting the United States.
B11 1160  5    In fact, the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling,
B11 1170  4    the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors
B11 1180  2    of the current President. If there were no West Berlin
B11 1190  1    problem, imperialist quarters would have invented an
B11 1190  8    excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to
B11 1200  8    solve the internal and external problems besetting
B11 1210  2    the United States and its ~NATO partners. Washington
B11 1220  1    apparently decided to use an old formula, by injecting
B11 1220 10    large military appropriations to speed the slow revival
B11 1230  8    of the U&S& economy after a prolonged slump".
B11 1240  5    #@#
B11 1240  6    And now, for Communist listeners and readers:
B11 1250  4       Moscow Radio in Russian to the ~USSR:
B11 1260  1       "The U&S& President has shown once again that the
B11 1270  2    United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin
B11 1270 11    crisis to justify the armaments race. As was to be
B11 1280 10    expected Kennedy's latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm
B11 1290  6    by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn, where officials
B11 1300  3    of the West German government praised it".
B11 1310  1       Moscow Novosti article in Russian, datelined London:
B11 1320  1       "U&S& pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria
B11 1320  9    over the status of West Berlin has reached its apogee.
B11 1330  8    British common sense is proverbial. The present attempts
B11 1340  5    of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons
B11 1350  3    shows that this British common sense is unwilling to
B11 1360  1    pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new
B11 1360 11    military adventures".
B11 1370  1    #@#
B11 1370  2    East Berlin (Communist) radio in German to Germany:
B11 1380  1       "A better position for negotiations is the real
B11 1380  9    point of this speech. Kennedy knows the West will not
B11 1390 10    wage war for West Berlin, neither conventional nor
B11 1400  5    nuclear, and negotiations will come as certainly as
B11 1410  4    the peace treaty. Whenever some Washington circles
B11 1420  1    were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they
B11 1420 10    have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique
B11 1430  8    in the Pentagon and in Bonn. In Kennedy's speech are
B11 1440  5    cross currents, sensible ones and senseless ones, reflecting
B11 1450  3    the great struggle of opinions between the President's
B11 1460  1    advisers and the political and economic forces behind
B11 1460  9    them. Well, dear listeners, despite all the shouting,
B11 1470  8    there will be no war over West Berlin".
B11 1480  4       Moscow ~TASS in Russian datelined Sochi:
B11 1490  2       "Chairman Khrushchev received the U&S& President's
B11 1500  1    disarmament adviser, John McCloy. Their conversation
B11 1510  1    and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere".
B11 1510 10       Now, to translate from the Communese, this means:
B11 1520  8       The "West Berlin" crisis is really an East Berlin
B11 1530  7    crisis.
B11 1530  8    #@#
B11 1530  9    The crisis was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin
B11 1540  8    (Wall Street) and the Red Army (Pentagon) egged on
B11 1550  6    by the West Germans (East Germans).
B11 1560  1       The reason was to speed up domestic production in
B11 1560 10    the ~USSR, which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing
B11 1570  6    power, and try to end the permanent recession in Russian
B11 1580  6    living standards.
B11 1580  8       Chairman Khrushchev (Kennedy) rattles his rockets
B11 1590  6    (sabre) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen
B11 1600  7    his negotiating position. His advisers in the Politburo
B11 1610  4    (White House) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions,
B11 1620  3    so he is not always consistent.
B11 1620  9       The Soviet Union will fight neither a conventional
B11 1630  6    nor a nuclear war over Berlin, and neither will its
B11 1640  5    Warsaw Pact allies. The West has no intention of attacking
B11 1650  3    Russia.
B11 1650  4       Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy had a terrible
B11 1660  4    row at Sochi.
B11 1660  7       See, Communese is easy- once you get onto it.
B11 1680  1       Aug& 4, 1821, nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin
B11 1680 10    founded the Pennsylvania Gazette- a century during
B11 1690  7    which it had undergone several changes in ownership
B11 1700  5    and a few brief suspensions in publication- this paper
B11 1710  5    made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening Post.
B11 1720  2    The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C&
B11 1720 12    Atkinson and Charles Alexander, who had just taken
B11 1730  8    over Franklin's old paper, desired a more distinctive
B11 1740  7    name.
B11 1740  8       When founded by Franklin the Gazette was a weekly
B11 1750  6    family newspaper and under its new name its format
B11 1760  3    remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually
B11 1770  1    contained more and more fiction, poetry, and literary
B11 1770  9    essays. In the middle of the century, with a circulation
B11 1780  8    of 90,000, the Post was one of the most popular weeklies
B11 1790  6    in the country. But during the second half of the century
B11 1800  4    its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus
B11 1810  1    H& K& Curtis purchased it- "paper, type, and all"-
B11 1820  3    for $1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned
B11 1820 14    fiction and initialed miscellany, and with only some
B11 1830  7    2,000 subscribers.
B11 1840  1       Little more than a fine old name, valuable principally
B11 1840  9    because of the Franklin tradition, the Saturday Evening
B11 1850  6    Post was slow to revive. But Curtis poured over $1
B11 1860  6    million into it and in time it again became one of
B11 1870  3    the most popular weeklies of the country.
B11 1880  1       "Remember the French railroad baron who was going
B11 1880  9    to take me floating down the Nile"? **h "Remember the
B11 1890  8    night Will Rogers filled a tooth for me between numbers"?
B11 1900  8    **h "Sure, we met a barrel of rich men but it's hard
B11 1910  8    to find the real thing when you're young, beautiful
B11 1920  3    and the toast of two continents" **h "Remember Fanny
B11 1930  2    Brice promised my mother she would look after me on
B11 1930 12    the road"?
B11 1940  1       All this remembering took place the other night
B11 1940  9    when I had supper with the Ziegfeld Girls at the Beverly
B11 1950 10    Hills Club.
B11 1960  1       A quarter of a century has gone by since this bevy
B11 1960 12    of walking dreams sashayed up and down the staircases
B11 1970  7    of the old New Amsterdam Theater, N&Y&. But watching
B11 1980  4    Mrs& Cyril Ring, Berniece Dalton Janssen, Mrs& Robert
B11 1990  4    Jarvis, Mrs& Walter Adams order low-calory seafood,
B11 2000  2    no bread, I could see the Ziegfeld Girls of 1920 were
B11 2010  2    determined to be glamorous grandmothers of 1961.
B11 2010  9       I was anxious to hear about those dazzling days
B11 2020  8    on the Great White Way. All I could remember was Billie
B11 2030  6    Dove pasted over the ceiling of my big brother's room.
B11 2040  4       "Billie was really beautiful"! exclaimed Vera Forbes
B11 2050  3    Adams, batting lovely big eyes behind glitter rimmed
B11 2060  1    glasses.
B12 0010  1       SING SING'S prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable
B12 0020  1    purpose, a fair break from parole boards. But once
B12 0020 10    the strike trend hits hoosegows, there is no telling
B12 0030  7    how far it may go. Inmates might even demand the 34-hour
B12 0040  6    week, all holidays off and fringe benefits including
B12 0050  1    state contributions toward lawyers' fees. Some day
B12 0050  8    we might see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates,
B12 0060  9    with a leader busily trying to organize reformatory
B12 0070  5    occupants, defendants out on bail, convicts opposed
B12 0080  2    to probation officers, etc&.

B12 0080  7       A three-day confinement week, with a month's vacation
B12 0090  6    and shorter hours all around could be an ultimate demand
B12 0100  6    from cell occupants of the nation, with fringe benefits
B12 0110  3    including:
B12 0110  4    _1._
B12 0110  5       Wider space between iron bars and agreement by prison
B12 0120  5    boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of metal.
B12 0130  2    _2._
B12 0130  3       An agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of
B12 0130 12    locks used on prison doors. In case of a deadlock between
B12 0140 11    prison boards and inmates, a federal arbitration board
B12 0150  7    to include a "lifer" and two escapees should decide
B12 0160  5    the issue.
B12 0160  7    _3._
B12 0160  8       Specific broadening of travel rights.
B12 0170  3    _4._
B12 0170  4       The right to leave the hoosegow any time to see
B12 0180  2    a lawyer instead of waiting for a lawyer to make a
B12 0180 13    trip to the prison.
B12 0190  1    _5._
B12 0190  2       Recognition of Prisoners Union rule that no member
B12 0190 10    of an iron or steel workers union be permitted to repair
B12 0200 11    a sawed-off bar without approval and participation
B12 0210  5    of representative of the cell occupant.
B12 0220  1    _6._
B12 0220  2       No warden or guard to touch lock, key or doorknob
B12 0220 12    except when accompanied by a prisoners' committee with
B12 0230  8    powers of veto.
B12 0240  1    _7._

B12 0830  2    Among the many stories about the late Speaker Rayburn

B12 0930  1       THE 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is
B12 0930 10    being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing
B12 0940  6    today of the New Testament, the first part of the New
B12 0950  7    English Bible, undertaken as a new translation of the
B12 0960  4    Scriptures into contemporary English.
B12 0960  8       Since it was issued in the spring of 1611, the King
B12 0970 11    James Version has been most generally considered the
B12 0980  6    most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the
B12 0990  3    Bible. However, Biblical scholars frequently attested
B12 1000  1    to its numerous inaccuracies, as old manuscripts were
B12 1000  9    uncovered and scholarship advanced.
B12 1010  4       This resulted in revisions of the King James Bible
B12 1020  3    in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in 1901
B12 1030  2    as the American Standard Version. Then in 1937 America's
B12 1040  1    International Council of Religious Education authorized
B12 1040  7    a new revision, in the light of expanded knowledge
B12 1050  7    of ancient manuscripts and languages. Undertaken by
B12 1060  3    32 American scholars, under the chairmanship of Rev&
B12 1070  3    Dr& Luther A& Weigle, former dean of Yale University
B12 1080  1    Divinity School, their studies resulted in the publishing
B12 1080  9    of the Revised Standard Version, 1946-52.
B12 1090  6    #NOT RIVAL#
B12 1090  8    The New English Bible (the Old Testament and Apocrypha
B12 1100  7    will be published at a future date) has not been planned
B12 1110  7    to rival or replace the King James Version, but, as
B12 1120  4    its cover states, it is offered "simply as the Bible
B12 1130  1    to all those who will use it in reading, teaching,
B12 1130 11    or worship".
B12 1140  1       Time, of course will testify whether the new version
B12 1140 10    will have achieved its purpose. Bible reading, even
B12 1150  7    more so than good classical music, grows in depth and
B12 1160  6    meaning upon repetition.
B12 1160  9       If this new Bible does not increase in significance
B12 1170  8    by repeated readings throughout the years, it will
B12 1180  5    not survive the ages as has the King James Version.
B12 1190  2       However, an initial perusal and comparison of some
B12 1200  1    of the famous passages with the same parts of other
B12 1200 11    versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the
B12 1210  8    British Biblical scholars. One is impressed with the
B12 1220  4    dignity, clarity and beauty of this new translation
B12 1230  1    into contemporary English, and there is no doubt that
B12 1230 10    the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable
B12 1240  7    to the general reader in contemporary language than
B12 1250  3    in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the
B12 1270  1    King James.
B12 1270  3       For example, in the third chapter of Matthew, verses
B12 1280  1    13-16, describing the baptism of Jesus, the 1611 version
B12 1280 11    reads:
B12 1290  1       "Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John,
B12 1300  1    to be baptized of him.
B12 1300  6       "But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be
B12 1310  4    baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
B12 1310 12       "And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to
B12 1320  9    be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.
B12 1330  7    Then he suffered him.
B12 1340  1       "And Jesus, when he was baptized went up straightway
B12 1340 10    out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto
B12 1350  9    him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a
B12 1360  6    dove, and lighting upon him".
B12 1360 11    #CLEARER MEANING#
B12 1370  2    Certainly, the meaning is clearer to one who is not
B12 1380  1    familiar with Biblical teachings, in the New English
B12 1380  9    Bible which reads: "Then Jesus arrived at Jordan from
B12 1390  7    Galilee, and he came to John to be baptized by him.
B12 1400  8    John tried to dissuade him. 'Do you come to me'? he
B12 1410  5    said; 'I need rather to be baptized by you'. Jesus
B12 1420  2    replied, 'let it be so for the present; we do well
B12 1420 13    to conform this way with all that God requires'. John
B12 1430 10    then allowed him to come. After baptism Jesus came
B12 1440  7    up out of the water at once, and at that moment heaven
B12 1450  5    opened; he saw the Spirit of God descending like a
B12 1460  3    dove to alight upon him";
B12 1460  8       (the paragraphing, spelling and punctuation are
B12 1470  4    reproduced as printed in each version.)
B12 1480  1       Among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences
B12 1480  7    are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons, other than
B12 1490  8    scholars, really understand the true meaning of these
B12 1500  5    eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of
B12 1510  2    the Sermon on the Mount.
B12 1510  7       To illustrate, the first blessing in the King James
B12 1520  5    Bible reads: "Blessed are the poor in spirit; for their's
B12 1530  4    is the kingdom of heaven". The new version states:
B12 1540  2    "How blest are those who know that they are poor; the
B12 1550  1    kingdom of Heaven is theirs".
B12 1550  6       Some of the poetic cadence of the older version
B12 1560  4    certainly is lost in the newer one, but almost anyone,
B12 1570  1    with a fair knowledge of the English language, can
B12 1570 10    understand the meaning, without the necessity of interpretation
B12 1580  7    by a Biblical scholar. To a novice that is significant.
B12 1600  4       In the second and third chapters of Revelation the
B12 1610  5    new version retains, however, the old phrase "angel
B12 1620  2    of the church" which Biblical scholars have previously
B12 1630  1    interpreted as meaning bishop. This is not contemporary
B12 1630  9    English.
B12 1630 10    #MOSTLY CONTEMPORARY#
B12 1640  2    For the most part, however, the new version is contemporary
B12 1650  2    and, as such, should be the means for many to attain
B12 1650 13    a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words
B12 1660  9    recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first
B12 1670  7    followers of Christ.
B12 1670 10       Originally recorded by hand, these words have been
B12 1680  8    copied and recopied, translated and retranslated through
B12 1690  4    the ages. Discoveries recently made of old Biblical
B12 1700  3    manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings,
B12 1710  1    some by the early church fathers, in themselves called
B12 1710 10    for a restudy of the Bible. To have the results recorded
B12 1720  9    in everyday usable English should be of benefit to
B12 1730  7    all who seek the truth.
B12 1730 12       There is one danger, however. With contemporary
B12 1740  7    English changing with the rapidity that marks this
B12 1750  5    jet age, some of the words and phrases of the new version
B12 1760  3    may themselves soon become archaic. The only answer
B12 1760 11    will be continuous study.
B12 1770  4       The New Testament offered to the public today is
B12 1780  3    the first result of the work of a joint committee made
B12 1780 14    up of representatives of the Church of England, Church
B12 1790  9    of Scotland, Methodist Church, Congregational Union,
B12 1800  5    Baptist Union, Presbyterian Church of England, Churches
B12 1810  5    in Wales, Churches in Ireland, Society of Friends,
B12 1820  4    British and Foreign Bible Society and National Society
B12 1830  2    of Scotland.
B12 1830  4       Prof& C& H& Dodd, 76, a Congregational minister
B12 1840  2    and a leading authority on the New Testament, is general

B12 1860  1    panel.
B13 0010  1       Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are
B13 0010  8    anything but kind to the feet. That is why it is important
B13 0020 11    to invest in comfortable, airy types of shoes.
B13 0030  5       There are many soft and light shoe leathers available.
B13 0040  3    Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness
B13 0050  1    achieved via unlined leathers. Softness is found in
B13 0050  9    crushed textures.
B13 0060  2       Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with
B13 0070  1    elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape. Heels
B13 0070 10    place emphasis on the long legged silhouette. Wine
B13 0090  5    glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights.
B13 0100  4    Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored
B13 0110  1    shoes. Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found
B13 0110 11    on teenage pumps.
B13 0120  2    #COOLEST SHADE#
B13 0120  4    While white is the coolest summer shade, there are
B13 0130  3    lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that
B13 0130 12    will blend with any wardrobe color.
B13 0140  5       In the tintable group are high and little heels,
B13 0150  3    squared and oval throats, and shantung-like textures.
B13 0160  1       Don't overlook the straws this year. They come in
B13 0160 10    crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues, along with
B13 0170  8    lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural,
B13 0180  5    white, black and a whole range of colors. In the casual
B13 0190  3    field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved
B13 0190 12    wood in a variety of styles. For added comfort some
B13 0200  9    of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning.
B13 0210  6       The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to
B13 0220  6    be found afoot. Orange and lemon are considered important
B13 0230  2    as are such pastels as blue and lilac. In a brighter
B13 0230 13    nautical vein is Ille de France blue. Contrast trim
B13 0240  9    provides other touches of color. Spectators in white
B13 0250  6    crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black, navy
B13 0260  5    and taffy tan.
B13 0260  8    #DESIGNED FOR EASE#
B13 0260 11    Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated.
B13 0270  8    At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light,
B13 0280  8    but crisp texture. In a lacey open weave shoes have
B13 0290  4    a luster finish, braided collar and bow highlight on
B13 0300  1    the squared throat. At right is a casual style in a
B13 0300 12    crushed unlined white leather. Flats have a scalloped
B13 0310  7    throat.
B13 0320  1       An electric toothbrush (Broxodent) may soon take
B13 0320  8    its place next to the electric razor in the American
B13 0330  8    bathroom. The brush moves up and down and is small
B13 0340  6    enough to clean every dental surface, including the
B13 0350  2    back of the teeth. In addition, the motor has the seal
B13 0350 13    of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories, which
B13 0360  6    means it is safe.
B13 0370  1       The unit consists of a small motor that goes on
B13 0370 10    as soon as it is plugged in. The speed is controlled
B13 0380  6    by pressing on the two brake buttons located where
B13 0390  3    the index finger and thumb are placed when holding
B13 0390 12    the motor. The bushes can be cleaned and sterilized
B13 0400  9    by boiling and are detachable so that every member
B13 0410  5    of the family can have his own.
B13 0420  1       Most of us brush our teeth by hand. The same can
B13 0420 12    be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved
B13 0430  7    useful to many men.
B13 0430 11       The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction,
B13 0440  7    the way dentists recommend. In addition, it is small
B13 0450  6    enough to get into crevices, jacket and crown margins,
B13 0460  3    malposed anteriors, and the back teeth. The bristles
B13 0470  1    are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch
B13 0470 11    the enamel.
B13 0480  1       It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better
B13 0480 10    job than ordinary bushing, especially in those who
B13 0490  6    do not brush their teeth properly. Several dentists
B13 0500  3    and patients with special dental problems have experimented
B13 0510  1    with the device. The results were good although they
B13 0510 10    are difficult to compare with hand brushing, particularly
B13 0520  7    when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly.
B13 0530  8    The electric gadget is most helpful when there are
B13 0540  4    many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly,
B13 0550  1    bedfast with a chronic disease, or are handicapped
B13 0550  9    by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.
B13 0560  8       But for many of us, it will prove an enjoyable luxury.
B13 0570  8    It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush
B13 0580  4    and the paste tends to shimmy of the bristles. Since
B13 0590  1    the apparatus is new, it requires experimentation and
B13 0590  9    changes in technique.

B13 0630  9    The pressure may come from muscles, tendons, or bones
B13 0640  5    anywhere from the neck to the hand.

B13 0660  1    _REPLY_
B13 0660  2       No, other than cleaning out the pores and making
B13 0660 11    the sweat glands work harder. An ordinary hot bath
B13 0670  8    or shower will do the same.

B13 0690  3    _REPLY_
B13 0690  4       There are many possibilities, including poor circulation,
B13 0700  3    a variety of neurological conditions, and functional
B13 0710  1    disorders. This manifestation may be an early sign
B13 0710  9    of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer's cramp.

B13 0730  8    _REPLY_
B13 0730  9       A back brace might help, depending upon the cause
B13 0740  7    of sciatica.
B13 0740  9    #CHOLESTEROL AND THYROID#
B13 0750  2    @ writes: Does the cholesterol go down when most of
B13 0760  1    the thyroid gland is removed?
B13 0760  6    _REPLY_
B13 0760  7       No. It usually goes up. The cholesterol level in
B13 0770  5    the blood is influenced by the glands of the body.
B13 0780  2    It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when
B13 0780 13    the gland is sluggish. The latter is likely to occur
B13 0790  9    when the thyroid is removed.
B13 0810  1       The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet
B13 0810 10    grows smaller with each new recording catalogue.
B13 0820  6       There's more reading and instruction to be heard
B13 0830  6    on discs than ever before, although the spoken rather
B13 0840  2    than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison's
B13 0850  1    first experiment in recorded sound. Edison could hardly
B13 0850  9    have guessed, however, that Sophocles would one day
B13 0860  7    appear in stereo.
B13 0860 10       If the record buyer's tastes are somewhat eclectic
B13 0870  8    or even the slightest bit esoteric, he will find them
B13 0880  7    satisfied on educational records. And he will avoid
B13 0890  4    eye-strain in the process.
B13 0890  9       Everything from poetry to phonetics, history to
B13 0900  5    histrionics, philosophy to party games has been adapted
B13 0910  4    to the turntable.
B13 0910  7       For sheer ambition, take the Decca series titled
B13 0920  4    modestly "Wisdom". Volumes One and Two, selected from
B13 0930  3    the sound tracks of a television series, contain "conversations
B13 0940  1    with the elder wise men of our day".
B13 0940  9       These sages include poet Carl Sandburg, statesman
B13 0950  6    Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, in
B13 0960  4    Volume One, and playwright Sean O'Casey, David Ben-Gurion,
B13 0970  4    philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank Lloyd
B13 0980  2    Wright in the second set. Hugh Downs is heard interviewing
B13 0990  1    Wright, for an added prestige fillip.
B13 0990  7       There's more specialization and a narrower purpose
B13 1000  5    in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications.
B13 1010  2    Dover "publishes" what the company calls "Listen and
B13 1020  2    Learn" productions designed to teach foreign languages.
B13 1030  1    Previous presentations have been on French, Spanish,
B13 1030  8    Russian, Italian, German and Japanese.
B13 1040  4       But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and
B13 1050  3    the tourist's desire to visit the "smaller, less-traveled
B13 1060  1    and relatively inexpensive countries", and is now prepared
B13 1060  9    to teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings.
B13 1070  8    The respective vocabularies "essential for travel"
B13 1080  5    are available in separate albums.
B13 1090  2       Thanks to Spoken Arts Records, history buffs may
B13 1090 10    hear Lincoln's "most memorable speeches and letters"
B13 1100  7    in a two-disc set, interpreted by Lincoln authority
B13 1110  6    and lecturer Roy P& Basler. As a comtemporary bonus,
B13 1120  5    the set includes Carl Sandburg's address at a joint
B13 1130  4    session of Congress, delivered on Lincoln's birthday
B13 1140  1    two years ago.
B13 1140  4       For those who "like poetry but never get around
B13 1150  2    to reading it", the Library of Congress makes it possible
B13 1160  1    for poets to be heard reading their own work. The program
B13 1160 12    was instituted in 1940, and releases are available
B13 1170  7    only from the Recording Laboratory of the Library of
B13 1180  5    Congress, Washington 25, D& C& A catalogue is available
B13 1190  3    on request.
B13 1190  5       Newest on the list are John Ciardi, W& D& Snodgrass,
B13 1200  5    I& A& Richards, Oscar Williams, Robert Hillyer, John
B13 1210  4    Hall Wheelock, Stephen Vincent Benet, Edwin Muir, John
B13 1220  4    Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim. Two poets are paired
B13 1230  3    on each record, in the order given above.
B13 1230 11       Decca is not the only large commercial company to
B13 1240  8    impart instruction. ~RCA Victor has an ambitious and
B13 1250  6    useful project in a stereo series called "Adventures
B13 1260  2    in Music", which is an instructional record library
B13 1270  1    for elementary schools. Howard Mitchell and the National
B13 1270  9    Symphony perform in the first two releases, designed
B13 1280  8    for grades one and two. Teaching guides are included
B13 1290  4    with each record.
B13 1300  1       In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen
B13 1300 10    upsets sure to arise in the future, Herbert A& Leggett,
B13 1310  9    banker-editor of the Phoenix "Arizona Progress", reflects
B13 1320  6    upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish
B13 1330  5    fifties.
B13 1330  6       One of the roughest was the ~TV quiz shows, which
B13 1340  5    gave him inferiority complexes. Though it was a great
B13 1350  5    relief when the big brains on these shows turned out
B13 1360  1    to be frauds and phonies, it did irreparable damage
B13 1360 10    to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent,
B13 1370  6    well-informed American.
B13 1380  1       But the one that upset the financially wise was
B13 1380 10    the professional dancer who related in a book how he
B13 1390  8    parlayed his earnings into a $2,000,000 profit on the
B13 1400  4    stock market. Every man who dabbles in the market to
B13 1410  1    make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses
B13 1410 12    could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering
B13 1420  8    how her husband could be so dumb. Investors breathed
B13 1430  4    more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic
B13 1440  1    dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best
B13 1440 11    seller book to make some dough.
B13 1450  5       People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner
B13 1460  3    who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the
B13 1460 12    form of a number of bull's-eye achievements. The promoter
B13 1470 10    who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him
B13 1480 10    how he was able to do it. His answer was simple but
B13 1490  5    honest. He just shot at the board and then drew circles
B13 1500  2    around the holes to form a bull's-eye.
B13 1510  1       One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old
B13 1510 14    child is a lack of verbal communication. The child
B13 1520  9    understands no. He senses his mother's disapproval.
B13 1530  4    But explanations leave him confused and unmoved.
B13 1540  2       If his mother loves him, he clings to that love
B13 1540 12    as a ballast. It motivates his behavior. He wants Mommy
B13 1550 10    to think him a good boy. He doesn't want her to look
B13 1560 10    frowningly at him, or speak to him angrily. This breaks
B13 1570  6    his heart. He wants to be called sweet, good, considerate
B13 1580  3    and mother's little helper. But even mother's loving
B13 1590  2    attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.
B13 1590  8       His desires are so strong that he needs constant
B13 1600  8    reassurance of his mother's love for him and what she
B13 1610  7    expects of him, in order to overcome them. His own
B13 1620  3    inner voice, which should tell him what not to do,
B13 1620 13    has not developed. It won't develop until he has words
B13 1630  8    with which to clothe it. The conscience is non-existent
B13 1640  6    in the 2-year-old.
B13 1640 11       What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior?
B13 1650  8    She can decrease the number of temptations. She can
B13 1660  5    remove all knick-knacks within reach. The fewer nos
B13 1670  3    she has to utter the more effective they will be.
B13 1680  1       She should offer substitutes for the temptations
B13 1680  7    which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child. If
B13 1690  6    he can't play with Mommy's magazines, he should have
B13 1700  4    some old numbers of his own. If Daddy's books are out
B13 1710  3    of bounds his own picture books are not. Toys he has
B13 1710 14    can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations
B13 1720  9    such as refrigerator and gas stove.
B13 1730  4       During this precarious period of development the
B13 1740  1    mother should continue to influence the growth of the
B13 1740 10    child's conscience. She tells him of the consequences
B13 1750  7    of his behavior. If he bites a playmate she says, "Danny
B13 1760  6    won't like you". If he snatches a toy, she says, "Caroline
B13 1770  6    wants her own truck just as you do".
B13 1780  1       There is no use trying to "Explain" to a 2-year-old.
B13 1780 13    Actions speak louder. Remove temptations. Remove the
B13 1790  7    child from the scene of his misbehavior. Substitute
B13 1800  5    approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling
B13 1810  4    him how he is to act. He won't submit to his natural
B13 1820  1    desires all the time, and it's Mother's love that is
B13 1820 11    responsible for his good behavior.
B14 0010  1       This is the period during the melancholy days of
B14 0010 10    autumn when universities and colleges schedule what
B14 0020  5    they call "Homecoming Day". They seek thereby to lure
B14 0030  6    the old grad back to the old scenes.
B14 0040  1       The football opponent on homecoming is, of course,
B14 0040  9    selected with the view that said opponent will have
B14 0050  8    little more chance than did a Christian when thrown
B14 0060  3    to one of the emperor's lions. It is true, of course,
B14 0070  2    the uncertainties of life being what they are, that
B14 0070 11    as now and then the Christian killed the lion, homecoming
B14 0080  8    days have been ruined by a visiting team.
B14 0090  5       Even with all possible precaution, homecomings are
B14 0100  2    usually rather cruel and sad, and only the perpetually
B14 0100 11    ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy
B14 0110  8    by them.
B14 0110 10       More often than not, as the Old Grad wanders along
B14 0120 10    the old paths, his memory of happy days when he strolled
B14 0130  8    one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an
B14 0140  4    ache and a pain. He can smell again the perfume she
B14 0150  1    wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter, and
B14 0150 10    can smell again the aroma of autumn- fallen leaves,
B14 0160  6    the wine of cool air, and the nostalgia of woodsmoke
B14 0170  3    which blows through all the winds of fall.
B14 0170 11    #UNDERGRADUATES#
B14 0180  1    It is at precisely such moments that he encounters
B14 0180 10    a couple of undergraduates, faces alight, holding hands
B14 0190  7    and talking happily as they come along, oblivious of
B14 0200  7    him, or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of
B14 0210  4    glances, such as they would give a tethered goat. Usually,
B14 0220  1    they titter loudly after they have passed by.
B14 0220  9       His dream goes. He feels, suddenly, the weight of
B14 0230  8    the fat that is on him. His bridgework or his plates
B14 0240  5    feel loose and monstrous. His bifocals blur. His legs
B14 0250  3    suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary, as if
B14 0250 11    he had walked for miles, instead of strolling a few
B14 0260  9    hundred yards along the old campus paths. Bitterness
B14 0270  5    comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe
B14 0280  3    persimmons in his mouth.
B14 0280  7       It is not much better if he meets with old classmates.
B14 0290  6    Too often, unless he hails them, they pass him by.
B14 0300  4    He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said, on returning
B14 0310  1    from a homecoming reunion, that he would never go again
B14 0310 11    because all his class had changed so much they didn't
B14 0320  9    even recognize him.
B14 0330  1       If they do meet and recognize one another, slap
B14 0330 10    backs and embrace, the moment soon is done. After all,
B14 0340  8    when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie
B14 0350  6    **h when one has inquired who it was Sue Brown married
B14 0360  3    and where it is they now live **h when questions are
B14 0360 14    asked and answered about families and children, and
B14 0370  8    old professors **h when the game and its probable outcome
B14 0380  7    has been exhausted **h that does it.
B14 0390  2    #MIDDLE-AGED SPREAD#
B14 0390  5    By then one begins to notice the middle-age spread;
B14 0400  2    the gray hairs, the eyeglasses, bodies that are too
B14 0400 11    thin or too heavy; the fading signs of old beauty;
B14 0410 10    the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit
B14 0415  8    and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length
B14 0430  4    **h then, it is time to break it up and move on.
B14 0440  1       It is, if anything, worse on the old player **h
B14 0440 11       He sits in the stands and he doesn't like that.
B14 0450  9    Enough of his life was spent there on the field for
B14 0460  6    him never to like watching the game as a spectator
B14 0470  1    in the crowd. He always feels lonely. A team feels
B14 0470 11    something. On a team a man feels he is a part of it
B14 0480 13    and akin to the men next to him. In the stands he is
B14 0490  8    lonely and lost, no matter how many are about him.
B14 0500  2       He sits there remembering the tense moment before
B14 0500 10    the ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet,
B14 0510  9    the rasp of the canvas pants; the smell and feel of
B14 0520  8    hot, wet woolen sleeves across his face. He remembers
B14 0530  4    the desperate, panting breath; the long runs on the
B14 0540  3    kick-offs; the hard, jolting tackles; the breakthrough;
B14 0540 11    the desperate agony of goal-line stands. And so, he
B14 0550 10    squirms with each play, remembering his youth.
B14 0560  5       But it is no use. It is gone.
B14 0570  1       No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes
B14 0570 12    of his youth and strength, they can never be recaptured
B14 0580  7    again.
B14 0590  1       Since the obvious is not always true, the Republican
B14 0590 10    National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last
B14 0600  8    autumn and finds that it occurred, as suspected, in
B14 0610  6    the larger cities.
B14 0610  9       Of 40 cities with populations of 300,000 and more,
B14 0620  7    Mr& Kennedy carried 26 and Mr& Nixon 14. There are
B14 0630  5    eight states in which the largest urban vote can be
B14 0640  3    the balance of power in any close election. These are
B14 0640 13    New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri,
B14 0650  6    New Jersey, Illinois and Minnesota. In 1952 Mr& Eisenhower
B14 0660  7    won all but Missouri. Yet, in 1960 all eight gave majorities
B14 0670  8    to Mr& Kennedy.
B14 0680  1       Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia.
B14 0680  9    Mr& Nixon, despite a very earnest effort to capture
B14 0690  8    the minority groups, failed to do so. His visit to
B14 0700  7    Warsaw, Poland, after the Russian journey in the summer
B14 0710  4    of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which,
B14 0720  1    in several cities, is substantial. Yet, the ~GOP breakdown
B14 0720 10    discovered that in Philadelphia Mr& Nixon received
B14 0730  7    but 21 per cent of the so-called "Polish" vote; 30
B14 0740  7    per cent of the "Irish" vote, and 18 per cent of the
B14 0750  7    "Negro" vote.
B14 0750  9    #'TASK FORCE'#
B14 0760  1    A ~GOP "task force' committee will seek to find out
B14 0760 11    how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority
B14 0770 10    groups in cities.
B14 0780  1       The task force might make a start in Washington
B14 0780 10    with Republican congressional leaders. These gentlemen
B14 0790  5    already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance
B14 0800  6    to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism
B14 0810  5    of Mr& Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment.
B14 0820  3    This error was compounded by declaring the recession
B14 0830  1    to be "a statistical one", and not a reality. The almost
B14 0830 12    six million persons without jobs and the two million
B14 0840  9    working part-time do not consider themselves and their
B14 0850  6    plight as statistical. They did not view the tour of
B14 0860  5    the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor
B14 0870  1    Goldberg as politics, which the ~GOP declared it to
B14 0870 10    be. The people visited were glad to have a government
B14 0880  9    with heart enough to take an interest in their misery.
B14 0890  6       Senator Mundt's gross distortion of President Eisenhower's
B14 0900  4    conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy
B14 0910  4    as too left wing, a statement Mr& Eisenhower declared
B14 0920  2    to be entirely false, is another case in point. If
B14 0920 12    the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat
B14 0930  7    medical care for the old under the Social Security
B14 0940  6    program, they will thereby erect still another barrier
B14 0950  3    to ~GOP hopes in the cities.
B14 0950  9    #ERRORS REPEATED#
B14 0960  1    The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt,
B14 0960  9    Goldwater, Bridges, Dirksen, et al, is repeating the
B14 0970  8    errors of the party leadership of the 1930s. In that
B14 0980  7    decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr& Hoover, and
B14 0990  3    the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the
B14 1000  1    depression, caused a great majority of Americans to
B14 1000  9    see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any
B14 1010  8    sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up
B14 1020  4    in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic
B14 1030  1    crash.
B14 1030  2       The Republican party was not lacking in humanity,
B14 1040  1    but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership
B14 1040  8    to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people
B14 1050  7    in trouble. Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup
B14 1060  4    trucks "Hoover carts". Smokers reduced to "the makings",
B14 1070  3    spoke of the sack tobacco as "Hoover dust".
B14 1080  1       One may be sure the present Republican congressional
B14 1080  9    leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error. But it
B14 1090  9    is in the process of so doing because it apparently
B14 1100  5    gives priority to trying to downgrade John F& Kennedy.
B14 1110  3    That this is not good politics is underscored by the
B14 1120  1    latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of
B14 1120 11    the people like the way in which the new President
B14 1130  8    is conducting the nation's business.
B14 1140  1       The most articulate Republicans are those who, in
B14 1140  9    their desire to get back at Mr& Kennedy, already have
B14 1150 10    created the image of a Republican leadership which
B14 1160  6    is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed,
B14 1170  4    and which is even more unwilling to help old people
B14 1180  1    who need medical care. If they also defeat the school
B14 1180 11    bill, the ~GOP task force won't have much research
B14 1190  8    to do. It will early know why the party won't win back
B14 1200  8    city votes.
B14 1210  1       The 1962 General Assembly has important business
B14 1210  8    to consider. The tragedy is that it will not be able
B14 1220 10    to transact that business in any responsible manner.
B14 1230  4       After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed
B14 1240  3    the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative
B14 1250  1    Forum, this is going to be the most politically oriented
B14 1250 11    Legislature in history.
B14 1260  3       Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston
B14 1270  2    is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest
B14 1270 13    scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances, not
B14 1280  9    his convictions.
B14 1290  1       Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the
B14 1290  9    county unit system stands less chance than ever. And
B14 1300  7    just how far can the Legislature go toward setting
B14 1310  4    up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst
B14 1320  2    of a governor's race"?
B14 1320  6       How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt&
B14 1330  3    Gov& Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government
B14 1340  3    Operations?
B14 1340  4       The situation already was bad because the Legislature
B14 1350  3    moved the governor's race forward a few months, causing
B14 1360  2    the campaigning to get started earlier than usual.
B14 1370  1       But when former Gov& Marvin Griffin and Lt& Gov&
B14 1370  9    Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State
B14 1380  7    Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November,
B14 1390  5    the situation was aggravated.
B14 1390  9       Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation.
B14 1400 10    To have refused would have been political suicide.
B14 1410  6    And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed
B14 1420  3    the opportunity, when the bravado comments are cast
B14 1430  1    aside.
B14 1430  2       The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard
B14 1440  1    against the danger of eliminating potential candidates.
B14 1440  8    It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee
B14 1450  6    to pick the "serious candidates".
B14 1460  2       But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said
B14 1470  2    no, and he didn't mince any words. "They are just asking
B14 1480  1    too much", he said. We can't think of anyone else who
B14 1480 12    would want to separate serious candidates from other
B14 1490  7    candidates, either.
B14 1500  1       There are other dangers:
B14 1500  5       Politics is an accelerating game. "If an opponent
B14 1510  4    accuses you of lying, don't deny it. Say he is a horse
B14 1520  3    thief", runs an old adage.
B14 1520  8       These men are spenders. If either one ever started
B14 1530  6    making promises, there is no telling where the promises
B14 1540  3    would end. Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's
B14 1550  1    60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's
B14 1550 10    oaths.
B14 1560  1       The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks
B14 1560 11    like such a good one. Why not have them travel the
B14 1570 10    state in November debating? It would present a forum
B14 1580  6    for them in almost every community.
B14 1590  1       But further thought brings the shuddery visions
B14 1590  8    of a governor's race being run in the next Legislature,
B14 1600  8    the spectre of big spending programs, the ooze of mudslinging
B14 1610  6    before the campaign should even begin. There isa way
B14 1620  4    out of this. The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative
B14 1630  1    forum. It has arranged a campaign for governor.
B14 1640  1       If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications
B14 1640 10    are closed next spring, and then carry all the candidates
B14 1650  9    on a tour of debates, it can provide a service to the
B14 1660  8    state.
B14 1660  9       But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity
B14 1670  5    to compelte its work before choosing up sides for the
B14 1680  5    race.
B14 1690  1       Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower
B14 1690  8    was not a "great soldier". Ike's somewhat like George
B14 1710  7    Washington. Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a
B14 1720 10    modest assist from British strategy.
B14 1730  1       Congressmen returning from recess say the people
B14 1730  8    admire President Kennedy so much, they're even willing
B14 1740  8    to heed his call to sacrifice- and give up his program.
B14 1750  8       Slogan of the John Birch Society: "Paddle your own
B14 1760  6    canoe. The guy who makes the motor boats may be a Communist".
B14 1770  7       A Republican survey says Kennedy won the '60 election
B14 1780  5    on the religious issue. Too many people were afraid
B14 1790  2    if the ~GOP won, they'd have to spend all their time
B14 1790 13    praying.
B15 0010  1       The Providence Journal editorial (Jan& 25) entitled
B15 0010  8    "East Greenwich Faces a Housing Development Problem"
B15 0020  7    points to a dilemma that faces communities such as
B15 0030  7    ours. Your suggested solution, it seems to me, is grossly
B15 0040  7    oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally
B15 0050  2    realistic attitude toward, and endorsement of, sound
B15 0050  9    planning.
B15 0060  1       First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich
B15 0060 11    already zoned in the classification similar to that
B15 0070  8    which petitioner requested. This land is in various
B15 0080  6    stages of development in several locations throughout
B15 0090  2    the town. The demand for these lots can be met for
B15 0090 13    some time to come. This would seem to indicate that
B15 0100 10    we are trying neither "to halt an influx of migrants"
B15 0110  7    nor are we "setting up such standards for development
B15 0120  3    that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and
B15 0130  3    build in the new sites".
B15 0130  8       What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain
B15 0140  6    a balance between medium density and low density residential
B15 0150  2    areas and industrial and commercial development. It
B15 0160  1    is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion
B15 0160  9    of modest industrial development to help pay governmental
B15 0170  6    costs. Bostitch, Inc& is approximately half way through
B15 0180  5    a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax. The wisdom
B15 0190  4    of granting such tax exemptions is another matter,
B15 0200  1    but this particular instance is, in my opinion, completely
B15 0200 10    satisfactory. The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich
B15 0210  8    indicates a valuation for this property in excess of
B15 0220  5    two million dollars. With our current $3 per hundred
B15 0230  2    tax rate, it is safe to assume that this will qualify
B15 0230 13    when you suggest a community should "try to develop
B15 0240  8    a modest industrial plant" as the best way to meet
B15 0250  7    these problems.
B15 0250  9       In order to attract additional industry that is
B15 0260  5    compatible with this community it is all the more important
B15 0270  5    to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance
B15 0280  2    in the tax structure. As this tax base grows so then
B15 0280 13    can your medium and low density residential areas grow.
B15 0290  8    Mr& Richard Preston, executive director of the New
B15 0300  6    Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission,
B15 0310  3    in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial
B15 0320  3    Development at Providence on October 8, 1960, warned
B15 0330  1    against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry
B15 0330  9    solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal
B15 0340  8    services such as schools when he said: "If this is
B15 0350  6    the fundamental reason for a community's interest or
B15 0360  3    if this is the basic approach, success if any will
B15 0360 13    be difficult to obtain". He went on to say: "In the
B15 0370 10    first place, industry per se is not dedicated to the
B15 0380  8    role of savior of foundering municipalities. It is
B15 0390  3    not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased
B15 0400  1    municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may
B15 0400 11    be".
B15 0410  1       While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase
B15 0410  8    in school costs in answer to a direct question from
B15 0420  9    a taxpayer, the impact upon a school system does not
B15 0430  6    have to be measured only in increased taxes to find
B15 0440  3    alarm in uncontrolled growth. We in East Greenwich
B15 0440 11    have the example of two neighboring communities, one
B15 0450  7    currently utilizing double sessions in their schools,
B15 0460  5    and the other facing this prospect next year. It has
B15 0470  3    already been reported in your newspapers that the East
B15 0470 12    Greenwich School Committee is considering additions
B15 0480  6    to at least one elementary school and to the high school
B15 0490  8    to insure future accommodations for a school population
B15 0500  5    that we know will increase. If they are to be commended
B15 0510  3    for foresight in their planning, what then is the judgment
B15 0520  1    of a town council that compounds this problem during
B15 0520 10    the planning stage? Where then is the sound planning
B15 0530  7    and cooperation between agencies within the community
B15 0540  4    that you have called for in other editorials? I submit
B15 0550  3    that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are
B15 0550 13    not facing the facts of life.
B15 0560  6       The "fruitful course" of metropolitanization that
B15 0570  2    you recommend is currently practiced by the town of
B15 0580  1    East Greenwich and had its inception long before we
B15 0580 10    learned what it was called. For example:
B15 0590  5    _1._
B15 0590  6       The East Greenwich Police Department utilizes the
B15 0600  3    radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police
B15 0610  1    Department, thereby eliminating duplication of facilities
B15 0610  7    and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East
B15 0620  8    Greenwich-Potowomut area of the two communities.
B15 0630  6    _2._
B15 0630  7       The East Greenwich Fire District services parts
B15 0640  5    of Warwick as well as East Greenwich.
B15 0650  1    _3._
B15 0650  2       The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums
B15 0650  9    of money, as do other Kent County communities, for
B15 0660  8    the support of the Kent County Memorial Hospital, a
B15 0670  5    regional facility.
B15 0670  7    _4._
B15 0670  8       The East Greenwich Free Library receives financial
B15 0680  6    support from the town of East Greenwich and the City
B15 0690  6    of Warwick to supplement its endowment.
B15 0700  1    _5._
B15 0700  2       Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick,
B15 0710  1    as reported in your newspapers, suggesting investigation
B15 0710  8    of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut
B15 0720  7    and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East Greenwich.
B15 0730  6    _6._
B15 0730  7       East Greenwich was one of the first Rhode Island
B15 0740  6    towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode
B15 0750  3    Island Development Council for planning services we
B15 0760  1    could not provide for ourselves.
B15 0760  6    _7._
B15 0760  7       The education program for retarded children conducted
B15 0770  3    by the East Greenwich school system has pupils from
B15 0780  2    at least one neighboring community.
B15 0780  7       I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly
B15 0790  8    concerned with the problem of community growth rate
B15 0800  3    and the relation between types of growth in a town
B15 0810  1    such as East Greenwich. I believe it is an area in
B15 0810 12    which professional planners have failed to set adequate
B15 0820  7    guide posts; and yet they cannot ignore this problem
B15 0830  4    because it concerns the implementation of nearly all
B15 0840  2    the planning programs they have devised. These programs
B15 0840 10    are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens
B15 0850 11    of a community must stand aside while land developers
B15 0860  6    tell them when, where, and in what manner the community
B15 0870  4    shall grow. We have far less to fear in the migrant
B15 0880  1    family than we have in the migrant developer under
B15 0880 10    these conditions.
B15 0890  1       Until professional planners meet this situation
B15 0890  7    squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner
B15 0900 10    acceptable to the courts, I hope we in East Greenwich
B15 0910  7    can continue to shape our own destiny. @
B15 0930  1       I would like very much, on behalf of my husband
B15 0930 11    and myself, to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful
B15 0940  9    people responsible for the Gabrielle Fund.
B15 0950  3       It is indeed true, as stated in the famous novel
B15 0960  2    of our day, "For Whom the Bell Tolls", that "no man
B15 0970  1    is an island, entirely of itself; every man is a piece
B15 0970 12    of the continent, a part of the main".
B15 0980  6       Thanks to the generosity of Mr& Irving J& Fain,
B15 0990  4    president of the Temple Beth El; Rev& DeWitt Clemens,
B15 1000  3    pastor of the Mathewson Street Methodist Church; Mr&
B15 1010  2    Felix Miranda, of the Imperial Knife Co&; and to Mrs&
B15 1020  1    Rozella Switzer, regional director of The National
B15 1020  8    Conference of Christians and Jews, who asked them to
B15 1030  9    serve as a committee for the fund. It is through them
B15 1040  7    that we have become aware of the divine humanity in
B15 1050  3    man, and therefore, that most people are noble, helpful
B15 1060  1    and good.
B15 1060  3       Bless you my friends, for it is through love and
B15 1060 13    service that brotherhood becomes a reality. @
B15 1080  1       I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School.
B15 1080 10    My future plans are to become a language teacher. Of
B15 1090  9    course, having this desire, I am very interested in
B15 1100  6    education.
B15 1100  7       A few weeks ago, I read in the Bulletin that there
B15 1110  6    were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston. The article
B15 1120  3    also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over,
B15 1130  2    and must not be going to high school to attend these
B15 1130 13    classes.
B15 1140  1       The following week, I read in the Sunday paper that
B15 1140 11    the students of Russia begin European and Asian languages
B15 1150  8    in the seventh grade.
B15 1160  1       I wish you could see the situation as I see it.
B15 1160 12    If Russian pupils have to take these languages, how
B15 1170  8    come American students have a choice whether or not
B15 1180  6    to take a language, but have to face so many exceptions?
B15 1190  2       I do not think that America is like Russia, not
B15 1200  2    in the least! I am proud of my country, the small city
B15 1200 14    I live in, my wonderful parents, my friends and my
B15 1210  9    school; but I am also a young, able and willing girl
B15 1220  7    who wants to study the Chinese language but is not
B15 1230  4    old enough.
B15 1230  6       Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced
B15 1240  4    than American students. Well, there lies your answer.
B15 1250  1    @
B15 1260  1       At the height of the first snowstorm we had, it
B15 1260 11    was impossible for me to get medical attention needed
B15 1270  8    during an emergency.
B15 1270 11       However, the East Providence Rescue Squad made its
B15 1280  8    way through to my home in time of desperation.
B15 1290  6       Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and
B15 1300  3    comfort their service gave to me. The concern they
B15 1310  1    felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for
B15 1310 13    which I will always be grateful.
B15 1320  3       The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for
B15 1330  2    the fine work they do in all kinds of weather. Had
B15 1330 13    they not gotten me to the hospital when they did, perhaps
B15 1340  9    I would not be here to commend them at this time.
B15 1350  6       Many thanks for a job well done. @
B15 1360  1       The Providence Sunday Journal article (Jan& 29)
B15 1360  8    asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized
B15 1370  6    by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans
B15 1380  9    who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds
B15 1390  2    as though The Providence Journal is desperate for news.
B15 1400  2    Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space
B15 1400 12    on the front page.
B15 1410  2       On the question of admission to Veterans Administration
B15 1420  1    hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected
B15 1420  9    disabled veterans, it must be recognized that there
B15 1430  8    are many men who are greatly affected by war service.
B15 1440  5    It can manifest itself before discharge from service,
B15 1450  2    or it can come out years later. There is one other
B15 1450 13    point we should never lose sight of: Many veterans
B15 1460  9    who enter ~VA hospitals as non-service cases later
B15 1470  6    qualify as service-connected. No psychiatrist could
B15 1480  2    tell me that the experience in a war can not have its
B15 1490  1    effect in the ensuing years.
B15 1490  6       The arguments advanced by those individuals and
B15 1500  2    groups who oppose the system in force and who would
B15 1500 12    drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital
B15 1510  8    care for the non-service-connected case, seem to be
B15 1520  5    coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes
B15 1530  3    of the general public.
B15 1530  7       I believe in priority for service-connected disabled
B15 1540  4    veterans in admission to ~VA hospitals. But I don't
B15 1550  4    believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected
B15 1560  1    patients. This matter is of great importance, and the
B15 1560 10    outcome may mean the difference between life or death,
B15 1570  8    or at least serious injuries, for many veterans.
B15 1580  4       Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital
B15 1590  4    is too long. There's a reason for this length of stay.
B15 1600  1    First of all, the admitting physician in the ~VA hospital
B15 1600 11    gets the patient as a new patient. He has no experience
B15 1610 11    with this veteran's previous medical record. If the
B15 1620  6    doctor is conscientious, he wants to study the patient.
B15 1630  5    As a result, it takes a little longer than it would
B15 1640  3    on the outside where the family physician knows about
B15 1640 12    the patient.
B15 1650  1       Secondly, the ~VA physician knows that when the
B15 1650  9    patient leaves the hospital, he is no longer going
B15 1660  9    to have a chance to visit his patient. So he keeps
B15 1670  6    the veteran in until he can observe the effects of
B15 1680  2    treatment or surgery.
B15 1680  5       The American public must be presented with the facts
B15 1690  4    concerning ~VA hospitalization. The public should understand
B15 1700  3    that whether they support a state hospital or a ~VA
B15 1710  1    hospital, the tax dollar has to be paid one way or
B15 1710 12    the other. The responsibility is still going to be
B15 1720  7    there whether they pay for a ~VA hospital or the tax
B15 1730  5    dollar is spent for the state hospital. An adequate
B15 1740  2    system of ~VA hospitals is better equipped to care
B15 1740 11    for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals. @
B15 1760  1       It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization
B15 1760  9    is once more upon us. The American Medical Association
B15 1770  9    is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda
B15 1780  7    based upon the high cost of the Veterans Administration
B15 1790  3    medical program to the American taxpayer. Do they,
B15 1800  3    the A&M&A&, offer any solution other than outright
B15 1810  1    abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere
B15 1810  8    in the world?
B15 1820  1       We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes
B15 1820 10    the demand for medical care at ~VA hospitals will grow
B15 1830  9    proportionately as age fosters illness. Nevertheless,
B15 1840  4    we wonder at the stand of the A&M&A& on the health
B15 1850  4    problem confronting the aged. They opposed the Forand
B15 1860  3    bill, which would have placed the major burden of financial
B15 1870  1    support upon the individual himself through compulsory
B15 1870  8    payroll deduction; yet they supported the Eisenhower
B15 1880  6    administration which will cost a small state like ours
B15 1890  7    approximately five million dollars (matched incidentally
B15 1900  2    by a federal grant) to initiate.

B16 0030  3    feelings of frustration, exasperation, exhaustion,
B16 0030  8    and even panic. This we can sympathetically understand.
B16 0040  7    But no President ever before referred to his as a "lousy
B16 0050  8    job" [as Walter Trohan recently quoted President Kennedy
B16 0060  4    as doing in conversation with Sen& Barry Goldwater].
B16 0070  3       During his aggressive campaign to win his present
B16 0080  3    position, Mr& Kennedy was vitriolic about this country's
B16 0090  1    "prestige" abroad. What does he think a remark like
B16 0090 10    this "lousy" one does to our prestige and morale?
B16 0100  8       If the President of the United States really feels

B16 0130  1    _EVANSVILLE, IND&, AUG& 5_
B16 0130  4       - Defense Secretary Robert S& McNamara has asked
B16 0140  3    Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters
B16 0150  1    costing about 200 million dollars. Why should Congress
B16 0150  9    even consider allowing such a sum for that which can
B16 0160  9    give no protection?
B16 0170  1       Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an
B16 0170 11    atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in
B16 0180  7    a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a
B16 0190  4    long time. The scientists have also warned that no
B16 0190 13    life above ground or underground, sheltered or unsheltered
B16 0200  8    could be expected to survive in an area at least 50
B16 0210  9    miles in diameter.
B16 0210 12       This sum spent for foreign economic aid, the peace
B16 0220  9    corps, food for peace, or any other program to solve
B16 0230  7    the problems of the underdeveloped countries would
B16 0240  2    be an investment that would pay off in world peace,

B16 0280  1    _CHICAGO, AUG& 4_
B16 0280  3       - It seems college isn't what it should be. I refer
B16 0280 13    to the attire worn by the students. Upon a visit to
B16 0290 11    a local junior college last week, I was shocked to
B16 0300  7    see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young
B16 0310  4    men wearing Bermuda shorts.
B16 0310  8       Is this what our children are to come face to face
B16 0320  9    with when they are ready for college in a few years?
B16 0330  1    Education should be uppermost in their minds, but with
B16 0340  2    this attire how can anyone think it is so? It looks
B16 0340 13    more like they are going to play at the beach instead
B16 0350 10    of taking lessons on bettering themselves.
B16 0360  2       High school students have more sense of the way
B16 0370  2    to dress than college students. Many high school students
B16 0370 11    go past my house every day, and they look like perfect
B16 0380 10    ladies and gentlemen. No matter how hot the day, they
B16 0390  8    are dressed properly and not in shorts. @

B16 0470  1    _OAK PARK, AUG& 8_
B16 0470  1       - In today's "Voice", the ~CTA is urged to reduce
B16 0470 10    fares for senior citizens. Rising costs have increased
B16 0480  8    the difficulties of the elderly, and I would be the
B16 0490  9    last to say they should not receive consideration.
B16 0500  2    But why is it the special responsibility of the ~CTA
B16 0510  1    to help these people?
B16 0510  5       Why should ~CTA regular riders subsidize reduced
B16 0520  3    transportation for old people any more than the people
B16 0530  2    who drive their own cars or walk to work should? The

B16 0570  4    #MARKETING MEAT#
B16 0570  6    _CHICAGO, AUG& 9_
B16 0570  9       - In reply to a letter in today's "voice" urging
B16 0580  9    the sale of meat after 6 p& m&, I wish to state the
B16 0590  9    other side of the story.
B16 0600  1       I am the wife of the owner of a small, independent
B16 0600 11    meat market. My husband's hours away from home for
B16 0610  6    the past years have been from 7 a& m& to 7 p& m& the
B16 0620  7    early part of the week, and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends.
B16 0630  5    Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings-
B16 0640  3    and Sundays, too, for this is coming.
B16 0640 10       There is a trend to packaging meat at a central
B16 0650  6    source, freezing it, and shipping it to outlying stores,
B16 0660  2    where meat cutters will not be required. If a customer
B16 0670  1    wishes a special cut, it will not be available. We
B16 0670 11    are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged,
B16 0680  6    whether we want it or not.
B16 0690  1       Most women, in this age of freezers, shop for the
B16 0690 11    entire week on week-ends, when prices are lower. Also,
B16 0700  9    many working wives have children or husbands who take
B16 0710  5    over the shopping chores for them.
B16 0720  1       Independent market owners work six days a week;
B16 0720  9    and my husband hasn't had a vacation in 14 years. No,
B16 0730  8    we are not greedy. But if we closed the store for a
B16 0740  5    vacation, we would lose our customers to the chain
B16 0750  1    stores in the next block.
B16 0750  6       The meat cutters' union, which has a history of
B16 0760  4    being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area,
B16 0770  1    represents the little corner markets as well as the
B16 0770 10    large supermarkets. What it is trying to do is to protect
B16 0780 10    the little man, too, as well as trying to maintain
B16 0790  5    a flow of fresh meat to all stores, with choice of
B16 0800  2    cut being made by the consumer, not the store. @
B16 0800 12    #THE LEGION CONVENTION AND SIDNEY HOLZMAN#

B16 0810  8       - I, too, congratulate the American Legion, of which
B16 0820  7    I am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years,
B16 0830  8    on the recent state convention.
B16 0840  1       I regret that Bertha Madeira [today's "Voice"] obtained
B16 0850  1    incorrect information. Had I been granted the floor
B16 0850  9    on a point of personal privilege, the matter she raised
B16 0860  7    would have been clarified.
B16 0870  1       The resolution under discussion at the convention
B16 0870  8    was to require the boards of election to instruct judges
B16 0880  8    to properly display the American flag. Judges under
B16 0890  5    the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of election commissioners
B16 0900  3    are instructed to do this.
B16 0900  8       The resolution further asked that polling place
B16 0910  6    proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for
B16 0920  5    the display of the flag.
B16 0920 10       It was my desire to advise the membership of the
B16 0930  7    Legion that the majority of polling places are on private
B16 0940  5    property and, without an amendment to the law, we could
B16 0950  3    not enforce this. My discussion with reference to the
B16 0950 12    resolution was that we should commend those citizens
B16 0960  8    who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge
B16 0970  6    their duty and polling place proprietors who make available
B16 0980  4    their private premises, and not by innuendo criticize
B16 0990  2    them. At no time did I attempt to seek approval or
B16 0990 13    commendation for the members of the Chicago board of
B16 1000  9    election commissioners for the discharge of their duties.

B16 1330  2    [Editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere
B16 1330  9    on this page.]
B16 1340  2    _WASHINGTON, AUG& 4_
B16 1340  5       - Your July 26 editorial regarding the position
B16 1350  3    of Attorney General Robert F& Kennedy on prospective
B16 1360  1    tax relief for du Pont stockholders is based on an
B16 1360 11    erroneous statement of fact. As a result, your criticism
B16 1370  9    of Attorney General Robert F& Kennedy and the department
B16 1380  7    of justice was inaccurate, unwarranted and unfair.
B16 1390  4       The editorial concerned legislative proposals to
B16 1400  2    ease the tax burden on du Pont stockholders, in connection
B16 1410  1    with the United States Supreme court ruling that du
B16 1410 10    Pont must divest itself of its extensive General Motors
B16 1420  7    stock holdings. These proposals would reduce the amount
B16 1430  5    of tax that du Pont stockholders might have to pay-
B16 1440  4    from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present
B16 1450  1    law to as little as 192 million dollars.
B16 1450  9       Congressman Wilbur D& Mills, chairman of the House
B16 1460  6    Ways and Means committee, asked the department of justice
B16 1470  5    for its views on these legislative proposals as they
B16 1480  3    related to anti-trust law enforcement. The attorney
B16 1480 11    general responded by letter dated July 19. Copies of
B16 1490  9    this letter were made avaliable to the press and public.
B16 1500  7       In this letter, Mr& Kennedy made it clear that he
B16 1510  6    limited his comment only to one consideration- what
B16 1520  4    effect the legislative proposals might have on future
B16 1520 12    anti-trust judgments. There are a number of other considerations
B16 1530  9    besides this one but it is for the Congress, not the
B16 1540 11    department of justice, to balance these various considerations
B16 1550  6    and make a judgment about legislation.
B16 1560  1       Yet your editorial said: "Now the attorney general
B16 1570  1    writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of
B16 1570  9    revenue of this proportion'". What Mr& Kennedy, in
B16 1580  6    fact, wrote was: "It is the department's view that
B16 1590  6    no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any
B16 1600  3    loss of revenue of this proportion".
B16 1610  1       The editorial, by omitting the words anti-trust
B16 1610  8    enforcement, totally distorted Mr& Kennedy's views.
B16 1620  5    The headline is offensive, particularly in view of
B16 1630  4    the total inaccuracy of the editorial. @

B16 1780  1    _PROVIDENCE, AUG& 5_
B16 1780  3       - Overt socialism means government ownership and
B16 1780  9    management of a nation's main industries. In covert
B16 1790  8    socialism- toward which America is moving- private
B16 1800  6    enterprise retains the ownership title to industries
B16 1810  4    but government thru direct intervention and excessive
B16 1820  1    regulations actually controls them.
B16 1820  5       In order to attract new industries, 15 states or
B16 1830  6    more are issuing tax free bonds to build government
B16 1840  2    owned plants which are leased to private enterprise.
B16 1840 10    This is a step toward overt socialism.
B16 1850  7       Issuing bonds for plant construction has brought
B16 1860  3    new industries to certain regions.

B17 0010  8       Sir- We are writing in reference to a recent "suggestion"
B17 0020  8    made to the staff of the Public Health Nursing Service
B17 0030  7    of Jersey City (registered professional nurses with
B17 0040  4    college background and varying experiences). The day
B17 0050  3    before Election Day, to which we are entitled as a
B17 0050 13    legal holiday, we were informed to report to our respective
B17 0060  9    polls to work as "workers of the party".
B17 0070  4       Being ethical and professional people interested
B17 0080  2    in community health and well-being, we felt this wasn't
B17 0090  1    a function of our position. Such tactics reek of totalitarianism!
B17 0100  1    As we understand, this directive was given to all city
B17 0100 11    and county employes.
B17 0110  1       To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been
B17 0110 11    employed because of political affiliation. We, therefore,
B17 0120  7    considered the "suggestion" an insult to our intelligence,
B17 0130  6    ethics, Bill of Rights, etc&. Our only obligation for
B17 0140  6    this day is to vote, free of persuasion, for the person
B17 0150  4    we feel is capable in directing the public.
B17 0160  1       This is our duty- not as nurses or city employes-
B17 0160 11    but as citizens of the United States. @
B17 0170  6    #"PLUS-ONE" SHELTERS#
B17 0180  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0180  2       Sir- I read of a man who felt he should not build
B17 0190  1    a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish
B17 0190 12    for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters.
B17 0200  9    Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are
B17 0210  6    free loaders unwilling to help themselves, but ready
B17 0220  3    to demand that "the community" help and protect them?
B17 0230  1       Community shelters are, of course, necessary for
B17 0230  8    those having no space for shelter. If in a town of
B17 0240 10    2,000 private homes, half of them have shelters, the
B17 0250  5    need for the community shelters will be reduced to
B17 0260  2    that extent.
B17 0260  4       In designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing
B17 0270  3    to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's
B17 0270 13    occupants, "plus-one"- so he will be able to take in
B17 0280 11    a stranger. I hope the man who plans to sit on his
B17 0290 10    hands until the emergency comes will have a change
B17 0300  5    of heart, will get busy and be the first member of
B17 0310  1    our "plus-one" shelter club. @
B17 0310  7    #ESCAPE#
B17 0320  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0320  1       Sir- People continue to inquire the reason for the
B17 0320  9    race for outer space. It's simple enough from my point
B17 0330  8    of view. I am for it.
B17 0340  1       It is the only method left for a man to escape from
B17 0340 13    a woman's world. @
B17 0350  3    #SUPPORTS KATANGA#
B17 0350  5    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0350  8       Sir- When the colonies decided upon freedom from
B17 0360  7    England, we insisted, through the Declaration of Independence,
B17 0370  5    that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate
B17 0380  5    political entity. It is high time the United States
B17 0390  2    began to realize that the God-given rights of men set
B17 0390 13    forth in that document are applicable today to Katanga.
B17 0400  9       In the United Nations Charter, the right of self-determination
B17 0410  8    is also an essential principle. This, again, applies
B17 0420  5    to Katanga. The people of Katanga had fought for, and
B17 0430  5    obtained, their freedom from the Communist yoke of
B17 0440  3    Antoine Gizenga, and his cohorts. By political, economic,
B17 0440 11    geographic and natural standards, they were justified
B17 0450  7    in doing so.
B17 0460  1       The United States and the U&N& denounce their own
B17 0460 10    principles when they defend the Communist oppressors
B17 0470  7    and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination
B17 0480  6    of the Katangans. @
B17 0480 10    #COUNTY COLLEGE COSTS#
B17 0490  3    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0490  6       Sir- Permit me to commend your editorial in which
B17 0500  5    you stress the fact that a program of county colleges
B17 0510  2    will substantially increase local tax burdens and that
B17 0510 10    taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such
B17 0520 11    a program would commit them to.
B17 0530  3       The bill which passed the Assembly last May and
B17 0540  1    is now pending in the Senate should be given careful
B17 0540 11    scrutiny. The procedure for determining the amounts
B17 0550  5    of money to be spent by county colleges and raised
B17 0560  3    by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.
B17 0560 10       Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees
B17 0570 11    of a county college will be appointed; none will be
B17 0580  8    elected. The trustees will prepare an annual budget
B17 0590  6    for the college and submit it to the board of school
B17 0600  3    estimate. This board will consist of two of the trustees
B17 0610  1    of the college, and the director and two members of
B17 0610 11    the board of freeholders. It will determine the amount
B17 0620  6    of money to be spent by the college and will certify
B17 0630  4    this amount to the board of freeholders, which "shall
B17 0640  1    appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations
B17 0640  9    are made by it the amount so certified and the amount
B17 0650 10    shall be assessed, levied and collected in the same
B17 0660  6    manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes".
B17 0670  1       The approval of only three members of the board
B17 0670 10    of school estimate is required to certify the amount
B17 0680  9    of money to be allotted to the college. Since two of
B17 0690  7    these could be trustees of the college, actually it
B17 0700  3    would be necessary to have the consent of only one
B17 0700 13    elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars
B17 0710 10    of tax revenue. This is taxation without representation.

B17 0730  3    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0730  6       Sir- Your editorial, "Housing Speedup", is certainly
B17 0740  5    not the answer to our slum problems. The very rules
B17 0750  4    and regulations in every city are the primary case
B17 0760  2    of slum conditions.
B17 0760  5       Change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged
B17 0770  4    to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.
B17 0780  1    Then see what a boom in all trades, as well as slum
B17 0780 13    clearance at no cost to taxpayers, will happen. Our
B17 0790  9    entire economy will have a terrific uplift. @
B17 0800  5    #"NATURAL CAUSES"#
B17 0810  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0810  1       Sir- An old man is kicked to death by muggers. The
B17 0810 11    medical examiner states that death was due to "natural
B17 0820  8    causes".
B17 0820  9       I once heard a comedian say that if you are killed
B17 0830 10    by a taxicab in New York, it is listed as "death due
B17 0840  7    to natural causes". @
B17 0840 11    #PRAISES EXHIBIT#
B17 0850  2    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B17 0850  5       Sir- Every resident of this city should visit the
B17 0860  4    Newark Museum and see the exhibit "Our Changing Skyline
B17 0870  2    in Newark". It will be at the museum until March 30.
B17 0880  1       It is a revelation of what has been done, what is
B17 0880 12    being done and what will be done in Newark as shown
B17 0890 10    by architects' plans, models and pictures. It shows
B17 0900  5    what a beautiful city Newark will become and certainly
B17 0910  2    make every Newarker proud of this city.
B17 0910  9       It should also make him desire to participate actively
B17 0920  8    in civic, school and religious life of the community
B17 0930  5    so that that phase of Newark will live up to the challenge
B17 0940  5    presented by this exhibit. @

B17 0950  4       Sir- I hasten to join in praise of the men in the
B17 0960  4    toll booths on the Garden State Parkway. Recently I
B17 0960 13    traveled the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and
B17 0970 10    I found the most courteous group of men you will find
B17 0980  8    anywhere. One even gave my little dog a biscuit. It
B17 0990  5    was very refreshing. @
B17 1000  1    #"DEEP PEEP SHOW"#
B17 1000  4    The viewers of the "deep Peep Show" at 15th and ~M
B17 1010  5    streets nw& have an added attraction- the view of a
B17 1020  3    fossilized cypress swamp. Twenty feet below the street
B17 1020 11    level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed
B17 1030 11    on this site, a black coal-like deposit has been encountered.
B17 1040  7       This is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred
B17 1050  7    million years ago cypress-like trees were growing.
B17 1060  3    The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found
B17 1070  1    embedded in the clay. Some of the stumps are as much
B17 1070 12    as three feet long, but most of them have been flattened
B17 1080  9    by the pressure of the overlying sediments. Although
B17 1090  3    the wood has been changed to coal, much of it still
B17 1100  4    retains its original cell structure.
B17 1100  9       In the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains
B17 1110  6    and spores which came from plants growing in the region
B17 1120  5    at the time. These microfossils indicate the swamp
B17 1130  2    was "formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when
B17 1130 10    dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering
B17 1140 10    plants were just appearing.
B17 1150  1       The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with
B17 1160  1    the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on
B17 1160  9    17th Street reported in The Washington Post, August
B17 1170  6    2, 1955, which was probably formed during the second
B17 1180  5    interglacial period and is therefore much younger.

B17 1190  2    #WORKING FOR PEACE#
B17 1190  5    Recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on
B17 1200  3    National Legislation was interviewed on the air. While
B17 1210  2    I respect his sincere concern for peace, he made four
B17 1210 12    points that I would like to question.
B17 1220  7    _1._
B17 1220  8       He said, "Let's work for peace instead of protection
B17 1230  5    from aggression". I would ask, "Why not do both"? Military
B17 1240  5    power does not cause war; war is the result of mistrust
B17 1250  3    and lack of understanding between people. Are we not
B17 1260  1    late, especially those of us who call ourselves Friends,
B17 1260 10    in doing enough about this lack of understanding?
B17 1270  6    _2._
B17 1270  7       As to protection, the speaker disapproved of shelters,
B17 1280  6    pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone.
B17 1290  5    Is this a reason for saving no one? Would the man with
B17 1300  4    an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because
B17 1300 14    his boat could not pick up everyone?
B17 1310  7    _3._
B17 1310  8       The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack
B17 1320  8    world would be too awful to face. If the world comes
B17 1330  5    to this, wouldn't it be the very time when courage
B17 1340  1    and American know-how would be needed to help survivors
B17 1340 11    rebuild? Many of our young people think it would.
B17 1350  9    _4._
B17 1350 10       Lastly, the speaker decried our organized program
B17 1360  5    of emergency help calling it "Civilian Defense". In
B17 1370  3    1950, Public Law 920 created Civil Defense (different
B17 1380  2    from Civilian-groups of World War /2,), a responsibility
B17 1390  1    of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss
B17 1390 11    of life and property in disaster, natural or manmade.
B17 1400  6       Far from creating fear, as the speaker suggests,
B17 1410  5    preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency- gives
B17 1420  4    people confidence. Civil Defense has far to go and
B17 1430  1    many problems to solve, but is it not in the best spirit
B17 1430 13    of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing, but
B17 1440  8    prepared to care for our own families and help our
B17 1450  4    neighbors in any disaster- storm, flood, accident or
B17 1460  2    even war? @
B17 1460  5    #PETS IN APARTMENTS#
B17 1460  8    It seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments
B17 1470  5    are denied the right of providing themselves with the
B17 1480  3    protection and companionship of dogs. I feel that few
B17 1490  1    burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's
B17 1490 11    apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl
B17 1500 10    that a dog would provide. In addition, would not the
B17 1510  5    young female public of Washington be afforded a greater
B17 1520  3    degree of protection at night when they are on the
B17 1520 13    streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?
B17 1530 11       I grant that the dog may not be really protective,
B17 1540  8    based on his training, but if you were roaming the
B17 1550  4    streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady
B17 1560  1    to molest, how quick would you be to attack a person
B17 1560 12    strolling with a dog? I would like to suggest that
B17 1570  9    the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider
B17 1580  5    liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments.

B17 1590  5    #SIDEWALK CAFES#
B17 1590  7    Use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe?
B17 1600  6    Could Senator Humphrey be serious in his proposal?
B17 1610  4    Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists'
B17 1620  1    comfort?
B17 1620  2       Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended.
B17 1630  3    The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak.
B17 1640  1    Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not
B17 1640 13    have to travel too far to eat? Unfortunately the cafes
B17 1650  8    might not make enough money to support themselves during
B17 1660  5    the off season. As an added suggestion to balance the
B17 1670  4    budget, the Government could sell advertising space
B17 1680  1    on the Washington Monument. It is visible throughout
B17 1680  9    the city, and men from Madison ave& would jump at the
B17 1690  9    chance. @

B18 0020  1    _SOVIETS SAID TO FEAR RESURGENCE OF GERMAN MILITARISM_
B18 0020  3       @
B18 0020  4    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 0030  1       For the first time in history the entire world is
B18 0030 11    dominated by two large, powerful nations armed with
B18 0040  5    murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare
B18 0050  2    of the past a nullity. The United States and Soviet
B18 0060  1    Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations.
B18 0060 10    Recent statements by well-known scientists regarding
B18 0070  6    the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and
B18 0080  7    the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still
B18 0090  3    the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead
B18 0100  1    of negotiations.
B18 0100  3       President Kennedy was right when he said, "We shall
B18 0110  2    never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear
B18 0110 12    to negotiate". I have just returned from a seven-week
B18 0120  9    trip to Europe and the Far East. It is quite evident
B18 0130  8    that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly
B18 0140  3    opposed to participation in a nuclear war. The fact
B18 0150  2    is that the Italians, French and British know that
B18 0150 11    they have no defense against nuclear bombs. We have
B18 0160  8    no right to criticize them, as they realize they would
B18 0170  6    be sitting ducks in a nuclear war.
B18 0180  1       We should stand firmly and courageously for our
B18 0180  9    right to free access into Berlin. It would be criminal
B18 0190  7    folly if the Communists tried to prevent us. But there
B18 0200  5    is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting
B18 0210  2    de facto recognition to East Germany. Soviet Russia
B18 0210 10    has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation.
B18 0220 10    In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed
B18 0230  8    and its lands and factories were devastated.
B18 0240  3    _PROBABLE AGREEMENT_
B18 0240  5       The truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence
B18 0250  5    of German militarism. Berlin is merely being used by
B18 0260  4    Moscow as a stalking horse. Actually, the Communists,
B18 0270  1    out of fear of a united and armed Germany, would probably
B18 0270 12    be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would
B18 0280  9    be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed
B18 0290  6    by the U& N&.
B18 0290 10       If the Communists are sincere in wanting a united,
B18 0300  9    neutral and disarmed Germany, it might well be advantageous
B18 0310  7    for the German people in this nuclear age. It could
B18 0320  5    provide security without cost of armaments and increase
B18 0330  2    German prosperity and lessen taxation. France and other
B18 0330 10    Western European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany.
B18 0340  8    If the German people favor such a settlement we should
B18 0350  8    not oppose Germany following the example of Austria.
B18 0360  5       President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament
B18 0370  5    that might be called "Operation Survival" which has
B18 0380  3    many facets. Why not make a beginning with a united
B18 0380 13    and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity
B18 0390  7    from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big
B18 0400  7    Four powers and the United States? A united Germany,
B18 0410  4    freed of militarism, might be the first step toward
B18 0420  1    disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured
B18 0420  9    world. @

B18 0450  1    you make the following comment: "Far too many states
B18 0450 10    are following the Russian example in refusing to pay
B18 0460  8    their assessments. It is up to the Assembly to take
B18 0470  8    action against them. They are violating their Charter
B18 0480  3    obligation, the prescribed penalty for which is suspension
B18 0490  1    of membership or expulsion".
B18 0490  5       I would like to quote from the Charter of the United
B18 0500  6    Nations:
B18 0500  7       "Article 17, Section 1: The General Assembly shall
B18 0510  6    consider and approve the budget of the Organization.
B18 0520  4       "Section 2: The expenses of the Organization shall
B18 0530  3    be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General
B18 0540  1    Assembly.
B18 0540  2       "Article 19: A Member of the United Nations which
B18 0550  2    is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions
B18 0560  1    to the Organization shall have no vote in the General
B18 0560 11    Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds
B18 0570  9    the amount of the contributions due from it for the
B18 0580  6    preceding two full years".
B18 0580 10       The U& S& S& R& and her followers are careful in
B18 0590 10    paying their obligations to the regular budget. But
B18 0600  6    they refuse, as do the Arab states, to support the
B18 0610  4    United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United
B18 0620  1    Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer
B18 0620 11    between Egypt and Israel, and the U& N& troops in the
B18 0630 11    Congo, which expenses are not covered by the regular
B18 0640  8    budget of the United Nations, but by a special budget.
B18 0650  6       According to the official interpretation of the
B18 0660  3    Charter, a member cannot be penalized by not having
B18 0660 12    the right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment
B18 0670 10    of financial obligations to the "special" United Nations'
B18 0680  7    budgets, and of course cannot be expelled from the
B18 0690  7    Organization (which you suggested in your editorial),
B18 0700  4    due to the fact that there is no provision in the Charter
B18 0710  2    for expulsion. @

B18 0720  1    _CONNALLY AMENDMENT'S REPEAL HELD STEP TOWARD WORLD
B18 0720  7    ORDER_
B18 0720  8       @
B18 0730  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 0730  7       In your Sept& 27 editorial appraisal of the work
B18 0740  4    of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress
B18 0750  1    you referred to the lack of "consciousness of destiny
B18 0750 10    in a time of acute national and world peril". Yet your
B18 0760  9    list of things left undone did not include repeal of
B18 0770  7    the Connally amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction
B18 0780  3    reservation to its Adherence to the Statute of the
B18 0790  3    International Court of Justice.
B18 0790  7       The Connally amendment says that the United States,
B18 0800  7    rather than the court, shall determine whether a matter
B18 0810  5    is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of
B18 0820  2    the United States in a case before the World Court
B18 0820 12    to which the United States is a party. If the case
B18 0830 10    is thus determined by us to be domestic, the court
B18 0840  6    has no jurisdiction.
B18 0840  9       Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving
B18 0850  7    the same right to the other party to a dispute with
B18 0860  6    the United States, it also prevents us from using the
B18 0870  3    court effectively. Yet although the Kennedy Administration,
B18 0880  1    and the Eisenhower Administration before it, have both
B18 0880  9    declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally
B18 0890  7    amendment, as contrary to our best interests, no action
B18 0900  6    has yet been taken.
B18 0900 10       Our "destiny" in these perilous times should be
B18 0910  7    to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace, with justice,
B18 0920  5    under law. To achieve this destiny, acts as well as
B18 0930  4    words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical
B18 0930 14    strength but also acts that lead to strength based
B18 0940  9    on right doing and respect.
B18 0950  1       What better affirmative step could be taken to this
B18 0950 10    end than repeal of the Connally amendment- an act which
B18 0960 10    could expose the United States to no practical risk
B18 0980  7    yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward
B18 0990  3    the court, enable us to utilize it, and advance in
B18 1000  2    a tangible way the cause of international law and order?
B18 1010  1       We believe that the list of vital things left undone
B18 1010 11    to date by the Eighty-seventh Congress should have
B18 1020  6    included repeal by the Senate of the Connally amendment.

B18 1040  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 1040  8       Many home-bound subway riders utilizing the Flushing-Main
B18 1050  5    Street express are daily confronted with the sight
B18 1060  3    of the local departing from the Woodside station as
B18 1060 12    their express comes to a stop, leaving them stranded
B18 1070  9    and strained. To the tens of thousands who must transfer
B18 1080  7    to ride to Seventy-fourth Street and change for the
B18 1090  5    ~IND, this takes a daily toll of time and temper.
B18 1100  1       The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation
B18 1110  1    "hold" lights at ~BMT Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth
B18 1110 10    Street stations in Brooklyn. This "holds" the local
B18 1120  8    until the express passengers change trains. Without
B18 1130  5    question, this time and temper saver should be immediately
B18 1140  4    installed at the Woodside station. @
B18 1140 10    #PHONE SERVICE CRITICIZED#
B18 1160  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_
B18 1160  1       As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly,
B18 1160 12    from three to four hours a day.
B18 1170  6       In the last few years the telephone company has
B18 1180  2    managed to automate many areas of their service. It
B18 1180 11    has not been any great mental effort on my part to
B18 1190 10    keep up with this mechanization which has brought about
B18 1200  5    new ways of dialing.
B18 1200  9       However, there are still several types of calls
B18 1210  7    that necessitate the use of telephone operators. I
B18 1220  3    have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the
B18 1230  1    young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls,
B18 1230 10    special long-distance calls, etc&. Either it is lack
B18 1240  7    of training, lack of proper screening when hiring,
B18 1250  4    lack of management or possibly lack of interest on
B18 1260  2    the part of the telephone company, which does have
B18 1260 11    a Government-blessed monopoly.

B18 1280  4    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1280  7       I disagree with the writer who says funeral services
B18 1290  6    should be government-controlled. The funeral for my
B18 1300  3    husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price,
B18 1300 15    far less than I had expected to pay. But the hospitals
B18 1310 11    and doctors should be. @
B18 1320  3    #HELPING RETARDED CHILDREN#
B18 1320  6    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1320  9       Recently I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School
B18 1330  8    for retarded children.
B18 1340  1       Hazel Park donates its recreation center, five days
B18 1340  9    a week, to the school. There is no charge and no state
B18 1350 12    aid. Kiwanis, American Legion and other groups donate
B18 1360  7    small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring
B18 1370  6    in dollars for its support.
B18 1370 11       There are 70 children there and the mothers donate
B18 1380  8    one day a week to the school. Reading, writing and
B18 1390  4    simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts
B18 1400  1    as working in brass. They make beautiful objects.
B18 1400  9       Enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger
B18 1410 10    station wagon. Southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger
B18 1420  7    bus (the heater in which needs repair since some of
B18 1430  6    the children ride a long distance and need the heat).
B18 1440  3       The school is located at 9-1/2 Mile road, Woodward
B18 1450  1    Heights. Visitors are welcome to come see what these
B18 1450 10    dedicated mothers can do. @
B18 1460  5    #JOBS FOR CAVANAGH#
B18 1460  8    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B18 1460 11       I was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat, but perhaps
B18 1470  9    Mayor-elect Cavanagh can accomplish some things that
B18 1480  7    should have been done years ago. Maybe he can clean
B18 1490  6    out the white elephants in some of the city departments
B18 1500  2    such as welfare, ~DPW and sanitation. Negligence in
B18 1510  1    garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning
B18 1510  8    is great.
B18 1510 10       He should put the police back to patrolling and
B18 1520  9    walking the streets at night. There should be better
B18 1530  6    bus service and all of our city departments and their
B18 1540  3    various branches need a general and complete overhauling.
B18 1550  1       Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I
B18 1550  9    have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case.
B18 1560  9       Drunken truck drivers in the city departments should
B18 1570  6    be weeded out. Educate the city employes to give real
B18 1580  4    service to the public. After all, they are paid by
B18 1590  1    the public, they should be examples. @

B18 1600  6       At a recent meeting of the Women's Association of
B18 1610  3    the Trumbull Ave& United Presbyterian Church, considerable
B18 1620  3    use was made of material from The Detroit News on the
B18 1630  3    King James version of the New Testament versus the
B18 1630 12    New English Bible.
B18 1640  2       Some members of the organization called attention
B18 1650  1    also to the article on hymns of inspiration, the Daily
B18 1650 11    Prayer and Three Minutes a Day, as being very helpful.
B18 1660  9       We feel that The Detroit News is to be complimented
B18 1670  8    upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we
B18 1680  6    hope that it will continue to provide material along
B18 1690  2    wholesome lines. @

B18 1700  1       Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on
B18 1700 10    the public apathy to impudence.
B18 1710  3       How old do you have to be to remember when Americans,
B18 1720  1    especially children, were encouraged to be polite?
B18 1720  8    Why has this form of gentility gone out of American
B18 1730  9    life?
B18 1730 10       How can we old-fashioned parents, who still feel
B18 1740  8    that adults are due some respect from children, battle
B18 1750  4    the new type of advertising that appears on ~TV without
B18 1760  3    denying the children the use of television entirely?
B18 1770  1    Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the
B18 1770 10    attitude of "modern" parents they have observed. From
B18 1780  6    necessity, they are also inspired by the "hard-sell"
B18 1790  5    attitude of the sponsor, so, finally, it is the sponsor
B18 1800  4    who must take the responsibility for the good or bad
B18 1800 14    taste of his advertising. @

B19 0040  5    those horrible automobiles. We have now a quiet city,
B19 0050  2    fewer automobiles, less congestion, and fewer retail
B19 0050  9    customers shopping in center city. Good for Mr& Trimmer.

B19 0080  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0080  7       I worked on the Schuylkill Expressway and if it
B19 0090  5    had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete
B19 0100  3    there wouldn't be an Expressway. Without these massive
B19 0110  1    trucks highways would still be just an idea of the
B19 0110 11    future.
B19 0120  1       Mr& George Hough (Oct& 30) sounds like a business
B19 0120  9    man who waits until the last minute to leave his home
B19 0130  9    or shop. The trucks today help pay for this highway.
B19 0140  6    They try to keep within the speed limits. Although
B19 0150  2    today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars, a truck
B19 0150 12    driver has to be a sensible person and guard against
B19 0160 10    hogging the road. @

B19 0170 12       The letter writer who suggested saving money by
B19 0180  8    taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed
B19 0190  6    his letter "SIMPLETON" instead of "SIMPLICITUDE". Such
B19 0200  3    kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or
B19 0210  4    in jail where they become a much bigger burden. There
B19 0210 14    are lots of jobs available for trained high school
B19 0220  9    graduates, but not for the dropouts. What we need is
B19 0230  7    more vocational training in high schools, not more

B19 0240  5    #TWO WRONGS#
B19 0250  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0250  2       I suppose I am missing some elementary point but
B19 0250 11    I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right!
B19 0260 10    I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere
B19 0270  6    tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is. Will
B19 0280  4    our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less
B19 0290  1    harmful to future generations of children? If an atom
B19 0290 10    bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the
B19 0300  8    atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to
B19 0310  6    fulfill any military objective required of it.
B19 0320  1       As I see it, if war starts and we survive the initial
B19 0320 13    attack enough to be able to fight back, the nuclear
B19 0330 10    weapons we now have- at least the bombs- can inflict
B19 0340  7    all the demage that is necessary. Why do we need bigger
B19 0350  5    and better bombs? I repeat, two wrongs do not make

B19 0520  7       Just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped
B19 0530  5    on Japan were to end a war not start one. The war could
B19 0540  5    have continued many years with many thousands killed
B19 0550  1    on both sides. Intelligent people will admit that bombs
B19 0550 10    and rockets of destruction are frightening whether
B19 0560  6    they fall on Japan, London or Pearl Harbor. That is
B19 0570  6    why the United Nations was formed so that intelligent
B19 0580  2    men with good intentions from all countries could meet
B19 0590  1    and solve problems without resorting to war.
B19 0590  8       Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs

B19 0620  1    #BELATED TRIBUTE#
B19 0620  3    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0620  9       While "better late than never" may have certain
B19 0630  8    merits, the posthumous award of the Nobel Prize for
B19 0640  7    Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold strikes me as less
B19 0650  5    than a satisfactory expression of appreciation. Had
B19 0660  1    it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the
B19 0660 10    United Nations was living, unquestionably he would
B19 0670  6    have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult
B19 0680  4    and, in many ways, thankless task.
B19 0680 10       According to one report, however, Mr& Hammarskjold
B19 0690  7    was considered "too controversial" a figure to warrant
B19 0700  6    bestowal of the coveted honor last spring. Actually,
B19 0710  3    of course, that label "controversial" applied only
B19 0720  2    because he was carrying out the mandate given him by
B19 0720 12    the world organization he headed rather than following
B19 0730  7    the dictates of the Soviet Union.
B19 0740  2       At Khrushchev's door, therefore, can be placed the
B19 0750  2    primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted
B19 0750 12    themselves to be intimidated. It is well for us to
B19 0760 10    remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone
B19 0770  5    for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.
B19 0780  1    As has happened so often in the past, the ability to
B19 0780 12    recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy.

B19 0800  7       Just a brief note of appreciation to Vice President
B19 0810  5    Johnson and Pakistani camel driver Bashir Ahmad for
B19 0820  4    providing a first-class example of "people to people"
B19 0830  1    good will. If only this could be done more often- with
B19 0830 12    such heartening results- many of the earth's "big problems"
B19 0840  9    would shrink to the insignificances they really are.
B19 0850  8       P& S&. Thanks for your good coverage of Ahmad's
B19 0860  7    visit, too! @
B19 0860 10    #EXPRESSWAY ANSWER: EAST RIVER DRIVE#
B19 0880  1    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 0880  1       Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill
B19 0880  7    Expressway are valuable; however, several pertinent
B19 0890  6    considerations deserve recognition.
B19 0900  1       One of the problems associated with the expressway
B19 0910  1    stems from the basic idea. We shuffle a large percentage
B19 0910 11    of the cars across the river twice. They start on the
B19 0920  9    East side of the Schuylkill, have to cross over to
B19 0930  6    the West to use the expressway and cross over again
B19 0940  2    to the East at their destination. Bridges, tunnels
B19 0940 10    and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings.
B19 0950  9    Each one of these is, by its nature, a focal point
B19 0960  8    or a point of natural congestion. We should avoid these
B19 0970  4    congestion points or, putting it another way, keep
B19 09  1    cars starting and ending on the East side of the river-
-B19 0980 12    on the East side.
B19 0990  2       This can be accomplished by several logical steps:
B19 1000  1    _(1)_
B19 1000  2       Widen the East River Drive at least one lane.
B19 1010  1    _(2)_
B19 1010  1       So widen it as to minimize the present curves and
B19 1010 11    eliminate drainage problems.
B19 1020  2    _(3)_
B19 1020  3       Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead
B19 1030  1    directional lights as on our bridges. One additional
B19 1030  9    lane would then be directional with the traffic burden
B19 1040  7    and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability
B19 1050  4    of the East River Drive by fifty percent.
B19 1060  1    _(4)_
B19 1060  2       This could be accomplished without the tremendous
B19 1060  9    expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway
B19 1070  6    and without destroying the natural beauty of the East
B19 1080  7    River Drive. @
B19 1080 10    #SHADOW OVER WASHINGTON SQUARE#
B19 1090  3    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 1090  9       I wish to advocate two drastic changes in Washington
B19 1100  8    Square:
B19 1100  9    _1._
B19 1100 10       Take away George Washington's statue.
B19 1110  5    _2._
B19 1110  6       Replace it with the statue of one or another of
B19 1120  7    the world's famous dictators.
B19 1120 11       There's no sense in being reminded of times that
B19 1130  9    were. Washington Square seems not part of a free land.
B19 1140  7    It may remind one of Russia, China or East Berlin;
B19 1150  3    but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington
B19 1160  1    and the Continental soldiers fought for.
B19 1160  7       The Fairmount Park Commission will no doubt approve
B19 1170  7    my two proposals, because it is responsible for the
B19 1180  5    change of ideological atmosphere in the Square. The
B19 1190  2    matter may seem a small thing to some people, I know,
B19 1190 13    but it's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism
B19 1200 10    **h The Commission has posted signs in Washington Square
B19 1210  7    saying:
B19 1210  8       The Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in This Square.
B19 1220  9       Fairmount Park Commission
B19 1230  3       Does each tentacle of the octopus of City Government
B19 1240  3    reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers
B19 1250  1    an annoyance? If birds don't belong in a Square or
B19 1250 11    Park, what does? They are the most beautiful part of
B19 1260  9    that little piece of Nature. The trees are their homes;
B19 1270  6    but the Commission does not share such sentiments.
B19 1280  3       The whole official City apparently has an intense
B19 1290  2    hatred toward birds. Starlings and blackbirds are scared
B19 1290 10    off by cannon, from City Hall. Just a preliminary measure.
B19 1300 10    If any are left, presently, we may expect to see signs
B19 1310  9    specifically PROHIBITING the feeding of them too.
B19 1320  6       The City Government is not united in an all-out,
B19 1330  6    to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs, delinquents,
B19 1340  1    thugs, murderers, rapists, subversives. Indeed no.
B19 1340  7    Let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on
B19 1350  9    John and Jane Doe, lest one piece of bread be placed
B19 1360  6    undetected and one bird survive.
B19 1360 11       Of course, in this small way of forcing the people
B19 1370 10    to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures
B19 1380  5    die because we're afraid to feed them and afraid to
B19 1390  4    protest and say "How come? What's your motive? WHO
B19 1400  2    wants this deed done"?- in this small way do the leaders
B19 1410  3    of a city, or of a nation, iniure the masses to watching,
B19 1420  1    or even inflicting, torture and death, upon even their
B19 1420 10    fellow men.
B19 1430  1       One means to help the birds occurs to me: Let the
B19 1430 12    chimes that ring over Washington Square twice daily,
B19 1440  7    discontinue any piece of music but one. Let them offer
B19 1450  6    on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been
B19 1460  3    the joy of mankind since time began, the hymn "Abide
B19 1460 13    With Me". We will know, and He will know, to whom it
B19 1470 12    is rendered, what the birds would ask: @ @
B19 1480  7    #NOT PUSH-UPS BUT STAND-UPS#
B19 1480 13    _TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_
B19 1490  6       There is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans
B19 1500  5    are too "soft". Unfortunately, those who would remedy
B19 1510  3    our "softness" seek to do so with calisthenics. They
B19 1520  1    are working on the wrong part of our anatomy. It is
B19 1520 12    not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown
B19 1530  9    too soft. Ashamed of our wealth and power, afraid of
B19 1540  5    so-called world opinion and addicted to peace, we have
B19 1550  3    allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed
B19 1550 12    policies.
B19 1560  1       When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals
B19 1560 11    which we know to be right, when we become hard enough
B19 1570 11    to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination,
B19 1580  7    when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts
B19 1590  6    towards socialism in our own Nation, when we recognize
B19 1600  3    that our enemy is Communism not war, and when we realize
B19 1610  1    that concessions to Communists do not insure peace
B19 1610  9    or freedom, then, and only then will we no longer be
B19 1620  9    "soft". America doesn't need to "push-up", she needs
B19 1630  6    to stand up! @
B19 1640  1    #DISPUTES STANS COLUMN BUSINESS SCANDAL VIEWS#
B19 1650  1    _TO THE EDITOR:_
B19 1650  1       The new column by Maurice Stans regarding business
B19 1650  9    scandals, is fair and accurate in most respects and
B19 1660  8    his solution to the problem has some merit. However,
B19 1670  4    he states unequivocally "the scandals in business are
B19 1680  2    far less significant than the scandals in labor". I
B19 1680 11    must, in fairness, take issue with his premise, primarily
B19 1690  9    because the so-called scandals in labor unions were
B19 1700  6    very much connected with business scandals.
B19 1710  1       The area most prominently commented on during the
B19 1710  9    McClellan hearings had to do with "sweetheart contracts".
B19 1720  8    These arrangements would have been impossible if the
B19 1730  7    business community was truly interested in the welfare
B19 1740  5    of its employes. A sweetheart arrangement can come
B19 1750  3    about as often by employers doing the corrupting as
B19 1750 12    by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute. Anyone
B19 1760  6    familiar with the details of the McClellan hearings
B19 1770  5    must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements
B19 1780  2    augmented employer profits far more than they augmented
B19 1790  1    the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.
B19 1790  8       Further, it should be recalled that some very definite
B19 1800  8    steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in
B19 1810  5    the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum-Griffin
B19 1820  3    Act.
B20 0010  1    #ESCALATION UNTO DEATH#
B20 0010  4    The nuclear war is already being fought, except that
B20 0020  3    the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not
B20 0020 13    yet. It is being fought, moreover, in fairly close
B20 0030  9    correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers
B20 0040  6    of the think factories. They predicted escalation,
B20 0050  2    and escalation is what we are getting. The biggest
B20 0050 11    nuclear device the United States has exploded measured
B20 0060  8    some 15 megatons, although our ~B-52s are said to be
B20 0070  9    carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece. Some time ago,
B20 0080  5    however, Mr& Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs
B20 0090  3    were made, the Soviet Union would make them. He seems
B20 0100  1    to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on
B20 0100 14    hand, since we cannot assume that he has exploded his
B20 0110  7    entire stock. And now, of course, the hue and cry for
B20 0120  6    counter-escalation is being raised on our side. Khrushchev
B20 0130  2    threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb? So be it- then
B20 0140  1    we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs
B20 0140 12    of the common or hydrogen variety, and neutron bombs,
B20 0150  7    which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing.
B20 0160  6    So escalation proceeds, ad infinitum or, more accurately,
B20 0170  2    until the contestants begin dropping them on each other
B20 0180  1    instead of on their respective proving grounds.
B20 0180  8       What is needed, Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell
B20 0190  7    Daily Sun (October 26) is a discontinuity. The escalation
B20 0200  7    must end sometime, and probably quite soon. "Only a
B20 0210  5    discontinuity can end it", Professor Morrison writes.
B20 0220  2    "The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction,
B20 0230  1    or that of diplomatic policy".
B20 0230  6       Morrison points out that since our country is more
B20 0240  7    urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China, it is
B20 0250  4    the most vulnerable of the great powers- Europe of
B20 0260  1    course must be written off out of hand. He feels, therefore,
B20 0260 12    that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of
B20 0270  9    the United States is the least risky path our government
B20 0280  6    can take. His proposal is opposed to that of Richard
B20 0290  4    Nixon, Governor Rockefeller, past chairmen Strauss
B20 0300  1    and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr& Edward
B20 0300 10    Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of
B20 0310  9    triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war. These
B20 0320  6    gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing-
B20 0330  3    in the atmosphere- on the greatest possible scale,
B20 0330 11    all in the name of national security. Escalation is
B20 0340  9    their first love and their last; they will be faithful
B20 0350  7    unto death.
B20 0350  9       Capable as their minds may be in some directions,
B20 0360  7    these guardians of the nation's security are incapable
B20 0370  4    of learning, or even of observing. If this capacity
B20 0380  1    had not failed them, they would see that their enemy
B20 0380 11    has made a disastrous miscalculation. He has gained
B20 0390  6    only one thing- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and
B20 0400  6    he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob
B20 0410  3    it over the shorter intercontinental ranges. But if
B20 0410 11    his purpose was to inspire terror, his action could
B20 0420  9    hardly have miscarried more obviously. Not terror,
B20 0430  5    but anger and resentment have been the general reaction
B20 0440  2    outside the Soviet sphere.
B20 0440  6       Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by
B20 0450  6    the surge of animosity he has aroused, yet our own
B20 0460  3    nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively
B20 0460 10    in his footsteps. When one powerful nation strives
B20 0470  7    to emulate the success of another, it is only natural.
B20 0480  7    Thus, when the Russians sent up their first sputnik,
B20 0490  3    American chagrin was human enough, and American determination
B20 0500  1    to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly
B20 0500  9    understandable. But to imitate an opponent when he
B20 0510  8    has made the mistake of his life would be a new high
B20 0520  8    in statesmanlike folly.
B20 0520 11    #THE TIDE TURNS#
B20 0530  1    When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands,
B20 0530 11    paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists.
B20 0540  9    They are less vocal now, when it is the West Berliners
B20 0550  8    who are migrating. The flood is not as great- only
B20 0560  6    700 a week according to one apparently conservative
B20 0570  1    account- but it is symptomatic. West Berlin morale
B20 0570  8    is low and, in age distribution, the situation is unfavorable.
B20 0580  8    Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin's 2,200,000 residents
B20 0590  6    are sixty-five or older, only 12.8 per cent are under
B20 0600  7    fifteen.
B20 0600  8       R& H& S& Crossman, M&P&, writing in The Manchester
B20 0610  6    Guardian, states that departures from West Berlin are
B20 0620  6    now running at the rate not of 700, but of 1,700 a
B20 0630  5    week, and applications to leave have risen to 1,900
B20 0630 14    a week. The official statistics show that 60 per cent
B20 0640 10    are employed workers or independent professional people.
B20 0650  5    Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked
B20 0660  5    for months ahead. The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced
B20 0670  2    by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany, but the
B20 0680  1    hard truth, says Crossman, is that "The closing off
B20 0680 10    of East Berlin without interference from the West and
B20 0690  7    with the use only of East German, as distinct from
B20 0700  5    Russian, troops was a major Communist victory, which
B20 0710  2    dealt West Berlin a deadly, possibly a fatal, blow.
B20 0710 11    The gallant half-city is dying on its feet".
B20 0720  9       Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch
B20 0730  6    from Bonn in the Observer (London). Mark Arnold-Foster
B20 0740  4    writes: "People are leaving [West Berlin] because they
B20 0750  3    think it is dying. They are leaving so fast that the
B20 0760  2    president of the West German Employers' Federation
B20 0760  9    issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the
B20 0770  9    West to volunteer for six months' front-line work in
B20 0780  6    factories in West Berlin. Berlin's resilience is amazing,
B20 0790  4    but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle
B20 0800  2    will be hard indeed".
B20 0800  6       The handwriting is on the wall. The only hope for
B20 0810  5    West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down
B20 0820  3    the wall and reunite the city. State Department officials
B20 0830  1    refusing to show their passes at the boundary, and
B20 0830 10    driving two blocks into East Berlin under military
B20 0840  6    escort, will not avail. Tanks lined up at the border
B20 0850  5    will be no more helpful. The materials for compromise
B20 0860  1    are at hand: The Nation, Walter Lippmann and other
B20 0860 10    sober commentators (see Alan Clark on p& 367) have
B20 0870  9    spelled them out again and again. A compromise will
B20 0880  6    leave both sides without the glow of triumph, but it
B20 0890  4    will save Berlin. Or the city can be a graveyard monument
B20 0900  1    to Western intransigence, if that is what the West
B20 0900 10    wants.
B20 0900 11    #VACANCY#
B20 0910  1    The removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he
B20 0910 10    shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in
B20 0920  8    the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history. It
B20 0930  5    is, in fact, a relatively mild chastisement of the
B20 0940  3    dead. A British writer, Richard Haestier, in a book,
B20 0950  1    Dead Men Tell Tales, recalls that in the turmoil preceding
B20 0960  1    the French Revolution the body of Henry /4,, who had
B20 0960 11    died nearly 180 years earlier, was torn to pieces by
B20 0970  9    a mob. And in England, after the Restoration, the body
B20 0980  5    of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn. The
B20 0990  3    head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster, and the
B20 1000  1    rest of the body was buried under the gallows.
B20 1000 10       Contemplating these posthumous punishments, Stalin
B20 1010  5    should not lose all hope. In 1899, Parliament erected
B20 1020  3    a statue to Cromwell in Westminster, facing Whitehall
B20 1030  2    and there, presumably, he still stands. Nikita Khrushchev,
B20 1040  1    however, has created yet another problem for himself.
B20 1040  9    The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy,
B20 1050  7    Moscow is a crowded city, and the creed of communism
B20 1060  6    deplores waste. Who will take Stalin's place beside
B20 1070  3    Lenin? There is Karl Marx, of course, buried in London.
B20 1090  1    The Macmillan government might be willing to let him
B20 1090 10    go, but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even
B20 1100  8    the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable.
B20 1110  6    Who, then, is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin?
B20 1120  4    Who but Nikita himself? Since he has just shown who
B20 1130  3    is top dog, he may not be ready to receive this highest
B20 1130 15    honor in the gift of the Soviet people. Besides, he
B20 1140 10    can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death
B20 1150  6    which, what with exhumations and rehabilitations, seems
B20 1160  2    to match that of life. Suppose he did lie beside Lenin,
B20 1170  1    would it be permanent? If some future Khrushchev decided
B20 1170 10    to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor,
B20 1180  9    would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions
B20 1190  6    applauding his dispossession? When a man is laid to
B20 1200  6    rest, he is entitled to stay put. If Nikita buys a
B20 1210  2    small plot in some modest rural cemetery, everyone
B20 1210 10    will understand.
B20 1220  1    #U THANT OF BURMA#
B20 1220  5    The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U&N&'s Acting
B20 1230  3    Secretary General- at this writing, the choice appears
B20 1240  2    to be certain- offers further proof that in politics
B20 1250  1    it is more important to have no influential enemies
B20 1250 10    than to have influential friends. Mongi Slim of Tunisia
B20 1260  6    and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites
B20 1280  2    in the running, but France didn't like the former and
B20 1290  3    the Soviet Union would have none of the latter. With
B20 1290 13    the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their
B20 1300  8    own to succeed Mr& Hammarskjold, U Thant emerged as
B20 1320  6    the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid
B20 1330  4    by a veto. What is interesting is that his positive
B20 1340  1    qualifications for the post were revealed only as a
B20 1340 10    kind of tail to his candidacy. In all the bitter in-fighting,
B20 1350  9    the squabbles over election procedures, the complicated
B20 1360  4    numbers game that East and West played on the assistant
B20 1370  4    secretaries' theme, the gentleman from Burma showed
B20 1380  1    himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat.
B20 1380 12    He has, moreover, another qualification which augurs
B20 1390  6    well for the future. He is a Buddhist, which means
B20 1400  7    that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are
B20 1410  4    not only religious dogma, but a profound and unshakable
B20 1420  1    Weltanschauung.
B20 1420  2       U Thant of course, will hold office until the spring
B20 1430  3    of 1963, when Mr& Hammarskjold's term would have come
B20 1440  1    to an end. Whether the compromises- on both sides-
B20 1440 10    that made possible the interim appointment can then
B20 1450  7    be repeated remains to be seen. Mr& Khrushchev's demand
B20 1460  4    for a troika is dormant, not dead; the West may or
B20 1470  5    not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that
B20 1480  2    U Thant represents. In a sense, the showdown promised
B20 1480 11    by Mr& Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been
B20 1490  8    avoided; no precedents have been set as yet; structurally,
B20 1500  7    the U&N& is still fluid, vulnerable to the pressures
B20 1510  6    that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to
B20 1520  4    bear upon it. But at least the pessimists who believed
B20 1530  1    that the world organization had plunged to its death
B20 1530 10    in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong.
B20 1540  9    #TO THE HILLS, GIRLS#
B20 1550  1    No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose
B20 1550 11    that words are their sole staple in trade. These are
B20 1560  8    mentalities which crave action- and they are beginning
B20 1570  7    to get it, as Messrs& Salsich and Engh report on page
B20 1580  4    372. Even in areas where political connotations are
B20 1590  1    (deliberately?) left vague, the spirit of vigilantism
B20 1590  8    is spreading. Friends, a picture magazine distributed
B20 1600  6    by Chevrolet dealers, describes a paramilitary organization
B20 1610  4    of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley,
B20 1620  4    Alabama. "If the day should ever come that foreign
B20 1630  2    invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast", the account
B20 1630 11    reads, "they can count on heavy opposition from a group
B20 1640 10    of commando-trained telephone employees- all girls.
B20 1650  5    **h Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving Civil
B20 1660  6    Defense outfit, 23 operators and office personnel **h
B20 1670  3    stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice".
B20 1680  1    According to Friends, the unit was organized by John
B20 1680 10    Snook, a former World War /2, commando who is vice
B20 1690 10    president and general manager of the telephone company.
B20 1700  6    The girls, very fetching in their uniforms, are shown
B20 1710  4    firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck;
B20 1720  1    they are also trained with carbines, automatic weapons,
B20 1720  9    pistols, rifles and other such ladies' accessories.
B20 1730  7       This may be opera bouffe now, but it will become
B20 1740  7    more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy. The
B20 1750  5    country is committed to the doctrine of security by
B20 1760  2    military means. The doctrine has never worked; it is
B20 1760 11    not working now. The official military establishment
B20 1770  6    can only threaten to use its nuclear arms; it cannot
B20 1780  6    bring them into actual play. A more dangerous formula
B20 1790  2    for national frustration cannot be imagined. As the
B20 1790 10    civic temper rises, the more naive citizens begin to
B20 1800  9    play soldier- but the guns are real. Soon they will
B20 1810  8    begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are
B20 1820  4    in our midst.
B21 0010  1    All false gods resemble Moloch, at least in the early
B21 0010 11    phases of their careers, so it would be unreasonable
B21 0020  7    to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread
B21 0030  4    without the accompaniment of human sacrifice. But there
B21 0040  3    is reason in all things, and in this country the heathenish
B21 0050  1    cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its
B21 0050 12    demands. The annual butchery of 40,000 American men,
B21 0060  6    women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive;
B21 0070  6    a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient.
B21 0080  3       No other popular idol is accorded even that much
B21 0090  1    grace. If the railroads, for example, regularly slaughtered
B21 0090  9    25,000 passengers each year, the high priests of the
B21 0100  9    cult would have cause to tremble for their personal
B21 0110  6    safety, for such a holocaust would excite demands for
B21 0120  3    the hanging of every railroad president in the United
B21 0120 12    States. But by comparison with the railroad, the motor
B21 0130  9    car is a relatively new object of popular worship,
B21 0140  6    so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within
B21 0150  5    the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.
B21 0160  1       Yet it is plainly time to make a start, and to be
B21 0160 13    effective the first move should be highly dramatic,
B21 0170  8    without being fanatical. Here, then, is what Swift
B21 0180  5    would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning.
B21 0190  3    From next New Year's Day let us keep careful account
B21 0200  1    of each successive fatality on the highways, publicizing
B21 0200  9    it on all media of communication. To avoid suspicion
B21 0210  7    of bigotry, let the hand of vengeance be stayed until
B21 0220  6    the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth
B21 0230  2    corpse; but let the twenty-five thousand and first
B21 0230 11    butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state
B21 0240 11    highway commissioners.
B21 0250  1       Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass
B21 0250 12    execution on July 4, 1963. The scene, of course, should
B21 0260 10    be nine miles northwest of Centralia, Illinois, the
B21 0270  5    geographical center of population according to the
B21 0280  3    census. A special grandstand, protected by awnings
B21 0280 10    from the midsummer sun of Illinois, should be erected
B21 0290  9    for occupancy by honored guests, who should include
B21 0300  6    the ambassadors of all those new African nations as
B21 0310  3    yet not quite convinced that the United States is thoroughly
B21 0320  2    civilized. The band should play the Rogues' March as
B21 0320 11    a processional, switching to "Hail Columbia, Happy
B21 0330  7    Land"! as the trap is sprung.
B21 0340  5       Independence Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical
B21 0350  4    reminder of the American article of faith that governments
B21 0360  1    are instituted among men to secure to them certain
B21 0360 10    inalienable rights, the first of which is life, and
B21 0370  9    when any government becomes subversive of that end,
B21 0380  4    it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.
B21 0390  2    The highway system is an agency of government, and
B21 0390 11    when it grinds up 40,000 Americans every year the government
B21 0400  8    is destroying its own taxpayers, which is obviously
B21 0410  5    a silly thing for any government to do.
B21 0420  1       Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish
B21 0420  8    the government, but would emphasize its accountability
B21 0430  6    for the lives of its individual citizens, which would
B21 0440  4    certainly alter it, and definitely for the better.
B21 0450  3    Moreover, the salubrious effects would not be exclusively
B21 0460  1    political, but at least partially, and perhaps primarily
B21 0460  9    social. It would challenge sharply not the cult of
B21 0470  8    the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs
B21 0480  5    and practices- for instance, the doctrine that the
B21 0490  3    fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither
B21 0490 11    to yon, not for any advantage to be gained by arrival
B21 0500 10    but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis, or,
B21 0510  6    as it is generally termed, staying put.
B21 0520  1       True, the adherents of staying put are now reduced
B21 0520 10    to a minor, even a miniscule sect, and their credo,
B21 0530  8    "Home-keeping hearts are happiest", is as disreputable
B21 0540  5    as Socinianism. Nonetheless, although few in number
B21 0550  4    they are a stubborn crew, as tenacious of life as the
B21 0560  1    Hardshell Baptists, which suggests that there is some
B21 0560  9    kind of vital principle embodied in their faith. Perhaps
B21 0570  7    there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the
B21 0580  7    conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia, Robert Ruark's
B21 0590  3    grandfather, who was persuaded that the great curse
B21 0600  1    of the modern world is "all this gallivantin'".
B21 0600  9       In any event, the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims
B21 0610  8    is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most
B21 0620  7    ardent faith. Somehow our contemporary Moloch must
B21 0630  2    be induced to see reason. Since appeals to morality,
B21 0630 11    to humanity, and to sanity have had such small effect,
B21 0640  9    perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example.
B21 0650  5    If we make it established custom that whenever butchery
B21 0660  3    on the highways grows excessive, say beyond 25,000
B21 0670  1    per annum, then somebody is going to hang, it follows
B21 0670 11    that the more eminent the victim, the more impressive
B21 0680  8    the lesson. To hang 50 Governors might be preferable
B21 0690  5    except that they are not directly related to the highways;
B21 0700  4    so, all things considered, the highway commissioners
B21 0710  1    would seem to be elected. As the new clouds of radioactive
B21 0720  7    fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth,
B21 0730  4    the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime
B21 0740  1    against the human race. But the guilt is shared by
B21 0740 11    the United States, Britain and France, the other members
B21 0750  7    of the atomic club. Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing
B21 0760  5    last September 1, the ~US and ~UK had released more
B21 0770  5    than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as
B21 0780  2    the Russians, and the fallout from the earlier blasts
B21 0780 11    is still coming down. As it descends, the concentration
B21 0790  8    of radioactivity builds up in the human body; for a
B21 0800  8    dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes
B21 0810  4    temporary discomfort and then dies. The effect of radiation
B21 0820  2    is cumulative over the years- and on to succeeding
B21 0820 11    generations. So, while we properly inveigh against
B21 0830  7    the new poisoning, history is not likely to justify
B21 0840  6    the pose of righteousness which some in the West were
B21 0850  3    so quick to assume when Mr& Khrushchev made his cynical
B21 0860  1    and irresponsible threat. Shock, dismay and foreboding
B21 0860  8    for future generations were legitimate reactions; a
B21 0870  6    holier-than-thou sermon was not.
B21 0880  2       On October 19, after the Soviets had detonated at
B21 0880 11    least 20 nuclear devices, Ambassador Stevenson warned
B21 0890  7    the ~UN General Assembly that this country, in "self
B21 0900  7    protection", might have to resume above-ground tests.
B21 0910  6    More recently, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission,
B21 0920  3    Dr& Glenn T& Seaborg, "admitted" to a news conference
B21 0930  5    in Las Vegas, Nevada, that the ~US might fall behind
B21 0940  3    Russia (he apparently meant in weapons development)
B21 0940 10    if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while
B21 0950  9    we abstain. The trial balloons are afloat.
B21 0960  5       All of which makes it more imperative than ever
B21 0970  3    that the biological and genetic effects of fallout
B21 0970 11    be understood. But for the average citizen, unfortunately,
B21 0980  7    this is one of science's worst-marked channels, full
B21 0990  5    of tricky currents and unknown depths. The scientists,
B21 1000  4    in and out of government, do not agree on some of the
B21 1010  3    most vital points, at least publicly. On the one hand,
B21 1010 13    the Public Health Service declared as recently as October
B21 1020  8    26 that present radiation levels resulting from the
B21 1030  6    Soviet shots "do not warrant undue public concern"
B21 1040  4    or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances
B21 1050  2    by individuals or large population groups anywhere
B21 1050  9    in the ~US. But the ~PHS conceded that the new radioactive
B21 1060 10    particles "will add to the risk of genetic effects
B21 1070  9    in succeeding generations, and possibly to the risk
B21 1080  6    of health damage to some people in the United States".
B21 1090  2    Then it added: "It is not possible to determine how
B21 1100  2    extensive these ill effects will be- nor how many people
B21 1100 12    will be affected".
B21 1110  3       Having hedged its bets in this way, ~PHS apparently
B21 1120  2    decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination
B21 1130  1    after all: "At present radiation levels, and even at
B21 1130 10    somewhat higher levels, the additional risk is slight
B21 1140  8    and very few people will be affected". Then, to conclude
B21 1150  6    on an indeterminate note: "Nevertheless, if fallout
B21 1160  3    increased substantially, or remained high for a long
B21 1170  3    time, it would become far more important as a potential
B21 1170 13    health hazard in this country and throughout the world".
B21 1180  9       Dr& Linus Pauling, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry,
B21 1190  8    has been less ambiguous, whether you choose to agree
B21 1200  6    with him or not. After declaring, in an article last
B21 1210  4    month in Frontier magazine, that the Russian testing
B21 1220  1    "carries with it the possibility of the most tragic
B21 1220 10    consequences of any action in the history of the world",
B21 1230 10    he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences
B21 1240  7    if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons:
B21 1250  3       The damage to human germ plasm would be such that
B21 1260  3    in the next few generations 160,000 children around
B21 1260 11    the world would be born with gross physical or mental
B21 1270  9    defects. Long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process
B21 1280  5    would cause four million embryonic, neonatal or childhood
B21 1290  3    deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations,
B21 1300  1    and between 200,000 and one million human beings now
B21 1300 10    living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced
B21 1310  8    diseases such as leukemia. Most of these would be in
B21 1320  7    the Northern Hemisphere, where the fallout is concentrating.
B21 1330  3    Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present
B21 1340  3    series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be
B21 1350  1    too high, but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct
B21 1350 12    possibility.
B21 1360  1       The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects
B21 1360  9    of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering
B21 1370  7    large population groups, from which agreed-on generalizations
B21 1380  5    could be drawn. But more than one conscientious researcher
B21 1390  2    has been inhibited from completely frank discussion
B21 1400  1    of the available evidence by the less excusable fact
B21 1400 10    that fallout has been made a political issue as well
B21 1410  9    as a scientific problem. Its dangerous effects have
B21 1420  4    been downgraded to the public by some who believe national
B21 1430  2    security requires further testing. An illustration
B21 1430  8    of this attitude is found in John A& McCone's letter
B21 1440  9    to Dr& Thomas Lauritsen, reported in a note elsewhere
B21 1450  7    in this issue of The New Republic.
B21 1460  2       To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away
B21 1470  2    from discussing the health aspects of fallout. A recent
B21 1470 11    study on radiation exposure by the ~AEC's division
B21 1480  8    of biology and medicine stated: "The question of the
B21 1490  7    biological effect **h of [radiation] doses is not considered"
B21 1500  5    herein. Of course, the ~AEC is in a bind now. If it
B21 1510  8    comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout,
B21 1520  3    it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests.
B21 1530  1    So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet
B21 1530  9    shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences,
B21 1540  9    with the fission yield usually left vague.
B21 1550  3       Now, of course, that the Russians are the nuclear
B21 1560  2    villains, radiation is a nastier word than it was in
B21 1560 12    the mid-1950s, when the ~US was testing in the atmosphere.
B21 1570  9    The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be
B21 1580  7    that fallout, if not exactly good for you, might not
B21 1590  5    be much worse than a bad cold. After a nuclear blast,
B21 1600  1    one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days, about
B21 1600  9    all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep
B21 1610 10    off your sidewalks and roof. Things aren't that simple
B21 1620  4    anymore. Yet if Washington gets too indignant about
B21 1630  2    Soviet fallout, it will have to do a lot of fast footwork
B21 1640  1    if America decides it too must start pushing up the
B21 1640 11    radiation count.
B21 1650  1    #HOW MUCH FALLOUT WILL WE GET?#
B21 1650  7    As of October 25, the ~AEC had reported 24 shots in
B21 1660  6    the new Soviet series, 12 of them in a megaton range,
B21 1670  2    including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons
B21 1680  1    (the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of
B21 1680 11    ~TNT); and President Kennedy indicated there were one
B21 1700  7    or two more than those reported.
B21 1710  1       Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and
B21 1710 10    one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons,
B21 1720  8    a conservative computation is that the 24 announced
B21 1730  6    tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons.
B21 1740  2    Some government scientists say privately that the figure
B21 1750  1    probably is closer to 80 megatons, and that the full
B21 1750 11    50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still
B21 1760  6    be detonated.
B21 1760  8       If the new Soviet series has followed the general
B21 1770  7    pattern of previous Russian tests, the shots were roughly
B21 1780  6    half fission and half fusion, meaning a fission yield
B21 1790  3    of 30 to 40 megatons thus far. To this must be added
B21 1790 15    the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between
B21 1800 10    the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal
B21 1810  8    three-power test moratorium that began in November,
B21 1820  4    1958.
B22 0010  1    #RESUMING ATMOSPHERIC TESTS#
B22 0010  4    ONE OF THE inescapable realities of the Cold War is
B22 0020  6    that is has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically
B22 0030  3    unique set of moral dilemmas. The first dilemma was
B22 0040  1    the morality of nuclear warfare itself. That dilemma
B22 0040  9    is as much with us as ever. The second great dilemma
B22 0050  8    has been the morality of nuclear testing, a dilemma
B22 0060  4    which has suddenly become acute because of the present
B22 0070  1    series of Soviet tests.
B22 0070  5       When this second dilemma first became obvious- during
B22 0080  2    the mid to late '50's- the United States appeared to
B22 0090  3    have three choices. It could have unilaterally abandoned
B22 0100  1    further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard
B22 0100 10    to future generations. It could have continued testing
B22 0110  6    to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger
B22 0120  5    was far less than the danger of Communist world domination.
B22 0130  3    Or it could have chosen to find- by negotiation- some
B22 0140  4    way of stopping the tests without loss to national
B22 0140 13    security. This third choice was in fact made.
B22 0150  7       With the resumption of Soviet testing and their
B22 0160  4    intransigence at the Geneva talks, however, the hope
B22 0170  2    that this third choice would prove viable has been
B22 0170 11    shaken. Once again, the United States must choose.
B22 0180  7    And once again, the choices are much the same. Only
B22 0200  6    this time around the conditions are different and the
B22 0210  3    choice is far harder.
B22 0210  7       The first choice, abandoning tests entirely, would
B22 0220  3    not only be unpopular domestically, but would surely
B22 0230  1    be exploited by the Russians. The second choice, full
B22 0230 10    testing, has become even more risky just because the
B22 0240  8    current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated
B22 0250  4    the atmosphere. The third choice, negotiation, presupposes,
B22 0260  2    as Russian behavior demonstrates, a great deal of wishful
B22 0270  3    thinking to make it appear reasonable.
B22 0270  9       We take the position, however, that the third choice
B22 0280  7    still remains the only sane one open to us. It is by
B22 0290  8    no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the
B22 0300  3    arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.
B22 0310  1    Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice;
B22 0310 11    one which, should it fail, will not have contaminated
B22 0320  7    the conscience. That is the contamination we most fear.
B22 0330  5    ##
B22 0330  6    LEAVING ASIDE the choice of unilateral cessation of
B22 0340  3    tests as neither sane nor clearly moral, the question
B22 0350  1    must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests
B22 0350 10    on our part would not be a good choice. For that is
B22 0360 10    the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans
B22 0370  5    are now proposing. In particular, Governor Nelson Rockefeller
B22 0380  3    has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the
B22 0390  3    case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.
B22 0390 10       Speaking recently in Miami, Governor Rockefeller
B22 0400  6    said that "to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons
B22 0410  7    in the face of the recent Soviet tests, we are now
B22 0420  5    clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests".
B22 0430  1    Taking account of the fact that such a move on our
B22 0430 12    part would be unpopular in world opinion, he argued
B22 0440  7    that the responsibility of the United States is "to
B22 0450  4    do, confidently and firmly, not what is popular, but
B22 0460  2    what is right".
B22 0460  5       What was missing in the Governor's argument, as
B22 0470  3    in so many similar arguments, was a premise which would
B22 0480  1    enable one to make the ethical leap from what might
B22 0480 11    be militarily desirable to what is right. The possibility,
B22 0490  7    as he asserted, that the Russians may get ahead of
B22 0500  5    us or come closer to us because of their tests does
B22 0510  2    not supply the needed ethical premise- unless, of course,
B22 0510 11    we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear
B22 0520  7    superiority is now taken as a moral demand.
B22 0530  5       Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension
B22 0540  2    to the Governor's case, one can ask seriously whether
B22 0540 11    our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity
B22 0550  9    of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests
B22 0560  9    absolutely necessary. Recent statements by the President
B22 0570  4    and Defense Department spokesmen have, to the contrary,
B22 0580  2    assured us that our lead is very great. Unless the
B22 0580 12    Administration and the Defense Department have been
B22 0590  7    deceiving us, the facts do not support the assertion
B22 0600  6    that we are "compelled" to resume atmospheric testing.
B22 0610  2       It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of
B22 0620  2    atmospheric tests may, at some point in the future,
B22 0620 11    be necessary and even justifiable. But a resumption
B22 0630  7    does not seem justifiable now. What we need to realize
B22 0640  6    is that the increasingly great contamination of the
B22 0650  3    atmosphere by the Soviet tests has radically increased
B22 0650 11    our own moral obligations. We now have to think not
B22 0660 10    only of our national security but also of the future
B22 0670  7    generations who will suffer from any tests we might
B22 0680  3    undertake. This is an ethical demand which cannot be
B22 0680 12    evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon
B22 0690  9    superiority or even of the evil of Communism.
B22 0700  6       Too often in the past Russian tactics have been
B22 0710  4    used to justify like tactics on our part. There ought
B22 0720  1    to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves
B22 0720 12    to go regardless of what Russia does. The refusal to
B22 0730  8    resume atmospheric testing would be a good start.
B22 0740  6    #ECUMENICAL HOPES#
B22 0740  8    WHEN HIS Holiness Pope John /23, first called for an
B22 0750  8    Ecumenical Council, and at the same time voiced his
B22 0760  5    yearning for Christian unity, the enthusiasm among
B22 0770  2    Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate.
B22 0770  8    With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon
B22 0780 10    divided Christendom. But as the more concrete plans
B22 0790  6    for the work of the Council gradually became known,
B22 0800  2    there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment
B22 0800 10    on all sides. The Council we now know will concern
B22 0810  8    itself directly only with the internal affairs of the
B22 0820  6    Church.
B22 0820  7       As it has turned out, however, the excessive enthusiasm
B22 0830  4    in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second
B22 0840  5    were both wrong responses. Two things have happened
B22 0850  1    in recent months to bring the Council into perspective:
B22 0850 10    each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy.
B22 0860  8       First of all, it is now known that Pope John sees
B22 0870  6    the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely
B22 0880  4    necessary step toward Christian unity. Far from being
B22 0890  2    irrelevant to the ecumenical task, the Pontiff believes
B22 0890 10    that a revivified Church is required in order that
B22 0900  8    the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible
B22 0910  5    light. Equally significant, Pope John has said that
B22 0920  4    Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian
B22 0930  1    disunity. A major aim of the Council will be to remove
B22 0930 12    as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands
B22 0940 10    in the way of unity.
B22 0950  1       Secondly, a whole series of addresses and actions
B22 0950  9    by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian
B22 0960 10    unity is still very much alive and growing within the
B22 0970  7    Church. The establishment, by the Holy Father, of a
B22 0980  5    permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was
B22 0990  3    the most dramatic mark of this concern. The designation
B22 0990 12    of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council
B22 1000  9    of Churches assembly in New Delhi as "official" observers
B22 1010  8    reverses the Church's earlier stand. The public appeal
B22 1020  6    by the new Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Cicognani,
B22 1030  5    for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion
B22 1040  4    was still another remarkable act. Nor can one forget
B22 1050  2    Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop
B22 1050  9    of Canterbury.
B22 1060  1       Augustin Cardinal Bea, the director of the Secretariate
B22 1070  1    for Christian Unity, has expressed as directly as anyone
B22 1070 10    the new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward
B22 1080  9    the Protestant and Orthodox Churches. Noting all the
B22 1090  7    difficulties that stand in the way of reunion, he has
B22 1100  7    said that they ought not to discourage anyone. For
B22 1110  2    discouragement, or the temptation to abandon our efforts,
B22 1110 10    "would show that one placed excessive trust in purely
B22 1120  9    human means without thinking of the omnipotence of
B22 1130  6    God, the irresistible efficacy of prayer, the action
B22 1140  4    of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit". Can any
B22 1150  3    Christian fail to respond to these words?
B22 1150 10    #THE BUDGET DEFICIT#
B22 1160  1    THE ADMINISTRATION'S official budget review, which
B22 1160  7    estimates a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current
B22 1170  9    fiscal year, isn't making anyone happy. Certainly it
B22 1180  6    isn't making the President happy, and he has been doing
B22 1190  6    his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into
B22 1200  3    its unbalanced condition, how he intends to economize
B22 1200 11    wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next
B22 1210 11    year.
B22 1210 12       We sympathize with Mr& Kennedy, but we feel bound
B22 1220  8    to say that his budget review doesn't please us either,
B22 1230  5    although for very different reasons. Furthermore, we
B22 1240  3    find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying
B22 1250  1    than reassuring.
B22 1250  3       In the first place, a large part of the discrepancy
B22 1260  2    between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion
B22 1270  1    dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate
B22 1270 11    of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result
B22 1280  8    of the outgoing President's farewell gift of a political
B22 1290  6    booby-trap to his successor. The Eisenhower budget
B22 1300  2    was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and
B22 1310  1    yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be
B22 1310 10    received.
B22 1320  1       The rest of the deficit is also easily understood.
B22 1320  9    Four billion dollars of the spending increase is for
B22 1330  7    defense, an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise
B22 1340  5    policies of the Eisenhhower Administration, quite apart
B22 1350  2    from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere. Four
B22 1350 11    hundred million dollars of the increase is for the
B22 1360  9    expanded space program, a responsibility similarly
B22 1370  3    neglected by Mr& Eisenhower. The farm program will
B22 1380  2    cost an additional 1.5 billion, because of unusual
B22 1380 10    weather factors, the Food for Peace program and other
B22 1390  9    new measures. Anti-recession programs- aid for the
B22 1400  4    unemployed, their children and for depressed areas-
B22 1410  1    account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar
B22 1420  1    deficit.
B22 1420  2       Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the
B22 1420 11    Kennedy programs are not too large but too small, most
B22 1430 10    seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up
B22 1440  7    and in aid and welfare measures. And yet Mr& Kennedy
B22 1450  5    persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of
B22 1460  2    the right with apologies and promises of "tightening
B22 1460 10    up" and "economizing". We wish the President would
B22 1470  7    remember that "fiscal responsibility" was the battle-cry
B22 1480  6    of the party that lost the election. The party that
B22 1490  4    won used to say something about a New Frontier.
B22 1500  1    #ETHICS AND PEACE#
B22 1500  4    INTRODUCTION of the "dialogue" principle proved strikingly
B22 1510  3    effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the
B22 1520  3    Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington
B22 1540  1    the last weekend in October. Two of the principal addresses
B22 1540 11    were delivered by prominent Protestants, and when the
B22 1550  7    speaker was a Catholic, one "discussant" on the dais
B22 1560  6    tended to be of another religious persuasion.
B22 1570  2       Several effects were immediately evident. Sessions
B22 1580  1    devoted to "Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends", "Moral
B22 1580  9    Principle and Political Judgment", "Christian Ethics
B22 1590  6    in the Cold War" and related subjects proved to be
B22 1600  8    much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics
B22 1610  5    were merely talking to themselves. Usually questions
B22 1620  2    from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker
B22 1630  1    or discussion leader.
B22 1630  4       In the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion
B22 1640  2    on the natural law, which Dr& William V& O'Brien of
B22 1650  2    Georgetown University, advanced as the basis for widely
B22 1650 10    acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy. That
B22 1660  7    Aristotelean-Thomistic principle experienced a thorough
B22 1670  5    going-over from a number of the participants, but in
B22 1680  4    the end the concept came to reassert itself. Speakers
B22 1690  1    declared that Protestants often make use of it, if,
B22 1690 10    perhaps, by some other name. A Lebanese Moslem told
B22 1700  9    about its existence and application in the Islamic
B22 1710  5    tradition as the "divine law", while a C&A&I&P& member
B22 1720  3    who has been working in close association with delegates
B22 1730  3    of the new U&N& nations told of its widespread recognition
B22 1740  1    on the African continent. The impression was unmistakable
B22 1750  1    that, whatever one may choose to call it, natural law
B22 1750 11    is a functioning generality with a certain objective
B22 1760  6    existence.
B22 1760  7       Another question that arose was the nature of the
B22 1770  8    dialogue itself. The stimulus from the confrontation
B22 1780  3    of philosophical systems involving certain differences
B22 1790  1    was undeniable. It was expected that the comparison
B22 1790  9    of different approaches to ethics would produce a better
B22 1800  8    grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension
B22 1810  5    of one's own. But a realization that each group has
B22 1820  5    much of substance to learn from the other also developed,
B22 1830  1    and a strong conviction grew that each had insights
B22 1830 10    and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable
B22 1840  6    solutions of urgent political issues.
B22 1850  2       One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these
B22 1860  1    discussions was to focus attention on practical applications
B22 1860  9    and the necessity of being armed with the facts: knowledge
B22 1870  8    of the destructive force of even the tiniest "tactical"
B22 1880  7    atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as
B22 1890  4    to the advisability of its use- to defend Berlin, for
B22 1900  2    example; the pervasive influence of ideology on our
B22 1900 10    political judgments needs to be recognized and taken
B22 1910  8    into due account; it is necessary to perceive the extent
B22 1920  7    of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative.
B23 0010  1    Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question.
B23 0010 11    I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or,
B23 0020  8    even, of hypocrisy. I never found it among any of the
B23 0030  7    Chinese with whom I spoke, though granted they were,
B23 0040  3    almost all, members of the official family who, presumably,
B23 0050  1    harbor official thoughts. But I questioned, also, professional
B23 0050  9    soldiers, who would not easily be hypnotized by a
B23 0060  9    septuagenarian's
B23 0060 10    dreamy irredentism. Their answer was: it can be done,
B23 0070  9    and we will do it. And then I put the question as pointedly
B23 0080  9    as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek: "In America",
B23 0090  5    I said, "practically no one believes that you subjectively
B23 0100  5    intend to re-enter the Mainland. What evidence is there
B23 0110  4    of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes
B23 0120  2    to do just that, and that it can be done"?
B23 0120 12       He smiled. (He always smiles- at least at visitors,
B23 0130  8    I gather. He smiled also at a British bloke seated
B23 0140  7    next to me, who asked the most asinine questions. I
B23 0150  3    recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's
B23 0160  1    "My Last Duchess". **h) He smiled, and said a word
B23 0170  1    or two to the interpreter, who turned to me, "The President
B23 0170 12    wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei"?
B23 0180  9    That, I smarted, is a royal rebuff if ever there was
B23 0190  9    one.
B23 0190 10       I answered the routine question about my itinerary,
B23 0200  5    rather coolly. Chiang spoke again, this time at greater
B23 0210  4    length. "The President says", the translator came in,
B23 0220  3    "that the reason he asked you where you were going
B23 0220 13    is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas
B23 0230  9    in Southeast Asia, and that everywhere you went, you
B23 0240  6    would seek the answer to your question. He says that
B23 0250  4    if he were to express to you, once again, his own profound
B23 0260  1    determination to go to the Mainland, and his faith
B23 0260 10    that that return is feasible, he would merely sound
B23 0270  7    redundant. So you yourself must seek these objective
B23 0280  4    data, and come to your own conclusions. Any information
B23 0290  1    we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal".
B23 0290 10       Fair enough. What are the relevant data? For every
B23 0300  9    person on Taiwan, there are sixty in Mainland China.
B23 0310  6    If the raw population figures are crucially relevant,
B23 0320  3    then it is idle to think of liberation, as idle as
B23 0330  1    to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia. Relative
B23 0330  9    military manpower? Less than 60-1, but at least 6-1.
B23 0340 10    The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese
B23 0350  7    army. Say four million. The armed forces of Taiwan
B23 0360  4    are at a working strength of about 450,000, though
B23 0370  1    a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated.
B23 0370  9    Skill? Training? Morale? It is generally conceded that
B23 0380  7    the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia,
B23 0390  8    and the army the best trained. The morale is very high.
B23 0400  4       Even so, it adds up to impossible odds, except that
B23 0410  2    the question arises, On whose side would the Mainland
B23 0410 11    Chinese army fight?
B23 0420  3       The miserable people of China, the largest cast
B23 0430  1    ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play,
B23 0430  9    cannot themselves resist overtly. They think, perforce,
B23 0440  6    of physical survival: everything else is secondary.
B23 0450  5    But the army which Mao continues to feed well, where
B23 0460  3    are its sympathies? The psychological strategists in
B23 0470  1    Taiwan stress the great sense of family, cultivated
B23 0470  9    in China over thousands of years. It has not been extirpated
B23 0480  9    by ten years of Communist depersonalization. Every
B23 0490  3    soldier in the army has, somewhere, relatives who are
B23 0500  3    close to starvation. The soldiers themselves cannot
B23 0500 10    stage a successful rebellion, it is assumed: but will
B23 0510  9    their discontent spread to the officer class? The immediate
B23 0520  8    families of the generals and the admirals are well
B23 0530  6    fed: a despot does not economize on his generals. But
B23 0540  3    there are the cousins and aunts and nephews. Their
B23 0540 12    privations are almost beyond endurance. In behalf of
B23 0550  8    what? Leninism-Marxism, as understood by Exegete Mao.
B23 0560  6    To whom will the generals stay loyal? There is little
B23 0570  5    doubt if they had a secret ballot, they would vote
B23 0580  3    for food for their family, in place of ideological
B23 0580 12    purity out on the farm. It is another question whether
B23 0590  9    "they"- or a single general, off in a corner of China,
B23 0600  8    secure for a few (galvanizing?) days at least from
B23 0610  5    instant retaliation- will defy the Party. But the disposition
B23 0620  3    to rebel is most definitely there.
B23 0620  9    ##
B23 0620 10    But there must be a catalytic pressure. The military
B23 0630  8    in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two
B23 0640  6    mistakes, which, together, may prove fatal. The first
B23 0650  3    was the commune program, which will ensure agricultural
B23 0660  1    poverty for years. The family is largely broken up;
B23 0660 10    and where it is not, it is left with no residue, and
B23 0670 10    the social meaning of this is enormous. For it is the
B23 0680  6    family that, in China, has always provided social security
B23 0690  2    for the indigent, the sick, the down-and-out members
B23 0690 12    of the clan. Now the government must do that; but the
B23 0700 11    government is left with no reserve granary, under the
B23 0710  8    agricultural system it has ordained. Thus the government
B23 0720  4    simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social
B23 0730  2    security which had traditionally been privately discharged,
B23 0730  9    and created a national scarcity which has engendered
B23 0740  8    calamitous problems of social security.
B23 0750  4       The second mistake is Tibet. Tibet has historically
B23 0760  2    served China as a buffer state. A friendly state, sometimes
B23 0770  1    only semi-independent, but never hostile. China never
B23 0770  9    tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's
B23 0780  7    religion and institutions. Red China is trying to do
B23 0790  7    this, and she is not likely ever to succeed. Tibet
B23 0800  2    is too vast, the terrain is too difficult. Tibet may
B23 0800 12    bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France.
B23 0810  7       These continuing pressures, social, economic and
B23 0820  5    military, are doing much to keep China in a heightening
B23 0830  4    state of tension. The imposition of yet another pressure,
B23 0840  1    a strong one, from the outside, might cause it to snap.
B23 0840 12    ##
B23 0840 13    The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men.
B23 0850  9    They know that they must depend heavily on factors
B23 0860  7    outside their own control. First and foremost, they
B23 0870  4    depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime.
B23 0880  1    On these they feel they can rely. Secondly, they depend
B23 0880 11    on America's "moral cooperation" when the crucial moment
B23 0890  7    arrives. They hope that if history vouchsafes the West
B23 0900  8    another Budapest, we will receive the opportunity gladly.
B23 0910  5    I remarked jocularly to the President that the future
B23 0920  4    of China would be far more certain if he would invite
B23 0930  1    a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy
B23 0930  9    on an odd day. He affected (most properly) not to understand
B23 0940  9    my point. But he- and all of China- wear the scars
B23 0950 10    of American indecisiveness, and he knows what an uncertain
B23 0960  6    ally we are. We have been grand to Formosa itself-
B23 0970  1    lots of aid, and, most of the time, a policy of support
B23 0980  1    for the offshore islands. But our outlook has been,
B23 0980 10    and continues to be, defensive. A great deal depends
B23 0990  7    on the crystallization of Mr& Kennedy's views on the
B23 1000  5    world struggle. The Free Chinese know that the situation
B23 1010  3    on the Mainland is in flux, and are poised to strike.
B23 1020  1    There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a
B23 1020 11    more highly mobilized force for liberation. The moment
B23 1040  3    of truth is the moment of crisis. During the slow buildup,
B23 1050  1    the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under
B23 1050 12    embroidered details, fine words, strutting gestures.
B23 1060  5    The crisis burns these suddenly away. There the truth
B23 1070  5    is, open to eyes that are willing to look. The moment
B23 1080  2    passes. New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed
B23 1080 10    on the too-naked bones.
B23 1090  2       A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for
B23 1100  1    a couple of days this month, to be quickly smothered
B23 1100 11    by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap
B23 1110  8    for such emergencies. Before memory, too, clouds over,
B23 1120  4    let us make a note or two of what could be seen.
B23 1130  1       The measure was instantly taken, as always in such
B23 1130 10    cases, of public men at many levels. One knows better,
B23 1140  9    now, who has bone and who has jelly in his spine. But
B23 1150  7    I am here concerned more with policy than with men.
B23 1160  4    Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.
B23 1170  1       Now, everyone knows- or knew in the week of December
B23 1170 11    10- that something had gone shockingly wrong with American
B23 1180 11    foreign policy. The United States was engaged in a
B23 1190  8    military attack on a peaceful, orderly people governed
B23 1200  4    by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-Western
B23 1210  3    and anti-Communist within any of the new nations- the
B23 1220  2    only place in Africa, moreover, where a productive
B23 1220 10    relationship between whites and blacks had apparently
B23 1230  7    been achieved. Of course the fighting was officially
B23 1240  4    under the auspices of the United Nations. But in the
B23 1250  3    moment of truth everyone could see that the U&S& was
B23 1260  1    in reality the principal.
B23 1260  5       The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis
B23 1270  4    our policy ran counter to that of all our ~NATO allies,
B23 1280  2    to the entire Western community. By our policy the
B23 1280 11    West was- is- split.
B23 1290  5       But the key revelation is not new. The controlling
B23 1300  1    pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis
B23 1300 10    of November 1956. It reappears, in whole or part, whenever
B23 1310  9    a new crisis exposes the reality: in Cuba last spring
B23 1320  8    (with which the Dominican events of last month should
B23 1330  6    be paired); at the peaks of the nuclear test and the
B23 1340  4    Berlin cycles; in relation to Laos, Algeria, South
B23 1350  1    Africa; right now, with almost cartoon emphasis, in
B23 1350  9    the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana.
B23 1360  8    #WHAT THE MOMENTS REVEAL#
B23 1370  2    This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows:
B23 1380  1    Under prevailing policy, the U& S& can take the initiative
B23 1390  1    against the Right, but cannot take the initiative against
B23 1390 10    the Left. It makes no difference what part of the world
B23 1400 10    is involved, what form of regime, what particular issue.
B23 1410  6    The U& S& cannot take the initiative against the Left.
B23 1420  5    There is even some question whether the U& S& can any
B23 1430  6    longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left.
B23 1440  4       We can attack Tshombe, but not Gigenza. No matter
B23 1450  2    that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo. No matter
B23 1450 12    that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat
B23 1460 11    Western men. No matter that the Katanga operation is
B23 1470  6    strategically insane in terms of Western interests
B23 1480  2    in Africa. (Even granted that the Congo should be unified,
B23 1490  2    you don't protect Western security by first removing
B23 1500  1    the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium.)
B23 1500  9       We can force Britain and France out of the Suez,
B23 1510  8    but we cannot so much as try to force the Russian tanks
B23 1520  6    back from Budapest. We can mass our fleet against the
B23 1530  4    Trujillos, but not against the Castros. We can vote
B23 1540  2    in the ~UN against South African apartheid or Portuguese
B23 1540 11    rule in Angola, but we cannot even introduce a motion
B23 1550 10    on the Berlin Wall- much less, give the simple order
B23 1560  9    to push the Wall down. We officially receive the anti-French,
B23 1570  5    Moscow-allied Algerian ~FLN, but we denounce the pro-Europe,
B23 1580  7    anti-Communist ~OAS as criminal.
B23 1590  1       In the very week of our war against Katanga, we
B23 1590 11    make a $133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah, who has
B23 1600  8    just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc,
B23 1610  5    and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian
B23 1620  3    dictatorship. As our planes land the war materiel that
B23 1630  1    kills pro-Western Katangans, we stand supinely bleating
B23 1630  9    while Nehru's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old
B23 1640  9    district of our ~NATO ally, Portugal.
B23 1650  3       What explains this uni-directional paralysis? It
B23 1660  2    is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes
B23 1670  1    the frame of our international- and in some degree
B23 1670 10    our domestic- policy. The Suez-Hungary crisis proves
B23 1680  9    that this system was not invented by the new Administration,
B23 1690  6    but only made more consistent and more active.
B23 1700  3    #KEY TO THE PUZZLES#
B23 1700  7    Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa,
B23 1710  4    Katanga and Ghana, as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before
B23 1720  2    them, is the belief that the main theater of the world
B23 1720 13    drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia, Africa
B23 1730  8    and Latin America. From this belief is derived the
B23 1740  7    practical orientation of our policy on the "uncommitted"
B23 1750  4    ("neutralist", "contested") nations, especially on
B23 1760  3    those whose leaders make the most noise- Nehru, Tito,
B23 1770  1    Nkrumah, Sukarno, Betancourt, etc&. Our chief aim becomes
B23 1770  9    that of finding favor in neutralist eyes.
B23 1780  7       If we grasp this orientation as a key, our national
B23 1790  6    conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes
B23 1800  2    intelligible. And it becomes clear why in general we
B23 1800 11    cannot take the initiative against the Left.
B24 0010  1    #BROADWAY#
B24 0010  2    _THE UNORIGINALS_
B24 0010  4       To write a play, the dramatist once needed an idea
B24 0020  4    plus the imagination, the knowledge of life and the
B24 0030  1    craft to develop it. Nowadays, more and more, all he
B24 0030 11    needs is someone else's book. To get started, he does
B24 0040  8    not scan the world about him; he and his prospective
B24 0050  5    producer just read the bestseller lists. So far this
B24 0060  3    season, Broadway's premieres have included twice as
B24 0060 10    many adaptations and imports as original American stage
B24 0070  8    plays.
B24 0080  1    _BEST FROM ABROAD._
B24 0080  2       Of straight dramas, there are All the Way Home,
B24 0090  1    which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee
B24 0090 12    novel, A Death in the Family; The Wall, awkwardly based
B24 0100  8    on the John Hersey novel; Advise and Consent, lively
B24 0110  6    but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed
B24 0120  5    bestseller; Face of a Hero (closed), based on a Pierre
B24 0130  5    Boulle novel. The only original works attempting to
B24 0140  2    reach any stature: Tennessee Williams' disappointing
B24 0140  8    domestic comedy, Period of Adjustment, and Arthur Laurents'
B24 0150  8    clever but empty Invitation to a March. Clearly the
B24 0160  9    most provocative plays are all imported originals-
B24 0170  6    A Taste of Honey, by Britain's young (19 when she wrote
B24 0180  6    it) Shelagh Delaney; Becket, by France's Jean Anouilh;
B24 0190  5    The Hostage (closed), by Ireland's Brendan Behan.
B24 0200  3       Among the musicals, Camelot came from T& H& White's
B24 0210  5    The Once and Future King, and novels were the sources
B24 0220  4    of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi.
B24 0230  3    Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals,
B24 0240  1    but pretty bad, leaving top honors again to an import-
B24 0240 11    the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce. The
B24 0250  9    only other works at least technically original were
B24 0260  6    dreary farces- Send Me No Flowers (closed), Under the
B24 0270  5    Yum-Yum Tree, Critic's Choice. In the forthcoming The
B24 0280  5    Conquering Hero and Carnival, Broadway is not even
B24 0290  5    adapting books, but reconverting old movies (Hail the
B24 0300  3    Conquering Hero and Lili).
B24 0300  7    _DRY OF LIFE._
B24 0305  1       Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations
B24 0310  7    are not necessarily bad. Some memorable plays have
B24 0320  6    been drawn from books, notably Life with Father and
B24 0330  4    Diary of Anne Frank. And particularly in the musical
B24 0340  2    field, adaptations have long been the rule, from Die
B24 0340 11    Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma! and My
B24 0350  9    Fair Lady. As Critic Walter Kerr points out: "Adaptations,
B24 0370  1    so long as they are good, still qualify as creative".
B24 0370 11    And other defenders invariably argue that, after all,
B24 0380  6    Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too. The difference
B24 0390  5    is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and
B24 0400  5    filled it with their own world; most modern adapters
B24 0410  1    totally accept the world of a book, squeeze it dry
B24 0410 11    of life, and add only one contribution of their own:
B24 0420  6    stage technique.
B24 0420  8       The most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals
B24 0430  8    and tested imports is increasing production expense-
B24 0440  5    producers cannot afford to take chances. But that explanation
B24 0450  4    is only partly true. Off-Broadway, where production
B24 0460  2    is still comparatively cheap, is proving itself only
B24 0460 10    slightly more original. Laudably enough, it is offering
B24 0470  8    classics and off-beat imports, but last week only one
B24 0480  7    U&S& original was on the boards, Robert D& Hock's stunning
B24 0490  5    Civil War work, Borak. The real trouble seems to be
B24 0500  6    the failing imagination of U&S& playwrights.
B24 0510  1    #NIGHTCLUBS#
B24 0510  2    _THE COOCH TERPERS_
B24 0510  5       He: "Come with me to the casbah". She: "By subway
B24 0520  9    or cab"?
B24 0530  1       That exchange was not only possible but commonplace
B24 0530  9    last week in Manhattan, as more and more New Yorkers
B24 0540  7    were discovering 29th Street and Eighth Avenue, where
B24 0550  4    half a dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian
B24 0560  2    Nights, Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the
B24 0560 10    American inpost of belly dancing. Several more will
B24 0570  8    open soon. Their burgeoning popularity may be a result
B24 0580  7    of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints,
B24 0590  3    but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always
B24 0600  1    familial- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis.
B24 0610  1       The belly boites, with their papier-mache palm trees
B24 0610  9    or hand-painted Ionic columns, heretofore existed mainly
B24 0620  6    on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families. Customers
B24 0630  5    often bring their children; between performances, enthusiastic
B24 0640  3    young men from the audience will take the floor to
B24 0650  4    demonstrate their own amateur graces. Except for the
B24 0650 12    odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor,
B24 0660  9    the people watch in calm absorption. Small, shirt-sleeved
B24 0670  1    orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time, using guitars,
B24 0680  3    violins, and more alien instruments with names that
B24 0690  1    would open Sesame: the oud, grandfather of the lute;
B24 0690 10    the darbuka, a small drum with the treelike shape of
B24 0700  9    a roemer glass; the def, a low-pitched tambourine.
B24 0710  5    The girls sit quietly with the musicians, wearing prim
B24 0720  2    dresses or plain, secretarial shifts, until it is time
B24 0720 11    to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare
B24 0730 12    uniform of the harem.
B24 0740  1    _CONTINUUM OF MANKIND._
B24 0740  4       If a dancer is good, she suggests purely and superbly
B24 0750  2    the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny-
B24 0750  9    the continuum of mankind. But a great many of what
B24 0760  9    Variety calls the "cooch terpers" are considerably
B24 0770  5    less cosmic than that. Each dancer follows the ancient
B24 0780  4    Oriental pattern- she glides sideways with shoulders
B24 0790  2    motionless while her stomach migrates, and, through
B24 0790  9    breathing and muscle control, she sends ripples across
B24 0800  8    her body to the fingertips and away to the far end
B24 0820  7    of the room. This is done at varying speeds, ranging
B24 0830  2    from the slow and fast Shifte Telli (a musical term
B24 0840  1    meaning double strings) to the fastest, ecstatic Karshilama
B24 0850  8    (meaning greetings or welcome). The New York dancers
B24 0860  8    are highly eclectic, varying the pattern with all kinds
B24 0870  6    of personal improvisations, back bends or floor crawls.
B24 0880  4    But they do not strip. The striptease is crass; the
B24 0890  2    belly dance leaves more to the imagination.
B24 0890  9       When a dancer does well, she provokes a quiet bombardment
B24 0900  8    of dollar bills- although the Manhattan clubs prohibit
B24 0910  5    the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips
B24 0920  3    into the dancers' costumes. With tips, the girls average
B24 0930  1    between $150 and $200 a week, depending on basic salary.
B24 0930 11    Although they are forbidden to sit with the customers,
B24 0940  9    the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks, and most
B24 0950  5    of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.
B24 0960  1    _THE MELTING POT._
B24 0960  4       All over the country, belly clubs have never been
B24 0970  2    bigger, especially in Detroit, Boston and Chicago,
B24 0970  9    and even in small towns; one of the best dancers, a
B24 0980 10    Turkish girl named Semra, works at a roadhouse outside
B24 0990  6    Bristol, Conn&. The girls are kept booked and moving
B24 1000  4    by several agents, notably voluble, black-bearded Murat
B24 1010  2    Somay, a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the
B24 1010 13    central abdomen. He can offer nine Turkish girls, plans
B24 1020  9    to import at least 15 more. But a great many of the
B24 1030  9    dancers are more or less native. Sometimes they get
B24 1040  3    their initial experience in church haflis, conducted
B24 1050  1    by Lebanese and Syrians in the U&S&, where they dance
B24 1050 11    with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.
B24 1065  9       As the girls come to belly dancing from this and
B24 1070  9    other origins, the melting pot has never bubbled more
B24 1080  6    intriguingly. Some Manhattan examples:
B24 1090  1       @ Jemela (surname: Gerby), 23, seems Hong Kong Oriental
B24 1100  1    but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother, was
B24 1100 11    born in America and educated at Holy Cross Academy
B24 1120  4    and Textile High School, says she learned belly dancing
B24 1130  5    at family picnics.
B24 1130  8       @ Serene (Mrs& Wilson), 23, was born in Budapest
B24 1140  7    and raised in Manhattan. Daughter of a gypsy mother
B24 1150  5    who taught her to dance, she is one of the few really
B24 1160  2    beautiful girls in the New York casbah, with dark eyes
B24 1160 12    and dark, waist-length hair, the face of an adolescent
B24 1170  9    patrician and a lithe, glimmering body. Many belly
B24 1185  5    dancers are married, but Serene is one of the few who
B24 1190  5    will admit it.
B24 1190  8       @ Marlene (surname: Adamo), 25, a Brazilian divorcee
B24 1200  5    who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris,
B24 1210  3    now lives on Manhattan's West Side, is about the best
B24 1220  1    belly dancer working the casbah, loves it so much that
B24 1220 11    she dances on her day off. She has the small, highly
B24 1230  9    developed body of a prime athlete, and holds in contempt
B24 1240  5    the "girls who just move sex".
B24 1250  1       @ Leila (Malia Phillips), 25, is a Greenwich Village
B24 1250  9    painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair
B24 1270  5    that cascades almost to her ankles. A graduate of Hollywood
B24 1280  5    High School, she likes to imagine herself, as she takes
B24 1290  4    the floor, "a village girl coming in to a festival".
B24 1300  1       @ Gloria (surname: Ziraldo), circa 30, who was born
B24 1310  1    in Italy and once did "chorus work" in Toronto, has
B24 1310 11    been around longer than most of the others, wistfully
B24 1320  8    remembers the old days when "we used to get the seamen
B24 1340  7    from the ships, you know, with big turtleneck sweaters
B24 1350  2    and handkerchiefs and all. But the ships are very slow
B24 1360  1    now, and we don't get so many sailors any more". The
B24 1360 12    uptown crowd has moved in, and what girl worth her
B24 1370  9    seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a
B24 1380  4    button-down collar?
B24 1390  1    #A SHORT, TORMENTED SPAN#
B24 1390  5    Of the handful of painters that Austria has produced
B24 1400  3    in the 20th century, only one, Oskar Kokoschka, is
B24 1400 12    widely known in the U&S&. This state of unawareness
B24 1410  9    may not last much longer. For ten years a small group
B24 1420  9    of European and U&S& critics has been calling attention
B24 1430  6    to the half-forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele,
B24 1440  3    who died 42 years ago at the age of 28. The critics'
B24 1450  2    campaign finally inspired the first major U&S& exhibit
B24 1460  1    of Schiele's works. The show has been to Boston and
B24 1460 11    Manhattan, will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis.
B24 1470  8    Last week it opened at the J& B& Speed Museum in Louisville,
B24 1480  9    at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was
B24 1490  7    being made ready at the Felix Landau gallery in Los
B24 1500  4    Angeles.
B24 1500  5       Schiele's paintings are anything but pleasant. His
B24 1510  4    people (see color) are angular and knobby-knuckled,
B24 1520  1    sometimes painfully stretched, sometimes grotesquely
B24 1520  6    foreshortened. His colors are dark and murky, and his
B24 1530  9    landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom.
B24 1540  5    But he painted some of the boldest and most original
B24 1550  3    pictures of his time, and even after nearly half a
B24 1550 13    century, the tense, tormented world he put on canvas
B24 1560  9    has lost none of its fascination.
B24 1570  2    _THE DEVIL HIMSELF._
B24 1570  5       The son of a railway stationmaster, Schiele lived
B24 1580  3    most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of
B24 1590  2    Tulln, 14 miles northwest of Vienna. He was an emotional,
B24 1590 12    lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings
B24 1600 10    that he did scarcely any schoolwork. When he was 15,
B24 1610  7    his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at
B24 1620  3    the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Even there he did
B24 1630  2    not last for long. Cried one professor after a few
B24 1630 12    months of Student Schiele's tantrums and rebellion:
B24 1640  5    "The devil himself must have defecated you into my
B24 1650  6    classroom"!
B24 1650  7       For a while his work was influenced deeply by the
B24 1660  7    French impressionists, and by the patterned, mosaic-like
B24 1670  3    paintings of Gustav Klimt, then the dean of Austrian
B24 1680  1    art. Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his
B24 1680 10    own- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter.
B24 1690 10    His pictures were roundly denounced as "the most disgusting
B24 1700  7    things one has ever seen in Vienna". He himself was
B24 1710  6    once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24
B24 1720  4    days- the first three of which he spent desperately
B24 1720 13    trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle.
B24 1730 11    For years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper
B24 1740  9    collars, was even driven to scrounging for cigarette
B24 1750  5    butts in Vienna's gutters. Drafted into the Austrian
B24 1770  3    army, he rebelliously rejected discipline, wangled
B24 1770  9    a Vienna billet, went on painting. It was not until
B24 1780  9    the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking
B24 1790  8    show.
B24 1800  1    _MELANCHOLY OBSESSION._
B24 1800  1       The unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings
B24 1800 10    was not the only thing that kept the public at bay:
B24 1810  8    his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved
B24 1820  3    tragedy, and it was too much even for morbid-minded
B24 1830  1    Vienna. He was obsessed by disease and poverty, by
B24 1830 10    the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust.
B24 1840  8    The children he painted were almost always in rags,
B24 1850  4    his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness,
B24 1860  1    and his nudes- including several self-portraits- were
B24 1860  9    stringy, contorted and strangely pathetic. The subject
B24 1870  7    he liked most was the female body, which he painted
B24 1880  6    in every state- naked, half-dressed, muffled to the
B24 1890  4    ears, sitting primly in a chair, lying tauntingly on
B24 1890 13    a bed or locked in an embrace.
B25 0010  1    THE MOST surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress
B25 0010 10    of the Soviet Communist Party is that it was surprising-
B25 0020 10    perhaps quite as much, in its own way, as the Twentieth
B25 0030 11    Congress of 1956, which ended with that famous "secret"
B25 0040  6    report on Stalin. The publication last July of the
B25 0050  5    party's Draft Program- that blueprint for the "transition
B25 0060  3    to communism"- had led the uninitiated to suppose that
B25 0070  2    this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis
B25 0080  1    of the Khrushchev regime, a solemn consecration of
B25 0080  9    ideas which had, in fact, been current over the last
B25 0090  7    three or four years (i&e&, since the defeat of the
B25 0100  5    "anti-party group") in all theoretical party journals.
B25 0110  2    These never ceased to suggest that if, in the eyes
B25 0110 12    of Marx and Lenin "full communism" was still a very
B25 0120  9    distant ideal, the establishment of a Communist society
B25 0130  5    had now, under Khrushchev, become an "immediate and
B25 0140  4    tangible reality". It seems that Khrushchev himself
B25 0150  2    took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking
B25 0150 13    contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program
B25 0160  8    (a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent
B25 0170  8    Congress was, in fact, very largely a rehash of that
B25 0180  5    interminable document). He and other Soviet leaders
B25 0190  1    responsible for the document were proud of having brought
B25 0190 10    forward some new formulas, such as the early replacement
B25 0200  9    of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an "All People's
B25 0210  8    State", and also of having laid down the lines for
B25 0220  6    a much greater "democratization" of the whole hierarchy
B25 0230  4    of Soviets, starting with the Supreme Soviet itself.
B25 0240  1    Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary
B25 0240 10    blow at "bureaucracy" and would enable "the people"
B25 0250  7    to take a more direct and active part in running the
B25 0260  7    country. Also, elections would be more democratic;
B25 0270  3    there might even be two or more candidates for voters
B25 0280  1    to choose from.
B25 0280  4       No doubt, there was still a lot in the Draft Program-
B25 0290  1    and in Khrushchev's speech- which left many points
B25 0300  1    obscure. Was it the party's intention, for example,
B25 0300  9    to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace
B25 0310  6    it by uniformly wage-earning sovkhozes, i&e&, state
B25 0320  4    farms (which were, moreover, to be progressively "urbanized")?
B25 0330  2    As we know, the Soviet peasant today still very largely
B25 0340  4    thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on
B25 0350  1    his private plot; and it is still very far from certain
B25 0350 12    how valid the party's claim is that in "a growing number
B25 0360 10    of kolkhozes" the peasants are finding it more profitable,
B25 0370  8    to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and
B25 0390  3    to let the latter be turned into something increasingly
B25 0400  2    like a state farm. If one follows the reports of the
B25 0410  1    Congress, one finds that there still seems considerable
B25 0410  9    uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves
B25 0420  8    about what exactly to do in this matter.
B25 0430  2       The Draft Program was interesting in other respects,
B25 0440  1    too. It contained, for example, a number of curious
B25 0440 10    admissions about the peasants, who enjoy no sickness
B25 0450  7    benefits, no old-age pensions, no paid holidays; they
B25 0460  5    still benefit far less than the "other" 50 per cent
B25 0470  3    of the nation from that "welfare state" which the Soviet
B25 0480  1    Union so greatly prides itself on being.
B25 0480  8    ##
B25 0480  9    OVER ALL these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was
B25 0490  6    to skate rather lightly; and, though he repeated, over
B25 0500  6    and over again, the spectacular figures of industrial
B25 0510  3    and agricultural production in 1980, the "ordinary"
B25 0520  1    people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to
B25 0520 11    how "communism" is really going to work in practice,
B25 0530  8    especially in respect of food. Would agriculture progress
B25 0540  4    as rapidly as industry? This was something on which
B25 0550  3    K& himself seemed to have some doubts; for he kept
B25 0560  1    on threatening that he would "pull the ears" of those
B25 0560 11    responsible for agricultural production. And, as we
B25 0570  7    know, the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as
B25 0580  6    Khrushchev had hoped.
B25 0580  9       One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about
B25 0590  7    the success of Khrushchev's agricultural policy have
B25 0600  4    not at least something to do with one of the big surprises
B25 0610  3    provided by this Congress- the obsessive harping on
B25 0610 11    the crimes and misdeeds of the "anti-party group"-
B25 0620  9    Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and others- including
B25 0630  5    the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov. Molotov, in
B25 0640  4    particular, is being charged with all kinds of sins-
B25 0650  3    especially with wanting to cut down free public services,
B25 0660  1    to increase rents and fares; in fact, with having been
B25 0660 11    against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev
B25 0670  8    "welfare state". The trouble with all these doctrinal
B25 0680  7    quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story:
B25 0690  5    what, in the secret councils of the Kremlin, Molotov
B25 0700  2    had really proposed, we just don't know, and he has
B25 0700 12    had no chance to reply.
B25 0710  5    ##
B25 0710  6    BUT ONE cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop
B25 0720  6    harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated "anti-party"
B25 0730  3    group would be totally unnecessary if there were not,
B25 0740  1    inside the party, some secret but genuine opposition
B25 0740  9    to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds, on the actual
B25 0750  7    methods to be employed in the "transition to communism"
B25 0760  4    and, last but not least, on foreign policy.
B25 0770  1       The whole problem of "peaceful coexistence and peaceful
B25 0780  1    competition" with the capitalist world is in the very
B25 0780 10    center of this Congress. Mikoyan declared:
B25 0790  4       "Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful
B25 0800  5    coexistence, reducing this concept merely to the state
B25 0810  2    of peace or rather, the absence of war at a given moment,
B25 0810 14    and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world
B25 0820 11    war. His views, in fact, coincide with those of foreign
B25 0830  7    enemies of peaceful coexistence, who look upon it merely
B25 0840  6    as a variant of the "cold war" or of an "armed peace"".
B25 0850  2       One cannot help wondering whether Molotov and the
B25 0860  3    rest of the "anti-party group" are not being used as
B25 0860 14    China's whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful
B25 0870  8    followers. For something, clearly, has gone very, very
B25 0880  7    seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese relations, which
B25 0890  3    were never easy, and have now deteriorated.
B25 0900  1       The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev,
B25 0900 10    together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov +
B25 0910  8    Co&, has shifted the whole attention of the world,
B25 0920  5    including that of the Soviet people, from the "epoch-making"
B25 0930  4    twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict.
B25 0940  2    Not only, as we know, did Chou En-lai publicly treat
B25 0950  1    Khrushchev's attack on Albania as "something that we
B25 0950  9    cannot consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach"
B25 0960  7    to the problem (i&e&, as something thoroughly dictatorial
B25 0970  5    and "undemocratic"), but the Albanian leaders went
B25 0980  5    out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev,
B25 0990  2    calling him a liar, a bully, and so on. It is extremely
B25 1000  1    doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves
B25 1000 10    Communists could have done this without the direct
B25 1010  8    approval of their Chinese friends. The big question
B25 1020  4    is whether, in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet
B25 1030  1    solidarity, the Chinese will choose to persuade the
B25 1030  9    Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev-
B25 1040  8    or get rid of Enver Hoxa. These seem about the only
B25 1050  8    two ways in which the "unhappy incident" can now be
B25 1060  5    closed.
B25 1060  6       But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise
B25 1070  5    between China and Russia. There are other symptoms.
B25 1080  2    Khrushchev, for all his bombastic prophecies about
B25 1080  9    the inevitable decay of capitalism, is genuinely favorable
B25 1090  7    to "peaceful coexistence" and would like, above all,
B25 1100  6    the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully;
B25 1110  5    he knows that he was never more popular than at the
B25 1120  3    time of the Russo-American "honeymoon" of 1959. But
B25 1130  1    it seems that pressures against him are coming from
B25 1130 10    somewhere- in the first place from China, but perhaps
B25 1140  7    also from that "China Lobby" which, I was assured in
B25 1150  6    Moscow nearly two years ago, exists on the quiet inside
B25 1160  4    the party. To these people, solidarity and unity with
B25 1170  1    China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy.
B25 1170 11    And the Chinese, as the Albanian incident shows, have
B25 1180  8    strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure
B25 1190  6    a "shameful" peace with the West. The fact that China
B25 1200  5    (which is obsessed by Formosa- to Khrushchev a very
B25 1210  3    small matter) should be supported by North Korea and
B25 1210 12    North Vietnam is highly indicative. And one cannot
B25 1220  8    but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky, who was blowing
B25 1230  4    hot and cold, exalting peace but also almost openly
B25 1240  4    considering the possibility of preventive war against
B25 1250  1    the West, wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet.
B25 1250 10    And this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton
B25 1260  4    bomb. Was not this dropped primarily in order to "appease"
B25 1270  6    the Chinese- especially after "Khrushchev's "humiliating"
B25 1280  3    surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty
B25 1290  5    deadline of December 31?
B25 1290  9       What does it all add up to? Indications are that
B25 1300 10    Khrushchev (and, with him, the bulk of the Soviet people)
B25 1310  8    favor peaceful coexistence and (with the exception
B25 1320  3    of Berlin) the maintenance of the status quo in the
B25 1330  2    world. The Chinese, North Vietnamese and North Koreans,
B25 1330 10    on the other hand, feel that, militarily, Russia is
B25 1340  9    strong enough to support them in the "just wars of
B25 1350  7    liberation" they would like to embark on before long:
B25 1360  4    with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans
B25 1370  1    and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of
B25 1370  9    their respective countries.
B25 1380  2       Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position
B25 1390  2    than any since 1957, when the "anti-party group" nearly
B25 1400  1    liquidated him. He seems strong enough inside the party
B25 1400 10    to cope with any internal opposition; but if he is
B25 1410  8    up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs,
B25 1420  5    he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice
B25 1430  2    in his life. He may support China (but he won't); he
B25 1440  1    may break with China (which would be infernally difficult
B25 1440 10    and perhaps disastrous), or he may succeed, by all
B25 1450  8    kinds of dangerous concessions, in persuading China
B25 1460  4    to be patient. The next days may show where things
B25 1470  1    stand. ON a misty Sunday morning last month, a small
B25 1480 10    band of militant anti-Communists called the Minutemen
B25 1490  6    held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles
B25 1500  4    east of here. Eleven men, a woman and a teen-age boy
B25 1510  2    tramped over cold, damp, fog-enshrouded ground during
B25 1510 10    a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla
B25 1520  8    warfare.
B25 1520  9       To the average American, this must sound like an
B25 1530  7    incredible tale from a Saturday night ~TV movie. But
B25 1540  5    to the Minutemen, this is a serious business. They
B25 1550  2    feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death
B25 1560  1    struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy.
B25 1560  9    They feel that World War /3, has already begun, and
B25 1570  9    they are setting themselves up as a "last line of defense"
B25 1580  8    against the Communist advance.
B25 1590  1       Their national leader, Robert Bolivar DePugh of
B25 1590  8    Norborne, Mo&, says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla
B25 1600  8    tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught.
B25 1610  7    In their maneuvers last month, they wore World War
B25 1620  5    /2, camouflage garb and helmets, and carried unloaded
B25 1630  1    ~M-1 rifles.
B25 1630  4       The maneuvers were held "in secret" after a regional
B25 1640  4    seminar for the Minutemen, held in nearby Shiloh, Ill&,
B25 1650  2    had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs,
B25 1650 12    who had arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of
B25 1660  7    Collinsville, Ill&, and seized four operative weapons,
B25 1670  6    including a Browning machine gun, two Browning automatic
B25 1680  4    rifles and an ~M-4 rifle.
B25 1680 10       Undismayed by this contretemps, a small band of
B25 1690  8    the faithful gathered at Lauchli's home at 6:30 A&M&
B25 1700  5    the next day, put on their uniforms, and headed for
B25 1710  4    a farm several miles away. A 60 mm& mortar and a 57
B25 1715  2    mm& recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought
B25 1720  8    along. The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and
B25 1730  7    the recoilless rifle was deactivated.
B25 1740  1       After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World
B25 1740 12    War /2, army jeep down soggy trails, the band arrived
B25 1750 10    at a small clearing squeezed between a long, low ridge
B25 1760  7    and a creek-filled gully. Here the two leaders, DePugh
B25 1770  5    and Lauchli, hastened to put the group through its
B25 1780  3    paces.
B25 1780  4       The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain
B25 1790  3    for concealment. They were shown how to advance against
B25 1790 12    an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge. They practiced
B25 1800  9    movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades;
B25 1810  7    and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against
B25 1820  5    a camouflaged enemy encampment. Eleven dummy rounds
B25 1830  2    were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire
B25 1830 12    mortar shooting.
B25 1840  2       Mrs& DePugh, the mother of five children and an
B25 1850  1    active member of her husband's organization, participated
B25 1850  8    in all the exercises.
B25 1860  2       There were no "casualties", but the "guerrillas"
B25 1870  1    admitted to being "a little tired" when the leaders
B25 1870 10    called a halt at 9 A&M& to enable out-of-town members
B25 1880 12    to catch a plane.
B26 0010  1    #TENURE AS CRITERION#
B26 0010  4    I would like to add one more practical reform to those
B26 0020  3    mentioned by Russell Kirk [Dec& 16]. It has to do with
B26 0030  2    teachers' salaries and tenure.
B26 0030  6       Next September, after receiving a degree from Yale's
B26 0040  5    Master of Arts in Teaching Program, I will be teaching
B26 0050  5    somewhere- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage
B26 0060  2    of mathematics teachers. I will also be underpaid.
B26 0060 10    The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the
B26 0070 11    dearth of teachers. Teaching is at present a sellers'
B26 0080  6    market; as a result buyers, the public, must be satisfied
B26 0090  5    with second-rate teachers. But this is not the real
B26 0100  3    problem; the rub arises from the fact that teachers
B26 0100 12    are usually paid on the basis of time served rather
B26 0110  9    than quality. Hence all teachers, good and bad, who
B26 0120  6    have been teaching for a given number of years are
B26 0130  3    paid the same salary. I am firmly convinced that considering
B26 0140  1    the average quality of teachers in this country, the
B26 0140 10    profession is grossly overpaid.
B26 0150  2       It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect
B26 0160  1    any marked salary increases; there is a limit to how
B26 0160 11    much the public will pay for shoddy performance. The
B26 0170  7    only hope which good teachers have for being paid their
B26 0180  6    due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers
B26 0190  4    up the economic ladder with them. The only hope which
B26 0200  1    the public has for getting good teachers is to pay
B26 0200 11    teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure.
B26 0210  6    Here, as in all sectors of the economy, quality and
B26 0220  3    justice are both dependent on the right of the individual
B26 0230  1    to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses.

B26 0230 12    #LOSS OF INITIATIVE#
B26 0240  3    On the eve of the "great debate" on the proposal to
B26 0250  2    give the President broad powers to make across-the-board
B26 0250 12    tariff concessions which could practically bring us
B26 0260  6    into the Atlantic Community, we should face the alternatives
B26 0270  6    on this proposition. What we will be sacrificing in
B26 0280  4    any such arrangement will be our power to be selective
B26 0290  1    which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle
B26 0290  9    under which we now operate. Without this power we lay
B26 0300  9    open any American industry which the Europeans may
B26 0310  5    find it economically profitable to destroy to the will
B26 0320  4    of others. It is this loss of initiative in how we
B26 0320 15    conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative
B26 0330 11    in how we conduct our political affairs. @
B26 0340  6    #A BRIEF FOR THE NEGATIVE#
B26 0350  1    I disagree with Mr& Burnham's position on the Common
B26 0350 10    Market [Nov& 18] as a desirable organization for us
B26 0360  9    to join. For him to ignore the political consequences
B26 0370  5    involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult
B26 0380  5    to understand. The pressure for our entry to the Common
B26 0390  3    Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this
B26 0390 12    amalgamated trade union by way of a purely "economic
B26 0400  9    thoroughfare", or garden path, with the political ramifications
B26 0410  7    kept neatly in the background. The appeal is going
B26 0420  5    to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing
B26 0430  1    to those who do not see its relation to political and
B26 0430 12    legal, as well as economic, self-rule. In entering
B26 0440  9    this union we will be surrendering most, if not all,
B26 0450  5    of our economic autonomy to international bodies such
B26 0460  3    as the Atlantic Institute (recently set up) or the
B26 0460 12    O&E&C&D&, I&M&F& and others. To think that we can merely
B26 0480  1    relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up
B26 0480  8    our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.
B26 0490  7       If it is not enough that all of our internationalist
B26 0500  5    One Worlders are advocating that we join this market,
B26 0510  3    I refer you to an article in the New York Times' magazine
B26 0520  2    section [Nov& 12, 1961], by Mr& Eric Johnston, entitled
B26 0530  2    "We Must Join the Common Market". He says: "It has
B26 0540  2    swept aside petty nationalisms, age-old rivalries,
B26 0540  9    and worn-out customs". Referring to Britain, he says,
B26 0550  7    "We see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty
B26 0560  4    above all else willing to give up its economy, placing
B26 0570  3    this authority in Continental hands". **h Since the
B26 0580  2    goal of our international planners is a World Government,
B26 0580 11    this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in
B26 0590  8    that direction for, once American economic autonomy
B26 0600  4    is absorbed, a larger grouping is a question of time.
B26 0610  3    Frankly, it is being very cleverly done for, in a sense,
B26 0620  1    they have us over a barrel. Listen to what Mr& Johnston
B26 0620 12    has to say: "Consider the savage wounds that isolationism
B26 0630  8    would inflict. **h We would lose our export markets
B26 0640  8    and deny ourselves the imports we need. We would be
B26 0650  6    crippled by reduced output, industrial decline, widespread
B26 0660  2    unemployment".
B26 0660  3       But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation
B26 0670  5    of the United States into an Atlantic Community or
B26 0680  2    "economic empire", but merely what libertarians like
B26 0680  9    Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig von Mises have been arguing
B26 0690  9    for years: an end to government regulations, an end
B26 0700  7    to government competition in industry, and a realistic
B26 0710  4    depreciation allowance for industry. Create a free
B26 0720  2    market here, give us a sound, debt-free money system,
B26 0720 12    and we'll compete with anyone, Europe and Asia combined.
B26 0730  8    In short, get this governmental monstrosity off our
B26 0740  5    backs and we won't have to worry about European competition
B26 0750  3    or Communism either. If we want to preserve our sovereignty,
B26 0760  3    this is the way to do it; not acquiesce to an international
B26 0770  1    planning board. If we go into this Common Market, we
B26 0770 11    might just as well stop talking about Constitutional
B26 0780  8    guarantees, Connally Amendments or, for that matter,
B26 0790  6    conservatism in general. @
B26 0800  1       We welcome this able brief for the negative as part
B26 0800 11    of a many-sided discussion of the Atlantic Common Market

B26 0860 11    #A PROFESSOR AND THE ARMY#
B26 0870  4    In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two years honorably
B26 0880  3    on Active Duty I was not required to participate in
B26 0890  1    any further Army Reserve activities. Now, more than
B26 0890  9    five years later, I cannot in any realistic sense be
B26 0900  8    called a trained soldier. But, in spite of this, I,
B26 0910  6    at present a man 31 years of age and a College Professor,
B26 0920  2    have been recalled "by direction of the President"
B26 0930  1    to report on November 25th to Fort Devens, Massachusetts,
B26 0930 10    for another twelve months of Active Duty as an ~Sp
B26 0940  9    4 (the equivalent of a ~PFC). Today, seven years after
B26 0950  6    the date of my initial induction as a draftee, I am
B26 0960  6    Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science at St&
B26 0970  3    Michael's College. For, after leaving the Army in 1956,
B26 0980  1    I spent five years in Graduate School first at Boston
B26 0980 11    College and then at the University of Toronto. This
B26 0990  9    time, added to that which I had already spent in school
B26 1000  7    prior to my induction in 1954, makes a total of twenty-two
B26 1010  6    (22) years of education.
B26 1010 10       The possibility of recall into the Army is part
B26 1020  8    of the price that a modern American has to pay for
B26 1030  5    the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys. With
B26 1040  1    this no loyal citizen can quarrel. However, it seems
B26 1040 10    axiomatic that the government has an obligation "to
B26 1050  7    exercise its mandate reasonably, equitably and with
B26 1060  4    full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably
B26 1070  1    causes". In my own case, I submit that such reasonable
B26 1070 11    and fair exercise is woefully lacking. Taken back into
B26 1080  8    the Army now as an ~Sp 4, I am leaving 110 college
B26 1090  8    students whose teacher I am. (A wry sidelight on this
B26 1100  5    is that most of my students have deferments from the
B26 1110  2    draft in order to attend my classes.) At this late
B26 1110 12    date, it is impossible for St& Michael's College to
B26 1120  7    find a suitable replacement for me. Even apart from
B26 1130  6    the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life
B26 1140  2    is being totally disrupted for the second time for
B26 1140 11    no very compelling reason- I cannot help looking around
B26 1150  8    at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly
B26 1160  5    on the street corners and in the taverns of every American
B26 1170  4    city and asking myself if our society has gone mad.

B26 1190  4    volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to
B26 1200  3    as mercenaries. This confuses me no end. If the Hessian
B26 1210  1    troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government
B26 1210 10    to fight for England in the 1770's were mercenaries,
B26 1220  7    what shall we call the ~UN troops sent to the Congo

B26 1250  2    the Hessians were not mercenaries either. And if the
B26 1250 11    foreigners fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries
B26 1260  8    then Lafayette and von Steuben were mercenaries too,
B26 1270  7    as were also the members of the Lafayette Escadrille

B26 1380 11    #THE IMPENDING DEATH OF POPE#
B26 1390  5    In the issue of March 5, 1960 you had an excellent
B26 1400  2    editorial which said:
B26 1400  5       "On trial in Jakarta for having flown for the Indonesian
B26 1410  6    anti-Communist insurgents, U&S& pilot Alan Lawrence
B26 1420  4    Pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom
B26 1430  3    fighters, he was actually defending the sovereignty
B26 1430 10    and independence of Indonesia. Facing a prosecution
B26 1440  6    which has demanded the death penalty, he said: 'I have
B26 1450  7    participated in the war against Communism in Korea
B26 1460  4    and at Dienbienphu, and I have helped in the evacuation
B26 1470  1    of North Vietnamese to the free world. I have done
B26 1470 11    all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned
B26 1480  8    and also for the states which have been threatened
B26 1490  5    by Communist domination'. At least in Indonesia, Khrushchev
B26 1500  3    found an American proud to be at total war with Communism"!
B26 1510  2       Since then nothing has happened to save the life
B26 1520  2    of Pope. I found recently a very small article in the
B26 1520 13    New York Times:
B26 1525  3       "U&S& Flier loses Plea. Indonesia Court Upholds
B26 1540  2    Pope's Death Sentence.- Indonesia Military Supreme
B26 1550  1    Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan
B26 1550 10    Lawrence Pope, an American pilot. Pope was convicted
B26 1560  8    last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying
B26 1570  6    bombing missions. He has been in prison since May,
B26 1580  4    1958, when his aircraft was shot down over Moluccas.
B26 1590  1    He may appeal to President Sukarno for clemency".
B26 1590  9       As we see, Pope may appeal to President Sukarno,
B26 1600  9    Khrushchev's friend, for clemency. This possibility
B26 1610  5    is anything but reassuring.
B26 1620  1       The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on
B26 1620  8    behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters. But who will
B26 1630  6    act now and immediately to save the life of Alan Pope?
B26 1640  5    Are tractors available for him? Does anybody think
B26 1650  2    of saving the life of an anti-Communist American pilot?

B26 1660  2    #AN ANALOGY#
B26 1660  4    A few days before I saw your mention of what Texas
B26 1670  1    Liberals were doing to promote "Louis Capet" ["The
B26 1670  9    Week", June 3], another analogy had occurred to me.
B26 1680  9       Consider this table:
B26 1690  3    _1._
B26 1690  4       Louis /14,- ~FDR. "**h With no strong men and no
B26 1700  4    parliament to dispute his will, he was the government".
B26 1710  1    _2._
B26 1710  2       Regency- Truman. "A 'dust-settling' period of decadence
B26 1720  3    and decline".
B26 1720  5    _3._
B26 1720  6       Louis /15,- Eisenhower. "**h he opened his mouth,
B26 1730  6    said little, and thought not at all".
B26 1740  1    _4._
B26 1740  1       Louis /16,- Kennedy. "**h not completely virtuous,
B26 1750  1    but completely incompetent".
B26 1750  4       And Marie Antoinette- Jacqueline Bouvier. "**h the
B26 1760  4    beautiful and light-hearted".
B26 1770  1    _5._
B26 1770  1       French Revolution- Conservative Revolution?
B26 1770  5       Truly, that Liberals should choose Louis /14, as
B26 1780  8    a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic,
B26 1790  4    considering the Louis /14, character of their Grand
B26 1800  4    Monarque, ~FDR: not only in his accretion of absolute
B26 1810  1    power and personal deification, (le roi gouverne par
B26 1810  9    lui meme), but in the disastrous effects of his spending
B26 1820  9    and war policies.
B26 1830  1       In defeating "Louis Capet", John Tower's victory
B26 1830  8    in Texas signals, once again, the end of the divine
B26 1840 10    right of Liberalism.
B27 0010  1    #CONFRONTATION#
B27 0010  2    IT SEEMS TO ME that N&C&, in his editorial "Confrontation"
B27 0020  2    [~SR, Mar& 25], has hit upon the real problem that
B27 0030  3    bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain
B27 0040  1    our personal relationship with those who suffer? This
B27 0040  9    affects us all intimately, and can leave us hopeless
B27 0050  8    in the face of widespread distress. I know of no other
B27 0060  6    solution than the one N&C& proposes- to do what we
B27 0070  7    can for each sufferer as he confronts us, hoping that
B27 0080  1    this will spread beyond him to others at some time
B27 0080 11    and some place. Never have I seen this expressed so
B27 0090  7    clearly and so sympathetically. @
B27 0100  1       THANK YOU for the illustrated editorial "Confrontation".
B27 0110  1    It is both great writing and profound religion. @
B27 0120  1       N&C& HAS SAID something important so well that this
B27 0120  9    preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole
B27 0130 10    piece. @
B27 0130 12       I FEEL THAT N&C& hit the very core of our existence
B27 0140 11    in the editorial "Confrontation". Personally, it meant
B27 0150  5    a great deal; my only hope is that it will be shared
B27 0160  9    by many, many others. @
B27 0170  1       "CONFRONTATION" should fortify us all, whether in
B27 0170  7    Southeast Asia or the U&S&. @
B27 0180  6       CONGRATULATIONS TO N&C& for successfully delving
B27 0190  4    into the heart of the problems that face the Peace
B27 0200  2    Corps. I concur that it is necessary for Americans
B27 0200 11    to have a confrontation of the situation existing in
B27 0210  8    foreign lands. It would be heartbreaking to see idealism,
B27 0220  6    and hence effective leadership, thwarted by the poverty
B27 0230  4    and hardship which young Americans will run into. @
B27 0240  2       THE EDITORIAL "Confrontation" was certainly direct
B27 0250  1    in its appear to those of us living here in America.
B27 0250 12    I personally gained strength from it. Thanks for continuing
B27 0260  8    to capture the attention and uncover so many areas
B27 0270  6    of need in this amazing world. @
B27 0280  1       N&C&'s EDITORIAL "Confrontation" is a stunning piece
B27 0290  1    of writing. I would hope that Sargent Shriver will
B27 0290 10    encourage everyone entering the Peace Corps to read
B27 0300  7    it. The important people to humanity are not the Khrushchevs
B27 0310  6    and the Castros **h but the Schweitzers and the Dooleys,
B27 0320  4    and the others like them whose names we will never
B27 0330  2    know. @
B27 0330  4       EDITOR'S NOTE: Reprints of "Confrontation" will
B27 0340  2    be included among the material to be distributed to
B27 0350  1    members of the Peace Corps. A Peace Corps official
B27 0350 10    described the editorial as "precisely the message we
B27 0360  7    need to communicate to the men and women who will soon
B27 0370  7    be Peace Corps volunteers".
B27 0370 11    #IMPROPER BOSTONIAN?#
B27 0380  2    F& L& LUCAS'S article in ~SR's April 1 issue seemed
B27 0390  5    to be a very fair and objective analysis of the New
B27 0400  2    English Bible. I certainly hope this will be the impression
B27 0400 12    left in the minds of readers, rather than the comment
B27 0410 10    by Cleveland Amory in his FIRST OF THE MONTH column.
B27 0420  8    It is blind, fundamentalist dogmatism to say, "Messing
B27 0430  5    around with the King James version **h seems to us
B27 0440  5    a perilous sport at best". @
B27 0440 11    #FACTS IN FOCUS#
B27 0450  1    LESTER MARKEL is on the right track in his article
B27 0450 11    "Interpretation of Interpretation" [~SR, Mar& 11].
B27 0460  4    The current stereotype of straight news reporting was
B27 0470  6    probably invaluable in protecting the press and its
B27 0480  5    readers from pollution by that combination of doctored
B27 0490  1    fact, fancy, and personal opinion called yellow journalism
B27 0490  9    which flourished in this country more than a generation
B27 0500  8    ago.
B27 0500  9       We don't need this type of protection any more.
B27 0510  8    The public is now armed with sophistication and numerous
B27 0520  4    competing media. Besides, there are no longer enough
B27 0530  3    corruptible journalists about.
B27 0530  6       The accepted method of writing news has two major
B27 0540  7    liabilities. First, it does not communicate. A reporter
B27 0550  3    restricted to the competing propaganda statements of
B27 0560  2    both sides in a major labor dispute, for instance,
B27 0560 11    is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows
B27 0570  8    about the causes of the dispute. Second, it subjects
B27 0580  4    the news to distortion by the unscrupulous. The charges
B27 0590  2    by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only
B27 0590 11    destroyed innocent people but misled the nation. Yet
B27 0600  8    the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective
B27 0610  7    in its news columns. despite several years of front-page
B27 0620  5    stories, the average citizen was unable to get a complete
B27 0630  3    picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television
B27 0630 12    screen what the reporters had been seeing all along
B27 0640  9    but had no effective way of communicating. The Senator
B27 0650  5    had boxed them in with their own restrictions.
B27 0660  1       It seems to me the time has come for the American
B27 0670  1    press to start experimenting with ways of reporting
B27 0670  9    the news that will do a better job of communicating
B27 0680  7    and will be less subject to abuse by those who have
B27 0690  4    learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to
B27 0690 12    serve their own ends. The objective should be to provide
B27 0700 10    a method of getting into print a higher percentage
B27 0710  6    than is now possible of the relevant information in
B27 0720  3    the possession of reporters and editors. @
B27 0730  1    #SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BLACKOUT#
B27 0730  4    I WOULD LIKE to see you devote some space in an early
B27 0740  6    issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy's
B27 0750  2    activities, so far as Southern California is concerned.
B27 0760  1    You have on more than one occasion praised the idea
B27 0760 11    of a televised press conference and the chance it gives
B27 0770  8    the people to form intelligent opinions.
B27 0780  2       To begin with, the all-powerful Los Angeles Times
B27 0790  1    does not publish a transcript of these press conferences.
B27 0790 10    I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President.
B27 0800 10       Next, because of the time differential, the conferences
B27 0810  8    come on the networks during the middle of the day.
B27 0820  7    Up until now, the networks have grudgingly run half-hour
B27 0830  4    tapes at 5 P&M& or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P&M&. Even
B27 0840  2    then, a few of the "less interesting" questions are
B27 0850  1    edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator.
B27 0850  9    However, last night the tapes were not run at all during
B27 0860  9    the evening hours and all we got on ~TV were a few
B27 0870  6    snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley
B27 0880  3    could squeeze into their programs. This is no criticism
B27 0890  1    of them, as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program
B27 0890 12    into a fifteen-minute news summary.
B27 0900  3       The radio stations did run "transcripts" (I thought)
B27 0910  3    during the evening hours. However, by comparing the
B27 0920  2    ~TV snatches, two different radio station re-runs,
B27 0920 10    and the censored Los Angeles Times version, I found
B27 0930  7    that the radio stations had edited out questions (~ABC
B27 0940  6    removed the one regarding Laos) or even a paragraph
B27 0950  5    out of the middle of the President's answer. I am interested
B27 0960  4    to know he is getting mail from all over the country
B27 0970  1    about the "abuse" he is being subjected to. We out
B27 0970 11    here don't see enough of the conference to know he
B27 0980  9    is being abused.
B27 0980 12       I don't know if this is the situation in other parts
B27 0990 10    of the country; apparently it is not. It also happened
B27 1000  7    with the Inauguration, which was not re-run at all
B27 1010  6    during the evening hours, and I wrote to the ~TV editor
B27 1020  2    of the Times. He did mention in his column the fact
B27 1020 13    that he had received many letters about this and he
B27 1030 10    himself did not understand the networks and the independent
B27 1040  6    local stations' not doing this- but nothing happened.
B27 1050  6       Can you bring the networks' attention to this? @
B27 1060  4    #FOR A COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA#
B27 1060  9    I WAS INTERESTED in James Webb Young's MADISON AVENUE
B27 1070  7    column in which he raised the question "Do We Need
B27 1080  8    a College of Propaganda"? [~SR, Feb& 11].
B27 1090  4       In my estimation, we definitely do; and the sad
B27 1100  5    part of it is that we had one, which was rounding into
B27 1110  1    excellent shape, and we let it disintegrate and die.
B27 1110 10       During the war, we set up schools for the teaching
B27 1120 10    of psychological warfare, which included the teaching
B27 1130  5    of propaganda, both black and white and the various
B27 1140  2    shades of grey in between. We had a couple of schools
B27 1140 13    in this country, the principal one being on the Marshall
B27 1150  9    Field estate out in Lloyd's Neck. There were also a
B27 1160  8    couple in Canada, and several in England. The English
B27 1170  5    schools preceded ours, and by the time we got into
B27 1180  3    it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda
B27 1190  1    and its teaching.
B27 1190  4       Four of us here in the United States attended, first
B27 1200  2    as students, then as instructors, almost every one
B27 1200 10    of these schools, in England, Canada, and the United
B27 1210  8    States. We set up the Lloyd's Neck school, worked out
B27 1220  7    its curriculum, and taught there. Toward the end of
B27 1230  5    the war, we really felt that we had learned something
B27 1240  1    about propaganda and how to teach it.
B27 1240  8       When the end did come, and the schools were disbanded
B27 1250  7    and abandoned, we felt and hoped that the machinery
B27 1260  4    of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust.
B27 1270  1    We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might
B27 1270  9    be put on some sort of reserve list and called back
B27 1280  8    for refresher courses each year or so. Alas, no such
B27 1290  6    thing happened. There apparently is no school of propaganda
B27 1300  2    or psychological warfare. A study at the Pentagon and
B27 1300 11    at the service academies revealed that nothing was
B27 1310  8    being done there. And not one of the four men who attended
B27 1320  9    all the schools has ever been called on to apply any
B27 1330  6    of his knowledge in any way. @
B27 1330 13       CONGRATULATIONS on the article "Do We Need a College
B27 1340  9    of Propaganda"? This is one of the most constructive
B27 1350  8    suggestions made in this critical field in years, and
B27 1360  6    I certainly hope it sparks some action. @
B27 1370  2    #LET THE MEDIA CLEAN HOUSE, TOO#
B27 1370  8    MANY OF US in public relations were flattered that
B27 1380  5    Richard L& Tobin chose to devote his editorial in the
B27 1390  4    March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger of
B27 1400  2    the Public Relations Society of America and the American
B27 1400 11    Public Relations Association.
B27 1420  1    #SNOW STORM#
B27 1420  3    I WAS SURPRISED and sorry to find in your issue of
B27 1430  2    March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that
B27 1430 13    had not yet been published.
B27 1440  3       Whether in his forthcoming book C& P& Snow commits
B27 1450  2    the errors of judgment and of fact with which your
B27 1450 12    heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important.
B27 1460  7    One should be able to get hold of the book at once.
B27 1470  9    But the attack was made from an advance copy. If this
B27 1480  4    practice should take root and spread, the man who submits
B27 1490  2    a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed
B27 1490 11    before he is accepted and publication will become a
B27 1500  9    sort of post-mortem formality. @
B27 1510  2       EDITOR'S NOTE: Sir Robert Watson-Watt wrote, on
B27 1520  3    page 50 of ~SR/ Research for 4 March 1961: "I have
B27 1530  2    read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be
B27 1530 14    titled, 'Science and Government'. Until the work actually
B27 1540  7    appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly
B27 1550  7    in detail. But I have compared its text with already
B27 1560  5    published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin
B27 1570  1    lectures at Harvard, from which the book was derived,
B27 1570 10    and I can with confidence challenge the gist of C&
B27 1580  8    P& Snow's incautious tale".
B27 1590  2       Watson-Watt's remarks in ~SR did not then, constitute
B27 1600  2    a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures.
B27 1610  1    Representatives of Harvard University Press, which
B27 1610  7    is publishing the book this month of April, recognize
B27 1620  8    and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction
B27 1630  6    by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from
B27 1640  4    the book in advance of the book's publication date.
B27 1650  1    The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression
B27 1650 11    than the prepublication excerpt.
B27 1660  3    ##
B27 1660  4    SIR ROBERT WATSON-WATT'S "rebuttal" of Sir Charles
B27 1670  4    Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too
B27 1680  3    forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently
B27 1680 11    himself from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while
B27 1690  7    stating those "falsehoods" in an unclear incoherent
B27 1700  5    argument.
B27 1700  6       The article presents the reader with an absurdity
B27 1710  7    at its beginning. It calls the conclusion admitted
B27 1720  3    valid by "historians and military strategists alike"
B27 1730  1    a "perverted conclusion. **h nonsense".
B27 1730  6       It submits an enthusiastic, impressionistic conception
B27 1740  5    of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man,
B27 1750  6    but on no more authoritative basis than Sir Charles'
B27 1760  2    account. We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns.
B27 1770  1       The only fact that holds any weight in the article
B27 1770 11    is the result of the tea party. But we are to believe
B27 1780 11    that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the
B27 1790  5    Tizard Committee, and dissembling, discounted it inside?
B27 1800  4    If so, I would lean to Sir Charles' conception of the
B27 1810  3    man.
B27 1810  4       I think it was a grave error to print the article
B27 1820  2    at this time. To the unfortunate people unable to attend
B27 1820 12    the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura
B27 1830  8    of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some
B27 1840  6    people from reading it. @
